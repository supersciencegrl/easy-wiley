         <title>Enhanced Photodynamic Therapy for Neurodegenerative Diseases: Development of Azobenzene&#8208;Spiropyran@Gold Nanoparticles for Controlled Singlet Oxygen Generation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of durable photosensitizers is pivotal for advancing phototherapeutic applications in biomedicine. Here, we introduce a core&#8208;shell azobenzene&#8208;spiropyran structure on gold nanoparticles, engineered to enhance singlet oxygen generation. These nano&#8208;photosensitizers exhibit increased structural stability and thermal resistance, as demonstrated by slowed O&#8208;N&#8208;C bond recombination dynamics via in&#8208;situ Raman spectroscopy. Notably, the in&#8208;situ formation of merocyanine and a light&#8208;induced compact shell arrangement extend its half&#8208;life from 47 minutes to over 154 hours, significantly boosting singlet oxygen output. The nano&#8208;photosensitizer also shows high biocompatibility and notably inhibits tau protein aggregation in neural cells, even with phosphatase inhibitors. Further, it promotes dendritic growth in neuro cells, doubling typical lengths. This work not only advances chemical nanotechnology but also sets a foundation for developing long&#8208;lasting phototherapy agents for treating neurodegenerative diseases</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We reported herein a visible light mediated de Mayo&#8208;type reaction between 1,3&#8208;diketones and BCB. The reaction proceeds through a [2&#960;+2&#963;] cycloaddition and retro&#8208;aldol sequence, producing cis&#8208;difunctionalized cyclobutanes in high yields with good regio&#8208; and diastereoselectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>A Two&#8208;step Intermolecular Interaction of Molecular Macroions with&#160;Multivalent Counterions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Macroion&#8208;counterion interaction is essential for regulating the solution behaviors of hydrophilic macroions, as simple models for polyelectrolytes. Here, we explore the interaction between uranyl peroxide molecular cluster Li68K12(OH)20[UO2(O2)OH]60 (U60) and multivalent counterions. Different from interaction with monovalent counterions that shows a simple one&#8208;step process, isothermal titration calorimetry, combined with light/X&#8208;ray scattering measurements and electron microscopy, confirm a two&#8208;step process for their interaction with multivalent counterions: an ion&#8208;pairing between U60 and the counterion with partial breakage of hydration shells followed by strong U60&#8208;U60 attraction, leading to the formation of large nanosheets with severe breakage and reconstruction of hydration shells. The detailed studies on macroion&#8208;counterion interaction can be nicely correlated to the microscopic (self&#8208;assembly) and macroscopic (gelation or phase separation) phase transitions in the dilute U60 aqueous solutions induced by multivalent counterions.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The reaction of hydrazinium sulfate and chlorosulfonic acid in pyridine leads to the pyridinium salt of the hydrazine disulfonate anion, [(SO3)HNNH(SO3)]2&#8722;. The salt is the starting material for the preparation of further hydrazine disulfonates, for example of alkaline metals and barium. In all compounds, the [(SO3)HNNH(SO3)]2&#8722; anion adopts the gauche conformation. The conformer is chiral but all of the investigated compounds crystallize as racemates. The disulfonate anion can occur in another constitution with the two sulfonate groups attached to only one nitrogen atom. This so&#8208;called hydrazine iso&#8208;disulfonate, [H2NN(SO3)2]2&#8722;, has been prepared through a substitution reaction between potassium imidodisulfonate, K[HN(SO3)2], and hydroxylamine&#8208;O&#8208;sulfonic acid, H2NOSO3H. The hydrazine iso&#8208;disulfonate anion has been crystallized as potassium and barium compound, respectively. The compounds were characterized by XRD, vibrational spectroscopy, DFT calculations and thermal analyses.</dc:description>

         <title>Glycerol as Reaction Medium for Sonogashira Couplings: A Green Approach for the Synthesis of New Triarylamine&#8208;Based Materials with Potential Application in Optoelectronics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study focuses on the design, eco&#8208;friendly synthesis, and characterization of several novel three&#8208;legged triphenylamine derivatives. By performing Sonogashira couplings of functionalized aryl iodides with tris(4&#8208;ethynylphenyl)amine in glycerol, a readily available bio&#8208;derived solvent, we achieved the synthesis of target products in short times and high yields, up to 94%, with consistently lower E&#8208;factors and reduced costs compared to standard conditions using toluene as the reaction medium. The target molecules possess a D&#8208;(&#960;&#8208;A)&#8323; or D&#8208;(&#960;&#8208;D)&#8323; structure, where an electron&#8208;donating core connects to three electron&#8208;donating (D) or electron&#8208;accepting (A) peripheral aromatic subunits through an acetylene spacer. Their main optical and electronic properties have been determined experimentally and by DFT simulations and suggest a possible implementation in energy conversion technologies such as luminescent solar concentrators (LSCs) and perovskite solar cells (PSCs).</dc:description>

         <title>Ambiguous Faces of Water&#8208;Based Inclusion Compounds: L4(4)8(8) Intercalato&#8208;Clathrate Hydrate of Pt(II) Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 47, August 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reported Pt(II) complex encapsulated by intercalated water layers of L4(4)8(8) topology forms intercalato&#8208;clathrate. Its comparison to similar water&#8208;based inclusion compounds allowed to suggest parameters (e.&#8201;g. h&#8208;corrugation height; Nvol&#8208; volumetric corrugation density) characterizing the corrugation of individual layers. Intra&#8208;water energies define particular water systems as confined or confining mediums.







Abstract
Clathrate hydrates are among the most intensively studied H&#8208;bond inclusion compounds. Despite the broad definition for this class of compounds, their meaning commonly refers to closed polyhedral nanocages that encapsulate small guest molecules. On the other hand, larger solutes enforce another type of encapsulation because of the solute size effect. Herein, we report a series of structures containing various molecules encapsulated by intercalated water layers constructed of polycyclic moieties of L4(4)8(8) topology. We parametrized the corrugation of individual layers and characterized interactions governing their formation. We suggested that these could be categorized as two&#8208;dimensional clathrates based on the character of intra&#8208;layer interactions and the effects observed between entrapped molecules and water&#8208;based intercalators.

         <title>Functionalization of Alginate Hydrogels with a Multifunctional Peptide Supports Mesenchymal Stem Cell Adhesion and Reduces Bacterial Colonization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 47, August 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work we report on the functionalization of an alginate hydrogel with a tailor&#8208;made multifunctional peptide containing the cell adhesive RGD motif and the LF1&#8211;11 antibacterial peptide. Such novel multifunctional biomaterial ensures the viability of human mesenchymal stem cells, enhances ALP activity and decreases bacterial infections of both Gram&#8208;positive and Gram&#8208;negative models.







Abstract
Hydrogels with cell adhesive moieties stand out as promising materials to enhance tissue healing and regeneration. Nonetheless, bacterial infections of the implants represent an unmet major concern. In the present work, we developed an alginate hydrogel modified with a multifunctional peptide containing the RGD cell adhesive motif in combination with an antibacterial peptide derived from the 1&#8211;11 region of lactoferrin (LF). The RGD&#8208;LF branched peptide was successfully anchored to the alginate backbone by carbodiimide chemistry, as demonstrated by 1H NMR and fluorescence measurements. The functionalized hydrogel presented desirable physicochemical properties (porosity, swelling and rheological behavior) to develop biomaterials for tissue engineering. The viability of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) on the peptide&#8208;functionalized hydrogels was excellent, with values higher than 85&#8201;% at day 1, and higher than 95&#8201;% after 14&#8197;days in culture. Moreover, the biological characterization demonstrated the ability of the hydrogels to significantly enhance ALP activity of MSCs as well as to decrease bacterial colonization of both Gram&#8208;positive and Gram&#8208;negative models. Such results prove the potential of the functionalized hydrogels as novel biomaterials for tissue engineering, simultaneously displaying cell adhesive activity and the capacity to prevent bacterial contamination, a dual bioactivity commonly not found for these types of hydrogels.

         <title>Bridging Dehydrogenation and Hydrogenation in Heterogeneous Catalysis: A Demonstration of a Unified Catalytic Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 47, August 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The research showcases the dual dehydrogenation and hydrogenation capabilities of an innovative hybrid catalyst, illustrated through the cyclooctane&#8722;cyclooctene model. This hybrid catalyst combines a pincer iridium complex with Pd&#8722;Ru heterostructures, both supported on solid &#947;&#8208;alumina, serving as a compelling proof of concept for tandem dehydrogenation&#8208;hydrogenation processes.







Abstract
In the pursuit of enhancing the applications of hydrogen as an energy carrier, this research delved into the utilization of a singular hybrid catalyst capable of performing both dehydrogenation and hydrogenation processes for Liquid Organic Hydrogen Carriers (LOHCs). This study presents the synthesis and characterization of a hybrid catalyst, combining an organometallic pincer complex with Pd&#8722;Ru heterostructures supported on &#947;&#8208;alumina. Unlike conventional transition and noble metal nanoparticles, the use of a pincer complex offers exceptional thermal stability due to its aryl backbone, which is advantageous for various endothermic dehydrogenation reactions of hydrocarbons in LOHCs. This pioneering hybrid catalyst is a novel approach, demonstrating a proof of concept. In this study, we utilized the hybrid catalyst to investigate the dehydrogenation and hydrogenation of a lower enthalpic system, specifically the cyclooctane&#8722;cyclooctene system. The dehydrogenation of cyclooctane was conducted at 443&#8197;K using tertiary butyl ethylene as a sacrificial hydrogen acceptor, while the hydrogenation of cyclooctene reaction catalyzed by Pd&#8722;Ru nanostructures occurred at 298&#8197;K and 1&#8197;atm H2. The results showed successful tandem dehydrogenation&#8208;hydrogenation reactions. However, challenges were noted in terms of catalytic activity and recyclability, providing valuable insights for further refinement and optimization.

         <title>Synthesis, Characterization and Energetic Properties of Hydroxymethyl&#8208;Bishomocubanone Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 47, August 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bishomocubane based energetic materials were designed, synthesized and evaluated for their applications in novel propellant formulations in rocket propulsion. Various performance parameters were assessed based on TGA&#8208;DTG analysis, BDEs, HOMO&#8208;LUMO energy gaps, ESP maps and impact sensitivity (h50). Three derivatives were found to be potential candidates with excellent ballistic performance and good stability for volume limited applications.







Abstract
The present work reports synthesis, characterization and theoretical insights on novel hydroxymethyl&#8208;bishomocubanone derivatives. Twelve new bishomocubanes (BHCs) were synthesized and fully characterized by various spectroscopic techniques and single crystal X&#8208;ray analysis. The densities of the title compounds were in the range of 1.30&#8211;1.59&#8197;g/cm3. Density&#8208;functional theory (DFT) based calculations at B3LYP/6&#8208;311++G(d,p) level of theory were performed on ten selected BHC based cage compounds. Propulsive and ballistic properties of newly synthesized hydroxymethyl&#8208;bishomocubanone derivatives in solid and liquid propulsion systems were calculated, and the results suggested that these compounds are superior to conventional fuel RP1 and binder HTPB. The detonation parameters revealed that these compounds are not explosive in nature and safe to use as solid propellants. Furthermore, kinetic and thermal stabilities of the title compounds were determined by HOMO&#8208;LUMO energy gap, ESP maps, impact sensitivity (h50) and bond dissociation energies (BDEs) followed by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential thermal analysis (DTA). Three compounds, a dinitroazide (Isp,vac=310.98&#8197;s), a dinitrate (Isp,vac=309.51&#8197;s), and a dinitronitrate (Isp,vac=309.20s) were found to be excellent candidates for volume limited applications.

         <title>Self&#8208;immolative Polymer Hydrogels via In Situ Gelation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 47, August 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Water&#8208;soluble self&#8208;immolative polyglyoxylamides were synthesized with cross&#8208;linkable pendent azides. They were then cross&#8208;linked by copper&#8208;assisted or strain&#8208;promoted azide&#8208;alkyne click cycloadditions to form hydrogels that could be depolymerized on demand.







Abstract
Hydrogels are of interest for a wide range of applications. The ability to control when the hydrogel degrades can provide beneficial properties such as controlled degradation in the environment or the stimulated release of drugs or cells. Self&#8208;immolative polymers are a class of degradable polymers that undergo complete end&#8208;to&#8208;end depolymerization upon the application of a stimulus. They have been explored for hydrogel development, but the ability to prepare and selectively degrade self&#8208;immolative hydrogels under neutral aqueous conditions has so far been limited. We describe here the preparation of water&#8208;soluble polyglyoxylamides with cross&#8208;linkable pendent azides and their cross&#8208;linking to form hydrogels with 4&#8208;arm poly(ethylene glycol)s having unstrained and strained alkynes using copper&#8208;assisted and strain&#8208;promoted azide&#8208;alkyne click chemistry respectively. The influence of pendent azide density and solution polymer content on the resulting hydrogels was evaluated. A polyglyoxylamide with a 70&#8201;:&#8201;30 ratio of pendent hydroxyl:azide successfully provided hydrogels with compressive moduli ranging from 1.3&#8211;6.3&#8197;kPa under copper&#8208;free conditions at 10&#8211;20&#8201;% (w/w) of polymer in phosphate&#8208;buffered saline. Selective depolymerization and degradation of the hydrogels upon irradiation with light was demonstrated, resulting in reductions in the compressive moduli and the release of depolymerization products that were detected by NMR spectroscopy.

         <title>Precisely Designed Ultra&#8208;Small CoP Nanoparticles&#8208;Decorated Hollow Carbon Nanospheres as Highly Efficient Host in Lithium&#8722;Sulfur Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
Precisely controlling the size of transition metal phosphides (TMPs) is crucial for the development of TMPs&#8208;based efficient host materials for Li&#8722;S batteries. With the help of the spherical polyelectrolyte brush (SPB), ultra&#8208;small CoP nanoparticle&#8208;decorated hollow carbon nanospheres (CoP@C) were synthesized. The CoP@C/S electrode delivered a stable specific discharge capacity due to the suppressed &#8216;&#8216;shuttle&#8217;&#8217; effect and fast reaction kinetics.







Abstract
Designing porous carbon materials with metal phosphides as host materials holds promise for enhancing the cyclability and durability of lithium&#8722;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) batteries by mitigating sulfur poisoning and exhibiting high electrocatalytic activity. Nevertheless, it is urgent to precisely control the size of metal phosphides to further optimize the polysulfide conversion reaction kinetics of Li&#8722;S batteries. Herein, a subtlety regulation strategy was proposed to obtain ultra&#8208;small CoP nanoparticles&#8208;decorated hollow carbon nanospheres (CoP@C) by using spherical polyelectrolyte brush (SPB) as the template with stabilizing assistance from polydopamine coating, which also works as carbon source. Leveraging the electrostatic interaction between SPB and Co2+, ultra&#8208;small Co particles with sizes measuring 5.5&#177;2.6&#8197;nm were endowed after calcination. Subsequently, through a gas&#8208;solid phosphating process, these Co particles were converted into CoP nanoparticles with significantly finer sizes (7.1&#177;3.1&#8197;nm) compared to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art approaches. By uniformly distributing the electrocatalyst nanoparticles on hollow carbon nanospheres, CoP@C facilitated the acceleration of Li&#8208;ion diffusion and enhanced the conversion reaction kinetics of polysulfides through adsorption&#8208;diffusion synergy. As a result, Li&#8722;S batteries utilizing the CoP@C/S cathode demonstrated an initial specific discharge capacity of 850.0&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1.0&#8201;C, with a low&#8208;capacity decay rate of 0.03&#8201;% per cycle.

         <title>Semi&#8208;Interpenetrating Polymer Network Anion Exchange Membranes Based on Quaternized Polybenzoxazine and Poly(Vinyl Alcohol&#8208;Co&#8208;Ethylene) for Acid Recovery by Diffusion Dialysis</title>

Semi&#8208;IPN AEMs are prepared by ring&#8208;open cross&#8208;linked quaternized polybenzoxazine with poly(vinyl alcohol&#8208;co&#8208;ethylene) exhibted excellent dimensional stability, high oxidation stability, good acid dialysis coefficient (UH+) and high separation factor (S).







Abstract
Acid recovery from acidic waste is a pressing issue in current times. Chemical methods for recovery are not economically feasible and require significant energy input to save the environment. This study reported a semi&#8208;interpenetrating polymer network (semi&#8208;IPN) anion exchange membranes (AEMs) for acid recovery by diffusion dialysis with excellent dimensional stability, high oxidation stability, good acid dialysis coefficient (UH+) and high separation factor (S). Semi&#8208;IPN AEMs are prepared by ring&#8208;open cross&#8208;linked quaternized polybenzoxazine (AQBZ) with poly(vinyl alcohol&#8208;co&#8208;ethylene), where AQBZ is obtained by Mannich reaction and Menshutkin reaction. All four proportions of semi&#8208;IPNs exhibit clear micro&#8208;phase separation, which is conducive to ion transport. The water uptake (WU) of the four semi&#8208;IPNs ranges from 14.2&#8201;% to 19.2&#8201;%, while the swelling ratio (SR) remains between 8.7&#8201;% and 11.3&#8201;%. These results indicate that the cross&#8208;linked structure in the designed semi&#8208;IPNs effectively control swelling and ensure dimensional stability. The thermal degradation temperature (Td5) of semi&#8208;IPN4:6 to semi&#8208;IPN7:3 varies from 309&#8201;&#176;C to 289&#8201;&#176;C, with an oxidation stability weight loss rate (WOX) ranging from 91.5&#8201;% to 93.5&#8201;%, demonstrating excellent thermal stability and oxidation stability. The semi&#8208;IPNs also show good UH+ values ranging from 11.9&#8211;16.3*10&#8722;3&#8197;m/h and high S values between 38.6 and 45.9, indicating the promising potential of the semi&#8208;IPNs.

         <title>Hydrosilylation of Arynes with Silanes and Silicon&#8208;Based Polymer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 47, August 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Various silanes as well as organosilicon polymer PHMS can react smoothly with HDDA&#8208;derived benzyne to give the arylation products. Lewis acid such as boron trifluoride etherate can accelerate these hydrosilylation reactions. Mechanism research showed that the hydrosililation reaction probably underwent a synergistic pathway.







Abstract
Benzyne derived from hexadehydrogenated Diels Alder (HDDA) reactions was found to be an efficient hydrosilylation acceptors. Various silanes can react smoothly with HDDA&#8208;derived benzyne to give the arylation products. Lewis acid such as boron trifluoride etherate can accelerate these hydrosilylation reactions. Polyhydromethylsiloxane (PHMS), a widely used organosilicon polymer, was also successfully modified using our method. About 5&#8201;% of Si&#8722;H bonds in the polymer were inserted by benzynes, giving a functional PHMS with much more solubility in methanol and with a blue&#8208;emitting fluorescence behavior. Mechanism research shows that the insertion of benzyne into the Si&#8722;H bond probably undergoes a synergistic pathway, which is quite different from the traditional radical&#8208;initiated hydrosilylation or transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed hydrosilylation.

         <title>Pyridinethiolate&#8208;Capped CdSe Quantum Dots for Red&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven H2 Production in Water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 47, August 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper describes the first example of metal chalcogenide quantum dots that show the feasibility of harvesting red&#8208;light for H2 production. The noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free system lasts over 240&#8197;hour and realizes a turnover number of 43910. Triplet quantum yield of quantum dot is a key factor promoting the catalysis.







Abstract
The utilization of low&#8208;energy sunlight to produce renewable fuels is a subject of great interest. Here we report the first example of metal chalcogenide quantum dots (QDs) capped with a pyridinethiolate carboxylic acid (pyS&#8208;COOH) for red&#8208;light&#8208;driven H2 production in water. The precious&#8208;metal&#8208;free system is robust over 240&#8197;h, and achieves a turnover number (TON) of 43910&#177;305 (vs Ni) with a rate of 31570&#177;1690&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 for hydrogen production. In contrast to the inactive QDs capped with other thiolate ligands, the CdSe&#8208;pyS&#8208;COOH QDs give a significantly higher singlet oxygen quantum yield [&#934;&#916; (1O2)] in solution.

         <title>Oxygen&#8208;Promoted on&#8208;Surface Synthesis of Polyboroxine Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 47, August 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The on&#8208;surface formation of a novel B&#8722;O&#8722;B bond is promoted by oxygen atoms on the Au(111) surface upon breaking of the B&#8722;C bond in tri&#8208;naphthyl boroxine molecules. As a result, the synthesis of polyboroxine species is obtained and monitored by X&#8208;ray core spectroscopy.







Abstract
We present a protocol for the on&#8208;surface synthesis of polyboroxine molecules derived from boroxine molecules precursors. This process is promoted by oxygen species present on the Au(111) surface: oxygen atoms facilitate the detachment of naphthalene units of trinaphthyl&#8208;boroxine molecules and bridge two unsaturated boroxine centers to form a boroxine&#8208;O&#8208;boroxine chemical motif. X&#8208;ray spectroscopic characterization shows that, as the synthesis process proceeds, it progressively tunes the electronic properties of the interface, thus providing a promising route to control the electron level alignment.

         <title>Dual pH and Ca2+&#8208;Responsive PEG&#8208;Modified Pillar[5]arene&#8208;Based Supramolecular Nanodrug Delivery System: Excellent Cargo Encapsulation and Minimal Drug Toxicity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 47, August 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pillar[5]arene&#8208;based nano&#8208;drug carrier WP5&#8835;EV has been formed by host&#8208;guest assembly. The carrier shows excellent cargo encapsulation properties and effectively prolongs the half&#8208;life and bioavailability of the drug. Importantly, WP5&#8835;EV can minimize the toxicity of the drug and enhance the antitumor activity.







Abstract
Chemotherapy is one of the most employed strategies in clinical treatment of cancer. However, reducing medication adverse effects and improving the biological activity remains a significant issue for chemotherapy. We developed a pH and Ca2+&#8208;responsive pillar[5]arene&#8208;based supramolecular nanodrug delivery system (NDDS) WP5&#8835;EV@DOX to address the aforementioned challenges. The formation of this NDDS began with the spontaneous formation of supramolecular nanodrug carrier WP5&#8835;EV in water from PEG&#8208;modified pillar[5]arene and the bipyridilium salt derivative EV through simple host&#8208;guest interaction. Then the antitumor drug doxorubicin DOX was efficiently loaded with a high encapsulation rate of 84.6&#8201;%. Cytotoxicity results indicated that the constructed nanoplatform not only reduced DOX toxicity and side effects on normal cell (293T), but also significantly enhanced the antitumor activity on cancer cell (HepG2). Moreover, in&#8197;vivo experiments showed that WP5&#8835;EV@DOX had a longer half&#8208;life and higher bioavailability in the blood of mice compared to the nake drug DOX, with increases to 212&#8201;% and 179&#8201;%, respectively. Therefore, WP5&#8835;EV@DOX has great potential in tumor therapy and provides a new idea for host&#8208;guest drug delivery system.

         <dc:description>
The Ni&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective addition of aryl halides to aldehydes has been studied with cyanobis(oxazoline) as chiral ligands and Mn as reductant. Aryl and heteroaryl bromides react with phenyl aldehyde to produce dibenzyl alcohols in 16&#8211;99&#8201;% yields with 53&#8211;92&#8201;% ees. Morever, phenyl chloride with aryl, heteroaryl and alkyl aldehydes synthesize dibenzyl alcohols in high yields with moderate enantioselectivities.







Abstract
The Ni&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective addition reaction of aryl halides to aldehydes was studied with cyanobis(oxazoline) as chiral ligands and Mn as reductant. Aryl and heteroaryl bromides reacted with phenyl aldehyde at room temperature to produce dibenzyl alcohols in 16&#8211;99&#8201;% yields with 53&#8211;92&#8201;% ees. Moreover, the coupling of phenyl chloride with a variety of aryl, heteroaryl and alkyl aldehydes was demonstrated in the presence of cyanobis(oxazoline)/Ni(II) at 60&#8201;&#176;C in generally high yields with moderate enantioselectivities.

The reaction was accompanied by a contraction of the triselenole ring to the diselenete ring. The substrate, dicyanobenzo[1,2,3]triselenole, was prepared by a new procedure via a photolytic demethylenation reaction of 3,7&#8208;diethyl[1,3]diselenolophthalonitrile using a 10&#8197;W white LED light. While triselenolosubphthalocyanine was treated by triphenylphosphine to give the diselenete derivative, the reaction of diselenetosubphthalocyanine with Woolion's reagent produced the expanded triselenole ring. The diselenete derivative reacted with tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)platinum to yield the corresponding platinum complex with Se&#8722;Pt bonds. Q&#8208;band absorption for the products appeared at around &#955;max=590&#8197;nm in the UV&#8208;vis spectrum and weak emission was observed at about &#955;e=620&#8197;nm. When diselenetosubphthalocyanine was treated with pentachloro antimonate in dichloromethane or sodium metal in hexane/tetrahydrofuran, the solution showed strong ESR signals. The structures of model compounds were optimized using the DFT method with the Gaussian 09 program at the B3LYP/6&#8208;31G (d, p) level.

         <title>Co(II) Macrocyclic Complexes with Amide&#8208;Glycinate Pendants as ParaCEST and Liposomal CEST Agents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 47, August 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Macrocyclic Co(II) complexes with appended amide&#8208;glycinate groups are paramagnetic chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) agents with highly shifted and intense CEST peaks due, in part, to the trans&#8208;orientation about the amide C&#8722;N bond. These Co(II) paramagnetic shift agents have reduced overall charge for higher loading into liposomes for lipoCEST studies.







Abstract
Macrocyclic Co(II) complexes with appended amide&#8208;glycinate groups were prepared to develop paramagnetic Co(II) chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) agents of reduced overall charge. Complexes with reduced charge and lowered osmolarity are important for their loading into liposomes and to provide complexes that are highly water soluble and well tolerated in animals. Co(L1) has two non&#8208;coordinating benzyl groups and two amide&#8208;glycinate pendants, whereas Co(L2) has two unsubstituted amide pendants and two amide&#8208;glycinate pendants on cyclam (1,4,8,11&#8208;tetraazacyclododecane). The 1H NMR spectrum of Co(L1) is consistent with a single cis&#8208;pendant isomer with both amide protons in the trans&#8208;configuration, as supported by an X&#8208;ray crystal structure. Co(L2) has a mixture of different isomers in solution, including the trans&#8208;1,4 and 1,8 pendant isomers. The Z&#8208;spectrum of Co(L1) shows one highly&#8208;shifted CEST peak, whereas Co(L2) exhibits six CEST peaks. Encapsulation of 40&#8197;mM Co(L1) in a liposome with osmotically&#8208;induced shrinking at 300 mOsm/L produces a liposomal CEST agent with saturation frequency offset of 3&#8197;ppm.

     alt="Co(II) Macrocyclic Complexes with Amide-Glycinate Pendants as ParaCEST and Liposomal CEST Agents"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Macrocyclic Co(II) complexes with appended amide-glycinate groups are paramagnetic chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) agents with highly shifted and intense CEST peaks due, in part, to the &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-orientation about the amide C&#8722;N bond. These Co(II) paramagnetic shift agents have reduced overall charge for higher loading into liposomes for lipoCEST studies.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Macrocyclic Co(II) complexes with appended amide-glycinate groups were prepared to develop paramagnetic Co(II) chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) agents of reduced overall charge. Complexes with reduced charge and lowered osmolarity are important for their loading into liposomes and to provide complexes that are highly water soluble and well tolerated in animals. Co(L1) has two non-coordinating benzyl groups and two amide-glycinate pendants, whereas Co(L2) has two unsubstituted amide pendants and two amide-glycinate pendants on cyclam (1,4,8,11-tetraazacyclododecane). The &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H NMR spectrum of Co(L1) is consistent with a single &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-pendant isomer with both amide protons in the &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-configuration, as supported by an X-ray crystal structure. Co(L2) has a mixture of different isomers in solution, including the &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-1,4 and 1,8 pendant isomers. The Z-spectrum of Co(L1) shows one highly-shifted CEST peak, whereas Co(L2) exhibits six CEST peaks. Encapsulation of 40&#8197;mM Co(L1) in a liposome with osmotically-induced shrinking at 300 mOsm/L produces a liposomal CEST agent with saturation frequency offset of 3&#8197;ppm. Addition of the amphiphilic 1,4,7-triazacyclononane-based complex Co(L5) to the liposomal bilayer at 18&#8197;mM with Co(L1) encapsulated in the liposome at 50&#8197;mM changes the sign and increases the magnitude of the saturation frequency offset to &#8722;7.5&#8197;ppm at 300 mOsm/L.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

MOFs are good precursors for active mixed&#8208;metal oxide/hydroxide electrocatalysts, with a uniform distribution of metals at the nanoscale. The catalytic properties of materials from monometallic Ni&#8208;, Co&#8208; and Zn&#8208;MOFs and bimetallic NiCo&#8208;, NiZn&#8208; and CoZn&#8208;MOFs with benzene&#8208;1,4&#8208;dicarboxylate (BDC) and 1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO) are investigated in direct comparison. A MOF nanosheet was for the first time obtained on Ni foam through microwave&#8208;heating.







Abstract
Herein, a series of monometallic Ni&#8208;, Co&#8208; and Zn&#8208;MOFs and bimetallic NiCo&#8208;, NiZn&#8208; and CoZn&#8208;MOFs of formula M2(BDC)2DABCO and (M,M&#8217;)2(BDC)2DABCO, respectively, (M, M&#8217;=metal) with the same pillar and layer linkers 1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO) and benzene&#8208;1,4&#8208;dicarboxylate (BDC) were prepared through a fast microwave&#8208;assisted thermal conversion synthesis method (MW) within only 12&#8197;min. In the bimetallic MOFs the ratio M:M&#8217; was 4&#8201;:&#8201;1. The mono&#8208; and bimetallic MOFs were selected to systematically explore the catalytic&#8208;activity of their derived metal oxide/hydroxides for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Among all tested bimetallic MOF&#8208;derived catalysts, the NiCoMOF exhibits superior catalytic activity for the OER with the lowest overpotentials of 301&#8197;mV and Tafel slopes of 42&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1 on a rotating disk glassy carbon electrode (RD&#8208;GCE) in 1&#8197;mol&#8201;L&#8722;1 KOH electrolyte at a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. In addition, NiCoMOF was insitu grown in just 25&#8197;min by the MW synthesis on the surface of nickel foam (NF) with, for example, a mass loading of 16.6 mgMOF/gNF, where overpotentials of 313 and 328&#8197;mV at current densities of 50 and 300&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, respectively, were delivered and superior long&#8208;term stability for practical OER application. The low Tafel slope of 27&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1, as well as a low reaction resistance from electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurement (Rfar=2 &#937;), confirm the excellent OER performance of this NiCoMOF/NF composite. During the electrocatalytic processes or even before upon KOH pre&#8208;treatment, the MOFs are transformed to the mixed&#8208;metal hydroxide phase &#945;&#8208;/&#946;&#8208;M(OH)2 which presents the active species in the reactions (turnover frequency TOF=0.252&#8197;s&#8722;1 at an overpotential of 320&#8197;mV). Compared to the TOF from &#946;&#8208;M(OH)2 (0.002&#8197;s&#8722;1), our study demonstrates that a bimetallic MOF improves the electrocatalytic performance of the derived catalyst by giving an intimate and uniform mixture of the involved metals at the nanoscale.

         <title>Direct Access to Benzolactams and Benzolactones via Nickel Catalyzed Carbonylation with CO2</title>

Lactams and lactones are obtained in convenient manner via Ni&#8208;catalyzed carbonylation reaction with CO2. The cross&#8208;electrophile coupling engages AlCl3 as a key additive and its multiple roles are elucidated via a dedicated computational investigation.







Abstract
A new nickel catalyzed cross&#8208;electrophile coupling for accessing &#947;&#8208;lactams (isoindolinones) as well as &#947;&#8208;lactones (isobenzofuranones) via carbonylation with CO2 is documented. The protocol exploits the synergistic role of redox&#8208;active Ni(II) complexes and AlCl3 as a CO2 activator/oxygen scavenger, leading to the formation of a wide range of cyclic amides and esters (28 examples) in good to high yields (up to 87&#8201;%). A dedicated computational investigation revealed the multiple roles played by AlCl3. In particular, the simultaneous transient protection of the pendant amino group of the starting reagents and the formation of the electrophilically activated CO2&#8208;AlCl3 adduct are shown to concur in paving the way for an energetically favorable mechanistic pathway.

         <title>Cation&#8208;Stacking Approach Enabling Interconversion between Bis(xanthylium) and its Reduced Species</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 47, August 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the newly designed cyclophane&#8208;type dications, the xanthylium units facing each other exert attractive rather than repulsive effects, even though there is electrostatic repulsion between cation units. Due to an intramolecular interaction caused by &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking, not only the dications but also their reduced species can be stabilized. Thus, stepwise redox interconversion was achieved via radical cation species.







Abstract
Cyclophane&#8208;type dications with two units of xanthylium were designed, with the expectation that intramolecular interaction between cation units could induce changes in absorption and redox behavior. The desired dications were synthesized via the macrocyclic diketone as a key intermediate, which was efficiently obtained by a stepwise etherification. X&#8208;ray and UV/Vis measurements revealed that the cyclophane&#8208;type dications adopt a stacking structure in both the crystal and solution. Due to the intramolecular interaction caused by &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking of the xanthylium units, a considerable blue shift compared to the corresponding monocations and a two&#8208;stage one&#8208;electron reduction process were observed in the dications. Furthermore, upon electrochemical reduction of dications, the formation of biradicals via radical cation species was demonstrated by UV/Vis spectroscopy with several isosbestic points at both stages. Therefore, the cation&#8208;stacking approach is a promising way to provide novel properties due to perturbation of their molecular orbitals and to stabilize the reduced species even though they have open&#8208;shell characters.

The synthesis of the protein conjugates of Haemophilus influenzae type a (Hia) capsular polysaccharide oligomers is reported. The obtained neoglycoconjugates, comprising from one to five well&#8208;defined disaccharide repeating units, were employed in immunization studies, showing their ability to induce a specific immune response.







Abstract
Glycoconjugate vaccines are based on chemical conjugation of pathogen&#8208;associated carbohydrates with immunogenic carrier proteins and are considered a very cost&#8208;effective way to prevent infections. Most of the licensed glycoconjugate vaccines are composed of saccharide antigens extracted from bacterial sources. However, synthetic oligosaccharide antigens have become a promising alternative to natural polysaccharides with the advantage of being well&#8208;defined structures providing homogeneous conjugates. Haemophilus influenzae (Hi) is responsible for a number of severe diseases. In recent years, an increasing rate of invasive infections caused by Hi serotype a (Hia) raised some concern, because no vaccine targeting Hia is currently available. The capsular polysaccharide (CPS) of Hia is constituted by phosphodiester&#8208;linked 4&#8208;&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;glucose&#8208;(1&#8594;4)&#8208;d&#8208;ribitol&#8208;5&#8208;(PO4&#8594;) repeating units and is the antigen for protein&#8208;conjugated polysaccharide vaccines. To investigate the antigenic potential of the CPS from Hia, we synthesized related saccharide fragments containing up to five repeating units. Following the synthetic optimization of the needed disaccharide building blocks, they were assembled using the phosphoramidite approach for the installation of the phosphodiester linkages. The resulting CPS&#8208;based Hia oligomers were conjugated to CRM197 carrier protein and evaluated in&#8197;vivo for their immunogenic potential, showing that all glycoconjugates were capable of raising antibodies recognizing Hia synthetic fragments.

         <title>Designing Cobalt(II) Complex for Chemoselective Synthesis of 2&#8208;Aryl&#8208;3&#8208;Formyl Indoles from Amino Alcohols and Alcohols&#8224;</title>

This report describes synthesis of an cobalt (II) complex (C1) of N&#8208;((1&#8208;methyl&#8208;1H&#8208;imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)methyl)&#8208;2&#8208;(phenylselanyl)ethan amine (L1). The cobalt complex was used as catalyst for a one&#8208;pot cascade reaction between 2&#8208;(2&#8208;aminoaryl)ethanols and benzyl alcohols. Interestingly, chemoselective formation of 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;3&#8208;formylindoles was observed instead of N&#8208;alkylated or C&#8208;3 alkylated indoles which was observed in earlier reports. The mechanistic studies suggest that the reaction proceeds through tandem imine formation followed by the cyclization.







Abstract
An air&#8208;stable, inexpensive, and isolable cobalt(II) complex (C1) of N&#8208;((1&#8208;methyl&#8208;1H&#8208;imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)methyl)&#8208;2&#8208;(phenylselanyl)ethan amine (L1) was synthesized and characterized. The complex was used to catalyze a one&#8208;pot cascade reaction between 2&#8208;(2&#8208;aminophenyl)ethanols and benzyl alcohol derivatives. Interestingly, 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;3&#8208;formylindole derivatives were formed instead of N&#8208;alkylated or C&#8208;3 alkylated indoles. A broad substrate scope can be activated using this protocol with only 5.0&#8197;mol&#8201;% catalyst loading to achieve up to 87&#8201;% yield of 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;3&#8208;formylindole derivatives.

         <title>Chromium Complexes with Benzanellated N&#8208;Heterocyclic Phosphenium Ligands&#8211;Synthesis, Reactivity and Application in Catalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 47, August 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benzanellation of the N&#8208;heterocyclic phosphenium (NHP) ligands in chromium complexes has impact on their reactivity, facilitating reduction to a radical anion, hydrogenation to a &#963;&#8208;H2&#8208;complex, and Cr&#8208;to&#8208;P hydride mobility in a NHP&#8208;phosphine&#8208;hydride&#8208;complex formed by isomerization of the H2&#8208;complex. The latter reduces CO2 with formation of a formato complex, which is a key to mediate the transfer hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol with NH3BH3.







Abstract
A chromium complex carrying two benzanellated N&#8208;heterocyclic phosphenium (bzNHP) ligands was prepared by a salt metathesis approach. Spectroscopic studies suggest that the anellation enhances the &#960;&#8208;acceptor ability of the NHP&#8208;units, which is confirmed by the facile electrochemical reduction of the complex to a spectroscopically characterized radical anion. Co&#8208;photolysis with H2 allowed extensive conversion into a &#963;&#8208;H2&#8208;complex, which shows a diverse reactivity towards donors and isomerizes under H&#8722;H bond fission and shift of a hydride to a P&#8208;ligand. The product carrying phosphenium, phosphine and hydride ligands was also synthesized independently and reacts reversibly with CO and MeCN to yield bis&#8208;phosphine complexes under concomitant Cr&#8208;to&#8208;P&#8208;shift of a hydride. In contrast, CO2 was not only bound but reduced to give an isolable formato complex, which reacted with ammonia borane under partial recovery of the metal hydride and production of formate. Further elaboration of the reactions of the chromium complexes with CO2 and NH3BH3 allowed to demonstrate the feasibility of a Cr&#8208;catalyzed transfer hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol. The various complexes described were characterized spectroscopically and in several cases by XRD studies. Further insights in reactivity patterns were provided through (spectro)electrochemical studies and DFT calculations.

         <title>Spatially Resolved Multicolor Luminescence Tuning on the Single 1D Heterogeneous Microrod</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 47, August 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spatially resolved 1D heterogeneous microrods that emit variable emission on demand in response to excitation pulse width were developed. This kind of well&#8208;designed 1D heterogeneous microrods can carry a variety of optical features and show great potential in fabricating unclonable anti&#8208;counterfeiting tags.







Abstract
The spatially resolvable multicolored microrods have potential applications in many fields. However, achieving spatially resolved multicolor luminescence tuning on the microrod with a fixed composition remains a daunting challenge. Herein, a strategy is proposed that allows for the tuning of spatially resolved, multicolored upconversion (UC) luminescence (UCL) along a 1D heterogeneous microrod by modifying the pulse width of an external laser. NaYbF4:1&#8201;% Ho is identified as an UCL color&#8208;adjustable material, exhibiting pulse width&#8208;dependent multicolored UCL, resulting in a significant regulation of the red/green (R/G) ratio from 0.1 to 10.3 as the pulse width is varied from 0.1 to 10&#8197;ms. Such variability can be ascribed to differences in the number of photons incident upon the microrod throughout the period necessary for the UC process to occur. Additionally, NaYbF4:1&#8201;%Tm and NaYF4:20&#8201;%Yb,1&#8201;%Ho are employed as materials that emit blue and green light, respectively, with their UCL colors largely unaffected by changes in the pulse width. Subsequently, a tip&#8208;modified epitaxial growth method is utilized to integrate both UCL color&#8208;adjustable and non&#8208;adjustable segments within the same microrod. Comparing with single&#8208;color or fixed multicolor microrods, our developed multisegmented emissive color adjustable 1D heterogeneous microrods have unique optical characteristics and can carry more optical information.

         <title>A Simply Synthesized Shaking&#8208;induced Small Molecule System with Repeatable and Instantaneous Discoloration Response</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 47, August 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simply&#8208;synthesized small molecule solution system with repeatable and instantaneous force&#8208;related discoloration response (from yellowish to dark green) is attributed to accelerated generation of ortho&#8208;OH phenoxyl radical under shaking.







Abstract
Force&#8208;related discoloration materials are highly valuable because of their characteristics of visualization, easy operation, and environment friendliness. Most force&#8208;related discoloration materials focus on polymers and depend on bond scission, which leads to insensitivity and unrecoverable. Small&#8208;molecule systems based on well&#8208;defined molecular structures and simple composition with high sensitivity would exhibit considerable mechanochromic potential. However, to date, researches about force&#8208;related discoloration materials based on small molecule solution remain limited and are rarely reported. In this study, we developed a repeatable and instantaneous discoloration small molecule solution system by simple one&#8208;pot synthesis method. It exhibited an instantaneous chromic change from yellowish to dark green under shaking and reverting back to yellow within 1&#8197;minute after removal of the shaking. Experimental results confirmed that the discoloration mechanism is attributed to the oscillation accelerating the production of unstable ortho&#8208;OH phenoxyl radical. The newly developed shaking&#8208;induced discoloration small molecule system (SDSMS) promises in field of mechanical force sensing and optical encryption.

One&#8208;pot hydrothermal strategy is developed to produce rGO/MXene/sulfur composite aerogels where sulfur is in&#8197;situ trapped in the 3D rGO/MXene conductive skeleton. The optimized composite aerogels as free&#8208;standing cathodes delivery a specific capacity of 951&#8197;mAhg&#8722;1 after 100 cycles at 0.2&#8197;C with a low fading rate of 0.062&#8201;% per cycle.







Abstract
The confinement and high utilization of sulfur in the cathodes is critical for improved cycling performance of lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries. In this case one&#8208;pot hydrothermal strategy is developed to produce rGO/MXene/sulfur composite aerogels where sulfur is in&#8197;situ trapped in the 3D rGO/MXene conductive skeleton. The optimized composite aerogels as free&#8208;standing cathodes delivery a specific capacity of 951&#8197;mAhg&#8722;1 after 100 cycles at 0.2&#8197;C with a low fading rate of 0.062&#8201;% per cycle. The excellent cycling performance is correlated with highly oxidized MXene and in&#8197;situ formed sulfate/thiosulfate complex layer in the long&#8208;term cycles.

         <title>Modulating Helix&#8208;Preference of an Axially&#8208;Twisted Molecular Scaffold Through Diastereomeric Salt Formation with Tartaric Acid Stereoisomers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 47, August 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral, axially&#8208;twisted molecular scaffold (ATMS) undergoes subtle differences in the stereochemical orientations on enantioselective interaction with stereoisomers of tartaric acid (TA), generating diverse spectroscopic outcomes to permit naked&#8208;eye enantio&#8208;discrimination.







Abstract
Herein, we designed a chiral, axially&#8208;twisted molecular scaffold (ATMS) using pyridine&#8208;2,6&#8208;dicarboxamide (PDC) unit as pivot, chiral trans&#8208;cyclohexanediamine (CHDA) residues as linkers, and pyrene residues as fluorescent reporters. R,R&#8208;ATMS exclusively adopted M&#8208;helicity and produced differential response in UV&#8208;vis, fluorescence, and NMR upon addition of tartaric acid (TA) stereoisomers allowing naked&#8208;eye detection and enantiomeric content determination. Circular dichroism (CD) profile of R,R&#8208;ATMS underwent unique changes during titration with TA stereoisomers &#8208; while loss of CD signal at 345&#8197;nm was observed with equimolar D&#8208;TA and meso&#8208;TA, inversion was seen with equimolar L&#8208;TA. Temperature increase weakened these interactions to partially recover the original CD signature of R,R&#8208;ATMS. 2D NMR studies also indicated the significant structural changes in R,R&#8208;ATMS in the solution state upon addition of L&#8208;TA. Single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) studies on the crystals of the R,R&#8208;ATMS&#8835;D&#8208;TA salt revealed the interacting partners stacked in arrays and ATMS molecules stabilized by &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking between its PDC and pyrene residues. Contrastingly, tightly&#8208;packed supramolecular cages comprised of four molecules each of R,R&#8208;ATMS and L&#8208;TA were seen in R,R&#8208;ATMS&#8835;L&#8208;TA salt, and the ATMS molecules contorted to achieve CH&#8208;&#960; interactions between its pyrene residues. These results may have implications in modulating the helicity of topologically&#8208;similar larger biomolecules.

         <title>Front Cover: Ambiguous Faces of Water&#8208;Based Inclusion Compounds: L4(4)8(8) Intercalato&#8208;Clathrate Hydrate of Pt(II) Complex (Chem. Eur. J. 47/2024)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 47, August 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Front Cover picture is inspired by the crystal of the intercalato&#8208;clathrate hydrate of a PtII complex. The formation of water layers that encapsulate guest molecules is driven by hydrophobic hydration and enforced by the solute size effect. Comparison to similar water&#8208;based inclusion compounds allowed us to suggest parameters characterizing the corrugation of individual layers. Intra&#8208;water energies define particular water layers as confined or confining media. More information can be found in the Research Article by A. Pietrzak and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202303483).

         <title>Cover Feature: Cation&#8208;Stacking Approach Enabling Interconversion between Bis(xanthylium) and its Reduced Species (Chem. Eur. J. 47/2024)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 47, August 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Cover Feature illustrates a cyclophane&#8208;type molecule as a pearl oyster under the sea. The pearls and fish show unpaired electrons and counter&#8208;anions, respectively. Thus, the three&#8208;state redox interconversion is described by the change in the number of pearls and fish. This cover implies that the stacking structure is maintained even in solution. Furthermore, the distance between the &#960;&#8208;units is represented by that between the shells of the pearl oyster. More information can be found in the Research Article by Y. Ishigaki and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202401683).

A proof of concept for reversible hydrogen storage focuses on the cyclooctane&#8211;cyclooctene system. A hybrid catalyst comprising a unique combination of an organometallic pincer complex, [Ir(C2H4){OP(tBu)2&#8208;C6H2&#8208;2,6&#8208;[OP(tBu)2]2}] (depicted as crabs) and Pd&#8722;Ru nanostructures (depicted as spheres) immobilized on &#947;&#8208;alumina support (depicted as snowflakes) brings about dehydrogenation and hydrogenation in a tandem fashion. The hydrogen released holds promise as a viable automotive fuel source. The study provides valuable insights for the design and development of tandem catalysts for reversible hydrogen storage in liquid organic hydrogen carriers. More information can be found in the Research Article by J. Jangir and B.&#8197;R. Jagirdar (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202400980).

Mechanochemistry emerges as a sustainable, solvent&#8208;free alternative to traditional synthesis, minimizing hazardous solvents and waste. This innovative field uncovers reaction pathways once considered impossible with solution&#8208;based techniques. This review seeks to encapsulate the advancements in mechanochemically triggered single electron transfer (SET) reactions involving inorganic substances, metals, polymers, and other materials over recent years.







Abstract
Mechanochemical reactions, achieved through milling, grinding, or other mechanical actions, have emerged as a solvent&#8208;free alternative to traditional solution&#8208;based chemistry. Mechanochemistry not only provides the opportunity to eliminate bulk solvent use, reducing waste generation, but also unveils a new reaction strategy which enables the realization of reactions previously inaccessible in solution. While the majority of organic reactions facilitated by mechanical force traditionally follow two&#8208;electron transfer pathways similar to their solution&#8208;based counterparts, the field of mechanochemically induced single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) reactions has witnessed rapid development. This review outlines examples of mechanochemical reactions facilitated by the SET process, focusing on the reagents that initiate SET, thereby positioning mechanochemistry as a burgeoning field within the realm of single&#8208;electron chemistry.

         <title>A Comprehensive Review of Solar Photocatalysis &amp; Photothermal Catalysis for Hydrogen Production from Biomass: from Material Characteristics to Engineering Application</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 47, August 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes solar photo/photothermal catalysis (PPTC) H2 production from biomass to promote its engineering applications. It reviews design strategies and mechanisms for catalytic reforming. It presents the contribution of the reactor to H2 production performance and analyzes the effects of heat mass transfer and radiation. Finally, it concludes and outlooks PPTC for H2 production.







Abstract
Biomass photoreforming is a promising way of producing sustainable hydrogen thanks to the abundant sources of biomass feedstocks. Solar energy provides the heat and driven force to initial biomass oxidation coupled with H2 evolution. Currently, biomass photoreforming is still far from plant&#8208;scale applications due to the lower solar energy utilization efficiencies, the low H2 yield, and the lack of appropriate photoreactors. The production of H2 from photoreforming of native biomass and platform molecules was summarized and discussed with particular attention to the prospects of scaling up the catalysis technology for mass hydrogen production. The types of photoreforming, including photocatalysis and photothermal catalysis, were discussed, consequently considering the different requirements for photoreactors. We also reviewed the photoreactors that support biomass photoreforming. Numerical simulation methods were implemented for the solid&#8208;liquid two&#8208;phase flow and inter&#8208;particle radiative transfer involved in the reaction process. Developing concentrated photothermal catalytic flowed reactors is beneficial to scale&#8208;up catalytic hydrogen production from biomass.

         <title>An In&#8208;Depth Exploration of Six Decades of the Kr&#246;hnke Pyridine Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 47, August 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The six decades of the so&#8208;called &#8220;Kr&#246;hnke Pyridine Synthesis&#8221; were looked over in detail, charting the reaction set&#8208;up, mechanistic considerations and substitutions patterns, as well as the most common applications of the pyridines synthesized using the Kr&#246;hnke's method. Deviations from the standard approach are showcased, arguing the mechanistic tricks which lead to non&#8208;pyridine compounds.







Abstract
The Kr&#246;hnke Pyridine Synthesis has been discovered about six decades ago (1961), by Fritz Kr&#246;hnke and Wilfried Zecher at the University of Giessen. The original method involved the reaction of &#945;&#8208;pyridinium methyl ketone salts with &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds in the presence of a nitrogen source, frequently ammonium acetate. Since its discovery, the Kr&#246;hnke methodology has been demonstrated to be suitable for the preparation of mono&#8208;, di&#8208;, tri&#8208; and tetra&#8208;pyridines, with important applications in several research fields. Over the years, a number of modifications to the original approach have been developed and reported, enabling for the broad applicability of these methods even in modern days, also for the synthesis of non&#8208;pyridine compounds. In this critical and tutorial review, we will thoroughly explore and discuss the potential of the original method, the refinements that have been made over the years, as well as some applications arising from each type of pyridine and/or non&#8208;pyridine compounds produced by Kr&#246;hnke's approach.

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Allylic Alkylation at sp3&#8208;Carbon Centers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 47, August 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalytic allylations have emerged as versatile processes for assembling C&#8722;C or C&#8722;heteroatom bonds. Traditionally, noble transition metals like Pd, Rh, or Ir have been extensively employed for these processes. However, recent sustainable catalytic strategies have shifted towards utilizing base metals as catalysts. Consequently, this review outlines the breakthroughs in cobalt&#8208;catalyzed allylic alkylations, emphasizing their noteworthy advancements in the field.







Abstract
The rising demand and financial costs of noble transition metal catalysts have emphasized the need for sustainable catalytic approaches. Over the past few years, base&#8208;metal catalysts have emerged as ideal candidates to replace their noble&#8208;metal counterparts because of their abundance and easiness of handling. Despite the significant advancements achieved with precious transition metals, earth&#8208;abundant cobalt catalysts have emerged as efficient alternatives for allylic substitution reactions. In this review, allylic alkylations at sp3&#8208;carbon centers mediated by cobalt will be discussed, with a special focus on the mechanistic features, scope, and limitations.

         <title>Disulfide Bonds as Functional Tethers in Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 47, August 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review details the state of the art of MOF applications in which appended disulfide bonds play a critical role in the functions of the materials. The installation of the disulfide bonds in and on the MOFs is also highlighted, and the installation methods are assigned to one of three categories.







Abstract
The functionality of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) is often encoded by specific chemical moieties found within these architectures. As such, new techniques to install increasingly more complex functionalities in MOFs are regularly being reported in the literature. One such functional group is the disulfide bond. The redox behavior of this covalent linkage renders MOFs responsive to stimuli, often under reducing conditions. Here, we review examples in which disulfide&#8208;containing MOFs are deployed in applications including drug delivery, therapeutic ferroptosis, exfoliation, energy storage, sensing, and others.

         <title>N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Enabled Functionalization of Inert C(Sp3)&#8722;H Bonds via Hydrogen Atom Transfer (HAT) Processes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 47, August 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Developing methods to directly transform C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds is crucial in synthetic chemistry due to its atom&#8208; and step&#8208;economy and the prevalence of C&#8722;H bonds in various organic compounds. This mini&#8208;review summarizes recent advancements of NHC&#8208;catalyzed direct functionalization of &#8220;inert&#8221; C(sp3) &#8722;H bonds for cross C&#8722;C coupling reactions, that were enabled by the hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) processes, aiming to inspire distinct insights on the C&#8722;H functionalization by a distinct organocatalytic approach.







Abstract
Developing methods to directly transform C(sp3) &#8722;H bonds is crucial in synthetic chemistry due to their prevalence in various organic compounds. While conventional protocols have largely relied on transition metal catalysis, recent advancements in organocatalysis, particularly with radical NHC catalysis have sparked interest in the direct functionalization of &#8220;inert&#8221; C(sp3) &#8722;H bonds for cross C&#8722;C coupling with carbonyl moieties. This strategy involves selective cleavage of C(sp3) &#8722;H bonds to generate key carbon radicals, often achieved via hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) processes. By leveraging the bond dissociation energy (BDE) and polarity effects, HAT enables the rapid functionalization of diverse C(sp3)&#8722;H substrates, such as ethers, amines, and alkanes. This mini&#8208;review summarizes the progress in carbene organocatalytic functionalization of inert C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds enabled by HAT processes, categorizing them into two sections: 1) C&#8722;H functionalization involving acyl azolium intermediates; and 2) functionalization of C&#8722;H bonds via reductive Breslow intermediates.

         <title>Rational Molecular Design of Diketopyrrolopyrrole&#8208;Based n&#8208;Type and Ambipolar Polymer Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 47, August 22, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent advancements in molecular design strategies towards enhancing the n&#8208;type/ambipolar transporting properties of DPP&#8208;based polymer semiconductors have been thoroughly reviewed, especially focusing on copolymerization of DPP with different acceptors and weak donors, DPP flanked aromatic ring modification, DPP&#8208;core ring expansion and DPP dimerization.







Abstract
Diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP)&#8208;based polymer semiconductors have drawn great attention in the field of organic electronics due to the planar structure, decent solubilizing capability, and high crystallinity. However, the electron&#8208;deficient capacity of DPP derivatives are not strong enough, leading to relatively high&#8208;lying lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of the corresponding polymers. As a result, n&#8208;type and ambipolar DPP&#8208;based polymers are rare and their electron mobilities also lag far behind the p&#8208;type counterparts, which limits the development of important p&#8208;n&#8208;junction&#8208;based electronic devices. Therefore, new design strategies have been proposed recent years to develop n&#8208;type/ambipolar DPP&#8208;based polymers with improved performances. In this view, these molecular design strategies are summarized, including copolymerization of DPP with different acceptors and weak donors, DPP flanked aromatic ring modification, DPP&#8208;core ring expansion and DPP dimerization. The relationship between the chemical structures and organic thin&#8208;film transistor performances is intensively discussed. Finally, a perspective on future trends in the molecular design of DPP&#8208;based n&#8208;type/ambipolar polymers is also proposed.

         <title>Triphenylamine Sensitized 8&#8208;Dimethylaminoquinoline: An Efficient Two&#8208;Photon Caging Group for Intracellular Delivery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
How to select a few cells from a culture and modify them with a probe? Triphenylamine&#8208;sensitized 8&#8208;DMAQ (TAQ) probes showed internalization in HeLa cells that could be consecutively activated either by using UV light source (357&#8197;nm) or, under two&#8208;photon irradiation conditions (760&#8197;nm). Activation allowed to efficient release of the reporter into cells in light&#8208;exposed regions.







Abstract
Triphenylamine&#8208;sensitized 8&#8208;dimethylaminoquinoline (TAQ) probes showed fair two&#8208;photon absorption and fragmentation cross sections in releasing kainate and GABA ligands. The water&#8208;soluble PEG and TEG&#8208;analogs allowed cell internalization and efficient light&#8208;gated liberation of the rhodamine reporter under UV and two&#8208;photon (NIR) irradiation conditions.

Reactions of the organosilicon sulfide cluster [(PhSi)4S6] with [AgCl(PMe2Ph)2]2 or mixtures of MCl (M=Cu or Ag) and a phosphine ligand in CH2Cl2 caused its disassembly and reorganization under incorporation of metal phosphine moieties to form [(Ph3P)3Ag(&#956;&#8208;S)SiCl2Ph], [(PhSiClS2CH2)2(&#956;&#8208;dppb)], [{(dppbCu2)Cu(&#956;&#8211;dppb)0.5(PhSi)3S6}2], and [Na2(thf)1.5][(Me2PhPAg)(PhSi)3S6]. The latter two represent ternary M&#8722;S&#8722;Si&#8208;based clusters with complex crystal structures and wideband semiconductor&#8208;like optical gaps.







Abstract
Adamantane&#8208;type organotin sulfide clusters were recently shown to react with coinage metal phosphine complexes under replacement of an organic substituent by a metal&#8208;phosphine unit. An extension of such studies involving the silicon&#8208;based congener [(PhSi)4S6] (A) revealed that the cluster core will be partly disassembled and a {PhSi} moiety is replaced by a coinage metal phosphine complex to form [(Et3PAg)3(PhSi)3S6] (B) and [Na2(thf)2.33][(Me3PCu)(PhSi)3S6] (C). Herein, we present an extension of this work upon variation of the reactants and reaction conditions. Besides the isolation of crystalline precursor complexes [CuCl(PMe2Ph)3] (1) and [AgCl(PMe2Ph)2]2 (2), the study addresses reactions of A with AgCl and a phosphine ligand in CH2Cl2, upon which A is completely disassembled to form [(Ph3P)3Ag(&#956;&#8208;S)SiCl2Ph] (3). In another case a CH2 group, most likely stemming from CH2Cl2, was attached to the ligand, thus generating [{PhCl(S)SiSCH2P(Ph2)CH2CH2}2] (4). Upon using CuCl and 1,4&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)butane (dppb) we isolated the phosphine&#8208;bridged analog of B, [{(dppbCu2)CuP(Ph2)(CH2CH2)(PhSi)3S6}2] (5). In order to receive the yet elusive silver homolog of C, we used PMe2Ph as a bulkier ligand. This way we generated a 2D coordination polymer of the desired composition, [Na2(thf)1.5][(Me2PhPAg)(PhSi)3S6] (6). UV&#8208;visible spectra of 6 indicated a bandgap of 3.89&#8197;eV, thus blue&#8208;shifted in regards to B and C.

         <title>Selective Oxidation of Vitamin D3 Enhanced by Long&#8208;Range Effects of a Substrate Channel Mutation in Cytochrome P450BM3 (CYP102A1)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Long&#8208;range effects from mutation of a substrate access tunnel residue selected by docking&#8208;guided design of cytochrome P450BM3 (CYP102A1) to loosen the interaction between two secondary structure elements reshaped the substrate binding pocket and increased the activity for the oxidation vitamin D3 to 25&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;vitamin D3, an important human and animal health supplement.







Abstract
Vitamin D deficiency affects nearly half the population, with many requiring or opting for supplements with vitamin D3 (VD3), the precursor of vitamin D (1&#945;,25&#8208;dihydroxyVD3). 25&#8208;HydroxyVD3, the circulating form of vitamin D, is a more effective supplement than VD3 but its synthesis is complex. We report here the engineering of cytochrome P450BM3 (CYP102A1) for the selective oxidation of VD3 to 25&#8208;hydroxyVD3. Long&#8208;range effects of the substrate&#8208;channel mutation Glu435Ile promoted binding of the VD3 side chain close to the heme, enhancing VD3 oxidation activity that reached 6.62&#8197;g of 25&#8208;hydroxyVD3 isolated from a 1&#8208;litre scale reaction (69.1&#8201;% yield; space&#8208;time&#8208;yield 331&#8197;mg/L/h).

         <title>Realizing Color Transitions for Three Copper (I) Cluster Organic&#8208;Inorganic Hybrid Materials by Adjusting Reaction Conditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three isomeric copper iodide cluster hybrid materials 1&#8211;3 were achieved by adjusting the reaction conditions. The crystal color transit from green, yellow to orange with high QYs at 57&#8201;%~88&#8201;%. All three complexes have good thermal stability, good solution processability, and high quantum yield. This study can provide development of cuprous iodide cluster luminescent materials.







Abstract
Copper iodide organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid materials have been favored by many researchers in the field of solid&#8208;state lighting (SSL) due to their structural diversity and optical adjustability. In this paper, three isomeric copper iodide cluster hybrid materials, Cu4I6(L)2(1), Cu5I4.5Cl2.5(L)2(2) and Cu5I7(L)2) (3) (L=1&#8208;(4&#8208;methylpyrimidin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octan&#8208;1&#8208;ium), were achieved by adjusting the reaction conditions. The crystal color transit from green, yellow to orange and the internal quantum yield (IQY) increase from 57&#8201;%&#8211;88&#8201;%. All three complexes have good thermal stability, good solution processability, and high quantum yield. And origin and mechanism of luminescence of complexes were further studied. This study can provide ideas and theoretical basis for the regulation of cuprous iodide cluster luminescent materials.

         <title>High Rotational Barrier Atropisomers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented class of atropisomers based on Ugi reaction that exhibit exceptional rotational barrier is reported. The versatility of our approach enables the synthesis of atropisomers &#8220;by design&#8221; and allow the conceptualization of this work in atroposelective synthesis and high&#8208;sensitivity modular balances. Single&#8208;crystal structures, combined by DFT calculations and dynamic NMR allow us to examine a plethora of &#960;&#8208;interactions.







Abstract
Atropisomers have attracted a great deal of attention lately due to their numerous applications in organic synthesis and to their employment in drug discovery. However, the synthetic arsenal at our disposal with which to access them remains limited. The research described herein is two&#8208;pronged; we both demonstrate the use of MCR chemistry as a synthetic strategy for the de novo synthesis of a class of atropisomers having high barriers to rotation with the simultaneous insertion of multiple chiral elements and we study these unprecedented molecular systems by employing a combination of crystallography, NMR and DFT calculations. By fully exploiting the synthetic capabilities of our chemistry, we have been able to monitor a range of different types of interaction, i.&#8201;e. &#960;&#8208;&#960;, CH&#8211;&#960;, heteroatom&#8208;&#960; and CD&#8211;&#960;, in order to conduct structure&#8208;property studies. The results could be applied both to atroposelective synthesis and in drug discovery.

         <title>Dynamic Structural Fluxionality in a Planar Tetracoordinate Carbon Cluster Stabilized by Boron Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We reported a molecular compasses CB2H5+ with a planar tetracoordinate carbon (ptC) atom, two ligand hydrogen atoms attached to the carbon rotate alternately. This is the first global minimum for boron&#8208;coordinated ptC clusters with dynamic fluxionality.







Abstract
The design of boron&#8208;based molecular rotors stems from boron&#8208;carbon binary clusters containing multiple planar hypercoordinate carbons (phCs, such as C2B8). However, the design of boron&#8208;coordinated phCs is challenging due to boron's tendency to occupy hypercoordinate centers more than carbon. Although this challenge has been addressed, the designed clusters of interest have not exhibited dynamic fluxionality similar to that of the initial C2B8. To address this issue, we report a &#963;/&#960; doubly aromatic CB2H5+ cluster, the first global minimum containing a boron&#8208;coordinated planar tetracoordinate carbon atom with dynamic fluxionality. Dynamics simulations show that two ligand H atoms exhibit alternate rotation, resulting in an intriguing dynamic fluxionality in this cluster. Electronic structure analysis reveals the flexible bonding positions of the ligand H atoms because they do not participate in &#960; delocalized bonding nor bond to any other non&#8208;carbon atom, highlighting this rotational fluxionality. Unprecedentedly, the fluxional process involves not only the usual conversion of the number of bonding atoms, but also the type of bonding (3c &#960; bonds &#8596;4c &#963; bonds), which is an uncommon fluxional mechanism. The cluster represents an effort to apply phC species to molecular machines.

         <title>CoCorrole&#8208;Functionalized PCN&#8208;222 for Carbon Monoxide Selective Adsorption</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have combined the carbon monoxide chemisorption properties of cobalt corroles with the high porosity and stability of the PCN&#8208;222 MOFs. High performance materials for the selective and reversible adsorption of CO vs O2, N2 and CO2 at low pressure have been obtained.







Abstract
The high risk of CO poisoning justifies the need for indoor air quality control and warning systems based on the detection of low concentrations (ppm&#8208;ppb) of CO. Cobalt corrole complexes selectively bind CO vs. O2, CO2, N2, opening new fields of applications. By combining the CO chemisorption properties of cobalt corroles with the known sorption capacity of MOFs, we hope to obtain high performance sensing materials for CO detection. In addition, the exposed metal sites of MOFs lead to CO2 physisorption, allowing the co&#8208;detection of CO and CO2. In this work, PCN&#8208;222, a stable Zr&#8208;based MOF made from Ni(TCPP) with natural vacancies, has been used as a porous matrix for the grafting of electron&#8208;poor metallocorroles. The materials were characterized by powder XRD, SEM and optical microscopy, BET analyses and gas adsorption measurements at 298&#8197;K. No degradation of the crystalline structure of PCN&#8208;222 was observed. At 1&#8197;atm, the adsorbed CO(g) volumes measured for the best materials were 12.15&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1 and 14.01&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1 for CoCorr2@PCN&#8208;222 and CoCorr3@PCN&#8208;222 respectively, and both materials exhibited high CO chemisorption and selectivity against O2, N2, and CO2 at low pressure due to the highest energy of the chemisorption process vs physisorption.

         <title>Anions as Lewis Acids in Noncovalent Bonds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The &#963; or &#960;&#8208;hole within a Lewis acid usually signals a positive electrostatic potential that can attract the negative region of an approaching nucleophile. Because of their overall negative charge, any such hole on an anion will typically indicate a negative potential. Nonetheless, it is shown here that a wide range of anions are able to act as Lewis acid in a noncovalent bond, despite a negatively charged &#963; or &#960;&#8208;hole. These bonds are constituted in large part by an attractive electrostatic interaction, even though negative regions of the two subunits face one another.







Abstract
The ability of an anion to serve as electron&#8208;accepting Lewis acid in a noncovalent bond is assessed via DFT calculations. NH3 is taken as the common base, and is paired with a host of ACln&#8722; anions, with central atom A=Ca, Sr, Mg, Te, Sb, Hg, Zn, Ag, Ga, Ti, Sn, I, and B. Each anion reacts through its &#963; or &#960;&#8208;hole although the electrostatic potential of this hole is quite negative in most cases. Despite the contact between this negative hole and the negative region of the approaching nucleophile, the electrostatic component of the interaction energy of each bond is highly favorable, and accounts for more than half of the total attractive energy. The double negative charge of dianions precludes a stable complex with NH3.

         <title>Copper(II)&#8208;Catalyzed Amination of Aryl Chlorides in Aqueous Ammonia</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Anilines are ubiquitous in bio&#8208;active compounds and their synthesis can be achieved via metal&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions involving aryl halides. We describe an unusual, yet simple, CuII&#8208;catalyzed system for the amination of aryl chlorides in pure aqueous ammonia with 2.5 mol% catalyst loading under non&#8208;inert conditions. Different from previous systems, the reaction proceeds even without an additional organic solvent. Copper(II) sulfate in combination with 4,7&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;1,10&#8208;phenanthroline enabled the amination of several aryl chlorides containing electron&#8208;neutral, &#8208;donating and &#8208;withdrawing groups to the corresponding anilines with good to excellent yields. The upscaling potential of the procedure has been shown by the synthesis at 50 mmol scale. The reaction proceeds as one of the rare cases of a CuII&#8208;assisted coupling, in contrast to the typical CuI&#8213;CuIII intermediates postulated for most Ullmann&#8208;type coupling reactions. The copper(II) center allows for a nucleophilic substitution pathway, enabled by the deprotonation of coordinated ammonia.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Advances in Electrolytes for Magnesium Batteries: Bridging the Gap Between Chemistry and Electrochemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rechargeable magnesium batteries (RMBs) have the potential to provide a sustainable and long&#8208;term solution for large&#8208;scale energy storage due to high theoretical capacity of magnesium (Mg) metal as an anode, its competitive redox potential (Mg/Mg2+: &#8208;2.37 V vs. SHE) and high natural abundance. To develop viable magnesium batteries with high energy density, the electrolytes must meet a range of requirements: high ionic conductivity, wide electrochemical potential window, chemical compatibility with electrode materials and other battery components, favourable electrode&#8208;electrolyte interfacial properties and cost&#8208;effective synthesis. In recent years, significant progress in electrolyte development has been made. Herein, a comprehensive overview of these advancements is presented. Beginning with the early developments, we particularly focus on the chemical aspects of the electrolytes and their correlations with electrochemical properties. We also highlight the design of new anions for practical electrolytes, the use of electrolyte additives to optimize anode&#8208;electrolyte interfaces and the progress in polymer electrolytes.</dc:description>

         <title>Deuteration Degree Controllable Synthesis of Aryl Deuteromethyl Ethers Through Dual photoredox and Thiol Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report a facile and efficient deuteration degree controllable method for the preparation of aryl deuteromethyl ethers through dual photoredox and thiol catalysis using phenols as the starting materials and inexpensive D2O and CDCl3 as the deuterium sources. All aryl d1, d2, and d3 deuteromethyl ethers can be precisely prepared with good to excellent yields and deuteration ratios. The reaction operates under mild conditions without the need for high temperatures or high loading of transition metal catalysts, and a wide range of functional groups are well tolerated.</dc:description>

         <title>COMPUTATIONAL DESIGN OF 3D LANTERN ORGANIC FRAMEWORK</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study employed a computational approach, particularly Density Functional Theory at B3LYP&#8208;D3/6&#8208;31+G(d) level to design two new classes of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) Lantern Organic Frameworks (LOFs) materials based on trisilasumanene and porphyrin core building units. Particularly, we detail strategies for transitioning from 1DLOF nanowires to extended 3D structures: first by connecting planar&#8208;molecule base units of trisilasumanene or porphyrin using benzene&#8208;based linkers, and then connecting silicon anchoring atoms on the bases with other bases that are vertically stacked by sp3&#8208;hydrocarbon chains. The 3D&#8208;LOF structures are designed to have different pore sizes through the use of various bases, bridges, and linkers. Comparisons of electronic properties of these 3D structures lead to one designing rule. That is, the gap between highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the 3D materials depends only on its base and is nearly independent of the stack size or the length of the sp3&#8208;hydrocarbon bridges. Additionally, connecting base units with linkers also extends &#960;&#8208;electron conjugation system leading to a reduction in HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap. For instance, linking two trisilasumanene molecules significantly narrows HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap by 1.75 eV while stacking these bases vertically and connecting them by linear pentane&#8208;based bridges yield insignificant change to the gap.</dc:description>

         <title>Twist along Central C&#8211;C Bonds in a Series of Fully &#960;&#8208;Fused Propellanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Without stereogenic carbon centers, organic molecules can be chiral when they have large energy barriers for conformational inversion. In this work, conformational behaviors are investigated for a series of tricyclic propellane skeletons with increasing 6&#8208;membered&#8208;ring peripheral moieties fused with aromatic rings. According to theoretical calculations, trinaphtho[3.3.3]propellane has three vertical naphthalene rings like triptycene shape without torsion along the central C&#8211;C single bond. On the other hand, hexabenzo[4.4.4]propellane shows hexaphenylethane&#8208;like ca. 60&#176; twist along the bond with large activation energy of 64 kcal mol&#8722;1 for twist inversion because of the high congestion caused by three 6&#8208;membered&#8208;ring loops. Indeed, the [4.4.4]propellane gives a stable pair of chiroptical enantiomers toward heating at 146 &#176;C. By contrast, a hybrid [4.3.3]propellane exhibits fast interconversion between two twisted conformations even at &#8722;80 &#176;C.</dc:description>

         <title>Rational H2 Partial Pressure over Nickel/Ceria Crystal Enables Efficient and Durable Wide&#8208;Temperature&#8208;Zone Air&#8208;Level CO2 Methanation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>On the way to carbon neutrality, directly catalyzing atmospheric CO2 into high&#8208;value chemicals might be an effective approach to mitigate the negative impacts of rising airborne CO2 concentrations. Here, we pioneer the investigation of the influence of the H2/CO2 partial pressure ratio (PPR) on air&#8208;level CO2 methanation. Using Ni/CeO2 as a case catalyst, increasing H2/CO2 PPR significantly improves low&#8208;temperature CO2 conversion and high&#8208;temperature CH4 selectivity, i.e., from 10 of H2/CO2 PPR on, CO2 is completely methanized at 250 &#176;C, and nearly 100% CH4 selectivity is achieved at 400 &#176;C. 100&#8208;hour stability tests demonstrate the practical application potential of Ni/CeO2 at 250 &#176;C and 400 &#176;C. In&#8208;situ DRIFTS reveal that reinforced formate pathway by increasing H2/CO2 PPR is responsible for the high CH4 yield. In contrast, even though the CO pathway dominated CO2 conversion on Ni is enhanced by rising H2/CO2 PPR, but at a high reaction temperature, the promoted CO desorption still leads to lower CH4 selectivity. This work offers deep insights into the direct air&#8208;level CO2 resourceization, contributing to the achievement of airborne CO2 reductions.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoinduced Decarboxylative Thioacylation of N&#8208;Hydroxyphthalimide Esters with Tetraalkylthiuram Disulfides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dithiocarbamate is a key structural sequence in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals, and its synthesis is crucial in organic chemistry. Although significant progress has been made in related synthesis research, developing a practical and universal synthesis method remains fascinating. Herein, we report a new visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced decarboxylation coupling reaction between N&#8208;hydroxyphthalimide esters and tetraalkylthiuram disulfides, which uses Ir(ppy)3 as a photocatalyst to promote the generation of corresponding decarboxylation thioacylation product&#8208;dithiocarbamates in high yields. This redox&#8208;neutral protocol uses inexpensive and readily available starting material under mild reaction conditions, exhibiting broad substrate scope and wide functional group compatibility. This method can be further used for post modification of complex natural products and bioactive drugs.</dc:description>

         <title>Diels&#8208;Alder Reaction Mechanisms of La@C60 and Gd@C60 Studied Using Density Functional Theory</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Encapsulation of transition metals represents a crucial method for modifying the electronic structure and regulating the reactivity of fullerene, thereby expanding its applications. Herein, we present calculations with density functional theory methods to investigate the mechanisms of the Diels&#8208;Alder (DA) reactions of cyclopentadiene and La@C60 or Gd@C60 as well as their tricationic derivatives. Our findings indicate that the encapsulation of La and Gd into the C60 cage is thermodynamically favorable. The DA reactions are favored by the presence of La and Gd, with lower barriers, though the regioselectivity, favoring 6&#8208;6 bonds in the fullerene, is not affected. The effect of external electric fields has been also considered.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanochemical Synthesis of Silylcyclopentenes via Ball Milling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel and environmentally friendly method for synthesizing silylcyclopentenes has been developed using Ar2SiH2, Li metal, and butadiene with the ball milling technique. Additionally, DFT calculations suggest that this transformation involves a nucleophilic addition of mechanochemically generated Si&#8722;Li intermediates with butadiene to form corresponding carbon anion species, which then completes the [4+1] cycloaddition process through nucleophilic substitution with Si&#8722;H.







Abstract
The development of innovative methods for synthesizing silylcyclopentene compounds is particularly important for enriching and improving the synthetical toolbox of organosilicon compounds. Herein, a facile approach has been developed for the synthesis of silylcyclopentenes promoted by mechanochemically generated organolithium species as silicon nucleophiles under ball milling conditions, avoiding the requirement of large amounts of bulk solvent. This operationally simple method demonstrates good functional group compatibility, which provides a great opportunity for further exploration of the synthetic applications of silylcyclopentenes. Density functional theory calculations indicated that the transient lithiosilole intermediates undergo a stepwise nucleophilic addition process, which governs this mechanic&#8208;force&#8208;promoted [4+1] cycloaddition reaction.

         <title>Superlong Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Nanowire Fabricated via Steam&#8208;Assisted Conversion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile steam&#8208;assisted conversion is developed to fabricate superlong 1D Cu metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) nanowire through recrystallization mechanism. As&#8208;prepared 1D Cu MOF nanowire possesses identical crystal structure of MOF&#8208;74 and multiscale porous structure, which can effectively remove cationic dyes and is an ideal template to form Cu nanoparticle&#8208;doped carbon nanofiber with excellent electrocatalytic activity for glucose detection.







Abstract
1D nanomaterials have attracted great attention due to their outstanding anisotropic and linear structures. A facile method is developed to fabricate 1D copper metal&#8211;organic framework nanowires (Cu&#8208;MOF&#8208;NW) through steam&#8208;assisted conversion from Cu&#8208;MOF precursors. During the steam&#8208;assisted conversion, Cu&#8208;MOF precursor gradually dissolves in methanol steam, and then recrystallized into Cu&#8208;MOF&#8208;NW, which shows high aspect ratio of about 600 and identical crystal structure of MOF&#8208;74. As&#8208;prepared Cu&#8208;MOF&#8208;NW with multiscale porous structure can effectively remove cationic dyes even in dye mixture. Moreover, Cu&#8208;MOF&#8208;NW, as an ideal template, is calcined to form Cu nanoparticle&#8208;doped carbon nanofiber with maintaining its 1D morphology, which shows excellent electrocatalytic activity for the non&#8208;enzymatic sensing of glucose.

         <title>Design of an Acidic pH&#8208;Activated NIR Fluorescent Convertible Rhodamine&#8722;Hemicyanine Probe&#8208;Peptide Conjugate for Living Cancer Cell Active Targeted Selective Tracking of Lysosomes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A closed and an open state switchable rhodamine&#8208;hemicyanine probe&#8208;peptide conjugate is presented. Acidic pH&#8208;activated NIR fluorescent convertible probe&#8208;peptide conjugate can be used for live cancer cell active targeted selective tracking and ratiometric imaging of lysosomes.







Abstract
We have synthesized an acidic pH&#8208;activatable dual targeting ratiometric fluorescent probe&#8208;peptide conjugate using the SPPS protocol on Rink amide AM resin. Living carcinoma cell specific active targeting, successive cell penetration, and selective staining of lysosomes are accomplished. Real&#8208;time monitoring of lysosomes, 3D, and multicolor cancer cell imaging are also attained. The de novo design consists of the integration of multifunctionality into a single molecular scaffold, e.&#8201;g., RGDS peptide residue to target cancer cell surface overexpressed receptor &#945;V&#946;3 integrin, live&#8208;cell penetrating organic unsymmetrical rhodamine&#8208;hemicyanine chromophore comprising a lysosome targeting morpholine group, and an acidic pH openable spiro&#8208;lactam ring for a visible&#8208;to&#8208;NIR switchable ratiometric response. Water&#8208;soluble fluorescent probe&#8208;peptide conjugate exhibits intramolecular spirolactamization at basic pH through Arg amide N. The visible spirolactam state predominantly exists at physiological and basic pH and can be switched to the highly conjugated NIR open amide state (&#955;em=735&#8197;nm) through spiro&#8208;lactam ring opening triggered by acidic pH with a huge bathochromic shift (&#916;&#955;abs=336&#8197;nm, &#916;&#955;FL=265&#8197;nm). Moreover, pH&#8208;sensitive ratiometric optical switching is achieved. This in&#8197;situ acidic cancer cell lysosome activatable multifunctional fluorophore&#8208;peptide conjugate shows augmented molar absorptivity, enhanced quantum yield, and improved fluorescence lifetime at acidic lysosomal pH; negligible cytotoxicity; and dual targeted ratiometric imaging capability of living cancer cell selective lysosomes with a pKa value of 5.1.

         <title>Pre&#8208;Coordination Induced Further Deamination to Create Inter&#8208;Chain Cross&#8208;Linking in Carbon Nitride for Enhanced Photocatalytic H2O2 Production</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A KCl&#8208;guided, pre&#8208;coordination&#8208;induced further deamination strategy has been developed to create cross&#8208;linking between different chains of polymeric carbon nitride (PCN). This sufficient pre&#8208;coordination endows the resulting CNK&#8208;2 with a relatively high degree of cross&#8208;linking, which promotes efficient inter&#8208;chain charge transport. Consequently, the obtained CNK&#8208;2 exhibits significantly enhanced photocatalytic H&#8322;O&#8322; production.







Abstract
Creating cross&#8208;linking to establish efficient inter&#8208;chain charge&#8208;transfer channels in carbon nitride represents a promising strategy for enhancing its photocatalytic capabilities. Molten salt&#8208;assisted calcining has emerged as a method for preparing cross&#8208;linked carbon nitrides. However, the precise influence of molten salts on the molecular structure of carbon nitride remains to be fully elucidated. Herein, we develop a KCl guided cross&#8208;linking reaction to preliminarily reveal the formation mechanism of cross&#8208;linking. The cross&#8208;linking reaction is initiated by the pre&#8208;coordination of amino groups with K+. Subsequent heating at high temperature converts the amino groups into chlorines. Then, dechlorination leads to the formation of cross&#8208;linking. Thus, this cross&#8208;linking reaction can be accurately described as a pre&#8208;coordination&#8208;induced, two&#8208;step deamination reaction. The pre&#8208;coordination step plays a pivotal role in the cross&#8208;linking process. Sufficient pre&#8208;coordination results in a relatively high cross&#8208;linking degree of the as&#8208;prepared CNK&#8208;2. Consequently, CNK&#8208;2 demonstrates a significantly enhanced photocatalytic H2O2 production, with a generation rate of 682&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;L&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, about 59 times that of traditional carbon nitride.

         <title>Visible Light Promoted Site&#8208;Specific Functionalization of &#945;&#8208;Acyloxy Carboxamides: Unlocking a Forbidden Chemical Space in the Passerini Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel method is presented, demonstrating the facile generation of &#945;&#8208;acyloxy carboxamide radicals via photoredox catalysis of Passerini adducts, obtained employing a 4&#8208;formyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;dihydropyridine. These radicals efficiently undergo Giese reactions with various olefins, yielding novel Passerini compounds unattainable through traditional aldehyde&#8208;based routes.







Abstract
The facile generation of the &#945;&#8208;acyloxy carboxamide radical is hereby reported for the first time, utilizing a photoredox catalyzed reaction of Passerini adducts synthesized using a 4&#8208;formyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;dihydropyridine as the carbonyl component. This radical effectively engages in a Giese reaction with a range of olefins, ultimately leading to the synthesis of novel Passerini&#8208;derived products not previously amenable to direct aldehyde&#8208;based transformations. Consequently, the resulting strategy, developed both in batch and in flow, offers a promising opportunity to expand the chemical space accessible through the Passerini reaction, virtually incorporating &#8220;impossible&#8221; aldehydes.

These radicals efficiently undergo Giese reactions with various olefins, yielding novel Passerini compounds unattainable through traditional aldehyde-based routes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The facile generation of the &#945;-acyloxy carboxamide radical is hereby reported for the first time, utilizing a photoredox catalyzed reaction of Passerini adducts synthesized using a 4-formyl-1,4-dihydropyridine as the carbonyl component. This radical effectively engages in a Giese reaction with a range of olefins, ultimately leading to the synthesis of novel Passerini-derived products not previously amenable to direct aldehyde-based transformations. Consequently, the resulting strategy, developed both in batch and in flow, offers a promising opportunity to expand the chemical space accessible through the Passerini reaction, virtually incorporating &#8220;impossible&#8221; aldehydes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Non&#8208;enzymatic Detection of Cardiac Troponin&#8208;I with Graphene Oxide quenched Fluorescent Iron Nanoclusters (FeNCs)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cardiac troponin I (cTnI) is the most resorted biomarker for the detection of cardiovascular disease (CVD). The means of rapid quantification of cTnI levels in the blood can substantially minimize the risk of acute myocardial infarction and heart failure. A sensor for the non&#8208;enzymatic evaluation of cardiac troponin&#8208;I has been developed using fluorescent iron nanoclusters via a one&#8208;pot synthesis employing (BSA) as the template and reducing agent, and hydrogen peroxide as the additive. The fluorescence of Iron Nanocluster is quenched with graphene oxide (GO) via fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between conjugate iron nanoclusters and graphene oxide. The sensor shows a low detection limit of 0.013 ng/mL. The benefits of utilizing a non&#8208;enzymatic probe for detecting cardiac troponin I is that it avoids the need for enzymes and hence is economical, stable, and less impacted by environmental conditions such as temperature and pH. Non&#8208;enzymatic probes are more useful for clinical use since they are more stable and have a longer shelf life. The developed non&#8208;enzymatic probes are also highly selective and sensitive to the target analyte, making them suitable for the direct detection of cardiac troponin I in actual biological samples.</dc:description>

         <title>Targeted Endoperoxides Delivering Singlet Oxygen to Cancer Cell Mitochondria: Exploration of the Therapeutic Potential</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controlled and targeted generation of singlet oxygen in tumor tissues is poised to evolve into a viable therapeutic approach for cancer which does not require light or oxygen.







Abstract
The clinical practice of photodynamic therapy of cancer (PDT) is mostly limited to superficial types of cancer. The major reason behind this limited applicability is the need for light in the photogeneration of ROS, and in particular singlet oxygen. In order to circumvent this major roadblock, we designed and synthesized naphthalene&#8208;derived endoperoxides with mitochondria targeting triphenylphosphonium moieties. Here, we show that these compounds release singlet oxygen by thermal cycloreversion, and initiate cell death with IC50&lt;10&#8197;&#956;M in cancer cell cultures. The mouse 4T1 breast tumor model study, where the endoperoxide compound was introduced intraperitoneally, also showed highly promising results, with negligible systemic toxicity. Targeted delivery of singlet oxygen to cancer cell mitochondria could be the breakthrough needed to transform Photodynamic Therapy into a broadly applicable methodology for cancer treatment by keeping the central tenet and discarding problematic dependencies on oxygen or external light.

         <title>Mechanochemical Synthesis of Corannulene Flanked N&#8208;heterocyclic Carbene (NHC) Precursors and Preparation of Their Metal Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents the mechanosynthesis of novel corannulene&#8208;flanked imidazolium bromide NHC precursors. The proposed approach is benchmarked against conventional solution&#8208;based methods using green metrics and energy consumption parameters, showcasing ball&#8208;milling as a greener and more energy&#8208;efficient technique. In addition, the new compounds are demonstrated to be robust ligands for transition metals using ligand substitution reactions as proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept.







Abstract
The synthesis of new compounds is an important pillar for the advancement of the field of chemistry and adjacent fields. In this regard, over the last decades huge efforts have been made to not only develop new molecular entities but also more efficient sustainable synthetic methodologies due to the increasing concerns over environmental sustainability. In this context, we have developed synthetic routes to novel corannulene flanked imidazolium bromide NHC precursors both in the solid&#8208;state and solution phases. Our work presents a comprehensive comparative study of mechanochemical routes and conventional solution&#8208;based methods. Green metrics and energy consumption comparison were performed for both routes revealing ball&#8208;milling generation of these compounds to be an environmentally greener technique to produce such precursors compared to conventional solvent&#8208;based methods. In addition, we have demonstrated proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept of the herein reported corannulene flanked NHCs to be robust ligands for transition metals and their ligand substitution reactions.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transition metal and main group adducts of the first mesoionic Janus&#8208;type N&#8208;heterocyclic dicarbene (diNHC) are thoroughly described in terms of their preparations, characterizations, and electronic properties. In addition, a preliminary catalytic study of its dipalladium complex in the sequential C2&#8208; and C5&#8208;arylation of 1&#8208;methylpyrrole affording non&#8208;symmetrical 2,5&#8208;diarylpyrroles is included.







Abstract
The preparations of homo&#8208; and hetero&#8208;bimetallic complexes as well as thiourea and selenourea derivatives of a mesoionic Janus&#8208;type N&#8208;heterocyclic dicarbene (diNHC) are reported. Analogues of its monocationic intermediate NHC have also been obtained for comparison. Using the main group adducts, the &#960;&#8208;acceptor properties of both NHCs were determined using low temperature 77Se NMR spectroscopy completing their stereoelectronic profiling. Moreover, catalytic investigations reveal that the mesoionic dipalladium Janus&#8208;diNHC complex can be used in the sequential C2&#8208; and C5&#8208;arylation of 1&#8208;methylpyrrole for the preparation of non&#8208;symmetrical 2,5&#8208;diarylpyrroles.

         <title>Wittig Reaction in Deep Eutectic Solvents: Expanding the DES Toolbox in Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Wittig reaction was performed in Deep Eutectic Solvents with high yields, wide scope, facile TPPO (triphenyl phosphine oxide) removal and scalability of the process.







Abstract
Wittig reaction between substituted phosphonium salts and (hetero)aromatic and alkyl carbonyl compounds in Deep Eutectic Solvents has been developed under a scalable and friendly protocol. Highly efficient reactions were successfully run with a wide range of bases including organic (DBU, LiTMP, t&#8208;BuOK) and inorganic (NaOH, K2CO3) ones in ChCl/Gly 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 (mol/mol) as solvent under mild conditions, at room temperature and under air. The proposed protocol was applied to a wide range of substrates, including (hetero)aromatic aldehydes with substituents as halogens (I, Br, Cl), EDG (alkoxy, methyl), EWG (NO2, CF3) or reactive groups as CN, esters, and ketones. Vinylic, alkynyl and cycloalkyl, alicyclic and &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes can also be used. Highly electrophilic ketones gave good yields. The diastereoselectivity of the reaction is in complete agreement with the E/Z ratio predictable under traditional conditions. We demonstrated that the protocol is scalable to 2&#8197;g (5&#8197;mmol) of phosphonium salt, furthermore the proposed workup protocol allows to remove TPPO without need of additional chromatographic purification.

         <title>Monomeric Fe(III)&#8208;Hydroxo and Fe(III)&#8208;Aqua Complexes Display Oxidative Asynchronous Hydrogen Atom Abstraction Reactivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper presents the lipoxygenase&#8208;like activity of monomeric [FeIII(L5R)(OH)]1+ and [FeIII(L5R)(OH2)]2+ complexes (R=OMe, H, Cl, NO2), employing linoleic acid as a substrate. The rate&#8208;limiting step involves hydrogen atom transfer from linoleic acid to the &#8220;FeIII&#8722;OH&#8220;/&#8221;FeIII&#8722;OH2&#8220; complexes via an oxidative asynchronous concerted proton&#8208;electron transfer (CPET) pathway. The higher degree of asynchronicity in CPET within aqua complexes enhances the rate by approximately five&#8208;fold compared to hydroxo analogs.







Abstract
This paper presents the synthesis and characterization of a series of novel monomeric aqua&#8208;ligated iron(III) complexes, [FeIII(L5R)(OH2)]2+ (R=OMe, H, Cl, NO2), supported by an amide&#8208;containing pentadentate N5 donor ligand, L5R [HL5R=2&#8208;(((1&#8208;methyl&#8208;1H&#8208;imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)methyl)(pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl&#8208;methyl)amino)&#8208;N&#8208;(5&#8208;R&#8208;quinolin&#8208;8&#8208;yl)acetamide]. The complexes were characterized by various spectroscopic and analytical techniques, including electrochemistry and magnetic measurements. The Fe(III)&#8208;hydroxo complexes, [FeIII(L5R)(OH)]1+, were generated in&#8197;situ by deprotonating the corresponding aqua complexes in a pH ~7 aqueous medium. In another way, adding one equivalent of a base to a methanolic solution of the Fe(III)&#8208;aqua complexes also produced the Fe(III)&#8208;hydroxo complexes. The study uses linoleic fatty acid as a substrate to explore the hydrogen atom abstraction (HAA) reactivity of both hydroxo and aqua complexes. The investigation highlights the substitution effect of the L5R ligand on reactivity, revealing a higher rate when an electron&#8208;withdrawing group is present. Hammett analyses and(or) determination of the asynchronicity factor (&#951;) suggest an oxidative asynchronous concerted proton&#8208;electron transfer (CPET) pathway for the HAA reactions. Aqua complexes exhibited a higher asynchronicity in CPET, resulting in higher reaction rates than their hydroxo analogs. Overall, the work provides insights into the beneficial role of a higher imbalance in electron&#8208;transfer&#8208;proton&#8208;transfer (ET&#8208;PT) contributions in HAA reactivity.

         <title>Pillar[5]arene&#8208;Based Ion&#8208;Pair Recognition for Encapsulation of a Stilbazolium&#8208;Type Dye with Enhanced Photophysical Properties and Nonlinear Optical Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pillar[5]arene is used as an ion&#8208;pair receptor for the modulation of both the crystalline&#8208;state packing and photophysical properties of a dye guest. The host&#8722;guest complex cocrystals formed from this pillar[5]arene receptor and the dye guest not only show enhanced solid&#8208;state photoluminescence quantum yields compared to dye crystals, but also possess second harmonic generation activity.







Abstract
Constructing organic composite materials through molecular recognition has emerged as an important theme in materials science. Here we report an ion&#8208;pair recognition system involving the use of a propoxylated pillar[5]arene (PrP5) to modulate the solid&#8208;state photophysical properties of dye trans&#8208;4&#8217;&#8208;(dimethylamino)&#8208;N&#8208;methyl&#8208;4&#8208;stilbazolium hexafluorophosphate (DMASP). Single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis reveals that the dye guest DMASP is encapsulated by PrP5 to form a 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 host&#8722;guest complex 2PrP5&#11815;DMASP in the crystalline state. The macrocyclic skeleton of PrP5 imposes restrictions on the intramolecular motions of the dye guest, leading to a significant enhancement of its fluorescence emission. Additionally, within the 2PrP5&#11815;DMASP complex crystal structure, DMASP molecules are found to display two possible opposite orientations in the one&#8208;dimensional channels formed by PrP5 molecules. This arrangement is believed to alter the overall solid&#8208;state packing structure of DMASP, thereby activating its nonlinear optical activity. This work not only reports a novel ion&#8208;pair molecular recognition system based on pillararenes but also provides valuable insights into the modulation of the crystalline state photophysical properties of organic dyes via cocrystal engineering.

         <title>The Influence of Disulfide, Thioacetal and Lanthionine&#8208;Bridges on the Conformation of a Macrocyclic Peptide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Does the bridge matter? We have compared the solution conformations of lanthionine, disulfide and thioacetal&#8208;bridged cyclic analogues of angiotensin(1&#8211;7). Despite the different bridging structures, the major conformations are found to be conserved for the macrocyclic core.







Abstract
Cyclisation of peptides by forming thioether (lanthionine), disulfide (cystine) or methylene thioacetal bridges between side chains is established as an important tool to stabilise a given structure, enhance metabolic stability and optimise both potency and selectivity. However, a systematic comparative study of the effects of differing bridging modalities on peptide conformation has not previously been carried out. In this paper, we have used the NMR deconvolution algorithm, NAMFIS, to determine the conformational ensembles, in aqueous solution, of three cyclic analogues of angiotensin(1&#8211;7), incorporating either disulfide, or non&#8208;reducible thioether or methylene thioacetal bridges. We demonstrate that the major solution conformations are conserved between the different bridged peptides, but the distribution of conformations differs appreciably. This suggests that subtle differences in ring size and bridging structure can be exploited to fine&#8208;tune the conformational properties of cyclic peptides, which may modulate their bioactivities.

Abstract
Complex oxides Eu2MeO6 (Me&#8211;Mo, W), Eu2W2O9 were obtained by a solid&#8208;phase reaction between binary oxides. The thermodynamic and kinetic mechanisms of the reaction processes were established using a variety of physical&#8208;chemical methods. All compounds obtained in this work crystallize in the low&#8208;symmetry monoclinic system, forming complex framework structures, which determine a set of very valuable physical&#8208;chemical properties. Comparison of experimental Kubelka&#8208;Munk functions and DFT&#8208; calculated absorption spectra shows adequate agreement and reveals the origin of the fundamental absorption. In addition, the deficiency in DFT calculations in the part of mutual contribution of CTBs of Mo&#8722;O and W&#8722;O, from one side, and Eu&#8722;O contributions, from the other side, is reported. Calculations of absorption spectra are shown to be superior to band structure analysis in the determination of optical band gaps. Additionally, luminescent properties of Eu2MeO6 and Eu2W2O9 compounds were investigated. These studies provide a better understanding of the electronic and optical properties of the compounds Eu2MeO6 and Eu2W2O9, along with their potential applications in various areas.

We described a copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed atom&#8208;economic and highly chemo&#8208;selective hydroamination&#8208;cyclization of alkynyl&#8208;tethered quinazolinones to prepare a variety of indole&#8208;fused pyrazino[1,2&#8208;a]quinazolinones in good to excellent yields under mild reaction conditions.







Abstract
We described a copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed atom economic and selective hydroamination&#8208;cyclization of alkynyl&#8208;tethered quinazolinones to prepare a variety of indole&#8208;fused pyrazino[1,2&#8208;a]quinazolinones in good to excellent yields ranging from 39&#8201;%&#8211;99&#8201;% under mild reaction conditions. Control experiments revealed that coordination&#8208;directed method of quinazolinone moiety with copper(I) was important for the selective hydroamination&#8208;cyclization of alkynes at the N1&#8208;atom instead of N3&#8208;atom of quinazolinone. The reaction could be easily performed at gram scales and some prepared indole&#8208;fused pyrazino[1,2&#8208;a]quinazolinones with donating groups on the indole moiety showed a distinct fluorescence emission wavelength with blue shift under the acid conditions.

         <title>Excited&#8208;State Dynamics in Segregated Donor&#8208;Acceptor Stacks Versus a Peri&#8208;Bisdonor&#8208;Acceptor System</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Delocalized excitation in the segregated stacks of the naphthalenemonoimide&#8208;perylene based donor&#8208;acceptor system (NI&#8208;Pe) is reported. In the monomer of the fork&#8208;shaped bisdonor&#8208;acceptor system (NI&#8208;Pe2) with intrinsic close&#8208;stacked perylene donors, a long&#8208;lived charge&#8208;separated (CS) state is observed in non&#8208;polar solvents. The CS state involves a delocalized perylene dimer radical cation engendered by the peri&#8208;perylene interactions in NI&#8208;Pe2.







Abstract
The investigation of impact of through&#8208;space/through&#8208;bond electronic interaction among chromophores on photoexcited&#8208;state properties has immense potential owing to the distinct emergent photophysical pathways. Herein, the photoexcited&#8208;state dynamics of homo&#8208;sorted &#960;&#8208;stacked aggregates of a naphthalenemonoimide and perylene&#8208;based acceptor&#8208;donor (NI&#8208;Pe) system and a fork&#8208;shaped acceptor&#8208;bisdonor (NI&#8208;Pe2) system possessing integrally stacked peri&#8208;substituted donors was examined. Femtosecond transient absorption (fsTA) spectra of NI&#8208;Pe monomer recorded in chloroform displayed spectroscopic signatures of the singlet state of Pe; 1Pe*, the charge&#8208;separated state; NI&#8722;&#8901;&#8208;Pe+&#8901;, and the triplet state of Pe; 3Pe*. The examination of ultrafast excited&#8208;state processes of NI&#8208;Pe aggregate in chloroform revealed faster charge recombination (

         <title>Photoinduced Transition&#8208;Metal and External Photosensitizer Free Benzylic Fluorination of Unactivated Alkylarenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photocatalytic monofluorination of unactivated alkylarenes, potentially initiated via a single&#8208;electron transfer, offers a highly efficient and selective pathway with excellent substrate compatibility, enabling the scale&#8208;up synthesis of pharmaceutical molecules. Omitting transition&#8208;metal catalysts and photosensitizers simplifies late&#8208;stage drug modification and the purification process.







Abstract
A green and efficient protocol for the direct monofluorination of unactivated alkylarenes under visible&#8208;light irradiation has been developed, without any extraneous transition&#8208;metal catalysts or photosensitizers. This method is compatible with a broad spectrum of functional groups, including carboxylic and alcoholic scaffolds, under mild reaction conditions. Gram&#8208;scale synthesis of a fluorine&#8208;containing pharmaceutical analogue was successfully executed, underscoring the strategy's reliability and practicality. Furthermore, mechanistic studies suggest that a single&#8208;electron transfer mechanism might be responsible for the generation of the benzylic radicals in initiation step.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Catalytic Metal&#8208;Based Homogeneous&#8208;Heterogeneous Systems in Organic Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this concept article we provide examples where metal&#8208;based homogeneous and heterogeneous multi&#8208;catalytic systems cooperate to provide advantages over conventional catalytic systems, such as higher compatibility or increased sustainability. This simple, yet powerful strategy has an untapped potential to address important challenges in organic chemistry.







Abstract
The combination of metal&#8208;based homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts in the same reaction media is a powerful, yet relatively unexplored approach in organic chemistry. This strategy can address important limitations associated with purely homogeneous or heterogeneous catalysis such as the incompatibility of different catalytic species in solution, or the limited tunability of solid catalysts, respectively. Moreover, the facile reusability of the solid catalyst, contributes to increase the overall sustainability of the process. As a result, this semi&#8208;heterogeneous multi&#8208;catalytic approach has unlocked significant advances in organic chemistry, improving existing reactions and even enabling the discovery of novel transformations, exemplified by the formal alkane metathesis. This concept article aims to showcase the benefits of this strategy through the exploration of diverse relevant examples from the literature, hoping to spur research on new metal&#8208;based homogeneous&#8208;heterogeneous catalyst combinations that will result in reactivity challenging to achieve by conventional homogeneous or heterogeneous catalysis alone.

         <title>Exploring the Esterase Catalytic Activity of Minimalist Heptapeptide Amyloid Fibers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The esterase activity of minimalist amyloid fibers, made up of seven&#8208;residue peptides IHIHIHI and IHIHIQI, is examined using computational techniques. Contrary to initial assumptions, computational simulations reveal that the twist angle of the fiber is not notably influenced by the sixth residue, the reduction in the energy barrier when Gln is present being attributed to the formation of hydrogen bonds with the substrate.







Abstract
This paper investigates the esterase activity of minimalist amyloid fibers composed of short seven&#8208;residue peptides, IHIHIHI (IH7) and IHIHIQI (IH7Q), with a particular focus on the role of the sixth residue position within the peptide sequence. Through computational simulations and analyses, we explore the molecular mechanisms underlying catalysis in these amyloid&#8208;based enzymes. Contrary to initial hypotheses, our study reveals that the twist angle of the fiber, and thus the catalytic site's environment, is not notably affected by the sixth residue. Instead, the sixth residue interacts with the p&#8208;nitrophenylacetate (pNPA) substrate, particularly through its &#8722;NO2 group, potentially enhancing catalysis. Quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) simulations of the reaction mechanism suggest that the polarizing effect of glutamine enhances catalytic activity by forming a stabilizing network of hydrogen bonds with pNPA, leading to lower energy barriers and a more exergonic reaction. Our findings provide valuable insights into the intricate interplay between peptide sequence, structural arrangement, and catalytic function in amyloid&#8208;based enzymes, offering potentially valuable information for the design and optimization of biomimetic catalysts.

Instead, the sixth residue interacts with the p-nitrophenylacetate (pNPA) substrate, particularly through its &#8722;NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; group, potentially enhancing catalysis. Quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) simulations of the reaction mechanism suggest that the polarizing effect of glutamine enhances catalytic activity by forming a stabilizing network of hydrogen bonds with pNPA, leading to lower energy barriers and a more exergonic reaction. Our findings provide valuable insights into the intricate interplay between peptide sequence, structural arrangement, and catalytic function in amyloid-based enzymes, offering potentially valuable information for the design and optimization of biomimetic catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Hydrogen Bonded Non&#8208;Porous Organic&#8208;Inorganic Framework for Measuring Cysteine in Blood Plasma and Endogenous Cancer Cell</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article reports the synthesis of a non&#8208;luminescent one&#8208;dimensional hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic&#8208;inorganic framework (HOIF) of Cu(II) and its affinity studies with cysteine. Cysteine measurement by HOIF has been validated using a commercial dye, &#8220;Cysteine Green&#8221;. The probe is suitable for measuring cysteine in plasma and bio&#8208;imaging endogenous cysteine in cancer cells.







Abstract
An imbalance in cysteine (Cys) levels in the cells and plasma has been identified as the risk indicator for various human diseases. The structural similarity of cysteine with its congener homocysteine and glutathione offers challenges in its measurement. Herein, we report a hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic&#8208;inorganic framework of Cu(II) (HOIF) for the selective detection of cysteine over other biothiols. The non&#8208;fluorescent HOIF showed 12&#8208;fold green emission in the presence of cysteine. The monomeric unit of HOIF is stabilized via intermolecular hydrogen bonds, resulting in a non&#8208;porous network structure. Non&#8208;interference from homocysteine, glutathione, and other competitive bio&#8208;analytes revealed explicit affinity of HOIF for cysteine. Fluorimetric titration showed a wide working concentration window (650&#8197;nM&#8211;800&#8197;&#956;M) for measuring cysteine in an aqueous medium. The mechanistic investigation involving HRMS, EPR, and UV&#8208;vis spectroscopic studies revealed the decomplexation of HOIF with Cys, resulting in a fluorescence turn&#8208;on response from the luminescent ligand. Validation using a commercial dye, &#8220;Cysteine Green&#8221;, confirmed the prospect of HOIF for early diagnostic purposes. Utilizing the fluorescence turn&#8208;on property of HOIF in the presence of cysteine, we measured cysteine quantitatively in the blood plasma samples. Bio&#8208;imaging of endogenous cysteine in cancer cells indicated the ability of HOIF to monitor the intracellular cysteine.

         <title>Reproducible Green Syntheses Using Hybrid Sol&#8208;Gel Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aiming to contribute to eradicate a certain naivet&#233; common to many research chemists specializing in green chemistry and catalysis, this study illustrates through selected examples of reproducible green syntheses using hybrid sol&#8208;gel catalysts from doctoral theses and research articles published between 2013 and early 2024, how said catalysts have been applied to a number industrially relevant green synthetic methods.







Abstract
Referring to selected examples of reproducible green syntheses using hybrid sol&#8208;gel catalysts of the SiliaCat series from different doctoral theses and research works published between 2015 and early 2024, this study briefly illustrates how said catalysts have been applied in a number of green synthetic methods of significant industrial relevance. This shows evidence that the nanochemistry &#8220;bottom&#8208;up&#8221; sol&#8208;gel approach based on catalytic species entrapped in organically modified silicas as effective and versatile heterogeneous catalysts developed between the late 1990s and 2010 has succeeded. Subsequent developments will show how the use of said materials in automated syntheses, supplying data to machine learning algorithms actually leads to faster and cheaper optimization of the reaction conditions. Said progress ultimately will further accelerate industrial uptake of heterogeneous catalysis under flow in the fine chemical industry whose reluctance to change processes was due to the need to replace financially amortized (and expensive) production plants.

         <dc:description>The fluorination of the central ring of 1,3,5&#8208;benzene&#8208;tris&#8208;(meta&#8208;benzoate) (referred to as BTMB) leads to a twisted tritopic linker which reacts with copper(II) ions to assemble into octahedral (pseudospherical) metal&#8208;organic cages (MOCs) with paddle wheel units at their vertices. In this work, the different sphere packings of these MOCs are explored in detail together with their material properties, which closely resemble those of copper&#8208;based metal organic frameworks (MOFs).

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study explores the electrochemical properties of the carbonaceous Allende CV3 meteorite, focusing on its potential as a Fe&#8208;based catalyst derived from Mackinawite iron sulfide for electrocatalytic reactions facilitating nitrogen (N2) fixation into ammonia. Through comprehensive analysis, we not only monitored the evolution of key compounds such as CN&#8208;, sulfur/H2S, H2 and carbonyl compounds, but also identified potential reagent carriers, indicating significant implications for the Strecker synthesis of amino acids in space environments. Initial examination revealed the presence of polypeptides, notably sequences including trimer Gly3, pentamer Gly3&#8208;Ala2, and hexamer Gly4&#8208;(HO&#8208;Gly)2. These discoveries greatly enhance our understanding of astrobiological chemistry, offering valuable insights into prebiotic processes and the potential presence of life&#8208;building blocks throughout the universe.</dc:description>

         <title>Quantitative Reactivity Models for Oxidative Addition to L2Pd(0): Additional Substrate Classes, Solvents, and Mechanistic Insights</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Quantitative molecular structure&#8208;reactivity models are useful for generating predictions to guide synthesis design, and in formulating and testing mechanistic hypotheses. We report an expanded multivariate linear regression (MLR) model for the rate of (hetero)aryl (pseudo)halide oxidative addition to L2Pd(0), here exemplified by Pd(PCy3)2. This builds on a prior model from our group, with additional substrate classes (aryl chlorides and iodides) and reaction solvents (THF, toluene, THF/DMF mixture). Overall solvent effects across the entire substrate set are minimal under these conditions, enabling a unified MLR model without introduction of new molecular descriptors beyond the original five. Examining the mechanistic origin of the two molecular electrostatic potential (ESP) descriptors led to generation of a simpler, four descriptor model that is suitable for aryl halides, but not for 2&#8208;halopyridines. Using this model we identified a mechanistic outlier, 2&#8208;pyridyl triflate, which undergoes a nucleophilic displacement oxidative addition that does not involve the adjacent nitrogen atom. Finally, we discuss the relationship between C&#8211;X bond strength and oxidative addition rates, and compare the intrinsic bond strength index (IBSI) to bond dissociation enthalpy (BDE) as a bond strength descriptor.</dc:description>

         <title>Interrogating Explicit Solvent Effects on the Mechanism and Site&#8208;Selectivity of Aryl Halide Oxidative Addition to L2Pd(0)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a study of solvent effects on the rate, selectivity, and mechanism of (hetero)aryl (pseudo)halide oxidative addition to Pd(PCy3)2 as an exemplar of L2Pd(0) species. First, 2&#8208;chloro&#8208;3&#8208;aminopyridine is observed to undergo faster oxidative addition in toluene compared to more polar solvents, which is not consistent with the trend we observe with many other 2&#8208;halopyridines. We attribute this to solvent basicity hydrogen&#8208;bonding (pKHB) between solvent and substrate. Greater hydrogen&#8208;bond donation from the substrate leads to a more electron&#8208;rich aromatic system, and therefore slower oxidative addition. We demonstrate how this affects rate and site&#8208;selectivity for hydrogen&#8208;bond donating substrates. Second, electron&#8208;deficient multihalogenated pyridines exhibit improved site&#8208;selectivity in polar solvents, which we attribute to different C&#8211;X sites undergoing oxidative addition by two different mechanisms. The C&#8211;X site that favours the more polar nucleophilic displacement transition state is preferred over the site that favours a less&#8208;polar 3&#8208;centered transition state. Finally, (hetero)aryl triflates consistently undergo faster oxidative addition in more polar solvents, which we attribute to highly polar nucleophilic displacement transition states. This leads to improved site&#8208;selectivity for C&#8211;OTf oxidative addition, even in the presence of highly reactive 2&#8208;pyridylhalides.</dc:description>

First, 2-chloro-3-aminopyridine is observed to undergo faster oxidative addition in toluene compared to more polar solvents, which is not consistent with the trend we observe with many other 2-halopyridines. We attribute this to solvent basicity hydrogen-bonding (pKHB) between solvent and substrate. Greater hydrogen-bond donation from the substrate leads to a more electron-rich aromatic system, and therefore slower oxidative addition. We demonstrate how this affects rate and site-selectivity for hydrogen-bond donating substrates. Second, electron-deficient multihalogenated pyridines exhibit improved site-selectivity in polar solvents, which we attribute to different C&#8211;X sites undergoing oxidative addition by two different mechanisms. The C&#8211;X site that favours the more polar nucleophilic displacement transition state is preferred over the site that favours a less-polar 3-centered transition state. Finally, (hetero)aryl triflates consistently undergo faster oxidative addition in more polar solvents, which we attribute to highly polar nucleophilic displacement transition states. This leads to improved site-selectivity for C&#8211;OTf oxidative addition, even in the presence of highly reactive 2-pyridylhalides.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Facile Method to Obtain Functionalised &#951;6&#8208;Bound Arenes in Ru(II) and Os(II) Half&#8208;Sandwich Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Half&#8208;sandwich Ru(II)&#8208; and Os(II)&#8208;arene complexes have great potential for catalytic and biological applications. The possibility of fine&#8208;tuning their chemical reactivity by including modifications in the ligands around the metal adds to their many advantages. However, structural modifications at the n6&#8208;bound arene have had significant synthetic limitations, particularly in the design of Os(II)&#8208;tethered complexes. For the first time, we have employed a practical C(sp3)&#8208;C(sp2) coupling to obtain 28 new Ru(II) and Os(II) &#951;6&#8208;arene half&#8208;sandwich complexes with a wide variety of arene functionalities, including those that enable the formation of tether rings, such as quinoline and coumarin. The introduction of novel functional groups at the arene in Ru(II)&#8208; and Os(II) half&#8208;sandwich complexes can broaden the synthetic scope of this type of organometallic complexes, and help to take full advantage of their structural diversity, especially in intracellular catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>NMR screen reveals the diverse structural landscape of a G&#8208;quadruplex library</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>G&#8208;quadruplexes are noncanonical nucleic acid structures formed by stacked guanine tetrads.&#160;Despite their functional and structural diversity, a single consensus model is typically used to describe sequences with the potential to form G&#8208;quadruplex structures. We are interested in developing more specific sequence models for G&#8208;quadruplexes. In previous work, we functionally characterized each sequence in a 496&#8208;member library of variants of a monomeric reference G&#8208;quadruplex for the ability to bind GTP, promote a model peroxidase reaction, generate intrinsic fluorescence, and to form multimers. Here we used NMR to obtain a broad overview of the structural features of this library. After determining the&#160;1H NMR spectrum of each of these 496 sequences, spectra were sorted into multiple classes, most of which could be rationalized based on mutational patterns in the primary sequence. A more detailed screen using representative sequences provided additional information about spectral classes, and confirmed that the classes determined based on analysis of&#160;1H NMR spectra are correlated with functional categories identified in previous studies. These results provide new insights into the surprising structural diversity of this library. They also show how NMR can be used to identify classes of sequences with distinct mutational signatures and functions.</dc:description>

         <title>Neutral Adducts of Molybdenum Hexafluoride Structure and Bonding in MoF6(NC5H5) and MoF6(NC5H5)2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first Lewis acid base adducts of MoF6 and an organic base have been synthesized, i.e., MoF6(NC5H5) and MoF6(NC5H5)2. These adducts are structurally characterized with X&#8208;ray crystallography, showing that both adducts adopt capped trigonal prismatic structures. The MoF6(NC5H5) and MoF6(NC5H5)2 adducts are fluxional on the NMR time scale at room temperature. Two different fluorine environments could be resolved by 19F NMR spectroscopy at &#8211;80 &#176;C for the 1:2 adduct, MoF6(NC5H5)2, whereas MoF6(NC5H5) remains fluxional at that temperature. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations aide the assignment of the infrared and Raman spectra. Natural Bond Order and Molecular Electrostatic Potential analyses elucidate the structures and properties of the MoF6 pyridine adducts. Regions of significantly higher molecular electrostatic potential, i.e., &#963;&#8208;holes, in trigonal prismatic compared to octahedral MoF6 rationalize the capped trigonal prismatic geometry of the adducts. Whereas MoF6(NC5H5) is stable at room temperature under exclusion of moisture, MoF6(NC5H5)2 decomposes at 60 &#176;C in pyridine solvent, and the solid slowly decomposes at room temperature after 24 h.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Method for the Selective Synthesis of Amides and N&#8208;Acylureas from Carboxylic Acids and Thioureas</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, we developed a visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven method for the selective synthesis of amides and N&#8208;acylureas from carboxylic acids and thioureas. This protocol was featured as avoidance of additional oxidants and transition metal catalysts, simple manipulations, low cost, broad substrate scope, and good functional group tolerance. As only oxygen serves as the oxidation reagent, this method provides a promising synthesis candidate for the formation of N&#8208;aryl amides and N&#8208;acylureas, including late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex pharmaceutical molecules and biologically active molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Constructing Cyclic Hydrogen Bonding to Suppress Side Reactions and Dendrite Formation on Zinc Anodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The high electrochemical reactivity of H2O molecules and zinc metal results in severe side reactions and dendrite formation on zinc anodes. Here we demonstrate that these issues can be addressed by using N&#8208;hydroxymethylacetamide (NHA) as additives in 2 M ZnSO4 electrolytes. The addition of NHA molecules, acting as both a hydrogen bond donor and acceptor, enables the formation of cyclic hydrogen bonding with H2O molecules. This interaction disrupts the existing hydrogen bonding networks between H2O molecules, hindering proton transport, and containing H2O molecules within the cyclic hydrogen bonding structure to prevent deprotonation. Additionally, NHA molecules show a preference for adsorption on the (101) crystal surface of zinc metal. This preferential adsorption reduces the surface energy of the (101) plane, facilitating the homogeneous Zn deposition along the (101) direction. Thus, the NHA enables Zn||Zn symmetric cell with a cycle lifespan of 1100 hours at 5 mA cm&#8722;2 and Zn||Cu asymmetric cell with a high Coulombic efficiency over 99.5%. Moreover, the NHA&#8208;modified Zn||AC zinc ion hybrid capacitor is capable of sustaining 15000 cycles at 2 A g&#8722;1. This electrolyte additive engineering presents a promising strategy to enhance the performance and broaden the application potential of zinc metal&#8208;based energy storage devices.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular chemistry achieves higher&#8208;order molecular self&#8208;assembly through non&#8208;covalent interactions. Utilizing supramolecular methods to explore the polymorphism of proteins, the building blocks of life, from a "bottom&#8208;up" perspective is essential for constructing diverse and functional biomaterials. In recent years, significant progress has been achieved in the design strategies and functional applications of supramolecular protein self&#8208;assembly, becoming a focal point for researchers. This paper reviews classical supramolecular strategies driving protein self&#8208;assembly, including electrostatic interactions, metal coordination, hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic interactions, host&#8208;guest interactions, and other mechanisms. We discuss how these supramolecular interactions regulate protein assembly processes and highlight protein supramolecular assemblies' unique structural and functional advantages in constructing artificial photosynthetic systems, protein hydrogels, bio&#8208;delivery systems, and other functional materials. The enormous potential and significance of supramolecular protein materials are elucidated. Finally, the challenges in preparing and applying protein supramolecular assemblies are summarized, and future development directions are projected.</dc:description>

         <title>Gold Meets Selenium: Dual Activation of Selenium&#8208;Containing Propargyl Alcohols Towards the Synthesis of 2H&#8208;Chromenes and Mechanistic Insights</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report the synthesis of seleno&#8208;substituted chromenes from selenoalkynes and phenols. In this cascade reaction, the applied gold catalyst not only functions as a p&#8208;acid, but also as a Lewis acid, enabling the propargylic substitution in the first step to connect the oxygen carbon bond. Under the optimal reaction condition a total of 26 chromenes were accessible by this modular access. During scale up experiments, the hydrolysis of the vinylselenium substructure to the corresponding chromenones was observed. By revisiting the electron&#8208;rich starting materials, four chromenones were produced following a one&#8208;pot reaction using a single gold catalyst. To better understand the interaction of gold and selenium, a series of nuclear magnetic resonance studies and high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry studies were performed, which led to the proposal of a mechanism for this transformation</dc:description>

         <title>Probing Basal and Prismatic Planes of Graphitic Materials for Metal Single Atom and Subnanometer Cluster Stabilization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The detection of small quantities of metal clusters in single atom catalysts remains a challenge even when combining electron microscopy (EM), X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The results obtained demonstrate that Rh single atoms are mainly present on materials presenting prismatic surface, and that catalysis itself constitutes a valuable tool for the characterization of these materials.







Abstract
Supported metal single atom catalysis is a dynamic research area in catalysis science combining the advantages of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis. Understanding the interactions between metal single atoms and the support constitutes a challenge facing the development of such catalysts, since these interactions are essential in optimizing the catalytic performance. For conventional carbon supports, two types of surfaces can contribute to single atom stabilization: the basal planes and the prismatic surface; both of which can be decorated by defects and surface oxygen groups. To date, most studies on carbon&#8208;supported single atom catalysts focused on nitrogen&#8208;doped carbons, which, unlike classic carbon materials, have a fairly well&#8208;defined chemical environment. Herein we report the synthesis, characterization and modeling of rhodium single atom catalysts supported on carbon materials presenting distinct concentrations of surface oxygen groups and basal/prismatic surface area. The influence of these parameters on the speciation of the Rh species, their coordination and ultimately on their catalytic performance in hydrogenation and hydroformylation reactions is analyzed. The results obtained show that catalysis itself is an interesting tool for the fine characterization of these materials, for which the detection of small quantities of metal clusters remains a challenge, even when combining several cutting&#8208;edge analytical methods.

         <title>Highly Graphitized Coal Tar Pitch&#8208;Derived Porous Carbon as High&#8208;Performance Lithium Storage Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report that excellent porous carbon materials are obtained by modulating different proportions of coal tar pitch and nano&#8208;calcium carbonate powder (CTP&#8722;X). CTP&#8208;2 exhibits excellent cycling and multiplication performance when used as an anode for LIBs, and is expected to be used as an electrode material for the next generation LIBs.







Abstract
Because of its high specific capacity and superior rate performance, porous carbon is regarded as a potential anode material for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). However, porous carbon materials with wide pore diameter distributions suffer from low structural stability and low electrical conductivity during the application process. During this study, the calcium carbonate nanoparticle template method is used to prepare coal tar pitch&#8208;derived porous carbon (CTP&#8722;X). The coal tar pitch&#8208;derived porous carbon has a well&#8208;developed macroporous&#8208;mesoporous&#8208;microporous hierarchical porous network structure, which provides abundant active sites for Li+ storage, significantly reduces polarization and charge transfer resistance, shortens the diffusion path and promotes the rapid transport of Li+. More specifically, the CTP&#8208;2 anode shows high charge capacity (496.9&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 50&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1), excellent rate performance (413.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 even at 500&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1), and high cycling stability (capacity retention rate of about 100&#8201;% after 1,000 cycles at 2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1). The clean and eco&#8208;friendly large&#8208;scale utilization of coal tar pitch will facilitate the development of high&#8208;performance anodes in the field of LIBs.

         <title>Active Site Environment and Reactivity of Copper&#8208;A&#946; in Membrane Mimetic SDS Micellar Environment</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Copper interacts with A&#946; peptides in membrane&#8208;mimicking SDS micellar environments, forming Cu&#8208;A&#946; complexes that induce higher hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production. Moreover, we observe an increased oxidation rate of neurotransmitter such as dopamine in the presence of H2O2 by Cu&#8208;A&#946; complexes.







Abstract
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the abnormal aggregation of amyloid &#946; (A&#946;) peptide in extracellular deposits generated upon proteolysis of Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP). While copper (Cu(II)) binds to A&#946; in soluble oligomeric and aggregated forms, its interaction with membrane&#8208;bound A&#946; remains elusive. Investigating these interactions is crucial for understanding AD pathogenesis. Here, utilizing SDS micelles as a simplified membrane mimic, we focus on elucidating the interplay between membrane&#8208;anchored A&#946; and copper, given their pivotal roles in AD. We employed spectroscopic techniques including UV, CD, and EPR to characterize the active site of Cu&#8208;A&#946; complexes. Our findings demonstrate that copper interacts with A&#946; peptides in membrane&#8208;mimicking micellar environments similarly to aqueous buffer solutions. Cu&#8208;A&#946; complexes in this medium also induce higher hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production, potentially contributing to AD&#8208;related oxidative stress. Moreover, we observe an increased oxidation rate of neurotransmitter such as dopamine by Cu&#8208;A&#946; complexes. These results enhance our understanding of Cu&#8208;A&#946; interactions in AD pathology and offer insights into potential therapeutic interventions targeting this interaction.

         <title>Thiolated Cyanines Appended to Partially Pegylated Gold Nanoparticles for Fluorescence Quenching of Two&#8208;Channel Photothermal Inks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyanine dyes equipped with a thiolated bridge are non&#8208;fluorescent when grafted on partially&#8208;pegilated Au nanoparticles. The cyanine/AuNP pegilated hybrids can be dissolved in water/alcohol mixtures to give nanoinks, whose printouts display two photothermally responsive absorption bands, that give different T increases when laser&#8208;irradiated.







Abstract
Following a new approach, we prepared a nanoink with two separate photothermally responsive absorption bands. One is the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) absorption of gold nanoparticles (AuNP, d=17&#8197;nm), the second is the absorption band of two cyanine (Cy) dyes, Cy7&#8208;C6 or Cy7&#8208;C11, grafted to the AuNP surface through thiolated bridges of different lengths: the close proximity to the Au surface induces full quenching of the Cy fluorescence, resulting in thermal relaxation on irradiation. Attempts to full coat AuNP with the lipophilic Cy7&#8208;C6 and Cy7&#8208;C11 lead to precipitation from aqueous solutions. We thus prepared AuNP with partial pegylation (30, 50, or 70&#8201;%), using a long chain thiol&#8208;terminated PEG bearing a &#8208;COOH function. Addition until saturation of either Cy7&#8208;C6 or Cy7&#8208;C11 to the partially pegylated AuNP gave the AuNP@Cy/PEGX% hybrids (X=30, 50, 70) that are stable in water and in the water/alcohol mixtures used to prepare the nanoinks. Further overcoating of AuNP@Cy7&#8208;C6/PEG50&#8201;% with PAH (polyallylamine hydrochloride) avoids LSPR hybridization in the dry nanoink printouts, that present two separate bands. When irradiated with laser sources near their absorption maxima, the printouts of the AuNP@Cy7&#8208;C6/PEG50&#8201;%@PAH nanoink respond on two channels, giving different temperature increases depending on the irradiation wavelengths. This enhances the potentiality of use of these nanoinks for photothermal anticounterfait printouts, making more difficult to reproduce the correct &#916;T vs &#955;irradiation output.

Addition until saturation of either &lt;b&gt;Cy7-C6&lt;/b&gt; or &lt;b&gt;Cy7-C11&lt;/b&gt; to the partially pegylated AuNP gave the AuNP@&lt;b&gt;Cy&lt;/b&gt;/PEG&lt;sub&gt;X%&lt;/sub&gt; hybrids (X=30, 50, 70) that are stable in water and in the water/alcohol mixtures used to prepare the nanoinks. Further overcoating of AuNP@&lt;b&gt;Cy7-C6&lt;/b&gt;/PEG&lt;sub&gt;50&#8201;%&lt;/sub&gt; with PAH (polyallylamine hydrochloride) avoids LSPR hybridization in the dry nanoink printouts, that present two separate bands. When irradiated with laser sources near their absorption maxima, the printouts of the AuNP@&lt;b&gt;Cy7-C6&lt;/b&gt;/PEG&lt;sub&gt;50&#8201;%&lt;/sub&gt;@PAH nanoink respond on two channels, giving different temperature increases depending on the irradiation wavelengths. This enhances the potentiality of use of these nanoinks for photothermal anticounterfait printouts, making more difficult to reproduce the correct &#916;T vs &#955;&lt;sub&gt;irradiation&lt;/sub&gt; output.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Novel Fluorescent Gemcitabine Prodrug That Follows a Nucleoside Transporter&#8208;Independent Internalization and Bears Enhanced Therapeutic Efficacy With Respect to Gemcitabine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fluorescent prodrug, named GF, based on gemcitabine and 5(6)&#8208;carboxyfluorescein was developed in a single step. GF follows a nucleoside transporter&#8208;independent endocytosis internalization mechanism, surpassing a key resistance mechanism against gemcitabine. Its pharmacokinetic profile and drug release efficiency were evaluated in mice, and eventually its visualization was achieved in zebrafish and its tumor inhibition was monitored in A549 xenografted mice.







Abstract
The multiplexity of cancer has rendered it the second leading cause of mortality worldwide and theragnostic prodrugs have gained popularity in recent years as a means of treatment. Theragnostic prodrugs enable the simultaneous diagnosis and therapy of tumors via high&#8208;precision real&#8208;time drug release monitoring. Herein, we report the development of the small theragnostic prodrug GF, based on the nucleoside anticancer agent gemcitabine and the fluorescent dye 5(6)&#8208;carboxyfluorescein. We have successfully demonstrated its efficient internalization in tumor cells, showing localization throughout both the early and late endocytic pathways. Its mechanism of cell internalization was evaluated, confirming its independence from nucleoside transporters. Its cellular localization via confocal microscopy revealed a clathrin&#8208;mediated endocytosis mechanism, distinguishing it from analogous compounds studied previously. Furthermore, GF exhibited stability across various pH values and in human blood plasma. Subsequently, its in&#8197;vitro cytotoxicity was assessed in three human cancer cell lines (A549, U87 and T98). Additionally, its pharmacokinetic profile in mice was investigated and the consequent drug release was monitored. Finally, its in&#8197;vivo visualization was accomplished in zebrafish xenotransplantation models and its in&#8197;vivo efficacy was evaluated in A549 xenografts. The results unveiled an intriguing efficacy profile, positioning GF as a compelling candidate warranting further investigation.

         <title>Contact Electrification as an Emerging Strategy for Controlling the Performance of Metal Nanoparticle Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
As modern technology enters the era of nanomaterials, the contact electrification, as a classic physical phenomenon, brings new ideas for studying the interactions between metal nanoparticles. The study of contact electrification phenomenon by classical theory shows that the Fermi level of materials before and after contact changes. This conclusion is further confirmed by modern characterization techniques, and this change in the Fermi level of materials is reflected in the field of catalysis, which can regulate the performance of catalysts in catalytic reactions.







Abstract
Contact electrification (CE) is an emerging strategy for controlling the performance of metal nanoparticle (NP) catalysts. The underlying physical principle of this control is the sensitivity of the Fermi level to metal&#8208;metal contacts. This change in electronic structure has a direct impact on surface properties and chemical reactivity. The concept article briefly introduces the basic theory of CE and its relationship to catalytic performance. We then highlight selected recent examples of advances in the preparation of hybrid metal NP assemblies, experimental techniques for characterizing CE, and finally applications of CE for altering catalytic performance.

This report presents an environmentally benign synthesis of 1,2,3&#8208;benzotriazines through an iodide&#8208;catalyzed electro&#8208;oxidative skeletal editing of 3&#8208;aminoindazoles. The method uses electrochemically generated reactive iodide species without involving any transition metal catalysts and peroxides. This mild reaction protocol exhibits a wide substrate scope with brad synthetic applicability. Detailed mechanistic studies elucidate a N&#8208;centered [1,2]&#8208;rearrangement as the key reaction step.

         <title>Gold Nanoclusters Whose Photoluminescent Properties are Dynamically Tunable by Modulating the Assembly Pathway Complexity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Gold nanoclusters (DPT&#8208;AuNCs) could self&#8208;assembles into two distinct aggregation structures in MeOH/water mixed solvent, exhibiting pathway complexity with different photoluminescent property. DPT&#8208;AuNCs firstly assembles into non&#8208;luminescent nanofibers (kinetically controlled), which further transforms into strongly luminescent microflowers (thermodynamically controlled).







Abstract
Modulating the assembly pathway is an indispensable strategy for optimizing the performance of optical materials. However, implementing this strategy is nontrivial for metal nanocluster building blocks, due to the limited functional modification of nanoclusters and complexity of their emission mechanism. In this report, we demonstrate that a gold nanocluster modified by 4,6&#8208;diamino&#8208;2&#8208;pyrimidinethiol (DPT&#8208;AuNCs) self&#8208;assembles into two distinct aggregation structures in methanol (MeOH)/water mixed solvent, thus exhibiting pathway complexity. Kinetic studies show that DPT&#8208;AuNCs firstly assembles into non&#8208;luminescent nanofibers (kinetically controlled), which further transforms into strongly luminescent microflowers (thermodynamically controlled). In&#8208;depth analysis of the assembly mechanism reveals that the transformation of aggregation structures involves the disassembly of nanofibers and a subsequent nucleation&#8208;growth process. Temperature&#8208;dependent photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy and infrared (IR) measurements reveal that inter&#8208;cluster hydrogen bonding bridged by solvent molecules and C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interaction are the key factors for emission enhancement. The photoluminescent property of DPT&#8208;AuNCs can be controlled by varying the cosolvent in water, enabling DPT&#8208;AuNCs to distinguish different kind of alcohols, particularly the isomerism n&#8208;propanol (NPA) and isopropanol (IPA). Additionally, the addition of seeds effectively regulate the assembly kinetics of DPT&#8208;AuNCs. This study advances our understanding of assembly pathways and improves the luminescent performance of nanoclusters (NCs).

         <title>Searching for &#8220;Greener&#8221; Bioequivalents of CF3 to Lower its Environmental Impact</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Considering concerns on the negative environmental effects of CF3 containing compounds, we searched for &#8220;greener&#8221; alternatives. We found &#8722;I as the best alternative since it is equivalent in all aspects studied, size, electronic and lipophilic, followed by &#8722;F, &#8208;cyclo&#8208;Pr, &#8722;2&#8208;oxetyl, &#8722;SF5 and &#8722;SCH3. We suggest using these functionalities as an alternative to &#8722;CF3 in the preparation of new therapies.







Abstract
Considering the broad use of the trifluoromethyl functional group (&#8722;CF3) in medicinal chemistry and taking into account the recent concerns on the negative environmental effects of CF3 containing compounds, we are searching for &#8220;greener&#8221; alternatives. Thus, different chemical groups (i.&#8201;e. iodide, fluoride, cyclopropyl, isopropyl, cyclobutyl, 3&#8208;oxetyl, 2&#8208;oxetyl, methylsulfide, pentafluorosulfide, methylsulfonyl and sulfonamide) have been considered as potential bioequivalents of &#8722;CF3 aiming to use them in compounds with therapeutic interest instead of the polyfluoride functionality. Different structural (molecular surface and volume) and physicochemical (electronic and lipophilic) aspects of the bioequivalent functionalities proposed have been theoretically calculated and compared to those of &#8722;CF3. Additionally, the corresponding phenyl derivatives carrying these functionalities have been purchased or prepared and their experimental lipophilicity (i.&#8201;e. LogP) measured using shake&#8208;flask experiments and UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy.

         <title>Stereochemically Active Lone Pairs Stabilizing Intrinsic Vacancy Defects in Thermoelectric InTe</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermoelectric InTe exhibits significant structural disorder in the form of In+ vacancies. Using 3D&#8208;&#916;PDF informed Monte&#8208;Carlo simulations we reveal the local structure associated with these defects. This structure allows the local expression of stereochemically active lone pairs with an associated electronic energy gain, which is proposed to be a driving force for the formation of the intrinsic vacancy defects.







Abstract
Harvesting waste heat efficiently with thermoelectric energy conversion requires materials with low thermal conductivity. Recently, it was demonstrated how dynamic lone pair expression in thermoelectric InTe is responsible for giant anharmonicity leading to a very low lattice thermal conductivity. InTe also contains correlated disorder of intrinsic defects due to vacancies, and this contributes to additional lowering of the thermal conductivity. Here we use the three&#8208;dimensional difference pair distribution function (3D&#8208;&#916;PDF) to analyze 25&#8197;K single crystal diffuse X&#8208;ray scattering from InTe to unravel the local defect structure, and propose a microscopic structural model. Extended off&#8208;centering of In+ ions induced by vacancies allows for the local expression of stereochemically active lone pairs. The associated electronic stabilization is proposed to be a driving force for the formation of In+ vacancy defects in InTe.

         <title>Electrochemical Decarboxylative Cross&#8208;Coupling with Nucleophiles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Direct electrochemical decarboxylative cross&#8208;coupling with nucleophiles has been developed for the synthesis of structurally diverse fluoride, alcohol, ether, ester, and amine products. This strategy takes advantage of the ready availability of these building blocks from commercial libraries, as well as the mild and oxidant&#8208;free conditions provided by the electrochemical system.







Abstract
Decarboxylative cross&#8208;coupling reactions are powerful tools for carbon&#8208;heteroatom bonds formation, but typically require pre&#8208;activated carboxylic acids as substrates or heteroelectrophiles as functional groups. Herein, we present an electrochemical decarboxylative cross&#8208;coupling of carboxylic acids with structurally diverse fluorine, alcohol, H2O, acid, and amine as nucleophiles. This strategy takes advantage of the ready availability of these building blocks from commercial libraries, as well as the mild and oxidant&#8208;free conditions provided by electrochemical system. This reaction demonstrates good functional&#8208;group tolerance and its utility in late&#8208;stage functionalization.

         <title>The Hybridization of Polymers with Metal Oxide Clusters for the Design of Non&#8208;Fluorinated Proton Exchange Membranes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cost&#8208;effective composite non&#8208;fluorinated proton exchange membranes (PEMs) with excellent overall performance are essential to realize the economical and efficient fabrication of fuel cells. Herein, we briefly discuss on design strategy, research progress, and application prospects of PEMs based on the polymer composites of nanoscale metal oxide clusters.







Abstract
As the key component of various energy storage and conversion devices, proton exchange membranes (PEMs) have been attracting significant interest. However, their further development is limited by the high cost of perfluorosulfonic acid polymers and the poor stability of acid&#8208;dopped non&#8208;fluorinated polymers. Recently, a new group of PEMs has been developed by hybridizing polyoxometalates (POMs), a group of super acidic sub&#8208;nanoscale metal oxide clusters, with polymers. POMs can serve simultaneously as both proton sponges and stabilizing agents, and their complexation with polymers can further improve polymers&#8217; mechanical performance and processability. Enormous efforts have been focused on studying supramolecular complexation or covalent grafting of POMs with various polymers to optimize PEMs in terms of cost, mechanical properties and stabilities. This concept summarizes recent advances in this emerging field and outlines the design strategies and application perspectives employed for using POM&#8208;polymer hybrid materials as PEMs.

Abstract
Bimetallic CpMM'Nacnac molecules with group 2 and 12 metals (M=Be, Mg, Ca, Zn, Cd, Hg) that contain novel metal&#8208;metal bonding have been investigated in a theoretical study of their molecular and electronic structure, thermodynamic stability, and metal&#8208;metal bonding. In all cases the metal&#8208;metal bonds are characterized as electron&#8208;sharing covalent single bonds from natural bond orbital (NBO) and energy&#8208;decomposition analysis with natural orbitals of chemical valence (EDA&#8208;NOCV) analysis. The sum of [MM&#8242;] charges is relatively constant, with all complexes exhibiting a [MM&#8242;]2+ core. Quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM) analysis indicates the presence of non&#8208;nuclear attractors (NNA) in the metal&#8208;metal bonds of the BeBe, MgMg, and CaCa complexes. There is substantial electron density (0.75&#8211;1.33&#8197;e) associated with the NNAs, which indicates that these metal&#8208;metal bonds, while classified as covalent electron&#8208;sharing bonds, retain significant metallic character that can be associated with reducing reactivity of the complex. The predicted stability of these complexes, combined with their novel covalent metal&#8208;metal bonding and potential as reducing agents, make them appealing targets for the synthesis of new metal&#8208;metal bonds.

         <title>Narrowband Blue Circularly Polarized Luminescence Emitter Based on BN&#8208;Doped Benzo[6]helicene with Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two 1,4&#8208;azaborinine [6]helicenes, H[6]BN1 and H[6]BN2, exhibit blue fluorescence with narrow FWHMs below 31&#8197;nm and high PLQY up to 92&#8201;%. Desirable circularly polarized luminescence with glum reaching 4~5&#215;10&#8722;4 and good configurational stability are relized for H[6]BN1 and H[6]BN2. Mechanochromism occurs between H[6]BN1&#8242;s crystalline and amorphous states by modulationg &#960;&#8208;&#960; intermolecular interanctions. An turquoise OLED based H[6]BN1 is manufactured with the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 3.18&#8201;%.







Abstract
Boron&#8208;doped helicenes, known for their unique electronic and photophysical properties, are of great interest for numerous applications. This research introduces two new azabora[6]helicenes, H[6]BN1 and H[6]BN2, synthesized through an efficient method. These molecules have boron and nitrogen atoms in opposing positions, enhancing their distinctive attributes. Both helicenes show excellent emission properties, with H[6]BN1 and H[6]BN2 exhibiting narrowband blue fluorescence and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL), achieving glum values of 4~5&#215;10&#8722;4 which is beneficial for chiroptical applications. The addition of a donor group, 3, 6&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazole, in H[6]BN2 improves luminescence, likely due to enhanced molecular orbital overlap and electron delocalization. H[6]BN1&#8242;s needle&#8208;like single crystals exhibit mechanochromism, changing luminescent color from yellow to green under mechanical stress, which is promising for stimulus&#8208;responsive materials. In conclusion, this study presents a novel class of BN[6]helicenes with superior chiroptical properties. Their combination of electronic features and mechanochromism makes them ideal for advanced chiroptical materials, expanding the potential of helicene&#8208;based compounds and offering new directions for the synthesis of molecules with specific chiroptical characteristics.

         <title>Single&#8208;Molecule Cross&#8208;Plane Conductance of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cross&#8208;plane break junction (XPBJ) measurement results of pyrene derivatives confirm that hydrogenation reduces conductance, while conductance of pyrene derivatives increased after substitution by both electron&#8208;donating and electron&#8208;withdrawing groups. It is found that only the trend of decreasing conductance for hydro&#8208;pyrene was consistent with the change in aromaticity.







Abstract
In the cross&#8208;plane single&#8208;molecule junctions, the correlation between molecular aromaticity and conductance remained puzzling. Cross&#8208;plane break junction (XPBJ) provides new insight into understanding the role of aromaticity and conjugation to molecules on charge transport through the planar molecules. In this work, we investigated the modulation of cross&#8208;plane charge transport in pyrene derivatives by hydrogenation and substituents based on the XPBJ method that differs from those used in&#8208;plane transport. We measured the electrical conductance of the hydrogenated derivatives of the pyrenes and found that hydrogenation reduces conductance, and the fully hydrogenated molecule has the lowest conductance. Conductance of pyrene derivatives increased after substitution by both electron&#8208;donating and electron&#8208;withdrawing groups. By calculating, the trend in decreased conductance of hydrogenated pyrene was found to be consistent with the change in aromaticity. Electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents reduce the aromaticity of the molecule and narrow the HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap, while electron&#8208;donating groups increase the aromaticity but also narrow the gap. Our work reveals the potential of fine&#8208;tuning the structure of the pyrene molecule to control the cross&#8208;plane charge transport through the single&#8208;molecule junctions.

         <title>Consequences of the Pb&#8208;S bond formation for lead halide perovskites</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lead halide perovskites are structurally not stable due to their ionic bonds. Using sulfur agents in the crystal growth improves the stability and performance of the photovoltaic and light&#8208;emitting devices. In this theoretical work, we use a small toy S&#8208;radical in place of A cation in the bulk of lead iodide perovskite, and highlight the significance of the Pb&#8208;S covalent&#8208;double&#8208;bond formation for: the charge redistribution on the neighboring bonds that also turn to be covalent, phase transformation to a stable non&#8208;perovskite structure, and superior optoelectronic properties. The chemical analysis was performed with the Quantum Theory of Atoms In Molecules (QTAIM) and Non&#8208;Covalent Interactions (NCI) index. Excitonic properties were obtained from the solution of ab initio Bethe&#8208;Salpeter equation. Presence of the spin&#8208;orbit coupling triggers an interplay between the Frenkel and charge&#8208;transfer multiexcitons, switching between the photovoltaic and laser applications. Multiexcitons obey the exciton&#8208;fission preconditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Enzyme Fueled Dissipative Self&#8208;assembly of Guanine Functionalized Molecules and Their Cellular Behaviour</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Generally, an esterase lipase enzyme can hydrolyze specific substrates called esters in an aqueous solution. Herein, we investigate how a G&#8208;quadruplex self&#8208;assembly affects the hydrolysis equilibrium in reverse. The biocatalyst, lipase, activates the individual building&#8208;blocks through fuel consumption, causing them to undergo a higher degree of self&#8208;organization into nanofibers within spheres. We have synthesized five peptide&#8208;lipid&#8208;conjugated guanine base functionalized molecules to explore how the equilibrium can be shifted through reverse hydrolysis. Among these, NAC5 self&#8208;assembled into a G&#8208;quadruplex structure which has been confirmed by various spectroscopic techniques. The wide&#8208;angle powder XRD, ThT dye binding assay and circular dichroism study is carried out to support the presence of the G&#8208;quadruplex structure. The biocatalytic formation of nanofibers enclosed spheres is analyzed using CLSM, FE&#8208;SEM and HR&#8208;TEM experiments. Additionally, we assess the biocompatibility of the enzyme fueled dissipative self&#8208;assembled fibers enclosed spheres, as they have potential applications as a biomaterial in protocells. MTT assay is performed to check the cytotoxicity of G&#8208;quadruplex hydrogel, using HEK 293 and McCoy cell lines for viability assessment. Finally, the utility of the novel NAC5 hydrogel as a wound repairing biomaterial is demonstrated by cell migration experiment in a scratch assay.</dc:description>

         <title>Non&#8208;medical applications of inorganic medicines. A switch based on mechanistic knowledge</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metals have been used in medicine for centuries. However, it was not until much later that the effects of inorganic drugs could be rationalized from a mechanistic point of view. Today, thanks to the technologies available, this approach has been functionally developed and implemented. It has been found that there is probably no single biological target for the pharmacological effects of most inorganic drugs. Herein, we present an overview of some integrated and multi&#8208;technique approaches to elucidate the molecular interactions underlying the biological effects of metallodrugs. On this premise, selected examples are used to illustrate how the information obtained on metal&#8208;based drugs and their respective mechanisms can become relevant for applications in fields other than medicine. For example, some well&#8208;known metallodrugs, which have been shown to bind specific amino acid residues of proteins, can be used to solve problems related to protein structure elucidation in crystallographic studies. Diruthenium tetraacetate can be used to catalyze the conversion of hydroxylamines to nitrones with a high selectivity when bound to lysozyme. Finally, a case study is presented in which an unprecedented palladium/arsenic&#8208;mediated catalytic cycle for nitrile hydration was discovered thanks to previous studies on the solution chemistry of the anticancer compound arsenoplatin&#8208;1 (AP&#8208;1).</dc:description>

         <title>A Computational Study of Reactions with Boric Acid Aimed to Promote the Utilization of Lignin</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>For exploring the reaction between the hydroxyl groups of lignin and boric acid under the alkaline condition, we study three proposed mechanisms for the formation of the anionic borate diester (ABDE) using the salicyl alcohol anion as the model compound by the density functional theory. ABDE has high flame retardancy and is a potentially practical application of lignin. The catalysis of sodium cation is found to enhance the deprotonation of the water cluster. The deprotonated product, hydroxide anion, is essential to the critical step, which is the cleavage of B&#8722;O bonds of the boric acid molecule, in reaction mechanisms. The energy profiles of the mechanisms show that the reaction between lignin and boric acid may start from the hydroxymethyl moieties of lignin since it requires less energy for the aforementioned critical step than from the phenol moieties of lignin. Moreover, the hydroxide anions compete with the hydroxymethyl groups in lignin for the formation of B&#8722;O bonds by forming tetrahydroxyborate anion (TBA) which requires very high activation energies to further react to the desired product ABDE. The optimal condition is to enhance the catalytic effect of sodium cations and meanwhile to control the formation of TBA.</dc:description>

Moreover, the hydroxide anions compete with the hydroxymethyl groups in lignin for the formation of B&#8722;O bonds by forming tetrahydroxyborate anion (TBA) which requires very high activation energies to further react to the desired product ABDE. The optimal condition is to enhance the catalytic effect of sodium cations and meanwhile to control the formation of TBA.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Benzo&#8208;fused BOPAM Fluorophores: Synthesis, Post&#8208;functionalization, Photophysical Properties, and Acid Sensing Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel category of asymmetric boron chromophores with the attachment of two BF2 moieties denoted as BOPAM, has been successfully synthesized via a one&#8208;pot three&#8208;step reaction starting from N&#8208;phenylbenzothioamide. This synthetic route results in the production of [a] and [b]benzo&#8208;fused BOPAMs along with post&#8208;functionalization of the [a]benzo&#8208;fused BOPAMs. The photophysical properties of these compounds have been systematically investigated through steady&#8208;state absorption and fluorescence emission measurements in solvents at both ambient and cryogenic temperatures, as well as in the solid state. Computational methods have been employed to elucidate the emissive characteristics of the benzo&#8208;fused BOPAMs, revealing distinctive photophysical attributes, including solvent&#8208;dependent fluorescence intensity. Remarkably, certain BOPAM derivatives exhibit noteworthy photophysical phenomena, such as the induction of off&#8208;on fluorescence emission under specific solvent conditions and the manifestation of intermolecular charge transfer states in solid&#8208;state matrices. Through post&#8208;functionalization strategies involving the introduction of electron&#8208;donating groups onto the [a]benzo&#8208;fused BOPAM scaffold, an intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) pathway is activated, leading to substantial fluorescence quenching via non&#8208;radiative decay processes. Notably, one [a]benzo&#8208;fused BOPAM variant exhibits a pronounced fluorescence enhancement upon exposure to acidic conditions, thereby underscoring its potential utility in pH&#8208;sensing applications.</dc:description>

         <title>LOW&#8208;TEMPERATURE SYNTHESIS OF GeTe NANOPARTICLES</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanoparticles can offer an alternative approach to fabricate phase&#8208;change materials. The chemical synthesis of GeTe nanoparticles using organometallic precursors exploits high&#8208;boiling solvents and relatively high temperatures (close or even above crystallization temperatures), as reported in the available literature. The aim of this work is the preparation of GeTe nanoparticles by a low&#8208;temperature synthetic method exploiting new organometallic precursors and common organic solvents. Indeed, different preparation methods and characterization of GeTe nanoparticles is discussed. The characterization of the prepared nanomaterial was performed on the basis of X&#8208;ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy, laser ablation time&#8208;of&#8208;flight mass spectrometry, Raman scattering spectroscopy, and dynamic light scattering. The results show that the low&#8208;temperature synthetic route leads to amorphous GeTe nanoparticles. Exploited organometallic precursor is stabilised by neutral ligand which can be isolated after the reaction and repeatedly used for further reactions. Furthermore, GeTe nanoparticle size can be tuned by the conditions of the synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Heterometallic&#8208;organic cages with customized cavities: constructed by bottom&#8208;up step&#8208;wise coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>accurately synthesizing coordination&#8208;driven metal&#8208;organic cages with customized shape and cavity remain a great challenge for chemists. In this work, a bottom&#8208;up step&#8208;wise coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly approach was put forward. Employing this strategy, three terpyridyl heterometallic&#8208;organic truncated tetrahedral cages with different sizes and cavity were precisely synthesized. Firstly, the coordination of tripodal organic ligands with Ru2+ afforded dendritic metal&#8208;organic ligands L1&#8208;L3. Then the Ru building blocks complexed with Fe2+ and shrunk to form the desired heterometallic&#8208;organic cages (C1&#8208;C3). These discrete heterometallic&#8208;organic supramolecular cages were fully characterized and displayed the large and open cavities varied from 7205 &#197;3 to 9384 &#197;3. Notably, these cages&#160;could not be directly constructed by single&#8208;step assembly process using initial organic ligands or dimeric metal&#8208;organic ligands, indicative of the irreplaceability of a bottom&#8208;up step&#8208;wise assembly strategy for size&#8208;customized architectures. This work paves a new way for precisely constructing metal&#8208;organic cages with well&#8208;defined cavities.</dc:description>

         <title>Crystallography reveals metal&#8208;triggered restructuring of &#946;&#8208;hairpins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal binding to &#946;&#8208;sheets occurs in many metalloproteins and is also implicated in the pathology of Alzheimer's disease. De novo designed metallo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;sheets have been pursued as models and mimics of these proteins. However, no crystal structures of canonical &#946;&#8208;sheet metallopeptides have yet been obtained, in stark contrast to many examples for &#593;&#8208;helical metallopeptides, leading to a poor understanding for their chemistry. To address this, we have engineered tryptophan zippers, stable 12&#8208;residue &#946;&#8208;sheet peptides, to bind Cu(II) ions and obtained crystal structures through single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SC&#8208;XRD). We find that metal binding triggers several unexpected supramolecular assemblies that demonstrate the range of higher&#8208;order structures available to metallo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;sheets. Overall, these findings underscore the importance of crystallography in elucidating the rich structural landscape of metallo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;sheet peptides.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Ultrathin two&#8208;dimensional (2D) metal&#8208;organic nanosheets (MONs) have attracted continued attention in the field of advanced functional materials. Their nanoscale thickness, high surface&#8208;to&#8208;volume ratio, and abundant accessible active sites, are superior advantages compared with their 3D bulk counterparts. Bioinspired molecular scalpel strategy is a promising method for the creation of 2D MONs, and may solve the current shortcomings of MONs synthesis. This review aims to provide a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art overview of molecular scalpel strategies and share the results of current development to provide a better solution for MONs synthesis. Different types of molecular scalpel strategies have been systematically summarized. Both mechanisms, advantages and limitations of multiform molecular scalpel strategies have been discussed.

         <title>Fast and Efficient sensing of Drugs in Water Using Self&#8208;Assembling D&#8208;Glucamine functionalized Naphthalenediimide and 1,8&#8208;Naphthalimide Fluorophores</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fast and sensitive quantification of drugs as emerging pollutants in water bodies is a pressing need in contemporary society, to prevent serious environmental concerns that could negatively impact on human health. This explains the surge of interest in this field, and the need to identify highly selective sensing systems. Addressing this issue, in this work we synthesized two D&#8208;glucamine functionalized fluorophores bearing self&#8208;assembling cores, as 1,8&#8208;naphthalimide and naphthalene diimide. We studied their self&#8208;assembly in water solution, and characterized the aggregated formed by determining their stability constant, their morphology and size by scanning electron microscopy, resonance light scattering and dynamic light scattering, as well their solid&#8208;state emission ability. Then, we studied their sensing ability, in water, towards pharmaceutically active compounds such as ciprofloxacin, nalidixic acid, carbamazepine and diclofenac sodium salt, by fluorescence investigation. Data collected show that the self&#8208;assembling ability is significantly affected by the fluorophore structure, which in turn also determines sensing ability. In particular, the naphtalene diimide&#8208;based probe was the most sensitive, with LOD as low as 0.01 mM in the presence of nalidixic acid, which is in line and competitive with more complex sensing systems, recently reported in the literature.</dc:description>

         <title>Orthogonal Geometry Enhancing the Intersystem Crossing and Photosensitive Efficiency of Spiro Organoboron Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Based on the reported spiro organoboron compounds (PS1 and PS2 as potent 1O2 sensitizers), several new organoboron molecules (PS4&#8722;PS9) were constructed through structural modification, and their low&#8208;lying excited states and photophysical properties have been explored by density functional theory (DFT) and time&#8208;dependent DFT (TD&#8208;DFT) calculations. The predicted effective intersystem crossing (ISC) processes arise from the S1&#8594;T2 transition for PS4&#8722;PS6 and the S1&#8594;T4 transition for PS1, and corresponding KISC rate constants reach the order of magnitude of 109 (s&#8208;1). The organoboron compounds with a (N, N) chelate acceptor are predicted to exhibit relatively higher ISC efficiency than those bearing a (N, O) acceptor, and the planar C3NBN ring and the orthogonal configuration between the donor and acceptor moieties are responsible for the ISC rate enhancement. Importantly, the geometric features of the lowest singlet excited state (S1) for these compounds play a decisive role in their photosensitive efficiency. The present results provide a basis for better understanding of the photosensitivity of these spiro organoboron compounds and the structural modification effect.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure Elucidation of Pharmaceutically Relevant Compounds within Pyrene&#8208;based Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) is the preferred and most accurate technique for determining molecular structures. However, it can present challenges when dealing with specific small molecules and active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), as many do not form quality crystals without coformers or can be unstable. In this study, we introduce tetrakis(guanidinium) pyrenetetrasulfonate (G4PYR), a robust guanidinium&#8208;organosulfonate (GS) framework that efficiently encapsulates small molecules and APIs rich in functional groups. The hydrogen bonding frameworks formed by G4PYR display well&#8208;ordered structures with predictable pyrene&#8208;pyrene distances, making them ideally suited for targeting arene&#8208;based APIs with pendant groups. Successful encapsulation of various guests, including benzaldehyde, benzamide, and arenes containing multiple hydrogen bond donors and acceptors like uracil and thymine, was achieved. Furthermore, we successfully encapsulated important pharmaceutical and biologically relevant compounds, such as lidocaine, ropinirole, adenosine, thymidine, and others. Notably, we present a workflow for investigating host&#8208;guest complex formation using powder X&#8208;ray diffraction and high throughput experimentation.</dc:description>

         <title>Preparation and Electrochemical Applications of Magn&#233;li Phase Titanium Suboxides: A Review</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Magn&#233;li phase titanium suboxides (M&#8208;TSOs) belong to a type of sub&#8208;stoichiometric titanium oxides based on the crystal structure of rutile TiO2. They possess a unique shear structure, granting them exceptional electrical conductivity and corrosion resistance. These two advantages are crucial for electrode materials in electrochemistry, hence the significant interest from numerous researchers. However, the preparation of M&#8208;TSOs is uneconomic due to high temperature reduction and other complex synthesis process, thus limiting their practical application in electrochemical fields. This review delves into the crystal structure, properties, and synthesis methods of M&#8208;TSOs, and touches on their applications as electrocatalysts in wastewater treatment and electrochemical water splitting. Furthermore, it highlights the research challenges and potential future research directions in M&#8208;TSOs.</dc:description>

         <title>Quantum Information Patterns Between Atoms in a Molecule</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Quantum information theory provides a powerful toolbox of descriptors that characterize many&#8208;electron systems based on quantum information patterns between open quantum systems. Despite the wealth of insights gained in the con&#8208; densed matter community, the use of these descriptors to study interactions between atoms in a molecule remains limited. In this study, we develop a quantum information framework for molecules that characterizes the quantum in&#8208; formation patterns between quantum atoms as defined in the Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules. We show that quantum information analyses capture key properties of quantum atoms and how they interact with their molec&#8208; ular environment. Additionally, we show that the presence of bond critical points can remain invariant despite large changes in the quantum information patterns between the quantum atoms. Our findings indicate that quantum infor&#8208; mation theory can shed a new light on molecular electronic structure.</dc:description>

         <title>Stabilization Strategies of Lithium Metal Anode Toward Dendrite&#8208;Free Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries are considered as a most promising rechargeable lithium metal batteries because of their high energy density and low cost. However, the Li&#8208;S batteries mainly suffer the capacity decay issue caused by the shutting effect of lithium polysulfides and the safety issues arising from the Li dendrites formation. This review outlines the current issues of Li&#8208;S batteries. Furthermore, we comprehensively summarized the challenges encountered by Li anode in Li&#8208;S batteries, such as the heterogeneous deposition of the Li anode, the unstable solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer, and volume expansion. Moreover, research progresses in the stabilization strategies of Li anodes (physical approaches, optimization of electrolyte, surface protection layer, and design of current collector) is discussed in detail. Lastly, the remaining challenges and future research directions of Li metal anode stabilization in Li&#8208;S batteries are also present.</dc:description>

         <title>Rational Design of Mesoporous ZnFe2O4@g&#8208;C3N4Heterojunctions for Environmental Remediation and Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mesoporous catalysts with a high specific surface area, accessible pore structures, and appropriate band edges are desirable for optimal charge transfer across the interfaces, suppress electron&#8208;hole recombination, and promote redox reactions at the active sites. The present study demonstrates the rational design of mesoporous ZnFe2O4@g&#8208;C3N4&#160;magnetic nanocomposites (MNCs) with different pore sizes and pore volumes following a combination of facile thermal itching and thermal impregnation methods. The MNCs preserve the structural, morphological, and physical attributes of their counterparts while ensuring their effectiveness and superior catalytic capabilities. The morphological analysis confirms the successful grafting and confinement of ZnFe2O4 nanoparticles&#160;with the polymeric g&#8208;C3N4 nanosheets to form heterojunctions with numerous interfaces. The MNCs possess uniformly distributed small mesopores (pore size &lt;4 nm), ample active sites, and a high specific surface area of 62.50 m2/g. The mesoporous ZnFe2O4@g&#8208;C3N4&#160;notably improve hydrogen evolution rate and methylene blue&#160;dye degradation. The optimal loading weight of ZnFe2O4 is 20%, in which the MNCs display the highest hydrogen evolution rate of 1752 &#181;molg&#8208;1h&#8208;1 and photo&#8208;Fenton dye degradation rate constants of 0.147 min&#8722;1, upon solar&#8208;light illumination. Furthermore, the photocatalysts demonstrate recyclability over five consecutive cycles, confirming their stability, while easy separation using a simple magnet underscores practical utility.</dc:description>

The optimal loading weight of ZnFe2O4 is 20%, in which the MNCs display the highest hydrogen evolution rate of 1752 &#181;molg-1h-1 and photo-Fenton dye degradation rate constants of 0.147 min&#8722;1, upon solar-light illumination. Furthermore, the photocatalysts demonstrate recyclability over five consecutive cycles, confirming their stability, while easy separation using a simple magnet underscores practical utility.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Air and Water Stable Bicyclic (alkyl)(amino)Carbene Stabilized Phosphenium Cation: Reactivity and Selective Fluoride Ion Affinity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis and reactivity of an air and water stable Bicyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene (BICAAC) stabilized phosphenium cation (1) is reported. Air and water stable phosphenium cation are rare in the literature. Compound 1 is obtained by reaction of BICAAC with Ph2PCl in THF followed by anion exchange with LiOTf. The reduction and oxidation of 1 yielded corresponding &#945;&#8208;radical phosphine species (2) and BICAAC stabilized phosphenium oxide (3) respectively. All compounds are well characterized by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies. The Lewis acidity of compounds 1 and 3 are determined by conducting fluoride ion affinity experiments using UV&#8208;Vis spectrophotometry and multinuclei NMR spectroscopy. Compounds 1 and 3 exhibited selective binding to fluoride anion but did not interact with other halides (Cl&#8208; and Br&#8208;). Quantum chemical calculations were performed to understand the structure and nature of bonding interactions in these compounds, as well as to comprehend the specific bonding affinity to fluoride over other halide ions.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Advances in DNA&#8208;Based Nanoprobes for In vivo MiRNA Imaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As a post transcriptional regulator of gene expression, miRNA is closely related to many major human diseases, especially cancer. Therefore, its precise detection is very important for disease diagnosis and treatment. With the advancement of fluorescent dye and imaging technology, the focus has shifted from in vitro microRNAs (miRNA) detection to in vivo miRNA imaging. This concept review summarizes signal amplification strategies including DNAzyme catalytic reaction, hybrid chain reaction (HCR), catalytic hairpin assembly (CHA) to enhance detection signal of lowly expressed miRNAs; external stimuli of ultraviolet (UV) light or near&#8208;infrared region (NIR) light, and internal stimuli such as adenosine triphosphate (ATP), glutathione (GSH), protease and cell membrane protein to prevent nonspecific activation for the avoidance of false positive signal; and the development of fluorescent probes with emission in NIR for in vivo miRNA imaging; as well as rare earth nanoparticle based the second near&#8208;infrared window (NIR&#8208;II) nanoprobes with excellent tissue penetration and depth for in vivo miRNA imaging. The concept review also indicated current challenges for in vivo miRNA imaging including the dynamic monitoring of miRNA expression change and simultaneous in vivo imaging of multiple miRNAs.</dc:description>

         <title>Lewis Acid Regulation Strategy for Constructing D&#8208;A&#8208;A Covalent Organic Frameworks with Enhanced Photocatalytic Organic Conversion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Owing to their excellent photoelectric properties, donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) type photocatalytic covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have attracted significant research interest in recent years. However, the limited D&#8211;A structural units of existing COFs restrict the development of novel and efficient photocatalytic COF materials. To solve this problem, we developed a series of D&#8211;A&#8211;A&#8208;type COFs utilizing a Lewis acid regulation strategy, in which Lewis acids act as the coordination centers, and pyridine and cyano groups act as ligands. Lewis acid sites in COFs serve as electron acceptors, facilitating the separation and transfer of photogenerated electron&#8211;hole pairs. This process is crucial for photocatalysis because it significantly increases the efficiency of the catalytic reaction by reducing the recombination rate of charge carriers. The developed Lewis acid&#8208;activated D&#8211;A&#8211;A COFs efficiently catalyzed the hydroxylation of various phenylboronic acid compounds under visible light. The developed catalysts are expected to contribute to increasing the fabrication efficiency of industrially important organic materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulating the Topologies and Photoresponsive Properties of Lanthanum&#8208;organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) show potential application in many domains, in which photochromic MOFs (PMOFs) have received enormous attention. Researchers mainly utilize photoactive ligands to build PMOFs. Recently, the mixed electron donating and accepting ligands strategies have also been used to construct PMOFs driven by the electron transfer between nonphotochromic moieties. However, the potential interligand competition inhibits the formation of PMOFs. Therefore, the exploration of single&#8208;ligand&#8208;guided assembly is conductive for building PMOFs. Considering the existing electron accepting and donating role of pyridyl and carboxyl, the pyridinecarboxyate derived from the fusion of pyridyl and carboxyl units may serve as single ligand to yield PMOFs. In this work, the coordination assembly of bipyridinedicarboxylate (2,2'&#8208;bipyridine&#8208;4,4'&#8208;dicarboxylic acid, H2bpdc; 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline&#8208;2,9&#8208;dicarboxylic acid, H2pda) and LaCl3 generate two PMOFs, [La(bpdc)(H2O)Cl] (1) and [La(pda)(H2O)2Cl]&#183;2H2O (2). Both complexes feature dinuclear lanthanum as building blocks with differences in the connecting number of likers, in which 1 has (4,8)&#8208;connected topology and 2 exhibits sql topology. Their structural differences result in the diversities of photoresponsive functionalities. Compared with reported PMOFs built from photoactive ligands and mixed ligands, this study provides new available categories of single ligand for generating PMOFs and tuning the structure and photoresponsive properties via ligand substitution and external photostimulus.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent triazine&#160;frameworks (CTFs) are promising heterogeneous photocatalyst candidates owing to their excellent stability, conjugacy, and tunability. In this study, a series of CTFs decorated with different substituents (H, MeO, and F) were synthesised and utilised as photocatalysts for C&#8208;H activation reactions. The corresponding optoelectronic properties could be precisely regulated by the electronic effects of different substituents in the nanopore channels of the CTFs; these CTFs were effective photocatalysts for C&#8208;H activation in organic synthesis due to their unique structures and optoelectronic properties. Methoxy&#8208;substituted CTF (MeO&#8208;CTF) exhibited extraordinary catalytic performance and reusability in C&#8208;H functionalization by constructing an electronic donor&#8208;acceptor system, achieving the highest yield in the photocatalytic C3&#8208;H hydroxylation of 2&#8208;phenylimidazole[1,2&#8208;&#945;]pyridine. This strategy provides a new scaffold for the rational design of CTFs as efficient photocatalysts for organic synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Covalent Lysozyme Immobilization on Enzymatic Cellulose Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanostructured materials represent promising substrates for biocatalysts immobilization and activation. Cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs), accessible from waste and/or renewable sources, are sustainable and biodegradable, show high specific surface area for anchoring a high number of enzymatic units, and high thermal and mechanical stability. In this work, we present a holistic enzyme&#8208;based approach to functional antibacterial materials by bioconjugation between the lysozyme from chicken egg white and enzymatic cellulose nanocrystals. The neutral CNCs were prepared by endoglucanase hydrolysis from Avicel. We explore the covalent immobilization of lysozyme on the enzymatic CNCs and on their TEMPO oxidized derivatives (TO&#8208;CNCs), comparing immobilization yields, materials properties, and enzymatic activities. The materials were characterized by X&#8208;ray diffractometry (XRD), attenuated total reflectance Fourier Transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR&#8208;FTIR), bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay, field&#8208;emission scanning electron microscopy (FE&#8208;SEM) and dynamic light scattering (DLS). We demonstrate the higher overall efficiency of the immobilization process carried out on TO&#8208;CNCs, based on the success of covalent bonding and on the stability of the isolated biocojugates.</dc:description>

         <title>Non&#8208;Kekul&#233; meta&#8208;Quinodimethane Singlet Diradicals Based on Classical N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Diradicals based on a meta&#8208;quinodimethane (m&#8208;QDM) scaffold generally have a triplet ground state and are rather scarce. Herein, m&#8208;QDM&#8208;based non&#8208;Kekul&#233; diradicals [3,3'&#8208;(NHC)2BP] (3&#8208;NHC) (NHC = SIPr = C{N(Dipp)CH2}2; IPr = C{N(Dipp)CH}2, Me&#8208;IPr = C{N(Dipp)CMe}2; Dipp = 2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3; BP = 1,1'&#8208;C6H3C6H3) featuring N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) pendants are reported as crystalline solids. The EPR spectra of 3&#8208;NHC show both allowed (Dms = 1) and forbidden (Dms = 2; &#8216;half&#8208;field&#8217;) transitions characteristic for triplet diradicals. Variable temperature EPR studies however reveal a singlet ground state for 3&#8208;SIPr. Consistent with the EPR spectra, calculations predict a remarkably small (open&#8208;shell) singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap (&#916;EST &#8804; 0.26 kcal/mol) for the 3&#8208;NHC compounds. The calculated singlet diradical character for the ground states of the 3&#8208;NHC compounds amounts to ~99%.</dc:description>

         <title>Expedited Proton Relay in Enzyme&#8208;Inspired Cobaloximes Facilitate Organic Transformations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We illustrate the oxygen&#8208;tolerant and benign nature of active bio&#8208;inspired cobaloxime complexes featuring the axial coordination with imidazole or histidine. These complexes provide efficient chemical transformations like amine synthesis. This transformation is complemented by concur&#8208;rent evolution of H2 through synergistic utilization of a photocatalyst and a cobaloxime&#8208;based catalyst.







Abstract
Developing a water&#8208;soluble, oxygen&#8208;tolerant, and acid&#8208;stable synthetic H2 production catalyst is vital for renewable energy infrastructure. To access such an effective catalyst, we strategically incorporated enzyme&#8208;inspired, multicomponent outer coordination sphere elements around the cobaloxime (Cl&#8722;Co&#8722;X) core with suitable axial coordination (X). Our cobaloximes with axial imidazole or L&#8208;histidine coordination in photocatalytic HAT including the construction of anilines via a non&#8208;canonical cross&#8208;coupling approach is found superior compared to commonly used cobaloxime catalysts. The reversible Co(II)/Co(I) process is influenced by the axial N ligand's nature. Imidazole/L&#8208;histidine with a higher pKa promptly produces H2 upon irradiation, leading to the improved reactivity compared to previously employed axial (di)chloride or pyridine analogue.

         <title>Impact of Weak Organic Acids as Coagulants on Tailoring the Properties of Cellulose Aerogel Beads</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate that the physical and microstructural properties of cellulose aerogel beads can be tailored by using weak organic acids such as acetic acid (HAc), lactic acid (HLac) or citric acid (HCit) as coagulants. In comparison to strong hydrochloric acid (HCl), organic acids in the regeneration bath produced densely packed nanofibrillar network and large volume of mesoporous structure.







Abstract
Tailoring the properties of cellulose aerogel beads was investigated in the present study by using weak organic acids as coagulants. Three different weak acids were specifically chosen, acetic acid, lactic acid and citric acid. For comparative studies, a strong acid, hydrochloric acid was examined. The production of aerogel beads by conventional dropping technique was controlled and optimized for weak acids. Aerogels were characterized by density analyses, scanning electron microscopy, nitrogen adsorption&#8211;desorption analysis, X&#8208;ray powder diffractometry and IR spectroscopy. In common, all the aerogel beads showed interconnected nanofibrillar network, high specific surface area, high pore volume, high porosity and meso&#8208; and macroporous structure. In particular, when the weakest acid (acetic acid) was used as coagulant in the regeneration bath, the lowest shrinkage was observed. As a result, the cellulose aerogel beads produced from acetic acid showed the highest values of specific surface area (423&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1) and pore volume (3.6&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1). The porous structure can be tuned by the choice of regeneration bath, which has either strong acid or a high concentration of weak acid. The aerogel beads were pure and showed cellulose II crystallinity. Hence this study paves an alternative path way to tailor the properties of cellulose aerogel beads.

         <title>Pillar[n]arene&#8208;Based Fluorescence Turn&#8208;On Chemosensors for the Detection of Spermine, Spermidine, and Cadaverine in Saline Media and Biofluids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This research delves into the critical role of fast and efficient polyamine detection utilizing self&#8208;assembled, fluorescent chemosensors based on sulfonated pillar[5]arene as host and diazapyrene indicator dyes. Polyamine&#8208;selective and spermine&#8208;selective host&#8208;guest pairs are introduced. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of the developed chemosensors in biofluids like human urine and saliva, offering promising advancements in biomedical diagnostics.







Abstract
Polyamines are essential analytes due to their critical role in various biological processes and human health in general. Due to their role as regulators for cell growth and proliferation (putrescine and spermine), as neuroprotectors, gero&#8208;, and cardiovascular protectors (spermidine), and as bacterial growth indicators (cadaverine), rapid, simple, and cost&#8208;effective methods for polyamine detection in biofluids are in demand. The present study focuses on the development and investigation of self&#8208;assembled and fluorescent host&#8901;dye chemo&#8208;sensors based on sulfonated pillar[5]arene for the specific detection of polyamines. Binding studies, as well as stability and functionality assessments of the turn&#8208;on chemosensors for selective polyamine detection in saline and biologically relevant media, are shown. Furthermore, the practical applicability of the developed chemo&#8208;sensors is demonstrated in biofluids such as human urine and saliva.

         <title>Synthesis of Adhesive Polyrotaxanes through Sequential Self&#8208;Assembly via Supramolecular Interactions and Dynamic Covalent Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Self&#8208;assembly is an effective approach to construct complicated structures. Polyrotaxanes (PRs) as one of the typical polymer types with complex structure, own interlocked structures and dynamic components, in which it results in unique characteristics and functions. Currently, the synthesis of which involves covalent reactions to hinder the development of polyrotaxanes. Herein, we employed supramolecular interactions as well as dynamic covalent bonds to synthesize PRs by sequential self&#8208;assembly. First, we prepared M1 possessing two diamine structures and M2 of a bisammonium salt with two dibenzylammonium (DBA) units modified by two stoppers at its ends, then M1 and M2 self&#8208;assembled into supramolecular polymers stemming from hydrogen bonding of [N+&#8722;H&#183;&#183;&#183;O] under high concentrations. After adding 2,6&#8208;pyridinedicarboxaldehyde (M3), the imine bond formation enabled the generation of macrocycles, transforming supramolecular polymers into PRs. Besides, the solution of polyrotaxanes was applied as the adhesive for diverse hard and soft materials. This strategy provides an important approach for synthesizing PRs, accelerating the advances of mechanically interlocked polymers.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal Cocatalyst Engineering in Metal&#8208;Semiconductor Hybrid Photocatalysts Achieves a Fivefold Enhancement of Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study explores the optimal morphology of photochemical hydrogen evolution catalysts in a one&#8208;dimensional system. Systematic engineering of metal tips on precisely defined CdSe@CdS dot&#8208;in&#8208;rods is conducted to exert control over morphology, composition, and both factors. The outcome yields an optimized configuration, a Au&#8208;Pt core&#8208;shell structure with a rough Pt surface (Au@r&#8208;Pt), which exhibits a remarkable fivefold increase in quantum efficiency, reaching 86% at 455 nm and superior hydrogen evolution rates under visible and AM1.5G irradiation conditions with prolonged stability. Kinetic investigations using photoelectrochemical and time&#8208;resolved measurements demonstrate a greater extent and extended lifetime of the charge&#8208;separated state on the tips as well as rapid water reduction kinetics on high&#8208;energy surfaces. This approach sheds light on the critical role of cocatalysts in hybrid photocatalytic systems for achieving high performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlled Photooxidation via Singlet Oxygen Generation by Triplet Harvesting in a Heavy Atom Free Pure Organic Dithienylethene&#8208;Naphthalene Diimide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Noninvasive control over the reversible generation of singlet oxygen (1O2) has found the enormous practical implications in the field of biomedical science. However, metal&#8208;free pure organic emitters, connected with a photoswitch, capable of generating &#8220;on&#8208;demand&#8221; 1O2 via triplet harvesting remain exceedingly rare; therefore, the utilization of these organic materials for the reversible control of singlet oxygen production remains at its infancy.&#160;Herein, an ambient triplet mediated emission in quinoline&#8208;dithienylethene (DTE)&#8208;core&#8208;substituted naphthalene diimide (cNDI) derivative is unveiled via delayed fluorescence. The quinoline&#8208;DTE&#8208;cNDI triad displayed enhanced photoswitching efficiency via double FRET mechanism.&#160;&#160;It was found to have direct utilization in controlled photosensitized organic transformations via efficient generation of singlet oxygen (yield &#934;&#916; ~ 0.73). The designed molecule exhibits a long&#8208;lived emission (&#964; &#8764; 1.1 &#956;s) and very small singlet&#8208;triplet splitting (&#916;SET) of 0.13 eV empowering it to display delayed fluorescence. Comprehensive steady state and time&#8208;resolved emission spectroscopy (TRES) analyses along with DFT calculations offer detailed understandings into the excited&#8208;state manifolds of organic compound and energy transfer (ET) pathways involved in 1O2 generation.</dc:description>

Here, we report a series of 1,1&#180;&#8209;binaphthyl&#8208;2,2&#180;&#8208;diol (BINOL) based catalysts in which the number of interlocked macrocycles is varied. Unsurprisingly, the macrocycles have a profound steric influence on the catalytic performance of these molecules. However, in the enantioselective transformations examined, the macrocycles are detrimental to catalyst stereoselectivity whereas in lactide polymerization, they increase the molecular weight of the polymeric product.</dc:description>

         <title>Cyanide Linkage Isomerization Induced by Cobalt Oxidation&#8208;State Changes at a Co&#8208;Fe Prussian&#8208;Blue Analogue/ZnO Interface</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Understanding the interfacial composition in heterostructures is crucial for tailoring heterogenous electrochemical and photoelectrochemical processes. This work aims to elucidate the structure of a series of Co&#8208;Fe Prussian blue analogue modified ZnO (PBA/ZnO) electrodes with interface&#8208;sensitive vibrational sum frequency generation (VSFG) spectroscopy. Our measurements revealed, for the first time, a cyanide linkage isomerism at the PBA/ZnO interface, when the composite is fabricated at elevated temperatures. In situ VSFG spectro&#8208;electrochemistry measurements correlate the CoII&#10141;CoIII oxidation with the flip of the bridging CN ligand from Co&#8208;NC&#8208;Fe coordination mode to a Co&#8208;CN&#8208;Fe one.&#160; Photoluminescence measurements and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy reveal that this unprecedented linkage isomerism originates from surface defects, which act as oxidation sites for the PBA. The presence of such surface defects is correlated with the fabrication temperature for PBA/ZnO.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Understanding the interfacial composition in heterostructures is crucial for tailoring heterogenous electrochemical and photoelectrochemical processes. This work aims to elucidate the structure of a series of Co-Fe Prussian blue analogue modified ZnO (PBA/ZnO) electrodes with interface-sensitive vibrational sum frequency generation (VSFG) spectroscopy. Our measurements revealed, for the first time, a cyanide linkage isomerism at the PBA/ZnO interface, when the composite is fabricated at elevated temperatures.

Herein, UV/Vis, 1H NMR and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry have been used to establish the reversibility and highly robust nature of the light&#8208; and redox&#8208;driven behaviour of these new foldamers with minimal levels of fatigue observed even upon multiple cyclic treatments with irradiative/non&#8208;irradiative and oxidative/reductive conditions.

         <title>Corrin Ring Modifications Reveal the Chemical and Spatial Requirements for the B12&#8208;btuB Riboswitch Interaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To find the structural requirements of a B12&#8208;derivative to bind and switch the btuB riboswitch we derivatised the corrin sidechains b and e as well as the apical ligand. While modifications at the sidechains have a large impact on the riboswitch, introduction of an apical adenosyl&#8208;ligand restores the riboswitch fold.







Abstract
The btuB riboswitch is a regulatory RNA sequence controlling gene expression of the outer membrane B12 transport protein BtuB by specifically binding coenzyme B12 (AdoCbl) as its natural ligand. The B12 sensing riboswitch class is known to accept various B12 derivatives, leading to a division into two riboswitch subclasses, dependent on the size of the apical ligand. Here we focus on the role of side chains b and e on affinity and proper recognition, i.&#8201;e. correct structural switch of the btuB RNA, which belongs to the AdoCbl&#8208;binding class I. Chemical modification of these side chains disturbs crucial hydrogen bonds and/or electrostatic interactions with the RNA, its effect on both affinity and switching being monitored by in&#8208;line probing. Chemical modifications at sidechain b of vitamin B12 show larger effects indicating crucial B12&#8208;RNA interactions. When introducing the same modification to AdoCbl the influence of any side&#8208;chain modification tested is reduced. This renders the impact of the adenosyl&#8208;ligand for B12&#8208;btuB riboswitch recognition clearly beyond the known role in affinity.

         <title>Towards Sustainable Materials: A Review of Acylhydrazone Chemistry for Reversible Polymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review examines the advancements in acylhydrazone dynamic chemistry within reversible polymers and its various applications in materials chemistry. Additionally, it investigates the potential for polymer reprocessing and recycling to support the circular economy.







Abstract
Transitioning towards a circular economy, extensive research has focused on dynamic covalent bonds (DCBs) to pave the way for more sustainable materials. These bonds enable debonding and rebonding on demand, as well as facilitating end&#8208;of&#8208;life recycling. Acylhydrazone/hydrazone chemistry offers a material with high stability under neutral and basic conditions making it a promising candidate for materials research, though the material is susceptible to acid degradation. However, this degradation under acidic conditions can be exploited, making it widely applicable in self&#8208;healing and biomedical fields, with potential for reprocessing and recycling. This review highlights studies exploring the reversibility of acylhydrazone/hydrazone bonds in various polymers, altering their properties, and utilizing them in applications such as self&#8208;healing, reprocessing, and recycling. The review also focuses on how the mechanical properties are affected by the presence of dynamic linkages, and methods to improve the mechanical performance.

         <title>Proton Conducting Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks (MOFs) via Post Synthetic Transmetallation and Water Induced Structural Transformations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The bimetallic MOFs are demonstrated to exhibit transmetallation via post synthetic modifications. The green crystals of Cu&#8208;MOF convert to blue crystals via single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal transformation as the coordinated DMA is exchanged with water. These MOFs exhibit notable proton conductivities ranging from 10&#8722;3 to 10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 under variable temperatures and humidity levels.







Abstract
Post Synthetic Modification (PSM) of Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks (MOFs) is a crucial strategy for developing new MOFs with enhanced functional properties compared to their parent one. PSM can be accomplished through various methods:1) modification of organic linkers; 2) exchange of metal ions or nodes; and 3) inclusion or exchange of solvent/guest molecules. Herein, PSM of bimetallic and monometallic MOFs containing biphenyl dinitro&#8208;tetra&#8208;carboxylates (NCA) are demonstrated. The tetra carboxylate NCA, produces monometallic Cd&#8208;MOF&#8208;1 and Cu&#8208;MOF&#8208;1 and bimetallic CoZn&#8208;MOF in solvothermal reactions with the corresponding metal salts. The CoZn&#8208;MOF undergoes post&#8208;synthetic transmetallation with Cd(NO3)2 and Cu(NO3)2 in aqueous solution to yield Cd&#8208;MOF&#8208;2 and Cu&#8208;MOF&#8208;2, respectively. Additionally, green crystals of Cu&#8208;MOF&#8208;1 found to undergo a single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (SCSC) transformation to blue crystals of Cu&#8208;MOF&#8208;3 upon dipped into water at room temperature. These MOFs demonstrate notable proton conductivities ranging from 10&#8722;3 to 10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 under variable temperatures and humidity levels. Among them, Cu&#8208;MOF&#8208;3 achieves the highest proton conductivity of 1.36&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 90&#8201;&#176;C and 98&#8201;% relative humidity, attributed to its continuous and extensive hydrogen bonding network, which provides effective proton conduction pathways within the MOF. This work highlights a convenient strategy for designing proton&#8208;conducting MOFs via post&#8208;synthetic modification.

         <title>Electrochemical Synthesis of Itaconic Acid Derivatives via Chemodivergent Single and Double Carboxylation of Allenes with CO2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Allenoates prove competence in the synthesis of itaconic acid derivatives and tri&#8208;carboxylated compounds via site&#8208;selective electrochemical fixation of one or two molecules of CO2 (yields up to 87&#8201;%). Complete chemodivergency is realized via dedicated electrolytic conditions optimization.







Abstract
Leveraging electrochemistry, a new synthesis of non&#8208;natural derivatives of itaconic acid is proposed by utilizing carbon dioxide (CO2) as a valuable C1 synthon. An electrochemical cross&#8208;electrophile coupling between allenoates and CO2 was targeted, allowing for the synthesis of both mono&#8208; and di&#8208;carboxylation products in a catalyst&#8208; and additive&#8208;free environment (yields up to 87&#8201;%, 30 examples).

     alt="Electrochemical Synthesis of Itaconic Acid Derivatives via Chemodivergent Single and Double Carboxylation of Allenes with CO2"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allenoates prove competence in the synthesis of itaconic acid derivatives and tri-carboxylated compounds via site-selective electrochemical fixation of one or two molecules of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (yields up to 87&#8201;%). Complete chemodivergency is realized via dedicated electrolytic conditions optimization.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leveraging electrochemistry, a new synthesis of non-natural derivatives of itaconic acid is proposed by utilizing carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) as a valuable C1 synthon. An electrochemical cross-electrophile coupling between allenoates and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was targeted, allowing for the synthesis of both mono- and di-carboxylation products in a catalyst- and additive-free environment (yields up to 87&#8201;%, 30 examples). Elaboration of the model mono-carboxylation product, and detailed cyclovoltammetric, as well as mechanistic analyses complete the present investigation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Borospherene in the Nanohoop: Complexation and Aromaticity of Neutral and Dioxidized Cycloparaphenylene Supramolecules with B40 and C60 Fullerenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
[9]&#8208; and [10]&#8208;Cycloparaphenylenes encapsulate borospherene B40 forming host&#8208;guest complexes with comparable complexation energy to carbon fullerenes, exhibiting double host&#8208;guest aromaticity at the dioxidized state.







Abstract
Supramolecular complexes of carbon nanohoops with fullerenes play a key role for the design of novel nanomaterials with technological applications. Herein we investigate with density functional theory (DFT) methods the capability of neutral and dioxidized cycloparaphenylenes (CPPs) to encapsulate all&#8208;boron fullerene B40. Our results show that [9]CPP and [10]CPP are feasible host candidates to encapsulate B40 displaying comparable complexation energies with the all&#8208;carbon analog [10]CPP&#8835;C60. Upon dioxidation the host&#8208;guest interactions are not affected, whereas the positive charge is delocalized on the CPPs leading to global aromatic character of the hosts. Consequently, the dicationic complexes [n]CPP2+&#8835;B40 and [10]CPP2+&#8835;C60 display augmented global shielding cones that strongly shield the guests, as manifested by large upfield shifts in 11B&#8208;NMR and 13C&#8208;NMR signals. Hence, CPP complexes with carbon fullerenes can be extended borospherene B40 host&#8208;guest complexes, as well as to doubly oxidized species stabilized by global host aromaticity, expanding our understanding of carbon nanohoop complexes to boron&#8208;based fullerenes.

         <title>Achieving Non&#8208;Interfacial Blocking Zinc Ion Transport Based on MOF Derived Manganese Oxides and Amorphous Carbon Hybrid Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Base on the combination of co&#8208;precipitation method and carbonization, the architecture of non&#8208;interfacial blocking manganese oxides and amorphous carbon hybrid materials are synthesized. MOF&#8208;derived hybrid electrodes obtained a specific capacity of 132.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 under 2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, and it still has a specific capacity of 105&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 for 2000 cycles. In addition, the electrode reaction mechanism of MOF&#8208;derived hybrid electrodes in ZIBs is analyzed by ex&#8208;situ XRD and in&#8208;situ Raman tests and the model battery is assembled to present practical possibilities. This study provides an innovation strategy for efficient electron ion transport of Mn&#8208;based materials, and offers a route to the practical electrode of ZIBs.







Abstract
How to coordinate electron and ion transport behavior across scales and interfaces within ion battery electrodes? The exponential increase in surface area observed in nanoscale electrode materials results in an incomprehensibly vast spatial interval. Herein, to address the problems of volume expansion, dissolution of cathode material, and the charge accumulation problem existing in manganiferous materials for zinc ion batteries, metal organic framework is utilized to form the architecture of non&#8208;interfacial blocking ~10&#8197;nm Mn2O3 nanoparticles and amorphous carbon hybrid electrode materials, demonstrating a high specific capacity of 361&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 (0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1), and excellent cycle stability of 105&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 2000 cycles under 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. The uniform and non&#8208;separated disposition of Mn and C atoms constitutes an interconnected network with high electronic and ionic conductivity, minimizing issues like structural collapse and volume expansion of the electrode material during cycling. The cooperative insert mechanism of H+ and Zn2+ are analyzed via ex&#8208;situ XRD and in&#8208;situ Raman tests. The model battery is assembled to present practical possibilities. The results indicate that MOF&#8208;derived carbonization provides an effective strategy for exploring Mn&#8208;based electrode materials with high ion and electron transport capacity.

         <title>Symmetry&#8208;Breaking and Symmetry&#8208;Retaining Morphological Evolution of the Single Crystals of Cyclodextrin Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By introducing lower symmetry elements (&#946;&#8208;cyclodextrins and &#945;&#8208;cyclodextrins) into a high symmetry system (&#947;&#8208;cyclodextrin&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework), two different morphology evolution paths have been realized, representing symmetry&#8208;retaining and symmetry&#8208;breaking, respectively.







Abstract
The morphological symmetry&#8208;retaining and symmetry&#8208;breaking of single crystals of the &#947;&#8208;cyclodextrin metal&#8208;organic framework have been achieved via introducing lower symmetric &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrins and &#945;&#8208;cyclodextrins, respectively. &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrins led to a morphological evolution with retained symmetry from cubic to rhombic dodecahedra, while &#945;&#8208;cyclodextrins resulted in the original cubic crystal missing a vertex angle presenting symmetry&#8208;breaking behavior. The crystal structures of rhombic dodecahedra and angle&#8208;deficient crystals were confirmed through X&#8208;ray crystallography, and the mechanisms underlying the morphological transformation evolution were further analyzed. Our work not only provides a rare case realizing two different paths of morphological evolution in one system, but also encourages future efforts towards the evolution of artificial crystal systems in a natural way.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biomimetic capsid&#8208;like nanoshells (CLNs) were prepared through the solution self&#8208;assembly of poly (&#946;&#8208;phenethyl&#8208;L&#8208;aspartate) homopolypeptide (PPLA). The formation of CLNs follows an aggregation&#8208;fusion process, where the molecular flexibility of PPLA is crucial for the arrangement and fusion of subunits (SSA). These findings offer new perspectives for a deeper understanding of the formation pathways of CLNs derived from synthetic polymers.







Abstract
The preparation of capsid&#8208;like nanoshells and the elucidation of their formation pathways are crucial for the application potential of capsid&#8208;like nanomaterials. In this study, we have prepared biomimetic capsid&#8208;like nanoshells (CLNs) through the solution self&#8208;assembly of poly (&#946;&#8208;phenethyl&#8208;L&#8208;aspartate) homopolypeptide (PPLA). The formation of CLNs is governed by an aggregation&#8208;fusion mechanism. Initially, PPLA molecules self&#8208;assemble into small spherical assemblies as subunits and the initial nuclei are formed through fusing some subunits. Subsequently, additional subunits rapidly fuse onto these nuclei, leading to the growth of full or partial CLNs during the growth phase. Moreover, the suitable condition benefiting CLNs formation is clarified by a morphological phase diagram based on the initial PPLA concentration against water content. Molecular&#8208;level measurements suggest that the molecular flexibility of PPLA is a key factor in the arrangement and fusion of subunits for the formation of CLNs. These findings offer new perspectives for a deeper understanding of the formation pathways of capsid&#8208;like nanoshells derived from synthetic polymers.

         <title>Revisiting the Mechanism of Asymmetric Ni&#8208;Catalyzed Reductive Carbo&#8208;Carboxylation with CO2: The Additives Affect the Product Selectivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DFT methods were used to revisit the mechanism of the Ni&#8208;catalyzed reductive carbo&#8208;carboxylation of alkenes with CO2. Our results indicate that zinc salts can alter the product selectivity, whereas Mg(II) and Li(I) salts activate CO2 during C&#8722;CO2 bond formation.







Abstract
The mechanistic details of the asymmetric Ni&#8208;catalyzed reductive cyclization/carboxylation of alkenes with CO2 have been revisited using DFT methods. Emphasis was put on the enantioselectivity and the mechanistic role of Lewis acid additives and in&#8197;situ formed salts. Our results show that oxidative addition of the substrate is rate&#8208;limiting, with the formed Ni(II)&#8208;aryl intermediate preferring a triplet spin state. After reduction to Ni(I), enantioselective cyclization of the substrate occurs, followed by inner sphere carboxylation. Our proposed mechanism reproduces the experimentally observed enantiomeric excess and identifies critical C&#8722;H/O and C&#8722;H/N interactions that affect the selectivity. Further, our results highlight the beneficial effect of Lewis acids on CO2 insertion and suggest that in&#8197;situ formed salts influence if the 5&#8208;exo or 6&#8208;endo product will be formed.

         <title>Chiral Br&#248;nsted Acid&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Reaction via Vinylidene Ortho&#8208;Quinone Methides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A review of chiral Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric reaction via VQMs with emphasis on methodology innovation and mechanistic rationale is summarized. The remained challenges and opportunities for potential breakthroughs in this area are also presented.







Abstract
Vinylidene ortho&#8208;quinone methides (VQMs) have been proven to be versatile and crucial intermediates in the catalytic asymmetric reaction in last decade, and thus have drawn considerable concentrations on account of the practical application in the construction of enantiomerically pure functional organic molecules. However, in comparison to the well established chiral Br&#248;nsted base&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric reaction via VQMs, chiral Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;catalyzed reaction is rarely studied and there is no systematic summary to date. In this review, we summarize the recent advances in the chiral Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric reaction via VQMs according to three types of reactions: a) intermolecular asymmetric nucleophilic addition to VQMs; b) intermolecular asymmetric cycloaddition of VQMs; c) intramolecular asymmetric cyclization of VQMs. Finally, we put forward the remained challenges and opportunities for potential breakthroughs in this area.

         <title>Redox Behaviour and Redox Potentials of Dyes in Aqueous Buffers and Protic Ionic Liquids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Redox&#8208;active protic ionic liquids hold promise as low&#8208;cost, high energy density electrolytes for redox flow batteries. Their redox behaviour is similar to parent salts in pH&#8208;neutral aqueous buffer, although they may undergo different side reactions. In this work, fortuitous side&#8208;reactions yield quinone&#8208;imines which display promising electrochemistry for flow battery applications.







Abstract
Organic dyes hold promise as inexpensive electrochemically&#8208;active building blocks for new renewable energy technologies such as redox&#8208;flow batteries and dye&#8208;sensitised solar cells, especially if they display high oxidation and/or low reduction potentials in cheap, non&#8208;flammable solvents such as water or protic ionic liquids. Systematic computational and experimental characterisation of a representative selection of acidic and basic dyes in buffered aqueous solutions and propylammonium formate confirm that quinoid&#8208;type mechanisms impart electrochemical reversibility for the majority of systems investigated, including quinones, fused tricyclic heteroaromatics, indigo carmine and some aromatic nitrogenous species. Conversely, systems that generate longlived radical intermediates &#8211; arylmethanes, hydroquinones at high pH, azocyclic systems &#8211; tend to display irreversible electrochemistry, likely undergoing ring&#8208;opening, dimerisation and/or disproportionation reactions.

         <title>Improving Molecular&#8208;Dynamics Simulations for Solid&#8211;Liquid Interfaces with Machine&#8208;Learning Interatomic Potentials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have summarized the evolution of machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs), introduced some interesting examples applied at solid&#8208;liquid interfaces, and finally posed some prospects for the current challenge of MLIPs.







Abstract
Emerging developments in artificial intelligence have opened infinite possibilities for material simulation. Depending on the powerful fitting of machine learning algorithms to first&#8208;principles data, machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) can effectively balance the accuracy and efficiency problems in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, serving as powerful tools in various complex physicochemical systems. Consequently, this brings unprecedented enthusiasm for researchers to apply such novel technology in multiple fields to revisit the major scientific problems that have remained controversial owing to the limitations of previous computational methods. Herein, we introduce the evolution of MLIPs, provide valuable application examples for solid&#8211;liquid interfaces, and present current challenges. Driven by solving multitudinous difficulties in terms of the accuracy, efficiency, and versatility of MLIPs, this booming technique, combined with molecular simulation methods, will provide an underlying and valuable understanding of interdisciplinary scientific challenges, including materials, physics, and chemistry.

         <title>In Situ Generation and High Bioresistance of Trityl&#8208;based Semiquinone Methide Radicals Under Anaerobic Conditions in Cellular Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ quantitative generation of trityl&#8208;based semiquinone methide radical OXQM&#8901; in cellular systems has been achieved from the quinone methide OXQM under anaerobic conditions. OXQM&#8901; with an EPR single line signal at physiological pH exhibits unprecedented high stability against bioreduction and thus shows great application potential in in&#8208;cell magnetic resonance&#8208;related techniques.







Abstract
Bioreduction of spin labels and polarizing agents (generally stable radicals) has been an obstacle limiting the in&#8208;cell applications of pulsed electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy and dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP). In this work, we have demonstrated that two semiquinone methide radicals (OXQM&#8901; and CTQM&#8901;) can be easily produced from the trityl&#8208;based quinone methides (OXQM and CTQM) via reduction by various reducing agents including biothiols and ascorbate under anaerobic conditions. Both radicals have relatively low pKa's and exhibit EPR single line signals at physiological pH. Moreover, the bioreduction of OXQM in three cell lysates enables quantitative generation of OXQM&#8901; which was most likely mediated by flavoenzymes. Importantly, the resulting OXQM&#8901; exhibited extremely high stability in the E.coli lysate under anaerobic conditions with 76&#8208; and 14.3&#8208;fold slower decay kinetics as compared to the trityl OX063 and a gem&#8208;diethyl pyrrolidine nitroxide, respectively. Intracellular delivery of OXQM into HeLa cells was also achieved by covalent conjugation with a cell&#8208;permeable peptide as evidenced by the stable intracellular EPR signal from the OXQM&#8901; moiety. Owing to extremely high resistance of OXQM&#8901; towards bioreduction, OXQM and its derivatives show great application potential in in&#8208;cell EPR and in&#8208;cell DNP studies for various cells which can endure short&#8208;term anoxic treatments.

Reactive probes based on ABNOH&#8208;linked nucleotides, oligonucleotides or DNA were designed and synthesized for specific cross&#8208;linking and bioconjugation with tryptophan&#8208;containing peptides and proteins.







Abstract
Reactive N&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;9&#8208;azabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane (ABNOH) linked 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyuridine 5&#8242;&#8208;O&#8208;mono&#8208; and triphosphates were synthesized through a CuAAC reaction of ABNOH&#8208;PEG4&#8208;N3 with 5&#8208;ethynyl&#8208;dUMP or &#8208;dUTP. The modified triphosphate was used as substrate for enzymatic synthesis of modified DNA probes with KOD XL DNA polymerase. The keto&#8208;ABNO radical reacted with tryptophan (Trp) and Trp&#8208;containing peptides to form a stable tricyclic fused hexahydropyrrolo&#8208;indole conjugates. Similarly modified ABNOH&#8208;linked nucleotides reacted with Trp&#8208;containing peptides to form a stable conjugate in the presence but surprisingly even in the absence of NaNO2 (presumably through activation by O2). The reactive ABNOH&#8208;modified DNA probe was used for bioconjugations and crosslinking with Trp&#8208;containing peptides or proteins.

&lt;p&gt;Reactive &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-hydroxy-9-azabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane (ABNOH) linked 2&#8242;-deoxyuridine 5&#8242;-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-mono- and triphosphates were synthesized through a CuAAC reaction of ABNOH-PEG&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; with 5-ethynyl-dUMP or -dUTP. The modified triphosphate was used as substrate for enzymatic synthesis of modified DNA probes with KOD XL DNA polymerase. The keto-ABNO radical reacted with tryptophan (Trp) and Trp-containing peptides to form a stable tricyclic fused hexahydropyrrolo-indole conjugates. Similarly modified ABNOH-linked nucleotides reacted with Trp-containing peptides to form a stable conjugate in the presence but surprisingly even in the absence of NaNO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (presumably through activation by O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).
