         <title>Machine Learning&#8208;Guided Computational&#160;Screening of New Candidate Reactions with&#160;High Bioorthogonal Click Potential</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bioorthogonal click chemistry has become an indispensable part of the biochemist's toolbox. Despite the wide variety of applications that have been developed in recent years, only a limited number of bioorthogonal click reactions have been discovered so far, most of them based on (substituted) azides. In this work, we present a computational workflow to discover new candidate reactions with promising kinetic and thermodynamic properties for bioorthogonal click applications. Sampling only around 0.05% of an overall search space of over 10,000,000 dipolar cycloadditions, we develop a machine learning model able to predict DFT&#8208;computed activation and reaction energies within ~2&#8208;3 kcal/mol across the entire space. Applying this model to screen the full search space through iterative rounds of learning, we identify a broad pool of candidate reactions with rich structural diversity, which can be used as a starting point or source of inspiration for future experimental development of both azide&#8208;based and non&#8208;azide&#8208;based bioorthogonal click reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective transformations from nitriles to NH2&#8208;&#945;&#8208;tertiary amines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic molecules, containing one or more amine chiral centers, are very common to see in natural products and medicines. Although a large number of methods have been developed to afford enantiopure amines, most of the known approaches are limited with various reasons. For example, many methodologies start from nitrogen protected and activated substrates, which usually need multistep operations and seriously decrease the atom economy. Here we disclose a new catalytic strategy from commercial nitriles to high enantioselective &#945;&#8208;tertiary primary amines in up to 90% yield and 95% enantiomeric excess. This transformation firstly undergoes an addition process of organolithium reagents to nitriles to generate the imine intermediates in situ. Subsequently, the most challenging step is by employing copper catalytic enantioselective addition of AllylBpin to the imine intermediates to form the final amines in one pot.</dc:description>

         <title>Nanopore Deciphering Single Digital Polymers Towards&#160;High&#8208;Density Data Storage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sequence&#8208;defined polymer is one of the most promising alternative media for high&#8208;density data storage. It could be used to alleviate the problem of insufficient storage capacity of conventional silicon&#8208;based devices for the explosively increasing data. To fulfil the goal of polymer data storage, suitable methods should be developed to accurately read and decode the information&#8208;containing polymers, especially for those composed by a combination of the natural and unnatural monomers. Nanopore&#8208;based approaches have become one of the most competitive analysis and sequencing techniques, which are expected to read both natural and synthetic polymers with single&#8208;molecule precision and monomeric resolution. Herein, this work emphasizes the advances being made in nanopore reading and decoding of information stored in the man&#8208;made polymers and DNA nanostructures, and discusses the challenges and opportunities towards the development and realization of high&#8208;density data storage.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Applications of Bicyclo[1.1.0]butyl and Azabicyclo[1.1.0]butyl Organometallics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of metalated (aza)bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes in synthesis is currently experiencing a renaissance, as evidenced by the numerous reports in the last 5 years that have relied on such intermediates to undergo unique transformations or generate novel fragments. Since their discovery, these species have been demonstrated to participate in a wide range of reactions with carbon and heteroatom electrophiles, as well as metal complexes, to facilitate the rapid diversification of (aza)bicyclo[1.1.0]butane&#8208;containing compounds. Key to this is the relative acidity of the bridgehead C&#8210;H bonds which promotes facile deprotonation and subsequent functionalization of an unsubstituted position on the carbon framework via the intermediacy of a metalated (aza)bicyclo[1.1.0]butane. Additionally, the late&#8208;stage incorporation of deuterium atoms in strained fragments has led to the elucidation of numerous reaction mechanisms that involve strained bicycles. The continued investigation into the inimitable reactivity of metalated bicycles will cement their importance within the field of organometallic chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Cysteine&#8208;Selective Modification of Peptides and Proteins via Desulfurative C&#8722;C Bond Formation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cysteine&#8208;selective, visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated bioconjugation reaction that enables direct installation of a range of desired moieties into peptide and protein scaffolds via C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) bond formation is described. The method is rapid, operationally simple, tolerant to ambient atmosphere and can be utilized to incorporate general tools for chemical biology, including effective PTM mimics, via a stable, biogenic hydrocarbon linkage.







Abstract
The site&#8208;selective modification of peptides and proteins facilitates the preparation of targeted therapeutic agents and tools to interrogate biochemical pathways. Among the numerous bioconjugation techniques developed to install groups of interest, those that generate C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) bonds are significantly underrepresented despite affording proteolytically stable, biogenic linkages. Herein, a visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated reaction is described that enables the site&#8208;selective modification of peptides and proteins via desulfurative C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) bond formation. The reaction is rapid and high yielding in peptide systems, with comparable translation to proteins. Using this chemistry, a range of moieties is installed into model systems and an effective PTM&#8208;mimic is successfully integrated into a recombinantly expressed histone.

         <dc:description>
Photo&#8208;assisted metal air battery: The diagram exhibits an integrated photo&#8208;assisted metal air battery with the typical two&#8208;electrode configuration. This minireview introduces the general photo&#8208;assisted strategies and summarizes the recent advances of various photo&#8208;assisted metal air battery systems including Li&#8722;O2 battery, Zn&#8722;O2 battery and other metal&#8208;air batteries and highlights the remaining challenges and future opportunities.







Abstract
To meet the need of high energy density, long durability, safe and cost&#8208;efficient energy conversion and storage devices, metal&#8208;air batteries like Li&#8722;O2 and Zn&#8722;O2 batteries have received enormous attention and were subject to exciting development in the past decade. Photo&#8208;assisted strategies that enable the effective combination of photo/electric energy conversion/storage render a new dimension for the conventional metal&#8208;air batteries techniques with mere electric energy utilization. Therefore, tremendous research is ongoing in search of more efficient and durable devices with photo&#8208;assisted strategies. This review provides an overview of photo&#8208;assisted Li&#8722;O2 batteries, Zn&#8722;O2 batteries, and batteries with various metal/air components. The working mechanism, the basic device architecture and practical performances of various photo&#8208;assisted systems are summarized and discussed. Furthermore, certain technical challenges and future opportunities for the photo&#8208;assisted metal air batteries are emphasized and discussed in the hope of stimulating further research.

Synthesis of overcrowded negatively curved polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. A hexabrominated benzo&#8208;fused tris&#8208;cycloheptenylene was &#960;&#8208;extended by Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling to afford PAHs consisting of two heptagons and one octagon as a consequence of a ring&#8208;expanding 1,2&#8208;rearragement. This is due to the high steric demand. The title compounds display a blue to blue&#8208;green fluorescence and increased emission intensity as well as hypsochromic shifts in the solid state. More information can be found in the Research Article by K. M&#252;llen and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202203735).

         <title>Chromatic Selectivity of Coumarin&#8208;Caged Oligonucleotides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of green&#8208;light activatable DCCM photo&#8208;tethers allows efficient photocaging of oligonucleotides. In addition, DCCM can be used in combination with conventional blue&#8208;light absorbing DEACM to build an &#8220;orthogonal&#8221; system. It was suggested to rather use the term &#8220;chromatic selectivity&#8221; for which the necessary equations were provided. These showed that chromatic selectivity can even be adjusted by careful choice of starting material.







Abstract
A system of two coumarin&#8208;based caging groups is presented &#8211; one absorbing in the blue (400&#8211;450&#8197;nm) and the other absorbing in the green (480&#8211;550&#8197;nm) part of the visible spectrum. Together they form a pair, which allows to selectively photoactivate the one or the other in oligonucleotides. A numerical characterization defining the term &#8220;chromatic selectivity&#8221; was proposed, and it was shown how chromatically selective uncaging can literally be titrated in a kinetic reaction scheme.

         <title>Tin Active Sites Confined in Zeolite Framework as a Promising Shape&#8208;Selective Catalyst for Ethylene Oxide Hydration</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Topotactic conversion of germanosilicate UTL into stannosilicates Sn&#8208;PCR with various Sn contents have been realized through post&#8208;synthesis strategy. The Sn&#8208;PCR&#8208;20 (Si/Sn molar ratio of 77) catalyst served as a shape&#8208;selective nanoreactor for eco&#8208;efficient production of glycol.







Abstract
Shape&#8208;selective stannosilicates have been post&#8208;synthesized for the hydration of epoxide to diols. A simple acid treatment has been employed to remove extensively the interlayer double four ring units, converting the three&#8208;dimensional (3D) UTL germanosilicate into a 2D layered IPC&#8208;1P intermediate. Isomorphous incorporation of tetrahedrally coordinated Sn active centers was realized via solid&#8208;liquid treatment of IPC&#8208;1P with diammonium hexachlorostannate aqueous solution, which was accompanied by the spontaneous condensation of neighboring silica&#8208;rich cfi layers upon calcination and structural construction of a 3D PCR structure. Sn&#8208;PCR stannosilicates with tunable Sn contents were thus prepared. With Sn&#8208;derived robust Lewis acidity confined in the intersecting 10&#8208; and 8&#8208;ring channels, the Sn&#8208;PCR (Si/Sn molar ratio of 77) catalyst served as a shape&#8208;selective nanoreactor for the hydration of ethylene oxide (EO) into ethylene glycol (EG), exhibiting a remarkable EO conversion (99.5&#8201;%) as well as a steady EG selectivity (&gt;98.4&#8201;%) at greatly reduced H2O/EO molar ratio and near&#8208;ambient reaction temperature.

         <title>Excited&#8208;State Dynamics in Borylated Arylisoquinoline Complexes in Solution and in cellulo</title>

Four&#8208;coordinate organoboron N,C Chelates are used as fluorescence dyes in biological environment. Their excited&#8208;state properties within human MCF&#8208;7&#8197;cells are characterized by time&#8208;resolved pump&#8208;probe spectroscopy and fluorescence lifetime microscopy. Two chromophores show different features in cellulo depending on the nature of the anchored PEG chains. These findings underline that our approach can extend the information from FLIM and evaluate the excited&#8208;state properties of functional fluorophores in a complex biological environment.







Abstract
Two four&#8208;coordinate organoboron N,C&#8208;chelate complexes with different functional terminals on the PEG chains are studied with respect to their photophysical properties within human MCF&#8208;7&#8197;cells. Their excited&#8208;state properties are characterized by time&#8208;resolved pump&#8208;probe spectroscopy and fluorescence lifetime microscopy. The excited&#8208;state relaxation dynamics of the two complexes are similar when studied in DMSO. Aggregation of the complexes with the carboxylate terminal group is observed in water. When studying the light&#8208;driven excited&#8208;state dynamics of both complexes in cellulo, i.&#8201;e., after being taken up into human MCF&#8208;7&#8197;cells, both complexes show different features depending on the nature of the anchoring PEG chains. The lifetime of a characteristic intramolecular charge&#8208;transfer state is significantly shorter when studied in cellulo (360&#177;170&#8197;ps) as compared to in DMSO (&#8764;960&#8197;ps) at 600&#8197;nm for the complexes with an amino group. However, the kinetics of the complexes with the carboxylate group are in line with those recorded in DMSO. On the other hand, the lifetimes of the fluorescent state are almost identical for both complexes in cellulo. These findings underline the importance to evaluate the excited&#8208;state properties of fluorophores in a complex biological environment in order to fully account for intra&#8208; and intermolecular effects governing the light&#8208;induced processes in functional dyes.

Abstract
Herein, we report the design and scalable synthesis of three new Co(III) complexes, which have an unusual hydrocarbon &#951;1&#8208;alkyl&#8208;&#951;3&#8208;allyl&#8208;&#951;5&#8208;cyclopentadienyl ligation structure, from the reactions of readily available cobalt(II) compound CoCl2(PPh3)2 and biomass material &#946;&#8208;pinene via C&#8722;C bond activation. These Co(III) complexes are air&#8208;stable, fairly volatile, and thermally stable, so they are excellent candidates as the metal precursors for the vapor deposition of cobalt&#8208;containing thin films. As a demonstration, we show that the Co(III) complex of [(3&#8217;&#8208;5&#8217;&#8208;&#951;,1&#8208;&#963;)&#8208;methylene(2,2,4&#8208;trimethyl&#8208;4&#8208;cyclohexene&#8208;1,3&#8208;diyl)](&#951;5&#8208;methylcyclopentadienyl)Co (i.&#8201;e.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herein, we report the design and scalable synthesis of three new Co(III) complexes, which have an unusual hydrocarbon &lt;i&gt;&#951;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;-alkyl-&lt;i&gt;&#951;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;-allyl-&lt;i&gt;&#951;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;-cyclopentadienyl ligation structure, from the reactions of readily available cobalt(II) compound CoCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(PPh&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and biomass material &lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;-pinene via C&#8722;C bond activation. These Co(III) complexes are air-stable, fairly volatile, and thermally stable, so they are excellent candidates as the metal precursors for the vapor deposition of cobalt-containing thin films. As a demonstration, we show that the Co(III) complex of [(3&#8217;-5&#8217;-&lt;i&gt;&#951;&lt;/i&gt;,1-&lt;i&gt;&#963;&lt;/i&gt;)-methylene(2,2,4-trimethyl-4-cyclohexene-1,3-diyl)](&lt;i&gt;&#951;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;-methylcyclopentadienyl)Co (i.&#8201;e. (&lt;i&gt;seco&lt;/i&gt;-pinene)(MeCp)Co) is well suited for the atomic layer deposition (ALD) of Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and CoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; thin films, and the deposited Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and CoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; films are able to conformally cover trench structures with a fairly high aspect ratio of 10&#8201;:&#8201;1.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Substituent&#8208;Dependent Photoexcitation Processes of &#960;&#8208;Stacked Ion Pairs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Various combinations of charged porphyrins with controlled electronic states were achieved by ion&#8208;pair metathesis based on the HSAB theory. The transient absorption spectra of the porphyrin ion pairs revealed photoinduced electron transfer from the anion to the cation through substituent&#8208;dependent photoexcitation processes. More information can be found in the Research Article by Y. Kobayashi, H. Maeda, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202203957).

         <title>Cumulative Effect of pH and Redox Triggers on Highly Adaptive Transient Coacervates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An intricate synergism between multiple biochemical processes and physical conditions determines the formation and function of various biological self&#8208;assemblies. Thus, a complex set of variables dictate the far&#8208;from&#8208;equilibrium nature of these biological assemblies. Mimicking such systems synthetically is a challenging task. We report multi&#8208;stimuli responsive transient coacervation of an aldehyde&#8208;appended polymer and a short peptide. The coacervates are formed by the disulphide linkages between the peptide molecules and the imine bond between the polymer and the peptide. Imines are susceptible to pH changes and the disulphide bonds can be tuned by oxidation/reduction processes. Thus, the coacervation is operational only under the combined effect of appropriate pH and oxidative conditions. Taking advantage of these facts, the coacervates are transiently formed under a pH cycle (urea &#8211; urease /gluconolactone) and a non&#8208;equilibrium redox cycle (TCEP/H2O2). Importantly, the system showed high adaptability toward environmental changes. The transient existence of the coacervates can be generated without any apparent change in size and shape within the same system through the sequential application of the abovementioned nonequilibrium reaction cycles. Additionally, the coacervation allows for efficient encapsulation/stabilisation of proteins. Thus, the system has the potential to be used for</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Herein we present a systematic study of the influence of different alkyl chains in malonyl ester fullerene adducts with [10]cycloparaphenylene ([10]CPP]) and a tert&#8208;butyl (tBu) ester substituted [10]CPP analogue. The association constants between the nanoring hosts and the fullerene guests were determined by fluorescence quenching experiments. The trends in association were rationalized by an interplay of repulsion arising from an extended volume and London dispersion as an attractive counterpart.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two&#8208;photon (2P) activatable probes are of high value in biological and medical chemistry since near infrared (NIR) light can penetrate deeply even in blood&#8208;perfused tissue and due to the intrinsic three&#8208;dimensional activation properties. Designing two&#8208;photon chromophores is challenging. However, the two&#8208;photon absorption qualities of a photocage can be improved with an intramolecular sensitizer, which transfers the absorbed light onto the cage. We herein present the synthesis and photophysical characterization of a 2P&#8208;sensitive uncaging dyad based on rhodamine 101 as donor fluorophore and a redshifted BODIPY as acceptor photocage. Liberation of p&#8208;nitroaniline (PNA) upon one&#8208;photon photolysis was confirmed by HPLC analysis. The photoreaction was found to be accompanied by a considerable change of the fluorescence properties of the chromophores. The possibility of a fluorescent readout enabled the detection of two&#8208;photon induced uncaging by confocal fluorescence microscopy.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A N&#8208;hydroxy succinimide (NHS)&#8208;ester substituted bis(acyl)phosphane oxide (ACTIVE&#8208;BAPO) was prepared via phospha&#8208;Michael addition and used for an easy one&#8208;step BAPO ligation with substrates containing primary amino groups such as amino acids, proteins and poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) dendrimers. Thereby a range of new molecular and polymeric photoinitators was obtained. Real&#8208;time photo&#8208;rheology experiments demonstrated the outstanding efficiency of the PAMAM BAPOs as photoinitiators for free radical polymerization. Remarkably, it is found that PAMAM BAPOs also act as crosslinking agents to convert monofunctional methacrylate monomers into thermosetting networks without any further additives. Depending on the number of the attached BAPOs, thermosets with a different degree of crosslinking and swelling capability in water were obtained.</dc:description>

         <title>CoNi2S4 Electrode with High Mass&#8208;loading for High&#8208;energy&#8208;density Supercapacitor: Role of S&#8208;containing Anions Exchange</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Anion exchange is recognized as an effective method to regulate the composition, electronic conductivity, and electrochemical behavior of the transition metal&#8208;based compounds. In this work, anion exchange is adopted as a rational post&#8208;treatment route to facilitate the capacitive activity of CoNi2S4 nanoparticle arrays grown on carbon cloth (CC) with high mass&#8208;loading. As soaked in saturated Na2S solution, the CoNi2S4/CC electrode showed an increased capacity from 483 C g&#8208;1 to 841 C g&#8208;1 at 10 mA cm&#8208;2 with excellent rate performance and stable cycling performance, which was superior to the CoNi2S4/CC electrode activated by NaBH4 reduction. Anion exchange was beneficial for enhancing the crystallinity, retaining the adhesion of nanoarrays, and realizing low resistance nature in a mild route. The as&#8208;assembled CoNi2S4/CC//activated CC hybrid supercapacitor delivered a high areal capacitance of 1.28 F cm&#8722;2 at 5 mA cm&#8208;2, and achieved an energy density of 0.58 mWh cm&#8722;2 at a power density of 4.5 mW cm&#8722;2 with excellent cycle stability with 90.6% capacity retention after 10,000 cycles.</dc:description>

As soaked in saturated Na2S solution, the CoNi2S4/CC electrode showed an increased capacity from 483 C g-1 to 841 C g-1 at 10 mA cm-2 with excellent rate performance and stable cycling performance, which was superior to the CoNi2S4/CC electrode activated by NaBH4 reduction. Anion exchange was beneficial for enhancing the crystallinity, retaining the adhesion of nanoarrays, and realizing low resistance nature in a mild route. The as-assembled CoNi2S4/CC//activated CC hybrid supercapacitor delivered a high areal capacitance of 1.28 F cm&#8722;2 at 5 mA cm-2, and achieved an energy density of 0.58 mWh cm&#8722;2 at a power density of 4.5 mW cm&#8722;2 with excellent cycle stability with 90.6% capacity retention after 10,000 cycles.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Strain&#8208;Sensitive On&#8208;Surface Ladderization by Non&#8208;Dehydrogenative Heterocyclization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
On&#8208;surface non&#8208;dehydrogenative cyclization leads to low&#8208;temperature formation of pyrrolopyrrole&#8208;bridged ladder oligomer with an unprecedented high ratio of nitrogen and carbon of 1&#8201;:&#8201;4. The reaction barrier of the ladderization is sufficiently low as the small segment of the ladder units already appeared at 40&#8201;&#176;C. However, once the long linear oligomer as the intermediate is synthesized, the reaction barrier significantly increases since the orientation of the unit has to be rotated, which is the origin of the strain&#8208;sensitive on&#8208;surface ladderization.







Abstract
On&#8208;surface cyclodehydrogenation recently became an important reaction to planarize &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules and oligomers. However, the high&#8208;activation barrier to cleave the C&#8722;H bond often requires high&#8208;temperature annealing, consequently restricting structures of precursor molecules and/or leading to random fusion at their edges. Here, we present a synthesis of pyrrolopyrrole&#8208;bridged ladder oligomers from 11,11,12,12&#8208;tetrabromo&#8208;1,4,5,8&#8208;tetraaza&#8208;9,10&#8208;anthraquinodimethane molecules on Ag(111) with bond&#8208;resolved scanning tunnelling microscopy. This non&#8208;dehydrogenative cyclization between pyrazine and ethynylene/cumulene groups has a low&#8208;activation barrier for forming intermediary dimeric oligomer containing dipyrazinopyrrolopyrrolopyrazine units, thus giving new insight into the strain&#8208;sensitive in ladder&#8208;oligomer formation.

         <title>Paramagnetic Liquid Crystals With Close &#960;&#8211;&#960; Packing: The Effect of Blatter Radical Planarization on Behavior of Bent&#8208;Core Mesogens</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A diphenol containing 19&#8208;&#960; delocalized electrons was developed as a general intermediate to paramagnetic columnar and lamellar liquid crystals with close &#960;&#8211;&#960; contacts for electronic applications.







Abstract
A new, 19 &#960;&#8208;delocalized electrons planar Blatter radical building block was developed and used to obtain paramagnetic bent&#8208;core liquid crystals. The mesogens were investigated by optical, thermal, powder XRD and DFT methods in the pure form and as binary mixtures. Comparison of their properties with those of the classical Blatter radical analogues revealed that planarization of the central angular element results in a significantly higher stability of the mesophases and increased molecular organization suitable for the formation of ordered banana and columnar mesophases with tighter &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions. These results indicate access to a new, potentially rich class of functional paramagnetic soft materials.

         <title>Pro&#8208;aromaticity Enabled Dealkenylative Functionalizations via Photo&#8208;excitation and Oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A general and practical approach for diverse dealkenylative functionalization of olefin&#8208;containing substrates has been developed through the one&#8208;pot formation and utilization of pro&#8208;aromatic 1,4&#8208;dihydropyridazines using tetrazine as the key cycloaddition reagent. Triggered by either excitation or oxidation, the targeted C&#8722;C bonds in the 1,4&#8208;dihydropyridazine intermediates could be readily cleaved to generate alkyl radicals for subsequent transformations. Diverse carbon&#8208;carbon and carbon&#8208;hetero bond forming protocols, including Giese&#8208;type addition, hydrazination, borylation, Minisci&#8208;type alkylation, copper&#8208;catalyzed NH alkylation, acylation, alkynylation, cyanation, and azidation, are achieved in a highly modular fashion.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual Chemiexcitation by a Unique Dioxetane Scaffold Gated by an OR Logic Set of Triggers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemiexcitation of phenoxy&#8208;1,2&#8208;dioxetane chemiluminescent luminophores is initiated by electron transfer from a&#160;meta&#8208;positioned phenolate ion to the peroxide&#8208;dioxetane bond. Here we report the development of a unique 1,2&#8208;dioxetane chemiluminescent scaffold with chemiexcitation gated by an OR logic dual&#8208;set of triggering events. This scaffold is composed of&#160;meta&#8208;dihydroxyphenyl&#8208;1,2&#8208;dioxetane&#8208;adamantyl molecules, equipped with&#160;acrylic acid and chlorine substituents, that&#160;chemiexcitation&#160;under physiological conditions.&#160;A dual&#8208;mode chemiluminescent probe, armed with two different triggering substrates designed for activation by the enzymes&#160;&#946;&#8208;galactosidase and alkaline phosphatase, was synthesized.&#160;The probe emitted intense&#160;light signals in the response to each enzyme, demonstrating its ability to serve as a single&#8208;component chemiluminescent sensor for dual&#8208;analyte detection. We also demonstrated the ability of the probe to detect&#160;&#946;&#8208;galactosidase and of phosphatase activities in bacteria. This is the first&#160;1,2&#8208;dioxetane scaffold capable of response to two different chemiexcitation events from two different positions on the same dioxetane molecule.We anticipate that the OR&#8208;gated mode of chemiexcitation, described herein, will find utility in preparation of&#160;chemiluminescent&#160;probes with a dual&#8208;analyte detection/imaging mode.</dc:description>

         <title>SnS&#8208;SnO2 heterostructures anchored on GO as a high&#8208;performance anode for Sodium ion battery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>SnO2 is a theoretically excellent transformed anode material with high theoretical capacity for SIBs. However, SnO2 faces serious volume effect and high resistance, which greatly damages its electrochemical performance. Given that, the SnS&#8208;SnO2 heterostructures is constructed with special internal electric field, which is beneficial to promote the transfer ability of sodium ions. Besides, the graphene oxide (GO) modification is carried out to isolate intrinsic materials from direct contact with electrolyte, and alleviate volume expansion of the anode, ultimately promote the electrochemical performance. Furthermore, the structure and the conductivity characteristics of SnS, SnO2, SnS&#8208;SnO2 and SnS&#8208;SnO2@ GO are simulated respectively by first principles, and are compared with the correspondence experiment results to verify the accuracy of established models. Owing to the special p&#8208;n junction in SnS&#8208;SnO2@GO heterostructures, the resistance of SnS&#8208;SnO2@GO can be reduced to 36.23 &#937;, much lower than SnO2 (Rct=341.9 &#937;). Notably, the combination of GO effectively alleviate volume expansion of SnS&#8208;SnO2@GO electrode, and present excellent capacity higher than 384.7 mAh&#183;g&#8208;1 after 100 cycles. Thus, the efficient synthesis of SnS&#8208;SnO2@GO heterostructures and excellent performance for sodium storage is expected to provide valuable direction for SIBs anode materials.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) exhibit attractive photophysical properties by combining the excellent optoelectronic properties of bulk perovskites with the strong quantum confinement effect at the nanoscale. However, CsPbI3 NCs easily transform into a non&#8208;perovskite phase because of the ionic lattice and dynamic ligand binding. Here, we report stable black&#8208;phase CsPbI3 NCs capped with a new organic ligand, HO&#8208;PS&#8208;N3 (HOPS), which consists of a polystyrene segment with hydroxyl and azide end groups. This organic polymer ligand passivated the surface defects and enhanced the stability of CsPbI3 NCs by exposing the linking hydrophobic polystyrene segment. Consequently, the optimized CsPbI3 NCs exhibit significantly improved resistance to moisture or light and maintained 70% of the original luminous intensity after immersion in water for two months. The theoretical results revealed that the binding energy of the HOPS ligand on the surface of the CsPbI3 NCs is higher than that of the commonly used oleic acid, alleviating the defects&#8208;induced degradation during purification. Thus, surface&#8208;stabilized CsPbI3 NCs are beneficial for a broad range of optoelectronic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>LiHMDS&#8208;Mediated Deprotonative Coupling of Toluenes with Ketones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lithium hexamethyldisilazide (LiHMDS) acts as an effective base for deprotonative coupling reactions of toluenes with ketones. Various functionalities are allowed on the toluenes. Notably, this system proved successful with low&#8208;reactive toluenes bearing a large pKa value compared to that of the conjugate acid of LiHMDS (hexamethyldisilazane, 25.8, THF), as demonstrated by 4&#8208;phenyltoluene (38.57, THF) and toluene itself (&#8764;43, DMSO).







Abstract
We demonstrate that lithium hexamethyldisilazide (LiHMDS) acts as an effective base for deprotonative coupling reactions of toluenes with ketones to afford stilbenes. Various functionalities (halogen, OCF3, amide, Me, aryl, alkenyl, alkynyl, SMe, and SPh) are allowed on the toluenes. Notably, this system proved successful with low&#8208;reactive toluenes bearing a large pKa value compared to that of the conjugate acid of LiHMDS (hexamethyldisilazane, 25.8, THF), as demonstrated by 4&#8208;phenyltoluene (38.57, THF) and toluene itself (&#8764;43, DMSO).

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Tandem Coupling Method for the Short&#8208;Step Formal Synthesis of Riccardin C</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A formal total synthesis of riccardin C was achieved by a sequential five&#8208;steps four&#8208;component one&#8208;pot tandem coupling method. By optimizing each step, four individual units were connected by two Sonogashira coupling reactions and one Suzuki coupling reaction, followed by diimide reduction and acid deprotection.







Abstract
One&#8208;pot reactions reduce reagent amounts and circumvent process treatments, such as work&#8208;up and purifications in multi&#8208;step reactions. In this study, we achieved the formal total synthesis of riccardin C through a one&#8208;pot reaction by simultaneously linking four units through two Sonogashira coupling reactions and one Suzuki coupling reaction, followed by reduction and deprotection. Thus, this one&#8208;pot method comprised five steps and did not require the purification of intermediate reaction mixtures, which saves resources, such as reagents and solvents, and expedites the work process.

         <title>Guanidine&#8208;Functionalized Fluorescent sp2 Carbon&#8208;Conjugated Covalent Organic Framework for Sensing and Capture of Pd(II) and Cr(VI) Ions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultra&#8208;sensitive detection, capture, and recovery/removal of Pd(II) and Cr(VI) ions by guanidine&#8208;modified fluorescent sp2 carbon&#8208;conjugated covalent organic framework is reported.







Abstract
Palladium is a key element in fuel cells, electronic industries, and organic catalysis. At the same time, chromium is essential in leather, electroplating, and metallurgical industries. However, their unpremeditated leakage into aquatic systems has caused human health and environmental apprehensions. Herein, we reported the development of an sp2 carbon&#8208;conjugated fluorescent covalent organic framework with a guanidine moiety (sp2c&#8208;gCOF) that showed excellent thermal and chemical stability. The sp2c&#8208;gCOF showed effective sensing, capture, and recovery/removal of Pd(II) and Cr(VI) ions, which could be due to the highly accessible pore walls decorated with guanidine moieties. The fluorescent sp2c&#8208;gCOF showed higher selectivity for Pd(II) and Cr(VI) ions, with an ultra&#8208;low detection limit of 2.7 and 3.2&#8197;nM, respectively. The analysis of the adsorption properties with a pseudo&#8208;second&#8208;order kinetic model showed that sp2c&#8208;gCOF could successfully and selectively remove both Pd(II) and Cr(VI) ions from aqueous solutions. The polymer also showed excellent capture efficacy even after seven consecutive adsorption&#8208;desorption cycles. Hence, this study reveals the potential of fluorescent sp2c&#8208;gCOF for detecting, removing, and recovering valuable metals and hazardous ions from wastewater, which would be useful for economic benefit, environmental safety, human health, and sustainability. The post&#8208;synthetic modification of sp2c&#8208;COF with suitable functionalities could also be useful for sensing and extracting other water pollutants and valuable materials from an aqueous system.

Local interactions: Study of dioxygen binding and 2OG coordination by using two model 2OG enzymes &#8211; a class&#8197;7 histone demethylase (PHF8) and the ethylene&#8208;forming enzyme (EFE) &#8211; showing the role played by the protein environment in dioxygen transport and how the binding mode of dioxygen in the iron center is affected by SCS interactions.







Abstract
This study investigates dioxygen binding and 2&#8208;oxoglutarate (2OG) coordination by two model non&#8208;heme FeII/2OG enzymes: a class&#8197;7 histone demethylase (PHF8) that catalyzes the hydroxylation of its H3K9me2 histone substrate leading to demethylation reactivity and the ethylene&#8208;forming enzyme (EFE), which catalyzes two competing reactions of ethylene generation and substrate l&#8208;Arg hydroxylation. Although both enzymes initially bind 2OG by using an off&#8208;line 2OG coordination mode, in PHF8, the substrate oxidation requires a transition to an in&#8208;line mode, whereas EFE is catalytically productive for ethylene production from 2OG in the off&#8208;line mode. We used classical molecular dynamics (MD), quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) MD and QM/MM metadynamics (QM/MM&#8208;MetD) simulations to reveal that it is the dioxygen binding process and, ultimately, the protein environment that control the formation of the in&#8208;line FeIII&#8208;OO&#8901;&#8722; intermediate in PHF8 and the off&#8208;line FeIII&#8208;OO&#8901;&#8722; intermediate in EFE.

         <title>Thermoresponse of Odd&#8208;Even Effect in n&#8208;Alkanethiolate Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayers on Gold Substrates
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermoresponse of odd&#8208;even effect in alkanethiolate SAMs is investigated with contact&#8208;angle goniometry and vibrational sum frequency generation spectroscopy. The thermoresponse significantly depends on the supramolecular packing feature of SAMs, and the opposite conformational change is observed for odd and even carbon numbers.







Abstract
This study examines thermoresponse of odd&#8208;even effect in self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) of n&#8208;alkanethiolates (SCn, n=3&#8211;18) formed on template&#8208;stripped gold (AuTS) using macro&#8208; and microscopic analytical techniques, contact angle goniometry (CAG) and vibrational sum frequency generation (VSFG) spectroscopy, respectively. Both CAG and VSFG analyses showed that the odd&#8208;even effect in liquid&#8208;like SAMs (n=3&#8211;9) disappeared upon heating at 50&#8211;70&#8201;&#176;C, indicating that the heating led to increased structural disorder regardless of odd and even carbon numbers. In contrast, the opposite thermoresponse was observed for odd and even SCn molecules in wax&#8208; and solid&#8208;like SAMs (n=10&#8211;18). Namely, temperature&#8208;dependent orientational change of terminal CH3 relative to the surface normal was opposite for the odd and even molecules, thereby leading to mitigated odd&#8208;even effect. Our work offers important insights into thermoresponse of supramolecular structure in condensed organic matter.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Thermoresponse of odd-even effect&lt;/b&gt; in alkanethiolate SAMs is investigated with contact-angle goniometry and vibrational sum frequency generation spectroscopy. The thermoresponse significantly depends on the supramolecular packing feature of SAMs, and the opposite conformational change is observed for odd and even carbon numbers.

         <title>Magneto&#8208;Structural Correlations in a Mixed Porphyrin(Cu2+)/Trityl Spin System: Magnitude, Sign, and Distribution of the Exchange Coupling Constant</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of multi&#8208;frequency continuous&#8208;wave electron paramagnetic resonance and density functional theory calculations were used to determine the magnitude, sign, and distribution of the exchange coupling constant J in a biradical consisting of a trityl radical and a copper(II)tetraphenylporphyrin. The ferromagnetic exchange coupling and its distribution are related to the structure and dynamics of the biradical.







Abstract
Tetrathiatriarylmethyl radicals (TAM or trityl) are receiving increasing attention in various fields of magnetic resonance such as imaging, dynamic nuclear polarization, spin labeling, and, more recently, molecular magnetism and quantum information technology. Here, a trityl radical attached via a phenyl bridge to a copper(II)tetraphenylporphyrin was synthesized, and its magnetic properties studied by multi&#8208;frequency continuous&#8208;wave electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy and magnetic measurements. EPR revealed that the electron spin&#8208;spin coupling constant J between the trityl and Cu2+ spin centers is ferromagnetic with a magnitude of &#8722;2.3&#8197;GHz (&#8722;0.077&#8197;cm&#8722;1, 
 convention) and a distribution width of 1.2&#8197;GHz (0.040&#8197;cm&#8722;1). With the help of density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the obtained ferromagnetic exchange coupling, which is unusual for para&#8208;substituted phenyl&#8208;bridged biradicals, could be related to the almost perpendicular orientation of the phenyl linker with respect to the porphyrin and trityl ring planes in the energy minimum, while the J distribution was rationalized by the temperature weighted rotation of the phenyl bridge about the molecular axis connecting both spin centers. This study exemplifies the importance of molecular dynamics for the homogeneity (or heterogeneity) of the magnetic properties of trityl&#8208;based systems.

         <title>Mechanistic Insights into the Metal&#8208;Free Deoxygenative Borylation of Ketones and Aldehydes with Bis(catecholato)diborane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DFT calculations on the deoxygenative triboration/monoboration of ketones and aldehydes with B2cat2 revealed that the in&#8197;situ formed 1,2&#8208;B2cat2 rather than 1,1&#8208;B2cat2 is the key borylation intermediate. The solvent N,N&#8208;dimethylacetamide plays an important role in the isomerization from 1,1&#8208; B2cat2 to 1,2&#8208;B2cat2 and promotes some intermediate processes.







Abstract
The mechanisms of direct deoxygenative borylation of acetone and benzaldehyde with bis(catecholato)diborane (B2cat2) in the solvent N,N&#8208;dimethylacetamide (DMA) are investigated through detailed density functional theory calculations. These calculations show that the isomer 1,2&#8208;B2cat2 in&#8197;situ generated from 1,1&#8208;B2cat2 induced by DMA is the reactive boron intermediate for the reactions. The addition of the B&#8722;B bond of 1,2&#8208;B2cat2 to the C=O bond of acetone or benzaldehyde via a concerted [2&#963;+2&#960;]&#8208;cycloaddition&#8208;like transition state is the rate&#8208;limiting step for both the triboration reaction of acetone and the monoboration reaction of benzaldehyde. DMA not only acts as the solvent but also promotes the structural isomerization of B2cat2, the deoxygenation of acetone to form the vinyl boronate intermediate and subsequent diboration of vinyl boronate with 1,2&#8208;B2cat2, as well as the protodeboronation of the gem&#8208;diboronate intermediate in the deoxygenative borylation of benzaldehyde. The presented computational results can explain the observed experimental facts and provide insight into the roles of the isomeric 1,2&#8208;B2cat2 and the solvent DMA in related reactions.

         <title>Role of Counterions in the Structural Stabilisation of Redox&#8208;Active Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Revealing the role of counterions: Redox&#8208;active metal&#8208;organic frameworks often rely on counterions to access specific charge states of the components. We show, through a quantum chemical investigation, that the counterion can play an important steric role in the structural stabilisation of such frameworks beyond pure charge balancing effects.







Abstract
The crystal structures of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are typically determined by the strong chemical bonds formed between the organic and inorganic building units. However, the latest generation of redox&#8208;active frameworks often rely on counterions in the pores to access specific charge states of the components. Here, we model the crystal structures of three layered MOFs based on the redox&#8208;active ligand 2,5&#8208;dihydroxybenzoquinone (dhbq): Ti2(Cl2dhbq)3, V2(Cl2dhbq)3 and Fe2(Cl2dhbq)3 with implicit and explicit counterions. Our full&#8208;potential first&#8208;principles calculations indicate that while the reported hexagonal structure is readily obtained for Ti and V, the Fe framework is stabilised only by the presence of explicit counterions. For high counterion concentrations, we observe the formation of an electride&#8208;like pocket in the pore center. An outlook is provided on the implications of solvent and counterion control for engineering the structures and properties of porous solids.

         <title>Enhancing the Magnetization Blocking Energy of Biradical&#8208;Metal System by Merging Discrete Complexes into One&#8208;Dimensional Chains</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The pentanuclear fragments and one&#8208;dimensional chains of 2p&#8211;3d&#8208;4f are achieved using a new nitronyl nitroxide biradical through changing reaction temperature. The different magnetic relaxation features are observed for two Dy derivatives, in which the enhanced magnetic relaxation behavior of 1D compound could be attributed to the long&#8208;range ferromagnetic interaction.







Abstract
The reaction of nitronyl nitroxide biradical NITPhMeImbis [5&#8208;(2&#8208;methylimidazole)&#8208;1,3&#8208;bis(1&#8208;oxyl&#8208;3&#8217;&#8208;oxido&#8208;4&#8217;,4&#8217;,5&#8217;,5&#8217;&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;4,5&#8208;hydro&#8208;1H&#8208;imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;benzene] with Ln(hfac)3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H2O and Cu(hfac)2 (hfac=hexafluoroacetylacetonate), led to two series of 2p&#8211;3d&#8208;4f complexes, namely, nona&#8208;spin clusters, [Ln2Cu3(hfac)12(NITPhMeImbis)2] (Ln=Gd 1, Dy 2), or one&#8208;dimensional chains [LnCu2(hfac)7(NITPhMeImbis)] (Ln=Y 3, Dy 4, Tb 5) depending on the temperature of the reaction. All five complexes contain a biradical&#8208;Ln unit in which the biradical chelates the LnIII ion by the means of one aminoxyl (i.&#8201;e. NO) group of each NIT unit. For the discrete complexes, a Cu(hfac)2 links two biradical&#8208;Ln units via one of the remaining NO groups, while for the chain compounds, the two remaining NO groups of the biradical&#8208;Ln moiety are each coordinated to a Cu(hfac)2 unit to form a 1D coordination polymer. Moreover, a terminal Cu(hfac)2 unit is coordinated to the imidazole&#8208;N atom of the NITPhMeImbis ligand. Spin dynamics investigations evidenced the onset of slow relaxation of the magnetization for 2, whereas 4 and 5 exhibit a typical single&#8208;chain magnet behavior. This highlights the vital role of the 1D spin correlation in the blocking of the magnetization. These results illustrate that from the same basic building blocks, magnetic relaxation can be carefully modulated by structural adjustments.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The pentanuclear fragments&lt;/b&gt; and one-dimensional chains of 2&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&#8211;3&lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;-4&lt;i&gt;f&lt;/i&gt; are achieved using a new nitronyl nitroxide biradical through changing reaction temperature. The different magnetic relaxation features are observed for two Dy derivatives, in which the enhanced magnetic relaxation behavior of 1D compound could be attributed to the long-range ferromagnetic interaction.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reaction of nitronyl nitroxide biradical NITPhMeImbis [5-(2-methylimidazole)-1,3-bis(1-oxyl-3&#8217;-oxido-4&#8217;,4&#8217;,5&#8217;,5&#8217;-tetramethyl-4,5-hydro-1&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-imidazol-2-yl)-benzene] with Ln(hfac)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and Cu(hfac)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (hfac=hexafluoroacetylacetonate), led to two series of 2&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&#8211;3&lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;-4&lt;i&gt;f&lt;/i&gt; complexes, namely, nona-spin clusters, [Ln&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(hfac)&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;(NITPhMeImbis)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] (Ln=Gd &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;, Dy &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;), or one-dimensional chains [LnCu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(hfac)&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;(NITPhMeImbis)] (Ln=Y &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;, Dy &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;, Tb &lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt;) depending on the temperature of the reaction. All five complexes contain a biradical-Ln unit in which the biradical chelates the Ln&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; ion by the means of one aminoxyl (i.&#8201;e. NO) group of each NIT unit. For the discrete complexes, a Cu(hfac)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; links two biradical-Ln units via one of the remaining NO groups, while for the chain compounds, the two remaining NO groups of the biradical-Ln moiety are each coordinated to a Cu(hfac)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; unit to form a 1D coordination polymer. Moreover, a terminal Cu(hfac)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; unit is coordinated to the imidazole-N atom of the NITPhMeImbis ligand. Spin dynamics investigations evidenced the onset of slow relaxation of the magnetization for &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;, whereas &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt; exhibit a typical single-chain magnet behavior. This highlights the vital role of the 1D spin correlation in the blocking of the magnetization. These results illustrate that from the same basic building blocks, magnetic relaxation can be carefully modulated by structural adjustments.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Guided Isolation of An Uncommon Cembranoid Orthoester, Sarcotortin A, and Three Skeletal Diverse Terpenoids from the Hainan Soft Coral Sarcophyton tortuosum Based on Molecular Networking Strategy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chemical study on the Hainan soft coral Sarcophyton tortuosum under the guidance of emerging molecular networking strategy led to the isolation and full characterization of an uncommon cembranoid orthoester, sarcotortin A (1), featuring a 3/14/8/5&#8208;fused scaffold, an unusual eunicellane&#8208;type diterpenoid, sarcotorolide A (2), and two new biscembranoids, ximaolides M and N (7 and 8).







Abstract
Applying the emerging molecular networking strategy, an uncommon cembranoid orthoester, sarcotortin A (1), featuring a 3/14/8/5&#8208;fused scaffold, an unusual eunicellane&#8208;type diterpenoid, sarcotorolide A (2), and two new biscembranoids, ximaolides M and N (7 and 8), along with nine known terpenoids 3&#8211;6 and 9&#8211;13 were isolated from the Hainan soft coral Sarcophyton tortuosum. The structure and absolute configuration of all new compounds were established by a combination of spectroscopic data, X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis, and/or quantum chemical computational approaches. The plausible biogenetic relationship among these skeletally different terpenoids was proposed and discussed. In in vitro bioassay, new compound 7 exhibited a remarkable inhibitory activity against protein tyrosine phosphatases 1B (PTP1B) with the IC50 value of 8.06&#8197;&#956;M. In addition, compounds 4 and 10 displayed significant inhibitory effects on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)&#8208;induced inflammatory responses in RAW264.7 macrophages cells with the IC50 values of 19.13 and 16.45&#8197;&#956;M, respectively. Compound 9 showed interesting cytotoxicity against H1975, MDA&#8208;MB231, A549, and H1299 cancer cell lines with IC50 values of 31.59, 34.96, 43.87, and 27.93&#8197;&#956;M, respectively.

         <title>White Light&#8208;Emitting Electrochemical Cells Employing Phosphor&#8208;Sensitized Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence to Approach All&#8208;Phosphorescent Device Efficiencies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solid&#8208;state light&#8208;emitting electrochemical cells (LECs) show promising advantages of simple device architecture, low operation voltage, and insensitivity to the electrode work functions such that they have high potential in low&#8208;cost display and lighting applications. In this work, novel white LECs based on phosphor&#8208;sensitized thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) are proposed. The emissive layer of these white LECs is composed of a blue&#8208;green phosphorescent host doped with a deep&#8208;red TADF guest. Efficient singlet&#8208;to&#8208;triplet intersystem crossing (ISC) on the phosphorescent host and the subsequent F&#246;rster energy transfer from the host triplet excitons to guest singlet excitons can make use of both singlet and triplet excitons on the host. With the good spectral overlap between the host emission and the guest absorption, 0.075 wt.% guest doping is sufficient to cause substantial energy transfer efficiency (ca. 40%). In addition, such a low guest concentration also reduces the self&#8208;quenching effect and a high photoluminescence quantum yield of up to 84% ensures high device efficiency. The phosphor&#8208;sensitized TADF white LECs indeed show a high external quantum efficiency of 9.6%, which is comparable with all&#8208;phosphorescent white LECs. By employing diffusive substrates to extract the light trapped in the substrate, the device efficiency can be further improved by ca. 50%. In the meantime, the intrinsic EL spectrum and device lifetime of the white LECs recover since the microcavity effect is destroyed. This work successfully demonstrates that the phosphor&#8208;sensitized TADF white LECs are potential candidates for efficient white light&#8208;emitting devices.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The reactivity of carbonyl diisocyanate, CO(NCO)2, and carbonyl diisothiocyanate, CO(NCS)2 with nucleophiles shows different patterns: Whereas carbonyl diisocyanate adds two equivalents of nucleophile forming carbonyl bis(carbamoylhalides), carbonyl diisothiocyanate only adds one equivalent and undergoes intramolecular ring closure, resulting in the formation of substituted thiadiazines. In this study we have reacted both carbonyl diisocyanate and carbonyl diisothiocyanate with the full series of hydrogen halides HF to HI, isolating carbonyl bis(carbamoylfluoride) (1), &#8208;chloride (2), &#8208;bromide (3), and &#8208;iodide (4) as well as (6&#8208;chloro&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2&#8208;thioxo&#8208;4H&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;thiadiazin&#8208;4&#8208;one (5), and 6&#8208;bromo&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2&#8208;thioxo&#8208;4H&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;thiadiazin&#8208;4&#8208;one (6).

         <title>Fluorescence Detection of the Persistent Organic Pollutant Chlordecone in Water at Environmental Concentrations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chlordecone (CLD), a Persistent Organic Pollutant, is still present in water and food chain of the French West Indies (FWI), leading to dramatical public health problems. One of the major issues is the lack of an easy, non&#8208;expensive, sensitive and robust method for the detection of chlordecone to ensure chlordecone&#8208;free water and foods for the residents of the FWI. Here we report on the development of a fluorescent molecular cage that allows a simple and convenient detection of chlordecone in water at environmental concentration. The specific structural features of chlordecone prompted us to choose hemicryptophanes as receptor. First, we optimized the size, shape of the cavity, as well as the recognition units, to identify the most efficient non fluorescent host for CLD complexation. Then, this selected compound was equipped with fluorophores at different positions in order to find the most efficient system for CLD detection by fluorescence. Among the two most promising fluorescent cages, the newly synthesized hemicryptophane with biphenyl moieties allowed us to develop a fast, easy, reproducible and cheap procedure to detect CLD in water. Its sensitivity and scalability, with modulation of hemicryptophane concentration enabled us to estimate CLD concentrations over five orders of magnitude (10&#8208;2 &#8208; 103 &#181;g/L) including the environmental levels of contamination and the permissible limit for drinking water in the FWI.</dc:description>

         <title>The Boekelheide Rearrangement of Pyrimidine&#8208;N&#8208;oxides as a Case Study of Closed or Open Shell Reactions &#8211; Experimental and Computational Evidence for the Participation of Radical Intermediates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In a case study, the acetic anhydride&#8208;promoted reaction of a model pyrimidine&#8208;N&#8208;oxide to the corresponding 4&#8208;acetoxymethyl&#8208;substituted pyrimidine derivative (Boekelheide rearrangement) was investigated in detail by experiment and quantum chemical calculations. The reaction conditions were varied and several side products formed in low to moderate yields were identified. These experiments indicate that a (pyrimidin&#8208;4&#8208;yl)methyl radical is one of the key species of the rearrangement. This interpretation was supported by the fact that rearrangements performed in solvents which can easily lose hydrogen atoms, afford considerable quantities of products incorporating the solvent. With TEMPO the key radical could be trapped. Other carboxylic acid anhydrides confirm the conclusion that the Boekelheide rearrangement of the model pyrimidine&#8208;N&#8208;oxide proceeds, at least in part, via radical intermediates. The high level closed and open shell quantum chemical calculations show that concerted [3,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangements or stepwise processes, either via ion pairs or via radicals, are energetically feasible.</dc:description>

         <title>Thiophosphinoyl&#8208;Tethered Ylide&#8208;Substituted Heavier Carbenes: Synthesis, Structures and Stabilities</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis and structure analysis of a series of mono and diylide&#8208;substituted tetrylenes of type YEX and Y2E (E = Ge, Sn, Pb; X = Cl or Br) using a thiophosphinoyl&#8208;tethered metallated ylide (Y = Ph2P(S)&#8208;C&#8208;P(pip)Ph2 with pip = piperidyl) is reported, amongst the first ylide&#8208;substituted plumbylenes. The tetrylenes feature distinct trends in the spectroscopic and structural properties of the ylide ligand with increasing atomic number of the tetrel element. For instance, an increasingly high&#8208;field shifted signal for the phosphonium group is observed in the 31P&#8208;NMR spectrum as a consequence of the increasing polarity of the element&#8208;carbon bond, which likewise results in a shortening of the ylidic C&#8208;P bond in the solid&#8208;state structure. The diylidyltetrylenes are unstable towards transylidation forming the mono(ylide)tetrylenes when treated with the tetrel dihalides according to the stability trend: Y2Pb &lt; Y2Sn &lt; Y2Ge &lt; YPbBr &lt; YSnCl &lt; YGeCl. Starting from the monoylide&#8208;substituted chlorotertrylenes the first unsymmetrical diylidyltetrylenes of type YEY&#8217; can be accessed, whose solid&#8208;state structures revealed that not the C&#8208;E but the S&#8208;E bond to the thiophosphinoyl group is most affected by the second ylide substituent.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanistic Insights into Enhanced Hydrogen Evolution of CrOx/Rh Nanoparticles for Photocatalytic Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) of Rh nanoparticles (RhNP) coated with an ultrathin layer of Cr&#8208;oxides (CrOx) was investigated as a model electrode for the Cr2O3/Rh&#8208;metal core&#8208;shell&#8208;type cocatalyst system for photocatalytic water splitting. The CrOx layer was electrodeposited over RhNP on a transparent conductive fluorine&#8208;doped tin oxide (FTO) substrate. The CrOx layer on RhNP facilitates the electron transfer process at the CrOx/RhNP interface, leading to the increased current density for the HER. Impedance spectroscopic analysis revealed that the CrOx layer transferred protons via the hopping mechanism to the RhNP surface for HER. In addition, CrOx restricted electron transfer from the FTO to the electrolyte and/or RhNP and suppressed the backward reaction by limiting oxygen migration. This study clarifies the crucial role of the ultrathin CrOx layer on nanoparticulate cocatalysts and provides a cocatalyst design strategy for realizing efficient photocatalytic water splitting.</dc:description>

         <title>Conjugation Extension and Halochromic Behaviors of S&#8208;Fused Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons Bearing Cyclopenta[b]thiopyran Moieties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 9, February 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three S&#8208;fused polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons bearing cyclopenta[b]thiopyran moieties show intriguing halochromic properties in both solution and solid states. Upon alternative treatments by trifluoroacetic acid and triethylamine, the absorption and the fluorescence can be reversibly switched. It is revealed that the introduced proton is on the cyclopentadiene ring while the positive charge is localized on the thiopyrylium ring.







Abstract
Three S&#8208;fused polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) bearing cyclopenta[b]thiopyran moieties have been designed and successfully synthesized. With the conjugation extension, the absorption onset of the longest PAH reaches 1110&#8197;nm. All the three S&#8208;fused PAHs exhibit significant halochromic properties in both solution and solid states. Upon protonation, the proton is incorporated on the cyclopentadiene ring while the positive charge is localized on the thiopyrylium ring. Moreover, no significant difference can be found for the two shorter PAHs upon the protonation by different organic acids, such as trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and trifluoromethanesulfonic acid (TfOH), while the longest PAH can be only mono&#8208;protonated by TFA but di&#8208;protonated by stronger TfOH. Furthermore, after protonation, the non&#8208;emissive S&#8208;fused PAHs exhibit strong fluorescence and can be regenerated by simply neutralization with triethylamine. The enhanced emission of mono&#8208;protonated products stem from S2&#8594;S0 transitions, which disobey the Kasha's rule.

         <title>Direct Coupling of Methane and Carbon Dioxide on Tantalum Cluster Cations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 9, February 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
How the tantalum cluster cations catalyze: The cationic tantalum atom and the cationic tetramer exhibit a strong size&#8208;dependent reactivity with methane and carbon dioxide: The monomer yields products from C&#8722;C coupling reactions, while the tetramer enables the formation of formaldehyde or syngas.







Abstract
Understanding molecular&#8208;scale reaction mechanisms is crucial for the design of modern catalysts with industrial prospect. Through joint experimental and computational studies, we investigate the direct coupling reaction of CH4 and CO2, two abundant greenhouse gases, mediated by Ta1,4+ ions to form larger oxygenated hydrocarbons. Coherent with proposed elementary steps, we expose products of CH4 dehydrogenation [Ta1,4CH2]+ to CO2 in a ring electrode ion trap. Product analysis and reaction kinetics indicate a predisposition of the tetramers for C&#8722;O coupling with a conversion to products of CH2O, whereas atomic cations enable C&#8722;C coupling yielding CH2CO. Selected experimental findings are supported by thermodynamic computations, connecting structure, electronic properties, and catalyst function. Moreover, the study of bare Ta1,4+ compounds indicates that methane dehydrogenation is a significant initial step in the direct coupling reaction, enabling new, yet unknown reaction pathways.

Through joint experimental and computational studies, we investigate the direct coupling reaction of CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, two abundant greenhouse gases, mediated by Ta&lt;sub&gt;1,4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions to form larger oxygenated hydrocarbons. Coherent with proposed elementary steps, we expose products of CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; dehydrogenation [Ta&lt;sub&gt;1,4&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; to CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in a ring electrode ion trap. Product analysis and reaction kinetics indicate a predisposition of the tetramers for C&#8722;O coupling with a conversion to products of CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, whereas atomic cations enable C&#8722;C coupling yielding CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO. Selected experimental findings are supported by thermodynamic computations, connecting structure, electronic properties, and catalyst function. Moreover, the study of bare Ta&lt;sub&gt;1,4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; compounds indicates that methane dehydrogenation is a significant initial step in the direct coupling reaction, enabling new, yet unknown reaction pathways.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Structure Determination of the Crystalline LiPON Model Structure Li5+xP2O6&#8722;xN1+x with x&#8776;0.9</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 9, February 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Li5+xP2O6&#8722;xN1+x (x&#8776;0.9) is a crystalline compound suitable as model compound for the understanding of structural traits within amorphous LiPON materials. A plethora of analytical methods, including diffraction methods, NMR, vibration spectroscopy and elemental analyses, was employed for elucidation of structure and composition of this substance. Ionic conductivity was measured using impedance spectroscopy.







Abstract
Non&#8208;crystalline lithium oxonitridophosphate (LiPON) is used as solid electrolyte in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries. Crystalline lithium oxonitridophosphates are important model structures to retrieve analytical information that can be used to understand amorphous phases better. The new crystalline lithium oxonitridophosphate Li5+xP2O6&#8722;xN1+x was synthesized as an off&#8208;white powder by ampoule synthesis at 750&#8211;800&#8201;&#176;C under Ar atmosphere. It crystallizes in the monoclinic space group P21/c with a=15.13087(11)&#8197;&#197;, b=9.70682(9)&#8197;&#197;, c=8.88681(7)&#8197;&#197;, and &#946;=106.8653(8)&#176;. Two P(O,N)4 tetrahedra connected by an N atom form the structural motif [P2O6&#8722;xN1+x](5+x)&#8722;. The structure was elucidated from X&#8208;ray diffraction data and the model corroborated by NMR and infrared spectroscopy, and elemental analyses. Measurements of ionic conductivity show a total ionic conductivity of 6.8&#215;10&#8722;7&#8201;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 75&#8201;&#176;C with an activation energy of 0.52&#177;0.01&#8197;eV.

Finding out the angles: Flow chemistry using microreactors makes it possible to obtain 5&#8208;diethylboryl&#8208;2,3&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine, which cannot be synthesized in batch processes. The observation of equilibrium processes under 1&#8197;min is feasible by using flow NMR spectroscopy, which also reveals that a slight change in the angle of the constituent molecule affects the dynamic equilibrium in solution and crystal structure.







Abstract
5&#8208;Diethylboryl&#8208;2,3&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine (1), which is inaccessible by conventional batch methods, was synthesized by using a flow microreactor. Compound 1 was obtained as an equilibrium mixture of a cyclic trimer and a cyclic tetramer in solution, the latter of which was crystallized in benzene by vapor diffusion of hexane at 7&#8201;&#176;C. The dynamic nature of this system was confirmed by solvent&#8208; and concentration&#8208;dependent experiments. Notably, the dynamics was verified by using flow NMR spectroscopy, which revealed that the time required to reach equilibrium was influenced by the solvent ratio (&lt;18&#8197;s, 24&#8211;28&#8197;s, and 34&#8211;42&#8197;s in 2&#8201;:&#8201;1, 1&#8201;:&#8201;1, and 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 mixtures of [D6]acetone and C6D6, respectively). Compound 1 and 3&#8208;[4&#8242;&#8208;(diethylboryl)phenyl]pyridine (2) exhibited different self&#8208;assembly behavior in solution and crystals. Density functional theory calculations suggested that this difference was largely due to enhanced planarity between two consecutive aromatic rings.

         <title>Probing the Importance of Host Symmetry on Carbohydrate Recognition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 9, February 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple switch from formic acid to HFIP allows the formation of the C3 symmetrical hemicryptophane cage analogue of the previously reported C1 symmetrical one. The cage with low symmetry exhibits higher binding constants towards carbohydrates than the C3 analogue. The receptors showed remarkable high substrate selectivity and stereoselectivity towards &#945;&#8208;glucoside and &#946;&#8208;galactoside.







Abstract
The design of molecular cages with low symmetry could allow for more specific tuning of their properties and better mimic the unsymmetrical and complex environment of protein pockets. However, the added value of lowering symmetry of molecular receptors has been rarely demonstrated. Herein, C3&#8208; and C1&#8208;symmetrical cages, presenting the same recognition sites, have been synthesized and investigated as hosts for carbohydrate recognition. Structurally related derivatives of glucose, galactose and mannose were found to have greater affinity to the receptor with the lowest symmetry than to their C3&#8208;symmetrical analogue. According to the host cavity modelling, the C1 symmetry receptor exhibits a wider opening than its C3&#8208;symmetrical counterpart, providing easier access and thus promoting guest proximity to binding sites. Moreover, our results show the high stereo&#8208; and substrate selectivity of the C1 symmetry cage with respect to its C3 counterpart in the recognition of sugars.

         <title>A Simple Substitution on Thyroid Hormones Remarkably Alters the Regioselectivity of Deiodination by a Deiodinase Mimic</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 9, February 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The deiodination of L&#8208;thyroxine (T4) plays key roles in the thyroid hormone homeostasis. This chemical model study reveals that the modulation of the electronic properties of the iodine atoms in T4 through the phenolic group has a remarkable influence on the regioselectivity of the deiodination.







Abstract
The regioselective deiodinations of L&#8208;thyroxine (T4) play key roles in the thyroid hormone homeostasis. These reactions are catalyzed by three isoforms of the selenoenzymes, iodothyronine deiodinases (Dio1, Dio2 and Dio3), which are highly homologous in nature. Dio1 mediates 5&#8242;&#8208; or 5&#8208;deiodinations of T4 to produce T3 and rT3, respectively. In contrast, Dio2 and Dio3 are selective to 5&#8242;&#8208; or 5&#8208;deiodination to produce T3 and rT3, respectively. Understanding of the regioselectivity of deiodination at the molecular level is important as abnormal levels of thyroid hormone have been implicated in various clinical conditions, such as hypoxia, myocardial infarction, neuronal ischemia and cancer. In this paper, we report that the electronic properties of the iodine atoms in thyroxine (T4) can be modulated through a simple substitution in the 4&#8242;&#8208;phenolic moiety. This leads to the change in the regioselectivity of deiodination by different small molecule mimics of Dio enzymes. By using this chemical approach, we also show that the substitution of a strong electron withdrawing group facilitates the removal of all four iodine atoms in the T4 derivative. Theoretical investigations on the hydrogen bonded adducts of T4 with imidazole indicate that the charge on the iodine atoms depend on the nature of hydrogen bond between the &#8722;OH group of T4 and the imidazole moiety. While the imidazole can act as either hydrogen bond acceptor (HBA) or hydrogen bond donor (HBD), the protonated imidazole acts exclusively as HBD in T4&#8208;imidazole complex. These studies support the earlier observations that the histidine residue at the active sites of the deiodinases play an important role not only in the substrate binding, but also in altering the regioselectivity of the deiodination reactions.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The deiodination of L-thyroxine (T4)&lt;/b&gt; plays key roles in the thyroid hormone homeostasis. This chemical model study reveals that the modulation of the electronic properties of the iodine atoms in T4 through the phenolic group has a remarkable influence on the regioselectivity of the deiodination.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The regioselective deiodinations of L-thyroxine (T4) play key roles in the thyroid hormone homeostasis. These reactions are catalyzed by three isoforms of the selenoenzymes, iodothyronine deiodinases (Dio1, Dio2 and Dio3), which are highly homologous in nature. Dio1 mediates 5&#8242;- or 5-deiodinations of T4 to produce T3 and rT3, respectively. In contrast, Dio2 and Dio3 are selective to 5&#8242;- or 5-deiodination to produce T3 and rT3, respectively. Understanding of the regioselectivity of deiodination at the molecular level is important as abnormal levels of thyroid hormone have been implicated in various clinical conditions, such as hypoxia, myocardial infarction, neuronal ischemia and cancer. In this paper, we report that the electronic properties of the iodine atoms in thyroxine (T4) can be modulated through a simple substitution in the 4&#8242;-phenolic moiety. This leads to the change in the regioselectivity of deiodination by different small molecule mimics of Dio enzymes. By using this chemical approach, we also show that the substitution of a strong electron withdrawing group facilitates the removal of all four iodine atoms in the T4 derivative. Theoretical investigations on the hydrogen bonded adducts of T4 with imidazole indicate that the charge on the iodine atoms depend on the nature of hydrogen bond between the &#8722;OH group of T4 and the imidazole moiety. While the imidazole can act as either hydrogen bond acceptor (HBA) or hydrogen bond donor (HBD), the protonated imidazole acts exclusively as HBD in T4-imidazole complex. These studies support the earlier observations that the histidine residue at the active sites of the deiodinases play an important role not only in the substrate binding, but also in altering the regioselectivity of the deiodination reactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Interplay Between Hydrogen Bonding and Electron Transfer in Mixed Valence Assemblies of Triarylamine Trisamides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 9, February 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Not only hydrogen bonds but also a specific packing arrangement are necessary to get fast electron transfer in mixed valence assemblies of triarylamine trisamides. Defects in the hydrogen bonding network are detected upon increasing the number of radical species in the mixed valence assemblies present in the film state without impeding the delocalization of the unpaired electrons.







Abstract
Hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions are assumed to play a critical role in the long&#8208;range transport of light or charge recently observed in supramolecular assemblies of C3&#8208;symmetrical discotic molecules. Herein, the structure of mixed valence assemblies formed by irradiating triarylamine trisamide (TATA) molecules was determined by multifarious techniques under various conditions with the aim of probing the interplay between the hydrogen bonding network and the rate of electron transport in different states (solution, gel, film). Irradiation was performed under initial states that vary by the degree of association of TATA monomers through hydrogen bonds. Firstly, a significant shift of the N&#8722;H and C=O stretching frequencies was observed by FTIR upon irradiation thus revealing an overlooked signature of TATA&#8901;+ species and interacting mixed valence aggregates. Secondly, gels and films both mostly consist of hydrogen&#8208;bonded TATA polymers but their EPR spectra recorded at 293&#8197;K reveal very different behaviors: localized electrons in the gels versus fully delocalized electrons in the films. Hydrogen bonding thus appears as a necessary but not sufficient condition to get fast electron transfer rates and a packing of the TATA monomers particularly suitable for charge transport is assumed to exist in the solid state. Finally, defects in the hydrogen bonding network are detected upon increasing the number of radical species in the mixed valence assemblies present in the film state without impeding the delocalization of the unpaired electrons. A delicate balance between hydrogen bonds and packing is thus necessary to get supramolecular polarons in mixed valence TATA assemblies.

         <title>Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction with a Binuclear Bis&#8208;Terpyridine Pyrazole&#8208;Bridged Cobalt Complex
</title>

         <dc:description>
We present a binuclear cobalt complex stabilized by a new pyrazole&#8208;based ligand platform substituted with terpyridine groups. The dicobalt complex is electrocatalytically active towards carbon monoxide formation, from carbon dioxide in the presence of Bronsted acids. The terpyridine fragments participate during the electrocatalysis, reducing the overpotential of the reduction reaction.







Abstract
A pyrazole&#8208;based ligand substituted with terpyridine groups at the 3 and 5 positions has been synthesized to form the dinuclear cobalt complex 1, that electrocatalytically reduces carbon dioxide (CO2) to carbon monoxide (CO) in the presence of Br&#248;nsted acids in DMF. Chemical, electrochemical and UV&#8208;vis spectro&#8208;electrochemical studies under inert atmosphere indicate pairwise reduction processes of complex 1. Infrared spectro&#8208;electrochemical studies under CO2 and CO atmosphere are consistent with a reduced CO&#8208;containing dicobalt complex which results from the electroreduction of CO2. In the presence of trifluoroethanol (TFE), electrocatalytic studies revealed single&#8208;site mechanism with up to 94&#8201;% selectivity towards CO formation when 1.47&#8197;M TFE were present, at &#8722;1.35&#8197;V vs. Saturated Calomel Electrode in DMF (0.39&#8197;V overpotential). The low faradaic efficiencies obtained (&lt;50&#8201;%) are attributed to the generation of CO&#8208;containing species formed during the electrocatalytic process, which inhibit the reduction of CO2.

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalysed Carbene Transfer to Isocyanides as a Platform for Heterocycle Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 9, February 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The readily available low&#8208;valent iron complex [Fe(CO)3NO]&#8722; catalyzes the efficient transfer of carbenes to isocyanides. The resulting ketenimines undergo in&#8197;situ cyclocondensation with various bisnucleophiles to give a broad range of medicinally relevant heterocycles. A plausible mechanism for the carbene transfer is proposed based on DFT calculations.







Abstract
An iron&#8208;catalysed carbene transfer reaction of diazo compounds to isocyanides has been developed. The resulting ketenimines are trapped in&#8197;situ with various bisnucleophiles to access a range of densely functionalized heterocycles (pyrimidinones, dihydropyrazolones, 1H&#8208;tetrazoles) in a one&#8208;pot process. The electron&#8208;rich Hieber anion ([Fe(CO)3NO]&#8722;) facilitates efficient catalytic carbene transfer from acceptor&#8208;type &#945;&#8208;diazo carbonyl compounds to isocyanides, providing a cost&#8208;efficient and benign alternative to similar noble metal&#8208;catalysed processes. Based on DFT calculations a plausible reaction mechanism for activation of the &#945;&#8208;diazo carbonyl carbene precursor and ketenimine formation is provided.

         <title>Assembly of Helical Nanostructures: Solvent&#8208;Induced Morphology Transition and Its Effect on Cell Adhesion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 9, February 10, 2023. </description>

Just add water: Self&#8208;assembled intermediates were thoroughly modulated from an minimal model phenylalanine&#8208;based derivative (LPFM) featuring a C2 structure with single l&#8208;Phe conjugated on para&#8208;benzene. By altering the ratio of ethanol/H2O co&#8208;solvents, a dynamic morphological evolution of nanofibers from right&#8208; to left&#8208;handedness was successively revealed. The left&#8208;handed nanostructures were found to be favorable for cell adhesion and proliferation.







Abstract
Being able to precisely manipulate both the morphology and chiroptical signals of supramolecular assemblies will help to better understand the natural biological self&#8208;assembly mechanism. Two simple l/d&#8208;phenylalanine&#8208;based derivatives (L/DPFM) have been designed, and their solvent&#8208;dependent morphology evolutions are illustrated. It was found that, as the content of H2O in aqueous ethanol solutions was increased, LPFM self&#8208;assembles first into right&#8208;handed nanofibers, then flat fibrous structures, and finally inversed left&#8208;handed nanofibers. Assemblies in ethanol and H2O exhibit opposite conformations and circular dichroism (CD) signals even though they are constructed from the same molecules. Thus, the morphology&#8208;dependent cell adhesion and proliferation behaviors are further characterized. Left&#8208;handed nanofibers are found to be more favorable for cell adhesion than right&#8208;handed nanostructures. Quantitative AFM analysis showed that the L929&#8197;cell adhesion force on left&#8208;handed LPFM fibers is much higher than that on structures with inversed handedness. Moreover, the value of cell Young's modulus is lower for left&#8208;handed nanofibrous films, which indicates better flexibility. The difference in cell&#8208;substrate interactions might lead to different effects on cell behavior.

Assemblies in ethanol and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O exhibit opposite conformations and circular dichroism (CD) signals even though they are constructed from the same molecules. Thus, the morphology-dependent cell adhesion and proliferation behaviors are further characterized. Left-handed nanofibers are found to be more favorable for cell adhesion than right-handed nanostructures. Quantitative AFM analysis showed that the L929&#8197;cell adhesion force on left-handed LPFM fibers is much higher than that on structures with inversed handedness. Moreover, the value of cell Young's modulus is lower for left-handed nanofibrous films, which indicates better flexibility. The difference in cell-substrate interactions might lead to different effects on cell behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Di&#8208;Iron(II) [2+2] Helicates of Bis&#8208;(Dipyrazolylpyridine) Ligands: The Influence of the Ligand Linker Group on Spin State Properties</title>

This diiron(II) complex has been crystallized in three different helicate conformations, which differ in the torsions of the butane&#8208;1,4&#8208;diyl ligand linker groups. The crystals exhibit a range of spin state properties, including stepwise spin&#8208;crossover of the two iron atoms. A related ligand with a rigid pyrid&#8208;2,6&#8208;diyl spacer forms more a distorted, high&#8208;spin diiron(II) helicate structure.







Abstract
Four bis[2&#8208;{pyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl}&#8208;6&#8208;{pyrazol&#8208;3&#8208;yl}pyridine] ligands have been synthesized, with butane&#8208;1,4&#8208;diyl (L1), pyrid&#8208;2,6&#8208;diyl (L2), benzene&#8208;1,2&#8208;dimethylenyl (L3) and propane&#8208;1,3&#8208;diyl (L4) linkers between the tridentate metal&#8208;binding domains. L1 and L2 form [Fe2(&#956;&#8722;L)2]X4 (X&#8722;=BF4&#8722; or ClO4&#8722;) helicate complexes when treated with the appropriate iron(II) precursor. Solvate crystals of [Fe2(&#956;&#8722;L1)2][BF4]4 exhibit three different helicate conformations, which differ in the torsions of their butanediyl linker groups. The solvates exhibit gradual thermal spin&#8208;crossover, with examples of stepwise switching and partial spin&#8208;crossover to a low&#8208;temperature mixed&#8208;spin form. Salts of [Fe2(&#956;&#8722;L2)2]4+ are high&#8208;spin, which reflects their highly twisted iron coordination geometry. The composition and dynamics of assembly structures formed by iron(II) with L1&#8722;L3 vary with the ligand linker group, by mass spectrometry and 1H NMR spectroscopy. Gas&#8208;phase DFT calculations imply the butanediyl linker conformation in [Fe2(&#956;&#8722;L1)2]4+ influences its spin state properties, but show anomalies attributed to intramolecular electrostatic repulsion between the iron atoms.

         <title>Towards Luminescent Vanadium(II) Complexes with Slow Magnetic Relaxation and Quantum Coherence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 9, February 10, 2023. </description>

Towards qubits with optical read&#8208;out: Metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (4MLCT) states account for the color of the vanadium(II) complex isomers cis&#8208;fac&#8208; and mer&#8208;[V(ddpd)2]2+ in spite of the electron&#8208;rich pyridines. 2MLCT states mix with the lowest spin&#8208;flip states, contracting the V&#8722;N bonds in the excited state and preventing ruby&#8208;like spin&#8208;flip emission. Both isomers possess spin&#8208;lattice relaxation times of around 300&#8197;&#956;s and a phase memory time of around 1&#8197;&#956;s at 5&#8197;K.The mer isomer shows slow magnetic relaxation in an external magnetic field. These results pave the way for qubits with optical read&#8208;out based on vanadium(II) complexes.







Abstract
Molecular entities with doublet or triplet ground states find increasing interest as potential molecular quantum bits (qubits). Complexes with higher multiplicity might even function as qudits and serve to encode further quantum bits. Vanadium(II) ions in octahedral ligand fields with quartet ground states and small zero&#8208;field splittings qualify as qubits with optical read out thanks to potentially luminescent spin&#8208;flip states. We identified two V2+ complexes [V(ddpd)2]2+ with the strong field ligand N,N&#8217;&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;N,N&#8217;&#8208;dipyridine&#8208;2&#8208;yl&#8208;pyridine&#8208;2,6&#8208;diamine (ddpd) in two isomeric forms (cis&#8208;fac and mer) as suitable candidates. The energy gaps between the two lowest Kramers doublets amount to 0.2 and 0.5&#8197;cm&#8722;1 allowing pulsed EPR experiments at conventional Q&#8208;band frequencies (35&#8197;GHz). Both isomers possess spin&#8208;lattice relaxation times T1 of around 300&#8197;&#956;s and a phase memory time TM of around 1&#8197;&#956;s at 5&#8197;K. Furthermore, the mer isomer displays slow magnetic relaxation in an applied field of 400&#8197;mT. While the vanadium(III) complexes [V(ddpd)2]3+ are emissive in the near&#8208;IR&#8208;II region, the [V(ddpd)2]2+ complexes are non&#8208;luminescent due to metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer admixture to the spin&#8208;flip states.

Organic photoreactions &#8220;on water&#8221;, namely in aqueous suspension or emulsion, are significantly accelerated in this ecologically favorable medium.







Abstract
Two representative organic photoreactions, namely a bimolecular photocycloaddition and a monomolecular photorearrangement, are presented that are accelerated when the reaction is performed &#8220;on&#8208;water&#8221;, that is, at the water&#8208;substrate interface with no solvation of the reaction components. According to the established models of ground&#8208;state reactions &#8220;on&#8208;water&#8221;, the enhanced efficiency of the photoreactions is explained by hydrophobic effects (Patern&#243;&#8208;B&#252;chi reaction) or specific hydrogen bonding (di&#8208;&#960;&#8208;methane rearrangement) at the water&#8208;substrate interface that decrease the energy of the respective transition state. These results point to the potential of this approach to conduct photoreactions more efficiently in an ecologically favorable medium.

         <dc:description>
When exploring the role of chromophores in phycobilisome assembly, a novel dichromic allophycocyanin was obtained that greatly extends the spectral range for light&#8208;harvesting. A linker contained in the structure is successfully used for template&#8208;assisted assembly in&#8197;vitro. This approach would also allow for targeting, in artificial photosynthetic systems or fluorescence labeling.







Abstract
Phycobilisomes, the light&#8208;harvesting complexes of cyanobacteria and red algae, are a resource for photosynthetic, photonic and fluorescence labeling elements. They cover an exceptionally broad spectral range, but the complex superstructure and assembly have been an obstacle. By replacing in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 the biliverdin reductases, we studied the role of chromophores in the assembly of the phycobilisome core. Introduction of the green&#8208;absorbing phycoerythrobilin instead of the red&#8208;absorbing phycocyanobilin inhibited aggregation. A novel, trimeric allophycocyanin (Dic&#8208;APC) was obtained. In the small (110&#8197;kDa) unit, the two chromophores, phycoerythrobilin and phytochromobilin, cover a wide spectral range (550 to 660&#8197;nm). Due to efficient energy transfer, it provides an efficient artificial light&#8208;harvesting element. Dic&#8208;APC was generated in&#8197;vitro by using the contained core&#8208;linker, LC, for template&#8208;assisted purification and assembly. Labeling the linker provides a method for targeting Dic&#8208;APC.

         <title>Dispersibility of TiO2 Nanoparticles in Less Polar Solvents: Role of Ligand Tail Structures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 9, February 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The oleyl ligands are known as good dispersants for stabilizing nanoparticles in less&#8208;polar solvents; however, the structure&#8208;dispersibility relationships remain unclear. We synthesized five phosphonic acid ligands to investigate the relationship and reveal that not only regio&#8208; but also the stereochemistries of the C=C double bond in the ligand molecule, as well as the choice of solvent, are key factors to enhance dispersibility.







Abstract
Nanoparticles (NPs) are inherently prone to aggregation and loss of their size&#8208;derived properties, thus it is essential to enhance their dispersibility for applications. In less polar solvents, organic ligands containing oleyl groups are known as good dispersants due to their inefficient shell packing and inhibition of chain&#8211;chain crystallization as well as interdigitation between adjacent NPs. However, reagents with oleyl structures, such as oleic acid and oleylamine, can contain trans double bonds and saturated impurities, which might affect the chemical and/or physical properties of the NPs. Nevertheless, the effect of slight differences in surface ligand structure, including isomers, on the dispersibility of NPs has been little studied. We have synthesized five phosphonic acid ligands to investigate the structure&#8211;dispersibility relationship in detail. Dynamic light scattering and visible light transmittance revealed that not only regio&#8208; but also the stereochemistries of the C=C double bond in the ligand molecule, as well as the choice of solvent, are key factors in enhancing dispersibility.

         <title>Conformationally Restricted &#946;&#8208;Sheet Breaker Peptides Incorporating Cyclic &#945;&#8208;Methylisoserine Sulfamidates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 9, February 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of a cyclic sulfamidate moiety as a &#946;&#8208;sheet breaker element is proposed for the first time. The sulfamidate effectively locks the peptide secondary structure in a novel rigid turn both in the gas phase and solid state, which is also maintained in solution. Peptides bearing this motif show moderate amyloid&#8208;&#946; inhibition activity.







Abstract
Peptides containing variations of the &#946;&#8208;amyloid hydrophobic core and five&#8208;membered sulfamidates derived from &#946;&#8208;amino acid &#945;&#8208;methylisoserine have been synthesized and fully characterized in the gas phase, solid state and in aqueous solution by a combination of experimental and computational techniques. The cyclic sulfamidate group effectively locks the secondary structure at the N&#8208;terminus of such hybrid peptides imposing a conformational restriction and stabilizing non&#8208;extended structures. This conformational bias, which is maintained in the gas phase, solid state and aqueous solution, is shown to be resistant to structure templating through assays of in&#8197;vitro &#946;&#8208;amyloid aggregation, acting as &#946;&#8208;sheet breaker peptides with moderate activity.

Base&#8208;stabilized neutral oxoborane and thioxoborane supported by a bis(oxazolinyl)(phenyl)methanide ligand have been synthesized and structurally characterized. While previous synthetic attempts of oxoborane ligated by &#946;&#8208;diketiminate (NacNac) did not allow for its isolation in acid&#8208;free form, oxoborane supported by a bis(oxazolinyl)(phenyl)methanide ligand is isolable, due to the absence of imine &#593;&#8208;protons and steric protection of enamine carbon. The utility of bis(oxazolinyl)(phenyl)methanide ligand suggests further applications of the scaffold as a synthetically viable yet chemically inert substitute of the prototypical NacNac ligands.

         <title>Homogeneous Dearomative Hydrogenation with a Co/P4N2 Catalyst: A Nucleophilic Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 9, February 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Co(P4N2)H species that has been demonstrated to be a strong hydride donor could deliver a hydride ion to less electron&#8208;rich arenes and heteroarenes in a nucleophilic manner. Deuterium labeling experiments supported a Michael&#8208;type reaction pathway. Theoretical analyses have been conducted to investigate the hydricity of the CoH species and the electrophilicity of the arenes.







Abstract
Arene hydrogenation is the most straightforward method to prepare carbo&#8208; and heterocycles. However, the high resonance energy prevents aromatic substrates from hydrogenation. Herein the homogeneous, nucleophilic hydrogenation of less electron&#8208;rich arenes and heteroarenes is reported. The Co(P4N2)H species that has been demonstrated to be a strong hydride donor could deliver a hydride ion to the cyano (hetero)arene substrates. Deuterium labeling experiments supported a Michael&#8208;type reaction pathway. Theoretical analyses have been conducted to investigate the hydricity of the catalytically active CoH species and the electrophilicity of the arene substrates. An outlook for the synthesis of more challenging substituted benzenes was proposed based on the in&#8197;silico modification of the CoH species.

         <title>Unveiling the Collaborative Effect at the Cucurbit[8]uril&#8208;MoS2 Hybrid Interface for Electrochemical Melatonin Determination</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 9, February 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The adsorption geometry of cucurbit[8]uril on a 2D nanoplatform controls the recognition capabilities. It behaves like a traffic light: on a transition metal dichalcogenide, the reception portals of CB[8] are open and the guest molecule can fit in. On graphene (or carbonaceous termination) they are closed, which prevents complex formation.







Abstract
Host&#8208;guest interactions are of paramount importance in supramolecular chemistry and in a wide range of applications. Particularly well known is the ability of cucurbit[n]urils (CB[n]) to selectively host small molecules. We show that the charge transfer and complexation capabilities of CB[n] are retained on the surface of 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), allowing the development of efficient electrochemical sensing platforms. We unveil the mechanisms of host&#8208;guest recognition between the MoS2&#8208;CB[8] hybrid interface and melatonin (MLT), an important molecular regulator of vital constants in vertebrates. We find that CB[8] on MoS2 organizes the receptor portals perpendicularly to the surface, facilitating MLT complexation. This advantageous adsorption geometry is specific to TMDs and favours MLT electro&#8208;oxidation, as opposed to other 2D platforms like graphene, where one receptor portal is closed. This study rationalises the cooperative interaction in 2D hybrid systems to improve the efficiency and selectivity of electrochemical sensing platforms.

         <title>Organometallic Platinum(II) Photosensitisers that Demonstrate Ligand&#8208;Modulated Triplet&#8208;Triplet Annihilation Energy Upconversion Efficiencies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 9, February 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of substituted 2&#8208;phenylquinoxaline ligands have been explored to finely tune the electronic properties of cyclometalated platinum(II) complexes. The complexes were successfully applied as photosensitisers in triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation upconversion experiments, demonstrating tuneable upconversion quantum yields of up to 14&#8201;%.







Abstract
A series of 2&#8208;phenylquinoxaline ligands have been synthesised that introduce either CF3 or OCF3 electron&#8208;withdrawing groups at different positions of the phenyl ring. These ligands were investigated as cyclometalating reagents for platinum(II) to give neutral complexes of the form [Pt(C^N)(acac)] (in which C^N=cyclometalating ligand; acac=acetyl acetonate). X&#8208;ray crystallographic studies on three examples showed that the complexes adopt an approximate square planar geometry. All examples revealed strong Pt&#8722;Pt linear contacts of 3.2041(6), 3.2199(3) and 3.2586(2)&#8197;&#197;. The highly coloured complexes display efficient visible absorption at 400&#8211;500&#8197;nm (&#1013; &#8776;5000&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8197;cm&#8722;1) and orange red photoluminescent characteristics (&#955;em=603&#8211;620&#8197;nm; &#934;em &#8804;37&#8201;%), which were subtly tuned by the ligand. Triplet emitting character was confirmed by microsecond luminescence lifetimes and the photogeneration of singlet oxygen with quantum efficiencies up to 57&#8201;%. Each complex was investigated as a photosensitiser for triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation energy upconversion using 9,10&#8208;diphenylanthracene as the annihilator species: a range of good upconversion efficiencies (&#934;UC 5.9&#8211;14.1&#8201;%) were observed and shown to be strongly influenced by the ligand structure in each case.

         <title>Structural and Functional Insight into the Mechanism of the Fe&#8722;S Cluster&#8208;Dependent Dehydratase from Paralcaligenes ureilyticus</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 9, February 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fe&#8208;S cluster&#8208;dependent dehydratases (DHTs) from the ilvD/EDD superfamily play an central role in enzyme cascades for the biomanufacture of the platform chemical isobutanol. Here, functional data for the DHT from Paralcaligenes ureilyticus have provided unprecedented insight into the catalytic mechanism of these enzymes that may inform bioengineering approaches to optimise the cascade.







Abstract
Enzyme&#8208;catalyzed reaction cascades play an increasingly important role for the sustainable manufacture of diverse chemicals from renewable feedstocks. For instance, dehydratases from the ilvD/EDD superfamily have been embedded into a cascade to convert glucose via pyruvate to isobutanol, a platform chemical for the production of aviation fuels and other valuable materials. These dehydratases depend on the presence of both a Fe&#8722;S cluster and a divalent metal ion for their function. However, they also represent the rate&#8208;limiting step in the cascade. Here, catalytic parameters and the crystal structure of the dehydratase from Paralcaligenes ureilyticus (PuDHT, both in presence of Mg2+ and Mn2+) were investigated. Rate measurements demonstrate that the presence of stoichiometric concentrations Mn2+ promotes higher activity than Mg2+, but at high concentrations the former inhibits the activity of PuDHT. Molecular dynamics simulations identify the position of a second binding site for the divalent metal ion. Only binding of Mn2+ (not Mg2+) to this site affects the ligand environment of the catalytically essential divalent metal binding site, thus providing insight into an inhibitory mechanism of Mn2+ at higher concentrations. Furthermore, in silico docking identified residues that play a role in determining substrate binding and selectivity. The combined data inform engineering approaches to design an optimal dehydratase for the cascade.

         <title>Synthesis and Characterization of Hypervalent Pentacoordinate Carbon Compounds Bearing a 7&#8208;6&#8208;7&#8208;Ring Skeleton</title>

Electronic tuning of ground&#8208;state structures for tetra&#8208; and penta&#8208;coordinate carbon species has been achieved by changing electronic properties of the equatorial aryl groups on the central carbon, confirmed by a correlation between Hammett para&#8208;substituent constant and solid&#8208;state structures of a series of cationic species based on a 7&#8208;6&#8208;7 tricyclic framework.







Abstract
To stabilize SN2 transition state&#8208;like penta&#8208;coordinate carbon species, triaryl&#8208;substituted cationic carbon compounds bearing a moderately flexible 7&#8208;6&#8208;7&#8208;ring skeleton with sulfur donors were synthesized and characterized. Electronic effects of para substituents (R=Cl, F, H, CH3, SMe, OMe) of the two equatorial aryl groups bound to the cationic central carbon were investigated systematically along with a planar bidentate thioxanthene derivative. X&#8208;ray analysis on their solid&#8208;state structures showed that the parent (R=H), chloro&#8208;, fluoro&#8208; and methyl&#8208;derivatives were tetracoordinate carbon (sulfonium) structures, while the p&#8208;MeO and thioxanthenyl system were pentacoordinate carbocation structures. The Hammett substituent constants for the para substituents (&#963;p+) correlates well with the bonding in these compounds. The methylthio&#8208;derivative with intermediate Hammett substituent constants (p&#8208;MeS; &#963;p+=&#8722;0.60) showed a tetracooridnate solid&#8208;state structure, though solution UV&#8208;Vis properties suggested the presence of a penta&#8208;coordinate structure. These findings amount to the first unambiguous solution evidence of the hypervalent apical 3c&#8211;4e interactions in pentacoordinate carbon compounds.

         <title>Molecular Rotational Correlation Times and Nanoviscosity Determined by 111mCd Perturbed Angular Correlation (PAC) of &#947;&#8208;rays Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 9, February 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Brownian molecular tumbling rates in solution have been measured by using 111mCd perturbed angular correlation of &#947;&#8208;rays (PAC) spectroscopy and a de novo designed molecular probe (a trimeric coiled&#8208;coil protein). Most materials are relatively transparent to &#947;&#8208;rays, and PAC spectroscopy might find applications where conventional methods probing rotational correlation times, for example, NMR and fluorescence spectroscopy, cannot be applied&#8212;from the physics of liquids to in&#8208;vivo biochemistry.







Abstract
The nanoviscosity experienced by molecules in solution may be determined through measurement of the molecular rotational correlation time, &#964;c, for example, by fluorescence and NMR spectroscopy. With this work, we apply PAC spectroscopy to determine the rate of rotational diffusion, &#955;=1/&#964;c, of a de novo designed protein, TRIL12AL16C, in solutions with viscosities, &#958;, from 1.7 to 88&#8197;mPa&#8901;s. TRIL12AL16C was selected as molecular probe because it exhibits minimal effects due to intramolecular dynamics and static line broadening, allowing for exclusive elucidation of molecular rotational diffusion. Diffusion rates determined by PAC data agree well with literature data from fluorescence and NMR spectroscopy, and scales linearly with 1/&#958; in agreement with the Stokes&#8211;Einstein&#8211;Debye model. PAC experiments require only trace amounts (&#8764;1011) of probe nuclei and can be conducted over a broad range of sample temperatures and pressures. Moreover, most materials are relatively transparent to &#947;&#8208;rays. Thus, PAC spectroscopy could find applications under circumstances where conventional techniques cannot be applied, spanning from the physics of liquids to in&#8208;vivo biochemistry.

         <title>Photoinduced Dehydrogenative Borylation via Dihydrogen Bond Bridged Electron Donor and Acceptor Complexes
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 9, February 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the first time, amine&#8208; and phosphine&#8208;boranes are discovered as donors to integrate with pyridinium acceptors for generating photoactive electron&#8208;donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complexes bridged by a dihydrogen bond. Irradiating the EDA complex enables an intra&#8208;complex SET to give a boron&#8208;centered radical with no need of external photosensitizer and radical initiator for effective pyridine borylation.







Abstract
Air&#8208;stable amine&#8208; and phosphine&#8208;boranes are discovered as donors to integrate with pyridinium acceptor for generating photoactive electron&#8208;donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complexes. Experimental results and DFT calculations suggest a dihydrogen bond bridging the donor and acceptor. Irradiating the EDA complex enables an intra&#8208;complex single electron transfer to give a boron&#8208;centered radical for dehydrogenative borylation with no need of external photosensitizer and radical initiator. The deprotonation of Wheland&#8208;like radical intermediate rather than its generation is believed to determine the good ortho&#8208;selectivity based on DFT calculations. A variety of &#945;&#8208;borylated pyridine derivatives have been readily synthesized with good functional group tolerance.

         <dc:description>
The photocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CRR) is an effective strategy because it affords the conversion of CO2 into useful carbon feedstocks by using sunlight and water. The Review by Y. Negishi and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202203387) summarizes recent research and development trends in the improvement of cocatalysts, which have a significant impact on the catalytic activity and selectivity of photocatalytic CRR. This review could serve as a general guideline to accelerate the development of highly efficient CRR photocatalysts.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The photocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction reaction&lt;/b&gt; (CRR) is an effective strategy because it affords the conversion of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into useful carbon feedstocks by using sunlight and water. The Review by Y. Negishi and co-workers (DOI: &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/chem.202203387"&gt;10.1002/chem.202203387&lt;/a&gt;) summarizes recent research and development trends in the improvement of cocatalysts, which have a significant impact on the catalytic activity and selectivity of photocatalytic CRR. This review could serve as a general guideline to accelerate the development of highly efficient CRR photocatalysts.

         <title>Cover Feature: Dispersibility of TiO2 Nanoparticles in Less Polar Solvents: Role of Ligand Tail Structures (Chem. Eur. J. 9/2023)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 9, February 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cover feature shows a schematic impression of our study on the dispersibility of TiO2 nanoparticles in less polar solvents. For ligand tail structures, there is a huge gap between saturated stearyl groups (depicted as waxes) and unsaturated oleyl groups (depicted as olives), even though there is very little difference in their molecular structures. In this study, we have synthesized two different ligands to bridge shores that are close yet far apart. More information can be found in the Research Article by Y. Okada and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202203608).

An open&#8208;and&#8208;shut case: Cucurbit[8]uril adsorbs robustly on transition&#8208;metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) letting the cavity open for complex formation with melatonin and allowing efficient electrochemical sensing. This situation is reversed on graphene where the Cucurbit[8]uril's portals are closed, hindering the host&#8211;guest recognition. More information can be found in the Research Article by C.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 9, February 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The modular peptide probes with good selectivity and high affinity have attracted numerous attentions for the analysis and regulation of proteins with complex structure and complicated analytical environment. In this review, the design and optimization strategies of modular peptide probes and their research progress of their applications in the field of protein analysis are reviewed.







Abstract
The analysis and regulation of proteins are of great significance for the development of disease diagnosis and treatment. However, complicated analytical environment and complex protein structure severely limit the accuracy of their analysis results. Nowadays, ascribing to the editability and bioactivity of peptides, peptide&#8208;based probes could meet the requirements of good selectivity and high affinity to overcome the challenges. In this review, we summarize the advances in the use of modular peptide probes for proteins analysis. It focuses on how to design and optimize the structure of probes, as well as their performance. Then, the strategies and application to improve the analysis result of modular peptide probes are introduced. Finally, we also discuss current challenge and provide some ideas for the future direction for modular peptide probes, hoping to accelerate their clinical transformation.

Catalytic CRRiteria: This review summarizes recent research and development trends in the improvement of cocatalysts, which have a significant impact on the catalytic activity and selectivity of photocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CRR). It provides advanced knowledge on the improvement of cocatalysts for CRR, serving as a general guide to accelerate the development of highly efficient CRR photocatalysts.







Abstract
Suppressing the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is an essential measure toward addressing global warming. Specifically, the photocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CRR) is an effective strategy because it affords the conversion of CO2 into useful carbon feedstocks by using sunlight and water. However, the practical application of photocatalyst&#8208;promoting CRR (CRR photocatalysts) requires significant improvement of their conversion efficiency. Accordingly, extensive research is being conducted toward improving semiconductor photocatalysts, as well as cocatalysts that are loaded as active sites on the photocatalysts. In this review, we summarize recent research and development trends in the improvement of cocatalysts, which have a significant impact on the catalytic activity and selectivity of photocatalytic CRR. We expect that the advanced knowledge provided on the improvement of cocatalysts for CRR in this review will serve as a general guideline to accelerate the development of highly efficient CRR photocatalysts.

         <title>How Research Data Management Plans Can Help in Harmonizing Open Science and Approaches in the Digital Economy</title>

The integration of open science into a digital economy, while considering legal European regulations, is a balancing act. Here research data management plans play a key role and has the potential to combine the interests of researchers as data producers and the public as data users in publicly funded projects.







Abstract
Within this perspective article, we intend to summarise definitions and terms that are often used in the context of open science and data&#8208;driven R&amp;D and we discuss upcoming European regulations concerning data, data sharing and handling. With this background in hand, we take a closer look at the potential connections and permeable interfaces of open science and digital economy, in which data and resulting immaterial goods can become vital pieces as tradeable items. We believe that both science and the digital economy can profit from a seamless transition and foresee that the scientific outcomes of publicly funded research can be better exploited. To close the gap between open science and the digital economy, and to serve for a balancing of the interests of data producers, data consumers, and an economy around services and the public, we introduce the concept of generic research data management plans (RDMs), which have in part been developed through a community effort and which have been evaluated by academic and industry members of the NFDI4Cat consortium. We are of the opinion that in data&#8208;driven research, RDMs do need to become a vital element in publicly funded projects.

         <title>A pH&#8208;Activatable Prodrug and Metal Prodrug Conjugate of Gossypol: Synthesis, Emergent Photophysical, Nanoscopic, Computational, and in vitro Cellular Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The major hurdle to the success of many potent chemotherapeutic drugs is the lack of stability for their active form suited for a particular mode of action. Efforts are needed to stabilize such functionalities by employing new and novel strategies to overcome such challenges. In this study, tumor&#8208;environment&#8208;specific, pH&#8208;activatable prodrugs and metal&#8208;prodrug conjugates have been developed to ameliorate the side effects of chemotherapeutic drugs bearing reactive functionalities. As a proof of concept, a pre&#8208;clinically tested natural compound gossypol was modified to form a pH&#8208;responsive prodrug by incorporating imine linkage amenable to form confined molecular structures through coordination with a bio&#8208;relevant and non&#8208;toxic zinc metal ion. Detailed photophysical, computational, and nanoscopic studies revealed the unique zinc ion coordination behavior and its effect on molecular confinement. Computational studies demonstrated that an increasing degree of complexation, with Zn&#8208;N&#8208;Py coordination, gradually turns off fluorescence by reducing the band gap that allows nonradiative decay. In vitro prodrug activation and release of gossypol from gossyzid and gossyzid&#8208;Zn were assessed by ESI&#8208;MS and RP&#8208;HPLC studies. The gossyzid and gossyzid&#8208;Zn demonstrated pH&#8208;specific cytotoxicity validated by the number of in vitro cellular assays. Such a strategy can essentially be adapted to strengthen many chemotherapeutic drugs to enhance their efficacy and reduce related side effects.</dc:description>

 Bond&#8208;Forming Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new method for the efficient synthesis of diarylmethanes via a radical process involving thermolysis of bis(arylmethyl)tin dichlorides in the presence of arenes is reported. The intermediate arylmethyl radical can be trapped with TEMPO.







Abstract
The oxidative&#8208;addition reaction between an arylmethyl chloride (RCH2Cl; R=1&#8208;C10H7, 2,4,6&#8208;Me3C6H2, 4&#8208;MeC6H4, 3&#8208;MeC6H4, C6H5, 4&#8208;ClC6H4) and tin powder in boiling toluene produces bis(arylmethyl)tin dichlorides, [(RCH2)2SnCl2] in good yields. At 160&#8201;&#176;C in mesitylene bis(1&#8208;naphthylmethyl)tin dichloride undergoes Sn&#8722;C homolytic cleavage to generate two 1&#8208;naphthylmethyl radicals (1&#8208;C10H7CH2&#8901;) which were trapped by TEMPO (C9H8NO&#8901;). Subsequently, the radicals (RCH2&#8901;) produced in this manner were utilized for efficient substitution reactions with electron&#8208;rich arenes (R&#8242;H; R&#8242;=2,4,6&#8208;Me3C6H2, 1,2,4,5&#8208;Me4C6H, 1,2,3,4,5&#8208;Me5C6) to obtain a variety of unsymmetrical diarylmethanes (RR&#8242;CH2). The addition of one equivalent of iodine (I2) to the reaction mixture resulted in a significant increase in the yields of coupled products.

One main method for the access of organofluorine compounds is the trifluoromethylative functionalization of an olefin bond, which simultaneously introduces a functional group and a trifluoromethyl element into an olefin framework. This review provides a concise overview of this powerful and versatile method.







Abstract
Organofluorine chemistry has become an expanding area of research in organic chemistry and drug design. The synthesis of fluorine&#8208;containing molecules has received high significance in synthetic chemistry. Trifluoromethylative difunctionalizations of carbon&#8208;carbon multiple bonds with the simultaneous introduction of a CF3 group and another function have considerable relevance. Because of the high importance of carbon&#8208;carbon bond&#8208;forming reactions in organic synthesis, carbotrifluoromethylations are considered to be a field of synthetic chemistry of increasing importance. Our current goal in this review is to summarize recent developments of various trifluoromethylation reactions (excluding aryl&#8208; and alkynyl&#8208;trifluoromethylations) taking into consideration several main approaches, such as alkenyltrifluoromethylation, alkyltrifluoromethylation, carbonyltrifluoromethylation, and cyanotrifluoromethylation reactions.

Oligofuran. A series of coplanar polyaryl&#8208;functionalized &#945;&#8208;oligofurans, in which aryl groups are introduced precisely into each of the furan units, are rapidly and efficiently synthesized by de novo metal&#8208;free synthesis of &#945;&#8208;bi(arylfuran) monomers. The characterization of &#945;&#8208;oligo(arylfuran)s demonstrates that photoelectric properties of coplanar &#945;&#8208;oligo(arylfuran)s can be tuned through varying aryl groups with different electrical properties. These novel &#945;&#8208;oligo(arylfuran)s have good hole transport capacity and can function as hole&#8208;transporting layers in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes, which is indicative of significant breakthrough in the application of &#945;&#8208;oligofurans materials in OLEDs. And our findings offer an avenue for the ingenious use of &#945;&#8208;oligofurans as p&#8208;type organic semiconductors for OLEDs.







Abstract
Tuning the photophysical properties of &#960;&#8208;conjugated oligomers by functionalization of skeleton, to achieve an optically and electronically advantageous building block for organic semiconductor materials is a vital yet challenging task. In this work, a series of structurally well&#8208;defined polyaryl&#8208;functionalized &#945;&#8208;oligofurans, in which aryl groups are introduced precisely into each of the furan units, are rapidly and efficiently synthesized by de novo metal&#8208;free synthesis of &#945;&#8208;bi(arylfuran) monomers for the first time. This new synthetic strategy nicely circumvents the cumbersome substituent introduction process in the later stage by the preinstallation of the desired aryl groups in the starting material. The characterization of &#945;&#8208;oligo(arylfuran)s demonstrates that photoelectric properties of coplanar &#945;&#8208;oligo(arylfuran)s can be tuned through varying aryl groups with different electrical properties.

         <title>Enantioselective and Chemoselective Phosphine Oxide&#8208;catalyzed Aldol Reactions of N&#8208;Unprotected Cyclic Carboxyimides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The catalytic asymmetric aldol reaction of N&#8208;unprotected cyclic carboxyimides has been achieved. Silicon tetrachloride acts in&#8197;situ as a protecting and mediating reagent and is converted to a nucleophilic species for the aldol reaction. The use of a chiral phosphine oxide catalyst can achieve enantioselective aldol reactions (up to 91/9 dr and 97/3 er) of various N&#8208;unprotected cyclic carboxyimides, including succinimides, hydantoins and glitazones.







Abstract
Asymmetric catalytic transformations of N&#8208;unprotected cyclic carboxyimides such as succinimides, hydantoins, oxazolidinediones, and glitazones, is a powerful way of directly accessing variety of biologically valuable chiral compounds. Herein, a bis(trichlorosilyl) nucleophilic intermediate formed from cyclic carboxyimides was reacted with aldehydes via (S)&#8208;SEGPHOS dioxide (SEGPHOSO), proceeding the aldol reaction in highly enantioselective fashion through a cyclic transition state. Furthermore, N&#8208;unprotected carboxyimides were chemoselectively activated, even in the presence of N&#8208;alkylated carboxyimides, to undergo stereoselective and chemoselective aldol reactions via in&#8197;situ silicon tetrachloride activation. The functionalized cyclic carboxyimides is readily derived to the several synthetic units derivatization to various chiral building blocks without unnecessary protection/deprotection steps.

         <title>Insights into the Photodynamics of Fluorescence Emission and Singlet Oxygen Generation of Fluorogen Activating Protein&#8208;Malachite Green Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Malachite green will rapidly decay to ground state via internal conversion after excitation, since the free rotation significantly decreases the energy level of the excited state. However, after binding with the fluorogen activating protein, the interaction will greatly restrict the excited&#8208;state rotation and allow the fluorescence turn&#8208;on and 1O2 generation.







Abstract
The self&#8208;assembled fluorogen activating protein (FAP)&#8208;malachite green (MG) complex is a well&#8208;established protein&#8208;ligand system, which can realize binding&#8208;caused fluorescence turn&#8208;on of MG and singlet oxygen (1O2) generation by MG iodination. To clarify the mechanism of fluorescence activation and 1O2 generation, the photodynamics of different halogen&#8208;substituted MG derivatives and their corresponding FAP&#8208;MG complexes were studied by femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy and theoretical computations. The results show that the rotation of MG is restricted by FAP binding, which prevents a rapid internal conversion to allow a longer lifetime for the excited MG to undergo fluorescence emission and intersystem crossing. Moreover, these FAP&#8208;MG complexes exhibit notably varied fluorescence quantum yields (&#934;FL) and 1O2 yields. The study on the decay pathways indicates that such an anti&#8208;heavy atom effect predominately stems from the lifetimes of the excited&#8208;state species. The photodynamic mechanism study here will lead to more advanced FAP&#8208;MG systems with high spatiotemporal resolution.

         <title>Reversing the Bond Length Alternation Order in Conjugated Polyenes by Substituent Effects</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bond lengths are widely utilised as observable structure parameters to estimate the contributions of particular resonance structures. Herein, it is demonstrated that outstandingly strong electron&#8208;withdrawing groups can reverse the textbook bond&#8208;length alternation order in polyene systems. This is a pronounced aberration from the molecular structure predicted by the neutral Lewis resonance form.







Abstract
We have synthesised several push&#8208;pull substituted conjugated polyenes and determined their accurate C&#8722;C bond lengths and charge&#8208;density distributions by utilising quantum crystallographic techniques. In a series of alkene, dienes, and triene bearing two (trifluoromethyl)sulfonyl (triflyl) groups on the terminal carbon atom, unique reversal of the bond&#8208;length alternation (BLA) order has been observed. This is a pronounced aberration from the molecular structure predicted by the Lewis&#8208;structure&#8208;based neutral resonance structure. Such reversal of BLA order has not been observed in push&#8208;pull compounds bearing conventional electron&#8208;withdrawing groups such as carbonyl and cyano groups instead of triflyl groups. Bonding behaviour of both normal and reversed bond length alternating systems has been revealed by complementary bonding analysis using several bond descriptors based on the experimentally fitted wavefunctions.

         <title>Two Rings Around One Ball: Stability and Charge Localization of [1&#8201;:&#8201;1] and [2&#8201;:&#8201;1] Complex Ions of [10]CPP and C60/70[*]</title>

         <dc:description>
Stability and charge distribution of [1&#8201;:&#8201;1] and [2&#8201;:&#8201;1] complex ions of [10]cycloparaphenylene with C60 and C70 are studied in energy resolved gas&#8208;phase collision experiments. The novel [2&#8201;:&#8201;1] complexes are also found in solution. Thermodynamic insight is obtained by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) measurements. DFT analyses as well as molecular dynamics calculations support the experimental data.







Abstract
We investigate the gas&#8208;phase chemistry of noncovalent complexes of [10]cycloparaphenylene ([10]CPP) with C60 and C70 by means of atmospheric pressure photoionization and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. The literature&#8208;known [1&#8201;:&#8201;1] complexes, namely [10]CPP&#8835;C60 and [10]CPP&#8835;C70, are observed as radical cations and anions. Their stability and charge distribution are studied using energy&#8208;resolved collision&#8208;induced dissociation (ER&#8208;CID). These measurements reveal that complexes with a C70 core exhibit a greater stability and, on the other hand, that the radical cations are more stable than the respective radical anions. Regarding the charge distribution, in anionic complexes charges are exclusively located on C60 or C70, while the charges reside on [10]CPP in the case of cationic complexes. [2&#8201;:&#8201;1] complexes of the ([10]CPP2&#8835;C60/70)+&#8901;/&#8722;&#8901; type are observed for the first time as isolated solitary gas&#8208;phase species. Here, C60&#8208;based [2&#8201;:&#8201;1] complexes are less stable than the respective C70 analogues. By virtue of the high stability of cationic [1&#8201;:&#8201;1] complexes, [2&#8201;:&#8201;1] complexes show a strongly reduced stability of the radical cations. DFT analyses of the minimum geometries as well as molecular dynamics calculations support the experimental data. Furthermore, our novel gas&#8208;phase [2&#8201;:&#8201;1] complexes are also found in 1,2&#8208;dichlorobenzene. Insights into the thermodynamic parameters of the binding process as well as the species distribution are derived from isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) measurements.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Stability and charge distribution&lt;/b&gt; of [1&#8201;:&#8201;1] and [2&#8201;:&#8201;1] complex ions of [10]cycloparaphenylene with C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; and C&lt;sub&gt;70&lt;/sub&gt; are studied in energy resolved gas-phase collision experiments. The novel [2&#8201;:&#8201;1] complexes are also found in solution. Thermodynamic insight is obtained by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) measurements. DFT analyses as well as molecular dynamics calculations support the experimental data.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We investigate the gas-phase chemistry of noncovalent complexes of [10]cycloparaphenylene ([10]CPP) with C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; and C&lt;sub&gt;70&lt;/sub&gt; by means of atmospheric pressure photoionization and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. The literature-known [1&#8201;:&#8201;1] complexes, namely [10]CPP&#8835;C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; and [10]CPP&#8835;C&lt;sub&gt;70&lt;/sub&gt;, are observed as radical cations and anions. Their stability and charge distribution are studied using energy-resolved collision-induced dissociation (ER-CID). These measurements reveal that complexes with a C&lt;sub&gt;70&lt;/sub&gt; core exhibit a greater stability and, on the other hand, that the radical cations are more stable than the respective radical anions. Regarding the charge distribution, in anionic complexes charges are exclusively located on C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; or C&lt;sub&gt;70&lt;/sub&gt;, while the charges reside on [10]CPP in the case of cationic complexes. [2&#8201;:&#8201;1] complexes of the ([10]CPP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8835;C&lt;sub&gt;60/70&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;+&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt;&#8901;&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;/&lt;/b&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;&#8901; type are observed for the first time as isolated solitary gas-phase species. Here, C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;-based [2&#8201;:&#8201;1] complexes are less stable than the respective C&lt;sub&gt;70&lt;/sub&gt; analogues. By virtue of the high stability of cationic [1&#8201;:&#8201;1] complexes, [2&#8201;:&#8201;1] complexes show a strongly reduced stability of the radical cations. DFT analyses of the minimum geometries as well as molecular dynamics calculations support the experimental data. Furthermore, our novel gas-phase [2&#8201;:&#8201;1] complexes are also found in 1,2-dichlorobenzene. Insights into the thermodynamic parameters of the binding process as well as the species distribution are derived from isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) measurements.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bimetallic Nickel Complexes Supported by a Planar Macrocyclic Diphosphoranide Ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nickel promotes the formation of a highly unusual planar dinucleating macrocycle PONNOPONNO. Bimetallic dinickel complexes of PONNOPONNO contain direct metal&#8208;metal interactions and trans reactive sites. Control over the ligand architecture is obtained by tuning the substituents and reaction conditions to favour dinucleating macrocyclic, mononucleating macrocyclic or traditional pincer architectures.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;metal cooperativity is emerging as an important strategy in catalysis. This requires appropriate ligand scaffolds that can support two metals in close proximity. Here we report nickel&#8208;promoted formation of a dinucleating planar macrocyclic ligand that can support bimetallic dinickel(II) and dinickel(I) complexes. Reaction outcomes can be tuned by variation of the substituents and reaction conditions to favour dinucleating macrocyclic, mononucleating macrocyclic or conventional pincer architectures.

         <title>A Versatile Step&#8208;Growth Polymerization Route to Functional Polyesters from an Activated Diester Monomer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Step&#8208;by&#8208;step: A versatile and efficient step&#8208;growth polymerization route is described for the synthesis of well&#8208;defined functional polyesters with predictable molecular weight and low dispersity by organocatalyzed transesterification of activated pentafluorophenyl (PFP) ester of adipic acid with structurally diverse diols under mild reaction conditions.







Abstract
This work describes a versatile and efficient condensation polymerization route to aliphatic polyesters by organo&#8208;catalyzed (4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine) transesterification reactions between an activated pentafluorophenyl&#8208;diester of adipic acid and structurally different diols. By introducing &#8220;monofunctional impurity&#8221; or &#8220;stoichiometric imbalance,&#8221; this methodology can afford well&#8208;defined end&#8208;functionalized polyesters with predictable molecular weights and narrow dispersity under mild conditions without any necessity for the removal of the byproducts to accelerate the polymerization reaction, which remains a major challenge in conventional polyester synthesis with non&#8208;activated diesters. Wide substrate scope with structurally different monomers and the synthesis of block copolymers by chain extension following either ring&#8208;opening polymerization or controlled radical polymerization have been successfully demonstrated. Some of the polyesters synthesized by this newly introduced approach show high thermal stability, crystallinity, and enzymatic degradation in aqueous environments.

         <title>Solvato&#8208;Controlled Assembly and Structural Transformation of Emissive Poly&#8208;NHC&#8208;Based Organometallic Cages and Their Applications in Amino Acid Sensing and Fluorescence Imaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stimuli&#8208;induced structural transformation of supramolecular cages has drawn increasing attention because of their sensitive feature to external variations as model systems to simulate biological processes. However, combining structural transformation and useful functions has remained a difficult task. In this study, we report the solvato&#8208;controlled self&#8208;assembly of two unique topologies with different emission characteristics, a water&#8208;soluble Ag8L4 cage (A) and an Ag4L2 cage (B), produced from the same sulfonate&#8208;pendant tetraphenylethene (TPE) bridged tetrakis&#8208;(1,2,4&#8208;triazolium) ligand. Both cages showed interesting solvent&#8208;responsive reversible structural transformation, and the change of fluorescence signals can efficiently track the process. Additionally, water&#8208;soluble cage A exhibits unique properties in thermochromism, thiol amino acid sensing, and subcellular imaging in aqueous media.</dc:description>

         <title>Coinage Metal Bis(amidinate) Complexes as Building Blocks for Self&#8208;assembled One&#8208;Dimensional Coordination Polymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The pyridyl functionalized amidinate [{PyC&#8801;CC(NDipp)2}Li(thf)2]n was used to synthesize a series of bis&#8208;amidinate complexes [{PyC&#8801;CC(NDipp)2}2M2] (M = Cu, Ag, Au) with fully supported metallophilic interactions. These metalloligands were then used as building blocks for the synthesis of one&#8208;dimensional heterobimetallic coordination polymers using Zn(hfac)2 (hfac = hexaflouroacetylacetonate) for self&#8208;assembly. Interestingly, the three coordination polymers [{PyC&#8801;CC(NDipp)2}2M2][Zn(hfac)2] (M = Cu, Ag, Au), exhibit a zig zag shape in the solid state. To achieve linear coordination geometry other connectors such as M&#8217;(acac) (M&#8217; = Ni, Co) (acac = acetylacetonate) were investigated. The thus obtained compounds [{PyC&#8801;CC(NDipp)2}2Cu2][M&#8217;(acac)2] (M&#8217; = Ni, Co) are indeed linear heterobimetallic coordination polymers featuring a metalloligand backbone with fully supported metallophilic interactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Black Titania and Niobia within Ten Minutes &#8211; Mechanochemical Reduction of Metal Oxides with Alkali Metal Hydrides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Partially or fully reduced transition metal oxides show extraordinary electronic and catalytic properties but are usually prepared by high temperature reduction reactions. Here we report the systematic investigation of the fast mechanochemical reduction of rutile&#8208;type TiO2 and H&#8208;Nb2O5 to their partially reduced black counterparts applying NaH and LiH as reducing agents. Milling time and oxide to reducing agent ratio show a large influence on the final amount of reduced metal ions in the materials. For both oxides LiH shows a higher reducing potential than NaH. An intercalation of Li+ in the structure of the oxides was proven by PXRD and subsequent Rietveld refinements as well as 6Li solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy. The products showed a decreased band gap and the presence of unpaired electrons as observed by EPR spectroscopy, proving the successful reduction of Ti4+ and Nb5+. Furthermore, the developed material exhibits a significantly enhanced photocatalytic performance towards the degradation of methylene blue compared to the pristine oxides. The presented method is a general, time efficient and simple method to obtain reduced transition metal oxides.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>TBAI&#8208;catalysed [4 + 4]&#8208;cyclization reaction of anthranils with hydrazones to deliver oxa&#8208;bridged eight&#8208;membered heterocycles in accepted yields was developed. Preliminary mechanistic studies indicated that the reaction involved the in&#8208;situ generation of vinyldiazenes from readily available hydrazones followed by an aza&#8208;Michael addition of the anthranil substrates onto the vinyldiazenes and subsequent annulation. This transformation involved the formation of two new C&#8208;N bonds and C&#8208;O bond in one pot, overcoming the synthetic limitations of anthranils in organic chemistry. This strategy benefits from high efficiency and atomic economy with mild reaction conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>The Full Cytosine&#8208;Cytosine Base Paring: Self&#8208;assembly and Crystal Structure</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of self&#8208;assembly systems that can mimic partial biological behaviours require ingenious and delicate design. For decades, scientists are committed to exploring new base pairing patterns using hydrogen bonds directed assembly of nucleotides. A fundamental question is the adaptive circumstance of the recognition between base pairs, namely, how solvent conditions affect the domain of base pairs. Towards this question, three nucleotide complexes based on 2&#8217;&#8208;deoxycytidine&#8208;5&#8217;&#8208;monophosphate (dCMP) and cytidine&#8208;5&#8217;&#8208;monophosphate (CMP) were synthesized in different solvents and pH values, and an unusual cytosine&#8208;cytosine base paring (named full C : C base pairing) were successfully obtained. Systematic single crystal analysis and 1H&#8208;NMR titration spectra have been performed to explore factors influencing the formation of base paring patterns. Moreover, supramolecular chirality of three complexes were studied using circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy in solution and solid&#8208;state combined with crystal structure analysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Computational Evidence of the Incipient Oxocarbenium Ion as a &#8220;Hidden Intermediate&#8221; During the Cyclization of Hydroxyenol Ether into Spiroketal Under Mild Acidic Condition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of spiroketals have gained attention because of their importance in chemical and biological reactions. Yet, the mechanistic investigation of mild acid&#8208;catalyzed spiroketalization remains elusive and less explored in the literature and speculated that such transformations may proceed through the oxocarbenium ion intermediate; however, the existence of such species in spiroketalization are not documented. The computational study has been performed at M062X/6 &#8211; 31 + G(d) level to examine the kinetically controlled product formation for such reactions and the intrinsic reaction coordinates of 1d suggests that the reaction proceeds via a one&#8208;step, two&#8208;stage&#160;mechanism with the formation of transient oxocarbenium as a hidden intermediate&#160;in the reaction. This study reveals the stereoelectronic interactions devoid the formation of stable oxocarbenium ion intermediate after the proton transfer transition state in the case of mid acid catalyzed spiroketalization process.</dc:description>

         <title>Site&#8208;Selective Unnatural Amino Acid Incorporation at Single or Multiple Positions to Control Sugar&#8208;Protein Connectivity in Glycoconjugate Vaccine Candidates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Antigen&#8208;carrier connectivity, if controlled, can help improving immunological response to glycoconjugate vaccines. In this work, it is shown that a site&#8208;selectively triple conjugated vaccine candidate against Streptococcus pneumoniae presents a better antigenicity than its randomly conjugated counterpart.







Abstract
In cellulo site&#8208;specific unnatural amino acid incorporation based on amber stop codon reassignment is a powerful tool to modify proteins at defined positions. This technique is herein applied to the selective functionalization of the Pneumococcal surface adhesin A protein at three distinct positions. N&#1013;&#8208;propargyloxycarbonyl&#8208;l&#8208;lysine residues were incorporated and their alkyne groups reacted using click&#8208;chemistry with a synthetic azido&#8208;functionalized tetrasaccharide representative of one repeat unit of the Streptococcus pneumoniae serotype 14 capsular polysaccharide. Anti&#8208;PsaA antibody response induced in mice by the trivalent glycoconjugate was determined in comparison with corresponding monovalent and randomly functionalized conjugates. Our results suggest that controlled was superior to random conjugation for preserving antigenicity. In definitive, the reported strategy offers a unique opportunity to study the impact of carbohydrate antigen&#8208;carrier protein connectivity on immunogenicity.

         <title>Green and Fast Strategies for Energy&#8208;Efficient Preparation of the Covalent Organic Framework TpPa&#8208;1</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Optimized synthesis for sustainable TpPa&#8208;1. Three strategies for organic solvent&#8208;free syntheses of covalent organic framework TpPa&#8208;1 have been developed. Improved textural properties and yields were achieved through a modified two&#8208;step mechanochemical synthesis. The water&#8208;based solvothermal synthesis with reaction times reduced more than 100&#8208;fold by microwave assistance makes it a more energy&#8208;efficient and less expensive process.







Abstract
Three synthesis procedures for the covalent&#8208;organic framework (COF) TpPa&#8208;1 are studied with the purpose of setting up the most promising one in a fast and green way, leading to a more environmentally friendly and sustainable process. With conventional heating, good crystallinity and a high BET specific surface area (SSA) of up to 1007&#8197;m2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1 are achieved at 170&#8201;&#176;C for 3&#8197;days using water as the quintessential green solvent. However, the application of microwave radiation in the synthesis for this crystalline porous polymer allows reaction times to be shortened to 30&#8197;min while maintaining structural and textural properties (BET SSA of 928&#8197;m2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1) and obtaining yields close to 98&#8201;% (vs. 90&#8201;% in the hydrothermal synthesis). The water&#8208;assisted mechanochemical synthesis is also an environmentally friendly synthetic approach; with heating at 170&#8201;&#176;C in a two&#8208;step process (10+10&#8197;min), high crystallinity is achieved, a BET SSA of 960&#8197; m2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1 and a yield of 98&#8201;% for TpPa&#8208;1.

         <title>Supramolecular Aggregation Control in Polyoxometalates Covalently Functionalized with Oligoaromatic Groups</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of Dawson type molecular metal oxides covalently functionalized with oligoaromatic groups is reported using a facile CLICK chemistry approach. The supramolecular chemistry of these organic&#8208;inorganic hybrids as well as their interactions with model photosensitizers are studied as basis for photoinduced electron transfer and storage systems.







Abstract
CLICK&#8208;chemistry has become a universal route to covalently link organic molecules functionalized with azides and alkynes, respectively. Here, we report how CLICK&#8208;chemistry can be used to attach oligoaromatic organic moieties to Dawson&#8208;type polyoxometalates. In step one, the lacunary Dawson anion [&#945;2&#8208;P2W17O61]6&#8722; is functionalized with phosphonate anchors featuring peripheral azide groups. In step two, this organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid undergoes microwave&#8208;assisted CLICK coupling. We demonstrate the versatility of this route to access a series of Dawson anions covalently functionalized with oligoaromatic groups. The supramolecular chemistry and aggregation of these systems in solution is explored, and we report distinct changes in charge&#8208;transfer behavior depending on the size of the oligoaromatic &#960;&#8208;system.

         <title>The Role of the Redox Non&#8208;Innocent Hydroxyl Ligand in the Activation of O2 Performed by [Ni(H)(OH)]+</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanism of dioxygen activation by [Ni(H)(OH)]+ was studied by a state&#8208;of&#8208;art multiconfigurational calculations. The role of redox&#8208;non&#8208;innocent hydroxyl in [Ni(H)(OH)]+ was elucidated, that is an energy reservoir instead of being the reaction center as what most of bioinorganic complexes show.







Abstract
The cationic complex [Ni(H)(OH)]+ was previously found to activate dioxygen and methane in gas phase under single collision conditions. These remarkable reactivities were thought to originate from a non&#8208;classical electronic structure, where the Ni&#8208;center adopts a Ni(II), instead of the classically expected Ni(III) oxidation state by formally accepting an electron from the hydroxo ligand, which formally becomes a hydroxyl radical in the process. Such radicaloid oxygen moieties are envisioned to easily react with otherwise inert substrates, mimicking familiar reactivities of free radicals. In this study, the reductive activation of dioxygen by [Ni(H)(OH)]+ to afford the hydroperoxo species was investigated using coupled cluster, multireference ab initio and density functional theory calculations. Orbital and wave function analyses indicate that O2 binding tranforms the aforementioned non&#8208;classical electronic structure to a classical Ni(III)&#8208;hydroxyl system, before O2 reduction takes place. Remarkably, we found no evidence for a direct involvement of the radicaloid hydroxyl in the reaction with O2, as is often assumed. The function of the redox non&#8208;innocent character of the activator complex is to protect the reactive electronic structure until the complex engages O2, upon which a dramatic electronic reorganization releases internal energy and drives the chemical reaction to completion.

         <title>Biohybrid Microswimmers for Antibiotic Drug Delivery Based on a Thiol&#8208;Sensitive Release Platform</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study reports on the design and engineering of biohybrid microswimmers exploiting a thiol&#8208;mediated self&#8208;immolative antibiotic release strategy. The design features a covalent attachment of a vancomycin conjugate via a disulfide&#8208;based linker to the surface of the microalgae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. The antibiotic release from the surface of these biohybrids was triggered by the addition of a thiol&#8208;based reducing agent, and, subsequently, the inhibition of bacterial growth was observed for Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus. These engineered microbots represent the first example of a microalgae&#8208;based drug delivery system with a thiol&#8208;mediated, reductive release of an antibiotic drug.</dc:description>

         <title>Construction of Y&#8208;Doped BiVO4 Photocatalysts for Efficient Two&#8208;Electron O2 Reduction to H2O2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production on BiVO4 photocatalysts using water and oxygen as raw materials is a green and sustainable process. However, the photocatalytic efficiency of pristine BiVO4 is limited by severe charge recombination. In this work, the rare earth element Yttrium (Y) doped BiVO4 photocatalysts are fabricated via the hydrothermal method. In the photocatalytic H2O2 production experiment, the optimized Y&#8208;doped BiVO4 photocatalyst produces 114 &#181;mol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 of H2O2 under simulated sunlight (AM1.5) irradiation, which is four times that of pure BiVO4 (26 &#181;mol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1). Density functional theory (DFT) calculation reveals that Y doping can enhance oxygen adsorption on the BiVO4 photocatalyst surface. Mechanistic investigations suggest that the doping process induces the in situ formation of monoclinic/tetragonal BiVO4 heterojunction, which further promotes the photogenerated carriers separation efficiency.</dc:description>

         <title>Neutral Monodentate and Hypervalent Chalcogen Bond Catalysis on the Intramolecular Rauhut&#8208;Currier Reaction of Bis(enones): A DFT Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently, the green and high efficient of chalcogen bond (ChB) catalysis has been aroused great interest. In this work, the ChB catalysis has been applied to the intramolecular Rauhut&#8208;Currier (RC) reaction of bis(enones). The mechanism was divided into four processes: the promoter addition process, the carbon&#8208;carbon bond coupling process, the hydrogen transfer process, and the promoter elimination process. This study shows that the ChB catalyst could act on the promoter and reactant in the RC reaction, respectively. And the path2 of ChB catalyst direct acting on the reactant is considered to be a relatively favorable channel of the reaction due to a lower energy barrier. In addition, all six catalysts could achieve good catalytic effect. Analysis of the properties shows that the formation of chalcogen bond mainly promotes the charge transfer of LP(O) &#8208; BD*(C&#8208;Se) in the carbon&#8208;carbon bond formation (key step), so that the charge of C(4) atom become more positive, thereby accelerating the reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;pot Synthesis of Phosphorus&#8208;modified ZSM&#8208;5 Zeolite by Solid&#8208;state Method and its MTO Catalytic Performance</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A green and efficient strategy for synthesizing phosphorus modified ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite is proposed by grinding phosphorus source, silicon source and aluminum source with the solvent&#8208;free conditions. Phosphorus&#8208;modified ZSM&#8208;5 zeolites exhibited higher light olefin selectivity and longer catalytic lifetime (33&#8197;h) in methanol to olefin reaction when the weight hourly space velocity was 4&#8197;h&#8722;1.







Abstract
The traditional hydrothermal synthesis strategy of ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite is energy&#8208;consumption accompanying by pollution issues. Herein, phosphorus&#8208;modified layered ZSM&#8208;5 zeolites (PZ) were obtained by one&#8208;pot synthesis under solvent&#8208;free conditions. The synthesized samples were fully characterized by XRD, SEM, BET, NH3&#8208;TPD and FTIR. The effect of phosphorus addition on the morphology and catalytic activity of ZSM&#8208;5 was investigated. The results showed that phosphorus&#8208;modified ZSM&#8208;5 zeolites exhibited higher light olefin (ethylene and propylene) selectivity (above 50&#8201;%) and longer catalytic lifetime (33&#8197;h) in methanol to olefin (MTO) reaction when the weight hourly space velocity was 4&#8197;h&#8722;1. Phosphorus&#8208;modified ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite synthesized by in&#8197;situ solvent&#8208;free method, which not only reduced the discharge of sewage but also showed a simple method to realize the introduction of phosphorous species, which provided a new idea for phosphorus modification of ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite.

         <title>Enhanced Solvent and Thermal Stability in Cross&#8208;Linkable Conjugated Statistical Copolymers for Organic Field&#8208;Effect Transistors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A set of P3HT&#8208;stat&#8208;P3HHT statistical copolymers containing hydroxyl groups attached to the P3HHT components was synthesized by KCTP polymerization. They occur cross&#8208;linked and retain edge&#8208;on manner at 150&#8201;&#176;C, while losing the ordered packing at 300&#8201;&#176;C. The cross&#8208;linked P3HT&#8208;stat&#8208;P3HHT exhibit good solvent resistance property and improved thermal stability in organic field&#8208;effect transistors.







Abstract
The ability to enhance both the solvent and thermal stability of semiconducting &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymers is highly desired for various device&#8208;related applications. Herein, a series of poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene)&#8208;stat&#8208;poly[3&#8208;(6&#8208;hydroxy)hexylthiophene] (P3HT&#8208;stat&#8208;P3HHT) statistical copolymers with thermally cross&#8208;linkable hydroxyl groups is synthesized and their crystalline structures in three different states, solvent and thermal stability for use in organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs) are elucidated. Importantly, these initial P3HT&#8208;stat&#8208;P3HHT thin films in their as&#8208;cast state crystallize well in an edge&#8208;on orientation. During annealing at 150&#8201;&#176;C, these P3HT&#8208;stat&#8208;P3HHT occur cross&#8208;linked and retain edge&#8208;on orientation with increased crystallinity and ordering. In contrast, after high&#8208;temperature annealing at 300&#8201;&#176;C, their edge&#8208;on orientation is significantly destroyed due to the cross&#8208;linking of hydroxyl groups at melted state. The correlation between different P3HT&#8208;stat&#8208;P3HHT and their charge mobilities is scrutinized. These cross&#8208;linked P3HT&#8208;stat&#8208;P3HHT exhibit good solvent resistance property and improved thermal stability in OFETs. Conceptually, such side&#8208;chain functionalization approach to improve the stability of P3HT&#8208;stat&#8208;P3HHT can be conveniently extended to other conjugated polymers for diverse optoelectronic applications.

         <dc:description>
A four&#8208;step approach to a presilphiperfolanol: Allylation of (&#8722;)&#8208;pulegone followed by an alkylation renders a trisubstituted cyclohexanone, which leads to a bridged bicyclo[4.3.1]undecen&#8208;one by a ring&#8208;closing metathesis. The embedded alkene&#8208;ketone functionalization is key for the metal&#8208;hydride atom transfer (MHAT) intramolecular &#8220;alkene first&#8221; radical process leading to the epimer at C&#8208;4 of presilphiperfolan&#8208;8&#945;&#8208;ol.







Abstract
From an (R)&#8208;(+)&#8208;pulegone&#8208;derived building block that incorporates the stereo&#8208;defined tertiary carbon bearing a methyl group, as found in the targeted sesquiterpenoid, a four&#8208;step synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;4&#8208;epi&#8208;presilphiperfolan&#8208;8&#8208;&#945;&#8208;ol was achieved. The key processes involved are a ring&#8208;closing metathesis leading to a bridged alkene&#8208;tethered ketone and its subsequent FeIII&#8208;mediated metal&#8208;hydride atom transfer (MHAT) transannular cyclization. This synthetic method, implying an irreversible addition of a carbon&#8208;centered radical upon a ketone by means of a hydrogen atom transfer upon the alkoxy radical intermediate, was also applied in the synthesis of trans&#8208;fused hydrindanols structurally related to botrydial compounds.

         <title>Biomineralized Piezoelectrically Active Scaffolds for Inducing Osteogenic Differentiation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bone tissue engineering scaffold was developed. The scaffold was realized by coupling porous poly (vinylidene fluoride&#8208;co&#8208;hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF&#8208;HFP) coating and calcium phosphate (CaP) coating. Piezoelectric effects can be produced by low&#8208;intensity ultrasound, the self&#8208;motion of the animal body. Through the coupling of piezoelectric effect and physicochemical properties, the scaffold has good osteoinductive ability.







Abstract
There is an endogenous electric field in living organisms, which plays a vital role in the development and regeneration of bone tissue. Therefore, self&#8208;powered piezoelectric material for bone repair has become hot research in recent years. However, the current piezoelectric materials for tissue regeneration still have the shortcomings of lack of biological activity and three&#8208;dimensional structure. Here, we proposed a three&#8208;dimensional polyurethane foam (PUF) scaffold coated with piezoelectric poly (vinylidene fluoride&#8208;co&#8208;hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF&#8208;HFP) and modified by a calcium phosphate (CaP) mineralized coating. The preferred scaffold has an open circuit voltage and short circuit current output of 5&#8197;V and 200&#8197;nA. Combining the physical and chemical properties of the CaP coating, the piezoelectric signal of PVDF&#8208;HFP and the three&#8208;dimensional structure of PUF, the scaffold exhibits superior promotion of cell osteogenic differentiation and ectopic bone formation in&#8197;vivo. The mechanism is attributed to an increase in intracellular Ca2+ levels in response to chemical and piezoelectric stimulation with the material. This research not only paves the way for the application of piezoelectric scaffolds to stimulate osteoblasts differentiation in&#8197;situ, but also lays the foundation for the clinical treatment of long&#8208;term osteoporosis.

         <title>Exploiting Coordination Behavior of 7&#8208;Azaindole for Mechanistic Investigation of Chan&#8208;Lam Coupling and Application to 7&#8208;Azaindole Based Pharmacophores</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a new copper(II)&#8208;DBU catalytic system, Chan&#8208;Lam type N&#8208;arylation of 7&#8208;azaindole is discussed. A new mechanism confirming the involvement of Cu(II)/Cu(III)/Cu(I) species for the cross&#8208;coupling pathway is proposed by identifying and characterizing key reaction intermediates through detailed spectroscopic, crystallographic investigations, DFT and TD&#8208;DFT calculations. A 7&#8208;azaindole&#8208;based SHP2 inhibitor, important in the medical field, is synthesized via sequential arylation.







Abstract
Multiple spectroscopic techniques, along with single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis, have been used to reveal the detailed structural and electronic information on reaction intermediates of a new copper(II)&#8208;DBU catalytic system for the N&#8208;arylation of 7&#8208;Azaindole. The reaction mixture of Chan&#8208;Lam cross&#8208;coupling yields two dimeric copper(II)&#8208;7&#8208;azaindole complexes, including one attached with DBU, prior to adding arylboronic acid and are confirmed structurally and spectroscopically. A suitable mechanism has been proposed using the dimeric copper(II) complex as a catalyst for the coupling reactions.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Using a new copper(II)-DBU catalytic system&lt;/b&gt;, Chan-Lam type N-arylation of 7-azaindole is discussed. A new mechanism confirming the involvement of Cu(II)/Cu(III)/Cu(I) species for the cross-coupling pathway is proposed by identifying and characterizing key reaction intermediates through detailed spectroscopic, crystallographic investigations, DFT and TD-DFT calculations. A 7-azaindole-based SHP2 inhibitor, important in the medical field, is synthesized via sequential arylation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multiple spectroscopic techniques, along with single-crystal X-ray analysis, have been used to reveal the detailed structural and electronic information on reaction intermediates of a new copper(II)-DBU catalytic system for the N-arylation of 7-Azaindole. The reaction mixture of Chan-Lam cross-coupling yields two dimeric copper(II)-7-azaindole complexes, including one attached with DBU, prior to adding arylboronic acid and are confirmed structurally and spectroscopically. A suitable mechanism has been proposed using the dimeric copper(II) complex as a catalyst for the coupling reactions. The role of DBU as a base and also as an auxiliary ligand in the course of the reaction has been established. The transmetalated monomeric aryl-copper(II) species generated from the dimeric unit is oxidized by another equivalent of copper(II) to yield an aryl-copper(III) intermediate for facile N-arylation, which has been authenticated with UV-vis spectroscopy. The regeneration of the copper(II)-catalyst by aerial oxidation of colorless copper(I) species (generated via reductive elimination &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; disproportionation step) is confirmed by mass and absorption spectroscopy. Detailed DFT and TD-DFT calculations help to rationalize the proposed reaction intermediates and their corresponding electronic transitions. Moreover, the confirmation of copper(I)-7-azaindole intermediate via HRMS reaffirmed the involvement of Cu(II)/Cu(III)/Cu(I) species in the Chan-Lam type of coupling.

         <title>Coordination and Stabilization of a Lithium Ion with a Silylene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stabilization effect: We have synthesized and characterized a silylene stabilized lithium ion 1. Compound 1 exhibits presence of two four&#8208; membered and one six&#8208; membered ring as confirmed by QTAIM calculations. Compound 2 shows unusual dissociation of carbodiimide to give two four&#8208;membered rings containing a penta&#8208;coordinated silicon as a central atom. Furthermore, the bond nature and stabilization of compound 1 were confirmed by quantum theory of atoms in molecules.







Abstract
Herein, we report the stabilization of lithium&#8208;ion as the source of lithium to use as a trans&#8208;metalation reagent [{PhC(NtBu)2Si(tBu)Li}2I(tBuN)2CPh] (1). The reaction of 3 equivalents of the LSitBu (L=PhC(NtBu)2) and lithium iodide at low temperature leads to a silylene stabilized lithium&#8208;ion with an additional coordination of amidinate ligand. Compound 1 shows two four membered and one six membered ring as confirmed by QTAIM calculations. Whereas the reaction of the LSiCl with 1.5 equivalents of carbodiimide (CyN)2C at room temperature affords compound [PhC(NtBu)2Si(Cl)(NCy)2NCy] (2) with the CN2SiN2C skeleton containing silicon as a central atom. Both the compounds were fully characterized by NMR, mass spectrometry, X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis, and quantum mechanical calculations.

         <title>Fluorinated Dihydropentalene&#8208;1,4&#8208;Dione: A Strong Electron&#8208;Accepting Unit with Organic Semiconductor Characteristics</title>

Toward D&#8208;A&#8208;based &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules: Fluorinated pentalene&#8208;1,4&#8208;dione (FPD), a strong electron&#8208;accepting unit was designed, and a derivative that contains a donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor (D&#8722;A&#8722;D) conjugated molecule for use in organic semiconducting materials is reported. The compound was characterized based on its electrochemical properties, photophysical properties, and X&#8208;ray analyses to elucidate the structure&#8211;property relationships of the compounds.







Abstract
The development of electron&#8208;accepting units is of significant importance because the construction of donor (D)&#8208;acceptor (A) configurations is an effective strategy for tuning the electronic properties of &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems. Although doubly fused pentagons represented by diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) have been used as an effective electron&#8208;accepting unit, the relatively high&#8208;lying frontier molecular orbital levels (FMOs) leave room for further improvement. We report herein the synthesis of a fluorinated dihydropentalene&#8208;1,4&#8208;dione (FPD) derivative as a strong electron&#8208;accepting unit and the development of D&#8722;A&#8722;D &#960;&#8208;extended molecules. X&#8208;ray analyses revealed that the presence of fluorine atoms contributed to the formation of high planar structures and slipped&#8208;stacked packing. Electrochemical measurements indicated that the FPD derivatives showed relatively lower FMO energy levels than the corresponding DPP&#8208;containing derivatives. The D&#8722;A&#8722;D molecule based on terthiophene and FPD showed semiconducting responses. This study demonstrates that the FPD unit can function as a new acceptor unit for organic semiconductors.

         <title>Enantioselective Desymmetrization Triggered by Iminium&#8208;Enamine Activation: Access to Complex Cyclohepta[b]indoles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organocatalysis: Asymmetric desymmetrization of prochiral enal&#8208;tethered cyclohexadienones has been developed by using organocatalytic iminium&#8208;enamine activation. The reaction provides an access to bicyclic enones with excellent enantioselectivity and diastereoselectivity, which further undergo acid&#8208;mediated intramolecular annulation to afford highly strained and complex cyclohepta[b]indoles with five contiguous stereocentres.







Abstract
The expeditious construction of complex molecules having multiple stereocentres is highly desirable in organic chemistry. In the present communication, we report the development of an organocatalytic asymmetric desymmetrization of prochiral enal&#8208;tethered cyclohexadienones via the C3&#8208;selective Friedel&#8722;Crafts alkylation of indoles triggered by LUMO&#8208;lowering iminium activation/HOMO&#8208;raising enamine activation. The reaction provides access to bicyclic enones, which further undergo acid&#8208;mediated intramolecular annulation from C2&#8208;position to afford highly strained cyclohepta[b]indoles with five contiguous stereocentres and three new C&#8722;C bonds in excellent enantioselectivity and diastereoselectivity.

         <dc:description>
A new pathway to access polycyclic (hetero&#8208;)aromatic compounds from simple starting materials has been investigated. The starting materials are funneled in an organocatalyzed higher&#8208;order cycloaddition that generates three&#8208;dimensional polycyclic (hetero&#8208;)aromatic compounds. The compounds are then easily flattened to their two&#8208;dimensional analogues by oxidation. More information can be found in the Concept by K.&#8197;A. J&#248;rgensen and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202204008).

Not only useful it is as luminophore, but also does it serve as a building block for Tr&#246;ger's base regioregular ladder polymer. The ladder polymer nicely shows reversible adsorption/desorption behavior of carbon dioxide molecule.







Abstract
A new class of diamino&#8208;substituted &#960;&#8208;extended phenazine compound was synthesized, and its photophysical properties were investigated. The U&#8208;shaped diaminophenazine displayed photoluminescence in solution with moderate quantum yield. The diamino aromatic compound was found applicable to the poly&#8208;condensation with formaldehyde to form Tr&#246;ger's base ladder polymer. The obtained microporous ladder polymer features high CO2 adsorption selectivity against N2, most likely due to the presence of basic nitrogen atoms in the phenazine rings.

         <title>Diverse Cooperative Reactivity at a Square Planar Aluminium Complex and Catalytic Reduction of CO2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structural constraint imparted by a sterically demanding pincer ligand results in an unusual tetracoordinate aluminium Lewis acid that undergoes multiple modes of metal&#8208;ligand cooperative reactivity with ketones and CO2. Adding HBpin allows for the catalytic hydroboration of carbonyl&#8208;containing substrates and the reduction of CO2 to a methanol equivalent.







Abstract
The use of a sterically demanding pincer ligand to prepare an unusual square planar aluminium complex is reported. Due to the constrained geometry imposed by the ligand scaffold, this four&#8208;coordinate aluminium centre remains Lewis acidic and reacts via differing metal&#8208;ligand cooperative pathways for activating ketones and CO2. It is also a rare example of a single&#8208;component aluminium system for the catalytic reduction of CO2 to a methanol equivalent at room temperature.

         <title>Quinoid Conjugated Polymer Nanoparticles with NIR&#8208;II Absorption Peak Toward Efficient Photothermal Therapy
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quinoid conjugated polymer PIS with broad absorption in the NIR&#8208;II region is developed based on multiple strategies. Benefiting from its remarkable photothermal conversion behavior under NIR&#8208;II laser (1064&#8197;nm), PIS nanoparticles show excellent antitumor performances in both in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo studies. This work presents a rational design strategy to explore NIR&#8208;II photothermal agents for hyperthermia therapy.







Abstract
Recently, extensive efforts have been devoted to the development of the second near&#8208;infrared bio&#8208;window (NIR&#8208;II, 1000&#8211;1700&#8197;nm) theranostic agents owing to the excellent tissue&#8208;penetration capability of NIR&#8208;II light. The exploration of organic NIR&#8208;II photothermal therapy materials, especially those with absorption peak over 1000&#8197;nm, is an appealing yet significantly challenging task. Herein, we have designed conjugated polymer nanoparticles (PIS NPs) with NIR&#8208;II absorption peak at 1026&#8197;nm through a combined strategy of introducing quinoid donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8211;A) structures, constructing intramolecular &#8220;conformational locks&#8221; and extending the conjugation area to narrow the band gap. Irradiated at 1064&#8197;nm, PIS NPs showed remarkable photothermal conversion performance for efficient photothermal ablation of tumor cells in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo. This study provides useful insights into the rational design of organic NIR&#8208;II photothermal agents based on multiple strategies.

         <title>Plenates: Anion&#8208;Dependent Self&#8208;Assembly of the Pyrrole Cage Encapsulating Silver(I) Clusters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The self&#8208;assembly of 2,5&#8208;diformylpyrrole, tris(2&#8208;aminoethyl)amine, and silver(I) yielded a series of new cascade complexes or plenates, that is, cryptates incorporating Agnn+ clusters. The tripyrrolic cage is represented by a wooden chest hiding the treasure, which in the case of plenates, contains a pile of shiny silver atoms. In contrast, for cascade complexes, two precious metals lie next to anions shown as colorful gems. Obviously, such treasure cannot remain unprotected&#8230; More information can be found in the Research Article by B. Szyszko and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202203850).

Electrospray&#8208;ionization mass spectrometry easily distinguishes the different living oligomers resulting from the anionic ring&#8208;opening polymerization of the acceptor&#8208;substituted cyclopropane Mcyclic. Kinetic modeling reproduces the measured time evolution of the growing oligomers and affords the rate constants of the individual propagation steps.

         <title>Tailoring Galactose Oxidase for Self&#8208;powered Benzyl Alcohol Sensing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract: Benzyl alcohol (BnOH) is a widely&#8208;used preservative in a variety of cosmetics, but the excess addition (&#8805;1.0%) may cause strong symptoms such as nausea, gastrointestinal irritation, convulsion, even death, making it crucial to monitor and control the addition quantity. Herein, we have developed a test&#8208;strip&#8208;like BnOH detection method via tailoring a galactose oxidase (GOase) towards BnOH oxidation and preparing a self&#8208;powered electrochromic strip for BnOH concentration visualization. A double&#8208;substituted GOase variant (Y329S/R330F) on the basis of the reported GOase M1 has been obtained by semi&#8208;rational design with a 24.6&#8208;fold improved activity towards BnOH compared to GOase M1. The GOase Y329S/R330F electrode responses BnOH with a linear range of 0.04 to 3.25 mM (R2=0.9985), a sensitivity of 122.78 &#181;A mM&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2, and a detection limit of 0.03 mM (S/N=3). Coupling an electrochromic Prussian blue (PB) cathode helps the successful sensing visualization without any further power supply. The present sensing is more convenient and user&#8208;friendly than the generally used gas chromatography (GC) and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and brings a more accessible solution to the field of quality controlling.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Abstract: Benzyl alcohol (BnOH) is a widely-used preservative in a variety of cosmetics, but the excess addition (&#8805;1.0%) may cause strong symptoms such as nausea, gastrointestinal irritation, convulsion, even death, making it crucial to monitor and control the addition quantity. Herein, we have developed a test-strip-like BnOH detection method via tailoring a galactose oxidase (GOase) towards BnOH oxidation and preparing a self-powered electrochromic strip for BnOH concentration visualization. A double-substituted GOase variant (Y329S/R330F) on the basis of the reported GOase M1 has been obtained by semi-rational design with a 24.6-fold improved activity towards BnOH compared to GOase M1. The GOase Y329S/R330F electrode responses BnOH with a linear range of 0.04 to 3.25 mM (R2=0.9985), a sensitivity of 122.78 &#181;A mM&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2, and a detection limit of 0.03 mM (S/N=3).

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced Diradical&#8208;Mediated ipso&#8208;Cyclization towards Double Dearomative [2+2]&#8208;Cycloaddition or Smiles&#8208;Type Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diradical&#8208;mediated ipso&#8208;cyclization involving dearomatizing spiro&#8208;intermediates of aromatic compounds towards divergent reaction pathways deserves investigation but has been rarely reported so far. By tuning the rate of C&#8722;S bond cleavage in the key dearomatizing spiro intermediate, a chemical divergent reaction of (hetero)aryl sulfonamides has been achieved in a visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced energy transfer reaction pathway involving diradical species.







Abstract
When mono&#8208;radical ipso&#8208;cyclization of aryl sulfonamides tend to undergo Smiles&#8208;type rearrangement through aromatization&#8208;driven C&#8722;S bond cleavage, diradical&#8208;mediated cyclization must perform in a distinct reaction pathway. It is interesting meanwhile challenging to tune the rate of C&#8722;S bond cleavage to achieve a chemically divergent reaction of (hetero) aryl sulfonamides in a visible&#8208;light induced energy transfer (EnT) reaction pathway involving diradical species. Herein a chemically divergent reaction based on the designed indole&#8208;tethered (hetero)arylsulfonamides is reported which involves a diradical&#8208;mediated ipso&#8208;cyclization and a controllable cleavage of an inherent C&#8722;S bond. The combined experimental and computational results have revealed that the cleavage of the C&#8722;S bond in these substrates can be controlled by tuning the heteroaryl moieties: a) If the (hetero)aryl is thienyl, furyl, phenanthryl, etc., the radical coupling of double dearomative diradicals (DDDR) precedes over C&#8722;S bond cleavage to afford cyclobutene fused indolines by double dearomative [2+2]&#8208;cycloaddition; b) if the (hetero)aryl is phenyl, naphthyl, pyridyl, indolyl etc., the cleavage of C&#8722;S bond in DDDR is favored over radical coupling to afford biaryl products.

         <dc:description>We report the synthesis of 2&#8208;(4,5&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;1H&#8208;imidazole&#8208;2&#8208;yl)phenol (TPI&#8208;9) as an interesting fluorescent molecule displaying Excited&#8208;State Intramolecular&#8208;Proton&#8208;Transfer (ESIPT) with Stokes shift of 120 nm. Phenolic compounds with the ability to form intramolecular hydrogen bonds and subsequent proton transfer are known as ESIPT fluorophores. Proton accepting ability can increase significantly by tailoring electron&#8208;donating groups. With the assistance of an environment&#8208;friendly organocatalyst, 10&#8208;camphor sulfonic acid (10&#8208;CSA), TPI&#8208;9 was synthesized to introduce substituents with electron&#8208;donating abilities to develop an efficient ESIPT mechanism. Factors influencing the emission, such as solvent, pH, and metal ions, are investigated. Quenching of fluorescence by Cu2+ through chelation enhancement quenching effect with a high selectivity allowed the establishment of a Cu2+ sensor with an LoD of 0.57 ppm and a ratiometric estimation with an LoD of 0.73 ppm. Metal binding (2:1) stoichiometry and quenching constant (0.0072 mol&#8208;1s&#8208;1) are calculated from Job&#8217;s and Stern&#8208;Volmer plots. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations are in accordance with the experimental results. Competitive replacement of TPI&#8208;9 by amino acids restores ESIPT, consequently, the fluorescence. Thus, an &#8220;off&#8208;on&#8221; fluorescence sensor for amino acid estimation is developed under 1&#8208;minute incubation. A linear relationship between amino acid concentration and fluorescence intensity is in 0&#8208;20 &#956;g/mL range, and the LoD is less than 2.2 &#956;g/mL</dc:description>

         <title>Defects&#8208;abundant Ga 2 O 3 &#160;nanobricks&#160;enabled multifunctional&#160;solid polymer electrolyte for&#160;superior&#160;lithium metal batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polyethylene oxide (PEO)&#8208;based polymer electrolytes with good flexibility and viscoelasticity, low interfacial resistance, and fabricating cost have caught worldwide attention, but their practical application is still hampered by the instability at high voltages and the ionic conductivity (10&#8722;8 to 10&#8722;6 S cm&#8722;1). Herein, we rational designed defects&#8208;abundant Ga2O3&#160;nanobricks as multifunctional filler constructed a PEO&#8208;based organic&#8208;inorganic electrolyte for lithium metal batteries. Due to the abundant O&#8208;defects&#160;feature of Ga2O3&#160;filler, this PEO&#8208;based composite&#160;electrolyte not only broadens electrochemical stability window&#160;(over 5.3&#160;V versus Li/Li+)&#160;but also in&#8208;situ forms a Li&#8211;Ga alloy and solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) film during the cycling process causing a rapid diffusion of Li+&#160;ions. The as&#8208;prepared electrolyte achieves the effect of stabilizing interfacial with Li metal (without short&#8208;circuiting over 500 h at 0.2 mA cm&#8722;2) and possesses superior high ionic conductivity. The assembled all&#8208;solid&#8208;state LiFePO4//Li cells attained a superior cycling performance of 146 mAh g&#8722;1 over 100 cycles at 0.5 C.&#160;The XPS analysis reveals that Ga2O3&#160;nanobricks can form a Li&#8208;Ga alloy layer in situ at the polymer/anode interface.&#160;This work shed a light on designing high ionic conductivity lithium alloys in the composite electrolyte to improve the electrochemical properties of PEO&#8208;based polymer electrolytes.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Polyethylene oxide (PEO)-based polymer electrolytes with good flexibility and viscoelasticity, low interfacial resistance, and fabricating cost have caught worldwide attention, but their practical application is still hampered by the instability at high voltages and the ionic conductivity (10&#8722;8 to 10&#8722;6 S cm&#8722;1). Herein, we rational designed defects-abundant Ga2O3&#160;nanobricks as multifunctional filler constructed a PEO-based organic-inorganic electrolyte for lithium metal batteries. Due to the abundant O-defects&#160;feature of Ga2O3&#160;filler, this PEO-based composite&#160;electrolyte not only broadens electrochemical stability window&#160;(over 5.3&#160;V versus Li/Li+)&#160;but also in-situ forms a Li&#8211;Ga alloy and solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) film during the cycling process causing a rapid diffusion of Li+&#160;ions. The as-prepared electrolyte achieves the effect of stabilizing interfacial with Li metal (without short-circuiting over 500 h at 0.2 mA cm&#8722;2) and possesses superior high ionic conductivity. The assembled all-solid-state LiFePO4//Li cells attained a superior cycling performance of 146 mAh g&#8722;1 over 100 cycles at 0.5 C.&#160;The XPS analysis reveals that Ga2O3&#160;nanobricks can form a Li-Ga alloy layer in situ at the polymer/anode interface.&#160;This work shed a light on designing high ionic conductivity lithium alloys in the composite electrolyte to improve the electrochemical properties of PEO-based polymer electrolytes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

We have successfully derived molecular structures of HBI, HBIA and H3BIdm which reveals that in HBI and HBIA, the phenolic &#8208;OH is intramolecularly hydrogen bonded with sp2N of benzimidazole group whereas in H3BIdm, it is hydrogen bonded with imine C=N of Schiff base moiety, which is responsible for different solid state emission properties of the reported compounds. Extensive experimental and theoretical studies show that for all three Schiff bases, in solution due to activation of C=N isomerization, ESIPT operates through benzimidazole site and displays different emission from the solid state. Furthermore, H2BIo, H3BIdm and H2BIp selectively sense Cu2+ in semi aqueous medium with nano&#8208;molar detection limit and in HuH&#8208;7 cells through the inhibition of ESIPT of process.</dc:description>

         <title>Bioinspired Design of an Uncharged Ambipolar Helical Scaffold to Achieve Efficient Solid&#8208;State Proton Conduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This work demonstrates highly efficient solid&#8208;state proton conduction in helical organic scaffolds inspired by the biomolecule Gramicidin A. The scaffold 1 derived from pyridine&#8208;2,6&#8208;dicarboxamide (PDC) residue adopts a helical conformation that is stabilized by a network of strong bifurcated intramolecular H&#8208;bonds between the polar residues that align the inner (concave) face of the molecule, while the aromatic units present in 1 are oriented outwardly. As a result, the helix attains an ambipolar nature just like Gramicidin A. Two different solid forms of 1 could be isolated: a yellow solid from high&#8208;polarity solvents and an orange solid from low&#8208;polarity solvents. Single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) studies showed that in the former, molecules of 1 are stacked in a homochiral fashion while in the latter heterochiral stacks of 1 were present. The yellow form exhibited almost &#8764;300&#8208;fold higher conductivity (of up to 0.12 mS/cm at 95 &#176;C and 95% relative humidity) than the orange form as a result of closer intermolecular proximity and lower activation energy of 0.098 eV indicating Grotthus mechanism of proton transport. This study establishes the key role of bioinspired design and controlled stereo&#8208;organization of such discrete uncharged organic molecules for achieving efficient solid state proton conduction.</dc:description>

Despite the significance, the direct construction of hetero&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;trisubstituted benzene core was far less&#8208;developed.

         <title>Liquid Dynamics Determine Transition Metal&#8208;N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Complex Formation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Getting beyond first base: To choose the best base in NHC complex syntheses, considerations beyond pKa values are necessary. The high activity of ionic bases can be explained through their affinity to form ion pairs with the substrate imidazolium cation, allowing for a more frequent interaction with the acidic site of the ring.







Abstract
The mechanism of metal&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) complex formation from imidazolium salts in the presence of weak bases was investigated through theoretical methods. Quantum chemical calculations revealed that the two bases considered here, sodium acetate and trimethylamine, both facilitate complex formation. In contrast to previous experiments, these calculations indicated a slightly lower barrier with the amine. Molecular dynamics simulations showed that the ionic nature of the [AuCl2]&#8722; and imidazolium ions, as well as the sodium acetate base keep these species associated in the reaction mixture through ion pairing. This pre&#8208;association of the components produces those clusters that are essential for the metal complex formation reaction. The neutral amine, however, remains mostly separated from the other reaction partners, making it a significantly less effective base.

         <title>Specific Signal Enhancement on an RNA&#8208;Protein Interface by Dynamic Nuclear Polarization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A guide to better spectra: Dynamic nuclear polarization, sparse isotope labeling, and methyl dynamics have been combined to yield site&#8208;specific enhancement of NMR spectroscopic signals from the protein&#8208;RNA binding site within a ribonucleoprotein. For L7Ae protein in complex with guide RNA from box C/D complex, a single methyl&#8208;nucleotide contact can be spectroscopically isolated.







Abstract
Sensitivity and specificity are both crucial for the efficient solid&#8208;state NMR structure determination of large biomolecules. We present an approach that features both advantages by site&#8208;specific enhancement of NMR spectroscopic signals from the protein&#8208;RNA binding site within a ribonucleoprotein (RNP) by dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP). This approach uses modern biochemical techniques for sparse isotope labeling and exploits the molecular dynamics of 13C&#8208;labeled methyl groups exclusively present in the protein. These dynamics drive heteronuclear cross relaxation and thus allow specific hyperpolarization transfer across the biomolecular complex's interface. For the example of the L7Ae protein in complex with a 26mer guide RNA minimal construct from the box C/D complex in archaea, we demonstrate that a single methyl&#8208;nucleotide contact is responsible for most of the polarization transfer to the RNA, and that this specific transfer can be used to boost both NMR spectral sensitivity and specificity by DNP.

For the example of the L7Ae protein in complex with a 26mer guide RNA minimal construct from the box C/D complex in archaea, we demonstrate that a single methyl-nucleotide contact is responsible for most of the polarization transfer to the RNA, and that this specific transfer can be used to boost both NMR spectral sensitivity and specificity by DNP.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Unearthing azatriseptane: Explore the properties and potential of a newly synthesized, highly strained carbon framework with a nitrogen core, containing three fused heptagon rings. This heterocycle could serve as an encouraging platform from which to explore the supramolecular behavior of these contorted hydrogen&#8208;bonding systems or to obtain negatively curved nanographenes. More information can be found in the Research Article by M. Rickhaus and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202203954).

         <title>Tetrelanes versus Tetrylenes as Precursors to Transition Metal Complexes Featuring Tridentate PEP Tetryl Ligands (E=Si, Ge, Sn)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
PEP ligands: Two general synthetic approaches to the synthesis of tridentate PEP tetryl (E=Si, Ge, Sn) metal complexes are presented as a function of the metal&#8208;free precursor, tetrelane or tetrylene, that gives rise to the final PEP tetryl ligand. For each approach, all the currently known types of PEP tetryl ligand frameworks that have been found in their corresponding complexes are presented and discussed.







Abstract
Two synthetic approaches have until now been used to synthesize transition metal complexes having a tridentate (pincer or tripod) PEP tetryl (E=Si, Ge, Sn) ligand. These approaches differ in the metal&#8208;free precursor, tetrelane or tetrylene, that gives rise to the corresponding PEP tetryl ligand. Tetrelanes (PSiP silanes, PGeP germanes and PSnP stannanes and simple phosphane&#8208;free stannanes) have led to tetryl ligands by oxidatively adding an E&#8722;X bond (X=H, C or halogen in most cases) to the metal atom of a low&#8208;valent transition metal complex, whereas tetrylenes (PGeP germylenes and PSnP stannylenes) have led to tetryl ligands upon insertion of their E atom into an M&#8722;X bond (X=Cl in most cases) of the metal precursor or through a derivatization of the E atom after the tetrylene fragment is coordinated to the metal. For each synthetic approach, all the currently known types of PEP tetryl ligand frameworks that have been found in transition metal complexes are presented and discussed in this review.

         <title>Chalcogen&#8208;Bond Catalysis: Telluronium&#8208;Catalyzed [4+2]&#8208;Cyclocondensation of (in situ Generated) Aryl Imines with Alkenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Telluronium salts bearing electron&#8208;withdrawing groups were prepared, and their ability to drive chalcogen bonds with ketones and imines was demonstrated in the solid state and in solution. These strong &#963;&#8208;hole bond donors were able to efficiently catalyze the Povarov reaction through chalcogen bond activation of imines and subsequent reaction with alkenes. The title reaction was found to be as efficient with pre&#8208;formed or in situ generated imines.







Abstract
In the chalcogen series, tellurium species exhibit the strongest chalcogen bonding (ChB) interaction with electron&#8208;rich atom. This property explains the renewed interested toward tellurium&#8208;based derivatives and their use in different applications, such as organocatalysis. In this context, the catalytic activity of telluronium salts in the Povarov reaction is presented herein. Different dienophiles, as well as imines of variable electronic nature, efficiently react in the presence of catalytic amount of either diarylmethyltelluronium or triaryltelluronium salts. Both catalysts could also readily perform the three&#8208;component Povarov reaction starting from aldehyde, aniline and dihydrofuran. The reactivity of telluroniums towards imines and aldehydes was confirmed in the solid state by the ability of Te atom to interact through ChB with the oxygen carbonyl of acetone, and in solution with significant shift variations of the imine proton and of the tellurium atom in 1H and 125Te NMR spectroscopy. For the most active telluronium catalysts bearing CF3 groups, association constants (K) with N&#8208;phenyl phenylmethanimine in the range 22&#8211;38&#8197;M&#8722;1 were measured in dichloromethane.

         <title>Activity Sensing of Coagulation and Fibrinolytic Proteases</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the essential proteases involved in blood coagulation and fibrinolysis, the endogenous peptide sequences they recognize and hydrolyze, and synthetic activity&#8208;based peptide probes based on these sequences to measure their activity. The existing strategies summarized in this review could contribute to the challenges ahead in the field of coagulation and fibrinolytic monitoring, especially for point&#8208;of&#8208;care applications.







Abstract
The blood coagulation cascade is a complex physiological process involving the action of multiple coupled enzymes, cofactors, and substrates, ultimately leading to clot formation. Serine proteases have a crucial role, and aberrations in their activity can lead to life&#8208;threatening bleeding disorders and thrombosis. This review summarizes the essential proteases involved in blood coagulation and fibrinolysis, the endogenous peptide sequences they recognize and hydrolyze, and synthetic peptide probes based on these sequences to measure their activity. The information in this review can contribute to developing novel anticoagulant therapies and specific substrates for point&#8208;of&#8208;care diagnosis of coagulation pathologies.

         <title>Substituent&#8208;Dependent Photoexcitation Processes of &#960;&#8208;Stacked Ion Pairs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Various combinations of porphyrin ions with controlled electronic states were achieved by ion&#8208;pair metathesis based on the hard and soft acids and bases (HSAB) theory. The transient absorption spectra of the porphyrin ion pairs revealed photoinduced electron transfer from the anion to the cation through substituent&#8208;dependent photoexcitation processes.







Abstract
Porphyrin ion pairs, the charge of which is delocalized in core units, form tightly associated structures through i&#960;&#8211;i&#960; interactions. 5,10,15&#8208;Triphenyl&#8208;substituted porphyrin&#8211;AuIII complex, which is favorable for forming stacked structures in the form of a stable ion, has been synthesized. Ion&#8208;pair metathesis based on the hard and soft acids and bases theory enabled combination with porphyrin anions possessing electronic states controlled by electron&#8208;donating and electron&#8208;withdrawing groups. Transient absorption spectroscopy suggested that the lifetimes of the radical pairs generated by photoinduced electron transfer of the ion pairs could be controlled by a judicious combination of the anions and cations.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The parameters that determine the formation of linear peptides and cyclic dimers (diketopiperazine, DKP) on silica surfaces of different surface area, silanol and siloxane ring populations, controlled by thermal treatments, are investigated upon glycine deposition from gas and liquid phases. The formed products were characterized by infrared and Raman spectroscopies, X&#8208;ray diffraction and thermogravimetric analysis. The results reveal the importance of &#8220;nearly&#8208;free&#8221; silanols to form ester centers as primers for the formation of linear peptides over DKP, on surfaces with medium silanol density (1.4 to 2.7 nm&#8208;2). Quenched reactivity is seen on isolated silanols (density &#8804; 0.7 nm&#8208;2), while silanols involved in hydrogen bonding (density of 4.5 nm&#8208;2) weakly interact with Gly resulting in its cyclization to DKP. Deposition of glycine from liquid phase may also form both DKP and linear polymers, depending on its loading and silica surface. These conclusions demonstrate the complexity of glycine surface chemistry in the polymerization reaction and highlight the interest of a surface science approach to evaluate geochemical prebiotic scenarios.</dc:description>

         <title>Design of Aurone&#8208;Based Dual&#8208;State Emissive (DSE) Fluorophores</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of dual&#8208;state emissive (DSE) fluorophores, i.e. organic molecules showing balanced emission in both solution and as molecular solids, has recently become an emerging approach in material science, biology, sensing, and optoelectronics. However, the majority of existing DSE fluorophores represents structural modifications of the scaffolds known for their aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) properties, e.g. tetraphenylethylenes (TFE), triphenylamines (TFA), and others. In this study, we introduce aurones as an easily accessible scaffold for the construction of DSE fluorophores and describe the main design principles allowing to achieve the balanced emission in both solution and solid state. Herein, we present the solid&#8208;state fluorescence in a systematic series of aurone derivatives for the first time. We propose that the newly found DSE properties of aurones in combination with their established biological activity can be applied efficiently in biomedical studies and diagnostic tools.</dc:description>

         <title>Orbital Nature of Carboionic Monoradicals Made from Diradicals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electronic, optical, and solid state properties of a series of monoradicals, anions and cations, obtained from starting neutral diradicals, have been studied. Diradicals based on s&#8208;indacene and indenoacenes, with benzothiophenes fused and in different orientations feature a varying degree of diradical character in the neutral state which is here related with the properties of the radical redox forms. The analysis of their optical features in the polymethine monoradicals has been carried out in the framework of the molecular orbital and valence bond theories. Electronic UV&#8208;Vis&#8208;NIR absorption, x&#8208;ray solid state diffraction and quantum chemical calculations have been carried out. Studies of the different positive/negative charged species, both residing in the same skeletal p&#8208;conjugated backbone, are rare for organic molecules. The key factor for the dual stabilization is the presence in the starting diradical character that enables to indistinctively accommodate a pseudo&#8208;hole and a pseudo&#8208;electron defect with certainly small reorganization energies for ambipolar charge transport.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and densification of Mo/Mg co&#8208;doped apatite&#8208;type lanthanum silicate electrolyte&#160;with enhanced ionic conductivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Apatite&#8208;type lanthanum silicate (LSO) electrolyte is one of the most promising candidates for developing intermediate&#8208;temperature&#160;solid oxide electrolysis cells&#160;and solid oxide full cells (IT&#8208;SOECs and SOFCs) due to its stability and low&#160;activation energy. However, the LSO electrolyte still suffers from unsatisfied ionic conductivity and low relative density. Here in this work, a novel co&#8208;doping method is reported to prepare highly purified nanocrystalline powder of Mg&#8208;Mo co&#8208;doped LSO (Mg/Mo&#8208;LSO) electrolytes with high excellent densification properties and improved ionic conductivity. Introducing the Mo6+&#160;and Mg2+&#160;ions into the LSO structure can increase the number of interstitial oxide ions and improve the degree of densification at lower sintering temperatures, more importantly, expand the migration channel of oxide ions to enhance the ionic conductivity. As a result, the relative density of the fabricated Mo/Mg&#8208;LSO electrolytes pellets could achieve more than 98% of the theoretical density after sintering at 1500 &#8451; for 4 h with a grain size of about 1&#8208;3 &#956;m and the EIS results showed the ionic conductivity increased from 0.782 mS&#183;cm&#8208;1&#160;for the pristine LSO to 33.94 mS&#183;cm&#8208;1&#160;for the doped sample La9.5Si5.45Mg0.3Mo0.25O26+&#948;&#160;at 800 &#8451;. In addition, the effect of different Mo6+&#160;doping contents was investigated systematically. The proposed Mo/Mg co&#8208;doping method&#160;is one step forward in developing apatite&#8208;structured electrolytes&#160;addressing the common issues associated with the fabrication of dense, highly conductive, and thermochemically stable solid electrolytes.</dc:description>

         <title>Funneled Depolymerization of Ionic Liquid&#8208;Based Biorefinery &#8220;Heterogeneous&#8221; Lignin into Guaiacols over Reusable Palladium Catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The efficient utilization of lignin, the direct source of renewable aromatics, into value&#8208;added renewable chemicals is an important step towards sustainable biorefinery practices. Nevertheless, owing to the random heterogeneous structure and limited solubility, lignin utilization has been primarily limited to burning for energy. The catalytic depolymerization of lignin has been proposed and demonstrated as a viable route to sustainable biorefinery, however, low yields and poor selectivity of products, high char formation, and limited to no recycling of transition&#8208;metal&#8208;based catalyst involved in lignin depolymerization demands attention to enable practical&#8208;scale lignocellulosic biorefineries. In this study, we demonstrate the catalytic depolymerization of ionic liquid&#8208;based biorefinery poplar lignin into guaiacols over a reusable zirconium phosphate supported palladium catalyst. The essence of the study lies in the high conversion (&gt;80%), minimum char formation (7&#8208;16%), high yields of guaiacols (up to 200 mg / g of lignin), and catalyst reusability. Both solid residue, liquid stream, and gaseous products were thoroughly characterized using ICP&#8208;OES, PXRD, CHN analysis, GC&#8208;MS, GPC, and 2D NMR to understand the hydrogenolysis pathway.</dc:description>

         <title>Orientational Control of Circularly Polarized Luminescence from Pyrene Clusters using a DNA Scaffold.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We herein investigated chiroptical activities of pyrene clusters incorporated within a DNA duplex. Three pyrene derivatives were prepared on D&#8208;threoninol linkers to allow incorporation within a DNA strand. DNA scaffolds were prepared containing dimers, tetramers, and hexamers of the pyrene derivatives. The homo dimers of 1&#8208;pyrenecarboxylic acid and of 4&#8208;pyrenecarboxylic acid, but not 2&#8208;pyrenecarboxylic acid, emitted intense circularly polarized luminescence signals. Although increasing the number of pyrene units weakened the signal, insertion of natural base pairs between two dimers enhanced its intensity. Interestingly, circularly polarized luminescence intensities varied non&#8208;monotonically depending on the number of intervening base pairs, indicating the importance of orientation between pyrene dimers. The results presented here will lead to development bright circularly polarized luminescence materials and probes.</dc:description>

         <title>The Facile Synthesis of TPE&#8208;Based Fluorophores Derived by &#960;&#8208;Extended Systems: Opposite Mechanofluorochromism, Anti&#8208;counterfeiting and Bioimaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although remarkable progresses are achieved in the design and development of the mono&#8208;shift in photoluminescence for mechanofluorochromic materials, it is still a severe challenge to explore the opposite mechanofluorochromic materials with both blue&#8208; and red&#8208;shifted photoluminescence. Herein, two unprecedented 4,5&#8208;bis(TPE)&#8208;1H&#8208;imidazole fused pyridine or quinoline&#8208;based fluorophores X&#8208;1 and X&#8208;2 were designed and synthesized, and X&#8208;1 and X&#8208;2, exhibit completely opposite mechanofluorochromic behaviour. Under UV lamp, the color of pristine X&#8208;1 changed from blue to green with reversible red&#8208;shifted 27 nm in fluorescence emission spectra after ground, while the color of pristine X&#8208;2 changed from red to yellow with reversible blue&#8208;shifted 74 nm after ground. The detailed characterizations (including PXRD, SEM and DSC) confirmed that this opposite mechanofluorochromism was attributed to the transformation of order&#8208;crystalline and amorphous states. The crystal structure analysis and theoretical calculation further explain that opposite mechanofluorochromic behavior take into account different &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking mode by inducd &#960;&#8208;extended systems. In addition, these TPE&#8208;based Fluorophores (X&#8208;1 and X&#8208;2) exhibited excellent bio&#8208;compatibility and fluorescence properties for bio&#8208;imaging, writable data storage and anti&#8208;counterfeiting materials.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Although remarkable progresses are achieved in the design and development of the mono-shift in photoluminescence for mechanofluorochromic materials, it is still a severe challenge to explore the opposite mechanofluorochromic materials with both blue- and red-shifted photoluminescence. Herein, two unprecedented 4,5-bis(TPE)-1H-imidazole fused pyridine or quinoline-based fluorophores X-1 and X-2 were designed and synthesized, and X-1 and X-2, exhibit completely opposite mechanofluorochromic behaviour. Under UV lamp, the color of pristine X-1 changed from blue to green with reversible red-shifted 27 nm in fluorescence emission spectra after ground, while the color of pristine X-2 changed from red to yellow with reversible blue-shifted 74 nm after ground. The detailed characterizations (including PXRD, SEM and DSC) confirmed that this opposite mechanofluorochromism was attributed to the transformation of order-crystalline and amorphous states. The crystal structure analysis and theoretical calculation further explain that opposite mechanofluorochromic behavior take into account different &#960;-&#960; stacking mode by inducd &#960;-extended systems. In addition, these TPE-based Fluorophores (X-1 and X-2) exhibited excellent bio-compatibility and fluorescence properties for bio-imaging, writable data storage and anti-counterfeiting materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Effective SrWO4/TiO2 heterojunction with enhanced carriers separation and transfer for photocatalytic methane oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic methane oxidation to oxygenates with promising performance remains as a grand challenge due to the low productivity and severe overoxidation. Herein, SrWO4/TiO2 heterojunction was developed for photocatalytic methane oxidation with O2 to liquid oxygenates products at mild reaction conditions. The optimized SrWO4/TiO2 catalyst exhibited high productivity of 13365&#160;&#956;mol/g with high selectivity of 98.7% for oxygenates. Benefited from the intimate heterojunction interface of SrWO4/TiO2, the constructed &#8544;&#8208;type heterostructure improved the separation and transfer of photogenerated carriers, and a high&#8208;speed transfer channel for photogenerated carriers was fabricated. Simultaneously, the special band structure can increase the amount of photogenerated electrons and holes on TiO2 surface, which promoted the formation of reactive oxygen species to enhance liquid oxygenates productivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Automated Glycan Assembly of Mycobacterial Hexaarabinofuranoside and Docosasaccharide Arabinan (Arbf23) Motifs found on&#160;Mycobacterium tuberculosis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mycobacteria&#160;are covered in a thick layer of different polysaccharides that helps to avert the innate immune response. Lipoarabinomannan (LAM) and arabinogalactan (AG) are ubiquitously contained in these envelopes and rapid access to defined oligo&#8208; and polysaccharides is essential to elucidate their structural and biological roles. Arabinofuranose (Araf)residues in LAM and AG are connected either via&#160;&#945;&#8208;1,2&#8208;trans&#160;linkages that are synthetically straightforward to install or the more challenging&#160;&#946;&#8208;(1,2&#8208;cis) linkages.

         <title>Enantiodivergent Sulfoxidation Catalyzed by a Photoswitchable Iron Salen Phosphate Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here we describe a photoswitchable iron(III) salen phosphate catalyst, which is able to catalyze the enantiodivergent oxidation of prochiral aryl alkyl sulfides to chiral aryl alkyl sulfoxides. The stable (S)&#8208;axial isomer of the catalyst produced enantioenriched sulfoxides with the (R)&#8208;configuration in up to 75% e.e., whereas the photoisomerized metastable (R)&#8208;axial isomer of the catalyst favored the formation of (S)&#8208;sulfoxides in up to 43% e.e. The maximum &#916;e.e. value obtained in the enantiodivergent sulfoxidation was 118%, which is identical to the maximum &#916;e.e. value that was measured in the enantiodivergent epoxidation of alkenes by a related recently described Mn1 catalyst. This iron&#8208;based catalyst broadens the scope of photoswitchable enantiodivergent catalysts and may use in the future to develop a photoswitchable catalytic system that can write digital information on a polymer chain in the form chiral sulfoxide functions.</dc:description>

         <title>Redox&#8208;Active Lewis Pairs Yield Diradicaloids and Enable Modular Control of the Diradical Character</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stable metal&#8208;free diradicaloids are fascinating compounds, typically based on covalent polycyclic or nitrogen&#8208;containing &#960;&#8208;conjugated frameworks. Unfortunately, their preparation and the modulation of their diradical character require substantial synthetic efforts. The present work introduces a synthetic approach to diradicaloids by the ease and modularity of Lewis pair formation. Binding redox&#8208;active bis(catecholato)silane Lewis acids to ditopic tetraoxolene Lewis bases yields adducts with varying spin ground states. Computational analyses disclose that the diradical character increases with the electron donor ability of the catechols and the electron accepting ability of the tetraoxolene. Hence, this protocol grants access to diradicaloids with rationally adjustable diradical character of high potential for numerous applications in a single step.</dc:description>

         <title>Styrene Oxide Isomerase&#8208;Catalyzed Meinwald Rearrangement in Cascade Biotransformations: Synthesis of Chiral and/or Natural Chemicals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Styrene oxide isomerase (SOI) catalyzes the Meinwald rearrangement of aryl epoxides to carbonyl compounds via a 1,2&#8208;trans&#8208;shift in a stereospecific manner. A number of cascade biotransformations with SOI&#8208;catalyzed epoxide isomerization as a key step have been developed to convert readily available substrates into valuable chiral chemicals. Cascade conversion of terminal or internal alkenes into chiral acids, alcohols or amines were achieved, which involved SOI&#8208;catalyzed enantio&#8208;retentive isomerization of terminal epoxides via 1,2&#8208;H shift, or internal epoxides via 1,2&#8208;methyl shift. SOI&#8208;involved cascades were also developed to convert racemic epoxides into chiral acids or amines via dynamic kinetic resolution. Additionally, combining SOI&#8208;catalyzed isomerization with enantioselective C&#8211;C bond forming enzymes enabled the synthesis of chiral amino acids or amino alcohols from racemic epoxides. Finally, integration of SOI&#8208;involved cascades with biosynthesis pathways allowed for the direct utilization of renewable substrates for the sustainable synthesis of high&#8208;value natural chemicals such as alcohols, acids and esters.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An atropisomerism of large cycloarylenes was studied using [n]cyclo&#8208;4,10&#8208;pyrenylenes (n = 6&#8211;21) as an illustrative example with two simple assumptions: (1) alternating configurations (R,S,R,S,,,) are thermodynamically most stable, and (2) three consecutive identical configurations (R,R,R or S,S,S) are prevented. Ni&#8208;mediated coupling of a 5,9&#8208;diiodopyrene gave a series of directly&#8208;linked cyclic pyrene oligomers in one&#8208;pot reaction. As&#8208;synthesized cyclic hexamer was assigned as an (R,S,S,R,R,S) structure, converted into an (R,S,R,S,R,S)&#8208;form upon heating. Cyclic heptamer consists of two types of C2 symmetric structures predicted from assumption (2), one of which was convergent to one another by heating. Three atropisomers of cyclic octamer were analyzed from the possible five candidates by means of 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, and the conversion process to (R,S,R,S,R,S,R,S) configurations upon heating was investigated. In total, according to two simple rules, the analysis of atropisomerism could be performed smoothly.</dc:description>

         <title>Antimicrobial Conjugated Oligoelectrolytes Containing Triphenylphosphonium Solubilizing Groups</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Conjugated oligoelectrolytes (COEs) are an emerging class of amphiphilic antimicrobial compounds with a modular molecular framework suitable for simple chemical derivatization. Here, a series of COE derivatives with a stilbene conjugated segment and triphenylphosphonium (TPP) pendant groups was designed and synthesized to understand how lipophilic cationic groups impact antimicrobial activity. In vitro evaluations against ESKAPE pathogens showed broad&#8208;spectrum activity towards multi&#8208;drug resistant (MDR) bacteria and mycobacteria, with TPP groups enhancing antimicrobial activity towards clinically&#8208;relevant Gram&#8208;negative strains compared to their ammonium analogues. We studied the interactions of DM6P, the most active TPP&#8208;COE compound, with various membrane assays. Treatment of bacterial cells with DM6P showed enhanced permeability of cell membranes without inducing significant bacterial resistance development. Moreover, DM6P eliminated 99.99% of methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphyloccocus aureus (MRSA) in an in vivo wound model. These results represent a promising chemical strategy for increasing the activity spectrum of membrane&#8208;active COE antibiotics to tackle challenging drug&#8208;resistant targets.</dc:description>

         <title>Emerging Trends in Closed&#8208;loop Recycling Polymers: Monomer Design and Catalytic Bulk Depolymerization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Plastics are indispensable materials in modern society; however, their extensive use has contributed to the depletion of finite natural resources and caused severe environmental issues. One end&#8208;of&#8208;use solution for plastics involves the chemical recycling of polymers back to monomers for repolymerization to virgin polymers without changing the material properties, allowing the establishment of a circular material economy. This concept focuses on the critical advantages of chemically recyclable polymers in terms of monomer design, material properties, and the feasibility of bulk depolymerization. The recyclability via bulk thermolysis of various polyesters, CO2&#8208;based polycarbonates, and polyacetals produced via ring&#8208;opening polymerization is highlighted through discussions regarding rational monomer design and efficient catalyst development. An outlook and perspective are provided to delineate the future challenges in the rational design of monomer and polymer structures that deliver the desired materials performance while being suitable for bulk thermolysis with high (de)polymerization activity and selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Precise Control of Dissipative Self&#8208;assembly by Light and Electricity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nature&#8208;inspired synthetic dissipative self&#8208;assemblies have attracted much attention recently. However, it remains a major challenge to achieve precise control over dissipative supramolecular assembly structures and functions of self&#8208;contained systems. Here we combine light and electricity as two clean, and spatiotemporally addressable fuels to provide precise control over the morphology for dissipative self&#8208;assembly of a perylene bisimide glycine (PBIg) building block in a self&#8208;contained solution. In this design, electrochemical oxidation provides the positive fuel to activate PBIg self&#8208;assembly while photoreduction supplies the negative fuel to deactivate the system for disassembly. Through programming the two counteracting fuels, we demonstrated the control of PBIg self&#8208;assembly into a variety of assembly morphologies in a self&#8208;contained system. In addition, by exerting light and electrical dual fuels simultaneously, we could create an active homeostasis exhibiting dynamic instability, leading to morphological change to asymmetric assemblies with curvatures. Such precise control over self&#8208;assembly of self&#8208;contained systems may find future applications in programming complex active materials as well as formulating pharmaceutical reagents with desired morphologies.</dc:description>

         <title>Bringing Machine&#8208;Learning Enhanced Quantum Chemistry and Microwave Spectroscopy to Conformational Landscape Exploration: the Paradigmatic Case of 4&#8208;Fluoro&#8208;Threonine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A combined experimental and theoretical study has been carried out on 4&#8208;fluoro&#8208;threonine, the only naturally occurring fluorinated amino acid. Fluorination of the methyl group significantly increases the conformational complexity with respect to the parent amino acid threonine. The conformational landscape has been characterized in great detail, with special attention given to the inter&#8208;conversion pathways between different conformers. This led to the identification of 13 stable low&#8208;energy minima. The equilibrium population of so many conformers produces a very complicated and congested rotational spectrum that could be assigned through a strategy that combines several levels of quantum chemical calculations with the principles of machine learning. Twelve conformers out of 13 could be experimentally characterized. The results obtained from the analysis of the intra&#8208;molecular interactions can be exploited to accurately model fluorine&#8208;substitution effects in biomolecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Activatable Fluorescent Probes Targeting Urokinase&#8208;Type Plasminogen Activator Receptor on the Cell Membrane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Urokinase&#8208;type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) is a glycolipid&#8208;anchored protein located on the cell surface that is implicated in the promotion of metastasis. New fluorescent probes for the detection of uPAR expression that feature a rapid &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; response are here reported. They consist of a donor&#8208;p&#8208;acceptor&#8208;based fluorophore conjugated with a uPAR&#8208;binding AE105 peptide. The resulting AE105&#8208;coupled uPAR&#8208;targeting probes are weakly emissive in aqueous buffer solutions; however, a fluorescence &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; signal is instantly triggered upon specific binding to uPAR (KD = 63.2 nM for P1 and 49.5 nM for P2), which restricts the rotational deactivation of the fluorophore. Applications of the probes were demonstrated in the imaging of uPAR overexpressed on the membrane of cancer cell and in a cell&#8208;based uPAR inhibitor assay.</dc:description>

         <title>Aqueous binders compatible with ionic liquid electrolyte for high&#8208;performance aluminum&#8208;ion batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The incompatibility of poly(vinylidene difluoride) (PVDF) with acidic ionic liquid electrolytes and the use of toxic and high&#8208;cost N&#8208;Methyl pyrrolidone (NMP) solvents hinder the wide application of aluminum&#8208;ion batteries (AIBs). In this work, sodium alginate (Na&#8208;Alg) is developed as an aqueous binder for the fabrication of graphite positive electrodes in AIBs. The compatibility of various binders with the ionic liquid electrolyte is evaluated, and interaction between various binders and graphite particles before and after cycling is compared and discussed. The results demonstrate that the well compatibility of Na&#8208;Alg in ionic liquids and its reasonable distribution on the graphite surface facilitate fast charge transfer and ion diffusion, reduce electrode polarization, and thus contributing to significantly improved cycling stability and rate capability of AIBs. This work provides a new insight into the development of low&#8208;cost, eco&#8208;friendly, and high&#8208;performance binders for AIBs.</dc:description>

The resultant molecules exhibited broad absorption in the range of 325 &#8208; 600 nm in solutions and in thin films the absorption range is 350 &#8208; 700 nm. These new conjugated small molecules showed low&#8208;lying HOMO energy levels (&#8722; 5.49 to &#8722; 5.50 eV), deep LUMO energy levels (&#8722;3.67 to &#8722;3.69 eV) and narrow bandgaps of (EgCV) ~ 1.79 eV. Appreciable&#8208;electron mobilities for compounds BT&#8208;IBT2 and BT2F&#8208;IBT3 were 4.56 &#215; 10&#8722;3 and 1.12 &#215; 10&#8722;3 cm2/Vs respectively obtained by space&#8208;charge limited current (SCLC) measurements. Additionally, excellent photocatalytic performances of BT&#8208;2T (6), BT2F&#8208;2T (10), BT&#8208;IT1, BT&#8208;IBT2 and BT2F&#8208;IBT3 for highly selective oxidation of thioanisole to desired sulfoxides under visible light irradiation were observed.</dc:description>

The resultant molecules exhibited broad absorption in the range of 325 - 600 nm in solutions and in thin films the absorption range is 350 - 700 nm. These new conjugated small molecules showed low-lying HOMO energy levels (&#8722; 5.49 to &#8722; 5.50 eV), deep LUMO energy levels (&#8722;3.67 to &#8722;3.69 eV) and narrow bandgaps of (EgCV) ~ 1.79 eV. Appreciable-electron mobilities for compounds BT-IBT2 and BT2F-IBT3 were 4.56 &#215; 10&#8722;3 and 1.12 &#215; 10&#8722;3 cm2/Vs respectively obtained by space-charge limited current (SCLC) measurements. Additionally, excellent photocatalytic performances of BT-2T (6), BT2F-2T (10), BT-IT1, BT-IBT2 and BT2F-IBT3 for highly selective oxidation of thioanisole to desired sulfoxides under visible light irradiation were observed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis of sterically encumbered alkaline&#8208;earth metal amides applying the in&#8208;situ Grignard reagent formation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Magnesium and calcium are too inert to deprotonate amines directly. For the synthesis of bulky amides alternative strategies are required and in the past, N&#8208;bound trialkylsilyl groups have been used to ease metalation reactions. The in&#8208;situ Grignard reagent formation in stirred suspensions of magnesium or calcium with hydryl halide and imine in THF allows the synthesis of a plethora of amides with bulky silyl&#8208;free substituents. Ball milling protocols partially favor competitive side reactions such as aza&#8208;pinacol coupling reactions. Calcium is the advantageous choice for the in&#8208;situ Grignard reagent formation and subsequent addition onto the imines yielding bulky calcium bis(amides) whereas the stronger reducing heavier alkaline&#8208;earth metals strontium and barium are less selective and hence, the aza&#8208;pinacol coupling reaction becomes competitive. Exemplary, the solid&#8208;state molecular structures of [(Et2O)Mg(N(Ph)(CHPh2)2] and [(Et2O)2Ca(N(Ph)(CHPh2)2] have been determined.</dc:description>

         <title>Reactivity of oxygen&#8208;bridged geminal Al/P and Si/P Frustrated Lewis Pairs towards heterocumulenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The two oxygen&#8208;bridged geminal Frustrated Lewis Pairs (FLP) tBu2P&#8211;O&#8211;AlBis2 (Bis = CH(SiMe3)2, 1) and tBu2P&#8211;O&#8211;Si(C2F5)3 (2) were reacted with the heterocumulenes PhNCO, PhOCN, PhNCS, CS2 and PhNSO as well as SO2. With isocyanate and cyanate, both 1 and 2, form addition products under formation of five&#8208;membered rings. With CS2, isothiocyanate and sulfinylaniline only 1 forms stable adducts, while 2 shows reactivity towards sulfinylaniline but the product decomposed after several minutes. The reaction of 1 with SO2 led to a partial cleavage of the P&#8208;O&#8208;Al and Al&#8208;C units, confirmed by X&#8208;ray diffraction studies of a complex aggregate. The reaction of 2 with SO2 affords the 1,2&#8208;addition product. All adducts were characterized by means of multinuclear NMR spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray crystallography and CHN analyses.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Properties of B4N4&#8208;Heteropentalenes Fused with Polycyclic Hydrocarbons</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hybrid molecules of &#960;&#8208;conjugated carbon rings and BN&#8208;heterocyclic rings (h&#8208;CBNs) fused with each other have been a rare class of compounds due to the limited availability of their synthetic methods. Here we report the synthesis of new h&#8208;CBNs (1, Figure 1d) featuring a B4N4&#8208;heteropentalene core and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon wings. Using 1,2&#8208;azaborinine derivatives as a building block, we developed a rational synthetic protocol that allows the formation of a B4N4 ring in a stepwise manner, resulting in the fully fused ABA&#8208;type triblock molecules. Thus, three derivatives of 1 bearing naphthalene (1Naph), anthracene (1Anth), or phenanthrene (1Phen) wings fused with the B4N4 core were synthesized and characterized. Among them, 1Phen which displays the highest triplet&#8208;state energy was found to serve a host material for phosphorescent OLED devices, for which a maximum external quantum efficiency of 13.7% was recorded. These findings may promote the synthesis of various types of h&#8208;CBNs aiming at new properties arising from the synergy of two different &#960;&#8208;electronic systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Quantum Yield of DNA Strand Breaks under Photoexcitation of a Molecular Ruby</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photodynamic therapy (PDT) used for treating cancer relies on the generation of highly reactive oxygen species, e.g. singlet oxygen 1O2, by light&#8208;induced excitation of a photosensitizer (PS) in the presence of molecular oxygen, inducing DNA damage in close proximity of the PS. Although many precious metal complexes have been explored as PS for PDT and received clinical approval, only recently, the potential of photoactive complexes of bio&#8208;essential metals as PS was discovered. Using the DNA origami technology that can absolutely quantify DNA strand break cross sections, we assessed the potential of the luminescent transition metal complex [Cr(ddpd)2]3+ (ddpd = N,N&#8242;&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;N,N&#8242;&#8208;dipyridine&#8208;2&#8208;ylpyridine&#8208;2,6&#8208;diamine) to damage DNA in an air&#8208;saturated aqueous environment upon low energy UV/Vis illumination. The quantum yield for strand breakage, i.e., the ratio of DNA strand breaks to the number of absorbed photons, was determined to 1 &#8211; 4%, indicating efficient transformation of photons into DNA strand breaks by [Cr(ddpd)2]3+.</dc:description>
