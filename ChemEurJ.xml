      <dc:description>Attacks using chemical warfare agents (CWAs,) including organophosphate soman (GD) and thioether mustard gas (HD) threaten both innocent civilians and military personnel, spawning significant research into catalytically&#8208;active composite textiles and new wearable protective gear. In this work, we report the first metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) fabric composite capable of both rapid catalytic hydrolysis and photo&#8208;oxidation of multiple chemical warfare agents (GD and HD) and their simulants. A simple template&#8208;free low&#8208;temperature synthesis yields new zirconium&#8208;porphyrin based nano&#8208;crystalline PCN&#8208;222 MOF&#8208;fabrics with adjustable MOF loading and robust mechanical adhesion on low&#8208;cost nonwoven polypropylene fibers. Importantly, we report the discovery of visible photo&#8208;activation of GD hydrolysis by a MOF&#8208;fabric, which is ascribed to oxidation at the active metal node site, significantly increasing the rate over that observed without illumination. Moreover, because the active MOF catalysts are uniformly displayed on the MOF&#8208;textile, the composite geometry enhances the kinetics of active agent photo&#8208;degradation relative to the same mass of MOF in common powder form. These results provide important new insights into the design of future materials and chemical systems to protect military, first&#8208;responders, and civilians upon exposure to complex chemical toxins.</dc:description>

      <title>Improving the Stability of Maleimide&#8208;Thiol Conjugation for Drug Targeting</title>
      <dc:description>Maleimides are essential compounds for drug conjugation reactions  via  thiols to antibodies, peptides and other targeting units. However, one main drawback is the occurrence of thiol exchange reactions with e.g. glutathione resulting in loss of the targeting ability. A new strategy to overcome such retro&#8208;Michael exchange processes of maleimide&#8208;thiol conjugates by stabilization of the thiosuccinimide  via  a transcyclization reaction is presented.

      <dc:description>
Metal&#8211;metal cooperation plays a crucial role in synergistic catalysis including C&#8722;C bond coupling. This work reports dynamic Pd/Cu assemblies as models to study individual steps of Sonogashira coupling. This study reveals the importance of rearrangements of the highly dynamic multimetallic assemblies (represented as constellations in this cover image) at the various steps of alkyne activation and transmetalation.

      <dc:description>
&#8220;Jumpy&#8221; five&#8208;membered carbocycles in carbaporphyrinoids: Dicarba[26]hexachlorins(1.1.1.1.1.1.) with built&#8208;in cyclopentenyl and cyclopentadienyl moieties can adopt two essential conformations: dumbbell&#8208;shaped and rectangular convoluted respectively with regular and doubly inverted carbocyclic rings. The transformation between conformers has been controlled by an external factor including protonation. A cycle created by six monkeys holding hands, two of which easily rotate similarly as carbocyclic moieties, illustrates the observed conformational rearrangements in dicarbahexachlorins.

Our team used a stepwise approach with a discrete Co&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; &#8220;superatom&#8221; building block serving as the monomer&lt;/i&gt;.&#8221; Read more about the story behind the cover in the Cover Profile and about the research itself on page&#8197;&#9642;&#9642;&#8197;ff.

      <title>Probing the Origin of Adaptive Aromaticity in 16&#8208;Valence&#8208;Electron Metallapentalenes</title>
      <dc:description>
16&#8208;Valence&#8208;electron metallapentalenes are among the few adaptive aromatic compounds, which are aromatic in both the S0 and T1 states. The origin of adaptive aromaticity had been elusive to our knowledge. Herein, we propose a competent rationalization of how adaptive aromaticity is achieved. The studied candidates have been supplemented to include not only the first&#8208;reported osmapentalene but also isoelectronic ruthenapentalenes and iridapentalenes, with an extended scope of ligands. Strong &#960;&#8208; or &#963;&#8208;donor ligands can promote the formation of adaptive aromaticity. More information can be found in the Full Paper by J.&#8197;Zhu, M.&#8197;Sol&#224;, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202001830).

      <title>Stepwise Assembly of an Electroactive Framework from a Co6S8 Superatomic Metalloligand and Cuprous Iodide Building Units</title>
      <dc:description>
A double&#8208;cluster framework comprising octahedral Co6S8 superatoms, tetrahedral Cu4I4 clusters, and 1,3,5&#8208;triaza&#8208;7&#8208;phosphaadamantane (PTA) bifunctional linkers was prepared using a stepwise approach. The synthesis relies on the use of a stable, pre&#8208;formed Co6S8(PTA)6 superatomic&#8208;metalloligand, which can undergo further coordination&#8208;driven assembly in the presence of CuI. The resulting three&#8208;dimensional coordination polymer exhibits reversible redox behavior in the solid state. The artwork portrays a pair of star clusters known as the Double Cluster, which resides in the northern part of the constellation Perseus. The star clusters are 7500 light years from Earth and each contain 300 to 400 stars that can be viewed using a pair of binoculars. Illustration by Frank A. Martinez.

      <title>Selective Activation of Aromatic Aldehydes Promoted by Dispersion Interactions: Steric and Electronic Factors of a &#960;&#8208;Pocket within Cage&#8208;Shaped Borates for Molecular Recognition</title>
      <dc:description>Selective bond formations are one of the most important reactions in organic synthesis. In the Lewis acid&#8211;mediated electrophile reactions of carbonyls, the selective formation of a carbonyl&#8211;acid complex has played a critical role in determining selectivity, which is based on the difference in the coordinative interaction between the carbonyl and Lewis acid center. Although this strategy has attained progress in selective bond formations, the discrimination between similarly sized aromatic and aliphatic carbonyls that have no functional anchors to strongly interact with the metal center still remains a challenging issue. In this manuscript, we alternatively focus on the molecular recognition driven by dispersion forces within some aromatic moieties. We designed a Lewis acid catalyst with a&#160;&#960; &#8208;space cavity, which was referred to as a&#160; &#960;  &#8208;pocket  , as the recognition site for aromatic carbonyls. The cage&#8208;shaped borates&#160;  1  B with various&#160; &#960; &#8208;pockets demonstrated significant chemoselectivity for aromatic aldehydes&#160;  3b  &#8211;  f  &#160;over the aliphatic&#160;  3a  &#160;in the competitive hetero Diels&#8208;Alder reactions. The effectiveness of our catalysts was also evidenced by intramolecular recognition of the aromatic carbonyl within a dicarbonyl substrate. The mechanistic and theoretical studies demonstrated that the selective activation of aromatic substrates is driven by the preorganized step with a larger dispersion force rather than the rate&#8208;determining step of the C&#8211;C bond formation, and this likely contributes to the preferred activation of aromatic substrates over aliphatic ones.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Accumulation and aggregation of the intrinsically disordered protein &#945;&#8208;synuclein (&#945;&#8208;Syn) into amyloid fibrils are hallmarks of a series of heterogeneous neurodegenerative disorders, known as synucleinopathies and most notably Parkinson&#8217;s disease (PD). The crucial role of &#945;&#8208;Syn aggregation in PD makes it an attractive target for the development of disease&#8208;modifying therapeutics that would inhibit &#945;&#8208;Syn aggregation or disrupt its preformed fibrillar assemblies. To that end, we have designed and synthesized two naphthoquinone&#8208;dopamine&#8208;based hybrid small molecules, NQDA and Cl&#8208;NQDA, and demonstrated their ability to inhibit in vitro amyloid formation by &#945;&#8208;Syn using ThT assay, CD, TEM, and Congo red birefringence. Moreover, these hybrid molecules efficiently disassembled preformed fibrils of &#945;&#8208;Syn into non&#8208;toxic species, as evident from LUV leakage assay. NQDA and Cl&#8208;NQDA were found to have low cytotoxicity and they attenuated the toxicity induced by &#945;&#8208;Syn towards SH&#8208;SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. NQDA was found to efficiently cross an in vitro human blood&#8208;brain barrier model. These naphthoquinone&#8208;dopamine based derivatives can be an attractive scaffold for therapeutic design towards PD.</dc:description>

This operationally simple method provides  &#946;  &#8208;trifluoromethyl&#8208;substituted  &#947;  &#8208;lactams with a tetrasubstitued carbon as a single diastereomer.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <dc:description>
Visible&#8208;light&#8208;photocatalyzed methods employed in synthetic transformations present attractive properties, such as environmentally friendly, safety, availability and excellent functional group tolerance. Research on the visible&#8208;light photocatalytic incorporation of the trifluoromethyl moiety into organic substrates has contributed to a clear evolution of the field of photocatalysis. Although this particular area is constantly evolving and has been reviewed, a number of seminal and significant photocatalytic trifluoromethylation examples have been reported in the last five years. These recent advances are here presented and discussed. For more details see the Review by A. Postigo et&#8197;al. on page&#8197;11065&#8197;ff.

      <title>Insights in LiAlH4 Catalysed Imine Hydrogenation</title>
      <dc:description>Commercial LiAlH4 can be used in catalytic quantities in the hydrogenation of imines to amines with H2. Combined experimental and theoretical investigations give deeper insight in the mechanism and identifies the most likely catalytic cycle. Activity is lost when Li in LiAlH4 is exchanged for Na or K. Exchanging Al for B or Ga also led to dramatically reduced activities. This indicates a heterobimetallic mechanism in which cooperation between Li and Al is crucial. Potential intermediates on the catalytic pathway have been isolated from reactions of MAlH4 (M = Li, Na, K) and different imines. Depending on the imine, double, triple or quadruple imine insertion has been observed. Prolonged reaction of LiAlH4 with PhC(H)=NtBu led to a side&#8208;reaction and gave the double insertion product LiAlH2[N]2 ([N] = N(tBu)CH2Ph) which at higher temperature reacts further by ortho&#8208;metallation of the Ph ring. A DFT study led to a number of conclusions. The most likely catalyst for hydrogenation of PhC(H)=NtBu with LiAlH4 is LiAlH2[N]2. Insertion of a third imine via a heterobimetallic transition state has a barrier of +23.2 kcal/mol (DH). The rate&#8208;determining step is hydrogenolysis of LiAlH[N]3 with H2 with a barrier of +29.2 kcal/mol. In agreement with experiment, replacing Li for Na (or K) and Al for B (or Ga) led to higher calculated barriers. Also, the AlH4&#713; anion showed very high barriers. Calculations support the experimentally observed effects of the imine substituents at C and N: the lowest barriers are calculated for imines with aryl&#8208;substituents at C and alkyl&#8208;substituents at N.</dc:description>

      <title>Tunable Synthesis of Hierarchical Yolk/double&#8208;shelled SiOx@TiO2@C Nanospheres for High&#8208;performance Lithium&#8211;ion Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>We report the preparation of unique hierarchical yolk/double&#8208;shelled SiO  x  @TiO  2  @C nanospheres with different voids by a facile sol&#8211;gel method combined with carbon coating. In preparation process, SiO  x  nanosphere is used as a hard template. Etch time of SiO  x  yolk affects the morphology and electrochemical performance of SiO  x  @TiO  2  @C. With the increase in etch time, the yolk/double&#8208;shelled SiO  x  @TiO  2  @C with 15 and 30 nm voids and the TiO  2  @C hollow nanospheres are obtained. The yolk/double&#8208;shelled SiO  x  @TiO  2  @C nanospheres exhibit a remarkable lithium&#8211;ion batteries&#8217; performance as anodes, including high lithium storage capacity, outstanding rate capability, good reversibility, and stable long&#8208;term cycle life. The unique structure can accommodate the large volume change of the SiO  x  yolk, provide a unique buffering space for the discharge/charge processes, improve the structural stability of the electrode material during repeated Li  +  intercalation/deintercalation processes, and enhance the cycling stability. The SiO  x  @TiO  2  @C with 30 nm void space exhibits a high discharge specific capacity of ~1195.4 mA h g  &#8722;1  at the current density of 0.1 A g  &#8722;1  after 300 cycles and ~701.1 mA h g  &#8722;1  at 1 A g  &#8722;1  for over 800&#160;cycles. &#160; These results suggest that the proposed particle architecture is promising and may have potential applications in improving various high performance anode materials.</dc:description>

      <title>Electron&#8208;Rich Phenothiazine Congeners and Beyond: Synthesis and Electronic Properties of Isomeric Dithieno[1,4]thiazines</title>
      <dc:description>
Structure&#8211;property relationships: Four isomeric dithieno[1,4]thiazines, thieno congeners of phenothiazines, are synthesized by inter&#8208;intra&#8208;molecular Buchwald&#8211;Hartwig coupling. Their electronic properties open new avenues as donor systems for molecular electronics.







Abstract
A series of isomeric dithieno[1,4]thiazines is accessible through an intermolecular&#8211;intramolecular Buchwald&#8211;Hartwig amination starting from dihalodithienyl sulfides. The electronic properties of dithieno[1,4]thiazine isomers differ conspicuously over a broad range depending on the thiophene&#8211;thiazine anellation: a large cathodic (340&#8197;mV) or an anodic shift (130&#8197;mV) of the redox potentials relative to corresponding phenothiazines is possible. Structure&#8211;property relationships of the dithieno[1,4]thiazine constitution derived from DFT calculations and cyclic voltammetry not only reveal increased electron density but also different delocalization of the radical cations that determines the electrochemical properties significantly. In addition, photophysical properties (absorption and emission) qualify dithieno[1,4]thiazines as promising substitutes of phenothiazine and beyond due to increased tunable electron richness.

This method displays good regioselectivity and high efficiency. Furthermore, as a proof of concept for its biological applications, stapled peptides without additional fluorophore 9a and 9b were constructed for cell imaging study.

      <title>Metal&#8208;free Twofold Electrochemical C&#8208;H Amination of Activated Arenes: Application to Medicinally Relevant Precursor Synthesis</title>
      <dc:description>The efficient production of many medicinally or synthetically important starting materials suffers from wasteful or toxic precursors for the synthesis. In particular, the aromatic non&#8208;protected primary amine function represents a versatile synthetic precursor, but its synthesis typically requires toxic oxidizing agents and transition metal catalysts. The twofold electrochemical amination of activated benzene derivatives via Zincke intermediates provides an alternative sustainable strategy for the formation of new C&#8211;N bonds of high synthetic value. As a proof of concept, we use our approach to generate a benzoxazinone scaffold that gained attention as a starting structure against castrate&#8208;resistance prostate cancer. Further improvement of the structure led to significantly increased cancer cell line toxicity. Thus, exploiting environmentally benign electrooxidation, we present a new versatile and powerful method based on direct C&#8211;H activation that is applicable for e.g. the production of medicinally relevant compounds.</dc:description>

      <title>A Unified Framework for Understanding Nucleophilicity and Protophilicity in the SN2/E2 Competition</title>
      <dc:description>The concepts of nucleophilicity and protophilicity are fundamental and ubiquitous in chemistry. A case in point is bimolecular nucleophilic substitution (SN2) and base&#8208;induced elimination (E2). A Lewis base acting as a strong nucleophile is needed for SN2 reactions, while Lewis base acting as a strong protophile (i.e.&#160;base) is required for E2 reactions. A complicating factor is, however, the fact that a good nucleophile is often a strong protophile. Nevertheless, a sound, physical model that explains, in a transparent manner, when an electron&#8208;rich Lewis base acts as a protophile or a nucleophile, that is not just phenomenological, is currently lacking in the literature. To address this fundamental question, we have explored the potential energy surfaces of the SN2 and E2 reactions of X&#8211;&#160;+ C2H5Y model systems with X, Y = F, Cl, Br, I, and At, using relativistic density functional theory at ZORA&#8208;OLYP/TZ2P. These explorations have yielded a consistent overview of reactivity trends over a wide range in reactivity and pathways. Activation strain analyses of these reactions reveal the factors that determine the shape of the potential energy surfaces and hence govern the propensity of the Lewis base to act as a nucleophile or protophile. We introduce the concepts of "characteristic distortivity" and "transition state acidity" of a reaction, which have the potential to enable chemists to better understand and design reactions for&#160;synthesis.</dc:description>

Activation strain analyses of these reactions reveal the factors that determine the shape of the potential energy surfaces and hence govern the propensity of the Lewis base to act as a nucleophile or protophile. We introduce the concepts of "characteristic distortivity" and "transition state acidity" of a reaction, which have the potential to enable chemists to better understand and design reactions for&#160;synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>EBC&#8208;232 and 323: A Structural Conundrum Necessitating Unification of Five In Silico Prediction and Elucidation Methods
</title>
      <dc:description>
Solve me if you can: Structurally unique halimanes EBC&#8208;232 and 323 invoked deployment of no less than 4 in silico NMR elucidation and prediction methods to arrive at two structures that also met chemical observations of interconversion.







Abstract
Structurally unique halimanes EBC&#8208;232 and EBC&#8208;323, isolated from the Australian rainforest plant Croton insularis, proved considerably difficult to elucidate. The two diastereomers, which consist an unusual oxo&#8208;6,7&#8208;spiro ring system fused to a dihydrofuran, were solved by unification and consultation of five in silico NMR elucidation and prediction methods [i.e., ACDLabs, olefin strain energy (OSE), DP4, DU8+ and TD DFT CD]. Structure elucidation challenges of this nature are prime test case examples for empowering future AI learning in structure elucidation.

      <title>Three&#8208;dimensional Cubic and Dice&#8208;like Microstructures of Higher Fullerene C78 with Enhanced Photoelectrochemical and Photoluminescence Properties</title>
      <dc:description>The single&#8208;crystal micro/nanostructures of fullerene species, namely C  60  and C  70  , have been previously studied, but studies on the morphology and properties of higher fullerenes have rarely been reported due to the limited amount of samples and their ellipsoidal isomeric structures. Herein, we report the formation of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) micro&#8208;cubes and micro&#8208;dice of a higher fullerene (C  78  ) via a facile liquid&#8208;liquid interfacial precipitation (LLIP) method. The micro&#8208;cubes were prepared by regulating the concentration of C  78  in trimethylbenzene (TMB) and the volume ratio of TMB and isopropanol. A simple handshaking process transformed the micro&#8208;cubes into micro&#8208;dice with an open&#8208;hole on each crystal face. X&#8208;ray diffraction and Fourier&#8208;transform infrared spectroscopic studies revealed a simple cubic unit cell with a lattice constant of 10.6 &#197; and intercalated TMB molecules in both crystals. The C  78  cubic and dice&#8208;like microstructures exhibited enhanced photoelectrochemical and photoluminescence properties compared with pristine C  78  powder, indicating their potential applications as photodetectors and photoelectric devices.</dc:description>

      <title>Hierarchical carbon nanowires/Ni@MnO2 nanocomposites for high&#8208;performance asymmetric supercapacitors</title>
      <dc:description>In this work, a rational 3D hierarchical carbon cloth/nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon nanowires/Ni@MnO  2  (CC/N&#8208;CNWs/Ni@MnO  2  ) nanocomposite electrode is successfully designed and prepared by electrodeposition. The   N&#8208;C nanowire  s derived from polypyrrole (PPy) nanowires on the carbon cloth possess open framework structure, which greatly increases the contact area between the electrode and electrolyte and provides short diffusion paths. The incorporation of the Ni layer between the N&#8208;CNWs and MnO  2  is beneficial for significantly enhancing the electrical conductivity and boosting the fast charge transfer as well as improving the charge&#8208;collection capacity. Thus, the as&#8208;prepared 3D hierarchical CC/N&#8208;CNWs/Ni@MnO  2  electrode exhibits a higher specific capacitance of 571.4 F g  &#8208;1  compared with those of CC/N&#8208;CNWs@MnO  2  (311  F g  &#8208;1  ), CC/Ni@MnO  2  (196.6 F g  &#8208;1  ) and CC@MnO  2  (186.1 F g  &#8208;1  ) at 1 A g  &#8208;1  and remarkable rate capability (367.5 F g  &#8208;1  at 10 A g  &#8208;1  ). Moreover, the asymmetric supercapacitors constructed using CC/N&#8208;CNWs/Ni@MnO  2  as a cathode material and activated carbon (AC) as an anode material deliver an impressive energy density of 36.4 Wh kg  &#8208;1  at the power density of 900 W kg  &#8208;1  and a good cycling life (72.8% capacitance retention after 3500 cycles). This study paves a low&#8208;cost and simple way to design a hierarchical nanocomposite electrode with large surface area and superior electrical conductivity, which holds a wide application prospect in high&#8208;performance supercapacitors.</dc:description>

      <title>From Distinct Metallopeptoids to Self&#8208;Assembled Supramolecular Architectures</title>
      <dc:description>The construction of synthetic protein mimics is a central goal in chemistry, that can be addressed by the self&#8208;assembly of synthetic biomimetic sequences into supramolecular structures. Obtaining different 3D structures via a simple sequence modification, however, is still challenging. Herein we present the design and synthesis of biomimetic architectures ,  via  the self&#8208;assembly of distinct copper&#8208;peptoid duplexes. We demonstrate that changing only one non&#8208;coordinating side&#8208;chain within peptoids &#8211; sequence&#8208;specific N&#8208;substituted glycine oligomers &#8211; leads to different supramolecular structures. Four peptoid trimers incorporating 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine and pyridine ligands, and a non&#8208;coordinating, but rather a structure&#8208;directed bulky group were synthesized, and their solutions were treated with Cu  2+  in a 1:1 ratio. Single crystal X&#8208;ray analysis of the products revealed the self&#8208;assembly of each peptoid into a metallopeptoid duplex, followed by the self&#8208;assembly of multiple duplexes and their packing into a three&#8208;dimensional supramolecular architecture  via  hydrogen bonding and p &#8208; p interactions . Tuning the non&#8208;coordinating side&#8208;chain enables to regulate both the final structure being either a tightly packed helical rod or a nano&#8208;channel , and the pore width of the nano&#8208;channels. Importantly, all the metallopeptoids structures are stable in aqueous solution as verified by Cryo&#8208;TEM measurements and supported by UV&#8208;Vis and EPR spectroscopies and by ESI&#8208;MS analysis. Thus we could also demonstrate the selective recognition abilities of the nano&#8208; channels towards glycerol.</dc:description>

      <title>May Trifluoromethylation and Polymerization of Styrene Occur from a Perfluorinated Persistent Radical (PPFR)?</title>
      <dc:description>The radical polymerization of styrene (St) initiated by a trifluoromethyl radical generated from a perfluorinated highly branched persistent radical (PPFR) is presented with an isolated yield above 70%.

      <title>Supramolecular Paradigm for Capture and Co&#8208;Precipitation of Gold(III) Coordination Complexes</title>
      <dc:description>A new supramolecular paradigm is presented for reliable capture and co&#8208;precipitation of haloauric acids (HAuX  4  ) from organic solvents or water. Two classes of acyclic organic compounds act as complementary receptors (tectons) by forming two sets of directional non&#8208;covalent interactions, (a) hydrogen bonding between amide (or amidinium) NH residues and the electronegative X ligands on the AuX  4  &#8208;  , and (b) electrostatic stacking of the electron deficient Au center against the face of an aromatic surface. X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis of four co&#8208;crystal structures reveals the additional common feature of proton bridged carbonyls as a new and predictable supramolecular design element that creates one&#8208;dimensional polymers linked by very short hydrogen bonds (CO&#183;&#183;&#183;OC distance &lt; 2.5 &#197;). Two other co&#8208;crystal structures show that the amidinium&#8208;&#960;&#183;&#183;&#183;XAu interaction will reliably engage AuX  4  &#8208;  with high directionality. These acyclic compounds are very attractive as co&#8208;precipitation agents within new &#8220;green&#8221; gold recovery processes. They also have high potential as tectons for controlled self&#8208;assembly or co&#8208;crystal engineering of haloaurate composites. More generally, the supramolecular paradigm will facilitate the design of next&#8208;generation receptors or tectons with high affinity for precious metal square planar coordination complexes for use in advanced materials, nanotechnology, or medicine.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A new supramolecular paradigm is presented for reliable capture and co&#8208;precipitation of haloauric acids (HAuX  4  ) from organic solvents or water. Two classes of acyclic organic compounds act as complementary receptors (tectons) by forming two sets of directional non&#8208;covalent interactions, (a) hydrogen bonding between amide (or amidinium) NH residues and the electronegative X ligands on the AuX  4  &#8208;  , and (b) electrostatic stacking of the electron deficient Au center against the face of an aromatic surface. X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis of four co&#8208;crystal structures reveals the additional common feature of proton bridged carbonyls as a new and predictable supramolecular design element that creates one&#8208;dimensional polymers linked by very short hydrogen bonds (CO&#183;&#183;&#183;OC distance &amp;lt; 2.5 &#197;). Two other co&#8208;crystal structures show that the amidinium&#8208;&#960;&#183;&#183;&#183;XAu interaction will reliably engage AuX  4  &#8208;  with high directionality. These acyclic compounds are very attractive as co&#8208;precipitation agents within new &#8220;green&#8221; gold recovery processes. They also have high potential as tectons for controlled self&#8208;assembly or co&#8208;crystal engineering of haloaurate composites. More generally, the supramolecular paradigm will facilitate the design of next&#8208;generation receptors or tectons with high affinity for precious metal square planar coordination complexes for use in advanced materials, nanotechnology, or medicine.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Strain&#8208;Induced Nucleophilic Ring Opening of Donor&#8208;Acceptor Cyclopropenes for Synthesis of Monosubstituted Succinic Acid Derivatives</title>
      <dc:description>1,2,3&#8208;Trisubstituted donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropenes (DACPs) generated  in situ  from enoldiazo compounds react with nucleophiles to form &#945;&#8208;substituted succinic acid derivatives in high yields. Initial dirhodium(II) carboxylate catalysis rapidly converts enoldiazo&#8208;acetates or &#8208;acetamides to DACPs that undergo catalyst&#8208;free Favorskii ring opening with amines, and also with anilines, alcohols, and thiols, when facilitated by catalytic amounts of DMAP. This methodology provides easy access to mixed esters and amides of monosubstituted succinic acids, including derivatives of naturally occurring compounds. It also affords dihydrazide, dihydroxamic acid, and diamide derivatives, as well as &#945;&#8208;substituted tetrahydropyridazine&#8208;3,6&#8208;diones in high yields. Attempts to generate optically enriched DACPs were not successful because their populations having the  R  and  S  configurations formed with a chiral dirhodium catalyst are quite similar, and the loss of enantiocontrol likely originates from the DACP ring forming step which is reversible with its intermediate metal carbene.</dc:description>

      <title>Surface engineering strategy using urea to improve the rate performance of Na2Ti3O7 in Na&#8208;ion batteries</title>
      <dc:description>Na2Ti3O7 (NTO) is considered a promising anode material for Na&#8208;ion batteries due to its layered structure with an open framework and low and safe average operating voltage of 0.3 V vs. Na+/Na. However, its poor electronic conductivity needs to be addressed to make this material attractive for practical applications among other anode choices. Here, we report a safe, controllable and affordable method using urea that significantly improves the rate performance of NTO by producing surface defects (e.g. oxygen vacancies and hydroxyl groups) and the secondary phase Na2Ti6O13. A comprehensive study using a combination of diffraction, microscopic, spectroscopic and electrochemical techniques supported by computational studies based on DTF calculations, was carried out to understand the effects of this treatment on the surface, chemistry and electronic and charge storage properties of NTO. This study underscores the benefits of using urea as a strategy for enhancing the charge storage properties of NTO and thus, unfolding the potential of this material in practical energy storage applications.</dc:description>

      <title>Methylene Bridging Effect on the Structures, Lewis Acidities and Optical Properties of Semi&#8208;Planar Triarylboranes</title>
      <dc:description>Two straightforward synthetic methods towards semi&#8208;planar triarylboranes with two aryl rings connected by a methylene bridge have been developed.

      <title>Divergent Synthesis of Bioactive Dithiodiketopiperazine Natural Products Based on a Double C(sp3)&#8211;H Activation Strategy</title>
      <dc:description>This article provides a detailed report of our efforts to synthesize the dithiodiketopiperazine (DTP) natural products (&#8211;)&#8208;epicoccin G and (&#8211;)&#8208;rostratin A using a double C(sp  3  )&#8211;H activation strategy. The strategy&#8217;s viability was first established on a model system lacking the C8/C8&#8217; alcohols. Then, an efficient stereoselective route including an organocatalytic epoxidation was secured to access a key bis&#8208;triflate substrate. This bis&#8208;triflate served as the functional handles for the key transformation of the synthesis: a double C(sp  3  )&#8211;H activation. The successful double activation opened access to a common intermediate for both natural products in high overall yield and on a multigram scale. After several unsuccessful attempts, this intermediate was efficiently converted to (&#8211;)&#8208;epicoccin G and to the more challenging (&#8211;)&#8208;rostratin A via suitable oxidation/reduction and protecting group sequences, and via a final sulfuration that occurred in good yield and high diastereoselectivity. These efforts culminated in the synthesis of (&#8211;)&#8208;epicoccin G and (&#8211;)&#8208;rostratin A in high overall yields (19.6% over 14 steps and 12.7% over 17 steps, respectively), with the latter being obtained on a 500 mg scale. Toxicity assessments of these natural products and several analogues (including the newly synthesized epicoccin K) in the leukemia cell line K562 confirmed the importance of the disulfide bridge for activity and identified dianhydrorostratin A as a 20x more potent analogue.</dc:description>

      <title>A simple method for synthesizing highly active amorphous iridium oxide for water&#8208;oxidation under acidic conditions</title>
      <dc:description>Water splitting for hydrogen production has been recognized as a promising approach to store sustainable energy. The performance of this method is limited by oxygen&#8208;evolution reaction.

      <title>Multidisciplinary Preclinical Investigations on Three Oxamniquine Analogues as Novel Drug Candidates for Schistosomiasis</title>
      <dc:description>Schistosomiasis is a disease of poverty affecting millions of people. Praziquantel (PZQ), with its strengths and weaknesses, is the only treatment available. We previously reported findings on 3 lead compounds derived from oxamniquine (OXA), an old antischistosomal drug: ferrocene&#8208;containing (Fc&#8208;CH  2  &#8208;OXA), ruthenocene&#8208;containing (Rc&#8208;CH  2  &#8208;OXA) and benzene&#8208;containing (Ph&#8208;CH  2  &#8208;OXA) OXA derivatives. These derivatives showed excellent  in vitro  activity against both  Schistosoma mansoni  larvae and adult worms and  S. haematobium  adult worms, and  in vivo  activity against  S. mansoni  . Encouraged by these promising results, we conducted additional in&#8208;depth preclinical studies and report in this investigation on metabolic stability studies,  in vivo  studies on  S. haematobium  and juvenile  S. mansoni  , computational simulations, and formulation development. Molecular dynamics simulations supported the  in vitro  results on the target protein. Though all three compounds were poorly stable within an acidic environment, they were only slightly cleared in the  in vitro  liver model. This is likely the reason as to why the promising  in vitro  activity did not translate to  in vivo  activity on  S. haematobium  . This limitation could not be saved by the formulation of lipid nanocapsules as an intent to improve the  in vivo  activity. Further studies should focus on increasing the compound&#8217;s bioavailability, in order to reach an active concentration in the parasite&#8217;s microenvironment.</dc:description>

The solid&#8208;state molecular structure as well as the optical and magnetic properties of HAT(CN)6&#183;&#8722;  are studied. The formation of HAT(CN)6&#183;&#8722;  in  1&#8211;4  leads to the appearance of new bands in the visible range&#160;at 694 and 740 nm. The HAT(CN)6&#183;&#8722;  radical anions have spin state  S  = 1/2 and are packed in one&#8208;dimensional stacks containing the {HAT(CN)6&#183;&#8722;}2  dimers alternated with weaker interacting pairs of HAT(CN)6&#183;&#8722;  in  1  and nearly isolated &#160;{HAT(CN)  6&#183;&#8722;}2  dimers in  2. The {HAT(CN)  6&#183;&#8722;}2  dimers are diamagnetic in  1&#160;but they effectively mediate one&#8208;dimensional antiferromagnetic coupling of spins within the stacks with median exchange interaction of  J/kB  = &#8722;80\K. The&#160;behavior of salt  2  is described by a singlet&#8211;triplet model for the {HAT(CN)6&#183;&#8722;}2  dimers with an energy gap of 434&#177;7 K.&#160; Salts  3  and  4  contain isolated stacks of alternated HAT(CN)6&#183;&#8722;  and CV+  ions, and in this case, nearly paramagnetic behaviour is observed with Weiss temperatures of &#8722;1 and &#8722;7K. Narrow Lorentzian EPR signals with  g=2.0033&#8211;2.0039 were found for HAT(CN)6&#183;&#8722;&#160;but&#160;g  &#8208;factor shifts to 1.9964 in solution. The electronic structure of HAT(CN)6&#183;&#8722;  is analyzed, showing a Jahn&#8211;Teller distortion of the radical anion that reduces the symmetry from  D3h  to  Cs  and splits the initially degenerated LUMOs.</dc:description>

      <title>Electrochemical Reduction of CO2 at Coinage Metal Nanodendrites in Aqueous Ethanolamine</title>
      <dc:description>Electrocatalytic reduction of CO  2  into usable chemicals is a promising path to address climate change and energy challenges. Herein, we demonstrate to synthesize of unique coinage metal (Cu, Ag and Au) nanodendrites (NDs) via a facile galvanic replacement reaction (GRR) process as the effective electrocatalysts for the reduction of CO  2  in the ethanolamine (EA) solution. Each metal ND surface was directly grown on glassy carbon (GC) substrates from the mixture of Zn dust and the respective precursor solution. The electrocatalytic activities of the synthesized ND surfaces&#160; were optimized for CO  2  reduction in the EA solution by varying their composition. It was determined that a 0.05 mole fraction of EA exhibited the highest catalytic activity for all of the metal NDs. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) techniques showed that metal NDs electrodes possessed higher current densities, low onset potentials and low charge&#8208;transfer resistances for CO  2  reduction as compared to their smooth polycrystalline electrode counterparts, indicating improved&#160; CO  2  reduction catalytic activity.. It was determined, using FTIR and NMR spectroscopy, that formate was produced as a result of the CO2 reduction.</dc:description>

      <title>Phosphorescent trinuclear Pt&#8208;Ir&#8208;Pt complexes: Insight into photophysical, electrochemical properties and interaction with guanine nucleobase</title>
      <dc:description>In this work, we focus on the comparative photophysical and electrochemical properties of two isomeric heterotrinuclear platinum(II)&#8208;iridium(III)&#8208;platinum(II) complexes (3, 6) and&#160; four intermediate isomeric homonuclear cyclometalated iridium(III) complexes (1 &#8208; 2, 4 &#8208; 5). The isomerisation originates from the positional change of aldehyde moiety, CH  2  &#8208;di&#8208;2&#8208;picolylamine and Pt&#8208;di&#8208;2&#8208;picolylamine unit that remain appended at cyclometalated or ancillary ligand end. The interaction with 5&#8242;&#8208;GMP with trinuclear complexes 3 and 6 shows that platinum centres appended with cyclometalated ligand in 3 facilitates the binding of two 5&#8242;&#8208;GMP unit/Pt(II) centre in preference to single unit/Pt(II) centre in 6. The 1:2 vs. 1:1 (Pt(II):5&#8217;&#8208;GMP) binding is probably due to the convenient disposal of Pt&#8208;di&#8208;2&#8208;picolylamine unit towards different planes in 3.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic frameworks/Zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (MOFs/ZIFs) and their post&#8208;synthesis modified nanostructures, such as oxides, hydroxides and carbons have generated significant interest for electrocatalytic reactions. In this work, we report a high and durable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance from bimetallic Zn100&#8208;xCox&#8208;ZIF samples directly, without carrying out high&#8208;temperature calcination and/or carbonization. ZIFs can be reproducibly and readily synthesized in large scale at ambient conditions. The bimetallic ZIFs show a systematic and gradually improved OER activity with increasing cobalt concentration. A further increase in OER activity is evidenced in ZIF&#8208;67 polyhedrons with controlled particle size of &lt;200 nm among samples of different sizes between 50 nm and 2 &#181;m. Building on this, a significantly enhanced, &gt;50%, OER activity is obtained in ZIF&#8208;67/carbon black, which shows a low&#8208;overpotential of ~320 mV in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte. Such activity is comparable or better to numerous MOFs/ZIFs derived electrocatalysts. The optimized ZIF&#8208;67 sample also exhibits increased activity and durability over 24 h, which is attributed to in&#8208;situ developed active cobalt&#8208;oxide/oxyhydroxide related nanophase.</dc:description>

      <title>High Energy Proton Beam&#8208;Induced Polymerization/Oxygenation of Hydroxynaphthalenes on Meteorites and Nitrogen Transfer from Urea: Modeling Insoluble Organic Matter?</title>
      <dc:description>Formation and structural modification of oxygenated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (oxyPAHs) by UV irradiation on minerals have recently been proposed as a possible channel of PAH transformation in astrochemical and prebiotic scenarios of possible relevance for the origin of life. Herein, we demonstrate that high energy proton beam irradiation in the presence of various meteorites, including stony iron, achondrite, and chondrite type, promotes the conversion of two representative oxyPAH compounds, 1&#8208;naphthol (1&#8208;HN) and 1,8&#8208;dihydroxynaphthalene (1,8&#8208;DHN), into complex mixtures of oxygenated and oligomeric derivatives. Main identified products include polyhydroxy derivatives, isomeric dimers encompassing benzofuran and benzopyran scaffolds, and, notably, a range of quinones and perylene derivatives. Addition of urea, a prebiotically&#8208;relevant chemical precursor, expanded the range of identified species to include, among others, quinone diimines. Proton beam irradiation of oxyPAH, as modulated by nitrogen containing compound like urea, is proposed as a possible contributory mechanism for the formation and processing of insoluble organic matter (IOM) in meteorites and in prebiotic processes</dc:description>

      <title>Allosteric control of naphthalene diimide encapsulation and electron transfer in porphyrin containers: photophysical studies and molecular dynamics simulation</title>
      <dc:description>The complexation processes of N,N&#8217;&#8208;dibutyl&#8208;1,4,5,8&#8208;naphthalene diimide (NDI) into two types of &#960;&#8208;electron&#8208;rich molecular containers consisting of two Zn(II)&#8208;porphyrins connected by four flexible linkers of two different lengths, were characterized by means of absorption and emission spectroscopies and molecular dynamics simulation. Noteworthy, the addition of NDI leads to a strong quenching of the fluorescence of both cages only when they are in an open conformation suitable for guest encapsulation, a situation triggered by silver(I) ions binding to the lateral triazoles. Molecular dynamics simulations confirm the fast binding of NDI, likely assisted by NDI&#8208;silver(I) interactions. Upon NDI complexation, the two porphyrin macrocycles get closer, with an optimized face to face orientation, suggesting an induced&#8208;fit mechanism through &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions with the NDI aromatic cycle. Ultrafast transient absorption experiments allowed to identify the process of quenching of the Zn&#8208;porphyrin fluorescence as an efficient photoinduced electron transfer reaction between the cage porphyrin and the included NDI guest. The process occurs on fast and ultrafast time scales in the two complexes (1.5 ps and &#8804; 300 fs) leading to a short&#8208;lived charge separated state (charge recombination lifetimes in the order of 30&#8208;40 ps). The combined computational and experimental approach used here is able to furnish a reliable model of the NDI&#8208;cage complexation mechanism and of the corresponding electron transfer reaction, attesting the allosteric control of both processes by the silver(I) ions.</dc:description>

      <title>Enhanced Macroanion Recognition of Superchaotropic Keggin Clusters Achieved by Synergy of Anion&#8208;&#960; Interaction and Anion&#8208;Cation Interaction</title>
      <dc:description>Keggin clusters are the most widely used polyoxomatales building blocks for construction advanced materials, while effective methods of precisely recognizing the isostructural analogues of Keggins are still limited. Here we applied zwitterionic molecule 4,4'&#8208;dipyridyl&#8208;N,N'&#8208;dioxide (dpdo) as a recognition receptor to specifically bind with the three Keggin analogues, PW12O403&#8208;, PMo12O403&#8208; and SiW12O404&#8208;, which co&#8208;assembled into three groups of spherical charged colloids with different sizes, separately. The recognition phenomena were further confirmed by electrochemistry study and crystallization behaviors. Compared with sole anion&#8208;cation interaction driven systems, the synergism from anion&#8208;&#960; adsorption between the superchaotropic Keggins and the electro&#8208;deficient pyridine rings is believed to enhance the recognition phenomenon. The observation is intriguing as the long&#8208;range solution assembly of Keggins is mainly driven by the short&#8208;range anion&#8208;&#960; interaction. Our results show that the little&#8208;noticed hydration shell of Keggins was significantly influenced by the superchaotropic effect, leading to differentiated binding affinity to the receptors and more obvious recognition phenomena between W/Mo Keggin analogues.</dc:description>

      <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional NiIr@N&#8208;Doped Carbon Nanocomposites Supported on Ni Foam for Electrocatalytic Overall Water Splitting</title>

Highly efficient electrocatalysts toward hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are extremely important for the practical application of water splitting technology. Here we report a one&#8208;step annealing strategy for the fabrication of a metal&#8208;organic framework&#8208;derived bifunctional self&#8208;supported electrocatalyst, which is composed of two&#8208;dimensional N&#8208;doped carbon&#8208;wrapped Ir&#8208;doped Ni nanoparticle composites supported on Ni foam (NiIr@N&#8208;C/NF). The resultant NiIr@N&#8208;C/NF displays excellent electrocatalytic performance in 1.0 M KOH, with low overpotentials of 32 mV at 10 mA cm  &#8208;2  for HER and 329 mV at 50 mA cm  &#8208;2  for OER. Particularly, the HER&#8208;OER bifunctional NiIr@N&#8208;C/NF needs only 1.50 V to yield 10 mA cm  &#8208;2  for overall water splitting.</dc:description>

Control of molecular machines at the single molecular scale. The cover picture shows nanocars competing in the nanoworld, in anticipation of the 2nd Nanocar Race scheduled for 2021. These 2&#8197;nm&#8208;long prototypes will be propelled thanks to their dipole under the action of an electric field induced by the tip of a Scanning Probe Microscope.

      <title>Conversion from Heterometallic to Homometallic Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>

Two new heterometallic metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), LnZnTPO, and two homometallic MOFs, LnTPO (Ln=Eu or Tb; H3TPO=tris(4&#8208;carboxyphenyl)phosphine oxide) were synthesized, and their structures and properties were analyzed.

Abstract
Two new heterometallic metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), LnZnTPO 1 and 2, and two homometallic MOFs, LnTPO 3 and 4 (Ln=Eu for 1 and 3, and Tb for 2 and 4; H3TPO=tris(4&#8208;carboxyphenyl)phosphine oxide) were synthesized, and their structures and properties were analyzed. They were prepared by solvothermal reaction of the C3&#8208;symmetric ligand H3TPO with the corresponding metal ion(s) (a mixture of Ln3+ and Zn2+ for 1 and 2, and Ln3+ alone for 3 and 4). Single&#8208;crystal XRD (SXRD) analysis revealed that 1 and 3 are isostructural to 2 and 4, respectively. TGA showed that the framework is thermally stable up to about 400&#8201;&#176;C for 1 and 2, and about 450&#8201;&#176;C for 3 and 4. PXRD analysis showed their pore&#8208;structure distortions without noticeable framework&#8211;structure changes during drying processes. The shapes of gas sorption isotherms for 1 and 3 are almost identical to those for 2 and 4, respectively. Solvothermal immersion of 1 and 2 in Tb3+ and Eu3+ solutions resulted in the framework metal&#8208;ion exchange affording 4 and 3, respectively, as confirmed by photoluminescence (PL), PXRD, IR, inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP&#8208;AES), and energy&#8208;dispersive X&#8208;ray (EDX) analyses.

      <title>Explaining Cu@Pt Bimetallic Nanoparticles Activity Based on NO Adsorption</title>
      <dc:description>
Explaining enhanced stability: Cu@Pt nanoparticles (NPs) are experimentally regarded as improved catalysts for NOx storage/reduction, with higher activities and selectivities compared with pure Pt or Cu NPs, and inverse Pt@Cu NPs.

Abstract
Cu@Pt nanoparticles (NPs) are experimentally regarded as improved catalysts for NOx storage/reduction, with higher activities and selectivities compared with pure Pt or Cu NPs, and with inverse Pt@Cu NPs. Here, a density functional theory&#8208;based study on such NP models with different sizes and shapes reveals that the observed enhanced stability of Cu@Pt compared with Pt@Cu NPs is due to energetic reasons. On both types of core@shell NPs, charge is transferred from Cu to Pt, strengthening the NP cohesion energy in Pt@Cu NPs, and spreading charge along the surface in Cu@Pt NPs. The negative surface Pt atoms in the latter diminish the NO bonding owing to an energetic rise of the Pt bands, as detected by the appliance of the d&#8208;band model, although other factors, such as atomic low coordination or the presence of an immediate subsurface Pt atom do as well. A charge density difference analysis discloses a donation/back&#8208;donation mechanism in the NO adsorption.

      <title>Sequence Decoding of 1D to 2D Self&#8208;Assembling Cyclic Peptides</title>
      <dc:description>The inherent ability of peptides to self&#8208;assemble with directional and rationally predictable interactions has fostered a plethora of synthetic two&#8208;dimensional (2D) supramolecular biomaterials. However, the design of peptides with hierarchical assembly in different dimensions across mesoscopic lengths remains a challenging task. We here describe the structural exploration of a D/L&#8208;alternating cyclic octapeptide capable of assembling one&#8208;dimensional (1D) nanotubes in water, which subsequently pack laterally to form giant 2D nanosheets up to 500 &#181;m long with a constant 3.2 nm thickness. Specific amino acid mutations allowed the mapping of structure&#8208;assembly relationships that determine 2D self&#8208;assembly. Nine peptide modifications were studied, revealing key features in the peptide sequence that nanosheets tolerated, while a total of three peptide variants included modifications that compromised their 2D arrangement.

Here a perspective on the structures and the functionalities of TOCs over the past three decades is made and the paramount roles of TOCs in serving supramolecular chemistry are demonstrated.

      <title>Ligand Selectivity by Inserting GCGC&#8208;tetrads Into G&#8208;quadruplex Structures</title>
      <dc:description>G&#8208;quadruplexes (G4s) assembled form tandem G&#8208;rich repeat sequences exhibit significant biological functions and applications, which may well depend on their structural features, such as the planar arrangement of G&#8208;tetrads and flexibility of loop regions. It has been found that cytosine&#8208;intercalated G&#8208;repeat sequences also assemble to be quadruplex structures, involving the formation of nonplanar GCGC&#8208;tetrads. Herein, to investigate the effect of GCGC&#8208;tetrads on structural properties of G4s, some previously studied quadruplexes with or without GCGC&#8208;tetrads were selected, and were used to interact with various developed G4 ligands. Our data show that stacked G&#8208;tetrads in quadruplexes are important for the &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions, thus promoting the combination with end&#8208;stacking ligands, such as porphyrins or planar small molecules. This is confirmed by the fact that the quadruplex formed by d(GGGCT4GGGC) with two internal G&#8208;tetrads and two external GCGC&#8208;tetrads can bind to planar ligands in the presence of specific G4&#8208;stabilizing cations, including K+ and Pb2+, and can realize the sensitive detection of Pb2+. However, the quadruplex composed of two external G&#8208;tetrads and two internal GCGC&#8208;tetrads formed by d(GCGGT3GCGG) facilitates the binding of nonplanar ligands, such as triphenylmethane (TPM) dyes, owing to the structural flexibility induced by internal GCGC&#8208;tetrads.

      <dc:description>The Pd&#8208;catalyzed directed thiocyanation reaction of arenes and heteroarenes by C&#8208;H bond activation was achieved. In the presence of an electrophilic SCN source, this original methodology offered an efficient tool to access a panel of functionalized thiocyanated compounds (21 examples, up to 78% yield).

      <title>The synthesis and mechanistic considerations of a series of ammonium monosubstituted H&#8208;phosphonate salts</title>
      <dc:description>A series of ammonium monosubstituted  H  &#8208;phosphonate salts were synthesized by combining  H&#8208;  phosphonate diesters with amines in the absence of solvent at 80&#176;C. Variation of the ester substituent and amine produced a range of ionic liquids with low melting points.

For the diphenyl  H  &#8208;phosphonate diesters, (PhO)  2  P(O)H, the dearylation was found to proceed via phenol&#8208;assisted formation of a 5&#8208;coordinate intermediate, (PhO)  3  PH(OH), from which P(OPh)  3  and water were eliminated.

      <title>Direct observation of dynamic interactions between orientation&#8208;controlled nucleosomes in a DNA origami frame</title>
      <dc:description>The nucleosome is one of the most fundamental units involved in gene expression and consequent cell development, differentiation, and expression of cell functions. We report here a method to place reconstituted nucleosomes into a DNA origami frame for direct observation using high&#8208;speed atomic&#8208;force microscopy (HS&#8208;AFM). Using this method, multiple nucleosomes can be incorporated into a DNA origami frame and real&#8208;time movement of nucleosomes can be visualized. The arrangement and conformation of nucleosomes and the distance between two nucleosomes can be designed and controlled. In addition, four nucleosomes can be placed in a DNA frame. Multiple nucleosomes were well accessible in each conformation, and interactions were observed between them. Neither mica surface modification nor chemical fixation of nucleosomes is used in this method, meaning that the DNA frame not only holds nucleosomes, but also retains their natural state. This method offers a promising platform for investigating nucleosome interactions and studying chromatin structure.</dc:description>

      <title>Cubane, Bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane and Bicyclo[2.2.2]octane: Impact and Thermal Sensitiveness of Carboxyl&#8208;, Hydroxymethyl&#8208; and Iodo&#8208;substituents</title>
      <dc:description>
Fire and bicy: The thermal and impact sensitiveness of a series of carboxy&#8208;, hydroxymethyl&#8208;, and iodo&#8208;substituted cages were examined through sealed cell differential scanning calorimetry and hammer impact tests. The results reveal that these often&#8208;popular synthetic intermediates and functional groups can present some safety issues if not handled, stored, or used with care.







Abstract
With the burgeoning interest in cage motifs for bioactive molecule discovery, and the recent disclosure of 1,4&#8208;cubane&#8208;dicarboxylic acid impact sensitivity, more research into the safety profiles of cage scaffolds is required. Therefore, the impact sensitivity and thermal decomposition behavior of judiciously selected starting materials and synthetic intermediates of cubane, bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane (BCP), and bicyclo[2.2.2]octane (BCO) were evaluated via hammer test and sealed cell differential scanning calorimetry, respectively. Iodo&#8208;substituted systems were found to be more impact sensitive, whereas hydroxymethyl substitution led to more rapid thermodecomposition. Cubane was more likely to be impact sensitive with these substituents, followed by BCP, whereas all BCOs were unresponsive. The majority of derivatives were placed substantially above Yoshida thresholds&#8212;a computational indicator of sensitivity.

      <title>Generating Excess Protons in Microsolvated Acid Clusters under Ambient Conditions: An Issue of Configurational Entropy versus Internal Energy</title>
      <dc:description>
Temperature dependent: Extensive ab initio path integral simulations disclose that the number of water molecules required to allow for acid dissociation, and thus for the generation of hydrated excess protons, in restricted aqueous environments such as finite HCl(H2O)n clusters, is temperature dependent.







Abstract
Acid dissociation, and thus liberation of excess protons in small water droplets, impacts on diverse fields such as interstellar, atmospheric or environmental chemistry. At cryogenic temperatures below 1&#8197;K, it is now well established that as few as four water molecules suffice to dissociate the generic strong acid HCl, yet temperature&#8208;driven recombination sets in simply upon heating that cluster. Here, the fundamental question is posed of how many more water molecules are required to stabilize a hydrated excess proton at room temperature. Ab initio path integral simulations disclose that not five, but six water molecules are needed at 300&#8197;K to allow for HCl dissociation independently from nuclear quantum effects. In order to provide the molecular underpinnings of these observations, the classical and quantum free energy profiles were decomposed along the dissociation coordinate in terms of the corresponding internal energy and entropy profiles. What decides in the end about acid dissociation, and thus ion pair formation, in a specific microsolvated water cluster at room temperature is found to be a fierce competition between classical configurational entropy and internal energy, where the former stabilizes the undissociated state whereas the latter favors dissociation. It is expected that these are generic findings with broad implications on acid&#8211;base chemistry depending on temperature in small water assemblies.

Structural hybridization of bioactive heterocycles is a promising tool to develop new efficient therapeutics for the treatment of various diseases including viral infections. The merging of two differently acting heterocycles&#8212;artemisinin and isoquinoline&#8212;in one hybrid molecule results in the discovery of a new and potent antiviral agent, which exceeds parent compounds in anti&#8208;HCMV and anti&#8208;HBV activities and is even able to outperform the clinically used drug ganciclovir.

      <title>Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Resorcin[4]arene Cavitands: Toward Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Activated Molecular Grippers</title>
      <dc:description>
Resorcin[4]arene cavitands can be switched between a kite conformation, adopted in the dark, and a vase conformation, generated under visible light irradiation. The switching is triggered by the formation of a semiquinone radical anion through a photosensitizing process. The large conformational rearrangement of the cavitands resembles the mechanical switching occurring in some flowers that bloom open in the evening and close during the day (cover design: Ella Maru Studio).

Abstract
Invited for the cover of this issue is the group of Jan&#8197;J. Weigand at Technische Universit&#228;t Dresden. The image depicts a puzzle illustrating the coinage metal cations and the methyl group, from which the three&#8208;dimensional structure of a multiply methylated tetraphosphetane arises.

&lt;p&gt;&#8220;&lt;i&gt;The multidentate nature of the tetraphosphetanes allows for coordination chemistry with selected coinage metal salts and methylation reactions. Like a puzzle, the full picture of the presented chemistry is put together piece by piece&lt;/i&gt;&#8221; Read more about the story behind the cover in the Cover Profile and about the research itself on page&#8197;&#9642;&#9642;&#8197;ff.
