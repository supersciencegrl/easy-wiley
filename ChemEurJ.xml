         <title>Color Tuning of Fluorogens for FAST Fluorogen&#8208;Activating Protein</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of color&#8208;shifted fluorogenic ligands for FAST protein without compromise to the binding efficiency and the utility for live&#8208;cell protein labeling are presented. This study highlights the potential of benzylidene imidazolones derivatives for rapid expansion of live&#8208;cell fluorogenic labeling tools.







Abstract
Using benzylidene imidazolone core, we created a panel of color&#8208;shifted fluorogenic ligands for FAST protein without compromise to the binding efficiency and the utility for live&#8208;cell protein labeling. This study highlights the potential of benzylidene imidazolones derivatives for rapid expansion of a pallet of live&#8208;cell fluorogenic labeling tools.

         <title>Structural Determination of an Unusual CuI&#8208;Porphyrin&#8208;&#960;&#8208;Bond in a Hetero&#8208;Pacman Cu&#8208;Zn&#8208;Complex</title>

A look at structure: The synthesis and characterization of a hetero&#8208;dinuclear compound is presented, in which a copper(I) trishistidine type coordination unit is positioned directly above a zinc porphyrin unit. The close distance between the two coordination fragments is secured by a rigid xanthene backbone, and a unique (intramolecular) copper porphyrin&#8208;&#960;&#8208;bond is determined for the first time in the molecular structure.







Abstract
The synthesis and characterization of a hetero&#8208;dinuclear compound is presented, in which a copper(I) trishistidine type coordination unit is positioned directly above a zinc porphyrin unit. The close distance between the two coordination fragments is secured by a rigid xanthene backbone, and a unique (intramolecular) copper porphyrin&#8208;&#960;&#8208;bond was determined for the first time in the molecular structure. This structural motif was further analyzed by temperature&#8208;dependent NMR studies: In solution at room temperature the coordinative bond fluctuates, while it can be frozen at low temperatures. Preliminary reactivity studies revealed a reduced reactivity of the copper(I) moiety towards dioxygen. The results adumbrate why nature is avoiding metal porphyrin&#8208;&#960;&#8208;bonds by fixing reactive metal centers in a predetermined distance to each other within multimetallic enzymatic reaction centers.

The spirocyclic hypervalent iodine reagents containing 4&#8208;oxazolidinone ring are prepared via a (3+2)&#8208;cycloaddition of azaoxyallyl cations with ethynylbenziodoxolones. They display satisfactory stability and solubility in organic solvents. Using them as precursors, both 4,1&#8208;benzoxazepine&#8208;2,5&#8208;diones and 1,3&#8208;diynes derivatives were afforded in one&#8208;pot under copper (I)&#8208;catalyzed conditions.







Abstract
Herein, a [3+2] cycloaddition of aza&#8208;oxyallylic cations with ethynylbenziodoxolones for synthesis of new &#955;3&#8208;iodanes containing spirocyclic 4&#8208;oxazolidinone has been developed. This cyclic &#955;3&#8208;iodanes display stability in air and excellent solubility in organic solvent. Using them as substrate, both the 4,1&#8208;benzoxazepine&#8208;2,5&#8208;diones and symmetrical 1,3&#8208;diynes derivatives were afforded in high yield under copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed conditions.

         <title>Cellular Fucosylation Inhibitors Based on Fluorinated Fucose&#8208;1&#8208;phosphates**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fucosylation of glycans impacts a myriad of physiological of pathological activities. In this study, new fucosylation inhibitors based on fluorination of fucose&#8208;1&#8208;phosphates were developed. Inhibitors A2FF1P and B2FF1P are potent, specific, non&#8208;toxic, inhibit fucosylation for multiple days and have a known mechanism of action. These new tools will help study the role of fucosylation in health and disease and are potential therapeutic candidates.







Abstract
Fucosylation of glycans impacts a myriad of physiological and pathological processes. Inhibition of fucose expression emerges as a potential therapeutic avenue for example in cancer, inflammation, and infection. In this study, we found that protected 2&#8208;fluorofucose 1&#8208;phosphate efficiently inhibits cellular fucosylation with a four to seven times higher potency than known inhibitor 2FF, independently of the anomeric stereochemistry. Nucleotide sugar analysis revealed that both the &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;GDP&#8208;2FF anomers are formed inside the cell. In conclusion, we developed A2FF1P and B2FF1P as potent new tools for studying the role of fucosylation in health and disease and they are potential therapeutic candidates.

         <title>Enantiopure Calcium Iminophosphonamide Complexes: Synthesis, Photoluminescence, and Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Glowing bones: Enantiopure homoleptic iminophosphonamide calcium complexes have been prepared. These show rich photoluminescence properties and catalytic activity in the hydroboration of ketones.







Abstract
The synthesis of calcium complexes ligated by three different chiral iminophosphonamide ligands, L&#8208;H (L=[Ph2P{N(R)CH(CH3)Ph}2]), L&#8242;&#8208;H (L&#8242;=[Ph2P{NDipp}{N(R)CH(CH3)Ph}]), (Dipp=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3), and L&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;H (L&#8242;&#8242;=[Ph2P{N(R)CH(CH3)naph}2]), (naph=naphthyl) is presented. The resulting structures [L2Ca], [L&#8242;2Ca], and [L&#8242;&#8242;2Ca] represent the first examples of enantiopure homoleptic calcium complexes based on this type of ligands. The calcium complexes show blue&#8211;green photoluminescence (PL) in the solid state, which is especially bright at low temperatures. Whereas the emission of [L&#8242;&#8242;2Ca] is assigned to the fluorescence of naphthyl groups, the PL of [L2Ca] and [L&#8242;2Ca] is contributed by long&#8208;lived phosphorescence and thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF), with a strong variation of the PL lifetimes over the temperature range of 5&#8211;295&#8197;K. Furthermore, an excellent catalytic activity was found for these complexes in hydroboration of ketones at room temperature, although no enantioselectivity was achieved.

&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ca] represent the first examples of enantiopure homoleptic calcium complexes based on this type of ligands.

&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ca] is contributed by long&#8208;lived phosphorescence and thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF), with a strong variation of the PL lifetimes over the temperature range of 5&#8211;295&#8197;K. Furthermore, an excellent catalytic activity was found for these complexes in hydroboration of ketones at room temperature, although no enantioselectivity was achieved.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Isoindolinone Synthesis via One&#8208;Pot Type Transition Metal Catalyzed C&#8722;C Bond Forming Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Isoindolinone motif can found in a large variety biologically and pharmaceutically active compounds. Due to the central role in a number of applications, the synthetic methodologies for accessing this heterocyclic skeleton have received significant attention during the past decade. Herein, the recent advances (2010&#8211;2020) in transition metal catalyzed synthetic methodologies via formation of new C&#8722;C bonds for isoindolinones are reviewed.







Abstract
Isoindolinone structure is an important privileged scaffold found in a large variety of naturally occurring as well as synthetic, biologically and pharmaceutically active compounds. Owing to its crucial role in a number of applications, the synthetic methodologies for accessing this heterocyclic skeleton have received significant attention during the past decade. In general, the synthetic strategies can be divided into two categories: First, direct utilization of phthalimides or phthalimidines as starting materials for the synthesis of isoindolinones; and second, construction of the lactam and/or aromatic rings by different catalytic methods, including C&#8722;H activation, cross&#8208;coupling, carbonylation, condensation, addition and formal cycloaddition reactions. Especially in the last mentioned, utilization of transition metal catalysts provides access to a broad range of substituted isoindolinones. Herein, the recent advances (2010&#8211;2020) in transition metal catalyzed synthetic methodologies via formation of new C&#8722;C bonds for isoindolinones are reviewed.

         <title>Optical Characteristics of Hybrid Macrocycles with Dithienogermole and Tricoordinate Boron Units</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unconventional elements: New macrocyclic compounds containing tricoordinate boron and germanium show characteristic fluoride responses in their optical properties, depending on their structures. This indicates that the element&#8208;hybrid macrocyclic system is promising as a new class of fluoride sensor material.







Abstract
The introduction of unconventional elements into &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems has been studied to manipulate the electronic states and properties of compounds. Herein, boron&#8208; and germanium&#8208;containing hybrid macrocycles, as a new class of element&#8208;hybrid conjugated systems, have been synthesized. The palladium&#8208;catalyzed Stille cross coupling of bis(bromothienyl)borane and bis(trimethylstannylthienyl)&#8208; or bis(trimethylstannylphenyl)&#8208;substituted dithienogermoles as the boron&#8208; and germanium&#8208;containing building blocks, respectively, produced a mixture of several macrocyclic compounds. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis of the 2:2 coupling product revealed a planar structure with a cavity inside the macrocycle. The optical properties of the macrocyclic products indicated rather small electronic interactions between the building units. However, intramolecular photoenergy transfer from the dithienogermole unit to the boron unit was clearly observed with respect to the fluorescence spectra.

         <title>Additive&#8208;free Aqueous Dispersions of Two&#8208;Dimensional Materials&#160;with Glial Cell Compatibility and Enzymatic&#160;Degradability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Water&#8208;dispersible two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials are desirable for diverse applications. Aqueous dispersions make processing safer and greener, and enable evaluation of these materials on biological and environmental fronts. To evaluate the effects of 2D materials with biological systems, obtaining dispersions without additives is critical and has been a challenge. Herein, we developed a method for obtaining additive&#8208;free aqueous dispersions of 2D materials like transition metal dichalcogenides and hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN). The nanosheet dispersions are investigated through spectroscopic and microscopic methods, along with the role of size on stability. The aqueous media enabled investigations on cytocompatibility and enzymatic degradation of molybdenum disulphide (MoS  2  ) and h&#8208;BN. Cytocompatibility with mixed glial cells is observed up to concentrations of 100 &#956;g ml  &#8208;1  , suggesting their plausible usage in bioelectronics. Besides, biodegradation using human myeloperoxidase (hMPO) mediated catalysis is investigated through Raman spectroscopy and electron microscopy. The findings suggest that additive&#8208;free 2H&#8208;MoS  2  and h&#8208;BN are degradable by hMPO, with 2H&#8208;phase exhibiting better resistance to degradation than the 1T&#8208;phase, while h&#8208;BN exhibits slower degradation. The findings pave a path for incorporating 2D materials in the burgeoning field of transient bioelectronics.</dc:description>

         <title>Tunable Light Emission Properties of Solution&#8208;Processable N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Cyclometalated Gold(III) Complexes for Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) cyclometalated gold(III) complexes remain very scarce and therefore their photophysical properties remain currently underexplored. Moreover, gold(III) complexes emitting in the blue region of the electromagnetic spectrum are rare. In this work, a series of four phosphorescent gold(III) complexes were investigated bearing four different NHC monocyclometalated (C^C*)&#8208;type ligands and a dianionic (N^N)&#8208;type ancillary ligand ((N^N) = 5,5&#8217;&#8208;(propane&#8208;2,2&#8208;diyl)bis(3&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrazole) (mepzH2)). The complexes exhibit strong phosphorescence when doped in poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) at room temperature, which were systematically tuned from sky&#8208;blue [&#955;PL = 456 nm, CIE coordinates: (0.20, 034)] to green [&#955;PL = 516 nm, CIE coordinates: (0.31, 0.54)] by varying the monocyclometalated (C^C*) ligand framework. The complexes revealed high quantum efficiencies (&#981;PL) of up to 43% and excited&#8208;state lifetimes (&#964;0) between 15&#8211;266 &#956;s. The radiative rate constant values found for these complexes (kr = 103&#8211;104 s&#8211;1) are the highest found in comparison to previously known best performing monocyclometalated gold(III) complexes. Density functional theory (DFT) and time&#8208;dependent DFT (TD&#8208;DFT) calculations of these complexes further lend support to the excited state nature of these complexes.&#160;Additionally, organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) were fabricated using solution&#8208;process to provide the first insight into the electroluminescent (EL) properties of this new class of gold(III) complexes.</dc:description>

         <title>Probing the local reaction environment during high turnover carbon dioxide reduction with Ag&#8208;based gas diffusion electrodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Discerning the influence of electrochemical reactions on the electrode microenvironment is an unavoidable topic for electro&#173;chemical reactions that involve the production of OH &#8208; and the con&#173;sumption of water. That is particularly true for the carbon dioxide re&#173;duction reaction (CO 2 RR) which together with the competing hydro&#173;gen evolution reaction exert changes in the local OH &#8208; and H 2 O activi&#173;ty which in turn can possibly affect activity, stability and selectivity of the CO 2 RR. We determine the local OH &#8208; and H 2 O activity in close proximity to a CO 2 converting Ag&#8208;based gas diffusion electrode (GDE) with product analysis using gas chromatography. A Pt&#8208;nano&#173;sensor is positioned in the vicinity of the working GDE using shear&#173;force&#8208;based scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) approach curves allowing to monitor changes invoked by reactions proceeding within an otherwise inaccessible porous GDE by potentiodynamic measurements at the Pt&#8208;tip nanosensor. We show that high turnover HER/CO 2 RR at a GDE lead to modulations of the alkalinity of the local electrolyte, that resemble a 16&#160;M KOH solution, variations which are in turn linked to the reaction selectivity.</dc:description>

We show that high turnover HER/CO 2 RR at a GDE lead to modulations of the alkalinity of the local electrolyte, that resemble a 16&#160;M KOH solution, variations which are in turn linked to the reaction selectivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We demonstrate ultrafast optical control of intramolecular charge flow which paves the way for photocurrent modulation and switching with a highly wavelength&#8208;selective ON/OFF ratio. The system we explore is a&#160;  fac  &#8208; [ Re(CO)  3  (TTF&#8208;DPPZ)Cl ] &#160;complexe, where TTF&#8208;DPPZ = 4&#8217;,5&#8217;&#8208;bis(propylthio)tetrathiafulvenyl[  i  ]dipyrido[3,2&#8208;  a  :2&#8217;,3&#8217;&#8208;  c  ]phenazine. DFT calculations and AC&#8208;Stark spectroscopy confirm the presence of two distinct optically active charge&#8208;transfer processes, namely a metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (MLCT) and an intra&#8208;ligand charge transfer (ILCT). Ultrafast transient absorption measurements show that the ILCT state decays in the ps regime. Upon excitation to the MLCT state, only a long&#8208;lived&#160;  3  MLCT state is observed after 80 ps. Remarkably, however, the bleaching of the ILCT absorption band remains as a result of the effective inhibition of the HOMO&#8208;LUMO transition</dc:description>

         <title>Novel Noncentrosymmetric Tetrel Pnictides composed of Square&#8208;Planar Au(I) with Peculiar Bonding</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Three novel isostructural equiatomic gold tetrel pnictides, AuSiAs, AuGeP, and AuGeAs, were synthesized and characterized. These phases crystallize in the noncentrosymmetric (NCS) monoclinic space group Cc (No. 9), featuring square planar Au within cis &#8208;[AuTt  2  Pn  2  ] units ( Tt = tetrel, Si, Ge; Pn = pnictogen, P, As). This is in drastic contrast to the structure of the previously reported AuSiP that exhibits typical linear coordination of Au with Si and P. Chemical bonding analysis via electron localization function (ELF) suggests covalent 2c&#8208;2e Tt&#8208;Pn bonds, and 3&#8208;center Au&#8208;Tt &#8208;Au and Au&#8208;Pn &#8208;Au bonds with 1.6 e  &#8208;  /bond. X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) studies support the covalent and not ionic nature of Au&#8208;Pn and Au&#8208;Tt bonds. The title materials were found to be n&#8208;type narrow&#8208;gap semiconductors or semimetals, with nearly temperature&#8208;independent electrical resistivities and low thermal conductivities. A combination of the semimetallic properties with tunable NCS structure provides opportunities of the materials development based on Au tetrel pnictides.</dc:description>

         <title>Multi&#8208;functional, Low Symmetry Pd2L4 Nanocage Libraries**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Symmetry is over: A family of functionalised, asymmetric ditopic ligands was synthesised from a common precursor. Each ligand was capable of self&#8208;assembling with PdII ions to selectively form low&#8208;symmetry cis&#8208;Pd2L4 nanocages. Due to the isostructural nature of the ligand framework, multiple ligands were able to be combined to generate combinatorial libraries containing heteroleptic, multi&#8208;functional, low symmetry nanocages.







Abstract
Although many impressive metallo&#8208;supramolecular architectures have been reported, they tend towards high symmetry structures and avoid extraneous functionality to ensure high fidelity in the self&#8208;assembly process. This minimalist approach, however, limits the range of accessible structures and thus their potential applications. Herein is described the synthesis of a family of ditopic ligands wherein the ligand scaffolds are both low symmetry and incorporate exohedral functional moieties. Key to this design is the use of CuI&#8208;catalysed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) chemistry, as the triazole is capable of acting as both a coordinating heterocycle and a tether between the ligand framework and functional unit simultaneously. A common precursor was used to generate ligands with various functionalities, allowing control of electronic properties whilst maintaining the core structure of the resultant cis&#8208;Pd2L4 nanocage assemblies. The isostructural nature of the scaffold frameworks enabled formation of combinatorial libraries from the self&#8208;assembly of ligand mixtures, generating a statistical mixture of multi&#8208;functional, low symmetry architectures.

         <title>Donor&#8211;Acceptor Stenhouse Adducts: Exploring the Effects of Ionic Character</title>

         <dc:description>
It's a switch! The effects of solution&#8208;state dielectric and intermolecular interactions on the degree of charge separation provide a route to understanding the switching properties and concentration dependence of donor&#8211;acceptor Stenhouse adducts (DASAs; see figure). Through solvatochromic analysis of the open&#8208;form DASA in conjunction with X&#8208;ray diffraction and computational theory, we have analyzed the ionic character of a series of DASAs.







Abstract
The effects of solution&#8208;state dielectric and intermolecular interactions on the degree of charge separation provide a route to understanding the switching properties and concentration dependence of donor&#8211;acceptor Stenhouse adducts (DASAs). Through solvatochromic analysis of the open&#8208;form DASA in conjunction with X&#8208;ray diffraction and computational theory, we have analyzed the ionic character of a series of DASAs. First&#8208; and third&#8208;generation architectures lead to a higher zwitterionic resonance contribution of the open form and a zwitterionic closed form, whereas the second&#8208;generation architecture possesses a less charge&#8208;separated open form and neutral closed form. This can be correlated with equilibrium control and photoswitching solvent compatibility. As a result of the high contribution of the zwitterionic resonance forms of first&#8208; and third&#8208;generation DASAs, we were able to control their switching kinetics by means of ion concentration, whereas second&#8208;generation DASAs were less affected. Importantly, these results show how the previously reported concentration dependence of DASAs is not universal, and that DASAs with a more hybrid structure in the open form can achieve photoswitching at high concentrations.

         <title>Tuning the Regioselective Functionalization of Trifluoromethylated Dienes via Lanthanum&#8208;Mediated Single C&#8722;F Bond Activation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Making it linear: The right combination of lanthanide metal and Lewis acid affords the regio&#8208; and stereoselective functionalization of trifluoromethylated dienes with a wide range of aldehydes. Unprecedented ipso substitution is observed, and the regioselectivity is investigated by DFT calculations.







Abstract
The development of new fluorine&#8208;containing building blocks and their efficient synthetic access is currently a challenging research field. Herein, the highly regio&#8208; and stereoselective addition of a large range of aldehydes onto trifluoromethylated benzofulvenes was achieved using a simple La/I2/DIBAL&#8208;Cl system via a selective C&#8722;F bond activation process. This versatile methodology provided homodienyl alcohols bearing a terminal CF2&#8208;alkene with potential further applications, as shown by the dehydration to the first benzofulvenes carrying a difluorovinyl group. In addition, for certain electron&#8208;poor aldehydes, unprecedented ipso substitution of the CF3 group in a diene was observed, which, according to DFT studies, is related to the presence of the large, Lewis&#8208;acidic lanthanum metal.

         <title>Ditopic Chelators of Dicopper Centers for Enhanced Tyrosinases Inhibition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ty combined: The combination of known tyrosinase (Ty) inhibitors improves inhibition activities, which is tested and compared for isolated enzymes (fungal, bacterial, and human). The interaction mode with the dicopper active site is discussed by using a functional model of the active site associated with theoretical modeling. One ditopic compound displays melanogenesis suppression in melanoma cells.







Abstract
Tyrosinase enzymes (Tys) are involved in the key steps of melanin (protective pigments) biosynthesis and molecules targeting the binuclear copper active site on tyrosinases represent a relevant strategy to regulate enzyme activities. In this work, the possible synergic effect generated by a combination of known inhibitors is studied. For this, derivatives containing kojic acid (KA) and 2&#8208;hydroxypyridine&#8208;N&#8208;oxide (HOPNO) combined with a thiosemicarbazone (TSC) moiety were synthetized. Their inhibition activities were evaluated on purified tyrosinases from different sources (mushroom, bacterial, and human) as well as on melanin production by lysates from the human melanoma MNT&#8208;1 cell line. Results showed significant enhancement of the inhibitory effects compared with the parent compounds, in particular for HOPNO&#8208;TSC. To elucidate the interaction mode with the dicopper(II) active site, binding studies with a tyrosinase bio&#8208;inspired model of the dicopper(II) center were investigated. The structure of the isolated adduct between one ditopic inhibitor (KA&#8208;TSC) and the model complex reveals that the binding to a dicopper center can occur with both chelating sites. Computational studies on model complexes and docking studies on enzymes led to the identification of KA and HOPNO moieties as interacting groups with the dicopper active site.

         <title>Gold&#8208;Based Pharmacophore Inhibits Intracellular MYC Protein</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A golden bullet: Gold&#8208;based warheads capable of protein binding and ligand&#8208;affinity chemistry enable modification of the MYC protein and inhibition of MYC activity in cells. This is a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study to modify intracellular protein&#8208;protein interactions such as MYC/MAX by using metal&#8208;mediated ligand affinity chemistry (MLAC) based on gold.







Abstract
Direct targeting of intrinsically disordered proteins, including MYC, by small molecules for biomedical applications would resolve a longstanding issue in chemical biology and medicine. Thus, we developed gold&#8208;based small&#8208;molecule MYC reagents that engage MYC inside cells and modulate MYC transcriptional activity. Lead compounds comprise an affinity ligand and a gold(I) or gold(III) warhead capable of protein chemical modification. Cell&#8208;based MYC target engagement studies via CETSA and co&#8208;immunoprecipitation reveal specific interaction of compounds with MYC in cells. The lead gold(I) reagent, 1, demonstrates superior cell&#8208;killing potential (up to 35&#8208;fold) in a MYC&#8208;dependent manner when compared to 10058&#8208;F4 in cells including the TNBC, MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231. Subsequently, 1 suppresses MYC transcription factor activity via functional colorimetric assays, and gene&#8208;profiling using whole&#8208;cell transcriptomics reveals significant modulation of MYC target genes by 1. These findings point to metal&#8208;mediated ligand affinity chemistry (MLAC) based on gold as a promising strategy to develop chemical probes and anticancer therapeutics targeting MYC.

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Intermolecular Silylation of Csp&#8208;H by Silacyclobutanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The signature reactivity of silacyclobutane (SCB) is their cycloaddition reactions with various &#960; bonds. Recently we disclosed the first cases where SCBs reacted with both C  sp2  &#8208;H and C  sp3  &#8208;H &#963; bonds in an intramolecular fashion. Herein, we report that SCB is also an efficient reagent for C  sp  &#8208;H bond silylation. Thus, rhodium catalysed intermolecular reactions between SCBs and terminal alkynes produced a series of symmetrical and unsymmetrical tetraorganosilicons bearing a C  sp  &#8208;Si functionality. Our preliminary studied suggested that the reaction did not involve a cycloaddition pathway, but instead a direct activation of C  sp  &#8208;H bonds.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual Emission of meso&#8208;Phenyleneethynylene&#8211;BODIPY Oligomers: Synthesis, Photophysics, and Theoretical Optoelectronic Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 7, Page 2493-2505, February 1, 2021. </description>

Double DIPY: meso&#8208;Phenyl&#8208;derived boron&#8208;dipyrromethene (BODIPY), coupled to phenyleneethynylene (PE) oligomers, is electronically isolated from the &#960;&#8208;PE conjugation because of its orthogonality, but displays high energy transfer (ET) efficiencies or dual emission.







Abstract
Two series of 2,5&#8208;di(butoxy)phenyleneethynylenes, one halogenated (nPEC4&#8208;X; n=2, 3, or 4) and the other boron&#8208;dipyrromethene (BODIPY) terminated (nPEC4&#8208;By; n=3, 4, or 5; By=BODIPY), were synthesized monodirectionally by the step&#8208;by&#8208;step approach and the molecular structure was corroborated by NMR spectroscopy (1H, 13C&#8208;DEPTQ&#8208;135, COSY, HSQC, HMBC, 11B, 19F) and MALDI&#8208;TOF mass spectrometry. The multiplicity and J&#8208;coupling constants of 1H, 11B, and 19F/11B&#8197;NMR signals revealed, in the nPEC4&#8208;By series, that the phenyl in the meso position of BODIPY becomes electronically part of the conjugation of the phenyleneethynylene chain, whereas BODIPY is electronically isolated. The photophysical, electrochemical, and theoretical studies confirm this finding because the properties of nPEC4&#8208;By are comparable to those of the nPEC4&#8208;X oligomers and BODIPY, indicating negligible electron communication between BODIPY and the nPEC4 moieties. Nevertheless, energy transfer (ET) from nPEC4 to BODIPY was rationalized by spectroscopy and theoretical calculations. Its yield decreases with the nPEC4 conjugation length, according to the increase in distance between the two chromophores, resulting in dual emission for the longest oligomer in which ET is quenched.

         <title>Dendritic Oligoglycerol Regioisomer Mixtures and Their Utility for Membrane Protein Research</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 7, Page 2537-2542, February 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The secret lies in the mix: Regioisomer mixtures of dendritic oligoglycerol detergents have recently attracted attention from experimentalist in membrane protein research. The present study outlines the synthesis of detergent regioisomer mixtures and sheds light on their utility for the purification of membrane proteins. The obtained results point to new avenues for the development of lipid&#8208;like detergent mixtures in membrane protein research.







Abstract
Dendrons are an important class of macromolecules that can be used for a broad range of applications. Recent studies have indicated that mixtures of oligoglycerol detergent (OGD) regioisomers are superior to individual regioisomers for protein extraction. The origin of this phenomenon remains puzzling. Here we discuss the synthesis and characterization of dendritic oligoglycerol regioisomer mixtures and their implementation into detergents. We provide experimental benchmarks to support quality control after synthesis and investigate the unusual utility of OGD regioisomer mixtures for extracting large protein quantities from biological membranes. We anticipate that our findings will enable the development of mixed detergent platforms in the future.

&lt;p&gt;Dendrons are an important class of macromolecules that can be used for a broad range of applications. Recent studies have indicated that mixtures of oligoglycerol detergent (OGD) regioisomers are superior to individual regioisomers for protein extraction. The origin of this phenomenon remains puzzling. Here we discuss the synthesis and characterization of dendritic oligoglycerol regioisomer mixtures and their implementation into detergents. We provide experimental benchmarks to support quality control after synthesis and investigate the unusual utility of OGD regioisomer mixtures for extracting large protein quantities from biological membranes. We anticipate that our findings will enable the development of mixed detergent platforms in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Assessing The Key Photophysical Properties of Triangulenium Dyes for DNA Binding by Alteration of the Fluorescent Core</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 7, Page 2523-2536, February 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two new optical probes for DNA based on diazatriangulenium dyes featuring ethyl&#8208;morpholino substituents are reported. Upon interaction with duplex and quadruplex DNA, these two probes switch on their fluorescence intensity and change their emission lifetime (although the latter is not dependent on the DNA topology). This has allowed study of the cellular uptake and localisation of the two new probes in cancer cells. Whilst structural modifications to the diazatriangulenium core only slightly alter the binding affinity to DNA, their cellular localisation is significantly altered.







Abstract
Four&#8208;stranded G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) DNA is a non&#8208;canonical DNA topology that has been proposed to form in cells and play key roles in how the genome is read and used by the cellular machinery. Previously, a fluorescent triangulenium probe (DAOTA&#8208;M2) was used to visualise G4s in cellulo, thanks to its distinct fluorescence lifetimes when bound to different DNA topologies. Herein, the library of available triangulenium probes is expanded to explore how modifications to the fluorescent core of the molecule affect its photophysical characteristics, interaction with DNA and cellular localisation. The benzo&#8208;bridged and isopropyl&#8208;bridged diazatriangulenium dyes, BDATA&#8208;M2 and CDATA&#8208;M2 respectively, featuring ethyl&#8208;morpholino substituents, were synthesised and characterised. The interactions of these molecules with different DNA topologies were studied to determine their binding affinity, fluorescence enhancement and fluorescence lifetime response. Finally, the cellular uptake and localisation of these optical probes were investigated. Whilst structural modifications to the triangulenium core only slightly alter the binding affinity to DNA, BDATA&#8208;M2 and CDATA&#8208;M2 cannot distinguish between DNA topologies through their fluorescence lifetime. It is argued theoretically and experimentally that this is due to reduced effectiveness of photoinduced electron transfer (PET) quenching. This work presents valuable new evidence into the critical role of PET quenching when using the fluorescence lifetime of triangulenium dyes to discriminate G4 DNA from duplex DNA, highlighting the importance of fine tuning redox and spectral properties when developing new triangulenium&#8208;based G4 probes.

         <title>Synthesis and Evaluation of Non&#8208;Hydrolyzable Phospho&#8208;Lysine Peptide Mimics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 7, Page 2326-2331, February 1, 2021. </description>

A stable mimic: This work introduces a phosphonate amino acid as a stable non&#8208;hydrolyzable mimic of phospho&#8208;lysine (pLys), which can be readily incorporated into peptides by Fmoc&#8208;based solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis.







Abstract
The intrinsic lability of the phosphoramidate P&#8722;N bond in phosphorylated histidine (pHis), arginine (pHis) and lysine (pLys) residues is a significant challenge for the investigation of these post&#8208;translational modifications (PTMs), which gained attention rather recently. While stable mimics of pHis and pArg have contributed to study protein substrate interactions or to generate antibodies for enrichment as well as detection, no such analogue has been reported yet for pLys. This work reports the synthesis and evaluation of two pLys mimics, a phosphonate and a phosphate derivative, which can easily be incorporated into peptides using standard fluorenyl&#8208;methyloxycarbonyl&#8208; (Fmoc&#8208;)based solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis (SPPS). In order to compare the biophysical properties of natural pLys with our synthetic mimics, the pKa values of pLys and analogues were determined in titration experiments applying nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy in small model peptides. These results were used to compute electrostatic potential (ESP) surfaces obtained after molecular geometry optimization. These findings indicate the potential of the designed non&#8208;hydrolyzable, phosphonate&#8208;based mimic for pLys in various proteomic approaches.

         <title>Rational Design and Controlled Synthesis of V&#8208;Doped Ni3S2/NixPy Heterostructured Nanosheets for the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>

V good: Interface engineering and heteroatom doping were used to grow heterostructured V&#8208;doped V&#8208;Ni3S2/NixPy (VNSP) nanosheets on Ni foam (NF). The resulting VNSP/NF electrocatalyst showed excellent performance in the hydrogen evolution reaction with an extremely low overpotential of 90&#8197;mV at a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and satisfactory long&#8208;term durability.







Abstract
Rational construction of high&#8208;efficiency and low&#8208;cost catalysts is one of the most promising ways to produce hydrogen but remains a huge challenge. Herein, interface engineering and heteroatom doping were used to synthesize V&#8208;doped sulfide/phosphide heterostructures on nickel foam (V&#8208;Ni3S2/NixPy/NF) by phosphating treatment at low temperature. The incorporation of V can adjust the electronic structure of Ni3S2, expose more active sites, and protect the 3D structure of Ni foam from damage. Meanwhile, the heterogeneous interface formed between Ni3S2 and NixPy can provide abundant active sites and accelerate electron transfer. As a result, the V&#8208;Ni3S2/NixPy/NF nanosheet catalyst exhibits outstanding activity in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with an extremely low overpotential of 90&#8197;mV at a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and stable durability in alkaline solution, which exceeds those most of the previously reported Ni&#8208;based materials. This work shows that rational design by interfacial engineering and metal&#8208;atom incorporation has a significant influence for efficient hydrogen evolution.

         <title>Unsupported Mg&#8211;Alkene Bonding</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 7, Page 2513-2522, February 1, 2021. </description>

Weak but important: The first unsupported alkene complexes of an s&#8208;block metal have been realized. Alkene&#8211;magnesium coordination is in all cases asymmetric and leads to polarization of &#960;&#8208;electron density in the C=C bond. There is no alkene&#8594;Mg charge transfer and only minimal C=C bond lengthening. Although weak, these interactions are important in early main group metal catalysis.







Abstract
The first intermolecular early main group metal&#8211;alkene complexes were isolated. This was enabled by using highly Lewis acidic Mg centers in the Lewis base&#8208;free cations (MeBDI)Mg+ and (tBuBDI)Mg+ with B(C6F5)4&#8722; counterions (MeBDI=CH[C(CH3)N(DIPP)]2, tBuBDI=CH[C(tBu)N(DIPP)]2, DIPP=2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl). Coordination complexes with various mono&#8208; and bis&#8208;alkene ligands, typically used in transition metal chemistry, were structurally characterized for 1,3&#8208;divinyltetramethyldisiloxane, 1,5&#8208;cyclooctadiene, cyclooctene, 1,3,5&#8208;cycloheptatriene, 2,3&#8208;dimethylbuta&#8208;1,3&#8208;diene, and 2&#8208;ethyl&#8208;1&#8208;butene. In all cases, asymmetric Mg&#8211;alkene bonding with a short and a long Mg&#8722;C bond is observed. This asymmetry is most extreme for Mg&#8211;(H2C=CEt2) bonding. In bromobenzene solution, the Mg&#8211;alkene complexes are either dissociated or in a dissociation equilibrium. A DFT study and AIM analysis showed that the C=C bonds hardly change on coordination and there is very little alkene&#8594;Mg electron transfer. The Mg&#8211;alkene bonds are mainly electrostatic and should be described as Mg2+ ion&#8208;induced dipole interactions.

&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; counterions (&lt;sup&gt;Me&lt;/sup&gt;BDI=CH[C(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)N(DIPP)]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;Bu&lt;/sup&gt;BDI=CH[C(&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;Bu)N(DIPP)]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, DIPP=2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl). Coordination complexes with various mono&#8208; and &lt;i&gt;bis&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;alkene ligands, typically used in transition metal chemistry, were structurally characterized for 1,3&#8208;divinyltetramethyldisiloxane, 1,5&#8208;cyclooctadiene, cyclooctene, 1,3,5&#8208;cycloheptatriene, 2,3&#8208;dimethylbuta&#8208;1,3&#8208;diene, and 2&#8208;ethyl&#8208;1&#8208;butene. In all cases, asymmetric Mg&#8211;alkene bonding with a short and a long Mg&#8722;C bond is observed. This asymmetry is most extreme for Mg&#8211;(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C=CEt&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) bonding. In bromobenzene solution, the Mg&#8211;alkene complexes are either dissociated or in a dissociation equilibrium. A DFT study and AIM analysis showed that the C=C bonds hardly change on coordination and there is very little alkene&#8594;Mg electron transfer. The Mg&#8211;alkene bonds are mainly electrostatic and should be described as Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ion&#8208;induced dipole interactions.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>How Does Iron Storage Protein Ferritin Interact with Plutonium (and Thorium)?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 7, Page 2393-2401, February 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
With a tool box of analytical, spectroscopic, and molecular dynamic techniques, this work sheds light on the interactions of plutonium (and thorium), early actinides at oxidation state +IV, with ferritin and its ability to store those elements at physiological pH compared to Fe.







Abstract
The impact of the contamination of living organisms by actinide elements has been a constant subject of attention since the 1950s. But to date still little is understood. Ferritin is the major storage and regulation protein of iron in many organisms, it consists of a protein ring and a ferrihydric core at the center. This work sheds light on the interactions of early actinides (Th, Pu) at oxidation state +IV with ferritin and its ability to store those elements at physiological pH compared to Fe. The ferritin&#8211;thorium load curve suggests that ThIV saturates the protein (2840 Th atoms per ferritin) in a similar way that Fe does on the protein ring. Complementary spectroscopic techniques (spectrophotometry, infrared spectroscopy, and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy) were combined with molecular dynamics to provide a structural model of the interaction of ThIV and PuIV with ferritin. Comparison of spectroscopic data together with MD calculations suggests that ThIV and PuIV are complexed mainly on the protein ring and not on the ferrihydric core. Indeed from XAS data, there is no evidence of Fe neighbors in the Th and Pu environments. On the other hand, carboxylates from amino acids of the protein ring and a possible additional carbonate anion are shaping the cation coordination spheres. This thorough description from a molecular view point of ThIV and PuIV interaction with ferritin, an essential iron storage protein, is a cornerstone in comprehensive nuclear toxicology.

         <title>Tuning the Organogelating and Spectroscopic Properties of a C3&#8208;Symmetric Pyrene&#8208;Based Gelator through Charge Transfer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 7, Page 2410-2420, February 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organogels were formed from a C3&#8208;symmetric gelator through charge&#8208;transfer complexation (CTC). Their properties proved to be highly dependent on the nature of the electron poor dopant. The latter significantly influenced the gelation domains, the gel&#8208;to&#8208;sol transition temperatures, the microstructures formed in the xerogel state as well as their spectroscopic properties (absorption and emission).







Abstract
Two&#8208;component organogels and xerogels based on a C3&#8208;symmetric pyrene&#8208;containing gelator have been deeply characterized through a wide range of techniques. Based on the formation of charge transfer complexes, the gelation phenomenon proved to be highly dependent on the nature of the electron poor dopant. This parameter significantly influenced the corresponding gelation domains, the critical gelation concentrations of acceptor dopants, the gel&#8208;to&#8208;sol transition temperatures, the microstructures formed in the xerogel state and their spectroscopic properties. In particular, titrations and variable&#8208;temperature UV&#8211;visible absorption spectroscopy demonstrated the key role of donor&#8211;acceptor interactions with a remarkable correlation between the phase transition temperatures and the disappearance of the characteristic charge transfer bands. The assignment of these electronic transitions was confirmed through time&#8208;dependent density functional theory (TD&#8208;DFT) calculations. Eventually, it was shown that the luminescent properties of these materials can be tuned with the temperature, either in intensity or emission wavelength.

         <title>Gold(I) Complexation of Phosphanoxy&#8208;Substituted Phosphaalkenes for Activation&#8208;Free LAuCl Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 7, Page 2469-2475, February 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phosphanoxy&#8208;substituted phosphaalkenes are employed to develop the chemistry of LAuCl complexes. The bis(chlorogold) complexes displayed conformational isomerism, and the relatively sensitive P(sp2)&#8722;Au bonding was effective for activation&#8208;free gold catalysis. Even the mono(chlorogold) complexes including the Au&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;P=C pseudo coordination interaction enabled activation&#8208;free reactions including with alcohols.







Abstract
The phosphanoxy&#8208;substituted phosphaalkene bearing the P=C&#8722;O&#8722;P skeleton can be prepared from diphosphene Mes*P=PMes* (Mes*=2,4,6&#8208;tBu3C6H2), and their use for catalysis is of interest. In this paper, complexation of the phosphanoxy&#8208;substituted phosphaalkenes with gold are investigated, and the catalytic activity of the mono&#8208; and bis(chlorogold) complexes are subsequently evaluated. Reaction of the P=C&#8722;O&#8722;P compound with (tht)AuCl (tht=tetrahydrothiophene) showed dominant coordination on the sp3 phosphorus, and complete coordination on the sp2 phosphorus required removal of tetrahydrothiophene. Atoms In Molecules (AIM) analysis based on the X&#8208;ray structure of the mono(chlorogold) complex indicated a pseudo coordinating interaction between the gold center and the P=C unit. The bis(chlorogold) complexes displayed conformational isomerism, and catalyzed the cycloisomerization/alkoxycyclization of 1,6&#8208;enyne and for hydration of terminal alkyne without activation treatment. Even the mono(chlorogold) complexes catalyzed the alkoxycyclization reactions without a silver co&#8208;catalyst, indicating that the alcohols were effective in activating the AuCl unit.

         <title>Development of ADPribosyl Ubiquitin Analogues to Study Enzymes Involved in Legionella Infection</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 7, Page 2506-2512, February 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modular modifications: Analogues of ADPribosylated ubiquitin, including a nonhydrolyzable methylenebisphosphonate version, are constructed and subsequently applied to investigate (de&#8208;)ubiquitinating enzymes involved in Legionella infection. These probes are used in the study of the bacterial effector DupA and the human ubiquitin activating E1 enzyme.







Abstract
Legionnaires&#8217; disease is caused by infection with the intracellularly replicating Gram&#8208;negative bacterium Legionella pneumophila. This pathogen uses an unconventional way of ubiquitinating host proteins by generating a phosphoribosyl linkage between substrate proteins and ubiquitin by making use of an ADPribosylated ubiquitin (UbADPr) intermediate. The family of SidE effector enzymes that catalyze this reaction is counteracted by Legionella hydrolases, which are called Dups. This unusual ubiquitination process is important for Legionella proliferation and understanding these processes on a molecular level might prove invaluable in finding new treatments. Herein, a modular approach is used for the synthesis of triazole&#8208;linked UbADPr, and analogues thereof, and their affinity towards the hydrolase DupA is determined and hydrolysis rates are compared to natively linked UbADPr. The inhibitory effects of modified Ub on the canonical eukaryotic E1&#8208;enzyme Uba1 are investigated and rationalized in the context of a high&#8208;resolution crystal structure reported herein. Finally, it is shown that synthetic UbADPr analogues can be used to effectively pull&#8208;down overexpressed DupA from cell lysate.

Finally, it is shown that synthetic Ub&lt;sup&gt;ADPr&lt;/sup&gt; analogues can be used to effectively pull&#8208;down overexpressed DupA from cell lysate.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Visible Light Promoted, Catalyst&#8208;Free Radical Carbohydroxylation and Carboetherification under Mild Biomimetic Conditions</title>

Getting radical with light: As shown in this work, Meerwein&#8208;type carbooxygenations can be conducted under fully biocompatible conditions, including ambient temperature and the absence of catalysts or unnatural additives. Surprisingly, the reactions can be further promoted by visible light irradiation, although the reaction mixtures show only very weak absorptions in the respective wavelength range.







Abstract
Metal and catalyst&#8208;free carbohydroxylations and carboetherifications at room temperature have been achieved by a combination of beneficial factors including high aryl diazonium concentration and visible light irradiation. The acceleration of the reaction by visible light irradiation is particularly remarkable against the background that neither the aryldiazonium salt nor the alkene show absorptions in the respective range of wavelength. These observations point to weak charge transfer interactions between diazonium salt and alkene, which are nevertheless able to considerably influence the reaction course. As highly promising perspective, many more aryldiazonium&#8208;based radical arylations might benefit from simple light irradiation without requiring a photocatalyst or particular additive.

         <title>Synthesis and Coordination Ability of a Donor&#8208;Stabilised Bis&#8208;Phosphinidene</title>

It's a P&#8208;P&#8208;Party! A facile synthetic route to a new form of chelating phosphorous ligand, namely the chelating bis&#8208;phosphinidene XantP2, has been developed, allowing for the gram&#8208;scale synthesis of this novel ligand scaffold. Computational investigations corroborate that each P&#8208;centre holds two lone pairs of electrons, allowing for the binding of multiple metal centres. Initial efforts towards the coordination chemistry of XantP2 are reported.







Abstract
Chelating phosphines have long been a mainstay as efficient directing ligands in transition&#8208;metal catalysis. Low&#8208;valent derivatives, namely chelating phosphinidenes, are to date unknown, and could lead to chelating complexes containing more than one metal centre due to the intrisic capacity of phosphinidenes to bind two metal fragments at one P&#8208;centre. Here we describe the synthesis of the first such chelating bis&#8208;phosphinidene ligand, XantP2 (2), generated by the reduction of a diphosphino xanthene derivative, Xant(PH2)2 (1) with iPrNHC (iPrNHC=[:C{N(iPr)C(H)}2]). Initial studies have shown that this novel chelating ligand can act as a bidentate ligand towards element dihalides (i.e. FeCl2, ZnI2, GeCl2, SnBr2), forming cationic complexes with the tetryl elements. In contrast, XantP2 demonstrates an ability to bind multiple metal centres in the reaction with CuCl, leading to a cationic Cu3P3 ring complex, with Cu centres bridged by phosphinidene arms. Density Functional Theory calculations show that 2 indeed holds 4 lone pairs of electrons, shedding further light on the coordination capacity for this novel ligand class through observation of directionality and hybridisation of these electron pairs.

Abstract
Artificial nucleic acids are widely used in various technologies, such as nucleic acid therapeutics and DNA nanotechnologies requiring excellent duplex&#8208;forming abilities and enhanced nuclease resistance. 2&#8242;&#8208;O,4&#8242;&#8208;C&#8208;Methylene&#8208;bridged nucleic acid/locked nucleic acid (2&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8208;BNA/LNA) with 1,3&#8208;diaza&#8208;2&#8208;oxophenoxazine (BNAP (BH)) was previously reported. Herein, a novel BH analogue, 2&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8208;BNA/LNA with 9&#8208;(2&#8208;aminoethoxy)&#8208;1,3&#8208;diaza&#8208;2&#8208;oxophenoxazine (G&#8208;clamp), named BNAP&#8208;AEO (BAEO), was designed. The BAEO nucleoside was successfully synthesized and incorporated into oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs). ODNs containing BAEO possessed up to 104&#8208;, 152&#8208;, and 11&#8208;fold higher binding affinities for complementary (c) RNA than those of ODNs containing 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxycytidine (C), 2&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8208;BNA/LNA with 5&#8208;methylcytosine (L), or 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyribonucleoside with G&#8208;clamp (PAEO), respectively. Moreover, duplexes formed by ODN bearing BAEO with cDNA and cRNA were thermally stable, even under molecular crowding conditions induced by the addition of polyethylene glycol. Furthermore, ODN bearing BAEO was more resistant to 3&#8242;&#8208;exonuclease than ODNs with phosphorothioate linkages.

         <title>Binding Motifs in the Naked Complexes of Target Amino Acids with an Excerpt of Antitumor Active Biomolecule: An Ion Vibrational Spectroscopy Assay</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 7, Page 2348-2360, February 1, 2021. </description>

Breaking it down: Neat binding motifs governing the interaction of a bioactive molecule (an excerpt of glabrescione&#8197;B) with relevant target amino acids (histidine and lysine) are revealed by IR ion spectroscopy at the level of isolated proton&#8208;bound complexes. These noncovalent interactions play a relevant role in directing the preferred protonation site.







Abstract
The structures of proton&#8208;bound complexes of 5,7&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;4H&#8208;chromen&#8208;4&#8208;one (1) and basic amino acids (AAs), namely, histidine (His) and lysine (Lys), have been examined by means of mass spectrometry coupled with IR ion spectroscopy and quantum chemical calculations. This selection of systems is based on the fact that 1 represents a portion of glabrescione&#8197;B, a natural small molecule of promising antitumor activity, while His and Lys are protein residues lining the cavity of the alleged receptor binding site. These species are thus a model of the bioactive adduct, although clearly the isolated state of the present study bears little resemblance to the complex biological environment. A common feature of [1+AA+H]+ complexes is the presence of a protonated AA bound to neutral 1, in spite of the fact that the gas&#8208;phase basicity of 1 is comparable to those of Lys and His. The carbonyl group of 1 acts as a powerful hydrogen&#8208;bond acceptor. Within [1+AA+H]+ the side&#8208;chain substituents (imidazole group for His and terminal amino group for Lys) present comparable basic properties to those of the &#945;&#8208;amino group, taking part to a cooperative hydrogen&#8208;bond network. Structural assignment, relying on the comparative analysis of the infrared multiple photon dissociation (IRMPD) spectrum and calculated IR spectra for the candidate geometries, derives from an examination over two frequency ranges: 900&#8211;1800 and 2900&#8211;3700&#8197;cm&#8722;1.

     alt="Binding Motifs in the Naked Complexes of Target Amino Acids with an Excerpt of Antitumor Active Biomolecule: An Ion Vibrational Spectroscopy Assay"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Breaking it down&lt;/b&gt;: Neat binding motifs governing the interaction of a bioactive molecule (an excerpt of glabrescione&#8197;B) with relevant target amino acids (histidine and lysine) are revealed by IR ion spectroscopy at the level of isolated proton&#8208;bound complexes. These noncovalent interactions play a relevant role in directing the preferred protonation site.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The structures of proton&#8208;bound complexes of 5,7&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;4&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;chromen&#8208;4&#8208;one (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) and basic amino acids (AAs), namely, histidine (His) and lysine (Lys), have been examined by means of mass spectrometry coupled with IR ion spectroscopy and quantum chemical calculations. This selection of systems is based on the fact that &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; represents a portion of glabrescione&#8197;B, a natural small molecule of promising antitumor activity, while His and Lys are protein residues lining the cavity of the alleged receptor binding site. These species are thus a model of the bioactive adduct, although clearly the isolated state of the present study bears little resemblance to the complex biological environment. A common feature of [&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;+AA+H]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; complexes is the presence of a protonated AA bound to neutral &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;, in spite of the fact that the gas&#8208;phase basicity of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; is comparable to those of Lys and His. The carbonyl group of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; acts as a powerful hydrogen&#8208;bond acceptor. Within [&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;+AA+H]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; the side&#8208;chain substituents (imidazole group for His and terminal amino group for Lys) present comparable basic properties to those of the &#945;&#8208;amino group, taking part to a cooperative hydrogen&#8208;bond network. Structural assignment, relying on the comparative analysis of the infrared multiple photon dissociation (IRMPD) spectrum and calculated IR spectra for the candidate geometries, derives from an examination over two frequency ranges: 900&#8211;1800 and 2900&#8211;3700&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Information gained from the latter one proved especially valuable, for example, pointing to the contribution of species characterized by an unperturbed carboxylic OH or imidazole NH stretching mode.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Asymmetric Ring Opening in a Tetrazine&#8208;Based Ligand Affords a Tetranuclear Opto&#8208;Magnetic Ytterbium Complex</title>

Chemistry is like a box of chocolates: The combination of ytterbium(III), cobaltocene, and 3,6&#8208;dipyrazin&#8208;2&#8208;yl&#8208;1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrazine (bpztz) leads to an unexpected asymmetric ring opening of the central tetrazine, yielding the first lanthanide&#8208;based compound with such an asymmetric opening. A comparison of magnetic and luminescence data with theoretical calculations allowed an accurate and in&#8208;depth comparison of the energy levels of the compound.







Abstract
We report the formation of a tetranuclear lanthanide cluster, [Yb4(bpzch)2(fod)10] (1), which occurs from a serendipitous ring opening of the functionalised tetrazine bridging ligand, bpztz (3,6&#8208;dipyrazin&#8208;2&#8208;yl&#8208;1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrazine) upon reacting with Yb(fod)3 (fod&#8722;=6,6,7,7,8,8,8&#8208;heptafluoro&#8208;2,2&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;3,5&#8208;octandionate). Compound 1 was structurally elucidated via single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography and subsequently magnetically and spectroscopically characterised to analyse its magnetisation dynamics and its luminescence behaviour. Computational studies validate the observed MJ energy levels attained by spectroscopy and provides a clearer picture of the slow relaxation of the magnetisation dynamics and relaxation pathways. These studies demonstrate that 1 acts as a single&#8208;molecule magnet (SMM) under an applied magnetic field in which the relaxation occurs via a combination of Raman, direct, and quantum tunnelling processes, a behaviour further rationalised analysing the luminescent properties. This marks the first lanthanide&#8208;containing molecule that forms by means of an asymmetric tetrazine decomposition.

         <title>Photochemistry with Chlorine Trifluoride: Syntheses and Characterization of Difluorooxychloronium(V) Hexafluorido(non)metallates(V), [ClOF2][MF6] (M=V, Nb, Ta, Ru, Os, Ir, P, Sb)</title>

Pairing up: Compounds of the [ClOF2]+ cation, [ClOF2][MF6], were obtained from photochemical reactions of oxides or of metals and oxygen with chlorine trifluoride. Two different structural types were observed, depending on the effective ionic radius, reff, of the MV ion. The Cl&#8722;O bond lengths of the [ClOF2]+ cations generally correlate with reff(MV) and O/F disorder is observed for the biggest MV ions in the [MF6]&#8722; anions studied.







Abstract
A photochemical route to salts consisting of difluorooxychloronium(V) cations, [ClOF2]+, and hexafluorido(non)metallate(V) anions, [MF6]&#8722; (M=V, Nb, Ta, Ru, Os, Ir, P, Sb) is presented. As starting materials, either metals, oxygen and ClF3 or oxides and ClF3 are used. The prepared compounds were characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy. The crystal structures of [ClOF2][MF6] (M=V, Ru, Os, Ir, P, Sb) are layer structures that are isotypic with the previously reported compound [ClOF2][AsF6], whereas for M=Nb and Ta, similar crystal structures with a different stacking variant of the layers are observed. Additionally, partial or full O/F disorder within the [ClOF2]+ cations of the Nb and Ta compounds occurs. In all compounds reported here, a trigonal pyramidal [ClOF2]+ cation with three additional Cl&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;F contacts to neighboring [MF6]&#8722; anions is observed, resulting in a pseudo&#8208;octahedral coordination sphere around the Cl atom. The Cl&#8722;F and Cl&#8722;O bond lengths of the [ClOF2]+ cations seem to correlate with the effective ionic radii of the MV ions. Quantum&#8208;chemical, solid&#8208;state calculations well reproduce the experimental Raman spectra and show, as do quantum&#8208;chemical gas phase calculations, that the secondary Cl&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;F interactions are ionic in nature. However, both solid&#8208;state and gas&#8208;phase quantum&#8208;chemical calculations fail to reproduce the increases in the Cl&#8722;O bond lengths with increasing effective ionic radius of M in [MF6]&#8722; and the Cl&#8722;O Raman shifts also do not generally follow this trend.

Photocontrollable antibiotic: There is growing interest in the spatiotemporal control of drugs for research and medical applications. To this end, a photocontrollable azobenzene&#8208;based inhibitor of tryptophan synthase, an essential metabolic enzyme complex in bacteria, was designed. Thorough biochemical, crystallographic, and computational analyses elucidated the noncompetitive mode of action of this promising antibiotic lead compound.







Abstract
Light regulation of drug molecules has gained growing interest in biochemical and pharmacological research in recent years. In addition, a serious need for novel molecular targets of antibiotics has emerged presently. Herein, the development of a photocontrollable, azobenzene&#8208;based antibiotic precursor towards tryptophan synthase (TS), an essential metabolic multienzyme complex in bacteria, is presented. The compound exhibited moderately strong inhibition of TS in its E configuration and five times lower inhibition strength in its Z configuration. A combination of biochemical, crystallographic, and computational analyses was used to characterize the inhibition mode of this compound. Remarkably, binding of the inhibitor to a hitherto&#8208;unconsidered cavity results in an unproductive conformation of TS leading to noncompetitive inhibition of tryptophan production. In conclusion, we created a promising lead compound for combatting bacterial diseases, which targets an essential metabolic enzyme, and whose inhibition strength can be controlled with light.

         <title>High&#8208;Efficiency FRET Processes in BODIPY&#8208;Functionalized Quantum Dot Architectures</title>

Fabrication of FRET platforms, formed by colloidal CdSe QDs and fluorescent BODIPY dyes. The successful functionalization of the QD surface by the dye allows to obtain very short distances and high FRET efficiency, both in solution and in the solid state, where the donor and acceptor are deposited in single coupled units.







Abstract
Efficient FRET systems are developed combining colloidal CdSe quantum dots (QDs) donors and BODIPY acceptors. To promote effective energy transfer in FRET architectures, the distance between the organic fluorophore and the QDs needs to be optimized by a careful system engineering. In this context, BODIPY dyes bearing amino&#8208;terminated functionalities are used in virtue of the high affinity of amine groups in coordinating the QD surface. A preliminary QD surface treatment with a short amine ligand is performed to favor the interaction with the organic fluorophores in solution. The successful coordination of the dye to the QD surface, accomplishing a short donor&#8211;acceptor distance, provides effective energy transfer already in solution, with efficiency of 76&#8201;%. The efficiency further increases in the solid state where the QDs and the dye are deposited as single coordinated units from solution, with a distance between the fluorophores down to 2.2&#8197;nm, demonstrating the effectiveness of the coupling strategy.

         <title>Manufacturing Reusable NAND Logic Gates and Their Initial Circuits for DNA Nanoprocessors</title>

Binary bases: A new NAND gate consists of four functional DNA fragments attached to a crossover tile. The fragments form a catalytically active deoxyribozyme complex, which cleaves fluorogenic substrate (F sub) thus producing high fluorescence (digital 1). The complex decomposes if two inputs are added, thus leading to a low signal (digital 0).







Abstract
DNA&#8208;based computers can potentially analyze complex sets of biological markers, thereby advancing diagnostics and the treatment of diseases. Despite extensive efforts, DNA processors have not yet been developed due, in part, to limitations in the ability to integrate available logic gates into circuits. We have designed a NAND gate, which is one of the functionally complete set of logic connectives. The gate's design avoids stem&#8208;loop&#8208;folded DNA fragments, and is capable of reusable operations in RNase&#8197;H&#8208;containing buffer. The output of the gate can be translated into RNA&#8208;cleaving activity or a fluorescent signal produced either by a deoxyribozyme or a molecular beacon probe. Furthermore, three NAND&#8208;gate&#8208;forming DNA strands were crosslinked by click chemistry and purified in a simple procedure that allowed &#8776;1013 gates to be manufactured in 16&#8197;h, with a hands&#8208;on time of about 30&#8197;min. Two NAND gates can be joined into one association that performs a new logic function simply by adding a DNA linker strand. Approaches developed in this work could contribute to the development of biocompatible DNA logic circuits for biotechnological and medical applications.

         <title>&#960;&#8208;Extended Diaza[7]helicenes by Hybridization of Naphthalene Diimides and Hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;hexabenzocoronenes</title>

Super naphthalene, super helix: A diaza[7]helicene was formed as the only isomer via the fusion of two naphthalene diimides (NDIs) to a hexabenzocorene (HBC) core, generating a fully conjugated superstructure with a wide lateral &#960;&#8208;extension of the inner heterohelix. The helical twist brings along an attractive spatial arrangement and affects the chemical and photophysical features. Isolation of the corresponding enantiomers was accomplished by HPLC on a chiral stationary phase and the absolute configurations were determined by comparison of their circular dichroism spectra with quantum mechanical calculations.







Abstract
The synthesis of an unprecedented, &#960;&#8208;extended hexabenzocorene (HBC)&#8208;based diaza[7]helicene is presented. The target compound was synthesized by an ortho&#8208;fusion of two naphthalene diimide (NDI) units to a HBC&#8208;skeleton. A combination of Diels&#8211;Alder and Scholl&#8208;type oxidation reactions involving a symmetric di&#8208;NDI&#8208;tolane precursor were crucial for the very selective formation of the helical superstructure via a hexaphenyl&#8208;benzene (HPB) derivative. The formation of the diaza[7]helicene moiety in the final Scholl oxidation is favoured, affording the symmetric &#960;&#8208;extended helicene as the major product as a pair of enantiomers. The separation of the enantiomers was successfully accomplished by HPLC involving a chiral stationary phase. The absolute configuration of the enantiomers was assigned by comparison of circular dichroism spectra with quantum mechanical calculations.

On the dot: Unveiling the relation between structure and optical properties is one of the most intriguing challenges in polymeric carbon dots (CPDs). Most of CPDs present high quantum yields (QYs) but the structures are still under debate. In this work, a new type of CPDs from citric acid and 2&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8208;(hydroxymethyl)propane&#8208;1,3&#8208;diol with a QY of 80&#8201;% and the correlation of the fluorescence efficiency with the structure are discussed.







Abstract
Carbonized polymer dots (CPDs), a peculiar type of carbon dots, show extremely high quantum yields, making them very attractive nanostructures for application in optics and biophotonics. The origin of the strong photoluminescence of CPDs resides in a complicated interplay of several radiative mechanisms. To understand the correlation between CPD processing and properties, the early stage formation of carbonized polymer dots has been studied. In the synthesis, citric acid monohydrate and 2&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8208;(hydroxymethyl)propane&#8208;1,3&#8208;diol have been thermally degraded at 180&#8201;&#176;C. The use of an oil bath instead of a more traditional hydrothermal reactor has allowed the CPD properties to be monitored at different reactions times. Transmission electron microscopy, time&#8208;resolved photoluminescence, nuclear magnetic resonance, infrared, and Raman spectroscopy have revealed the formation of polymeric species with amide and ester bonds. Quantum chemistry calculations have been employed to investigate the origin of CPD electronic transitions. At short reaction times, amorphous C&#8208;dots with 80&#8201;% quantum yield, have been obtained.

         <title>Probing &#945;&#8208;Amino Aldehydes as Weakly Acidic Pronucleophiles: Direct Access to Quaternary &#945;&#8208;Amino Aldehydes by an Enantioselective Michael Addition Catalyzed by Br&#248;nsted Bases</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 7, Page 2483-2492, February 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Harnessing limitations: The ease with which &#945;&#8208;amino aldehydes racemize is the starting point for their utilization beyond the limits of their essentially exclusive use as electrophiles, as exemplified in the reaction of N&#8208;alkoxycarbonyl &#945;&#8208;amino aldehydes with nitroolefins. This reaction is assisted by a weak bifunctional Br&#248;nsted base to give quaternary &#945;&#8208;amino aldehydes with an adjacent ternary stereogenic center.







Abstract
The high tendency of &#945;&#8208;amino aldehydes to undergo 1,2&#8208;additions and their relatively low stability under basic conditions have largely prevented their use as pronucleophiles in the realm of asymmetric catalysis, particularly for the production of quaternary &#945;&#8208;amino aldehydes. Herein, it is demonstrated that the chemistry of &#945;&#8208;amino aldehydes may be expanded beyond these limits by documenting the first direct &#945;&#8208;alkylation of &#945;&#8208;branched &#945;&#8208;amino aldehydes with nitroolefins. The reaction produces densely functionalized products bearing up to two, quaternary and tertiary, vicinal stereocenters with high diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivity. DFT modeling leads to the proposal that intramolecular hydrogen bonding between the NH group and the carbonyl oxygen atom in the starting &#945;&#8208;amino aldehyde is key for reaction stereocontrol.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Harnessing limitations&lt;/b&gt;: The ease with which &#945;&#8208;amino aldehydes racemize is the starting point for their utilization beyond the limits of their essentially exclusive use as electrophiles, as exemplified in the reaction of N&#8208;alkoxycarbonyl &#945;&#8208;amino aldehydes with nitroolefins. This reaction is assisted by a weak bifunctional Br&#248;nsted base to give quaternary &#945;&#8208;amino aldehydes with an adjacent ternary stereogenic center.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The high tendency of &#945;&#8208;amino aldehydes to undergo 1,2&#8208;additions and their relatively low stability under basic conditions have largely prevented their use as pronucleophiles in the realm of asymmetric catalysis, particularly for the production of quaternary &#945;&#8208;amino aldehydes. Herein, it is demonstrated that the chemistry of &#945;&#8208;amino aldehydes may be expanded beyond these limits by documenting the first direct &#945;&#8208;alkylation of &#945;&#8208;branched &#945;&#8208;amino aldehydes with nitroolefins. The reaction produces densely functionalized products bearing up to two, quaternary and tertiary, vicinal stereocenters with high diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivity. DFT modeling leads to the proposal that intramolecular hydrogen bonding between the NH group and the carbonyl oxygen atom in the starting &#945;&#8208;amino aldehyde is key for reaction stereocontrol.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Computational Mapping of Dirhodium(II) Catalysts</title>

A knowledge base for dirhodium(II) catalysts, capturing their stereoelectronic properties, maps the relevant catalyst space and supports catalyst selection.







Abstract
The chemistry of dirhodium(II) catalysts is highly diverse, and can enable the synthesis of many different molecular classes. A tool to aid in catalyst selection, independent of mechanism and reactivity, would therefore be highly desirable. Here, we describe the development of a database for dirhodium(II) catalysts that is based on the principal component analysis of DFT&#8208;calculated parameters capturing their steric and electronic properties. This database maps the relevant catalyst space, and may facilitate exploration of the reactivity landscape for any process catalysed by dirhodium(II) complexes. We have shown that one of the principal components of these catalysts correlates with the outcome (e.g. yield, selectivity) of a transformation used in a molecular discovery project. Furthermore, we envisage that this approach will assist the selection of more effective catalyst screening sets, and, hence, the data&#8208;led optimisation of a wide range of rhodium&#8208;catalysed transformations.

         <title>A Carbocationic Triarylmethane&#8208;Based Porous Covalent Organic Network</title>

The carbocationic covalent organic network called RIO&#8208;70, obtained from inexpensive building blocks (a dye and a product derived from phloroglucinol), is a microporous material, with a specific surface area of 990&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1. It is a thermally stable, visible light&#8208;absorbing material and semiconductor (optical band gap of 2.9&#8197;eV) with a CO2 uptake of 2.14&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1 (0.5&#8197;bar), 2.7&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1 (1&#8197;bar), and 6.8&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1 (20&#8197;bar), and is potentially interesting as a sensor or photocatalyst.







Abstract
A thermally stable carbocationic covalent organic network (CON), named RIO&#8208;70 was prepared from pararosaniline hydrochloride, an inexpensive dye, and triformylphloroglucinol in solvothermal conditions. This nanoporous organic material has shown a specific surface area of 990&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1 and pore size of 10.3&#8197;&#197;. The material has CO2 uptake of 2.14&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1 (0.5&#8197;bar), 2.7&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1 (1&#8197;bar), and 6.8&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1 (20&#8197;bar), the latter corresponding to 3&#8201;CO2 molecules adsorbed per pore per sheet. It is shown to be a semiconductor, with electrical conductivity (&#963;) of 3.17&#215;10&#8722;7&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1, which increases to 5.26&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 upon exposure to I2 vapor. DFT calculations using periodic conditions support the findings.

         <title>Frontispiece: Artificial Water Channels: Towards Biomimetic Membranes for Desalination</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 7, February 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aquaporins (AQPs) are biological water channels known for fast water transport, with complete ion exclusion. Artificial water channels (AWCs) have been designed to mimic the high water permeability and to reject ions at a significant level in bilayer membranes. This Review by M. Barboiu et&#8197;al. on page 2224 discuss the incipient developments of the first biomimetic membranes and their water filtration performances using AWCs and natural strategies to implement new paradigms for desalination.

Visible&#8208;light photoredox&#8208;catalyzed transformation of carbon dioxide has emerged as a privileged technique for forging C&#8722;C and C&#8722;X bonds. Both nucleophilic and electrophilic activation of CO2 by visible&#8208;light photocatalysis enable efficient access of essential functionalities. The easy access of pervasive CO2 can readily be incorporated into various synthetic organic motifs, delivering value&#8208;added products. The advancements of visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated photoredox&#8208;catalyzed processes for CO2 fixation onto organic matters are elaborately discussed, especially focusing on reports from 2018 to 2020. For more details see the Minireview by I. Chatterjee, B. Sahoo, et&#8197;al. on page 2254.

         <title>Frontispiece: First Tribo&#8208;Excited Chemical Reaction of a Stacked Lanthanide Coordination Polymer with an in Situ Reaction Monitor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 7, February 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tribo&#8208;excited chemical reaction using a lanthanide coordination polymer for the first time is reported in this work. The polymer is composed of a EuIII complex (tribo&#8208;excitation unit) and an anthracene&#8208;based phosphine oxide linker (reactant). The mechanical stimulus leads to tribo&#8208;excited oxidation in the EuIII coordination polymer. The first demonstration of tribo&#8208;excited chemical reaction using lanthanide coordination polymer open&#8208;up a new scientific fundamental door for development of physical chemistry, material chemistry, and new organic chemical reaction.

     alt="Frontispiece: First Tribo&#8208;Excited Chemical Reaction of a Stacked Lanthanide Coordination Polymer with an in Situ Reaction Monitor"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A tribo&#8208;excited chemical reaction&lt;/b&gt; using a lanthanide coordination polymer for the first time is reported in this work. The polymer is composed of a Eu&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; complex (tribo&#8208;excitation unit) and an anthracene&#8208;based phosphine oxide linker (reactant). The mechanical stimulus leads to tribo&#8208;excited oxidation in the Eu&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; coordination polymer. The first demonstration of tribo&#8208;excited chemical reaction using lanthanide coordination polymer open&#8208;up a new scientific fundamental door for development of physical chemistry, material chemistry, and new organic chemical reaction.

A hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;hexabenzocoronen based diaza[7]helicene was synthesized featuring a wide lateral &#960;&#8208;extension of the inner helix. This was guaranteed by hybridization with two naphthaleneimide moieties. The helical superstructure was formed as the only isomer during final Scholl oxidation with remarkable selectivity. Successful separation of the enantiomers allowed for the detailed analysis of the chemical, optical and chiroptical properties, which were supported by quantum mechanical calculations. The cover image was designed by Cornelius Weiss. More information can be found in the Full Paper by A. Hirsch et&#8197;al. on page 2332.

The recognition of a guest Na+ ion significantly accelerated the AcO&#8722;&#8208;mediated gate&#8208;opening of a closed dicobalt(III) macrocyclic metallohost [LCo2(hda)2]2+, which has two bridging 1,6&#8208;hexanediamine (hda) ligands, yielding an open host&#8212;guest complex [LCo2(hda)2(OAc)&#8901;Na]2+. Since the closed complex [LCo2(hda)2]2+ was prepared by gate&#8208;closing of an open complex, [LCo2(pip)4]2+ (pip=piperidine), the two&#8208;step conversion efficiently controls the guest recognition behavior of the dicobalt metallohost.

It looks alike, still not the same! A phosphonate amino acid is introduced as a stable analogue of the intrinsically labile phosphorylated lysine for the straightforward incorporation into synthetic peptides. The &#8216;mirror&#8217; in the cover image&#8212;which is not a mirror&#8212;plays with physics and tricks the mind. Similarly, the phosphonate amino acid mimics phosphorylated lysine and may trick nature as a potential interactor for phospho&#8208;lysine interacting enzymes (illustration by Dr. Barth van Rossum).

A sustainable COOL technique: The fixation of ubiquitous and naturally abundant carbon dioxide as a C1&#8208;feedstock onto organic staples delivering commodity chemicals and consumer products has an impactful influence on sustainable chemistry. This Minireview mainly highlights the emerging reports on CO2 incorporation reactions using light&#8208;harvesting photoredox catalysis for C&#8722;C and C&#8722;X bond&#8208;forming reactions for the synthesis of carboxylic acid derivatives and heterocyclic compounds.







Abstract
CO2 is a highly abundant, green, and sustainable carbon feedstock. Despite its kinetic inertness and thermodynamic stability, the development of various catalytic techniques has enabled the conversion of CO2 to value&#8208;added products such as carboxylic acids, amino acids, and heterocyclic compounds, where visible&#8208;light photocatalysis has emerged to be an efficient promoter of these processes. This Minireview covers the progress in the areas of CO2 incorporation onto organic matters based on the combined venture of renewable resources of CO2 and light energy with significant emphasis on the last three years&#8217; developments.

         <title>The Role of Fluorine in Glycomimetic Drug Design</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 7, Page 2240-2253, February 1, 2021. </description>

F in glycomimetic drug design: Fluorination is becoming increasingly common in newly approved drugs, and its incorporation into glycomimetics offers some unique advantages. Fluorination is known to overcome many challenges traditionally associated with carbohydrate&#8208;based pharmaceuticals, for example, by reducing polar surface area and slowing metabolic degradation. This review summarizes the main effects of introducing fluorine to help with designing the most suitable glycomimetic candidates.







Abstract
Glycans are well established to play important roles at various stages of infection and disease, and ways to modulate these interactions have been sought as novel therapies. The use of native glycan structures has met with limited success, which can be attributed to their characteristic high polarity (e.g., low binding affinities) and inherently poor pharmacokinetic properties (e.g., short drug&#8211;target residence times, rapid renal excretion), leading to the development of &#8242;glycomimetics&#8242;. Fluorinated drugs have become increasingly common over recent decades, with fluorinated glycomimetics offering some unique advantages. Deoxyfluorination maintains certain electrostatic interactions, while concomitantly reducing net polarity through &#8242;polar hydrophobicity&#8242;, improving residence times and binding affinities. Fluorination destabilizes the oxocarbenium transition state associated with metabolic degradation, and can restore exo&#8208; and endo&#8208;anomeric effects in C&#8208;glycosides and carbasugars. Lastly, it has shown great utility in radiotracer development and enhancement of antigenicity in glycan&#8208;based vaccines. Owing to synthetic challenges, fluorinated glycomimetics have been somewhat underutilized to date, but methodological improvements will advance their use in glycomimetic drugs.

         <title>Artificial Water Channels: Towards Biomimetic Membranes for Desalination</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 7, Page 2224-2239, February 1, 2021. </description>

Desalination membranes: The prime objective of Artificial Water Channels (AWC) is to explore the naturally evolved water translocation pathways and assess the possibilities of using them as the basis for &#8216;engineered&#8217; desalination processes of enhanced performance. This review proposes to find an easily scalable AWC approach that could be immediately applied to desalination systems to increase their energy efficiency.







Abstract
Natural Aquaporin (AQP) channels are efficient water translocating proteins, rejecting ions. Inspired by this masterpiece of nature, Artificial Water Channels (AWCs) with controlled functional structures, can be potentially used to mimic the AQPs to a certain extent, offering flexible avenues toward biomimetic membranes for water purification. The objective of this paper is to trace the historical development and significant advancements of current reported AWCs. Meanwhile, we attempt to reveal important structural insights and supramolecular self&#8208;assembly principles governing the selective water transport mechanisms, toward innovative AWC&#8208;based biomimetic membranes for desalination.

         <title>Photoactive Nickel Complexes in Cross&#8208;Coupling Catalysis</title>

Photo&#8208;excited about Ni: Photophysically and photochemically relevant aspects of light&#8208;driven cross&#8208;coupling reactions by nickel catalysis are reviewed. The importance of energetically low&#8208;lying triplet excited states is highlighted, along with recent key findings in light&#8208;driven nickel catalysis. Essential concepts for the use of photoactive nickel complexes in organic synthesis are identified.







Abstract
Transition metal catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions are important in chemical synthesis for the formation of C&#8722;C and C&#8208;heteroatom bonds. Suitable catalysts are frequently based on palladium or nickel, and lately the cheaper and more abundant first&#8208;row transition metal element has been much in focus. The combination of nickel catalysis with photoredox chemistry has opened new synthetic possibilities, and in some cases electronically excited states of nickel complexes play a key role. This is a remarkable finding, because photo&#8208;excited metal complexes are underexplored in the context of organic bond&#8208;forming reactions, and because the photophysics and the photochemistry of first&#8208;row transition metal complexes are underdeveloped in comparison with their precious metal&#8208;based congeners. Consequently, there is much potential for innovation at the interface of synthetic&#8208;organic and physical&#8208;inorganic chemistry. This Minireview highlights recent key findings in light&#8208;driven nickel catalysis and identifies essential concepts for the exploitation of photoactive nickel complexes in organic synthesis.

         <title>First Tribo&#8208;Excited Chemical Reaction of a Stacked Lanthanide Coordination Polymer with an in Situ Reaction Monitor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 7, Page 2279-2283, February 1, 2021. </description>

The first tribo&#8208;excited chemical reaction of a stacked lanthanide coordination polymer with an in situ reaction monitor is reported in this work.







Abstract
A tribo&#8208;excited chemical reaction using a stacked lanthanide coordination polymer is demonstrated for the first time. The polymer is composed of a EuIII ion, hexafluoroacetylacetonato ligands, and an anthracene&#8208;based phosphine oxide bridge. The tightly stacked structure with hydrogen bonding was characterized by X&#8208;ray crystal structure analysis. The mechanical stimulus leads to tribo&#8208;excited oxidation in the EuIII coordination polymer. Electron ionization mass spectroscopy and photo&#8208;spectroscopic analysis reveal that the chemical product afforded by tribo&#8208;oxidation is different from that obtained by photo&#8208;oxidation.

         <title>Guest Recognition Control Accompanied by Stepwise Gate Closing and Opening of a Macrocyclic Metallohost</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 7, Page 2284-2288, February 1, 2021. </description>

When one door closes: The post&#8208;metalation modification method is utilized for a two&#8208;step conversion of a dicobalt(III) macrocyclic metallohost. The starting open complex, [LCo2(pip)4]2+, is efficiently converted to the closed complex, [LCo2(hda)2]2+, which is then converted to the open complex [LCo2(hda)2(OAc)]+. The gate&#8208;opening in the second step is dramatically accelerated by the addition of Na+, and the Na+ binding is also significantly enhanced by the gate&#8208;opening.







Abstract
Host&#8211;guest binding behavior of macrocyclic hosts is significantly influenced by the shapes and sizes of the hosts. In particular, closing/opening the apertures of the hosts controls the guest uptake/release. A post&#8208;metalation modification method was used to achieve the open/close conversions. The starting open complex, [LCo2(pip)4](OTf)2, was efficiently converted to the closed complex, [LCo2(hda)2](OTf)2, which has a doubly bridged structure. The conversion of this closed complex to the open complex [LCo2(hda)2(OAc)]+ was too slow to be completed, but this gate&#8208;opening was dramatically accelerated by the addition of Na+. The Na+ binding was also significantly enhanced by the gate&#8208;opening, that is, conversion of [LCo2(hda)2]2+ to [LCo2(hda)2(OAc)]+.

2,2&#8217;&#8208;Bipyridine ligands (dsbpys) with dumbbell&#8208;like shapes and differently substituted triarylmethyl groups at the C5 and C5&#8217; positions showed high ligand performance in the Ni&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;electrophile coupling and the Ni/photoredox&#8208;synergistically catalyzed decarboxylative coupling reactions (see figure). The superior ligand effects of dsbpys compared to the conventional bpy ligands were attributed to the monochelating nature of dsbpys.

         <title>Neutral Chiral Tetrakis&#8208;Iodo&#8208;Triazole Halogen&#8208;Bond Donor for Chiral Recognition and Enantioselective Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 7, Page 2315-2320, February 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Halogen bonding interactions at work: This work presents a novel chiral tetrakis&#8208;iodo&#8208;triazole as neutral halogen bond donor able to differentiate chiral dicarboxylates and induce chirality in an anion&#8208;binding catalytic reaction. An inversion of chiral recognition, enantioselectivity and CD spectra compared to its parent hydrogen donor was observed and examined by DFT calculations, providing a hint on relevant halogen donor complex structures in solution.







Abstract
Halogen bonding represents a powerful tool in the field of noncovalent interactions. However, applications in enantioselective recognition and catalysis remain almost nonexistent, due in part to the distinct features of halogen bonds, including long covalent and noncovalent bond distances and high directionality. Herein, this work presents a novel chiral tetrakis&#8208;iodo&#8208;triazole structure as a neutral halogen bond donor for both chiral anion&#8208;recognition and enantioinduction in ion&#8208;pair organocatalysis. NMR&#8208;titration studies revealed significant differences in anion affinity between the halogen bonding receptor and its hydrogen bonding parent. Selective recognition of chiral dicarboxylates and asymmetric induction in a benchmark organocatalytic reaction were demonstrated using the halogen bond donor. Inversions in the absolute sense of chiral recognition, enantioselectivity, and chiroptical properties relative to the related hydrogen donor were observed. Computational modeling suggested that these effects were the result of distinct anion&#8208;binding modes for the halogen&#8208; versus hydrogen&#8208;bond donors.

         <title>Systematic Structural Characterization of Chitooligosaccharides Enabled by Automated Glycan Assembly</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 7, Page 2321-2325, February 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Automated glycan assembly was employed to prepare a collection of chitooligosaccharides with full control over length, fraction, and pattern of acetylation. Systematic structural studies, based on molecular dynamics simulations and NMR experiments, revealed intramolecular interactions responsible for the stabilization of particular conformations.







Abstract
Chitin, a polymer composed of &#946;(1&#8211;4)&#8208;linked N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;glucosamine monomers, and its partially deacetylated analogue chitosan, are abundant biopolymers with outstanding mechanical as well as elastic properties. Their degradation products, chitooligosaccharides (COS), can trigger the innate immune response in humans and plants. Both material and biological properties are dependent on polymer length, acetylation, as well as the pH. Without well&#8208;defined samples, a complete molecular description of these factors is still missing. Automated glycan assembly (AGA) enabled rapid access to synthetic well&#8208;defined COS. Chitin&#8208;cellulose hybrid oligomers were prepared as important tools for a systematic structural analysis. Intramolecular interactions, identified by molecular dynamics simulations and NMR analysis, underscore the importance of the chitosan amino group for the stabilization of specific geometries.

         <title>[2]Catenane Synthesis via Covalent Templating</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 7, Page 2310-2314, February 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A covalent template strategy for the synthesis of mechanically interlocked molecules has been successfully employed to give a [2]catenane. This approach results in a [2]catenane devoid of supramolecular recognition sites. An inverted spiro intermediate is formed due to the action of a covalent template, which enforces an otherwise unfavorable macrocyclization. The trapped thread could be clipped into a second macrocycle giving a precatenane and, upon cleavage of the covalent templating linkages, the [2]catenane architecture.







Abstract
After earlier unsuccessful attempts, this work reports the application of covalent templating for the synthesis of mechanically interlocked molecules (MiMs) bearing no supramolecular recognition sites. Two linear strands were covalently connected in a perpendicular fashion by a central ketal linkage. After subsequent attachment of the first strand to a template via temporary benzylic linkages, the second was linked to the template in a backfolding macrocyclization. The resulting pseudo[1]rotaxane structure was successfully converted to a [2]catenane via a second macrocyclization and cleavage of the ketal and temporary linkages.

         <title>Glycine&#8208;Functionalized CsPbBr3 Nanocrystals for Efficient Visible&#8208;Light Photocatalysis of CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 7, Page 2305-2309, February 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ligand exchange: Glycine&#8208;functionalized CsPbBr3 nanocrystals are constructed through a facile ligand&#8208;exchange strategy. They exhibit a significantly improved yield of 27.7&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 for photocatalytic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion coupled with water oxidation, which is over five times higher than that of control CsPbBr3 with conventional long alkyl&#8208;chain capping ligands.







Abstract
Capping ligands are indispensable for the preparation of metal&#8208;halide&#8208;perovskite (MHP) nanocrystals (NCs) with good stability; however, the long alkyl&#8208;chain capping ligands in conventional MHP NCs will be unfavorable for CO2 adsorption and hinder the efficient carrier separation on the surface of MHP NCs, leading to inferior catalytic activity in artificial photosynthesis. Herein, CsPbBr3 nanocrystals with short&#8208;chain glycine as ligand are constructed through a facile ligand&#8208;exchange strategy. Owing to the reduced hindrance of glycine and the presence of the amine group in glycine, the photogenerated carrier separation and CO2 uptake capacity are noticeably improved without compromising the stability of the MHP NCs. The CsPbBr3 nanocrystals with glycine ligands exhibit a significantly increased yield of 27.7&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 for photocatalytic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion without any organic sacrificial reagents, which is over five times higher than that of control CsPbBr3 NCs with conventional long alkyl&#8208;chain capping ligands.

The CsPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; nanocrystals with glycine ligands exhibit a significantly increased yield of 27.7&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; for photocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion without any organic sacrificial reagents, which is over five times higher than that of control CsPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; NCs with conventional long alkyl&#8208;chain capping ligands.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Generation of &#945;&#8208;Boryl Radicals and Their Conjugate Addition to Enones: Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free Alkylation of gem&#8208;Diborylalkanes</title>

&#945;&#8208;Boryl radicals have been generated with the aid of catechol and oxidant from gem&#8208;diborylalkanes The &#945;&#8208;boryl radicals are subsequently engaged in conjugate addition reaction with &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones to afford &#947;&#8208;borylketones.







Abstract
A transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free method for the alkylation of gem&#8208;diborylalkanes with &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones has been developed. It is demonstrated that the &#945;&#8208;boryl radicals can be generated efficiently from gem&#8208;diborylalkanes with the aid of catechol and oxidants. The &#945;&#8208;boryl radicals formed through such process can be engaged in conjugate addition reaction with &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones. This transformation is a straightforward method for the synthesis of &#947;&#8208;borylketones.

         <title>In Situ Labeling and Distance Measurements of Membrane Proteins in E. coli Using Finland and OX063 Trityl Labels</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 7, Page 2299-2304, February 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Observing membrane proteins in the cellular environment is a difficult task and PELDOR/DEER spectroscopy is a versatile tool for this purpose. The nitroxide spin labels suffer from poor stability and sensitivity in cellular environments. Trityls are emerging as promising tags for in situ PELDOR/DEER. Here we show that FTAM and OX063 labels provide superior sensitivity and selectivity for distance measurements of membrane proteins in E. coli.







Abstract
In situ investigation of membrane proteins is a challenging task. Previously we demonstrated that nitroxide labels combined with pulsed ESR spectroscopy is a promising tool for this purpose. However, the nitroxide labels suffer from poor stability, high background labeling, and low sensitivity. Here we show that Finland (FTAM) and OX063 based labels enable labeling of the cobalamin transporter BtuB and BamA, the central component of the &#946;&#8208;barrel assembly machinery (BAM) complex, in E coli. Compared to the methanethiosulfonate spin label (MTSL), trityl labels eliminated the background signals and enabled specific in situ labeling of the proteins with high efficiency. The OX063 labels show a long phase memory time (TM) of &#8776;5&#8197;&#956;s. All the trityls enabled distance measurements between BtuB and an orthogonally labeled substrate with high selectivity and sensitivity down to a few &#956;m concentration. Our data corroborate the BtuB and BamA conformations in the cellular environment of E. coli.

         <title>Covalency in Actinide Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organometallics tricks for actinide extended structures: Covalency in actinide complexes has long been studied for both its fundamental interest and potential applications for minor actinides separation. In this concept paper, covalency in actinides is introduced and illustrated with several examples from the current literature. It is shown that actinide chalcogenide extended structures may serve as auxiliary platforms for studying covalency.







Abstract
Covalency in actinides has emerged as a resounding research topic on account of the technological importance in separating minor actinides from lanthanides for spent nuclear fuel processing, and utilization of their distinct bonding properties has been realized as a route towards overcoming this challenge. Because of the limited radial extent of the 4f orbitals, there is almost no 4f electron participation in bonding in lanthanides; this is not the case for the actinides, which have extended 5f orbitals that are capable of overlapping with ligand orbitals, although not to the degree of overlap as in the d orbitals of transition metals. In this concept paper, a general description of covalency in actinide compounds is provided. After introducing two main approaches to enhance covalency, either by exploiting increased orbital overlap or decreasing energy differences between the orbitals causing orbital energy degeneracy, the current state of the field is illustrated by using several examples from the recent literature. This paper is concluded by proposing the use of actinide chalcogenides as a convenient auxiliary tool to study covalency in actinide compounds.

         <title>Preparation of Functionalized Carbon&#8208;Coated Cobalt Nanoparticles with Sulfonated Arene Derivatives, a Study on Surface Functionalization and Stability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sulfonated magnetic nanoparticles may be used as catalysts or potentially as anticoagulants in blood. To achieve high activities, a high loading of sulfonate groups is desired. In this article we investigated the maximization of covalent functionalized sulfonate groups on the surface of carbon&#8208;coated cobalt nanoparticles, assessed their stability and investigated the activity towards ring opening polymerization of glycidol.







Abstract
The functionalization of magnetic nanoparticles has been an important field in the last decade due to the versatile applications in catalysis and biomedicine. Generally, a high degree of functionalities on the surface of the nanoparticles is desired. In this study, covalent functionalization of various aromatic sulfonic acids on carbon&#8208;coated cobalt nanoparticles are investigated on surface functionalization yield and stability. The nanoparticles are prepared via covalent linkage of an in situ generated diazonium on the graphene&#8208;like surface. Adsorption and wash experiments were performed to confirm a covalent bonding of the naphthalene derivatives on the nanoparticle surface. With an increased number of sulfonic acid groups on the aromatic compound a significantly lower loading is observed on the corresponding functionalized nanoparticles. This can be counteracted by a change of nitrite species. With this method, nanoparticles with a high number of sulfonic acid groups can be produced.

Adsorption and wash experiments were performed to confirm a covalent bonding of the naphthalene derivatives on the nanoparticle surface. With an increased number of sulfonic acid groups on the aromatic compound a significantly lower loading is observed on the corresponding functionalized nanoparticles. This can be counteracted by a change of nitrite species. With this method, nanoparticles with a high number of sulfonic acid groups can be produced.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>BN&#8208;Doped Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks: Tailoring 2D and 3D Porous Architectures through Molecular Editing of Borazines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The borazine unit was used to prepare crystalline porous MOFs from specifically designed borazine carboxylate linkers. To evaluate the influence of the borazine rings on the gas adsorption properties, the analogous full&#8208;carbon carboxylate linker and the corresponding MOF were also prepared. The structure of the three MOFs was unambiguously determined by single crystal X&#8208;ray analysis.







Abstract
Building on the MOF approach to prepare porous materials, herein we report the engineering of porous BN&#8208;doped materials using tricarboxylic hexaarylborazine ligands, which are laterally decorated with functional groups at the full&#8208;carbon &#8216;inner shell&#8217;. Whilst an open porous 3D entangled structure could be obtained from the double interpenetration of two identical metal frameworks derived from the methyl substituted borazine, the chlorine&#8208;functionalised linker undergoes formation of a porous layered 2D honeycomb structure, as shown by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. In this architecture, the borazine cores are rotated by 60&#176; in alternating layers, thus generating large rhombohedral channels running perpendicular to the planes of the networks. An analogous unsubstituted full&#8208;carbon metal framework was synthesised for comparison. The resulting MOF revealed a crystalline 3D entangled porous structure, composed by three mutually interpenetrating networks, hence denser than those obtained from the borazine linkers. Their microporosity and CO2 uptake were investigated, with the porous 3D BN&#8208;MOF entangled structure exhibiting a large apparent BET specific surface area (1091&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1) and significant CO2 reversible adsorption (3.31&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1) at 1&#8197;bar and 273&#8197;K.

         <title>Cannabidiol Discovery and Synthesis&#8212;a Target&#8208;Oriented Analysis in Drug Production Processes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Plant potential: Demand for cannabidiol (CBD) has increased drastically in the recent years, so highly pure cannabinoids and its intermediates are an emerging market for use as an antiepileptic product. Despite numerous studies describing the isolation and purification of CBD from plant material, its production is still limited. A detailed analysis of the history behind cannabinoid compounds and their optimization is provided.







Abstract
The current state of evidence and recommendations for cannabidiol (CBD) and its health effects change the legal landscape and aim to destigmatize its phytotherapeutic research. Recently, some countries have included CBD as an antiepileptic product for compassionate use in children with refractory epilepsy. The growing demand for CBD has led to the need for high&#8208;purity cannabinoids on the emerging market. The discovery and development of approaches toward CBD synthesis have arisen from the successful extraction of Cannabis plants for cannabinoid fermentation in brewer's yeast. To understand different contributions to the design and enhancement of the synthesis of CBD and its key intermediates, a detailed analysis of the history behind cannabinoid compounds and their optimization is provided herein.

         <title>Terpyridine&#8208;Based 3D Metal&#8211;Organic&#8208;Frameworks: A Structure&#8211;Property Correlation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Terpyridine&#8208;based MOFs: The main objective of this review is to highlight the design strategy of 3D metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) based on 4&#8242;&#8208;phenyl substituted terpyridine derivatives, their structural features, and the important physicochemical properties related to the structures. The structure&#8211;property correlations could give rise to some concepts for the future design of terpyridine&#8208;based MOFs with desired properties.







Abstract
Design, synthesis, and applications of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are among the most salient fields of research in modern inorganic and materials chemistry. As the structure and physical properties of MOFs are mostly dependent on the organic linkers or ligands, the choice of ligand system is of utmost importance in the design of MOFs. One such crucial organic linker/ligand is terpyridine (tpy), which can adopt various coordination modes to generate an enormous number of metal&#8211;organic frameworks. These frameworks generally carry physicochemical characteristics induced by the &#960;&#8208;electron&#8208;rich (basically N&#8208;electron&#8208;rich moiety) terpyridines. In this minireview, the construction of 3D MOFs associated with symmetrical terpyridines is discussed. These ligands can be easily derivatized at the lateral phenyl (4&#8242;&#8208;phenyl) position and incorporate additional organic functionalities. These functionalities lead to some different binding modes and form higher dimensional (3D) frameworks. Therefore, these 3D MOFs can carry multiple features along with the characteristics of terpyridines. Some properties of these MOFs, like photophysical, chemical selectivity, photocatalytic degradation, proton conductivity, and magnetism, etc. have also been discussed and correlated with their frameworks.

         <title>Evidence for Atropisomerism in Polycyclic &#947;&#8208;Butenolides: Synthesis, Scope, and Spectroscopic Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rare cycles: Atropisomeric compounds are of tremendous importance in pharmaceuticals, bioactive natural products, and as chiral ligands in asymmetric synthesis. The most explored atropisomeric structures possess six&#8208;membered rings. We have designed and developed a novel approach for the synthesis of first examples of potential atropisomeric polycyclic butenolide derivatives from aryl&#8208;Z&#8208;enoate propargylic alcohols via an acid&#8208;mediated domino double cyclization.







Abstract
Design and development of a domino cyclative approach for the synthesis of new polycyclic &#947;&#8208;butenolides from &#946;&#8208;aryl&#8208;Z&#8208;enoate propargylic alcohols, through the interception of an intermediate of the Z&#8208;enoate&#8208;assisted Meyer&#8211;Schuster rearrangement, has been reported. A systematic NMR analysis of various derivatives of this class revealed and supported the potential atropisomerism associated with them. These molecules represent first examples of butenolide ring&#8208;based atropisomeric compounds in organic chemistry. The synthetic process involves a synchronous construction of both rings with concurrent creation of the potential stereogenic rotational axis.

         <title>An Anthracene&#8208;Based Metal&#8208;Organic Framework for Selective Photo&#8208;Reduction of Carbon Dioxide to Formic Acid Coupled with Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Zr&#8208;based photoactive metal&#8208;organic framework was synthesized under solvothermal condition. It could reduce the carbon dioxide coupled with water oxidation under UV/Visible light. Also, it selectively reduced the carbon dioxide than the free ligand with a turn&#8208;over frequency (TOF) of 0.69&#8197;h&#8722;1 for formic acid and produced oxygen with a TOF of 0.54&#8197;h&#8722;1.







Abstract
A Zr&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework has been synthesized and employed as a catalyst for photochemical carbon dioxide reduction coupled with water oxidation. The catalyst shows significant carbon dioxide reduction property with concomitant water oxidation. The catalyst has broad visible light as well as UV light absorption property, which is further confirmed from electronic absorption spectroscopy. Formic acid was the only reduced product from carbon dioxide with a turn&#8208;over frequency (TOF) of 0.69&#8197;h&#8722;1 in addition to oxygen, which was produced with a TOF of 0.54&#8197;h&#8722;1. No external photosensitizer is used and the ligand itself acts as the light harvester. The efficient and selective photochemical carbon dioxide reduction to formic acid with concomitant water oxidation using Zr&#8208;based MOF as catalyst is thus demonstrated here.

No external photosensitizer is used and the ligand itself acts as the light harvester. The efficient and selective photochemical carbon dioxide reduction to formic acid with concomitant water oxidation using Zr&#8208;based MOF as catalyst is thus demonstrated here.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Light&#8208; and Manganese&#8208;Initiated Borylation of Aryl Diazonium Salts: Mechanistic Insight on the Ultrafast Time&#8208;Scale Revealed by Time&#8208;Resolved Spectroscopic Analysis</title>

Mn&#8208;mediated borylation of aryl/heteroaryl diazonium salts emerges as a general and versatile synthetic methodology for the synthesis of aryl/heteroaryl boronate esters. The MnI&#8208;carbonyl species generated under the reaction conditions has been revealed by time&#8208;resolved multiple probe spectroscopy (TRMPS&#8208;IR).







Abstract
Manganese&#8208;mediated borylation of aryl/heteroaryl diazonium salts emerges as a general and versatile synthetic methodology for the synthesis of the corresponding boronate esters. The reaction proved an ideal testing ground for delineating the Mn species responsible for the photochemical reaction processes, that is, involving either Mn radical or Mn cationic species, which is dependent on the presence of a suitably strong oxidant. Our findings are important for a plethora of processes employing Mn&#8208;containing carbonyl species as initiators and/or catalysts, which have considerable potential in synthetic applications.

N  2  adsorption isotherms of activated MOFs  1&#8242;  &#8210;  5&#8242;  at 77 K all displayed type I adsorption behavior, suggesting their microporous nature.

         <title>Fluorinated Rings: Conformation and Application</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The introduction of fluorine atoms into molecules and materials across many fields of academic and industrial research is now commonplace, owing to their unique properties and effects. A particularly interesting feature of fluorine substitution is its impact on the relative orientation of a C&#8211;F bond when incorporated with organic molecules. In this Review, we will be shining light on this unique feature by discussing the conformational behaviour of aliphatic carbo&#8208; and heterocyclic systems. The conformational preference of each system is associated with various interactions introduced by fluorine substitution such as charge&#8208;dipole interactions, dipole&#8208;dipole interactions and hyperconjugative interactions. The contribution of each interaction on the stabilization of the fluorinated alicyclic system, which manifests itself in low conformations, will be discussed in details. The novelty of this feature will be demonstrated by presenting the most recent applications.</dc:description>

Perovskite solar cells: Advanced quantum chemical techniques are employed to explore the photophysical, photovoltaic, and optoelectronic properties as well as the structure&#8211;property relationship of R and HB1&#8211;HB10 molecules. The studied systems may be targeted for the development of high&#8208;performance perovskite solar cells.







Abstract
Perovskite solar cells have gained immense interest from researchers owing to their good photophysical properties, low&#8208;cost production, and high power conversion efficiencies. Hole transport materials (HTMs) play a dominant role in enhancing the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) and long diffusion length of holes and electrons in perovskite solar cells. In hole transport materials, modification of &#960;&#8208;linkers has proved to be an efficient approach for enhancing the overall PCE of perovskite solar cells.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Perovskite solar cells&lt;/b&gt;: Advanced quantum chemical techniques are employed to explore the photophysical, photovoltaic, and optoelectronic properties as well as the structure&#8211;property relationship of &lt;b&gt;R&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;HB1&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;HB10&lt;/b&gt; molecules.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perovskite solar cells have gained immense interest from researchers owing to their good photophysical properties, low&#8208;cost production, and high power conversion efficiencies. Hole transport materials (HTMs) play a dominant role in enhancing the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) and long diffusion length of holes and electrons in perovskite solar cells. In hole transport materials, modification of &#960;&#8208;linkers has proved to be an efficient approach for enhancing the overall PCE of perovskite solar cells. In this work, &#960;&#8208;linker modification of a recently synthesized H&#8722;Bi molecule (&lt;b&gt;R&lt;/b&gt;) is achieved with novel &#960;&#8208;linkers. After structural modifications, ten novel HTMs (&lt;b&gt;HB1&#8211;HB10&lt;/b&gt;) with a D&#8722;&#960;&#8722;D backbone are obtained. The structure&#8211;property relationship, and optoelectronic and photovoltaic characteristics of these newly designed hole transport materials are examined comprehensively and compared with reference molecules. In addition, different geometric parameters are also examined with the assistance of density functional theory (DFT) and time&#8208;dependent DFT. All the designed molecules exhibit narrow HOMO&#8211;LUMO energy gaps (&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;=3.05&#8197;eV). The designed molecules express redshifting in their absorption spectra with low values of excitation energy, which in return offer high power conversion efficiencies. Further, density of states and molecular electrostatic potential analysis is performed to locate the different charge sites in the molecules.

         <title>A High&#8208;Efficiency Hematite Photoanode with Enhanced Bonding Energy Around Fe Atoms</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hematite photoanodes: By treating the surface of hematite with Se and NaBH4, the Fe2O3 is transformed into a double&#8208;layer nanostructure. In the outer layer, the Fe&#8722;O bonding is reinforced and the Fe&#8722;Se bonding is even stronger. Therefore, the surface states are inhibited and the increase in photocurrent density becomes much faster.







Abstract
Hematite nanoarrays are important photoanode materials. However, they suffer from serious problems of charge transfer and surface states; in particular, the surface states hinder the increase in photocurrent. A previous strategy to suppress the surface state is the deposition of an Fe&#8208;free metal oxide overlayer. Herein, from the viewpoint of atomic bonding energy, it is found that the strength of bonding around Fe atoms in the hematite is the key to suppressing the surface states. By treating the surface of hematite with Se and NaBH4, the Fe2O3 transforms to a double&#8208;layer nanostructure. In the outer layer, the Fe&#8722;O bonding is reinforced and the Fe&#8722;Se bonding is even stronger. Therefore, the surface states are inhibited and the increase in the photocurrent density becomes much faster. Besides, the treatment constructs a nanoscale p&#8211;n junction to promote the charge transfer. Improvements are achieved in onset potential (0.25&#8197;V shift) and in photocurrent density (5.8&#8197;times). This work pinpoints the key to suppressing the surface states and preparing a high&#8208;efficiency hematite nanoarray, and deepens our understanding of hematite photoanodes.

Abstract
An efficient approach to the type&#8197;III lepadin alkaloids (lepadins F and G) has been developed through a key Diels&#8211;Alder reaction, in which a novel ketolactone&#8208;type dienophile with chiral diol unit is employed to generate the desirable all&#8208;cis&#8208;trisubstituted cyclohexene with excellent regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity control. The subsequent selective sulfonylation of the diol unit followed by SN2 cyclization under hydrogenation conditions could construct the substituted piperidine ring. By using this approach, (&#8722;)&#8208;lepadin F is synthesized from ethyl l&#8208;lactate for the first time.

         <title>Influence of Pore Structure and Metal&#8208;Node Geometry on the Polymerization of Ethylene over Cr&#8208;Based Metal Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal Organic Frameworks (MOFs) have received increasing interest as solid single&#8208;site catalysts, owing to their tunable pore architecture and metal node geometry. The ability to exploit these modulators makes them prominent candidates for producing polyethylene (PE) materials with narrow dispersity index (&#208;) values. Here we present a study in which we systematically investigated the ethylene polymerization properties, with Et2AlCl as activator, of three renowned Cr&#8208;based MOFs: MIL&#8208;101(Cr)&#8208;NDC (NDC = 2,6&#8208;dicarboxynapthalene), MIL&#8208;53(Cr) and HKUST&#8208;1(Cr). Ethylene polymerization reactions revealed varying catalytic activities, with MIL&#8208;101(Cr)&#8208;NDC and MIL&#8208;53(Cr) being significantly more active than HKUST&#8208;1(Cr). Analysis of the PE products revealed large &#208; values, demonstrating that polymerization occurs over a multitude of active Cr centers rather than a singular type of Cr site. Spectroscopic experiments, in the form of powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (pXRD), UV&#8208;Vis&#8208;NIR Diffuse Reflectance Spectroscopy (DRS) and CO probe molecule Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy corroborated these findings, indicating that indeed for each MOF unique active sites are generated, however without alteration of the original oxidation state. Furthermore, the pXRD experiments indicated that one major prerequisite for catalytic activity was the degree of MOF activation by the Et2AlCl co&#8208;catalyst, with the more active materials portraying a larger degree of activation.</dc:description>

         <title>Do docking sites persist upon fluorination? The diadamantyl ether&#8208;aromatics challenge for rotational spectroscopy and theory</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorinated derivatives of biological molecules have proved to be highly efficient at modifying the biological activity of a given protein through changes in the stability and the kind of docking interactions. These interactions can be hindered or facilitated based on the hydrophilic/hydrophobic character of a particular protein region. Diadamantyl ether ( C 20 H 30 O ) possesses both kinds of docking sites, serving as a good template to model these important contacts with aromatic fluorinated counterparts. We report here an experimental study on the structures of several complexes between diadamantyl ether and benzene as well as a series of fluorinated benzenes to analyze the effect of H &#8594; F substitution on the interaction and structure of the resulting molecular clusters using rotational spectroscopy. All experimentally observed complexes are largely dominated by London dispersion interactions with the hydrogen&#8208;terminated surface areas of diadamantyl ether. Already single substitution of one hydrogen atom with fluorine changes the preferred docking site of the complexes. However, the overall contributions of the different intermolecular interactions are similar for the different complexes, contrary to previous studies focusing on the difference in interactions using fluorinated and non&#8208;fluorinated molecules.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Fluorinated derivatives of biological molecules have proved to be highly efficient at modifying the biological activity of a given protein through changes in the stability and the kind of docking interactions. These interactions can be hindered or facilitated based on the hydrophilic/hydrophobic character of a particular protein region. Diadamantyl ether ( C 20 H 30 O ) possesses both kinds of docking sites, serving as a good template to model these important contacts with aromatic fluorinated counterparts. We report here an experimental study on the structures of several complexes between diadamantyl ether and benzene as well as a series of fluorinated benzenes to analyze the effect of H &#8594; F substitution on the interaction and structure of the resulting molecular clusters using rotational spectroscopy. All experimentally observed complexes are largely dominated by London dispersion interactions with the hydrogen&#8208;terminated surface areas of diadamantyl ether. Already single substitution of one hydrogen atom with fluorine changes the preferred docking site of the complexes. However, the overall contributions of the different intermolecular interactions are similar for the different complexes, contrary to previous studies focusing on the difference in interactions using fluorinated and non&#8208;fluorinated molecules.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Not Carbon s&#8211;p Hybridization, but Coordination Number Determines C&#8211;H and C&#8211;C Bond Length</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A fundamental and ubiquitous phenomenon in chemistry is the contraction of both C&#8211;H and C&#8211;C bonds as the carbon atoms involved vary, in s&#8211;p hybridization, along sp 3 &#160;to sp 2 &#160;to sp. Our quantum&#8208;chemical bonding analyses based on Kohn&#8208;Sham molecular orbital theory show that the generally accepted rationale behind this trend is incorrect. Inspection of the molecular orbitals and their corresponding orbital overlaps reveals that the above&#8208;mentioned shortening in C&#8211;H and C&#8211;C bonds is not determined by an increasing amount of&#160; s &#8208;character at the carbon atom in these bonds. Instead, we establish that this structural trend is caused by a diminishing steric (Pauli) repulsion between substituents around the pertinent carbon atom, as the coordination number decreases along sp 3 &#160;to sp 2 &#160;to sp.</dc:description>

         <title>Air Stable Iridium Catalysts for Direct Reductive Amination of Ketones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Half&#8208;sandwich iridium complexes bearing bidentate urea&#8208;phosphorus ligands were found to catalyze the direct reductive amination of aromatic and aliphatic ketones under mild conditions at 0.5 mol.% loading with high selectivity towards primary amines. One of the complexes was found to be active in both the Leuckart&#8208;Wallach (NH4CO2H) type reaction as well as in the hydrogenative (H2/NH4AcO) reductive amination. The protocol with ammonium formate does not require an inert atmosphere, dry solvents, as well as additives and in contrast to previous reports takes place in HFIP instead of methanol. Applying NH4CO2D or D2 resulted in a high degree of deuterium incorporation into the primary amine &#945;&#8208;position.</dc:description>

         <title>&#960;&#8208;Bridge Substitution in DASAs: The Subtle Equilibrium between Photochemical Improvements and Thermal Control**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bridging the gap: A new set of donor&#8211;acceptor Stenhouse adducts was computationally studied and prepared through the substitution on the &#960;&#8208;bridge. This allows for the modification of absorption, photocyclization, and relative stability of the isomers. This change provides a consistent redshift in the absorption maximum and a structural entry point for subsequent derivatization, although the reversibility is blocked.







Abstract
Donor&#8211;acceptor Stenhouse adducts (DASAs) are playing an outstanding role as innovative and versatile photoswitches. Until now, all the efforts have been spent on modifying the donor and acceptor moieties to modulate the absorption energy and improve the cyclization and reversion kinetics. However, there is a strong dependence on specific structural modifications and a lack of predictive behavior, mostly owing to the complex photoswitching mechanism. Here, by means of a combined experimental and theoretical study, the effect of chemical modification of the &#960;&#8208;bridge linking the donor and acceptor moieties is systematically explored, revealing the significant impact on the absorption, photocyclization, and relative stability of the open form. In particular, a position along the &#960;&#8208;bridge is found to be the most suited to redshift the absorption while preserving the cyclization. However, thermal back&#8208;reaction to the initial isomer is blocked. These effects are explained in terms of an increased acceptor capability offered by the &#960;&#8208;bridge substituent that can be modulated. This strategy opens the path toward derivatives with infra&#8208;red absorption and a potential anchoring point for further functionalization.

         <title>Boron&#8211;Ligand Cooperation: The Concept and Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
B for cooperation: The term boron&#8211;ligand cooperation (BLC) describes a specific mode of action by which distinctive intramolecular borane&#8208;based frustrated Lewis Pairs (FLPs) activate chemical bonds. The central aspect of this concept is that the substituent at the borane that is involved in the bond activation becomes a datively bound ligand upon bond activation. The reactivity of systems that operate via BLC can complement those of classic intramolecular FLPs.







Abstract
The term boron&#8211;ligand cooperation was introduced to describe a specific mode of action by which certain metal&#8208;free systems activate chemical bonds. The main characteristic of this mode of action is that one covalently bound substituent at the boron is actively involved in the bond activation process and changes to a datively bound ligand in the course of the bond activation. Within this review, how the term boron&#8211;ligand cooperation evolved is reflected on and examples of bond activation by boron&#8211;ligand cooperation are discussed. It is furthermore shown that systems that operate via boron&#8211;ligand cooperation can complement the reactivity of classic intramolecular frustrated Lewis pairs and applications of this new concept for metal&#8208;free catalysis are summarized.

         <title>Combined Ex and In Situ Measurements Elucidate the Dynamics of Retained Species in ZSM&#8208;5 and SAPO&#8208;18 Catalysts Used in the Methanol&#8208;to&#8208;Olefins Reaction</title>

         <dc:description>
The methanol&#8208;to&#8208;olefins (MTO) reaction generates many retained species in the catalyst that evolve from active species for the formation of olefins to deactivating species leaving coke deposits. The active species can be detected by a combination of ex situ temperature&#8208;programmed desorption (TPD) and extraction measurements whereas the deactivating species by ex situ temperature&#8208;programmed oxidation (TPO), and both of them by in situ FTIR spectroscopy, which allows their dynamics to be followed in the MTO reaction performance.







Abstract
The dynamics of the retained species on ZSM&#8208;5 and SAPO&#8208;18 catalysts are studied by using a combination of temperature&#8208;programmed desorption/oxidation, ex situ analysis, and in situ FTIR spectroscopic measurements over the entire conversion range, using fixed&#8208;bed and spectroscopic cell reactors, in continuous and discontinuous mode. The results point to the appropriateness of the combined methodologies to track the interconversion of active into deactivating species. A statistically relevant (supported by linear regression and multivariate analysis) association of the observations is found by using the different complementary methodologies. The kinetics of this interconversion depends on the initial conversion (tuned by acidity and space time) and microporous topology, and involve: (i)&#8197;in the ZSM&#8208;5 catalysts, the diffusion of monocyclic aromatics toward the exterior of the zeolite to form coke, and (ii)&#8197;in the SAPO&#8208;18 catalysts, the obstruction of the cavities by aromatics that grow into tetracyclic aromatic islands.

         <title>Controlling Spin&#8208;Correlated Radical Pairs with Donor&#8211;Acceptor Dyads: A New Concept to Generate Reduced Metal Complexes for More Efficient Photocatalysis</title>

Ping&#8208;pong with electrons: Employing time&#8208;resolved optical spectroscopy, a new concept for the light&#8208;driven generation of reduced metal complexes with important implications for photocatalysis is presented.







Abstract
One&#8208;electron reduced metal complexes derived from photoactive ruthenium or iridium complexes are important intermediates for substrate activation steps in photoredox catalysis and for the photocatalytic generation of solar fuels. However, owing to the heavy atom effect, direct photochemical pathways to these key intermediates suffer from intrinsic efficiency problems resulting from rapid geminate recombination of radical pairs within the so&#8208;called solvent cage.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ping&#8208;pong with electrons&lt;/b&gt;: Employing time&#8208;resolved optical spectroscopy, a new concept for the light&#8208;driven generation of reduced metal complexes with important implications for photocatalysis is presented.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One&#8208;electron reduced metal complexes derived from photoactive ruthenium or iridium complexes are important intermediates for substrate activation steps in photoredox catalysis and for the photocatalytic generation of solar fuels. However, owing to the heavy atom effect, direct photochemical pathways to these key intermediates suffer from intrinsic efficiency problems resulting from rapid geminate recombination of radical pairs within the so&#8208;called solvent cage. In this study, we prepared and investigated molecular dyads capable of producing reduced metal complexes via an indirect pathway relying on a sequence of energy and electron transfer processes between a Ru complex and a covalently connected anthracene moiety. Our test reaction to establish the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept is the photochemical reduction of ruthenium(tris)bipyridine by the ascorbate dianion as sacrificial donor in aqueous solution. The photochemical key step in the Ru&#8208;anthracene dyads is the reduction of a purely organic (anthracene) triplet excited state by the ascorbate dianion, yielding a spin&#8208;correlated radical pair whose (unproductive) recombination is strongly spin&#8208;forbidden. By carrying out detailed laser flash photolysis investigations, we provide clear evidence for the indirect reduced metal complex generation mechanism and show that this pathway can outperform the conventional direct metal complex photoreduction. The further optimization of our approach involving relatively simple molecular dyads might result in novel photocatalysts that convert substrates with unprecedented quantum yields.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Mechanical Modulation of the Solid&#8208;State Luminescence of Tricarbonyl Rhenium(I) Complexes through the Interplay between Two Triplet Excited States</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Totally unprecedented! The link between mechanoresponsive luminescence (MRL) and solid&#8208;state luminescence enhancement has been explored for two ReI complexes. Remarkably, mechanical stimulation modulates the emission of two low&#8208;lying triplet states and opens vibrational modes through the disruption of the rigid crystal structure upon grinding (see figure). This report reveals the unprecedented potential of ReI complexes as MRL&#8208;active materials.







Abstract
Mechanoresponsive luminescence (MRL) materials promise smart devices for sensing, optoelectronics and security. We present here the first report on the MRL activity of two ReI complexes, opening up new opportunities for applications in these fields. Both complexes exhibit marked solid&#8208;state luminescence enhancement (SLE). Furthermore, the pristine microcrystalline powders emit in the yellow&#8208;green region, and grinding led to an amorphous phase with concomitant emission redshift and shrinking of the photoluminescence (PL) quantum yields and lifetimes. Quantum chemical calculations revealed the existence of two low&#8208;lying triplet excited states with very similar energy levels, that is, 3IL and 3MLCT, having, respectively, almost pure intraligand (IL) and metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge&#8208;transfer (MLCT) character. Transition between these states could be promoted by rotation around the pyridyltriazole&#8722;phenylbenzoxazole bond. In the microcrystals, in which rotations are hindered, the 3IL state induces the prominent PL emission at short wavelengths. Upon grinding, rotation is facilitated and the transition to the 3MLCT state results in a larger proportion of long&#8208;wavelength PL. FTIR and variable&#8208;temperature PL spectroscopy showed that the opening of the vibrational modes favours non&#8208;radiative deactivation of the triplet states in the amorphous phase. In solution, PL only arises from the 3MLCT state. The same mechanism accounts for the spectroscopic differences observed when passing from crystals to amorphous powders, and then to solutions, thereby clarifying the link between SLE and MRL for these complexes.

         <title>Fluorescent Imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyrimidine Compounds as Biocompatible Organic Photosensitizers that Generate Singlet Oxygen: A Potential Tool for Phototheranostics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New phototheranostics! Imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyrimidine compounds are able to generate singlet oxygen species and act as photosensitizers in the intracellular environment (see figure). They exhibit all the properties of an ideal photosensitizer, required for simultaneous fluorescence imaging and photodynamic activity, and as such they have potential for phototheranostics.







Abstract
Photodynamic therapy has been used to treat a variety of diseases, however, there is continuing search for new biocompatible photosensitizers. Herein, we demonstrate for the first time that imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyrimidine compounds are able to generate singlet oxygen species and can act as photosensitizers in the intracellular environment. Our results show that this class of compounds absorb and emit in the 400&#8211;500&#8197;nm region, present low cytotoxicity in the dark, are efficiently uptaken by cells, are fluorescent in intracellular medium, and generate singlet oxygen upon irradiation, killing cancer cells within 2&#8197;h at low concentration (2.0&#8197;&#956;m). The imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyrimidine compounds are a potential new tool for phototheranostics, because they can be simultaneously used for fluorescence imaging and photodynamic therapy.

         <title>Exploring the Reactivity of a Frustrated Sn/P Lewis Pair: The Highly Selective Complexation of the cis&#8208;Azobenzene Photoisomer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly selective complexation of cis&#8208;azobenzene was found when reacting the isomeric compound with the intramolecular frustrated Lewis pair (F5C2)3SnCH2P(tBu)2 under UV&#8208;induced photoisomerization conditions.







Abstract
The reactivity of the geminal frustrated Lewis pair (FLP) (F5C2)3SnCH2P(tBu)2 (1) was explored by reacting it with a variety of small molecules (PhOCN, PhNCS, PhCCH, tBuCCH, H3CC(O)CH=CH2, Ph[C(O)]2Ph, PhN=NPh and Me3SiCHN2), featuring polar or non&#8208;polar multiple bonds and/or represent &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated systems. While most adducts are formed readily, the binding of azobenzene requires UV&#8208;induced photoisomerization, which results in the highly selective complexation of cis&#8208;azobenzene. In the case of benzil, the reaction does not lead to the expected 1,2&#8208; or 1,4&#8208;addition products, but to the non&#8208;stereoselective (tBu)2PCH2&#8208;transfer to a prochiral keto function of benzil. All adducts of 1 were characterised by means of multinuclear NMR spectroscopy, elemental analyses and X&#8208;ray diffraction experiments.

         <title>Photoinduced Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Dicarbofunctionalization of Terminal Alkynes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dicarbofunctionalization of alkynes at room temperature is achieved using simple, bench&#8208;stable alkyl iodides and a second molecule of alkyne as coupling partner. This alkylation&#8211;alkynylation sequence allows the one&#8208;step synthesis of 1,3&#8208;enynes including heteroarenes and biologically active compounds with high efficiency without exogenous photosensitizers or oxidants.







Abstract
Herein, a conceptually distinct approach was developed that allowed for the dicarbofunctionalization of alkynes at room temperature using simple, bench&#8208;stable alkyl iodides and a second molecule of alkyne as coupling partner. Specifically, the photochemical activation of palladium complexes enabled this strategic dicarbofunctionalization via addition of alkyl radicals from secondary and tertiary alkyl iodides and formation of an intermediate palladium vinyl complex that could undergo subsequent Sonogashira reaction with a second alkyne molecule. This alkylation&#8211;alkynylation sequence allowed the one&#8208;step synthesis of 1,3&#8208;enynes including heteroarenes and biologically active compounds with high efficiency without exogenous photosensitizers or oxidants and now opens up pathways towards cascade reactions via photochemical palladium catalysis.

         <title>Towards Catalytically Active Porous Graphene Membranes with Pulsed Laser Deposited Ceria Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porous graphene with catalytically active ceria nanometre&#8208;size particles were prepared using pulsed laser deposition on graphene. Increased dehydrogenation activity of methanol leading to CO and H2 formation was demonstrated.







Abstract
Porous graphene with catalytically active ceria nanometre&#8208;size particles were prepared using pulsed laser deposition (PLD) on graphene produced through chemical vapour deposition (CVD). The reported process provided porous graphene containing ceria nanoparticles as confirmed by HR TEM and XPS. Isotopically labelled 13C graphene was employed to study desorption of the species containing carbon. Methanol adsorption was utilised to probe the nature of the catalytic activity of prepared ceria decorated graphene. The important role of graphene support for the stabilization of reduced ceria nanoparticles was finally confirmed. Increased dehydrogenation activity of graphene with ceria nanoparticles leading to CO and H2 formation was demonstrated.

         <title>Silver&#8208;Promoted Fluorination Reactions of &#945;&#8208;Bromoamides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Open and shut with silver! A silver&#8208;promoted fluorine substitution reaction of &#945;&#8208;bromoamide has been recently developed. This methodology enables access to tertiary, secondary, and primary alkyl fluorides with chemoselectivity and stereospecificity by forming an aziridinone intermediate. The cover image depicts that molecules are closed, and opening like an umbrella. In addition, the reaction of &#945;&#8208;bromoamide with O&#8208;nucleophiles including OCF3 provided the sterically hindered alcohol, ester and ether.

         <title>Synthesis and Characterization of Two Uranyl&#8208;Aryl &#8220;Ate&#8221; Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first structurally&#8208;characterized uranyl aryl complexes are reported in this work. A combined 13C NMR spectroscopic and relativistic DFT computational analysis reveals that the chemical shifts of the aryl ipso carbon nuclei are shifted downfield by 62 to 68&#8197;ppm due to high levels of 5f orbital participation in the U&#8722;C bonds. Significantly, this study showcases the exquisite sensitivity of 13C chemical shifts to 5f participation in An&#8722;C bonding, further cementing the utility of this emerging method of analysis.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ladies and gentlemen! Unique structural motifs of simple RZnOR&#8217; alkoxides, a roof&#8208;like trimer and a ladder&#8208;type tetramer, are presented to the broad audience of chemists. Moreover, we show that when our &#8242;chemical performance&#8242; is undertaken in solution, organozinc alkoxides undergo Schlenk&#8208;type ligand redistribution processes, providing the trinuclear spiro&#8208;type compounds. The announced results thus make sure that this long&#8208;standing organometallic show is continuously going on. More information can be found in the Full Paper by J. Lewi&#324;ski et&#8197;al.

         <title>Doubling F&#246;rster Resonance Energy Transfer Efficiency in Proteins with Extrinsic Thioamide Probes: Implications for Thiomodified Nucleobases</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
FRET over sulfur! Introducing a small thio&#8208;modified extrinsic probe into an albumin protein results in a twofold enhancement of the FRET efficiency. Donor&#8211;acceptor spectral overlap with stabilization of the probe through different types of noncovalent interactions with sulfur plays a leading role in the unexpected photophysical properties of the thioamide probes.







Abstract
Designing a potential protein&#8211;ligand pair is pivotal, not only to track the protein structure dynamics, but also to assist in an atomistic understanding of drug delivery. Herein, the potential of a small model thioamide probe being used to study albumin proteins is reported. By monitoring the F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) dynamics with the help of fluorescence spectroscopic techniques, a twofold enhancement in the FRET efficiency of 2&#8208;thiopyridone (2TPY), relative to that of its amide analogue, is observed. Molecular dynamics simulations depict the relative position of the free energy minimum to be quite stable in the case of 2TPY through noncovalent interactions with sulfur, which help to enhance the FRET efficiency. Finally, its application is shown by pairing thiouracils with protein. It is found that the site&#8208;selective sulfur atom substitution approach and noncovalent interactions with sulfur can substantially enhance the FRET efficiency, which could be a potential avenue to explore in the design of FRET probes to study the structure and dynamics of biomolecules.

         <title>Emerging Implications of the Concept of Hydricity in Energy&#8208;Relevant Catalytic Processes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Back to the drawing board: Thermodynamic hydricity serves as an important conceptual tool in developing key catalyst design principles for various hydride&#8208;transfer reactions. Controlling factors such as solvent, metal identity, and ligand structure play a significant role in manipulating the thermodynamic hydricity of transition&#8208;metal complexes. These important aspects are discussed in the context of optimizing energy&#8208;relevant processes, such as H+ and CO2 reduction to H2 and formate, respectively.







Abstract

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Back to the drawing board&lt;/b&gt;: Thermodynamic hydricity serves as an important conceptual tool in developing key catalyst design principles for various hydride&#8208;transfer reactions. Controlling factors such as solvent, metal identity, and ligand structure play a significant role in manipulating the thermodynamic hydricity of transition&#8208;metal complexes. These important aspects are discussed in the context of optimizing energy&#8208;relevant processes, such as H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction to H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and formate, respectively.

         <title>Unravelling Structural Mysteries of Simple Organozinc Alkoxides</title>

Ladder to the roof: The synthesis and structural characterization of two unprecedented zinc alkoxides, a roof&#8208;like trimer [(tBuZn)3(&#956;&#8208;OC(H)Ph2)2(&#956;3&#8208;OC(H)Ph2)] and a ladder&#8208;type tetramer [(PhZn)4(&#956;&#8208;OC(H)Ph2)2(&#956;3&#8208;OC(H)Ph2)2] is described. The solution behavior of the new RZnOR&#8217; alkoxides was also investigated by using 1H&#8197;NMR and DOSY spectroscopy, which revealed the presence of multiple aggregate states involved in the Schlenk&#8208;type equilibria.







Abstract
Simple RZnOR&#8217; alkoxides are among the first known organozinc compounds, and widespread interest in their multifaced chemistry has been driven by their fundamental significance and potential applications including various catalytic reactions. Nevertheless, their chemistry in solution and in the solid state remains both relatively poorly understood and a subject of constant debate. Herein, the synthesis and structural characterization of long&#8208;sought structural forms, a roof&#8208;like trimer [(tBuZn)3(&#956;&#8208;OC(H)Ph2)2(&#956;3&#8208;OC(H)Ph2)] and a ladder&#8208;type tetramer [(PhZn)4(&#956;&#8208;OC(H)Ph2)2(&#956;3&#8208;OC(H)Ph2)2], incorporating diphenylmethanolate as a model alkoxide ligand, are reported. Both novel aggregates are robust in the solid state and resistant towards mechanical force. By using 1H&#8197;NMR and diffusion&#8208;order spectroscopy, it is demonstrated that new RZnOR&#8217; alkoxides are kinetically labile in solution and readily undergo ligand scrambling, such as in the case of Schlenk equilibrium. The elucidated key structural issues, which have remained undiscovered for decades, significantly advance the chemistry of RZnOR&#8217; alkoxides and should support the rational design of zinc alkoxide&#8208;based applications.

         <title>Facile Access to Hetero&#8208;poly&#8208;functional Arenes and meta&#8208;Substituted Arenes via Two&#8208;Step Dimetalation and Mg/Halogen&#8208;Exchange Protocol</title>

A tandem template metalation and Mg/I&#8208;exchange strategy has been used to convert simple arenes into the corresponding meta&#8208;substituted arenes in good yields.







Abstract
The Grignard reagent, iPrMgCl and its lithium chloride&#8208;enhanced &#8216;turbo&#8217; derivative iPrMgCl&#8901;LiCl have been employed to investigate the single iodo/magnesium exchange reactions of the trisubstituted arenes, 2,5&#8208;diiodo&#8208;N,N&#8208;diisopropylbenzamide 1, 1,4&#8208;diiodo&#8208;2&#8208;methoxybenzene 2, and 1,4&#8208;diiodo&#8208;2&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)benzene 3. These three arenes themselves were initially prepared by a double ortho&#8208;, meta&#8242;&#8208;deprotonation of N,N&#8208;diisopropylbenzamide, anisole and (trifluoromethyl)benzene, respectively, using the sodium magnesiate reagent [Na4Mg2(TMP)6(nBu)2] (where TMP is 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidide), and subsequent electrophilic quenching with iodine/THF solution. Thus, by following a combined deprotonation and magnesium/halogen exchange strategy, the simple monosubstituted arenes can be converted to trisubstituted diiodoarenes, which can ultimately be transformed into the corresponding mono&#8208;magnesiated arenes, in THF at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C, within seconds in good yields. The other functional group (OMe, NiPr2 or CF3 respectively) present on the di&#8208;iodoarenes helps direct the exchange reaction to the ortho position, whereas subsequent addition of different electrophiles permits the preparation of hetero&#8208;poly&#8208;functional&#8208;arenes, with three different substituents in their structure. Intriguingly, if water is used as the electrophile, a new and facile route to prepare meta&#8208;substituted arenes, which cannot be easily obtained by conventional processes, is forthcoming. In contrast to directed ortho&#8208;metalation (DoM) chemistry, this reaction sequence can be thought of as InDirect meta&#8208;Metalation (IDmM). The scope of the chemistry has been tested further by exposing the initial unreacted iodo&#8208;functionality at the meta&#8208;position to a second Mg/I&#8208;exchange reaction and subsequent functionalization.

         <title>Benzo&#8208;Tetrathiafulvalene&#8208; (BTTF&#8208;) Annulated Expanded Porphyrins: Potential Next&#8208;Generation Multielectron Reservoirs</title>

         <dc:description>
Expanded porphyrins: Two new benzo&#8208;TTF&#8208;annulated expanded porphyrins show effective intramolecular charge transfer (CT) transitions from TTF moieties to the macrocyclic core. Electrochemical investigations reveal that these electron&#8208;rich materials could be used as efficient electron reservoirs for material applications.







Abstract
Two sterically crowded benzo&#8208;tetrathiafulvalene (BTTF)&#8208;annulated expanded porphyrins (BTTF7&#8208;F and BTTF8) are synthesized. Detailed photophysical investigations reveal their intrinsic intramolecular charge transfer (CT) character, originated from partial electron transfer from electron&#8208;rich TTF units to the relatively electron&#8208;deficient macrocyclic core. This finding stands in contrast to what was observed in the previously reported Figure&#8208;of&#8208;eight conformer of BTTF&#8208;annulated [28]hexaphyrin (BTTF6), in which a typical &#960;&#8211;&#960;* electronic transition from HOMO to LUMO was observed. However, core expansion in BTTF7&#8208;F and BTTF8 makes the oligopyrrole macrocyclic cores relatively more electron&#8208;deficient, facilitating the effective intramolecular CT process. Comparative electrochemical investigations reveal that the current generated at the oxidative region is directly proportional to the number of TTF units attached to the macrocyclic core. This work demonstrates the control of the intramolecular CT process through incremental addition of TTF units to the macrocyclic core. Facile multielectron electrochemical oxidations of these expanded porphyrins suggest that they behave like potential multielectron reservoirs.

         <title>Chemical Bonding as a New Avenue for Controlling Excited&#8208;State Properties and Excitation Energy&#8208;Transfer Processes in Zinc Phthalocyanine&#8211;Fullerene Dyads</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two compounds, two natures: Electronic structure and nonadiabatic dynamics methods were used to explore the excited&#8208;state properties of two zinc phthalocyanine (ZnPc)&#8208;fullerene dyads. In one bonding configuration, excitation energy transfer from ZnPc to C60 is inhibited; in the other, this process is thermodynamically favorable, with locally excited and charge&#8208;transfer excitons being shown to participate in the energy&#8208;transfer process.







Abstract
Whether chemical bonding can regulate the excited&#8208;state and optoelectronic properties of donor&#8211;acceptor dyads has been largely elusive. In this work, we used electronic structure and nonadiabatic dynamics methods to explore the excited&#8208;state properties of covalently bonded zinc phthalocyanine (ZnPc)&#8208;fullerene (C60) dyads with a 6&#8211;6 (or 5&#8211;6) bonding configuration in which ZnPc is bonded to two carbon atoms shared by the two hexagonal rings (or a pentagonal and a hexagonal ring) in C60. In both cases, the locally excited (LE) states on ZnPc are spectroscopically bright. However, their different chemical bonding differentiates the electronic interactions between ZnPc and C60. In the 5&#8211;6 bonding configuration, the LE states on ZnPc are much higher in energy than the LE states on C60. Thus, the excitation energy transfer from ZnPc to C60 is thermodynamically favorable. On the other hand, in the 6&#8211;6 bonding configuration, such a process is inhibited because the LE states on ZnPc are the lowest ones. More detailed mechanisms are elucidated from nonadiabatic dynamics simulations. In the 6&#8211;6 bonding configuration, no excitation energy transfer was observed. In contrast, in the 5&#8211;6 bonding configuration, several LE and charge&#8208;transfer (CT) excitons were shown to participate in the energy&#8208;transfer process. Further analysis reveals that the photoinduced energy transfer is mediated by a CT exciton, such that electron&#8208; and hole&#8208;transfer processes take place in a concerted but asynchronous manner in the excitation energy transfer. It is also found that high&#8208;level electronic structure methods including exciton effects are indispensable to accurately describe photoinduced energy&#8208; and electron&#8208;transfer processes. Furthermore, this work opens up new avenues for regulating the excited&#8208;state properties of molecular donor&#8211;acceptor dyads by means of chemical bonding.

         <title>Ruthenium&#8208;Catalyzed Coupling Reactions of CO2 with C2H4 and Hydrosilanes towards Silyl Esters</title>

Reductive carboxylation of ethylene in the presence of triethylsilane as reductant is achieved upon using in situ&#8208;prepared catalytic systems incorporating RuII precursors and bidentate phosphine ligands.







Abstract
A series of in situ&#8208;prepared catalytic systems incorporating RuII precursors and bidentate phosphine ligands has been probed in the reductive carboxylation of ethylene in the presence of triethylsilane as reductant. The catalytic production of propionate and acrylate silyl esters was evidenced by high&#8208;throughput screening (HTS) and implemented in batch reactor techniques. The most promising catalyst systems identified were made of Ru(H)(Cl)(CO)(PPh3)3 and 1,4&#8208;bis(dicyclohexylphosphino)butane (DCPB) or 1,1&#8217;&#8208;ferrocene&#8208;diyl&#8208;bis(cyclohexylphosphine) (DCPF). A marked influence of water on the acrylate/propionate selectivity was noted. Turnover numbers [mol&#8201;mol(Ru)&#8722;1] up to 16 for acrylate and up to 68 for propionate were reached under relatively mild conditions (20&#8197;bar, 100&#8201;&#176;C, 0.5&#8197;mol&#8201;% Ru, 40&#8197;mol&#8201;% H2O vs. HSiEt3). Possible mechanisms are discussed.

         <title>Unveiling the Uncommon Fluorescent Recognition Mechanism Towards Pertechnetate Using a Cationic Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Bearing N&#8208;heterocyclic AIE Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As one of most problematic radionuclides, technetium&#8208;99, mainly in the form of anionic pertechnetate (TcO4&#8208;), exhibits high environmental mobility, long half&#8208;life and radioactive hazard. Due to low charge density and high hydrophobicity for this tetrahedral anion, it is extremely difficult to recognize it in water. Seeking efficient and selective recognition method for TcO4&#8208; is still a big challenge. Herein, we reported a new water&#8208;stable cationic metal&#8208;organic framework (ZJU&#8208;X8) bearing tetraphenylethylene pyrimidine&#8208;based aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) ligands and attainable silver sites for TcO4&#8208; detection. ZJU&#8208;X8 underwent an obvious spectroscopic change from brilliant blue to flavovirens and exhibited splendid selectivity towards TcO4&#8208;. Such uncommon fluorescent recognition mechanism was well elucidated by the batch sorption experiments and density functional theoretical (DFT) calculations. It is found that only TcO4&#8208; could enter into the body of ZJU&#8208;X8 through anion exchange whereas other competing anions were excluded outside. Subsequently, after interaction between TcO4&#8208; and silver ions, the electron polarizations from pyrimidine rings to Ag+ cations significantly lowered the energy level of the &#960;* orbital and thus reduced the &#960;&#8208;&#960;* energy gap, resulting in a red&#8208;shift in the fluorescent spectra.</dc:description>

         <title>Diastereoselective Access to Tetracyclic Eight&#8208;Membered Lactams through a Dearomative Heck Reaction and an Alkylative Ring&#8208;Opening Driven by the Photoexcited Spiroindolines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An external&#8208;photocatalyst&#8208;free, light&#8208;driven alkylative ring&#8208;opening of stable spiroindolines was newly developed to construct indolo&#8208; and benzoannulated eight&#8208;membered lactams. The spiroindolines were prepared from tetrahydro&#8208; &#946; &#8208;carbolines by a dearomative Heck reaction. Mechanistic experimental studies on the alkylative ring opening suggest that a photoredox pathway is involved, in which the spiroindoline performs as both reagent and photosensitizer. DFT calculations show that the stereoselective radical addition toward a cyclic alkene is the key to the diastereoselective&#160;formation of tetracyclic medium&#8208;sized membered lactams.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Four Na&#8208;based ternary infrared nonlinear&#8208;optical (IR NLO) materials, Na  6  MQ  4  (M = Zn, Cd, Q = S, Se), were prepared via high temperature flux method.

         <title>Strong Equatorial Crystal Field Enhances the Axial Anisotropy and Energy Barrier for Spin Reversal Process in Yb2 Single Molecule Magnets</title>

The Magnetic Two: Three new dinuclear ytterbium complexes have been synthesized. Magnetic studies reveal that a strong equatorial crystal field enhances the axial anisotropy and effective energy barrier.







Abstract
The importance of equatorial crystal fields on magnetic anisotropy of ytterbium single molecule magnets (SMMs) is observed for the first time. Herein, we report three similar dinuclear ytterbium complexes with the formula [Yb2(3&#8208;OMe&#8208;L)2(DMF)2(NO3)2]&#8901;DMF (1), [Yb2(3&#8208;H&#8208;L)2(DMF)2(NO3)2]&#8901;DMF&#8901;H2O (2), and [Yb2(3&#8208;NO3&#8208;L)2(DMF)2(NO3)2] (3), [where 3&#8208;X&#8208;H2L=N&#8242;&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;3&#8208;X&#8208;benzylidene)picolinohydrazide, X=OMe (1), H (2) NO2 (3)]. Detailed magnetic measurements reveal the presence of weak antiferromagnetic interactions between the Yb centers and a field&#8208;induced slow relaxation of magnetization in all complexes. A higher energy barrier for spin reversal was observed for complex&#8197;1 (Ueff=50&#8197;K) and it decreases in the order of 2 (47&#8197;K) to 3 (40&#8197;K). Notably, complex&#8197;1 shows a remarkable energy barrier within the frequency range of 1&#8211;850&#8197;Hz reported for Yb&#8208;based SMMs. Further, ab initio calculations show a higher axial anisotropy and lower quantum tunneling of magnetization (QTM) in the ground state for 1 compared to 2 and 3. It was also observed that the presence of a strong crystal field in the equatorial plane (when the &#8737; O1&#8722;Yb&#8722;O3 bond angle is close to 90&#176;) enhances the axial anisotropy and improves the SMM behavior in the studied complexes. Both the experimental and theoretical analysis of relaxation dynamics discloses that Raman and QTM play major role on slow relaxation process for all complexes. To provide more insight into the exchange interactions, broken&#8208;symmetry DFT calculations were performed.

         <dc:description>Described herein is a function&#8208;oriented synthesis route and biological evaluation of pseudoguaianolide analogs. The 10&#8208;step synthetic route developed retains the topological complexity of the natural product, installs functional handles for late&#8208;stage diversification, and forges the key bioactive Michael acceptors early in the synthesis. The analogs were found to be low&#8208;micromolar Nrf2 activators and micromolar NF&#8208;&#954;B inhibitors and dependent on the local environment of the Michael acceptor moieties.</dc:description>

         <title>Experimental and Theoretical Investigation on Structural and Opto&#8208;electronic Properties of Fe&#8208;Doped Lead&#8208;Free Cs2AgBiCl6 Double Perovskite</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report the synthesis of Fe&#8208;doped Cs2AgBiCl6 lead&#8208;free double perovskite with blue emission using an antisolvent method. The crystal structure, morphology, optical properties, band structure, and stability of Fe&#8208;doped double perovskites are investigated systematically. Formation of Fe&#8208;doped Cs2AgBiCl6 double perovskite is confirmed by XRD and XPS analysis. XRD and TGA shows that the Cs2AgBiCl6 double perovskite has high structural and thermal stability, respectively. FE&#8208;SEM analysis revealed the formation of dipyramidal shape Cs2AgBiCl6 crystals. Furthermore, EDS mapping shows the overlapping of Cs, Bi, Ag, Fe, and Cl elements and homogenous incorporation of Fe in Cs2AgBiCl6 double perovskite. The Fe&#8208;doped Cs2AgBiCl6 double perovskite shows a strong absorption at 380 nm. It extends up to 700 nm, suggesting that sub&#8208;bandgap states transition may originate from the surface defect of the doped perovskite material. The radiative kinetics of the crystals was studied using the TCSPC technique. Lattice parameters and band gap value Fe&#8208;doped Cs2AgBiCl6 double perovskites predicted by the DFT calculations are confirmed by XRD and UV&#8208;Visible spectroscopy analysis. Time&#8208;dependent photo&#8208;response characteristics for Fe&#8208;doped Cs2AgBiCl6 double perovskite show fast response and recovery time of charge carriers. We believe that the successful incorporation of Fe in lead&#8208;free, environmentally friendly Cs2AgBiCl6 double perovskite can open a new class of doped double perovskites with significant potential opto&#8208;electronics applications, photocatalysts, and photovoltaics.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The novel diacetylene bridged terphenylic macrocycle 1 is presented and discussed in the context of rotationally restricted &#8220;Gel&#228;nder&#8221; oligomers. The 1,4&#8208;bis(phenylbuta&#8208;1,3&#8208;diyn&#8208;1&#8208;yl) benzene bridge of diacetylene 1 is significantly longer than its terphenyl backbone, forcing the bridge to bend around the central pylon. The synthesis of molecule 1 is based to a large extent on acetylene scaffolding strategies, profiting from orthogonal alkyne protection groups to close both macrocyclic subunits by oxidative acetylene coupling sequentially. The spatial arrangement and the dynamic enantiomerization process of the bicyclic target structure 1 are analyzed. In&#8208;depth NMR investigations not only reveal an unexpected spatial arrangement with both oligomer strands bent alongside the backbone, but also display the limited stability of the model compound in the presence of molecular oxygen.</dc:description>

         <title>Altered Membrane Mechanics Provides a Receptor&#8208;Independent&#160; Pathway for Serotonin Action</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract: Serotonin, an important signaling molecule in humans, has an unexpectedly high lipid membrane affinity.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Abstract: Serotonin, an important signaling molecule in humans, has an unexpectedly high lipid membrane affinity. The significance of this finding has evoked considerable speculation. Here we show that membrane binding by serotonin can directly modulate membrane pro&#173;perties and cellular function, providing an activity pathway completely independent of serotonin receptors. Atomic force microscopy shows that serotonin makes artificial lipid bilayers softer, and induces nucle&#173;ation of liquid disordered domains inside the raft&#8208;like liquid&#8208;ordered domains. Solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy corroborates this data at the atomic level, revealing a homogeneous decrease in the order para&#173;meter of the lipid chains in the presence of serotonin. In the RN46A immortalized serotonergic neuronal cell line, extracellular serotonin enhances transferrin receptor endocytosis, even in the presence of broad&#8208;spectrum serotonin receptor and transporter inhibitors.

         <title>Directed Design of a AuI Complex with a Reduced Mesoionic Carbene Radical&#8208;Ligand: Insights from 1,2,3&#8208;Triazolylidene Selenium Adducts and Extensive Electrochemical Investigations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbene&#8208;based radicals are important for both fundamental and applied chemical research. We herein report extensive electrochemical investigations of nine different 1,2,3&#8208;triazolylidene selenium adducts. We found that the half&#8208;wave potentials of the first reduction of the selones correlate with their calculated LUMO energies and LUMO energies of the corresponding triazolylidene based mesoionic carbenes (MICs). Furthermore, unexpected quasi&#8208;reversiblility of the reduction of two triazoline selones, exhibiting comparable reduction potentials, was discovered. Through UV&#8208;vis&#8208;NIR&#8208; and EPR&#8208; spectroelectrochemical investigations supported by DFT calculations, the radical anion was unambiguously assigned to be triazoline centered. This electrochemical behavior was transferred to a triazolylidene&#8208;type gold&#8208;MIC phenyl complex resulting in a MIC&#8208;radical coordinated AuI species. Apart from UV&#8208;vis&#8208;NIR&#8208; and EPR spectroelectrochemical investigations of the reduction, the reduced gold coordinated MIC&#8208;radical complex was also formed in situ in the bulk through chemical reduction. This is the first report of a monodentate triazolylidene&#8208;based MIC ligand that can be reduced to its anion radical in a metal complex. The results presented here provide design principles for stabilizing radicals based on MICs.</dc:description>

         <title>Photo&#8208;oxidation controlled surface pattern with responsive wrinkle and fluorescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Wrinkles and photo&#8208;oxidation reactions are widely found in soft materials, which are intimately associated with the failure of materials and structures. It is expected that the photo&#8208;oxidation process will have a positive effect on the material and its surface. Here, we report the photo&#8208;oxidation of 2&#8208;(4&#8208;Dietheylaminophenyl)&#8208;4,5&#8208;bis(4&#8208;methoxyphenyl) imidazole (DEA&#8208;TAI) into a bilayer wrinkling system to control surface wrinkle and fluorescent pattern, in which a supramolecular polymer network composed of carboxyl acid containing copolymer (PS&#8208;BA&#8208;AA) and DEA&#8208;TAI was used as the skin layer. Ultraviolet (UV) irradiation can induce photo&#8208;oxidation of the imidazole ring of DEA&#8208;TAI to weaken the intermolecular hydrogen bonding between PS&#8208;BA&#8208;AA and DEA&#8208;TAI, resulting in the release of stress in the bilayer system. The wrinkle morphology and fluorescence of the surface can be simultaneously regulated by photo&#8208;oxidation of DEA&#8208;TAI caused by UV light, and the resulting wrinkles are extremely sensitive to pH, which can be quickly and reversibly erased by NH 3 gas. Smart surfaces with specific hierarchical wrinkles and fluorescence can be achieved by selective irradiation with photomasks, which may find potential applications in smart displays and multi&#8208;code information storage.</dc:description>

         <title>5&#8208;Methylcytosine Substantially Enhances the Thermal Stability of DNA Minidumbbell</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Minidumbbell (MDB) is a recently identified non&#8208;B DNA structure which has been proposed to associate with genetic instabilities.&#160; It also serves as a functional structural motif in DNA nanotechnology.&#160; DNA molecular switches constructed using MDBs show instant and complete structural conversions with easy manipulations.&#160; The availability of stable MDBs can broaden their applications.&#160; In this work, we found that substitutions of cytosine with 5&#8208;methylcytosine could lead to a significant enhancement in the thermal stabilities of MDBs.&#160; Consecutive methylations of cytosine in MDBs brought about cumulative stabilization with a drastic increase in the melting temperature by 23 &#176;C.&#160; NMR solution structures of two MDBs containing 5&#8208;methylcytosine residues have been successfully determined and revealed that the enhanced stabilities resulted primarily from favorable hydrophobic contacts, more stable base pairs and enhanced base&#8208;base stackings involving the methyl groups of 5&#8208;methylcytosine.</dc:description>

         <title>Regioselective Synthesis of 1,2,3,4&#8208;Tetrasubstituted Arenes by Vicinal Functionalization of Arynes Derived from Aryl(Mes)iodonium Salts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we describe the synthesis of 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetra&#8208;substituted benzenoid rings, motifs found in pharmaceutical, agrochemical, and natural products. In the past, the regioselective syntheses of such compounds have been a significant challenge. We now report a method using substituted arynes derived from aryl(Mes)iodonium salts to access a range of densely functionalized 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrasubstituted benzenoid rings. Significantly, we show that halide substituents are compatible under these conditions, enabling post&#8208;synthetic elaboration via palladium&#8208;catalyzed coupling. This concise strategy is predicated on two regioselective events: 1) ortho&#8208; deprotonation of aryl(Mes)iodonium salts to generate a substituted aryne intermediate, and 2) regioselective trapping of said arynes. We have improved upon our previous reaction conditions to generate arynes at room temperature and in shorter reaction times. Density functional theory (DFT) computations and linear free energy relationship (LFER) analysis suggest the regioselectivity of deprotonation is influenced by both proximal and distal functional groups on the aryne precursor. A competition experiment further reveals the role of arene substituents on relative reactivity of aryne precursors.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A series of 9&#8208;borafluorene derivatives, functionalised with electron&#8208;donating groups, was prepared. Some of these 9&#8208;borafluorene compounds exhibit strong yellowish emission in solution and in the solid state with relative high quantum yields (up to 73.6% for  FMesB&#8208;Cz  as a neat film). Highly twisted donor groups suppress the charge transfer but the intrinsic photophysical properties of 9&#8208;borafluorene systems remain and the new compounds possess enhanced stability to the atmosphere. All of these compounds exhibit excellent thermal stability, revealing their potential for applications in materials science. OLED devices were fabricated with two of the highly emissive compounds, and they exhibit strong yellow&#8208;greenish electro&#8208;luminescence with maximum luminance intensity &gt; 22000 cd&#183;m  &#8208;2  . This is the first example of 9&#8208;borafluorene derivatives being used as light&#8208;emitting materials in OLED devices, and helps us to achieve a balance between maintaining their intrinsic properties and improving their stability.</dc:description>

         <title>Rapid and Mild Lactamization Using Highly Electrophilic Triphosgene in a Micro&#8208;Flow Reactor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lactams are cyclic amides that are indispensable as drugs and as drug candidates. Conventional lactamization includes acid&#8208;mediated approaches and coupling agent&#8208;mediated approaches that suffer from a narrow substrate scope, much waste, and/or high cost. Inexpensive, less wasteful and highly electrophilic reagent&#8208;mediated approaches are attractive, but there is an imminent risk of side reactions. Herein, we describe methods using highly electrophilic triphosgene in a micro&#8208;flow reactor that accomplish lactamization that are rapid (0.5&#8208;10 sec), mild, inexpensive, and less wasteful. We developed two methods, referred to here as A and B, using NMM and NMI, respectively. Various lactams as well as a cyclic peptide containing acid&#8208; and/or heat&#8208;labile functional groups were synthesized in good to high yields without the need for tedious purifications. Undesired reactions were successfully suppressed and the risk in handling triphosgene was minimized by the use of micro&#8208;flow technology.</dc:description>

Conventional lactamization includes acid&#8208;mediated approaches and coupling agent&#8208;mediated approaches that suffer from a narrow substrate scope, much waste, and/or high cost. Inexpensive, less wasteful and highly electrophilic reagent&#8208;mediated approaches are attractive, but there is an imminent risk of side reactions. Herein, we describe methods using highly electrophilic triphosgene in a micro&#8208;flow reactor that accomplish lactamization that are rapid (0.5&#8208;10 sec), mild, inexpensive, and less wasteful. We developed two methods, referred to here as A and B, using NMM and NMI, respectively. Various lactams as well as a cyclic peptide containing acid&#8208; and/or heat&#8208;labile functional groups were synthesized in good to high yields without the need for tedious purifications. Undesired reactions were successfully suppressed and the risk in handling triphosgene was minimized by the use of micro&#8208;flow technology.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cationic Bismuth Aminotroponiminates: Charge Controls Redox Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Central control: A series of bismuth aminotroponiminate cations are discussed and differences between neutral and cationic compounds in terms of coordination chemistry, Lewis acidity, and redox behavior are pinpointed. Specifically, cationization allows switching from ligand&#8208;centered redox events to metal&#8208;centered redox events, facilitating rare examples of quasi&#8208;reversible electron transfer at bismuth.







Abstract
The behavior of the redox&#8208;active aminotroponiminate (ATI) ligand in the coordination sphere of bismuth has been investigated in neutral and cationic compounds, [Bi(ATI)3] and [Bi(ATI)2Ln][A] (L=neutral ligand; n=0, 1; A=counteranion). Their coordination chemistry in solution and in the solid state has been analyzed through (variable&#8208;temperature) NMR spectroscopy, line&#8208;shape analysis, and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses, and their Lewis acidity has been evaluated by using the Gutmann&#8211;Beckett method (and modifications thereof). Cyclic voltammetry, in combination with DFT calculations, indicates that switching between ligand&#8208; and metal&#8208;centered redox events is possible by altering the charge of the compounds from 0 in neutral species to +1 in cationic compounds. This adds important facets to the rich redox chemistry of ATIs and to the redox chemistry of bismuth compounds, which is, so far, largely unexplored.

         <title>Regiospecific Synthesis of Calcium&#8208;Independent Daptomycin Antibiotics using a Chemoenzymatic Method</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ca not required: Daptomycin relies on calcium as an essential element for its strong antibiotic activity. Herein, a chemoenzymatic approach is used to synthesize regiospecific daptomycin derivatives that are independent of calcium and are more active than the parent drug against daptomycin&#8208;susceptible and daptomycin&#8208;resistant Gram&#8208;positive bacteria.







Abstract
Daptomycin (DAP) is a calcium (Ca2+)&#8208;dependent FDA&#8208;approved antibiotic drug for the treatment of Gram&#8208;positive infections. It possesses a complex pharmacophore hampering derivatization and/or synthesis of analogues. To mimic the Ca2+&#8208;binding effect, we used a chemoenzymatic approach to modify the tryptophan (Trp) residue of DAP and synthesize kinetically characterized and structurally elucidated regiospecific Trp&#8208;modified DAP analogues. We demonstrated that the modified DAPs are several times more active than the parent molecule against antibiotic&#8208;susceptible and antibiotic&#8208;resistant Gram&#8208;positive bacteria. Strikingly, and in contrast to the parent molecule, the DAP derivatives do not rely on calcium or any additional elements for activity.

         <title>Structural and Electronic Control of the Bidentate 1&#8208;(2&#8208;pyridyl)benzotriazole Ligand in Copper Chemistry with Application to Catalysis in the A3 Coupling Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Precatalyst control: [CuII(OTf)2(pyb)2]2&#8201;CH3CN (1), in which pyb is 1&#8208;(2&#8208;pyridyl)benzotriazole, enables the synthesis of a wide range of propargylamines by the A3 coupling reaction at room temperature in the absence of additives. The hybrid N,N&#8242;&#8208;bidentate pyb ligand imposes exclusive trans coordination at Cu, can rotate and modulate charge distribution and flux, thus orchestrating structural and electronic precatalyst control permitting activation of the C&#8722;H bond.







Abstract
The hybrid bidentate 1&#8208;(2&#8208;pyridyl)benzotriazole (pyb) ligand was introduced into 3d transition metal catalysis. Specifically, [CuII(OTf)2(pyb)2]&#8901;2&#8201;CH3CN (1) enables the synthesis of a wide range of propargylamines by the A3 coupling reaction at room temperature in the absence of additives. Experimental and high&#8208;level theoretical calculations suggest that the bridging N atom of the ligand imposes exclusive trans coordination at Cu and allows ligand rotation, while the N atom of the pyridine group modulates charge distribution and flux, and thus orchestrates structural and electronic precatalyst control permitting alkyne binding with simultaneous activation of the C&#8722;H bond via a transient CuI species.

         <title>Lewis Acidic Boranes, Lewis Bases, and Equilibrium Constants: A Reliable Scaffold for a Quantitative Lewis Acidity/Basicity Scale</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Loose or Lewis? A comprehensive set of experimental equilibrium constants reveals the strength of interactions between boron&#8208;centered Lewis acids and N&#8208;, O&#8208;, S&#8208;, and P&#8208;centered Lewis bases. Data analysis shows that two&#8208;parameter Equation&#8197;(1) enables Lewis adduct formation to be straightforwardly predicted for borane/Lewis base couples. Experimental data can be supplemented by quantum&#8208;chemical calculations for a rational design of borane&#8208;catalyzed reactions.







Abstract
A quantitative Lewis acidity/basicity scale toward boron&#8208;centered Lewis acids has been developed based on a set of 90 experimental equilibrium constants for the reactions of triarylboranes with various O&#8208;, N&#8208;, S&#8208;, and P&#8208;centered Lewis bases in dichloromethane at 20&#8201;&#176;C. Analysis with the linear free energy relationship log&#8201;KB=LAB+LBB allows equilibrium constants, KB, to be calculated for any type of borane/Lewis base combination through the sum of two descriptors, one for Lewis acidity (LAB) and one for Lewis basicity (LBB). The resulting Lewis acidity/basicity scale is independent of fixed reference acids/bases and valid for various types of trivalent boron&#8208;centered Lewis acids. It is demonstrated that the newly developed Lewis acidity/basicity scale is easily extendable through linear relationships with quantum&#8208;chemically calculated or common physical&#8211;organic descriptors and known thermodynamic data (&#916;H
). Furthermore, this experimental platform can be utilized for the rational development of borane&#8208;catalyzed reactions.

         <title>Cyclo&#8208;Ketal Xanthene Dyes: A New Class of Near&#8208;Infrared Fluorophores for Super&#8208;Resolution Imaging of Live Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, the emission of xanthene dye is pushed to the NIR region by replacing the 10&#8208;position O of rhodamines with a cyclo&#8208;ketal. The newly developed KRhs display intense fluorescence peaks at 700&#8197;nm (&#934;F 0.64) and, more importantly, exhibit stochastic fluorescence off&#8211;on switches to support super&#8208;resolution imaging. These KRh derivatives display great potential for fluorescence labeling and super&#8208;resolution imaging in the NIR region.







Abstract
Newly emerging super&#8208;resolution imaging techniques provide opportunities for precise observations on cellular microstructures. However, they also impose severe demands on fluorophores. Here, we develop a new series of NIR xanthene dyes, named as KRhs, by replacing the 10&#8208;position O of rhodamines with a cyclo&#8208;ketal. KRhs display an intense NIR emission peak at 700&#8197;nm with fluorescence quantum yields up to 0.64. More importantly, they, without the aid of enhancing buffer, exhibit stochastic fluorescence off&#8211;on switches to support time&#8208;resolved localization of single fluorophore. KRhs are functionalized into KRh&#8208;MitoFix, KRh&#8208;Mem and KRh&#8208;Halo that demonstrate mitochondria, plasma membrane and fusion protein targeting ability, respectively. Consequently, these KRh probes demonstrate straightforward usage for super&#8208;resolution imaging of these targets in live cells. Therefore, KRhs merit future development for fluorescence labeling and super&#8208;resolution imaging in the NIR region.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;In this study&lt;/b&gt;, the emission of xanthene dye is pushed to the NIR region by replacing the 10&#8208;position O of rhodamines with a cyclo&#8208;ketal. The newly developed &lt;b&gt;KRh&lt;/b&gt;s display intense fluorescence peaks at 700&#8197;nm (&lt;i&gt;&#934;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; 0.64) and, more importantly, exhibit stochastic fluorescence off&#8211;on switches to support super&#8208;resolution imaging. These &lt;b&gt;KRh&lt;/b&gt; derivatives display great potential for fluorescence labeling and super&#8208;resolution imaging in the NIR region.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Newly emerging super&#8208;resolution imaging techniques provide opportunities for precise observations on cellular microstructures. However, they also impose severe demands on fluorophores. Here, we develop a new series of NIR xanthene dyes, named as &lt;b&gt;KRh&lt;/b&gt;s, by replacing the 10&#8208;position O of rhodamines with a cyclo&#8208;ketal. &lt;b&gt;KRh&lt;/b&gt;s display an intense NIR emission peak at 700&#8197;nm with fluorescence quantum yields up to 0.64. More importantly, they, without the aid of enhancing buffer, exhibit stochastic fluorescence off&#8211;on switches to support time&#8208;resolved localization of single fluorophore. &lt;b&gt;KRh&lt;/b&gt;s are functionalized into &lt;b&gt;KRh&#8208;MitoFix&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;KRh&#8208;Mem&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;KRh&#8208;Halo&lt;/b&gt; that demonstrate mitochondria, plasma membrane and fusion protein targeting ability, respectively. Consequently, these &lt;b&gt;KRh&lt;/b&gt; probes demonstrate straightforward usage for super&#8208;resolution imaging of these targets in live cells. Therefore, &lt;b&gt;KRh&lt;/b&gt;s merit future development for fluorescence labeling and super&#8208;resolution imaging in the NIR region.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Noncovalent Helicene Structure between Nucleic Acids and Cyanuric Acid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel noncovalent helicene structure between nucleic acids and cyanuric acid is revealed by molecular dynamics simulations. The previously proposed hexameric rosette structure is disfavored during the simulation.







Abstract
Cyanuric acid (CA), a triazine heterocycle, is extensively utilized for noncovalent self&#8208;assembly. The association between poly(adenine) and CA into micron&#8208;length fibers was a remarkable observation made by Sleiman and co&#8208;workers, who proposed that adenine and CA adopt a hexameric rosette configuration in analogy with previously reported structures for CA assemblies. However, recent experimental observations from the Krishnamurthy group led to a reevaluation of the hexameric rosette model, wherein they have proposed a hydrogen&#8208;bonded helicene model as an alternative. Our molecular dynamics simulations show that the hexad model is indeed unlikely and that this novel noncovalent helicene geometry, where the adenine and CA bases form an extended helical hydrogen&#8208;bond network across the system, is a more probable structural motif. The existence of noncovalent helicene compounds may have wide&#8208;ranging applications in DNA nanotechnology and helicene chemistry.

         <title>Tris(pentafluoroethyl)difluorophosphorane: A Versatile Fluoride Acceptor for Transition Metal Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of titanium, nickel, and copper complexes stabilized by the weakly coordinating anion (WCA) [(C2F5)3PF3]&#8722; (FAP anion) was obtained on reaction of the parent fluoride complexes with the strong Lewis acid (C2F5)3PF2. The reaction products depend on the solvent used or additional Lewis bases present during the fluoride transfer from the metal complexes to the phosphorane.







Abstract
Fluoride abstraction from different types of transition metal fluoride complexes [LnMF] (M=Ti, Ni, Cu) by the Lewis acid tris(pentafluoroethyl)difluorophosphorane (C2F5)3PF2 to yield cationic transition metal complexes with the tris(pentafluoroethyl)trifluorophosphate counterion (FAP anion, [(C2F5)3PF3]&#8722;) is reported. (C2F5)3PF2 reacted with trans&#8208;[Ni(iPr2Im)2(ArF)F] (iPr2Im=1,3&#8208;diisopropylimidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene; ArF=C6F5, 1&#8201;a; 4&#8208;CF3&#8208;C6F4, 1&#8201;b; 4&#8208;C6F5&#8208;C6F4, 1&#8201;c) through fluoride transfer to form the complex salts trans&#8208;[Ni(iPr2Im)2(solv)(ArF)]FAP (2&#8201;a&#8208;c[solv]; solv=Et2O, CH2Cl2, THF) depending on the reaction medium. In the presence of stronger Lewis bases such as carbenes or PPh3, solvent coordination was suppressed and the complexes trans&#8208;[Ni(iPr2Im)2(PPh3)(C6F5)]FAP (trans&#8208;2&#8201;a[PPh3]) and cis&#8208;[Ni(iPr2Im)2(Dipp2Im)(C6F5)]FAP (cis&#8208;2&#8201;a[Dipp2Im]) (Dipp2Im=1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) were isolated. Fluoride abstraction from [(Dipp2Im)CuF] (3) in CH2Cl2 or 1,2&#8208;difluorobenzene led to the isolation of [{(Dipp2Im)Cu}2]2+2&#8201;FAP&#8722; (4). Subsequent reaction of 4 with PPh3 and different carbenes resulted in the complexes [(Dipp2Im)Cu(LB)]FAP (5&#8201;a&#8211;e, LB=Lewis base). In the presence of C6Me6, fluoride transfer afforded [(Dipp2Im)Cu(C6Me6)]FAP (5&#8201;f), which serves as a source of [(Dipp2Im)Cu)]+. Fluoride abstraction of [Cp2TiF2] (7) resulted in the formation of dinuclear [FCp2Ti(&#956;&#8208;F)TiCp2F]FAP (8) (Cp=&#951;5&#8208;C5H5) with one terminal fluoride ligand at each titanium atom and an additional bridging fluoride ligand.

Doubly inverted: Silver&#8208;promoted fluorination of &#945;&#8208;bromoamides proceeds under mild conditions via an aziridinone intermediate with double inversion of configuration. This approach can provide a variety of fluorinated products with high yield, chemoselectivity, and stereospecificity.







Abstract
Silver&#8208;promoted C&#8722;F bond formation in &#945;&#8208;bromoamides by using AgF under mild conditions is reported. This simple method enables access to tertiary, secondary, and primary alkyl fluorides involving biomolecular scaffolds. This transformation is applicable to primary and secondary amides and shows broad functional&#8208;group tolerance. Kinetics experiments revealed that the reaction rate increased in the order of 3&#176;&gt;2&#176;&gt;1&#176; &#945;&#8208;carbon atom. In addition, it was found that the acidic amide proton plays an important role in accelerating the reaction. Mechanistic studies suggested generation of an aziridinone intermediate that undergoes subsequent nucleophilic addition to form the C&#8722;F bond with stereospecificity (i.e., retention of configuration). The synthesis of sterically hindered alcohols and ethers by using AgI is also demonstrated. Examples of reactions of &#945;&#8208;bromoamides with O nucleophiles are presented.

         <title>Aerobic Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Salicylaldehydic Cformyl&#8722;H Arylations with Arylboronic Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A challenging copper&#8208;catalyzed Cformyl&#8722;H arylation of salicylaldehydes with arylboronic acids has been developed. It involves unique salicylaldehydic copper species that differ from reported salicylaldehydic rhodacycles and palladacycles, as well as high chemoselectivity for Cformyl&#8722;H bond compared to the phenolic O&#8722;H bond based on copper catalysis.







Abstract
We report a challenging copper&#8208;catalyzed Cformyl&#8722;H arylation of salicylaldehydes with arylboronic acids that involves unique salicylaldehydic copper species that differ from reported salicylaldehydic rhodacycles and palladacycles. This protocol has high chemoselectivity for the Cformyl&#8722;H bond compared to the phenolic O&#8722;H bond involving copper catalysis under high reaction temperatures. This approach is compatible with a wide range of salicylaldehyde and arylboronic acid substrates, including estrone and carbazole derivatives, which leads to the corresponding arylation products. Mechanistic studies show that the 2&#8208;hydroxy group of the salicylaldehyde substrate triggers the formation of salicylaldehydic copper complexes through a CuI/CuII/CuIII catalytic cycle.

         <title>Synthesis and Properties of Higher Nuclearity Polyazanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chain gang: Polyazanes of up to five &#963;&#8208;bonded nitrogen atoms were prepared by sequential addition to diazo reagents. Structural analyses showed that the polynitrogen chains adopt a helical conformation maintained by the carboxyl substituents. The conformations persist in solution. Polyazanes are increasingly less reducing the more N atoms are in the chain.







Abstract
Polyazanes (i.e., higher nuclearity homologues of hydrazines) with increasing numbers of bound nitrogen atoms (from 3 to 5), including the first pentazane ever described, were prepared by the addition of lower&#8208;order polyazanes to diazo reagents. A structure was obtained. It was shown that the polynitrogen chains adopt a helical conformation. DFT modeling shows that the arrangement persists in solution. Although the polyazanes are all reducing agents, they become less so as the number of nitrogens increases.

         <title>Novel Arylindigoids by Late&#8208;Stage Derivatization of Biocatalytically Synthesized Dibromoindigo</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Indigoids represent natural product&#8208;based compounds applicable as organic semiconductors and photoresponsive materials. Yet modified indigo derivatives are difficult to access by chemical synthesis. Thus a biocatalytic approach applying several consecutive selective C&#8211;H functionalizations was developed that selectively provides access to various indigoids: Enzymatic halogenation of l&#8208;tryptophan followed by indole generation with tryptophanase yields 5&#8208;, 6&#8208; and 7&#8208;bromoindoles. Subsequent hydroxylation using a flavin monooxygenase furnishes dibromoindigo that is derivatized by acylation. This four&#8208;step one&#8208;pot cascade gives Boc&#8208;protected dibromoindigo in good isolated yields. The halogen substituent allows for late&#8208;stage diversification by cross&#8208;coupling directly performed in the crude mixture, thus enabling synthesis of 5,5&#8217;&#8208; and 6,6&#8217;&#8208;diarylindigo derivatives. This chemoenzymatic approach provides a modular platform towards novel indigoids with attractive spectral properties.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Unprecedented metalated phosphonite boranes were prepared from PH&#8208;substituted precursors and silyl amides. While potassium derivatives were thermally stable and could even be isolated and structurally characterised, lithiated analogues proved unstable towards self&#8208;condensation under cleavage of LiOR at ambient temperature. Reaction studies revealed that the metalated phosphonite boranes exhibit ambiphilic character. Their synthetic potential as nucleophilic building blocks was demonstrated in the synthesis of the first stannylated phosphonite representing a new structural motif in phosphine chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>How the physicochemical properties of the bulk material affect the ablation crater profile, mass balance and bubble dynamics during single&#8208;pulse, nanosecond laser ablation in water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Understanding the key steps that drive the laser&#8208;based synthesis of colloids is a prerequisite for learning how to optimize the ablation process in terms of the nanoparticle output and functional design of the nanomaterials. Even though many studies focus on cavitation bubble formation using single&#8208;pulse ablation conditions, the ablation efficiency and nanoparticle properties are typically investigated under prolonged ablation conditions with repetition rate lasers. Linking single&#8208;pulse and multiple&#8208;pulse ablation is difficult due to limitations induced by gas formation cross&#8208;effects, which occur on longer timescales and depend on the target materials' oxidation&#8208;sensitivity. Therefore, this study investigates the ablation and cavitation bubble dynamics under nanosecond, single laser pulse conditions for six different bulk materials (Au, Ag, Cu, Fe, Ti, and Al). Also, the effective threshold fluences, ablation volumes and penetration depths are quantified for the these materials. The thermal and chemical properties of the corresponding bulk materials not only favor the formation of larger spot sizes but also lead to the highest molar ablation efficiencies for low melting materials such as Al. Furthermore, the concept of the cavitation bubble growth linked with the oxidation sensitivity of the ablated material is discussed. With this, evidence is provided that intensive chemical reactions occurring during the very early timescale of ablation are significantly enhanced by the bubble collapse.</dc:description>

         <title>Characterization of the Simplest Thiolimine &#8211; The Higher Energy Tautomer of Thioformamide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As sulfur containing organic molecules thioamides and their isomers are conceivable intermediates in prebiotic chemistry,  e. g.  , in the formation of amino acids and thiazoles and resemble viable candidates for detection in interstellar media. Here we report the characterization of parent thioformamide in the solid state  via  single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and its photochemical interconversion to its hitherto unreported higher energy tautomer thiolimine in inert argon and dinitrogen matrices. Upon photogeneration, four conformers of thiolimine form, whose ratio depends on the employed wavelength. One of these conformers interconverts due to quantum mechanical tunneling with a half&#8208;life of 30&#8211;45 min in both matrix materials at 3 and 20 K. A spontaneous reverse reaction from thiolimine to thioformamide is not observed. To support our experimental findings, we explored the potential energy surface of the system at the AE&#8208;CCSD(T)/aug&#8208;cc&#8208;pCVTZ level of theory and computed tunneling half&#8208;lives with the CVT/SCT approach applying DFT methods.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrothermal&#8208;induced formation of well&#8208;defined hollow carbons with curvature&#8208;activated N&#8208;C sites for Zn&#8208;air batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;free carbons have been regarded as one of the promising materials alternative to precious metal catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), due to their high activity and stability. In this paper, well&#8208;defined N&#8208;doped hollow carbons (NHCs) are firstly achieved by an ammonia hydrothermal synthesis that are environmentally friendly and suitable for mass production in industry, using a commercial solid&#8208;type black carbon as raw material. Moreover, the shell thickness of the NHCs can be easily tuned by this hydrothermal strategy. Zn&#8208;air battery test results reveal the shell thickness&#8208;dependent activity and durability for ORR over the NHCs, which exceed that obtained by commercial Pt/C (20 wt.%, JM). The enhanced battery performance can be attributed to the curvature&#8208;activated N&#8208;C moieties on the hollow carbon surface, served as the main active sites for ORR as evidenced by DFT calculations. The proposed approach may open a way for designing curved hollow carbons with high graphitization degree and dopant nitrogen level for metal&#8208;air batteries or fuel cells.</dc:description>

         <title>The Prospect of Dimensionality in Porous Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>With the advent of silicon&#8208;based semiconductors, a plethora of previously unknown technologies became possible. The development of lightweight low&#8208;dimensional organic semiconductors followed soon after. However, the efficient charge/electron transfers enabled by the non&#8208;porous 3D structure of silicon is rather challenging to be realized by their (metal&#8208;)organic counterparts. Nevertheless, the demand for lighter, more efficient semiconductors is steadily increasing resulting in a growing interest in (metal&#8208;) organic semiconductors. These novel materials are faced with a variety of challenges originating from their chemical design, their packing and crystallinity. Although the effect of molecular design is quite well understood, the influence of dimensionality and the associated change in properties i.e., porosity, packing, conjugation is still an uncharted area in (metal&#8208;) organic semiconductors, yet highly important for their practical utilization. In this minireview, an overview on the design and synthesis of porous semiconductors, with a particular emphasis on organic semiconductors, is presented and the influence of dimensionality is discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Rational molecular design of multifunctional blue material based on phenanthroimidazole derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;performance deep&#8208;blue emitters with EQEs over 5% are still scarce in OLEDs. In this work, by introducing the [1,2,4] triazolo [1,5&#8208;a] pyridine (TP) unit to the N1 position of phenanthroimidazole, two luminescent materials, PTPTPA and PTPBTPA were obtained. Based on systematic photophysical analysis, we found that the TP block is suitable for constructing HLCT emitters. Its moderate electron withdrawing ability and rigid planar structure can enhance the CT component while ensuring the color purity. In addition, compared with PTPTPA, the increased phenyl ring of PTPBPTA not only increases the oscillator strength, but also shortens the stokes shift. TDDFT calculations point to facile RISC processes in PTPBTPA from high&#8208;lying triplet states to the singlet excited state. PTPBTPA presents impressive performances when serving as non&#8208;doped device (EQE  max  = 7.11%, CIE: (0.15, 0.09)), as well as a high&#8208;performance host for yellow and red PhOLEDs. By doping yellow (PPYBA) and red (BTPG) phosphorescent dye into PTPBTPA, a white OLED with a high EQE of 23.85% was achieved. The successful design of PTPBTPA not only provides an optimization choice for OLED emitters, but also demonstrates the empirical rules for the design of multifunctional deep&#8208;blue emitters.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Lanthanum orthoantimonate was synthesized using a solid&#8208;state synthesis method. To enhance the possible protonic conductivity, samples with the addition of 1 mol% Ca in La&#8208;site, were also prepared. The structure was studied by the means of X&#8208;ray diffraction, which showed that both specimens were single phase. The materials crystallized in the space group P2  1  /n. Dilatometry revealed that material expands non&#8208;linearly with the temperature. The nature of this deviation is unknown, however, the calculated linear fraction thermal expansion coefficient was 9.56&#215;10  &#8208;6  1/K. Electrical properties studies showed that the material is a proton conductor in oxidizing conditions, which was confirmed both by temperature studies in wet in dry air, but also by the H/D isotope exchange experiment. The conductivity was rather modest, peaking at order 10  &#8208;6  S/cm at 800&#176;C, but this can be further improved by microstructure and doping optimization. This is the first time when protonic conductivity in lanthanum orthoantimonates is reported.</dc:description>

         <title>Twisting versus Delocalization in CAAC&#8208; and NHC&#8208;Stabilized Boron&#8208;Based Biradicals: The Roles of Sterics and Electronics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Twist or not: A thorough computational investigation of the origin of the distinct electrostructural properties of twisted boron&#8208;based biradicals featuring unsaturated C2R2 (R=Et, Me) bridges is presented. Steric effects are mostly responsible for the preference of twisted over planar structures, while the ground state multiplicity of the twisted structure is modulated by the &#963; framework of the bridge, with different R groups leading to distinct multiplicities.







Abstract
Twisted boron&#8208;based biradicals featuring unsaturated C2R2 (R=Et, Me) bridges and stabilization by cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbenes (CAACs) were recently prepared. These species show remarkable geometrical and electronic differences with respect to their unbridged counterparts. Herein, a thorough computational investigation on the origin of their distinct electrostructural properties is performed. It is shown that steric effects are mostly responsible for the preference for twisted over planar structures. The ground&#8208;state multiplicity of the twisted structure is modulated by the &#963; framework of the bridge, and different R groups lead to distinct multiplicities.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twisted boron&#8208;based biradicals featuring unsaturated C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (R=Et, Me) bridges and stabilization by cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbenes (CAACs) were recently prepared. These species show remarkable geometrical and electronic differences with respect to their unbridged counterparts. Herein, a thorough computational investigation on the origin of their distinct electrostructural properties is performed. It is shown that steric effects are mostly responsible for the preference for twisted over planar structures. The ground&#8208;state multiplicity of the twisted structure is modulated by the &#963; framework of the bridge, and different R groups lead to distinct multiplicities. In line with the experimental data, a planar structure driven by delocalization effects is observed as global minimum for R=H. The synthetic elusiveness of C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;bridged systems featuring N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) was also investigated. These results could contribute to the engineering of novel main group biradicals.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Structure&#8211;Property Relationships in Bithiophenes with Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Substituents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Side&#8208;chain engineering through hydrogen bonding: Hydrogen&#8208;bonding terminal substituents can be used as structure&#8208;directing motifs to tailor the optoelectronic properties of &#960;&#8208;conjugated materials in the solid&#8208;state. This approach has significant potential for the design of organic and polymer semiconductors.







Abstract
The use of crystal engineering to control the supramolecular arrangement of &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules in the solid&#8208;state is of considerable interest for the development of novel organic electronic materials. In this study, we investigated the effect of combining of two types of supramolecular interaction with different geometric requirements, amide hydrogen bonding and &#960;&#8208;interactions, on the &#960;&#8208;overlap between calamitic &#960;&#8208;conjugated cores. To this end, we prepared two series of bithiophene diesters and diamides with methylene, ethylene, or propylene spacers between the bithiophene core and the functional groups in their terminal substituents. The hydrogen&#8208;bonded bithiophene diamides showed significantly denser packing of the bithiophene cores than the diesters and other known &#945;,&#969;&#8208;disubstituted bithiophenes. The bithiophene packing density reach a maximum in the bithiophene diamide with an ethylene spacer, which had the smallest longitudinal bithiophene displacement and infinite 1D arrays of electronically conjugated, parallel, and almost linear N&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O=C hydrogen bonds. The synergistic hydrogen bonding and &#960;&#8208;interactions were attributed to the favorable conformation mechanics of the ethylene spacer and resulted in H&#8208;type spectroscopic aggregates in solid&#8208;state absorption spectroscopy. These results demonstrate that the optoelectronic properties of &#960;&#8208;conjugated materials in the solid&#8208;state may be tailored systematically by side&#8208;chain engineering, and hence that this approach has significant potential for the design of organic and polymer semiconductors.

         <title>Cold&#8208;Resistant Nitrogen/Sulfur Dual&#8208;Doped Graphene Fiber Supercapacitors with Solar&#8211;Thermal Energy Conversion Effect</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Capacitors in the cold: Although graphene fiber&#8208;based supercapacitors are promising for wearable electronic devices, their performance is limited in cold environments. Herein, porous nitrogen/sulfur dual&#8208;doped graphene fibers (NS&#8208;GFs) are synthesized by hydrothermal self&#8208;assembly followed by thermal annealing, exhibiting an excellent capacitive performance of 401&#8197;F&#8201;cm&#8722;3 at 400&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;3. The all&#8208;solid&#8208;state supercapacitor assembled with NS&#8208;GF and graphene oxide exhibits a solar&#8211;thermal energy conversion of the electrolyte, extending the operating temperature range of the supercapacitor to 0&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
Although graphene fiber&#8208;based supercapacitors are promising for wearable electronic devices, the low energy density of electrodes and poor cold resistance of aqueous electrolytes limit their wide application in cold environments. Herein, porous nitrogen/sulfur dual&#8208;doped graphene fibers (NS&#8208;GFs) are synthesized by hydrothermal self&#8208;assembly followed by thermal annealing, exhibiting an excellent capacitive performance of 401&#8197;F&#8201;cm&#8722;3 at 400&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;3 because of the synergistic effect of heteroatom dual&#8208;doping. The assembled symmetric all&#8208;solid&#8208;state supercapacitor with polyvinyl alcohol/H2SO4/graphene oxide gel electrolyte exhibits a high capacitance of 221&#8197;F&#8201;cm&#8722;3 and a high energy density of 7.7&#8197;mWh&#8201;cm&#8722;3 at 80&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;3. Interestingly, solar&#8211;thermal energy conversion of the electrolyte with 0.1&#8197;wt&#8201;% graphene oxide extends the operating temperature range of the supercapacitor to 0&#8201;&#176;C. Furthermore, the photocatalysis effect of the dual&#8208;doped heteroatoms increases the capacitance of NS&#8208;GFs. At an ambient temperature of 0&#8201;&#176;C, the capacitance increases from 0 to 182&#8197;F cm&#8722;3 under 1&#8197;sun irradiation because of the excellent solar light absorption and efficient solar&#8211;thermal energy conversion of graphene oxide, preventing the aqueous electrolyte from freezing. The flexible supercapacitor exhibits a long cycle life, good bending resistance, reliable scalability, and ability to power visual electronics, showing great potential for outdoor electronics in cold environments.

         <title>How to Build Prussian Blue Based Water Oxidation Catalytic Assemblies: Common Trends and Strategies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Blue is the color: Cobalt&#8208;based Prussian blue analogues (CoFe PBAs) have been established as one of the well&#8208;known non&#8208;oxide bulk water oxidation catalysts, which can operate even under harsh acidic conditions. This review presents the common synthetic strategies to enhance their catalytic activities and general trends in Prussian blue based photocatalytic, photoelectrocatalytic, and dye&#8208;sensitized photoelectrochemical assemblies.







Abstract
Prussian blue (PB) and its analogues (PBAs) have at least a three&#8208;century&#8208;long history in coordination chemistry. Recently, cobalt&#8208;based PBAs have been acknowledged as efficient and robust water oxidation catalysts. Given the flexibility in their synthesis, the structure and morphology of cobalt&#8208;based PBAs have been modified for enhanced catalytic activity under electrochemical (EC), photocatalytic (PC), and photoelectrochemical (PEC) conditions. Here, in this review, the work on cobalt&#8208;based PBAs is presented in four sections: i)&#8197;electrocatalytic water oxidation with bare PBAs, ii)&#8197;photocatalytic processes in the presence of a photosensitizer (PS), iii)&#8197;photoelectrochemical water oxidation by coupling PBAs to proper semiconductors (SCs), and iv)&#8197;the utilization of PBA&#8208;PS assemblies coated on SCs for the dye&#8208;sensitized photoelectrochemical water oxidation. This review will guide readers through the structure and catalytic activity relationship in cobalt&#8208;based PBAs by describing the role of each structural component. Furthermore, this review aims to provide insight into common strategies to enhance the catalytic activity of PBAs.

         <title>Iron catalyzed double bond isomerization: evidence for an Fe(I)/Fe(III) catalytic cycle</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Iron&#8208;catalyzed isomerization of alkenes is reported using an iron(II) &#946;&#8208;diketiminate pre&#8208;catalyst. The reaction proceeds with a catalytic amount of a hydride source, such as pinacol borane (HBpin) or ammonia borane (H 3 N&#183;BH 3 ). Reactivity with both allyl arenes and aliphatic alkenes has been studied. The catalytic mechanism was investigated by a variety of means, including deuteration studies, Density Functional Theory (DFT) and Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. The data obtained support a pre&#8208;catalyst activation step that gives access to an &#951; 2 &#8208;coordinated alkene Fe(I) complex, followed by oxidative addition of the alkene to give an Fe(III) intermediate, which then undergoes reductive elimination to allow release of the isomerization product.</dc:description>

         <title>Helically and Linearly Fused Rylenediimide&#8208;Hexabenzocoronenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Perylene&#8208; as well as naphthalenediimides were fused to hexabenzocoronenes (HBCs) at their imide position to realize highly &#960;&#8208;extended D&#8208;A&#8208;hybrids. Successful isomer separation in the first step was decisive to guarantee a straightforward synthetic sequence. Hexaphenylbenzenes (HPBs) as precursors were accessed  via  Diels&#8208;Alder reactions and reacted in a Scholl oxidation to yield the respective HBC derivatives. The fully conjugated benzimidazole linker, which separates the electron donating HBC from the electron accepting rylenediimide enables the formation of either a linear or a helical configuration. Largely different chemical, physical, and optoelectrical characteristics are noted for the two configurations. What stands out is their aggregation and their excited state deactivation depending on the solvent polarity. Results from global analysis of the femtosecond transient absorption data corroborate the formation of a charge&#8208;transfer (CT) state that is stabilized in the helically fused configuration relative to the linear analogue. But, a comparison with spectroelectrochemical experiments failed to disclose evidence for a charge&#8208;separated (CS) state.</dc:description>

         <title>Tenfold Metalation of Ferrocene: Synthesis, Structures and Metallophilic Interactions in FeC10(HgX)10</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The permercuration of ferrocene is achieved by reacting ferrocene with 10 equivalents of mercury(II) butyrate Hg(O2CC3H7)2  in a facile one&#8208;pot reaction in multi&#8208;gram scale and high yields. The butyrate groups in FeC10(HgX)10  (X = O2CC3H7) can be exchanged by treatment with trifluoro&#8208; or trichloroacetic acid (X = O2CCF3, O2CCCl3). Substitution of the trifluoroacetate groups by halides (X = Cl, F) proceeds easily in aqueous THF. The completeness of metalation was confirmed by NMR and vibrational spectroscopy, mass spectrometry as well as elemental analysis. Additionally, we present the first crystal structures of permetallated metallocenes: FeC10(HgX)10  (X = Cl, O2CCF3, O2CCCl3).</dc:description>

         <title>Dominant Pseudocapacitance Filling Charge&#8208;Discharge Voltage Gap of Flexible Hybrid Zinc&#8208;Based Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The high charge&#8208;discharge voltage gap is one of the main bottlenecks of zinc&#8208;air batteries (ZABs) because of kinetically sluggish rate of oxygen reduction/evolution reaction (ORR/OER) on the oxygen electrode side, and thus an efficient bifunctional catalyst for ORR and OER is highly pursued. Here, a honeycomb&#8208;like MnCo2O4.5 spheres, as an efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst, has been demonstrated that both ORR and OER catalytic activity are promoted by the Mn (IV) induced oxygen vacancy defects and multi&#8208;active sites. Importantly, the rich multivalent ion and defect structure endow stable pseudocapacitance within the inactive&#8208;region of ORR and OER, thus affording a low charge&#8208;discharge voltage gap (0.43 V at 10 mA cm&#8208;2) when it is employed in the flexible hybrid Zn&#8208;base battery. This mechanism provides unprecedented and valuable insights in the development of next&#8208;generation metal&#8208;air batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Photohomolysis and Photoheterolysis in Aryl Sulfonates and Aryl Phosphates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The photochemistry of aryl sulfonates and phosphates (ArOX) has a role in different respects including the application in eco&#8208;sustainable arylations, in the design of innovative photoacid generators and in biological applications. However, the fate of the photoreaction depends on several factors namely the nature of the sulfonate/phosphate group, the substituents present on the aromatic ring and the polarity of the medium. Aim of this work is the photophysical investigation of selected aryl sulfonates and phosphates by laser flash photolysis experiments, to have insights on their photoreactive pathways for their possible applications. The judicious choice of the leaving group and on the nature of the substituents on the aromatic ring may lead either to a photohomolysis of the ArO&#8208;X bond or a photoheterolysis of the Ar&#8208;OX bond.</dc:description>

         <title>Novel ferrocene&#8208;appended &#946;&#8208;ketoimines and related BF2 derivatives with significant aggregation&#8208;induced emission and second&#8208;order nonlinear optical properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of new &#946;&#8208;ketoimines containing a ferrocene moiety and related BF&#8322; derivatives were synthesized and structurally characterized. The solvatochromism of the &#946;&#8208;ketoimines was studied, putting in evidence a red shift by increasing the solvent polarity. This positive solvatochromism can be attributed to the more polarized excited state, with respect to the ground state, due to intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) transitions. &#946;&#8208;ketoimines exhibit a weak emission, attributable to the excited state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) phenomenon. This ESIPT effect is suppressed upon restriction of the keto&#8208;enamine tautomerism by addition of BF&#8323;&#183;OEt&#8322; which affords the related BF&#8322; complexes, characterized by an enhancement of the fluorescence through the ICT effect. Both b&#8208;ketoimines and BF&#8322; complexes, examined in mixtures of CH&#8323;CN/H&#8322;O, exhibit a significant aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) behavior, due to restriction of intramolecular rotation (RIR) in the aggregated state. The frontier molecular orbital levels, ground and excited state dipole moments (&#956;g and &#956;e), and the origin of electronic absorption spectra were studied by using time&#8208;dependent density functional theory (TD&#8208;DFT) calculations. The second&#8208;order nonlinear optical (NLO) properties were determined by the EFISH technique. The &#956;&#946;1907 value of all &#946;&#8208;ketoimines increases upon the formation of the related BF&#8322; complex, mainly due to an enhancement of the ground state dipole moment. Some of these novel compounds are excellent multifunctional candidates for NLO and luminescence applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Combined Dynamic Kinetic Resolution and C&#8208;H Functionalization for Facile Synthesis of Non&#8208;Biaryl&#8208;Atropisomer&#8208;type Axially Chiral Organosilanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite asymmetric C&#8208;H functionalization has been available for the synthesis structurally diverse molecules, catalytic dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) approaches to change racemic stereogenic axes remain synthetically challenges in this field. Here we present a concise palladium&#8208;catalyzed dynamic kinetic resolution combined with C&#8208;H functionalization involving olefination and alkynylation for the highly efficient synthesis of non&#8208;biaryl&#8208;atropisomer&#8208;type (NBA) axially chiral oragnosilanes. The chemistry proceeds through two different and distinct dynamic kinetic resolutions: first, an atroposelective C&#8208;H olefination or alkynylation produced axially chiral vinylsilanes or alkynylsilanes as a new family of non&#8208;biaryl atropisomers (NBA), and second, the extension of this DKR strategy to twofold o,o'&#8208;C&#8208;H functionalization led to the multifunctional axially chiral organosilicon compounds with up to &gt;99% ee.</dc:description>

The chemistry proceeds through two different and distinct dynamic kinetic resolutions: first, an atroposelective C&#8208;H olefination or alkynylation produced axially chiral vinylsilanes or alkynylsilanes as a new family of non&#8208;biaryl atropisomers (NBA), and second, the extension of this DKR strategy to twofold o,o'&#8208;C&#8208;H functionalization led to the multifunctional axially chiral organosilicon compounds with up to &amp;gt;99% ee.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>In situ X&#8208;ray Diffraction Investigation of the Crystallisation of Perfluorinated Ce(IV)&#8208;based Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks with UiO&#8208;66 and MIL&#8208;140 architectures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report on the results of an  in situ  synchrotron powder X&#8208;ray diffraction study of the crystallisation in aqueous medium of two recently discovered perfluorinated Ce(IV)&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), analogues of the already well investigated Zr(IV)&#8208;based UiO&#8208;66 and MIL&#8208;140A, namely, F4_UiO&#8208;66(Ce) and F4_MIL&#8208;140A(Ce). The two MOFs were originally obtained in pure form in similar conditions, using ammonium cerium nitrate and tetrafluoroterephthalic acid as reagents, and small variations of the reaction parameters were found to yield mixed phases. Here, we investigate the crystallisation of these compounds, varying parameters such as temperature, amount of the protonation modulator nitric acid (HNO  3  ) and amount of the coordination modulator acetic acid (AcOH). When only HNO  3  is present in the reaction environment, only F4_MIL&#8208;140A(Ce) is obtained. Heating preferentially accelerates nucleation, which becomes rate determining below 57 &#176;C. Upon addition of AcOH to the system, alongside HNO  3  , mixed&#8208;phased products are obtained. F4_UiO&#8208;66(Ce) is always formed faster and no interconversion between the two phases occurs. In the case of F4_UiO&#8208;66(Ce), crystal growth is always the rate determining step. A higher amount of HNO  3  favours the formation of F4_MIL&#8208;140A(Ce), whereas increasing the amount of AcOH favours the formation of F4_UiO&#8208;66(Ce). Based on the  in situ  results, a new optimised route to achieving a pure, high quality F4_MIL&#8208;140A(Ce) phase in mild conditions (60 &#176;C, 1 h) is also identified.</dc:description>

         <title>Natural and Synthetic Oligoarylamides &#8211; priviledged structures for medical applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract:  The term "privileged structure" refers to a single molecular substructure or scaffold that can serve as a starting point for high&#8208;affinity ligands for more than one receptor type. In this report we are adressing a hithertho overlooked group of privileged substructures, namely aromatic oligoamides, for which there are natural models in the form of cystobactamides, albicidin, distamycin A, netropsin and others.
&#160;
The aromatic and heteroaromatic core, together with a flexible selection of substituents, form conformationally well&#8208;defined scaffolds capable of specifically binding to conformationally well&#8208;defined regions of biomacromolecules such as helices in proteins or DNA often by acting as helices mimicks themselves. As such, these aromatic oligoamides have already been employed to inhibit protein&#8208;protein and nucleic acid&#8208;protein interactions. This article is the first to bring together the scattered knowledge about aromatic oligoamides in connection with biomedical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Transition Metal&#8208;Free N&#8208;Arylation of Amino Acid Esters with Diaryliodonium Salts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A transition metal&#8208;free approach for the N&#8208;arylation of amino acid derivatives has been developed. Key to this method is the use of unsymmetric diaryliodonium salts with anisyl ligands, which proved important to obtain high chemoselectivity and yields. The scope includes the transfer of both electron deficient, electron rich and sterically hindered aryl groups with a variety of different functional groups. Furthermore, a cyclic diaryliodonium salt was successfully employed in the arylation. The N&#8208;arylated products were obtained with retained enantiomeric excess.</dc:description>

         <title>Calix[4]pyrrolato Aluminates: The Effect of Ligand Modification on the Reactivity of Square&#8208;Planar Aluminum Anions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Structural constraint represents an attractive tool to modify  p  &#8208;block element properties without the need for unusual oxidation or valence states. The recently reported methyl&#8208;calix[4]pyrrolato aluminate established the effect of forcing a tetrahedral aluminum anion into a square&#8208;planar coordination mode. However, the generality of this structural motif and any consequence of ligand modification remained open. Herein, we launch a systematic ligand screening and broaden the class of square&#8208;planar aluminum anions by two derivatives that differ in the  meso  &#8208;substitution at the calix[4]pyrrolato ligand. Strikingly, this modification provokes opposing trends in the preference for a Lewis acidic binding mode with &#963;&#8208;donors  versus  the aluminum&#8208;ligand cooperative binding mode with carbonyls. Insights into the origin of these counterintuitive experimental observations are provided by computation and bond analysis. Importantly, this rationale might allow to exploit mode&#8208;selective binding for catalytic rate control.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrodechlorination of Dichloromethane by a Metal&#8208;Free Triazole&#8208;Porphyrin Electrocatalyst: Demonstration of Main&#8208;Group Element Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, the electrocatalytic reduction of dichloromethane (CH2Cl2  ) into hydrocarbons involving a main group element&#8208;based molecular triazole&#8208;porphyrin electrocatalyst  H2PorT8  is reported. This catalyst converted CH2Cl2  in acetonitrile to various hydrocarbons (methane, ethane, and ethylene) with a Faradaic efficiency of 70% and current density of &#8211;13 mA/cm2  at a potential of &#8211;2.2 V vs. Fc/Fc  +  using water as a proton source. The findings of this study and its mechanistic interpretations demonstrated that  H2PorT8  was an efficient and stable catalyst for the hydrodechlorination of CH2Cl2  and that main group catalysts could be potentially used for exploring new catalytic reaction mechanisms.</dc:description>

The findings of this study and its mechanistic interpretations demonstrated that  H2PorT8  was an efficient and stable catalyst for the hydrodechlorination of CH2Cl2  and that main group catalysts could be potentially used for exploring new catalytic reaction mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Luminescent PMMA Films and PMMA@SiO2 Nanoparticles with Embedded Ln3+ Complexes for Highly Sensitive Optical Thermometers in the Physiological Temperature Range</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Luminescent materials doped with Ln  3+  ions have attracted in recent years a large amount of attention for their applications as optical thermometers based both on down shifting and upconversion processes. This study presents research done on development of highly sensitive optical thermometers in the physiological temperature range based on PMMA (poly(methyl methacrylate)) films doped with two series of visible Ln  3+  complexes (Ln  3+  = Tb  3+  , Eu  3+  and Sm  3+  ) and silica (SiO  2  ) nanoparticles (NPs) coated with these PMMA films. The best performing PMMA films doped with Tb  3+  and Eu  3+  complexes, was the  PMMA[TbEuL  1  tppo]1  film (L  1  = 4,4,4&#8208;trifluoro&#8208;1&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;butadionate and tppo = triphenylphosphine oxide), which showed good temperature sensing S  r  = 4.21% K  &#8208;1  at 313 K, while for the PMMA films doped with Tb  3+  and Sm  3+  complexes, was the  PMMA[TbSmL  2  tppo]3  film (L  2  = 4,4,4&#8208;trifluoro&#8208;1&#8208;(4&#8208;chlorophenyl)&#8208;1,3&#8208;butadionate) showed S  r  = 3.64% K  &#8208;1  at 313 K. Additionally, SiO  2  nanoparticles coated with the best preforming films from each of the series of PMMA films (Tb&#8208;Eu and Tb&#8208;Sm) and their temperature sensing properties were studied in water showing excellent performance in the physiological temperature range (  PMMA[TbEuL  1  tppo]1@SiO  2  S  r  = 3.84% &#176;C at 20 &#176;C and  PMMA[TbSmL  2  tpp]3@SiO  2  S  r  = 3.27% &#176;C at 20 &#176;C) and the toxicity of these nanoparticles on human cells was studied showing that they are not toxic.</dc:description>

         <title>Reactions of Late First&#8208;Row Transition Metal (Fe&#8211;Zn) Dichlorides with a PGeP Pincer Germylene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reactivity of the PGeP germylene 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bis(di&#8208;isopropylphosphanylmethyl)&#8208;5,5&#8217;&#8208;dimethyldipyrromethane&#8208;1,1&#8217;&#8208;diylgermanium(II), Ge(pyrmPiPr2)2CMe2  , with late first raw transition metal (Fe&#8211;Zn) dichlorides has been investigated. All reactions led to PGeP pincer chloridogermyl complexes. The reactions with FeCl2  and CoCl2  afforded paramagnetic square planar complexes of formula [MCl{&#954;3P,Ge,P&#8208;GeCl(pyrmPiPr2)2CMe2}] (M = Fe, Co). While the iron complex maintains an intermediate spin state (S1; &#956;eff=3.0 &#956;B) over the temperature range 50&#8211;380 K, the cobalt complex presents a gradual spin crossover behavior (the magnetic moment varies linearly with temperature from 1.9 &#956;B  at 10 K to 3.6 &#956;B  at 380 K, the effective magnetic moment of the cobalt complex varies linearly with temperature from 1.9 &#956;B  at 10 K to 3.6 &#956;B  at 380 K, indicating a spin crossover behavior that involves  S1/2  (predominant at  T&lt;180 K) and  S3/2  (predominant at&#160;  T  &gt; 200 K). Both cobalt(II) species have been detected by EPR at  T&lt;20 K). The reaction of Ge(pyrmPiPr2)2CMe2  with [NiCl2(dme)] (dme = dimethoxyethane) gave a square planar nickel(II) complex, [NiCl{&#954;3P,Ge,P&#8208;GeCl(pyrmPiPr2)2CMe2}], whereas the reaction with CuCl2  involved a redox process that rendered a mixture of the germanium(IV) compound GeCl2(pyrmPiPr2)2CMe2  and a binuclear copper(I) complex, [Cu2{&#956;&#8208;&#954;3P,Ge,P&#8208;GeCl(pyrmPi  Pr2)2CMe2}2  ], whose metal atoms are in tetrahedral environments. The reaction of the germylene with ZnCl  2  led to the tetrahedral derivative [ZnCl{&#954;3P,Ge,P&#8208;GeCl(pyrmPiPr2)2CMe2  }].</dc:description>

         <title>Single point mutant inverts stereoselectivity of a carbonyl reductase toward &#946;&#8208;ketoesters with enhanced activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enzyme stereoselectivity control is still a major challenge. To gain insight into the molecular basis of enzyme stereo&#8208;recognition and expand the source of anti&#8208;Prelog carbonyl reductase toward  &#946;  &#8208;ketoesters, the rational design aiming at stereoselectivity inversion was performed. The designed variant Q139G switched the enzyme stereoselectivity toward  &#946;  &#8208;ketoesters from Prelog to anti&#8208;Prelog, providing corresponding alcohols in high enantiomeric purity (89.1%&#8208;99.1% ee). More importantly, the well&#8208;known trade&#8208;off between stereoselectivity and activity was not found. Q139G exhibited higher catalytic activity than the wildtype enzyme, the enhancement of the catalytic efficiency (  k  cat  /  K  m  ) varied from 1.1&#8208; to 27.1&#8208;fold. Interestingly, the mutant Q139G did not lead to reversed stereoselectivity toward aromatic ketones. Analysis of enzyme&#8208;substrate complexes showed that the structural flexibility of  &#946;  &#8208;ketoesters and a newly formed cave together facilitated the formation of the anti&#8208;Prelog&#8208;preferred conformation. In contrast, the relatively large and rigid structure of the aromatic ketones prevents them from forming the anti&#8208;Prelog&#8208;preferred conformation.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This work describes the synthesis and properties of a dicyanomethylene&#8208;susbtituted indolo[3,2&#8208;b]carbazole diradical  ICz&#8208;CN.This quinoidal system dimerises almost completely to (ICz&#8208;CN)2  containing two long C(sp3 )&#8208;C(sp  3) &#963;&#8208;bonds between the dicyanomethylene units . The minor open&#8208;shell ICz&#8208;CN component in the solid state mixture was identify with EPR spectroscopy. The cyclic voltammetric and UV&#8208;vis spectroelectrochemical data, and comparison with reference monomer  ICz&#8208;Br  reveal that the nature of the one&#8208;electron oxidation of (ICz&#8208;CN)2  at ambient temperature and  ICz&#8208;CN  at elevated temperature is very similar in all these compounds due to the prevailing localization of their HOMO on the  ICz  backbone. The involvement of the dicyanomethylene groups stabilizes the close&#8208;lying LUMO and LUMO+1 of (ICz&#8208;CN)  2  and especially  ICz&#8208;CN  compared to  ICz&#8208;Br  , resulting in the distinctive cathodic behaviour at low overpotentials. Differently from neutral  ICz&#8208;CN  , its radical anion and dianion are remarkably stable at ambient conditions. The UV&#8208;Vis(&#8208;NIR) electronic transitions in parent (  ICz&#8208;CN  )  2  and  ICz&#8208;CN  and their different redox forms have been assigned with the aid of TD&#8208;DFT calculations. The s&#8208;bond cleavage in neutral (  ICz&#8208;CN  )  2  is achieved in solution and in the solid&#8208;state upon soft external stimuli (time, temperature, pressure), showing a strong chromism from light yellow to blue&#8210;green. Notably, in solid state, the predominant formation of the monomeric diradical species is achieved under high hydrostatic pressure conditions (&gt;1 GPa).</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The silver&#8208;fluorine phase diagram has been scrutinized as a function of external pressure using theoretical methods. Our results indicate that two novel stoichiometries containing Ag  +  and Ag  2+  cations (Ag  3  F  4  and Ag  2  F  3  ) are thermodynamically stable at ambient and low pressure. Both are computed to be magnetic semiconductors at ambient pressure conditions. For Ag  2  F  5  , containing both Ag  2+  and Ag  3+  , we find that strong 1D antiferromagnetic coupling is retained throughout the pressure&#8208;induced phase transition sequence up to 65 GPa. Our calculations show that throughout the entire pressure range of their stability the mixed valence fluorides preserve a finite band gap at the Fermi level. We also confirm the possibility of synthesizing AgF  4  as a paramagnetic compound at high pressure. Our results indicate that this compound is metallic in its thermodynamic stability region. Finally, we present general considerations on the thermodynamic stability of mixed valence compounds of silver at high pressure.</dc:description>

         <title>Separation of xylene isomers in the anion&#8208;pillared square grid material SIFSIX&#8208;1&#8209;Cu</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Xylene isomer separation is considered one of the seven separation challenges that changed the world. In addition, the high&#8208;energy demand of xylene separation highlights the need for efficient novel adsorbents. Herein, the liquid&#8208;phase separation potential of the anion&#8208;pillared hybrid material SIFSIX&#8208;1&#8208;Cu was studied for preferential adsorption of o&#8208;xylene and m&#8208;xylene over p&#8208;xylene, which was inspired by a previous complexation crystallization method for separating m&#8208;xylene. We report detailed experimental liquid&#8208;phase adsorption experiments, yielding selectivities of 3.0 for o&#8208;xylene versus p&#8208;xylene and 2.6 for m&#8208;xylene versus p&#8208;xylene. Our theoretical calculations thus provide a reasonable explanation that the xylene adsorption selectivity is attributed to the C&#8208;H&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;F interaction, and the host&#8208;guest interaction order agrees with the adsorption priority: o&#8208;xylene &gt; m&#8208;xylene &gt; p&#8208;xylene.</dc:description>

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Difunctionalization of 1,3&#8208;Diene with Amine and Disilane under a Mild Re&#8208;oxidation System</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A highly regioselective and stereoselective difunctionalization reaction of 1,3&#8208;diene with amine and disilane to form C&#8208;N and C&#8208;Si bonds via a one&#8208;step Pd/Cu/O2 system is disclosed. The difunctionalization reaction affords allylic silanes, including the allylic amine moiety, in up to 92% yield in the absence of any acid, base, or external ligand. The developed synthetic methodology can be scaled to 100 g in high yield with high Z&#8208;selectivity, which demonstrates the feasibility of the reaction for industrial applications.</dc:description>
