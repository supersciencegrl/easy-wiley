         <title>Specific Lipid Studies in Complex Membranes by Solid&#8208;State NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Specific lipid interaction in complex membranes: Specific interactions with lipids are critical for proteins and drugs, however, direct structural measurements of interactions with lipids remain difficult, especially in membranes that mimic biological conditions. Here, a broadly applicable solid&#8208;state NMR approach is presented that enables to directly measure specific interactions with lipids such as cardiolipin in complex fluid membranes.







Abstract
Specific interactions with phospholipids are often critical for the function of proteins or drugs, but studying these interactions at high resolution remains difficult, especially in complex membranes that mimic biological conditions. In principle, molecular interactions with phospholipids could be directly probed by solid&#8208;state NMR (ssNMR). However, due to the challenge to detect specific lipids in mixed liposomes and limited spectral sensitivity, ssNMR studies of specific lipids in complex membranes are scarce. Here, by using purified biological 13C,15N&#8208;labeled phospholipids, we show that we can selectively detect traces of specific lipids in complex membranes. In combination with 1H&#8208;detected ssNMR, we show that our approach provides unprecedented high&#8208;resolution insights into the mechanisms of drugs that target specific lipids. This broadly applicable approach opens new opportunities for the molecular characterization of specific lipid interactions with proteins or drugs in complex fluid membranes.

         <dc:description>
Enabling semiconducting properties in N&#8208;acenoacenes. Reducing the steric demand of N&#8208;acenoacenes tunes the solid&#8208;state packings of N&#8208;acenoacenes in favor of &#960;&#8211;&#960;&#8208;stacking, allowing charge transfer through the crystal lattice. The first utilization of N&#8208;acenoacenes in p&#8208;type organic thin&#8208;film transistors is reported.







Abstract
Four N&#8208;acenoacenes were synthesized and analyzed for their optoelectronic properties and solid&#8208;state packings. Two of the regioisomeric acridinoacridines are TIPS&#8208;ethynylated, whereas the other pair are Boc&#8208; and triflate substituted derivatives. The two TIPS&#8208;ethynyldiazaacenoacenes were processed into organic thin&#8208;film transistors with saturation hole mobilities reaching 2.9&#215;10&#8722;2&#8197;cm2(Vs)&#8722;1.

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Electrochromic Behavior of Dibenzothiepin Derivatives Attached with Two Michler's Hydrol Blue Units</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dibenzothiepin&#8208;based redox pair and its analogues exhibit an electrochomic behavior with drastic change in the UV&#8208;Vis&#8208;NIR absorption, thus suitable for developing new bioimaging protocols. The structural change of the central seven&#8208;membered ring was found to be the key to gain electrochemical bistability upon two&#8208;electron transfer nearly at the same potential.







Abstract
10,11&#8208;Bis[bis(4&#8208;dimethylaminophenyl)methylene]dibenzo[bf]thiepin (1) and &#8208;oxepin (2) were prepared as stable yellow crystalline compounds, which are the cyclic analogues of electron&#8208;donating hexaarylbutadienes. Upon two&#8208;electron oxidation, they are reversibly transformed into the title dications (12+ and 22+) exhibiting near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorptions, which were also isolated as stable salts. These redox pairs can serve as new entries into less well&#8208;explored organic NIR&#8208;electrochromic systems, and the separation of redox peaks (electrochemical bistability) was attained for 1/12+ and 2/22+, thanks to drastic geometrical changes between neutral and dicationic states, as revealed by a series of X&#8208;ray analyses. Thiepin&#8208;S,S&#8208;dioxide analogue (3/32+) exhibits quite similar dynamic redox behavior due to nonaromatic nature of the dibenzothiepin and &#8208;oxepin unit in 12+ and 22+, whereas the thiepin&#8208;S&#8208;oxide derivative (4/42+) does not exhibit bistability due to the smaller change in geometry upon electron transfer, showing that a subtle change of a bridging atom in the central seven&#8208;membered ring can modify the redox properties.

         <title>Phomoxanthone A Targets ATP Synthase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new inhibitor of ATP synthase: Through photoaffinity labelling and chemoproteomics analysis it was discovered, and subsequently validated, that phomoxanthone A is an inhibitor of ATP synthase. This discovery may inspire the design of new inhibitors targeting the beta subunit of ATP synthase.







Abstract
Phomoxanthone A is a naturally occurring molecule and a powerful anti&#8208;cancer agent, although its mechanism of action is unknown. To facilitate the determination of its biological target(s), we used affinity&#8208;based labelling using a phomoxanthone A probe. Labelled proteins were pulled down, subjected to chemoproteomics analysis using LC&#8208;MS/MS and ATP synthase was identified as a likely target. Mitochondrial ATP synthase was validated in cultured cells lysates and in live intact cells. Our studies show sixty percent inhibition of ATP synthase by 260&#8197;&#956;M phomoxanthone&#8197;A.

         <title>Synthetic Studies towards the Calcium&#8208;Dependent Lipopeptide Antibiotic Cadaside B</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cadaside B is a novel calcium&#8208;dependent lipopeptide antibiotic, bearing multiple rare non&#8208;canonical amino acids and exhibiting potent antimicrobial activity towards multi&#8208;drug resistant Gram&#8208;positive pathogens. Synthetic studies towards cadaside B yielded a compound possessing the desired connectivity of macrocyclic scaffold, but poorly matching 1H NMR spectra and lack of bioactivity. Insights and challenges towards the total synthesis are presented.







Abstract
In the current global crisis of antimicrobial resistance, antimicrobial peptides represent a promising source of alternative antibiotics. Recently discovered cadaside B, a novel calcium&#8208;dependent antibiotic, exhibits potent antimicrobial activity towards Gram&#8208;positive pathogens including multi&#8208;drug resistant strains. These properties, coupled with a novel structure, non&#8208;cytotoxicity, and low likelihood of developing resistance render cadaside B an important synthetic target. Herein, a synthetic strategy towards cadaside B is reported with the key steps involving on&#8208;resin depsipeptide bond formation and solution&#8208;phase macrolactamization. Good agreement of the synthetic cadaside B MS/MS fragmentation pattern was observed with the natural product, but a different 1H NMR spectrum and absence of antimicrobial activity suggest an undetected epimerization event took place during the synthesis. Herein the findings of our synthetic journey and suggestions for future directions are presented.

Herein, a synthetic strategy towards cadaside B is reported with the key steps involving on-resin depsipeptide bond formation and solution-phase macrolactamization. Good agreement of the synthetic cadaside B MS/MS fragmentation pattern was observed with the natural product, but a different &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H NMR spectrum and absence of antimicrobial activity suggest an undetected epimerization event took place during the synthesis. Herein the findings of our synthetic journey and suggestions for future directions are presented.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unveiling the Potential of Innovative Gold(I) and Silver(I) Selenourea Complexes as Anticancer Agents Targeting TrxR and Cellular Redox Homeostasis</title>

Innovative Au(I) and Ag(I) NHC&#8208;based selenourea complexes exhibit a prominent anticancer effect by selectively targeting TrxR in human cancer cells, thus hampering cancer cell redox machinery and inducing apoptotic cell death.







Abstract
A series of NHC&#8208;based selenourea Ag(I) and Au(I) complexes were evaluated for their anticancer potential in&#8197;vitro, on 2D and 3D human cancer cell systems. All NHC&#8208;based selenourea complexes possess an outstanding cytotoxic potency, which was comparable or even better than that of the reference metallodrug auranofin, and were also able to overcome both platinum&#8208;based and multi&#8208;drug resistances. Intriguingly, their cytotoxic potency did not correlate with solution stability, partition coefficient or cellular uptake. On the other hand, mechanistic studies in cancer cells revealed their ability to strongly and selectively inhibit the redox&#8208;regulating enzyme Thioredoxin Reductase (TrxR), being even more effective than auranofin, a well&#8208;known TrxR inhibitor, without affecting other redox enzymes such as Glutathione Reductase (GR). The inhibition of TrxR in H157 human cancer cells caused, in turn, the disruption of cellular thiol&#8208;redox homeostasis and of mitochondria pathophysiology, ultimately leading to cancer cell death through apoptosis.

         <title>An Optimized Ni&#8208;catalyzed Chan&#8208;Lam Type Coupling: Enantioretentive Access to Chiral N&#8208;Aryl Sulfinamides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An optimized Ni&#8208;catalyzed Chan&#8208;Lam type coupling reaction was optimized. A series of chiral N&#8208;aryl sulfinamides was prepared with high chemical yield without any racemization. A plausible and novel mechanism was proposed and this method is useful for preparing various C&#8722;X bonds efficiently.







Abstract
C&#8722;N bond formation takes on a critical significance in reactions of organic synthesis, material production and pharmaceutical manufactory. Chan&#8208;Lam has proposed a useful methodology to furnish secondary arylamides under mild conditions. However, when chiral sulfinamides serve as the coupling precursors, the Cu&#8208;catalyzed coupling reaction is found with low efficacy. Complex side&#8208;products are generated under classic conditions. Moreover, it led to the racemization of the coupling product. In this study, an optimized Ni&#8208;catalyzed Chan&#8208;Lam type coupling conditions were proposed, which resulted in clean conversion from chiral sulfinamides and arylboronic acids to offer N&#8208;aryl sulfinamides efficiently and enantioretentively. The trans&#8208;N1,N2&#8208;dimethylcyclohexane&#8208;1,2&#8208;diamine was proven as the most efficient ligand. Under the optimized conditions, a series of chiral N&#8208;aryl sulfinamides was prepared with high chemical yield without racemization. Furthermore, a plausible and novel mechanism was proposed. Interestingly, the method could efficiently furnish a wide variety of C&#8722;X bonds by coupling arylboronic acids with different nucleophiles.

         <title>Electrophotochemical Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Decarboxylative Coupling of Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Convergent paired metal electrocatalysis enables the direct use of simple primary and secondary aliphatic acids as coupling partners for C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) bond formation by radical decarboxylation. This new electrophotocatalytic method features a broad substrate scope, wide functional&#8208;group tolerance, and could be used for late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex molecules.







Abstract
An electrophotochemical dual metal&#8208;catalyzed protocol for decarboxylative arylation of simple aliphatic carboxylic acids with aryl halides is reported. The relative stabilities of catalytically active metal complexes simultaneously generated at anode and cathode are the key design elements for the success of this convergent paired electrolysis. This new electrophotocatalytic method is mild, robust, and most importantly, capable of accommodating simple primary aliphatic acids including acetic acid &#8211; ubiquitous and variegated structural motifs yet remain oddly challenging substrates &#8211; directly as native functional groups for decarboxylative C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) bond formation.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pillararene&#8208;based supramolecular vesicles are self&#8208;assembled from the supra&#8208;amphiphiles, consisting of macrocyclic hosts pillararenes and amphiphilic guests linked together through noncovalent interactions, and are endowed with the stimuli&#8208;responsive controlled release performances for use in smart drug delivery. The background of the graphic matches the120th anniversary of Nanjing University (NJU).







Abstract
Supramolecular vesicles (SMVs) self&#8208;assembled from the supra&#8208;amphiphiles, consisting of two scaffolds linked together through noncovalent interactions, can realize stimuli&#8208;responsive controlled release of encapsulated drugs for enhanced therapeutic efficacy and minimized side effect of drugs. Pillararenes (PAs), an emerging kind of macrocyclic hosts in 2008, are easy to modify with a variety of functionalities. SMVs from PAs and specific guests mainly based on the host&#8211;guest interactions have attracted increasing attention because of their drug delivery and controlled drug release. A great progress in the construction and stimuli&#8208;responsive drug delivery of the PA&#8208;based SMVs has been made since the first work was reported in 2012. This review summarizes the major achievements of the PA&#8208;based SMVs for stimuli&#8208;responsive drug delivery over the past 5&#8197;years, including the microstructures of SMVs, multiple stimuli&#8208;responsive SMVs, prodrug SMVs from prodrug PAs and guests, bola&#8208;type SMVs, multifunctional SMVs, glucose&#8208;responsive SMVs for insulin delivery, novel SMVs from responsive PAs, thermo&#8208;responsive SMVs, and ternary SMVs, for chemotherapy, photothermal therapy, photodynamic therapy, and other biological applications. The future challenges and research directions of PA&#8208;based SMVs are also outlined from the points of views of the fundamental research, biological applications, and clinical applications of PA&#8208;based SMVs.

Abstract
A facile and environmentally friendly electrochemical protocol is herein reported for the C(sp2)&#8722;C(sp3) cross dehydrogenative coupling between imidazopyridines and N,N&#8208;dimethylanilines. The broad functional group compatibility includes halogens, ester, alcohol, sulfone as well as thiophene. This methodology is also suitable for benzo[d]imidazo[2,1&#8208;b]thiazole, thiazoimidazole and tetrahydroisoquinoline, and can be scaled up to 5&#8197;mmol. Mechanistic insights are discussed.

         <title>The Radical Anion, Dianion and Electron Transport Properties of Tetraiodotetraazapentacene</title>

Filling the gap in the series of halogenated azaacenes. Tetraiodotetraazapentacene I4TAP is prepared and characterized. Its stable radical anion and high mobilities in organic field&#8208;effect transistors make I4TAP a formidable n&#8208;type semiconductor.







Abstract
Tetraiodotetraazapentacene I4TAP, the last missing derivative in the series of halogenated silylated tetraazapentacenes, was synthesized via condensation chemistry from a TIPS&#8208;ethynylated diaminobenzothiadiazol in three steps. Single and double reduction furnished its air&#8208;stable monoanion and relatively air&#8208;stable dianion, both of which were characterized by crystallography. All three species are structurally and spectroscopically compared to non&#8208;halogenated TAP and Br4TAP. I4TAP is an n&#8208;channel material in thin&#8208;film transistors with average electron mobilities exceeding 1&#8197;cm2 (Vs)&#8722;1.

         <title>Computational Insights into the Catalytic Mechanism of Is&#8208;PETase: An Enzyme Capable of Degrading Poly(ethylene) Terephthalate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The enzyme is&#8208;PETase degrades poly(ethylene) terephthalate (PET) at mesophilic temperatures. This makes is&#8208;PETase a promising candidate for the biodegradation of this common pollutant. The energy profile for the degradation of a PET substrate mimic by is&#8208;PETase was calculated by using computational quantum&#8208;mechanical/molecular mechanical methods, and the activation energy for this reaction was calculated to be 34.1&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1.







Abstract
Is&#8208;PETase has become an enzyme of significant interest due to its ability to catalyse the degradation of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) at mesophilic temperatures. We performed hybrid quantum mechanics and molecular mechanics (QM/MM) at the DSD&#8208;PBEP86&#8208;D3/ma&#8208;def2&#8208;TZVP/CHARMM27//rev&#8208;PBE&#8208;D3/dev2&#8208;SVP/CHARMM level to calculate the energy profile for the degradation of a suitable PET model by this enzyme. Very low overall barriers are computed for serine protease&#8208;type hydrolysis steps (as low as 34.1&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1). Spontaneous deprotonation of the final product, terephthalic acid, with a high computed driving force indicates that product release could be rate limiting.

         <title>Single&#8208;Metal&#8208;Encapsulated Double&#8208;Cage [Pt@Sn17]4&#8722;: An Exception from Group 14 Endohedral Clusters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Asymmetrical fusion of two inhomogeneous building units [Pt@Sn9] and [Sn9] leads to the largest group&#8197;14 intermetalloid cluster [Pt@Sn17]4&#8722; encapsulating a single transition metal atom. The unusual double&#8208;cage structure could be seen as a result of the collapse of the capsule&#8208;like Sn17 framework when filled with only one Pt atom.







Abstract
Group&#8197;14 endohedral clusters containing a metal center inside usually possess a single cage topological structure, but here an unexpected single&#8208;metal&#8208;filled double&#8208;cage cluster, [Pt@Sn17]4&#8722; (1&#8201;a) is reported. It can be seen as a combination of the more extended Pt&#8208;filled [Pt@Sn9] cage and hollow [Sn9] cage sharing a central Sn atom, which is offset from the central position. This double&#8208;cage species represents the largest group&#8197;14 intermetalloid cluster encapsulating a single transition metal atom. DFT calculations show that the capsule&#8208;like architecture of [Sn17]4&#8722;, similar to that found in [Pt2@Sn17]4&#8722;, is unstable if filled with a single Pt atom and collapses to the title cluster 1&#8201;a upon geometry optimization. Deviation of the central Sn atom occurs due to the vibronic coupling as a consequence of pseudo&#8208;Jahn&#8208;Teller distortion leading to the bent Cs&#8208;symmetrical structure, in contrast to the more symmetrical D2d cage previously reported in [Ni2@Sn17]4&#8722;.

         <title>Phosphorescent Bimetallic C^C* Platinum(ii) Complexes with Bridging Substituted Diphenylformamidinates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis and characterization of bimetallic C^C* platinum(II) complexes with bridging diphenylformamidinates is presented alongside with two solid&#8208;state structures. The phosphorescent compounds show excellent emissive behavior with quantum yields of up to 90&#8201;% and lifetimes around 2&#8197;&#956;s. The substitution pattern in the bridging ligands influences next to the structural properties (intermetallic distance) also the photophysical characteristics. The observed effects are explained and supported by density functional theory calculations.







Abstract
A series of phosphorescent bimetallic platinum(II) complexes is presented, which were synthesized by the combination of bidentate cyclometalated N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene ligands and different bridging diphenylformamidinates. The complexes were characterized by standard techniques and additionally two solid&#8208;state structures could be obtained. Photoluminescence measurements revealed the strong emissive behavior of the compounds with quantum yields of up to 90&#8201;% and emission lifetimes of approx. 2&#8197;&#956;s. The effect of the substitution pattern in the bridging ligands on the structural and photophysical properties of the complexes was examined in detail and rationalized by density functional theory calculations (PBE0/6&#8208;311G*).

What can you give? Reactivity studies of the L(Cl)Ge&#8901;BH3 complex were performed to determine the effect of GeII&#8594;B donation. An unprecedented GeII&#8594;Ga complex L(Cl)Ge&#8901;GaCl3 was isolated. The different strength of the GeII&#8594;E (E=B, Ga) donation was evaluated by using energy decomposition analysis (EDA) and proton affinity.







Abstract
Reactivity studies of the GeII&#8594;B complex L(Cl)Ge&#8901;BH3 (1; L=2&#8208;Et2NCH2&#8208;4,6&#8208;tBu2&#8208;C6H2) were performed to determine the effect on the GeII&#8594;B donation. N&#8208;coordinated compounds L(OtBu)Ge&#8901;BH3 (2) and [LGe&#8901;BH3]2 (3) were prepared. The possible tuning of the GeII&#8594;B interaction was proved experimentally, yielding compounds 1&#8208;PPh2&#8208;8&#8208;(LGe)&#8208;C10H6 (4) and L(Cl)Ge&#8901;GaCl3 (5) without a GeII&#8594;B interaction. In 5, an unprecedented GeII&#8594;Ga coordination was revealed. The experimental results were complemented by a theoretical study focusing on the bonding in 1&#8722;5. The different strength of the GeII&#8594;E (E=B, Ga) donation was evaluated by using energy decomposition analysis. The basicity of different L(X)Ge groups through proton affinity is also assessed.

Reactivity studies of the L(Cl)Ge&#8901;BH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; complex were performed to determine the effect of Ge&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;&#8594;B donation. An unprecedented Ge&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;&#8594;Ga complex L(Cl)Ge&#8901;GaCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; was isolated.

&lt;p&gt;Reactivity studies of the Ge&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;&#8594;B complex L(Cl)Ge&#8901;BH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;; L=2-Et&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-4,6-&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;Bu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) were performed to determine the effect on the Ge&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;&#8594;B donation. N-coordinated compounds L(O&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;Bu)Ge&#8901;BH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;) and [LGe&#8901;BH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;) were prepared. The possible tuning of the Ge&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;&#8594;B interaction was proved experimentally, yielding compounds 1-PPh&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-8-(LGe)-C&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;) and L(Cl)Ge&#8901;GaCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt;) without a Ge&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;&#8594;B interaction. In &lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt;, an unprecedented Ge&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;&#8594;Ga coordination was revealed. The experimental results were complemented by a theoretical study focusing on the bonding in &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;&#8722;&lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt;. The different strength of the Ge&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;&#8594;E (E=B, Ga) donation was evaluated by using energy decomposition analysis. The basicity of different L(X)Ge groups through proton affinity is also assessed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Inducing Propeller Chirality in Triaryl Boranes with Chiral Amines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A three&#8208;point interaction between a chiral amine and a triarylborane is shown to suffice to induce a preferential propeller handedness to the borane. Rotation of aryl blades can be avoided by incorporation of naphthyl instead of phenyl and a bulky amine component.







Abstract
Stabilization of chiral propeller conformations in triaryl compounds is challenging due to generally low racemization barriers. Nonetheless, it was recently found that chiral conformational preferences can be induced to triaryl boranes by incorporating point&#8208;chiral alkylether chains to the aryl blades and subsequently locking the structure with ammonia. A four&#8208;point interaction, meaning that the cooperative effects of Lewis&#8208;adduct formation and three hydrogen bonds, was proposed as stabilizing mechanism. Herein, it was shown that three such strong interactions suffice to introduce a preferential propeller handedness. Although DFT calculations predict no noteworthy preferences for either P&#8208; or M&#8208;chiral propellers for some of the investigated triarylborane&#8211;amine adducts that were prepared with chiral primary amines, vibrational circular dichroism (VCD) spectroscopic characterizations revealed that there is indeed a measurable excess of one propeller handedness. Furthermore, the steric demand of the amine was found to play a key role in the induction process and especially in preventing blade rotations.

         <title>Controlled Modification of Axial Coordination for Transition&#8208;Metal Single&#8208;Atom Electrocatalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 59, October 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
As a novel coordination method, axial coordination engineering can be used to regulate the active site of catalysts by using various ligands with chalcogen&#8208;, halogen&#8208;, and nitrogen&#8208;containing functional groups. Herein, we summarize the latest advances in the experimental and computational efforts aimed at tuning the axial coordination of SACs, and also present perspectives for the further study of axially coordinated SACs.







Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) have emerged as a new frontier in areas such as electrocatalysis, photocatalysis, and enzymatic catalysis. Aided by recent advances in the synthetic methodologies of nanomaterials, atomic characterization technologies, and theoretical calculation modeling, various SACs have been prepared for a variety of catalytic reactions. To meet the requirements of SACs with distinctive performance and appreciable selectivity, much research has been carried out to adjust the coordination configuration and electronic properties of SACs. This concept summarizes the latest advances in the experimental and computational efforts aimed at tuning the axial coordination of SACs. Series of atoms, functional groups or even macrocycles are oriented into the atomic metal center, and how this affects the electrocatalytic performance is also reviewed. Finally, this concept presents perspectives for the further precise design, preparation and in&#8208;situ detection of axially coordinated SACs.

         <title>One Fluorophore&#8208;Two Sensing Films: Hydrogen&#8208;Bond Directed Formation of a Quadruple Perylene Bisimide Stack</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 59, October 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique &#8220;one fluorophore&#8208;two sensing films&#8221; is realized based on a typically designed perylene bisimide dimer, HDPP&#8208;PBI, which shows strong tendency to form quadruple PBI aggregate via dimerization in suitable solvents owing to synergistic effect between intramolecular hydrogen bond formation and intermolecular &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking. Transition from fluorescence silent HDPP&#8208;PBI dimer to fluorescence bright monomer is realized via addition of CF3COOH.







Abstract
Elaborately designed &#960;&#8208;stacked molecular aggregates are significant for modulation of photophysical properties of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Herein, a double hydrogen&#8208;bonds trussed di(pyridyl)pyrrole&#8208;perylene bisimide (HDPP&#8208;PBI) was designed and its dimerization behavior was studied. HDPP&#8208;PBI tends to form a quadruple PBI stack with a dimerization constant of &#8764;5.56&#215;106&#8197;M&#8722;1. The dimerization was ascribed to synergistic intramolecular double hydrogen&#8208;bonds formation and intermolecular &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking. Addition of CF3COOH, a hydrogen bond blocker, promotes the dimer to monomer transition. Accordingly, two distinct fluorescent films were prepared by drop&#8208;casting of the dimerized or the monomeric HDPP&#8208;PBI onto a substrate surface. Interestingly, the less&#8208;emissive PBI quadruple stack&#8208;based film showed a turn on response to acetone vapor, while the highly emissive HDPP&#8208;PBI&#8208;based film exhibited fluorescence quenching upon exposure to triethylamine vapor. We believe that the discovered synergistic effect in the PBI aggregates would enlighten the design of new PAHs aggregates with defined structures.

         <title>Biocatalytic Intramolecular C&#8722;H aminations via Engineered Heme Proteins: Full Reaction Pathways and Axial Ligand Effects</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 59, October 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work provides the complete reaction pathway and axial ligand effect for heme protein catalyzed intramolecular C&#8722;H aminations. Results reproduced experimentally found rate&#8208;determining step and axial ligand trend and revealed the electronic driving force information to understand them. New ideas for biocatalyst design in this field were offered.







Abstract
Engineered heme protein biocatalysts provide an efficient and sustainable approach to develop amine&#8208;containing compounds through C&#8722;H amination. A quantum chemical study to reveal the complete heme catalyzed intramolecular C&#8722;H amination pathway and protein axial ligand effect was reported, using reactions of an experimentally used arylsulfonylazide with hemes containing L=none, SH&#8722;, MeO&#8722;, and MeOH to simulate no axial ligand, negatively charged Cys and Ser ligands, and a neutral ligand for comparison. Nitrene formation was found as the overall rate&#8208;determining step (RDS) and the catalyst with Ser ligand has the best reactivity, consistent with experimental reports. Both RDS and non&#8208;RDS (nitrene transfer) transition states follow the barrier trend of MeO&#8722;&lt;SH&#8722;&lt;MeOH&lt;None due to the charge donation capability of the axial ligand to influence the key charge transfer process as the electronic driving forces. Results also provide new ideas for future biocatalyst design with enhanced reactivities.

         <title>Enhancing the Peroxygenase Activity of a Cofactor&#8208;Independent Peroxyzyme by Directed Evolution Enabling Gram&#8208;Scale Epoxide Synthesis</title>

Directed evolution of the cofactor&#8208;independent peroxyzyme 4&#8208;OT yielded an efficient biocatalyst (fused 4&#8208;OT P8a) for the enantioselective epoxidation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes using hydrogen peroxide as an oxidant. The optimized peroxyzyme enabled the milligram&#8208; and gram&#8208;scale preparation of the desired &#945;,&#946;&#8208;epoxy&#8208;aldehydes with excellent conversions and outstanding enantiopurity, providing an attractive route towards the synthesis of valuable intermediates for the production of pharmaceuticals.







Abstract
Peroxygenases selectively incorporate oxygen into organic molecules making use of the environmentally friendly oxidant H2O2 with water being the sole by&#8208;product. These biocatalysts can provide &#8216;green&#8217; routes for the synthesis of enantioenriched epoxides, which are fundamental intermediates in the production of pharmaceuticals. The peroxyzyme 4&#8208;oxalocrotonate tautomerase (4&#8208;OT), catalysing the epoxidation of a variety of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes with H2O2, is outstanding because of its independence from any cost&#8208;intensive cofactor. However, its low&#8208;level peroxygenase activity and the decrease in the enantiomeric excess of the corresponding &#945;,&#946;&#8208;epoxy&#8208;aldehydes under preparative&#8208;scale conditions is limiting the potential of 4&#8208;OT. Herein we report the directed evolution of a tandem&#8208;fused 4&#8208;OT variant, which showed an &#8764;150&#8208;fold enhanced peroxygenase activity compared to 4&#8208;OT wild type, enabling the synthesis of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;epoxy&#8208;aldehydes in milligram&#8208; and gram&#8208;scale with high enantiopurity (up to 98&#8201;% ee) and excellent conversions. This engineered cofactor&#8208;independent peroxyzyme can provide new opportunities for the eco&#8208;friendly and practical synthesis of enantioenriched epoxides at large scale.

         <title>A Chemically Fuelled Molecular Automaton Displaying Programmed Migration of Zn2+ Between Alternative Binding Sites</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 59, October 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Programmed autonomous migration of cations between alternative binding sites of a peptidomimetic ligand is driven by a fuelled change in acidity of the system. The rate of migration, and delays or resets in the execution of the program, may be controlled by the operating conditions of the molecular automaton.







Abstract
A molecular system comprising a cationic zinc complex and an amino acid&#8208;derived ambident ligand having phosphate and carboxylate binding sites undergoes a series of rearrangements in which the metal cation migrates autonomously from one site to another. The location of the metal is identified by the circular dichroism spectrum of a ligated bis(2&#8208;quinolylmethyl)&#8208;(2&#8208;pyridylmethyl)amine (BQPA) chromophore, which takes a characteristic shape at each binding site. Migration is fuelled by the decomposition of trichloroacetic acid to CO2 and CHCl3, which progressively neutralises the acidity of the system as a function of time, revealing in sequence binding sites of increasing basicity. The migration rate responds to control by variation of the temperature, water content and triethylamine concentration, while an excess of fuel controls the duration of an induction period before the migration event.

         <title>Structure of Zinc and Nickel Histidine Complexes in Solution Revealed by Molecular Dynamics and Raman Optical Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 59, October 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Raman optical activity (ROA) is rarely applied to metals because of the complexity of the spectra. However, herein, it was possible to analyze model zinc and nickel compounds and determine prevalent trends in the structure. Correct interpretation of the spectra opens a way to application of this kind of spectroscopy to biologically relevant systems in the natural aqueous environment.







Abstract
The histidine residue has an exceptional affinity for metals, but solution structure of its complexes are difficult to study. For zinc and nickel complexes, Raman and Raman optical activity (ROA) spectroscopy methods to investigate the link between spectral shapes and the geometry were used. The spectra were recorded and interpreted on the basis of ionic equilibria, molecular dynamics, ab initio molecular dynamics, and density functional theory. For zwitterionic histidine the dominant tautomer was determined by the decomposition of experimental spectra into calculated subspectra. An octahedral structure was found to prevail for the ZnHis2 complex in solution, in contrast to a tetrahedral arrangement in the crystal phase. The solution geometry of NiHis2 is more similar to the octahedral structure found by X&#8208;ray. The Raman and ROA structural determinations of metal complexes are dependent on extensive computations, but reveal unique information about the studied systems.

         <title>Nanoarchitectonics in the Ionothermal Synthesis for Nucleation of Crystalline Potassium Poly (heptazine imide) Towards an Enhanced Solar&#8208;Driven H2O2 Production</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 59, October 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Addition of NH4Cl in the eutectic salt mixture of KCl/LiCl can regulate the polymerization process and generate a potassium poly(heptazine imide) framework with favorable features, such as increased surface area, strengthened reduction power, improved exciton dissociation and charge migration properties, which contribute to a significantly boosted catalytic performance in photo&#8208;production of hydrogen peroxide from selective oxygen reduction.







Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven selective oxygen reduction reaction on polymeric carbon nitride framework is one of the most promising approaches toward sustainable H2O2 production. Potassium poly(heptazine imide) (PHI), with regular metal sites in the framework and favorable crystalline structure, is highly active for photocatalytic selective 2e oxygen reduction to produce H2O2. By introducing NH4Cl into the eutectic KCl&#8208;LiCl salt mixture, the PHI framework exhibits a remarkable performance for photocatalytic production of H2O2, for example, a record high H2O2 photo&#8208;production rate of 29.5&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8197;mg&#8722;1. The efficient photocatalytic performance is attributed to the favorable properties of the new PHI framework, such as improved porosity, negatively shifted LUMO position, enhanced exciton dissociation and charges migration properties. A mechanistic investigation by quenching and electron spin resonance technique reveals the critical role of superoxide radicals for the formation singlet oxygen, and the singlet oxygen is one of the critical intermediates towards the formation of the H2O2 by proton extraction from the ethanol.

         <title>Multistep Continuous Flow Synthesis of Isolable NH2&#8208;Sulfinamidines via Nucleophilic Addition to Transient Sulfurdiimide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 59, October 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Primary sulfinamidines, the aza&#8208;analogues of sulfinamides, are neglected S(IV) compounds. We report here the first synthesis of isolable NH2&#8208;sulfinamidines through a multistep continuous flow approach via addition of organometallics to a transient sulfurdiimide. The transformation is highly chemoselective and compatible with a variety of in&#8197;situ generated organolithiums. Further manipulation of the products gives access to unexplored S(IV) aza&#8208;analogues of pharmaceutically relevant targets.







Abstract
The growing interest in novel sulfur pharmacophores led to recent advances in the synthesis of some S(IV) and S(VI) motifs. However, preparation and isolation of uncommon primary sulfinamidines, the aza&#8208;analogues of sulfinamides, is highly desirable. Here we report a multistep continuous flow synthesis of poorly explored NH2&#8208;sulfinamidines by nucleophilic attack of organometallic reagents to in&#8197;situ prepared N&#8208;(trimethylsilyl)&#8208;N&#8208;trityl&#8208;&#955;4&#8208;sulfanediimine (Tr&#8722;N=S=N&#8722;TMS). The transformation can additionally be realized under mild conditions, at room temperature, via a highly chemoselective halogen&#8208;lithium exchange of aryl bromides and iodides with n&#8208;butyllithium.

     alt="Multistep Continuous Flow Synthesis of Isolable NH2-Sulfinamidines via Nucleophilic Addition to Transient Sulfurdiimide"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Primary sulfinamidines&lt;/b&gt;, the aza-analogues of sulfinamides, are neglected S(IV) compounds. We report here the first synthesis of isolable NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-sulfinamidines through a multistep continuous flow approach via addition of organometallics to a transient sulfurdiimide. The transformation is highly chemoselective and compatible with a variety of in&#8197;situ generated organolithiums. Further manipulation of the products gives access to unexplored S(IV) aza-analogues of pharmaceutically relevant targets.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The growing interest in novel sulfur pharmacophores led to recent advances in the synthesis of some S(IV) and S(VI) motifs. However, preparation and isolation of uncommon primary sulfinamidines, the aza-analogues of sulfinamides, is highly desirable. Here we report a multistep continuous flow synthesis of poorly explored NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-sulfinamidines by nucleophilic attack of organometallic reagents to in&#8197;situ prepared &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-(trimethylsilyl)-&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-trityl-&#955;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;-sulfanediimine (Tr&#8722;N=S=N&#8722;TMS). The transformation can additionally be realized under mild conditions, at room temperature, via a highly chemoselective halogen-lithium exchange of aryl bromides and iodides with &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-butyllithium. Moreover, the synthetic potential of the methodology was assessed by exploring further manipulations of the products and accessing novel S(IV) analogues of celecoxib, tasisulam, and relevant sulfinimidoylureas.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>SMM Behaviour of the Butterfly {CrIII2DyIII2} Pivalate Complex and Magneto&#8208;structurally Correlated Relaxation Thermal Barrier</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 59, October 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a new pivalate butterfly {CrIII2LnIII2} system with magnetization tunneling relaxation suppresion and hysteresis opening up to 3.6&#8197;K in the Ln=Dy complex, due to Cr&#8722;Dy exchange interaction. We have found a magneto&#8208;structural correlation between the Orbach thermal barrier for magentization reversal and the mean Cr&#8722;Dy bond lenght across all literature reported butterfly {CrIII2DyIII2} complexes.







Abstract
We are reporting the synthesis, single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structure characterization, and magnetic property investigations of the pivalate butterfly {CrIII2LnIII2} complexes with Ln= Gd and Dy and the isostructural Y(III) sample. We found an anti&#8208;ferromagnetic Cr(III)&#8208;Ln(III) exchange interaction, which, as previously observed in related Cr(III)/Ln(III) systems, plays a key role in suppressing quantum tunnelling of magnetization and enhances the SMM performance in the Dy(III) complex. In fact, a pure Orbach relaxation mechanism, with absence of QT regime, is observed with a thermal barrier of 50&#8197;cm&#8722;1, leading to magnetization hysteresis opening, measured with a commercial magnetometer, up to 3.6&#8197;K with a coercive field of 2.9&#8197;T. Analysis of SMM behaviour in literature&#8208;known butterfly {CrIII2DyIII2} complexes, reveals the existence of a magneto&#8208;structural correlation between Ueff, the thermal barrier size, and the mean Cr&#8722;Dy bond distances. Moreover, a clear correlation is found for the thermal barrier magnitude and the maximum temperature hysteresis opening and coercive field.

         <title>Macroscopic Polarization Change of Mononuclear Valence Tautomeric Cobalt Complexes Through the Use of Enantiopure Ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 59, October 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
To realize polarization change in non&#8208;ferroelectric crystals, valence tautomeric (VT) complexes with polar crystal structure were synthesized based on our strategy, i.&#8201;e. introduction of enantiopure ligand into the metal complexes exhibiting intramolecular electron transfer. The VT transition is accompanied by the change in molecular dipole moment. Because the net polarization of the polar crystal never cancels out, polarization switching was realized.







Abstract
The crystallization of a complex having electron transfer properties in a polar space group can induce the polarization switching of a crystal in a specific direction, which is attractive for the development of sensors, memory devices, and capacitors. Unfortunately, the probability of crystallization in a polar space group is usually low. Noticing that enantiopure compounds crystallize in Sohncke space groups, this paper reports a strategy for the molecular design of non&#8208;ferroelectric polarization switching crystals based on the use of intramolecular electron transfer and chirality. In addition, this paper describes the synthesis of a mononuclear valence tautomeric (VT) cobalt complex bearing an enantiopure ligand. The introduction of enantiomer enables the crystallization of the complex in the polar space group (P21). The polarization of the crystals along the b&#8208;axis direction is not canceled out and the VT transition is accompanied by a change in the macroscopic polarization of the polar crystal. Polarization switching via electron transfer is realized at around room temperature.

         <title>Multiply Twisted Chiral Macrocycles Clamped by Tethered Binaphthyls Exhibiting High Circularly Polarized Luminescence Brightness</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 59, October 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral macrocycles with multiple twisted structures have been synthesized as emissive chiroptical dyes by anchoring tethered chiral binaphthyls. The rigid molecular structure exhibits a high gCPL and quantum yield, leading to a high CPL brightness (BCPL).







Abstract
Chiral macrocyclic dimers, trimers, and tetramers composed of paraphenylene and tethered binaphthyl were synthesized, and their molecular structures and chiroptical properties were investigated. X&#8208;ray analysis and theoretical calculations revealed that multiple twisted molecular structures &#8211; dimers, trimers, and tetramers &#8211; adopt figure&#8208;of&#8208;eight, M&#246;bius triangle, and concave rectangle structures, respectively. These homologues have large &#1013; values in their UV&#8208;vis absorption spectra because of the &#960;&#8208;conjugation of the naphthalene&#8208;phenylene&#8208;naphthalene frameworks. Owing to the shape&#8208;persistent ring structure and tethering with &#8722;OCH2CH2O&#8722;, high fluorescence quantum yields and a relatively high dissymmetry factor gCPL in circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) spectra were achieved. This results in CPL brightness (BCPL) of over 100, which is greater than that of the conventional organic CPL dye.

         <title>Well&#8208;Defined Ni(0) and Ni(II) Complexes of Bicyclic (Alkyl)(Amino)Carbene (MeBICAAC): Catalytic Activity and Mechanistic Insights in Negishi Cross&#8208;Coupling Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 59, October 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A wide range of aryl halides were coupled with phenylzinc bromides in Negishi cross&#8208;coupling reaction catalyzed by MeBICAAC&#8208;nickel complexes. The active species are deciphered by means of UV&#8208;vis, HRMS and NMR measurements and support the involvement of Ni(I)/Ni(III) species in the reaction promoted by [(MeBICAAC)2NiIICl2] pre&#8208;catalyst whereas, Ni(0)/Ni(II) cycle operates when the Ni(0) complex, [(MeBICAAC)2Ni0] was used as pre&#8208;catalyst.







Abstract
Negishi cross&#8208;coupling reaction of organozinc compounds as nucleophiles with aryl halides has drawn immense focus for C&#8722;C bond formation reactions. In comparison to the well&#8208;established library of Pd complexes, the C&#8722;C cross&#8208;coupling of this particular approach is largely primitive with nickel&#8208;complexes. Herein, we describe the syntheses of Ni(II) complexes, [(MeBICAAC)2NiX2] (X=Cl (1), Br (2), and I (3)) by employing the bicyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene (MeBICAAC) ligand. The reduction of complexes 1&#8211;3 using KC8 afforded the two coordinate low valent, Ni(0) complex, [(MeBICAAC)2Ni(0)] (4). Complexes 1&#8211;4 have been characterized by spectroscopic techniques and their solid&#8208;state structures were also confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallography. Furthermore, complexes 1&#8211;4 have been applied in a direct and convenient method to catalyze the Negishi cross&#8208;coupling reaction of various aryl halides with 2,6&#8208;difluorophenylzinc bromide or phenylzinc bromide as the coupling partner in the presence of 3&#8197;mol&#8201;% catalyst. Comparatively, among all&#8208;pristine complexes, 1 exhibit high catalytic potential to afford value&#8208;added C&#8722;C coupled products without the use of any additive. The UV&#8208;vis studies and HRMS measurements of controlled stochiometric reactions vindicate the involvement of Ni(I)&#8722;NI(III) cycle featured with a penta&#8208;coordinated Ni(III)&#8208;aryl species as the key intermediate for 1 whereas Ni(0)/Ni(II) species are potentially involved in the catalytic cycle of 4.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Negishi cross-coupling reaction of organozinc compounds as nucleophiles with aryl halides has drawn immense focus for C&#8722;C bond formation reactions. In comparison to the well-established library of Pd complexes, the C&#8722;C cross-coupling of this particular approach is largely primitive with nickel-complexes. Herein, we describe the syntheses of Ni(II) complexes, [(&lt;sup&gt;Me&lt;/sup&gt;BICAAC)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NiX&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] (X=Cl (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;), Br (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;), and I (&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;)) by employing the bicyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene (&lt;sup&gt;Me&lt;/sup&gt;BICAAC) ligand. The reduction of complexes &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; using KC&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; afforded the two coordinate low valent, Ni(0) complex, [(&lt;sup&gt;Me&lt;/sup&gt;BICAAC)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ni(0)] (&lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;). Complexes &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt; have been characterized by spectroscopic techniques and their solid-state structures were also confirmed by X-ray crystallography. Furthermore, complexes &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt; have been applied in a direct and convenient method to catalyze the Negishi cross-coupling reaction of various aryl halides with 2,6-difluorophenylzinc bromide or phenylzinc bromide as the coupling partner in the presence of 3&#8197;mol&#8201;% catalyst. Comparatively, among all-pristine complexes, &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; exhibit high catalytic potential to afford value-added C&#8722;C coupled products without the use of any additive. The UV-vis studies and HRMS measurements of controlled stochiometric reactions vindicate the involvement of Ni(I)&#8722;NI(III) cycle featured with a penta-coordinated Ni(III)-aryl species as the key intermediate for &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; whereas Ni(0)/Ni(II) species are potentially involved in the catalytic cycle of &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Construction of Photo&#8208;Responsive Pd2L4&#8208;Type Nanocages based on Feringa's Second&#8208;Generation Motor and Its Guest Binding Ability for C60</title>

         <dc:description>
A novel banana&#8208;shaped and bis&#8208;monodentate ligand based on Feringa's second&#8208;generation molecular motor was designed and synthesized. Subsequently, a M2L4&#8208;type metal&#8208;organic nanocage featuring four endohedral motor motifs was constructed by reacting stoichiometric motor ligand with Pd2+. This motorized nanocage showed good guest encapsulation ability towards C60, offering prospects as a prototype of &#8220;motor factory&#8221; to achieve the motor's non&#8208;equilibrium functions.







Abstract
We present the construction of a M2L4&#8208;type metal&#8208;organic nanocage featuring four endohedral Feringa's motor motifs and its adaptive encapsulation towards a C60 guest molecule. The structure of the cage, though complicated on the 1H NMR spectrum due to the adoption of mixed ligands, was unambiguously characterized with a combination of ESI&#8208;MS, 2D DOSY, 13C NMR and particularly the SAXS technique. The molecular motor within the cage demonstrated similar photophysical properties to the uncoordinated one, indicating the motor's function was not compromised when it was anchored in such a confined nanospace. Furthermore, the nanocage showed good guest encapsulation ability towards C60, and a guest induced&#8208;fit behavior of the cage was revealed based on the extensive SAXS analysis and molecular dynamics simulation. The adaptive motorized nanocage reported here represents one of the very few examples of integrating individual motors into a discrete nanoconfined system and offers prospects to achieve its non&#8208;equilibrium functions.

Abstract
pKa values in non&#8208;aqueous solvents are of critical importance in many areas of chemistry. Our knowledge is, despite their relevance, still limited to the most fundamental properties and few pKa values in the most common solvents. Taking advantage of a recently introduced computationally efficient procedure we computed the pKa values of 182 compounds in 21 solvents. This data set is used to establish for the first time universal trends between all solvents. Our computations indicate, that the total charge of the molecule and the charge of the acidic group combined with the Kamlet&#8208;Taft solvatochromic parameters are sufficient to predict pKa values with at least semi&#8208; quantitative accuracy. We find, that neutral acids such as alcohols are strongly affected by the solvent properties. This is contrasted by cationic acids like ammonium ions whose pKa is often almost completely independent from the choice of solvent.

         <title>Shedding Light on the Enigmatic TcO2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;xH2O Structure with Density Functional Theory and EXAFS Spectroscopy
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 59, October 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
What shape are you in? The structure of amorphous TcO2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;xH2O has been determined from DFT calculations and EXAFS measurements. Contrary to the generally accepted model, TcO2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;xH2O forms zigzag chains of cis&#8208;Tc(&#956;&#8208;O)4(H2O)2 units. A slow aging process results in increasing polymerization that might eventually lead to a new TcO2 polymorph. Formation of these phases with low solubility is highly relevant for the confinement of long&#8208;lived 99Tc in deep nuclear waste repositories.







Abstract
The &#946;&#8208;emitting 99Tc isotope is a high&#8208;yield fission product in 235U and 239Pu nuclear reactors, raising special concern in nuclear waste management due to its long half&#8208;life and the high mobility of pertechnetate (TcO4&#8722;). Under the conditions of deep nuclear waste repositories, Tc is retained through biotic and abiotic reduction of TcO4&#8722; to compounds like amorphous TcO2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;xH2O precipitates. It is generally accepted that these precipitates have linear (Tc(&#956;&#8208;O)2(H2O)2)n chains, with trans H2O. Although corresponding Tc&#8722;Tc and Tc&#8722;O distances have been obtained from extended X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy, this structure is largely based on analogy with other compounds. Here, we combine density&#8208;functional theory with EXAFS measurements of fresh and aged samples to show that, instead, TcO2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;xH2O forms zigzag chains that undergo a slow aging process whereby they combine to form longer chains and, later, a tridimensional structure that might lead to a new TcO2 polymorph.

         <title>Hydrogen Peroxide&#8208;Responsive Triggers Based on Borinic Acids: Molecular Insights into the Control of Oxidative Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 59, October 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The regioselectivity of H2O2&#8208;triggered oxidation of unsymmetrical diarylborinic acids was assessed. Introducing a CF3 directing group at the ortho&#8208;position relative to the boron atom exclusively provides a unique oxidative rearrangement. This was applied to the synthesis of prototypic fluorogenic probes allowing the complete release of the effector and maintaining superior reactivity compared to boronic acids.







Abstract
Arylborinic acids represent new, efficient, and underexplored hydrogen peroxide&#8208;responsive triggers. In contrast to boronic acids, two concomitant oxidative rearrangements are involved in the complete oxidation of these species, which might represent a major limitation for an efficient effector (drug or fluorophore) release. Herein, a comprehensive study of H2O2&#8208;mediated unsymmetrical arylborinic acid oxidation to investigate the factors that could selectively guide their oxidative rearrangement is described. The o&#8208;CF3 substituent was found to be an excellent directing group allowing a complete regioselectivity on borinic acid models. This result was successfully applied to synthesizing new borinic acid&#8208;based fluorogenic probes, which exclusively release the fluorescent moiety upon H2O2 treatment. These compounds maintained their superior kinetic properties compared to boronic acids, thus further enhancing the potential of arylborinic acids as valuable new H2O2&#8208;sensitive triggers.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The regioselectivity&lt;/b&gt; of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-triggered oxidation of unsymmetrical diarylborinic acids was assessed. Introducing a CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; directing group at the &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-position relative to the boron atom exclusively provides a unique oxidative rearrangement. This was applied to the synthesis of prototypic fluorogenic probes allowing the complete release of the effector and maintaining superior reactivity compared to boronic acids.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arylborinic acids represent new, efficient, and underexplored hydrogen peroxide-responsive triggers. In contrast to boronic acids, two concomitant oxidative rearrangements are involved in the complete oxidation of these species, which might represent a major limitation for an efficient effector (drug or fluorophore) release. Herein, a comprehensive study of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-mediated unsymmetrical arylborinic acid oxidation to investigate the factors that could selectively guide their oxidative rearrangement is described. The &lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; substituent was found to be an excellent directing group allowing a complete regioselectivity on borinic acid models. This result was successfully applied to synthesizing new borinic acid-based fluorogenic probes, which exclusively release the fluorescent moiety upon H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; treatment. These compounds maintained their superior kinetic properties compared to boronic acids, thus further enhancing the potential of arylborinic acids as valuable new H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-sensitive triggers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Boolean MOF Logic: A switchable metal&#8211;organic framework performs AND logic operation using hydrogen and oxygen gas streams as binary inputs.







Abstract
We present an autonomous, chemical logic gate based on a switchable metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) composite, containing carbon nanoparticles and a Pt catalyst. The switchable MOF composite performs as AND logic gate. Hydrogen and oxygen gas streams serve as binary inputs. Catalytically formed water induces a structural transition (crystal volume expansion) of the MOF, and as a consequence, a detectable drop in conductance of the composite as a &#8216;true&#8217; output only if both gases come in contact with the composite.

         <title>The Importance of Mg2+&#8208;Free State in Nucleotide Exchange of Oncogenic K&#8208;Ras Mutants</title>

Systematic structural and dynamic analysis of wildtype K&#8208;Ras and its selected oncogenic mutations (G12C, G12D, and G12V) provides insight into mutation&#8208; and nucleotide&#8208;specific differences aiding the development of allosteric inhibitors targeting K&#8208;Ras signalling, in particular, the K&#8208;Ras&#8208;Sos interaction.







Abstract
For efficient targeting of oncogenic K&#8208;Ras interaction sites, a mechanistic picture of the Ras&#8208;cycle is necessary. Herein, we used NMR relaxation techniques and molecular dynamics simulations to decipher the role of slow dynamics in wild&#8208;type and three oncogenic P&#8208;loop mutants of K&#8208;Ras. Our measurements reveal a dominant two&#8208;state conformational exchange on the ms timescale in both GDP&#8208; and GTP&#8208;bound K&#8208;Ras. The identified low&#8208;populated higher energy state in GDP&#8208;loaded K&#8208;Ras has a conformation reminiscent of a nucleotide&#8208;bound/Mg2+&#8208;free state characterized by shortened &#946;2/&#946;3&#8208;strands and a partially released switch&#8208;I region preparing K&#8208;Ras for the interaction with the incoming nucleotide exchange factor and subsequent reactivation. By providing insight into mutation&#8208;specific differences in K&#8208;Ras structural dynamics, our systematic analysis improves our understanding of prolonged K&#8208;Ras signaling and may aid the development of allosteric inhibitors targeting nucleotide exchange in K&#8208;Ras.

Polynuclear niobium(V)&#8208;based carboxylate oxo clusters: A series of aryl monocarboxylate ligands was used to isolate molecular coordination complexes corresponding to dinuclear {Nb2O}, tetranuclear {Nb4O4}, or octanuclear {Nb8O12} niobium(V)&#8208;centered poly&#8208;oxo clusters related to different hydrolysis rates.







Abstract
The reactivity of aryl monocarboxylic acids (benzoic, 1&#8208; or 2&#8208;naphtoic, 4&#8217;&#8208;methylbiphenyl&#8208;4&#8208;carboxylic, and anthracene&#8208;9&#8208;carboxylic acids) as complexing agents for the ethoxide niobium(V) (Nb(OEt)5 precursor has been investigated. A total of eight coordination complexes were isolated with distinct niobium(V) nuclearities as well as carboxylate complexation states. The use of benzoic acid gives a tetranuclear core Nb4(&#956;2&#8208;O)4(L)4(OEt)8] (L=benzoate (1)) with four Nb&#8722;(&#956;2&#8208;O)&#8722;Nb linkages in a square plane configuration. A similar tetramer, 7, was obtained with 2&#8208;naphtoic acid by using a 55&#8201;% humid atmosphere synthetic route. Two types of dinuclear brick were identified with one central Nb&#8722;(&#956;2&#8208;O)&#8722;Nb linkage; they differ in their complexation state, with one bridging carboxylate ([Nb2(&#956;2&#8208;O)(&#956;2&#8208;OEt)(L)(OEt)6], with L=1&#8208;naphtoate (3) or anthracene&#8208;9&#8208;carboxylate (5)) or two bridging carboxylate groups ([Nb2(&#956;2&#8208;O)(L)2(OEt)6], with L=4&#8217;&#8208;methylbiphenyl&#8208;4&#8208;carboxylic (4) or anthracene&#8208;9&#8208;carboxylate (6)). An octanuclear moiety [Nb8(&#956;2&#8208;O)12(L)8(&#951;1&#8208;L)4&#8722;x(OEt)4+x] (with L=2&#8208;naphtoate, x=0 or 2; 8) was obtained by using a solvothermal route in acetonitrile; it has a cubic configuration with niobium centers at each node, linked by 12&#8197;&#956;2&#8208;O groups. The formation of the niobium oxo clusters was characterized by infrared and liquid 1H NMR spectroscopy in order to analyze the esterification reaction, which induces the release of water molecules that further react through oxolation with niobium atoms, in different {Nb2O}, {Nb4O4} and {Nb8O12} nuclearities.

The non&#8208;petroleum synthesis route of ethanol from syngas (H2+CO) with methyl acetate (MA) as the core intermediate product has been confirmed as an excellent industrialization route for high purity ethanol production. However, as the central part of this tandem&#8208;catalysis path, the carbonylation of dimethyl ether (DME) to MA is limited by the undesirable catalytic activity and stability of zeolite catalysts. Herein, a facile inhibitor&#8208;assisted strategy was developed for constructing self&#8208;assembled nano&#8208;Mordenite (nano&#8208;MOR) zeolites without using any expensive or complex template. A nano&#8208;filamentous MOR zeolite with only 70&#8197;nm crystal diameter was successfully synthesized by selectively controlling the crystal growth orientation with a specific inhibitor. The catalytic performance of self&#8208;assembled nano&#8208;MOR catalysts was remarkably outstanding in DME carbonylation reaction. The highest Space&#8208;Time Yield (STY) of MA was achieved over Nanofilament MOR (NF&#8208;MOR), which was significantly improved comparing with that of the traditional Ellipsoid&#8208;MOR (ES&#8208;MOR) [3780&#8197;mmol/(kg&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h) vs. 1368&#8197;mmol/(kg&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h)]. One&#8208;step ethanol synthesis was realized by combining the MOR catalyst and an innovative self&#8208;reduced Cu&#8208;ZnO/SiO2 (CZ/SiO2) catalyst in a rationally designed dual&#8208;bed catalysis system. Adopting the tailor&#8208;made NF&#8208;MOR&amp;CZ/SiO2 combination, it obtained the highest STY of ethanol, about 4 times of the conventional ES&#8208;MOR&amp;CZ combination [1800&#8197;mmol/(kg&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h) vs. 476&#8197;mmol/(kg&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h)]. The present self&#8208;assembled nano&#8208;MOR zeolites synthetic strategy opens a new way for the fabrication of high&#8208;performance zeolites for practical industrial applications in catalytic conversions of one&#8208;carbon (C1) small molecules to high value&#8208;added chemicals.

Radioactive Tc in deep nuclear waste repositories can be immobilized by reduction of the highly soluble TcO4&#8722; anion by agents like magnetite (Fe3O4) and H2, which create an amorphous TcO2&#8901;x&#8201;H2O precipitate. EXAFS measurements combined with DFT calculations reveal that the precipitate is an inorganic polymer formed of zigzag TcO2&#8901;2&#8201;H2O chains and give evidence of an increasing polymerization over time. More information can be found in the Research Article by A.&#8197;F. Oliveira, A.&#8197;C. Scheinost, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202202235).

         <title>Frontispiece: Controlled Modification of Axial Coordination for Transition&#8208;Metal Single&#8208;Atom Electrocatalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 59, October 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
M&#8722;N&#8722;C single&#8208;atom catalysts have emerged as a novel frontier in electrocatalysis. Their catalytic behavior is optimized by the lack of metal&#8211;metal bonds and ability to adjust the coordination configuration and electronic structure of their metal&#8211;heteroatom bonds. In particular, this concept discusses the importance of the axial coordination strategy toward single atom catalyst. For more details, see the Concept by B. Wang and co&#8208;workers. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202201471).

Three kinds of chiral cyclic compounds and their mirror&#8208;image isomers are described. The cover was created by using a &#8220;kaleidoscope&#8221; motif to project the three pairs of enantiomers in the central hexagon. The kaleidoscope is an optical device invented in the 19th century as a result of experiments on polarized light; the word &#8220;kaleidoscope&#8221;, derived from the Greek kalos &#8220;beautiful&#8221;, was used to represent the beautiful and circularly polarized luminescent (CPL) molecules.

The organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskite ferroelastics have got attention due to the superiority of structural adjustment, easy processing, and mechanical flexibility. Recent developments in organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskite ferroelastics and their crystal structures, phase transitions, and related properties with different dimensions (0D&#8211;3D) are discussed. An outlook on the possible challenges for obtaining hybrid perovskite ferroelastics is also presented.







Abstract
Molecular ferroelastics have received particular attention for potential applications in mechanical switches, shape memory, energy conversion, information processing, and solar cells, by taking advantages of their low&#8208;cost, light&#8208;weight, easy preparation, and mechanical flexibility. The unique structures of organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskites have been considered to be a design platform for symmetry&#8208;breaking&#8208;associated order&#8211;disorder in lattice, thereby possessing great potential for ferroelastic phase transition. Herein, we review the research progress of organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskite ferroelastics in recent years, focusing on the crystal structures, dimensions, phase transitions and ferroelastic properties. In view of the few reports on molecular&#8208;based hybrid ferroelastics, we look forward to the structural design strategies of molecular ferroelastic materials, as well as the opportunities and challenges faced by molecular&#8208;based hybrid ferroelastic materials in the future. This review will have positive guiding significance for the synthesis and future exploration of organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid molecular ferroelastics.

         <title>Organophotocatalytic [2+2] Cycloaddition of Electron&#8208;Deficient Styrenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A visible light organophotocatalytic [2+2] cycloaddition of electron&#8208;deficient styrenes is described. Photocatalytic [2+2] cycloadditions are typically performed with electron&#8208;rich styrene derivatives or &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated alkenes, and with transition&#8208;metal&#8208;based catalysts. We have discovered that an organic cyanoarene photocatalyst is able to deliver high&#8208;value cyclobutane products bearing electron&#8208;deficient aryl substituents in good yields. A range of electron&#8208;deficient substituents are tolerated and both homodimerizations and intramolecular [2+2] cycloadditions to fused bicyclic systems are available using this methodology.</dc:description>

         <title>Experimentally Calibrated Computational Prediction Enables Accurate Fine&#8208;Tuning of Near&#8208;Infrared Rhodamines for Multiplexing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A significant barrier inhibiting multiplexed imaging in the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) is the extensive trial and error associated with fine&#8208;tuning NIR dyes. In particular, the need to synthesize and experimentally evaluate dye derivatives in order to empirically identify those that can be used in multiplexing applications, requires a large investment of time. While coarse&#8208;tuning efforts benefit from computational prediction that can be used to identify target dye structures for synthetic campaigns, errors in computational prediction remain too large to accurately parse modifications aimed at fine&#8208;tuning changes in dye absorbance and emission. To address this issue, we screened different levels of theory and identified a time&#8208;dependent density functional theory (TD&#8208;DFT) approach that can rapidly, as opposed to synthesis and experimental evaluation, estimate absorbance and emission. By calibrating these computational estimations of absorbance and emission to experimentally determined parameters for a panel of existing NIR dyes, we obtain calibration curves that can be used to accurately predict the effect of fine&#8208;tuning modifications in new dyes. We demonstrate the predictive power of this calibrated dataset using seven previously unreported dyes, obtaining mean percent errors in absorbance and emission of 2.2 and 2.8%, respectively. This approach provides a significant timesavings, relative to synthesis and evaluation of dye derivatives, and can be used to focus synthetic campaigns on the most promising dye structures. The new dyes described herein can be utilized for multiplexed imaging, and the experimentally calibrated dataset will provide the dye chemistry community with a means to rapidly identify fine&#8208;tuned NIR dyes in silico to guide subsequent synthetic campaigns.</dc:description>

         <title>Finding a Deep&#8208;UV Borate BaZnB4O8 with Edge&#8208;sharing [BO4] Tetrahedra and Strong Optical Anisotropy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The polarization modulation of deep&#8208;UV light is an important process that incorporates functionality to selectively respond to light&#8208;mater interaction. Typically, optical anisotropy is foremost to the use efficiency of deep&#8208;UV birefringent crystals. Herein, a new congruently melting polyborate with extremely large birefringence (&#916;  n  (001)  = 0.14@589.3 nm) and band gap (6.89 eV) is discovered as a high performance birefringent crystal, which breaks the current deadlock of deep&#8208;UV polyborates that usually show small birefringence. The rigid tetrahedra, including [ZnO  4  ] and edge&#8208;sharing [BO  4  ] tetrahedra, make all the planar [BO  3  ] triangles in the lattice adopt preferential arrangement and thereby lead to an extraordinary large birefringence that is larger than all the deep&#8208;UV borates with experimentally measured values. Structural analyses with the additional theoretical calculations were used to study the origin of strong optical anisotropy in BaZnB  4  O  8  .</dc:description>

         <title>Dioxygen Splitting by a Tantalum(V) Complex Ligated by a Rigid, Redox Non&#8208;innocent Pincer Ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reaction of TaMe3Cl2 with a rigid acridane&#8208;derived trisamine H3NNN yields the tantalum(V) complex [TaCl2(NNNcat)]. Subsequent reaction with dioxygen results in the full four&#8208;electron reduction of O2 yielding the oxo&#8208;bridged bimetallic complex [{TaCl2(NNNsq)}2O]. This dinuclear complex exhibits an open&#8208;shell ground state due to partial ligand oxidation and was comprehensively characterized by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, LIFDI mass spectrometry, NMR, EPR, IR and UV/VIS/NIR spectroscopy. The mechanism of O2 activation was investigated by DFT calculations revealing initial binding of O2 to the tantalum(V) center followed by complete O2 scission to produce a terminal oxo&#8208;complex.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogen Bonded Foldamers with Axial Chirality: Chiroptical Properties and Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Folding phenomenon refers to the formation of specific conformation widely featured by the intramolecular interactions, which widely exists in biomacromolecules, and are closely related to their structures and functions. A variety of oligomeric folded molecules have been designed and synthesized, namely "foldamer", exhibiting potentials in the pharmaceutical and catalysis. Molecular folding is a promising strategy to transfer chirality from substituents to the whole skeleton, when the chirality transfer, amplification, evolution and other behaviors could be achieved. Investigating chirality using foldamer model deepens the understanding of structure&#8208;function correlation in biomacromolecules, and expands the molecular toolbox towards chiroptical and asymmetrical chemistry. Substitutes with abundant hydrogen bonding sites conjugated to a rotatable aryl group afford parallel &#946;&#8208;sheet&#8208;like conformation, which enables the emergence and manipulation of axial chirality.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Folding phenomenon refers to the formation of specific conformation widely featured by the intramolecular interactions, which widely exists in biomacromolecules, and are closely related to their structures and functions. A variety of oligomeric folded molecules have been designed and synthesized, namely "foldamer", exhibiting potentials in the pharmaceutical and catalysis. Molecular folding is a promising strategy to transfer chirality from substituents to the whole skeleton, when the chirality transfer, amplification, evolution and other behaviors could be achieved. Investigating chirality using foldamer model deepens the understanding of structure-function correlation in biomacromolecules, and expands the molecular toolbox towards chiroptical and asymmetrical chemistry. Substitutes with abundant hydrogen bonding sites conjugated to a rotatable aryl group afford parallel &#946;-sheet-like conformation, which enables the emergence and manipulation of axial chirality. In this concept, we aim to give a brief introduction and summary of the hydrogen bonded foldamers with anchored axial chirality, by taking some recent cases as examples. The design principles, control over axial chirality and applications are also reviewed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Optical Manipulation of Gb3 Enriched Lipid Domains: Impact of Isomerization on Gb3&#8208;Shiga Toxin B Interaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The plasma membrane is a complex assembly of proteins and lipids that can self&#8208;assemble in submicroscopic domains commonly termed &#8220;lipid rafts&#8221;, which are implicated in membrane signaling and trafficking. Recently, photo&#8208;sensitive lipids were introduced to study membrane domain organization, and photo&#8208;isomerization was shown to trigger the mixing and de&#8208;mixing of liquid&#8208;ordered (lo) domains in artificial phase&#8208;separated membranes.
Here, we synthesized globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) glycosphingolipids that harbor an azobenzene moiety at different positions of the fatty acid to investigate light&#8208;induced membrane domain reorganization, and that serve as specific receptors for the protein Shiga toxin (STx). Using phase&#8208;separated supported lipid bilayers on mica surfaces doped with four different photo&#8208;Gb3 molecules, we found by fluorescence microscopy and atomic force microscopy that liquid disordered (ld) domains were formed within lo domains upon trans&#8208;cis photo&#8208;isomerization. The fraction and size of these ld domains were largest for Gb3 molecules with the azobenzene group at the end of the fatty acid. We further investigated the impact of domain reorganization on the interaction of the B&#8208;subunits of STx with the photo&#8208;Gb3. Fluorescence and atomic force micrographs clearly demonstrated that STxB binds to the lo phase if Gb3 is in the trans&#8208;configuration, whereas two STxB populations are formed if the photo&#8208;Gb3 is switched to the cis&#8208;configuration highlighting the idea of manipulating lipid&#8208;protein interactions with a light stimulus.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Sterically Encumbered Thiourea S&#8208;Oxides through Direct Thiourea Oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Thiourea  S  &#8208;oxides can be viewed as formal analogs of the currently unknown diamino&#8208;substituted Criegee intermediates (urea  O  &#8208;oxides). However, the preparation of such  S  &#8208;oxides is rather challenging and the direct oxidation of thioureas typically only leads to formation of desulfurized products. Employing the accurate revDSD&#8208;PBEP86&#8208;D4 double hybrid density functional, we find that the peracid mediated oxidation of thiourea  S  &#8208;oxides exhibits a lower reaction barrier than the oxidation of the corresponding thiourea itself in contrast to most other ordinary thioketones. The undesired overoxidation reactivity, which is associated with strong &#960;&#8208;donation from the thiourea&#8217;s nitrogen atoms, can be partially suppressed by introduction of bulky substituents and the utilization of protic solvents. In this regard, we managed to prepare two sterically encumbered thiourea  S  &#8208;oxides in isolated yields of 35&#8722;40%. The  S  &#8208;oxides are stable in the solid state and in alcoholic solutions at room temperature for extended periods of time, but swiftly decompose in aprotic solvents by disproportionation. A dimesityl&#8208;substituted thiourea  S  &#8208;oxide complexed with residual  m  CBA could be characterized by means of X&#8208;ray crystallography, confirming the importance of hydrogen bonding in the stabilization of the amino&#8208;substituted C=S  +  &#8722;O  &#8722;  moiety.</dc:description>

         <title>Boosting Ring Strain and Lewis Acidity of Borirane: Synthesis, Reactivity and Density Functional Theory Studies of an Uncoordinated Arylborirane Fused to o&#8208;Carborane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Among the parent borirane, benzoborirene and orthodicarbadodecaborane&#8208;fused borirane, the latter possesses the highest ring strain and the highest Lewis acidity according to our density functional theory (DFT) studies. The synthesis of this class of compounds is thus considerably challenging. The existing examples require either a strong &#960;&#8208;donating group or an extra ligand for B&#8208;coordination, which nevertheless suppresses or completely turns off the Lewis acidity. The title compound, which possesses both features, not only allows the 1,2&#8208;insertion of P=O, C=O or C&#8801;N to proceed under milder conditions, but also enables the heretofore unknown dearomative 1,4&#8208;insertion of Ar&#8208;(C=O)&#8208; into a B&#8211;C bond.&#160;The fusion of strained molecular systems to an o&#8208;carborane cage shows great promise for boosting both the ring strain and acidity.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Cation&#8208;tuning engineering has become a new frontier in altering the electronic structure of electrocatalysts, which has been employed to enhance their electrochemical performance. Significant efforts have been made to promote the electrochemical performance of transition metal&#8208;based materials during oxygen electrocatalysis and related energy devices such as Zn&#8208;air batteries. Herein, the advantages of cation&#8208;tuning engineering, including cation vacancies/defects and cation doping, in the modification of the electronic structure of transition metal oxide catalysts are discussed. Additionally, practical applications of the cation&#8208;tuning engineering strategy are reviewed in detail with a special emphasis on oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction. Lastly, challenges and future opportunities in this field are proposed.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We describe an iron&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric oxidative C&#8211;C coupling of diarylamines which proceeds at room temperature with air as final oxidant. Using hexadecafluorophthalocyanine&#8211;iron(II) as catalyst in the presence of catalytic amounts of an axially chiral biarylphosphoric acid, the resulting chiral 2,2&#697;&#8208;diamino&#8208;1,1&#697;&#8208;biaryls are obtained in up to 90% ee as confirmed by chiral HPLC. A detailed mechanism has been proposed with a radical cation&#8211;chiral phosphate ion pair as key intermediate leading to the observed asymmetric induction.</dc:description>

         <title>The Insertion of E(II) and E(IV) Chlorides (E = Si, Ge) into the Si&#8211;Si Bond of Disilylene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reactions of silicon and germanium dichlorides L&#183;ECl2 (E = Si, L = IPr; E = Ge, L = dioxane) with the phosphino&#173;amidinato&#8208;supported disilylene ({&#954;2(N,P)&#8208;NNP}Si)2 resulted in formal tetrylene insertions into the Si&#8211;Si bond. In the case of the reaction with silylene, two products were isolated. The first, kinetic product ({&#954;2(N,P)&#8208;NNP}Si)2SiCl2, is the formal product of direct SiCl2 insertion into the Si&#8211;Si bond of ({&#954;2(N,P)&#8208;NNP}Si)2 and thus features two separated silylamido silylene centers. Over time, migration of the SiCl2 group to a lateral position afforded the second, thermodynamic product, the disilylene {&#954;2(Si,P)&#8208;SiCl2NNP}Si&#8211;Si{&#954;2(N,P)&#8208;NNP}. In contrast, insertion of GeCl2 resulted only in the isolation of the germanium analogue of {&#954;2(Si,P)&#8208;SiCl2NNP}Si&#8211;Si{&#954;2(N,P)&#8208;NNP}, containing a Ge atom in the central position namely, compound {&#954;2(Si,P)&#8208;SiCl2NNP}Ge&#8211;Si{&#954;2(N,P)&#8208;NNP}, which is a rare example of a silylene&#8208;germylene. Finally, reaction of disilylene ({&#954;2(N,P)&#8208;NNP}Si)2 with SiCl4 and SiHCl3 led to the formation of the new bis(silyl)silylene, ({NNP}SiCl2)2Si:. All four new products from these insertion reactions have been characterized by multinuclear NMR and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies.</dc:description>

         <title>DOTP versus DOTA as Ligands for Lanthanide Cations: Novel Structurally Characterized CeIV and CeIII Cyclen&#8208;Based Complexes and Clusters in Aqueous Solutions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A group of researchers from NRCN, Ben Gurion University and the CEA show that cyclen&#8208;derived, hard&#8208;bonding ligands facilitate the formation of tetravalent cerium cations bearing oxo/hydroxo clusters in aqueous solutions. The clusters eventually decompose to form the thermodynamically favoured &#8220;in&#8208;cage&#8221; cerric macrocyclic complex. More information can be found in the Research Article by S. Pevzner, E. Maimon, Y. Ben&#8208;Eliyahu, P. Moisy, A. Bettelheim, I. Zilbermann and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202201868).

         <title>Enantiodivergent Chemoenzymatic Dynamic Kinetic Resolution: Conversion of Racemic Propargyl Alcohols into Both Enantiomers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method for enantiodivergent production of S and R propargylic alcohols from their racemates by using commercial lipase&#8208;based dynamic kinetic resolution achieves quantitative conversion of the racemates into optically pure substances. The right and left hands, wearing jeweled rings indicating individual reaction steps, lead to opposite enantioselection, producing S and R alcohols, respectively. The order of the jewels is key to the enantioswitch. More information can be found in the Research Article by S. Akai and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202202437).

Aroyl&#8208;S,N&#8208;ketene acetals put a novel, promising class of dyes on the stage of AIEgens. Like a puppet on a string, all their photophysical properties like AIE and solid&#8208;state emission properties, the starting point of aggregation and, as shown by Hirshfeld analysis, the solid&#8208;state quantum yield can easily be fine&#8208;tuned and completely controlled by the choice and interplay of substituents at the aroyl&#8208;S,N&#8208;ketene acetal.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Directed Atroposelective C&#8211;H Iodination to Synthesize Axial Chiral Biaryl N&#8208;oxides via Enantioselective&#160;Desymmetrization Strategy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The discovery of&#160;enantioselective desymmetrization reactions to provide practical synthesis of enantioenriched atropisomeric biaryls is a challenging topic in the field of asymmetric catalysis. Herein, we reported a highly enantioselective desymmetrization reaction for the synthesis of axially chiral biaryl N&#8208;oxides by atroposelective C&#8208;H iodination using Pd (II) coordinated by N&#8208;benzoyl&#8208;L&#8208;phenylalanine as a chiral catalyst at room temperature. A broad range of products were obtained in high yields (up to 99%) with excellent enantioselectivities (up to 98% ee). The products could be synthesized in gram scale, one of which was proved to be a powerful organocatalyst in asymmetric allylation reaction. Mechanistic evidence as well as DFT calculations point towards the factors that lead to high reactivity and excellent enantiocontrol in this reaction.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Research advance in biomedical applications is inseparable from the development of biofunctional materials. Due to unique sequence programmability and various biological activities, DNA is a promising biological macromolecule for the precise construction of biofunctional materials. This review aims to provide an overview of the assembly of ultralong single&#8208;stranded DNA that is produced by rolling circle amplification into biofunctional materials in recent years. The first part illustrates how to construct cross&#8208;linked DNA hydrogel, during which the key point lays on overcoming electrostatic repulsion and steric hindrance between ultralong DNA through improving assembly force and increasing assembly sites. The second part focuses on how to construct DNA nanocomplex, during which the key point is achieving the structure stability and function integration between different components through rationally designed DNA sequences.</dc:description>

         <title>Terminal Au&#8211;N and Au&#8211;O Units in Organometallic Frames</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Since gold is located well beyond the oxo wall, chemical species with terminal Au&#8211;N and Au&#8211;O units are extremely rare and limited to low coordination numbers. We report here that these unusual units can be trapped within a suitable organometallic frame. Thus, the terminal auronitrene and auroxyl derivatives, [(CF&#8323;)&#8323;AuN]&#8315; and [(CF&#8323;)&#8323;AuO]&#8315; were identified as local minima by calculation. These open&#8208;shell, high&#8208;energy ions were experimentally detected by tandem mass spectrometry (MS&#178;): They respectively arise by N&#8322; or NO&#8322; dissociation from the corresponding precursor species [(CF&#8323;)&#8323;Au(N&#8323;)]&#8315; and [(CF&#8323;)&#8323;Au(ONO&#8322;)]&#8315; in the gas phase. Together with the known fluoride derivative [(CF&#8323;)&#8323;AuF]&#8315; , they form an interesting series of isoleptic and alloelectronic complexes of the highly acidic organogold(III) moiety (CF&#8323;)&#8323;Au with singly charged anions X&#8315; of the most electronegative elements (X = F, O, N). Ligand&#8208;field inversion in all these [(CF&#8323;)&#8323;AuX]&#8315; species results in the localization of unpaired electrons at the N and O atoms.</dc:description>

         <title>Lysosomal Targeting of &#946;&#8208;Cyclodextrin</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#946;&#8208;Cyclodextrin (&#946;&#8208;CD) and derivatives are approved therapeutics in &gt;30 clinical settings. &#946;&#8208;CDs have also shown promise as therapeutics for treatment of some lysosomal storage disorders, such as Niemann&#8208;Pick disease type C, and other disease states which involve metabolite accumulation in the lysosome. In these cases, &#946;&#8208;CD activity relies on transport to the lysosome, wherein it can bind hydrophobic substrate and effect extraction. The post&#8208;translational attachment of N&#8208;glycans terminated in mannose&#8208;6&#8208;phosphate (M6P) residues is the predominant method by which lysosomal enzymes are targeted to the lysosome. In this work we covalently attach a synthetic biantennary bis&#8208;M6P&#8208;terminated N&#8208;glycan to &#946;&#8208;CD and study the effect of the added glycans in a mammalian cell line. The formation of a host guest complex with a Cy5 fluorophore allows study of both cellular internalisation and transport to the lysosome by fluorescence microscopy. Results indicate that the rates of both internalisation and lysosomal transport are increased by the attachment of M6P&#8208;glycans to &#946;&#8208;CD, indicating that M6P&#8208;glycan conjugation may improve the therapeutic effectiveness of &#946;&#8208;CD for the treatment of disorders involving hydrophobic metabolite accumulation in the lysosome.</dc:description>

         <title>Integrated Reversible Thermochromism, High Tc, Dielectric Switch and Narrow Band Gap in One Multifunctional Ferroic</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rarely reported multi&#8208;functional ferroelastic shows a high phase transition temperature of 427.7&#8197;K. The coexistence of ferroelastic, narrow band gap, thermochromic, and dielectric properties makes it potentially promising for use in multifunctional smart devices such as nature&#8208;bionic, energy conversion, signal storage and encryption, and switching.







Abstract
Organic&#8208;inorganic Hybrid (OIH) materials for multifunctional switchable applications have attracted enormous attention in recent years due to their excellent optoelectronic properties and good structural tunability. However, it still remains challenging to fabricate one simple OIH compound with multi&#8208;functionals properties, such as dielectric switching, thermochromic properties, semiconductor characteristics and ferroelasticity. Under this context, we successfully synthesized [2&#8208;(2&#8208;fluorophenyl)ethan&#8208;1&#8208; ammonium]2SnBr6 (compound 1), which has a higher phase transition temperature of 427.7&#8197;K. Additionally, it exhibits a semiconducting property with an indirect band gap of 2.36&#8197;eV. Combining ferroelastic, narrow band gap, thermochromic, and dielectric properties, compound 1 can be considered as a rarely reported multi&#8208;functional ferroelastic material, which is expected to give inspiration for broadening the applications in the smart devices field.

         <title>Mechanistic Aspects on [3+2] Cycloaddition (32CA) Reactions of Azides to Nitroolefins: A Computational and Kinetic Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A detailed mechanistic study of [3+2] cycloadditions between nitroolefins and azides is described. Combining DFT calculations, kinetic studies, and activation strain analysis, our studies shed new mechanistic insight on the factors controlling reactivity and regioselectivity in this transformation and highlight the role of non&#8208;statistical effects in organocatalyzed and metal&#8208;free dipolar cycloadditions.







Abstract
[3+2] cycloadditions of nitroolefins have emerged as a selective and catalyst&#8208;free alternative for the synthesis of 1,2,3&#8208;triazoles from azides. We describe mechanistic studies into the cycloaddition/rearomatization reaction sequence. DFT calculations revealed a rate&#8208;limiting cycloaddition step proceeding via an asynchronous TS with high kinetic selectivity for the 1,5&#8208;triazole. Kinetic studies reveal a second&#8208;order rate law, and 13C kinetic isotopic effects at natural abundance were measured with a significant normal effect at the conjugated olefinic centers of 1.0158 and 1.0216 at the &#945; and &#946;&#8208;carbons of &#946;&#8208;nitrostyrene. Distortion/interaction&#8208;activation strain and energy decomposition analyses revealed that the major regioisomeric pathway benefits from an earlier and less&#8208;distorted TS, while intermolecular interaction terms dominate the preference for 1,5&#8208; over 1,4&#8208;cycloadducts. In addition, the major regioisomer also has more favorable electrostatic and dispersion terms. Additionally, while static DFT calculations suggest a concerted but highly asynchronous Ei&#8208;type HNO2 elimination mechanism, quasiclassical direct&#8208;dynamics calculations reveal the existence of a dynamic intermediate.

Additionally, while static DFT calculations suggest a concerted but highly asynchronous &lt;i&gt;Ei&lt;/i&gt;-type HNO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; elimination mechanism, quasiclassical direct-dynamics calculations reveal the existence of a dynamic intermediate.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Correct Identification of the Core&#8208;Shell Structure of Cell Membrane&#8208;Coated Polymeric Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The core&#8208;shell structure of cell membrane&#8208;coated PLGA NPs (poly(lactic&#8208;co&#8208;glycolic acid nanoparticles) observed in some negatively stained transmission electron microscopy (TEM) samples is an artifact caused by the staining of the original PLGA NPs and not due to the actual cell membrane coating.







Abstract
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observations of negatively stained cell membrane (CM)&#8208;coated polymeric nanoparticles (NPs) reveal a characteristic core&#8208;shell structure. However, negative staining agents can create artifacts that complicate the determination of the actual NP structure. Herein, it is demonstrated with various bare polymeric core NPs, such as poly(lactic&#8208;co&#8208;glycolic acid) (PLGA), poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether&#8208;block&#8208;PLGA, and poly(caprolactone), that certain observed core&#8208;shell structures are actually artifacts caused by the staining process. To address this issue, fluorescence quenching was applied to quantify the proportion of fully coated NPs and statistical TEM analysis was used to identify and differentiate whether the observed core&#8208;shell structures of CM&#8208;coated PLGA (CM&#8722;PLGA) NPs are due to artifacts or to the CM coating. Integrated shells in TEM images of negatively stained CM&#8722;PLGA NPs are identified as artifacts. The present results challenge current understanding of the structure of CM&#8208;coated polymeric NPs and encourage researchers to use the proposed characterization approach to avoid misinterpretations.

         <title>Electro&#8208;assisted Molecular Assembly Giving Atomic&#8208;Scale Catalytic Active&#8208;Site Detection</title>

Pinpoint: This work proposes a novel electro&#8208;assisted molecular assembly strategy to obtain a carbon defect with a target structure. More specifically, it identified that the topmost carbon atom on a pentagon carbon defect is the active site for the oxygen reduction reaction from the experimental perspective.







Abstract
The artificially accurate design of nonmetal electrocatalysts&#8217; active site has been a huge challenge because no pure active species with the specific structure could be strictly controlled by traditional synthetic methods. Species with a multiconfiguration in the catalyst hinder identification of the active site and the subsequent comprehension of the reaction mechanism. We have developed a novel electro&#8208;assisted molecular assembly strategy to obtain a pure pentagon ring on perfect graphene avoiding other reconstructed structures. More importantly, the active atom was confirmed by the subtle passivation process as the topmost carbon atom. Recognition of the carbon&#8208;defect electrocatalysis reaction mechanism was first downsized to the single&#8208;atom scale from the experimental perspective. It is expected that this innovative electro&#8208;assisted molecular assembly strategy could be extensively applied in the active structure&#8208;controlled synthesis of nonmetal electrocatalysts and verification of the exact active atom.

         <title>Non&#8208;Covalent Integration of a [FeFe]&#8208;Hydrogenase Mimic to Multiwalled Carbon Nanotubes for Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An original [FeFe]&#8208;hydrogenase mimic integrating two pyrene anchors was successfully synthesized and grafted at the surface of multiwalled carbon nanotube based electrodes. The hybrid molecular cathode could reach high turnover numbers for H2 production in fully aqueous media and sustain activity for 20&#8197;h.







Abstract
Surface integration of molecular catalysts inspired from the active sites of hydrogenase enzymes represents a promising route towards developing noble metal&#8208;free and sustainable technologies for H2 production. Efficient and stable catalyst anchoring is a key aspect to enable this approach. Herein, we report the preparation and electrochemical characterization of an original diironhexacarbonyl complex including two pyrene groups per catalytic unit in order to allow for its smooth integration, through &#960;&#8208;interactions, onto multiwalled carbon nanotube&#8208;based electrodes. In this configuration, the grafted catalyst could reach turnover numbers for H2 production (TONH2) of up to 4&#177;2&#215;103 within 20&#8197;h of bulk electrolysis, operating at neutral pH. Post operando analysis of catalyst functionalized electrodes revealed the degradation of the catalytic unit occurred via loss of the iron carbonyl units, while the anchoring groups and most part of the ligand remained attached onto multiwalled carbon nanotubes.

         <title>One&#8208;step Oxidative Monofluorination of Electron&#8208;Deficient Sulfoxides to Access Highly Lewis Acidic Sulfur(VI) Cations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly Lewis acidic fluorosulfoxonium cations can be prepared in a one&#8208;step, chloride promoter&#8208;free fashion from electron&#8208;deficient sulfoxides using [FXe][OTf]. The latter is prepared by reaction of XeF2 with TMS&#8208;OTf, thus representing an inversion of the previously described Umpolung strategy, which failed to convert the same sulfoxides efficiently. The Lewis acidities of the obtained cations have been probed experimentally and computationally.







Abstract
The strongly oxidizing, powerful electrophilic fluorination reagent [FXe][OTf] is shown to effect direct oxidative monofluorination of sulfoxides. This one&#8208;step, chloride promoter&#8208;free methodology provides access to so far inaccessible, yet highly desirable strongly Lewis acidic fluorosulfoxonium cations from electron&#8208;deficient and/or sterically demanding sulfoxides that are shown to be practically unreactive towards the previously reported XeF2/NEt4Cl system. Experimental and density functional theory studies have been conducted to assess the Lewis acidities of the prepared sulfur(VI) cations. Preliminary results obtained with chiral sulfoxides provide early insights into the mechanism of these fluorination reactions.

         <title>CH&#8208;&#960; Multi&#8208;Interaction&#8208;Driven Recognition and Isolation of Planar Compounds in a Spheroidal Polyaromatic Cavity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polyaromatic capsule with a spheroidal cavity displays superior binding abilities toward planar compounds through multiple CH&#8208;&#960; interactions (up to 32). In the cavity, one molecule of polyaromatic coronene is exclusively bound from mixtures and one molecule of Cu(II) complexes is bound quantitatively and isolated from bulk phases.







Abstract
&#960;&#8208;&#960; Interactions are established as a powerful supramolecular tool, whereas the usability of CH&#8208;&#960; interactions has been rather limited so far. Here we present (i)&#8197;selective binding of planar polyaromatics and (ii)&#8197;effective isolation of planar metal complexes by a polyaromatic capsule, utilizing multiple CH&#8208;&#960; interactions. In the spheroidal cavity, one molecule of large and medium&#8208;sized polyaromatic molecules (i.&#8201;e., coronene and pyrene) is exclusively bound from mixtures bearing the same number of aromatic CH groups. Theoretical studies reveal that multiple host&#8208;guest CH&#8208;&#960; interactions (up to 32&#8197;interactions) are the predominant driving force for the observed selectivity. In addition, one molecule of planar metal complexes (i.&#8201;e., porphine and bis(acetylacetonato) Cu(II) complexes) is quantitatively bound by the capsule through aromatic and aliphatic CH&#8208;&#960; multi&#8208;interactions, respectively. The ESR and theoretical studies demonstrate the isolation capability of the capsular framework and an unusual polar environment in the polyaromatic cavity.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature&#8208;Observable Interconversion Between Si(IV) and Si(II) via Reversible Intramolecular Insertion Into an Aromatic C&#8722;C Bond</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of a new silepin with a sterically encumbered silyl ligand was achieved, which shows a spectral observable equilibrium towards the isomeric acyclic silylene at room temperature. The equilibrium was analyzed by VT&#8197;NMR and UV/Vis measurements supported by DFT calculations. Furthermore, the reactivity of the silepin/silylen towards small molecules was investigated.







Abstract
An easily isolable silacycloheptatriene (silepin) 1&#8201;b was synthesized from the reaction of a N&#8208;heterocyclic imino (IPrN) substituted tribromosilane IPrNSiBr3 with the sterically congested bis(trimethylsilyl)triisopropylsilyl silanide KSi(TMS)2Si(iPr)3 (BTTPS). In solution, the Si(IV) silepin 1&#8201;b is in a thermodynamic equilibrium with the acyclic Si(II) silylene 1&#8201;a. The relative concentration of the Si(II) or Si(IV) isomers can be controlled by temperature variation and observed by variable temperature NMR and UV/Vis spectroscopy. DFT calculations show a small reaction barrier for the Si(II)&#8652;Si(IV) interconversion and a small energy gap between the Si(II) and Si(IV) species. The reactivity of 1&#8201;a/b is demonstrated on a variety of small molecules.

         <title>Phosphoric&#8208;Acid Retention in High&#8208;Temperature Proton&#8208;Exchange Membranes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

Strategies to improve PA retention: The leakage of phosphoric acid (PA) from PA&#8208;doped proton&#8208;exchange membranes (PEMs) is a key issue for high&#8208;temperature proton&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cells (HT&#8208;PEMFCs). The detailed discussion of the recent progress to mitigate the PA loss in HT&#8208;PEMs is described in this Concept. Moreover, a new idea is provided on how to decrease the leaching of PA in PEMs with a high acid concentration, and how to address the remaining technical issues.







Abstract
Great efforts have been conducted to develop high temperature proton exchange membrane fuel cell (HT&#8208;PEMFC) due to its features of enhanced electrocatalyst reactivity, simplified hydrothermal management system and high CO tolerance of catalysts, and remarkable progress has been achieved. However, the easy leaching of phosphoric acid (PA) from the membranes during operation limits its commercial scale&#8208;up in complicated environments. This concept here mainly focuses on the recent developments for mitigation of PA loss in PEMs. The probable mechanisms of PA loss are proposed. The approaches to improve PA retention for example via introduction of phosphonic acid by covalent bond, using ion&#8208;pairs interaction and siphoning effect, and blending with inorganic nanoparticles are described in detail. Among these strategies, the siphoning effect from the intrinsic microporous PEMs is the most efficient and enables the cell to operate flexibly within a broad temperature range. Therefore, this concept may provide new ideas for the scientists to retain PA, to improve the cell performance and expand the potential applications of PA doped PEMs at elevated humidity and wide temperature range.

         <title>Oligonucleotides Featuring a Covalently Mercurated 6&#8208;Phenylcarbazole Residue as High&#8208;Affinity Hybridization Probes for Thiopyrimidine&#8208;Containing Sequences</title>

Getting back to (nucleo)base: Oligonucleotides incorporating a central 1&#8208; or 8&#8208;mercuri&#8208;6&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1H&#8208;carbazole residue show great promise as high&#8208;affinity hybridization probes, discriminating between all canonical nucleobases as well as 2&#8208; and 4&#8208;thiothymines by melting temperature margins of at least 5&#8201;&#176;C. Duplexes facilitating HgII&#8722;S coordination were particularly stable, with melting temperatures nearly 30&#8201;&#176;C higher than those of respective unmodified duplexes.







Abstract
Short oligonucleotides incorporating either 1&#8208;mercuri&#8208;6&#8208;phenylcarbazole, 8&#8208;mercuri&#8208;6&#8208;phenylcarbazole, or 1,8&#8208;dimercuri&#8208;6&#8208;phenylcarbazole C&#8208;nucleoside in the middle of the chain have been synthesized and studied for their potential as hybridization probes for sequences containing thiopyrimidine nucleobases. All of these oligonucleotides formed very stable duplexes with complementary sequences pairing the organometallic moiety with either 2&#8208; or 4&#8208;thiothymine. The isomeric monomercurated oligonucleotides were also able to discriminate between 2&#8208; and 4&#8208;thiothymine based on the different melting temperatures of the respective duplexes. DFT&#8208;optimized structures of the most stable mononuclear HgII&#8208;mediated base pairs featured a coordinated covalent bond between HgII and either S2 or S4 and a hydrogen bond between the carbazole nitrogen and N3. The dinuclear HgII&#8208;mediated base pairs, in turn, were geometrically very similar to the one previously reported to form between 1,8&#8208;dimercuri&#8208;6&#8208;phenylcarbazole and thymine and had one HgII ion coordinated to a thio and the other one to an oxo substituent.

         <title>Modulation of Metal Carbonyl Stretching Frequencies in the Second Coordination Sphere through the Internal Stark Effect</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbonyl stretching frequencies of late transition metal pybox complexes demonstrate the intrinsic role of internal electric fields in metal&#8208;carbonyl bonding.







Abstract
Spectroscopic and computational examination of a homologous series of rhodium(I) pybox carbonyl complexes has revealed a correlation between the conformation of the flanking aryl&#8208;substituted oxazoline donors and the carbonyl stretching frequency. This relationship is also observed experimentally for octahedral rhodium(III) and ruthenium(II) variants and cannot be explained through the classical, Dewar&#8211;Chatt&#8211;Duncanson, interpretation of metal&#8208;carbonyl bonding. Instead, these findings are reconciled by local changes in the magnitude of the electric field that is projected along the metal&#8208;carbonyl vector: the internal Stark effect.

         <title>Interface Engineering of Conjugated Polymer&#8208;Based Composites for Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conjugated polymer (CP)&#8208;based composites are potential candidates for solving environmental issues through photocatalysis process. Interface engineering can construct tight interfaces in these composites and further achieve high performance in various photocatalytic applications. In this review, we focus on the characteristics, roles, and regulation methods of different interfacial interactions as well as building methods based on these factors to construct well&#8208;formed interfaces.







Abstract
Photocatalysis can create a green way to produce clean energy resources, degrade pollutants and achieve carbon neutrality, making the construction of efficient photocatalysts significant in solving environmental issues. Conjugated polymers (CPs) with adjustable band structures have superior light&#8208;absorption capacity and flexible morphology that facilitate contact with other components to form advanced heterojunctions. Interface engineering can strengthen the interfacial contact between the components and further enlarge the interfacial contact area, enhance light absorption, accelerate charge transfer and improve the reusability of the composites. In order to throw some new light on heterojunction interface regulation at a molecular level, herein we summarize CP&#8208;based composites with improved photocatalytic performance according to the types of interactions (covalent bonding, hydrogen bonding, electrostatic interactions, &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking, and other polar interactions) between the components and introduce the corresponding interface building methods, identifying techniques. Then the roles of interfaces in different photocatalytic applications are discussed. Finally, we sum up the existing problems in interface engineering of CP&#8208;based composites and look forward to the possible solutions.

         <title>Regiodivergent Asymmetric Pyridinium Additions: Mechanistic Insight and Synthetic Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A regiodivergent asymmetric dearomatization of readily accessible pyridines has enabled the redox&#8208;economic synthesis of both (+)&#8208;N&#8208;Methylaspidospermidine and (&#8722;)&#8208;Paroxetine. A mechanistic rationale for the regiodivergent pyridinium additions and evaluation of their scope was also explored.







Abstract
A practical protocol for the first regiodivergent asymmetric addition of aryl and alkenyl organometallic reagents to substituted N&#8208;alkyl pyridinium heterocycles is described. The couplings proceed with high regiochemical and stereochemical selectivities, and provide access to chiral 1,2,3&#8208; and 1,3,4&#8208;trisubstituted dihydropyridine products, controlled by judicious choice of nitrogen activating agent. To this end, a correlation was found between the parameterized size of the activating group and the C2/C4 regioselectivity in the couplings. The utility of the described chemistry was demonstrated in two concise asymmetric syntheses of (+)&#8208;N&#8208;methylaspidospermidine and (&#8722;)&#8208;paroxetine.

         <dc:description>
A novel La(III)&#8208;based two&#8208;dimensional (2D) metal&#8208;organic framework, [La2/3(qptca)1/2] was successfully synthesized from LaCl3 and 1,1&#8242;&#8201;:&#8201;4&#8242;,1&#8242;&#8201;&#8242;:&#8201;4&#8242;&#8242;,1&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;&#8201;:&#8201;4&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;,1&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;quinquephenyl]&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;,5&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;tetracarboxylic acid (H4qptca) by conventional solvothermal method. Initial studies showed that it was an efficient heterogeneous catalyst for the Friedel&#8208;Crafts alkylation of indole and pyrrole with &#946;&#8208;nitrostyrene with a wide substrate scope.







Abstract
In this study, a novel La(III)&#8208;based two&#8208;dimensional (2D) metal&#8208;organic framework, [La2/3(qptca)1/2] (referred to as SLX&#8208;2), from LaCl3 and 1,1&#8242;&#8201;:&#8201;4&#8242;,1&#8242;&#8242;&#8201;:&#8201;4&#8242;&#8242;,1&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;&#8201;:&#8201;4&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;,1&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;quinquephenyl]&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;,5&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;tetracarboxylic acid (H4qptca) was synthesized by conventional solvothermal method and thoroughly characterized by using X&#8208;ray single&#8208;crystal diffraction, powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, and thermogravimetric analyses. The 2D SLX&#8208;2 features a unique lanthanum center exposed to the skeleton and was used as an efficient Lewis acid catalyst for the Friedel&#8208;Crafts alkylation of indole and pyrrole with &#946;&#8208;nitrostyrene along with a wide substrate scope, giving the desired products in good&#8208;to&#8208;high yields under the optimal reaction conditions. Furthermore, the catalyst was used for twenty cycles, with nearly no effect on its activity, and the reaction was heterogeneous in nature. Moreover, compared to the previous hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;donating MOF catalysts for such alkylation reactions, SLX&#8208;2 showed an excellent stability toward harsh acidic and basic environment, and gave comparable catalytic activities.

         <title>A Plausible Prebiotic Path to Nucleosides: Ribosides and Related Aldosides are Generated from Ribulose, Fructose, and Similar Abiotic Precursors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The prebiotic origins of ribose, nucleosides, and eventually RNA are enduring questions whose answers are central to the RNA World hypothesis. The abiotic synthesis of sugars was first demonstrated over a century ago, but no known prebiotic reaction produces ribose (an aldose sugar) selectively and in good yield. In contrast, ribulose and fructose (ketose sugars) and other monosaccharides are formed in high yield by several robust abiotic reactions. We report here that ketose sugars&#8212;both ketopentoses and ketohexoes&#8212;serve as precursors for the formation of ribosides and other aldosides, as demonstrated by glycoside&#8208;forming reactions involving barbituric acid, a plausibly prebiotic nucleobase. Moreover, we discovered a one&#8208;pot reaction of glyceraldehyde and barbituric acid that under mild conditions, and without special minerals or other catalysts, results in the formation of glycosides. These results reveal that an exclusive or high&#8208;yielding generation of free ribose was not required for its incorporation into processes that provided the foundations for life.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Late&#8208;Stage Diversification of BN&#8208;Embedded Dibenzocorannulenes as Efficient Fluorescence Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diode Emitters.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the synthesis and late&#8208;stage diversification of a new class of hetero&#8208;buckybowl, BN&#8208;embedded dibenzocorannulenes (  B  2  N  2  &#8208;DBC  s). The synthesis is achieved via one&#8208;shot halogenative borylation, comprising the nitrogen&#8208;directed haloboration of alkyne and an intramolecular bora&#8208;Friedel&#8211;Crafts reaction, which provides BN&#8208;embedded dibenzocorannulene possessing two bromo substituents (  B  2  N  2  &#8208;DBC&#8208;Br  ).  B  2  N  2  &#8208;DBC&#8208;Br  undergoes diversification via coupling reactions to provide a variety of arylated derivatives (  B  2  N  2  &#8208;DBC&#8208;R  ), exhibiting strong blue fluorescence. An organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) employing one of the derivatives as an emitter exhibited a high external quantum efficiency of 6.6% and long operational lifetime of 907 h at an initial luminance of 1000 cd m  &#8211;2  , indicating the significant potential for the development of efficient and stable hetero&#8208;buckybowl&#8208;based OLED materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Water Triggered Chemical Transformation of Perovskite Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently emerged lead&#8208;halide perovskite nanocrystals (PNCs) are promising optoelectronic material due to their easy solution processability, wide range of color tunability as well as very high photoluminescence quantum yield. Despite their significant success in lab&#8208;scale optoelectronic applications, the long&#8208;term stability becomes the main issue, hindering them towards commercialization. The highly ionic nature of such lead&#8208;halide structure makes them extremely unstable in water and air. However, recently a very few groups have taken the advantage of such nature of the crystal structure for water&#8208;triggered chemical transformation towards shape, composition and morphology controlled stable and bright PNCs which are otherwise difficult to obtain via typical direct approach. Furthermore, using polymer as an encapsulating layer for the PNCs, water soluble stable PNCs have been prepared. In this review, we summarize the recent progress on the water&#8208;hexane interface chemistry towards chemical transformation to produce several PNCs. Such method not only ensure to yield several shape controlled perovskites nanocrystals, but also formation of perovskites in aqueous phase that shows promising application towards bio&#8208;imaging.</dc:description>

         <title>Stimulus Response Lanthanide MOF Materials Encapsulated with Viologen Derivatives: Characterization, Photophysical Properties and Sensing on Nitrophenols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Viologens (1,1&#8217;&#8208;disubstituted&#8208;4,4&#8217;&#8208;bipyridyl) possessing electron&#8208;deficient property and redox activity, are a class of suitable chromophores to assemble metal&#8208;organic hybrid photochromic materials. &#160;Viologen&#8208;functionalized metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) have attracted much attention for their photochromic properties. &#160;However, the syntheses of lanthanide&#8208;viologen hybrid crystalline photochromic materials remain facing with many challenges, for example, the structures and properties of final products are difficult to predict and are limited by molecular configurations and so on.&#160; In this work, host&#8208;guest composite material Ln&#8208;NH2BDC&#8208;pbpy MOFs are constructed by encapsulating viologen derivative pbpyCl2. &#160;The pbpy2+ moieties is uniformly embed by their &#960;&#8208;&#960; conjugation in the pores of the 3D structure with electrostatic interaction. &#160;Due to the encapsulation of the chromophore pbpy2+ moieties, the Ln&#8208;NH2BDC&#8208;pbpy MOFs exhibit reversible photochromic properties which can change color after irradiation, and can restore the original color after being protected from light or heating. &#160;Interestingly, the fluorescence intensity decreases with illumination time and recovers under dark conditions. &#160;As a result, the Ln&#8208;NH2BDC&#8208;pbpy MOFs have the performance of both photochromic and photomodulated fluorescence. &#160;Based on the outstanding fluorescence performance of the Ln&#8208;NH2BDC&#8208;pbpy MOFs, they also show wonderful detection effect on nitrophenols especially for TNP.</dc:description>

         <title>Overclocking nitronyl nitroxide gold derivatives in cross&#8208;coupling reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nitronyl nitroxides are functional building blocks in cutting&#8208;edge research fields, such as the design of molecular magnets, the development of redox and photoswitchable molecular systems and the creation of redox&#8208;active components for organic and hybrid batteries. The key importance of the nitronyl nitroxide function is to translate molecular&#8208;level&#8208;optimized structures into nano&#8208;scale devices and new technologies. In spite of great importance, efficient and versatile synthetic approaches to these compounds still represent a challenge. Particularly, methods for the direct introduction of a nitronyl nitroxide moiety into aromatic systems possess many limitations. Here, we report gold derivatives of nitronyl nitroxide that can enter Pd(0)&#8208;catalysed cross&#8208;coupling reactions with various aryl bromides, affording the corresponding functionalized nitronyl nitroxides. Based on the high thermal stability and enhanced reactivity in catalytic transformation, a new reagent is suggested for the synthesis of radical systems via a universal cross&#8208;coupling approach.</dc:description>

With 2D pore channels in SNNU&#8208;Bai76 and SNNU&#8208;Bai77 being tuned to the 1D pore channel in SNNU&#8208;Bai78, C3H8 and C2H6 adsorption uptakes are apparently improved and&#160;IAST selectivities of C3H8/CH4 and C2H6/CH4 are almost remained, which indicate that SNNU&#8208;Bai78 may be one potential separation material for the pipeline natural gas purification. These were further confirmed by breakthrough experiments for the simulated pipeline natural gas (C3H8/C2H6/CH4:5/10/85 gas mixture) of three isostructural MOFs. Furthermore, GCMC simulations revealed that due to one of the pore channels blocked by Cl atoms in a couple of 3&#8208;chloro isonicotinic acid with the changed conformation as the pillar, the pore wall of the formed 1D pore channel in SNNU&#8208;Bai78 may interact with the adsorbed C3H8 or C2H6 molecule more strongly, for which more atoms of framework at the new adsorption site will interact with the adsorbed gas molecule by more intermolecular interactions. This was also evidenced by the increased binding energies, being consistent with the tuning of adsorption enthalpies for C3H8 and C2H6 gas molecules, and the reduced C3H8 and C2H6 gas diffusion coefficients in SNNU&#8208;Bai78. Very interestingly, this work is the first example of finely tuning the pore connectivity of MOFs toward strengthened host&#8208;guest interactions for the gas adsorption and separation.</dc:description>

         <title>Cobalt Cyclopentadienyl&#8208;Phosphine Dinitrogen Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>By applying the potassium salts of cyclopentadienyl&#8208;phosphine ligands LK to CoCl 2 , the corresponding cobalt chlorides ( 1 , L Co(II)Cl) were prepared. By reducing complexes 1 with KHBEt 3 under N 2 atmosphere, bridging end&#8208;on complexes, L Co(I)&#8208;N 2 &#8208;Co(I) L ( 2a and 2b ), were obtained successfully. 15 N 2 &#8208;labeled 2a &#8208; 15 N 2 was prepared under 15 N 2 / 14 N 2 exchange in THF solution. L Co(I)&#8208;N 2 &#8208;Co(I) L complex 2a could react with P 4 molecules to release N 2 and generate a&#160;Co&#8208;P 4 &#8208;Co moiety 4 . Further reduction of complex 2b led to cleavage of a P&#8208;C bond in the cyclopentadienyl&#8208;phosphine ligand, while novel &#181; &#8208;PCy 2 bridged Co(0)&#8208;N 2 complex 5 was provided.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;By applying the potassium salts of cyclopentadienyl-phosphine ligands LK to CoCl 2 , the corresponding cobalt chlorides ( 1 , L Co(II)Cl) were prepared. By reducing complexes 1 with KHBEt 3 under N 2 atmosphere, bridging end-on complexes, L Co(I)-N 2 -Co(I) L ( 2a and 2b ), were obtained successfully. 15 N 2 -labeled 2a - 15 N 2 was prepared under 15 N 2 / 14 N 2 exchange in THF solution. L Co(I)-N 2 -Co(I) L complex 2a could react with P 4 molecules to release N 2 and generate a&#160;Co-P 4 -Co moiety 4 . Further reduction of complex 2b led to cleavage of a P-C bond in the cyclopentadienyl-phosphine ligand, while novel &#181; -PCy 2 bridged Co(0)-N 2 complex 5 was provided. DFT calculations were performed and confirmed the experimental observations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Trianionic 1,3,2&#8208;Dioxaborine&#8208;Containing Polymethines: Bright Near&#8208;Infrared Fluorophores</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Very bright NIR polymethines bearing a trianionic chromophore comprising dioxaborine rings (A) and different electron&#8208;accepting end groups (A&#8242;) were synthesized and characterized. The obtained dyes are among the brightest fluorophores in the polymethine family. A single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis unambiguously confirmed the structure of one of the synthesized trianionic dyes.







Abstract
Trianionic polymethines of the A&#8242;&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A&#8242; type comprising dioxaborine rings (A) and different electron&#8208;accepting end groups (A&#8242;) have been synthesized. The obtained dyes absorb and emit light in the near&#8208;infrared region with remarkably high molar attenuation coefficients (&#1013; up to 495&#8201;000&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1 in DMF) and fluorescence quantum yields (&#934;f up to 0.73 in DMF). Thus, the novel trianionic dyes stand among the brightest individual fluorophores known to date &#8211; with a magnitude of fluorescence brightness (&#1013;&#8901;&#934;f) of 313&#8201;000&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1 in DMF. The synthesized dyes demonstrate a minor negative solvatochromism and small Stokes shifts. X&#8208;ray data reveal the nearly planar geometry of the trianionic chromophore. All the obtained compounds are stable in the solid state and in a solution, although the relative stability is much higher in polar aprotic than in protic solvents.

         <title>Coordination of Pnictogenylboranes towards Tl(I) salts and a Tl&#8208; mediated P&#8208;P coupling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The coordination chemistry of only Lewis&#8208;base (LB)stabilized pnictogenylboranes EH2BH2 &#183; NMe 3  (E = P, As) towards Tl(I) salts has been studied. The reaction of Tl[BArCl] (BArCl = [B(3,5C6H3Cl2)4]&#8208;) with the corresponding pnictogenylborane results in the formation of [Tl(EH2BH2&#183;NMe3)][BArCl] (1a: E = P; 1b: E = As). Whereas the Tl ion in 1a/b is monocoordinated, the exchange of the weakly coordinating anion (WCA) in the Tl(I) salt leads to the formation of a trigonal pyramidal coordination mode at the Tl atom by coordination of three equivalents of EH2BH2 &#183; NMe3 in [Tl(EH2BH2 &#183; NMe3)3][WCA] (2a: E = P, WCA = TEFCl; 2b: E = As, WCA = TEF) (TEF = [Al{OC(CF3)3}4]&#8208;, TEFCl = [Al{(OC(CF3)2(CCl3)}4]&#8208;). Furthermore, by using two equivalents of PH2BH2&#183;NMe 3 , a Tl(I)&#8208;mediated P&#8208;P coupling takes place in CH2Cl2 as solvent resulting in [Me3N &#183; BH2PH2PHBH2 &#183; NMe3][WCA] (WCA = TEF, 3a; BArCl, 3b; TEFCl, 3c). In contrast, for the arsenic derivatives 1b and 2b, no coupling reaction is observed. The underlying chemical processes are elucidated by quantum chemical computations.</dc:description>

         <title>New Strategy for Optimizing the Properties of Copper Halide Organic&#8208;Inorganic Hybrid Lighting&#8208;emitting Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aiming to developing high&#8208;performance organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid luminescent materials, a new synthesis strategy has been reported, which can systematically design and synthesis copper(I) halide ionic hybrid structures with coordinated anionic coordinated modules, combining the covalent bonding and ionic bonding between inorganic and organic components into one structure, and use their synergistic effect to prepare high&#8208;performance copper(I) halide hybrid luminescent materials.







Abstract
Copper(I) halide organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid luminescent materials have many advantages, such as diverse structure, facile synthesis, high luminescent efficiency, tunable optical performance, etc., and show a broad application prospect in energy&#8208;saving lighting, display and other fields. However, compared with commercial rare&#8208;earth&#8208;metal&#8208;based phosphors, the reported hybrids generally suffer from poor stability and low luminescent efficiency, which are the bottleneck problem of their practical application. With the aim of developing high&#8208;performance organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid luminescent materials, a new synthesis strategy has been reported. This strategy can systematically design and synthesis copper(I) halide ionic hybrid structures by combining the covalent bonding and ionic bonding between inorganic and organic components into one structure, and use their synergistic effect to optimizing their properties. This design method is expected to develop high&#8208;performance organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid luminescent materials, promote the in&#8208;depth understanding of this field, and provide new ideas for the optimization of other types of hybrid materials.

         <title>Modeling Type&#8208;1 Iodothyronine Deiodinase with Peptide&#8208;Based Aliphatic Diselenides: Potential Role of Highly Conserved His and Cys Residues as a General Acid Catalyst</title>

         <dc:description>Type&#8208;1 iodothyronine deiodinase (ID&#8208;1) catalyzes the reductive elimination of 5'&#8208;I and 5&#8208;I on the phenolic and tyrosyl rings of thyroxine (T4), respectively. Chemically verifying whether I atoms with different chemical properties undergo deiodination through a common mechanism is challenging. Herein, we report the modeling of ID&#8208;1 using aliphatic diselenide (Se&#8211;Se) and selenenylsulfide (Se&#8210;S) compounds. Mechanistic investigations of deiodination using the ID&#8208;1&#8208;like reagents suggested that the 5'&#8208;I and 5&#8208;I deiodinations proceed via the same mechanism through an unstable intermediate containing a Se&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;I halogen bond between a selenolate anion, reductively produced from Se&#8210;Se (or Se&#8210;S) in the compound, and an I atom in T4. Moreover, imidazolium and thiol groups, which may act as general acid catalysts, promoted the heterolytic cleavage of the C&#8210;I bond in the Se&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;I intermediate, which is the rate&#8208;determining step, by donating a proton to the C atom.</dc:description>

         <title>Activated Single Phase Ti4O7 Nanosheets with Efficient Utilization of Precious Metal for Inspired Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is central to modern energy storage and conversion technologies for grid such as fuel cells and electrolysers, but challenges remain due to the lack of reliable, economic, and durable electrocatalysts. Here, we develop single crystal conductive black titanium (Ti  4  O  7  ) nanosheets (NSs) as a new precious metal carrier based on sacrificial hard templates and ultrasonic&#8208;assisted peeling, and deposit Pt clusters on the Ti  4  O  7  NSs induced by wetness impregnation under the irradiation of visible light (VI; 650 nm). Pt/Ti  4  O  7  NSs provide Ti  3+  , Pt  2+  , and Pt  0+  continuous active sites for the ORR multi&#8208;electron process, achieving synergy among them. The assistance of visible light not only makes more uniformly and smaller distribution of Pt nanoclusters, but also strengthens the charge transfer, constructing a strong metal&#8208;support interaction interface. VI&#8208;Pt/Ti  4  O  7  NSs show superior initial oxidation potential and mass activity of 1.61 A mg  &#8208;1  Pt  at a E  1/2  = 0.91 V, which is 9 times higher than that of commercial Pt/C. This work provides an effective strategy for achieving high&#8208;value applications of titanium sub&#8208;oxides and further explores the enhanced&#8208;interface in metals&#8208;Ti  n  O  2n&#8208;1  by light radiation.</dc:description>

Pt/Ti  4  O  7  NSs provide Ti  3+  , Pt  2+  , and Pt  0+  continuous active sites for the ORR multi-electron process, achieving synergy among them. The assistance of visible light not only makes more uniformly and smaller distribution of Pt nanoclusters, but also strengthens the charge transfer, constructing a strong metal-support interaction interface. VI-Pt/Ti  4  O  7  NSs show superior initial oxidation potential and mass activity of 1.61 A mg  -1  Pt  at a E  1/2  = 0.91 V, which is 9 times higher than that of commercial Pt/C. This work provides an effective strategy for achieving high-value applications of titanium sub-oxides and further explores the enhanced-interface in metals-Ti  n  O  2n-1  by light radiation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hijacking the Peptidoglycan Recycling Pathway of Escherichia coli to Produce Muropeptides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Soluble fragments of peptidoglycan called muropeptides are released from the cell wall of bacteria as part of their metabolism or as a result of biological stresses. These compounds trigger immune responses in mammals and plants. In bacteria, they play a major role in the induction of antibiotic resistance. The development of efficient methods to produce muropeptides is therefore desirable both to address their mechanism of action and to design new antibacterial and immunostimulant agents. Here, we engineered the peptidoglycan recycling pathway of Escherichia coli to produce N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;D&#8208;glucosaminyl&#8208;(1&#8594;4)&#8208;1,6&#8208;anhydro&#8208;N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;D&#8208;muramic acid (GlcNAc&#8208;anhMurNAc), a common precursor of Gram&#8208;negative and Gram&#8208;positive muropeptides. Inactivation of the hexosaminidase nagZ gene allowed the efficient production of this key disaccharide, providing access to Gram&#8208;positive muropeptides through subsequent chemical peptide conjugation. E. coli strains deficient in both NagZ hexosaminidase and amidase activities further enabled the in vivo production of Gram&#8208;negative muropeptides containing meso&#8208;diaminopimelic acid, a rarely available amino acid.</dc:description>

         <title>A Small&#8208;Molecule Probe with a Dual Function of miRNA Inhibition and Target identification</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>By virtue of their key roles in&#160;pathologies,&#160;miRNAs&#160;represent a promising class of therapeutic targets.&#160;While high&#8208;fidelity small&#8208;molecule modulators of miRNAs can be identified&#160;via&#160;high&#8208;throughput screening using cellular reporter systems, their modes of action are elusive due to the lack of proper tools. Here, we report a small&#8208;molecule probe, 1a, that is capable of elucidating its biological target along miRNA inhibition. Derived from norathyriol, a nature product, 1a possessed a bioorthogonal alkyne moiety for subsequent labeling&#160;via&#160;copper&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition chemistry. We demonstrated that 1a inhibited a panel of different miRNAs by blocking their loading onto argonaute 2 (AGO2), which is the key protein responsible for miRNA function. With the alkyne handle, we successfully identified AGO2 as an intracellular target of 1a. Therefore, this work presents a novel small&#8208;molecule tool for suppressing and probing miRNA regulatory pathways.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancing Auxiliary&#8208;Mediated Native Chemical Ligation at Challenging Junctions with Pyridine Scaffolds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A properly positioned pyridine ring can speed up auxiliary&#8208;mediated native chemical ligation. A methoxy substituent increases auxiliary stability and facilitates rapid syntheses of long and multiphosphorylated multirepeat proteins and of head&#8208;to&#8208;tail cyclized peptides.







Abstract
To expand the scope of native chemical ligation (NCL) beyond reactions at cysteine, ligation auxiliaries are appended to the peptide N&#8208;terminus. After the introduction of a pyridine&#8208;containing auxiliary, which provided access to challenging junctions (proline or &#946;&#8208;branched amino acids), we herein probe the role of the pyridine&#8208;ring nitrogen. We observed side reactions leading to preliminary auxiliary loss. We describe a new easy to attach &#946;&#8208;mercapto&#8208;&#946;&#8208;(4&#8208;methoxy&#8208;2&#8208;pyridinyl)&#8208;ethyl (MMPyE) auxiliary, which 1) has increased stability; 2) enables NCL at sterically encumbered junctions (e.&#8201;g., Leu&#8208;Val); and 3) allows removal under mildly basic (pH&#8197;8.5) conditions was introduced. The synthesis of a 120 aa long peptide containing eight MUC5AC tandem repeats via ligation of two 60mers demonstrates the usefulness. Making use of hitherto unexplored NCL to tyrosine, the MMPyE auxiliary provided access to a head&#8208;to&#8208;tail&#8208;cyclized 21&#8208;mer peptide and a His6&#8208;tagged hexaphosphorylated peptide comprising 6 heptapeptide repeats of the RNA polymerase II C&#8208;terminal domain.

Abstract
[{Mn(TPA)I}{UO2(Mesaldien)}{Mn(TPA)I}]I formula (here TPA=tris(2&#8208;pyridylmethyl)amine and Mesaldien=N,N&#8217;&#8208;(2&#8208;aminomethyl)diethylenebis(salicylidene imine)) reported by Mazzanti and coworkers (Chatelain et&#8197;al. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2014, 53, 13434) is so far the best Single Molecule Magnet (SMM) in the {3d&#8211;5f} class of molecules exhibiting barrier height of magnetization reversal as high as 81.0&#8197;K. In this work, we have employed a combination of ab initio CAS and DFT methods to fully characterize this compound and to extract the relevant spin Hamiltonian parameters. We show that the signs of the magnetic coupling and of the g&#8208;factors of the monomers are interconnected. The central magnetic unit [UVO2]+ is described by a Kramers Doublet (KD) with negative g&#8208;factors, due to a large orbital contribution. The magnetic coupling for the {Mn(II)&#8208;U(V)} pair is modeled by an anisotropic exchange Hamiltonian: all components are ferromagnetic in terms of spin moments, the parallel component JZ twice larger as the perpendicular one J&#8869;. The spin density distribution suggests that spin polarization on the U(V) center favors the ferromagnetic coupling. Further, the JZ/J&#8869; ratio, which is related to the barrier height, was found to correlate to the corresponding spin contribution of the g&#8208;factors of the U(V) center. This correlation established for the first time offers a direct way to estimate this important ratio from the corresponding gS&#8208;values, which can be obtained using traditional ab initio packages and hence has a wider application to other {3d&#8211;5f} magnets. It is finally shown that the magnetization barrier height is tuned by the splitting of the [UVO2]+ 5&#8201;f orbitals.

Stereocontrol: We have studied the enantioselective transannular aminohalogenation of unsaturated medium&#8208;sized cyclic benzosulfonamides by using both chiral Br&#248;nsted acid and phase&#8208;transfer catalysis. The mechanism of the reaction was also studied by using computational tools; we observed that the key step for stereocontrol involves the participation of an interconverting planar chiral conformer of the nine&#8208;membered cyclic starting material







Abstract
We have studied the enantioselective transannular aminohalogenation reaction of unsaturated medium&#8208;sized cyclic benzosulfonamides by using both chiral Br&#248;nsted acid and phase&#8208;transfer catalysis. Under optimized conditions, a variety of bicyclic adducts can be obtained with good yields and high enantioselectivities. The mechanism of the reaction was also studied by using computational tools; we observed that the reaction involves the participation of a conformer of the nine&#8208;membered cyclic substrate with planar chirality in which the stereochemical outcome is controlled by the relative reactivity of the two pseudorotational enantiomers when interacting with the chiral catalyst.

         <title>Chemical Strategies for Dendritic Magneto&#8208;plasmonic Nanostructures Applied to Surface&#8208;Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dendritic nanoarchitectures allow myriads of chemical strategies for designing hybrid multifunctional materials containing magnetic and plasmonic nanoparticles. Poly(amidoamine) dendrimers are explored in a series of magneto&#8208;plasmonic substrates for surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) detection of a pesticide dissolved in water. The Fe3O4 particles assist the magnetic separation of the dendritic sorbents from aqueous samples for subsequent SERS analysis of molecular adsorbates on gold.

         <title>Revealing Phosphorus Nitrides up to the Megabar Regime: Synthesis of &#945;&#8242;&#8208;P3N5, &#948;&#8208;P3N5 and PN2</title>

Phase in, phase out: Investigations of the phosphorus&#8211;nitrogen system in a laser&#8208;heated diamond anvil cell resulted in the synthesis of new &#948;&#8208;P3N5 and PN2 phases at 72 and 134&#8197;GPa, respectively. Their structures are composed of PN6 octahedra. Upon decompression, &#948;&#8208;P3N5 transforms into the novel &#945;&#8242;&#8208;P3N5 solid that is stable under ambient conditions.







Abstract
Non&#8208;metal nitrides are an exciting field of chemistry, featuring a significant number of compounds that can possess outstanding material properties. These properties mainly rely on maximizing the number of strong covalent bonds, with crosslinked XN6 octahedra frameworks being particularly attractive. In this study, the phosphorus&#8211;nitrogen system was studied up to 137&#8197;GPa in laser&#8208;heated diamond anvil cells, and three previously unobserved phases were synthesized and characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy measurements and density functional theory calculations. &#948;&#8208;P3N5 and PN2 were found to form at 72 and 134&#8197;GPa, respectively, and both feature dense 3D networks of the so far elusive PN6 units. The two compounds are ultra&#8208;incompressible, having a bulk modulus of K0=322&#8197;GPa for &#948;&#8208;P3N5 and 339&#8197;GPa for PN2. Upon decompression below 7&#8197;GPa, &#948;&#8208;P3N5 undergoes a transformation into a novel &#945;&#8242;&#8208;P3N5 solid, stable at ambient conditions, that has a unique structure type based on PN4 tetrahedra. The formation of &#945;&#8242;&#8208;P3N5 underlines that a phase space otherwise inaccessible can be explored through materials formed under high pressure.

         <title>A Photochemical Macrocyclization Route to Asymmetric Strained [3.2] Paracyclophanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel synthetic route to strained cyclophanes is reported, which involves the unexpected photochemical fusion of a carboxylic ester and a non&#8208;activated methyl group. Functional experiments suggest that the previously overlooked C&#8722;C bond forming reaction involves an excited triplet state and intramolecular hydrogen abstraction. Using a flow reactor, a series of otherwise difficult&#8208;to&#8208;synthesize cyclophanes with different substitution patterns were prepared







Abstract
The intricate frameworks of paracyclophanes are an important target for synthesis since they are found in various chiral auxiliaries, solar cells, high&#8208;performance plastics, pharmaceuticals, and molecular machines. Whereas numerous methods exist for the preparation of symmetric paracyclophanes, protocols for the efficient synthesis of strained asymmetric scaffolds are limited. Here we report a remarkably simple photochemical route to strained [3.2]paracyclophanes starting from readily available educts. By way of NMR and X&#8208;ray analyses, we discovered that UV&#8208;irradiation of an aromatic carboxylic ester tethered to a toluene moiety leads to the intramolecular formation of a new C&#8722;C bond, with loss of an alcohol. A systematic evaluation of the reaction conditions and substituents, as well as radical starter and triplet quenching experiments, point to a reaction mechanism involving an excited triplet state and hydrogen atom transfer. The new method proved to be robust and versatile enabling the synthesis of a range of cyclophanes with different substitutions, including an unusual diastereoisomer with two planar chiral centers, and thus proved to be a valuable addition to the synthetic toolbox.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The intricate frameworks of paracyclophanes are an important target for synthesis since they are found in various chiral auxiliaries, solar cells, high-performance plastics, pharmaceuticals, and molecular machines. Whereas numerous methods exist for the preparation of symmetric paracyclophanes, protocols for the efficient synthesis of strained asymmetric scaffolds are limited. Here we report a remarkably simple photochemical route to strained [3.2]paracyclophanes starting from readily available educts. By way of NMR and X-ray analyses, we discovered that UV-irradiation of an aromatic carboxylic ester tethered to a toluene moiety leads to the intramolecular formation of a new C&#8722;C bond, with loss of an alcohol. A systematic evaluation of the reaction conditions and substituents, as well as radical starter and triplet quenching experiments, point to a reaction mechanism involving an excited triplet state and hydrogen atom transfer. The new method proved to be robust and versatile enabling the synthesis of a range of cyclophanes with different substitutions, including an unusual diastereoisomer with two planar chiral centers, and thus proved to be a valuable addition to the synthetic toolbox.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Two Novel Three&#8208;Dimensional Tetraphenylethylene&#8208;Based Rare Earth MOFs with Ultra&#8208;High Proton Conductivity and Performance Stability</title>

         <dc:description>
Eu&#8208;ETTB and Gd&#8208;ETTB were obtained by self&#8208;assembly; their three&#8208;dimensional frameworks provide a channel for proton conduction. Under high humidity, water molecules are adsorbed in the channel and form complex hydrogen bond networks, shown as lightning. Astronauts moving easily along the channel represent the effective transport of protons: proton conductivity reached a maximum value of 2.63&#215;10&#8722;2&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1. More information can be found in the Research Article by L. Du, Q.&#8208;H. Zhao, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202202154).

         <title>E&#8208;selective Semi&#8208;hydrogenation of Alkynes under Mild Conditions by a Diruthenium Hydride Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two do the job: Diruthenium hydrido carbonyl complexes bound to a PNNP expanded pincer ligand are described. Deprotonation of the methylene linkers enables cooperative activation of H2 allowing for the E&#8208;selective semi&#8208;hydrogenation of internal alkynes under mild conditions. Initial insights into the mechanism and the isolation of a deactivated species with an unusual structure are provided.







Abstract
The synthesis, characterization and catalytic activity of a new class of diruthenium hydrido carbonyl complexes bound to the tBuPNNP expanded pincer ligand is described. Reacting tBuPNNP with two equiv of RuHCl(PPh3)3(CO) at 140&#8201;&#176;C produces an insoluble air&#8208;stable complex, which was structurally characterized as [Ru2(tBuPNNP)H(&#956;&#8208;H)Cl(&#956;&#8208;Cl)(CO)2] (1) using solid&#8208;state NMR, IR and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopies and follow&#8208;up reactivity. A reaction with KOtBu results in deprotonation of a methylene linker to produce [Ru2(tBuPNNP*)H(&#956;&#8208;H)(&#956;&#8208;OtBu)(CO)2] (3) featuring a partially dearomatized naphthyridine core. This enables metal&#8208;ligand cooperative activation of H2 analogous to the mononuclear analogue, [Ru(tBuPNP*)H(CO)]. In contrast to the mononuclear system, the bimetallic analogue 3 catalyzes the E&#8208;selective semi&#8208;hydrogenation of alkynes at ambient temperature and atmospheric H2 pressure with good functional group tolerance. Monitoring the semi&#8208;hydrogenation of diphenylacetylene by 1H NMR spectroscopy shows the intermediacy of Z&#8208;stilbene, which is subsequently isomerized to the E&#8208;isomer. Initial findings into the mode of action of this system are provided, including the spectroscopic characterization of a polyhydride intermediate and the isolation of a deactivated species with a partially hydrogenated naphthyridine backbone.

         <title>Towards Substrate&#8211;Reagent Interaction of Lochmann&#8211;Schlosser Bases in THF: Bridging THF Hides Potential Reaction Site of a Chiral Superbase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The isolation of a new THF&#8208;solvated, ferrocene&#8208;based Lochmann&#8211;Schlosser base with all four components lithium, potassium, carbanion, and alkoxide led to the observation of new structural motifs with respect to these superbasic reagents. The &#8220;kick out&#8221; of a THF leads to the detachment, providing the typical Li/K reaction site, whereas the &#8220;smart pass&#8221; leads to the favorable THF&#8208;displacement and the K/K reaction site provided for substrates.







Abstract
The metalation of N,N&#8208;dimethylaminomethylferrocene in THF by the superbasic mixture of nBuLi/KOtBu proceeds readily at low temperatures to afford a bimetallic Li2K2 aggregate containing ferrocenyl anions and tert&#8208;butoxide. Starting from an enantiomerically enriched ortho&#8208;lithiated aminomethylferrocene, an enantiomerically pure superbase can be prepared. The molecular compound exhibits superbasic behavior deprotonating N,N&#8208;dimethylbenzylamine in the &#945;&#8208;position and is also capable of deprotonating toluene. Quantum chemical calculations provide insight into the role of the bridging THF molecule to the possible substrate&#8211;reagent interaction. In addition, a benzylpotassium alkoxide adduct gives a closer look into the corresponding reaction site of the Lochmann&#8211;Schlosser base that is reported herein.

         <title>Transition&#8208;Linker Containing Detergents for Membrane Protein Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
T&#8208;DDMs for membrane proteins: A series of &#8220;hydrophobicity&#8208;neutral&#8221; linkers were incorporated between the hydrophobic tail and hydrophilic maltose of the traditional detergent DDM. This remodeling strategy yielded T&#8208;DDMs, among which superior detergents with excellent physical properties and stabilization capability were identified, as illustrated in the NMR study of A2AAR.







Abstract
It is a pressing need, but still challenging to explore the structure and function of membrane proteins (MPs). One of the main obstacles is the limited availability of matched detergents for the handling of specific MPs. We describe herein the design of new detergents by incorporation of a transition linker between the hydrophilic head and the hydrophobic tail. This design allows a gradual change of hydrophobicity between the outside and inside of micelles, in contrast to the abrupt switch in conventional detergents. Notably, many of these detergents assembled into micelles in while retaining low critical micelle concentrations. Meanwhile, thermal stabilizing evaluation identified superior detergents for representative MPs, including G&#8197;protein&#8208;coupled receptors and a transporter protein. Among them, further improved the NMR study of MPs. We anticipate these that results will encourage future detergent expansion through new remodeling on the traditional detergent scaffold.

         <title>Dynamic Interactions between Brilliant Green and MscL Investigated by Solid&#8208;State NMR Spectroscopy and Molecular Dynamics Simulations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The mechanosensitive ion channel of large conductance (MscL) is a promising template for the development of new antibiotics due to its high conservation and uniqueness to microbes. Brilliant green (BG), a triarylmethane dye, has been identified as a new antibiotic targeting MscL. However, the detailed binding sites of BG to MscL and the dynamic pathway of BG through the MscL channel remain unknown. Here, we investigated the dynamic interactions between BG and MscL using solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy and molecule dynamics (MD) simulations. We identified residue site&#8208;specific binding sites of BG to the MscL channel by solid&#8208;state NMR. In addition, MD simulations revealed that BG conducts through the MscL channel via residues along the inner surface of the pore sequentially, in which the strong hydrophobic interactions between BG and hydrophobic residues F23 and I27 in the hydrophobic gate region of the MscL channel are major restrictions. Particularly, we demonstrated that BG activates the MscL channel by reducing the hydrophobicity of the F23 in the gate region by water molecules that are bound to BG. Taken together, these simulations and experimental data provide novel insights into the dynamic interactions between BG and MscL, based on which we can develop new hydrophobic antibiotics and adjuvants targeting MscL.</dc:description>

         <title>Interfacial C&#8722;S bonds of g&#8208;C3N4/Bi19Br3S27 S&#8208;scheme heterojunction for enhanced photocatalytic CO2 reduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Step&#8208;scheme (S&#8208;scheme) heterojunctions have been extensively studied in photocatalytic carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction due to their excellent charge separation and high redox ability. The built&#8208;in electric field at the interface of S&#8208;scheme heterojunction serves as the driving force for charge transfer, however, the poor interfacial contact greatly restricts the carrier migration rate. Herein, we synthesized g&#8208;C3N4/Bi19Br3S27 S&#8208;scheme heterostructure through in&#8208;situ deposition of Bi19Br3S27 (BBS) on porous g&#8208;C3N4 (P&#8208;CN) nanosheets. The C&#8722;S bonds formed at the interface help to enhance the built&#8208;in electric field, thereby promoting the charge transfer and separation. As a result, the CO2 reduction reaction performance of 10%Bi19Br3S27/g&#8208;C3N4 (BBS/P&#8208;CN) reaches 32.78 &#956;mol g&#8722;1h&#8722;1, which is 341.4 and 18.7 times higher than that of pure BBS and P&#8208;CN, respectively. X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT&#8208;IR) prove the presence of chemical bonds (C&#8722;S) between the P&#8208;CN and BBS. The S&#8208;scheme charge transfer mechanism was analyzed via XPS and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This work provides a new idea for designing heterojunction photocatalysts with interfacial chemical bonds to achieve high charge transfer and catalytic activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning the Roundabout of Four&#8208;Point&#8208;Star Tiles with the Core Arm Length of Three Half&#8208;Turns for 2D DNA Arrays</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>By rationally adjusting the weaving modes of point&#8208;star tiles, the curvature inherent in the tiles can be changed, and various DNA nanostructures can be assembled, such as planar wireframe meshes, perforated wireframe tubes, and curved wireframe polyhedra. Based on the weaving and tiling architectures for traditional point&#8208;star tiles with the core arm length at two DNA half&#8208;turns, we improved the weaving modes of our newly reported four&#8208;point&#8208;star tiles with the core arm length at three half&#8208;turns to adjust their curvature and rigidity for assembling 2D arrays of DNA grids and tubes. Following our previous terms and methods to analyze the structural details of E&#8208;tiling tubes, we used the chiral indices (n,m) to describe the most abundant tube of typical assemblies; especially, we applied both one&#8208;locus and/or dual&#8208;locus biotin/streptavidin (SA) labeling strategies to define the configurations of two specific tubes, along with the absolute conformations of their component tiles. Such structural details of the DNA tubes composed of tiles with addressable concave and convex faces and packing directions should help us understand their physio&#8208;chemical and biological properties, and therefore promote their applications in drug delivery, biocatalysis, biomedicine, etc.</dc:description>

         <title>Orthogonal Crosslinking: A Strategy to Generate Novel Protein Topology and Function</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Compared to the disulfide bond, other naturally occurring intramolecular crosslinks have received little attention, presumably due to their rarity in vast protein space. Here we presented examples of natural non&#8208;disulfide crosslinks, which we refer to as orthogonal crosslinks, emphasizing their effect on protein topology and function. We summarized recent efforts on expanding orthogonal crosslinks using either the enzymes that catalyze protein circularization or the genetic code expansion strategy to add electrophilic amino acids site&#8208;specifically in proteins. The advantages and disadvantages of each method were discussed, along with their applications to generate novel protein topology and function. In particular, we highlighted our recent work on spontaneous orthogonal crosslinking, in which a carbamate&#8208;based crosslink was generated in situ, and its applications in designing orthogonally crosslinked domain antibodies with their topology mimicking bacterial adhesins.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Carbonyl&#8208;containing derivatives show enduring vitality in the field of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials, which can realize high device efficiency by utilizing both singlet and triplet excitons for electroluminescence. And recently, the based on fused ketone/amine system exhibited huge potential for constructing multi resonance TADF (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters, which exhibit higher superiority for narrowband emission compared with conventional TADF emitters with twisted donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) structure. Herein, we summarized the current research progress of both traditional and MR types ketone derivatives with TADF characteristics for introducing the involved molecular design strategy of holding high&#8208;device efficiency and keeping narrowband emission profile simultaneously. We hope this review can inspire the emergence of more high&#8208;performance narrowband materials.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have received increased interest in recent years as an advanced class of materials. By virtue of the available monomers, multiple conformations and various linkages, COFs offer a wide range of opportunities for complex structural design and specific functional development of materials, which has facilitated the widespread application in many fields, including multi valent metal ion batteries (MVMIBs), described as the attractive candidate replacing lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). With their robust skeletons, diverse pores, flexible structures and abundant functional groups, COFs are expected to help realize a high performance MVMIBs. In this review, we present an overview of COFs, describe advances in topology design and synthetic reactions, and study the application of COFs in MVMIBs, as well as discuss challenges and solutions in the preparation of COFs electrodes, in the hope of providing constructive insights into the future direction of COFs.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning the Photocatalytic Performance of Ruthenium (II) Polypyridine Complexes Via Ligand Modification for Visible&#8208;Light Induced Phosphorylation of Tertiary Aliphatic Amines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tuning the redox potential of commonly available photocatalyst to improve the catalytic performance or expand its scope for challenging synthetic conversions is an ongoing demand in synthetic chemistry. Herein, we tuned the excited state properties and redox potential of commercially available [Ru(bpy)3]2+ photocatalyst by modifying the structure of the bipyridine ligands with electron&#8208;donating/withdrawing units. We demonstrate the visible light&#8208;mediated photoredox phosphorylation of tertiary aliphatic amines under mild conditions. A series of cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling reactions were performed employing the RuII complexes as photocatalyst yielding the corresponding &#945;&#8208;aminophosphinoxides and &#945;&#8208;aminophosphonates via C&#8722;P bond formation.</dc:description>

         <title>Interactive Bioconjugation at N&#8208;terminal Cysteines using O&#8209;Salicylaldehyde Esters towards dual site&#8208;selective functionalization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>N&#8208;terminal Cys modification has been intensively studied to produce homogeneous bioconjugates essentially through two modes of reaction: reversible modification with the equilibrium shifted towards the formation of the desired conjugate or stable and irreversible conjugates. Herein, we report a new method of N&#8208;terminal cysteine modification using O&#8208;Salicylaldehyde Esters (OSAEs) through fast conjugation and irreversible deconjugation. These reagents can rapidly react with N&#8208;terminal Cys at low micromolar concentration to form thiazolidines with consequent hydrolysis of the ester moiety into the phenolic derivative. These phenolic thiazolidines can be hydrolyzed under acidic pH (&#8776;4.5) to recover the intact N&#8208;terminal Cys. Bioconjugation reactions using OSAEs offer controlled reversibility to as act as a protecting group for N&#8208;terminal cysteines, allowing the modification of in&#8208;chain residues without perturbing the N&#8208;terminal Cys which can then be deprotected and used as a conjugation site</dc:description>

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Borylation of Propargylic Acetates for the Synthesis of Multisubstituted Allenylboronates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel iron&#8208;catalyzed borylation of propargylic acetates leading to allenylboronates was developed. The method allows preparation of a variety of di&#8208;, tri&#8208; and tetra&#8208;substituted allenylboronates at room temperature with good functional group compatibility. Stereo&#173;chemical studies show that an anti&#8208;SN2&#8217; displacement of acetate by boron occurs, which also allows chirality transfer to yield enantiomerically enriched allenyl&#173;boronates. The synthetic utility of this protocol is further substantiated by transformations of the obtained allenylboronates including oxidation and propargylation.</dc:description>

         <title>Oxidative Desymmetrization Enables the Concise Synthesis of a trans&#8208;Cyclooctene Linker for Bioorthogonal Bond&#8208;Cleavage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Modified trans&#8208;cyclooctenes (TCO) are capable of highly efficient molecular manipulations in biological environments, driven by the bioorthogonal reaction with tetrazines (Tz). The development of click&#8208;cleavable TCO has fueled the field of in vivo chemistry and enabled the design of therapeutic strategies that have already started to enter the clinic. A key element for most of these approaches is the implementation of a cleavable TCO linker. So far, only one member of this class has been developed, a compound that requires a high synthetic effort, mainly to fulfill the multi&#8208;layered demands on its chemical structure. To tackle this limitation, we developed a dioxolane&#8208;fused cleavable TCO linker (dcTCO) that can be prepared in only 5 steps, applying an oxidative desymmetrization to achieve diastereoselective introduction of the required functionalities. Based on investigation of the structure, reaction kinetics, stability, and hydrophilicity of dcTCO, we demonstrate its bioorthogonal application in the design of a caged prodrug that can be activated via in situ Tz&#8208;triggered cleavage to achieve a remarkable &gt;1000&#8208;fold increase in cytotoxicity.</dc:description>

         <title>Shining a Light on Photoresponsive Type III Porous Liquids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Porous materials are the subject of extensive research because of potential applications in areas such as gas adsorption and molecular separations. Until recently, most porous materials were solids, but there is now an emerging class of materials known as porous liquids. The incorporation of intrinsic porosity or cavities in a liquid can result in free&#8208;flowing materials that are capable of gas uptakes that are significantly higher than conventional non&#8208;porous liquids. A handful of porous liquids have also been investigated for gas separations. Until now, the release of gas from porous liquids has relied on molecular displacement (e.g., by adding small solvent molecules), pressure or temperature swings, or sonication. Here, we explore a new method of gas release that involves photoisomerisable porous liquids comprising a photoresponsive MOF dispersed in an ionic liquid. This results in the selective uptake of CO  2  over CH  4  , and allows gas release to be controlled by using UV light.</dc:description>

         <title>A Potent Auto&#8208;Umpolung Ligand for Conjugative Radical Stabilization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbenes with conjugatively connected redox system act as &#8220;auto&#8208;umpolung&#8221; ligands. Due to their electronic flexibility, they should also be particularly suitable to stabilize open&#8208;shell species Herein, the first neutral radical of such sort is described in form of a dialkylamino&#8208;substituted bis(dicyanomethylen)cyclopropanide. Despite the absence of steric shielding, the radical is stable for an extended amount of time and was consequently characterized in solution via EPR measurements. These data and accompanying X&#8208;ray structural analyses indicate that the radical species is in equilibrium with aggregates (formed via &#960;&#8208;stacking) and dimers (obtained via &#963;&#8208;bond formation between methylene carbons).</dc:description>

The crystal structure of Li  2  Ba  4  Al  2  Ta  2  N  8  O has been determined by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and it crystallizes in the orthorhombic space group  Pnnm  (no. 58) with the lattice parameters  a  = 1006.71(3),  b  = 1026.58(3),  c  = 607.10(2) pm, and a volume of  V  = 0.62742(3) nm  3  . The compound is built up from AlN  4  and TaN  4  tetrahedra, which form a three&#8208;dimensional network corresponding to the BCT&#8208;zeolite type structure.

The crystal structure of Li  2  Ba  4  Al  2  Ta  2  N  8  O has been determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction and it crystallizes in the orthorhombic space group  Pnnm  (no. 58) with the lattice parameters  a  = 1006.71(3),  b  = 1026.58(3),  c  = 607.10(2) pm, and a volume of  V  = 0.62742(3) nm  3  . The compound is built up from AlN  4  and TaN  4  tetrahedra, which form a three-dimensional network corresponding to the BCT-zeolite type structure.

         <title>Unprecedented Combination of Polyketide Natural Product Fragments Identifies the New Hedgehog Signaling Pathway Inhibitor Grismonone</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chemical evolution of polyketide natural products leads to the unprecedented combination of biosynthetically related fragments in arrangements not found in Nature. The pseudo&#8208;natural product grismonone was identified to be a potent inhibitor of Hedgehog signaling &#8211; a bioactivity that is not shared by its guiding fragments.







Abstract
Pseudo&#8208;natural products (pseudo&#8208;NPs) are de novo combinations of natural product (NP) fragments that define novel bioactive chemotypes. For their discovery, new design principles are being sought. Previously, pseudo&#8208;NPs were synthesized by the combination of fragments originating from biosynthetically unrelated NPs to guarantee structural novelty and novel bioactivity. We report the combination of fragments from biosynthetically related NPs in novel arrangements to yield a novel chemotype with activity not shared by the guiding fragments. We describe the synthesis of the polyketide pseudo&#8208;NP grismonone and identify it as a structurally novel and potent inhibitor of Hedgehog signaling. The insight that the de novo combination of fragments derived from biosynthetically related NPs may also yield new biologically relevant compound classes with unexpected bioactivity may be considered a chemical extension or diversion of existing biosynthetic pathways and greatly expands the opportunities for exploration of biologically relevant chemical space by means of the pseudo&#8208;NP principle.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Cascade Reaction in Water to Imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridazines as Switchable DSEgens, AIEgens, and ACQgens
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Water&#8208;promoted Pd&#8208;catalyzed cascade reactions realized the discovery of DSEgens with switchable capacity to AIEgens and ACQgens under mild reaction conditions. (DSE=dual&#8208;state emission, AIE=aggregation&#8208;induced emissions, ACQ=aggregation&#8208;caused quenching).







Abstract
Dual&#8208;state emission (DSE) luminophores exhibit strong emissions in both solution and solid states, filling the gaps between aggregation&#8208;induced emissions (AIE) and aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ). However, limited design concepts and complicated synthetic strategies restrict the discovery of novel DSE molecules. Developing efficient and green methodologies to access novel DSE scaffolds via rational design remains highly desirable. In this work, we report a water&#8208;promoted Pd&#8208;catalyzed cascade reaction for the synthesis of multi&#8208;substituted imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridazine derivatives with DSE properties. The intramolecular interactions of the neighboring benzene rings restrict molecular motion, leading to emissions in the solid state (quantum yield: 11&#8201;%), and the newly constructed core structure of imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridazine ensures considerable planarity, allowing for emissions in solution. Further removal of the neighboring phenyl groups resulted in ACQgens, while additional methyl groups led to AIEgens. Subsequent live cell imaging investigations suggested that the novel DSEgens could serve as specific lipid droplet (LD) probes in a wide concentration range.

         <title>Chemoselective Coupling of &#960;&#8208;Systems to Access Metallated 1,4&#8208; or 1,5&#8208;Skipped Dienes in Multicomponent Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Assembling metallated skipped dienes employing C&#8722;C &#960; systems in intermolecular fashion requires the chemoselective activation of either of the components by transition metals. In this Concept article, a clear picture of advancements in the synthesis of skipped dienes decorated with metallic groups (boron and silicon) is described. In addition, recent discoveries are highlighted in depth, emphasizing mechanistic studies, where paradigm shifts resulting from the substrate&#8208;chelation can be anticipated.







Abstract
Integrating distinct unsaturated C&#8722;C systems while simultaneously installing metallic groups has been significantly challenging to execute in a multicomponent reaction. Therefore, designing a suitable mechanistic pathway that provides the required reactivity and selectivity for target C&#8722;C bonds with metallic reagents to ensure successful coupling is the key to success. Copper&#8208;catalyzed borylallylation and silylallylation have emerged as the most efficient strategies for assembling borylated/silylated skipped (1,4 or 1,5) dienes by catalytically combining an organocopper intermediate with allyl electrophiles. However, reactions involving interelemental reagents (e.&#8201;g., [Si]&#8722;[B]) to accomplish intermolecular atom&#8208;economic couplings have not been studied thoroughly. Therefore, to aid the development of new transformations in this research area, this article attempts to include all precedents, including recent studies by the authors. The present Concept article may be helpful for researchers working in this area as it provides a basic conceptual framework.

&lt;p&gt;Integrating distinct unsaturated C&#8722;C systems while simultaneously installing metallic groups has been significantly challenging to execute in a multicomponent reaction. Therefore, designing a suitable mechanistic pathway that provides the required reactivity and selectivity for target C&#8722;C bonds with metallic reagents to ensure successful coupling is the key to success. Copper-catalyzed borylallylation and silylallylation have emerged as the most efficient strategies for assembling borylated/silylated skipped (1,4 or 1,5) dienes by catalytically combining an organocopper intermediate with allyl electrophiles. However, reactions involving interelemental reagents (e.&#8201;g., [Si]&#8722;[B]) to accomplish intermolecular atom-economic couplings have not been studied thoroughly. Therefore, to aid the development of new transformations in this research area, this article attempts to include all precedents, including recent studies by the authors. The present Concept article may be helpful for researchers working in this area as it provides a basic conceptual framework.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Solid&#8208;State Emission and Aggregate Emission of Aroyl&#8208; S,N&#8208;Ketene Acetals Are Controlled and Tuned by Their Substitution Pattern</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By expanding the library of aroyl&#8208;S,N&#8208;ketene acetals to 111 examples, it was possible to fully control their photophysical properties &#8211; ranging from emission color to quantum yield &#8211; in the solid and aggregated states. Thorough analysis then allowed all aspects of these properties to be tuned.







Abstract
Aroyl&#8208;S,N&#8208;ketene acetals are a novel highly diverse class of aggregation&#8208;induced emission fluorogens (AIEgens) with a plethora of interesting properties. An expanded compound library of more than 110 dyes set the stage for the first qualitative control and tuneability of all aspects of their photophysical properties. The interplay of substituents not only allows tuning and prediction of the emission color, but also of the intensity, and quantum yields both in solids and in the aggregated state; these can be rationalized by scrutinizing intermolecular interactions in the crystalline solid state.

         <title>Differential Tunneling&#8208;Driven and Vibrationally&#8208;Induced Reactivity in Isomeric Benzazirines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quantum tunneling and IR vibrational excitation chemistry was discovered to manifest differently in two isomeric benzazirines generated in cryogenic matrices. Computations show that these reactive intermediates have distinct energy profiles regarding two competitive bond&#8208;breaking/bond&#8208;forming pathways. These exceptional results allow probing into the fundamental nature of such unconventional types of chemical reactivity.







Abstract
Quantum mechanical tunneling of heavy&#8208;atoms and vibrational excitation chemistry are unconventional and scarcely explored types of reactivity. Once fully understood, they might bring new avenues to conduct chemical transformations, providing access to a new world of molecules or ways of exquisite reaction control. In this context, we present here the discovery of two isomeric benzazirines exhibiting differential tunneling&#8208;driven and vibrationally&#8208;induced reactivity, which constitute exceptional results for probing into the nature of these phenomena. The isomeric 6&#8208;fluoro&#8208; and 2&#8208;fluoro&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2H&#8208;benzazirines (3&#8208;a and 3&#8242;&#8208;s) were generated in cryogenic krypton matrices by visible&#8208;light irradiation of the corresponding triplet nitrene 32&#8208;a, which was produced by UV&#8208;light irradiation of its azide precursor. The 3&#8242;&#8208;s was found to be stable under matrix dark conditions, whereas 3&#8208;a spontaneously rearranges (&#964;1/2 &#8764;64&#8197;h at 10 and 20&#8197;K) by heavy&#8208;atom tunneling to 32&#8208;a. Near&#8208;IR&#8208;light irradiation at the first OH stretching overtone frequencies (remote vibrational antenna) of the benzazirines induces the 3&#8242;&#8208;s ring&#8208;expansion reaction to a seven&#8208;member cyclic ketenimine, but the 3&#8208;a undergoes 2H&#8208;azirine ring&#8208;opening reaction to triplet nitrene 32&#8208;a. Computations demonstrate that 3&#8208;a and 3&#8242;&#8208;s have distinct reaction energy profiles, which explain the different experimental results. The spectroscopic direct measurement of the tunneling of 3&#8208;a to 32&#8208;a constitutes a unique example of an observation of a species reacting only by nitrogen tunneling. Moreover, the vibrationally&#8208;induced sole activation of the most favorable bond&#8208;breaking/bond&#8208;forming pathway available for 3&#8208;a and 3&#8242;&#8208;s provides pioneer results regarding the selective nature of such processes.

         <title>Aluminum&#8208;Catalyzed Selective Hydroboration of Esters and Epoxides to Alcohols: C&#8208;O Bond Activation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, the molecular aluminum dihydride complex bearing an N, N&#8217;&#8208;chelated conjugated bis&#8208;guanidinate (CBG) ligand is used as a catalyst for reducing a wide range of aryl and alkyl esters with good tolerance of alkene (C=C), alkyne (C&#8801;C), halides (Cl, Br, I and F), nitrile (C&#8801;N), and nitro (NO2) functionalities. Further, we investigated the catalytic application of aluminum dihydride in the C&#8208;O bond cleavage of alkyl and aryl epoxides into corresponding branched Markovnikov ring&#8208;opening products. In addition, the chemoselective intermolecular reduction of esters over other reducible functional groups, such as amides and alkenes, has been established. Intermediates are isolated and characterized by NMR and HRMS studies, which confirm the probable catalytic cycles for the hydroboration of esters and epoxides.</dc:description>

         <title>Excitation&#8208;Wavelength&#8208;dependent Functionalities of Temporally&#8208;controlled Sensing and Generation of Singlet Oxygen by a Photoexcited State Engineered Rhodamine 6G&#8208;anthracene Conjugate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The present study provides design guidance for unique multipotent molecules that sense and generate singlet oxygen (  1  O  2  ). A rhodamine 6G&#8208;aminomethylanthracene&#8208;linked donor&#8208;acceptor molecule (  RA  ) is designed and synthesized for demonstrating wavelength&#8208;dependent functionalities as follows; (i)  RA  acts as a conventional fluorogenic  1  O  2  sensor molecule like the commercially available reagent, singlet oxygen sensor green (SOSG), when it absorbs ultraviolet (UV)&#8208;visible light and reacts with  1  O  2  . (ii)  RA  acts as a temporally&#8208;controlled  1  O  2  sensing reagent under the longer wavelength (~700 nm) photosensitization.  RA  enters an intermediate state after capturing  1  O  2  and does not become strongly fluorescent until it is exposed to UV, blue, or green light. (iii)  RA  acts as an efficient photosensitizer to generate  1  O  2  under green light illumination. The spin&#8208;orbit charge transfer mediated intersystem crossing (SOCT&#8208;ISC) process achieves this function, and  RA  shows a potential cancer&#8208;killing effect on pancreatic cancer cells. The wavelength&#8208;switchable functionalities in  RA  offer to promise molecular tools to apply  1  O  2  in a spatiotemporal manner.</dc:description>

         <title>&#8220;Enantiomeric Resolution and Enantiomer Isolation of&#160;H2TPPS4 J&#8208;aggregate from Aqueous Solution is enabled by Vortexes&#8221;</title>

         <dc:description>Protonated achiral H2TPPS4 spontaneously self&#8208;arranges at acids pH and high ionic strength to build mesoscopic J&#8208;aggregates that are intrinsically chiral. According to the symmetry rule aggregation leads to a racemate that, however, can be unbalanced by chemical (chiral pollutants) or physical stimuli (as vortexing the solution). Vortexing the title racemate, in principle, might either induce chiral separation or chiral enrichment. Indeed, herein it is shown that vortices enable the resolution of this racemic solution exploiting the tendency to deposit, onto the quartz cuvette walls, of the enantiomer favoured by the stirring sense. Simultaneously, over time, it was found that the opposite chiral conformation becomes prevalent in solution realizing a significant enantiomeric resolution. Therefore, after removing all stirring&#8208;favoured chiral J&#8208;aggregate from the solution, the recovering and isolating of the desired enantiomers from the cuvette walls was successfully obtained without complex procedures. In this sense, it has been demonstrated that the stirring forces are executively able to fulfil the chiral separation in H2TPPS4 J&#8208;aggregates, employed as model of a self&#8208;assembled system in aqueous solution.</dc:description>

         <title>An Extremely Stable Interprotein Tetrahedral Hg(Cys)4 Core Formed in the Zinc Hook Domain of Rad50 Protein at Physiological pH</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In nature, thiolate&#8208;based systems are the primary targets of divalent mercury (HgII) toxicity. The formation of Hg(Cys)x cores in catalytic and structural protein centers mediates mercury&#8217;s toxic effects and ultimately leads to cellular damage. Multiple studies have revealed distinct HgII&#8208;thiolate coordination preferences, among which the linear HgII complexes are the most commonly observed in solution at physiological pH. Trigonal or tetrahedral geometries are formed at basic pH or in tight intraprotein Cys&#8208;rich metal sites. So far, no interprotein tetrahedral HgII complex formed at neutral pH has been reported. Rad50 protein is a part of the multiprotein MRN complex, a major player in DNA damage repair processes. Its central region consists of a conserved CXXC motif that enable dimerization of two Rad50 molecules by coordinating ZnII. Dimerized motifs form a unique interprotein zinc hook domain (Hk), which is critical for the biological activity of the MRN. Using a series of length&#8208;differentiated peptide models of the P. furiosus zinc hook domain, we investigated its interaction with HgII. Using UV&#8208;Vis, CD, and PAC spectroscopies as well as anisotropy decay, and 199Hg&#8208;NMR, we discovered that all Rad50 fragments form preferentially homodimeric Hg(Hk)2 species with a distorted tetrahedral HgS4 coordination environment at physiological pH, which is the first example of an interprotein mercury site displaying tetrahedral geometry in solution. At higher HgII content, monomeric HgHk complexes with linear geometry are formed. The Hg(Cys)4 core of Rad50 is extremely stable and does not compete with cyanides, NAC, or DTT. Applying ITC, we found that the stability constant of the Rad50 Hg(Hk)2 complex is approximately three orders of magnitude higher than those of the strongest HgII complexes known to date.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We herein report a method for divergent copper salt controlled reactions of donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropanes and  N  &#8208;fluorobenzene sulfonimide (NFSI). Specifically, in the presence of CuX  2  (X = Cl, Br), the cyclopropanes underwent  formal  umpolung 1,3&#8208;aminohalogenation bifunctionalization via a free radical mediated ring&#8208;opening process to afford 1,3&#8208;aminochlorination and 1,3&#8208;aminobromination products in moderate to good yields. In addition, by using CuI as a catalyst, we synthesized various aminoindane derivatives via 1,3&#8208;aminoarylation cyclizations of D&#8208;A cyclopropanes, the reactions involved a free radical mediated ring&#8208;opening and subsequent ring expansion via C&#8211;H bond activation.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoredox&#8208;Mediated Deoxygenative Radical Additions of Aromatic Acids to Vinyl Boronic Esters and gem&#8208;Diborylalkenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new method to access &#946;&#8208;keto&#8208; gem &#8208;diborylalkanes, by direct deoxygenative radical addition of aromatic carboxylic acids to gem &#8208;dibortlalkenes, is described. The reaction proceeds under mild photoredox catalysis and involves the photochemical C&#8211;O bond activation of aromatic carboxylic acids in the presence of PPh 3 . It generates an acyl radical, which further undergoes an additional reaction with gem &#8208;diborylalkenes to form an &#945;&#8208; gem&#8208; diboryl alkyl radical intermediate, which then reduces to the corresponding anion, which after protonation, affords the &#946;&#8208;keto&#8208; gem diborylalkane product. Moreover, the same scenario has been extended to the vinyl boronic esters, e.g., gem &#8208;Ar, Bpin&#8208;alkenes. Importantly, this protocol provides a general platform for the late&#8208;stage functionalization of bio&#8208;active and drug molecules containing a carboxylic acid group.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of an Antimicrobial Enterobactin&#8208;Muraymycin Conjugate for Improved Activity against Gram&#8208;negative Bacteria</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Overcoming increasing antibiotic resistance requires the development of novel antibacterial agents that address new targets in bacterial cells. Naturally occurring nucleoside antibiotics (such as muraymycins) inhibit the bacterial membrane protein MraY, a clinically unexploited essential enzyme in peptidoglycan (cell wall) biosynthesis. Even though a range of synthetic muraymycin analogues has already been reported, they generally suffer from limited cellular uptake and a lack of activity against Gram&#8208;negative bacteria. We herein report an approach to overcome these hurdles: a synthetic muraymycin analogue has been conjugated to a siderophore, i.e. the enterobactin derivative EntKL, to increase the cellular uptake into Gram&#8208;negative bacteria. The resultant conjugate showed significantly improved antibacterial activity against an efflux&#8208;deficient E. coli strain, thus providing a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept of this novel approach and a starting point for the future optimisation of such conjugates towards potent agents against Gram&#8208;negative pathogens.</dc:description>

         <title>Programmable Photocatalytic Activity of Multivariate Covalent Organic Frameworks Used as Metallaphotocatalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The multivariate approach allows to incorporate several functionalities into a single covalent organic framework (COF) and consequently allows the construction of bifunctional materials for cooperative catalysis. The well&#8208;defined structure of such multivariate COFs is furthermore ideally suited for structure&#8208;activity relationship studies. We report a series of multivariate COFs that contain acridine&#8208; and 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine linkers connected through 1,3,5&#8208;benzenetrialdehyde derivatives. The acridine motif is responsible for broad light absorption, while the bipyridine unit enables complexation of nickel catalysts. These features enable usage of the framework materials as catalysts for light&#8208;mediated carbon&#8211;heteroatom cross&#8208;couplings. Variation of the node units shows that the catalytic activity correlates to the keto&#8208;enamine tautomer isomerism. This allows switching between high charge&#8208;carrier mobility and persistent, localized charge&#8208;separated species depending on the nodes, a tool to tailor the materials for specific reactions. Moreover, nickel&#8208;loaded COFs are recyclable and catalyze cross&#8208;couplings even using red light irradiation.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Cytotoxic Molybdenocenes with&#160;Strong Metabolic Effects Inhibit Tumour Growth in Mice</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of six highly lipophilic Cp&#8208;substituted molybdenocenes bearing different bioactive chelating ligands was synthesized and characterized by NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry and X&#8208;ray crystallography.  In vitro  experiments showed a greatly increased cytotoxic potency when compared to the non&#8208;Cp&#8208;substituted counterparts.  In vivo  experiments performed with the dichlorido precursor, (Ph2C&#8208;Cp)2MoCl2  and the in vitro most active complex, containing the thioflavone ligand, showed an inhibition of tumour growth. Proteomic studies on the same two compounds demonstrated a significant regulation of tubulin&#8208;associated and mitochondrial inner membrane proteins for both compounds and a strong metabolic effect of the thioflavone containing complex.</dc:description>

         <title>Umpolung Reactivity of Imine Ester: Visible&#8208;Light Mediated Transfer Hydrogenation of &#945;&#8208;Aryl Imino Esters by Phenylsilane and Water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A visible&#8208;light mediated chemoselective transfer hydrogenation of &#945;&#8208;aryl imino esters was demonstrated. The methodology allowed the efficient and practical preparation of &#945;&#8208;amino acid esters. The mechanism of the reaction was probed by DFT calculations, and deuteration experiments indicated deuterium was introduced into amino acid esters efficiently (up to 99&#8201;% D ratio), enabling a feasible way to obtain deuterated amino acids using D2O as a cheap deuterium source.

         <title>Observing Nearby Nuclei on Paramagnetic Trityls and MOFs via DNP and Electron Decoupling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electron decoupling (eDec) attenuates the electron&#8208;nuclei hyperfine interaction (depicted as the magenta sphere) and, thus, improves the NMR sensitivity by &#8764;80&#8201;%. Furthermore, the combined DNP and eDec technique reveals that the intramolecular nuclei in trityl and paramagnetic MgHOTP MOF are outside the spin diffusion barrier.







Abstract
Dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) is an NMR sensitivity enhancement technique that mediates polarization transfer from unpaired electrons to NMR&#8208;active nuclei. Despite its success in elucidating important structural information on biological and inorganic materials, the detailed polarization&#8208;transfer pathway from the electrons to the nearby and then the bulk solvent nuclei, and finally to the molecules of interest&#8208;remains unclear. In particular, the nuclei in the paramagnetic polarizing agent play significant roles in relaying the enhanced NMR polarizations to more remote nuclei. Despite their importance, the direct NMR observation of these nuclei is challenging because of poor sensitivity. Here, we show that a combined DNP and electron decoupling approach can facilitate direct NMR detection of these nuclei. We achieved an &#8764;80&#8201;% improvement in NMR intensity via electron decoupling at 0.35&#8197;T and 80&#8197;K on trityl radicals. Moreover, we recorded a DNP enhancement factor of 
 &#8764;90 and &#8764;11&#8201;% higher NMR intensity using electron decoupling on paramagnetic metal&#8208;organic framework, magnesium hexaoxytriphenylene (MgHOTP MOF).

         <title>Sterically and Electronically Flexible Pyridylidene Amine Dinitrogen Ligands at Palladium: Hemilabile cis/trans Coordination and Application in Dehydrogenation Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new N,N,N&#8208;pyridylidene&#8211;amine (PYE) was synthesized, and its coordination to palladium was investigated. A flexible and hemilabile behavior of the ligand was put in light in terms of donation properties (zwitterionic vs. neutral) and in terms of geometry (cis/trans coordination). The complexes were found to catalytically dehydrogenate formic acid in CO2 and H2 in a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art activity.







Abstract
Ligand design is crucial for the development of new catalysts and materials with new properties. Herein, the synthesis and unique hemilabile coordination properties of new bis&#8208;pyridylidene amine (bis&#8208;PYE) ligands to palladium, and preliminary catalytic activity of these complexes in formic acid dehydrogenation are described. The synthetic pathway to form cationic complexes [Pd(bis&#8208;PYE)Cl(L)]X with a cis&#8208;coordinated N,N&#8208;bidentate bis&#8208;PYE ligand is flexible and provides access to a diversity of PdII complexes with different ancillary ligands (L=pyridine, DMAP, PPh3, Cl, P(OMe)3). The 1H&#8197;NMR chemical shift of the trans&#8208;positioned PYE N&#8722;CH3 unit is identified as a convenient and diagnostic handle to probe the donor properties of these ancillary ligands and demonstrates the electronic flexibility of the PYE ligand sites. In the presence of a base, the originally cis&#8208;coordinated bis&#8208;PYE ligand adopts a N,N,N&#8208;tridentate coordination mode with the two PYE units in mutual trans position. This cis&#8211;trans isomerization is reverted in presence of an acid, demonstrating a unique structural and steric flexibility of the bis&#8208;PYE ligand at palladium in addition to its electronic adaptability. The palladium complexes are active in formic acid dehydrogenation to H2 and CO2. The catalytic performance is directly dependent on the ligand bonding mode, the nature of the ancillary ligand, the counteranion, and additives. The most active system features a bidentate bis&#8208;PYE ligand, PPh3 as ancillary ligand and accomplishes turnover frequencies up to 525&#8197;h&#8722;1 in the first hour and turnover numbers of nearly 1000, which is the highest activity reported for palladium&#8208;based catalysts to date.

         <dc:description>
DNA&#8208;based cell surface engineering has greatly expanded the toolbox of cell surface engineering and gave rise to a variety of novel and fascinating applications. Herein, we summarize recent advances in DNA&#8208;based cell surface engineering and the biological applications in mimicking natural cellular components, regulating cell signal transduction, manipulating cell&#8208;cell interaction and tracking molecules on or around the cell surface.







Abstract
Due to its excellent programmability and biocompatibility, DNA molecule has unique advantages in cell surface engineering. Recent progresses provide a reliable and feasible way to engineer cell surfaces with diverse DNA molecules and DNA nanostructures. The abundant form of DNA nanostructures has greatly expanded the toolbox of DNA&#8208;based cell surface engineering and gave rise to a variety of novel and fascinating applications. In this review, we summarize recent advances in DNA&#8208;based cell surface engineering and its biological applications. We first introduce some widely used methods of immobilizing DNA molecules on cell surfaces and their application features. Then we discuss the approaches of employing DNA nanostructures and dynamic DNA nanotechnology as elements for creating functional cell surfaces. Finally, we review the extensive biological applications of DNA&#8208;based cell surface engineering and discuss the challenges and prospects of DNA&#8208;based cell surface engineering.

         <title>Bicomponent Cocatalyst Decoration on Flux&#8208;assisted CaTaO2N Single Crystals for Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction under Visible Light</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The well&#8208;defined CaTaO2N single crystals with uniform particle size were successfully synthesized through a one&#8208;pot NaCl&#8208;assisted nitridation procedure. The performance of photocatalytic CO2 reduction to CO by H2O under visible light was enhanced due to the high crystallinity of CaTaO2N and the modification with core&#8208;shell structured Ni&#8722;Ag bicomponent cocatalyst.







Abstract
Cubic&#8208;like CaTaO2N photocatalysts with high crystallinity and uniform particle size were successfully prepared by the flux&#8208;assisted nitridation method. The growth of CaTaO2N single crystals under different synthesis conditions was systematically investigated to understand the effects of the crystallinity and optical property on photocatalytic performance of CO2 reduction. Moreover, the modification of CaTaO2N single crystals with core&#8208;shell Ni&#8722;Ag bicomponent cocatalyst by two&#8208;step decoration process gave a 2.4 times higher amount of CO evolution than the deposition of sole Ag cocatalyst, because of the synergistic effects of bicomponent cocatalyst on the interfacial electron transfer and surface catalytic process. This study provides a valuable way to construct high&#8208;crystalline photocatalysts with effective bicomponent cocatalyst for visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven CO2 reduction with H2O.

         <title>Rational Design of a Triple Tumor Microenvironment&#8208;Responsive Nanoplatform for Enhanced Tumor Theranostics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of responsive nanoplatforms based on the tumor microenvironment (TME) is critical for tumor diagnosis and treatment. Concentrating on a single TME&#8208;responsive nanoplatform, however, may result in insufficient diagnostic accuracy and treatment efficacy. Herein, layered double&#8208;hydroxides (LDHs) and rare earth nanomaterials (Er@Lu) were combined to create a triple TME&#8208;responsive nanoplatform that was then modified with cypate (a fluorescent dye with strong absorbance) by a peptide chain and loaded with epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), a chemotherapeutic drug. Multiple responses to TME occurred when Er@Lu/LDH&#8208;EGCG reached the colorectal tumor region. Based on an acidic TME, the nanoplatform cracked and released Ni  2+  and EGCG. NiS, which was produced by the reaction of Ni  2+  with abundant H  2  S in tumor cells, was used for photothermal therapy and the released EGCG was used for chemotherapy. The MMP&#8208;7 enzyme specifically expressed in tumor cells recognized and cut the peptide chain, resulting in cypate release. The fluorescence of the Er@Lu was then restored along with the release of cypate because of the absorption competition disappearance. Compared to a single TME response, Er@Lu/LDH&#8208;EGCG with a triple TME response led to a better synergistic therapeutic effect  in vitro  and  in vivo  . This work has provided new approaches for developing multiple TME&#8208;responsive therapeutic nanoplatforms for synergistic therapy with improved diagnosis and therapeutic efficiency.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral&#8208;at&#8208;Metal Silver&#8208;Mediated Base Pairs: Metal&#8208;Centred Chirality versus DNA Helical Chirality</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>When covalently incorporating ligands capable of forming chiral metal complexes into a DNA oligonucleotide duplex, an enantiospecific formation of metal&#8208;mediated base pairs is possible. We have been investigating the chirality of the silver&#8208;mediated base pair  P  &#8211;Ag  I  &#8211;  P  (  P  , 1  H  &#8208;imidazo[4,5&#8208;  f  ][1,10]phenanthroline) depending on the number of consecutive  P  :  P  pairs within a series of duplexes. Towards this end, both enantiomers of the nucleoside analogue 3&#8208;(1  H  &#8208;imidazo[4,5&#8208;  f  ][1,10]phenanthrolin&#8208;1&#8208;yl)propane&#8208;1,2&#8208;diol comprising an acyclic backbone were introduced into DNA duplexes, resulting in diastereomeric metal&#8208;mediated base pairs. The same chiral&#8208;at&#8208;metal complex is formed inside the duplex for up to five neighbouring  P  &#8211;Ag  I  &#8211;  P  pairs, irrespective of whether (  S  )&#8208;  P  or (  R  )&#8208;  P  is used. With six silver&#8208;mediated base pairs, the chirality of the metal complex is inverted for (  S  )&#8208;  P  but not for (  R  )&#8208;  P  . This indicates an intricate balance of what determines the configuration of the metal complex, the intrinsically preferred metal&#8208;centred chirality or the DNA helical chirality.</dc:description>

         <title>Anion Recognition with Antimony(III) and Bismuth(III) Triaryl&#8208;Based Pnictogen Bonding Receptors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of Antimony(III) and Bismuth(III) pnictogen bonding (PnB) triaryl&#8208;based anion receptors demonstrate PnB anion binding strength is influenced strongly by the electronic withdrawing nature of the aryl substituent and pnictogen atom donor identity. The triaryl PnB receptors display chloride anion selectivity over a range of halides and oxoanions. The synthesis and preliminary chloride anion binding investigations of the first mixed PnB&#8208;HB anion host systems are also described.







Abstract
The synthesis and characterisation of a library of acyclic antimony(III) and bismuth(III) triaryl pnictogen bonding (PnB) receptor systems are reported. In the first&#8208;generation receptor series, quantitative 1H&#8197;NMR chloride titration experiments in THF solvent media reveal halide anion binding potency is intimately correlated with both the electronic&#8208;withdrawing nature of the aryl&#8208; substituent and the polarisability of the PnB donor. Further extensive anion binding investigations with the most potent Sb&#8208; and Bi&#8208;based PnB receptors: 1&#8901;Sb2CF3 and 1&#8901;Bi2CF3, reveal novel selectivity profiles, both displaying Cl&#8722; selectivity relative to the heavier halides and, impressively, to a range of highly basic oxoanions. The synthesis and preliminary chloride anion binding studies of a series of novel tripodal tris&#8208;proto&#8208;triazole triaryl Sb(III) and Bi(III) mixed PnB&#8208;HB receptor systems are also described. Whereas parent triphenyl Sb(III) and Bi(III) compounds are incapable of binding Cl&#8722; in THF solvent media, the PnB&#8208;triazole HB host systems exhibit notable halide affinity.

         <title>On the Mechanism of the Formal [2+2] Cycloaddition &#8211; Retro&#8208;electrocyclization (CA&#8208;RE) Reaction</title>

         <dc:description>The [2+2] cycloaddition &#8211; retro&#8208;electrocyclization (CA&#8211;RE) reaction is a &#8220;click&#8208;like&#8221; protocol for facile synthesis of donor&#8208;acceptor chromophores from an alkyne and tetracyanoethylene. Herein we shed light on the mechanism of this reaction by detailed kinetics studies using 1H&#8208;NMR spectroscopy. By considering several experiments simultaneously, a variety of mechanistic models was evaluated. Surprisingly, a model in which the final 1,1,4,4&#8208;tetracyanobuta&#8208;1,3&#8208;diene product promoted the first step was the only one that described well the experimental data. This autocatalysis model also involved a non&#8208;concerted, stepwise formation of the cyclobutene cycloaddition adduct. By proper choice of conditions, we were able to generate the transient cyclobutene in sufficient amount to verify it as an intermediate using 13C&#8208;NMR spectroscopy. For its final retro&#8208;electrocyclization step, simple first&#8208;order kinetics was observed and only minor solvent dependence, which indicates a concerted reaction.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The general strategies to stabilize a boryl radical involve single electron delocalization by p&#8208;system and the steric hinderance by bulky groups. Herein we report a new class of boryl radicals with intramolecular mixed&#8208;valent B(III)&#8208;Br&#8230;B(II) adducts ligated by cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene (CAAC). The radicals feature a large spin density on the boron center, which is ascertained by EPR spectroscopy and DFT calculations. Structural and computational analyses revealed that the stability of radical species was assisted by CAAC ligand and the weak but significant B(III)&#8208;Br&#8230;B(II) interaction, suggesting a cooperative avenue for stabilization of boryl radicals. Two&#8208;electron reduction of these new boryl radicals provides C&#8208;H insertion products via a borylene intermediate.</dc:description>

         <title>Organic Crystals with Response to Multiple Stimuli: Mechanical Bending, Acid&#8208;Induced Bending and Heating&#8208;Induced Jumping</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multiple stimuli&#8208;responsive molecular crystals are attracting extensive attentions due to their potential as smart materials, such as molecular machines, actuators, and sensors. However, the task of giving a single crystal multiple stimuli&#8208;responsive properties remains extremely challenging. Herein, we found two polymorphs (Form O and Form R) of a Schiff base compound, which could respond to multiple stimuli (external force, acid, heat). Form O and Form R have different elastic deformability, which can be attributed to the differences in the molecular conformation, structural packing and intermolecular interactions. Moreover, both polymorphs exhibit reversible bending driven by volatile acid vapor, for which we hypothesize is caused by reversible protonation reaction of imines with formic acid. In addition, jumping can be triggered by heating due to the significant anisotropic expansion. The integration of reversible bending and jumping into one single crystal expands the application scope of stimuli&#8208;responsive crystalline materials.</dc:description>
