      <title>Polymerization&#8208;driven photoluminescence in alkanolamine&#8208;based C&#8208;dots</title>
      <dc:description>Carbonized polymer dots (CPDs), a peculiar type of Carbon dots, show extremely high quantum yields, making them very attractive nanostructures for application in optics and biophotonics. The origin of CPD strong photoluminescence resides in a complicated interplay of several radiative mechanisms. To understand the correlation between CPD processing and properties, we have studied the early stage formation of carbonized polymer dots. In the synthesis, citric acid monohydrate and  2&#8208;Amino&#8208;2&#8208;(hydroxymethyl)propane&#8208;1,3&#8208;diol  have been thermally degraded at 180&#176;C.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Carbonized polymer dots (CPDs), a peculiar type of Carbon dots, show extremely high quantum yields, making them very attractive nanostructures for application in optics and biophotonics. The origin of CPD strong photoluminescence resides in a complicated interplay of several radiative mechanisms. To understand the correlation between CPD processing and properties, we have studied the early stage formation of carbonized polymer dots. In the synthesis, citric acid monohydrate and  2&#8208;Amino&#8208;2&#8208;(hydroxymethyl)propane&#8208;1,3&#8208;diol  have been thermally degraded at 180&#176;C. The use of an oil bath instead of a more traditional hydrothermal reactor has allowed to monitor the CPD properties at different reactions times. Transmission electron microscopy, time&#8208;resolved photoluminescence, nuclear magnetic resonance, infrared and Raman spectroscopy have revealed the formation of polymeric species with amide and ester bonds.

      <title>Impact of Heteroatom Substitution on Dual&#8208;State Emissive Rigidified 2&#8208;(2&#8217;&#8208;hydroxyphenyl)benzazole Dyes: Towards Ultra&#8208;Bright ESIPT Fluorophores</title>
      <dc:description>Dual&#8208;medium fluorophores which show significant luminescence intensity in solution and in the solid&#8208;state from two emissive forms remain scarce in the literature and can only result from a subtle balance between rigidity, planarity and solubility while avoiding detrimental &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking and strong molecular motions. 2&#8208;(2&#8217;&#8208;hydroxyphenyl)benzazole (HBX) fluorophores are popular Excited&#8208;State Intramolecular Proton Transfer (ESIPT) emitters largely studied for their synthetic versatility, photostability, strong solid&#8208;state fluorescence and ability to engineer dual emission paving the way to applications as white emitters, ratiometric sensors, and cryptographic dyes. They are, however heavily quenched in solution, due to efficient non&#8208;radiative pathways taking place as a consequence of the proton transfer in the excited&#8208;state. A mono&#8208; or bis&#8208;functionalization of the HBX scaffold with ethynyl&#8208;extended moieties was previously shown to yield enhanced brightness of the resulting dyes in solution. In this contribution, the nature of the heteroring constitutive of these rigidified HBX dyes was modified and we demonstrate that this simple structural modification triggers major optical changes in terms of emission color, dual emission engineering, and importantly, fluorescent quantum yield. Investigation of the photophysical properties in solution and in the solid&#8208;state of a series of ethynyl&#8208;TIPS extended HBX fluorophores, along with  ab initio  calculations demonstrate the very promising abilities of these dyes to act as bright dual&#8208;state emitters, in both solution and solid&#8208;state.</dc:description>

The two tTCNTruX and PCNtTruX TADF emitters were designed to have Dexter energy transfer managing blocking groups either in the donor or acceptor unit of the donor&#8208;acceptor type TADF sensitizer. The TADF materials showed small singlet&#8208;triplet energy splitting and high reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) rate for effective sensitization of the fluorescent emission of the fluorescent emitter. The tTCNTruX and PCNtTruX sensitized fluorescent devices showed maximum external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of 17.7% and 11.5% in the yellow and red devices, respectively, which were higher than those of the TADF sensitized devices with the corresponding TADF sensitizer without the blocking group. Moreover, the device lifetime was also extended by employing the tTCNTruX and PCNtTruX sensitizers.</dc:description>

      <title>CompassR yields highly organic solvent&#8208;tolerant enzymes through recombination of compatible substitutions</title>
      <dc:description>The CompassR rule enables to identify among beneficial substitutions the ones, which can beneficially be recombined in directed evolution. Herein, a recombination strategy is systematically investigated to minimize experimental efforts and maximize possible improvements. In total, 15 beneficial substitutions from  Bacillus subtilis  lipase A (BSLA), which improve organic cosolvent 1,4&#8208;dioxane (DOX) resistance, were studied to compare two recombination strategies 2GenReP and InSiReP employing CompassR. Remarkably, both strategies yielded a highly DOX resistant variant M4 (I12R/Y49R/E65H/N98R/K122E/L124K) with an up to 14.6&#8208;fold improvement after screening of ~270 clones. M4 has a remarkable enhanced resistance in 60% (v/v) acetone (6.0&#8208;fold), 30% (v/v) ethanol (2.1&#8208;fold), and 60% (v/v) methanol (2.4&#8208;fold) compared to BSLA wild type. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed that attracting water molecules by charged surface substitutions is the main driver for increasing the DOX resistance of BSLA M4.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The CompassR rule enables to identify among beneficial substitutions the ones, which can beneficially be recombined in directed evolution. Herein, a recombination strategy is systematically investigated to minimize experimental efforts and maximize possible improvements. In total, 15 beneficial substitutions from  Bacillus subtilis  lipase A (BSLA), which improve organic cosolvent 1,4&#8208;dioxane (DOX) resistance, were studied to compare two recombination strategies 2GenReP and InSiReP employing CompassR. Remarkably, both strategies yielded a highly DOX resistant variant M4 (I12R/Y49R/E65H/N98R/K122E/L124K) with an up to 14.6&#8208;fold improvement after screening of ~270 clones.

      <dc:description>
The 1,2&#8208;metallate rearrangement of boronate complexes has gained huge attention due to stereoselective formation of C&#8722;C and C&#8722;B bonds. Moreover, this methodology has been widely applied in the regio&#8208; and stereo selective functionalization of heterocycles, an important structural motif that are prevalent in top&#8208;selling pharmaceuticals. In addition to the activation of heterocyclic boronate complex via stoichiometric electrophilic activating reagents, several catalytic methods using transition metals in presence or absence of light have been evolved.

      <title>Unravelling structural mysteries of simple organozinc alkoxides</title>
      <dc:description>Simple RZnOR&#8217; alkoxides are among the first known organozinc compounds, and widespread interest on their multifaced chemistry has been driven by fundamental significance and potential applications including various catalytic reactions. Nevertheless, their chemistry in solution and in the solid state remains both relatively poorly understood and a subject to continuous debate.

Both novel aggregates are robust in the solid state and resistant towards mechanical force. In turn, using  1H NMR and diffusion&#8208;order spectroscopy, we demonstrate that new RZnOR&#8217; alkoxides are kinetically labile in the solution and readily undergo ligand scrambling, such as in the case of Schlenk equilibrium.

      <title>[Gd(AAZTA)]&#8208; derivatives with n&#8208;alkyl acid side chains show improved properties for their application as MRI contrast agents</title>
      <dc:description>Herein the synthesis and an extensive characterization of two novel Gd(AAZTA) derivatives functionalized with short (C2  and C4  )  n  &#8208;alkyl acid function are reported. The carboxylate functionality is the site for further conjugations for the design of more specific contrast agents (CAs). Interestingly it has been found that the synthetized complexes display enhanced properties for their use as MRI contrast agents by their own.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Herein the synthesis and an extensive characterization of two novel Gd(AAZTA) derivatives functionalized with short (C2  and C4  )  n  &#8208;alkyl acid function are reported. The carboxylate functionality is the site for further conjugations for the design of more specific contrast agents (CAs). Interestingly it has been found that the synthetized complexes display enhanced properties for their use as MRI contrast agents by their own.

      <title>Long&#8208;Range LMCT Coupling in EuIII Coordination Polymers for an Effective Molecular Luminescent Thermometer</title>
      <dc:description>
A luminescent EuIII/GdIII coordination polymer with high brightness, high temperature sensitivity, and high thermo&#8208;stability is reported. The prominent luminescent properties were derived from the control of long&#8208;range &#960;&#8211;f orbital interactions. The conceptual design for the construction of a highly luminescent temperature&#8208;sensitive lanthanide coordination polymer opens up a new field at the interface between the fields of luminescence thermometry and molecular materials.

      <title>Boosting the Iodine Adsorption and Radioresistance of Th&#8208;UiO&#8208;66 MOFs via Aromatic Substitution</title>
      <dc:description>
Effective capture of radioactive iodine is of paramount importance for the safe and long&#8208;term storage of fission products in the nuclear fuel cycle. By adopting the ThIV cation with appropriate &#8220;hardness&#8221; as the building block, a series of functionalized Th&#8208;UiO&#8208;66 MOFs with high&#8208;quality single crystals were synthesized, serving as a model to investigate the effects of substituents on iodine adsorption. The electro&#8208;donating NH2 group exhibits the most positive role on boosting iodine adsorption and it can also enhance the radioresistance of the corresponding framework. More information can be found in the Communication by Z.&#8208;H. Zhang, J. Lin, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202003621).

      <title>In Situ Synthesis of Manganese Oxide as an Oxygen&#8208;Evolving Catalyst: A New Strategy</title>
      <dc:description>
So far, all studies on oxygen&#8208;evolution reactions using Mn oxides in the presence of cerium(IV) ammonium nitrate (CAN) have been carried out by synthesizing Mn oxides in the first step, followed by the investigation of the Mn oxides in the presence of oxidants for the oxygen&#8208;evolution reaction (OER). This work presents a case study of a new and promising strategy for in situ catalyst synthesis by adding MnII to a CAN solution, resulting in the formation of Mn&#8208;based catalysts for OER.

      <title>Investigation of luminescent triplet states in tetranuclear Cu(I) complexes: thermochromism and structural characterization</title>
      <dc:description>To develop new and flexible Cu(I) containing luminescent substances, we extend our previous investigations on two metal&#8208;centred species to four metal&#8208;centred complexes. These complexes could be a basis for designing new organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) relevant species. Both the synthesis and in&#8208;depth spectroscopic analysis, combined with high&#8208;level theoretical calculations are presented on a series of tetranuclear Cu(I) complexes with a halide containing Cu  4  X  4  core (X = iodide, bromide or chloride) and 2&#8209;(diphenylphosphino)pyridine bridging ligands with a methyl group in  para  (4&#8208;Me) or  ortho  (6&#8208;Me) position of the pyridine ring. The structure of the electronic ground state is characterized by X&#8208;ray diffraction, NMR, and IR spectroscopy with the support of theoretical calculations. In contrast to the  para  system, the complexes with  ortho  &#8208;substituted bridging ligands show a remarkable and reversible temperature&#8208;dependent dual phosphorescence. Here, we combine for the first time the luminescence thermochromism with time&#8208;resolved FTIR spectroscopy. Thus, we receive experimental data on the structures of the two triplet states involved in the luminescence thermochromism. The transient IR spectra of the underlying triplet metal/halide&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (  3  M/XLCT) and cluster&#8208;centred (  3  CC) states were obtained and interpreted by comparison with calculated vibrational spectra.

      <title>Binding motifs in the naked complexes of target amino acids with an excerpt of antitumor active biomolecule. An ion vibrational spectroscopy assay</title>
      <dc:description>The structures of proton&#8208;bound complexes of 5,7&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;4H&#8208;chromen&#8208;4&#8208;one (  1  ) and basic amino acids (AAs), namely histidine (His) and lysine (Lys) have been examined by mass spectrometry,&#160; IR ion spectroscopy and quantum chemical calculations. This selection of systems is founded on the fact that  1  represents a portion of Glabrescione B, a natural small molecule of promising antitumor activity, while His and Lys are protein residues lining the cavity of the alleged receptor binding site. These species are thus a model of the bioactive adduct, though obviously the isolated state of the present study bears little resemblance with the complex biological environment. Common feature of [  1  +AA+H]  +  &#160; complexes is the presence of a protonated AA bound to neutral  1  , in spite of the fact that the gas phase basicity of  1  is comparable to the one of Lys and His. The carbonyl group of  1  acts as powerful hydrogen bond acceptor. Within [  1  +AA+H]  +  &#160; the side chain substituents (imidazole group for His and terminal amino group for Lys) present comparable basic properties as the a&#8208;amino group, taking part to a cooperative H&#8208;bond network. The structural assignment, relying on the comparative analysis of the IRMPD spectrum and calculated IR spectra for the candidate geometries, derives from an examination over two frequency ranges, 900&#8208;1800 cm  &#8208;1  and 2900&#8208;3700 cm  &#8208;1  . Information gained from the latter one proved especially valuable, for example pointing to the contribution of species characterized by an unperturbed carboxylic OH&#8208; or imidazole NH&#8208;stretching mode.</dc:description>

      <title>Tuning the organogelating and spectroscopic properties of a C3&#8208;symmetric pyrene&#8208;based gelator through charge transfer</title>
      <dc:description>Two&#8208;component organogels and xerogels based on a C3&#8208;symmetric pyrene&#8208;containing gelator have been deeply characterized through a wide range of techniques. Based on the formation of charge transfer complexes, the gelation phenomenon proved to be highly dependent on the nature of the electron poor dopant. This parameter significantly influenced the corresponding gelation domains, the critical gelation concentrations of acceptor dopants, the gel&#8208;to&#8208;sol transition temperatures, the microstructures formed in the xerogel state and their spectroscopic properties. In particular, titrations and variable&#8208;temperature UV&#8208;visible absorption spectroscopy demonstrated the key role of donor&#8208;acceptor interactions with a remarkable correlation between the phase transition temperatures and the disappearance of the characteristic charge transfer bands.The assignment of these electronic transitions was confirmed through time&#8208;dependent density functional theory (TD&#8208;DFT) calculations. Eventually, it was shown that the luminescent properties of these materials can be tuned with the temperature, either in intensity or emission wavelength.</dc:description>

      <title>Large&#8208;Amplitude Thermal Vibration&#8208;Coupled Valence Tautomeric Transition Observed in a Conductive One&#8208;Dimensional Rhodium&#8211;Dioxolene Complex</title>
      <dc:description>The exploration of dynamic molecular crystals is a fascinating theme for materials scientists owing to their fundamental science and potential application to molecular devices. Herein, we report a one&#8208;dimensional (1D) rhodium&#8211;dioxolene complex that exhibits drastic changes in properties with the phase transition. The X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) reveals that the room&#8208;temperature (RT) phase is in a mixed&#8208;valence state, and therefore, the drastic changes originate from the mixed&#8208;valence state appearing in the RT phase. Another notable feature is that the mean square displacements of the rhodium atoms along the 1D chain dramatically increase in the RT phase, indicating a large&#8208;amplitude vibration of the Rh&#8211;Rh bonds. From these results, we propose a possible mechanism for the appearance of the mixed&#8208;valence state in the RT phase based on the thermal electron transfer from the 1D d&#8208;band to the semiquinonato &#960;* orbital coupled with the large&#8208;amplitude vibration of the Rh&#8211;Rh bonds.</dc:description>

      <title>General synthesis of sulfonate&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework derived composite of MxSy@N/S doped carbon for high&#8208;performance lithium/sodium ion batteries</title>
      <dc:description>Herein, a general and simple strategy has been realized for preparing metal sulfide (MxSy) nanoparticles immobilized into N/S co&#8208;doped carbon (NSC) via an one&#8208;step pyrolysis method for the first time, in which the organic ligand 1, 5&#8208;naphthalenedisulfonic acid in metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) precursor is as a sulfur source, and metal ions are in situ sulfurized to form MxSy nanoparticles, results in formation of MxSy/NSC (M=Fe, Co, Cu, Ni, Mn, Zn) composites. Benefiting from the MxSy nanoparticles and conductive carbon, a synergistic effect of the composite has been achieved. For instance, the composite of Fe7S8/NSC as an anode displays excellent long&#8208;term cycling stability in lithium/sodium ion batteries. At 5 A g&#8208;1, large capacities of 645 mA h g&#8208;1 and 426.6 mA h g&#8208;1 can be retained after 1500 cycles for lithium&#8208;ion battery and after 1000 cycles for sodium&#8208;ion battery, respectively.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Herein, a general and simple strategy has been realized for preparing metal sulfide (MxSy) nanoparticles immobilized into N/S co&#8208;doped carbon (NSC) via an one&#8208;step pyrolysis method for the first time, in which the organic ligand 1, 5&#8208;naphthalenedisulfonic acid in metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) precursor is as a sulfur source, and metal ions are in situ sulfurized to form MxSy nanoparticles, results in formation of MxSy/NSC (M=Fe, Co, Cu, Ni, Mn, Zn) composites. Benefiting from the MxSy nanoparticles and conductive carbon, a synergistic effect of the composite has been achieved. For instance, the composite of Fe7S8/NSC as an anode displays excellent long&#8208;term cycling stability in lithium/sodium ion batteries. At 5 A g&#8208;1, large capacities of 645 mA h g&#8208;1 and 426.6 mA h g&#8208;1 can be retained after 1500 cycles for lithium&#8208;ion battery and after 1000 cycles for sodium&#8208;ion battery, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Electrophilic and Nucleophilic Aromatic Substitutions are Mechanistically Similar with Opposite Polarity</title>
      <dc:description>
Oranges and lemons: The analogy between the mechanisms of electrophilic and nucleophilic aromatic substitution is discussed and supported by several synthetic examples. These important processes are in an Umpolung relationship.







Abstract
Confrontation of the recently formulated general mechanism of nucleophilic substitution in electron&#8208;deficient arenes with the well&#8208;known mechanism of electrophilic substitution revealed that these fundamental processes are mechanistically identical but proceed according to opposite polarity&#8212;an Umpolung relation. In this viewpoint this apparently controversial concept is supported by discussion of a variety of experimental results.

      <dc:description>Cyanuric acid heterocycle (CA) forms supramolecular structures with adenine nucleobases/nucleosides and oligonucleotides leading to speculation that they can act as forerunners to RNA. Herein, we studied the assembly behavior of RNA containing CA and CA&#8208;ribose nucleoside.

We propose an unprecedented non&#8208;covalent supramolecular helicene structure to account for the striking difference in behavior, which has implications for novel paradigms for reorganizing the structures of nucleic acids, synthesis of long helicenes, and pre&#8208;RNA world paradigms. The results caution against extrapolating the self&#8208;assembly behavior of individual heterocycles from the level of monomers to oligomers &#8211; since the base&#8208;paring properties of (non)canonical nucleobases are impacted by the type of oligomeric backbone to which they are attached.</dc:description>

      <title>Mechanochemically triggered topology changes in expanded porphyrins</title>
      <dc:description>A hitherto unexplored class of molecules for molecular force probe applications are expanded porphyrins. This work proves mechanical force to be an effective stimulus to trigger the interconversion between H&#252;ckel and M&#246;bius topologies in [28]hexaphyrin, making these expanded porphyrins suitable to act as conformational mechanophores operating at mild ( sub 1nN) force conditions. A straightforward approach based on distance matrices is proposed for the selection of pulling scenarios that promote either the most stable H&#252;ckel topology or the three lowest lying M&#246;bius topologies. This approach is supported by means of quantum mechanochemical calculations. Force distribution analyses reveal that [28]hexaphyrin selectively allocates the external mechanical energy to molecular regions that trigger H&#252;ckel&#8208;M&#246;bius interconversions, explaining why certain pulling scenarios favor the H&#252;ckel two&#8208;sided topology and others favor M&#246;bius single&#8208;sided topologies. The meso &#8208;substitution pattern on [28]hexaphyrin determines whether the energy difference between the different topologies can be overcome by mechanical activation.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A hitherto unexplored class of molecules for molecular force probe applications are expanded porphyrins. This work proves mechanical force to be an effective stimulus to trigger the interconversion between H&#252;ckel and M&#246;bius topologies in [28]hexaphyrin, making these expanded porphyrins suitable to act as conformational mechanophores operating at mild ( sub 1nN) force conditions. A straightforward approach based on distance matrices is proposed for the selection of pulling scenarios that promote either the most stable H&#252;ckel topology or the three lowest lying M&#246;bius topologies. This approach is supported by means of quantum mechanochemical calculations. Force distribution analyses reveal that [28]hexaphyrin selectively allocates the external mechanical energy to molecular regions that trigger H&#252;ckel&#8208;M&#246;bius interconversions, explaining why certain pulling scenarios favor the H&#252;ckel two&#8208;sided topology and others favor M&#246;bius single&#8208;sided topologies. The meso &#8208;substitution pattern on [28]hexaphyrin determines whether the energy difference between the different topologies can be overcome by mechanical activation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Partnering a three&#8208;coordinate gallium cation with a hydroborate counter&#8208;ion for the catalytic hydrosilylation of CO2</title>
      <dc:description>A novel &#946;&#8208;diketiminate stabilized gallium hydride, (DippL)Ga(Ad)H (where (DippL) = {HC(MeCDippN)2}, Dipp = 2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl and Ad = 1&#8208;adamantyl), has been synthesized and shown to undergo insertion of CO2&#160;into the Ga&#8208;H bond under mild conditions. In this case, treatment of the resulting &#954;1&#8208;formate complex with Et3SiH does not lead to regeneration of the hydride precursor. However, when combined with B(C6F5)3, (DippL)Ga(Ad)H catalyses the reductive hydrosilylation of CO2&#160;. Under stoichiometric conditions, the addition of one equivalent of B(C6F5)3&#160;to (DippL)Ga(Ad)H leads to the formation of a 3&#8208;coordinate cationic gallane complex, partnered with a hydroborate anion, [(DippL)Ga(Ad)][HB(C6F5)3]. This complex rapidly hydrometallates carbon dioxide and catalyses the selective reduction of CO2&#160;to the formaldehyde oxidation level in the presence of Et3SiH (yielding H2C(OSiEt3)2). When catalysis is undertaken in the presence of excess B(C6F5)3, appreciable enhancement in the activity of the system is observed, with a corresponding reduction in selectivity. While this system represents proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept in CO2&#160;hydrosilylation by a gallium hydride system, the TOF values obtained are relatively modest (max. 10 h&#8208;1). This is attributed to the strength of binding of the formatoborate anion to the Ga centre in the intermediate (DippL)Ga(Ad){HC(O)OB(C6F5)3}, and the correspondingly slow rate of the turnover&#8208;limiting hydrosilylation step. In turn, this strength of binding can be related to the relatively high Lewis acidity measured for the [(DippL)Ga(Ad)]+&#160;cation (AN = 69.8).</dc:description>

      <title>N,S&#8208;Codoped Porous Carbon Nanofiber Films Derived from Fullerenes (C60) as Efficient Electrocatalysts for Oxygen Reduction and Zn&#8208;Air Battery</title>
      <dc:description>Developing highly efficient metal&#8208;free electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) has attracted great attention for creation of electrochemical energy devices. In this study, one&#8208;dimensional (1D) fullerene nanofibers prepared from liquid&#8208;liquid interfacial precipitation were first fabricated into fullerene&#8208;derived carbon nanofiber films (FCNFs) via a simple filtration procedure, and then pyrolysis of FCNFs in the presence of ammonia and sulfur produced N&#8208; and S&#8208; co&#8208;doped porous carbon nanofiber films (N,S&#8208;PCNFs). As excellent metal&#8208;free electrocatalysts for ORR, N,S&#8208;PCNFs exhibit remarkable catalytic activity, superior stability and excellent methanol tolerance in both alkaline and acidic solution. Such a high ORR performance benefits from the robust porous nanofiber network structure with high concentrations of active N&#8208; and S&#8208; groups and abundant defects. Notably, when N,S&#8208;PCNFs are practically used as catalysts in a Zn&#8208;air battery, a high power density and a large operating voltage have been achieved, a performance comparable to that of the commercial Pt/C catalyst. This work presents a facile strategy for the creation of a new class of energy nanomaterials based on fullerenes, demonstrating their practical uses in electrocatalytic ORR processes and Zn&#8208;air batteries.</dc:description>

      <title>Construction of Hyaluronic Acid Covered Hierarchically Porous MIL&#8208;nanoMOF for Loading and Controlled Release of Doxorubicin</title>
      <dc:description>The porous nano&#8208;sized metal organic framework (nanoMOF) and its proper surface modification could greatly promote the drug loading capability and introduce biocompatibility, biodegradability, and targeting functions into nano&#8208;drug delivery systems. Herein, the HACD@ADA&#8208;PA/MIL&#8208;101_NH2 (Fe)&#8208;P nanoparticle was successfully fabricated through supramolecular and coordination interactions from three building blocks, including hierarchically porous MIL&#8208;101_NH2 (Fe)&#8208;P nanoMOF, phosphite modified adamantane (ADA&#8208;PA), and &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin modified hyaluronic acid (HACD). The obtained HACD@ADA&#8208;PA/MIL&#8208;101_NH2 (Fe)&#8208;P nanoparticle was nano&#8208;sized and highly stable in physiological fluids. Then, the porous structure of HACD@ADA&#8208;PA/MIL&#8208;101_NH2 (Fe)&#8208;P nanoparticle could effectively load commercial chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin (DOX) with encapsulation rate as 41.20% and loading rate as 48.84%. The obtained drug loaded HACD@ADA&#8208;PA/MIL&#8208;101_NH2 (Fe)&#8208;P@DOX nanoparticle was pH&#8208;sensitive and relatively stable at neutral condition (pH = 7.2), but could release DOX in controlled way at subacid solution at pH = 5.7. The simulated in vitroDOX release experiment signified that the HACD@ADA&#8208;PA/MIL&#8208;101_NH2 (Fe)&#8208;P@DOX nanoparticle could realize the controlled release of DOX in tumor issues.</dc:description>

      <title>Selective formation of polyaniline confined in the nanopores of a metal&#8211;organic framework for supercapacitors</title>
      <dc:description>In this study, a strategy that can result in the polyaniline (PANI) solely confined within the nanopores of a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) without forming obvious bulk PANI between MOF crystals is developed. A water&#8208;stable zirconium&#8208;based MOF, UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH  2  , is selected as the MOF material. The polymerization of aniline is initiated in the acidic suspension of UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH  2  nanocrystals in the presence of excess poly(sodium 4&#8208;styrenesulfonate) (PSS). Since the pore size of UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH  2  is too small to enable the insertion of the bulky PSS, the quick formation of pore&#8208;confined solid PANI and the slower formation of well dispersed PANI:PSS occur within the MOF crystals and in the bulk solution, respectively. By taking advantage of the resulting homogeneous PANI:PSS polymer solution, the bulk PANI:PSS can be removed from the PANI/UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH  2  solid by successive washing the sample with fresh acidic solutions through centrifugation. As this is the first time reporting the PANI solely confined in the pores of a MOF, as a demonstration, the obtained PANI/UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH  2  composite material is applied as the electrode material for supercapacitors. The PANI/UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH  2  thin films exhibit a pseudocapacitive electrochemical characteristic, and their resulting electrochemical activity and charge&#8208;storage capacities are remarkably higher than those of the bulk PANI thin films.</dc:description>

      <title>Inherent Impurities in Graphene/Polylactic Acid Filament Strongly Influence on the Capacitive Performance of 3D&#8208;Printed Electrode</title>
      <dc:description>
Positive impurities: Inherent impurities, TiO2 and Fe3O4 were found in commercial conductive graphene/PLA filaments used in the printing of 3D&#8208;electrodes by a fused deposition modeling technique. These additives contributed towards pseudocapacitive charge storage kinetics of the 3D&#8208;printed electrodes and dramatically enhanced the overall capacitance.







Abstract
Additive manufacturing or 3D&#8208;printing have become promising fabrication techniques in the field of electrochemical energy storage applications such as supercapacitors, and batteries. Of late, a commercially available graphene/polylactic acid (PLA) filament has been commonly used for Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) 3D&#8208;printing in the fabrication of electrodes for supercapacitors and Li&#8208;ion batteries. This graphene/PLA filament contains metal&#8208;based impurities such as titanium oxide and iron oxide. In this study, we show a strong influence of inherent impurities in the graphene/PLA filament for supercapacitor applications. A 3D&#8208;printed electrode is prepared and subsequently thermally activated for electrochemical measurement. A deep insight has been taken to look into the pseudocapacitive contribution from the metal&#8208;based impurities which significantly enhanced the overall capacitance of the 3D&#8208;printed graphene/PLA electrode. A systematic approach has been shown to remove the impurities from the printed electrodes. This has a broad implication on the interpretation of the capacitance of 3D&#8208;printed composites.

      <title>Structural Motifs of Alkali Metal Superbases in Non&#8208;coordinating Solvents</title>
      <dc:description>
Navigating in treacherous but treasure&#8208;laden seas where alkyllithium and potassium alkoxides were discovered by Lochmann and Schlosser mix. Little is known about the uncharted areas away from the well&#8208;known coastal regions of the starting materials. Many molecular vessels were precipitated and lost here.

Abstract
Lochmann&#8211;Schlosser superbases (LSB) are a standard reagent in synthetic chemistry to achieve an exchange of a proton on an organic framework with an alkali metal cation, which in turn can be replaced by a wide range of electrophilic groups. In standard examples, the deprotonating reagent consists of an equimolar mixture of n&#8208;butyllithium and potassium t&#8208;butoxide. However, the nature of the reactive species could not be pinned down either for this composition or for similar mixtures with comparable high reactivity. Despite the poor solubility and the fierce reactivity, some insights into this mixture were achieved by some indirect results, comparison with chemically related systems, or skillful deductions. Recent results, mainly based on new soluble compounds, delivered structural evidence. These new insights lead to advanced and more detailed conclusions about the interplay of the involved components.

      <title>Late&#8208;stage C(sp2)&#8208;H Functionalization: A Powerful Toolkit to Arm Natural Products for In Situ Proteome Profiling?</title>
      <dc:description>Comprehensive investigation of target interactions from native cellular environments is of paramount importance for natural products and related bioactive compounds in drug discovery and chemical biology. Current chemoproteomic tools such as in situ proteome profiling can do so effectively, but rely heavily on &#8220;tagged&#8217; probes accessible through traditional organic synthesis at a compound&#8217;s reactive sites required for target binding. Late&#8208;stage functionalization may resolve such limitations by &#8220;tagging&#8221; compounds in a single step at biologically inert C&#8208;H bonds. In this viewpoint, we summarize recent advancements in late&#8208;stage C(sp  2  )&#8208;H functionalization of (hetero)arenes, which are present in many natural products, followed by suggesting new toolkits for more wide&#8208;spread use of such strategies to install natural products with next&#8208;generation &#8220;minimalist&#8221; linkers for in situ proteome profiling.</dc:description>

      <title>A Simple Route to the Synthesis of Pt Nanobars and the Mechanistic Understanding of Symmetry Reduction</title>
      <dc:description>Noble&#8208;metal nanocrystals with anisotropic shapes have received increasing interest owing to their unique properties. Here we report a facile route to the preparation of Pt nanobars with aspect ratios tunable up to 2.1 by simply reducing a Pt  (IV)  precursor in  N,N  &#8208;dimethylformamide (DMF) at 160 &#176;C in the presence of poly (vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP). In addition to its commonly observed roles as a solvent and a reductant, DMF could also decompose to generate CO, a capping agent capable of selectively passivating Pt{100} facets to promote the formation of nanobars. The size and aspect ratio of the nanobars could be tuned by varying the amount of Pt  (IV)  precursor involved in the synthesis, as well as the concentration of PVP because of its dual roles as a stabilizer and a co&#8208;reductant. Our mechanistic study indicated that the anisotropic growth resulted from both particle coalescence and localized oxidative etching followed by preferential growth.</dc:description>

      <title>Bone Tissue Disorders:&#160;Healing Through Coordination Chemistry</title>
      <dc:description>Osteoporosis, Paget&#8217;s disease and osteosarcoma are a few examples of bone tissue disorders that affect millions of people worldwide. These conditions can strictly limit the lifestyle of patients and may even lead to their demise. To prevent this or, at least, try to manage the situation, there are several treatments available on the market. Notwithstanding, research has been driven by the possibility to improve the existing therapies, as well as to find new approaches that could better respond to these diseases.

In this review it is shown the path through which, in recent years, coordination compounds have been prepared and manufactured to be applied in the management of bone tissue disorders. Starting with the design and preparation of the coordination compounds with various dimensionalities, two approaches have been used: (1) they are prepared as three&#8208;dimensional cages that can act as delivery systems for therapeutic substances, or (2) they are constructed/prepared from compounds with intrinsic therapeutic properties. Following this, several strategies have been explored to manufacture the effective delivery to the patients. The versatility of coordination compounds has allowed their use in the preparation of drug tablets, coatings for titanium implants, or even scaffolds for bone tissue engineering. In the end, it becomes clear that these compounds can be a valuable approach to reach a better treatment for bone tissue disorders. Nonetheless, along the road, a few bumps have appeared concerning the therapeutic profile, such as the effect of the structural arrangement or particle size.</dc:description>

      <title>Enhanced electron transfer and ion transport by binary and multidimensional CuCo2S4/Fe2O3 on carbon cloth for water oxidation</title>
      <dc:description>The behavior of electron transfer and ion transport plays a significant role in the electrocatalytic activity. However, the improvement of CuCo  2  S  4  electrocatalytic activity has been a difficult problem lacking of effective electron transfer and ion transport. Herein, the unique structure connects CuCo  2  S  4  nanosheets and carbon cloth (CC) with Fe  2  O  3  nanoparticles to form CuCo  2  S  4  /Fe  2  O  3  /CC.

The electrochemical surface area of CuCo  2  S  4  /Fe  2  O  3  /CC is 2.76 times larger than that of CuCo  2  S  4  /CC due to the high double layer capacitance. For an oxygen evolution reaction, CuCo  2  S  4  /Fe  2  O  3  /CC can achieve an overpotential of 273 mV and a Tafel slope of 67 mV&#183;dec  &#8208;1  in alkaline solution.</dc:description>

      <title>A&#160;Fast, Green and General Route to Ketones from Amides and Organolithium Compounds under Aerobic Conditions: Synthetic and Mechanistic Aspects</title>
      <dc:description>We report that the nucleophilic acyl substitution reaction of aliphatic and (hetero)aromatic amides by organolithium reagents proceeds quickly (20 s reaction time), efficiently, and chemoselectively with a broad substrate scope in the environmentally responsible cyclopentyl methyl ether, at ambient temperature and under air, to provide ketones in up to 93% yield with an effective suppression of the notorious over&#8208;addition reaction. Detailed DFT calculations and NMR investigations support the experimental results. The described methodology was proven to be amenable to scale&#8208;up and recyclability protocols. Contrasting classical procedures carried out under inert atmospheres, this work lays the foundation for a profound paradigm shift of the reactivity of carboxylic acid amides with organolithiums, with ketones being straightforwardly obtained by simply combining the reagents under aerobic conditions and with no need of using previously modified or pre&#8208;activated amides, as recommended.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We report that the nucleophilic acyl substitution reaction of aliphatic and (hetero)aromatic amides by organolithium reagents proceeds quickly (20 s reaction time), efficiently, and chemoselectively with a broad substrate scope in the environmentally responsible cyclopentyl methyl ether, at ambient temperature and under air, to provide ketones in up to 93% yield with an effective suppression of the notorious over&#8208;addition reaction. Detailed DFT calculations and NMR investigations support the experimental results. The described methodology was proven to be amenable to scale&#8208;up and recyclability protocols. Contrasting classical procedures carried out under inert atmospheres, this work lays the foundation for a profound paradigm shift of the reactivity of carboxylic acid amides with organolithiums, with ketones being straightforwardly obtained by simply combining the reagents under aerobic conditions and with no need of using previously modified or pre&#8208;activated amides, as recommended.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Polyvalent transition&#8208;state analogues of sialyl substrates strongly inhibit bacterial sialidases.</title>
      <dc:description>Bacterial sialidases (SA) are validated drug targets expressed by common human pathogens such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Vibrio cholerae or Clostridium perfringens. Non&#8208;covalent inhibitors of bacterial SA capable of reaching the submicromolar level are rarely reported. We developed multi&#8208; and polyvalent compounds based on the transition state analogue 2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;2,3&#8208;didehydro&#8208;N&#8208;acetylneuraminic (DANA). Poly&#8208;DANA inhibits the catalytic activity of SA from S. pneumoniae (NanA) and the symbiotic microorganism B. thetaiotaomicron (BtSA) at the picomolar and low nanomolar levels when expressed in moles of molecules and of DANA, respectively. Each DANA grafted to the polymer surpasses the inhibitory potential of the monovalent analogue by more than four orders of magnitude, which represents the highest multivalent effect reported so far for an enzyme inhibition. The synergistic interaction was shown to operate in the catalytic domain exclusively, and not in the flanked carbohydrate&#8208;binding module (CBM). These results offers interesting perspectives for the multivalent inhibition of other SA families lacking a CBM, such as viral, parasitic or human SA..</dc:description>

      <title>Effect of gold(I) in the Room Temperature Phosphorescence of ethynylphenanthrene</title>
      <dc:description>The synthesis of two series of gold(I) complexes containing the general formulae PR  3  &#8208;Au&#8208;C&#8801;C&#8208;phenanthrene (PR  3  = PPh  3  (  1a  /  2a  ), PMe  3  (  1b  /  2b  ), PNaph  3  (  1c  /  2c  )) or (diphos)(Au&#8208;C&#8801;C&#8208;phenanthrene)  2  (diphos = 1,1&#8208;  bis  (diphenylphosphino)methane, dppm (  1d  /  2d  ); 1,4&#8208;  bis  (diphenylphosphino)butane, dppb (  1e  /  2e  )) have been synthesized. The two series differ on the position of the alkynyl substituent on the phenanthrene chromophore, being at the 9&#8208;position (9&#8208;ethynylphenanthrene) for the  L1  &#8208;series and at the 2&#8208;position (2&#8208;ethynylphenanthrene) for the  L2  &#8208;series. The compounds have been fully characterized by  1  H and  31  P NMR and IR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction resolution in the case of compounds  1a  ,  1e  ,  2a  , and  2c  .
The emissive properties of the uncoordinated ligands and corresponding complexes have been studied in solution and within organic matrixes of different polarity (PMMA and Zeonex). We have observed room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) for all gold(I) complexes while only fluorescence can be detected for the pure organic chromophore. In particular, the  L2  &#8208;series present better luminescent properties regarding intensity of emission, quantum yields and RTP effect. Additionally, while the inclusion of all the compounds in organic matrixes induces an enhancement of the observed RTP due to the decrease in non&#8208;radiative deactivation, only the  L2  &#8208;series completely supress fluorescence giving rise to pure phosphorescent materials.</dc:description>

      <title>Chemical and Genetic Studies on the Formation of Pyrrolones During the Biosynthesis of Cytochalasans</title>
      <dc:description>A key step during the biosynthesis of cytochalasans is a proposed Knoevenagel condensation to form the pyrrolone core, enabling the subsequent 4+2 cycloaddition reaction that results in the characteristic octahydroisoindolone motif of all cytochalasans. Here we investigate the role of the highly conserved alpha&#8208;beta &#8208;hydrolase enzymes PyiE and ORFZ during the biosynthesis of pyrichalasin H and the ACE1 metabolite respectively, using gene knockout and complementation techniques. Using synthetic aldehyde models we demonstrate that the Knoevenagel condensation proceeds spontaneously but results in the 1,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2H&#8208;pyrrol&#8208;2&#8208;one tautomer, rather than the required 1,5&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2H&#8208;pyrrol&#8208;2&#8208;one tautomer.

      <title>Evaluation of the DNA Alkylation Property of a Chlorambucil&#8208;Conjugated Cyclic Pyrrole&#8211;Imidazole Polyamide</title>
      <dc:description>Hairpin pyrrole&#8211;imidazole polyamides (hPIPs) and their chlorambucil (Chb) conjugates (hPIP&#8211;Chbs) can alkylate DNA in a sequence&#8208;specific manner, and have been studied as anticancer drugs. Here we conjugated Chb to a cyclic PIP (cPIP), which is known to have a higher binding affinity than the corresponding hPIP, and investigated the DNA alkylation properties of the cPIP&#8211;Chb using the optimized capillary electrophoresis method and conventional HPLC product analysis. cPIP&#8211;Chb conjugate  3  showed higher alkylation activity at its binding sites than did hPIP&#8211;Chb conjugates  1  and  2  . Subsequent HPLC analysis revealed that the alkylation site of conjugate  3  , which was identified by capillary electrophoresis, was reliable and that conjugate  3  alkylates the N3 position of adenine as do hPIP&#8211;Chbs. Moreover, conjugate  3  showed higher cytotoxicity against LNCaP prostate cancer cells than did conjugate  1  and cytotoxicity comparable to that of conjugate  2  . These results suggest that cPIP&#8211;Chbs could be novel DNA alkylating anticancer drugs.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Hairpin pyrrole&#8211;imidazole polyamides (hPIPs) and their chlorambucil (Chb) conjugates (hPIP&#8211;Chbs) can alkylate DNA in a sequence&#8208;specific manner, and have been studied as anticancer drugs. Here we conjugated Chb to a cyclic PIP (cPIP), which is known to have a higher binding affinity than the corresponding hPIP, and investigated the DNA alkylation properties of the cPIP&#8211;Chb using the optimized capillary electrophoresis method and conventional HPLC product analysis. cPIP&#8211;Chb conjugate  3  showed higher alkylation activity at its binding sites than did hPIP&#8211;Chb conjugates  1  and  2  .

      <title>Understanding the Deactivation Pathways of Iridium(III) Pyridine&#8208;Carboxiamide Catalysts for Formic Acid Dehydrogenation</title>
      <dc:description>The degradation pathways of highly active [Cp*Ir(&#954; 2 &#8208; N,N &#8208;R&#8208;pica)Cl] catalysts (pica = picolinamidate; 1 R = H, 2 R = Me) for formic acid (FA) dehydrogenation were investigated by NMR spectroscopy and DFT calculations. Under acidic conditions (1 eq. of HNO 3 ), 2 undergoes partial protonation of the amide moiety, inducing rapid &#954; 2 &#8208; N,N to &#954; 2 &#8208; N,O ligand isomerization. Consistently, DFT modelling on the simpler complex 1 showed that the &#954; 2 &#8208; N,N key intermediate of FA dehydrogenation ( I NH ), bearing a N&#8208;protonated pica, can easily transform into the &#954; 2 &#8208; N,O analogue ( I NH2 ; &#916; G # &#8776; 11 kcal/mol, &#916; G &#8776; &#8208;5 kcal/mol). Intramolecular hydrogen liberation from I NH2 is predicted to be rather prohibitive (&#916; G # &#8776; 26 kcal/mol, &#916; G &#8776; 23 kcal/mol), indicating that FA dehydrogenation should involve mostly &#954; 2 &#8208; N,N intermediates, at least at relatively high pH. Under FA dehydrogenation conditions, 2 was progressively consumed, and the vast majority of the Ir centers (58%) was eventually found in the form of Cp*&#8208;complexes with a pyridine&#8208;amine ligand. This likely derived from hydrogenation of the pyridine&#8208;carboxiamide via a hemiaminal intermediate, which could be also detected. Clear evidence for ligand hydrogenation being the main degradation pathway also for 1 was obtained, as further confirmed by spectroscopic and catalytic tests on the independently synthesized degradation product 1c . DFT calculations confirmed that this side reaction is kinetically and thermodynamically accessible.</dc:description>

      <title>Enzyme multifunctionality via control of substrate positioning within the catalytic cycle &#8208; a QM/MM study for clavaminic acid synthase</title>
      <dc:description>Clavaminate synthase from Streptomyces clavuligerus is an Fe(II)/2&#8208;oxoglutarate dependent dioxygenase, crucial for the biosynthesis of the &#946;&#8208;lactamase inhibitor clavulanic acid. It catalyses three consecutive oxidative reactions, i.e. hydroxylation, cyclisation and desaturation in a single binding cavity. As follows from the results of this QM/MM study, CAS versatility and selectivity depends on the binding cavity, which interplays differently with substrate for each reaction. The enzyme&#8208;substrate interactions affect the substrate&#8217;s ability to re&#8208;position during the reaction, either constraining it in its primary position, which impedes processes other than oxygen rebound, or allowing change, which facilitates double bond formation. This differential effect originates from two aspartate residues, which strongly interact with the guanidine group of the hydroxylation substrate and stabilise orientation of the molecule. These residues interact less effectively with a smaller amine group of the desaturation substrate(s), aiding their repositioning and subsequent formation of a double bond.</dc:description>

      <title>Core&#8208;modified coelenterazine luciferin analogues, synthesis and chemiluminescence properties</title>
      <dc:description>In our work on the design and studies of luciferins related to the blue&#8208;hued coelenterazine, we undertook the synthesis of heterocyclic analogues susceptible to produce a photon, possibly at a different wavelength. We describe here the synthesis of O&#8208;acetylated derivatives of imidazo[1,2&#8208;b]pyridazin&#8208;3(5H)&#8208;one, imidazo[2,1&#8208;f][1,2,4]triazin&#8208;7(1H)&#8208;one, imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridin&#8208;3&#8208;ol, imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]quinoxalin&#8208;1(5H)&#8208;one, benzo[f]imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]quinoxalin&#8208;3(11H)&#8208;one, imidazo[1',2':1,6]pyrazino[2,3&#8208;c]quinolin&#8208;3(11H)&#8208;one and 5,11&#8208;dihydro&#8208;3H&#8208;chromeno[4,3&#8208;e]imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyrazin&#8208;3&#8208;one thanks to an extensive use of the Buchwald&#8208;Hartwig N&#8208;arylation. The acidic hydrolysis of these derivatives then gave solutions of the corresponding luciferin analogues which we studied. Not too unexpectedly, even if these were &#8220;dressed&#8221; with substituents found in actual substrates of the nanoKAZ/NanoLuc luciferase, no bioluminescence was observed with these compounds. However, in a phosphate buffer, all produced a light signal, by chemiluminescence, with extensive variations in their respective intensity and this could be increased by adding a quaternary ammonium salt in the buffer. This aspect was actually instrumental to determine the emission spectra of many of these luciferin analogs.</dc:description>

We describe here the synthesis of O&#8208;acetylated derivatives of imidazo[1,2&#8208;b]pyridazin&#8208;3(5H)&#8208;one, imidazo[2,1&#8208;f][1,2,4]triazin&#8208;7(1H)&#8208;one, imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridin&#8208;3&#8208;ol, imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]quinoxalin&#8208;1(5H)&#8208;one, benzo[f]imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]quinoxalin&#8208;3(11H)&#8208;one, imidazo[1',2':1,6]pyrazino[2,3&#8208;c]quinolin&#8208;3(11H)&#8208;one and 5,11&#8208;dihydro&#8208;3H&#8208;chromeno[4,3&#8208;e]imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyrazin&#8208;3&#8208;one thanks to an extensive use of the Buchwald&#8208;Hartwig N&#8208;arylation. The acidic hydrolysis of these derivatives then gave solutions of the corresponding luciferin analogues which we studied. Not too unexpectedly, even if these were &#8220;dressed&#8221; with substituents found in actual substrates of the nanoKAZ/NanoLuc luciferase, no bioluminescence was observed with these compounds. However, in a phosphate buffer, all produced a light signal, by chemiluminescence, with extensive variations in their respective intensity and this could be increased by adding a quaternary ammonium salt in the buffer. This aspect was actually instrumental to determine the emission spectra of many of these luciferin analogs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>The Reactivity of Isomeric Nitrenium Lewis Acids with Phosphines, Carbenes and Phosphide</title>
      <dc:description>Alkylation of spiro[fluorene&#8208;9,3&#8217;&#8208;indazole] at N(1) and N(2) with t BuCl affords the nitrenium cations [C 6 H 4 N 2 ( t Bu)C(C 12 H 8 )][BF 4 ], 1 and 2 , respectively. Compound 1 converts to 2 over the temperature range 303&#8208;323 K, with a free energy barrier of 28 &#177; 5 kcal/mol. Reaction of 1 with PMe 3 afforded the N&#8208;bound phosphine adduct [C 6 H 4 N( t Bu)N(PMe 3 )C(C 12 H 8 )]BF 4 ] 3 . However, phosphines attack 2 at the para&#8208; carbon atom of the aryl group with concurrent cleavage of N(2)&#8208;C(1) bond and proton migration to C(1) affording [(R 3 P)C 6 H 3 NN( t Bu)CH(C 12 H 8 )][BF 4 ] (R = Me 4 , n Bu 5 ). Analogous reactions of 1 and 2 with the carbene SIMes prompt attack at the para&#8208; carbon with concurrent loss of H&#8226; affording the radical cation salts [(SIMes)C 6 H 3 N( t Bu)NC(C 12 H 8 )&#8226;][BF 4 ] 6 and [(SIMes)C 6 H 3 NN( t Bu)C(C 12 H 8 )&#8226;][BF 4 ] 7 , whereas reaction of 2 with BAC gives the Lewis acid&#8208;base adduct, [C 6 H 4 N(BAC)N( t Bu)C(C 12 H 8 )][BF 4 ] 8 . Finally, reactions of 1 and 2 with KPPh 2 result in electron transfer affording (PPh 2 ) 2 and the persistent radicals C 6 H 4 N( t Bu)NC(C 12 H 8 )&#8226; and C 6 H 4 NN( t Bu)C(C 12 H 8 )&#8226;. The detailed reaction mechanisms are also explored by extensive DFT calculations.</dc:description>

      <title>Sulfonated 2D Covalent Organic Frameworks for Efficient Proton Conduction</title>
      <dc:description>Open 1D channels found in covalent organic frameworks are unique and promising to serve as pathways for proton conduction; how to develop high&#8208;rate yet stable transporting systems remains a substantial challenge. Herein, we report a strategy for exploring proton&#8208;conducting frameworks by engineering pore walls and installing proton&#8208;containing polymers into the pores. Amide&#8208;linked and sulfonated frameworks were synthesized from imine&#8208;linked precursors via sequentially engineering to oxidize into amide linkages and to further anchor sulfonic acid groups onto the pore walls, enabling the creation of sulfonated frameworks with high crystallinity and channel ordering. Integrating sulfonated polyether ether ketone chains into the open channels enables proton hopping to across the channels, greatly increases proton conductivity and enables a stable continuous run. These results suggest a way to explore proton&#8208;conducting COFs via systematic engineering of wall and space of the open nanochannels.</dc:description>

      <title>Cyanine Dyes Containing Quinoline Moieties: History, Synthesis, Optical Properties and Applications</title>
      <dc:description>Cyanine dyes carrying quinoline moieties are an important class of organic molecules having a great interest and applications in many fields like medicine, pharmacology, and engineering. Despite their exceptional properties, such as stability, high molar extinction coefficients, and high pH&#8208;sensitivity, this class of dyes has been less analyzed and reviewed for the last decades. Therefore, this review article is focusing on discussing the history of quinoline compounds, various synthetic routes to prepare quinolinium salts and symmetrical and asymmetrical mono&#8208;, di&#8208;, tri&#8208;, penta&#8208; and heptamethine cyanine dyes, containing quinoline moieties, together with their optical properties and applications as photosensitizers in photodynamic therapy, probes in biomolecules labeling of nucleic acids, as well as imaging agents.</dc:description>
