Polyanion Ni 36 comprises six equivalent {Ni II 6 SiW 9 } units which are linked by Ni&#8208;O&#8208;W&#8217; bridges forming a macrocyclic assembly. Magnetic studies demonstrated that the {Ni 6 } building blocks in Ni 36 remain magnetically intact while forming a hexagonal ring with antiferromagnetic exchange interactions between adjacent {Ni 6 } units.

         <title>Osteosarcoma Stem Cell Potent Gallium(III)&#8208;Polypyridyl Complexes Bearing Diflunisal</title>

Breaking &#8216;hard&#8208;to&#8208;kill&#8217; bone cancer cells with gallium: Osteosarcoma stem cells (OSCs) are linked to the poor prognosis of metastasised osteosarcoma. Here a gallium(III)&#8208;polypyridyl complex is reported, containing the non&#8208;steroidal anti&#8208;inflammatory drug, diflunisal, capable of killing OSCs more effectively than frontline and secondary anti&#8208;osteosarcoma drugs. The complex evokes cell death by inhibiting cyclooxygenase&#8208;2 and damaging nuclear DNA.







Abstract
We report the anti&#8208;osteosarcoma stem cell (OSC) properties of a series of gallium(III)&#8208;polypyridyl complexes (5&#8208;7) containing diflunisal, a non&#8208;steroidal anti&#8208;inflammatory drug. The most effective complex within the series, 6 (containing 3,4,7,8&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;1,10&#8208;phenanthroline), displayed similar potency towards bulk osteosarcoma cells and OSCs, in the nanomolar range. Remarkably, 6 exhibited significantly higher monolayer and sarcosphere OSC potency (up to three orders of magnitude) than clinically approved drugs used in frontline (cisplatin and doxorubicin) and secondary (etoposide, ifosfamide, and carboplatin) osteosarcoma treatments. Mechanistic studies show that 6 downregulates cyclooxygenase&#8208;2 (COX&#8208;2) and kills osteosarcoma cells in a COX&#8208;2 dependent manner. Furthermore, 6 induces genomic DNA damage and caspase&#8208;dependent apoptosis. To the best of our knowledge, 6 is the first metal complex to kill osteosarcoma cells by simultaneously inhibiting COX&#8208;2 and damaging nuclear DNA.

         <title>Topological Transformation of Mg&#8208;Containing Layered Double Hydroxide Nanosheets for Efficient Photodriven CH4 Coupling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A heterostructural Co&#8208;doped MgO&#8208;based catalyst, MgCo&#8208;800, was synthesized by topological transformation of a MgCo&#8208;layered double hydroxide (MgCo&#8208;LDH) precursor. With its highly dispersed active sites and abundant interfaces, MgCo&#8208;800 enabled surface activation of CH4 to methyl species and showed remarkable photodriven CH4 coupling to C2H6 with a selectivity of 41.60&#8201;% within 3&#8197;h under full&#8208;spectrum irradiation.







Abstract
Direct conversion of methane (CH4) to fuels and other high value&#8208;added chemicals is an attractive technology in the chemical industry; however, practical challenges to sustainable processes remain. Herein, we report the preparation of a heterostructured Co&#8208;doped MgO&#8208;based catalyst through topological transformation of a MgCo&#8208;layered double hydroxide (LDH) calcination from 200 to 1100&#8201;&#176;C. Remarkably, the catalyst can activate CH4 coupling to produce C2H6 with a selectivity of 41.60&#8201;% within 3&#8197;h under full&#8208;spectrum irradiation through calcination of LDH at 800&#8201;&#176;C. Characterization studies and catalytic results suggest that the highly dispersed active sites and large interfaces amongst the Co&#8208;doped MgO&#8208;based catalysts enable surface activation of CH4 to methyl (CH3*), in turn promoting coupling of CH3* to C2H6. This study introduces a promising pathway for photodriven CH4 coupling to give high value&#8208;added chemicals by using layered double hydroxides as a precursor.

         <title>Phosphine&#8208;Stabilized Pnictinidenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Treating a germylene&#8208;phosphine Lewis pair, 1, with trichlorides of phosphorus, arsenic, and antimony allowed the isolation of oxidative addition products. Reduction of these compounds with sodium metal or LiBHEt3 led to the synthesis of a phosphinidene, an arsinidene and a stibinidene. After halide abstraction, a germaphosphene, 8, was isolated, and its 31P NMR data were analyzed by using quantum chemical calculations. The product of an Al&#8722;H addition was found upon treating the phosphinidene with [iBu2AlH]2.







Abstract
The reaction of the intramolecular germylene&#8208;phosphine Lewis pair (o&#8208;PPh2)C6H4GeAr* (1) with Group 15 element trichlorides ECl3 (E=P, As, Sb) was investigated. After oxidative addition, the resulting compounds (o&#8208;PPh2)C6H4(Ar*)Ge(Cl)ECl2 (2: E=P, 3: E=As, 4: E=Sb) were reduced by using sodium metal or LiHBEt3. The molecular structures of the phosphine&#8208;stabilized phosphinidene (o&#8208;PPh2)C6H4(Ar*)Ge(Cl)P (5), arsinidene (o&#8208;PPh2)C6H4(Ar*)Ge(Cl)As (6) and stibinidene (o&#8208;PPh2)C6H4(Ar*)Ge(Cl)Sb (7) are presented; they feature a two&#8208;coordinate low&#8208;valent Group 15 element. After chloride abstraction, a cyclic germaphosphene [(o&#8208;PPh2)C6H4(Ar*)GeP] [B(C6H3(CF3)2)4] (8) was isolated. The 31P NMR data of the germaphosphene were compared with literature examples and analyzed by quantum chemical calculations. The phosphinidene was treated with [iBu2AlH]2, and the product of an Al&#8722;H addition to the low&#8208;valent phosphorus atom (o&#8208;PPh2)C6H4(Ar*)Ge(H)P(H)Al(C4H9)2 (9) was characterized.

         <title>Electrocatalytic H2 Generation from Water Relying on Cooperative Ligand Electron Transfer in &#8220;PN3P&#8221; Pincer&#8208;Supported NiII Complexes</title>

         <dc:description>
Towards sustainable H2 production: To bring electrocatalytic hydrogen production into the sustainable realm, earth&#8208;abundant metal catalysts should function with water as the substrate. These newly reported hydrogen&#8208;generating catalysts of NiII are robust, stable in air and electrocatalytically reduce water to hydrogen with excellent Faradaic efficiency. Computations supplemented our understanding of a unique ligand&#8208;based electron transfer with the cooperativity of the PN3P ligand as an electron reservoir as a requirement for successful catalysis.







Abstract
Water is the most sustainable source for H2 production, and the efficient electrocatalytic production of H2 from mixed water/acetonitrile solutions by using two new air&#8208;stable nickel(II) pincer complexes, [Ni(&#954;3&#8208;2,6&#8208;{Ph2PNR}2(NC5H3)Br2] (R=H I, Me II) is reported. Hydrogen generation from H2O/CH3CN solutions is initiated at &#8722;2&#8197;V against Fc+/0, and bulk electrocatalysis studies showed that the catalyst functions with an excellent Faradaic efficiency and a turnover frequency of 160&#8197;s&#8722;1. A DFT computational investigation of the reduction behavior of I and II revealed a correlation of H2 formation with charge donation from electrons originating in a reduced ligand&#8208;localized orbital. As a result, these catalysts are proposed to proceed by a novel mechanism involving electron/proton transfer between a Ni0I species bonded to an anionic PN3P ligand (&#8220;L&#8722;/Ni0I&#8221;) and a NiI&#8208;hydride (&#8220;Ni&#8722;H&#8221;). Furthermore, these catalysts are able to reduce phenol and acetic acid, more active proton sources, at lower potentials that correlate with the substrate pKa.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Sensitive and Ultra&#8208;Stretchable Strain Sensors Based on Emulsion Gels with Broad Operating Temperature</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Taking the strain: An emulsion gel with high stretchability and conductivity was fabricated and could be used as a strain sensor to detect human motion over a broad operating temperature. First, an emulsion that was ultra&#8208;stable at high and low temperatures was prepared by introducing glycerol into a W/W emulsion. Then, the continuous phase was polymerized to produce a macroporous emulsion gel. Finally, an emulsion&#8208;gel&#8208;based strain sensor with good flexibility, conductivity, self&#8208;healing, and adhesion properties was fabricated to detect the full range of human body movement. The sensor exhibited remarkable sensing sensitivity, rapid responsiveness, and reliability. For more information, see the Full Paper by J. Hao et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101472).

         <title>Octapalladium Strings Trap C60 and C70 Fullerenes Affording Metal&#8208;Chain&#8208;Wired Bucky Balls</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cover picture shows octapalladium metal strings catching a soccer ball of C60 or C70 fullerene in the central Pd&#8211;Pd junction to give metal&#8208;chain&#8208;wired bucky balls. The enantiopure chiral Pd8 strings also afforded the chiral bucky balls through dimensionally and chirality controlled self&#8208;assembly. These findings could provide a new platform for developing functional metal&#8208;carbon nanocomposite materials, including nano&#8208;electronics with unusual properties derived from the combination of redox active fullerenes and metal chains. More information can be found in the Communication by T. Tanase et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202102020).

         <dc:description>Our understanding of the factors affecting the stability of cyclic  d  /  l  peptide (CP) nanotubes remains underdeveloped. In this work, we investigate the impact of side chain alignment, hydrophobicity and charge on CP nanotube stability through X&#8208;ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We characterise the distinct CP&#8208;CP alignments that can form and identify stable and unstable dimers by MD simulation. We measure H&#8208;bond half&#8208;lives of synthesised CPs by  1  H&#8208;D exchange experiments and find good correlation with predicted CP&#8208;CP stabilities. We find that hydrophobic amino acids improve CP dimer stability but experimentally reduce solubility. Charged amino acids either increase or decrease CP dimer stability depending on the relative orientation and composition of charged groups. X&#8208;ray crystal structures are solved for two CPs, revealing non&#8208;tubular folded conformations. Ultimately, this work will assist the educated design of stable tubular structures for potential applications in biomedicine.</dc:description>

         <title>Agile Detection of Chemical Warfare Agents by Machine Vision: a Supramolecular Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Smart(phone) recognition: A new fluorescent sensor able to interact noncovalently with DMMP, a CWA simulant, has been synthetized and tested both in solution and in the gas phase. The detection limit in solution is much lower than the toxicity values of CWAs; in the gas phase sensing can be performed on a simple smartphone. With acid/base treatment, the solid device can be reused. This prototype paves the way for the smart detection of nerve agents.







Abstract
The supramolecular detection by image analysis of a simulant chemical warfare agent on a solid device containing a selective molecular sensor based on a BODIPY scaffold is reported. The recognition properties were investigated in solution, demonstrating high affinity (log&#8201;K&#8197;6.60) and sensitivity (LOD 10&#8197;ppt). A test strip also confirmed the sensing properties in gas phase. Image analysis of the solid device allows quantitative information about the simulant to be obtained, recovering the sensor almost 5&#8197;times and thus confirming the goal of the supramolecular approach.

         <title>Novel Cofacial Porphyrin&#8208;Based Homo&#8208; and Heterotrimetallic Complexes of Transition Metals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synthesis route for cofacially linked homo&#8208; and heterotrimetallic trisporphyin complexes starting from pyrrole and benzaldehyde is presented in this work. Besides the novel aryl&#8208;based, trans&#8208;o&#8208;phenylene trisporphyrin, we investigated the respective cis&#8208;isomer as the first conformationally restricted planar&#8208;chiral trisporphyrin. The homotrimetallic Mn(III)&#8208;, Fe(III)&#8208;, Ni(II)&#8208;, Cu(II)&#8208;, Zn(II)&#8208; and Pd(II) complexes and the defined Ni(II)Fe(III)Ni(II) heterotrimetalic complex were synthesized, the metal ion insertion process studied and the resulting compounds investigated by e.&#8201;g. UV&#8208;Vis, photoluminescence or high&#8208;resolution IMS measurements.







Abstract
We present a straightforward and generally applicable synthesis route for cofacially linked homo&#8208; and heterotrimetallic trisporphyin complexes. The protocol encompasses synthesising the first aryl&#8208;based, trans&#8208;o&#8208;phenylene trisporphyrin starting from pyrrole and benzaldehyde with an overall yield of 3.6&#8201;%. It also allows investigating the respective cis&#8208;isomer as the first conformationally restricted planar&#8208;chiral trisporphyrin. The free&#8208;base ligand was used in subsequent metalation reactions to afford the corresponding homotrimetallic Mn(III)&#8208;, Fe(III)&#8208;, Ni(II)&#8208;, Cu(II)&#8208;, Zn(II)&#8208; and Pd(II) complexes &#8211; additionally, a small adaptation of the protocol resulted in the defined Ni(II)Fe(III)Ni(II) complex in a total yield of 2.3&#8201;%. By monitoring Ni(II) insertion into the empty trimeric ligands, we affirmed that the outer porphyrin rings are filled before the internal ring. The molecular species were characterised by 1H NMR, UV&#8208;Vis, photoluminescence, IR, MS, CID, and high&#8208;resolution IMS measurements.

         <title>Syntheses, Structures, Reactivities, and Basicities of Quinolinyl and Isoquinolinyl Complexes of an Electron Rich Chiral Rhenium Fragment and Their Electrophilic Addition Products</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The title complexes exhibit much higher basicities than the parent heterocycles, undergo facile N&#8208;methylation followed by diastereselective nucleophile additions, and can serve as nucleophilic catalysts. These attributes are interpreted with the aid of crystal structures and DFT calculations.







Abstract
Reactions of Li+ [(&#951;5&#8208;C5H5)Re(NO)(PPh3)]&#8722; with 2&#8208; and 4&#8208;chloroquinoline or 1&#8208;chloroisoquinoline give the corresponding &#963; quinolinyl and isoquinolinyl complexes 3, 6, and 8. With 3 and 8 there is further protonation to yield HCl adducts, but additions of KH give the free bases. Treatment of 3 with HBF4&#8901;OEt2 or H(OEt2)2+ BArf&#8722; gives the quinolinium salts [(&#951;5&#8208;C5H5)Re(NO)(PPh3)(C(NH)C(CH)4C(CH)(CH))]+ X&#8722; (3&#8208;H+ X&#8722;; X&#8722;=BF4&#8722;/BArf&#8722;, 94&#8211;98&#8201;%). Addition of CF3SO3CH3 to 3, 6, or 8 affords the corresponding N&#8208;methyl quinolinium salts. In the case of [(&#951;5&#8208;C5H5)Re(NO)(PPh3)(C(NCH3)C(CH)4C(CH)(CH))]+ CF3SO3&#8722; (3&#8208;CH3+ CF3SO3&#8722;), addition of CH3Li gives the dihydroquinolinium complex (SReRC,RReSC)&#8208;[(&#951;5&#8208;C5H5)Re(NO)(PPh3)(C(NCH3)C(CH)4C(CHCH3)(CH2))]+ CF3SO3&#8722; ((SReRC,RReSC)&#8208;5+ CF3SO3&#8722;, 76&#8201;%) in diastereomerically pure form. Crystal structures of 3&#8208;H+ BArf&#8722;, 3&#8208;CH3+ CF3SO3&#8722;, (SReRC, RReSC)&#8208;5+ Cl&#8722;, and 6&#8208;CH3+ CF3SO3&#8722; show that the quinolinium ligands adopt Re&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;C conformations that maximize overlap of their acceptor orbitals with the rhenium fragment HOMO, minimize steric interactions with the bulky PPh3 ligand, and promote various &#960; interactions. NMR experiments establish the Br&#248;nsted basicity order 3&gt;8&gt;6, with Ka(BH+) values &gt;10 orders of magnitude greater than the parent heterocycles, although they remain less active nucleophilic catalysts in the reactions tested. DFT calculations provide additional insights regarding Re&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;C bonding and conformations, basicities, and the stereochemistry of CH3Li addition.

         <title>Saddle&#8208;Shaped Building Blocks: A New Concept for Designing Fully Conjugated 3D Organic Semiconducting Materials</title>

Semiconductor design: Cyclooctatetraene (COT) and its derivatives are &#960;&#8208;conjugated with saddle&#8208;shaped 3D architecture. They would be candidate as building blocks for constructing fully conjugated 3D materials that can facilitate the electron layer&#8208;layer delocalization and transport. We highlight recent conceptual progresses on the design and properties of fully &#960;&#8208;conjugated 3D organic semiconducting materials based on the COT derivatives, which could give inspiration for designing next generation organic semiconductors.







Abstract
Currently, most organic semiconducting materials (OSMs) are &#960;&#8208;conjugated structures in one or two dimension (2D), where the lack of layer&#8208;layer &#960;&#8208;conjugation connection greatly blocks their electron delocalization and transport. The 3D fully conjugated materials could solve this issue because they can provide efficient charge&#8208;transport pathways throughout the whole 3D skeleton, in which the suitable 3D building block is the key to the development of fully conjugated 3D OSMs. Cyclooctatetraene (COT) and its derivatives are good candidates due to their &#960;&#8208;conjugation with 3D saddle&#8208;shaped architecture. In this Concept, we discuss the key features of saddle&#8208;shaped COT&#8208;based derivatives and their synthetic strategy, then we present the current development of using the COT derivatives as building blocks to construct the 3D fully conjugated organic small compound&#8208; and polymer&#8208;based OSMs. The properties and perspectives of these OSMs in photovoltaics, electro&#8208;catalysis and electrical conductivities are also discussed. These recent advances in the developing 3D fully conjugated materials could potentially open up a new frontier in the design of OSMs.

         <title>Cell&#8208;Penetrating Mitochondrion&#8208;Targeting Ligands for the Universal Delivery of Small Molecules, Proteins and Nanomaterials</title>

Paving the way for future targeted therapy with a variety of biological agents. Cell&#8208;penetrating mitochondrion&#8208;targeting ligands are capable of universal mitochondrial delivery of small molecules, proteins and nanomaterials. Upon successful cellular delivery and rapid endosome escape, the released native cargos were found to be predominantly localized inside mitochondria. The successful delivery of doxorubicin (a well&#8208;known anticancer drug) showed that the released drug possessed potent cell cytotoxicity, disrupted mitochondrial membrane potential and finally led to apoptosis.







Abstract
Mitochondria are key organelles that perform vital cellular functions such as those related to cell survival and death. The targeted delivery of different types of cargos to mitochondria is a well&#8208;established strategy to study mitochondrial biology and diseases. Of the various existing mitochondrion&#8208;transporting vehicles, most suffer from poor cytosolic entry, low delivery efficiency, limited cargo types, and cumbersome preparation protocols, and none was known to be universally applicable for mitochondrial delivery of different types of cargos (small molecules, proteins, and nanomaterials). Herein, two new cell&#8208;penetrating, mitochondrion&#8208;targeting ligands (named MitoLigand) that are capable of effectively &#8220;tagging&#8221; small&#8208;molecule drugs, native proteins and nanomaterials are disclosed, as well as their corresponding chemoselective conjugation chemistry. Upon successful cellular delivery and rapid endosome escape, the released native cargos were found to be predominantly localized inside mitochondria. Finally, by successfully delivering doxorubicin, a well&#8208;known anticancer drug, to the mitochondria of HeLa cells, we showed that the released drug possessed potent cell cytotoxicity, disrupted the mitochondrial membrane potential and finally led to apoptosis. Our strategy thus paves the way for future mitochondrion&#8208;targeted therapy with a variety of biologically active agents.

         <title>RNA Ligation for Mono and Dually Labeled RNAs</title>

Labeling of long RNAs, protein&#8208;coding RNAs in particular, still poses a challenge. We developed new adenosine 3&#8217;,5&#8217;&#8208;bisphophate analogues as reagents for RNA 3&#8217;&#8208;end labeling by T4 RNA ligase. The compounds were efficient T4 substrates yielding 3&#8217;&#8208;mono&#8208;labeled RNAs with various 5&#8217;&#8208;ends (triphosphate, NAD). Combination of 3&#8217;&#8208; and 5&#8217;&#8208;end labeling yielded dually labeled m7G&#8208;capped RNAs that enabled quantitative analysis of decapping and were translationally active. The proposed method enables the creation of versatile probes for investigation of RNA function and localization.







Abstract
Labeled RNAs are invaluable probes for investigation of RNA function and localization. However, mRNA labeling remains challenging. Here, we developed an improved method for 3&#8242;&#8208;end labeling of in&#8197;vitro transcribed RNAs. We synthesized novel adenosine 3&#8242;,5&#8242;&#8208;bisphosphate analogues modified at the N6 or C2 position of adenosine with an azide&#8208;containing linker, fluorescent label, or biotin and assessed these constructs as substrates for RNA labeling directly by T4 ligase or via postenzymatic strain&#8208;promoted alkyne&#8208;azide cycloaddition (SPAAC). All analogues were substrates for T4 RNA ligase. Analogues containing bulky fluorescent labels or biotin showed better overall labeling yields than postenzymatic SPAAC. We successfully labeled uncapped RNAs, NAD&#8208;capped RNAs, and 5&#8242;&#8208;fluorescently labeled m7Gp3Am&#8208;capped mRNAs. The obtained highly homogenous dually labeled mRNA was translationally active and enabled fluorescence&#8208;based monitoring of decapping. This method will facilitate the use of various functionalized mRNA&#8208;based probes.

         <title>Promotion of Proton Conductivity by Encapsulation of Metal&#8208;Organic Polyhedra in Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>

Protons get a move on: A Zr&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic polyhedron (MOP&#8208;1) was self&#8208;assembled in a porous MOF host, DUT&#8208;68, to synthesize MOP&#8208;1@DUT&#8208;68. The migration and leaching of MOP could be effectively prohibited if MOP&#8208;1 was encapsulated in the MOF&#8242;s cavities. Incorporation of MOP&#8208;1 makes the proton conductivity of MOP&#8208;1@DUT&#8208;68 reach 1.14&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 (at 80&#8201;&#176;C under 98&#8201;% RH), which is three orders of magnitude higher than that of DUT&#8208;68.







Abstract
A Zr&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic polyhedron (MOP) was self&#8208;assembled in a porous MOF host, DUT&#8208;68, successfully to synthesize MOP&#8208;1@DUT&#8208;68. The MOP guest (MOP&#8208;1) has a diameter of about 20&#8197;&#197;, larger than that of the square windows (pore sizes of &#8764;14&#8197;&#197;) of DUT&#8208;68 but smaller than that of the rhombicuboctahedral cage (27.7&#8197;&#197;), which means that the migration and leaching of MOP&#8208;1 could be effectively prohibited if MOP&#8208;1 is encapsulated in the MOF&#8242;s cavities. The proton conductivity of MOP&#8208;1@DUT&#8208;68 is 1.14&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 (at 80&#8201;&#176;C under 98&#8201;% relative humidity), which is three orders of magnitude higher than that of DUT&#8208;68. Compared with MOP&#8208;1&#8834;DUT&#8208;68, which was synthesized by impregnation, MOP&#8208;1@DUT&#8208;68 is more prone to form faster proton&#8208;conduction pathways and thus provides higher proton conductivity.

         <title>Taming the Antiferromagnetic Beast: Computational Design of Ultrashort Mn&#8722;Mn Bonds Stabilized by N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes</title>

The Mn2 survival guide. DFT calculations were used to design synthetically achievable compounds featuring ultrashort Mn&#8722;Mn bonds stabilized by N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs). We investigated the nature of the metal&#8211;carbene interaction and the role of the ancillary &#951;6 coordination in the generation of ultrashort Mn2 bonds in organometallic platforms featuring closed&#8208;shell singlet multiplicities and positive adiabatic singlet&#8211;triplet gaps. Our analysis identified two classes of potential synthetic targets, whose electrostructural properties were thoroughly examined.







Abstract
The development of complexes featuring low&#8208;valent, multiply bonded metal centers is an exciting field with several potential applications. In this work, we describe the design principles and extensive computational investigation of new organometallic platforms featuring the elusive manganese&#8208;manganese bond stabilized by experimentally realized N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs). By using DFT computations benchmarked against multireference calculations, as well as MO&#8208; and VB&#8208;based bonding analyses, we could disentangle the various electronic and structural effects contributing to the thermodynamic and kinetic stability, as well as the experimental feasibility, of the systems. In particular, we explored the nature of the metal&#8208;carbene interaction and the role of the ancillary &#951;6 coordination to the generation of Mn2 systems featuring ultrashort metal&#8208;metal bonds, closed&#8208;shell singlet multiplicities, and positive adiabatic singlet&#8208;triplet gaps. Our analysis identifies two distinct classes of viable synthetic targets, whose electrostructural properties are thoroughly investigated.

Persistent silolyl and germolyl radicals were synthesized by reduction of sterically congested halide precursors. The radicals are pyramidalized and show only little spin delocalization.







Abstract
The synthesis of persistent sila&#8208; and germacyclopentadienyl (silolyl&#8208; and germolyl&#8208;) radicals by careful stoichiometric reduction of the corresponding halides with potassium is reported. The radicals were characterized by EPR spectroscopy and trapping reactions. The reduction of tris(trimethylsilyl)silyl&#8208;substituted halides was successful while smaller substituents (i.&#8201;e., t&#8208;Butyl, Ph) gave the corresponding dimers. The EPR spectroscopic parameter of the synthesized tetrolyl radicals indicate only small spin delocalization to the butadiene unit due to cross&#8208;hyperconjugation. Silolyl&#8208; and germolyl anions are unavoidable byproducts and are isolated in the form of their potassium salts and characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography. The comparison of the molecular structures of two closely related potassium silolides provided an example for different coordination of the potassium cation to the silolyl anion (&#951;1 vs. &#951;5 coordination) that triggers the switch between delocalized and localized states.

         <title>Electrochemical Evaluation of Diketopyrrolopyrrole Derivatives for Nonaqueous Redox Flow Batteries</title>

Blown out of the water: TDPP&#8208;Hex&#8208;CN4, a diketopyrrolopyrrole derivative, was used as anolyte in an all&#8208;organic nonaqueous redox flow battery. Flow cells were assembled with unisol blue and DBBB as catholytes. Both were stable for up to 100 cycles, retaining above &#8764;70&#8201;% capacity. Symmetric flow&#8208;cell and UV&#8208;visible spectroscopy studies of anolyte and both catholytes suggest that TDPP&#8208;Hex&#8208;CN4 is a stable anolyte, and the observed loss in capacity can be attributed to the unstable nature the of catholytes.







Abstract
Redox flow batteries (RFBs) employing nonaqueous electrolytes could potentially operate at much higher cell voltages, and therefore afford higher energy and power densities, than RFBs employing aqueous electrolytes. The development of such high&#8208;voltage nonaqueous RFBs requires anolytes that are electrochemically stable, especially in the presence of traces of oxygen and/or moisture. The inherent atmospheric reactivity of anolytes mandates judicious molecular design with high electron affinity and electrochemical stability. In this study, diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP)&#8208;based TDPP&#8208;Hex&#8208;CN4 is proposed as a stable redox&#8208;active molecule for anolytes in nonaqueous organic RFBs. We demonstrate organic RFBs using TDPP&#8208;Hex&#8208;CN4 as anolyte with unisol blue (UB) 1,4&#8208;bis(isopropylamino)anthraquinone and 1,4&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;2,5&#8208;bis(2&#8208;methoxyethoxy)benzene (DBBB) as catholytes. Cyclic voltammetry measurements with scans repeated over 200 cycles were performed to establish the electrochemical stability of the redox pairs. Symmetric flow&#8208;cell studies show that TDPP&#8208;Hex&#8208;CN4 exhibits stable capacity up to 700 cycles. Redox flow cells employing TDPP&#8208;Hex&#8208;CN4 /UB and TDPP&#8208;Hex&#8208;CN4/DBBB as redox pairs demonstrate that DPP derivatives are propitious materials for anolytes in all organic nonaqueous RFBs.

         <title>Fine Tunable, Redox Active Octapalladium Chains Supported by Linear Tetraphosphines, Leading to Dynamically 1D Self&#8208;Assembled Coordination Polymers</title>

Fine tunable Pd8 chains supported by linear tetraphosphine (meso&#8208;dpmppm), [Pd8(meso&#8208;dpmppm)4(L)2]4+ (L=none (1), solvent (2), RNC (3)) and [Pd8(meso&#8208;dpmppm)4(X)2]2+ (X&#8722;=(pseudo)halide (4)) were systematically synthesized and exhibited wide range redox behaviors from {Pd4}4+ to {Pd4}0 through {Pd8}4+, {Pd8}3+, and {Pd8}2+ strings and led by treatment with bisisocyanide (BI) in CH3CN to dynamical 1D assembly of {[Pd8(meso&#8208;dpmppm)4(BI)](BF4)4}n.







Abstract
A series of the octapalladium chains supported by meso&#8208;Ph2PCH2P(Ph)CH2P(Ph)CH2PPh2 (meso&#8208;dpmppm) ligands, [Pd8(meso&#8208;dpmppm)4(L)2](BF4)4 (L=none (1), solvents: CH3CN (2&#8201;a), dmf (2&#8201;b), dmso (2&#8201;c), RN&#8801;C: R=Xyl (3&#8201;a), Mes (3&#8201;b), Dip (3&#8201;c), tBu (3&#8201;d), Cy (3&#8201;e), CH3(CH2)7 (3&#8201;f), CH3(CH2)11 (3&#8201;g), CH3(CH2)17 (3&#8201;h)) and [Pd8(meso&#8208;dpmppm)4(X)2](BF4)2 (X=Cl (4&#8201;a), N3 (4&#8201;b), CN (4&#8201;c), SCN (4&#8201;d)), were synthesized by using 2&#8201;a as a stable good precursor, and characterized by spectroscopic (IR, 1H and 31P&#8197;NMR, UV&#8208;vis&#8208;NIR, ESI&#8208;MS) measurements and X&#8208;ray crystallographic analyses (for 1, 2&#8201;a,&#8201;b, 3&#8201;a,&#8201;b,&#8201;e,&#8201;f, 4&#8201;a&#8211;d). On the basis of DFT calculations on the X&#8208;ray determined structure of 2&#8201;b ([2b&#8208;Pd8]4+) and the optimized models [Pd8(meso&#8208;Ph2PCH2P(H)CH2P(H)CH2PH2)4(CH3CN)2]4+ ([Pd8Ph8]4+) and [Pd8(meso&#8208;H2PCH2P(H)CH2P(H)CH2PH2)4(CH3CN)2]4+ ([Pd8H8]4+), with and without empirically calculating dispersion force stabilization energy (B3LYP&#8208;D3, B3LYP), the formation energy between the two Pd4 fragments is assumed to involve mainly noncovalent interactions (ca. &#8722;70&#8197;kcal/mol) with four sets of interligand C&#8722;H/&#960; interactions and Pd&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Pd metallophilic one, while electron shared covalent interactions are almost canceled out within the Pd8 chain. All the compounds isolated are stable in solution and exhibit characteristic absorption at &#8764;900&#8197;nm, which is assignable to a spin allowed HOMO to LUMO transition, and shows temperature dependent intensity change with variable absorption coefficients presumably due to coupling with some thermal vibrations. The structures and electronic states of the Pd8 chains are found finely tunable by varying the terminal capping ligands. In particular, theoretical calculations elucidated that the HOMO&#8208;LUMO energy gap is systematically related to the central Pd&#8722;Pd distance (2.7319(6)&#8211;2.7575(6)&#8197;&#197;) by two ways with neutral ligands L (1, 2, 3) and with anionic ligands X (4), which are reflected on the NIR absorption energy of 867&#8211;954&#8197;nm. The isocyanide terminated Pd8 complexes (3) further reacted with excess of RNC (6 eq) to afford the Pd4 complexes, [Pd4(meso&#8208;dpmppm)2(RNC)2](BF4)2 (13), and the cyclic voltammograms of 2&#8201;a (L=CH3CN), 3, and 13 (R=Xyl, Mes, tBu, Cy) demonstrated wide range redox behaviors from 2{Pd4}4+ to 2{Pd4}0 through 2{Pd4}2+&#8596;{Pd8}4+, {Pd8}3+, and {Pd8}2+ strings. The oxidized complexes, [Pd4(meso&#8208;dpmppm)2(RNC)3](BF4)4 (16), were characterized by X&#8208;ray analyses, and the two&#8208;electron reduced chain of [Pd8(meso&#8208;dpmppm)4](BF4)2 (7) was analyzed by spectroscopic and electrochemical techniques and DFT calculations. Reactions of 2&#8201;a with 1&#8197;equiv. of aromatic linear bisisocyanide (BI) in CH2Cl2 deposited insoluble coordination polymers, {[Pd8(meso&#8208;dpmppm)4(BI)](BF4)4}n (5), and interestingly, they were soluble in acetonitrile, 31P{1H} and 1H&#8197;DOSY NMR spectra as well as SAXS curves suggesting that the coordination polymers may exist in acetonitrile as dynamically 1D self&#8208;assembled coordination polymers comprising ca. 50&#8197;units of the Pd8 rod averaged within the timescale.

&lt;/b&gt;), with and without empirically calculating dispersion force stabilization energy (B3LYP-D3, B3LYP), the formation energy between the two Pd&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; fragments is assumed to involve mainly noncovalent interactions (ca. &#8722;70&#8197;kcal/mol) with four sets of interligand C&#8722;H/&#960; interactions and Pd&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Pd metallophilic one, while electron shared covalent interactions are almost canceled out within the Pd&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; chain. All the compounds isolated are stable in solution and exhibit characteristic absorption at &#8764;900&#8197;nm, which is assignable to a spin allowed HOMO to LUMO transition, and shows temperature dependent intensity change with variable absorption coefficients presumably due to coupling with some thermal vibrations. The structures and electronic states of the Pd&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; chains are found finely tunable by varying the terminal capping ligands. In particular, theoretical calculations elucidated that the HOMO-LUMO energy gap is systematically related to the central Pd&#8722;Pd distance (2.7319(6)&#8211;2.7575(6)&#8197;&#197;) by two ways with neutral ligands L (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;) and with anionic ligands X (&lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;), which are reflected on the NIR absorption energy of 867&#8211;954&#8197;nm. The isocyanide terminated Pd&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; complexes (&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;) further reacted with excess of RNC (6 eq) to afford the Pd&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; complexes, [Pd&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(&lt;i&gt;meso&lt;/i&gt;-dpmppm)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(RNC)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;](BF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;13&lt;/b&gt;), and the cyclic voltammograms of &lt;b&gt;2&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt; (L=CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CN), &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;13&lt;/b&gt; (R=Xyl, Mes, &lt;sup&gt;

         <title>Heterodinuclear Zn(II), Mg(II) or Co(III) with Na(I) Catalysts for Carbon Dioxide and Cyclohexene Oxide Ring Opening Copolymerizations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 47, Page 12224-12231, August 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of heterodinuclear M/Na catalysts for cyclohexene oxide and carbon dioxide copolymerization are reported. The best catalyst comprises Co(III)/Na(I), coordinated by the macrocyclic ligand, and showing activity and selectivity values at the upper end of reported values for 1&#8197;bar carbon dioxide pressure copolymerizations. These catalysts operated without co&#8208;catalyst and maintain high activity at low loadings.







Abstract
A series heterodinuclear catalysts, operating without co&#8208;catalyst, show good performances for the ring opening copolymerization (ROCOP) of cyclohexene oxide and carbon dioxide. The complexes feature a macrocyclic ligand designed to coordinate metals such as Zn(II), Mg(II) or Co(III), in a Schiff base &#8216;pocket&#8217;, and Na(I) in a modified crown&#8208;ether binding &#8216;pocket&#8217;. The 11 new catalysts are used to explore the influences of the metal combinations and ligand backbones over catalytic activity and selectivity. The highest performance catalyst features the Co(III)Na(I) combination, [N,N&#8242;&#8208;bis(3,3&#8217;&#8208;triethylene glycol salicylidene)&#8208;1,2&#8208;ethylenediamino cobalt(III) di(acetate)]sodium (7), and it shows both excellent activity and selectivity at 1&#8197;bar carbon dioxide pressure (TOF=1590&#8197;h&#8722;1, &gt;99&#8201;% polymer selectivity, 1&#8201;:&#8201;10: 4000, 100&#8201;&#176;C), as well as high activity at higher carbon dioxide pressure (TOF=4343&#8197;h&#8722;1, 20&#8197;bar, 1&#8201;:&#8201;10&#8201;:&#8201;25000). Its rate law shows a first order dependence on both catalyst and cyclohexene oxide concentrations and a zeroth order for carbon dioxide pressure, over the range 10&#8211;40&#8197;bar. These new catalysts eliminate any need for ionic or Lewis base co&#8208;catalyst and instead exploit the coordination of earth&#8208;abundant and inexpensive Na(I) adjacent to a second metal to deliver efficient catalysis. They highlight the potential for well&#8208;designed ancillary ligands and inexpensive Group 1 metals to deliver high performance heterodinuclear catalysts for carbon dioxide copolymerizations and, in future, these catalysts may also show promise in other alternating copolymerization and carbon dioxide utilizations.

         <title>Structure Elucidation and Spectroscopic Analysis of Chromophores Produced by Oxidative Psilocin Dimerization</title>

Self&#8208;made color frenzy: Psilocin oxidation causes the iconic blueing of Psilocybe &#8220;magic&#8221; mushrooms. To prevent oligomerization, but allow for dimerization, 5&#8208; and 7&#8208;methylated psilocin monomers were synthesized. Chemical oxidation enabled spectroscopic chromophore investigation of the dimeric gateway compounds and comparison to computationally derived absorption spectra. The 7,7&#8217;&#8208;coupled quinoid psilocyl dimer was identified as major initial blue product, while the 5,5&#8217;&#8208;coupled dimer contributes a greenish tint.







Abstract
Psilocin (1) is the dephosphorylated and psychotropic metabolite of the mushroom natural product psilocybin. Oxidation of the phenolic hydroxy group at the C&#8208;4 position of 1 results in formation of oligomeric indoloquinoid chromophores responsible for the iconic blueing of bruised psilocybin&#8208;producing mushrooms. Based on previous NMR experiments, the hypothesis included that the 5,5&#8217;&#8208;coupled quinone dimer of 1 was the primary product responsible for the blue color. To test this hypothesis, ring&#8208;methylated 1 derivatives were synthesized to provide stable analogs of 1 dimers that could be completely characterized. The chemically oxidized derivatives were spectroscopically analyzed and compared to computationally derived absorbance spectra. Experimental evidence did not support the original hypothesis. Rather, the blue color was shown to stem from the quinoid 7,7&#8217;&#8208;coupled dimer of 1.

Three&#8208;legged race: The efficient synthesis, optical and electrochemical properties of a series of 2,6&#8208;disubstituted naphthalene&#8208;1,4,5,8&#8208;tetracarboxdiimides (NDIs) mounted on a tripodal platform are reported. Moreover, their surface behaviour after spraying on Au(111) was studied. In a STML setup, such NDI tripods show electroluminescence photon spectra with high electroluminescence yields and thus demonstrate their potential for optoelectronic devices.







Abstract
This paper reports the efficient synthesis, absorption and emission spectra, and the electrochemical properties of a series of 2,6&#8208;disubstituted naphthalene&#8208;1,4,5,8&#8208;tetracarboxdiimide (NDI) tripodal molecules with thioacetate anchors for their surface investigations. Our studies showed that, in particular, the pyrrolidinyl group with its strong electron&#8208;donating properties enhanced the fluorescence of such core&#8208;substituted NDI chromophores and caused a significant bathochromic shift in the absorption spectrum with a correspondingly narrowed bandgap of 1.94&#8197;eV. Cyclic voltammetry showed the redox properties of NDIs to be influenced by core substituents. The strong electron&#8208;donating character of pyrrolidine substituents results in rather high HOMO and LUMO levels of &#8208;5.31 and &#8208;3.37 eV when compared with the parental unsubstituted NDI. UHV&#8208;STM measurements of a sub&#8208;monolayer of the rigid tripodal NDI chromophores spray deposited on Au(111) show that these molecules mainly tend to adsorb flat in a pairwise fashion on the surface and form unordered films. However, the STML experiments also revealed a few molecular clusters, which might consist of upright oriented molecules protruding from the molecular island and show electroluminescence photon spectra with high electroluminescence yields of up to 6&#215;10&#8722;3. These results demonstrate the promising potential of the NDI tripodal chromophores for the fabrication of molecular devices profiting from optical features of the molecular layer.

Inclusion complex of a complex: The two drugs disulfiram and aurothiomalate react to produce a gold(I)&#8208;dithiocarbamate complex, which selectively kills cancer cells. Hydroxy&#8208;substituted derivatives of this complex form inclusion complexes with &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin in a rare &#8220;tail&#8208;to&#8208;tail&#8221; arrangement. Formulation of one gold complex with a &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin derivative prevents formation of reactive oxygen species in mitochondria.







Abstract
The gold(I)&#8208;dithiocarbamate (dtc) complex [Au(N,N&#8208;diethyl)dtc]2 was identified as the active cytotoxic agent in the combination treatment of sodium aurothiomalate and disulfiram on a panel of cancer cell lines. In addition to demonstrating pronounced differential cytotoxicity to these cell lines, the gold complex showed no cross&#8208;resistance in therapy&#8208;surviving cancer cells. In the course of a medicinal chemistry campaign on this class of poorly soluble gold(I)&#8208;dtc complexes, &gt;35 derivatives were synthesized and X&#8208;ray crystallography was used to examine structural aspects of the dtc moiety. A group of hydroxy&#8208;substituted complexes has an improved solubility profile, and it was found that these complexes form 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 host&#8211;guest inclusion complexes with &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (CD), exhibiting a rarely observed &#8220;tail&#8208;to&#8208;tail&#8221; arrangement of the CD cones. Formulation of a hydroxy&#8208;substituted gold(I)&#8208;dtc complex with excess sulfobutylether&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CD prevents the induction of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species, which is a major burden in the development of metallodrugs.

         <title>G&#8208;Quadruplex Formation by DNA Sequences Deficient in Guanines: Two Tetrad Parallel Quadruplexes Do Not Fold Intramolecularly</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 47, Page 12115-12125, August 19, 2021. </description>

A lesson on less: There are multiple ways a sequence with a reduced number of guanines can form a G&#8208;quadruplex. Parallel topology is unstable, unless stabilized by suitable capping sequences or dimerization.







Abstract
Guanine quadruplexes (G4s) are noncanonical forms of nucleic acids that are frequently found in genomes. The stability of G4s depends, among other factors, on the number of G&#8208;tetrads. Three&#8208; or four&#8208;tetrad G4s and antiparallel two&#8208;tetrad G4s have been characterized experimentally; however, the existence of an intramolecular (i.&#8201;e., not dimeric or multimeric) two&#8208;tetrad parallel&#8208;stranded DNA G4 has never been experimentally observed. Many sequences compatible with two&#8208;tetrad G4 can be found in important genomic regions, such as promoters, for which parallel G4s predominate. Using experimental and theoretical approaches, the propensity of the model sequence AATGGGTGGGTTTGGGTGGGTAA to form an intramolecular parallel&#8208;stranded G4 upon increasing the number of GGG&#8208;to&#8208;GG substitutions has been studied. Deletion of a single G leads to the formation of intramolecular G4s with a stacked G&#8208;triad, whose topology depends on the location of the deletion. Removal of another guanine from another G&#8208;tract leads to di&#8208; or multimeric G4s. Further deletions mostly prevent the formation of any stable G4. Thus, a solitary two&#8208;tetrad parallel DNA G4 is not thermodynamically stable and requires additional interactions through capping residues. However, transiently populated metastable two&#8208;tetrad species can associate to form stable dimers, the dynamic formation of which might play additional delicate roles in gene regulation. These findings provide essential information for bioinformatics studies searching for potential G4s in genomes.

Breaking the rules: Thanks to their broad responsiveness, epoxide&#8208;opening ether cyclizations are identified as ideal for the direct comparison of supramolecular catalysts. The results suggest that &#960;&#8208;basic supramolecular capsule catalysts are as outstanding as pnictogen&#8208;bonding catalysts in breaking the Baldwin rules with high diastereoselectivity, particularly in cyclization cascades leading to bicyclic products. In clear contrast, chemo&#8208; and diastereoselective co&#8208; and autocatalysis is confirmed to be unique for anion&#8208;&#960; interactions.







Abstract
While the integration of supramolecular principles in catalysis attracts increasing attention, a direct comparative assessment of the resulting systems catalysts to work out distinct characteristics is often difficult. Herein is reported how the broad responsiveness of ether cyclizations to diverse inputs promises to fill this gap. Cyclizations in the confined, &#960;&#8208;basic and Br&#248;nsted acidic interior of supramolecular capsules, for instance, are found to excel with speed (exceeding general Br&#248;nsted acid and hydrogen&#8208;bonding catalysts by far) and selective violations of the Baldwin rules (as extreme as the so far unique pnictogen&#8208;bonding catalysts). The complementary cyclization on &#960;&#8208;acidic aromatic surfaces remains unique with regard to autocatalysis, which is shown to be chemo&#8208; and diastereoselective with regard to product&#8208;like co&#8208;catalysts but, so far, not enantioselective.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Cationic Polypeptide Supramolecular Nanogels for Intracellular DNA Delivery</title>

Wrapped in a peptide box: Supramolecular nanogels self&#8208;assembled from poly&#8208;L&#8208;lysine (PLL) modified with host and guest units can entrap molecular cargo such as DNA and deliver it into cells for transfection. The PLL is made by N&#8208;carboxyanhydride polymerization and equipped with cyclodextrin and adamantane groups. The size of the nanogel can be tuned by the length of the PLL and smaller nanogels are better transfection agents.







Abstract
Supramolecular nanogels are an emerging class of polymer nanocarriers for intracellular delivery, due to their straightforward preparation, biocompatibility, and capability to spontaneously encapsulate biologically active components such as DNA. A completely biodegradable three&#8208;component cationic supramolecular nanogel was designed exploiting the multivalent host&#8208;guest interaction of cyclodextrin and adamantane attached to a polypeptide backbone. While cyclodextrin was conjugated to linear poly&#8208;L&#8208;lysine, adamantane was grafted to linear as well as star shaped poly&#8208;L&#8208;lysine. Size control of nanogels was obtained with the increase in the length of the host and guest polymer. Moreover, smaller nanogels were obtained using the star shaped polymers because of the compact nature of star polymers compared to linear polymers. Nanogels were loaded with anionic model cargoes, pyranine and carboxyfluorescein, and their enzyme responsive release was studied using protease trypsin. Confocal microscopy revealed successful transfection of mammalian HeLa cells and intracellular release of pyranine and plasmid DNA, as quantified using a luciferase assay, showing that supramolecular polypeptide nanogels have significant potential in gene therapy applications.

The meso and rac diastereoisomers of two P&#8208;stereogenic 4,5&#8208;bis(mesityl,alkynylphosphanyl)dimethylxanthenes underwent slow thermally induced interconversion. The activation barrier of the P&#8208;propynyl derivative was determined experimentally and by DFT calculation. Adding HB(C6F5)2 to the tert&#8208;butylethynyl&#8208;P&#8208;containing system gave intramolecular pairs of geminal frustrated P/B Lewis pairs at the xanthene&#8208;derived backbone. This reaction also proceeded with epimerization of the P&#8208;stereogenic phosphanyl units. The new FLP pairs at the xanthene backbone formed bridged macrocyclic adducts with a variety of bifunctional Lewis base donors.







Abstract
Attachment of a pair of P&#8208;stereogenic mesityl(alkynyl)phosphanyl groups at the 4&#8208; and 5&#8208;positions of a 9,9&#8208;dimethylxanthene framework gave mixtures of the respective rac&#8208; and meso&#8208;bisphosphanyl diastereoisomers. They slowly epimerized in a thermally induced reaction with Gibbs activation barriers of about 25&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 at room temperature (measured and DFT calculated). The reaction of the meso&#8208;mesityl(tert&#8208;butylethynyl)phosphanyl derivative with two molar equivalents of Piers&#8242; borane [HB(C6F5)2] led to the formation of the alkylidene&#8208;bridged geminal bisphosphane/borane&#8208;frustrated Lewis pair system. The compound was obtained enriched (&gt;85&#8201;%) in the rac diastereoisomer. With a variety of bifunctional donor substrates, the rac&#8208;bis&#8208;P/B FLP formed macrocyclic compounds. They were all formally derived from meso&#8208;configurated diastereoisomers of the bisphosphanylxanthene backbone.

         <title>Evolution of a Strategy for the Total Synthesis of (+)&#8208;Cornexistin</title>

Cycle tricks: The evolution of the first total synthesis of (+)&#8208;cornexistin is reported. Highlights of the successful chiral&#8208;pool strategy are an intermolecular Nozaki&#8211;Hiyama&#8211;Kishi coupling to install the Z alkene, a syn&#8208;Evans&#8208;aldol reaction to construct the C2/C3 stereocenters, an intramolecular allylic alkylation to close the nine&#8208;membered carbocycle and the stepwise hydrolysis of a &#946;&#8208;keto nitrile, which furnished the maleic anhydride.







Abstract
Herein is given a full account of the evolution of the first total synthesis of (+)&#8208;cornexistin. Initial efforts were based on masking the reactive maleic anhydride moiety as a 3,4&#8208;substituted furan and on forming the nine&#8208;membered carbocycle in an intramolecular Conia&#8208;ene or Nozaki&#8211;Hiyama&#8211;Kishi (NHK) reaction. Those strategies suffered from low yields and were jeopardized by a late&#8208;stage installation of the Z&#8208;alkene, as well as the stereocenters along the eastern periphery. These issues were addressed by employing a chiral&#8208;pool strategy that involved construction of the crucial stereocenters at C2, C3 and C8 at an early stage with installation of the maleic anhydride as late as possible. The successful approach featured an intermolecular NHK coupling to install the Z&#8208;alkene, a syn&#8208;Evans&#8208;aldol reaction to forge the stereocenters along the eastern periphery, an intramolecular allylic alkylation to close the nine&#8208;membered carbocycle, and a challenging stepwise hydrolysis of a &#946;&#8208;keto nitrile to furnish the maleic anhydride.

         <title>Bidentate Disilicate Framework for Bis&#8208;Grafted Surface Species</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 47, Page 12069-12077, August 19, 2021. </description>

A molecular precursor bearing a bidentate disilicate ligand, &#8722;OSi(OtBu)2OSi(OtBu)2O&#8722;, was grafted on silica supports by substitution reaction on silicon atoms of the disilicate ligand to selectively form bis&#8208;grafted surface species.







Abstract
Recent advances in surface organometallic chemistry have enabled the detailed characterization of the surface species in single&#8208;site heterogeneous catalysts. However, the selective formation of bis&#8208;grafted surface species remains challenging because of the heterogeneity of the supporting surface. Herein, we introduce a metal complex bearing bidentate disilicate ligands, &#8722;OSi(OtBu)2OSi(OtBu)2O&#8722;, as a molecular precursor, which has a silicate framework adjacent to the metal (Pt) center. The grafting of the precursors on silica supports (MCM&#8208;41 and CARiACT Q10) proceeded through a substitution reaction on the silicon atoms of the disilicate ligand, which was verified by the detection of isobutene and tBuOH as the elimination products, to selectively yield bis&#8208;grafted surface species. The chemical structure of the surface species was characterized by solid&#8208;state NMR, and the chemical shift values of the ancillary ligands and 195Pt nuclei suggested that the bidentate coordination sphere was maintained following grafting.

Cyclooctatetraene (COT) and its derivatives with saddle&#8208;shaped 3D architecture are novel building blocks to construct fully conjugated 3D materials that can achieve the electron layer&#8208;layer delocalization and transport, which provides an inspiration for designing next generation organic semiconductors. For more information, see the Concept by Y. Wang et&#8197;al. on&#8197;12012.

         <title>Frontispiece: Molecular Gears: From Solution to Surfaces</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 47, August 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
This frontispiece illustrates the evolution of the concept of molecular gears from the study of intramolecular gearing motions in solution to the intermolecular transmission of mechanical power on a surface. The molecular gears are transported on the Great Wave off Kanagawa by the famous Japanese ukiyo&#8208;e artist Hokusai and deposited on a gold surface where trains of gears can be studied. For more details see the Review by C. Kammerer, G. Rapenne et&#8197;al. on p.&#8197;12019&#8201;ff.

The synthesis of sterically hindered persistent sila&#8208; and germacyclopentadienyl radicals adds magnetic properties to these heterocyclic ring systems and sparks the idea of their possible application as building blocks for molecular magnets (pictured as red&#8208;blueish northern light). Support comes from the analysis of the EPR spectroscopic parameters and of their computed spin density &#8208; shown here for the silicon species &#8208; that indicate localization of the unpaired electron at the heteroatom. More information can be found in the Full Paper by B. Tumanskii, T. M&#252;ller, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101415).

Synthesizing the &#8220;wanted&#8221; bald eagle killer: Aetokthonotoxin (AETX), a pentabrominated 1,2&#8217;&#8208;biindole alkaloid has been indicted to elicit vacuolar myelinopathy, a neurologic disease causing the death of birds of prey, such as the bald eagle in the USA. In order to assess further biological activity studies, synthesis of this neurotoxin is decidedly needed. Here, we describe its first total synthesis: by fusing advanced indole intermediates in a Somei&#8208;type Michael reaction in only five steps overall. More information can be found in the Full Paper by M.&#8197;G. Ricardo, B. Westermann, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101848).

Dynamically 1D assembled linear Pd8 chains with bisisocyanide linkers are shown against a backdrop of contrails lit from below by the rising sun. A variety of Pd8 chains with a linear tetraphosphine, meso&#8208;dpmppm, were synthesized through both covalent and noncovalent interactions between two Pd4 fragments. They exhibited fine&#8208;tunable electronic states, a wide range of redox properties, and dynamic 1D self&#8208;assembly in solution. These findings could lead to the next frontier in exploring new functions with dynamically aggregated metal building blocks. More information can be found in the Full Paper by T. Tanase et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101715).

Grafting of a platinum precursor bearing a disilicate ligand, &#8722;OSi(OtBu)2OSi(OtBu)2O&#8722;, achieved the selective formation of bis&#8208;grafted surface species on silica supports. The chemical&#8208;shift values of the ancillary ligands were almost identical before and after the grafting, thus suggesting that the coordination sphere around platinum of the grafted species was nearly independent of the type of silica support and the degree of substitution on the disilicate ligand. More information can be found in the Full Paper by J.&#8208;C. Choi et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101927).

         <title>Molecular Gears: From Solution to Surfaces</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 47, Page 12019-12031, August 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Moving up a gear: Molecular gears have been explored since the early 1980s, but only in solution, which is intrinsically limited to intramolecular gearing motions. To propagate mechanical power from one molecule to the next, it is necessary to immobilize cogwheels in a dedicated spatial arrangement, such as in a train of gears on a surface. In the last years, some impressive progress has been made, leading to the correlated rotation of up to three molecules.







Abstract
This review highlights the major efforts devoted to the development of molecular gears over the past 40&#8197;years, from pioneering covalent bis&#8208;triptycyl systems undergoing intramolecular correlated rotation in solution, to the most recent examples of gearing systems anchored on a surface, which allow intermolecular transmission of mechanical power. Emphasis is laid on the different strategies devised progressively to control the architectures of molecular bevel and spur gears, as intramolecular systems in solution or intermolecular systems on surfaces, while aiming at increased efficiency, complexity and functionality.

         <title>Uncovering the Hidden Landscape of Tris(4&#8208;pyridyl) Ligands: Topological Complexity Derived from the Bridgehead</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 47, Page 12036-12040, August 19, 2021. </description>

The power to change: the new heavy main group metal tris(4&#8208;pyridyl) ligands E(4&#8208;py)3 (E=Sb, Bi) build into topologically complex MOFs with AgI, in which the bridgehead atom plays an important role in structure direction. The E(4&#8208;py)3 ligands can function as pyramidal or tetrahedral nodes, an ability that is modulated by the Lewis basicity (stereochemical activity) of the Group 15 element.







Abstract
Supramolecular main group chemistry is a developing field which parallels the conventional domain of metallo&#8208;organic chemistry. Little explored building blocks in this area are main group metal&#8208;based ligands which have the appropriate donor symmetry to build desired molecular or extended arrangements. Tris(pyridyl) main group ligands (E(py)3, E=main group metal) are potentially highly versatile building blocks since shifting the N&#8208;donor arms from the 2&#8208; to the 3&#8208;positions and 4&#8208;positions provides a very simple way of changing the ligand character from mononuclear/chelating to multidentate/metal&#8208;bridging. Here, the coordination behaviour of the first main group metal tris(4&#8208;pyridyl) ligands, E(4&#8208;py)3 (E=Sb, Bi, Ph&#8722;Sn) is explored, as well as their ability to build metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs). The complicated topology of these MOFs shows a marked influence on the counter anion and on the ability of the E(4&#8208;py)3 ligands to switch coordination mode, depending on the steric and donor character of the bridgehead. This structure&#8208;directing influence of the bridgehead provides a potential building strategy for future molecular and MOF design in this area.

         <title>Direct Visualization of Substitutional Li Doping in Supported Pt Nanoparticles and Their Ultra&#8208;selective Catalytic Hydrogenation Performance</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 47, Page 12041-12046, August 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A direct &#8216;substitution&#8217; of Pt with subLi in atomic columns by electron ptychography images with characteristic contraction in lattice parameters from advanced materials characterization is observed for the first time. The electron donation of d&#8208;band of Pt without higher orbital hybridizations by subLi offers an alternative way for ultra&#8208;selectivity in catalytic hydrogenation of carbonyl compounds with detainment of facile CO bond to alcohols.







Abstract
It has only recently been established that doping light elements (lithium, boron, and carbon) into supported transition metals can fill interstitial sites, which can be observed by the expanded unit cell. As an example, interstitial lithium (intLi) can block H filling octahedral interstices of palladium metal lattice, which improves partial hydrogenation of alkynes to alkenes under hydrogen. In contrast, herein, we report intLi is not found in the case of Pt/C. Instead, we observe for the first time a direct &#8216;substitution&#8217; of Pt with substitutional lithium (subLi) in alternating atomic columns using scanning transmission electron microscopy&#8208;annular dark field (STEM&#8208;ADF). This ordered substitutional doping results in a contraction of the unit cell as shown by high&#8208;quality synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction (SXRD). The electron donation of d&#8208;band of Pt without higher orbital hybridizations by subLi offers an alternative way for ultra&#8208;selectivity in catalytic hydrogenation of carbonyl compounds by suppressing the facile CO bond breakage that would form alcohols.

         <title>Subphthalocyaninato Boron(III) Hydride: Synthesis, Structure and Reactivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 47, Page 12058-12062, August 19, 2021. </description>

For the first time subphthalocyanine&#8208;hydride derivatives that exhibit high reactivity as hydroboration reagents of aldehydes have been prepared. This transformation has proven to be a useful alternative method for the axial functionalisation of dodecafluoro&#8208;subphthalocyanines using electrophiles. Considering the increasing interest in SubPcs as electron&#8208;acceptor semiconductors to replace fullerene in organic photovoltaic devices, it is of the utmost importance to develop new synthetic methodologies for their axial functionalisation.







Abstract
Subphthalocyanine (SubPc) chemistry has been limited so far by their high sensitivity toward strong nucleophiles. In particular, the substitution of the axial chlorine atom by a nucleophilic group in the case of less&#8208;reactive SubPcs, such as those bearing electron&#8208;withdrawing peripheral substituents, presents some limitations and requires harsh conditions. By taking advantage of the electrophilic character of DIBAL&#8208;H, it has been possible to prepare for the first time SubPc&#8208;hydride derivatives that exhibit high reactivity as hydroboration reagents of aldehydes. This hydride transfer requires using a typical carbonyl activator (trimethylsilyl triflate) and only one equivalent of aldehyde, affording SubPcs with an axial benzyloxy group in good yield. This transformation has proven to be a useful alternative method for the axial functionalisation of dodecafluoroSubPc, a paradigmatic SubPc derivative, by using electrophiles for the first time. Considering the increasing interest in SubPcs as electron&#8208;acceptor semiconductors with remarkable absorption in the visible range to replace fullerene in organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices, it is of the utmost importance to develop new synthetic methodologies for their axial functionalisation.

The efficient self&#8208;templated formation of optically active 2,6&#8208;bis(1,2,3&#8208;triazol&#8208;4&#8208;yl)pyridine (btp)&#8208;derived homocircuit [2]catenane enantiomers (S,S)(S,S) and (R,R)(R,R) is reported. This represents the first example of the enantiopure formation of chiral homocircuit [2]catenanes from starting materials consisting of a classical chiral element such as a chiral centre. The self&#8208;assembly reaction was monitored closely in solution facilitating the characterization of the pseudo&#8208;rotaxane reaction intermediate prior to mechanically interlocking the pre&#8208;organised system via ring&#8208;closing metathesis.

This represents the first example of the enantiopure formation of chiral btp homocircuit [2]catenanes from starting materials consisting of a classical chiral element; X&#8208;ray diffraction crystallography enabled the structural characterization of the [2]catenane. The self&#8208;assembly reaction was monitored closely in solution facilitating the characterization of the pseudo&#8208;rotaxane reaction intermediate prior to mechanically interlocking the pre&#8208;organised system via ring&#8208;closing metathesis.

This represents the first example of the enantiopure formation of chiral homocircuit [2]catenanes from starting materials consisting of a classical chiral element such as a chiral centre. The self-assembly reaction was monitored closely in solution facilitating the characterization of the &lt;i&gt;pseudo&lt;/i&gt;-rotaxane reaction intermediate prior to mechanically interlocking the pre-organised system via ring-closing metathesis.

Edge of glory: Calcium zinc borate with a new fundamental building block [B8O17], Ca1.13Zn0.87B8O14 has been successfully synthesized. It exhibits two independent interpenetrating three&#8208;dimensional (3D) B&#8722;O anion networks constructed by [B8O17] groups, only a few borates present the interpenetrating 3D framework, enriching the structural diversity of B&#8722;O configurations. The UV&#8208;Vis&#8208;NIR diffuse&#8208;reflectance spectrum shows that it has a short UV cutoff edge (&lt;195&#8197;nm).

         <title>Total Synthesis of Aetokthonotoxin, the Cyanobacterial Neurotoxin Causing Vacuolar Myelinopathy</title>

Heterocyclic chemistry: Synthesizing the eagle murder's weapon. With the identification of the alkaloid Aetokthonotoxin (AETX) as the neurotoxin causing wildlife deaths in the USA, further studies to characterize the biological effects of this natural product are mandatory. These studies will be enabled by a total synthesis of this natural product, which has been achieved in only five steps overall.







Abstract
Aetokthonotoxin has recently been identified as the cyanobacterial neurotoxin causing Vacuolar Myelinopathy, a fatal neurologic disease, spreading through a trophic cascade and affecting birds of prey such as the bald eagle in the USA. Here, we describe the total synthesis of this specialized metabolite. The complex, highly brominated 1,2&#8217;&#8208;biindole could be synthesized via a Somei&#8208;type Michael reaction as key step. The optimised sequence yielded the natural product in five steps with an overall yield of 29&#8201;%.

&#8220;The ultimate inspiration for this project came from work of the group of Robert West (Madison) from 2003 describing a stable silole&#8208;based biradical. It was tempting for us to explore the possibilities to prepare such neutral radicals and to add magnetic properties to siloles and germoles, thus creating a truly multifunctional material.&#8221; Read more about the story behind the cover in the Cover Profile and about the research itself on page&#8197;12063&#8197;ff.

         <title>Trigonal Prismatic Coordination of Discrete Rare Earth Ions, Enforced by the Polyoxotungstate [P4W27O99(H2O)]16&#8211;</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controlled partial decomposition of the organophosphonate&#8208;functionalized V&#8208;shaped polyoxotungstate [P4W24O92(C6H5PVO)2]16&#8722; generates a {Na&#8834;P4W27} macrocycle with an endo&#8208;oriented pocket that defines an isosceles trigonal&#8208;prismatic coordination environment for yttrium(III) and a wide range of lanthanide(III) ions. The [Na&#8834;{LnIII(H2O)}{WO(H2O)}P4W26O98]12&#8722; series undergoes five consecutive (quasi&#8208;)reversible redox transformations. The Dy, Ho, Er, and Yb derivatives show weak out&#8208;of&#8208;phase components in their ac magnetic susceptibility, where H/D exchange of the aqua ligand in the Dy compound influences the magnetic relaxation.







Abstract
A family of solution&#8208;stable polyanions [Na&#8834;{LnIII(H2O)}{WVIO(H2O)}PV4WVI26O98]12&#8722; (Ln=Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, Yb, Lu and Y) represent the first examples of polyoxometalates comprising a single lanthanide(III) or yttrium(III) ion in a rare trigonal prismatic O6 environment. Their synthesis exploits the reactivity of the organophosphonate&#8208;functionalized precursor [P4W24O92(C6H5PVO)2]16&#8722; with heterometal ions and yields hydrated potassium or mixed lithium/potassium salts of composition KxLnyH12&#8211;x&#8211;y[Na&#8834;{Ln(H2O)}{WO(H2O)}P4W26O98]&#8901;nH2O&#8901;mLiCl (x=8.5&#8211;11; y=0&#8211;2; n=24&#8211;34; m=0&#8211;1.5).

         <title>A Comprehensive Study on the Full Series of Alkali&#8208;Metal Selenocyanates AI[SeCN] (AI=Li&#8722;Cs)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
AI[SeCN] with AI=Li&#8722;Rb were synthesized by oxidation of cyanides with selenium or by metathesis (AI=Cs). Whereas all reactions proceed in solution, LiSeCN can only be obtained solvent free by ball milling. All compounds were crystallographically characterized, their structures optimized by DFT methods and their vibrational spectra recorded. DSC measurements showed congruent melting and allowed for extraction of the melting points.







Abstract
The full series of quasibinary alkali&#8208;metal selenocyanates was synthesized either by oxidation of the respective cyanides (A=Li&#8722;Rb) or by metathesis (A=Cs). For Li[SeCN] only ball&#8208;milling and subsequent annealing led to the isolation of the quasibinary selenocyanate. Their structures were refined from single&#8208;crystal and powder X&#8208;ray data. The respective solid&#8208;state IR and Raman spectra were interpreted with the aid of solid&#8208;state quantum&#8208;mechanical calculations and DSC&#8208;TGA measurements allowed for extraction of melting points. Only for Li[SeCN] a possible phase transition was observed that is discussed on the basis of VT&#8208;PXRD experiments. It is also the only quasibinary selenocyanate to form a hydrate (Li[SeCN]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H2O).

A catalytic domino reduction / imine formation / intramolecular cyclization / oxidation allows the synthesis of a wide variety of biologically relevant N&#8208;polyheterocycles. The reported process employs an inexpensive and nontoxic dioxomolybdenum(VI) complex as catalyst, easily available nitroarenes as starting materials and different glycols as reducing agents with reuse of the waste reduction carbonyl byproduct, which is embodied into the final compounds.







Abstract
A catalytic domino reduction&#8211;imine formation&#8211;intramolecular cyclization&#8211;oxidation for the general synthesis of a wide variety of biologically relevant N&#8208;polyheterocycles, such as quinoxaline&#8208; and quinoline&#8208;fused derivatives, and phenanthridines, is reported. A simple, easily available, and environmentally friendly dioxomolybdenum(VI) complex has proven to be a highly efficient and versatile catalyst for transforming a broad range of starting nitroarenes involving several redox processes. Not only is this a sustainable, step&#8208;economical as well as air&#8208; and moisture&#8208;tolerant method, but also it is worth highlighting that the waste byproduct generated in the first step of the sequence is recycled and incorporated in the final target molecule, improving the overall synthetic efficiency. Moreover, selected indoloquinoxalines have been photophysically characterized in cyclohexane and toluene with exceptional fluorescence quantum yields above 0.7 for the alkyl derivatives.

         <title>Mechanistic Investigation of a Synthetic Route to Biaryls by the Sigmatropic Rearrangement of Arylsulfonium Species</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Experimental and computational investigations revealed that, depending on the structure and electronic features of the substrates in the coupling reaction of aryl sulfoxides with phenols, the reaction pathway of the rate&#8208;determining [3,3] sigmatropic rearrangements of the interrupted Pummerer intermediates can vary due to changes in energy synchronicity. As an extreme case, when an electron&#8208;rich phenol is involved, the rearrangement is no longer concerted, but instead stepwise via a &#960;&#8208;complex of the corresponding aryl sulfide and phenoxonium cation.







Abstract
A comprehensive mechanistic investigation was conducted on the coupling reaction of aryl sulfoxides with phenols by using trifluoroacetic anhydride to yield biaryls. NMR experiments revealed that our previously proposed mechanism, which consists of a cascade of an interrupted Pummerer reaction and a rate&#8208;determining [3,3] sigmatropic rearrangement, is reasonable. The electronic effects of the substrates were also evaluated to elucidate the nature of the rearrangement step. Based on experimental observations and theoretical calculations, we conclude that the rearrangement is highly asynchronous and stepwise rather than concerted when electron&#8208;rich phenols are employed for the reaction.

         <title>Hybrid Self&#8208;Assembled Gel Beads for Tuneable pH&#8208;Controlled Rosuvastatin Delivery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It&#8242;s all in the delivery: Self&#8208;assembled gel beads have been fabricated using different supramolecular gelators in combination with a calcium alginate polymer gelator and loaded with the statin drug rosuvastatin. The rate of rosuvastatin release is shown to depend on both the pH of the receiving solution and the precise gel bead composition. As such, these gel beads are capable of doubly controlled release.







Abstract
This article describes the fabrication of new pH&#8208;responsive hybrid gel beads combining the polymer gelator calcium alginate with two different low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight gelators (LMWGs) based on 1,3&#8201;:&#8201;2,4&#8208;dibenzylidene&#8208;d&#8208;sorbitol: pH&#8208;responsive DBS&#8208;COOH and thermally responsive DBS&#8208;CONHNH2, thus clearly demonstrating that different classes of LMWG can be fabricated into gel beads by using this approach. We also demonstrate that self&#8208;assembled multicomponent gel beads can be formed by using different combinations of these gelators. The different gel bead formulations exhibit different responsiveness &#8211; the DBS&#8208;COOH network can disassemble within those beads in which it is present upon raising the pH. To exemplify preliminary data for a potential application for these hybrid gel beads, we explored aspects of the delivery of the lipid&#8208;lowering active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) rosuvastatin. The release profile of this statin from the hybrid gel beads is pH&#8208;dependent, with greater release at pH&#8197;7.4 than at pH&#8197;4.0 &#8211; primary control of this process results from the pKa of the API. The extent of pH&#8208;mediated API release is also significantly further modified according to gel bead composition. The DBS&#8208;COOH/alginate beads show rapid, highly effective drug release at pH&#8197;7.4, whereas the three&#8208;component DBS&#8208;COOH/DBS&#8208;CONHNH2/alginate system shows controlled slow release of the API under the same conditions. These initial results indicate that such gel beads constitute a promising, versatile and easily tuned platform suitable for further development for controlled drug&#8208;delivery applications.

To exemplify preliminary data for a potential application for these hybrid gel beads, we explored aspects of the delivery of the lipid-lowering active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) rosuvastatin. The release profile of this statin from the hybrid gel beads is pH-dependent, with greater release at pH&#8197;7.4 than at pH&#8197;4.0 &#8211; primary control of this process results from the p&lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; of the API. The extent of pH-mediated API release is also significantly further modified according to gel bead composition. The DBS-COOH/alginate beads show rapid, highly effective drug release at pH&#8197;7.4, whereas the three-component DBS-COOH/DBS-CONHNH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/alginate system shows controlled slow release of the API under the same conditions. These initial results indicate that such gel beads constitute a promising, versatile and easily tuned platform suitable for further development for controlled drug-delivery applications.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Matrix Isolation Spectroscopic and Relativistic Quantum Chemical Study of Molecular Platinum Fluorides PtFn (n=1&#8211;6) Reveals Magnetic Bistability of PtF4</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spin cycle: The IR spectra of molecular platinum fluorides PtFn (n=1&#8211;6) isolated in rare&#8208;gas matrices are presented. PtF4 is formed almost quantitatively under blue light radiation of PtF6, while PtF5 and PtF3 were produced by subsequent UV radiation of PtF4. The coexistence of a singlet and a triplet electronic spin state of PtF4 caused by competing Jahn&#8208;Teller and spin&#8211;orbit coupling effects has been verified spectroscopically in the low&#8208;temperature matrix.







Abstract
Molecular platinum fluorides PtFn, n=1&#8211;6, are prepared by two different routes, photo&#8208;initiated fluorine elimination from PtF6 embedded in solid noble&#8208;gas matrices, and the reaction of elemental fluorine with laser&#8208;ablated platinum atoms. IR spectra of the reaction products isolated in rare&#8208;gas matrices under cryogenic conditions provide, for the first time, experimental vibrational frequencies of molecular PtF3, PtF4 and PtF5. Photolysis of PtF6 enabled a highly efficient and almost quantitative formation of molecular PtF4, whereas both PtF5 and PtF3 were formed simultaneously by subsequent UV irradiation of PtF4. The vibrational spectra of these molecular platinum fluorides were assigned with the help of one&#8208; and two&#8208;component quasirelativistic DFT computation to account for scalar relativistic and spin&#8211;orbit coupling effects. Competing Jahn&#8208;Teller and spin&#8211;orbit coupling effects result in a magnetic bistability of PtF4, for which a spin&#8208;triplet (3B2g, D2h) coexists with an electronic singlet state (1A1g, D4h) in solid neon matrices.

         <dc:description>Despite common occurrence in molecules of value, methods for transforming sulfonamides are distinctly lacking. Here we introduce easy&#8208;to&#8208;access sulfonyl pyrroles as synthetic linchpins for sulfonamide functionalization. The versatility of the sulfonyl pyrrole unit is shown by generating a variety of products through chemical, electrochemical and photochemical pathways. Preliminary results on the direct functionalization of primary sulfonamides are also provided, which may lead to new modes of activation.</dc:description>

         <title>Hybrid Eu(III) Coordination luminophore Standing on Silica Nanoparticles By Two Legs for Enhanced Luminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, we demonstrated a two&#8208;legs standing&#8208;up molecular design method for mono&#8208;chromatic and bright red luminescent Ln(III)&#8208;silica nanomaterials. A novel Eu(III)&#8208;silica hybrid nanoparticle using double binding TPPO&#8208;Si(OEt)  3  (TPPO: triphenyl phosphine oxide) linker were developed. The TPPO&#8208;Si(OEt)  3&#160;  was determined by  1  H,  31  P,  29  Si NMR spectroscopy and&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis. Luminescent Eu(hfa)  3&#160;  and Eu(tfc)  3&#160;  parts (hfa: hexafluoroacetylacetonate, tfc: 3&#8208;(trifluoromethylhydroxymethylene)camphorate) were fixed on the TPPO&#8208;Si(OEt)  3&#160;  modified silica nanoparticles, producing in Eu(hfa)  3  (TPPO&#8208;Si)  2  &#8208;SiO  2&#160;  and Eu(tfc)  3  (TPPO&#8208;Si)  2  &#8208;SiO  2  , respectively. The Eu(hfa)  3  (TPPO&#8208;Si)  2  &#8208;SiO  2&#160;  exhibited higher intrinsic luminescence quantum yield (93%) and longer emission lifetime (0.98 ms), which is much larger than those of previously reported Eu(III)&#8208;based hybrid materials. Eu(tfc)  3  (TPPO&#8208;Si)  2  &#8208;SiO  2&#160;  also showed extra&#8208;large intrinsic emission quantum yield (54%), although the emission quantum yield for the precursor Eu(tfc)  3  (TPPO&#8208;Si(OEt)  3  )  2&#160;  was found to be 39%. These results confirmed that the TPPO&#8208;Si(OEt)  3&#160;  linker is a promising candidate for development of Eu(III)&#8208;based luminescent materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis, Mechanism Elucidation and Biological Insights of Tellurium(IV)&#8208;containing Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inspired by the synthetic and biological potential of organotellurium substances, we describe here the synthesis and characterization of a series of five&#8208; and six&#8208;membered ring organotelluranes containing a Te&#8211;O bond. Theoretical calculations elucidated the mechanism for the oxidation&#8208;cyclization processes involved in the formation of the heterocycles, consistent with chlorine transfer to hydroxy telluride, followed by cyclization step with simultaneous formation of the new Te&#8211;O bond and the OH group deprotonation. Moreover, theoretical calculations also indicated anti &#8208;diastereoisomers as major products for two&#8208;chirality center&#8208;containing compounds. Antileishmanial assays against Leishmania amazonensis promastigotes disclosed 1,2&#955; 4 &#8208;oxatellurane LQ50 (IC 50 = 4.1&#177;1.0; SI = 12), 1,2&#955; 4 &#8208;oxatellurolane LQ04 (IC 50 = 7.0&#177;1.3; SI = 7) and 1,2&#955; 4 &#8208;benzoxatellurole LQ56 (IC 50 = 5.7&#177;0.3; SI = 6) as more powerful and more selective compounds, up to four times more active than the reference. Stability study supported by 125 Te NMR analyses showed that these heterocycles do not suffer structural modifications in aqueous&#8208;organic media and up to 65 &#176;C.</dc:description>

         <title>A Diazirine&#8208;Modified Membrane Lipid to Study Peptide/Lipid Interactions &#8211; Chances and Challenges</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although incorporation of photo&#8208;activatable lipids into membranes potentially opens up novel avenues for investigating interactions with proteins, the question of whether diazirine&#8208;modified lipids are suitable for such studies, remains under debate. Focusing on the potential for studying lipid/peptide interactions by cross&#8208;linking mass spectrometry (XL&#8208;MS), we developed a diazirine&#8208;modified lipid (DiazPC), and examined its behavior in membranes incorporating the model &#945;&#8208;helical peptide LAVA20. We observed an unexpected backfolding of the diazirine&#8208;containing stearoyl chain of the lipid. This surprising behavior challenges the potential application of DiazPC for future XL&#8722;MS studies of peptide and protein/lipid interactions. The observations made for DiazPC most likely represent a general phenomenon for any type of membrane lipids with a polar moiety incorporated into the alkyl chain. Our finding is therefore of importance for future protein/lipid interaction studies relying on modified lipid probes.</dc:description>

         <title>Monocyclometalated (C^N) Gold(III) Metallacycles: Tunable Emission and Singlet Oxygen (1O2) Generation Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis, characterization and photoluminescent properties of four cyclometalated (C^N)&#8208;type gold(III) complexes bearing a bidentate diacetylide ligand, tolan&#8208;2,2&#8217;&#8208;diacetylide (tda), are reported. The complexes exhibit highly tunable excited state properties and show photoluminescence (PL) across the entire visible spectrum from sky&#8208;blue (&#955;  PL  = 493 nm) to red (&#955;  PL  = 675 nm) with absolute PL quantum yields (PLQY) of up to 75% in solution, the highest PLQY found for any monocyclometalated Au(III) complex in solution. As a consequence of the use of the strongly rigidifying diacetylide bidentate ligand, a significant increase in the excited state lifetimes (&#964;  0  = 16&#8211;258 &#956;s) was found in solution and in thin films. The complexes showed remarkable singlet oxygen generation in aerated solution with absolute singlet oxygen quantum yields (&#981;  1&#916;  ) values reaching up to 7.5 x 10  &#8211;5  and singlet oxygen lifetimes (&#964;  0  1&#916;  ) in the range of 66&#8211;95 &#956;s. Furthermore, the radiative and non&#8208;radiative rates of singlet oxygen were determined using the &#981;  1&#916;  and &#964;  0  1&#916;  values and correlations are drawn between the formation of singlet oxygen and its interaction with cyclometalated (C^N) gold(III) complexes.</dc:description>

         <title>N&#8208;Type Quinoidal Polymers Based on Dipyrrolopyrazinedione for Application in All&#8208;Polymer Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Conjugated molecules and polymers with intrinsic quinoidal structure are promising n&#8208;type organic semiconductors, which have been reported for application in  field&#8208;effect transistors  and thermoelectric devices. In principle, the molecular and electronic characteristics of quinoidal polymers can also enable their application in organic solar cells. Herein, two quin oidal polymers, na med PzDP &#8208;T and PzDP&#8208;ffT, based on dipyrrolopyrazinedione were synthesized and used as electron acceptors in all&#8208;polymer solar cells (all&#8208; PSC s). Both PzDP&#8208;T and PzDP&#8208;ffT showed suitable energy levels and wide light absorption range that extended to the near&#8208;infrared region. When combined with the polymer donor PBDB&#8208;T, the resulting all&#8208;PSCs based on PzDP&#8208;T and PzDP&#8208;ffT exhibited a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 1.33 and 2.37%, respectively. This is the first report on the application of intrinsic quinoidal conjugated polymers in all&#8208;PSCs. The photovoltaic performance of the all&#8208;PSCs was revealed to be mainly limited by the relatively poor and imbalanced charge transport, considerable charge recombination. Detailed investigations on the structure&#8208;performance relationship suggested that synergistic optimization of light absorption, energy levels, and charge transport properties is needed to achieve more successful application of intrinsic quinoidal conjugated polymers in all&#8208;PSCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Investigation of Masked N&#8208;Acyl&#8208;N&#8208;isocyanates: Support for Oxadiazolones as Blocked N&#8208;Isocyanate precursors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In contrast to carbon&#8208;substituted isocyanates that are common building blocks,  nitrogen  &#8208;substituted isocyanates remain underdeveloped and reports on their  N  &#8208;acyl derivatives (i.e. amidoisocyanates) are exceedingly rare. Herein amido&#8208;isocyanates were investigated in the context of syntheses of aza&#8208;tripeptide and hydantoins subunits starting from simple bench&#8208;stable precursors. A key finding is that the amido&#8208;isocyanate formed  in situ  cyclized to yield an oxadiazolone, and that under suitable reaction conditions this heterocycle is a traceless blocked (masked)  N  &#8208;isocyanate. Using organic bases as catalysts and upon heating, oxadiazolone formation is observed, and various nucleophiles to provide the desired azadipeptides or hydantoins in moderate to high yields. Further support for an amido&#8208;isocyanate intermediate was obtained using carboxylic acids as nucleophiles, affording  N  &#8208;acylhydrazide products.</dc:description>

         <title>Excited state charge separation in an azobenzene&#8208;bridged perylenediimide dimer &#8211; effect of photochemical trans&#8208;cis isomerization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoinduced charge transfer and separation events in a newly synthesized azobenzene&#8208;bridged perylenediimide&#8208;dimer (PDIdimer) are demonstrated. Trans&#8208;to&#8208;cis coversion (~50% efficiency) from the initial trans PDI&#8208;dimer by 355 nm pulsed laser light, and its reversal, cis&#8208;to&#8208;trans, process by 435 nm laser light irradiation has been possible to accomplish. Efficient fluorescence quenching in the PDI&#8208;dimer, more so for the cis isomer was witnessed, and such quenching increased with increasing solvent polarity. DFT&#8208;calculated geometry and electronic structures helped in visualizing the charge transfer in the PDI&#8208;dimer in both isomeric forms, and also revealed certain degree of participation of the azobenzene entity in the charge transfer events. Femtosecond transient absorption spectral studies confirmed occurrence of both charge transfer followed by charge separation in the studied PDI&#8208;dimer in both trans and cis forms in polar solvents, and the evaluated time constants from target data analysis revealed accelarated events in the cis PDI&#8208;dimer due to proximity effects. The present study offers key insights on the role of the azobenzene bridge, and the dimer geometry in governing the excited state charge transfer and separation in symmetrically linked PDI dimer.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Despite recent extensive studies on mechanochromic luminescence (MCL), rational control over the magnitude of the emission&#8208;wavelength shift in response to mechanical stimuli remains challenging. In the present study, a two&#8208;component donor&#8211;acceptor approach has been applied to create a variety of organic MCL composites that exhibit remarkable emission&#8208;wavelength switching. Dibenzofuran&#8208;based bis(1&#8208;pyrenylmethyl)diamine and typical organic fluorophores have been employed as donor and acceptor dyes, respectively. Outstanding wide&#8208;range MCL with an emission&#8208;wavelength shift of over 300 nm has been achieved by mixing the diamine with 3,4,9,10&#8208;perylenetetracarboxylic diimide. Unprecedented two&#8208;step MCL in response to mechanical stimuli of different intensity has also been realized for a two&#8208;component mixture with 9,10&#8208;anthraquinone. Fluorescence microscopy observations at the single&#8208;particle level revealed that the segregation and mixing of the two&#8208;component dyes contribute to the stimuli&#8208;responsive emission&#8208;color switching of the MCL composites.</dc:description>

         <title>Analyzing Anisotropic Exchange in a Pentanuclear Os2Ni3 Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magnetic properties of a pentanuclear Os
Ni
 complex have been calculated from complete active space wave function calculations including spin&#8208;orbit coupling. The calculated anisotropic Os&#8722;Ni exchange interactions in combination with a negative g value for octahedral OsIII centres reproduce the experimentally observed temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility.







Abstract
Spin Hamiltonian parameters of a pentanuclear Os
Ni
 cyanometallate complex are derived from ab initio wave function based calculations, namely valence&#8208;type configuration interaction calculations with a complete active space including spin&#8208;orbit interaction (CASOCI) in a single&#8208;step procedure. While fits of experimental data performed so far could reproduce the data but the resulting parameters were not satisfactory, the parameters derived in the present work reproduce experimental data and at the same time have a reasonable size. The one&#8208;centre parameters (local 
 matrices and single&#8208;ion zero field splitting tensors) are within an expected range, the anisotropic exchange parameters obtained in this work for an Os&#8722;Ni pair are not exceedingly large but determine the low&#8208;T part of the experimental &#967;T curve. Exchange interactions (both isotropic and anisotropic) obtained from CASOCI have to be scaled by a factor of 2.5 to obtain agreement with experiment, a known deficiency of such types of calculation. After scaling the parameters, the isotropic Os&#8722;Ni exchange coupling constant is 
&#8197;cm&#8722;1 and the D parameter of the (nearly axial) anisotropic Os&#8722;Ni exchange is 
&#8722;1, so anisotropic exchange is larger in absolute size than isotropic exchange. The negative value of the isotropic J (indicating antiferromagnetic coupling) seemingly contradicts the large&#8208;temperature behaviour of the temperature dependent susceptibility curve, but this is caused by the negative g value of the Os centres. This negative g value is a universal feature of a pseudo&#8208;octahedral coordination with 
 configuration and strong spin&#8208;orbit interaction. Knowing the size of these exchange interactions is important because Os(CN)
 is a versatile building block for the synthesis of

     alt="Analyzing Anisotropic Exchange in a Pentanuclear Os2Ni3 Complex"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Magnetic properties&lt;/b&gt; of a pentanuclear Os
Ni
 complex have been calculated from complete active space wave function calculations including spin-orbit coupling. The calculated anisotropic Os&#8722;Ni exchange interactions in combination with a negative &lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; value for octahedral Os&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; centres reproduce the experimentally observed temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spin Hamiltonian parameters of a pentanuclear Os
Ni
 cyanometallate complex are derived from ab initio wave function based calculations, namely valence-type configuration interaction calculations with a complete active space including spin-orbit interaction (CASOCI) in a single-step procedure. While fits of experimental data performed so far could reproduce the data but the resulting parameters were not satisfactory, the parameters derived in the present work reproduce experimental data and at the same time have a reasonable size. The one-centre parameters (local 
 matrices and single-ion zero field splitting tensors) are within an expected range, the anisotropic exchange parameters obtained in this work for an Os&#8722;Ni pair are not exceedingly large but determine the low-&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt; part of the experimental &lt;i&gt;&#967;T&lt;/i&gt; curve. Exchange interactions (both isotropic and anisotropic) obtained from CASOCI have to be scaled by a factor of 2.5 to obtain agreement with experiment, a known deficiency of such types of calculation. After scaling the parameters, the isotropic Os&#8722;Ni exchange coupling constant is 
&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and the &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt; parameter of the (nearly axial) anisotropic Os&#8722;Ni exchange is 
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, so anisotropic exchange is larger in absolute size than isotropic exchange. The negative value of the isotropic &lt;i&gt;J&lt;/i&gt; (indicating antiferromagnetic coupling) seemingly contradicts the large-temperature behaviour of the temperature dependent susceptibility curve, but this is caused by the negative &lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; value of the Os centres. This negative &lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; value is a universal feature of a pseudo-octahedral coordination with 
 configuration and strong spin-orbit interaction. Knowing the size of these exchange interactions is important because Os(CN)
 is a versatile building block for the synthesis of

         <title>Transient Directing Groups in Metal&#8722;Organic Cooperative Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strategic functionalization: The direct functionalization of C&#8722;H bonds is among the most important transformations in organic synthesis, but its efficiency depends on its selectivity, which can be controlled by the innate reactivity of the substrate or a directing group. While this last strategy has turned out to be efficient, the directing groups need to be installed before and cleaved after the transformation. These two undesired synthetic operations can be avoided by using the transient directing group strategy that is comprehensively overviewed in this review article.







Abstract
The direct functionalization of C&#8722;H bonds is among the most fundamental chemical transformations in organic synthesis. However, when the innate reactivity of the substrate cannot be utilized for the functionalization of a given single C&#8722;H bond, this selective C&#8722;H bond functionalization mostly relies on the use of directing groups that allow bringing the catalyst in close proximity to the C&#8722;H bond to be activated and these directing groups need to be installed before and cleaved after the transformation, which involves two additional undesired synthetic operations. These additional steps dramatically reduce the overall impact and the attractiveness of C&#8722;H bond functionalization techniques since classical approaches based on substrate pre&#8208;functionalization are sometimes still more straightforward and appealing. During the past decade, a different approach involving both the in&#8197;situ installation and removal of the directing group, which can then often be used in a catalytic manner, has emerged: the transient directing group strategy. In addition to its innovative character, this strategy has brought C&#8722;H bond functionalization to an unprecedented level of usefulness and has enabled the development of remarkably efficient processes for the direct and selective introduction of functional groups onto both aromatic and aliphatic substrates. The processes unlocked by the development of these transient directing groups will be comprehensively overviewed in this review article.

         <title>New Ideas for Understanding the Structure and Magnetism in AgF2: Prediction of Ferroelasticity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
With the help of DFT calculations, we show that the experimental orthorhombic (Pbca) structure of the argentate AgF2, which displays an antiferromagnetic (AFM) order perpendicular to the long axis of the lattice, comes from a cooperative trigonal Jahn&#8208;Teller distortion of (AgF6)4&#8722; complexes in a cubic Pa&#8208;3 high&#8208;symmetry reference phase. As a consequence, the system, displaying three equivalent minima, is ferroelastic and displays a strong magneto&#8208;elastic effect that controls the orientation of the AFM order.







Abstract
In the search for new high&#8208;temperature superconductors, it has been proposed that there are strong similarities between the fluoroargentate AgF2 and the cuprate La2CuO4. We explored the origin of the possible layered structure of AgF2 by studying its parent high&#8208;symmetry phase and comparing these results with those of a seemingly analogous cuprate, CuF2. Our findings first stress the large differences between CuF2 and AgF2. Indeed, the parent structure of AgF2 is found to be cubic, naturally devoid of any layering, even though Ag2+ ions occupy trigonal sites that, nevertheless, allow the existence of a Jahn&#8208;Teller effect. The observed Pbca orthorhombic phase is found when the system is cooperatively distorted by a local E&#8855;e trigonal Jahn&#8208;Teller effect around the silver sites that creates both geometrical and magnetic layering. While the distortion implies that two Ag2+&#8722;F&#8722; bonds increase their distance by 15&#8201;% and become softer, our simulations indicate that covalent bonding and interlayer electron hopping is strong, unlike the situation in cuprate superconductors, and that, in fact, exfoliation of individual planes might be a harder task than previously suggested. As a salient feature, these results prove that the actual magnetic structure in AgF2 is a direct consequence of vibronic contributions involved in the Jahn&#8208;Teller effect. Finally, our findings show that, due to the multiple minima intrinsic to the Jahn&#8208;Teller energy surface, the system is ferroelastic, a property that is strongly coupled to magnetism in this argentate.

         <title>Selective Oxygen and Hydrogen Functionalization of the h&#8208;BN/Rh(111) Nanomesh</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By using an atomic hydrogen source and a supersonic molecular beam of oxygen, the hexagonal boron nitride nanomesh on Rh(111) was covalently functionalized with molecular oxygen and atomic hydrogen. Investigation of the system by high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy reveals that only the pores of the nanomesh are functionalized whereas the wires remain unaffected. This selectivity leads to spatially defined chemical functionalization of the corrugated two&#8208;dimensional material. More information can be found in the Full Paper by C. Papp et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101946).

         <title>Polymorphic Phosphorescence from Separable Aggregates with Unique Photophysical Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interactions causing the action: Square planar platinum complexes aggregate into polymorphs with different intermolecular interactions leading to unique photophysical properties. Strong intermolecular interactions stabilize the aggregate to such an extent that the polymorphs can be separated by column chromatography. Solid&#8208;state structures, quantum chemical calculations, concentration&#8208;dependent excitation&#8211;emission spectroscopy, and solid&#8208;state emission spectroscopy help to rationalize and shed light on the nature of this phenomenon.

Platinum complexes aggregate into polymorphs with different intermolecular interactions leading to different photophysical properties. Strong intermolecular interactions stabilize the aggregate to such an extent that the polymorphs can be separated directly by column chromatography.

         <title>Covalent Patterning of 2D MoS2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient approach to patterning 2D MoS2 through covalent functionalization of electron beam lithography (EBL)&#8208;defined guiding patterns has been demonstrated by A. Hirsch et al. in their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202102021). This approach opens a convenient avenue for spatially designing and engineering MoS2 nanostructures, and would benefit further exploration of MoS2&#8208;based devices and facilitate efficient manufacture.

Hirsch et al. in their Communication (DOI: &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/chem.202102021"&gt;10.1002/chem.202102021&lt;/a&gt;). This approach opens a convenient avenue for spatially designing and engineering MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanostructures, and would benefit further exploration of MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-based devices and facilitate efficient manufacture.

         <title>Harvesting light to produce heat: photothermal nanoparticles for technological applications and biomedical devices</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The photothermal properties of nanoparticles (NP), i.e. their ability to convert absorbed light into heat, have been studied since the end of the past century mainly on gold NP. In the new millennium these studies developed into a burst of research dedicated to the photothermal ablation of tumors. However, beside this strictly medical theme, researches have flourished also in the connected areas of photothermal antibacterial surface coatings, gels and polymers, of photothermal surfaces for cell stimulation, as well as in purely technological areas that do not involve medical biotechnology. These include the direct conversion of solar light into heat, a more efficient sun generation of steam and the use of inkjet printed patterns of photothermal NP for anticounterfeit printing based on temperature reading, to cite a few. After an analysis on the photothermal effect (PTE) and of its mechanism, this minireview briefly considers the antitumoral therapy theme and dedicates in deep to all the other technological and biomedical applications of the PTE, with a particular attention to the photothermal materials whose NP have joined those based on Au</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Pressure Synthesis of Sc5P12N23O3 and Ti5P12N24O2 by Activation of Binary Nitrides ScN and TiN with NH4F</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multinary transition metal nitrides and oxonitrides are a versatile and intriguing class of compounds. However, in comparison to pure oxides, they are much less investigated. The compounds Sc  5  P  12  N  23  O  3  and Ti  5  P  12  N  24  O  2  were now synthesized from the binary nitrides ScN and TiN, respectively, following a high&#8208;pressure high&#8208;temperature approach at 8 GPa and 1400 &#8211; 1700 &#176;C. NH  4  F acts as a mineralizing agent that supports product formation and crystallization. The starting materials ScN and TiN are seemingly an uncommon choice because of their chemical inertness but react nevertheless under these conditions. Sc  5  P  12  N  23  O  3  and Ti  5  P  12  N  24  O  2  crystallize isotypically with Ti  5  B  12  O  26,  consisting of solely vertex&#8208;sharing P(O/N)  4  tetrahedra forming two independent interpenetrating diamond&#8208;like nets which host  TM  (O/N)  6  (  TM  = Sc, Ti) octahedra. Ti  5  P  12  N  24  O  2  is a mixed&#8208;valence compound and shows ordering of Ti  3+  and Ti  4+  ions.</dc:description>

         <title>&#8220;Anti&#8208;electrostatic&#8221; halogen bonding between ions of like charge</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Halogen bonding occurs between molecules featuring Lewis acidic halogen substituents and Lewis bases. It is often rationalized as a predominantly electrostatic interaction and thus interactions between ions of like charge (e.g. of anionic halogen bond donors with halides) seem counter&#8208;intuitive. Herein, we provide an overview on such complexes. First, theoretical studies are described and their findings are compared. Next, experimental evidence is presented in the form of crystal structure database analyses, recent examples of strong &#8220;anti&#8208;electrostatic&#8221; halogen bonding in crystals, and the observation of such interactions also in solution. We then compare these complexes to select examples of &#8220;counter&#8208;intuitive&#8221; adducts formed by other interactions, like hydrogen bonding. Finally, we comment on key differences between charge&#8208;transfer and electrostatic polarization.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced catalytic performance of Quasi&#8208;HKUST&#8208;1 for the tandem Imine Formation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Copper based metal&#8208;organic framework (Cu  3  (BTC)  2  (H  2  O)  3  ]  n  &#183;nH  2  OMeOH (HKUST&#8208;1) has been submitted to thermolysis under air atmosphere at different temperatures ranging from 100 to 300 &#176;C. This treatment produces the partial removal of ligands, the generation of structural defects and additional porosity in a controlled way. The resulting defective materials denoted according to the literature as  quasi  MOFs, were subsequently employed as heterogeneous catalysts in the one pot synthesis of N&#8208;benzylideneaniline from aniline and benzyl alcohol in open air as terminal oxidant at 70 &#176;C under base&#8208; and dehydrating agent&#8208;free conditions. The Q&#8208;HKUST catalysts calcined at 240 &#176;C (QH&#8208;240) was the most efficient in the series, promoting imine synthesis. Data from Knoevenagel condensation of malononitrile shows that in QH&#8208;240 the distances of Cu ions in HKUST&#8208;1 cavities are preserved, increasing the Knoevenagel activity, but a strong rearrangement takes place at 300  o  C or above. The unsaturated copper active sites with simultaneous presence of micro&#8208; and mesopores in QH&#8208;240 are responsible for this excellent catalytic performance. The effective parameters on catalytic activity of QH&#8208;240 including deligandation temperature, the amount of catalyst, the ratio of reactants, and reaction temperature as well as the stability and recyclability of the catalyst were also investigated. The possible mechanism used by QH&#8208;240 follows alcohol aerobic oxidation and subsequent anaerobic condensation of aldehyde intermediate with aniline.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The coordination of tBuNC and CO with the diarsenido complexes, (C5Me5)2An(&#951;2&#8208;As2Mes2), An = Th, U, has been investigated. For the first time, a comparison between isostructural complexes of Th(IV) and U(IV) has been possible with CO, indicating an appreciable amount of &#960; backbonding which originates from charge transfer from an actinide&#8208;arsenic sigma bond according to density functional calculations. The calculated CO stretching frequencies in the Th(IV) and U(IV) diarsenido complexes are consistent with the experimental measurements, both with large red shifts. We demonstrate that the &#960; backbonding is crucial in explaining the red shifts of CO frequency upon An(IV) formation. Interestingly, this interaction essentially correlates to the parallel orientation of &#960;*(C&#8208;O) orbital relative to the An&#8208;As bond.</dc:description>

         <title>Deuterated Indocyanine Green (ICG) With Extended Aqueous

Storage Shelf&#8208;Life: Chemical and Clinical Implications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Indocyanine Green (ICG) is a clinically approved near&#8208;infrared fluorescent dye that is used extensively for various imaging and diagnostic procedures. A drawback with ICG is its instability in water which means that reconstituted clinical doses have to be utilized very shortly after preparation. Two deuterated versions of ICG were prepared with deuterium atoms on the heptamethine chain, and the spectral, physiochemical, and photostability properties were quantified. A notable mechanistic finding is that self&#8208;aggregation of ICG in water strongly favors dye degradation by a photochemical oxidative dimerization reaction that gives a non&#8208;fluorescent product. Storage stability studies showed that replacement of C&#8208;H with C&#8208;D slowed the dimerization rate constant by a factor of 3.1, and it is likely that many medical and pre&#8208;clinical procedures will benefit from the longer shelf&#8208;lives of these two deuterated ICG dyes. The discovery that ICG self&#8208;aggregation promotes photoinduced electron transfer can be exploited as a new paradigm to design next&#8208;generation photodynamic therapies.</dc:description>

         <title>Low&#8208;valent Germanylidene Anions: Efficient Single&#8208;site Nucleophiles for Activation of Small Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rare mononuclear and helical chain low&#8208;valent germanylidene anions supported by cyclic (alkyl)(amino) carbene and hypermetallyl ligands were synthesized by stepwise reduction from corresponding germylene precursors via stable acyclic germanium radicals. The germanylidene anions can be described with ylidene and ylidone resonance forms of which the latter becomes prevalent when engaging with electrophiles. Reactions of CO  2  resulted in the formation of &#956;&#8208;CO  2  &#8208;&#954;C:&#954;O adducts, a previously uncharacterized coordination mode for low&#8208;valent germanium and inaccessible for related neutral ylidones. These results implicate low&#8208;valent germanylidene anions as efficient single&#8208;site nucleophiles for activation of small molecules.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The efficient chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and stereoselective formation of saturated carbon&#8208;carbon fragment is the critical challenge of organic synthesis; therefore, developing new methods for formation of these bonds is paramount. The rising interest for reductive aldol&#8208;type reactions is conditioned by its versatile applications, allowing the efficient formation of carbon&#8208;carbon bonds. The review aims to highlight the advantages and disadvantage of reductive aldol&#8208;type reactions to total synthesis of pharmaceutical substances in order to summarize knowledge, and encourage further investigation of the field.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>1,3&#8208;Diamines are an important class of compounds that are broadly found in natural products and are also widely used as building blocks in organic synthesis. Although the intramolecular C&#8722;H amination of&#160;N&#8208;alkylsulfamide derivatives is a reliable method for the construction of 1,3&#8208;diamine structures, the majority of these methods involve the use of a transition&#8208;metal catalyst. We herein report on a new transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free method using&#160;tert&#8208;butyl hypoiodite (t&#8208;BuOI) or&#160;N&#8208;iodosuccinimide (NIS), enabling secondary non&#8208;benzylic and tertiary C&#8722;H amination reactions to proceed. The cyclic sulfamide products can be easily transformed into 1,3&#8208;diamines. Mechanistic investigations revealed that amination&#160;reactions using&#160;t&#8208;BuOI or NIS each proceed via different pathways.</dc:description>

         <title>Revisiting Alkane Hydroxylation with m&#8208;CPBA (mChloroperbenzoic Acid) Catalyzed by Nickel(II) Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mechanistic studies are performed on the alkane hydroxylation with  m  &#8208;CPBA (  m  &#8208;chloroperbenzoic acid) catalyzed by nickel(II) complexes, Ni  II  (L). In the oxidation of cycloalkanes, Ni  II  (TPA) acts as an efficient catalyst with a high yield and a high alcohol selectivity. In the oxidation of adamantane, the tertiary carbon is predominantly oxidized. The reaction rate shows first&#8208;order dependence on [substrate] and [Ni  II  (L)] but is independent on [  m  CPBA];  v  obs  =  k  2  [substrate][ Ni  II  (L)]. The reaction exhibited a relatively large kinetic deuterium isotope effect (  KIE  ) of 6.7, demonstrating that the hydrogen atom abstraction is involved in the rate&#8208;limiting step of the catalytic cycle. Furthermore, Ni  II  (L) supported by related tetradentate ligands exhibit apparently different catalytic activity, suggesting contribution of the Ni  II  (L) in the catalytic cycle. Based on the kinetic analysis and the significant effects of O  2  and CCl  4  on the product distribution pattern, possible contributions of (L)Ni  II  &#8211;O&#8226; and the acyloxyl radical as the reactive oxidants are discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Atypical And Asymmetric 1,3&#8208;P,N&#8208;Ligands: The Synthesis, Coordination and Catalytic Performance of Cycloiminophosphanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Novel 7&#8208;membered cyclic imine&#8208;based 1,3&#8208;P,N&#8208;ligands were obtained by capturing an  in situ  generated Beckmann nitrilium ion intermediate from cyclohexanone with benzotriazole, and then displacing it by a secondary phosphane under triflic acid promotion. These &#8216;cycloiminophosphanes&#8217; possess flexible non&#8208;isomerizable tetrahydroazepine rings with a high basicity, which sets them apart from previously reported iminophophanes. The donor strength of the ligands was investigated using their P&#8208;&#954;  1  &#8208; and P,N&#8208;&#954;  2  &#8208;tungsten(0) carbonyl complexes, by determining the IR frequency of the  trans  &#8208;CO ligands. Complexes with [RhCp*Cl  2  ]  2  demonstrated the hemilability of the ligands, by giving a dynamic equilibrium of &#954;  1  &#8208; and &#954;  2  &#8208;species; treatment with AgOTf gives full conversion to the &#954;  2  &#8208;complex. The potential for catalysis was shown in the Ru  II  &#8208;catalyzed solvent&#8208;free hydration of benzonitrile and the Ru  II  &#8208; and Ir  I  &#8208;catalyzed transfer hydrogenation of cyclohexanone in isopropanol. Finally, to enable access to asymmetric catalysts, chiral cycloiminophosphanes were prepared from  l  &#8208;menthone, as well as their P,N&#8208;&#954;  2  &#8208;Rh  III  &#8208; and a P&#8208;&#954;  1  &#8208;Ru  II  &#8208;complexes.</dc:description>

         <title>A Structural Diversity of Molecular Alkaline&#8208;Earth&#8208;Metal Polyphosphides: From Supramolecular Wheel to Zintl Ion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of molecular group&#8208;2 polyphosphides has been synthesized by using air&#8208;stable [Cp*Fe(&#951;  5  &#8208;P  5  )] (Cp* = C  5  Me  5  ) or white phosphorus as polyphosphorus precursors. Different types of group&#8208;2 reagents such as organo&#8208;magnesium, mono&#8208;valent magnesium, and molecular calcium&#8208;hydride complexes have been investigated to activate these polyphosphorus sources. The organo&#8208;magnesium complex [(  Dipp  BDI&#8208;Mg(CH  3  ))  2  ] (  Dipp  BDI = {[2,6&#8208;  i  Pr  2  C  6  H  3  NCMe]  2  CH}  &#8722;  ) reacts with [Cp*Fe(&#951;  5  &#8208;P  5  )] to give an unprecedented Mg/Fe&#8208;supramolecular wheel. Kinetically controlled activation of [Cp*Fe(&#951;  5  &#8208;P  5  )] by different mono&#8208;valent magnesium complexes allowed the isolation of Mg&#8208;coordinated formally mono&#8208; and di&#8208;reduced products of [Cp*Fe(&#951;  5  &#8208;P  5  )]. To obtain the first examples of molecular calcium&#8208;polyphosphides, a molecular calcium&#8208;hydride complex was used to reduce the aromatic  cyclo  &#8208;P  5  ring of [Cp*Fe(&#951;  5  &#8208;P  5  )]. The Ca&#8208;Fe&#8208;polyphosphide is also characterized by quantum chemical calculations and compared with the corresponding Mg complex. Moreover, a calcium coordinated Zintl ion (P  7  )  3&#8208;  was obtained by molecular calcium&#8208;hydride mediated P  4  reduction.</dc:description>

         <title>Ca[B8O11(OH)4]:Eu2+&#8722;a Highly Efficient Deep Blue&#8208;emitting Phosphor Prepared by Low&#8208;temperature Self&#8208;reduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Highly efficient inorganic phosphors are crucial for solid&#8208;state lighting. In this paper, a new method of low&#8208;temperature self&#8208;reduction was used for preparing a highly efficient deep blue&#8208;emitting phosphor of Ca[B  8  O11(OH)  4  ]:Eu  2+  (CBH:Eu  2+  ). The crystal structure, morphology, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and photoluminescence (PL) properties of CBH:Eu  2+  phosphor have been investigated. By using a screened hybrid functional (HSE06), the calculated band gap (  E  g  ) of CBH was 7.48 eV. The results shows that almost all the added raw materials of Eu  3+  can be reduced to Eu  2+  in CBH crystal with a non&#8208;reducing atmosphere. The CBH:Eu  2+  phosphor show broad excitation spectrum in the range of 220 to 400 nm, and narrow&#8208;band emission spectrum centered at 428 nm in the range of 400 to 500 nm, with a full width at half maximum (fwhm) of 42.35 nm. Under UV radiation, the CBH: 2%Eu  2+  exhibits high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY=95.0%) and ultra&#8208;high color purity (97.6%). The PL intensity of CBH: 2%Eu  2+  remained 62.6% of the initial intensity at 150  o  C. Finally, the white light&#8208;emitting diodes (WLED) fabricated by CBH:2%Eu  2+  , excited by a 365 nm chip, presents outstanding performances with a luminous efficacy (LE) of 13.9 lm/W, a color rendering index (CRI) of 89.4, and a correlated color temperature (CCT) of 5825 K. The above results show that CBH:Eu  2+  might be used as a promising blue phosphor for WLED. This new method of low&#8208;temperature self&#8208;reduction can be applied to develop and design new type high&#8208;efficiency phosphors.</dc:description>

         <title>Pathway&#8208;Dependent Phase Transitions of Supramolecular Self&#8208;Assemblies Containing Cationic Amphiphiles with Azobenzene and Disulfide Groups</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>There have been several attempts to construct supramolecular chemical systems that mimic the phase transitions in living systems. However, most of these phase transitions are one&#8208;to&#8208;one and induced by one stimulus or chemical; there have been few reports on the pathway&#8208;dependent phase transition of supramolecular self&#8208;assemblies in multi&#8208;step. To induce multistep phase transitions, we prepared molecular crystals containing a cationic amphiphile having azobenzene and disulfide groups. A reducing agent caused the crystals to become vesicles, and adjacent, non&#8208;touching vesicles fused under UV and subsequent visible light. Adding a reducing agent to the worm&#8208;like aggregates that were generated after UV irradiation of the original crystals resulted in the growth of sheet&#8208;like aggregates. 1H NMR and fluorescence anisotropy measurements showed that a series of phase transitions was induced by changes in the phase structures from molecular conversions of the reactive amphiphiles. The multiple pathway&#8208;dependent phase transitions of supramolecular self&#8208;assemblies can provide a methodology for developing new stimuli&#8208;responsive materials that exhibit the desirable properties under specific circumstances from Systems Chemistry viewpoint.</dc:description>

         <title>Galactose Grafted Two&#8208;Dimensional Nanosheets as a Scaffold for the In&#8208;situ Synthesis of Silver Nanoparticles: A Potential Catalyst for the Reduction of Nitroaromatics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two major hurdles in NP&#8208;based catalysis are the aggregation of the NPs and their recycling. Immobilization of NPs onto a 2D support is the most promising strategy to overcome these difficulties. Herein, amphiphilicity&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly of galactose&#8208;hexaphenylbenzene based amphiphiles into galactose&#8208;decorated 2D nanosheet is reported. The extremely dense decoration of reducing sugar on the surface of the sheets is used for the in&#8208;situ synthesis and immobilization of ultrafine catalytically active AgNPs by using Tollens&#8217; reaction. The potential of the system as a catalyst for the reduction of various nitroaromatics is demonstrated. Enhanced catalytic activity is observed for the immobilized AgNPs when compared to the corresponding discrete AgNPs. Recovery of the catalytic system from the reaction mixture by ultrafiltration and its subsequent recycling for several cycles without dropping its activity is shown. This is the first report demonstrating the in&#8208;situ synthesis and immobilization of ultrafine AgNPs onto a 2D nanosheet that exhibits excellent catalytic performance for the reduction of nitroaromatics.</dc:description>

         <title>Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free C2&#8208;Functionalization of Pyridines through Aryne Three&#8208;Component Coupling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Getting into position: Aryne multicomponent coupling triggered by pyridines allows the broad&#8208;scope synthesis of C2&#8208;substituted pyridines bearing a &#8722;CF3 group by engaging &#945;,&#945;,&#945;&#8208;trifluoroacetophenones as the third component. Activated keto esters could also be used as the third component in this formal 1,2&#8208;di(hetero)arylation of ketones. Performing the reaction under dilute conditions inhibited the competing pyridine&#8211;aryne polymerization pathway.







Abstract
The direct C2&#8208;functionalization of pyridines through a transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free protocol by using aryne multicomponent coupling is demonstrated. The reaction allowed a broad&#8208;scope synthesis of C2&#8208;substituted pyridine derivatives bearing the &#8722;CF3 group in good yields with &#945;,&#945;,&#945;&#8208;trifluoroacetophenones as the third component. Activated keto esters could also be employed as the third component in this formal 1,2&#8208;di(hetero)arylation of ketones. Performing the reaction under dilute conditions inhibited the competing pyridine&#8211;aryne polymerization pathway. Nucleophilic attack by the initially generated pyridylidene intermediate on the carbonyl followed by an SNAr process resembling the Smiles rearrangement affords the desired products.

         <title>An Adjustable Cleft Based on an 8&#8208;sulfonamide&#8208;2&#8208;naphthoic Acid with Oxyanion Hole Geometry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cleft type receptors showing the oxyanion hole motif have been prepared in a straightforward synthesis starting from the commercial 3,7&#8208;dihidroxy&#8208;2&#8208;naphthoic acid. The double H&#8208;bond donor pattern is achieved by the introduction of a sulfonamide group in the C&#8208;8 position of naphthalene and a carboxamide at the C&#8208;2 position. This cleft, whose geometry resembles that of an oxyanion hole, is able to adjust to different guests, as shown by the analysis of the X&#8208; ray crystal structures of associates with methanol or acetic acid. Combination of hydrogen bonds and charge&#8208;transfer interactions led to further stabilization of the complexes, in which the electron&#8208;rich aromatic ring of the receptor was close in space to the electron&#8208;deficient dinitroaromatic guests. Modelling studies and bidimensional NMR experiments have been carried out to provide additional information.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>
New gallate&#8208;TAAILs (imidazolium&#8208;based tunable aryl alkyl ionic liquids) containing the weakly coordinating tetrakis(pentafluoroethyl)gallate anion, [Ga(C2F5)4]&#8208;, are promising candidates as electrolytes in electrochemical applications. Phenyl and phenyl derivatives (2&#8208;Me, 4&#8208;OMe, 2,4&#8208;F) in combination with different alkyl chain lengths from 1&#8211;12 carbon atoms were investigated with regard to their viscosity, conductivity and electrochemical window and compared to EMIM and BMIM standard cations. Contrary to the gallate&#8208;TAAIls, the EMIM and BMIM gallates show electrochemical instability.

Phenyl and phenyl derivatives (2&#8208;Me, 4&#8208;OMe, 2,4&#8208;F) were combined with varying alkyl chain lengths at the imidazolium core leading to TAAILs, which were investigated with regard to their viscosity, conductivity, and electrochemical window and compared to EMIM and BMIM standard cations. Remarkable low viscosities of 29 cP at 25&#8201;&#176;C for [BMIM][Ga(C2F5)4] were achieved. However, the EMIM and BMIM gallates show electrochemical instability, releasing pentafluoroethane at a voltage of 1.5&#8197;V. The 2&#8208;Me&#8208;substituted gallate&#8208;TAAILs slowly decompose over several weeks, whereas all other gallate&#8208;TAAILs showed no decomposition at all. With electrochemical windows of up to 5.15&#8197;V and low viscosities in a range of 66&#8211;162&#8197;cP, the gallate&#8208;TAAILs are promising candidates as electrolytes in electrochemical applications.

         <title>DNA&#8208;Triggered Enhancement of Singlet Oxygen Production by Pyridinium Alkynylanthracenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New pyridinium alkynylanthracenes are capable to generate singlet oxygen upon irradiation with green light only, when bound to polynucleotides by intercalation, whereas they slowly decompose when irradiated in water showing poor sensitization activity. Enhanced sensitization activity is observed upon interaction with AT but not GC base pairs. This makes them interesting for applications, where singlet oxygen has to be generated with local control.







Abstract
There is an ongoing interest in 1O2 sensitizers, whose activity is selectively controlled by their interaction with DNA. To this end, we synthesized three isomeric pyridinium alkynylanthracenes 2&#8201;o&#8211;p and a water&#8208;soluble trapping reagent for 1O2. In water and in the absence of DNA, these dyes show a poor efficiency to sensitize the photooxygenation of the trapping reagent as they decompose due to electron transfer processes. In contrast, in the presence of DNA 1O2 is generated from the excited DNA&#8208;bound ligand. The interactions of 2&#8201;o&#8211;p with DNA were investigated by thermal DNA melting studies, UV/vis and fluorescence spectroscopy, and linear and circular dichroism spectroscopy. Our studies revealed an intercalative binding with an orientation of the long pyridyl&#8208;alkynyl axis parallel to the main axis of the DNA base pairs. In the presence of poly(dA&#8201;:&#8201;dT), all three isomers show an enhanced formation of singlet oxygen, as indicated by the reaction of the latter with the trapping reagent. With green light irradiation of isomer 2&#8201;o in poly(dA&#8201;:&#8201;dT), the conversion rate of the trapping reagent is enhanced by a factor &gt;10. The formation of 1O2 was confirmed by control experiments under anaerobic conditions, in deuterated solvents, or by addition of 1O2 quenchers. When bound to poly(dG&#8201;:&#8201;dC), the opposite effect was observed only for isomers 2&#8201;o and 2&#8201;m, namely the trapping reagent reacted significantly slower. Overall, we showed that pyridinium alkynylanthracenes are very useful intercalators, that exhibit an enhanced photochemical 1O2 generation in the DNA&#8208;bound state.

With green light irradiation of isomer &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;&#8201;
&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;o&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; in poly(dA&#8201;:&#8201;dT), the conversion rate of the trapping reagent is enhanced by a factor &amp;gt;10. The formation of &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was confirmed by control experiments under anaerobic conditions, in deuterated solvents, or by addition of &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; quenchers. When bound to poly(dG&#8201;:&#8201;dC), the opposite effect was observed only for isomers &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;&#8201;
&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;o&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;&#8201;
&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;b&gt;m&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;, namely the trapping reagent reacted significantly slower. Overall, we showed that pyridinium alkynylanthracenes are very useful intercalators, that exhibit an enhanced photochemical &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; generation in the DNA-bound state.&lt;/p&gt;

In the metastable type&#8208;II clathrate Na24&#8211;&#948;Ge136, a Ge framework forms 20&#8208; and 28&#8208;atom cages (drawn with gray and bluish faces) hosting the Na guest atoms. The stopwatch hands give the actual number of Na atoms found per unit cell. In type&#8208;II clathrates, the guest atoms arrange with hierarchical relation to the C15 Laves phase and the oxygen partial structure of &#946;&#8208;Cristobalite. The latter is shown by white lines between Na atoms, turning red where only this partial structure is drawn. More information can be found in the Full Paper by B. B&#246;hme et&#8197;al.

         <title>The Impact of C2 Insertion into a Carbazole Donor on the Physicochemical Properties of Dibenzo[a,j]phenazine&#8208;Cored Donor&#8211;Acceptor&#8211;Donor Triads</title>

Plus 2: C2 insertion into well&#8208;known electron&#8208;donating carbazole unit brought about a drastic change in the physicochemical properties of dibenzo[a,j]phenazine&#8208;core twisted donor&#8211;acceptor&#8211;donor triad compounds. The slight structural modification at the donor unit led to a thermodynamic preference for quasi&#8208;axial conformations, dual emission comprising room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence and triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation, and unique electrochemical behavior.







Abstract
Novel electron donor&#8211;acceptor&#8211;donor (D&#8208;A&#8208;D) compounds comprising dibenzo[a,j]phenazine as the central acceptor core and two 7&#8208;membered diarylamines (iminodibenzyl and iminostilbene) as the donors have been designed and synthesized. Investigation of their physicochemical properties revealed the impact of C2 insertion into well&#8208;known carbazole electron donors on the properties of previously reported twisted dibenzo[a,j]phenazine&#8208;core D&#8208;A&#8208;D triads. Slight structural modification caused a drastic change in conformational preference, allowing unique photophysical behavior of dual emission derived from room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence and triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation. Furthermore, electrochemical analysis suggested sigma&#8208;dimer formation and electrochemical polymerization on the electrode. Quantum chemical calculations also rationalized the experimental results.

         <title>Double&#8208;Shelled Hollow SiO2@N&#8208;C Nanofiber Boosts the Lithium Storage Performance of [PMo12O40]3&#8722;</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Excellent lithium storage was achieved by the double&#8208;shelled hollow PMo12&#8722;SiO2@N&#8722;C nanocomposites. The outermost N&#8722;C shell can improve the electronic conductivity and promote the dispersion of PMo12 clusters. The SiO2 inner shell can efficiently avoid the loss of active components. The hollow structure can benefit a faster lithium&#8208;ion kinetics by shorten lithium&#8208;ion diffusion path and buffer volume expansion during lithiation/delithiation process. And PMo12, as an electron sponge, can greatly reduce charge&#8208;resistance and accelerate electron transfer of the composite.







Abstract
Polyoxometalates (POMs)&#8208;based materials, with high theoretical capacities and abundant reversible multi&#8208;electron redox properties, are considered as promising candidates in lithium&#8208;ion storage. However, the poor electronic conductivity, low specific surface area and high solubility in the electrolyte limited their practical applications. Herein, a double&#8208;shelled hollow PMo12&#8722;SiO2@N&#8722;C nanofiber (PMo12&#8722;SiO2@N&#8722;C, where PMo12 is [PMo12O40]3&#8722;, N&#8722;C is nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon) was fabricated for the first time by combining coaxial electrospinning technique, thermal treatment and electrostatic adsorption. As an anode material for LIBs, the PMo12&#8722;SiO2@N&#8722;C delivered an excellent specific capacity of 1641&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 1000 cycles under 2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. The excellent electrochemical performance benefited from the unique double&#8208;shelled hollow structure of the material, in which the outermost N&#8722;C shell cannot only hinder the agglomeration of PMo12, but also improve its electronic conductivity. The SiO2 inner shell can efficiently avoid the loss of active components. The hollow structure can buffer the volume expansion and accelerate Li+ diffusion during lithiation/delithiation process. Moreover, PMo12 can greatly reduce charge&#8208;resistance and facilitate electron transfer of the entire composites, as evidenced by the EIS kinetics study and lithium&#8208;ion diffusion analysis. This work paves the way for the fabrication of novel POM&#8208;based LIBs anode materials with excellent lithium storage performance.

         <title>NIR&#8208;Emissive Chromium(0), Molybdenum(0), and Tungsten(0) Complexes in the Solid State at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents emissive Cr(0), Mo(0) and W(0) complexes that contain a bidentate pyridyl&#8208;mesoionic carbene ligand and CO coligands. These systems exhibit dual visible and NIRII emission at room temperature and represent a milestone in the design of noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free NIR luminophores. The emissive excited states were characterized by luminescence lifetime investigations and step&#8208;scan FTIR spectroscopy, supported by density functional theory. The NIR quantum yield increases from Cr(0) via Mo(0) to W(0), reaching a very high value at room temperature. More information can be found in the Communication by M. Gerhards, B. Sarkar et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202102208).

The very low basicity and nucleophilicity of the phosphorus donor in phosphinines can be drastically increased by introducing strongly &#963;&#8208;donating Me3Si substituents to the aromatic phosphorus heterocycle. The highest gas&#8208;phase basicity was found for 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrakis(trimethylsilyl)phosphinine, which is even more basic in the gas phase than pyridine. This finding led to the first quantitative synthesis of a phosphinine selenide by treating red selenium with 2,6&#8208;bis(trimethylsilyl)phosphinine. More information can be found in the Full Paper by T. B&#246;ttcher, C. M&#252;ller, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202102390).

         <title>In&#8208;Fjord Substitution in Expanded Helicenes: Effects of the Insert on the Inversion Barrier and Helical Pitch</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Deep in&#8208;fjord substitution is presented as a new tool to control the mechanical properties of expanded helicenes. The syntheses of a series of these compounds containing internal inserts is described and their overall inversion profile is calculated. Interestingly, the interplay between steric and dispersion interactions play a major role in shape of the inversion profiles (energies, number of transition states and intermediates).







Abstract
A series of expanded helicenes of different sizes and shapes incorporating phenyl&#8208; and biphenyl&#8208;substituents at the deepest part of their fjord have been synthesized via sequential Au&#8208;catalyzed hydroarylation of appropriately designed diynes, and their racemization barriers have been calculated employing electronic structure methods. These show that the overall profile of the inversions (energies, number of transition states and intermediates, and their relative position) is intensively affected by the interplay of steric and attractive London dispersion interactions. Hence, in&#8208;fjord substitution constitutes an additional tool to handle the mechanical properties in helicenes of uncommonly large diameter. The photochemical characterization of the newly prepared helical structures is also reported.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of Primary and Secondary Aliphatic Amines via Mild and Selective sp3 C&#8211;H Imination</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The direct replacement of sp3 C&#8208;H bonds with simple amine units (&#8208;NH2) remains synthetically challenging, although primary aliphatic amines are ubiquitous in medicinal chemistry and natural product synthesis. We report a mild and selective protocol for preparing primary and secondary aliphatic amines in a single pot, based on intermolecular sp3 C&#8208;H imination. The first C&#8208;H imination of diverse alkanes, this method shows useful site&#8208;selectivity within substrates bearing multiple sp3 C&#8208;H bonds. Furthermore, this reaction tolerates polar functional groups relevant for complex molecule synthesis, highlighted in the synthesis of amine pharmaceuticals and amination of natural products. We characterize a unique C&#8208;H imination mechanism based on radical rebound to an iminyl radical, supported by kinetic isotope effects, stereoablation, resubmission, and computational modeling. This work constitutes a selective method for complex amine synthesis and a new mechanistic platform for C&#8208;H amination.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Si x Ge y alloys are emerging materials for modern semiconductor technology. Well&#8208;defined model systems of the bulk structures aid in understanding their intrinsic characteristics. Three such model clusters have now been realized in the form of the Si x Ge y heteroadamantanes [0] , [1] , and [2] via selective one&#8208;pot syntheses starting from Me 2 GeCl 2 , Si 2 Cl 6 , and [nBu 4 N]Cl. Compound [0] contains 6 GeMe 2 and 4 SiSiCl 3 vertices, while one and two of the GeMe 2 groups are replaced by SiCl 2 moieties in compounds [1] and [2] , respectively. Chloride ion&#8208;mediated rearrangement quantitatively converts [2] into [1] at room temperature and finally into [0] at 60 &#176;C, which is not only remarkable in view of the rigidity of these cage structures but also sheds light on the assembly mechanism.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The on&#8208;surface dehydrogenation of bispentahelicene on a gold(111) surface has been studied by means of scanning tunneling microscopy. Deposition of 2,2&#8217;&#8208;Bispentahelicene onto a gold surface in ultrahigh vacuum leads exclusively to formation of the homochiral (M,M)&#8208; and (P,P)&#8208; diastereomers. Thermally induced cyclodehydrogenation proceeds then enantiospecifically into planar coronocoronene that breaks mirror symmetry due to surface confinement.

         <title>Isomerization of Functionalized Olefins Using the Dinuclear Catalyst [PdI(&#956;&#8208;Br)(PtBu3)]2: A Mechanistic Study.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In a combined experimental and computational study, the isomerization activity of the dinuclear palladium(I) complex [Pd  I  (  &#956;  &#8208;Br)(P  t  Bu  3  )]  2  towards allyl arenes, esters, amides, ethers, and alcohols has been investigated. The calculated energy profiles for catalyst activation, for two alternative dinuclear and mononuclear catalytic cycles, and for catalyst deactivation are in good agreement with the experimental results. The comparison of experimentally observed  E  /  Z  ratios at incomplete conversion with the calculated kinetic selectivities revealed that a substantial amount of product must form via the  dinuclear pathway  , in which the isomerization is promoted cooperatively by two palladium centers. The dissociation barrier towards mononuclear Pd species is relatively high, and once the catalyst enters the energetically more favorable  mononuclear pathway  , only a low barrier has to be overcome towards irreversible deactivation.</dc:description>

         <title>A Porphyrin&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Framework for Metal&#8208;Free Photocatalytic Aerobic Oxidative Coupling of Amines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Imine is an important intermediate in drug synthesis. Photocatalytic aerobic oxidative coupling of amines has been considered as a clean and promising way to produce imine and attracted great attentions. Herein, we designed and synthesized a novel two&#8208;dimensional porphyrin&#8208;based COF (Por&#8208;BC&#8208;COF) which adopts an AA stacking mode with excellent crystallinity, high Brunauer&#8211;Emmett&#8211;Teller surface areas (1200 m 2 g &#8208;1 ), wide light absorption range (200&#8208;1300 nm) and good stability in a variety of organic solvents. Por&#8208;BC&#8208;COF can be used as a metal&#8208;free heterogeneous photocatalyst for the photocatalytic oxidation of amines to imines under visible light and red light with a high yield (97%). This work presents a novel and efficient COF photocatalyst in the application of light&#8208;driven organic synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Sensitive and Ultra&#8208;Stretchable Strain Sensors Based on Emulsion Gels with Broad Operating Temperature</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High stretchability (more than 1000&#8201;%) and conductivity (0.67&#8197;S/m) emulsion gels were fabricated from emulsions and the introduction of glycerol endowed them with broad operating temperature (&#8722;20 to 90&#8201;&#176;C). The emulsion gel based strain sensors showed high sensitivity (gauge factor=6.240), fatigue resistance, self&#8208;healing and adhesion properties, realizing the repeatable and accurate detection of full&#8208;range human motions.







Abstract
Hydrogels with mechanical elasticity and conductivity are ideal materials in wearable devices. However, traditional hydrogels are fragile upon mechanical loading and lose functions in climate change because the internal water undergoes freeze and dehydration. Herein, we synthesize stable emulsions at high and low temperatures by introducing glycerol into the W/W emulsions. Then the high&#8208;stable emulsions are used as templates to produce the freestanding emulsion gels with enhanced mechanical strength and conductivity. The introduction of glycerol endows emulsions and emulsion gels with high and low temperature resistance (&#8722;20 to 90&#8201;&#176;C). The fabricated strain sensors based on emulsion gels show high sensitivity (gauge factor=6.240), high stretchability (1081&#8201;%), fatigue resistance, self&#8208;healing and adhesion properties, realizing the repeatable and accurate detection of various human motions. These high&#8208;performance and eco&#8208;friendly emulsion gels can be promising candidates for next&#8208;generation artificial skin and human&#8208;machine interface.

         <title>A Chiral Molecular Cage Comprising Diethynylallenes and N&#8208;Heterotriangulenes for Enantioselective Recognition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It's a match! A novel shape&#8208;persistent chiral cage constituting two N&#8208;heterotriangulene lids and three bis(diethynylallene) branches is reported, along with UV/vis complexation studies with both charged and neutral helicenes. Enantioselective discrimination was observed, which, in combination with the redox behavior of the host, makes the system appealing as a model for dual sensors with both chiral and electronic modulation.







Abstract
Chirality, a characteristic tool of molecular recognition in nature, is often a complement of redox active systems. Scientists, in their eagerness to mimic such sophistication, have designed numerous chiral systems based on molecular entities with cavities, such as macrocycles and cages. In an attempt to combine chirality and redox&#8208;active species, in this contribution we report the synthesis and detailed characterization of a chiral shape&#8208;persistent molecular cage based on the combination of enantiopure diethynylallenes and electron&#8208;rich bridged triarylamines, also known as N&#8208;heterotriangulenes. Its ability for chiral recognition in solution was revealed through UV/vis titrations with enantiopure helicenes.

         <title>Modulating the Enantiodiscrimination Features of Inherently Chiral Selectors by Molecular Design: A HPLC and Voltammetry Study Case with Atropisomeric 2,2&#8217;&#8208;Biindole&#8208;Based Monomers and Oligomer Films</title>

         <dc:description>
A series of inherently chiral electroactive selectors based on the 2,2&#8217;&#8208;biindole atropisomeric scaffold is studied in two enantiodiscrimination contests: as probes in enantioselective HPLC and as selectors in chiral voltammetry for successful discrimination of the enantiomers of chiral electroactive probes, either by conversion into enantiopure electroactive electrode surfaces or as chiral additive in achiral ionic liquid.







Abstract
A family of inherently chiral electroactive selectors based on the 2,2&#8217;&#8208;biindole atropisomeric scaffold, of easy synthesis and modulable functional properties, is studied in cascade in two enantioselection contexts. They are at first investigated as probes in enantioselective HPLC, studying molecular structure and temperature effects, and achieving very efficient semipreparative enantioseparation. The enantiomers thus obtained, of remarkable chiroptical features (optical rotation as well as circular dichroism), are successfully applied as selectors in chiral voltammetry in different media for discrimination of the enantiomers of chiral electroactive probes, either by conversion into enantiopure electroactive electrode surfaces by electrooligomerization on glassy carbon substrate (the two monomers with shorter alkyl chains), or as chiral additive in achiral ionic liquid (the monomer with longest alkyl chains). Discrimination is conveniently and reproducibly achieved in terms of significant potential differences for the two enantiomers, specularly inverting either probe or selector configuration. In one case successful discrimination is also observed with the two probe enantiomers concurrently present, either as racemate or with enantiomeric excesses, neatly accounted for by the peak current ratios.

         <title>Engineered Cyclotides with Potent Broad in Vitro and in Vivo Antimicrobial Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
ESKAPE kit: A novel engineered cyclotide has effective broad&#8208;spectrum antibacterial activity against several ESKAPE bacterial clinical isolates. The most active antibacterial cyclotide showed high in vivo efficacy against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a human pathogen known to produce chronic lung infection in humans. These findings suggest the possibility of designing novel therapeutics based on the cyclotide scaffold. More information can be found in the Full Paper by J.&#8197;A. Camarero et&#8197;al.

         <title>Hydrophobic Metal&#8722;Organic Frameworks and Derived Composites for Microelectronics Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Don't rain on my parade: Hydrophobic metal&#8722;&#959;rganic frameworks (MOFs) and derived composites for microelectronics applications are highlighted. Several methodologies including the incorporation of long alkyl chains and fluorinated linkers, doping with redox&#8208;active species, etc., to produce hydrophobic MOFs with improved dielectric and conductivity properties are discussed.







Abstract
The extraordinary characteristic features of metal&#8722;organic frameworks (MOFs) make them applicable for use in a variety of fields but their conductivity in microelectronics over a wide relative humidity (RH) range has not been extensively explored. To achieve good performance, MOFs must be stable in water, i.&#8201;e., under humid conditions. However, the design of ultrastable hydrophobic MOFs with high conductivity for use in microelectronics as conducting and dielectric materials remains a challenge. In this Review, we discuss applications of an emerging class of hydrophobic MOFs with respect to their use as active sensor coatings, tunable low&#8208;&#954; dielectrics and conductivity, which provide high&#8208;level roadmap for stimulating the next steps toward the development and implementation of hydrophobic MOFs for use in microelectronic devices. Several methodologies including the incorporation of long alkyl chain and fluorinated linkers, doping of redox&#8208;active 7,7,8,8&#8208;tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ), the use of guest molecules, and conducting polymers or carbon materials in the pores or surface of MOFs have been utilized to produce hydrophobic MOFs. The contact angle of a water droplet and a coating can be used to evaluate the degree of hydrophobicity of the surface of a MOF. These unique advantages enable hydrophobic MOFs to be used as a highly versatile platform for exploring multifunctional porous materials. Classic representative examples of each category are discussed in terms of coordination structures, types of hydrophobic design, and potential microelectronic applications. Lastly, a summary and outlook as concluding remarks in this field are presented. We envision that future research in the area of hydrophobic MOFs promise to provide important breakthroughs in microelectronics applications.

         <title>Ready Access to Anhydrous Anionic Lanthanide Acetates by Using Imidazolium Acetate Ionic Liquids as the Reaction Medium</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A straightforward pathway to synthesize anhydrous lanthanide acetate complexes from lanthanide chloride hydrates and the ionic liquid (IL) 1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium acetate ([C2mim][OAc]) is described. The combination of the lanthanide size and the amount of IL introduced allows the selective formation of two isostructural crystalline anhydrous compounds the dimeric, [C2mim]2[Ln2(OAc)8], and the polymeric, [C2mim]n[{Ln2(OAc)7}n].







Abstract
Access to lanthanide acetate coordination compounds is challenged by the tendency of lanthanides to coordinate water and the plethora of acetate coordination modes. A straightforward, reproducible synthetic procedure by treating lanthanide chloride hydrates with defined ratios of the ionic liquid (IL) 1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium acetate ([C2mim][OAc]) has been developed. This reaction pathway leads to two isostructural crystalline anhydrous coordination complexes, the polymeric [C2mim]n[{Ln2(OAc)7}n] and the dimeric [C2mim]2[Ln2(OAc)8], based on the ion size and the ratio of IL used. A reaction with an IL&#8201;:&#8201;Ln&#8208;salt ratio of 5&#8201;:&#8201;1, where Ln=Nd, Sm, and Gd, led exclusively to the polymer, whilst for the heaviest lanthanides (Dy&#8722;Lu) the dimer was observed. Reaction with Eu and Tb resulted in a mixture of both polymeric and dimeric forms. When the amount of IL and/or the size of the cation was increased, the reaction led to only the dimeric compound for all the lanthanide series. Crystallographic analyses of the resulting salts revealed three different types of metal&#8208;acetate coordination modes where &#951;2&#956;&#954;2 is the most represented in both structure types.

         <title>Dicyano&#8208;Imidazole: A Facile Generation of Pure Blue TADF Materials for OLEDs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pure blue&#8208;emitting organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) based on dicyano&#8208;imidazole with thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) have been studied at Providence University (of which a building is shown). The efficiencies obtained in this work are the highest among the reported imidazole&#8208;based TADF&#8208;OLEDs. By combining these tailor&#8208;made TADF compounds with specific device architectures, electroluminescent emission from sky blue to deep blue could be achieved. More information can be found in the Full Paper by C.&#8208;W. Lu et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101807).

         <title>Stability of AgIII towards Halides in Organosilver(III) Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surprising silver: The binary silver(I) halides, AgX, are well&#8208;known chemical species. In contrast, the only binary halide of silver(III) currently known is the fluoride AgF3. The CF3 group provides a suitable frame to stabilise silver(III) compounds with every halogen; these have been isolated and thoroughly characterised. Multistage unimolecular fragmentation experiments demonstrate that the Ag&#8722;X bond is surprisingly robust. The sobriety of silver thus perfectly matches the colourful variety of halogens. More information can be found in the Full Paper by B. Menj&#243;n et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101859).

         <title>Towards an understanding of the molecular mechanisms of variable unnatural base pair behavior&#8212;A biophysical analysis of dNaM&#8208;dTPT3</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The series of unnatural base pairs (UBPs) developed by the Romesberg lab which pair via hydrophobic and packing interactions have been replicated, transcribed, and translated inside of a living organism. However, as to why these UBPs exhibit variable fidelity and efficiency when used in different contexts is not clear. In an effort to gain some insights, we investigated the thermal stability and pairing selectivity of the (d) NaM &#8208;(d) TPT3 UBP in 11nt duplexes via UV spectroscopy and the effects on helical structure via CD spectroscopy. We observed that while the duplexes containing a UBP are less stable than fully natural duplexes, they are generally more stable than duplexes containing natural mispairs. This work provides the first insights connecting the thermal stability of the (d) NaM &#8208;(d) TPT3 UBP to the molecular mechanisms for varying replication fidelity in different sequence contexts in DNA, asymmetrical transcription fidelity, and codon:anticodon interactions and can assist in future UBP development.</dc:description>

         <title>Simultaneous Tuning Band Gaps of Cu2O and TiO2&#160;to&#160;form&#160;S&#8208;Scheme Hetero&#8208;Photocatalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic Z or S scheme merits higher redox potentials and faster charge separation. However, heterostructure photocatalyst having band gaps of bulk materials often has a type I band structure leading to poor photocatalytic activity. In view of this, we report simultaneous tuning of band gaps of Cu  2  O and TiO  2  , where quantum dot Cu  2  O nanoparticles were formed on doped TiO  2  with Ti  3+  .  The shrunk size of Cu  2  O made its conduction band more negative while the introduction of Ti  3+  made absorption edge red shift to visible light region. The as&#8208;formed heterostructure enabled S&#8208;Scheme mechanism with remarkable activity and stability for visible light photodegradation of 4&#8208;chlorophenol (4&#8208;CP). The as&#8208;obtained photocatalysts&#8217; activity demonstrated ca. 510 folds increase as compared to individual ones and mechanical blend. The as&#8208;obtained photocatalysts maintained over 80% for 5 cycles and 2 months exposure to O  2  did not decrease degradation rate. ESR characterization and scavengers&#8217; experiments proved S&#8208;Scheme mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Titanium Vacancies in TiO2 Nanofibers Enable Highly Efficient Photo&#8208;Driven Seawater Splitting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photo&#8208;driven seawater splitting is considered as one of the most promising techniques for sustainable hydrogen production. However, the high salinity of seawater would deactivate catalysts and consumes the photogenerated carriers. Metal vacancies in metal oxide semiconductors are critical to directed electron transfer and high salinity resistance, thus desirable but remains a challenge. We demonstrate a facile controllable calcination approach to synthesize TiO  2  nanofibers with rich Ti&#8208;vacancies with excellent photo/electro performances and long&#8208;time stability in photo&#8208;driven seawater splitting, including photocatalysis and photoelectrocatalysis. Experimental measurements and theoretical calculations reveal the formation of titanium vacancies, as well as its unidirectional electron trap and superior H  +  adsorption ability for efficient charge transfer and corrosion resistance of seawater. Therefore, the characteristics and mechanism have been proposed at an atomic&#8208;/nanoscale to clarify the generation of titanium vacancies and the corresponding interfacial electron transfer.</dc:description>

         <title>A Water Molecule Triggers Guest Exchange at a Mono&#8208;Zinc Centre Confined in a Biomimetic Calixarene Pocket: a Model for Understanding Ligand Stability in Zn Proteins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ligand exchange mechanism at a ZnII centre embedded in a calix[6]arene pocket mimicking the constrains induced by a proteic structure was probed by 1D EXSY NMR experiments and DFT calculations. Results highlight: i) the very high kinetic stability of a tetrahedral ZnII centre when coordination of a fifth ligand is precluded by the environment, ii) the necessary associative double&#8208;exchange mechanism for ligand exchange, and iii) the key role that a single water molecule can play in catalysing the exchange.







Abstract
In this study, the ligand exchange mechanism at a biomimetic ZnII centre, embedded in a pocket mimicking the possible constrains induced by a proteic structure, is explored. The residence time of different guest ligands (dimethylformamide, acetonitrile and ethanol) inside the cavity of a calix[6]arene&#8208;based tris(imidazole) tetrahedral zinc complex was probed using 1D EXchange SpectroscopY NMR experiments. A strong dependence of residence time on water content was observed with no exchange occurring under anhydrous conditions, even in the presence of a large excess of guest ligand. These results advocate for an associative exchange mechanism involving the transient exo&#8208;coordination of a water molecule, giving rise to 5&#8208;coordinate ZnII intermediates, and inversion of the pyramid at the ZnII centre. Theoretical modelling by DFT confirmed that the associative mechanism is at stake. These results are particularly relevant in the context of the understanding of kinetic stability/lability in Zn proteins and highlight the key role that a single water molecule can play in catalysing ligand exchange and controlling the lability of ZnII in proteins.

         <title>Progress and Perspectives on Covalent&#8208;organic Frameworks (COFs) and Composites for Various Energy Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent&#8208;organic frameworks (COFs) outline a resourceful illustration by uniting the remarkable properties of materials such as structural and chemical modulation, porosity and crystallinity, which can be productive for different types of metal&#8208;ion batteries, supercapacitors, water splitting (Hydrogen evolution reaction, HER and Oxygen evolution reaction, OER) and solar cells.







Abstract
Covalent&#8208;organic frameworks (COFs), being a new member of the crystalline porous materials family, have emerged as important materials for energy storage/conversion/generation devices. They possess high surface areas, ordered micro/mesopores, designable structures and an ability to precisely control electro&#8208;active groups in their pores, which broaden their application window. Thanks to their low weight density, long range crystallinity, reticular nature and tunable synthesis approach towards two and three dimensional (2D and 3D) networks, they have been found suitable for a range of challenging electrochemical applications. Our review focuses on the progress made on the design, synthesis and structure of COFs and their composites for various energy applications, such as metal&#8208;ion batteries, supercapacitors, water&#8208;splitting and solar cells. Additionally, attempts have been made to correlate the structural and mechanistic characteristics of COFs with their applications.

         <title>Design, Synthesis, Evaluation and Structure of Allenic 1&#945;,25&#8208;Dihydroxyvitamin D3 Analogs with Locked Mobility at C&#8208;17</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Looking for side&#8208;chain conformational requirements of vitamin D analogs for selective biological activity, a new active vitamin D analog that has conformationally restricted mobility at the side chain and adopts a similar structure than the natural hormone 1&#945;,25&#8208;dihydroxyvitamin D3 in the binding pocket was designed by docking and synthesized. The highlights of the synthesis include a Pd0&#8208;catalyzed cascade and an orthoester&#8208;Claisen&#8208;rearrangement for the formation of the trienic system and the allenic side&#8208;chain, respectively.







Abstract
Vitamin D receptor ligands have potential for the treatment of hyperproliferative diseases and disorders related to the immune system. However, hypercalcemic effects limit their therapeutical uses and call for the development of tissue&#8208;selective new analogs. We have designed and synthesized the first examples of 1&#945;,25&#8208;dihydroxyvitamin D3 analogs bearing an allenic unit attached to the D ring to restrict the side&#8208;chain conformational mobility. The triene system was constructed by a Pd0&#8208;mediated cyclization/Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling process in the presence of an allenic side chain. The allenic moiety was built through an orthoester&#8208;Claisen rearrangement of a propargylic alcohol. The biological activity and structure of (22S)&#8208;1&#945;,25&#8208;dihydroxy&#8208;17,20&#8208;dien&#8208;24&#8208;homo&#8208;21&#8208;nor&#8208;vitamin D3 bound to binding domain of the vitamin D receptor, provide information concerning side&#8208;chain conformational requirements for biological activity.

         <title>Molecular Recognition of Nerve Agents and Their Organophosphorus Surrogates: Toward Supramolecular Scavengers and Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nerve agents are lethal organophosphorus compounds (OPs), posing a serious threat to military and civilians. In spite of decades invested toward developing detoxifying systems acting as prophylactics or therapeutics, there has been insufficient progress. In this critical review, we posit that examining molecular recognition of nerve agents shall help constructing more effective scavengers of OPs.







Abstract
Nerve agents are tetrahedral organophosphorus compounds (OPs) that were developed in the last century to irreversibly inhibit acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and therefore impede neurological signaling in living organisms. Exposure to OPs leads to a rapid development of symptoms from excessive salivation, nasal congestion and chest pain to convulsion and asphyxiation which if left untreated may lead to death. These potent toxins are prepared on a large scale from inexpensive staring materials, making it feasible for terrorist groups or states to use them against military and civilians. The existing antidotes provide limited protection and are difficult to apply to a large number of affected individuals. While new prophylactics are currently being developed, there is still need for therapeutics capable of both preventing and reversing the effects of OP poisoning. In this review, we describe how the science of molecular recognition can expand the pallet of tools for rapid and safe sequestration of nerve agents.

         <dc:description>
Keep it simple: A sustainable approach (ethyl acetate under ambient conditions without metals, additives or irradiation) for the synthesis of di&#8208; and tetra&#8208;hydroquinolines bearing one or two SO2CF3 groups has been developed.A Convenient Formal [4+2] Heterocylization Route to Bis(triflyl)tetrahydroquinolines (L&#225;zaro&#8208;Milla and Almendros) @IQOG_CSIC







Abstract
We report the sustainable and efficient synthesis of a new type of quinoline derivatives bearing one or two SO2CF3 groups. The protocol is metal&#8208;, catalyst&#8208; and irradiation&#8208;free, involves the use of readily available and stable precursors, and avoids the formation of side products. Also, the mild conditions of the process allow the tolerance of a wide range of functional groups.

         <title>Solid&#8208;State Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Techniques for the Structural Characterization of Geminal Alane&#8208;Phosphane Frustrated Lewis Pairs and Secondary Adducts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first comprehensive solid&#8208;state NMR characterization of geminal alane&#8208;phosphane frustrated Lewis pairs (Al/P FLPs) is reported. For measuring internuclear Al&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;P distances a new resonance&#8208;echo saturation&#8208;pulse double&#8208;resonance (RESPDOR) experiment was developed by using efficient saturation via frequency&#8208;swept wideband uniform rate smooth truncation (WURST) pulses. By using this widely applicable technique, Al&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;P distances in these compounds can be measured within a precision of &#177;0.1&#8197;&#197;.







Abstract
The first comprehensive solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) characterization of geminal alane&#8208;phosphane frustrated Lewis pairs (Al/P FLPs) is reported. Their relevant NMR parameters (isotropic chemical shifts, direct and indirect 27Al&#8208;31P spin&#8208;spin coupling constants, and 27Al nuclear electric quadrupole coupling tensor components) have been determined by numerical analysis of the experimental NMR line shapes and compared with values computed from the known crystal structures by using density functional theory (DFT) methods. Our work demonstrates that the 31P NMR chemical shifts for the studied Al/P FLPs are very sensitive to slight structural inequivalences. The 27Al NMR central transition signals are spread out over a broad frequency range (&gt;200&#8197;kHz), owing to the presence of strong nuclear electric quadrupolar interactions that can be well&#8208;reproduced by the static 27Al wideband uniform rate smooth truncation (WURST) Carr&#8208;Purcell&#8208;Meiboom&#8208;Gill (WCPMG) NMR experiment. 27Al chemical shifts and quadrupole tensor components offer a facile and clear distinction between three&#8208; and four&#8208;coordinate aluminum environments. For measuring internuclear Al&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;P distances a new resonance&#8208;echo saturation&#8208;pulse double&#8208;resonance (RESPDOR) experiment was developed by using efficient saturation via frequency&#8208;swept WURST pulses.

         <title>Multifunctional Metal Phosphides as Superior Host Materials for Advanced Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Being a good host: Metal phosphide&#8208;based hybrid materials have huge potential to boost the development of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density Li&#8722;S batteries. This review presents a comprehensive overview of recent progress in the use of metal phosphides for advanced Li&#8722;S batteries, in particular with a focus on the modified approaches, design principles, representative applications and development direction.







Abstract
For the past few years, a new generation of energy storage systems with large theoretical specific capacity has been urgently needed because of the rapid development of society. Lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) batteries are regarded as one of the most promising candidates for novel battery systems, since their resurgence at the end of the 20th century Li&#8722;S batteries have attracted ever more attention, attributed to their notably high theoretical energy density of 2600&#8197;W&#8201;h&#8201;kg&#8722;1, which is almost five times larger than that of commercial lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). One of the determining factors in Li&#8722;S batteries is how to design/prepare the sulfur cathode. For the sulfur host, the major technical challenge is avoiding the shuttling effect that is caused by soluble polysulfides during the reaction. In past decades, though the sulfur cathode has developed greatly, there are still some enormous challenges to be conquered, such as low utilization of S, rapid decay of capacity, and poor cycle life. This article spotlights the recent progress and foremost findings in improving the performance of Li&#8722;S batteries by employing multifunctional metal phosphides as host materials. The current state of development of the sulfur electrode of Li&#8722;S batteries is summarized by emphasizing the relationship between the essential properties of metal phosphide&#8208;based hybrid nanomaterials, the chemical reaction with lithium polysulfides and the latter&#8242;s influence on electrochemical performance. Finally, trends in the development and practical application of Li&#8722;S batteries are also pointed out.

         <title>Cascade Reaction to Selectively Synthesize Multifunctional Indole Derivatives by IrIII&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;H Activation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
C&#8722;H activation cascade reaction: An effective way to synthesize a variety of functionalized indoles with potent biological properties has been developed. Notably, 2,4&#8208;dialkynyl indole products were obtained by direct double alkynylation of C&#8722;H bonds, whereas alkynyl on C4 position might convert to carbonyl to generate 2&#8208;alkynyl&#8208;3,4&#8208;diacetyl indoles. Additionally, relay catalysis allowed the synthesis of 2,5&#8208;di&#8208;alkynyl&#8208;3,4&#8208;diacetyl indoles by using an in&#8197;situ carbonyl group as the directing group.







Abstract
An effective and condition&#8208;controlled way to synthesize with high selectivity a variety of functionalized indoles with potent biological properties has been developed. Notably, 2,4&#8208;dialkynyl indole products were obtained by direct double C&#8722;H bond alkynylation, whereas alkynyl at the C4 position could convert to carbonyl to generate 2&#8208;alkynyl&#8208;3,4&#8208;diacetyl indoles fast and effectively. Additionally, a one&#8208;pot relay catalytic reaction led to 2,5&#8208;di&#8208;alkynyl&#8208;3,4&#8208;diacetyl indoles when using a carbonyl group as the directing group and by controlling the type and quantity of additives. A possible mechanism was proposed based on many studies including deuterium&#8208;exchange experiments, the necessary conditions of product conversion, and the effect of water on the reaction.

         <title>Binding Sites, Vibrations and Spin&#8208;Lattice Relaxation Times in Europium(II)&#8208;Based Metallofullerene Spin Qubits</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The investigation of the spin dynamics in a series of chemically designed europium(II)&#8208;based endohedral metallofullerenes (EMFs) is reported. As a unique structural difference, metal&#8208;cage binding site can be introduced in EMFs and is demonstrated to play a key role in determining rigidity of the three low&#8208;energy metal&#8208;displacing vibrations and the spin&#8208;lattice relaxation times (T1). Normalized by the frequencies of these vibrations, the temperature dependence of T1 shows a universal behavior for different compounds in frozen CS2 solution.







Abstract
To design molecular spin qubits with enhanced quantum coherence, a control of the coupling between the local vibrations and the spin states is crucial, which could be realized in principle by engineering molecular structures via coordination chemistry. To this end, understanding the underlying structural factors that govern the spin relaxation is a central topic. Here, we report the investigation of the spin dynamics in a series of chemically designed europium(II)&#8208;based endohedral metallofullerenes (EMFs). By introducing a unique structural difference, i.&#8201;e. metal&#8208;cage binding site, while keeping other molecular parameters constant between different complexes, these manifest the key role of the three low&#8208;energy metal&#8208;displacing vibrations in mediating the spin&#8208;lattice relaxation times (T1). The temperature dependence of T1 can thus be normalized by the frequencies of these low energy vibrations to show an unprecedentedly universal behavior for EMFs in frozen CS2 solution. Our theoretical analysis indicates that this structural difference determines not only the vibrational rigidity but also spin&#8208;vibration coupling in these EMF&#8208;based qubit candidates.

         <title>Local Light&#8208;Controlled Generation of Calcium Carbonate and Barium Carbonate Biomorphs via Photochemical Stimulation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Space and time control: Light&#8208;induced mineralization of a barium carbonate/silica self&#8208;organized biomorph structure is possible by using the photobase ketoprofen through local pH increase and carbon dioxide release. Tuning the irradiation intensity or varying the irradiation time in subsequent growth cycles allows photochemical control of the morphology of the resulting structures. More information can be found in the Communication by J.&#8197;M. Garc&#237;a&#8208;Ruiz, H. C&#246;lfen, M. Montalti, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202102321).

         <dc:description>Na  3  V  2  (PO  4  )  3  (NVP) has been regarded as a potential cathode material for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) due to its excellent structural stability and rapid Na  +  conductivity. However, its electrochemical performances are restricted by the large bulk structure and poor electronic conductivity. The construction of porous NVP materials is a powerful method to improve the electrochemical properties. This concept aims to provide an overview of recent progress of porous NVP materials for SIBs. In brief, we first review the synthetic strategies and formation mechanisms of porous NVP materials as well as the relationship between the porous structures and electrochemical performances of NVP materials. Furthermore, we outline the challenges and prospects for the preparation of porous NVP materials in this field.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To study the DNA damage caused by a potent platinum&#8211;acridine anticancer agent (PA) in cancer cells, an assay based on biorthogonal post&#8208;labeling using a click chemistry&#8208;enabled, azide&#8208;modified derivative (APA) was developed. The method involves biotinylation, affinity capture, and bead&#8208;based enrichment of APA&#8208;modified genomic DNA. The key steps of the assay were validated and optimized in model duplexes, including full&#8208;length plasmids, restriction fragments, and a DNA ladder. Native DNA treated with APA and subsequently subjected to post&#8208;labeling with a biotin affinity tag was enzymatically digested and fragments were analyzed by in&#8208;line LC&#8208;MS and MS/MS. The monofunctional&#8211;intercalative adducts formed by APA in 5&#180;&#8208;pyrimidine/guanine sequences in double&#8208;stranded DNA are quantitatively biotinylated by strain&#8208;promoted 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition chemistry. When applied to DNA extracted from A549 lung cancer cells, the assay in combination with qPCR amplification demonstrates that platinum&#8211;acridines form adducts in the gene sequences encoding pre&#8208;ribosomal RNA, a potential pharmacological target of these agents.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Using a combination of cycloaddition&#8208;retroelectrocyclization reaction, free&#8208;base and zinc porphyrins (H  2  P and ZnP) are decorated at their b&#8208;pyrrole positions with strong charge transfer complexes, viz., tetracyanobuta&#8208;1,3&#8208;diene (TCBD)&#8208;phenothiazine (  3  and  4  ) or TCBD&#8208;aniline (  7  and  8  ), novel class of push&#8208;pull systems.&#160; The physico&#8208;chemical properties of these compounds (MP&#8208;Donor and MP&#8208;TCBD&#8208;Donor) have been investigated using a range of electrochemical, spectroelectrochemical, DFT as well as steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved spectroscopic techniques.&#160; Ground&#8208;state charge transfer interactions between the porphyrin and the electron&#8208;withdrawing TCBD directly attached to the porphyrin p&#8208;system extended the absorption features well into the near&#8208;infrared region.&#160; To visualize the photo&#8208;events, energy level diagrams with the help of free&#8208;energy calculations have been established. Switching the role of porphyrin from the initial electron acceptor to electron donor was possible to envision.&#160; Occurrence of photoinduced charge separation has been established by complementary transient absorption spectral studies followed by global and target data analyses.&#160; Better charge stabilization in H  2  P derived over ZnP derived conjugates, and in phenothiazine derived over aniline derived conjugates has been possible to establish.&#160; These findings highlight the importance of the nature of porphyrins and second electron donor in governing the ground and excited state charge transfer events in closely positioned donor&#8208;acceptor conjugates.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nowadays sodium&#8208;based energy storage systems (Na&#8208;based ESSs) have been widely researched as it possesses the possibility to replace traditional energy storage media to become next generation energy storage system. However, due to the irreversible loss of sodium ions in the first cycle, development of Na&#8208;based ESSs is limited. Presodiation, as a strategy of adding excess sodium ions to the system in advance, accomplishes the enhancement of electrochemical performance. In this minireview, different presodiation strategies applied in sodium&#8208;based energy storage systems will be summarized in detail, their functions and corresponding mechanisms will be discussed as well. Furthermore, the current novel application of presodiation method in other aspects of Na&#8208;based ESSs will be mentioned additionally. At last, in the view of present research status of presodiation, issues that can be mitigated are put forward and guidelines are given on  how to deliberate in&#8208;depth presodiation technology  in the future, dedicating to promote the further development of Na&#8208;based ESSs.</dc:description>

         <title>Alkene Synthesis by Photo&#8208;Wolff&#8208;Kischner Reaction of Sulfur Ylides and N&#8208;Tosylhydrazones</title>

         <dc:description>A visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven and room temperature photo&#8208;Wolff&#8208;Kischner reaction of sulfur ylides and N&#8208;tosylhydrazones has been developed for the first time to provide modular access to alkene synthesis. The high functional group tolerance and broad substrate scope were demonstrated by more than 60 examples. Both  E  &#8208; and  Z  &#8208;olefinic stereochemistry in the products could be controlled with excellent stereoselectivity. A series of mechanistic studies support that the reaction should proceed through a radical&#8208;carbanion crossover pathway, specifically involving addition of photo&#8208;generated sulfur ylide radical cations to  N  &#8208;tosylhydrazones to form carbanions and subsequent Wolff&#8208;Kischner process.</dc:description>

         <title>Contorted Hetero&#8208;annulated Tetraareno[a,d,j,m]coronenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fused polycyclic aromatic compounds are interesting materials for organic electronics applications. To fine&#8208;tune photophysical or electrochemical properties, either various substituents can be attached or heteroatoms (such as N or S) can be incorporated to the fused aromatic backbone. Coronenes and heterocoronenes are a promising compounds in this respect. Up to now, the possibilities to vary the attached fused heteroaromatics at the coronene core were quite limited and realizing both electron&#8208;withdrawing and &#8211;donating rings attached at the same time was very difficult. Here, a series of pyridine, anisole and thiophene annulated tetraareno[  a  ,  d  ,  j  ,  m  ]coronenes were synthesized by a facile two&#8208;step route, which is a combination of Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reaction and the following cyclization step, starting from three different diarenoperylene dibromides. The contorted molecular &#960;&#8208;planes of the obtained  cata  &#8208;condensed tetraarenocoronenes were analysed by single crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography and the photophysical and electrochemical properties were systematically investigated by UV(vis spectroscopiy and electrochemical characterizations.</dc:description>

         <title>Singlet Oxygen&#8208;Induced Phospholipase A2 Inhibition: a Major Role for Interfacial Tryptophan Dioxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Several studies have revealed that various diseases such as cancer have been associated with elevated phospholipase A  2  (PLA  2  ) activity. Therefore, the regulation of PLA  2  catalytic activity is undoubtedly vital. In this study, effective inactivation of PLA  2  due to reactive species produced from cold physical plasma as a source to model oxidative stress is reported. We found singlet oxygen to be the most relevant active agent in PLA  2  inhibition. A more detailed analysis of the plasma&#8208;treated PLA  2  identified tryptophan 128 as a hot spot, rich in double oxidation. The significant dioxidation of this interfacial tryptophan resulted in an N&#8208;formylkynurenine product via the oxidative opening of the tryptophan indole ring. Molecular dynamics simulation indicated that the efficient interactions between the tryptophan residue and phospholipids are eliminated following tryptophan dioxidation. As interfacial tryptophan residues are predominantly involved in the attaching of membrane enzymes to the bilayers, tryptophan dioxidation and indole ring opening leads to the loss of essential interactions for enzyme binding and, consequently, enzyme inactivation.</dc:description>

         <title>Disclosure of Ground State Zimmerman&#8208;M&#246;bius Aromaticity in Radical Anion of [6]helicene and Evidence for 4p periodic Aromatic Ring Currents in a molecular &#8220;metallic&#8221; M&#246;bius Strip</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zimmerman proposed in 1966 a type of M&#246;bius aromaticity, which involves through&#8208;space electron delocalization and has since been widely applied to explain reactivity in pericyclic reactions, but is considered being limited to transition state structures. Although easily accessible hexahelicene radical anion is known for more than half a century, it was overlooked that it exhibits ground state minimum and robust Zimmerman&#8208;M&#246;bius aromaticity in its central noose&#8208;like opening, becoming, hence, the oldest existing M&#246;bius aromatic system and with smallest M&#246;bius cycle known. Despite its overall aromatic stabilization energy of 13.6 kcalmol&#8208;1 (at B3LYP/6&#8208;311+G**), the radical also features a strong global induced paramagnetic ring current along its outer edge. Exclusive global paramagnetic currents can be found also in fully delocalized other radical anions of 4N+2 p&#8208;electron aromatic polycyclic benzenoid hydrocarbons (PAH), questioning the established magnetic criterion of antiaromaticity. As an example for a PAH with non&#8208;trivial topology, we studied a novel M&#246;bius[16]cyclacene, which has a non&#8208;orientable surface manifold and a stable closed shell singlet ground state at several density functional theory levels. Its metallic monoanion radical (0.0095 eV band gap at HSE06/6&#8208;31G* level) is also wave function stable and displays an unusual 4p&#8208;periodic magnetically induced ring current (reminiscent of transformation behavior of spinors under spatial rotation), indicating existence of a H&#252;ckel rule evading new type of aromaticity.</dc:description>

The complexity of the Pd&#8208;catalyzed Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura C&#8722;C bond formation reaction lies in the indivdual steps of the cycle, as well as in the generation of the catalytically active species. An overview of the topic is provided from a historical perspective.







Abstract
The story of C&#8722;C bond formation includes several reactions, and surely Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura is among the most outstanding ones. Herein, a brief historical overview of insights regarding the reaction mechanism is provided. In particular, the formation of the catalytically active species is probably the main concern, thus the preactivation is in competition with, or even assumes the role of the rate determining step (rds) of the overall reaction. Computational chemistry is key in identifying the rds and thus leading to milder conditions on an experimental level by means of predictive catalysis.

         <title>Photoswitchable Composite Polymer Electrolytes Using Spiropyran&#8208;Immobilized Nanoporous Templates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Conductive solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) with smart, stimuli&#8208;responsive characteristics have gained considerable attention owing to their noninvasive manipulation and applications in future technologies. To address this potential, in this work, we demonstrate photoresponsive composite polymer electrolytes, consisting of SPE and spiropyran&#8208;immobilized nanoporous anodic aluminum oxide (SP&#8208;AAO) templates. Under UV irradiation, the close SP form isomerizes to the open merocyanine (MC) form, creating extremely polarized AAO surfaces; whereas under visible light irradiation, the MC form reverts to the SP form, creating neutral surface conditions. The electrostatic interactions between ions and AAO surfaces are investigated by attenuated total reflection Fourier&#8208;transform infrared (ATR&#8208;FTIR) spectroscopy. Moreover, the behavior of ionic conductivity of the SPE@SP&#8208;AAO is found to be consistent with the kinetics of isomerization tracked by UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy. This work provides a promising platform for developing next&#8208;generation photoelectronic smart devices.</dc:description>

         <title>NIR&#8208;II Fluorescent Brightness Promoted by &#8220;Ring Fusion&#8221; for the Detection of Intestinal Inflammation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

Bright, even at longer wavelengths: A &#8220;ring&#8208;fusion&#8221; approach is proposed to adjust the emission wavelength from the NIR&#8208;I to NIR&#8208;II region with enhanced total brightness of the fluorophore. Theoretical calculation confirms that our strategy can efficiently narrow the energy gap and lower the reorganization energy of the TTQP molecule, promoting sensitive fluorescent angiography and diagnosis of intestinal inflammation. This molecular design strategy thus is promising to enrich the library of NIR&#8208;II fluorophores for versatile bioimaging studies.







Abstract
Fluorophores with emission in the second near&#8208;infrared window (NIR&#8208;II) have displayed salient advantages for biomedical applications. However, the common strategy of reducing the energy bandgap of fluorophores so as to achieve red&#8208;shifted wavelengths always leads to compromised fluorescent brightness. Herein, we propose a molecular design concept of &#8220;ring&#8208;fusion&#8221; to modify the acceptor of AIEgen that can extend the luminous wavelength from NIR&#8208;I to NIR&#8208;II. The fused&#8208;acceptor&#8208;containing fluorophore yielded, TTQP, has an enhanced absorption coefficient with a higher brightness in nanoparticle formation compared to its NIR&#8208;I emissive counterpart (TTQ&#8208;DP) with a non&#8208;fused acceptor. Theoretical calculation further confirms that the ring fusion can efficiently promote the rigidity and planarity of the electron&#8208;deficient core, leading to a lower reorganization energy and nonradiative decay. The TTQP NPs yielded thus allow sensitive NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging of vasculature and intestinal inflammation in mice models. Therefore, we anticipate that our work will provide a promising molecular&#8208;engineering strategy to enrich the library and broaden the application scope of NIR&#8208;II fluorophores.

Supra&#8208;typed molecules composed of a pyridine&#8208;based amphiphile complexed with 1,5&#8208;, 1,6&#8208;, 2,6&#8208;, or 2,7&#8208;dihydroxy naphthalene self&#8208;assemble in water to form nanotubes. The inner diameters of the nanotubes strongly depend on the naphthalene regioisomers. The excimer fluorescence bands derived from J&#8208;type aggregates of the naphthalene in the nanotubes vary according to the different inner diameters.

Greatness in simplicity: A general, straightforward, and atom&#8208;economical protocol to synthesize vinyl triflimides has been developed. A broad spectrum of terminal and internal alkynes could be used to generate various di&#8208; and trisubstituted vinyl triflimides. The protocol could be conducted on a gram scale with both terminal and internal alkynes. Preliminarily attempts to probe the unprecedented reactivity of vinyl triflimides disclosed some of its unique chemical properties. More information can be found in the Communication by Y.

         <title>Highly Sensitive Fluorescent pH Microsensors Based on the Ratiometric Dye Pyranine Immobilized on Silica Microparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Optical fluorescent pH sensors based on positively charged silica microparticles containing anionic pyranine molecules were developed by using a modified St&#246;ber method with a gradual immobilization of ratiometrically pH&#8208;sensing pyranine molecules during the growth of silica seed particles and an overall positive charge in a one&#8208;step reaction. The overly pH&#8208;sensitive nature of pyranine is preserved and long&#8208;term stability is ensured by silica shell coating. These cytocompatible ratiometric pH sensors can be used for pH sensing and pH tracking applications where each microparticle can be observed individually due to resolvable size. More information can be found in the Communication by A. Chandra, L.&#8197;L. del&#8197;Mercato et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101568).

&#8220;The dual behavior of the 2,1&#8208;benzazaphosphole mentioned in the title of this manuscript predicted by a theoretical NRT study represents the most significant point of this paper. Thus, a quite easily accessible molecule allowed us to observe two totally different reactivities; i.e., heterodyne&#8208; versus phosphinidene&#8208;like, both of them being highly desirable regarding future applications.&#8221; Read more about the story behind the cover in the Cover Profile and about the research itself on page&#8197;&#9642;&#9642;&#8197;ff.

         <title>Re&#8208;Thinking Uncaging: A New Antiaromatic Photocage Driven by a Gain of Resonance Energy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoactivatable compounds  e.g.  photoswitches or photolabile protecting groups (PPGs, photocages) for spatiotemporal light control, play a crucial role in different areas of research. For each application, parameters such as the absorption spectrum, solubility in the respective media and/or photochemical quantum yields for several competing processes need to be optimized. The design of new photochemical tools therefore remains an important task. In this study, we exploited the concept of excited&#8208;state&#8208;aromaticity, first described by N. Colin Baird in 1971, to investigate a new class of photocages, based on cyclic, ground&#8208;state&#8208;antiaromatic systems. Several thio&#8208; and nitrogen&#8208;functionalized compounds were synthesized, photochemically characterized and further optimized, supported by quantum chemical calculations. After choosing the optimal scaffold, which shows an excellent uncaging quantum yield of 28%, we achieved a bathochromic shift of over 100 nm, resulting in a robust, well accessible, visible light absorbing, compact new photocage with a clean photoreaction and a high quantum product (&#949;&#183;&#934;) of 893 M  &#8208;1  cm  &#8208;1  at 405&#160;nm.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Oxygen and Hydrogen Functionalization of the h&#8208;BN/Rh(111) Nanomesh</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Confined functionalization: In this study, we achieved covalent functionalization of the hexagonal boron nitride nanomesh on Rh(111) with oxygen molecules and hydrogen atoms. The adsorption and thermal stability were investigated using synchrotron radiation&#8208;based in&#8197;situ high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, temperature&#8208;programmed X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy. It was found that the functionalization is restricted to the pores of the nanomesh leading to spatially defined chemical modification of the two&#8208;dimensional material.







Abstract
We present detailed studies on the covalent adsorption of molecular oxygen and atomic hydrogen on the hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN) nanomesh on Rh(111). The functionalization of this two&#8208;dimensional (2D) material was investigated under ultra&#8208;high vacuum conditions using synchrotron radiation&#8208;based in&#8197;situ high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, temperature&#8208;programmed X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy. We are able to provide a deep insight into the adsorption behavior and thermal stability of oxygen and hydrogen on h&#8208;BN/Rh(111). Oxygen functionalization was achieved via a supersonic molecular beam while hydrogen functionalization was realized using an atomic hydrogen source.

     alt="Selective Oxygen and Hydrogen Functionalization of the h-BN/Rh(111) Nanomesh"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Confined functionalization&lt;/b&gt;: In this study, we achieved covalent functionalization of the hexagonal boron nitride nanomesh on Rh(111) with oxygen molecules and hydrogen atoms. The adsorption and thermal stability were investigated using synchrotron radiation-based in&#8197;situ high-resolution X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, temperature-programmed X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy. It was found that the functionalization is restricted to the pores of the nanomesh leading to spatially defined chemical modification of the two-dimensional material.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We present detailed studies on the covalent adsorption of molecular oxygen and atomic hydrogen on the hexagonal boron nitride (&lt;i&gt;h&lt;/i&gt;-BN) nanomesh on Rh(111). The functionalization of this two-dimensional (2D) material was investigated under ultra-high vacuum conditions using synchrotron radiation-based in&#8197;situ high-resolution X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, temperature-programmed X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy. We are able to provide a deep insight into the adsorption behavior and thermal stability of oxygen and hydrogen on &lt;i&gt;h&lt;/i&gt;-BN/Rh(111). Oxygen functionalization was achieved via a supersonic molecular beam while hydrogen functionalization was realized using an atomic hydrogen source. Adsorption of the respective species was observed to occur selectively in the pores of &lt;i&gt;h&lt;/i&gt;-BN leading to spatially defined modification of the 2D layer. The adsorption of the observed molecular oxygen species was found to be an activated process that requires high-energy oxygen molecules. Upon heating to 700&#8197;K, oxygen functionalization was observed to be almost reversible except for small amounts of boron oxides evolving due to the reaction of oxygen with the 2D material. Hydrogen functionalization of &lt;i&gt;h&lt;/i&gt;-BN/Rh(111) was fully reversed upon heating to about 640&#8197;K.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Divergent Construction of Diverse Scaffolds through Catalyst&#8208;Controlled C&#8722;H Activation Cascades of Quinazolinones and Cyclopropenones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controlled cascades: We have successfully developed attractive C&#8722;H activation cascade reactions between quinazolinones and cyclopropenones. Different structures can be selectively synthesized under the precise control of the catalysts in a one&#8208;pot manner. The high efficiency, excellent chemo&#8208;/regioselectivity, wide substrate scope, and amenability to gram&#8208;scale synthesis for both quinazolinones and cyclopropenones demonstrated the promising applicability of reactions.







Abstract
A transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation cascade strategy to rapidly construct diverse quinazolinone derivatives in a one&#8208;pot manner is reported. The catalysts play an important role in the different transformations. Additionally, the procedure is scalable, proceeds with high efficiency and good chemo&#8208;/regio&#8208;selectivity, and tolerates a range of functional groups.

         <title>Cation Ordering and Exsolution in Copper&#8208;Containing Forms of the Flexible Zeolite Rho (Cu,M&#8208;Rho; M=H, Na) and Their Consequences for CO2 Adsorption</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Copper cations favour 6&#8208;membered ring (6R) sites in dehydrated zeolite Rho, away from 8R windows that allow adsorption into lta cages. Exchange of Cu cations into Na&#8208;Rho, in which Na cations occupy 8R gating sites between the lta cages, improves CO2 uptake kinetics, while retaining some Na cations enhances CO2/CH4 selectivity. Upon dehydration, Cu,Na&#8208;Rho shows exsolution behaviour, because its framework can adopt distorted and undistorted forms that provide favourable coordination sites for Na and Cu cations, respectively.







Abstract
The flexibility of the zeolite Rho framework offers great potential for tunable molecular sieving. The fully copper&#8208;exchanged form of Rho and mixed Cu,H&#8208; and Cu,Na&#8208;forms have been prepared. EPR spectroscopy reveals that Cu2+ ions are present in the dehydrated forms and Rietveld refinement shows these prefer S6R sites, away from the d8r windows that control diffusion. Fully exchanged Cu&#8208;Rho remains in an open form upon dehydration, the d8r windows remain nearly circular and the occupancy of window sites is low, so that it adsorbs CO2 rapidly at room temperature. Breakthrough tests with 10&#8201;% CO2/40&#8201;% CH4 mixtures show that Cu4.9&#8208;Rho is able to produce pure methane, albeit with a relatively low capacity at this pCO2 due to the weak interaction of CO2 with Cu cations. This is in strong contrast to Na&#8208;Rho, where cations in narrow elliptical window sites enable CO2 to be adsorbed with high selectivity and uptake but too slowly to enable the production of pure methane in similar breakthrough experiments. A series of Cu,Na&#8208;Rho materials was prepared to improve uptake and selectivity compared to Cu&#8208;Rho, and kinetics compared to Na&#8208;Rho. Remarkably, Cu,Na&#8208;Rho with &gt;2 Cu cations per unit cell exhibited exsolution, due to the preference of Na cations for narrow S8R sites in distorted Rho and of Cu cations for S6R sites in the centric, open form of Rho. The exsolved Cu,Na&#8208;Rho showed improved performance in CO2/CH4 breakthrough tests, producing pure CH4 with improved uptake and CO2/CH4 selectivity compared to that of Cu4.9&#8208;Rho.

         <title>Noncovalent Interactions at Lanthanide Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lanthanide complexes have attracted a widespread attention due to their structural diversity, as well as multifunctional and tunable properties. The development of lanthanide based functional materials has often relied on the design of the secondary coordination sphere of the corresponding lanthanide complexes. For instance, usually simple lanthanide salts (solvento complexes) do not catalyze effectively organic reactions or provide low yield of the expected product, whereas the presence of a suitable organic ligand with a noncovalent bond donor or acceptor centre (secondary coordination sphere) modifies the symmetry around the metal centre in lanthanide complexes which then successfully can act as catalysts in both homogenous and heterogenous catalysis. In this minireview, we discuss several relevant examples, based on X&#8208;ray crystal structure analyses, in which the hydrogen, halogen, chalcogen, pnictogen, tetrel and rare&#8208;earth bonds, as well as cation&#8208;&#960;, anion&#8208;&#960;, lone pair&#8208;&#960;, &#960;&#8208;&#960; and pancake interactions, are used as a synthon in the decoration of the secondary coordination sphere of lanthanide complexes.</dc:description>

         <title>Breathing Effect via Solvent Inclusions on the Linker Rotational Dynamics of Functionalized MIL&#8208;53</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The breathing effects of functionalized MIL&#8208;53&#8208;X (X= H, CH  3  , NH  2  , OH, and NO  2  ) induced by the inclusions of water, methanol, acetone, and N,N&#8208;dimethylformamide solvents were comprehensively investigated by solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy. 2D homo&#8208;nuclear correlation NMR provided direct experimental evidence for the host&#8208;guest interaction between the guest solvents and the MOFs framework. The variations of the  1  H and  13  C NMR chemical shifts in functionalized MIL&#8208;53 from the narrow pore phase transitions to large pore forms due to solvent inclusions were clearly identified. The influence of functionalized linkers and their host&#8208;guest interactions with the confined solvents on the rotational dynamics of the linkers was examined by separated&#8208;local&#8208;field MAS NMR experiments in conjunction with DFT theoretical calculations. It is found that the linker rotational dynamics of functionalized MIL&#8208;53 in narrow pore form is closely related to the computational rotational energy barrier. The BDC&#8208;NO  2  linker of activated MIL&#8208;53&#8208;NO  2  undergoes relatively faster rotation, whereas the BDC&#8208;NH  2  and BDC&#8208;OH linkers of activated MIL&#8208;53&#8208;NH  2  and MIL&#8208;53&#8208;OH exhibit relatively slower rotation. The host&#8208;guest interactions between confined solvents and MIL&#8208;53&#8208;NO  2  , MIL&#8208;53&#8208;CH  3  would significantly induce an increase of the order parameters of unsubstituted carbon and reduce the rotational frequency of linkers. This study provides a spectroscopic approach for the investigation of linker rotation in functionalized MOFs at natural abundance with solvents inclusions.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The breathing effects of functionalized MIL-53-X (X= H, CH  3  , NH  2  , OH, and NO  2  ) induced by the inclusions of water, methanol, acetone, and N,N-dimethylformamide solvents were comprehensively investigated by solid-state NMR spectroscopy. 2D homo-nuclear correlation NMR provided direct experimental evidence for the host-guest interaction between the guest solvents and the MOFs framework. The variations of the  1  H and  13  C NMR chemical shifts in functionalized MIL-53 from the narrow pore phase transitions to large pore forms due to solvent inclusions were clearly identified. The influence of functionalized linkers and their host-guest interactions with the confined solvents on the rotational dynamics of the linkers was examined by separated-local-field MAS NMR experiments in conjunction with DFT theoretical calculations. It is found that the linker rotational dynamics of functionalized MIL-53 in narrow pore form is closely related to the computational rotational energy barrier. The BDC-NO  2  linker of activated MIL-53-NO  2  undergoes relatively faster rotation, whereas the BDC-NH  2  and BDC-OH linkers of activated MIL-53-NH  2  and MIL-53-OH exhibit relatively slower rotation. The host-guest interactions between confined solvents and MIL-53-NO  2  , MIL-53-CH  3  would significantly induce an increase of the order parameters of unsubstituted carbon and reduce the rotational frequency of linkers. This study provides a spectroscopic approach for the investigation of linker rotation in functionalized MOFs at natural abundance with solvents inclusions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hollow carbon spheres&#8208;modified graphitic carbon nitride for efficient photocatalytic H2 production</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel hybrid photocatalyst composed of nano hollow carbon spheres (NCS) and graphitic carbon nitride (CN) curly nanosheets has been prepared by the calcination of NCS precursor and freeze&#8208;dried urea. The optimized photocatalyst exhibits an efficient photocatalytic performance under visible light irradiation with the highest H  2  generation rate of 3612.3 &#956;mol g  &#8208;1  h  &#8208;1  , leading to an apparent quantum yield of 10.04% at 420 nm, 5 times higher than the widely reported benchmark photocatalyst CN (2.01% AQY). The materials characterization shows that NCS&#8208;modified CN curly nanosheets can promote photoelectron transfer and suppress charge recombination through their special coupling interface and NCS as an electron acceptor, which significantly improves the photocatalytic efficiency. Thus, this study provides a new strategy for the design of highly&#8208;efficient photocatalyst, particularly suitable for polymeric materials to construct a totally metal free photocatalytic structure.</dc:description>

         <title>Influence of N&#8208;Substituents on Photovoltaic Properties of Singly Bay&#8208;Linked Dimeric Perylene Diimides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The influence of  N  &#8208;substituents on the photovoltaic properties of singly bay&#8208;linked perylene diimides (diPDIs) was systematically investigated to understand the aromatic&#8211;aliphatic balance, which is beneficial for achieving high device performance in organic photovoltaic (OPV) systems. The synthesis of various  N  &#8208;substituted diPDIs was successfully achieved using a newly developed one&#8208;step procedure, resulting in sufficiently high yields. Detailed investigations of seven variants of diPDIs demonstrated that the primary alkyl substituents, particularly the 2&#8208;ethylhexyl group, induce the self&#8208;organized growth of thin films with high crystallinity. This is beneficial for enhancing the device performance of bulk heterojunction (BHJ) systems. The results presented herein reveal the important roles of alkyl side chains as hydrophobic solubilizing auxiliaries or primary determinants in the control of the active layer nanomorphology. This offers a valuable guideline that is essential for developing high&#8208;performance organic semiconductor materials for future practical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>THE CATALYTIC MECHANISM OF THE RETAINING GLYCOSYLTRANSFERASE MANNOSYLGLYCERATE SYNTHASE</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To protect their intracellular proteins, extremophile microorganisms synthesize molecules called compatible solutes. These molecules are the result of the attachment of a small negatively charged molecule to a sugar molecule. It has been found that these molecules, not only protect the microorganism against osmotic stress, as initially thought, but also against other extreme conditions. The observation that these molecules can confer protection against extreme conditions to isolated enzymes from different organisms made them an exciting prospect for potential biotechnological applications. One of the most widespread compatible solute in hyperthermophile organisms is the molecule 2&#8208;O&#8208;&#945;&#8208;D&#8208;mannosyl&#8208;D&#8208;glycerate (MG). In addition to confer protection to proteins against extreme conditions, MG was found to prevent Alzheimer's &#946;&#8208;amyloid aggregation and reduce &#945;&#8208;synuclein fibril formation in Parkinson&#8217;s disease.&#160;
In this work we studied, using computational methods, the catalytic mechanism of the synthesis of MG by the enzyme mannosylglycerate synthase (MGS) from the thermophilic bacteria&#160;  Rhodothermus marinus  . MGS is a promiscuous enzyme, accepting a variety of sugar donors and acceptors. This feature can be used to synthesize other molecules with potential biotechnological applications beyond MG. The unravelling of the catalytic mechanism with atomistic resolution and the associated free energies and electrostatic profiles of the stationary states obtained in the present work will help future investigations to full explore the potential of MGS.</dc:description>

         <title>Surface Chemistry Impact on the Light Absorption by Colloidal Quantum Dots</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>At the size scale at which quantum confinement effects arise in inorganic semiconductors, the materials&#8217; surface&#8208;to&#8208;volume ratio is intrinsically high. This consideration sets surface chemistry as a powerful tool to exert further control on the electronic structure of the inorganic semiconductors. Among the materials that experience the quantum confinement regime, those prepared via colloidal synthetic procedures (the colloidal quantum dots &#8211;and wires and wells, too&#8211;) are prone to undergo surface reactions in the solution phase and thus represent an ideal framework to study the ensemble impact of surface chemistry on the materials&#8217; electronic structure. It is here discussed such an impact at the ground state by using the absorption spectrum of the colloidal quantum dots as a descriptor. The experiments show that the chemical species (the ligands) at the colloidal quantum dot surface induce changes to the optical band gap, the absorption coefficient at all wavelengths, and the ionization potential. These evidences point to a description of the colloidal quantum dot (the ligand/core adduct) as an indecomposable species, in which the orbitals localized on the ligands and the core mix in each other&#8217;s electric field. This description goes beyond conventional models that conceive the ligands on the basis of pure electrostatic arguments (i.e., either as a dielectric shell or as electric dipoles) or as a mere potential energy barrier at the core boundaries.</dc:description>
