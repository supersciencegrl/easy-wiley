         <title>In Situ Electrochemical Synthesis of Redox&#8208;Active o&#8208;Hydroquinone Metabolite of Flufenamic Acid on MWCNT Surface: Lifespan Extension in C. elegans via SOD Pathway</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents an electrochemical strategy to generate the redox&#8208;active flufenamic acid&#8208;drug metabolite, FFA&#8208;Redox, which extends the lifespan of C. elegans worm&#8208;by up to 80% under pathogenic infection. The metabolite reduces intracellular ROS levels and enhances superoxide dismutase expression, suggesting a potent antioxidant&#8208;driven &#8220;de&#8208;aging&#8221; mechanism with promising biomedical potential.








Abstract
The search for drugs that extend lifespan in human&#8208;like biological models is a frontier area in biomedical research. In this study, we report a novel electrochemical approach using flufenamic acid (FFA), a widely known nonsteroidal anti&#8208;inflammatory drug (NSAID), to generate and detect its pharmacologically active metabolites. Electrochemical oxidation of FFA on multi&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes(MWCNT)&#8208;modified electrode yielded hydroxylated derivatives, primarily 4&#8208;hydroxy FFA (m/z 297.05&#160;g/mol) and a polyhydroxylated product termed FFA&#8208;Redox (m/z 243.05&#160;g/mol), as surface&#8208;confined species (MWCNT@FFA&#8208;Redox). To establish biological relevance, Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) were exposed to FFA, resulting in in vivo formation of metabolites identical to those generated electrochemically. This confirmed the physiological significance of the electrosynthesized compounds. Lifespan assays demonstrated that FFA&#8208;Redox prolonged the survival of C. elegans by up to 40% under Klebsiella pneumoniae infection and by up to 80% under Staphylococcus aureus infection. This protective effect was attributed to reduced levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). Mechanistic insights suggest that FFA&#8208;Redox induces a &#8220;de&#8208;aging&#8221; response by enhancing the expression of superoxide dismutase (SOD), a key antioxidant enzyme activated during oxidative stress.

         <title>Halogen Bond&#8208;Tuning of Responsive Supramolecular Amino Acid Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
XB strongly influences both solid&#8208;state packing and rheological properties of hydrogels of a tailored halogenated Fmoc&#8208;amino acid in biomimetic environments. Interestingly, the addition of effective XB&#8208;acceptors (Nu) to the gelation medium increased gel stiffness, preluding to the possible future development of XB&#8208;responsive amino acid hydrogels in anion sensing, or for the encapsulation of specific guest molecules.








Abstract
N&#8208;Fmoc&#8208;pentafluoro&#8208;L&#8208;phenylalanine (F5) forms stable supramolecular hydrogels, mainly through &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking of its aromatic groups. Hydrogen bonding&#8208;driven co&#8208;assembly of F5 with suitable partner molecules has been reported to affect the gel's properties, in accordance with what is observed in their corresponding co&#8208;crystal structures. Herein, we extended this hydrogel modulation strategy to halogen bonding (XB) interactions by introducing an XB&#8208;donating iodine atom in the para&#8208;position of the F5 phenyl ring. Under conditions mimicking biological environments, both crystal packing and hydrogelation of the resulting N&#8208;Fmoc&#8208;4&#8208;iodo&#8208;tetrafluoro&#8208;phenylalanine (IF4), were significantly affected by iodine&#8208;&#960; interactions. Slower fibril formation kinetics and reduced strength of IF4 hydrogels in phosphate buffer solution, compared to F5, mirrored iodine&#8208;induced changes in Fmoc stacking in the solid state. Notably, the addition of strong XB&#8208;acceptors &#8211; such as iodide anions or pyridine&#8208;containing substrates, like vitamin B3 &#8211; induced a significant increase in gel stiffness. These findings suggest the possibility of exploiting properly tailored Fmoc&#8208;amino acids as &#8220;XB&#8208;responsive&#8221; hydrogelators, useful for anion sensing applications or for trapping bioactive molecules.

         <title>Mild and Selective Trifluoromethylation of Peptides at Tryptophane Residues by a Water&#8208;Soluble Copper Complex with Redox&#8208;Active Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selective functionalization of aminoacids is a key endeavor in chemical biology. Radical manifolds offer interesting possibilities but can suffer from limited control over radical processes, resulting in a lack of selectivity in product distribution. A water&#8208;soluble copper complex with redox&#8208;active ligands has been developed and performs trifluoromethylation of tryptophane residues with high selectivity. This method displays both inter&#8208; and intramolecular selectivity and its synthetic relevance is demonstrated by the selective conversion of a 13&#8208;residue peptidic sequence and an endomorphine analogue in good yields.








Abstract
Selective chemical modifications of biomolecules are in high demand for the development and implementation of chemical biology strategies. Methods involving radicals have emerged as powerful options yet potentially generate side reactivities when involving harsh reaction conditions. We report the development of a mild catalytic method for the selective functionalization of tryptophane residues in peptides with a trifluoromethyl group using a water&#8208;soluble copper complex with redox&#8208;active ligands. This method displays both inter&#8208; and intramolecular selectivity for tryptophane residues and its synthetic relevance is demonstrated by the selective conversion of a 13&#8208;residue peptidic sequence and an endomorphine analogue in good yields.

         <title>Copper&#8208;catalyzed Chemoselective Reduction of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated Flavone Olefin and It's Glycosides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a chemoselective copper&#8208;catalyzed reduction of flavones to flavanones using ammonia borane as a hydrogen source. Copper (II) catalyst in combination with a bipyridine ligand enabled selective hydrogenation of the C&#9552;C bond in the enone system, whereas Cu(I) without a ligand facilitated dual reduction of both the olefinic and carbonyl groups, yielding flavanols under similar conditions. NMR studies revealed that the reaction proceeds through the in situ generation of CuH in the reaction medium as the active reducing agent.








Abstract
The chemoselective reduction of flavones to flavanones remains a significant synthetic challenge in the total synthesis of bioactive flavonoid glycosides. This chemoselective reduction of flavone olefin requires precise control over reactivity to reduce the conjugated &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl system without affecting the functional groups commonly present in the complex carbohydrate derivatives. We report a straightforward copper&#8208;catalyzed reduction method using ammonia borane (NH3&#8226;BH3) as a hydrogen source. The catalytic system, based on a Cu(II) combination with bipyridine ligand, exhibited highly chemoselective hydrogenation of the C&#9552;C bond in the enone moiety of flavones to flavanones, whereas the Cu(I) without ligand reduced both functional groups to furnish flavanols. Notably, this methodology demonstrated a broad substrate scope with a wide range of functional group tolerance, including various sugar&#8208;derived substituents. The synthetic utility and versatility of the protocol were further highlighted through the useful synthesis of a library of mono&#8208; and disaccharide&#8208;conjugated flavonoid glycosides. Interestingly, this catalytic system displayed distinct reactivity by efficiently reducing carbonyl compounds to alcohols while inhibiting over&#8208;reduction to alkanes. Additionally, we performed a series of control experiments to gain a deeper insight into the mechanism and revealed that the reaction proceeds through the in situ generation of CuH in the reaction.

         <title>Soluble Ring&#8208;Unsubstituted Phthalocyanine Zirconium(IV) and Niobium(V) cis&#8208;Alkoxides and Their Catalytic Activity Toward the Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization of rac&#8208;Lactide</title>

Ring&#8208;unsubstituted phthalocyanine chloride complexes of Zr(IV) and Nb(V) are solubilized via conversion to a range of cis&#8208;axially ligated alkoxides, which show varying levels of activity as lactide polymerization catalysts depending on the alkoxide and the metal center.








Abstract
A series of soluble ring&#8208;unsubstituted early&#8208;transition metallophthalocyanine (PcM) alkoxides with zirconium(IV) and niobium(V) metal centers was prepared via salt metathesis with PcM chlorides and a range of lithium or sodium alkoxides (NaOMe, NaOEt, LiOiPr, and NaOtBu); several examples were structurally characterized. Given their large ionic size, the metal centers protrude out of the Pc cavity, engendering cis&#8208;axial ligation of the alkoxides and thereby generating substantially improved solubility relative to the starting PcM chlorides. Seven&#8208;coordinate PcM(OR)3&#8208;type coordination spheres were typically observed, with lithium&#8208; or sodium&#8208;balanced &#8220;ate&#8221; species PcZr(OiPr)3Li(THF) and PcZr(OtBu)3Na(THF) isolated for PcZr(IV), compared to the neutral PcNb(OiPr)3. With the highly steric R&#160;=&#160;tBu the neutral six&#8208;coordinate PcZr(OtBu)2 was also structurally characterized. The catalytic activity of the PcZr(IV) and PcNb(V) alkoxides was probed toward the ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) of rac&#8208;lactide, with PcZr(OiPr)3Li(THF) being the most active, while the PcNb(V) systems were either inactive or yielded oligomers.

         <title>The Ability of Enzymes to Preserve Reactive Conformations During Enzyme&#8208;Catalyzed Reactions can be an Important Factor for Efficient Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enzymes may not only generate catalytic competent conformations for enzyme&#8208;substrate complexes but also be able to preserve the reactive conformations to the stage when the reactions reach TS to allow catalytic residues to exert their effects. Such property could be lost for some mutants, leading to diminished TS stabilization and significant reduction of catalytic efficiency. Blue: enzyme; Yellow: substrate; Orange: the altered structure of substrate in TS.








Abstract
Determining strategies used by enzymes to achieve enormous rate enhancements has been a central goal in biochemical research. The abilities to form catalytic competent reactive conformations for enzyme&#8208;substrate complexes with well&#8208;positioned residues and to lower activation barriers through transition state (TS) stabilization are two accepted mechanisms. Enzymes might have evolved to possess other unrecognized strategies to achieve rate enhancements, and identification of such strategies is of fundamental importance. Here we perform a quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical study of carnosine N&#8208;methyltransferase 1 and its mutants, and results indicate that enzymes may possess the ability to preserve reactive conformations and prevent their premature distortions into less active forms during reactions. For wild&#8208;type, the reactive conformation can be formed in the enzyme&#8208;substrate complex and be preserved to the stage when the reaction reaches TS. For Tyr386Ala, Tyr396Asp, and Tyr398Ala, the wild&#8208;type&#8208;like reactive conformations can be formed in the mutant&#8208;substrate complexes but undergo distortions into less active conformations in the early stage of the reaction before TS. Such premature distortions of the wild&#8208;type&#8208;like reactive conformations in the mutant complexes prevent residues from fully exerting catalytic effects. Thus, the ability to preserve reactive conformations may be an important feature for some enzymes and can make important contributions to catalytic efficiency.

         <title>Rationalising Exciton Interactions in Aggregates Based on the Transition Density</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exciton coupling in organic chromophores is revisited through the lens of the transition density. The presented formalism gives insight into the strength and sign of the coupling based on the relative arrangement of the lobes of the transition density explaining oscillations between H&#8208; and J&#8208;aggregate behavior observed when two molecules are displaced relative to each other.








Abstract
Aggregation effects of molecular chromophores play a crucial role in determining the spectroscopic properties of solid&#8208;state organic materials. Within this work, we focus on excitonic coupling and particularly the question of whether aggregation leads to H&#8208; or J&#8208;type coupling, that is, whether the lowest energy excited state of the aggregate is optically bright or not. Employing a supermolecular picture to represent the different terms giving rise to exciton splitting, we develop an intuitive and generally applicable phenomenological model for estimating the sign and magnitude of the exciton coupling. This model, which is based on the shape of the monomer transition density is shown to be suitable across the whole range of relevant wave function types from purely Coulomb&#8208;coupled Frenkel excitons to strongly charge&#8208;transfer admixed excimer states. The implications are illustrated in the stacked anthracene and perylene&#8208;diimide dimer systems. The presented model does not only explain the long&#8208;range behavior but provides a clear explanation of atom&#8208;scale oscillations in the couplings seen for these systems. We hope that this work will give a boost to modern molecular materials science by providing new insight into interactions in the solid state as well as by highlighting the power of going beyond a simple frontier orbital picture in the design of molecular&#160;materials.

         <title>A Mechanistic Insight into the Emission Behavior of Boron Difluorohydrazones (BODIHYs): Suppression of Kasha's Rule</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anti&#8208;Kasha property of phenanthrene&#8208;based BODIHY compounds leads to excitation wavelength&#8208;dependent RGB emissions. Experimental and theoretical studies reveal that both molecules emit from three different excited states, namely S1, S2, and S3. Importantly, the phenyl&#8208;substituted BODIHY exhibits thermal equilibrium between S1 and S2, while S3 does not.








Abstract
Single component&#8208;based molecules and materials exhibiting excitation wavelength&#8208;dependent emission are of significant interest in both academic and industrial contexts. Luminophores capable of emitting multiple colors in response to different excitation wavelengths often deviate from Kasha's rule. The boron difluorohydrazone (BODIHY) derivatives reported herein exhibit excitation wavelength&#8208;dependent emissions, illuminating red, green, and blue (RGB) colors. Experimental and theoretical studies indicate that this multi&#8208;color luminescence originates from three bright excited states, namely, S1, S2, and S3. Such anomalous fluorescence in small organic molecules that possess three bright excited states and emit RGB as a function of excitation wavelength is unique and unprecedented. Time&#8208;dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) calculations indicate that the energy gap (&#916;E) between S2 and S3 exceeds 3000 cm&#8722;1 (0.37&#160;eV), facilitating radiative decay S3&#8594;S0 over the competitive nonradiative decay. For compound 1, the &#916;E(S1&#8211;S2) was found to be&#160;&lt;&#160;2000 cm&#8722;1 (0.25&#160;eV), leading to thermal equilibrium between the two states. In contrast, compound 2 possesses three distinct excited states that fluoresce independently due to large energy gaps between them. Furthermore, different excitation spectra, fluorescence lifetimes, and photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) for these emission bands indeed support the presence of three bright excited electronic states.

         <title>Quantum&#8208;Dots Light&#8208;Emitting Devices Based on Exciton Harvesting Layers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review introduces the concept and development of exciton harvesting layer (EHL) in quantum&#8208;dots light&#8208;emitting devices (QLEDs) as a targeted strategy to address carrier imbalance. We conclude its applicability from the QLEDs' working mechanisms, discuss the energy transfer mechanisms underlying EHL and its design principles, and highlights the significant performance improvements achieved in QLEDs.








Abstract
Quantum dot light&#8208;emitting diodes (QLEDs) have emerged as a promising technology for display and lighting applications due to their high color purity, tunable emission wavelengths, and solution processability. However, carrier imbalance arising from differences in injection barriers and mobilities between electrons and holes remains a significant challenge, leading to charge accumulation or leakage and resulting in performance losses. To address these issues, exciton harvesting layers (EHLs) have recently gained attention as an effective and targeted strategy. This review presents a comprehensive overview of the EHL concept and its development in QLEDs. We begin by introducing the fundamental properties of quantum dots (QDs) and the working principles of QLEDs, followed by a discussion of the applicability of the EHL strategy. We then detail the mechanisms of energy transfer within EHL and between EHL and QDs, as well as its optimization approaches. Subsequently, we summarize the application of EHLs in QLEDs and the corresponding improvements in device performance.

&lt;p&gt;This review introduces the concept and development of exciton harvesting layer (EHL) in quantum-dots light-emitting devices (QLEDs) as a targeted strategy to address carrier imbalance. We conclude its applicability from the QLEDs' working mechanisms, discuss the energy transfer mechanisms underlying EHL and its design principles, and highlights the significant performance improvements achieved in QLEDs.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quantum dot light-emitting diodes (QLEDs) have emerged as a promising technology for display and lighting applications due to their high color purity, tunable emission wavelengths, and solution processability. However, carrier imbalance arising from differences in injection barriers and mobilities between electrons and holes remains a significant challenge, leading to charge accumulation or leakage and resulting in performance losses. To address these issues, exciton harvesting layers (EHLs) have recently gained attention as an effective and targeted strategy. This review presents a comprehensive overview of the EHL concept and its development in QLEDs. We begin by introducing the fundamental properties of quantum dots (QDs) and the working principles of QLEDs, followed by a discussion of the applicability of the EHL strategy. We then detail the mechanisms of energy transfer within EHL and between EHL and QDs, as well as its optimization approaches. Subsequently, we summarize the application of EHLs in QLEDs and the corresponding improvements in device performance. Finally, we highlight current challenges and future research directions of the EHL strategy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Experimental Discovery and Electronic Structure of Free State Aminopentazole N5NH2 and its Cation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

N3&#8722;, N5+, cyclo&#8208;N5&#8722;, etc. are crucial all&#8208;nitrogen blocks for ANC. The free state N5NH2 and its cation N5NH3+ were synthesized via radical amination of cyclo&#8208;N5&#8722; and directional hydrolysis of imido&#8208;pentazoles N5N&#160;=&#160;CHN(Me)2.








Abstract
All&#8208;nitrogen compounds (ANC) that are environment&#8208;friendly and promising high&#8208;energy&#8208;density materials (HEDMs). N5NH2, an all&#8208;nitrogen building block with functional groups, can be converted into bridged&#8208;pentazole N10, azopentazole N12, etc. But N5NH2 synthesized by previous methods was bound in supramolecular frameworks and not isolated for further research. In this article, we synthesized free&#8208;state N5NH2 through radical amination of cyclo&#8208;N5&#8210; and its cation N5NH3+ by the directional hydrolysis of imido&#8208;pentazoles. The new structures were verified by MS, IR, NMR and powder diffraction, and their aromaticity, HOMO&#8208;LUMO, ESP, etc. were calculated by DFT. Experimental results show these compounds are only stable at low temperature. For instance, N5NH3+Cl&#8210; is stable below &#8210;20 &#176;C for 12&#160;hours. Harmonic oscillator model of aromaticity (HOMA), electron localization function (ELF), NICSZZ(1)&#960;, localized orbital locator (LOL), and anisotropy of the induced current density (ACID) show N5NH2 and N5NH3+ have aromaticity, and the order of aromaticity and stability is N5NH3+ &lt; N5NH2&#160;&lt;&#160;cyclo&#8208;N5&#8210;, consistent with experiments. The HOMO&#8208;LUMO energy gaps of N5NH2 (&#916;E&#160;=&#160;10.05&#160;eV) and N5NH3+ (&#916;E&#160;=&#160;10.14&#160;eV) is lower than that of cyclo&#8208;N5&#8210; (&#916;E&#160;=&#160;11.46&#160;eV), indicating higher reaction activity. The synthesis of free&#8208;state N5NH2 is a crucial step in all&#8208;nitrogen construction and promotes the energetic materials field toward all&#8208;nitrogen.

         <title>Biphasic Continuous Esterification of Choline Chloride&#8208;Based Deep Eutectic Solvents using ICHEM Technology: A Step toward New Hydrotropes with Potential Anticorrosive Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
Impact in Continuous Flow Heated Mechanochemistry (ICHEM) technology was used for the first biphasic continuous flow esterification of choline chloride&#8208;based deep eutectic solvents (DESs) with nonmiscible acetic, hexanoic, and octanoic anhydrides, resulting in the synthesis of novel hydrotropic DESs. The reaction was first optimized in batch using acetic anhydride, and then scaled up to continuous flow in an 80&#160;mL WAB Research Lab ICHEM reactor, achieving 90&#8211;95% yields at lab scales of 50&#8211;100&#160;g. The physicochemical properties of the three new DESs were analyzed, revealing that esterification via the ICHEM process had minimal impact on these properties compared to the conventional batch method. Furthermore, the potential of these new hydrotropic DESs as anticorrosive agents was evaluated, demonstrating their effectiveness as corrosion inhibitors.

         <title>Photoredox Mediated Synthesis of Substituted Imidazoles from Terminal Alkynes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A visible light photoredox&#8208;induced approach for the synthesis of substituted imidazoles via alkynes, glycine methyl ester, and thiophenol is presented. The reaction is driven via photoinduced exploration of alkynes and their combination with thiol, producing vinylic radical and its subsequent nucleophilic addition to glycine methyl ester as N&#8208;source to produce imidazoles via concurrent two C&#9472;N bond formations.








Abstract
A visible light photoredox&#8208;induced approach for the synthesis of substituted imidazoles via alkynes, glycine methyl ester, and thiophenol is presented. The reaction is facilitated by the photoinduced activation of alkynes, coupled with thiol, which generates a vinylic radical. This radical subsequently undergoes a nucleophilic addition to glycine methyl ester, serving as a nitrogen source, thereby leading to the formation of imidazoles through the concurrent creation of two carbon&#8208;nitrogen bonds.

         <title>Friedel&#8208;Crafts Reaction with Polyolefins as Alkylation Reagents and Poly(vinyl chloride) as Initiator</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report an upcycling strategy converting waste polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP) into monoalkylbenzenes via AlCl3&#8208;mediated Friedel&#8208;Crafts alkylation. With poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) as a cost&#8208;effective initiator and polyolefins as alkylation reagents under mild conditions, this method achieves complete polyolefin conversion while selectively yielding toluene, ethylbenzene, cumene, and n&#8208;propylbenzene.








Abstract
Chemical upcycling of waste plastic has attracted substantial attention. While current upcycling methods are typically successful in converting single&#8208;component plastic waste, conversion of mixed plastics resembling real&#8208;world plastic waste with a single catalytic system remains a challenge. In this manuscript, we report an upcycling method suitable for a range of polyolefins (including mixtures of PP, LDPE, HDPE, and PVC, the four most produced plastics), which selectively produces toluene, ethylbenzene, cumene, and propylbenzene in the presence of benzene. The generation of ethylbenzene and cumene as major upcycling products, currently produced from ethylene or propylene and benzene, effectively circumvents the thermodynamically unfavorable depolymerization of polyolefins, allowing polyolefins to function as olefin surrogates in organic transformations. The utilization of inexpensive AlCl3 as a pre&#8208;catalyst, tolerance to additives, and mild reaction conditions render this method readily adapted by the current industry setup. Therefore, this upcycling method may have some significant impact on the mitigation of the waste plastic crisis.

         <title>Front Cover: Fluorinated Trimers for Enhancing the Stability and Solubility of Organic Small Molecules Without Spectral Shifts: Ultrastable Ultraviolet Absorbers for Transparent Polyimide Films</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 45, August 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Front Cover shows the trimeric UV absorber F&#8208;TPBT, synthesized by linking three Tinuvin 327 monomers to a 1,3,5&#8208;fluorinated phenyl core. Compared to the monomer, this trimer design greatly enhances thermal and photostability while maintaining high solubility and unchanged optical properties. The image illustrates F&#8208;TPBT functioning effectively as a UV absorber within an optical film such as transparent polyimide fabricated at temperatures above 300&#160;&#176;C. More information can be found in the Research Article by T.&#160;G. Hwang, S.&#160;G. Lee, J.&#160;P. Kim and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202501742).

A trinuclear CoII complex stands at the centre of the room, and its projection under different lights reveals its solvatochromic behaviour. The redox state of the bridging ligand changes depending on the solvent: trissemiquinone in DCM and catecholate&#8208;bissemiquinone in DMF. Voltammograms and moving electrons highlight the redox multi&#8208;switch properties of this Co3HHTP complex. More information can be found in the Research Article by N. Bridonneau and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202501455).

         <title>Nanobodies in Immunoanalysis: From Molecular Engineering to Advanced Detection Strategies for Foodborne Natural Toxins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 45, August 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides a bottom&#8208;to&#8208;top overview of emerging nanobody&#8208;based immunoassays, from fundamental nanobodies to advanced applications in natural toxin detection.








Abstract
Natural toxins in food pose significant health risks, such as cancer, deformities, etc., demanding efficient and accurate surveillance techniques. Immunoassays become reliable alternatives to traditional chromatographic technologies for rapid, routine, and large&#8208;scale detection of natural toxins, but their performance depends highly on antibodies used, which are limited by stability issues and productions challenge. Nanobodies (Nbs) overcome these limitations, enhancing immunoassay sensitivity, specificity, and practicality for low&#8208;abundance toxin detection due to their good penetration/binding ability, inherent stability, and scalable production. This review offers a comprehensive, bottom&#8208;to&#8208;top overview of emerging Nb&#8208;based immunoassays, from foundational Nbs to advanced applications in natural toxin detection. The bioactivity of Nbs was summarized, focusing on their structural and functional characteristics critical for advancing immunoassays. Subsequently, the advanced methods for their screening, expression, and purification were outlined. Based on the natural toxins they target, both conventional and innovative Nb&#8208;based immunoassays are reviewed, in which corresponding Nbs modification strategies are highlighted for improving the affinity and sensitivity. The current challenges, potential strategies, and future opportunities for developing and applying Nb&#8208;based immunoassays are also discussed in natural toxin detection. This review, bridging fundamental Nb advances and immunoassay innovation, offers valuable perspectives to guide future development of Nb&#8208;based detection platforms.

         <title>Boron Cluster Functionalization: From Vertex&#8208;Specific Modifications to Boron Cage Extension</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 45, August 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
3D extended molecular systems constructed from boron clusters have attracted considerable attention owing to their unique structures and properties. Recent advances in functionalizing boron clusters, particularly through methodologies such as boron cage extension to create hybrid polycyclic conjugates, have been reviewed. These studies present new synthetic strategies for assembling the intricate molecular architectures, while also emphasizing their potential in driving innovations across materials science and chemistry.








Abstract
Polycyclic molecular systems, which play a crucial role in the fields of materials science and pharmacology, typically consist of 2D extended organic aromatic rings. Extensive research has been conducted on conjugates formed through &#960;&#8208;extension, leading to substantial advancements in the field. However, further exploration of novel conjugate systems is essential. This is necessary to enhance structural diversity and facilitate the development of advanced applications. Boron clusters, such as carboranes, are 3D aromatic structures featuring multiple C/B&#8211;H bonds. The functionalization of these C/B&#8211;H bonds offers a pathway for constructing a diverse array of carborane derivatives. In recent years, the extension of boron cages through the functionalization of boron clusters to generate hybrid polycyclic conjugates has attracted significant attention due to the promising properties and applications of these molecules. This review highlights the progress in boron cage modifications and boron cage extension over the past few years. It focuses on synthetic strategies and structure&#8208;property relationships of these hybrid conjugates.

         <title>Tuning the Transparency and Exciton Transition of D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A&#8208;&#960;&#8208;D Type Small Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 45, August 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Literature&#8208;based molecule preselection has been combined with TDDFT calculations to enhance the discovery of transparent organic small molecules. 54 candidates featuring a D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A&#8208;&#960;&#8208;D architecture were identified, and 24 molecules were selected for synthesis based on their favorable transparency. Among them, 6 molecules exhibit broad optical windows with selective absorption in the UV and NIR regions.








Abstract
Organic small molecules possess significant potential for semitransparent optoelectronic applications due to their tunable optical properties and inherent transparency. However, tailoring these materials is challenging as their optoelectronic properties are sensitive to subtle structural changes, compounded by the existence of over a million potential structural designs. To address these complexities, we present a material discovery workflow that combines literature&#8208;based molecule preselection with TDDFT calculations, creating customized small molecule structures with adjustable transparency windows. We identified fifty&#8208;four small molecules with a D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A&#8208;&#960;&#8208;D architecture, incorporating nine central (A) and six end (D) units connected by a thiophene &#960;&#8208;bridge. Through TDDFT calculations, we determined the theoretical absorption spectra and energy levels of the identified molecules. Ultimately, we synthesized twenty&#8208;four molecules that exhibit promising transparency properties by selectively absorbing photons in the ultraviolet (UV) and near&#8208;infrared (NIR) regions, with a significant optical transmission band relevant to the visible spectrum, which we will refer to as &#8220;optical window&#8221;. Characterization of the resultant small molecules revealed that six of them, in particular, exhibited selective absorption with the broadest &#8220;optical window&#8221;. We believe that our study will provide valuable insights to establish an effective material discovery workflow for highly transparent conjugated organic small molecules.

&lt;p&gt;Literature-based molecule preselection has been combined with TDDFT calculations to enhance the discovery of transparent organic small molecules. 54 candidates featuring a D-&#960;-A-&#960;-D architecture were identified, and 24 molecules were selected for synthesis based on their favorable transparency. Among them, 6 molecules exhibit broad optical windows with selective absorption in the UV and NIR regions.

Interaction of a membrane protein of Acinetobacter baumanii with human fibronectin unraveled using &#181;s&#8208;scale molecular dynamic simulations.








Abstract
Bacterial resistance and nosocomial infections are serious threats compromising public health in numerous countries. Acinetobacter baumannii has been identified as one of the most serious pathogens, due to its potential virulence and the development of multiple resistance. In this contribution by using all&#8208;atom molecular dynamics simulation, we analyze the structure and the properties of the OmpA protein, which is present in the bacterial external membrane. We also analyze the structure of possible protein/protein complexes formed between OmpA and the human fibronectin, which may ultimately lead to the immune escape of the bacteria. We provide a plausible structure of the complex, also identifying suitable amino acids mediating the interaction, and thus, constituting suitable drug targets to disrupt the complex formation.

         <title>A Polymer&#8208;Oriented Synthesis Of Triazinyl Functionalized Mesoporous Organic Polymer Encapsulating Uitrafine Metal Clusters for Alkynes Semi&#8208;Hydrogenation</title>

A polymer&#8208;oriented synthesis strategy is firstly proposed for the synthesis of triazinyl functionalized mesoporous organic polymer. Pd@TRI&#8208;MOP exhibits exceptional catalytic performance in semi&#8208;hydrogenation of alkynes.








Abstract
Preparation of highly dispersed ultrafine metal clusters (MCs)&#8208; based catalysts with good stability and preeminent catalytic performance is a challenging problem for heterogeneous catalysis. Herein, we design and controllably synthesize a triazinyl functionalized mesoporous organic polymer (TRI&#8208;MOP) through a polymer&#8208;oriented synthesis strategy using polyethyleneimine (PEI) as pore&#8208;forming agent. The obtained TRI&#8208;MOP material possesses abundant worm&#8208;like mesopores, rich triazinyl groups, and high stability. Ultrafine Pd clusters with a small size (&#8776;0.76&#160;nm) are successfully anchored in the mesoporous channel of TRI&#8208;MOP by a simple impregnation&#8208;reduction approach. The as&#8208;prepared Pd@TRI&#8208;MOP catalyst exhibits excellent catalytic activity (96%) and selectivity (97%) in the semi&#8208;hydrogenation of phenylacetylene under very mild reaction conditions. The exceptional performance of Pd@TRI&#8208;MOP catalyst is attributed to the small size effect of Pd clusters, the electron coupling effect between the supports and the Pd and enriched meso&#8208;scaled pores. Therefore, this work provides a new platform for designing and preparing stable functional porous organic polymer materials to confine size&#8208;controlled MCs with superior catalytic performance for diversified potential catalysis applications.

         <title>Conformational Transition of Viral Nucleic Acids in a Capsid&#8208;Like Confined Environment</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 45, August 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Viruses encapsulate their nucleic acids within the confined ionic environment of the capsid that can be mimicked using reverse micelles (RMs). Smaller RMs preferentially stabilize the G&#8208;quadruplex structure, whereas larger RMs shift the equilibrium toward the hairpin conformation. Understanding this conformational transition provides a novel strategy for modulating regulatory mechanisms of viral genes and their impact on viral gene expression.








Abstract
Nucleic acid molecules within viral genomes can fold into noncanonical structures, such as G&#8208;quadruplexes (G4s), which play crucial roles in regulating viral gene expression. These genomes are confined within capsid environments that vary in dimensions and ionic compositions. Structural transitions in RNA or DNA within these confined environments are essential for modulating viral biological functions; however, these transitions remain poorly understood. In this study, we demonstrated that an RNA sequence derived from the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV&#8208;1) genome adopts a dynamic equilibrium between G4 and hairpin (Hp) structures modulated by ionic conditions. The equilibrium shifts toward the G4 conformation in the presence of potassium (K&#8314;) and magnesium (Mg2&#8314;) ions. Using reverse micelles (RMs) as mimetics of the intracapsid environment, we showed that the size of the RM water pool influences significantly this equilibrium: smaller water pools favor G4 formation, whereas larger pools prefer the Hp structure owing to variations in the dielectric constant. Notably, the addition of Mg2&#8314; ions alters the size&#8208;dependent effects of RMs by stabilizing the G4 structure. These findings highlight the critical roles of environmental confinement and ionic conditions in regulating viral RNA structural dynamics, offering new insights into RNA&#8208;based regulatory mechanisms and their impact on viral gene expression.

         <title>Synthesis and Properties of Novel Glycerol&#8208;Derived Liquids with Dual Functional Groups: Nonsymmetric (E/Z)&#8208;Isomeric Mixtures of 1,3&#8208;Diether&#8208;2&#8208;Alkenes</title>

         <dc:description>
Nonsymmetric (E/Z) isomeric mixtures of 1,3&#8208;diether&#8208;2&#8208;alkene molecules based on a glycerol skeleton were synthesized via elimination reaction of precursors with varied R groups. The resulting products were thoroughly characterized using both experimental and computational techniques. The C&#160;&#9552;&#160;C double bond was also shown to be reactive for thiol&#8208;ene chemistry, indicating that these molecules may also have use as chemical intermediates. These alkenes expand the portfolio of products and reactions that utilize the advantageous versatility of glycerol and related products.








Abstract
This study introduces the synthesis and detailed characterization of six novel nonsymmetric (E/Z)&#8208;isomeric mixtures of 1,3&#8208;diether&#8208;2&#8208;alkenes derived from precursors with a glycerol skeleton: 1&#8208;((3&#8208;butoxyallyl)oxy)heptane ([H, A, B]), 1&#8208;(2&#8208;methoxyethoxy)&#8208;5&#8208;methylhex&#8208;2&#8208;ene ([ME, A, IP]), 1&#8208;((3&#8208;(2&#8208;methoxyethoxy)prop&#8208;1&#8208;en&#8208;1&#8208;yl)oxy)butane ([ME, A, B]), ((3&#8208;isopropoxyprop&#8208;1&#8208;en&#8208;1&#8208;yl)oxy)benzene ([IP, A, Ph]), ((3&#8208;(2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethoxy)prop&#8208;1&#8208;en&#8208;1&#8208;yl)oxy)benzene ([F, A, Ph]), and 1&#8208;(allyloxy)&#8208;3&#8208;(2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethoxy)prop&#8208;1&#8208;ene ([F, A, A]). These compounds were synthesized via a three&#8208;step reaction starting from various glycidyl ethers, purified by fractional distillation and drying, and obtained with overall isolated yields of at least 60%. The ratio of isomer configurations (E:E:Z:Z) varied based on substituents R1 and R2. Thermophysical properties, including density, refractive index (RI), and viscosity, were evaluated at temperatures of 293.15 to 333.15 and 353.15&#160;K. CO2 absorption capacity (Henry's constants) of compound [F, A, A] was assessed at temperatures of 303.15, 318.15, 333.15, and 348.15&#160;K under CO2 pressures from 2 to 10 atm. Density, viscosity, vapor pressure, enthalpy of vaporization, and dipole moment were also calculated for each compound. Moreover, the nonsymmetric alkenes&#8217; C&#160;&#9552;&#160;C double bond was shown to readily react with thiols via thiol&#8208;ene coupling. The resulting thioether linkage exhibits high stability under physiological conditions, making these compounds promising intermediates for synthesizing more complex glycerol&#8208;based molecules.

&lt;p&gt;This study introduces the synthesis and detailed characterization of six novel nonsymmetric (&lt;i&gt;E/Z&lt;/i&gt;)-isomeric mixtures of 1,3-diether-2-alkenes derived from precursors with a glycerol skeleton: 1-((3-butoxyallyl)oxy)heptane ([H, A, B]), 1-(2-methoxyethoxy)-5-methylhex-2-ene ([ME, A, IP]), 1-((3-(2-methoxyethoxy)prop-1-en-1-yl)oxy)butane ([ME, A, B]), ((3-isopropoxyprop-1-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene ([IP, A, Ph]), ((3-(2,2,2-trifluoroethoxy)prop-1-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene ([F, A, Ph]), and 1-(allyloxy)-3-(2,2,2-trifluoroethoxy)prop-1-ene ([F, A, A]). These compounds were synthesized via a three-step reaction starting from various glycidyl ethers, purified by fractional distillation and drying, and obtained with overall isolated yields of at least 60%. The ratio of isomer configurations (&lt;i&gt;E:E:Z:Z&lt;/i&gt;) varied based on substituents R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Thermophysical properties, including density, refractive index (RI), and viscosity, were evaluated at temperatures of 293.15 to 333.15 and 353.15&#160;K. CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; absorption capacity (Henry's constants) of compound [F, A, A] was assessed at temperatures of 303.15, 318.15, 333.15, and 348.15&#160;K under CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; pressures from 2 to 10 atm. Density, viscosity, vapor pressure, enthalpy of vaporization, and dipole moment were also calculated for each compound. Moreover, the nonsymmetric alkenes&#8217; C&#160;&#9552;&#160;C double bond was shown to readily react with thiols via thiol-ene coupling. The resulting thioether linkage exhibits high stability under physiological conditions, making these compounds promising intermediates for synthesizing more complex glycerol-based molecules.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Solvatochromism and Redox Multi&#8208;Switch in a Trinuclear Cobalt(II) Complex</title>

A trinuclear cobalt(II) complex incorporating the redox&#8208;active H6HHTP ligand is isolated in two redox states: [CoII3(sq&#8208;sq&#8208;sq)]3+ and [CoII3(cat&#8208;sq&#8208;sq)]2+ (sq&#160;= semiquinone; cat&#160;= catecholate), enabled by its remarkable solvatochromic behavior. The ligand field tuning of the Co(II) centers through the ancillary ligand allows accessing six reversible one&#8208;electron processes, increasing the range of redox&#8208;coupled magnetic and optical switching in this system.








Abstract
A trinuclear cobalt(II) complex incorporating the redox&#8208;active hexahydroxytriphenylene (H6HHTP) ligand was prepared and isolated in two different redox states: [CoII3(sq&#8208;sq&#8208;sq)]3+ (1) and [CoII3(cat&#8208;sq&#8208;sq)]2+ (2) (sq&#160;= semiquinone; cat&#160;= catecholate), enabled by its remarkable solvatochromic behavior. The ligand field tuning of the Co(II) centers through the ancillary ligand Me3TPA (tris(6&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;pyridylmethyl)amine) allowed accessing six reversible one&#8208;electron processes instead of only three with the parent TPA ligand, therefore increasing the range of redox&#8208;coupled magnetic and optical switching in this system. Upon reduction, the three redox processes are ligand&#8208;centered and involve the three sq&#8226;&#8722;/cat2&#8722; couples of hexahydroxytriphenylene (HHTP), while we hypothesize that some of the oxidation processes may involve the Co(II) metallic species.

         <title>Chalcogen&#8208;Guided Control of Azoarene Photoswitching: Tuning Excited&#8208;State Energies Through Electronic Property Modulation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 45, August 13, 2025. </description>

Photophysical properties of ortho&#8208;tellurium&#8208;substituted azoarenes are tunable via aryl substituent electronics and tellurium oxidation state. Electron&#8208;donating groups destabilize the excited state three&#8208;electron &#963; bond, enhancing photoisomerization. Oxidation removes the tellurium lone pair required for the described interaction, further boosting switching.








Abstract
In recent years, chalcogen bonding has emerged as a promising alternative to classical supramolecular interactions such as hydrogen or halogen bonds. While its behavior in the electronic ground state has been extensively studied, its role in the excited state is gaining increasing attention. We recently demonstrated that the lack of photoswitchability of ortho&#8208;tellurated azobenzenes is due to an excitation&#8208;induced conversion of the classical chalcogen bond into a more pronounced, electron&#8208;rich three&#8208;electron &#963; bond. This transformation significantly strengthens the interaction between the chalcogen and the Lewis base center, effectively preventing isomerization. Based on these findings, we have now investigated the photoswitching behavior of ortho&#8208;tellurium&#8208;substituted azoarenes by modulation of the electronic properties of the aryl substituent and the oxidation state of the tellurium center. Our results show that electron&#8208;donating groups destabilize the excited&#8208;state geometry associated with the formation of a three&#8208;electron &#963; bond, thereby restoring photoisomerizability. Furthermore, oxidation to the Te(IV) species disrupts this bonding interaction, leading to significantly enhanced photoswitching properties. Together, these findings provide valuable design principles for the development of multiresponsive molecular switches based on chalcogen bonding and excited&#8208;state control.

         <title>Mechanical Strain&#8208;Controlled Aromaticity in Cyclo[n]Carbons</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 45, August 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanical strain can influence the (anti)aromaticity of C16 and C18 cyclocarbons. While uniaxial tension has a minor weakening effect, radial expansion leads to an almost complete loss of aromaticity in both systems. Radial contraction, especially in C18, significantly enhances aromaticity, offering a strategy for designing more stable cyclocarbons in mechanically interlocked architectures.








Abstract
Cyclocarbons have unique electronic and mechanical properties, but their extreme reactivity makes experimental studies and practical applications highly challenging. In this work, we use molecular modeling to investigate how mechanical strain, including uniaxial tension and radial contraction/expansion, affects the aromaticity of C16 and C18 cyclocarbons. Aromaticity was evaluated using magnetic (NICS, GIMIC) and electronic (&#960;&#8208;EDDB, AV1245) indices to provide a comprehensive assessment. Our results show that uniaxial tension slightly reduces the (anti)aromaticity of both cyclocarbons, with C16 becoming less antiaromatic and C18 less aromatic. Radial expansion leads to almost complete loss of aromaticity, regardless of the initial electronic nature of the cyclocarbon. In turn, radial contraction appears to be an effective approach to enhance electronic delocalization in cyclocarbons, with a particularly notable effect for C18. One of the most significant findings is that an 8% radial contraction transforms moderately aromatic C18 into a highly aromatic system with fully equalized bond lengths, offering a potential strategy for designing more stable cyclocarbon systems within mechanically strained architectures.

Peptide&#8208;based cationic [2]catenanes are resistant to proteases and efficiently complex siRNA, providing protection from degradation by nucleases.








Abstract
Cationic [2]catenanes bearing l&#8208;arginine residues were synthesized via dynamic covalent self&#8208;assembly in water. These peptide&#8208;based mechanically interlocked molecules (MIMs) exhibit proteolytic stability, efficiently complex small&#8208;interfering RNA (siRNA), and protect it from nuclease degradation. Their performance in siRNA binding is attributed to multivalency and preorganization enforced by the mechanical bond.

         <title>Aggregation&#8208;Induced Phosphorescence of a Trans&#8208;Bis(iminomethylpyrolato)Platinum Complex Bearing a Polymethylene Vaulted Structure: Chain Length&#8211;Dependent Solid&#8208;State Emissions</title>

Platinum(II) complexes featuring a vaulted polymethylene bridge exhibit efficient AIE. An odd&#8208;even effect in chain length is also observed in the AIE behavior, where strong phosphorescence emerges from dimer formation in crystals. Theoretical calculations imply that dimerization raises the MECP, suppressing nonradiative decay.








Abstract
Aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) has recently attracted considerable attention. Although phosphorescent transition&#8208;metal complexes exhibit significant potential as aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogens (AIEgens), their exploration and utilization have remained limited, partly due to the insufficient understanding of the underlying mechanisms. Here, we report a new series of platinum(II) complexes, trans&#8208;bis(2&#8208;iminomethylpyrrolato)platinum derivatives (1a&#8211;d), which feature vaulted polymethylene chains of varying lengths (n&#160;=&#160;9&#8211;12) that bridge over the metal atom. Notably, racemic complexes 1b and 1d (with chain lengths of 10 and 12) exhibit strong yellow emission in the crystalline state (quantum yields of 24% and 33%, respectively), despite showing no emission in solution. X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis revealed face&#8208;to&#8208;face dimer packing in these emissive crystals, suggesting that dimer formation contributes to their enhanced emission. In contrast, complexes with odd&#8208;numbered chain lengths (1a and 1c) showed no such emission enhancement. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the minimum energy crossing point (MECP) between the excited triplet and ground state lies at significantly higher energy in the dimeric structure than in the monomer, suggesting suppression of nonradiative decay in the crystalline state. This work provides a design strategy for inducing solid&#8208;state phosphorescence by controlling the 3D molecular structure to facilitate favorable molecular stacking while suppressing nonradiative decay pathways.

         <title>Probing How Anti&#8208;huntingtin Antibodies Bind the Fibrillar Fuzzy Coat Using Solid&#8208;State NMR</title>

Antibodies are widely used to recognize, detect, and target aggregated and misfolded amyloid&#8208;forming proteins, including those associated with HD. Studying such interactions on a structural level is a challenge. Parlato and colleagues report on their use of solid&#8208;state NMR and electron microscopy to probe how such antibodies bind to the fuzzy coat of HTT fibrils, modulating their structure and supramolecular assembly.








Abstract
Antibodies are critical for the immune response and serve as important tools due to their ability to recognize specific amino acid sequences, or epitopes. Based on the latter, they are utilized as diagnostic tools in biological and biomedical research. Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative condition caused by CAG repeat expansions in the huntingtin (HTT) gene and characterized by amyloid&#8208;like protein deposits in patients. Multiple anti&#8208;HTT antibodies are used in HD research for their ability to recognize specific HTT inclusions in both post&#8208;mortem tissue and in laboratory conditions. Some of the antibodies are seen as detectors of distinct structural motifs. However, most knowledge of their binding mechanism stems from studies of soluble monomers or short fragments of the epitopes, rather than the aggregated, misfolded target protein. Here, we investigate how MW8 antibodies interact with HTT exon 1 (HTTex1) fibrils, using solid&#8208;state NMR, electron microscopy, and complementary techniques. Magic angle spinning (MAS) NMR revealed localized impacts of the antibody on exposed parts of the HTTex1 fibrils: the flanking segments that form its &#8220;fuzzy coat&#8221;. Antibody binding affected the structure and dynamics of the fuzzy coat, but also modulated the propensity for forming supramolecular fibril clusters, which has important implications for (reducing) cytotoxicity.

         <title>A Water Stable U(IV) Complex Based on a Macrocyclic Ligand Displaying NIR Emission</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 45, August 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A water&#8208;stable U(IV) complex is obtained by coordination of U(IV) with a nonadentate macrocyclic ligand based on a triazacyclononane platform. The U(IV) cation is fully protected from coordination of water molecules, and upon excitation into the UV&#8208;Visible region, the complex displays an unprecedented NIR emission from U(IV).








Abstract
Complexation of U(IV) by encapsulation into the cavity of a 1,4,7&#8208;triazacyclonane (tacn) macrocycle functionalized by phosphonated pyridyl arms affords a water&#8208;stable and soluble [U(IV)L] complex. The coordination process was monitored by electronic UV&#8208;Vis&#8208;NIR absorption spectroscopy and the corresponding complex was characterized by 1H&#8208;, 13C&#8208; and 31P&#8208;NMR spectroscopy and by mass spectrometry. Density functional theory (DFT) modeling shows the cation to be embedded into the cavity of the nonadentate ligand, as confirmed by analysis of the paramagnetic contributions of U(IV) on the chemical shifts of the proton nuclei. This effective chelation enabled the observation of a broad NIR emission band centered at 1080&#160;nm observed for the first time in addition to UV&#8208;visible emission arising from the U(IV) cation upon electronic excitation in the UV&#8208;blue region. The [U(IV)L] complex was shown to be hydrolytically stable for several weeks in aqueous solutions over a broad range of pH values (from 1.6 to 10) under aerobic conditions.

         <title>Polymerization Order in the Synthesis of 2D Block Supramolecular Copolymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 45, August 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, it is shown that, as in the case of block copolymerization in covalent polymer chemistry, the order of the polymerization of two monomers has a critical effect in the synthesis of 2D block copolymers of porphyrin&#8208;based monomers. In one of the orders of polymerization, secondary nucleation is involved, leading to nanosheets with uncontrolled areas and edge roughness.








Abstract
In the synthesis of block polymers through living polymerization, the order in which the monomers are copolymerized can have a critical effect on the polymerization efficacy. The same should hold true for the synthesis of block supramolecular polymers; however, this remains unexplored. The effect of the order of the polymerization of the monomers in 2D seeded/living supramolecular block copolymerization of porphyrin&#8208;based monomers is investigated. Unlike 1D living polymers, 2D supramolecular polymers (or nanosheets) have two distinct propagation sites. It is shown that inverting the order of polymerization can lead to distinct growth modes; importantly, secondary nucleation is involved in one of these cases. If secondary nucleation takes place at the edges of the seeds prior to 2D growth, the resulting nanosheets tend to exhibit uncontrolled areas and edge roughness.

         <title>Fluorinated Trimers for Enhancing the Stability and Solubility of Organic Small Molecules Without Spectral Shifts: Ultrastable Ultraviolet Absorbers for Transparent Polyimide Films</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 45, August 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular design strategy employing a fluorinated phenyl linker to trimerize small molecules was validated using a model small molecule (Tinuvin 327 UV absorber). The resulting trimer (F&#8208;TPBT) showed greatly enhanced thermal stability and solubility with minimal spectral change. This strategy provides significant insight into the rational design of highly stable molecules for commercial optical applications.








Abstract
The development of highly stable organic small molecules for optical applications is of growing interest. Multimerization of monomeric small molecules can enhance stability via increased &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking, but it often reduces solubility and induces undesirable spectral shifts due to &#960;&#8208;extension. To overcome this trade&#8208;off, we report a trimeric small molecule (F&#8208;TPBT) derived from a model monomer (Tinuvin 327) using a 1,3,5&#8208;fluorinated phenyl linker. This design markedly improves thermal stability and solubility while minimizing changes in the optical absorption spectrum. F&#8208;TPBT shows superior thermal properties (5 wt% decomposition temperature&#160;=&#160;427&#160;&#176;C; weight loss after 1&#160;hour at 300&#160;&#176;C&#160;=&#160;0.32&#160;wt%) and excellent solubility (5.3 wt% in dichloromethane; 6.4 wt% in N&#8208;methylpyrrolidone (NMP)), with an absorption spectrum nearly identical to that of Tinuvin 327. These properties make F&#8208;TPBT a promising UV light absorber for transparent polyimide (TPI) films, which require processing above 300&#160;&#176;C and are widely used in flexible displays. Notably, F&#8208;TPBT&#8208;containing films retain their absorption properties even after 80&#160;hours of accelerated UV irradiation, demonstrating excellent photostability.

     alt="Fluorinated Trimers for Enhancing the Stability and Solubility of Organic Small Molecules Without Spectral Shifts: Ultrastable Ultraviolet Absorbers for Transparent Polyimide Films"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A molecular design strategy employing a fluorinated phenyl linker to trimerize small molecules was validated using a model small molecule (Tinuvin 327 UV absorber). The resulting trimer (F-TPBT) showed greatly enhanced thermal stability and solubility with minimal spectral change. This strategy provides significant insight into the rational design of highly stable molecules for commercial optical applications.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of highly stable organic small molecules for optical applications is of growing interest. Multimerization of monomeric small molecules can enhance stability via increased &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking, but it often reduces solubility and induces undesirable spectral shifts due to &#960;-extension. To overcome this trade-off, we report a trimeric small molecule (F-TPBT) derived from a model monomer (Tinuvin 327) using a 1,3,5-fluorinated phenyl linker. This design markedly improves thermal stability and solubility while minimizing changes in the optical absorption spectrum. F-TPBT shows superior thermal properties (5 wt% decomposition temperature&#160;=&#160;427&#160;&#176;C; weight loss after 1&#160;hour at 300&#160;&#176;C&#160;=&#160;0.32&#160;wt%) and excellent solubility (5.3 wt% in dichloromethane; 6.4 wt% in N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP)), with an absorption spectrum nearly identical to that of Tinuvin 327. These properties make F-TPBT a promising UV light absorber for transparent polyimide (TPI) films, which require processing above 300&#160;&#176;C and are widely used in flexible displays. Notably, F-TPBT-containing films retain their absorption properties even after 80&#160;hours of accelerated UV irradiation, demonstrating excellent photostability. This study presents a broadly applicable molecular design strategy for enhancing the stability and solubility of organic small molecules while avoiding significant spectral shifts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chiral Dominance in Supramolecular Co&#8208;assemblies via Cation&#8211;&#960; Driven Stereochemical Locking</title>

         <dc:description>
Chiral dominance observed in binary assemblies composed of dibenzoyl&#8208;substituted tartaric acid (a1) and enantiomeric pyridine derivatives (R/S&#8208;py). Protonation of R/S&#8208;py enables a1 to override co&#8208;assembly chirality via in situ cation&#8208;&#960; interactions, inducing stereoconfiguration&#8208;locked H&#8208;aggregates.








Abstract
Controlling supramolecular chirality in multicomponent systems remains a significant challenge due to competing stereochemical interactions. In this study, we report a case of competitive chiral dominance in binary co&#8208;assemblies composed of enantiomeric tartaric acid derivatives (a1 and a2) and enantiomeric pyridine derivatives (R/S&#8208;py). The dibenzoyl&#8208;substituted tartaric acid (a1) is capable of overriding the chirality of the co&#8208;assemblies by protonating the chiral pyridines to form pyridinium&#8211;carboxylate pairs. This interaction induces in situ cation&#8211;&#960; interactions, leading to the formation of stereoconfiguration&#8208;locked H&#8208;aggregates. In contrast, the pivaloyl&#8208;substituted tartaric acid (a2) exhibits chirality bias governed by the enantiopure pyridine derivatives, attributed to its increased steric bulk and the absence of cation&#8211;&#960; interactions. These findings not only advance the fundamental understanding of stereochemical communication but also offer a new strategy for controlling hierarchical chirality in complex supramolecular systems.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Cycloaddition of CO2 with Epoxides Catalyzed by Recyclable Mg2&#8314;/TiO2 Photocatalyst Operating at Room Temperature</title>

         <dc:description>
A recyclable Mg2&#8314;/TiO&#8322; photocatalyst enables the cycloaddition of CO&#8322; with epoxides under visible light at room temperature, providing a sustainable route to cyclic carbonates without the need for solvents or harsh conditions. The catalyst shows a broad substrate scope, excellent yields, and recyclability, including successful gram&#8208;scale synthesis. Furthermore, the system demonstrates real&#8208;world applicability through CO&#8322; capture from simulated exhaust gas. Mechanistic insights supported by DFT calculations revealed a visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven radical pathway via bromide activation.








Abstract
The utilization of CO2 as a C1 building block remains a key challenge in sustainable organic synthesis. We now report a recyclable metal ion modified titanium oxide (Mn+/TiO2, where Mn+ represents Mg2+, Rh3+, Cr3+, Mn2+, Fe2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, Zn2+, and Al3+) photocatalytic system used with a tetrabutylammonium halide (TBAX, X&#160;=&#160;I, Br, Cl) as a co&#8208;catalyst, which enables the cycloaddition of CO2 with various epoxides under visible light irradiation at room temperature. This catalyst system exhibits a broad range of responsiveness to visible light and is compatible with simulated solar light, and operates solvent&#8208;free conditions without the need for high pressure. Excellent yields and selectivities were achieved by the Mg2+/TiO2 photocatalyst, and the method was successfully scaled to gram&#8208;scale synthesis without any loss of efficiency. Simulated post&#8208;combustion exhaust gas (CO2: 7.5%, N2: 92.5%, relative humidity: 90%) was concentrated to 97% and used for the reaction, yielding 88% styrene carbonate from styrene oxide by the catalysis of Mg2+/TiO2. Furthermore, the Mg2+/TiO2 catalyst could be readily recovered and reused over multiple cycles. Mechanistic investigations supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicated that the bromine radical (Br&#8226;), generated via photooxidation of bromide ion from TBABr, initiates the epoxide ring&#8208;opening.

         <title>Amorphous Nickel Hydroxide Shell Encloses the Nickel Sulfide for Electrochemical Water Oxidation at Low Overpotential</title>

A NiSx/Ni(OH)2 catalyst with an amorphous/crystalline heterointerface was fabricated via precise phase modulation. The Ni(OH)2 shell coating significantly boosts catalytic activity, enhances long&#8208;term stability, and improves overall performance compared to pristine NiSx.








Abstract
Despite the remarkable hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance demonstrated by transition metal sulfides, their practical application in overall water splitting remains constrained by insufficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity, particularly under alkaline conditions. This limitation primarily arises from unstable active sites and sluggish reaction kinetics at high oxidation potentials. To address these challenges, we present a novel heterostructure engineering strategy through gradient phase control. The core innovation of this work lies in the construction of a unique amorphous/crystalline heterointerface through precise phase modulation. Our hierarchical architecture features phase&#8208;mixed nickel sulfides of NiS and Ni3S2 (use NiSx abbreviation) encapsulated by an amorphous Ni(OH)2 shell. In which the NiSx provides rapid electron transport channels, and the amorphous shell serves as both protective and activation functions through dynamically reconfigurable surface coordination. As expected, the synthesized NiSx/Ni(OH)2 catalyst achieved excellent performance, it achieves a current density of 100&#160;mA cm&#8315;2 at only 160&#160;mV overpotential, significantly outperforming its precursor materials, Ni(OH)&#8322; (446&#160;mV) and NiSx (212&#160;mV). More significantly, the catalyst demonstrates exceptional operational stability with&#160;&lt;&#160;2% activity decay during prolonged 200&#8208;h continuous electrolysis. This provides a new way to commercialize non&#8208;precious metal electrocatalysts instead of precious metal catalysts.

         <title>Heavy&#8208;Atom Free Bodipy&#8208;Borafluorene Photosensitizer Decorated with Coumarin Antenna Selectively Staining Endoplasmic Reticulum for Application in PDT</title>

A heavy&#8208;atom free BODIPY photosensitizer localizing in the endoplasmic reticulum that efficiently generates singlet&#8208;oxygen causing cell death upon light activation.








Abstract
The organelle&#8208;localized photodynamic therapy (PDT) has become a promising strategy for efficient cancer treatment. The photogeneration of reactive oxygen species in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) leads to lipid oxidation and causes cell apoptosis or necrosis. However, most of the commercially available ER&#8208;localized phototherapeutic agents exhibit dark cytotoxicity related to the presence of heavy atoms. In this contribution, we developed a novel heavy&#8208;atom free BODIPY photosensitizer that localizes selectively in the ER with good biocompatibility, small dark cytotoxicity and efficient singlet oxygen generation, causing cellular death in a PDT experiment. The molecular design of the BODIPY PS involves two key elements: (i) replacing of the common BF2 group with the 9&#8208;borafluorene which strongly enhances intersystem crossing to the triplet state responsible for photogeneration of singlet oxygen, and (ii) introduction of the pendant coumarin group ensuring ER&#8208;localization and serving as light&#8208;harvesting antenna for energy transfer to BODIPY core structure. The localization of BODIPY&#8208;based PS was confirmed by laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM) imaging, and co&#8208;staining revealed strong localization within the ER.

&lt;p&gt;A heavy-atom free BODIPY photosensitizer localizing in the endoplasmic reticulum that efficiently generates singlet-oxygen causing cell death upon light activation.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The organelle-localized photodynamic therapy (PDT) has become a promising strategy for efficient cancer treatment. The photogeneration of reactive oxygen species in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) leads to lipid oxidation and causes cell apoptosis or necrosis. However, most of the commercially available ER-localized phototherapeutic agents exhibit dark cytotoxicity related to the presence of heavy atoms. In this contribution, we developed a novel heavy-atom free BODIPY photosensitizer that localizes selectively in the ER with good biocompatibility, small dark cytotoxicity and efficient singlet oxygen generation, causing cellular death in a PDT experiment. The molecular design of the BODIPY PS involves two key elements: (i) replacing of the common BF2 group with the 9-borafluorene which strongly enhances intersystem crossing to the triplet state responsible for photogeneration of singlet oxygen, and (ii) introduction of the pendant coumarin group ensuring ER-localization and serving as light-harvesting antenna for energy transfer to BODIPY core structure.

         <title>Synthesis and Self&#8208;Assembly of a Discotic Oligo&#8208;Carboxylate Tetra&#8208;Porphyrin&#8208;Perylenebisimide Amphiphile</title>

We report on the synthesis of a new amphiphilic tetra&#8208;ortho&#8208;porphyrin PBI pentad. The pentads are characterized by quenching of the fluorescence emission, indicating efficient photo&#8208;induced charge&#8208;transfer. The amphiphiles show solubility in basic aqueous solutions of THF, where high water contents lead to a PBI&#8208;centered aggregation. TEM imaging reveals the morphology as randomly coiled sheets consisting out of highly regular assemblies.








Abstract
We report the synthesis of an amphiphilic tetra&#8208;porphyrin perylenebisimide (PBI) conjugate via four&#8208;fold Suzuki cross&#8208;coupling at the PBI ortho&#8208;position. Oligo&#8208;carboxylate Newkome&#8208;type G1 dendrons attached at the porphyrin periphery serve as polar head groups. Theoretical modelling corroborated the assumed planar discotic geometry. The amphiphile is very soluble in mixtures of basic water and THF, where it displays strong aggregation at high water content. Insights into the self&#8208;assembly process were obtained by tracking the individualization through THF addition using UV/Vis absorption spectroscopy. Here, a PBI&#8208;centred aggregation motif becomes evident. Further evaluation of the morphology via STEM and TEM imaging reveals that the assembly is guided by hydrophobic interactions as well as interactions of the carboxylates. These ortho&#8208;linked tetra&#8208;porphyrin PBI architectures fill a gap within the known families of porphyrin&#8208;PBI conjugates. Furthermore, the amphiphile is a valuable addition to the library of amphiphilic porphyrin&#8208;PBI conjugates, representing a discotic counterpart to the known calamitic architectures.

         <title>Polarization and Dipole Moment Effects on Sigma&#8208;Hole Potential in Tin(IV)&#8208;Porphyrins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 45, August 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through this work with experimental and computational studies we have systematically investigated the role of interplay of electronic effects such as polarization, dipole moment and resonance on the sigma&#8208;hole potential in macrocyclic system like, metalloporphyrin system. The behavior of the sigma&#8208;hole potential of equatorial iodine atom of metalloporphyrin has been studied upon changing substituted ligands at axial position in metalloporphyrin.








Abstract
This study investigates how electron&#8208;withdrawing substitution, molecular polarization, and dipole moment influence the &#963;&#8208;hole potential in six&#8208;coordinate metalloporphyrins. To evaluate halogen bonding tendencies, we synthesized a series of five Sn(IV)&#8208;5,10,15,20&#8208;meso&#8208;tetrakis(4&#8208;iodophenyl)porphyrin complexes with various fluorinated phenolate axial ligands. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis revealed distinct halogen&#8208;bonded supramolecular motifs, which vary depending on the degree of fluorination at the axial ligands. Our findings highlight the critical role of ligand&#8208;induced polarization and dipole moment variations in modulating the &#963;&#8208;hole characteristics of the equatorial iodine atoms. Computational modelling showed that increased fluorine substitution reduces both the atomic dipole moments of fluorine and the polarizability of the central tin ion. However, despite these changes, the axial fluorination has a negligible effect on the &#963;&#8208;hole potential at the iodine atoms. This limited influence is attributed to the orthogonal orientation between the porphyrin core and the peripheral phenyl rings, which suppresses resonance interactions. Overall, this work emphasizes the importance of understanding electronic effects at the molecular level, particularly in the design and formation of halogen&#8208;bonded supramolecular architectures.

Alkyne insertion into the Sn&#9472;Si bond of a silyl&#8208;substituted stannylene occurs regio&#8208;selectively and &#8208; in the cases of more sterically encumbered substrates &#8208; reversibly








Abstract
A range of aryl&#8208; and alkyl&#8208; substituted alkynes has been shown to insert regio&#8208;selectively into the Sn&#9472;Si bond of the electron&#8208;rich aryl(silyl)stannylene, ArMesSnSi(SiMe3)3 (ArMes&#160;=&#160;2,6&#8208;Mes2C6H3, Mes&#160;=&#160;2,4,6&#8208;Me3C6H2) to generate a series of vinyl&#8208;stannylene products. In all cases, the product features a syn arrangement of Sn and Si&#8208;containing groups about the resulting carbon&#8211;carbon double bond; in the case of unsymmetrical alkynes, the more sterically bulky group is exclusively incorporated in the 1&#8208;position (i.e., proximal to Sn). Remarkably, insertion is shown to occur reversibly in the cases of 3&#8208;hexyne and trimethylsilylacetylene. The thermodynamic parameters associated with these processes have been determined by variable temperature NMR spectroscopy, and the activation barriers associated with the key mechanistic steps elucidated by quantum mechanical methods.

         <title>Tetrahydropyranyl Backbone Protection for Enhanced Fmoc Solid&#8208;Phase Peptide Synthesis</title>

Abstract
Fmoc solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis has been indispensable for the efficient manufacture of research grade peptides and proteins, and peptide APIs. However, the solid&#8208;phase approach is still hampered by solubility issues and aggregation of the resin&#8208;bound peptide chain, which limits routine access to peptides&#160;&gt;&#160;40 amino acids in length. The use of backbone amide protecting groups, such as through the introduction of N&#8208;benzyl&#8208;based moieties and pseudoproline dipeptides, ameliorates this synthetic inefficiency somewhat. But benzyl groups can be difficult to remove postassembly, and pseudoprolines are limited to serine, threonine, and cysteine&#8208;rich peptide segments. To enhance the utility of backbone protection, we have evaluated the tetrahydropyranyl (Thp) group as a more acid labile alternative to benzyl protection. The Thp group can be efficiently introduced to the resin&#8208;bound peptide as a protected dipeptide and is readily cleaved and scavenged postsynthesis. A drastic improvement in the solid&#8208;phase assembly of aggregation&#8208;prone amyloid&#8208;&#946; and prion&#8208;derived peptide fragments is observed using Thp as a backbone protecting group. We envisage that Thp&#8208;protected dipeptides will become useful building blocks for peptide manufacturing, complementing existing backbone protecting group strategies.

         <title>Understanding Small Molecule Activation Promoted by Heavier Benzene 1,4&#8208;diides: Interplay Between Diradical Character and Aromaticity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 45, August 13, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intricate relationship between diradical character, aromaticity, and reactivity in annulated heavier Group 14 benzene&#8208;1,4&#8208;diides (see picture) has been investigated through Density Functional Theory and ab initio calculations. A direct correlation between reactivity and diradical character, both of which increase down Group 14, is found.








Abstract
The intricate relationship between diradical character, aromaticity, and reactivity in annulated heavier Group 14 benzene&#8208;1,4&#8208;diides, that is, [(ADC)E]2 (E&#160;=&#160;Si, Ge, Sn), based on an anionic dicarbene framework, (ADC&#160;=&#160;PhC{N(Ar)C}2: Ar&#160;=&#160;aryl), has been investigated through Density Functional Theory and ab initio calculations. The diradical character of both homo&#8208; [(ADC)E]2 and heteroleptic [(ADC)2EE'] systems (E &#8800; E') has been accurately computed, while the aromaticity of their corresponding closed&#8208;shell (CS) and open&#8208;shell (OS) singlet states has been evaluated using magnetic descriptors. Additionally, the key factors governing dihydrogen activation and cycloaddition with acetylene have been quantitatively analyzed in detail by applying the combination of the Activation Strain Model (ASM) of reactivity and Energy Decomposition Analysis (EDA) methods. The findings reveal a direct correlation between reactivity and diradical character, both of which increase down Group 14.

         <title>What Makes a Branched Aromatic Compound a Crystallization Chaperone? Insights from a Comparison of Three Organic Scaffolds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ability to accommodate guest molecules of many different shapes in crystal lattices has been tested for teraaryl derivatives of porphyrin, spirobifluorene, and adamantane. The latter appears to offer the most favorable properties, which may be at least partially due to low activation barriers for the interconversion of rotamers.








Abstract
Some tetraaryladamantane (TAA) octa&#8208; and tetraethers have the ability to crystallize into well&#8208;ordered lattices without full desolvation. In many cases, the solvates then yield high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray crystal structures of the encapsulated liquids. To shed light on this unusual effect of TAAs as crystallization chaperones, we have synthesized a series of spirobiflourene and porphyrin derivatives with four phenyl arms also found in TAA chaperones. Despite the structural similarity, neither of the non&#8208;TAA compounds showed promising crystallization properties. Six new X&#8208;ray crystal structures were obtained, but neither gave a high&#8208;resolution structure of an encapsulated guest. Quantum chemical computations suggest that conformational changes have low activation barriers for the TAAs, which may help to adapt to the structures of guest molecules in tightly packed arrangements. These findings on supramolecular chemistry in the crystalline state may help to design new chaperones with improved properties.

         <title>Microwave Radiation for Organolithium Chemistry: Mechanistic Studies on the Direct &#945;&#8208;Metalation of a Tertiary Amine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present the use of microwave radiation to lithium chemistry, specifically in the kinetically hindered deprotonation of a tertiary amine at high temperatures without polar additives. The amine acts as substrate and deaggregation agent as shown by a solid&#8208;state structure. The lithium compounds remain stable at the harsh conditions and the deprotonated amine is storage&#8208;stable, facilitating diverse follow&#8208;up chemistry.








Abstract
Deprotonation reactions with lithium alkyls exhibit a high temperature dependency. However, the reactivity of lithium alkyls with conventionally used Lewis bases limits their deprotonation capability of more challenging substrates like tertiary amines. Therefore, we have focused on the use of high but exactly set reaction temperatures by usage of microwave radiation in the deprotonation reaction of a tertiary amine in the absence of polar additives. Our study proves the robustness of lithium alkyls, like t&#8208;butyllithium and &#945;&#8208;metalated tertiary amines under microwave conditions. A solid&#8208;state structure of the prelithiation aggregate and quantum chemical calculations offer an insight into the mechanism, revealing that the substrate amine performs as Lewis base for deaggregation itself. By our method, N&#8208;methylpiperidine was deprotonated without any intermediate or possibly toxic reaction steps, solvents, or additives, solely with t&#8208;butyllithium in the microwave with 56% yield. By using design of experiments we identified the most important factors for a successful deprotonation, revealing the closed reaction conditions under pressure and an excess of amine to be crucial. This investigation proves the high potential of microwave radiation in lithium chemistry, as it provides high but exact energy and introduces new possibilities for deprotonation reactions to overcome high kinetic reaction barriers.

         <title>Naming Matters: Hydridic Hydrogen Atoms are Halogen, Chalcogen, and Pnictogen Bond Acceptors not &#8220;Hydridic Hydrogen Bond&#8221; Donors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydridic hydrogen atoms (e.g., in Me3Ge&#9472;H) form directional noncovalent interactions with electrophilic Br, Se, and As centers. Through electrostatic and orbital analyses, these interactions are identified as halogen, chalcogen, and PnBs, not as &#8220;hydridic hydrogen bonds.&#8221; The study promotes clarity in nomenclature consistent with IUPAC guidelines.








Abstract
The definition and classification of noncovalent interactions are essential for consistent communication in supramolecular chemistry. A recent paper introduced the term &#8220;hydridic hydrogen bond&#8221; to describe interactions where hydrogen atoms bound to electropositive elements (e.g., Si, Ge, Sn) act as electron donors. However, such terminology conflicts with IUPAC definition, which requires hydrogen to be bonded to more electronegative atoms for a hydrogen bond (HB). Herein, we combine electrostatic potential analysis, energy decomposition, ELF/QTAIM, and NBO calculations to show that interactions involving hydridic hydrogen atoms as donors and heavier main group elements (Br, Se, As) as acceptors are better classified as halogen, chalcogen, and pnictogen bonds (PnBs), respectively. Our results confirm the nucleophilic character of hydridic hydrogen atoms and the electrophilic role of the interacting elements via &#963;&#8208; and &#960;&#8208;hole interactions, consistent with established IUPAC definitions. Experimental evidence from NMR supports this classification. By clarifying these interactions&#8217; nature and directionality, we advocate for nomenclature that aligns with chemical intuition and community standards, thereby avoiding confusion caused by unnecessary redefinitions.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of Heterochiral and Homochiral Peptides Conjugated to PNA Dimers and Their Integration in Peptide&#8208;Based Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Homochiral PNA&#8208;peptide conjugates mixed to homochiral peptides yield hydrogels supporting cell growth.








Abstract
Hybrid biomolecules composed of short peptides and nucleic acid analogues can self&#8208;assemble and are good candidates to produce new materials thanks to their biocompatibility and versatility. The assembly occurs by exploiting hydrogen bonds and stacking interactions between nucleobases and amino acids. The organization of the molecules at the supramolecular level is dictated by the structure of the assembling units. In this work we explored the effect of chirality on the self&#8208;assembly of PNA&#8208;peptide conjugates. We focused on homochiral and heterochiral peptides conjugated to PNA dimers and we characterized by spectroscopic techniques the assembled objects. Furthermore, we investigated the ability of the conjugates to form hydrogels in combination with the peptides. The architecture of the assembled molecules in the hydrogels was investigated, as well as the ability of hydrogels to support cell growth. Interestingly, hydrogels formed by homochiral and heterochiral mixtures show pores of different size. In the hydrogels cells grow along a specific direction, dictated by the fiber axis formed by the assembled compounds and their viability seems related to the gel pore size.

         <title>Unraveling Solvent&#8208;Dependent Chirality Inversion in the Self&#8208;Assembly of Glutamide Amphiphiles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 1,8&#8208;naphthalimide glutamide amphiphile (18NG) self&#8208;assembles into oppositely chiral supramolecular structures in MCH and DMSO, accompanied by a circular dichroism (CD) signal amplification due to the conformational transition of 18NG from folded to extended.








Abstract
This study investigates the solvent&#8208;modulated supramolecular chirality and assembly kinetics of two naphthalimide structural isomers, 18NG and 23NG, designed from glutamide derivatives linked to 1,8&#8208; and 2,3&#8208;naphthalic anhydrides, respectively. Time&#8208;dependent circular dichroism (CD) spectra reveal that 18NG exhibits chiroptical signal amplification with aging time and solvent&#8208;dependent chirality inversion: In methylcyclohexane (MCH), it forms chiral assemblies with a positive Cotton effect, whereas in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), it exhibits a negative Cotton effect. FT&#8208;IR and XRD analyses demonstrate stronger amide&#8211;amide hydrogen bonds in MCH and dominant hydrophobic interaction in DMSO, where DMSO acts as both a hydrogen&#8208;bond acceptor (competing with intermolecular hydrogen bonds) and a high&#8208;polarity solvent promoting alkyl&#8208;chain aggregation. In contrast, 23NG assembles rapidly in both solvents without chirality inversion due to pre&#8208;exposed hydrogen&#8208;bonding motifs. These findings show how solvent dictates supramolecular chirality and packing by modulating noncovalent interactions, while structural isomerism governs assembly kinetics and solvent responsiveness. This work provides insights for designing adaptive chiral nanomaterials through molecular structure and solvent control.

         <title>Hierarchical MnO2 Nanoflowers and SnO2 Nanoparticles on Rhombohedral LaMnO3 for 2&#160;V Supercapacitor Electrodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A symmetric 2&#160;V aqueous symmetric supercapacitor using LaMnO3/MnO2 nanoflower hierarchical electrodes prepared using a simple direct chemical synthesis method exhibits superior performance over bare LaMnO3 and MnO2 electrodes. The enhanced performance is attributed to the effective Mn3+/Mn4+ redox transitions, improved interfacial charge transport, and synergistic interactions enabled by the hierarchical architecture.








Abstract
The strategy of forming hierarchical nanostructures of electroactive materials has shown enhancements in supercapacitor performances. In this study, two hierarchical electrodes are prepared by directly growing MnO2 nanoflowers and SnO2 nanoparticles on rhombohedral LaMnO3 nanostructures using a facile method. An extended potential window of 2&#160;V in a neutral aqueous electrolyte with superior electrochemical characteristics compared to pristine LaMnO3 electrodes is exhibited by these electrodes. Moreover, LaMnO3/MnO2 shows the best performance among the two hierarchical nanostructures. The optimized LaMnO3/MnO2 electrode delivers a high capacity of 426 C g&#8722;1 at a current density of 1 A g&#8722;1, nearly 4.6 times compared to pristine LaMnO3. This hierarchical electrode, due to the synergistic effect, exhibits appreciable cycling stability, outperforming the electrodes based on pristine MnO2 and LaMnO3. The aqueous symmetric supercapacitor fabricated using this electrode shows a capacity of 64 C g&#8722;1 (32 F g&#8722;1) at 1 A g&#8722;1, with a high energy density of 17.8 Whkg&#8722;1 at a constant power density of 2000&#160;W kg&#8722;1. Further, the device delivers 89% of its initial capacitance even after 10 000 charge/discharge operations at 10 A g&#8722;1. This study presents the possibility of using these hierarchical nanostructures in high&#8208;performance aqueous electrolyte supercapacitors (SCs).

         <title>Deep&#8208;Learning Driven Identification of Novel Antimicrobial Peptides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using an AI&#8208;driven pipeline that couples HydrAMP sequence generation with AMPlify activity scoring, we evolved a short tryptophan&#8208;rich parent peptide into a mini&#8208;library of analogues, screened them in silico, and validated the top hits experimentally. The lead candidate, AMP3, shows high antimicrobial activity and membrane&#8208;disruptive ability, demonstrating the power of DL and rational peptide engineering to accelerate antimicrobial peptide discovery.








Abstract
In this study, we report the identification of novel antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) via a machine learning&#8208;driven pipeline. Short Trp&#8208;rich peptide sequences were obtained using the HydrAMP deep learning (DL) algorithm, followed by the in silico screening for antimicrobial activity via the AMPlify DL model. Three candidates, namely AMP1, AMP2, and AMP3, were selected for synthesis and experimental validation. The antimicrobial activity was evaluated in vitro against a panel of Gram&#8208;positive and Gram&#8208;negative bacterial strains. Among them, AMP3 demonstrated the broader antibacterial spectrum. To investigate the mechanisms of action, we conducted detailed biophysical analyses of AMP3 interaction with liposomal models of bacterial membranes. The data revealed significant perturbation of membrane bilayer stability, supporting the proposed membrane&#8208;targeting activity of AMP3. Overall, our results underscore the potential of DL approaches for the accelerated discovery and mechanistic characterization of novel AMPs.

         <title>Mechanism of Oxidative C&#9472;H Bond Activation by De Novo Designed Artificial Cu Metalloenzymes Using H2O2 and O2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanism of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde peroxidation by de novo&#8208;designed Artificial Cu Proteins (ArCuPs) is investigated. A PCET step involving H+ transfer from benzylic C&#9472;H bond to CuII&#9472;OH and ET from O&#8208;centered substrate radical to CuII is found to be the RDS. Outer&#8208;sphere steric modifications alter reactivity. The most active variant produces the least amount of detrimental OH and is the most thermostable. 








Abstract
De novo&#8208;designed artificial Cu protein (ArCuP), 3SCC, featuring a trigonal Cu(His)3 binding environment, activates H2O2, O2, and benzylic C&#9472;H bonds of abiotic substrates. We outline the mechanism of ArCuP&#8208;catalyzed C&#9472;H peroxidation of one such abiotic substrate, the peroxidation of benzyl alcohol (BA) to benzaldehyde. The CuI(H2O2) complex undergoes homolytic cleavage, producing CuII&#8208;OH and &#8226;OH, akin to the lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs). The rate&#8208;limiting step is found in a PCET process, where the CuII&#8208;OH species accepts the benzylic C&#9472;H proton, accompanied by electron transfer from the O&#8208;centered substrate radical, to produce benzaldehyde. The C&#9472;H peroxidation is modulated by outer&#8208;sphere modifications, with the I12A&#8208;3SCC variant having the highest catalytic proficiency. Combined &#8226;OH monitoring and proteomics analysis reveal that the I12A variant produces the least amount of &#8226;OH, indicating no oxidation of the active site His residues, unlike other ArCuPs. The chemical and thermal stability of the I12A variant contributes to its superior reactivity. The presence of substrate significantly lowers protein&#8208;level oxidation, similar to LPMOs and other Cu and heme&#8208;based enzymes.

         <title>Mellitic Acid as a Stable Abiotic Precursor for Liquid&#8208;Liquid Phase Separation: An RNA&#8208;Independent Pathway for Prebiotic Compartmentalization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Evidence is presented that prebiotically accessible mellitic (benzenehexacarboxylic) acid (MAc) is forming liquid droplets with short poly&#8208;L&#8208;lysine. The capacity of MAc to induce liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation with short oligocations, along with abiotic synthesis routes, makes MAc a viable candidate for an ingredient of early prebiotic membraneless organelles.








Abstract
Apart from playing the well&#8208;recognized roles in the self&#8208;assembly of intracellular machinery liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS) constitutes a hypothetical, yet compelling scenario for prebiotic compartmentalization. One challenge facing this idea is the absence (or scarcity) of typical biopolymer precursors of liquid droplets, such as RNA, on early Earth. We demonstrate that mellitic acid (MAc), an abiotic component found in certain minerals and a marker of organic matter in astrobiology, forms liquid droplets with poly&#8208;L&#8208;lysine (PLL) across a broad pH range and various mixing ratios. The chain&#8208;length threshold of PLL capable of forming droplets with MAc ((L&#8208;Lys)6) is significantly lower than when ATP, the primary intracellular energy currency, is used to induce LLPS in PLL. MAc&#8208;PLL droplets are highly dynamic systems that respond reversibly to added ATP through an efficient mixing and demixing behavior. The observed effects of pH, ionic strength, temperature, and pressure, as well as isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) data, are all consistent with coulombic interactions being the key contributor to maintaining the droplet state in the MAc&#8208;PLL system. We propose that the capacity to induce LLPS with short oligocations, along with abiotic synthesis routes, positions mellitic acid as a viable candidate for an ingredient of early prebiotic membraneless protocells.

         <title>Crystal Phase Engineering of Carbon Nitride: Advances in Regulation Strategies and Photocatalytic Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Graph abstract: This review systematically explores the crystal phase engineering strategy of carbon nitridebased photocatalysts, contrasting the distinct properties, modification, and application of graphite, crystalline, and amorphous phases. At the end, some future developmental directions and challeges for carbon nitride with different crystal structures were also put forward.








Abstract
Crystal phase engineering emerges as a pivotal strategy to overcome the inherent limitations (e.g., structural defects, rapid charge recombination, and insufficient light absorption), plaguing conventional graphitic carbon nitride (g&#8208;C3N4) synthesized by thermal polymerization for photocatalysis. This review systematically explores this innovative approach, contrasting the distinct properties and photocatalytic advantages of graphite, crystalline (CCN), and amorphous (ACN) carbon nitride phases. CCN leverages an extended &#960;&#8208;conjugated system for superior charge transport and enhanced light absorption, while ACN exploits abundant vacancies to reduce reaction barriers, narrow the bandgap, and improve light harvesting. We critically assess their performance in diverse applications (H2O2 production, H2 evolution, CO2 reduction, pollutant degradation, biomass oxidation), emphasizing the decisive role of the engineered crystal phase in optimizing activity. Despite progress, challenges in efficiency, stability, and complex&#8208;condition applicability persist. Future research must prioritize refining synthesis for precise phase control, enhancing operational stability, and elucidating underlying reaction mechanisms to advance practical environmental and energy applications.

         <title>Correspondence on &#8220;Borate Buffer as a Key Player in Cu&#8208;Based Homogeneous Electrocatalytic Water Oxidation&#8221;</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Is it a boron atom, or is it a carbon atom? Given that BO33&#8722; and CO32&#8722; have very similar geometries, one can easily be mistaken for the other. In this paper we detail the probable mischaracterization of a supposed BO33&#8722;&#8208;containing complex.








Abstract
The trinuclear copper complex originally formulated as {[Cu(bpy)2]3BO3}(ClO4)4.2O, purportedly containing a triply bridging BO33&#8722; ligand, appears to be the known complex {[Cu(bpy)2]3CO3}(ClO4)4.0.5H2O, containing a triply bridging carbonate ligand.

         <title>Oxidant&#8208;Free Amidation of Aldehydes Enabled by Electrophotocatalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrophotocatalytic method for C(sp2)&#8211;N bond formation via radical&#8208;polar crossover (RPC)&#8208;HAT catalysis is presented. The mild operating conditions enable functionalization of a wide range of compounds, with electricity as the sole oxidant.








Abstract
Electrophotocatalysis (EPC) is emerging as a powerful tool in organic synthesis, offering unique redox transformations without the need for sacrificial oxidants or reductants. Building on this activation mode, we have developed an electrophotocatalytic method for the direct amidation of aldehydes, utilizing electricity and protons as oxidants and light to generate chlorine radicals for hydrogen atom transfer (HAT). This sustainable approach is compatible with a wide range of aldehydes and nitrogen&#8208;based nucleophiles, performing efficiently under batch conditions and demonstrating scalability with flow technology. The mild reaction conditions, adequate functional group tolerance, and versatility make this EPC protocol particularly suitable for C&#9472;N bond formation, enabling functionalization of diverse organic compounds and facilitating late&#8208;stage modifications in drug development.

         <title>Automation of Multistep Reaction&#8208;Based Solid&#8208;Phase Synthesis Using Novel Polystyrene&#8208;Coated Magnetic Particles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel magnetic particles were developed to enable automated high&#8208;throughput multistep synthesis on small&#8208;scale. A covalently linked polystyrene shell efficiently protects the encapsulated magnetic iron core to avoid metal release in commonly used solvents, at elevated temperatures and over a broad pH range, thus providing appropriate magnetic properties allowing full automation of multistep reaction sequences.








Abstract
We have developed novel types of polystyrene&#8208;coated magnetic particles for versatile applications in multistep reaction&#8208;based solid&#8208;phase organic synthesis. These particles feature a protective polymer shell that allows them to function under various reaction conditions while maintaining the beneficial properties of traditional polystyrene beads, such as swelling and shrinking in organic solvents. We applied the particles in diverse multistep syntheses, including and combining amide couplings, nucleophilic aromatic substitutions, and Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura couplings at tens of micromole scale. The ferrimagnetic property of the particles enables their reversible immobilization using an external magnetic field, facilitating efficient reagent change cycles through simple aspiration of the separated supernatant liquid. This immobilization principle was applied to particle conditioning, reactions, washing, deprotection, and linker cleavage, allowing for fully automated parallel syntheses in microtiter plates using an automated liquid&#8208;handling system. This platform has already become routine for hit syntheses from various high&#8208;throughput screening campaigns and will enable the efficient production of a wide variety of new compounds by solid&#8208;phase synthesis. Ongoing developments on magnetic particles, reaction conditions, and automated processing will further extend the application range in medicinal chemistry and beyond.

         <title>Alkali Metal Complexes of a Phosphine&#8208;Functionalized Cyclooctatetraene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel phosphine&#8722;functionalized COT ligand and its inverse sandwich alkali metal complexes (Na, K, Rb, and Cs) were synthesized and structurally characterized. The polymeric architectures vary with the metal ion and crystallization solvent, with an eight&#8208;membered ring obtained for Rb in benzene. UV&#8722;Vis and photophysical studies reveal luminescent properties.








Abstract
The distinctive electronic properties and wide range of applications of cyclooctatetraene (COT) sandwich complexes make exploring this class of compounds essential. The new phosphine&#8208;functionalized proligand 1,4&#8722;bis(dimethylsilylmethyl)diphenylphosphinecycloocta&#8722;2,5,7&#8722;triene, {C8H8&#8722;1,4&#8722;(Me2SiCH2PPh2)2}, was synthesized by reaction of K2COT with Me2Si(Cl)CH2PPh2 first. Subsequent deprotonation with various alkali metal bases led to a series of alkali metal complexes [M2{C8H6&#8722;1,4&#8722;(Me2SiCH2PPh2)2}] (M&#160;=&#160;Na, K, Rb, Cs). Notably, the crystallization solvent and the alkali metals significantly influenced the polymeric architecture and led to structural diversity of all complexes. For instance, the two phosphine arms either coordinate both to one metal atom, while the other metal ion is uncoordinated, or, in other structures, each metal atom is equally coordinated by just one phosphine function. Additionally, the coordination behavior of the pendant phosphine groups determines the emissive nature of these complexes. In all cases, polymeric structures are formed, in which intermolecular interactions between the COT ring and a metal atom are observed. Additionally, Rb forms a benzene&#8208;bridged eight&#8208;membered polymeric structure [{Rb2(C8H6&#8722;1,4&#8722;(Me2SiCH2PPh2)2) (C6H6)2}8]&#8734;. Additionally, the lighter alkali metals in [M2{C8H6&#8722;1,4&#8722;(Me2SiCH2PPh2)2}] can be exchanged by the heavier congeners by using the corresponding tert&#8722;butoxides.

         <title>Thorium Bis&#8208;Salophen Trimers as Anion Detectors and Binding Agents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first example of a thorium trimer 3:3 with &#916;,&#916;,&#916;&#8208;chirality and a pore in the center for anion binding.








Abstract
Bis&#8208;salophen ligands are the condensation product of a tetramine and a salicylaldehyde derivative. They feature two binding sites, both of which are tetradentate with mixed O/N donor atoms. Reaction with the ligand precursor and thorium nitrate tetrahydrate forms a 3:3 metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand trimer with a &#916;&#916;&#916;&#8208;chirality confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallography of a racemic single crystal. The structure has a pore in the center of the triangular structure measuring 6.22&#160;&#197; at its narrowest point. This compound is air&#8208; and water&#8208;stable as well as soluble in organic solvents. This compound was screened with a series of tetrabutyl ammonium halide salts, and tetrabutylammonium (TBA) chloride showed the strongest binding to the complex. After the addition of 2 equivalents of TBACl, the complex and salt precipitate out of solution.

         <title>Long Used but Hardly Known: Synthesis and Crystal Structure of Tritium Breeding Li2Be2O3</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ternary oxide Li2Be2O3 was synthesized in a HT approach starting from Li2O and BeO using a radiofrequency furnace. Although, the compound has been known for almost 60 years, its crystal structure has only now been elucidated and a phase&#8208;pure synthesis makes the determination of directly assignable properties possible. Li2Be2O3 is discussed for its usage in fusion reactors, as it breeds essential tritium under neutron irradiation.








Abstract
A main challenge for the operation of a nuclear fusion reactor is the consumption of tritium during the fusion process and the limited availability of tritium in natural resources or its production in nuclear power plants. The most promising approach is breeding of new tritium within the operating fusion reactor. For this purpose, suitable breeding materials are needed. Lithium beryllium oxides are a promising class of compounds, as they unite both target and neutron multiplier in one material. While there have already been studies on sintered ceramics in the Li2O&#183;BeO system, the crystal structure of compounds of a defined composition has so far remained unsolved. Herein, we report on the synthesis of phase&#8208;pure Li2Be2O3 in a high&#8208;temperature (HT) approach and its structure determination by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (sc&#8208;XRD). In addition, the compound was characterized by powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (PXRD), solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, and elemental analysis. The thermal stability, which is important for use as blanket material in a fusion reactor, was examined with differential scanning calorimetry (DSC).

         <title>Deep Learning for Hyperpolarized NMR of Intrinsically Disordered Proteins Without Resolution Loss: Access to Short&#8208;Lived Intermediates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>









Abstract
The inherently low sensitivity of solution&#8208;state Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) has long limited its ability to characterize transient biomolecular states at atomic resolution. While dissolution dynamic nuclear polarization (dDNP) offers a compensating signal enhancement, its broader use has been hindered by rapid polarization decay, causing severe spectral distortion. Here, we introduce HyperW&#8208;Decon, an approach that enables high&#8208;sensitivity, high&#8208;resolution NMR of biomolecules in solution. HyperW&#8208;Decon combines two key aspects: (i) the use of hyperpolarized water (HyperW) to transfer polarization to proteins through rapid proton exchange; and (ii) a theory&#8208;driven, machine learning (ML)&#8211;based deconvolution method that corrects polarization&#8208;induced artifacts without requiring external reference signals. This approach is based on a first&#8208;principles understanding of dDNP line shapes and delivers a scalable solution to spectral distortion. Applied to intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) involved in biomineralization, HyperW&#8208;Decon reveals previously inaccessible, short&#8208;lived ion&#8208;peptide encounter complexes with residue resolution.

         <title>How to Track Mechanochemical Reactions in Resonant Acoustic Mixers by in Situ Raman Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We define a practical operational window for in situ Raman monitoring in resonant acoustic mixing (RAM), a milling media&#8208;free alternative to ball milling. By optimizing key parameters, including vessel design, filling degree, and acceleration, we establish conditions that enable robust spectral acquisition across various mechanochemical transformations. This framework facilitates reliable reaction tracking in RAM.








Abstract
Mechanochemical processes have traditionally been explored using ball mills; however, resonant acoustic mixers (RAM) offer a compelling alternative, operating without milling media and enabling scalable, solvent&#8208;free synthesis. Despite their advantages, direct transfer of reaction conditions from ball mills to RAM has proven nontrivial, requiring careful optimization of key parameters. In this study, we systematically define an operational window for effective in situ Raman monitoring in RAM. Critical parameters&#8212;including vessel material, applied gravitational force, filling degree, substrate rheology, and reaction time&#8212;were assessed to ensure high&#8208;quality spectral acquisition. Utilizing a sapphire&#8208;glass window and a precisely aligned laser setup, we achieved strong, reproducible Raman signals under controlled conditions. The optimal window was found to include a minimum filling degree of 10% and applied g&#8208;forces between 20 and 70&#160;g. This framework was validated across diverse mechanochemical reactions, including organic condensations (Knoevenagel and quinoxaline), metal&#8208;organic framework formation (ZIF), and catalytic coupling (Glaser reaction), demonstrating the robustness and versatility of in situ Raman spectroscopy in RAM&#8208;based synthesis.

This framework was validated across diverse mechanochemical reactions, including organic condensations (Knoevenagel and quinoxaline), metal-organic framework formation (ZIF), and catalytic coupling (Glaser reaction), demonstrating the robustness and versatility of in situ Raman spectroscopy in RAM-based synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Iron&#8208;Sulfur&#8208;Mediated C&#8208;S Bond Formation: Mechanistic Insights from the state&#8208;crossing tRNA Methylthiolation by the Radical SAM Enzyme MiaB</title>

         <dc:description>
Iron&#8208;sulfur cluster chemistry: The mechanism of the MiaB&#8208;catalyzed methylthiolation of N6&#8208;isopentenyladenosine at position 37 in tRNA is elucidated. The reaction sequence clearly demonstrates that the state&#8208;crossing methylthiolation occurs following C2&#8208;H abstraction by 5&#8242;&#8208;dAdo&#8226;. Moreover, the essential role of the auxiliary [3Fe&#8208;4S] cluster is revealed, as it functions as both the methyl carrier and the direct sulfur donor during catalysis.








Abstract
The radical S&#8208;adenosylmethionine (SAM) enzyme MiaB is a bifunctional catalyst that mediates the posttranscriptional methylthiolation of N6&#8208;isopentenyladenosine (i6A37) at position 37 in tRNA. Herein, density functional calculations were employed to elucidate the two stages of MiaB&#8208;catalyzed modification: methylation and sulfur insertion at the C2 position of i6A37. MiaB contains two iron&#8208;sulfur clusters: a radical SAM cluster ([4Fe&#8208;4S]RS) and an auxiliary cluster ([3Fe&#8208;4S]Aux). Our calculations demonstrate that the [4Fe&#8208;4S]RS cluster is essential for generating the potent oxidant 5&#8242;&#8208;deoxyadenosyl radical (5&#8242;&#8208;dAdo&#8226;) via the reductive cleavage of SAM and that the [3Fe&#8208;4S]Aux cluster serves both as the carrier of methyl and as a direct sulfur donor during catalysis. Furthermore, it is revealed that a state crossing occurs during the methylthio installation at the substrate, which follows C2&#8208;H abstraction by 5&#8242;&#8208;dAdo&#8226;. Additionally, substituting Arg66 with glutamine highlights its critical role in stabilizing the substrate radical and modulating MiaB activity. Overall, our work advances the understanding of iron&#8208;sulfur cluster chemistry and inert C&#8208;H bond activation within the growing superfamily of radical SAM enzymes, offering insights for translating the catalytic advantages of natural enzymes into synthetic transition&#8208;metal complexes and functional materials.

         <dc:description>
A series of bifluorenylidene&#8208;based BAEs and their derivatives have been prepared via the palladium&#8208;catalyzed Suzuki coupling/Heck cyclization tandem reaction in one pot from the substrates containing boronic ester groups and 2&#8208;bromophenyl trifluoromethanesulfonate or similar derivatives.








Abstract
A variety of bifluorenylidene&#8208;based bistricyclic aromatic enes (BAEs) and their derivatives have been prepared via the palladium&#8208;catalyzed Suzuki coupling/Heck cyclization tandem reaction in one pot. In the new scheme, 2&#8208;bromophenyl trifluoromethanesulfonate and similar derivatives were chosen as one of the reaction substrates, which could undergo a tandem Suzuki coupling/Heck cyclization reaction with suitable arylboronic acid ester substrates to afford the expected BAEs and their derivatives. In the newly designed scheme, the raw materials are easier to obtain and can be applied to the synthesis of more BAEs and their derivatives.

         <dc:description>
Tunable amine&#8208;functionalized silica catalysts with channel and wormhole like morphology utilized for CO2 fixation reaction into cyclic organic carbonates (COCs) from epoxides at atmospheric pressure.








Abstract
A silica catalyst with characteristic features of broad pore size distribution, large pore width and tunable basic sites was synthesized by a one&#8208;step green co&#8208;condensation synthesis method analogous to SBA&#8208;15 synthesis. The surface chemical features of the above catalyst were explored by XPS, N2 and CO2 adsorption and desorption experiments. The catalyst showed 90% conversion of styrene oxide (SO) with nearly complete selectivity toward styrene carbonate (SC) in 7&#160;hours under a solvent&#8208;free condition at a temperature of 120&#160;&#176;C with the aid of co&#8208;catalyst tetrabutylammonium bromide (TBAB). Moreover, the catalyst demonstrates versatility with various epoxide substrates, providing valuable insights into the cycloaddition reaction under ambient pressure conditions involving carbon dioxide. The mechanistic details of the catalytic conversion were investigated by the in&#8208;situ DRIFT studies and reported here.

         <title>Dynamic Combinatorial Chemistry Generates Adaptative Libraries of Glyco&#8208;Dyn[n]Arenes That can Be Templated to Produce Anti&#8208;Adhesive Glycoconjugates Targeting Pseudomonas aeruginosa</title>

DCC enables the formation of glycocluster libraries through reversible disulfide exchange. Nanomolar ligands for multiple lectins (ConA, LecA, and LecB) were identified in a simple experimental set up, purified, and displayed nanomolar affinity with anti&#8208;infectious properties.








Abstract
Carbohydrate&#8208;protein interactions are important in cell&#8208;cell communication, signal transduction, cancer, or infection. Chemists have designed glycosylated multivalent systems to mimic these recognition phenomena and produce potent ligands of lectins with therapeutic applications. Dynamic combinatorial chemistry (DCC) provides access to libraries of glycosylated macrocycles equilibrating through reversible covalent bonds. This strategy can be applied to the rapid and efficient identification of multivalent glycoclusters by introducing a protein into the equilibrating library. This strategy allowed the identification of the best ligands for more than one lectin in a single experimental set up by using two simple 1,4&#8208;dithiophenol building blocks. Selection of the best binder by each lectin (ConA, LecA, and LecB) was accompanied by the amplification of glyco&#8208;dyn[3]arenes and glyco&#8208;dyn[4]arenes. These macrocycles could be synthesized, isolated, and displayed nanomolar dissociation constants. Furthermore, while no toxicity could be detected against human cells or bacteria, their anti&#8208;adhesive properties against Pseudomonas aeruginosa were confirmed through a virulence assay on human cells. Altogether, extremely simple 1,4&#8208;dithiophenol building blocks provided access to a large diversity of glycoconjugates that could be selected by a lectin in a simple experimental set up to identify glycoconjugates with potential anti&#8208;infectious applications, thus speeding up the discovery of potential new antibacterial treatments.

         <dc:description>
The ion pairs, consisting of the polarized porphyrin AuIII complex as a dipolar &#960;&#8208;electronic cation, formed crystal&#8208;state ion&#8208;pairing assemblies based on antiparallel stacking structures stabilized by dispersion forces along with reduced electrostatic repulsion originating from the dipole&#8211;dipole interactions.








Abstract
A porphyrin AuIII complex comprising 5,10&#8208;penatafluorophenyl units was synthesized as a dipolar &#960;&#8208;electronic cation. The &#960;&#8208;electronic cation was combined with anions, including a bulky borate anion and planar &#960;&#8208;electronic anions. The dipolar &#960;&#8208;electronic cation formed crystal&#8208;state ion&#8208;pairing assemblies based on antiparallel stacking structures, which were stabilized by interionic dipole&#8211;dipole interactions.

The dipolar &#960;-electronic cation formed crystal-state ion-pairing assemblies based on antiparallel stacking structures, which were stabilized by interionic dipole&#8211;dipole interactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synergistic Gold&#8208;Silicon Catalysis: Unravelling Alkynyl Gold Reactivity and Application to the High&#8208;Performance C&#8208;Alkynylation of Glycals</title>

         <dc:description>
This research highlights an efficient and highly &#945;&#8208;stereoselective Au&#8208;Si&#8208;catalyzed alkyne transfer reaction from 1&#8208;trimethylsilylalkynes to glycals, utilizing the bench&#8208;stable (F5Ph)3PAuNTf2 complex at low catalyst loadings (0.2&#8211;1 mol%). DFT mechanistic investigations revealed the nucleophilic character of the in situ formed electron&#8208;deficient alkynylgold species and allowed elucidating the full mechanism, including two distinct pathways for its addition to an oxacarbenium electrophile.








Abstract
Within the synergistic gold&#8208;silicon catalysis concept, we have reported here the efficient and highly &#945;&#8208;stereoselective Au&#8208;Si&#8208;catalyzed alkyne transfer from 1&#8208;trimethylsilylalkynes to glycals, at room temperature and at low loading (0.2&#8211;1 mol%). The synthesized and bench&#8208;stable (F5Ph)3PAuNTf2 complex was found instrumental to achieve such C&#8208;alkynylation reaction, through the in situ generation of both trimethylsilyl triflimide and alkynylgold complex from 1&#8208;trimethylsilylalkynes. This coupling has been deployed routinely on a wide combination of glycal donors and as efficiently with either aryl or alkyl 1&#8208;trimethylsilylalkyne aglycons, functionalized or not. This method could also be applied to the synthesis of a pseudo&#8208;C&#8208;disaccharide.
DFT mechanistic investigations confirmed for the first time that alkynylgold species i) exhibit suitable nucleophilic character, even when they carry highly electrophilic ligands, and ii) that they react as &#8220;classical&#8221; organometallics and not through their possible carbenic form in reaction with oxacarbenium electrophiles.

         <title>Tuning Electrocatalytic Energy Release in Norbornadiene&#160;Based Molecular Solar Thermal Systems Through Substituent Effects</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We investigated how push&#8211;pull substituents influence the electrochemically driven energy release in norbornadiene&#8208;based MOST systems. Electron&#8208;donating groups proved to be decisive, with p&#8208;methoxyphenyl derivatives achieving up to 99% selectivity. These insights offer valuable design guidelines for future MOST systems.








Abstract
Molecular solar thermal (MOST) systems, such as the norbornadiene/quadricyclane (NBD/QC) pair, combine solar energy conversion, storage, and release in a simple one&#8208;molecule process. The energy&#8208;releasing reaction QC to NBD can be controlled electrochemically. In this study, we used in&#8208;situ photoelectrochemical infrared spectroscopy (PEC&#8208;IRRAS) together with density functional theory (DFT) calculations to investigate how electron donating (EDG) and electron withdrawing (EWG) groups in the push&#8208;pull system of the MOST pair affect the electrocatalytic properties of the electrochemically triggered back&#8208;conversion. Specifically, we investigated cyano, tosyl, and methyl ester groups as EWGs, and methoxy, dimethylamine, thioether, and diphenylamine groups located in the para&#8208;position of a phenyl group as EDGs. We characterized the onset potential, electrochemical stability window, and selectivity. We found that these properties strongly depend on the strength of electron donation of the EDG, as it exclusively locates the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and raises its energy level. We obtained the highest selectivity for compounds with p&#8208;methoxyphenyl functionality.

         <title>Asymmetric Total Synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;Glycybridin B, a Pharmacophore Screened Candidate for Tubulin Binding</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Discovery and first total synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;glycybridin B via a five&#8208;step route utilizing a key chalcone intermediate. Initially identified through a pharmacophore screening as a potential tubulin binder, this natural product serves as a tool compound to explore structure&#8208;activity relationships related to microtubule targeting and anticancer potential.








Abstract
Microtubule&#8208;targeting agents (MTAs) represent a pivotal class of therapeutic compounds designed to disrupt microtubule dynamics, leading to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in malignant cells. Nevertheless, their off&#8208;target effects on healthy, rapidly dividing cells result in significant neurotoxicity and myelosuppression. Ongoing research aims to enhance their specificity and identify novel active scaffolds to minimize adverse effects and fight drug resistance. Searching for new potential tubulin binders with a pharmacophore screening method, we identified glycybridin B as a promising natural product. Here, we report the first total synthesis of this compound via a five&#8208;step route, involving a key chalcone intermediate, along with its biological evaluation.

         <title>The Application of PEG&#8208;functionalized Amphiphilic Pillararene in Drug Delivery Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review comprehensively summarizes the application of PEG&#8208;functionalized amphiphilic pillararenes in drug delivery systems for chemotherapy, phototherapy, and gas therapy of tumor. Some corresponding examples were discussed in detail to evaluate their performance in chemotherapy, phototherapy, and gas therapy of tumor. At the end, some future developmental directions for PEG&#8208;functionalized amphiphilic pillararenes were also put forward.








Abstract
As a new generation of supramolecular host macrocyclic molecules, pillararenes display many advantages including simple synthesis routes, rigid electron&#8208;rich structures, unique host&#8208;guest interactions, and adjustable cavity sizes, which make them widely be used in drug delivery systems for precise diagnosis and treatment of cancer. The molecular functions of pillararenes can be easily expanded through the introduction of different functional groups into the side chain. For example, polyethylene glycol (PEG) which has good biocompatibility and water solubility can be used to construct PEG&#8208;functionalized amphiphilic pillararenes. These PEG&#8208;functionalized amphiphilic pillararenes can be used to construct the nanocarriers with good water solubility and excellent biocompatibility through their self&#8208;assembly to deliver hydrophobic drugs. Although there are many reviews introducing the application of amphiphilic pillararenes in drug delivery, there are still no comprehensive articles summarizing such type of pillararenes. In this paper, based on their functional characteristics, the applications of PEG&#8208;functionalized amphiphilic pillararene in drug delivery systems have been summarized. We focused on the relationship between their molecular design and functional application, providing reasonable guidance for the structural design of amphiphilic pillararenes.

         <title>Citrate&#8208;Assisted Solvothermal Synthesis of SnO2 Porous Microflowers as Efficient Cathode for Advanced Hybrid Supercapacitor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
SnO2 porous microflowers were prepared by a citrate&#8208;mediated solvothermal route along with a post&#8208;annealing treatment in air. Such SnO2 flowers exhibited a battery&#8208;type electrochemical response with a great specific capacity of 177.2 C g&#8722;1 at 1 A g&#8722;1 in 2&#160;M of KOH electrolyte. The assembled SnO2 microflowers//AC hybrid supercapacitor delivered a high specific energy of 29.5&#160;W h kg&#8722;1 at 883.9&#160;W kg&#8722;1.








Abstract
Herein, mesoporous tin dioxide materials with distinct structures (SnO2 microflowers and SnO2 microsheets) were, respectively, prepared via a citrate&#8208;mediated solvothermal route along with a post&#8208;annealing treatment in air. Electrochemical tests revealed a typical battery&#8208;type charge storage behavior of SnO2 materials. Attributing to the 3D hierarchical flower&#8208;like structure and its good conductivity, the SnO2 microflowers possessed a specific capacity of 177.2 C g&#8722;1, slightly greater than 159.0 C g&#8722;1 achieved by SnO2 microsheets under 1 A g&#8722;1. When assembled into hybrid supercapacitors (HSCs) utilizing activated carbon (AC) as an anode, the SnO2 microflowers//AC HSC device delivered a high energy density (ED) of 29.5&#160;W h kg&#8722;1 at 883.9&#160;W kg&#8722;1, surpassing SnO2 microsheets//AC HSC (26.9&#160;W h kg&#8722;1 at 881.7&#160;W kg&#8722;1). Furthermore, both SnO2//AC HSCs exhibited long&#8208;term stability, showing 113.2% (SnO2 microflowers//AC) and 106.4% (SnO2 microsheets//AC) capacity retention over 5000 cycles. Notably, this synthesis strategy achieves facile morphological control and improved electrochemical properties of SnO2 materials by adjusting the sodium citrate amount. These results indicate that SnO2 microflowers and SnO2 microsheets are attractive candidates for high&#8208;performance HSC assembly. Furthermore, this cost&#8208;effective approach can provide a reference for synthesizing other advanced metal oxide&#8208;based electrode materials.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herein, mesoporous tin dioxide materials with distinct structures (SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; microflowers and SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; microsheets) were, respectively, prepared via a citrate-mediated solvothermal route along with a post-annealing treatment in air. Electrochemical tests revealed a typical battery-type charge storage behavior of SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; materials. Attributing to the 3D hierarchical flower-like structure and its good conductivity, the SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; microflowers possessed a specific capacity of 177.2 C g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, slightly greater than 159.0 C g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; achieved by SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; microsheets under 1 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;stretchable Transparent Hydrogels with Low Hydrophobic and Amphiphilic Monomers Using Asymmetric Crosslinker to Give Low Mechanical Hysteresis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Copolymerizing a low&#8208;hydrophobic monomer and an amphiphilic monomer with an asymmetric crosslinker has led to a transparent, highly stretchable hydrogel. Optimizing the monomer concentration and ratio has led to up to a 19.3 swelling ratio and 1300% stretchability, or over 3000% with slightly reduced transparency, with all hydrogels displaying low hysteresis and rapid contraction.








Abstract
Exploring a reasonable network design to develop highly stretchable hydrogels with over 1,000% extension is still a big challenge in the field of hydrogel chemistry and materials. Micellar copolymerization with hydrophobic monomers and surfactants/proteins is a well&#8208;studied approach to provide stretchable hydrogels with hydrophobic association domains as sacrificial bonds when subjected to large deformation, but some limitations, such as dose increase of such monomers and surfactant&#8208;free synthesis have not yet been well considered. In this study, we demonstrate a simple but powerful approach to produce transparent, ultra&#8208;stretchable hydrogels expressing more than 3,000% elongation by surfactant&#8208;free copolymerization of low hydrophobic monomer and amphiphilic monomer. We believe that this result offers wider availability of low hydrophobic groups in various water&#8208;containing polymer materials, including gels, micelles, etc.

         <title>A Potassium Base&#8208;Promoted Intramolecular Enolate&#8211;Olefin Metathesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel olefin metathesis, the enolate&#8208;olefin metathesis reaction, in which two double bonds recombine via a four&#8208;membered carbocyclic intermediate (NOT metallacyclobutane intermediate), is developed. The methodology is a transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free, base&#8208;promoted enolate&#8211;olefin metathesis involving [2&#160;+&#160;2] / retro&#8208;[2&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition sequences of 2&#8208;acyl&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;alkenylbiaryl substrates. This reaction enables the synthesis of a wide range of hydroxy&#8208;substituted polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.








Abstract
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are important structures known for their unique properties. Herein, we present a transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free method for synthesizing hydroxy&#8208;substituted PAHs using base&#8208;promoted intramolecular enolate&#8208;olefin&#8208;metathesis chemistry. 2&#8208;Acyl&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;alkenylbiaryl substrates were subjected to [2&#160;+&#160;2]&#8208;/retro&#8208;[2&#160;+&#160;2]&#8208;cycloaddition sequences to afford functionalized PAH derivatives, including enantiomerically enriched [7]helicenes. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations predicted that ionic and radical intermediates are involved in a stepwise process. Various biaryl substrates, including heteroatom&#8208;containing compounds, were successfully converted into the desired PAHs. The developed method also enabled the synthesis of &#960;&#8208;extended arenols, thereby offering a sustainable and efficient alternative to transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed processes.

         <title>Metal&#8211;Ligand Cooperation of Ir(III) Catalysts Bearing a &#946;&#8208;Protic Pyrazole Chelate in Carboxylative Cyclization of Propargylic Amine with CO2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Proton&#8208;responsive C&#8211;N chelating Cp*Ir complexes derived from 3,5&#8208;diphenylpyrazole catalyze the carboxylative cyclization of propargylic amines with CO2. The cyclic urethane product is smoothly released via protonolysis of the alkenyl&#8208;Ir species with the aid of the &#946;&#8208;protic NH unit on pyrazole. Related nonprotic pyrazole analogs and &#945;&#8208; or &#947;&#8208;protic complexes are not catalytically active, but they provide access to catalytic intermediate models.








Abstract
Bifunctional iridium complexes having a &#946;&#8208;protic C&#8211;N chelating pyrazole ligand catalyze the carboxylative cyclization of 1&#8208;methylamino&#8208;2&#8208;butyne under atmospheric CO2. This reaction affords a five&#8208;membered cyclic urethane, along with a six&#8208;membered regioisomer. Alkenyliridium(III) complexes as catalytic intermediate models are formed by stoichiometric reaction of related nonprotic pyrazole complexes with 1&#8208;methylamino&#8208;2&#8208;butyne and CO2 in the presence of Ag2O, although the protic pyrazole analog is too unstable to be detected. In particular, the isolable N&#8208;phenylpyrazole&#8208;ligated alkenyliridium(III) complex with a cyclic urethane framework is characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography. The &#946;&#8208;protic pyrazole ligand would be capable of accelerating protonolysis of the alkenyl carbon&#8211;iridium bond in the key intermediate, releasing the cyclic urethane product, and being responsible for the catalytic function.

         <title>Solid&#8208;State Luminescent Responsive Bilayer Architecture Based on 2D Lanthanide MOFs for Ratiometric NO2 and SO2 Monitoring</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here we report two novel Lanthanide Coordination Polymers, [Tb2(AATA)3(DMF)4] (1) and [Eu2(AATA)3(DMF)4] (2), with enhanced luminescence. These MOFs were then embedded in PDMS to create a bilayer configuration. We implemented a novel ratiometric approach to achieve highly accurate SO2 detection. 2 serves as an internal reference while 1 act as the SO2&#8208;sensitive component offering high sensitivity, specificity, and a pioneer application of a bilayer system.








Abstract
The development of responsive materials for monitoring atmospheric toxic emissions is a growing area of interest. Luminescent metal&#8208;organic framework (LMOF), particularly those based on lanthanides (LnMOFs), have emerged as promising candidates due to their sharp emission bands, long luminescence lifetimes, and structural versatility. Despite their potential, the integration of LnMOFs into robust solid&#8208;state sensing platforms remains limited. In this study, we report the synthesis of three isostructural LnMOFs &#8208;[Tb2(AATA)3(DMF)4], [Eu2(AATA)3(DMF)4], [Gd2(AATA)3(DMF)4]&#8208; based on the antenna&#8208;type ligand 2,5&#8208;bis(acetylamido)terephthalic acid, which promotes strong lanthanide emission and stable 2D frameworks. The MOFs were successfully embedded into polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) to produce composite films retaining their luminescent properties in the solid state. We further present a conceptual bilayer configuration with one film acting as a stable internal reference, and the other serving as the analyte&#8208;responsive layer. This bilayer design enables ratiometric luminescence detection, thereby enhancing the accuracy and reliability of the measurements. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, we demonstrate that the bilayer films exhibit measurable luminescence changes in presence of two major atmospheric pollutants, NO2 and SO2. This result sets a foundational approach for developing more accurate and self&#8208;referencing luminescent materials.

We implemented a novel ratiometric approach to achieve highly accurate SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; detection. &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; serves as an internal reference while &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; act as the SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-sensitive component offering high sensitivity, specificity, and a pioneer application of a bilayer system.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of responsive materials for monitoring atmospheric toxic emissions is a growing area of interest. Luminescent metal-organic framework (LMOF), particularly those based on lanthanides (LnMOFs), have emerged as promising candidates due to their sharp emission bands, long luminescence lifetimes, and structural versatility. Despite their potential, the integration of LnMOFs into robust solid-state sensing platforms remains limited. In this study, we report the synthesis of three isostructural LnMOFs -[Tb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(AATA)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(DMF)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;], [Eu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(AATA)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(DMF)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;], [Gd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(AATA)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(DMF)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]- based on the antenna-type ligand 2,5-bis(acetylamido)terephthalic acid, which promotes strong lanthanide emission and stable 2D frameworks. The MOFs were successfully embedded into polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) to produce composite films retaining their luminescent properties in the solid state. We further present a conceptual bilayer configuration with one film acting as a stable internal reference, and the other serving as the analyte-responsive layer. This bilayer design enables ratiometric luminescence detection, thereby enhancing the accuracy and reliability of the measurements. As a proof-of-concept, we demonstrate that the bilayer films exhibit measurable luminescence changes in presence of two major atmospheric pollutants, NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. This result sets a foundational approach for developing more accurate and self-referencing luminescent materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Metallophthalocyanine&#8208;based Conductive Frameworks as Working Electrode for Dehydrogenase&#8208;Like Electrochemical Oxidation of Thioethers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of polymetallophthalocyanines as working electrode achieves dehydrogenase&#8208;like electrochemical oxidation of thioethers with excellent Faradaic efficiency over 96.3% and nearly 100% product distribution to sulfoxides, along with a high conversion rate of 0.238 mmol&#160;h&#8722;1, outperforming carbon paper electrodes.








Abstract
The selection of electrode materials is critical to the reactivity and selectivity for organic electrosynthesis. In this work, we for the first time use polymetallophthalocyanines (pMPcs) as working electrode for the efficient and highly selective oxidation of sulfide. pMPcs was found to be able to mediate sulfide oxidation with dehydrogenase&#8208;like activity, in which water acts as an oxygen source, for a broad substrate scope, including pharmaceuticals. Among the pMPcs electrodes, pFePc exhibits the highest catalytic selectivity with a faradaic efficiency (FE) of 96.3% and nearly 100% product distribution for the oxidation of sulfides to sulfoxides, as well as the highest conversion rate of 0.238&#160;mmol h&#8722;1. Studies combining spectroscopic experiments and computational approaches reveal that the mechanism of oxidation of sulfide involves the proton&#8208;coupled oxidation of Fe&#9472;OH2 to generate Fe&#9552;O intermediates on the metal atom of the metal&#8208;N4 units of pMPcs. This work highlights the potential for the application of conductive framework materials in organic&#8208;electrical synthesis.

         <title>Nitroreductase&#8208;Responsive Bioorthogonal Tetrazine Conjugations in Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here nitroreductase&#8208;responsive bioorthogonal tetrazine ligations have been demonstrated, enabled by nitrobenzyl caged dihydrotetrazines. By tagging a nitroreductase&#8208;activatable tetrazine precursor with an integrin&#8208;specific peptide c(RGDyK), a dual tumor&#8208;selective on demand bioorthogonal prodrug activation has been achieved in the presence of hypoxic cancer cells.








Abstract
Prodrugs in response to tumor&#8208;overexpressed enzymes offer a targeted approach for cancer therapy. However, this strategy faces several challenges, including poor water solubility, off&#8208;target effects, and tumor heterogeneity. To address these limitations, this study developed a novel class of nitroreductase&#8208;responsive tetrazine precursors by employing nitrobenzyl as a masking group for dihydrotetrazines (NBdTz), which can be further functionalized with targeting peptides. Furthermore, we have demonstrated a dual tumor&#8208;selective on demand bioorthogonal prodrug activation enabled by RGD&#8208;NBdTz. RGD promotes tumor cellular uptake by interacting with tumor&#8208;associated integrin &#945;v&#946;3, and subsequent enzymatic reduction of aromatic nitro group of NBdTz by overexpressed Nitroreductase (NTR) among hypoxic tumor microenvironment (TME) leads to the liberation of the bioorthogonal handle tetrazine, resulting in the anticipated bioorthogonal activation of trans&#8208;cyclooctene caged payloads through &#8220;click&#8208;to&#8208;release&#8221; reactions. We envision the presented NBdTz enabled tumor&#8208;selective on demand tetrazine ligation offers new opportunities for cancer therapy.

         <title>Water&#8208;Soluble Peptoids with Two Different Binding Sites for Strong ATP Chelation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
ATP is key for activating enzymes associated with cancer. A potential therapeutic approach is strong binding of ATP, making it unavailable to enzymes. The water&#8208;soluble peptoid P1&#8208;TB incorporates two synergistic binding sites for ATP: terpyridine&#8208;Zn&#178;&#8314; and 4&#8208;CPBA that bind ATP's phosphate and diol groups, respectively, and exhibits an exceptional K&#7429;&#8208;ATP of 7.416&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;9&#160;M, representing a potential ATP chelator.








Abstract
Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) is the activator of many enzymes, including kinases, that play a significant role in various medical conditions such as cancer. Therefore, inhibiting ATP&#8208;dependent enzymes requires to disable its binding to enzymes, and this can be done by developing potent ATP chelators. Currently, there are two main types of chelators: one that binds ATP via zinc complexes of nitrogen&#8208;based ligands, such as 2,2&#8242;;6&#8242;,2&#8243;&#8208;terpyridine (Terpy), which target&#160;the phosphate ligands, and another one containing phenylboronic acid (PBA) to bind the diols within the ribose. Herein, we report on a unique chelation approach that combines these two binding strategies in one scaffold; we use peptidomimetic oligomers called peptoids that incorporate both Zn(Terpy) and PBA as strong, water&#8208;soluble ATP binding inhibitors. These peptoids demonstrated high affinity to ATP, where the highest is KD&#8208;ATP&#160;=&#160;7.416&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;9&#160;M, four times higher than the binding affinity of peptoids targeting only phosphates or only diols, and at least two orders of magnitude higher than known ATP chelators. Structural studies indicated that positioning both Terpy and PBA side chains close together on the scaffold increased ATP binding affinity, compared to spacing them apart.

         <title>Crown Ether Supported Alkali Metal Phosphides: Synthesis, Structures and Bonding</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Crowned! Herein we describe a complete series of crown ether coordinated alkali metal phosphides from lithium to cesium, including solid state structures, detailed investigations in solution and extensive quantum chemical investigation of the bonding situation.








Abstract
Herein we present the synthesis and full characterization of the previously unpresented lithium diphenyl phosphides Li(15&#8208;crown&#8208;5)PPh2 (1Li) and Li(12&#8208;crown&#8208;4)PPh2 (2Li) as well as the heavy homologues Rb(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)PPh2 (1Rb) and Cs(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)PPh2 (1Cs). We thus complete the series of crown ether coordinated alkali metal diphenyl phosphides and reveal that the structural diversity increases upon descending the group. Including the previously reported Na and K derivatives, we performed a detailed study of the title compounds in solution that strongly indicated all of them are monomers with an alkali metal phosphide AM&#8211;P interaction. We further investigated the influence of the phosphorus&#8208;bound substituents on the bond between the Cs(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6) and the phosphide fragment. For this purpose, we synthesized and characterized two new cesium phosphides, alkyl&#8208;aryl Cs(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)PtBuPh (4Cs) and bis&#8208;alkyl Cs(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)PtBu2 (5Cs). We observed here that the heavy alkali metals Rb and Cs favor coordination via &#960;&#8208;arene interactions&#160;over the P donor dative interactions. Finally, we used state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art quantum chemical methods to analyze the bonding situation in the title series of compounds.

         <title>Fine Tuning of the Redox&#8208;Active Diguanidine Ligand in Cationic Cobalt Complexes for Electronic Structure Control</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxidation in Co complexes with redox&#8208;active diguanidine ligands is either ligand&#8208; or metal&#8208;centered, leading to paramagnetic high&#8208;spin CoII complexes with radical monocationic diguanidine ligands or low&#8208;spin CoIII redox isomers with neutral diguanidine ligands. Careful ligand design leads to the energetic harmonization of the two redox isomers and realization of one&#8208;electron oxidation processes that are both metal&#8208; and ligand&#8208;centered.








Abstract
In this work we show that the redox chemistry of hexacoordinated cobalt complexes with redox&#8208;active diguanidine ligands could be tuned by modifying the diguanidine and/or the co&#8208;ligands. In this way, one&#8208;electron oxidation could be directed to be either ligand&#8208; or metal&#8208;centered, leading to high&#8208;spin CoII complexes with an oxidized, radical&#8208;monocationic diguanidine ligand (ligand&#8208;centered oxidation) or low&#8208;spin CoIII complexes with a reduced, neutral diguanidine ligand. Further fine&#8208;tuning of the redox&#8208;active diguanidine ligand leads to a harmonization of the energies of both redox isomers. Consequently, ligand&#8208; as well as metal&#8208;centered one&#8208;electron oxidation is observed, resulting in a mixture of both redox isomers. Quantum&#8208;chemical calculations confirm the energetic proximity of the two redox isomers in this bistable system. The results of this work contribute to the development of a directed approach toward the design of bistable cobalt&#8208;guanidine complexes and their possible applications in spin&#8208;switching devices.

         <title>Spacer Group Modified Naphthalimide with Acidichromism and Mechanochromism for Anti&#8208;Counterfeiting Application</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
P1 powder shows no fluorescence because of PET between tertiary amines and naphthalimide. P1&#8208;HCl powder exhibits bright blue emission because HCl can bind onto the lone&#8208;pair electrons of trimethylamine to prevent PET. The highly twisted conformation of P1&#8208;HCl has enough steric effect, contributing to obvious red&#8208;shifted mechanochromism.








Abstract
Stimuli&#8208;responsive fluorescence materials are crucial in developing intelligent materials and have wide applications in anti&#8208;counterfeiting and information encryption. However, organic fluorescence dyes with strong &#960;&#8208;&#960; intermolecular interactions and dense molecular packing lead to inertia ability of stimuli&#8208;responsive. Here, we design and synthesize spacer group modified naphthalimide compounds (P1 and P2) with acidichromism and mechanochromism properties. Photoinduced electron transfer (PET) between naphthalimide and trimethylamine moieties quenches fluorescence of P1 and P2. Then, fluorescence is obtained when P1 and P2 interact with hydrochloric acid (named P1&#8208;HCl and P2&#8208;HCl). More importantly, the spacer group modified P1&#8208;HCl with a highly twisted conformation, preventing strong intermolecular &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions and a compact packing structure, contributing to obvious mechanochromism, while P2&#8208;HCl does not. Our study provides a molecular strategy to investigate the relationship between molecular chemical structure and stimuli&#8208;responsive fluorescence properties and realizes anti&#8208;counterfeiting applications.

         <title>Indole&#8208;2&#8208;Carboxylic Acid Ligand&#8208;Mediated Synthesis of Stable Perovskite Nanocrystals for Fast Responsive Photodetector</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stable CsPbBr3/Cs4PbBr6 mixed NCs synthesized by using ICA ligand effectively enhances the Photoluminescence (PL) and PLQY. These mixed nanocrystals show high responsivity in prototype photodetector device.








Abstract
Cesium lead bromide perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) show great potential for photoelectric properties. However, due to their poor stability and the insulating nature of passivating ligands, they suffer from practical applications. Herein, in an approach to passivate the NCs surface by introducing a ligand, Indole&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylic acid (ICA), we synthesized a mixed CsPbBr3/Cs4PbBr6 NCs by a ligand&#8208;assisted reprecipitation approach. Incorporating the ICA ligand in place of long&#8208;chain insulating Oleic acid (OA) effectively reduced the loss of nonradiative recombination induced by surface trap states. Through all the performed compositional and structural characterization, the existence of CsPbBr3/Cs4PbBr6 mixed NCs was confirmed. The obtained CsPbBr3/Cs4PbBr6 mixed NCs show green emission at 518&#160;nm and superior stability under ambient conditions compared to CsPbBr3 NCs. The photoluminescence (PL) of the CsPbBr3/Cs4PbBr6 mixed NCs increased approximately three times, and the PL quantum yield (PLQY) increased from 75&#160;&#177;&#160;2% to 94&#160;&#177;&#160;2% as compared to CsPbBr3 NCs. To demonstrate the potential application of the material in optoelectronics, a photodetector based on mixed CsPbBr3/Cs4PbBr6 NCs is fabricated, which exhibits the maximum responsivity of 1.133&#160;mA/W at 9&#160;mW/cm2 incident power density and faster rise and fall times of 0.31&#160;ms and 1.19&#160;ms, respectively. The specific detectivity of the device is 1.608&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8313; Jones with an incident power of 9&#160;mW/cm2.

         <title>Synthesis of Hyperbranched Polyurethane Acrylate as Self&#8208;cleaning Protective Film on Solar Panel</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hyperbranched polyurethane acrylate (PHBA) was synthesized and blended with epoxy acrylate (EB600) to fabricate protective coatings for solar panels. The multifunctional coating exhibits satisfactory comprehensive properties, significantly prolonging the service life of solar panels. The research provides a feasible strategy for manufacturing high&#8208;performance protective coatings.








Abstract
Renewable and green energy technologies, particularly the improvement of solar panel efficiency, have gained considerable attention in academic and industrial communities. However, long&#8208;term exposure to soiling can lead to substantial reduction in the energy generation capacity of photovoltaic systems. Here, hyperbranched polyurethane acrylate (PHBA) was synthesized using hydroxyl&#8208;terminated hyperbranched polyester as a core component. PHBA was subsequently blended with epoxy acrylate (EB600) and rapidly UV&#8208;cured to fabricate protective coatings for solar panels. The polymeric coating exhibited outstanding mechanical properties, including tensile strength of about 65.43 MPa, the elongation at break of about 3.73%, adhesion of 1 level, and pencil hardness of 6H. The hyperbranched topological structure can remarkably improve the mechanical properties and extend the service life of solar panels. Moreover, the uniform dispersion of siloxane coupling agent in the polymer matrix improved hydrophobic properties, which effectively reduced dust deposition and maintained voltage stability. The high&#8208;performance polymeric coating has shown great application potential in solar panel protective films.

Density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate that the strongly electronegative fluorine improves the surface electronic structure of NiCoPS, further enhancing the adsorption energy of reaction intermediates and electronic conductivity. This work provides an efficient strategy to design effective and durable oxygen evolution reaction(OER) electrocatalysts in alkaline seawater.








Abstract
Developing economical and robust electrocatalysts to prevent chlorine&#160;ions corrosion and improve seawater splitting efficiency is essential for seawater electrolysis. Herein, fluorine&#8208;doped nickel cobalt phospho&#8208;sulfide nanowires (F&#8208;NiCoPS NWs) were synthesized as high&#8208;performance catalysts for overall seawater splitting. The strongly electronegative F anion is favorable to build weak metal fluorine bonds, which easily break to generate highly active species of Ni/Co&#8208;hydroxides/oxyhydroxides protective layer on the electrode surface. This process effectively avoids chlorine evolution reaction (ClER)&#8208;induced dissolution, and enhances the stability of catalysts. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the electronegative fluorine affects the electronic structure of the catalyst&#8217; surface, further enhancing the adsorption energy and electronic conductivity of the reaction intermediates. F&#8208;NiCoPS with appropriate F doping significantly decreased the overpotential (228 (303) mV at 10 (100)&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2) and the Tafel slope (44&#160;mV&#160;dec&#8722;1) in alkaline seawater, and exhibited a long stability of 100&#160;hours. This work provides new insights for constructing effective, cost&#8208;efficient, and nonnoble metal electrocatalyst for alkaline seawater splitting.

         <title>1,3&#8208; and 1,2&#8208;Zwitterionic Complexes of Donor&#8208;Acceptor Cyclopropanes in Reactions with Arylallenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New examples of (3&#160;+&#160;2)&#8208;cycloaddition and annulation reactions of Donor&#8208;acceptor cyclopropanes (DACs) with 1&#8208;aryl&#8208;1&#8208;methylallenes in the presence of GaCl3 were demonstrated. The starting DACs act in these processes as the source of 1,3&#8208; or 1,2&#8208;zwitterionic intermediates. Substituted 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;1&#8208;(inden&#8208;2&#8208;yl)ethylmalonates, tetrahydrobenzo[c]fluorenylmalonates, and exo&#8208;methylenecyclopentane&#8208;1,1&#8208;dicarboxylates were obtained with high diastereoselectivity and good yields.








Abstract
The reaction of 2&#8208;arylcyclopropane&#8208;1,1&#8208;dicarboxylates (ACDC) with GaCl3 and other Lewis acids in the presence of 3&#8208;arylbuta&#8208;1,2&#8208;dienes, which acts as a trapping agent for the 1,2&#8208; or 1,3&#8208;zwitterionic intermediates being generated, has been studied. The reaction of 1,2&#8208;zwitterionic gallium complexes at low temperature has been found to give products of annulation at the phenyl substituent in the allene, 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;1&#8208;(inden&#8208;2&#8208;yl)ethylmalonates, as the main products. Only in the case of naphthylcyclopropanedicarboxylate, the formation of a polycyclic frame by annulation at both aromatic moieties occurred upon an increase in temperature to 0 &#176;C. Trapping of 1,3&#8208;zwitterions, the primary intermediates of cyclopropane ring opening, by the indicated allene was most successful if catalytic amounts of GaCl3 were added directly to the reaction mixture. In this case, the reaction followed the pathway of the usual formal (3&#160;+&#160;2)&#8208;cycloaddition of 1,3&#8208;zwitterions at each of the double bonds of the allene to give the corresponding exo&#8208;methylenecyclopentane&#8208;1,1&#8208;dicarboxylates in up to 93% yields. This process occurred with the highest efficiency at the unsubstituted double bond of 3&#8208;arylbuta&#8208;1,2&#8208;diene.

         <title>Frustrated Lewis Pair (FLP) Reactivity from Carbone&#8211;BPh3 Lewis Adduct</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Frustrated Lewis Pair (FLP) reactivity toward the activation of various small molecules and the catalytic reduction of ketones have been demonstrated using a carbodicarbene (CDC)&#9472;BPh3 adduct. Mechanistic studies, including NMR exchange spectroscopy and DFT calculations, reveal that reversible adduct dissociation generates a transient encounter complex essential for the observed FLP&#8208;type reactivity.








Abstract
We present a systematic investigation of the Frustrated Lewis Pair (FLP) chemistry of carbodicarbenes (fCDCs) featuring varied steric profiles in combination with strong (B(C6F5)3, BCF) and weak (BPh3) boron Lewis acids. The resulting CDC&#8211;borane systems display a full spectrum of behaviors: (i) tightly bound Lewis adducts lacking FLP reactivity, (ii) adducts exhibiting reversible dissociation and activate small molecules via FLP&#8208;type reactivity, and (iii) a &#8220;classical&#8221; FLP that remain unbound. The most reactive Lewis adduct, 1&#183;BPh3, which exhibits the lowest dissociation energy, activates a broad range of bonds (C&#9472;H, O&#9472;H, N&#9472;H, H&#9472;B, H&#9472;Si, S&#9472;S, and CO2) and catalyzes hydroboration and hydrosilylation of ketones under mild, metal&#8208;free conditions. NMR exchange spectroscopy and DFT calculations reveal that its FLP reactivity originates from reversible dissociation and the formation of a reactive transient encounter complex. These findings establish carbone&#8208;based Lewis adducts as tunable platforms for FLP&#8208;type small molecule activation and main&#8208;group catalysis, where reactivity can be regulated through steric and electronic modulation.

         <title>Zinc(II) Monomeric, Dimeric, and Trimeric Photosensitizers with Microsecond&#8208;Lived Intra&#8208;Ligand Charge Transfer Excited States Investigated Through Time&#8208;Resolved Optical and X&#8208;Ray Spectroscopy</title>

         <dc:description>
An array of spectroscopic methods including femto&#8208;nanosecond optical transient absorption and nanosecond X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopies resolve the singlet intraligand charge transfer (1ILCT) and triplet (3ILCT) states in a family of Monomeric, Dimeric, and Trimeric Zn&#8208;based photosensitizers with phenanthroline&#8208;derived ligands. These results are crucial toward suggesting designs of new Zn&#8208;based complexes that can be employed for energy transfer and photoredox catalytic reactions.








Abstract
ZnII photosensitizers relative to CuI complexes have received less attention due to their energetically higher metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer states. Three ZnII complexes, namely a Monomer, a bimetallic helicate, and a trimetallic helicate, bearing phenanthroline ligands are hereby studied through time&#8208;resolved X&#8208;ray absorption (tr&#8208;XAS) and femto&#8208;microsecond optical transient absorption spectroscopy (OTA). The formation of intraligand singlet charge transfer (IILCT) excited states is achieved within femtoseconds, followed by intersystem crossing (ISC) in nanoseconds to generate microsecond&#8208;lived triplet (3ILCT) states. Femtosecond OTA shows that the 1ILCT states in the Monomer, Dimer, and Trimer occur within 235 fs, 683 fs, and 730 fs, respectively, while nano&#8208;microsecond OTA and tr&#8208;XAS show their 3ILCT states to decay within 1.00 &#181;s, 1.48 &#181;s, and 1.51 &#181;s. The ISC from the 1ILCT to the 3ILCT state for the Trimer is 42.8&#160;ns compared to the Monomer and Dimer with ISC rates of less than 13&#160;ns. These differences arise due to the stabilization by &#960;&#8208;&#960; and CH&#8208;&#960; noncovalent interactions of the phenanthroline ligands. The dihedral and torsional angles indicate stronger ligand strains in the excited states of the Dimer and Trimer versus the Monomer. DFT calculations for the electrochemical oxidation potentials further highlight their capability in inducing photoredox processes.

         <title>A Fluorinated Anodic Aluminum Oxide Nanopores Coating Triboelectric Nanogenerator for Self&#8208;healing Triboelectrification and Anti&#8208;corrosion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Triboelectric nanogenerator with the surface of alumina nanostructures by anodic oxidation method was prepared. Compared to TENG with aluminum sheets, TENG with alumina nanopores has higher triboelectric output. Low surface energy compounds loaded in alumina nanopores can migrate to the surface to achieve a triboelectrification self&#8208;healing property. In addition to supplying energy such as lighting, the electrical energy collected with TENG can also be used to protect carbon steel against corrosion through self&#8208;powered cathodic protection.








Abstract
The triboelectric layer is a key component affecting the performance of a triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG). Herein, a TENG with a triboelectric layer possessing a fluorinated&#8208;anodic&#8208;alumina&#8208;nanopores structure was prepared. The nanopores structure can increase the contact area and thus increase the triboelectric output. The fluorination treatment further increased the output. The current output of this TENG is 10.4&#160;&#181;A, while that of the TENG with a pristine&#8208;aluminum&#8208;based triboelectric layer is 3.7&#160;&#181;A. The ability of the low&#8208;surface&#8208;energy compounds loaded in the alumina nanopores to migrate to the surface leads to a triboelectrification self&#8208;healing property. In addition to supplying energy such as lighting, the electrical energy collected with TENG can also be used to protect carbon steel against corrosion through self&#8208;powered cathodic protection.

         <title>In Quest for Polyenic Macrolactam JBIR&#8208;150 Identity: Stereoselective Synthesis of DP4+&#8208;Based Purported Structure and Biogenetically Inspired Positional Stereoisomers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The DP4+&#8208;predicted (8R,10R,19R)&#8208;JBIR&#8208;150 stereoisomer and the C11&#8208;epimeric structures of iso&#8208;JBIR&#8208;150 with the hydroxyl groups located at the odd&#8208;numbered positions (C9 and C11) as biogenetically inspired by the collinearity principle of their modular sequence, namely (9S,11S,19R)&#8208;iso&#8208;JBIR&#8208;150&#8208;1 and (9S,11R,19R)&#8208;iso&#8208;JBIR&#8208;150&#8208;2, were stereoselectively synthesized, but the NMR data did not match those of the natural product, which keeps its structure undetermined.








Abstract
Total synthesis of polyenic macrolactam JBIR&#8208;150 with all&#8208;trans geometries, hydroxyl substituents located at C8 and C10 and 8R,10R,19R absolute configuration, the most likely stereoisomer predicted by DP4+ calculations, was completed. The formal syn&#8208;1,3&#8208;diol was synthesized iteratively by enantio&#8208; and diastereoselective Krische's allylation reactions. The construction of the conjugated triene units was based on a Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling of the corresponding alkenylboronates and alkenyliodides, and Horner&#8208;Wadsworth&#8208;Emmons (HWE) condensation reactions. Macrolactam formation promoted by HATU and DIPEA was best carried out by amine protecting group exchange and release of both reactive functional groups under basic conditions. Given the lack of correspondence of the 1H&#8208; and 13C&#8208;NMR data for the synthetic and purported JBIR&#8208;150, the hydroxyl groups of JBIR&#8208;150 were alternatively proposed to be located at the odd&#8208;numbered positions (C9, C11) based on the general biogenesis of the family of polyenic macrolactams and the collinearity principle of their modular sequence. The C11&#8208;diastereoisomers of the biogenetically inspired 9,11&#8208;dihydroxy positional isomers (termed iso&#8208;JBIR&#8208;150) with formal syn&#8208; and anti&#8208;diol configurations were completed. Much to our dismay, the NMR data of the synthetic diastereomeric polyenic macrolactams with 9S,11S,19R or 9S,11R,19R absolute configuration did not match those of the natural product, and the structural identity of JBIR&#8208;150 remains undetermined.

         <title>5d Orbital Covalency Controls the High&#8208;Pressure Polymorphism of BaO</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The influence of metal d orbitals on the high&#8208;pressure structures of CaO, SrO, and BaO are investigated with DFT calculations and chemical bonding analysis. CaO and SrO undergo the B1&#8208;B2 transition, from the rock salt structure to the caesium chloride structure, while BaO undergoes a sequence of transitions from B1&#8208;B8, the NiAs structure, and then B8&#8722; dB2, a distorted form of B2. DFT calculations of bond strengths show that the B8 and dB2 structures are stabilized relative to B1 and B2 by metal&#8208;oxygen covalency through the metal d orbitals. In BaO covalency outweighs electrostatics because of the large 5d orbitals of Ba, so the unique B8 and dB2 structures form. This marks an important expansion of the importance of d orbitals in group II chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemical Properties of an Aryloxenium Cation with a Triplet Electronic Ground State</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aryloxenium cations contain a formally positively&#8208;charged, monovalent oxygen atom with an incomplete electron shell. In spite of this unusual structural element, they are key intermediates in many important processes, such as biological oxidation reactions and the industrial generation of thermoplastics. However, the development of new applications is hindered by the lack of knowledge on their fundamental chemical properties. While most past studies have focused on aryloxenium cations with singlet electronic ground states, minor structural modifications can produce aryloxenium cations that have a triplet ground state. Unfortunately, examination of the reactivity of triplet aryloxenium cations is limited to just two studies that reported the detection of H atom abstraction from solvents. A detailed kinetic reactivity study involving cyclohexane, allyl iodide and dimethyl disulfide reagents is reported here for an aryloxenium cation with a triplet electronic ground state, the 2&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;pyridyloxenium cation.</dc:description>
