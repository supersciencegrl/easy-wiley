      <title>Rapid On&#8208;chip Synthesis of Complex Glycomimetics from N&#8208;glycan Scaffolds for Improved Lectin Targeting</title>
      <dc:description>C&#8208;type lectin receptor (CLR) carbohydrate binding proteins found on immune cells with important functions in pathogen recognition and self and non&#8208;self&#8208;differentiation are increasingly moving into the focus of drug developers as targets for the immune therapy of cancer autoimmune diseases and inflammation and to improve the efficacy of vaccines. The development of molecules with increased affinity and selectivity over the natural glycan binders has largely focused on the synthesis of mono and disaccharide mimetics but glycan array binding experiments have shown increased binding selectivity and affinity for selected larger oligosaccharides that are able to engage in additional favorable interactions beyond the primary binding site. Here we present a platform for the rapid preparation and screening of N&#8208;glycan mimetics on microarrays that turns a panel of complex glycan core structures into structurally diverse glycomimetics by a combination of enzymatic glycosylation with non&#8208;natural donors and subsequent cycloaddition with a collection of alkynes. All surface based reactions were monitored by MALDI&#8208;Tof MS to assess conversion and purity of spot compositions. Screening the collection of 374 N&#8208;glycomimetics against the plant lectin WFA and the 2 human immune lectins MGL and Langerin produced a number of high affinity binders as lead structures for more selective lectin targeting probes.</dc:description>

      <title>Tuning the outcome&#160;of enzyme&#8208;mediated dynamic cyclodextrin libraries to&#160;enhance&#160;template effects</title>
      <dc:description>Enzyme&#8208;mediated dynamic combinatorial chemistry combines the concept of thermodynamically controlled covalent self&#8208;assembly with the inherent biological relevance of enzymatic transformations. We explore a system of interconverting cyclodextrins wherein the glycosidic linkage is rendered dynamic by the action of cyclodextrin glucanotransferase (CGTase). We report that external factors, such as pH, temperature, solvent, and salinity can be modulated to influence the composition of the dynamic cyclodextrin library. Dynamic libraries of cyclodextrins (CDs) could be obtained in wide ranges of pH (5.0 &#8208; &#160;9.0), temperature (5 &#8208;&#160;37 &#186;C), and salinity (up to 7.5 M NaNO  3  ), and with high organic solvent content (50% by volume of ethanol), showing that enzyme&#8208;mediated dynamic systems can be robust and not limited to physiological conditions. Furthermore, we demonstrate how strategic choice of reaction conditions can enhance template effects, in this case, to achieve highly selective production &#945;&#8208;CD, an otherwise challenging target due to competition from the structurally similar&#160;&#946;&#8208;CD.</dc:description>

      <title>Stepwise Assembly of an Electroactive Framework from a Co6S8 Superatomic Metalloligand and Cuprous Iodide Building Units</title>
      <dc:description>The design of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) that incorporate more than one metal cluster constituent is a challenging task. Conventional one&#8208;pot reaction protocols require judicious selection of ligand and metal ion precursors, yet remain unpredictable. Stable, preformed nanoclusters, with ligand shells that can undergo additional coordination&#8208;driven reactions, provide a platform for assembling multi&#8208;cluster solids with precision. Herein, a discrete Co6S8 (PTA) 6 (PTA = 1,3,5&#8208;triaza&#8208;7&#8208;phosphaadamantane) superatomic&#8208;metalloligand is assembled into a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) coordination polymer comprising Cu4I4 secondary building units (SBUs). The resulting heterobimetallic framework ( 1 ) contains two distinct cluster constituents and bifunctional PTA linkers. Solid&#8208;state diffuse reflectance studies reveal that 1 is an optical semiconductor with a band&#8208;gap of 1.59 eV. Framework&#8208;modified electrodes exhibit reversible redox behavior in the solid state arising from the Co6S8&#160;superatoms, which remain intact during framework synthesis.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>The use of miniemulsions containing chemical precursors in the disperse phase is a versatile method to produce nanoparticles and nanostructures of different chemical nature, including not only polymers, but also a variety of inorganic materials. This minireview focuses on materials in which nanostructures of metal oxides are synthesized in processes that involve the miniemulsion technique in any of the steps. This includes in the first place those approaches in which the spaces provided by nanodroplets are directly used to confine precipitation reactions that lead eventually to oxides. On the other hand, miniemulsions can also be used to form functionalized polymer nanoparticles that can serve either as supports or as controlling agents for the synthesis of metal oxides. Herein, the description of essential aspects of the methods is combined with the most representative examples reported in the last years for each strategy.</dc:description>

      <title>Unveiling VIVO2+ binding modes to human serum albumins by an integrated spectroscopic&#8208;computational approach</title>
      <dc:description>Human serum albumin (HSA) is involved in the transport of metal ions and potential metallodrugs. Depending on the metal, several sites are available, among which  N  &#8208;terminal (NTS) and multi&#8208;metal binding site (MBS). Despite the large number of X&#8208;ray determinations for albumins, only one structure with Zn2+  is available. In this work, the binding to HSA of VIVO2+  ion was studied by an integrated approach based on spectroscopic and computational methods, which allowed to characterize the systems even in the absence of an X&#8208;ray analysis. The behavior depends on the type of albumin, defatted (HSAd) or fatted (HSAf). With HSAd  &#8216;primary&#8217; and &#8216;secondary&#8217; sites were revealed, NTS with (His3, His9, Asp13, Asp255) and MBS with (His67, His247, Asp249, Asn99 or H2O); with increasing the ratio VIVO2/HSAd, &#8216;tertiary&#8217; sites, with one His&#8208;N and others donors (Asp/Glu&#8208;O or carbonyl&#8208;O) are populated.

      <title>Specific Reactions of RSNO/HSNO/HNO and Their Applications in the Design of Fluorescent Probes</title>
      <dc:description>Nitric oxide (NO)&#8208;derived species play essential roles in regulating cellular responses. Among these species, S&#8208;nitrosothiols (including RSNO and HSNO) and nitroxyl (HNO) are especially interesting. Owing to their high reactivity and short survival time the detection of these molecules in biological settings can be challenging. In this regard, much effort has been put on exploring novel reactions of RSNO/HSNO/HNO and applying these reactions to develop fluorescence probes. In this mini&#8208;review we summarized reported specific reactions of RSNO/HSNO/HNO and illustrated strategies that were used in the design of fluorescent probes. The properties and potential problems of representative probes were also discussed.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Nitric oxide (NO)&#8208;derived species play essential roles in regulating cellular responses. Among these species, S&#8208;nitrosothiols (including RSNO and HSNO) and nitroxyl (HNO) are especially interesting. Owing to their high reactivity and short survival time the detection of these molecules in biological settings can be challenging. In this regard, much effort has been put on exploring novel reactions of RSNO/HSNO/HNO and applying these reactions to develop fluorescence probes. In this mini&#8208;review we summarized reported specific reactions of RSNO/HSNO/HNO and illustrated strategies that were used in the design of fluorescent probes. The properties and potential problems of representative probes were also discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Orthogonal Photoswitching Using Norbornadiene</title>
      <dc:description>Orthogonal photoswitching is a convenient but challenging way of controlling multiple functions in a system by selective photoisomerization of one unit before the other in any arbitrarily chosen sequence. Here we present this concept for the norbornadiene/quadricyclane (NBD/QC) photo/thermo&#8208;switch in the presence or absence of a coordinated metal ion. Thus, introducing two pyridyl ligands via ethyne&#8208;1,2&#8208;diyl bridges provides a system that by chelation of metal ions, such as Pd(II), has altered optical and switching properties. Mixing the Pd(II) complex with its free ligand furnishes a four&#8208;state system where NBD&#8208;to&#8208;QC photoisomerizations for complexed and uncomplexed species are controlled by the irradiation wavelength and can occur orthogonally, that is, the sequence of photoisomerizations can be swapped. Studies on Ag(I) and Pb(II) complexes, being less stable than the Pd(II) complex, are also presented; these exhibit like the Pd(II) complex significantly redshifted NBD absorptions.</dc:description>

      <title>Surface Functionalization of Black Phosphorus with a Highly Reducing Organoruthenium Complex: Interface Properties and Enhanced Photoresponsivity of Photodetectors</title>
      <dc:description>
The heterostructure built by vacuum deposition of ruthenium complex onto black phosphorus (BP) was concretely investigated, in regard to the interfacial electronic structure and electrical, optical and optoelectrical properties of the hybrid device. It was found that electrons transferred from molecular donors to BP are trapped at the interface and act as hole traps. The performance of photodetector based on the BP&#8211;ruthenium complex heterostructure was improved by one order of magnitude compared to the pristine BP device.







Abstract
In this work, a heterostructure obtained by vacuum evaporation of a strong molecular n&#8208;dopant, [RuCp*(mes)]2, onto black phosphorus (BP) is reported, along with the systematic investigation of the interfacial structure and properties by various in situ characterization techniques. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectra (UPS) showed a large decrease in the work function of BP and a new peak within the bandgap, which is attributed to electron transfer from dopants to the underlying BP. The electrons trapped at the interface act as hole traps and induce photogating effect so that a photodetector based on BP&#8211;organoruthenium complex heterostructure demonstrates a photoresponsivity of 5.5&#8197;mA&#8201;W&#8722;1 and an EQE of 1.3&#8201;% at 515&#8197;nm, a tenfold improvement compared to the pristine BP device.

     alt="Surface Functionalization of Black Phosphorus with a Highly Reducing Organoruthenium Complex: Interface Properties and Enhanced Photoresponsivity of Photodetectors"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The heterostructure &lt;/b&gt; built by vacuum deposition of ruthenium complex onto black phosphorus (BP) was concretely investigated, in regard to the interfacial electronic structure and electrical, optical and optoelectrical properties of the hybrid device. It was found that electrons transferred from molecular donors to BP are trapped at the interface and act as hole traps. The performance of photodetector based on the BP&#8211;ruthenium complex heterostructure was improved by one order of magnitude compared to the pristine BP device.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this work, a heterostructure obtained by vacuum evaporation of a strong molecular n&#8208;dopant, [RuCp*(mes)]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, onto black phosphorus (BP) is reported, along with the systematic investigation of the interfacial structure and properties by various in situ characterization techniques. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectra (UPS) showed a large decrease in the work function of BP and a new peak within the bandgap, which is attributed to electron transfer from dopants to the underlying BP. The electrons trapped at the interface act as hole traps and induce photogating effect so that a photodetector based on BP&#8211;organoruthenium complex heterostructure demonstrates a photoresponsivity of 5.5&#8197;mA&#8201;W&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and an EQE of 1.3&#8201;% at 515&#8197;nm, a tenfold improvement compared to the pristine BP device.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Towards Antimonene and 2D Antimony Telluride through Electrochemical Exfoliation</title>
      <dc:description>
2D Sb and Sb2Te3 sheets: Few&#8208; to&#8208;multilayered sheets (micrometer size) of 2D layered Sb and Sb2Te3 have been obtained by electrochemical exfoliation. The 2D layered rhombohedral Sb was exfoliated in Na2SO4 and Li2SO4 electrolytes by anodic&#8211;cationic intercalation, whereas Sb2Te3 in Na2SO4 but changing the voltage polarity. These procedures have the advantage to be solution&#8208;based room&#8208;temperature electrochemical exfoliations stable under glove&#8208;box&#8208;free conditions.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) layered antimony (Sb) and antimony telluride (Sb2Te3) are two valuable materials for optoelectronic devices and thermoelectric applications. Preparing high&#8208;quality sheets of these materials is the initial phase to promote their expected issues. Herein, micrometer&#8208;sized few&#8208;to&#8208;multilayered sheets of Sb and Sb2Te3 have been obtained by electrochemical exfoliation. The layered rhombohedral Sb was exfoliated in Na2SO4 and Li2SO4 electrolytes by anodic&#8211;cationic intercalation, and Sb2Te3 was exfoliated in Na2SO4. These findings are important contributions for the solution&#8208;based room&#8208;temperature electrochemical exfoliation, which is stable under glove&#8208;box&#8208;free conditions, to further improve the production of high&#8208;quality exfoliated sheets.

      <title>Improved Interfacial Bonding Strength and Reliability of Functionalized Graphene Oxide for Cement Reinforcement Applications</title>
      <dc:description>
Concrete covalent strength: Functionalized graphene oxide (FGO) is developed as a nano&#8208;reinforcing agent for cement mortar. Compared with many other reinforcing materials, FGO nanoplatelets show great advantages, including strong physical and chemical bonding with C&#8722;S&#8722;H, good dispersibility, high reliability in a Ca2+&#8208;rich environment, and the ability to refine hydrated structures of cement.







Abstract
Poor bonding strength between nanomaterials and cement composites inevitably lead to the failure of reinforcement. Herein, a novel functionalization method for the fabrication of functionalized graphene oxide (FGO), which is capable of forming highly reliable covalent bonds with cement hydration products, and therefore, suitable for use as an efficient reinforcing agent for cement composites, is discussed. The bonding strength between cement and aggregates was improved more than 21 times with the reinforcement of FGO. The fabricated FGO also demonstrated many important features, including high reliability in cement pastes, good dispersibility, and efficient structural refinement of cement hydration products. With the incorporation of FGO, cement mortar samples demonstrated up to 40&#8201;% increased early and ultimate strength. Such results make the fast demolding and manufacture of light constructions become highly possible, and show strong advantages on improving productivity, saving cost, and reducing CO2 emissions in practical applications.

      <title>Ionic Polyimide Derived Porous Carbon Nanosheets as High&#8208;Efficiency Oxygen Reduction Catalysts for Zn&#8211;Air Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
Two&#8208;dimensional porous carbon nanosheets (2DPCs) with controlled hexagonal morphology and uniform nitrogen dopants were prepared by using ionic polyimide as the precursor. The activated 2DPCs (2DPCs&#8208;a) exhibited promising oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance in alkaline and acidic media. As air cathode in Zn&#8211;air batteries, the 2DPCs&#8208;a&#8208;based batteries showed long stability and high capacity up to 614&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1. The morphology and chemical composition of the as&#8208;prepared 2DPCs&#8208;a were stable after a long&#8208;term stability measurement.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) porous carbon nanosheets (2DPCs) have attracted great attention for their good porosity and long&#8208;distance conductivity. Factors such as templates, precursors, and carbonization&#8211;activation methods, directly determine their performance. However, rational design and preparation of porous carbon materials with controlled 2D morphology and heteroatom dopants remains a challenge. Therefore, an ionic polyimide with both sp2&#8208; and sp3&#8208;hybridized nitrogen atoms was prepared as a precursor for fabricating N&#8208;doped hexagonal porous carbon nanosheets through a hard&#8208;template approach. Because of the large surface area and efficient charge&#8208;mass transport, the resulting activated 2D porous carbon nanosheets (2DPCs&#8208;a) displayed promising electrocatalytic properties for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in alkaline and acidic media, such as ultralow half&#8208;wave potential (0.83 vs. 0.84&#8197;V of Pt/C) and superior limiting current density (5.42 vs. 5.14&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 of Pt/C). As air cathodes in Zn&#8211;air batteries, the as&#8208;developed 2DPCs&#8208;a exhibited long stability and high capacity (up to 614&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1), which are both higher than those of commercial Pt/C. This work provides a convenient method for controllable and scalable 2DPCs fabrication as well as new opportunities to develop high&#8208;efficiency electrocatalysts for ORR and Zn&#8211;air batteries.

      <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Germanium Sulfide Nanosheets as an Ultra&#8208;Stable and High Capacity Anode for Lithium Ion Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
Between the nanosheets: Two&#8208;dimensional germanium sulfide nanosheets are synthesized by a controllable process, which could deliver superior lithium storage performance in terms of high specific capacity, stable cycling and good rate performances.







Abstract
Lithium ion batteries (LIBs) at present still suffer from low rate capability and poor cycle life during fast ion insertion/extraction processes. Searching for high&#8208;capacity and stable anode materials is still an ongoing challenge. Herein, a facile strategy for the synthesis of ultrathin GeS2 nanosheets with the thickness of 1.1&#8197;nm is reported. When used as anodes for LIBs, the two&#8208;dimensional (2D) structure can effectively increase the electrode/electrolyte interface area, facilitate the ion transport, and buffer the volume expansion. Benefiting from these merits, the as&#8208;synthesized GeS2 nanosheets deliver high specific capacity (1335&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.15&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1), extraordinary rate performance (337&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 15&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) and stable cycling performance (974&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 200&#8197;cycles at 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1). Importantly, our fabricated Li&#8208;ion full cells manifest an impressive specific capacity of 577&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 50&#8197;cycles at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 and a high energy density of 361&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 at a power density of 346&#8197;W&#8201;kg&#8722;1. Furthermore, the electrochemical reaction mechanism is investigated by the means of ex&#8208;situ high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy. These results suggest that GeS2 can use to be an alternative anode material and encourage more efforts to develop other high&#8208;performance LIBs anodes.

Benefiting from these merits, the as&#8208;synthesized GeS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanosheets deliver high specific capacity (1335&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.15&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), extraordinary rate performance (337&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 15&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and stable cycling performance (974&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; after 200&#8197;cycles at 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). Importantly, our fabricated Li&#8208;ion full cells manifest an impressive specific capacity of 577&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; after 50&#8197;cycles at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and a high energy density of 361&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at a power density of 346&#8197;W&#8201;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Furthermore, the electrochemical reaction mechanism is investigated by the means of ex&#8208;situ high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy. These results suggest that GeS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; can use to be an alternative anode material and encourage more efforts to develop other high&#8208;performance LIBs anodes.&lt;/p&gt;

Abstract
This Special Issue of Chemistry&#8211;A European Journal is dedicated to the Chemical Functionalization of 2D Materials, and features some great contributions from experts in the field of 2D materials. This issue was originally assembled to support the Symposium&#8197;G &#8220;Chemical Functionalization of 2D Materials&#8221; at the European Materials Research Society (E&#8208;MRS) 2020 Spring Meeting, which was originally scheduled to be held in Strasbourg, France, from May 25th to 29th, 2020. Although the E&#8208;MRS 2020 Spring Meeting has been cancelled due to the COVID&#8208;19 outbreak, the publication of this Special Issue has proceeded and has become even more important as the contributors discuss diverse and timely research themes related to 2D materials. In this Editorial, a brief overview of the different types of 2D materials is given, together with the chemical functionalization schemes that can be applied to them to achieve new properties as well as enable improved performance in applications. Some of the articles featured in this Special Issue are also highlighted, with the hope that they will inspire readers and further advance the field.

      <dc:description>
Highly efficient electrocatalysts are critical for high efficiency hydrogen production. Nevertheless, due to the scarcity and limited availability of the current commercial noble&#8208;metal&#8208;based electrode materials, the research direction has turned to seek alternative candidates by employing the earth&#8208;abundant transition metals (TMs). This Minireview provides a comprehensive survey of recent advanced achievement in developing strategies for TMs&#8208;based electrocatalysts toward hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction under alkaline conditions.

      <title>Molybdenum Disulfide Based Nanomaterials for Rechargeable Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
MoS2 for energy storage: Molybdenum disulfide based materials have shown great promise for electrochemical energy storage. This Review summarizes the recent progress in the design of diverse MoS2&#8208;based micro/nanostructures for rechargeable batteries, including lithium&#8208;ion, lithium&#8208;sulfur, sodium&#8208;ion, potassium&#8208;ion, and multivalent&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
The rapid development of electrochemical energy storage systems requires new electrode materials with high performance. As a two&#8208;dimensional material, molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) has attracted increasing interest in energy storage applications due to its layered structure, tunable physical and chemical properties, and high capacity. In this review, the atomic structures and properties of different phases of MoS2 are first introduced. Then, typical synthetic methods for MoS2 and MoS2&#8208;based composites are presented. Furthermore, the recent progress in the design of diverse MoS2&#8208;based micro/nanostructures for rechargeable batteries, including lithium&#8208;ion, lithium&#8208;sulfur, sodium&#8208;ion, potassium&#8208;ion, and multivalent&#8208;ion batteries, is overviewed. Additionally, the roles of advanced in situ/operando techniques and theoretical calculations in elucidating fundamental insights into the structural and electrochemical processes taking place in these materials during battery operation are illustrated. Finally, a perspective is given on how the properties of MoS2&#8208;based electrode materials are further improved and how they can find widespread application in the next&#8208;generation electrochemical energy&#8208;storage systems.

Abstract
Efficient exfoliation and downsizing of Sb2S3 and Bi2S3 layered compounds by using scalable bipolar electrochemistry on their suspensions in aqueous media are here demonstrated. The resulting samples were characterized in detail by transmission electron microscopy, energy&#8208;dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy, and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy; their electrochemistry toward hydrogen evolution was also investigated. Hydrogen evolution ability of exfoliated Sb2S3 and Bi2S3 was investigated and compared to the bulk counterparts.

      <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Transport Properties of Graphene with Defects Derived from Oxo&#8208;Graphene</title>
      <dc:description>
The effect of defects: The room&#8208;temperature mobility values of single&#8208;layer graphene derived from oxo&#8208;graphene with densities of defects between 0.2&#8201;% and 1.5&#8201;% are presented. The fundamental findings can explain the generally diverging results reported for reduced graphene oxide used in applications.







Abstract
In recent years, graphene oxide has been considered as a soluble precursor of graphene for electronic applications. However, the performance lags behind that of graphene due to lattice defects. Here, the relation between the density of defects in the range of 0.2&#8201;% and 1.5&#8201;% and the transport properties is quantitatively studied. Therefore, the related flakes of monolayers of graphene were prepared from oxo&#8208;functionalized graphene (oxo&#8208;G). The morphologic structure of oxo&#8208;G was imaged by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). Field&#8208;effect mobility values were determined to range between 0.3&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 and 33.2&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, which were inversely proportional to the density of defects. These results provide the first quantitative description of the density of defects and transport properties, which plays an important role for potential applications.

      <title>In Situ Immobilization of Palladium Nanodots in C&#8722;C Bonded 2D Conjugated Polymers through Suzuki Polymerization at the Liquid&#8211;Liquid Interface</title>
      <dc:description>
In one step! Palladium nanodots were in situ immobilized in 2D conjugated polymers during their preparation through Suzuki polymerization at the liquid&#8211;liquid interface in one step and under mild conditions. This method provides a new way of loading metal particles in 2D materials.







Abstract
Traditional methods for immobilization of noble metal nanodots in 2D materials (2DMs) need multiple steps and unfriendly reaction conditions. Herein, a one&#8208;step method was developed by immobilizing in situ palladium nanodots during the preparation of the 2D conjugated polymer (2DCP) through Suzuki polymerization on interface under mild conditions. Through this method, three 2D conjugated nanosheets carrying palladium nanodots were synthesized.

      <dc:description>
Sharing is caring: La3B6O13(OH) was obtained via a high&#8208;pressure/high&#8208;temperature route at 6&#8197;GPa and 1673&#8197;K. The compound represents the first acentric borate displaying the rare feature of edge&#8208;sharing BO4 tetrahedra.

Abstract
La3B6O13(OH) was obtained by a high&#8208;pressure/high&#8208;temperature experiment at 6&#8197;GPa and 1673&#8197;K. The compound crystallizes in the space group P21 (no. 4) with the lattice parameters a=4.785(2), b=12.880(4), c=7.433(3)&#8197;&#197;, and &#946;=90.36(10)&#176;, and is built up of corner&#8208; as well as edge&#8208;sharing BO4 tetrahedra. It represents the first acentric high&#8208;pressure borate containing these B2O6 entities. The compound develops borate layers of &#8222;sechser&#8220;&#8208;rings with the La3+ cations positioned between the layers. Single&#8208;crystal and powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, vibrational and MAS NMR spectroscopy, second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) and thermoanalytical measurements, as well as computational methods were used to affirm the proposed structure and the B2O6 entities.

      <title>N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene (NHC)&#8208;Stabilized Ru0 Nanoparticles: In Situ Generation of an Efficient Transfer Hydrogenation Catalyst</title>
      <dc:description>
N&#8208;Heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;stabilized Ru0 nanoparticles (NPs) were generated in situ from tethered and untethered ruthenium half&#8208;sandwich complexes. These catalytically active Ru0 NPs were explored for transfer hydrogenation of aromatic ketones in 2&#8208;propanol. The transfer hydrogenation catalyzed by these NPs possess a high turnover number. The catalytic efficiency was significantly reduced if these NPs were exposed to air or allowed to aggregate and precipitate by cooling the reaction mixtures.







Abstract
Tethered and untethered ruthenium half&#8208;sandwich complexes were synthesized and characterized spectroscopically. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis of three untethered and two tethered Ru N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) complexes were also carried out. These RuNHC complexes catalyze transfer hydrogenation of aromatic ketones in 2&#8208;propanol under reflux, optimally in the presence of (25&#8197;mol&#8201;%) KOH. Under these conditions, the formation of 2&#8211;3&#8197;nm&#8208;sized Ru0 nanoparticles was detected by TEM measurements. A solid&#8208;state NMR investigation of the nanoparticles suggested that the NHC ligands were bound to the surface of the Ru nanoparticles (NPs). This base&#8208;promoted route to NHC&#8208;stabilized ruthenium nanoparticles directly from arene&#8208;tethered ruthenium&#8211;NHC complexes and from untethered ruthenium&#8211;NHC complexes is more convenient than previously known routes to NHC&#8208;stabilized Ru nanocatalysts. Similar catalytically active RuNPs were also generated from the reaction of a mixture of [RuCl2(p&#8208;cymene)]2 and the NHC precursor with KOH in isopropanol under reflux. The transfer hydrogenation catalyzed by these NHC&#8208;stabilized RuNPs possess a high turnover number. The catalytic efficiency was significantly reduced if nanoparticles were exposed to air or allowed to aggregate and precipitate by cooling the reaction mixtures during the reaction.

Abstract
In this study a bispidine ligand has been applied to the complexation of gallium(III) and radiolabelled with gallium&#8208;68 for the first time. Despite its 5&#8208;coordinate nature, the resulting complex is stable in serum for over two hours, demonstrating a ligand system well matched to the imaging window of gallium&#8208;68 positron emission tomography (PET). To show the versatility of the bispidine ligand and its potential use in PET, the bifunctional chelator was conjugated to a porphyrin, producing a PET/PDT&#8208;theranostic, which showed the same level of stability to serum as the non&#8208;conjugated gallium&#8208;68 complex. The PET/PDT complex killed &gt;90&#8201;% of HT&#8208;29 cells upon light irradiation at 50&#8197;&#956;m. This study shows bispidines have the versatility to be used as a ligand system for gallium&#8208;68 in PET.

      <title>Highly conductive cobalt perthiolated coronene complex for efficient hydrogen evolution</title>
      <dc:description>Metal&#8208;bis(dithiolene)  is one of the most promising structure showing redox activity, excellent electron transport and magnetic properties as well as catalytic activities. Perthiolated coronene (PTC), an emerging highly symmetric ligand containing the smallest graphene nanoplate was employed to manufacture a hybrid material with fused metal&#8208;bis(dithiolene) and graphene nanoplate, and it has been demonstrated as an efficient strategy for the construction of multifunctional materials recently. Here, Co&#8208;PTC, a 2D MOF containing Co&#8208;bis(dithiolene) and coronene units is prepared via a homogeneous reaction for the first time as powder samples, which are bar&#8208;shaped micro&#8208;particles composed of nanosheets. A neutral formula of [Co  3  (C  24  S  12  )]  n  is verified for Co&#8208;PTC. Co&#8208;PTC plays an ultrahigh conductivity of approximately 45 S cm  &#8208;1  at room temperature as compressed samples, which is among the highest value ever reported for the compressed powder samples of conducting MOFs. Moreover, Co&#8208;PTC exhibits good electrocatalytic performance in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with a Tafel slope of 189 mV decade  &#8208;1  and an operating overpotential of 227 mV at 10 mA cm  &#8208;1  with PH=0, as well as a remarkable stability in the extremely acidic aqueous solutions, which is&#160;the best hydrogen evolution properties among metal&#8208;organic compounds.</dc:description>

Co&#8208;PTC plays an ultrahigh conductivity of approximately 45 S cm  &#8208;1  at room temperature as compressed samples, which is among the highest value ever reported for the compressed powder samples of conducting MOFs. Moreover, Co&#8208;PTC exhibits good electrocatalytic performance in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with a Tafel slope of 189 mV decade  &#8208;1  and an operating overpotential of 227 mV at 10 mA cm  &#8208;1  with PH=0, as well as a remarkable stability in the extremely acidic aqueous solutions, which is&#160;the best hydrogen evolution properties among metal&#8208;organic compounds.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Photophysics, Electrochemistry and Efficient Electrochemiluminescence of Trigonal Truxene&#8208;core Dyes</title>
      <dc:description>We synthesized and characterized a series of dyes built from spirofluorene or truxene core. The quadrupolar spirofluorene system is the initial building unit for the design and preparation of more complex star&#8208;shaped dyes consisting of a truxene core bearing three di&#8208; or triphenylamine moieties with or without thiophene connector. Their photophysical, electrochemical, and electrochemiluminescence (ECL) properties were first investigated in solution.

The photophysical and redox characteristics are drastically tuned by the introduction of thiophene bridge and electron&#8208;donor substituents at their terminal branches. These comparative studies show the essential role of the stability of both radical cations and anions to obtain efficient ECL dyes. The stabilization of the radicals is directly related to the charge delocalization due to the &#960;&#8208;conjugation by the thiophene bridge. The brightest ECL is achieved by annihilation and coreactant (benzoyl peroxide) pathways with the blue&#8208;emitting truxene dye, which is 2&#8208;time and 4.5&#8208;time greater than that of the quadrupolar compound and reference [Ru(bpy)  3  ]  2+  emitter, respectively.

      <title>Synthesis of nitro&#8208;aryl functionalised 4&#8208;amino&#8208;1,8&#8208;naphthalimides and their evaluation as fluorescent hypoxia sensors</title>

The design and synthesis of responsive and targeted probes is necessary to allow such processes to be interrogated in the cellular environment. This remains a challenge, and requires methods for functionalisation of fluorophores with multiple appendages for sensing and targeting groups.

Here we evaluate methods for the incorporation of a hypoxia sensing group to 4&#8208;amino&#8208;1,8&#8208;naphthalimide. We developed an intermediate that allowed us to incorporate a sensing group, targeting group, and ICT donor to the naphthalimide core in a modular fashion. Synthetic strategies for attaching the hypoxia sensing group and how they affected the fluorescence of the naphthalimide were evaluated by photophysical characterisation and time&#8208;dependent density functional theory.

      <title>Reactive compression molding post&#8208;inverse vulcanization: A method to assemble, recycle, and repurpose sulfur polymers and composites</title>
      <dc:description>Inverse vulcanization provides dynamic and responsive materials made from elemental sulfur and unsaturated cross&#8208;linkers. These polymers have been used in a variety of applications such as energy storage, infrared optics, repairable materials, environmental remediation, and precision fertilizers. In spite of these advances, there is a need for methods to recycle and reprocess these polymers. In this study, polymers prepared by inverse vulcanization are shown to undergo reactive compression molding. In this process, the reactive interfaces of sulfur polymers are brought into contact by mechanical compression. Upon heating these molds at relatively low temperatures (~100 &#186;C), chemical bonding occurs at the polymer interfaces by S&#8208;S metathesis. This method of processing is distinct from previous studies on inverse vulcanization because the polymers examined in this study do not form a liquid phase when heated. Neither compression nor heating alone was sufficient to mold these polymers into new architectures, so this is a new concept in the manipulation of sulfur polymers. Additionally, high&#8208;level ab initio calculations revealed that the weakest S&#8208;S bond in organic polysulfides decreases linearly in strength from a sulfur rank of 2 to 4, but then remains constant at about ~100 kJ mol  &#8208;1  for higher sulfur rank. This is critical information in engineering these polymers for S&#8208;S metathesis. Guided by this insight, polymer repair, recycling, and repurposing into new composites was demonstrated.</dc:description>

      <title>N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes Reduce and Functionalize Copper Oxide Surfaces in One Pot</title>
      <dc:description>Benzimidazolium hydrogen carbonate salts have been shown to act as N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene precursors which can remove oxide from copper oxide surfaces and functionalize the resulting metallic surfaces in a single step.

      <title>Direct C&#8208;H Borylation of Arenes Catalyzed by Saturated Hydride&#8208;Boryl&#8208;Iridium&#8208;POP Complexes: Kinetic Analysis of the Elemental Steps</title>
      <dc:description>The saturated trihydride IrH3  {&#954;3  &#8208;P,O,P&#8208;[xant(Pi  Pr2)2  ]} (1; xant(Pi  Pr2)2  = 9,9&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;4,5&#8208;bis(diisopropylphosphino)xanthene) activates the B&#8208;H bond of two molecules of pinacolborane (HBpin) to give H2  and the hydride&#8208;boryl derivatives IrH2(Bpin){&#954;3  &#8208;P,O,P&#8208;[xant(Pi  Pr2)2]} (2) and IrH(Bpin)2  {&#954;3  &#8208;P,O,P&#8208;[xant(Pi  Pr2)2]} (3) in a sequential manner. Complex  3  activates a C&#8208;H bond of two molecules of benzene to form PhBpin and regenerates  2  and  1  also in a sequential manner. Thus, complexes  1,  2, and  3  define two cycles for the catalytic direct C&#8208;H borylation of arenes with HBpin, which have the dihydride  2  as a common intermediate.

Complex  3  activates a C&#8208;H bond of two molecules of benzene to form PhBpin and regenerates  2  and  1  also in a sequential manner. Thus, complexes  1,  2, and  3  define two cycles for the catalytic direct C&#8208;H borylation of arenes with HBpin, which have the dihydride  2  as a common intermediate. The C&#8208;H bond activation of the arenes is the rate determining step of both cycles, being the C&#8208;H oxidative addition to  3  faster than to  2  .

      <title>Electrophilic Chlorine from Chlorosulfonium Salts: A Highly Chemoselective Reduction of Sulfoxides</title>
      <dc:description>Herein, we describe a selective late&#8208;stage deoxygenation of sulfoxides based on a novel application of chlorosulfonium salts and, a new process using them generated in situ from sulfoxides as the source of electrophilic chlorine. The use of highly nucleophilic 1,3,5&#8208;trimethoxybenzene (TMB) as the reducing agent is described for the first time and applied successfully in the deoxygenation of simple and functionalized sulfoxides. The method is easy to handle, economic, appropriate for gram scale and decidedly appropriate for poly&#8208;functionalized molecules, as demonstrated with more than 45 examples, including commercial medicines and analogues. We also report some competition experiments to define the more reactive sulfoxide and a mechanistic proposal based on substrate and product observations.</dc:description>

      <title>A Dimeric Chromium(II) Pincer as an Electron Shuttle for N=N Bond Scission</title>
      <dc:description>Reduction of the bis&#8208;pyrazolyl pyridine complex [CrL]2 with 4 KC8, followed by addition of one azobenzene, PhNNPh, transfers reducing equivalents to three azobenzenes, to form [K3Cr(PhNNPh)3]. This has three k2 PhNNPh2&#8722; ligands and K+ bound to nitrogens of azobenzene. When the stoichiometry is modified to 1:4:3, the product is changed to [K2CrL(PhNNPh)2], which has C2 symmetry except for the intimate ion pairing of two K+ to reduced azobenzene nitrogens, and to pyrazolate and phenyl rings. The origin of the observed delivery of reducing equivalents to several, not to a single N=N bond, is traced to the resistance of the one&#8208;electron reduced substrate to receiving a second electron, and is thus a general phenomenon. [CrL]2 alone is shown to be a two&#8208;electron reductant towards benzo[c]cinnoline (BCC) resulting in a product of formula [Cr2L2(BCC)], where the reducing equivalents originate purely from CrII. An analogous study of reaction of [CrL]2 with azobenzene yields [Cr2L2(PhNNPh)(THF)]. Together these illustrate different modes for the Cr2L2 unit to bind and reduce the N=N bond. A least squares fit of the two singly reduced DFT structures shows the only major change is a re&#8208;orientation of one phenyl ring in order to avoid repulsion with potassium but to still allow interaction of that phenyl &#960; system with K+. This shows both the impact of K+, being modest to N/Cr interactions, but nevertheless accommodating some &#960; donation of phenyl to potassium. Finally, delivering increasing equivalents of KC8 leads to complete cleavage of the N=N bond, and both N bind to three CrII.</dc:description>

      <title>Productive Syntheses of Privileged Scaffolds Inspired by the Recognition of a Diels&#8208;Alder Pattern Common to three Classes of Natural Products</title>
      <dc:description>Identification of a common Diels&#8208;Alder pattern in three classes of bioactive natural products led us to study the synthesis and cycloaddition of a new class of cyclic dienes readily available from   &#8208;unsaturated lactams.

These were readily transformed into the corresponding O&#8208;silylated dienes which were reacted with dimethyl&#8208; and diethyl fumarate to yield stereoselectively highly functionalized bicyclic adducts. These exhibited unexpected and versatile transformations upon acid hydrolysis depending on the nature of the dienophile substituents and the acid catalyst. All reactions have been performed on multigram quantities. These transformations provide a convenient, economical, and easily scalable pathway for the rapid construction of functionally and stereochemically dense privileged scaffolds for the construction of libraries of natural products&#8208;inspired molecules of pharmacological relevance.</dc:description>

      <title>Unprecedented Reverse Volume Expansion in Spin&#8208;Transition Crystals</title>
      <dc:description>The current craze for research around the spin crossover phenomenon can be justified to some extent by the mechanical properties due to the decrease of volume associated with the transition of the metal ion from the HS state to the LS state. As demonstrated here, the molecular complex [Fe(PM&#8208; p BrA) 2 (NCS) 2 ] exhibits, on the contrary, an increase of the unit&#8208;cell volume from HS to LS. This counter&#8208;intuitive and unprecedented behavior that concerns both the thermal and the photo&#8208;excited spin conversions is revealed by a combination of single&#8208;crystal and powder X&#8208;ray diffraction complemented by magnetic measurements. Interestingly, this abnormal volume change appears concomitant with the wide rotation of a phenyl ring which induces a drastic modification, though reversible, of the structural packing within the crystal. In addition, the light&#8208;induced HS state obtained through the Light&#8208;Induced Excited Spin&#8208;State Trapping shows a remarkably high relaxation temperature, namely T( LIESST ), of 109 K, one of the highest so far reported. The above set of quite unusual characteristics opens up new fields of possibilities within the development of spin crossover materials.</dc:description>

Chiral and racemic clusters with [Mn  III  6  Mn  II  Na  I  ], [Mn  III  6  Mn  II  2  Na  I  2  ] and [Mn  III  3  Mn  II  Na  I  ] metallic core have been structurally and magnetically characterized. The racemic clusters with an odd number of chiral ligands exhibit the anomalous mixing of ligands with different conformation. Related racemic compounds have been reviewed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Photoredox&#8208;Catalyzed Addition of Carbamoyl Radicals to Olefins: A 1,4&#8208;Dihydropyridine Approach</title>
      <dc:description>Functionalization with C1&#8208;building blocks are key synthetic methods in organic synthesis. The low reactivity of the most abundant C  1  &#8208;molecule, carbon dioxide, makes alternative carboxylation reactions with CO  2  &#8208;surrogates especially important. We report a photoredox&#8208;catalyzed protocol for alkene carbamoylations. Readily accessible 4&#8208;carboxamido&#8208;Hantzsch esters serve as convenient starting materials that generate carbamoyl radicals upon visible light&#8208;mediated single&#8208;electron transfer. Addition to various alkenes proceeded with high levels of regio&#8208; and chemoselectivity.</dc:description>

      <title>Structural Characterization and Lifetimes of Triple&#8208;Stranded Helical Coinage Metal Complexes: Synthesis, Spectroscopy and Quantum Chemical Calculations</title>
      <dc:description>We report on a series of polynuclear complexes containing a trinuclear Cu, Ag, or Au core in combination with the  fac  &#8208;isomer of the metalloligand [Ru(pypzH)  3  ](PF  6  )  2  (pypzH = 3&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)pyrazole).

In order to obtain a detailed description of the structure both in the electronic ground and excited states, extensive spectroscopic and quantum chemical calculations are applied. The equilateral coinage metal core triangle in the electronic ground state of  2  &#8722;  4  is distorted in the triplet state. Furthermore, the analyses offer a detailed description of electronic excitations. By using time&#8208;resolved IR spectroscopy from the microsecond down to the nanosecond regime, both the vibrational spectra and the lifetime of the lowest lying electronically excited triplet state can be determined. The lifetimes of these almost only non&#8208;radiative triplet states of  2  &#8211;  4  show an unusual effect in a way that the Au&#8208;containing complex  4  has a lifetime which is by more than a factor of five longer than in case of the Cu complex  2  . Thus, the coinage metals have a significant effect on the electronically excited state, which is localized on a pypz ligand coordinated to the Ru atom indicating an unusual cooperative effect between two moieties of the complex.</dc:description>

      <title>Unexpected Vulnerability of DPEphos to C&#8208;O Activation in the Presence of Nucleophilic Metal Hydrides</title>
      <dc:description>C&#8208;O bond activation of DPEphos occurs upon mild heating in the presence of [Ru(NHC) 2 (PPh 3 ) 2 H 2 ] (NHC = N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene) to form phosphinophenolate products. When NHC = IEt 2 Me 2 C&#8208;O activation is accompanied by C&#8208;N activation of an NHC ligand to yield a coordinated N&#8208;phosphino&#8208;functionalised carbene. DFT calculations define a nucleophilic mechanism in which a hydride ligand attacks the aryl carbon of the DPEphos C&#8208;O bond. This is promoted by the strongly donating NHC ligands which render a trans dihydride intermediate featuring highly nucleophilic hydride ligands accessible. C&#8208;O bond activation also occurs upon heating cis &#8208;[Ru(DPEphos) 2 H 2] . DFT calculations suggest this reaction is promoted by the steric encumbrance associated with two bulky DPEphos ligands. Our observations that facile degradation of the DPEphos ligand via C&#8208;O bond activation is possible under relatively mild reaction conditions has potential ramifications for the use of this ligand in high temperature catalysis.</dc:description>

      <title>Fluorescent Metallacycle&#8208;Cored Amphiphilic Nanoparticles Formed by &#946;&#8208;Cyclodextrin&#8208;Based Host&#8208;Guest Interactions towards Cancer Theranostics</title>
      <dc:description>Theranostic agents, taking the advantages of both imaging and therapeutic functions, are expected to develop personalized medicine in which the therapeutic response can be real&#8208;time monitored. Herein, we prepared three metallacycles with pendent adamantane groups via coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly of Pt(II) ligands with anticancer activities and tetraphenylethylene derivatives with emission. &#946;&#8208;Cyclodextrin which shows good host&#8208;guest interactions with adamantane moieties was added to form amphiphilic supramolecular nanoparticles with the aim to enhance the aqueous solubilities and bioactivities of these metallacycles. Moreover, when rhodamine&#8208;modified &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin was used as the carrier, the release of the metallacycles from the nanoparticles could be monitored in situ through the fluorescence changes due to the efficient fluorescence resonance energy transfer from the metallacycles to rhodamine&#8208;modified &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin. In vitro and in vivo studies showed that these nanoparticles not only served as cell imaging contrast agents but also displayed improved anticancer activities, making them serve as potential candidates for cancer theranostics. This study provides a simple and efficient method to prepare theranostic agents via hierarchical supramolecular self&#8208;assembly, which will pave the way for image&#8208;guided cancer therapy, targeted cancer therapy and related biomedical field.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Theranostic agents, taking the advantages of both imaging and therapeutic functions, are expected to develop personalized medicine in which the therapeutic response can be real&#8208;time monitored. Herein, we prepared three metallacycles with pendent adamantane groups via coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly of Pt(II) ligands with anticancer activities and tetraphenylethylene derivatives with emission. &#946;&#8208;Cyclodextrin which shows good host&#8208;guest interactions with adamantane moieties was added to form amphiphilic supramolecular nanoparticles with the aim to enhance the aqueous solubilities and bioactivities of these metallacycles. Moreover, when rhodamine&#8208;modified &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin was used as the carrier, the release of the metallacycles from the nanoparticles could be monitored in situ through the fluorescence changes due to the efficient fluorescence resonance energy transfer from the metallacycles to rhodamine&#8208;modified &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin. In vitro and in vivo studies showed that these nanoparticles not only served as cell imaging contrast agents but also displayed improved anticancer activities, making them serve as potential candidates for cancer theranostics. This study provides a simple and efficient method to prepare theranostic agents via hierarchical supramolecular self&#8208;assembly, which will pave the way for image&#8208;guided cancer therapy, targeted cancer therapy and related biomedical field.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Carbon Monoxide Coupling Reactions: A New Concept for the Formation of Hexahydroxybenzene</title>
      <dc:description>Abstract:  For linear and cyclic coupling reactions of CO among others products the formation of the hexapotassium salt of hexahydroxybenzene is in particular interesting. The interaction of metallic potassium and CO offers  via  the assumed K[OC&#8801;CO]K as the result of several carbon monoxide coupling reactions the formation of C  6  (OK)  6  among other products. Up to now only speculations exist about the reaction pathway for these products which were firstly described by Liebig in 1834. A novel concept is suggested which consists of the single steps (  i  ) reductive coupling of CO, (  ii  ) formation of  dihetero&#8208;  metallacyclopentynes (  cis  &#8208;2,5&#8208;diheterobutatriene as formal ethylenedione O=C=C=O complexes), (  iii  ) formation of its dinuclear 1&#8208;metalla&#8208;2,5&#8208;dioxo&#8208;cyclopentyne complexes by external coordination of the triple bond and (  iv  ) insertion of CO into the M&#8208;C bond of the formed metallacyclopropene and (  v  ) the reductive elimination of C  6  (OK)  6  . The novel aspect of this concept is the formation of  dihetero  &#8208;metallacyclopentynes (in analogy to the well characterized  all  &#8208;C&#8208;metallacyclopentynes) which were never considered in the mechanism of reductive CO coupling reactions. It is expected that the presence of transition metal impurities would promote the reaction.</dc:description>

      <title>Resonance Assisted Hydrogen Bonding Phenomenon Unveiled from Both Experiment and Theory &#8211; an Example of New Family of Ethyl N&#8208;salicylideneglycinate Dyes</title>
      <dc:description>We report extensive experimental and theoretical investigations on the nature of resonance assisted hydrogen bonding phenomenon (RAHB) and its influence on photophysical and thermochromic properties of the newly designed dyes differing in donor&#8208;acceptor properties: ethyl  N  &#8208;salicylideneglycinate (  1  ), ethyl  N  &#8208;(5&#8208;methoxysalicylidene)glycinate (  2  ), ethyl  N  &#8208;(5&#8208;bromosalicylidene)glycinate (  3  ) and ethyl  N  &#8208;(5&#8208;nitrosalicylidene)glycinate (  4  ). It is unveiled, that the magnitude of RAHB effect fine tunes the strength of the O&#8211;H&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;N bonding and accordingly the relative populations of the enol,  cis  &#8208;keto and  trans  &#8208;keto forms leading to variation of the photophysical properties of  1&#8211;4  . It is determined, that the electron&#8208;withdrawing NO  2  in  4  amplifies the most RAHB effect causing the breaking of the O&#8211;H&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;N hydrogen bond and accordingly formation of the dominant  cis  &#8208;keto isomer in both the solid state and EtOH. To this end, the UV&#8208;vis spectra of  1&#8211;3  in EtOH revealed the exclusive presence of the enol form, while the prevalent contribution of the  cis  &#8208;keto form was found for  4  . Furthermore, only compound  4  is emissive in the solid state in ambient condition due to dual emission arising from the  cis  &#8208;keto* and  trans  &#8208;keto* forms, while  2  was found to be highly emissive in EtOH. It is revealed, based on the ETS&#8208;NOCV and EDDB methods, that RAHB is based on electrons pumping or sucking through both the &#960;&#8208; and &#963;&#8208;channels, what accordingly exerts chemical bonding changes at both the phenyl ring and predominantly a distant O&#8211;H&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;N area.</dc:description>

      <title>One Terminal Guanosine Flip of Intramolecular Parallel G&#8208;quadruplex: Catalytic Enhancement of G&#8208;quadruplex/Hemin DNAzymes</title>
      <dc:description>Numerous studies have shown compelling evidences that incorporation of an inversion of polarity site (IPS) in G&#8208;rich sequences can affect the topological and structural characteristics of G&#8208;quadruplexes (G4s). Herein, we explore the influence of IPS on the formation of previously studied intramolecular parallel G4 of d(G3TG3TG3TG3) (TTT) and its stacked higher&#8208;order structures. Insertion of 3'&#8208;3' or 5'&#8208;5' IPS did not change the parallel folding pattern of TTT. However, both the species and position of IPS in TTT have a significant impact on the G4 stability and end&#8208;stacking via the alteration of G4&#8208;G4 interfaces properties. Our data demonstrate that one base flip in each terminal G&#8208;tetrad can stabilize parallel G4s and facilitate intermolecular packing of monomeric G4s. Such modifications can also enhance fluorescence and enzymatic performances by promoting interactions between parallel G4s with N&#8208;methyl mesoporphyrin IX (NMM) and hemin, respectively.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>The fundamental concept of effective molarity is observed in a variety of biological processes such as protein compartmentalization within organelles, membrane localization and signaling paths. To control molecular encountering and promote effective interactions, Nature places biomolecules in specific sites inside the cell in order to generate a high, localized concentration different from the bulk concentration. Inspired by this mechanism, scientists have artificially recreated in the lab the same strategy to actuate and control artificial DNA&#8208;based functional systems.

      <title>Oxidation of cis&#8208;diamminediacetato Pt(II) with hydrogen peroxide can give rise to two isomeric Pt(IV) products</title>

      <title>Solvent&#8208;dependent growth and stabilization mechanisms of surfactant&#8208;free colloidal Pt nanoparticles</title>
      <dc:description>Understanding the formation of nanoparticles (NPs) is key to develop materials via sustainable routes. The Co4Cat TM process is a new synthesis of precious metal NPs in alkaline mono&#8208;alcohols well&#8208;suited to develop active nanocatalysts.

Based on the in situ formation of CO adsorbed on the NP surface by solvent oxidation, a model is proposed that accounts for the different growth and stabilization mechanisms as well as re&#8208;dispersion properties of the surfactant&#8208;free NPs in different solvents. Using in situ and ex situ characterizations, it is established that in methanol, a slow nucleation with a limited NP growth is achieved.

      <title>Transition of 2&#8208;D to 3&#8208;D SBA&#8208;15 by high temperature fluoride addition and its impact on the surface reactivity probed by isopropanol conversion</title>
      <dc:description>We report on a systematic variation of the SBA&#8208;15 synthesis conditions and its impact on the structural and chemical characteristics. An incremental alteration of the hydrothermal aging temperature and time was used to induce first changes of the highly ordered SBA&#8208;15 structure. Any effects on the total surface area, mesopores size, micropore contributions and pore connectivity are amplified by a combined incremental increase of the NH  4  F concentration. Based on changes of the unit cell parameter as a function of the mesopore size, and a feature in the low angle XRD, useful descriptors for the disorder of the corresponding SBA&#8208;15 are identified. An additional analysis of the BET surface area and pore size distributions enables investigations on the structural integrity of the material. Our systematic approach evidences&#160; the identification of coherencies between the evolutions of physical SBA&#8208;15 properties. The obtained correlations of the surface and structural characteristics allow to discriminate between highly ordered 2&#8208;D SBA&#8208;15, disordered 3&#8208;D SBA&#8208;15 and highly nonuniform silica fractions with mainly amorphous character. The fluoride induced disintegration of the silica structure under hydrothermal conditions was also verified by TEM.

      <title>Molecular Bismuth Cations: Assessment of Soft Lewis Acidity</title>
      <dc:description>Three&#8208;coordinate cationic bismuth compounds [Bi(diaryl)(EPMe3)][SbF6] have been isolated and fully characterized (diaryl = [(C6H4)2C2H2]2&#8211;, E = S, Se). They represent rare examples of molecular complexes with Bi&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;EPR3 interactions (R = monoanionic substituent). The 31P NMR chemical shift of EPMe3 has been found to be sensitive to the formation of LA&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;EPMe3 Lewis acid/base interactions (LA = Lewis acid). This corresponds to a modification of the Gutmann&#8208;Beckett method and reveals information about the hardness/softness of the Lewis acid under investigation. A series of organobismuth compounds, bismuth halides, and cationic bismuth species have been investigated with this approach and compared to traditional group 13 and cationic group 14 Lewis acids. Especially cationic bismuth species have been shown to be potent soft Lewis acids that may prefer Lewis pair formation with a soft (S/Se&#8208;based) rather than a hard (O/N&#8208;based) donor. Analytical techniques applied in this work include (heteronuclear) NMR spectroscopy, single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis, and DFT calculations</dc:description>

      <title>Chemical Profiling of A&#8208;to&#8208;I RNA Editing Using a Click&#8208;Compatible Phenylacrylamide</title>
      <dc:description>Straightforward methods for detecting adenosine&#8208;to&#8208;inosine (A&#8208;to&#8208;I) RNA editing are key to better understanding its regulation, function, and connection with disease. We address this need by developing a novel reagent,  N  &#8208;(4&#8208;ethynylphenyl)acrylamide (EPhAA), and illustrating its ability to selectively label inosine in RNA. EPhAA is synthesized in a single step, reacts rapidly with inosine, and is &#8220;click&#8221;&#8208;compatible, enabling flexible attachment of fluorescent probes at editing sites. We first validate EPhAA reactivity and selectivity for inosine in both ribonucleosides and RNA substrates, and then apply our approach to directly monitor  in vitro  A&#8208;to&#8208;I RNA editing activity using recombinant ADAR enzymes. This method improves upon existing inosine chemical labeling techniques and provides a cost&#8208;effective, rapid, and non&#8208;radioactive approach for detecting inosine formation in RNA. We envision this method will improve study of A&#8208;to&#8208;I editing and enable better characterization of RNA modification patterns in different settings.</dc:description>

      <title>Halogen Bonded Assemblies of Arylene&#8208;imides and &#8208;diimides: Insight from Electronic, Structural and Computational studies</title>
      <dc:description>Halogen bonding interactions in electron deficient  &#960;  &#8208;scaffolds has largely been underexplored. Herein, we have studied the halogen bonding properties of arylene&#8208;imide/&#8208;diimide&#8208;based electron deficient scaffolds. We probed the influence of: scaffold size, e.g. from small phthalimide (PTMI), moderately&#8208;sized pyromelliticdiimide (PMDI) or naphthalenediimides (NDIs) to large perylenediimide (PDI); axial&#8208;group modifications; varied number of halogens, etc. on the halogen bonding and its self&#8208;assembly in a set of nine molecules. The structural modification leads to tunable optical as well as redox property. The first reduction potential, E  1  1/2  range between &#8208;1.09 to &#8208;0.17 V (vs SCE). Two of the molecules, e.g.  6  and  9  embrace deep&#8208;lying LUMOs with values reaching &#8208;4.2 eV. Gratifyingly, we realized single crystals of all the nine systems, which revealed Br&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;O, Br&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;Br or Br&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;  &#960;  halogen bonding interactions, with few systems capable of forming all the three&#8208;types. These interactions lead to halogen bonded rings (up to 12&#8208;membered), which propagate to form stacked 1D&#8208;, 2D&#8208; or corrugated sheets. We also identified few outliers, e.g. molecule which prefer C&#8208;H&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;O hydrogen bonding over halogen bonding; or a non&#8208;centrosymmetric organization over the centrosymmetric ones. Computational studies based on Atoms in Molecules (AIM) and Natural Bond Orbital (NBO) analysis provided further insight into the halogen bonding interactions. This study can lead to a predictive design tool&#8208;box to further explore related systems on surfaces reinforced by these weak directional forces.</dc:description>

      <title>Redox&#8208;Active Supramolecular Heteroleptic M4L2L&#8217;2 Assemblies with Tunable Interior Binding Site</title>
      <dc:description>Three  Pt  4  L  2  L&#8217;  2  heteroleptic rectangles (  1  &#8208;  3  ), containing ditopic redox&#8208;active bis&#8208;pyridine functionalized perylene bisimide (PBI) ligands  PBI&#8208;pyr  2  (  L  ) are reported. Co&#8208;ligand  L&#8217;  is a dicarboxylate spacer of varying length, leading to modified overall size of the assemblies.  1  H NMR spectroscopy reveals a trend in the splitting and upfield chemical shift of the PBI&#8208;hydrogens in the rectangles with respect to free PBI, most pronounced with the largest strut length (  3  ) and least with the smallest strut length (  1  ). This is attributed to increased rotational freedom of the  PBI&#8208;pyr  2  ligand over its longitudinal axis (N  py  &#8208;N  py  ), due to increased distance between the PBI&#8208;surfaces, which is corroborated by VT&#8208;NMR measurements and DFT calculations. The intramolecular motion entails desymmetrization of the two PBI&#8208;ligands, in line with cyclic voltammetry (CV) data. The first (overall two&#8208;electron) reduction event and re&#8208;oxidation for  1  display a subtle peak&#8208;to&#8208;peak splitting of 60 mV, whilst increased splitting of this event is observed for  2  and  3  . The binding of pyrene in  1  is probed to establish proof of concept of host&#8208;guest chemistry enabled by the two PBI&#8208;motifs. Fitting the binding curve obtained by  1  H NMR titration with a 1:1 complex formation model led to a binding constant of 964 &#177; 55 M  &#8208;1  .

      <title>Self&#8208;Assembly Propensity Dictates Lifetimes in Transient Naphthalimide&#8208;dipeptide Nanofibers</title>
      <dc:description>We present transient self&#8208;assembly of dipeptide nanofibers with lifetimes that are predictably variable through dipeptide sequence design. This is achieved using 1,8&#8208;Naphthalimide (NI)&#8208; amino acid methyl&#8208;esters (Phe, Tyr, Leu) that are biocatalytically coupled to amino acid&#8208;amides (Phe, Tyr, Leu, Val, Ala, Ser) to form self&#8208;assembling NI&#8208;dipeptides. However, competing hydrolysis of the dipeptides results in disassembly. We demonstrate that the kinetic parameters like lifetimes of these nanofibers can be predictably regulated by the thermodynamic parameter, namely the self&#8208;assembly propensity of the constituent dipeptide sequence. These lifetimes could vary from minutes, to hours, to permanent gels that do not degrade. Moreover, the in&#8208;built NI fluorophore was utilized to image the transient nanostructures in solution with stimulated emission depletion (STED) based on super&#8208;resolution fluorescence microscopy.</dc:description>

      <title>Highly oxidized states of phthalocyaninato terbium(III) multiple&#8208;decker complexes showing structural deformations, biradical properties and decreases in magnetic anisotropy</title>
      <dc:description>Herein we present a comprehensive study of highly oxidized multiple&#8208;decker complexes composed of Tb(III) and Cd(II) ions and two to five phthalocyaninato ligands, which are stabilized by electron&#8208;donating n &#8208;butoxy groups.

In addition, unusual coexistence of square antiprism and square prism geometries around metal ions was observed in +4 e charged species. From paramagnetic 1 H NMR studies on the resulting series of triple, quadruple and quintuple&#8208;decker complexes, ligand oxidation leads to a decrease in the magnetic anisotropy, as predicted from theoretical calculations. Unusual paramagnetic shifts were observed in the spectra of the +2 e charged quadruple and quintuple&#8208;decker complexes, indicating that those two species are actually unexpected triplet biradicals. Magnetic measurements revealed that the series of complexes show single&#8208;molecule magnet properties, which are controlled by the multi&#8208;step redox induced structural changes.</dc:description>

      <title>Thermo&#8208;Sensitive Dual&#8208;Functional Nanospheres with Enhanced Lubrication and Drug Delivery for the Treatment of Osteoarthritis</title>
      <dc:description>Osteoarthritis is a typical degenerative joint disease related with lubrication deficiency of articular cartilage, which is characterized by increased friction at joint surface and severe inflammation of joint capsule. Consequently, a therapy combining lubrication restoration and drug intervention is regarded as a promising strategy for the treatment of osteoarthritis. In the present study, we developed thermo&#8208;sensitive dual&#8208;functional nanospheres, poly[N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide&#8208;2&#8208;methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine] (PNIPAM&#8208;PMPC), via emulsion polymerization. The PNIPAM&#8208;PMPC nanospheres could enhance lubrication based on the hydration lubrication mechanism by forming a tenacious hydration layer surrounding the zwitterionic headgroups, and achieve local drug delivery via encapsulating an anti&#8208;inflammatory drug of diclofenac sodium.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Osteoarthritis is a typical degenerative joint disease related with lubrication deficiency of articular cartilage, which is characterized by increased friction at joint surface and severe inflammation of joint capsule. Consequently, a therapy combining lubrication restoration and drug intervention is regarded as a promising strategy for the treatment of osteoarthritis. In the present study, we developed thermo&#8208;sensitive dual&#8208;functional nanospheres, poly[N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide&#8208;2&#8208;methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine] (PNIPAM&#8208;PMPC), via emulsion polymerization. The PNIPAM&#8208;PMPC nanospheres could enhance lubrication based on the hydration lubrication mechanism by forming a tenacious hydration layer surrounding the zwitterionic headgroups, and achieve local drug delivery via encapsulating an anti&#8208;inflammatory drug of diclofenac sodium. The lubrication and drug release tests showed improved lubrication and thermo&#8208;sensitive drug release of the nanospheres. The  in vitro  test using cytokines&#8208;treated chondrocytes indicated that the PNIPAM&#8208;PMPC nanospheres were biocompatible and upregulated anabolic genes while simultaneously downregulated catabolic genes of the articular cartilage. In summary, the developed PNIPAM&#8208;PMPC nanospheres, with the property of enhanced lubrication and local drug delivery, can be an effective nanomedicine for the treatment of osteoarthritis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of Mitochondria&#8208;Targeted Photosensitizer to Increase Photostability and Photodynamic Therapeutic Efficacy in Hypoxia</title>
      <dc:description>The development of photosensitizers for cancer photodynamic therapy has been challenging due to&#160;their&#160;low photostability and therapeutic inefficacy in hypoxic tumor microenvironments. To overcome these issues, we developed a mitochondria&#8208;targeted photosensitizer consisting of an indocyanine moiety with triphenylphosphonium arms, which can self&#8208;assemble into spherical micelles directed to mitochondria. Self&#8208;assembly of the photosensitizer resulted in a higher photostability by preventing free rotation of the indoline ring of the indocyanine moiety. The mitochondria targeting capability of the photosensitizer allowed it to utilize intramitochondrial oxygen. We found that the mitochondria&#8208;targeted photosensitizer localized to mitochondria and induced apoptosis of cancer cells&#160;both normoxic and hypoxic&#160;conditions through generation of ROS. The micellar self&#8208;assemblies&#160;of the&#160;photosensitizer were further confirmed to selectively localize to tumor tissues in a xenograft tumor mouse model through passive targeting and showed efficient tumor growth inhibition.</dc:description>

      <title>Phase transition and band gap regulated by halogen substitute of organic cation in organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid perovskite semiconductor</title>
      <dc:description>Since the last decade, hybrid materials have received widespread attention. Especially, hybrid lead&#8208;halide perovskite&#8208;type semiconductors are the most attractive due to their great flexibility in band gap engineering. Here, using precise molecular modifications, we designed and obtained three one&#8208;dimensional perovskite&#8208;type semiconductor materials: [Me  3  PCH  2  X][PbBr  3  ] (X=H, F and Cl for compounds  1  ,  2  and  3  , respectively). The introduction of heavier halogen atom (F or Cl) to [Me  4  P]  +  increases the potential energy barrier required for the tumbling motion of the cation, hence achieving the transformation of the phase transition temperature from low temperature (192 K) to room temperature (285 K) and high temperature (402.3 K). Moreover, the optical band gaps reveal a broadening trend with 3.176 eV, 3.215 eV and 3.376 eV along the H&#8594;F&#8594;Cl series, which is attributed to the formation of the structural distortion.</dc:description>

      <title>Atomic&#8208;Scale Description of Interfaces between Antigen and Aluminum&#8208;Based Adjuvants used in Vaccines by DNP Enhanced NMR Spectroscopy</title>
      <dc:description>The addition of aluminum&#8208;based adjuvants in vaccines enhances the immune response to antigens. The strength of antigen adsorption on adjuvant gels is known to modulate vaccine efficacy. However, a detailed understanding of the mechanisms of interaction between Al&#8208; gels and antigens is still missing. Here, we implement a new analytical approach based on Dynamic Nuclear Polarization (DNP) enhanced NMR spectroscopy under Magic Angle Spinning (MAS) to provide a molecular description of antigen&#8208;adjuvant interface. This approach is demonstrated on Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) particles in combination with three Al&#8208;gels obtained from different suppliers. Both non&#8208;covalent and covalent interactions between the phospholipids of the antigen particles and the surface of the Al&#8208;gels are identified by using MAS DNP NMR 27 Al and 31 P correlation experiments. While covalent interactions were detected for only one of the formulations, dipolar recoupling REAPDOR experiments reveal significant differences in the strength of weak interactions.</dc:description>

      <title>Atomic&#8208;Scale Dispersed Fe&#8208;based Catalysts Confined on Nitrogen Doped Graphene for Li&#8208;S Batteries: Polysulfides with Enhanced Conversion Efficiency</title>
      <dc:description>Due to satisfactory theoretical energy density, lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries have been considered as a potential electrochemical energy storage device.  Nonetheless, the inferior conversion efficiency of polysulfides in essence leads to fast capacity decay during discharge&#8208;charge cycle. Herein, we have successfully demonstrated that the conversion efficiency of lithium polysulfides was remarkably enhanced by employing a well&#8208;distributed atomic&#8208;scale Fe&#8208;based catalyst immobilized on nitrogen doped graphene (Fe@NG) as a coating of separator in lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries. Quantitative electrocatalytic efficiency of the conversion of lithium polysulfides was determined via cyclic voltammetry technique. It was also proven that the Fe&#8208;N  X  configuration with highly catalytic activity was quite beneficial to the conversion of lithium polysulfides. In addition, the adsorption and permeation experiment distinctly indicated that the strong anchoring effect, originated from the charge redistribution of N doping into the graphene matrix, inhibited the movement of lithium polysulfides. Thanks to these advantages, when the as&#8208;prepared Fe@NG catalyst was combined with polypropylene and served as a separator (Fe@NG/PP) in Li&#8208;S batteries, it delivered high initial capacity (1616 mAh g  &#8208;1  at 0.1 C), excellent capacity retention (93% at 0.2 C, 70% at 2 C) and superb rate performance (820 mAh g  &#8208;1  at 2 C).</dc:description>

      <title>The Underlying Chemistry to Formation of Phosphoryl Radicals from Organophosphorus Compounds &#8208; A Missing Puzzle Piece in the Flame Chemistry</title>
      <dc:description>Reactive species such as &#8729;PO  2  and HOPO are considered of upmost importance in flame inhibition and catalytic combustion processes of fuels. However, the underlying chemistry of their formation remains speculative due to the unavailability of suitable analytical techniques which can identify the transient species that lead to their formation. This study elucidates the reaction mechanisms of formation of phosphoryl species from dimethyl methyl phosphonate (DMMP) and dimethyl phosphoramidate (DMPR) under well&#8208;defined oxidative conditions. Photoelectron photoion coincidence techniques utilizing vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) synchrotron radiation were applied to isomer&#8208;selectively detect the elusive key intermediates and stable products. With the help of in&#8208;situ recorded spectral fingerprints different transient species, such as PO  2  and triplet O radicals, have been exclusively identified from their isomeric components, which helped piece together the formation mechanisms of phosphoryl species under various conditions. It was found that &#183;PO  2  requires oxidative conditions above 1070 K. The combined presence of O  2  and H  2  led to significant changes in the decomposition chemistry of both model phosphorus compounds leading to the formation of &#183;PO  2  . The reaction &#183;PO + O  2  &#8594; &#183;PO  2  + &#183;O&#183; was identified as the key step in the formation of &#183;PO  2  .

      <title>Flexibility of the CueR Metal Site Probed by Instantaneous Change of Element and Oxidation State from AgI to CdII</title>
      <dc:description>
Relax: AgI activates the transcriptional regulatory protein CueR, while CdII does not activate CueR. In this work the fact that 111Ag decays to 111Cd is exploited, to elucidate the subsequent relaxation at the metal site from transcriptional activator to repressor by PAC spectroscopy. Considerable metal site flexibility is observed, and it is hypothesized that this is relevant to the function of CueR.







Abstract
Selectivity for monovalent metal ions is an important facet of the function of the metalloregulatory protein CueR. 111Ag perturbed angular correlation of &#947;&#8208;rays (PAC) spectroscopy probes the metal site structure and the relaxation accompanying the instantaneous change from AgI to CdII upon 111Ag radioactive decay. That is, a change from AgI, which activates transcription, to CdII, which does not. In the frozen state (&#8722;196&#8201;&#176;C) two nuclear quadrupole interactions (NQIs) are observed; one (NQI1) agrees well with two coordinating thiolates and an additional longer contact to the S77 backbone carbonyl, and the other (NQI2) reflects that CdII has attracted additional ligand(s). At 1&#8201;&#176;C only NQI2 is observed, demonstrating that relaxation to this structure occurs within &#8776;10&#8197;ns of the decay of 111Ag. Thus, transformation from AgI to CdII rapidly disrupts the functional linear bis(thiolato)AgI metal site structure. This inherent metal site flexibility may be central to CueR function, leading to remodelling into a non&#8208;functional structure upon binding of non&#8208;cognate metal ions. In a broader perspective, 111Ag PAC spectroscopy may be applied to probe the flexibility of protein metal sites.

      <title>Kinetics and Mechanism of Cation&#8208;Induced Guest Release from Cucurbit[7]uril</title>
      <dc:description>
Contrasting mechanisms: Stopped&#8208;flow studies on the release of two organic guests from cucurbit[7]uril (CB7) in aqueous solutions of inorganic salts revealed two contrasting mechanisms. Whereas metal cations Mn+ promote the release of berberine (B+) from CB7 in a multistep process, the expulsion of dicationic dye 2,7&#8208;dimethyldiazapyrenium has a simpler mechanism.







Abstract
The release of two organic guests from cucurbit[7]uril (CB7) was selectively monitored by the stopped&#8208;flow method in aqueous solutions of inorganic salts to reveal the mechanistic picture in detail. Two contrasting mechanisms were identified: The symmetric dicationic 2,7&#8208;dimethyldiazapyrenium shows a cation&#8208;independent complex dissociation mechanism coupled to deceleration of the ingression in the presence of alkali and alkaline earth cations (Mn+) due to competitive formation of CB7&#8211;Mn+ complexes. A much richer, unprecedented kinetic behaviour was observed for the ingression and egression of the monocationic and non&#8208;symmetric berberine (B+). The formation of ternary complex B+&#8211;CB7&#8211;Mn+ was unambiguously revealed. A difference of more than two orders of magnitude was found in the equilibrium constants of Mn+ binding to B+&#8211;CB7 inclusion complex. Large cations, such as K+ and Ba2+, also promoted B+ expulsion from the ternary complex in a bimolecular process. This study reveals a previously hidden mechanistic picture and motivates systematic kinetic investigations of other host&#8211;guest systems.

      <title>Synthesis and Characterization of Thiophene&#8208;based Donor&#8211;Acceptor&#8211;Donor Heptameric Ligands for Spectral Assignment of Polymorphic Amyloid&#8208;&#946; Deposits</title>
      <dc:description>
Head or tail: Distinct periodicity of anionic charges along the conjugated backbone is an important chemical determinant for achieving thiophene&#8208;based donor&#8211;acceptor&#8211;donor heptameric ligands for spectral assignment of different amyloid&#8208;&#946; deposits. Having the acetate side chains of the central trimeric thiophene&#8208;BTD&#8208;thiophene unit tail&#8208;to&#8208;tail instead of head&#8208;to&#8208;head greatly reduced the ability of the ligand to distinguish A&#946; morphotypes.







Abstract
Protein deposits are associated with many devastating diseases and fluorescent ligands able to visualize these pathological entities are essential. Here, we report the synthesis of thiophene&#8208;based donor&#8211;acceptor&#8211;donor heptameric ligands that can be utilized for spectral assignment of distinct amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) aggregates, one of the pathological hallmarks in Alzheimer's disease. The ability of the ligands to selectively distinguish A&#946; deposits was abolished when the chemical composition of the ligands was altered. Our findings provide the structural and functional basis for the development of new fluorescent ligands that can distinguish between aggregated proteinaceous species consisting of the same peptide or protein. In addition, such ligands might aid in interpreting the potential role of polymorphic A&#946; deposits in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.

      <title>Surface&#8208;Deactivated Core&#8211;Shell Metal&#8211;Organic Framework by Simple Ligand Exchange for Enhanced Size Discrimination in Aerobic Oxidation of Alcohols</title>
      <dc:description>
Site control: Removing catalytic sites near the surface of the MOF crystal allowed for enhanced size discrimination of the reactants thus improving selectivity.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are an attractive catalyst support for stable immobilization of the active sites in their scaffold due to the high tunability of organic ligands. The active site&#8208;functionalized ligands can be easily employed to construct MOFs as porous heterogeneous catalysts. However, the existence of active sites on the external surfaces as well as internal pores of MOFs seriously impedes the selective reaction in the pore. Herein, through a simple post&#8208;synthetic ligand exchange (PSE) method we synthesized surface&#8208;deactivated (only core&#8208;active) core&#8211;shell&#8208;type MOF catalysts, which contain 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidin&#8208;1&#8208;yl)oxyl (TEMPO) groups on the ligand as active sites for aerobic oxidation of alcohols. The porous but catalytically inactive shell ensured the size&#8208;selective permeability by sieving effects and induced all reactions to take place in the pores of the catalytically active core. Because PSE is a facile and universal approach, this can be rapidly applied to a variety of MOF&#8208;based catalysts for enhancing reaction selectivity.

Abstract
The search for new plasmonic materials that are low&#8208;cost, chemically and thermally stable, and exhibit low optical losses has garnered significant attention among researchers. Recently, metal nitrides have emerged as promising alternatives to conventional, noble&#8208;metal&#8208;based plasmonic materials, such as silver and gold. Many of the initial studies on metal nitrides have focused on computational prediction of the plasmonic properties of these materials. In recent years, several synthetic methods have been developed to enable empirical analysis. This review highlights synthetic techniques for the preparation of plasmonic metal nitride nanoparticles, which are predominantly free&#8208;standing, by using solid&#8208;state and solid&#8211;gas phase reactions, nonthermal and arc plasma methods, and laser ablation. The physical properties of the nanoparticles, such as shape, size, crystallinity, and optical response, obtained with such synthetic methods are also summarized.

      <title>Exchange&#8208;Biasing in a Dinuclear Dysprosium(III) Single&#8208;Molecule Magnet with a Large Energy Barrier for Magnetisation Reversal
</title>
      <dc:description>
Single&#8208;molecule magnet: A dichlorido&#8208;bridged dinuclear dysprosium(III) single&#8208;molecule magnet shows a new record of energy barrier for magnetisation reversal for polynuclear single&#8208;molecule magnets. Moreover, the zero&#8208;field tunnelling effect is suppressed by exchange&#8208;biasing effect arising from magnetic coupling interactions between the DyIII centres.







Abstract
A dichlorido&#8208;bridged dinuclear dysprosium(III) single&#8208;molecule magnet [Dy2L2(&#956;&#8208;Cl)2(thf)2] has been made by using a diamine&#8208;bis(phenolate) ligand, H2L. Magnetic studies show an energy barrier for magnetisation reversal (Ueff) around 1000&#8197;K. An exchange&#8208;biasing effect is clearly seen in magnetic hysteresis with steps up to 3&#8197;K. Ab initio calculations exclude the possibility of a pure dipolar origin of this effect leading to the conclusion that super&#8208;exchange through the chloride bridging ligands is important.

      <title>On the Limited Stability of BDPA Radicals</title>
      <dc:description>
Instability of BDPA radicals: 1,3&#8208;Bis(diphenylene)&#8208;2&#8208;phenylallyl (BDPA) radicals have limited persistence both in solution and in the solid state. Decomposition in the solid state was found to be due to oxidation while dimer formation is a significant pathway of decomposition in solution (see figure).







Abstract
1,3&#8208;Bis(diphenylene)&#8208;2&#8208;phenylallyl (BDPA)&#8208;based radicals are of interest as polarizing agents for dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP). For this purpose, a BDPA&#8208;nitroxide biradical, employing a phosphodiester linkage, was synthesized. Contrary to what is commonly assumed, BDPA&#8208;derived radicals were observed to have limited stability. Hence, the effects of various factors on the stability of BDPA radicals were investigated. Solvent polarity was found to play a significant role on degradation; a polar BDPA radical was observed to degrade faster in a non&#8208;polar solvent, whereas non&#8208;polar radicals were more unstable in polar solvents. The rate of decomposition was found to increase non&#8208;linearly with increasing radical concentration; a 2&#8208;fold increase in concentration led to a 3&#8208;fold increase in the rate of degradation. Collectively, these results indicate that the dimerization is a significant degradation pathway for BDPA radicals and indeed, a dimer of one BDPA radical was detected by mass spectrometry.

      <title>Enhanced Electrosynthetic Hydrogen Evolution by Hydrogenases Embedded in a Redox&#8208;Active Hydrogel</title>
      <dc:description>
The redox polymer cobaltocene&#8208;functionalized polyallylamine (Cc&#8208;PAA) was utilized to immobilize hydrogenase enzyme on an electrode surface and mediate electron transfer for hydrogen evolution. Cc&#8208;PAA has been found to effectively mediate electron transfer between an electrode and hydrogenases at high specificity and efficiency.







Abstract
Molecular hydrogen is a major high&#8208;energy carrier for future energy technologies, if produced from renewable electrical energy. Hydrogenase enzymes offer a pathway for bioelectrochemically producing hydrogen that is advantageous over traditional platforms for hydrogen production because of low overpotentials and ambient operating temperature and pressure. However, electron delivery from the electrode surface to the enzyme's active site is often rate&#8208;limiting. Here, it is shown that three different hydrogenases from Clostridium pasteurianum and Methanococcus maripaludis, when immobilized at a cathode in a cobaltocene&#8208;functionalized polyallylamine (Cc&#8208;PAA) redox polymer, mediate rapid and efficient hydrogen evolution. Furthermore, it is shown that Cc&#8208;PAA&#8208;mediated hydrogenases can operate at high faradaic efficiency (80&#8211;100&#8201;%) and low apparent overpotential (&#8722;0.578 to &#8722;0.593&#8197;V vs. SHE). Specific activities of these hydrogenases in the electrosynthetic Cc&#8208;PAA assay were comparable to their respective activities in traditional methyl viologen assays, indicating that Cc&#8208;PAA mediates electron transfer at high rates, to most of the embedded enzymes.

      <title>The Development of Vanadyl Phosphate Cathode Materials for Energy Storage Systems: A Review</title>
      <dc:description>
VOPO4 cathodes: Vanadyl phosphate shows great promise as a cathode material for rechargeable batteries and supercapacitors. The electrochemical performance is closely related to the structures of VOPO4 and types of inserted cations. This review presents the polymorphs of vanadyl phosphate materials, their charge storage behaviors, and the related mechanism investigations.







Abstract
Various cathode materials have been proposed for high&#8208;performance rechargeable batteries. Vanadyl phosphate is an important member of the polyanion cathode family. VOPO4 has seven known crystal polymorphs with tunneled or layered frameworks, which allow facile cation (de)intercalations. Two&#8208;electron transfer per formula unit can be realized by using VV/VIV and VIV/VIII redox couples. The electrochemical performance is closely related to the structures of VOPO4 and the types of inserted cations. This Review outlines the crystal structures of VOPO4 polymorphs and their lithiated phases. The research progress of vanadyl phosphate cathode materials for different energy storage systems, including lithium&#8208;ion batteries, sodium&#8208;ion batteries, potassium&#8208;ion batteries, multivalent batteries, and supercapacitors, as well as the related mechanism investigations are summarized. It is hoped that this Review will help with future directions of using vanadyl phosphate materials for energy storage.

The electrochemical performance is closely related to the structures of VOPO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and the types of inserted cations. This Review outlines the crystal structures of VOPO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; polymorphs and their lithiated phases. The research progress of vanadyl phosphate cathode materials for different energy storage systems, including lithium&#8208;ion batteries, sodium&#8208;ion batteries, potassium&#8208;ion batteries, multivalent batteries, and supercapacitors, as well as the related mechanism investigations are summarized. It is hoped that this Review will help with future directions of using vanadyl phosphate materials for energy storage.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Synthesis and Assembly of Zinc Oxide Microcrystals by a Low&#8208;Temperature Dissolution&#8211;Reprecipitation Process: Lessons Learned About Twin Formation in Heterogeneous Reactions</title>
      <dc:description>
Conversion of cobalt&#8208;doped layered zinc acetate into zinc oxide: Twinning is an often&#8208;observed process during crystallization or mineralization of ZnO. However, if minor Co doping of a precursor is allowed, a twin free formation of highly regular hexagonal platelets of ZnO microcrystals displaying piezoelectric behavior is observed. Tessellation of these crystals by the Langmuir&#8211;Blodgett technique using n&#8208;butanol is possible, albeit only over small areas, if the surface is covered with a polyelectrolyte prior to deposition. This accounts for a subtle charge&#8208;mediated orientation of these crystals on the substrate. More information can be found in the Full Paper by J.&#8197;J. Schneider et&#8197;al.

      <title>Tetrathiafulvalene&#8208;Fused Heterabuckybowl: Protonation&#8208;Induced Electron Transfer and Self&#8208;Sensitized Photooxidation</title>
      <dc:description>
Double donors: Heterabuckybowl trichalcogenasumanene (D1) and tetrathiafulvalene (D2) electron&#8208;donating moieties are fused together through a pyrazine electron&#8208;accepting unit (A) to give a D1&#8211;A&#8211;D2 type fused &#960;&#8208;system. This system shows interesting transient&#8208;state dynamics owing to the electronic interplay between D1 and D2, and exhibits protonation&#8208;induced electron transfer and self&#8208;sensitized photooxidation behavior that can be spectroscopically observed.







Abstract
The electron donor tetrathiafulvalene (D1) was fused onto the electron&#8208;rich heterabuckybowl trichalcogenasumanene (D2) through an electron&#8208;deficient pyrazine unit (A) to give 1&#8201;c, 1&#8201;d, 2&#8201;c, and 2&#8201;d, featuring the D1&#8211;A&#8211;D2 structure. Both D1 and D2 play a pivotal role in intramolecular charge&#8208;transfer (ICT) transitions, consequently 1&#8201;c, 2&#8201;d, 2&#8201;c, and 2&#8201;d show a broad ICT band at 450&#8211;720&#8197;nm in steady state. They exhibit two charge&#8208;separated transient states, CS1 and CS2, that appear in sequence. CS1 has a short lifetime (542&#8197;fs), and the D1 moiety on CS1 is in the radical cation state with an absorption maximum (&#955;max) at 889&#8197;nm. CS1 then converts into CS2 (&#955;max, 1105&#8197;nm) through an ICT between D1.+ and D2, affording D1(1&#8722;&#948;).+ and D2&#948;.+. Compounds 1&#8201;c, 1&#8201;d, 2&#8201;c, and 2&#8201;d show protonation&#8208;induced intramolecular electron transfer that leads to absorption at &#955;=700&#8211;1300&#8197;nm. Owing to the existence of an electron&#8208;rich C=C bond on the D1 moiety and in situ generation of 1O2 by the pyrazine&#8208;fused D2 moiety, compounds 1&#8201;c, 1&#8201;d, 2&#8201;c, and 2&#8201;d display self&#8208;sensitized photooxidation in 50&#8197;s.

      <title>Diphenylberyllium Reinvestigated: Structure, Properties, and Reactivity of BePh2, [(12&#8208;crown&#8208;4)BePh]+, and [BePh3]&#8722;</title>
      <dc:description>
Finally, the structure of diphenylberyllium has been determined and its reactivity explored. BePh2 acts as a Lewis acid but with unexpectedly low ether&#8208;affinity. Several triphenylberyllates were characterized, of which one originates from the selfionization of BePh2. The generated phenylberyllium cation exhibits an unusual 4+1 coordination and all compounds are stable in chlorinated solvents (see scheme). These findings enabled a classification of organoberyllium compounds in comparison to the other (pseudo)main group organyles.







Abstract
The first synthesis of BePh2 was accomplished almost a century ago. However, its structure has remained unknown so far, while the corresponding aryls of the elements adjacent to beryllium in the periodic table are well investigated. Herein, we present an improved synthesis for diphenylberyllium and show by X&#8208;ray diffraction that it forms a trinuclear complex in the solid state. NMR spectroscopy revealed that this structure is also retained in solution but exhibits dynamic behavior. Its stability against heat and coordinating solvents is discussed and the possible obstacles to the synthesis of BePh2 from BeCl2 are examined. In the process of this study two ether adducts, BePh2&#8901;Et2O and Be2Ph4&#8901;Et2O, have been characterized as well as the previously unknown triphenylberyllate anion. From the latter several single&#8208;crystal structures were obtained under various conditions, in which [BePh3]&#8722; is either isolated or acts as a ligand for Li+. Furthermore, the crown ether induced selfionization of BePh2 is described and the resulting [(12&#8208;crown&#8208;4)BePh]+ cation was isolated, which shows an unusual 4+1 coordination around the Be atom.

      <title>Recent Advances in One&#8208;Electron&#8208;Oxidized CuII&#8211;Diphenoxide Complexes as Models of Galactose Oxidase: Importance of the Structural Flexibility in the Active Site</title>
      <dc:description>
Galactose oxidase (GO) has been widely investigated in terms of biological and model complex studies, due to the unique oxidation state of the CuII&#8211;phenoxyl radical. Although properties and reactivities of the CuII&#8211;phenoxyl radical have been clarified, details of the roles of the other structural factors in the active site of GO are still unclear. Recent progress of model studies on GO is reviewed, focusing on some new aspects of structural factors.







Abstract
The phenoxyl radical plays important roles in biological systems as cofactors in some metalloenzymes, such as galactose oxidase (GO) catalyzing oxidation of primary alcohols to give the corresponding aldehydes. Many metal(II)&#8211;phenoxyl radical complexes have hitherto been studied for understanding the detailed properties and reactivities of GO, and thus the nature of GO has gradually become clearer. However, the effects of the subtle geometric and electronic structural changes at the active site of GO, especially the structural change in the catalytic cycle and the effect of the second coordination sphere, have not been fully discussed yet. In this Review, we focus on further details of the model studies of GO and discuss the importance of the structural change at the active site of GO.

Ir&#8208;catalyzed selective alkenylation of cage B(3,6)&#8722;H bonds in o&#8208;carboranes has been achieved for the controlled synthesis of 3,6&#8208;trans&#8208;, 3&#8208;cis&#8208;, and 3&#8208;cis&#8208;6&#8208;trans&#8208;alkenylated o&#8208;carboranes in high yields with excellent regio and very good cis&#8208;trans selectivity. Regioselectivity results from the differences in vertex electron density in o&#8208;carborane, while the configuration of the resultant olefinic units is dominated by the nature of alkyne substituents. Alkyl groups lead to trans&#8208;configuration, whereas bulky aryl substitutions result in cis&#8208;configuration. More information can be found in the Full Paper by R. Cheng, Z. Qiu, and Z. Xie.

      <title>Aqueous Chemical Solution Deposition of Functional Double Perovskite Epitaxial Thin Films</title>
      <dc:description>
Slow films: The use of polymers to control the growth of ceramic thin films can make it easier to produce materials for spintronic applications, which use electron spin instead of charge to carry information. Water&#8208;soluble polymers bind to metal cations and slow down crystallization rates so that the most thermodynamically favored double perovskite structure films, with an optimal orientation and high magnetism for device applications, are formed.







Abstract
Double perovskite structure (A2BB&#8242;O6) oxides exhibit a breadth of multifunctional properties with a huge potential range of applications in fields as diverse as spintronics, magneto&#8208;optic devices, or catalysis, and most of these applications require the use of thin films and heterostructures. Chemical solution deposition techniques are appearing as a very promising methodology to achieve epitaxial oxide thin films combining high performance with high throughput and low cost. In addition, the physical properties of these materials are strongly dependent on the ordered arrangement of cations in the double perovskite structure. Thus, promoting spontaneous cationic ordering has become a relevant issue. In this work, our recent achievements by using polymer&#8208;assisted deposition (PAD) of environmentally friendly, water&#8208;based solutions for the growth of epitaxial ferromagnetic insulating double perovskite La2CoMnO6 and La2NiMnO6 thin films on SrTiO3 and LaAlO3 single&#8208;crystal substrates are presented. It is shown that the particular crystallization and growth process conditions of PAD (very slow rate, close to thermodynamic equilibrium conditions) promote high crystallinity and quality of the films, as well as favors spontaneous B&#8208;site cationic ordering.

      <title>Structure&#8208;Guided Design of a Group&#8197;B Streptococcus Type&#8197;III Synthetic Glycan&#8211;Conjugate Vaccine</title>
      <dc:description>
Group B Streptococcus III has been considered a model of highly complex glycan epitope. Based on the X&#8208;ray crystallographic structure of a polysaccharide fragment&#8208;mAb complex, a hexasaccharide was synthesized comprising the positions involved in binding. After conjugation to a carrier protein and in vivo testing, the oligosaccharide was as efficacious as the natural polysaccharide in inducing protective antibodies. This study underlines the role of structural glycobiology in simplifying the design of vaccines based on complex bacterial polysaccharides. More information can be found in the Full Paper by R. Adamo et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202000284).
