      <title>A pH&#8208;Induced, Reversible Conformational Switch able to control the Photocurrent Efficiency in a Peptide Supramolecular System</title>
      <dc:description>External stimuli are potent tools that Nature uses to control protein function and activity. For instance, during viral entry and exit, pH variations are known to trigger large protein conformational changes. In Nature, also the electron transfer (ET) properties of ET proteins are influenced by pH&#8208;induced conformational changes. In this work, a pH&#8208;controlled, reversible 3  10  &#8208;helix to &#945;&#8208;helix conversion (from acidic to highly basic pH values and  vice versa  ) of a peptide supramolecular system built on a gold surface is described. The effect of pH on the ability of the peptide SAM to generate a photocurrent was investigated, with particular focus on the effect of the pH&#8208;induced conformational change on photocurrent efficiency. The films were characterized by electrochemical and spectroscopic techniques, and were found to be very stable over time, also in contact with a solution. They were also able to generate current under illumination, with an efficiency that is the highest recorded so far with biomolecular systems.</dc:description>

      <title>Utility of Core&#8211;Shell Nanomaterials in the Catalytic Transformations of Renewable Substrates</title>
      <dc:description>
Catalyst in a shell: This concept article describes state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art core&#8211;shell materials employed as heterogeneous catalysts for a range of sustainable catalytic transformations, focusing on the advantages that this intriguing class of catalysts brings to the field.







Abstract
In recent years, core&#8211;shell nano&#8208;catalysts have received increasing attention due to their tunable properties and broad applications in catalysis. Control of the two components of these materials allows their catalytic properties to be tuned to various sustainable processes in synthetic and energy&#8208;related applications. This Concept article describes recent state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art core&#8211;shell materials and their application as heterogeneous catalysts for a range of sustainable catalytic transformations, focusing on two important classes of renewable substrates, CO2 and biomass. In the discussion, emphasis is directed to the role of the constituent parts of the core&#8211;shell structure and how they can be manipulated to enhance activity.

      <title>Total Synthesis of a Partial Structure from Arabinogalactan and Its Application for Allergy Prevention</title>
      <dc:description>
Growing up in an alpine farming environment with frequent contact to cowsheds is protective against allergic diseases. Arabinogalactan from this environment is one of the protective compounds. The source of this polysaccharide was traced back to grasses such as Alopecurus pratensis. This study shows that the total synthesis of arabinose and galactose containing partial structures from such arabinogalactan is possible. After coupling of these pentasaccharides to a carrier protein, the glycoconjugates protect against allergic response in a mouse model asthma. More information can be found in the Communication by T. Opatz, M. Peters, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202002287).

      <title>One&#8208;Photon Excitation Followed by a Three&#8208;Step Sequential Energy&#8208;Energy&#8208;Electron Transfer Leading To a&#160;Charge Separation in Supramolecular Tetrad Benzothiazole&#8208;Boron Dipyrromethene&#8208;Zinc Porphyrin&#8208;C60</title>
      <dc:description>A panchromatic triad, consisting of benzothiazole (BTZ), boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY) moieties covalently linked to zinc porphyrin (ZnP) core is reported. Absorption and electrochemical studies of BTZ&#8208;BODIPY&#8208;ZnP revealed characteristic peaks corresponding to individual chromophores. Selective excitation of BTZ moiety resulted in the fluorescence quenching, due to PEnT from 1BTZ* to BODIPY moiety, followed by the quenching of the BODIPY emission due to sequential PEnT from 1BODIPY* moiety to ZnP. Further, supramolecular tetrad was formed by axially coordinating triad with ImC60, and the parallel steady&#8208;state measurements revealed diminished ZnP emission indicating the occurrence of PET from 1ZnP* to ImC60. Finally, femtosecond transient absorption studies provided evidence for the sequential occurrence of PEnT and PET events, viz., 1BTZ*&#8208;BODIPY&#8208;ZnP:ImC60 &#224; BTZ&#8208;1BODIPY*&#8208;ZnP:ImC60 &#224; BTZ&#8208;BODIPY&#8208;1ZnP*:ImC60 &#224; BTZ&#8208;BODIPY&#8208;ZnP+&#9642;:ImC60&#8722;&#9642; in the supramolecular tetrad. The evaluated rate of energy transfer, kEnT was found to be 3&#8208;5 &#215; 1010 s&#8208;1, slightly faster than that observed in the case of BODIPY&#8208;ZnP and BTZ&#8208;BODIPY&#8208;ZnP lacking the coordinated ImC60. The rate constants for charge separation and recombination, kCS and kCR, calculated by monitoring the rise and decay of the C60&#8722;&#9642; were found to be 5.5 &#215; 1010 s&#8208;1 and 4.4 &#215; 108 s&#8208;1 for BODIPY&#8208;ZnP:ImC60 triad, and 3.1 &#215; 1010 s&#8208;1 and 4.9 &#215; 108 s&#8208;1 for BTZ&#8208;BODIPY&#8208;ZnP:ImC60 tetrad. Initial excitation of tetrad promoting two&#8208;step energy transfer and a final electron transfer event has been successfully demonstrated in the present study.</dc:description>

      <title>Plasma&#8208;induced defects enhance the visible&#8208;light photocatalytic activity of MIL&#8208;125(Ti)&#8208;NH2 for overall water splitting</title>
      <dc:description>Defect engineering in metal&#8208;organic frameworks is commonly performed by using thermal or chemical treatments. Herein, it is reported that oxygen plasma treatment generates structural defects on MIL&#8208;125(Ti)&#8208;NH  2  leading to an increase of its photocatalytic activity. Characterization data indicates that plasma&#8208;treated materials retain most of their initial crystallinity, while exhibiting somewhat lower surface area and pore volume. XPS and FT&#8208;IR spectroscopy reveal that oxygen plasma induces MIL&#8208;125(Ti)&#8208;NH  2  partial terephthalate decarboxylation and an increase of the Ti&#8208;OH population.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Defect engineering in metal&#8208;organic frameworks is commonly performed by using thermal or chemical treatments. Herein, it is reported that oxygen plasma treatment generates structural defects on MIL&#8208;125(Ti)&#8208;NH  2  leading to an increase of its photocatalytic activity. Characterization data indicates that plasma&#8208;treated materials retain most of their initial crystallinity, while exhibiting somewhat lower surface area and pore volume. XPS and FT&#8208;IR spectroscopy reveal that oxygen plasma induces MIL&#8208;125(Ti)&#8208;NH  2  partial terephthalate decarboxylation and an increase of the Ti&#8208;OH population. Thermogravimetric analyses confirm the generation of structural defects by oxygen plasma and allowed an estimation of the resulting experimental formula of the treated MIL&#8208;125(Ti)&#8208;NH  2  solids. SEM analyses show that the oxygen plasma treatment of MIL&#8208;125(Ti)&#8208;NH  2  gradually decreases its particle size.

      <dc:description>Capping ligands are indispensable for the preparation of metal&#8208;halide&#8208;perovskite (MHP) nanocrystals (NCs) with good stability; however, the long alkyl&#8208;chain capping ligands in conventional MHP NCs will be unfavourable for the CO2 adsorption and hinder the efficient carrier separation on the surface of MHP NCs, leading to inferior catalytic activity in artificial photosynthesis. Herein, we construct CsPbBr3 nanocrystals with short&#8208;chain glycine as ligand based on a facile ligand&#8208;exchange strategy. Owing to the reduced hindrance of glycine and the presence of amine group in glycine, the photogenerated carrier separation and CO2 uptake capacity can be noticeably improved without compromising stability of MHP NCs. CsPbBr3 nanocrystals with glycine ligands exhibit significantly increased yield of 27.7 &#956;mol g&#8210;1 h&#8210;1 for photocatalytic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion without any organic sacrificial reagents, which is over 5 times higher than that of control CsPbBr3 NCs with conventional long alkyl&#8208;chain capping ligands.</dc:description>

      <title>Assessing the key photophysical properties of triangulenium dyes for DNA binding by alteration of the fluorescent core</title>
      <dc:description>Four&#8208;stranded G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) DNA is a non&#8208;canonical DNA topology that has been proposed to form in cells and play key roles in how the genome is read and used by the cellular machinery. Previously, a fluorescent triangulenium probe (DAOTA&#8208;M2) was used to visualise G4s in cellulo, thanks to its distinct fluorescence lifetimes when bound to different DNA topologies. Herein, we expand the library of available triangulenium probes to explore how modifications to the fluorescent core of the molecule affect its photophysical characteristics, interaction with DNA and cellular localisation. The benzo&#8208;bridged and isopropyl&#8208;bridged diazatriangulenium dyes, BDATA&#8208;M2 and CDATA&#8208;M2 respectively, featuring ethyl&#8208;morpholino substituents, were synthesised and characterised. The interactions of these molecules with different DNA topologies were studied to determine their binding affinity, fluorescence enhancement and fluorescence lifetime response. Finally, the cellular uptake and localisation of these optical probes were investigated. Whilst structural modifications to the triangulenium core only slightly alter the binding affinity to DNA, BDATA&#8208;M2 and CDATA&#8208;M2 cannot distinguish between DNA topologies through their fluorescence lifetime. This work presents valuable new evidence into the critical role of PET quenching when using the fluorescence lifetime of triangulenium dyes to discriminate G4 DNA from duplex DNA, highlighting the importance of fine tuning redox and spectral properties when developing new triangulenium&#8208;based G4 probes.</dc:description>

      <title>Synthesis and coordination ability of a donor&#8208;stabilised bis&#8208;phosphinidene</title>
      <dc:description>Chelating phosphines have long been a mainstay as efficient directing ligands in transition&#8208;metal catalysis. Low&#8208;valent derivatives, namely chelating phosphinidenes, are to date unknown, and could lead to chelating complexes containing more than one metal centre due to the intrisic capacity of phosphinidenes to bind two metal fragments at one P&#8208;centre. Here we describe the synthesis of the first such chelating bis&#8208;phosphinidene ligand, XantP  2  (  2  ), generated by the reduction of a diphosphino xanthene derivative, Xant(PH  2  )  2  (  1  ) with  iPr  NHC (  iPr  NHC = [:C{N(Pr  i  )C(H)}  2  ]). Initial studies have shown that this novel chelating ligand can act as a bidentate ligand towards element dihalides (  i.e.  FeCl  2  , ZnI  2  , GeCl  2  , SnBr  2  ), forming cationic complexes with the tetryl elements. In contrast, XantP  2  demonstrates an ability to bind multiple metal centres in the reaction with CuCl, leading to a cationic Cu  3  P  3  ring complex, with Cu centres bridged by phosphinidene arms. Density Functional Theory calculations show that  2  indeed holds 4 lone pairs of electrons, shedding further light on the coordination capacity for this novel ligand class through observation of directionality and hybridisation of these electron pairs.</dc:description>

      <title>Planar Tetracoordinate Silicons in Organic Molecules As Carbenoid&#8208;Type Amphoteric Centers: A Computational Study</title>
      <dc:description>Designing and synthesizing a stable compound with a planar tetracoordinate silicon (ptSi) center is a challenging goal for chemists. Here, we theoretically designed and computationally verified a series of potential aromatic ptSi compounds composed of four conjugated rings shared by a centrally embedded Si atom. Both Born&#8208;Oppenheimer molecular dynamics (BOMD) simulations and computations of decomposition pathways indicate the high stability and likely existence of these compounds particularly Si&#8208;5555 (SiN  4  C  8  H  8  ) with 16 &#960; electrons under normal temperature and pressure. Notably, the H&#252;ckel aromaticity rule which works well for single rings seems inconsistent with the high stability of Si&#8208;5555 where the 16 &#960; electrons are spread over four rings fused together. Bonding analyses show that the strong electron donation from the peripheral conjugated ring of 16 &#960; electrons to the vacant central atomic orbital Si 3p  z  leads to the stabilization for both the ptSi coordination and planar aromaticity. The partial occupation of Si 3p  z  results in the peculiar  carbenoid&#8208;type  behaviors of the amphoteric center.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Designing and synthesizing a stable compound with a planar tetracoordinate silicon (ptSi) center is a challenging goal for chemists. Here, we theoretically designed and computationally verified a series of potential aromatic ptSi compounds composed of four conjugated rings shared by a centrally embedded Si atom. Both Born&#8208;Oppenheimer molecular dynamics (BOMD) simulations and computations of decomposition pathways indicate the high stability and likely existence of these compounds particularly Si&#8208;5555 (SiN  4  C  8  H  8  ) with 16 &#960; electrons under normal temperature and pressure. Notably, the H&#252;ckel aromaticity rule which works well for single rings seems inconsistent with the high stability of Si&#8208;5555 where the 16 &#960; electrons are spread over four rings fused together. Bonding analyses show that the strong electron donation from the peripheral conjugated ring of 16 &#960; electrons to the vacant central atomic orbital Si 3p  z  leads to the stabilization for both the ptSi coordination and planar aromaticity. The partial occupation of Si 3p  z  results in the peculiar  carbenoid&#8208;type  behaviors of the amphoteric center. By modulating the electron density on the ring with substituent groups, we can regulate the nucleophilic and electrophilic properties of the central Si.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Rational design and controlled synthesis of V doped Ni3S2/NixPy heterostructure nanosheets for hydrogen evolution reaction</title>
      <dc:description>Rational construction of high&#8208;efficient and low&#8208;cost catalyst is one of the most promising ways to produce liberally hydrogen but almost remains a huge dare. Hence, a novel work by the interface engineering and hetero&#8208;atom doping to synthesize V doped sulfide/phosphide heterostructure grown on nickel foam (V&#8208;Ni  3  S  2  /Ni  x  P  y  /NF) is proposed via a phosphating treatment at low temperature. The incorporation of V can adjust the electronic structures of Ni  3  S  2  , optimize electronic transmission, expose more active sites and protect the 3D structure of Ni foam. Meanwhile, the excellent conductivity of NF and the abundant interstices between nanosheets have a positive effort for HER. As a result, the V&#8208;Ni  3  S  2  /Ni  x  P  y  /NF (VNSP/NF) nanosheets catalyst exhibits the outstanding HER activity with an extremely low overpotential of 90 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm  &#8722;2  for HER and stable durability in alkaline solution, which exceeds most of the previously reported about Ni&#8208;based materials. This work proves the rational design of the interfacial engineering and metal atom incorporation have a significant influence for efficient hydrogen evolution.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>High&#8208;pressure behavior of hexamethylenetetramine (urotropine) was studied  in situ  using angle&#8208;dispersive single&#8208;crystal synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier transform infrared absorption (FTIR) spectroscopy. Experiments were conducted in various pressure transmitting media to study the effect of deviatoric stress on phase transformations. Up to 4 GPa significant damping of molecular librations and atomic thermal motion was observed.

However, it occurs only in non&#8208;hydrostatic conditions, induced by deviatoric or uniaxial stress in the sample. This behavior finds analogies in similar cubic crystals built of highly symmetric cage&#8208;like molecules and may be considered a common feature of such systems.

      <title>Synthesis of asparagine derivatives harboring a Lewis X type DC&#8208;SIGN ligand and evaluation of their impact on immunomodulation in multiple sclerosis</title>
      <dc:description>The protein myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) is a key component of myelin and an autoantigen in the disease multiple sclerosis (MS). The posttranslational N&#8208;glycosylation of Asn31 of MOG seems to play a key role in modulating the immune response towards myelin. This is mediated by the interaction of Lewis type glycan structures on the N&#8208;glycan of MOG to the DC&#8208;SIGN receptor on dendritic cells (DCs). Here, we report the synthesis of an unnatural Lewis X (LeX) containing Fmoc&#8208;SPPS compatible asparagine building block, as well as asparagine building blocks containing two LeX derived oligosaccharides: LacNAc and Fuc&#945;1&#8208;3GlcNAc. These building blocks were utilized for the synthesis of glycosylated MOG (MOG31&#8208;55) and were analyzed with respect to their ability to bind to DC&#8208;SIGN in different biological setups, as well as their ability to inhibit the citrullination induced aggregation of MOG31&#8208;55.

      <title>A straightforward synthesis of polyketides via ester dienolate Matteson homologation</title>
      <dc:description>Application of ester dienolates as nucleophiles in Matteson homologations allows the stereoselective synthesis of highly substituted &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated &#948;&#8208;hydroxy carboxyl acids, structural motifs widespread found in polyketide natural products. The protocol is rather flexible and permits the introduction of substituents and functionalities also at those positions which are not accessible by the commonly used aldol reaction. Therefore, this ester dienolate Matteson approach is an intersting alternative to the &#8220;classical&#8221; polyketide syntheses.</dc:description>

      <title>Cyclodextrin&#8208;Based [c2]Daisy Chain Rotaxane Insulating Two Diarylacetylene Cores</title>
      <dc:description>A [c2]daisy chain rotaxane with two diarylacetylene cores was efficiently synthesized in 53% yield by capping a C2&#8208;symmetric pseudo[2]rotaxane composed of two diarylacetylene&#8208;substituted permethylated &#945;&#8208;cyclodextrins (PM &#945;&#8208;CDs) with aniline stoppers. The maximum absorption wavelength of the [c2]daisy chain rotaxane remained almost unchanged in various solvents, unlike that of the stoppered monomer, indicating that the two independent diarylacetylene cores were insulated from the external environment by the PM &#945;&#8208;CDs. Furthermore, the [c2]daisy chain rotaxane exhibited fluorescence emission derived from both diarylacetylene monomers and excimers, which implies that the [c2]daisy chain structure can undergo contraction and extension. This is the first demonstration of a system in which excimer formation between two &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules within an isolated space can be controlled by the unique motion of a [c2]daisy chain rotaxane.</dc:description>

      <title>Aromaticity Survival in Hydrofullerenes: The Case of C66H4 with its &#960;&#8208;Aromatic Circuits</title>
      <dc:description>The isolated&#8208;pentagon rule (IPR) is a determining structural feature accounting for hollow fullerene stabilization and properties related to Cn (n &#8805; 60) cages. The recent characterization of an unprecedented non&#8208;IPR hydrofullerene, C2v&#8208;C66H4, bearing two heptagons with adjacent fused&#8208;pentagons motif, largely dismiss this feature. Herein, employing DFT calculations, we explore the 13C&#8208;NMR pattern and aromatic behavior of C2v&#8208;C66H4. Our results show the presence of three &#960;&#8208;aromatic circuits at the bottom boat section of C66H4 indicating the unique features of this hydrofullerene in comparison to pristine C60. In addition, under specific orientations of the external field, certain &#960;&#8208;aromatic circuits are enabled, resulting in a more aromatic fullerene than C60, but lower in comparison to the spherical aromatic C606&#8208; fulleride. Noteworthy, under a field&#8208;aligned along with the saturated carbon atoms, non&#8208;aromatic characteristics are exposed. This reveals that spherical&#8208;like cages can involve a complex magnetic response that heavily depends on the orientation of the applied field.</dc:description>

Make it switch: By combining the versatile electrochemical behavior of cobalt&#8208;based metallacarboranes with the excellent emission properties of perylenediimides, new fluorescent molecular switches were prepared that respond to redox stimuli. These systems not only surpass the performance of previous switches based on other metal complexes, but also allow the preparation of supramolecular fluorescent gels by taking advantage of the self&#8208;assembly capabilities of their constituting units.

      <title>Attempts to Synthesize a Thiirane, Selenirane, and Thiirene by Dealkylation of Chalcogeniranium and Thiirenium Salts</title>
      <dc:description>
The Apollonian spirit of art and knowledge flows over the ancient house on Delos. However, even these forces cannot bridge the difference in reactivity: Thiiranium ions [Ad2SCH2CH2SiMe3]+ are fragmented by the fluoride ion to form thiirane Ad2S, Me3SiF, and C2H4 through attack on Si. In the case of seleniranium ions [Ad2SeCH2CH2SiMe3]+, the attack of the fluoride ion takes place on the Se and the three&#8208;membered ring is cleaved. Reaction products are the alkene Ad=Ad and the unstable selenenyl fluoride Me3SiCH2CH2SeF, but no selenirane Ad2Se are formed. We thank Harald Hirsch, Potsdam, for his help with the picture design. More information can be found in the Full Paper by H. Poleschner and K. Seppelt. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202003461).

A facile way of accessing the second lone pair of carbodicarbene through &#8220;turn off&#8221; of the &#960;&#8208;accepting ability of the flanking NHC is reported. The formation of gem&#8208;double dative bimetallic of carbodicarbene from versatile mononuclear Pd and Ni complexes contributes to serve as a paradigm shift away from relying on traditionally tedious synthetic methods to access the second &#8220;hidden&#8221; lone pair.

      <title>Polypyridyl&#8208;Based Copper Phenanthrene Complexes: Combining Stability with Enhanced DNA Recognition</title>
      <dc:description>
A new class of DNA intercalating metallodrug is reported. These agents contain a polypyridyl caging ligand called DPA which is bound to a copper ion ligated to a phenanthrene (Phen) DNA intercalator. The lead agent is Cu&#8208;DPA&#8208;DPPZ and it can recognize the minor groove of G&#8211;C rich DNA sequences and displays promising activity against several pancreatic cancer cell lines. The graphic shows the Cu&#8208;DPA&#8208;DPPZ complex intercalating the minor groove of a G&#8211;C DNA sequence taken from the protein data bank (2ANA). The modeling was completed using PyMOL together with the X&#8208;ray crystal structure of the complex. More information can be found in the Full Paper by A. Kellett et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202001996).

      <title>Twofold C&#8211;H Activation Enables Synthesis of a Diazacoronene&#8208;type Fluorophore with Near Infrared Emission through Isosteric Replacement</title>
      <dc:description>The synthesis and photophysical properties of a soluble amide&#8208;embedded coronene is reported. The key step in this synthesis is the twofold C&#8211;H activation of diazaperylene by a rhodium(III)Cp* catalyst. This unprecedented structural motif shows intense fluorescence in the near infrared region with a small Stokes shift and a distinct vibronic structure, which exhibits a slight extent of negative solvatochromism. Comparison of this compound with some relevant compounds revealed the importance of the amide incorporation in the peripheral concave region including an angular position to retain high aromaticity reflecting that of parent coronene. Treatment of this compound with Lewis acid B(C6F5)3  formed a bis&#8208;adduct, which exhibited enhanced aromaticity as a consequence of the increased double bond character of the amide C&#8211;N bonds.</dc:description>

      <title>Self&#8208;assembly two&#8208;dimensional NiO/CeO2 heterostructure rich in oxygen vacancies as efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst for alkaline hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution</title>
      <dc:description>Developing high&#8208;efficiency bifunctional electrocatalysts toward hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline surroundings is essential and challenging for generating clean hydrogen massively. Herein, a novel self&#8208;assembly two&#8208;dimensional (2D) NiO/CeO2  heterostructure (HS) consisted of NiO and CeO2  nanocrystals has been firstly prepared via a facile two&#8208;step approach and utilized as an enhanced bifunctional electrocatalyst for HER and OER under alkaline condition. It is concluded that 2D NiO/CeO2  HS rich in oxygen vacancies demonstrates attractive electrocatalytic properties for both HER and OER in 1 M KOH, including low onset overpotential (&#951;1),  &#951;10  and Tafel slope, excellent durability as well as large active surface area. Owing to this, the self&#8208;assembly 2D NiO/CeO2  HS is believed to be an efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst toward HER and OER.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Developing high&#8208;efficiency bifunctional electrocatalysts toward hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline surroundings is essential and challenging for generating clean hydrogen massively. Herein, a novel self&#8208;assembly two&#8208;dimensional (2D) NiO/CeO2  heterostructure (HS) consisted of NiO and CeO2  nanocrystals has been firstly prepared via a facile two&#8208;step approach and utilized as an enhanced bifunctional electrocatalyst for HER and OER under alkaline condition. It is concluded that 2D NiO/CeO2  HS rich in oxygen vacancies demonstrates attractive electrocatalytic properties for both HER and OER in 1 M KOH, including low onset overpotential (&#951;1),  &#951;10  and Tafel slope, excellent durability as well as large active surface area. Owing to this, the self&#8208;assembly 2D NiO/CeO2  HS is believed to be an efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst toward HER and OER.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Strong Equatorial Crystal Field Enhances the Axial Anisotropy and Energy Barrier for Spin Reversal Process in Yb2 SMMs</title>
      <dc:description>The importance of equatorial crystal fields on magnetic anisotropy of ytterbium SMMs is observed for the first time. Herein, we report three similar dinuclear ytterbium complexes of formula [Yb  2  (3&#8208;OMe&#8208;L)  2  (DMF)  2  (NO  3  )  2  ]&#183;DMF (  1  ), [Yb  2  (3&#8208;H&#8208;L)  2  (DMF)  2  (NO  3  )  2  ]&#183;DMF&#183;H  2  O (  2  ) and [Yb  2  (3&#8208;NO  3  &#8208;L)  2  (DMF)  2  (NO  3  )  2  ] (  3  ), [where 3&#8208;X&#8208;H  2  L= N'&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;3&#8208;X&#8208;benzylidene)picolinohydrazide, X = OMe(  1  ), H(  2  ) NO  2  (  3  )]. The detailed magnetic measurements display the presence of weak antiferromagnetic interaction between the Yb centers and field induced slow relaxation of magnetization in all the complexes. The higher energy barrier for spin reversal was observed for complex  1  (U  eff  = 50 K) and it dercreases in the order of  2  (47 K) to  3  (40 K). Notably, complex  1  shows a remarkable energy barrier with in the frequency range of 1&#8208;850 Hz reported for Yb&#8208;based single molecule magnets (SMMs). Further, the ab initio calculations show the higher axial anisotropy and lower QTM (quantum tunneling of magnetization) in the ground state for  1  compared to  2  and  3  . It has also been observed that the presence of strong crystal field in the equatorial plane(when the &#8736;O1&#8208;Yb&#8208;O3 bond angle is close to 90&#186;) enhances the axial anisotropy and improve the SMM behavior in the studied complexes. Both the experimental and theoretical analysis of relaxation dynamics discloses that Raman and QTM play major role on slow relaxation process for all the complexes.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>The combination of synthesis, rotating ring&#8208;disk electrode (RRDE) and cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements, and computational investigations with the aid of DFT methods shows how a thiourea, a squaramide, and a bissulfonamide as additives affect the EqCr equilibrium of Cp2TiCl2.

      <title>CoPd Nanoalloys with MOF as Template for Both N&#8208;doped Carbon and Cobalt Precursor: Efficient and Robust Catalysts for Hydrogenation Reactions</title>
      <dc:description>In this work, a series of MOF&#8208;derived CoPd nanoalloys have been prepared. The nanocatalysts exhibited excellent activities in the hydrogenation of nitroarenes and alkenes in green solvent (ethanol/water) under mild conditions (H  2  balloon, room temperature). Using ZIF&#8208;67 as template for both carbon matrix and cobalt precursor coating with a mesoporous SiO  2  layer, the catalyst CoPd/NC@SiO  2  were smoothly constructed. Catalytic results revealed the synergistic effect between Co and Pd components in the hydrogenation process due to the enhanced electron density. Mesoporous SiO  2  shell effectively prevented the sintering of hollow carbon and metal NPs at high temperature, furnishing the well&#8208;dispersed nanoalloy catalysts and better catalytic performance. Moreover, the catalyst was durable and showed negligible activity decay in recycling and scale&#8208;up experiments, providing a mild and highly efficient way to access amines and arenes.</dc:description>

      <title>Enhancing magnetic communication between metal centres: the role of s&#8208;tetrazine based radicals as ligands</title>
      <dc:description>Although 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrazines or  s  &#8208;tetrazines have been known in the literature for more than a century, their coordination chemistry has become increasingly popular in recent years due to their unique redox activity, multiple binding sites and their various applications. The electron&#8208;poor character of the ring and stabilization of the radical anion through all four nitrogen atoms in their metal complexes provide new aspects in molecular magnetism towards the synthesis of new high performing Single Molecule Magnets (SMMs). The scope of this review is to examine the role of  s  &#8208;tetrazine radical ligands in transition metal and lanthanide based SMMs and provide a critical overview of the progress thus far in this field. As well, general synthetic routes and new insights for the preparation of  s  &#8208;tetrazines are discussed, along with their redox activity and applications in various fields. Concluding remarks along with the limitations and perspectives of these ligands are discussed.</dc:description>

      <title>Gold(I) Complexation of the Phosphanoxy&#8208;Substituted Phosphaalkenes for the Activation&#8208;Free LAuCl Catalysis</title>
      <dc:description>The phosphanoxy&#8208;substituted phosphaalkene bearing the P=C&#8211;O&#8211;P skeleton can be prepared from diphosphene Mes*P=PMes* (Mes* = 2,4,6&#8208;  t  Bu  3  C  6  H  2  ), and the use for catalysis is of interest. In this paper, complexation of the phosphanoxy&#8208;substituted phosphaalkenes with gold are investigated, and the catalytic activity of the mono&#8208; and bis(chlorogold) complexes are subsequently evaluated. Reaction of the P=C&#8211;O&#8211;P compound with (tht)AuCl (tht = tetrahydrothiophene) showed dominant coordination on the sp  3  phosphorus, and complete coordination on the sp  2  phosphorus required removal of tetrahydrothiophene. Atoms&#8208;In&#8208;Molecules (AIM) analysis based on the X&#8208;ray structure of the chlorogold complex indicated pseudo coordinating interaction between the gold centre and the P=C unit. The bis(chlorogold) complexes indicated the conformational isomerism, and catalyzed cycloisomerization/alkoxyclization of 1,6&#8208;enyne and for hydration of terminal alkyne without the activation treatment. Even the mono(chlorogold) complexes catalyzed the alkoxycyclization reaction without silver co&#8208;catalyst, indicating that the alcohols were effective for the activation of AuCl unit</dc:description>

Atoms&#8208;In&#8208;Molecules (AIM) analysis based on the X&#8208;ray structure of the chlorogold complex indicated pseudo coordinating interaction between the gold centre and the P=C unit. The bis(chlorogold) complexes indicated the conformational isomerism, and catalyzed cycloisomerization/alkoxyclization of 1,6&#8208;enyne and for hydration of terminal alkyne without the activation treatment. Even the mono(chlorogold) complexes catalyzed the alkoxycyclization reaction without silver co&#8208;catalyst, indicating that the alcohols were effective for the activation of AuCl unit&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Dithieno[a,e]pentalenes: Highly Antiaromatic Yet Stable &#960;&#8208;Electron Systems without Bulky Substituents</title>
      <dc:description>Dithieno[a,e]penalenes (DTPs) with various substituents were synthesized as a class of antiaromatic compounds. Annulation of thiophene rings imparts the pentalene moiety with high thermal stability even without bulky substituents, while retaining antiaromaticity. The higher magnitude of antiaromaticity in DTPs, in addition to the differences in the electronic structures of the fused aromatic rings, resulted in a narrower HOMO&#8211;LUMO gap than that of the corresponding dibenzo[a,e]pentalene analog, giving rise to red&#8208;shifted electronic absorption that reaches the near&#8208;infrared region. Moreover, systematic investigations on the solid&#8208;state packing structure revealed that DTPs prefer offset face&#8208;to&#8208;face packing motifs rather than face&#8208;centered &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking. In particular, the thienyl&#8208;substituted DTP bearing hydrophilic side chains exhibited thermochromic behavior in polar solvents, which was ascribed to the formation of aggregates.</dc:description>

      <title>Synthesis of Morpholine&#8208;Based Analogs of (&#8722;)&#8208;Zampanolide and Their Biological Activity</title>

The synthesis of the common functionalized morpholine building block involved two consecutive epoxide openings with tosylamide and the product of the first opening reaction, respectively, as nucleophiles. Of the two possible routes departing from two different pairs of enantiomeric epoxides, one proved to be clearly superior. Of the three morpholino&#8208;zampanolides investigated, the  N&#8208;  acetyl and the  N&#8208;  benzoyl derivative both exhibited nanomolar antiproliferative activity, thus being essentially equipotent with the natural product.

      <title>Towards Photochromic Azobenzene&#8208;Based Inhibitors for Tryptophan Synthase</title>
      <dc:description>Light&#8208;regulation of drug molecules has gained growing interest in the fields of biochemical and pharmacological research in recent years. In addition, a serious need for novel molecular targets of antibiotics has emerged presently. Here, we present the development of a photo&#8208;controllable, azobenzene&#8208;based antibiotic precursor towards tryptophan synthase (TS), an essential metabolic multienzyme complex in bacteria. The compound exhibited a medium&#8208;strong inhibition of TS in its  E  configuration, and a 5&#8208;fold lower inhibition strength in its  Z  configuration. Using a combination of biochemical, crystallographic, and computational analyses we characterized the inhibition mode of this compound. Remarkably, binding of the inhibitor to a hitherto not considered cavity causes an unproductive conformation of TS leading to non&#8208;competitive inhibition of tryptophan production. In conclusion, we created a promising lead compound for the combat of bacterial diseases, which targets an essential metabolic enzyme, and whose inhibition strength can be controlled with light.</dc:description>

The Comet assay was used to determine their ability to damage DNA, and results show dose dependent damage which correlates well with the cytotoxicity results.

      <title>Generation of oxidoreductases with dual alcohol dehydrogenase and amine dehydrogenase activity</title>
      <dc:description>The l&#8208;lysine&#8208;&#949;&#8208;dehydrogenase (LysEDH) from Geobacillus stearothermophilus naturally catalyzes the oxidative deamination of the &#949;&#8208;amino group of l&#8208;lysine. We previously engineered this enzyme to create amine dehydrogenase (AmDH) variants that possess a new hydrophobic cavity in their active site such that aromatic ketones can bind and be converted into &#945;&#8208;chiral amines with excellent enantioselectivity. We also recently observed that LysEDH was capable of reducing aromatic aldehydes into primary alcohols. Herein, we harnessed the promiscuous alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) activity of LysEDH to create new variants that exhibited enhanced catalytic activity for the reduction of substituted benzaldehydes and arylaliphatic aldehydes to primary alcohols. Notably, these novel engineered dehydrogenases also catalyzed the reductive amination of a variety of aldehydes and ketones with excellent enantioselectivity, thus exhibiting a dual AmDH/ADH activity. We envisioned that the catalytic bi&#8208;functionality of these enzymes could be applied for the direct conversion of alcohols into amines. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle, we performed an unprecedented one&#8208;pot &#8220;hydrogen&#8208;borrowing&#8221; cascade to convert benzyl alcohol to benzylamine using a single enzyme. Conducting the same biocatalytic cascade in the presence of cofactor recycling enzymes (i.e., NADH&#8208;oxidase and formate dehydrogenase) increased the reaction yields. In summary, this work provides the first examples of enzymes showing &#8220;alcohol aminase&#8221; activity.</dc:description>

      <title>Polyamine&#8208;functionalized 2&#8217;&#8208;amino&#8208;LNA in oligonucleotides: Facile synthesis of novel monomers and high affinity binding towards ssDNA and dsDNA</title>
      <dc:description>Attachment of cationic moieties onto oligonucleotides (ONs) promises not only to increase the binding affinity of antisense ONs by reducing charge repulsion between the two negative strands of a duplex but also to augment their  in vivo  stability against nucleases. In this study, polyamine functionalities were introduced into ONs  via  2&#8217;&#8208;amino&#8208;LNA scaffolds. The resulting ONs exhibited efficient binding towards ssDNA, ssRNA and dsDNA targets, with the 2&#8217;&#8208;amino&#8208;LNA analogue carrying a tri&#8208;aminated linker showing the most pronounced duplex and triplex stabilizing effect. Molecular modelling revealed that favourable conformational and electrostatic effects led to the salt&#8208;bridge formed between positive&#8208;charged polyamine moieties and the Watson&#8208;Hoogsteen groove of the dsDNA targets, resulting in the observed triplex stabilization. All the investigated monomers conferred increased resistance against 3&#8217;&#8208;nucleolytic digestion relative to the non&#8208;functionalized controls.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>To investigate the effect of the surface structure of dye&#8208;sensitized photocatalyst nanoparticles, we prepared three types of Ru(II)&#8208;photosensitizer(PS)&#8208;double&#8208;layered Pt&#8208;cocatalyst&#8208;loaded TiO  2  nanoparticles with different surface structures, Zr&#8208;  RuCP  6  &#8208;Zr&#8208;  RuP  6  @  N  &#160;wt%Pt&#8208;TiO  2  ,  RuCP  6  &#8208;Zr&#8208;  RuP  6  @  N  &#160;wt%Pt&#8208;TiO  2  , and  RuCP  2  &#8208;Zr&#8208;  RuP  6  @  N  &#160;wt%Pt&#8208;TiO  2  (  N  = 0.2, 1, and 5), and evaluated their photocatalytic H  2  evolution activity in the presence of redox&#8208;reversible iodide (I  &#8208;  ) as the electron donor. Although the driving force of the electron injection from I  &#8208;  to the photooxidized Ru(III) PS is comparable, the activity increased in the following order:  RuCP  2  &#8208;Zr&#8208;  RuP  6  @1&#160;wt%Pt&#8208;TiO  2  &lt;  RuCP  6  &#8208;Zr&#8208;  RuP  6  @1&#160;wt%Pt&#8208;TiO  2  &lt; Zr&#8208;  RuCP  6  &#8208;Zr&#8208;  RuP  6  @1&#160;wt%Pt&#8208;TiO  2  . The apparent quantum yield (AQY) of Zr&#8208;  RuCP  6  &#8208;Zr&#8208;  RuP  6  @1&#160;wt%Pt&#8208;TiO  2  in the first hour reached 1%. Zeta potential measurements suggest that the surface Zr  4+  &#8208;phosphate groups attracted I  &#8208;  anions to the nanoparticle&#8211;solution interface. Our results indicate that the surface modification of dye&#8208;sensitized photocatalysts is a promising approach to enhance the photocatalytic activity with various redox mediators.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>The chemistry of transition metal carbynes, LnM&#8801;CR, has historically been dominated by species bearing hydrocarbyl or amino &#8216;R&#8217; substituents, with other elements appearing only sporadically. In recent years carbynes and related &#8216;C1&#8217; species bearing other main&#8208;group substituents, particularly heavier elements of the p&#8208;block, have begun to emerge. This review details the chemistry of heavier pnictogen&#8208;functionalised C1 ligands, MCARn (A = P, As, Sb, Bi; n = 0&#8208;3), including their syntheses, properties and reactivities, and how these are distinguished from more traditional carbyne complexes. Recent developments in the closely related phosphaisonitrile, cya&#8208;phosphide and cya&#8208;arside ligands, LnM(C&#8801;A) (A = P, As), are also discussed.</dc:description>

      <title>A nanoprobe based on gated mesoporous silica nanoparticles for the selective and sensitive detection of benzene metabolite t,t&#8208;muconic acid in urine</title>
      <dc:description>Benzene is a highly toxic aromatic hydrocarbon. Inhaling benzene can cause dizziness, vertigo, headaches, aplasia, mutations and, in the most extreme cases, cancer. Trans, trans&#8208;muconic acid (t,t&#8208;MA) is one of the metabolization products of benzene.&#160; Although different analytical methods have been reported for the determination of t,t&#8208;MA, these are often expensive, require trained personnel, are not suitable for on&#8208;site measurements, and use hazardous organic solvents. For these reasons, the development of reliable, selective and sensitive methods for rapid and in situ detection of t, t&#8208;MA are of importance. Addressing this challenge, a nanodevice for the selective and sensitive quantification of t,t&#8208;MA in urine is reported. The nanodevice used is achieved using mesoporous silica nanoparticles loaded with a dye reporter and capped with a dicopper(II) azacryptand. Pore opening and payload release is induced rapidly (10 min) and selectively with t,t&#8208;MA in urine, using a simple fluorimeter without sample pretreatment.</dc:description>

      <title>Characterizing Polyoxovanadate&#8208;alkoxide Clusters Using Vanadium K&#8208;edge X&#8208;ray Absorption Spectroscopy</title>
      <dc:description>A number of technologies would benefit from developing inorganic compounds and materials with specific electronic and magnetic exchange properties. Unfortunately, designing compounds with these properties is difficult because metal&#183;&#183;&#183;metal coupling schemes are hard to predict and control. Fully characterizing communication between metals in existing compounds that exhibit interesting properties could provide valuable insight and advance those predictive capabilities. One such class of molecules are the series of Lindqvist iron&#8208;functionalized and hexavanadium polyoxovanadate&#8208;alkoxide clusters, which we characterized here using V K&#8208;edge X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy. Substantial changes in the pre&#8208;edge peak intensities were observed that tracked with the V 3d&#8208;electron count. The data also suggested substantial delocalization between the vanadium cations. Meanwhile, the FeIII cations were electronically isolated from the polyoxovanadate core.</dc:description>

      <title>Photocontrolled DNA origami assembly using two photoswitches</title>
      <dc:description>Stimuli responsive switching molecules have been widely investigated for the purpose of mechanical control of biomolecules. The recently developed arylazopyrazole (AAP) shows photoisomerization activity, displaying faster response to light induced conformational change and unique absorption spectral properties different from the conventionally used azobenzene. Here, we demonstrate that AAP can be used as a photoswitching molecule to control photo&#8208;induced assembly and disassembly of DNA origami nanostructures. We designed and constructed AAP&#8208;modified DNA origami. We observed the repeated assembly and disassembly of AAP&#8208;modified X&#8208;shaped DNA origami and hexagonal origami with counterpart complementary strands using alternative UV and visible light irradiation. Closed and linear assemblies of AAP&#8208;modified X&#8208;shaped origami were successfully formed by photoirradiation, and more than 1 &#181;m linear assemblies were formed. Finally, we showed that the two photoswitches, AAP and azobenzene, can be used in tandem to independently control different assembly configurations using different irradiation wavelengths. AAP can extend the variety of available wavelengths of photoswitches and stably work for assembly and disassembly of various DNA origami nanostructures.</dc:description>

      <title>High Efficiency Sky&#8208;Blue Gold(III)&#8208;TADF Emitters</title>
      <dc:description>Highly efficient sky&#8208;blue luminescent gold(III) complexes with emission quantum yields up to 82%, lifetimes down to 0.67 &#956;s and emission peak maxima at 470&#8208;484 nm were prepared through a consideration of pincer gold(III) donor&#8208;acceptor complexes. Photophysical studies and time&#8208;dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) calculations revealed that the emission nature of these gold(III) complexes is most consistent with TADF. Solution&#8208;processed OLEDs with these gold(III) complexes as dopants afforded electroluminescence maxima at 465&#8208;473 nm with FWHM of 64&#8208;67 nm and maximum external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of up to 15.25%. This research demonstrates the first example of gold(III)&#8208;OLEDs showing electroluminescence maxima smaller than 470 nm, and highlights the potential of using gold(III)&#8208;TADF emitters in the development of high efficiency blue OLEDs and blue emissive dopant in WOLEDs.</dc:description>

      <title>Flexible yet Robust Framework of Tin(II) Oxide Carbodiimide for Reversible Lithium Storage</title>
      <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) can become promising electrode materials for advanced lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), because their loosely&#8208;packed porous structures may mitigate volume expansion and metal atom aggregation which occur to the respective metal oxides. However, they suffer from poor electrical conductivity and irreversible structural degradation upon charge/discharge processes, which impede their practical utilization. Herein, we investigate MOF&#8208;like Sn2O(CN2) as a new electrode material. The conductive yet flexible [N=C=N] linkers are tilted between [Sn4O] nodes and cross&#8208;linked into a porous quasi&#8208;layered structure. Such structure offers abundant channels for fast Li&#8208;ion transport and tolerance of enormous volume expansion. Notably, anisotropic [N=C=N]2&#8722; arrays hardly migrate so that Sn0 nanodots are physically separated via robust [N=C=N]2&#8722; framework during discharge process, thereby effectively preventing the formation of large Sn islands. Owing to the structural advantage, the Sn2O(CN2) electrode exhibits high initial Coulombic efficiency as ~80%. With the addition of graphite as conductive supporter, the electrode provides 978 mA h g&#8722;1 at 1.0 A g&#8722;1 even after 300 cycles. Such MOF&#8208;like carbodiimides hold potential for the advanced electrodes in LIBs and other battery systems.</dc:description>

      <title>Structural Snapshots of &#960;&#8208;arene Bonding in a Gold Germylene Cation</title>
      <dc:description>Heavier group 14 element cations exhibit a remarkable reactivity that has typically hampered their isolation. For the few available examples, the role of &#960;&#8208;arene interactions is crucial to provide kinetic stabilization, but dynamic and structural information on those contacts is yet limited. In this study we have accessed the metalogermylenium cation [(PMe 2 Ar Dipp2 )AuGe(Ar Dipp2 )Cl] + ( 4 + ) (Ar Dipp2 = C 6 H 3 &#8208;2,6&#8208;(C 6 H 3 &#8208;2,6&#8208; i Pr 2 ) 2 ) that has been structurally characterized with three different non&#8208;coordinating counteranions. These studies provide for the first time dynamic information about the conformational rearrangement that characterizes &#960;&#8208;arene bonding thorough a series of X&#8208;ray diffraction structural snapshots. Computational studies reveal the weak character of the &#960;&#8208;arene bonding ( ca . 2 kcal/mol) that can be described as the donation from a &#960; C=C bond toward the empty p valence orbital of germanium.</dc:description>
