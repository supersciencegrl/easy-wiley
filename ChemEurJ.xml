         <title>Construction of ternary bismuth&#8208;based heterojunction using (BiO)2CO3 as electron bridge for highly efficient degradation of phenol</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inspired by nature, it has been considered an effective approach to design artificial photosynthetic system by fabricating Z&#8208;scheme photocatalyst to eliminate environmental issues and alleviate the global energy crisis. However, the development of low cost, environment&#8208;friendly, and high&#8208;efficient photocatalysts by utilizing solar energy still confronts huge challenge. Herein, we constructed Bi2O3/(BiO)2CO3/Bi2MoO6ternary heterojunction via a facile solvothermal method and calcination approach and used it as a photocatalyst for the degradation of phenol. The optimized Bi2O3/(BiO)2CO3/Bi2MoO6 heterojunction delivers a considerable activity for phenol photodegradation with an impressive removal efficiency of 98.8% and about total organic carbon (TOC) of 68% within 180 min under visible light irradiation. The excellent photocatalytic activity was ascribed to the formation of a Z&#8208;scheme heterojunction, more importantly, the presence of (BiO)2CO3 as an electron bridge greatly shortens the migration distance of photogenerated electron from ECB of Bi2O3 to EVB of Bi2MoO6, thus prolonging the lifetime of photogenerated electrons, which is verified by trapping experiments, electron spin&#8208;resonance spectroscopy (ESR) results, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This work provides a potential strategy to fabricate highly efficient Bi&#8208;based Z&#8208;scheme photocatalysts with wide application prospects in solar&#8208;to&#8208;fuel conversion and environmental protection.</dc:description>

         <title>Preparation of UFM1&#8208;Derived Probes through Highly Optimized Total Chemical Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ufmylation is involved in various cellular processes and associated with many human diseases. The understanding of this modification relies on the use of customized UFM1&#8208;derived probes for activity&#8208;based profiling of its related enzymes. Herein we present a highly optimized total chemical synthesis for the generation of diverse UFM1&#8208;derived probes including UFM1&#8208;PA, Biotin&#8208;UFM1&#8208;PA and UFM1&#8208;AMC, in which a UFM1 C&#8208;terminal valine hydrazide was readily prepared by hydrazide&#8208;based ligation and used as a versatile handle for the installation of enzyme&#8208;sensitive warheads and fluorescent reporters. The resulting probes display high reactivity and selectivity for UFM1&#8208;specific enzymes in cell lysates. This strategy facilitates the generation and diversity of the UFM1&#8208;derived toolkit that can be employed to profile UFM1&#8208;specific enzymes, thereby shining insights into the dynamics of ufmylation.</dc:description>

         <title>A Massively Parallel Double&#8208;Selection Workflow for the Evolution of Molecular Switches Based on Surface&#8208;Display in Escherichia coli</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Microbial surface display of proteins is a versatile method for a wide range of biotechnological applications. Here, we present the use of a surface display system in E. coli for the evolution of a riboswitch from an RNA aptamer. To this end a streptavidin&#8208;binding peptide (SBP) is displayed at the bacterial surface, which can be used for massively parallel selection using a magnetic separation system. Coupling gene expression from a riboswitch library to the display of SBP hence allows selection of library members that express strongly in the presence of a ligand. As excessive SBP expression leads to bacterial growth inhibition, it can be used to negatively select against leaky riboswitches expressing in the absence of ligand. Based on this principle, we devise a double selection workflow that enables quick selection of functional riboswitches with a comparatively low screening workload. We demonstrate the efficiency of our protocol by re&#8208;discovering a previously isolated theophylline riboswitch from a library as well as a novel riboswitch that is similar in performance, but slightly more responsive at low theophylline concentrations. Our workflow is massively parallel and can be applied to the screening or pre&#8208;screening of large molecular libraries.</dc:description>

         <title>De Novo Design of pre&#8208;miR&#8208;21 Maturation Inhibitors: Synthesis and Activity Assessment</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Targeting RNA with small molecules is a major challenge of current medicinal chemistry, and the identification and design of original scaffolds able to selectively interact with an RNA target remains difficult. Various approaches have been developed based on classical medicinal chemistry strategies (fragment&#8208;based drug design, dynamic combinatorial chemistry, HTS or DNA&#8208;encoded libraries) as well as on advanced structural biology and biochemistry methodologies (such as X&#8208;ray, cryo&#8208;EM, NMR, or SHAPE). Here, we report the de novo design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of RNA ligands using a straightforward and sustainable chemistry combined with molecular docking and biochemical and biophysical studies that allowed us to identify a novel pharmacophore for RNA binding. Specifically, we focused on the targeting of biogenesis of microRNA&#8208;21, the re&#8208;known oncogene. This led us not only to promising inhibitors but also to a better understanding of the interactions formed between the small molecule compounds and the RNA target paving the way for the rational design of efficient inhibitors with potential anticancer activity.</dc:description>

         <title>On the Stereochemistry of the NH Bond Activation of Ammonia or Amines by Disilenes: Predictability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The stereochemistry of the addition of NH3 to the stereoisomers of 1,2&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;1,2&#8208;bis(2,4,6&#8208;triisopropylphenyl)disilene (Z&#8208;5 or E&#8208;5) is 100 % stereospecific giving two isomeric disilylamines 6 and 7, respectively, derived from syn&#8208;addition to the stereoisomeric disilenes. Variable Time Normalization Analysis studies of the reaction of tetramesityldisilene (3) with isopropylamine (iPrNH2) revealed that the order in both amine and disilene is 1. The kinetic isotope effect for the addition of iPrNH2/iPrND2 to tetramesityldisilene was determined to be 3.04 &#177; 0.06 at 298 K, a primary KIE, indicating that the proton is transferred in the rate determining step. Competition studies between the addition of PrNH2 and iPrNH2 to tetramesityldisilene resulted in the exclusive formation of the PrNH2 adduct consistent with a nucleophilic addition. Computational studies of the mechanism of the addition of ammonia to E&#8208;5 revealed the lowest energy pathway involves the formation of the donor adduct derived from syn&#8208;addition, followed by intramolecular syn&#8208;transfer of the proton. The results of this study&#160;allow for a refinement of our understanding of the mechanism of this important fundamental reaction in disilene chemistry, and allow us to understand our ability to reliably predict the stereochemical outcomes of future NH &#963;&#8208;bond activation reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>A N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Supported Zinc Catalyst for the 1,2&#8208;Regioselective Hydroboration of N&#8208;heteroarenes.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A fluorenyl&#8208;tethered N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene LH (LH = [(Flu)H&#8208;(CH2)2&#8208;NHCDipp]) and its monoanionic version L&#8208; are explored in complexation with zinc towards the hydroboration of N&#8208;heteroarenes, carbonyl, ester, amide, and nitrile under ambient condition. The N&#8208;heteroarenes exhibit high 1,2&#8208;regioselectivity which is justified by computational analyses. The relative hydroboration rates of differently p&#8208;substituted (electron donating vs. withdrawing) pyridines are also addressed. The monodentate LH offers a better catalytic activity than the chelating L&#8208; for steric reasons despite both giving three&#8208;coordinate zinc complexes. The mechanism involves a Zn&#8208;H species at the heart of these catalytic processes which is trapped by Ph2CO. Computational studies suggest that the barrier to form the hydride complex is comparable to the barrier required for the following hydride transfer to pyridine.</dc:description>

         <title>Dinuclear Mn(I) Complexes with Phosphido and Hydrido Bridges: Synthesis, Reactivity, and Hydrogenative Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new class of organomanganese hydrogenation catalysts was recently rediscovered. These are simple dinuclear Mn(I) carbonyl compounds with phosphido (PR2&#8211;) and hydrido (H&#8211;) bridges. This class of compounds has been known since the 1960&#8217;s, and they have rich coordination chemistry and reactivity. Given their recently discovered potential for catalytic applications, a fresh look at this class of compounds was necessary. Hence, this review comprehensively covers the synthesis, reactivity, and catalysis of this interesting class of molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Matched Ligands for Small, Stable Colloidal Nanoparticles of Copper, Cuprous Oxide and Cuprous Sulfide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This work applies organometallic routes to copper(0/I) nanoparticles and describes how to match ligand chemistries with different material compositions. The syntheses involve reacting an organo&#8208;copper precursor, copper(I)mesityl [CuMes]z (z = 4, 5), at low temperatures and in organic solvents, with hydrogen, air or hydrogen sulfide to deliver Cu, Cu2O or Cu2S nanoparticles. Use of sub&#8208;stoichiometric quantities of protonated ligand (pro&#8208;ligand; 0.1&#8208;0.2 equivalents vs. [CuMes]z) allows saturation of surface coordination sites but avoids excess pro&#8208;ligand contaminating the nanoparticle solutions. The pro&#8208;ligands are nonanoic acid (HO2CR1), 2&#8208;[2&#8208;(2&#8208;methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid (HO2CR2) or di(thio)nonanoic acid, (HS2CR1), and are matched to the metallic, oxide or sulfide nanoparticles. Ligand exchange reactions reveal that copper(0) nanoparticles may be coordinated by carboxylate or di(thio)carboxylate ligands, but Cu2O is preferentially coordinated by carboxylate ligands and Cu2S by di(thio)carboxylate ligands. This work highlights the opportunities for organometallic routes to well&#8208;defined nanoparticles and the need for appropriate ligand selection.</dc:description>

         <title>Novel Pyrimidine&#8208;Based Iridium Complexes with Bulky Charge&#8208;Carrier Groups as Dopants for Highly Efficient Green Polymer Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two novel pyrimidine&#8208;based iridium complexes ((TPAPr)2IrAcac and (TPSPr)2IrAcac) with triphenylamine and tetraphenylsilane were fully synthesized and characterized. (TPSPr)2IrAcac with bulky tetraphenylsilane group, which can efficiently suppress the concentration quenching, achieved its highest current efficiency (CE) at higher dopant concentration. Highly efficient green phosphorescent polymer light&#8208;emitting diodes (PLEDs) are achieved by using (TPAPr)2IrAcac and (TPSPr)2IrAcac as dopants.







Abstract
Two new pyrimidine&#8208;based iridium complexes with triphenylamine and tetraphenylsilane, namely (TPAPr)2IrAcac and (TPSPr)2IrAcac, were fully synthesized and characterized. Both of the targeted iridium complexes exhibit excellent thermal stability and high photoluminescence quantum yields. Compared to (TPAPr)2IrAcac, (TPSPr)2IrAcac achieved its highest PLQY and current efficiency (CE) at higher dopant concentration probably because of its bulky tetraphenylsilane group, which can effectively suppress the concentration quenching. However, according to DFT studies, (TPSPr)2IrAcac shows faster non&#8208;radiative transitions due to the presence of more excited&#8208;state distortions than (TPAPr)2IrAcac. As a result, Green phosphorescent polymer light&#8208;emitting diodes (PLEDs) containing (TPAPr)2IrAcac and (TPSPr)2IrAcac as dopants exhibit exceptional device performance with peak CE values of 38.24 and 36.06&#8197;cd&#8201;A&#8722;1, respectively. (TPAPr)2IrAcac exhibited a superior efficiency than (TPSPr)2IrAcac because of its high &#934;p, low RMSD value, and efficient energy transfer from the host to the guest. More importantly, the PLEDs based on (TPAPr)2IrAcac and (TPSPr)2IrAcac show stable phosphorescent emission with Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.313, 0.497) and (0.299, 0.483), respectively. This work points out a viable method for creating phosphorescent iridium complexes based on pyrimidine for high&#8208;efficiency organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs).

         <title>Functional Characterisation of Highly Conserved and Structurally Prominent Residues of 2&#8208;Methylisoborneol Synthase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two new 2&#8208;methylisoborneol synthases phylogenetically unrelated to the known enzyme from Streptomyces coelicolor (ScMIBS) were functionally characterised. ScMIBS was extensively investigated by site&#8208;directed mutagenesis in 31 positions that were selected based on the enzyme structure and their high conservation, revealing several structural motifs that are important for catalysis.







Abstract
2&#8208;Methylisoborneol is a widespread musty odourant that is produced by many bacteria including actinomycetes, cyanobacteria and myxobacteria. Two 2&#8208;methylisoborneol synthases (MIBS) that are phylogenetically distant to the known enzyme from Streptomyces coelicolor were found to be highly active for 2&#8208;methylisoborneol biosynthesis. Based on the enzyme structure and on an amino acid sequence alignment, the MIBS from S. coelicolor was extensively studied through site&#8208;directed mutagenesis.

         <dc:description>
Spiro&#8208;indolinepyrrolidinones and indoline&#8208;fused diazepinones were synthesized through Cs2CO3&#8208;promoted formal [2+3] and [4+3] cycloadditions of indoline&#8208;derived azadienes and &#945;&#8208;bromohydroxamates. Thirty&#8208;six examples of the target compounds were obtained in up to 89&#8201;% yield. This work expands the scope of products that are available through annulation reactions of indoline&#8208;derived azadienes, thus expanding the toolbox to access valuable indole derivatives for diverse applications.







Abstract
A divergent reaction of indoline&#8208;derived azadienes with &#945;&#8208;bromohydroxamates for the selective synthesis of spiro&#8208;indolinepyrrolidinones and indoline&#8208;fused diazepinones was disclosed. This reaction sequence involved an initial formation of five&#8208;membered spirocyclic products followed by an intramolecular ring&#8208;opening and ring expansion to produce seven&#8208;membered diazepinones. We demonstrated that controlling the reaction time could modulate the reaction pathway for formation of different molecular frameworks for the same set of substrates. Based on the experimental results, the reaction mechanism was also discussed and proposed to explain the phenomena observed in the process.

         <title>Trapping of a Transient Base&#8208;Stabilised Alumylene and Alumylene&#8208;Type Reactivity of a Self&#8208;Stabilising Dialumene towards Organic Azides</title>

         <dc:description>
An NHC&#8208;stabilised aluminium(III) terphenyl dihalide was reduced in the presence of alkynes to trap the in&#8208;situ&#8208;formed alumylene [NHC(Ter)Al:]. In the absence of an alkyne the reduction yielded a self&#8208;stabilised dialumene, which showed alumylene&#8208;like reactivity towards organic azides.







Abstract
The reduction of a carbene&#8208;coordinated, sterically encumbered terphenyl&#8208;substituted aluminium diiodide, (LRAlI2), yielded a &#8220;masked&#8221; dialumene (LRAl=AlRL), self&#8208;stabilised through [2+2] cycloaddition with a peripheral aromatic group. During the course of the reaction, a carbene&#8208;stabilised arylalumylene (LRAl:) was generated in&#8197;situ, which was trapped using an alkyne, generating an aluminacyclopropene or a C&#8722;H activated product thereof, depending on the steric bulk of the alkyne. The masked dialumene also underwent intramolecular cycloreversion and dissociation into alumylene fragments, which reacted with various organic azides to yield monomeric or dimeric iminoalanes depending on the sterics of the azide substituent. The thermodynamics of monomeric and dimeric iminoalane formation were probed by theoretical calculations.

         <title>Exchange Interactions and Magnetic Properties of a Molecular Mn18&#8208;Ring Complex</title>

The synthesis and characterization of the compound [Mn3O(OAc)7(HOAc)]6&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;x&#8201;AcOH (x=6&#8211;9) is reported. It contains molecular Mn18&#8208;rings which are built from six [Mn3(&#956;3&#8208;O)(&#956;2&#8208;OAc)6(AcOH)]&#8208;units interconnected by acetate anions. Field and temperature dependent magnetic susceptibility measurements on the compound show weak ferromagnetic interactions between these Mn18&#8208;units in the solid. DFT and ab&#8208;initio multi reference methods (CASSCF/NEVPT2) allowed to simulate the magnetic susceptibility versus temperature dependence of the compound in terms of basically uncoupled magnetic moments of each Mn3&#8208;subunit within the Mn18&#8208;ring.







Abstract
[Mn3O(OAc)7(HOAc)]6&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;x&#8201;AcOH (x=6&#8211;9) represents a rare example of a compound containing molecular Mn18&#8208;rings. These are formed by Mn3(&#956;3&#8208;O) subunits in which the high&#8208;spin Mn(III) centers are bridged by three pairs of acetate anions (AcO&#8722;). An AcOH molecule coordinates to one of the Mn atoms leading to [Mn3(&#956;3&#8208;O)(&#956;2&#8208;OAc)6(AcOH)]&#8208;units, designated in short as Mn3&#8208;units, that are interconnected by acetate anions via the other two Mn atoms to form Mn18&#8208;rings. Magnetic measurements show weak ferromagnetic interactions between them that are suppressed in strong magnetic field. Quantum&#8208;chemical calculations on Mn3 model complexes using independently DFT and ab&#8208;initio multi reference methods (CASSCF/NEVPT2) show a correlation between the orientation of the pseudo&#8208;Jahn&#8208;Teller axes of pairs of Mn(III) magnetic centers and corresponding exchange coupling energies. Weak coupling between Mn3&#8208;units within the Mn18&#8208;ring allowed to simulate the magnetic susceptibility versus temperature dependence in terms of basically uncoupled magnetic moments of each Mn3&#8208;unit within the ring.

         <title>Inverting the Electronic Structure of Diylidylgermylenes by Backbone Modification</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Germylenes with two ylide&#8208;substituents are usually highly nucleophilic species. Herein, we demonstrate that introduction of a cyano moiety into the ylide backbone decreases the LUMO energy and thus significantly enhances the electrophilic nature of these species. This is reflected in the reactivity but also in the molecular structure of the diylidylgermylene.







Abstract
Owing to the strong electron&#8208;donating ability of ylide substituents, diylidyltetrylenes are usually highly nucleophilic species with strong donor capacities. Here, we demonstrate that their electronic properties are in fact highly flexible and can be effectively tuned through variation of the substituent in the ylide backbone. Initial density functional theory studies showed that cyano groups are particularly capable in lowering the LUMO energy of diylidyl germylenes thus turning these usually highly nucleophilic species into electrophilic compounds. This was confirmed by experimental studies. Attempts to synthesize the germylene (YCN)2Ge [with YCN=Ph3P&#8208;(C)&#8208;CN] from the corresponding metalated ylide YCNK selectively led to germanide [(YCN)3Ge)K]2 thus reflecting the electrophilic nature of the intermediate formed germylene. XRD analysis of single crystals of (YCN)2Ge &#8211; serendipitously obtained through protonative cleavage of one ylide from the germanide &#8211; revealed a monomeric structure with rather long Ge&#8208;ylide linkages, which corroborates well with a pure single bond and no stabilization of the empty p&#960; orbital at germanium through &#960; bonding. The germanide exhibits methanide&#8208;like reactivity towards chalcogens but a likewise weak Ge&#8722;C bond as demonstrated by the insertion of carbon dioxide.

Like clockwork, the interconnected gears of substituent and solvent effects drive the conrotatory 4&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization of N&#8208;alkenylnitrones towards the formation of azetidine nitrones. These parameters can then be tuned to facilitate the electrocyclization of challenging substrates. More information can be found in the Research Article by L.&#8197;L.

         <title>Diverse Roles of ScSERF in Modifying the Fibril Growth of Amyloidogenic Proteins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
ScSERF shows distinct effects on the fibril formation of FUS&#8208;Core, FUS&#8208;LC and &#945;&#8208;Synuclein. The positively charged N&#8208;terminus of ScSERF competes to bind with the negatively charged C&#8208;terminus of &#945;&#8208;Synuclein accelerating its amyloid fibril formation. The interaction of ScSERF with monomeric FUS&#8208;Core and FUS&#8208;LC inhibits both the primary nucleation formation and later the elongation of fibrils.







Abstract
The aggregation of amyloidogenic proteins is often related to the occurrence of neurodegenerative diseases, including fused in sarcoma protein (FUS) in frontotemporal lobar degeneration and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis diseases. Recently, the SERF protein family has been reported to have a significant regulatory effect on amyloid formation, but it is still unclear about the detailed mechanisms of SERF acting on different amyloidogenic proteins. Herein, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and fluorescence spectroscopy were used to explore interactions of ScSERF with three amyloidogenic proteins FUS&#8208;LC, FUS&#8208;Core, and &#945;&#8208;Synuclein. NMR chemical shift perturbations reveal them sharing similar interaction sites on the N&#8208;terminal region of ScSERF. However, the amyloid formation of &#945;&#8208;Synuclein protein is accelerated by ScSERF, while ScSERF inhibits fibrosis of FUS&#8208;Core and FUS&#8208;LC proteins. Both the primary nucleation and the total amount of fibrils produced are detained. Our results suggest a diverse role of ScSERF in regulating the fibril growth of amyloidogenic proteins.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;ScSERF shows distinct effects&lt;/b&gt; on the fibril formation of FUS-Core, FUS-LC and &#945;-Synuclein. The positively charged N-terminus of ScSERF competes to bind with the negatively charged C-terminus of &#945;-Synuclein accelerating its amyloid fibril formation. The interaction of ScSERF with monomeric FUS-Core and FUS-LC inhibits both the primary nucleation formation and later the elongation of fibrils.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aggregation of amyloidogenic proteins is often related to the occurrence of neurodegenerative diseases, including fused in sarcoma protein (FUS) in frontotemporal lobar degeneration and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis diseases. Recently, the SERF protein family has been reported to have a significant regulatory effect on amyloid formation, but it is still unclear about the detailed mechanisms of SERF acting on different amyloidogenic proteins. Herein, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and fluorescence spectroscopy were used to explore interactions of ScSERF with three amyloidogenic proteins FUS-LC, FUS-Core, and &#945;-Synuclein. NMR chemical shift perturbations reveal them sharing similar interaction sites on the N-terminal region of ScSERF. However, the amyloid formation of &#945;-Synuclein protein is accelerated by ScSERF, while ScSERF inhibits fibrosis of FUS-Core and FUS-LC proteins. Both the primary nucleation and the total amount of fibrils produced are detained. Our results suggest a diverse role of ScSERF in regulating the fibril growth of amyloidogenic proteins.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Coexistence of Three Different Spin States in a Cyanido&#8208;Bridged Trinuclear Iron(III) Complex with an Unusual FeIII to Ligand Charge Transfer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A trinuclear iron(III) complex trans&#8208;[CpMe3FeIII(dppe)(CN)]2[FeIII(LN4)][PF6]4 with the innocent ligand (LOxN4)&#8722; exhibits an unusual coexistence of one S=3/2 and two S=1/2 spin states and an uncommon MLCT from FeIII to the ligand LOxN4.







Abstract
We report a trinuclear iron(III) cyanido&#8208;bridged complex trans&#8208;[CpMe3FeIII(dppe)(CN)]2[FeIII(LN4)][PF6]4 (2[PF6]4) as the oxidation product of binuclear complex [CpMe3(dppe)FeIICN&#8208;FeIII(LN4)][PF6] (1[PF6]) (CpMe3=1, 2, 4&#8208;trimethyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;cyclo&#8208;pentadienyl, dppe=1,2&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)ethane, LN4=pentane&#8208;2,4&#8208;dione&#8208;bis(S&#8208;methylisothiosemicarbazonato). Complex 1[PF6] possesses an intermediate&#8208;spin five&#8208;coordinated FeIII (S=3/2) which couples antiferromagnetically to the &#960;&#8208;radical ligand (L&#8901;N4)2&#8722; and shows a LMCT (ligand to metal charge transfer) transition from (L&#8901;N4)2&#8722; to FeIII and the FeII&#8594;FeIII MMCT transition. Upon oxidation of 1[PF6], (L&#8901;N4)2&#8722; loses one electron to be the strong electron&#8208;attracting ligand (LOxN4)&#8722; and the intermediate&#8208;spin five&#8208;coordinated FeIII (S=3/2) becomes a low&#8208;spin six&#8208;coordinated FeIII (S=1/2) in 2[PF6]4. Also interestingly, 2[PF6]4 presents the coexistence of three different spin states (one S=3/2 and two S=1/2) and an uncommon FeIII&#8594;(LOxN4)&#8722; MLCT transition, confirmed by the experimental results and supported by the TDDFT calculations.

         <title>Electronic Structure and Aromaticity of an Unusual Cyclo[18]carbon Precursor, C18Br6
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Investigation of an uncommon cyclo[18]carbon precursor: The analyses of the electronic structure, bonding character, electron delocalization, and response to an external magnetic field indicate that C18Br6 is a globally aromatic species with lower aromaticity than cyclo[18]carbon (C18), and the blocking of in&#8208;plane &#960;&#8208;conjugation by the presence of &#8208;Br substituents in it is the underlying cause for the weakening of molecular aromaticity.







Abstract
Herein, the electronic structure and bonding character of the stable cyclo[18]carbon (C18) precursor, C18Br6, are thoroughly characterized by molecular orbital (MO), density of states (DOS), bond order (BO), and interaction region indicator (IRI) analyses. The delocalization characters of out&#8208;of&#8208;plane and in&#8208;plane &#960;&#8208;electrons (labeled as &#960;out&#8208; and &#960;in&#8208;electrons, respectively) in bonding regions were examined using localized orbital locator (LOL) and electron localization function (ELF). The aromaticity was investigated, studying the molecular magnetic response to external magnetic field by computing the magnetically induced current density (Jind), iso&#8208;chemical shielding surface (ICSS), anisotropy of the induced current density (AICD), and the induced magnetic field (Bind). All these analyses indicate that C18Br6 is a globally aromatic species with lower aromaticity than C18, and the blocking of in&#8208;plane &#960;&#8208;conjugation (labeled as &#960;in&#8208;conjugation) by the presence of &#8208;Br substituents in it is the underlying cause for the weakening of molecular aromaticity.

         <title>Traceless N&#8208;Polyfluoroalkylation of Weakly Nucleophilic Nitrogen Containing Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;polyfluoroalkylation reactions are challenging due to the high cost, toxicity or environmental impact of commonly used polyfluoroalkylation reagents. We report the sulfuryl fluoride (SO2F2)&#8208;mediated N&#8208;polyfluoroalkylation of weakly nucleophilic nitrogen compounds from readily available fluorinated alcohols. This method opens access to a variety of N&#8208;polyfluoroalkylated building blocks that are highly valuable for life science applications.







Abstract
Here we report an efficient access to high&#8208;value N&#8208;polyfluoroalkyl anilines, primary polyfluoroalkylamines and N,N&#8208;bis(polyfluoroalkyl)amines, via N&#8208;polyfluoroalkylation of sulfonamides and phthalimide derivatives using sulfuryl fluoride (SO2F2). The in&#8197;situ formation of polyfluoroalkyl fluorosulfonates from commercially available fluorinated alcohols and economical sulfuryl fluoride is highly advantageous given that some polyfluoroalkyl halides are ozone&#8208;depleting substances (ODS) regulated by the Montreal protocol. This general method is applied to the polyfluoroalkylation of a variety of sulfonamides, N&#8208;sulfonyl carbamates and phthalimide with a wide tolerance of functional groups. The process thus provides viable access for industry to N&#8208;(polyfluoroalkyl)anilines as well as primary and secondary N&#8208;(polyfluoroalkyl)amines, which are very valuable but not easily accessible building blocks for life science applications.

         <title>Metallic and Dimensional Optimization of Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for High&#8208;Performance Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The crystallographic dimensions and metallic categories of MOFs are optimized in controlling polysulfides and catalyzing conversion. S supported on 2D&#8208;Ni&#8208;MOF/CNTs exhibits longer lifetime and superior rate capability, due to the highly exposed Ni nuclei. This work pioneered the avenue of sieving decent LSBs cathodes through optimizing the dimensions and metals of MOFs synergistically.







Abstract
Lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries (LSBs) have been considered as one of the most promising energy storage systems owing to their high theoretical energy density and abundant sulfuric resources. However, their commercial application is limited by rapid capacity decline and low Coulombic efficiency.

&lt;p&gt;The crystallographic dimensions and metallic categories of MOFs are optimized in controlling polysulfides and catalyzing conversion. S supported on 2D-Ni-MOF/CNTs exhibits longer lifetime and superior rate capability, due to the highly exposed Ni nuclei. This work pioneered the avenue of sieving decent LSBs cathodes through optimizing the dimensions and metals of MOFs synergistically.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs) have been considered as one of the most promising energy storage systems owing to their high theoretical energy density and abundant sulfuric resources. However, their commercial application is limited by rapid capacity decline and low Coulombic efficiency. Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) made of metallic nodes and organic ligands can suppress polysulfide shuttling and promote redox kinetics. In this paper, the effects of crystallographic dimensions and metallic categories on chemical performance of LSBs have been meticulously explored electrochemical performance. As a result, exposed Ni active sites in a lamellar Ni-MOF was found to deliver a superior electrochemical performance. The as-assembled LSBs with 2D-Ni-MOF/CNTs cathode deliver a much superior initial discharge capacity, (820&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.5&#8197;C), and exhibit excellent cycling stability over 550&#8197;cycles than those analogues of 3D stereoscopic Ni-MOF and 2D lamellar Co-MOF. This work proposed a perspective in elevating LSBs performance through synergistic optimization of the MOFs dimensions and the metallic nuclei in the cathodes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Insight into the Evolution Track for the Metathesis of Alkenes within Hierarchical Zeolite&#8208;Based Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Evolution track within hierarchical zeolite: A new functionality of mesoporosity is disclosed as the intrazeolitic interface boundary with alumina phase, which enables the creation of evolution track for the active metathesis catalysts. The working track requires the indispensable engagements from intracrystalline mesoporous surface, alumina slices, and zeolitic Br&#248;nsted acid sites.







Abstract
The usage of hierarchical MFI zeolite enables a boost of the catalytic performance of Mo&#8208;based catalysts for the olefin&#8208;metathesis reaction. The harvest of active catalysts roots in a segmental evolution track between hierarchical zeolite and Al2O3 slices for the fabrication of active sites. The working evolution track requires the indispensable engagements from intracrystalline mesoporous surface, Al2O3 slices, and zeolitic Br&#248;nsted acid sites. The infilling of disaggregated Al2O3 slices into the intracrystalline mesopores triggers the creation of localized intrazeolite&#8722;Al2O3 interfaces, which enables the subsequent migration and trapping of surface molybdates into the micropores. The insulation of intrazeolite&#8722;Al2O3 interface or shielding of zeolitic Br&#248;nsted acid sites leads to the break of the evolution track. Our findings disclose the hidden functionality of mesoporosity as intrazeolite interface boundary for the fabrication of active sites and supply a new strategy for the rational design of zeolite catalysts.

         <title>Waxberry&#8208;Like MnS/Ni3S4 as High&#8208;Efficiency Bi&#8208;Functional Catalyst for Zn&#8208;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Waxberry&#8208;like MnS/Ni3S4 was successful prepared through a sulfuration process. MnS/Ni3S4 catalysts showed good oxygen evolution reactions (Ej=10=1.55&#8197;V) and oxygen reduction reactions (E1/2=0.81&#8197;V). When the catalyst was used in Zn&#8211;air batteries as the cathode, it showed excellent cycle stability (308&#8197;h) and small voltage gap (0.83&#8197;V &amp; 0.86&#8197;V) at 5&#8197;mA cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
In this paper, a waxberry&#8208;like MnS/Ni3S4 composite catalyst was designed and synthesized. In this coating structure, MnS is located inside and Ni3S4 is wrapped on the surface to form a spherical structure. This structure makes the material show excellent stability in the electrocatalytic process. The diffusion staggered region structure formed at the two&#8208;phase interface greatly enhances the synergistic interaction between MnS and Ni3S4. At the same time, the defects and vacancies formed by the diffusion mechanism at the interface of the two phases increase the active site and improve the interfacial electron transfer kinetics. Therefore, MnS/Ni3S4 composites showed good catalytic performance for ORR/OER. At 10&#8197;mA cm&#8722;2, the overpotential of it is only 320&#8197;mV, and the half&#8208;wave potential can reach 0.81&#8197;V. The catalyst also exhibited extraordinary cycle stability and small voltage gap when used as cathode of Zn&#8208;air batteries. When the current density is 3&#8197;mA cm&#8722;2, the cyclic discharge can be stable for 400&#8197;h and the voltage difference between the front and back does not increase more than. When the current density increases to 5&#8197;mA cm&#8722;2, the cyclic charge and discharge can be stable for more than 300&#8197;h.

         <title>Tetraphenylethene&#8208;Based cis/trans Isomers for Targeted Fluorescence Sensing and Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tetraphenylethene derivatives with adjustable molecular geometry emerge as an attractive paradigm for the development of smart and versatile chemical probes. In this review, the configuration&#8208;dependent molecular recognition, aggregation&#8208;induced emission and bioactivities of cis/trans tetraphenylethene&#8208;based isomers are summarized. Facilitated by the unique properties, their applications in fluorescence detection, bioimaging and targeted therapy are discussed.







Abstract
Molecular probes which can be modulated, functionalized and used to visualize the processes are highly desirable for understanding and manipulating biological systems. Geometric cis and trans isomers of tetraphenylethene (TPE) emerge as attractive candidates to fulfill these tasks thanks to the unique aggregation&#8208;induced emission properties, tailorable structures, and responsiveness to external stimuli. This minireview focuses on cis and trans isomers of TPE derivatives that are functionalized with molecular recognition units for fluorescence detection, bioimaging and cancer therapy. The effects of molecular geometry on fluorescence property, target binding ability and biological activity are summarized. The feasibility to in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo switch molecular configuration and thus bio&#8208;activity is discussed. Finally, the future development and challenges are discussed in view of TPE&#8208;based stereoisomers for targeted sensing and imaging&#8208;guided modulation of biological processes.

         <dc:description>Singlet carbenes are extensively studied compounds capable of electrophilic, nucleophilic or ambiphillic behaviour. The ambiphilic reactivity of singlet carbenes have been conventionally observed in orthogonal planes. Here, we report a detailed bonding and reactivity study of a homobimetallic carbon complex [(MCp*)2(&#956;&#8208;NPh)(&#956;&#8208;C)] (1M, M = Fe, Ru, Os) that shows ambiphilicity in the same direction. The structure of this complex can be considered as two fused three&#8208;membered M&#8208;C&#8208;M and M&#8208;N&#8208;M rings. The bonding analysis suggests that these 17VE homobimetallic complexes have one formal M&#8208;M bond with a bridging carbene centre featuring a high lying spn&#8208;hybridised lone pair. Accordingly, the carbene centre shows high proton affinity and act as a good 2e&#8208; donor to Lewis acids and transition metal fragment. Apart from the transition metal non&#8208;bonding electrons, the &#960;&#8208;framework of M&#8208;C&#8208;M and M&#8208;N&#8208;M arms can be best described as 3c&#8208;2e&#8208; bonds. The two transition metals in the four&#8208;membered skeleton generate many low&#8208;lying, virtual orbitals. These low&#8208;lying virtual orbitals induces electron excitation from the spn&#8208;hybrid orbital in presence of H&#8208; and other 2e&#8208; donor ligands such as PMe3, NHC and CO. Hence, the spn&#8208;hybrid lone pair orbital shows &#963;&#8208;hole reactivity in presence of Lewis bases.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Characterization of a Rhenanaphthalene Isomer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract: Exploration of organometallic metallacycles has led to the development of various polycyclic compouds with fascinating structures, which could be used as functional materials. In this work, a new rhenanaphthalene isomer was isolated from the reaction of ReH5(PMe2Ph)3 with o&#8208;ethynylphenyl alkyne in the presence of excess HCl. Its structure was then identified using the single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and NMR spectroscopy. DFT studies suggest that its formation involves two protonation reactions and two migration reactions. This new rhenanaphthalene isomer enriches the family of metallacycles.</dc:description>

         <title>Small molecular fluorescent probes for Alzheimer's disease associated active species</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alzheimer&#8217;s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder and is the main cause of dementia worldwide. As the pathogenesis of AD is quite complicated, there is continuous attention to AD&#8208;associated active species, such as amyloid&#8208;&#946; plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, metal ions, reactive oxygen/nitrogen/sulphurspecies, cholinesterase, viscosity, formaldehyde and so on. To this end, a series of small molecular fluorescent probes for these active species have been explored for early diagnosis and even remedy of AD. Herein, we systematacially summarize the versatile fluorescent probes mainly in recent three years, including the relationship between the structure and properties as well as the targeted diagnosis and imaging application of all these fluorescent probes. Moreover, the challenges and perspectives of the AD&#8208;related fluorescent probes are briefly explicated. We firmly expect this review may provide guidance for constructing new AD&#8208;relevant fluorescent probes and promote the clinical study of AD.</dc:description>

         <title>From Proton to Boron: The Lewis Analogs of Protonated Br&#248;nsted Super Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Isolation and characterization of highly reactive intermediates are crucial to understand the nature of chemical reactivity. Accordingly, the reactivity of weakly coordinating anions (WCA), usually used to stabilized cationic super electrophiles are of fundamental interest. When a variety of WCA are known to form stable &#963;&#8208;complexes with a proton, inducing Br&#248;nsted super acidity, bis&#8208;coordinated weak&#8208;coordinated anions are much more elusive and considered as long&#8208;sought reactive species. In this work, the chemistry of borylated sulfate, triflimidate and triflate anions where scouted in details with the aim of synthetizing the unique analogs of protonated Br&#248;nsted superacids. Those complexes were formed by successive borylation with a 9&#8208;boratriptycene derived Lewis super acid paired with a weak coordinated anion, characterized in solution and in the solid state and exhibit unique structures and reactivities.</dc:description>

         <title>The Origin of Catalysis and Regioselectivity of Lewis Acid&#8208;Catalyzed Diels&#8208;Alder Reactions with Tropone</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have studied the uncatalyzed and Lewis acid (LA)&#8208;catalyzed cycloaddition reaction between tropone and 1,1&#8208;dimethoxyethene using dispersion&#8208;corrected relativistic density functional theory (DFT). The LA catalysts BF3, B(C6H5)3, and B(C6F5)3 efficiently accelerate both the competing [4+2] and [8+2] cycloaddition reactions by lowering the activation barrier up to 12 kcal mol&#8211;1 compared to the uncatalyzed reaction. Our study reveals that the LA catalyst promotes both cycloaddition reaction pathways by LUMO&#8208;lowering catalysis and demonstrates that Pauli&#8208;lowering catalysis is not always the operative catalytic mechanism in cycloaddition reactions. Judicious choice of the LA catalyst can effectively impart regiocontrol of the cycloaddition: B(C6H5)3 furnishes the [8+2] adduct while B(C6F5)3 yields the [4+2] adduct. We discovered that the regioselectivity shift finds its origin in the ability of the LA to absorb distortion by adopting a trigonal pyramidal geometry around the boron atom.</dc:description>

         <title>Studies on Structural Changes of Modified MWCNTs: Material for Electrochemical Monitoring of Antiviral Drug in Human Serum Samples</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Functionalized electrochemical material (Hg/KR&#8208;1@MWCNT) is a potentially selective material for real&#8208;time electrochemical monitoring of harmful antiviral drug 5&#8208;iodo&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;iododeoxyuridine (IUdR) levels in human serum samples with LOD 13.6&#8197;nM.







Abstract
The development of a universal approach for precisely tuning the electrochemical characteristics of conducting carbon nanotubes for tracking harmful agents in the human body with high selectivity and sensitivity remains a challenge. Herein, we describe a simplistic, versatile, and general approach to the construction of functionalized electrochemical material. The design of electrochemical material consists of (i) modification of multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) with dipodal naphthyl&#8208;based dipodal urea (KR&#8208;1) through non&#8208;covalent functionalization (KR&#8208;1@MWCNT) which enhances the dispersibility of MWCNT and hence conductivity, (ii) complexation of KR&#8208;1@MWCNT with Hg2+ accelerate the electron transfer in the material which amplify the detection response of functionalized material (i.&#8201;e., Hg/KR&#8208;1@MWCNT) towards various thymidine analogues. Further, the application of functionalized electrochemical material (Hg/KR&#8208;1@MWCNT) achieves real&#8208;time electrochemical monitoring of harmful antiviral drug 5&#8208;iodo&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;iododeoxyuridine (IUdR) levels in human serum for the first time.

         <title>The Adsorptive Separation of Ethylene from C2 Hydrocarbons by Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) have evoked much attention in gas storage and separation. In this review, recent advances in the adsorptive separation of ethylene from C2 hydrocarbons by metal&#8211;organic frameworks are summarized from the aspects of removing C2H2 from the C2H4, obtaining C2H4 from C2H4 and C2H6 mixtures, and separation of multi&#8208;component mixtures, respectively. In addition, some perceptions toward their development and challenge are introduced.







Abstract
Separating ethylene (C2H4) from the C2 hydrocarbons is of prime industrial importance for the process of high&#8208;purity C2H4 as an essential raw material in the petrochemical industry. Due to their similar physicochemical properties, the separation of C2H4 from the C2 hydrocarbons typically entails high&#8208;energy separation technologies such as cryogenic distillation and extraction. Alternatively, adsorption separation using metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are low&#8208;energy separation technologies that manufacture high&#8208;purity gas under mild conditions. In this review, we summarized the recent advances in MOFs for the separation and purification of C2H4 from the C2 hydrocarbons. The mechanisms underlying separating C2H4 from the C2 hydrocarbons using MOFs are also highlighted. This review also discussed the major challenges and developments of MOFs to separate C2H4 from the C2 hydrocarbons.

         <title>Chiral and Structural Polymorphism of Fibril Architectures of Homologous Lysozymes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multimodal approach involving chiroptical spectroscopies (VCD, ECD) and microscopic methods, in particular cryo&#8208;EM, was used to characterize chirality and structure of lysozyme amyloid fibrils. Rich polymorphism was observed for fibrils of hen egg white and human lysozymes with variations in the secondary structures, protofilament handedness and mesoscopic structures.







Abstract
Amyloid fibrils are fascinating and complex structures with the multilayered chiral organization. Using the multimodal methodology, including VCD, ECD, cryo&#8208;EM, and TEM, we characterized in detail different levels of organization (secondary structure/protofilament/mesoscopic structure) of amyloid fibrils prepared from proteins highly homologous in the structure (hen egg white and human lysozymes). Our results demonstrate that small changes in the native protein structure or preparation conditions translate into significant differences in the handedness and architecture of the formed fibrils at various levels of their complexity. In particular, fibrils of hen egg white and human lysozymes obtained in&#8197;vitro at the same preparation conditions, possess different secondary structure, protofilament twist and ultrastructure. Yet, formed fibrils adopted a relatively similar mesoscopic structure, as observed in high&#8208;resolution 3D cryo&#8208;EM, scarcely used up to now for fibrils obtained in&#8197;vitro in denaturing condition. Our results add to other puzzling experiments implicating the indeterministic nature of fibril formation.

         <title>Autonomous and Programmable Reorganization of DNA&#8208;Based Polymers Using Redox Chemistry
</title>

Programmable DNA assembly: Here we have rationally re&#8208;engineered DNA tiles that can co&#8208;assemble into tubular structures and can be orthogonally deactivated/re&#8208;activated with redox&#8208;controlled DNA fuel strands. By controlling the relative rate of re&#8208;assembly of each tile, we can regulate the tiles distribution in the final co&#8208;polymer. The approach can be coupled with enzymatic fuel&#8208;degradation reactions and responds to external stimuli (i.&#8201;e., pH) providing an additional level of control in the reconfiguration of DNA&#8208;polymers.







Abstract
We demonstrate here a strategy that allows the programmable and autonomous reorganization of self&#8208;assembled DNA polymers using redox chemistry. We have rationally designed different DNA monomers (tiles) that can co&#8208;assemble into tubular structures. The tiles can be orthogonally activated/deactivated with disulfide&#8208;linked DNA fuel strands that are degraded over time upon reduction because of the presence of a reducing agent in the system. The concentration of the disulfide fuels determines the activation kinetics of each DNA tile, which controls the degree of order/disorder in the formed co&#8208;polymer. The disulfide&#8208;reduction pathway can be employed together with enzymatic fuel&#8208;degradation pathways providing an additional level of control in the re&#8208;organization of DNA structures. Taking advantage of the different pH&#8208;sensitivities of disulfide&#8208;thiol and enzymatic reactions, we show that we can control the order in DNA&#8208;based co&#8208;polymers as a function of pH.

         <title>N&#8208;Doped Carbon Confined NiCo Alloy Hollow Spheres as an Efficient and Durable Oxygen Electrocatalyst for Zinc&#8208;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
NiCo@NC HS electrocatalyst with hollow structure have been constructed as a cost&#8208;efficient/durability bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts for Zn&#8208;air batteries. The synergistic effect in NiCo@NC HS can promote the activation of O2* and OH* intermediates by modulating the electronic structure, and resulting enhanced OER/ORR activities.







Abstract
Exploring cost&#8208;efficient/durability bifunctional electrocatalysts are of upmost importance for the practical application of metal&#8211;air batteries. However, preparing bifunctional electrocatalysts with the above three advantages remains conceptually challenging. This work reports the preparation of N&#8208;doped carbon confined NiCo alloy hollow spheres (NiCo@N&#8722;C HS) as bifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst for Zn&#8208;air battery with a higher energy density (788.7&#8197;mWh&#8201;gZn&#8722;1) and outstanding cycling stability (over 200&#8197;h), which are more durable than the commercialized Pt/C+RuO2&#8208;based device. Electrochemical results and theoretical calculation demonstrate that the synergy in the NiCo@N&#8722;C accelerates the electronic transmission for improving activation of O2* and OH* intermediates and optimizing reacted free energy pathways, while the hollow structures exposure more active sites for improving the reaction kinetics and enhancing the activity of ORR/OER reaction. This work provides crucial understanding for constructing low&#8208;cost transition metal&#8208;based catalyst to overcome the efficiency and durability barriers of metal&#8208;air batteries for widespread applications.

         <title>Quest of Quadruple Bonding Between Two Main&#8208;Group Atoms in AeB&#8722; and AeC (Ae=Ca, Sr, Ba) and the Role of d Orbitals of Heavier Alkaline&#8208;Earth Atoms in Covalent Interactions</title>

         <dc:description>
The chemical bonds in the electronic triplet (3&#931;&#8722;) ground state of the alkaline earth boride anions AeB&#8722; (Ae=Ca, Sr, Ba) have four strongly polarized bonding orbitals, namely two doubly occupied &#963; orbitals HOMO and HOMO&#8208;1 and a pair of singly occupied degenerate &#960; orbitals SOMO and SOMO&#8217; with sd hybridized atomic orbitals of the atoms Ae.







Abstract
Quantum chemical calculations using ab initio methods at the MRCI+Q(6,8)/def2&#8208;QZVPP and CCSD(T)/def2&#8208;QZVPP levels as well as density functional theory are reported for the diatomic molecules AeB&#8722; and isoelectronic AeC (Ae=Ca, Sr, Ba). The boride anions AeB&#8722; have an electronic triplet (3&#931;&#8722;) ground state. The quintet (5&#931;&#8722;) state is 5.8&#8211;12.3&#8197;kcal/mol higher in energy and the singlet (1&#916;) state is 13.1&#8211;15.3&#8197;kcal/mol above the triplet. The isoelectronic AeC molecules are also predicted to have a low&#8208;lying triplet (3&#931;&#8722;) state but the quintet (5&#931;&#8722;) state is only 2.2&#8197;kcal/mol (SrC) and 2.9&#8197;kcal/mol (CaC) above the triplet state. The triplet (3&#931;&#8722;) and quintet (5&#931;&#8722;) states of BaC are nearly isoenergetic. All systems have rather strong bonds. The calculated bond dissociation energies of the triplet (3&#931;&#8722;) state are between De=38.3&#8211;41.7&#8197;kcal/mol for AeB&#8722; and De=49.4&#8211;57.5&#8197;kcal/mol for AeC. The barium species have always the strongest bonds whereas the calcium and strontium compounds have similar BDEs. The bonding analysis indicates that there is little charge migration in AeB&#8722; in the direction Ae&#8594;B&#8722; where the alkaline earth atoms carry positive charges between 0.09&#8197;e&#8211;0.22&#8197;e. The positive charges at the Ae atoms are much larger in AeC where the charge migration Ae&#8594;C is between 0.90&#8197;e&#8211;0.91&#8197;e. A detailed analysis of the interatomic interactions with the EDA&#8208;NOCV method shows that all diatomic species AeB&#8722; and AeC are built from dative interactions between Ae (1S, ns2) and B&#8722; or C (3P, 2&#8197;s22p&#960;12p&#960;&#8242;1). The eventually formed bonds in AeC are better described in terms of interactions between the ions Ae+ (2S, ns1)+C&#8722; (4S, 2&#8197;s22p&#960;12p&#960;&#8242;12p&#963;1). Inspection of the orbital interactions suggests that the alkaline earth atoms Ca, Sr, Ba use mainly their (n&#8208;1)d AOs besides the (n)s AOs for the covalent bonds. This creates a second energetically low&#8208;lying &#963;&#8208;bonding MO in the molecules, which feature valence orbitals with the order &#981;1 (&#963;&#8208;bonding)&lt;&#981;2 (&#963;&#8208;bonding)&lt;&#981;3 (degenerate &#960;&#8208;bonding). All four occupied valence MOs of AeB&#8722; and AeC are bonding orbitals. Since the degenerate &#960; orbitals &#981;3 are only singly occupied, the formal bond order is three.

The eventually formed bonds in AeC are better described in terms of interactions between the ions Ae&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;S, ns&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;)+C&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; (&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;S, 2&#8197;s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2p&lt;sub&gt;&#960;&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;2p&lt;sub&gt;&#960;&#8242;&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;2p&lt;sub&gt;&#963;&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;). Inspection of the orbital interactions suggests that the alkaline earth atoms Ca, Sr, Ba use mainly their (n-1)d AOs besides the (n)s AOs for the covalent bonds. This creates a second energetically low-lying &#963;-bonding MO in the molecules, which feature valence orbitals with the order &#981;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; (&#963;-bonding)&amp;lt;&#981;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (&#963;-bonding)&amp;lt;&#981;&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (degenerate &#960;-bonding). All four occupied valence MOs of AeB&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and AeC are bonding orbitals. Since the degenerate &#960; orbitals &#981;&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; are only singly occupied, the formal bond order is three.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Zinc&#8208;Catalyzed Hydrocyanation of Ynamides and Photoisomerization, a General and Selective Access to E and Z Trisubstituted &#945;&#8208;Enamidonitriles</title>

         <dc:description>
Trisubstituted E&#8208;2&#8208;amidoacrylonitriles are produced by direct hydrocyanation of ynamides. Z isomers can be obtained selectively using a thermo&#8208;neutral catalyst&#8208;free photoisomerization.







Abstract
The fully regio&#8208; and stereoselective Zn&#8208;catalyzed hydrocyanation of ynamides is reported and represents a general access to various trisubstituted E&#8208;&#945;&#8208;enamidonitriles. The catalyst&#8208;free photoisomerization selectively yields the energetically comparable Z&#8208;stereoisomer. Finally, the synthetic potential of these new &#945;&#8208;enamidonitriles was evaluated through the synthesis of original heterocycles.

         <title>Organic&#8208;Inorganic Phenolic/POSS Hybrids Provide Highly Ordered Mesoporous Structures Templated by High Thermal Stability of PS&#8208;b&#8208;P4VP Diblock Copolymer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mesoporous PDDSQ hybrids were prepared by using PS&#8208;b&#8208;P4VP as a template by mediated the hydrogen bonding interaction through the hydroxyl (OH) groups of PDDSQ hybrid with the pyridine group of the P4VP block. The highly ordered structures reveal the high surface area and high pore volume that could be used in supercapacitor application.







Abstract
Anionic living polymerization was used to prepare a diblock copolymer of poly(styrene&#8208;b&#8208;4&#8208;vinyl pyridine) (PS&#8208;b&#8208;P4VP), and a phenolic resin with a double&#8208;decker silsesquioxane (DDSQ) cage structure was used to form a phenolic/DDSQ hybrid (PDDSQ&#8208;30 with 30&#8197;wt.% DDSQ). Strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding could be confirmed through the hydroxyl (OH) groups of PDDSQ hybrid with the pyridine group of the P4VP block in PDDSQ&#8208;30/PS&#8208;b&#8208;P4VP blends based on Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analyses, where increasing PDDSQ concentrations resulted in a higher proportion of hydrogen&#8208;bonded pyridine groups. After thermal polymerization at 180&#8201;&#176;C, the self&#8208;assembled structures of these PDDSQ/PS&#8208;b&#8208;P4VP blends were revealed by data from small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), where the d&#8208;spacing increased with raising PDDSQ concentration. Because relatively higher thermal stability of the PDDSQ hybrid than pure phenolic resin and PS&#8208;b&#8208;P4VP template, we can obtain the long ranger order of mesoporous PDDSQ hybrids after removing the PS&#8208;b&#8208;P4VP template, which reveals the high surface area and high pore volume with cylindrical and spherical structures corresponding to the PDDSQ compositions that are rarely observed by using pure phenolic resin as the matrix and could be used in supercapacitor application.

         <title>Synthesis of Unprecedented &#945;/&#946;&#8208;Alternate (1&#8594;4)&#8208;Glucans via Stereoselective Iterative Glycosylation</title>

A robust glycosylation protocol for the stereoselective construction of either 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;&#945;&#8208; or 1,2&#8208;trans&#8208;&#946;&#8208;glucosidic linkage is disclosed, employing same donors (glycosyl N&#8208;phenyltrifluoroacetimidates) and single promoter (TMSNTf2) in different solvents (CH2Cl2/nitrile vs. CH2Cl2/THF), which enables the efficient synthesis of &#945;/&#946;&#8208;alternate (1&#8594;4)&#8208;glucans, an unprecedented hybrid of amylose and cellulose.







Abstract
Glucans are major biomaterials on the earth, with &#945;&#8208;(1&#8594;4)&#8208;glucans (i.&#8201;e., amylose) and &#946;&#8208;(1&#8594;4)&#8208;glucans (i.&#8201;e., cellulose) being the most abundant ones, which are relevant to energy storage and structural function, respectively. Interestingly, (1&#8594;4)&#8208;glucans with alternate &#945;/&#946;&#8208;linkages, namely herewith amycellulose, have never been disclosed in nature. Here we report a robust glycosylation protocol for the stereoselective construction of the 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;&#945;&#8208; and 1,2&#8208;trans&#8208;&#946;&#8208;glucosidic linkages, which employs an optimal combination of glycosyl N&#8208;phenyltrifluoroacetimidates as donors, TMSNTf2 as promoter, CH2Cl2/nitrile or CH2Cl2/THF as solvents. A broad substrate scope has been demonstrated by coupling five imidate donors with eight glycosyl acceptors, in which most of the glycosylations lead to high yield and exclusively 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;&#945;&#8208; or 1,2&#8208;trans&#8208;&#946;&#8208;selectivity. Applying this glycosylation protocol and with an iterative manner, the unprecedented &#945;/&#946;&#8208;alternate (1&#8594;4)&#8208;glucans up to a 16&#8208;mer have been synthesized. Differently from amylose, that adopts a compact helicoidal arrangement, the synthetic amycellulose features an extended ribbon&#8208;like conformation, comparable to the extended shape of cellulose.

         <title>Oxidation State Tuning of Room Temperature Phosphorescence and Delayed Fluorescence in Phenothiazine and Phenothiazine&#8208;5,5&#8208;dioxide Dimers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Relationships between prompt fluorescence, room temperature phosphorescence and thermally activated delayed fluorescence are established in a series of dimers of phenothiazine and its chemically oxidized congener phenothiazine&#8208;5.5&#8208;dioxide. This provides detailed insights into the interplay between the singlet and triplet manifolds of these heterocycles and emphasizes the complex functional electronic structure of phenothiazines.







Abstract
Heterocyclic dimers consisting of combinations of butterfly&#8208;shaped phenothiazine (PTZ) and its chemically oxidized form phenothiazine&#8208;5,5&#8208;dioxide (PTZ(SO2)) have been synthesized. A twist is imposed across the dimers by ortho&#8208;substituents including methyl ethers, sulfides and sulfones. X&#8208;ray crystallography, cyclic voltammetry and optical spectroscopy, underpinned by computational studies, have been employed to study the interplay between the oxidation state, conformational restriction, and emission mechanisms including thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and room temperature phosphorescence (RTP). While the PTZ(SO2) dimers are simple fluorophores, the presence of PTZ induces triplet&#8208;mediated emission with a mixed PTZ&#8208;PTZ(SO2) dimer displaying concentration dependent hallmarks of both TADF and RTP.

         <title>Towards a Rational Design of Antibody&#8208;Recruiting Molecules through a Computational Microscopy View of their Interactions with the Target Antibody</title>

Computational modelling of the interaction between antibody and hapten predict ternary complex formation by hapten&#8208;based chimeric antibody recruiting molecules.







Abstract
Antibody recruiting molecules (ARMs) are an innovative class of chimeric molecules, consisting of an antibody&#8208;binding ligand (ABL) and a target&#8208;binding ligand (TBL). ARMs mediate ternary complex formation between a target cell of interest for elimination and endogenous antibodies that are present in human serum. Clustering of fragment crystallizable (Fc) domains on the surface of antibody&#8208;bound cells mediate destruction of the target cell by innate immune effector mechanisms. ARMs are typically designed by conjugating small molecule haptens to a (macro)molecular scaffold, without considering the structure of the respective anti&#8208;hapten antibody. Here we report on a computational molecular modeling methodology that allows for studying the close contacts between ARMs and the anti&#8208;hapten antibody, considering (1) the spacer length between ABL and TBL; (2) the number of ABL and TBL, and (3) the molecular scaffold onto which these are positioned. Our model predicts the difference in binding modes of the ternary complex and predicts which ARMs are optimal recruiters. Avidity measurements of the ARM&#8208;antibody complex and ARM&#8208;mediated antibody recruitment to cell surfaces in&#8197;vitro confirmed these computational modeling predictions. This kind of multiscale molecular modelling holds potential for design of drug molecules that rely on antibody binding for their mechanism of action.

         <title>Photomodulation on Active Sites of Adsorbents: Controllable Adsorption Processes with Improved Efficiency</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photomodulation on adsorptive sites is an emerging strategy to achieve selective adsorption and efficient desorption. Compared with traditional adsorption techniques, active sites of photoresponsive adsorbents can be flexibly regulated by light irradiation based on the demands of adsorption process. This concept summarizes recent advances in this field and highlights the exquisite strategies of photoregulation on active sites.







Abstract
Adsorption is a widely applied technique in producing high&#8208;purity chemicals with advantages of low energy consumption, high selectivity, and mild operating conditions. However, traditional adsorbents have inflexible properties and suffer from the trade&#8208;off between selective adsorption and efficient desorption. Recently, the emerging photoresponsive adsorbents have provided new avenues for adsorption techniques. Active sites of photoresponsive adsorbents can be regulated through steric hindrance or tunable adsorbent&#8208;adsorbate interactions. Therefore, variation in adsorptive capacity is able to readily achieve through photomodulation, and the corresponding adsorption/desorption cycles are energy&#8208;saving. This concept mainly summarizes recent efforts on the fabrication and application of photoresponsive adsorbents with tunable active sites. Also, the future opportunities and critical challenges of photoregulation on adsorptive sites are presented.

         <title>Pyridone&#8208;Doped Acenes with Improved Stability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of monopyridone&#8208;doped acenes from anthracene to heptacene with improved stability have been synthesized. The pyridone unit demonstrates different nature in the doped acenes depending on the molecular length. The capacity of electron transport between the face&#8208;to&#8208;face stacked acene planes is preserved.







Abstract
Besides the peripheral modification, the introduction of heteroatoms to modulate the property of longer acenes with improved chemical stability has been extensively studied for their potential applications in organic electronics. However, the utilization of 4&#8208;pyridone, a common unit in the air&#8208; and photo&#8208;stable acridone and quinacridone, to decorate higher acenes with increased stability has not been realized yet. Here we present the synthesis of a series of monopyridone&#8208;doped acenes up to heptacene via the palladium&#8208;catalyzed Buchwald&#8208;Hartwig amination of aniline and dibromo&#8208;ketone. The effect of pyridone on the property of doped acenes were investigated experimentally and computationally. With the &#960;&#8208;extension of doped acenes, the pyridone ring shows the weakened conjugation and gradual loss of aromaticity. The doped acenes demonstrate enhanced stability in solution and maintain the electronic communication between the acene planes.

         <title>Engineering the BASHY Dye Platform toward Architectures with Responsive Fluorescence</title>

The structural and electronic extension of the boronic&#8208;acid&#8208;derived salicylidenehydrazone (BASHY) dye platform yields stimuli&#8208;responsive fluorophores with applications in fluorescence lifetime imaging of live cells.







Abstract
A set of nine boronic&#8208;acid&#8208;derived salicylidenehydrazone (BASHY) complexes has been synthesized in good to very good chemical yields in a versatile three&#8208;component reaction. In an extension to previous reports on this dye platform, the focus was put on the electronic modification of the &#8220;vertical&#8221; positions of the salicylidenehydrazone backbone. This enabled the observation of fluorescence quenching by photoinduced electron transfer (PeT), which can be reverted by the addition of acid in organic solvent (OFF&#8208;ON fluorescence switching). The resulting emission is observed in the green&#8208;to&#8208;orange spectral region (maxima at 520&#8211;590&#8197;nm). In contrast, under physiological pH conditions in water, the PeT process is inherently decativated, thereby enabling the observation of fluorescence in the red&#8208;to&#8208;NIR region (maxima at 650&#8211;680&#8197;nm) with appreciable quantum yields and lifetimes. The latter characteristic supported the application of the dyes in fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) of live A549 cells.

         <title>Rationalizing the Optimization of Detergents for Membrane Protein Purification</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tailored detergents. Guidelines are introduced based on the hydrophilic&#8208;lipophilic balance (HLB) concept, which was established by Griffin in 1949, to enable the directed structural optimization of detergents for the in&#8197;vitro investigation of membrane protein&#8208;lipid interactions.







Abstract
Membrane protein purification by means of detergents is key to isolating membrane&#8208;bound therapeutic targets. The role of the detergent structure in this process, however, is not well understood. Detergents are optimized empirically, leading to failed preparations, and thereby raising costs. Here we evaluate the utility of the hydrophilic&#8208;lipophilic balance (HLB) concept, which was introduced by Griffin in 1949, for guiding the optimization of the hydrophobic tail in first&#8208;generation, dendritic oligoglycerol detergents ([G1] OGDs). Our findings deliver qualitative HLB guidelines for rationalizing the optimization of detergents. Moreover, [G1] OGDs exhibit strongly delipidating properties, regardless of the structure of the hydrophobic tail, which delivers a methodological enabling step for investigating binding strengths of endogenous lipids and their role for membrane protein oligomerization. Our findings will facilitate the analysis of challenging drug targets in the future.

Guidelines are introduced based on the hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (HLB) concept, which was established by Griffin in 1949, to enable the directed structural optimization of detergents for the in&#8197;vitro investigation of membrane protein-lipid interactions.

         <title>Selective Valorization of Bio&#8208;derived Levulinic Acid and Its Derivatives into Hydrocarbons and Biochemicals by Using Hydrosilylation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Designing a new methodology for the valorization of biomass is of the utmost importance for creating a sustainable future. In this work, we report an efficient hydrosilylation&#8208;based strategy for the selective valorization of biomass&#8208;derived levulinic acid and its derivatives into value&#8208;added chemicals such as pentane&#8208;1,4&#8208;diol, pentan&#8208;2&#8208;ol, 2&#8208;MTHF and even C5 hydrocarbons by using cost&#8208;effective and nontoxic silanes and the commercially available catalyst B(C6F5)3 at room temperature.







Abstract
Herein we report an efficient hydrosilylation strategy to selectively defunctionalize biomass&#8208;derived levulinic acid into value&#8208;added chemicals such as pentane&#8208;1,4&#8208;diol, pentan&#8208;2&#8208;ol, 2&#8208;MTHF and C5 hydrocarbons by using cost&#8208;effective silanes and the commercially available catalyst B(C6F5)3 at room temperature. All reactions work well in chlorinated solvents but, as a greener alternative, most reactions can be run in toluene or solvent&#8208;less.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Mediated Photocatalytic Deracemization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Deracemization is like magic. Chiral catalysts and visible light act like a magician and his magic props, leading to deracemization as a magical tool that can convert a racemic compound into one of its enantiomers with 100&#8201;% atomic efficiency. In their Review (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202204029), Z. Jiang and co&#8208;workers provide a comprehensive overview of the advances in this attractive area, with a systematic summary and discussion.

         <title>Substituent Effects in Bioorthogonal Diels&#8211;Alder Reactions of 1,2,4,5&#8208;Tetrazines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fundamental mechanism driving the high reactivity of mono&#8208;substituted tetrazines is explored through substituent effects in the bioorthogonal Diels&#8211;Alder reactions of 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrazines. Through computational analysis, the study unveils how an asynchronous approach of the reaction partner can mitigate adverse interactions during the reaction, leading to a reduction in the reaction barrier height. More information can be found in the Research Article by D. Svatunek and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202300345).

         <title>Base&#8208;Triggered Oxidative Addition to Gold</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The coordination of secondary phosphine oxides (SPO) was shown to efficiently promote the activation of C(sp2)&#8211;I bonds by gold, as long as a base is added (NEt3, K2CO3). These transformations stand as a new type of chelation&#8208;assisted oxidative addition to gold. The role of the base and the influence of the electronic properties of the P&#8208;ligand were analyzed computationally. Accordingly, the oxidative addition was found to be dominated by Au&#8594;(Ar&#8211;I) backdonation. In this case, gold behaves similarly to palladium, suggesting that the inverse electron flow reported previously (with prevailing (Ar&#8211;I)&#8594;Au donation, resulting in faster reactions of electron&#8208;enriched substrates) is a specific feature of electron&#8208;deficient cationic gold(I) complexes. The reaction gives straightforward access to (P=O,C)&#8208;cyclometallated Au(III) complexes. The possibility to chemically derivatize the SPO moiety at Au(III) was substantiated by protonation and silylation reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Deoxygenative Radical Boration of Inert Amides via a Combination of Relay and Cooperative Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>One of the most challenging tasks in organic synthesis is to develop novel methodologies for rapid construction of complex molecules starting from easily available yet inert raw materials. In this context, multi&#8208;catalysis strategies have attracted great attention in the discovery of new reactivity profiles that may allow access to many difficult or unattainable transformations. So far the deoxygenative functionalization of ubiquitous amides is usually achieved by nucleophilic attack on the imine or iminium ion intermediate formed via activation of the C=O bond, these functionalization reagents were often confined to C&#8208;based nucleophiles, which largely limited the diversity of the resultant amines. Herein, we disclose a combined strategy of relay and cooperative catalysis with a triple iridium&#8208;photoredox&#8208;organocatalysis system to achieve an unprecedented reductive boration of amides, affording valuable &#945;&#8208;amino boron products which are viable building blocks. In this transformation, the Ir&#8208;catalyzed semi&#8208;reduction of amides is successfully incorporated with photo&#8208;organic catalyzed nucleophilic boryl radical addition, thus delivering the corresponding &#945;&#8208;boryl amines in high efficiency.</dc:description>

         <title>Intermolecular Dearomative 1,2&#8208;Amination/Carbonylation via Nucleophilic Addition of Simple Amines to Arene &#960;&#8208;Bonds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The incorporation of the privileged amino functionality is of paramount importance in organic synthesis. In contrast to the well&#8208;developed amination methods for alkenes, the dearomative amination of arenes is largely underexplored due to the inherently inert reactivity of arene &#960;&#8208;bonds and selectivity challenges. Herein, we report an intermolecular dearomative aminofunctionalization via direct nucleophilic addition of simple amines to chromium&#8208;bound arenes. This multicomponent 1,2&#8208;amination/carbonylation reaction enables rapid access to complicated alicyclic compounds containing amino and amide functionalities from benzene derivatives under CO&#8208;gas&#8208;free conditions, which also represents the first application of nitrogen&#8208;based nucleophiles in &#951;6&#8208;coordination&#8208;induced arene dearomatizations.</dc:description>

         <title>Dichotomy of Delocalization/Localization and Charge&#8208;Shift Bonding in Germanazene and Its Heavier Group 14 Analogues: A Valence Bond Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract:&#160;We present here a valence bond analysis of structure and &#960;&#8208;delocalization in Ge3(NH)3, which models germanazene that was prepared by Power et al. To get a broader perspective, we explore the entire E3(NH)3 series (E=C, Si, Ge, Sn, Pb). Thus, while (4n+2)&#960; systems of carbon rings are aromatic with cyclic &#960;&#8208;delocalization, the E3(NH)3 rings are dominated by a nonbonded structure, wherein &#960;&#8208;lone pairs are localized on the N atoms. Nevertheless, these molecules enjoy large covalent&#8208;ionic resonance energies of 153.0, 86.6, 74.2, 61.2, and 58.9 kcal/mol, respectively, for E= C, Si, Ge, Sn, Pb. The covalent&#8208;ionic mixing in E3(NH)3 creates &#960;&#8208;systems, which are stabilized by charge&#8208;shift bonding. Thus, unlike in benzene, in Ge3(NH)3 delocalization of &#960;&#8208;electron pairs of the N atoms is primarily confined to the domains of their adjacent Ge atoms. These features carry over to the substituted germanazene, Ge3(NAr)3 (Ar = Ph).</dc:description>

         <title>Photothermal Perylene Bisimide Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Gels formed using a perylene bisimide (PBI) as a low molecular weight gelator can show the photothermal effect. Formation of the PBI radical anion results in new absorption bands forming, meaning that subsequent irradiation with a wavelength of light overlapping with the new absorption band leads to heating of the gel. This approach can be used to heat the gel, as well as the surrounding milieu. We show how we can use electrochemical methods as well as multicomponent systems to form the radical anion without the need for UV light, and how we can use the photothermal effect to induce phase transitions in the solutions above the gels by exploiting photothermal behavior.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Divalent lanthanoid pseudo&#8208;Grignard reagents PhLnBr (Ln = Sm, Eu and Yb) can be easily prepared by the oxidative addition of bromobenzene (PhBr) with lanthanoid metals in tetrahydrofuran (THF). PhLnBr reacts with bulky N,N&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;di&#8208;isopropylphenyl) formamidine (DippFormH) to generate LnII complexes, namely [Ln(DippForm)Br(thf)3]2&#215;6thf&#160; (1; Sm, 2; Eu), and [Yb(DippForm)Br(thf)2]2&#215;2thf (3; Yb). Samarium and europium (in 1 and 2) are seven coordinate, whereas ytterbium (in 3) is six coordinate, and all are bromine&#8208;bridged dimers. When PhLnBr reacts with 3,5&#8208;diphenylpyrazole (Ph2pzH), both divalent (5; [Eu(Ph2pz)2(thf)4]) and trivalent (4 a; [Sm(Ph2pz)3(thf)3]&#215;3thf, 4b; [Sm(Ph2pz)3(dme)2]&#215;dme) complexes are obtained. In the monomeric compounds 4(a, b), samarium is nine coordinate but europium is eight coordinate in 5.

         <title>A brick&#8208;wall topological 2D covalent organic framework constructed from an H&#8208;shaped &#8220;two&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; monomer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As an emerging porous crystalline material, covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have received considerable research interests in terms of exploring new architectures and functions. Herein, we developed an unprecedented &#8220;H&#8208;shaped&#8221; monomer, upon self&#8208;polycondensation, which facilely produced a benzoimidazole&#8208;based COF (H&#8208;BIm&#8208;COF) with a rarely reported &#8220;brick&#8208;wall&#8221; topology. H&#8208;BIm&#8208;COF displayed high crystallinity, nano&#8208;sized porosity, large BET surface area of 507 m2 g&#8208;1, and high thermal and chemical stabilities.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;As an emerging porous crystalline material, covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have received considerable research interests in terms of exploring new architectures and functions. Herein, we developed an unprecedented &#8220;H-shaped&#8221; monomer, upon self-polycondensation, which facilely produced a benzoimidazole-based COF (H-BIm-COF) with a rarely reported &#8220;brick-wall&#8221; topology. H-BIm-COF displayed high crystallinity, nano-sized porosity, large BET surface area of 507 m2 g-1, and high thermal and chemical stabilities. Interestingly, H-BIm-COF based membranes showed selective permeability towards different solvents related to the size and polarity of the guest molecule. Additionally, initial study suggested the COF displayed excellent rejection efficiency towards ionic dyes, e.g. chromium black T (99.7%) and rhodamine B (97.3%). This work provides insights into developing new topological COFs by designing monomers with new configuration.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>Aromatic ring fusion on BODIPY core can effectively tune its electronic property, and red&#8208;shift the absorption and emission wavelength. In this work, we report that a one&#8208;pot Pd(II) catalyzed multiple C&#8208;H activation to access acenaphtho[b]&#8208;fused BODIPYs though the reaction of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsubstituted&#8208;BODIPYs and 1,8&#8208;dibromonaphthalenes.

Notably, these acenaphtho[b]&#8208;fused BODIPYs exhibited well&#8208;defined self&#8208;aggregation behavior in water/THF mixture, and for instance, the absorption of 3a was red&#8208;shifted by 53 to 693 nm after forming&#160;aggregates.</dc:description>

         <title>Photophysical Behavior of Self&#8208;Organizing Derivatives of 10&#8208; and 12&#8208;Vertex p&#8208;Carboranes, and their Bicyclo[2.2.2]octane and Benzene Analogues</title>

         <dc:description>
Electronic spectroscopy and DFT analyses demonstrate greater electronic interactions with &#960; substituents for 10&#8208; than 12&#8208;vertex sigma aromatic carborane.







Abstract
Four series of isostructural derivatives of 3&#8208;ring liquid crystalline derivatives containing p&#8208;carboranes (12&#8208;vertex A, and 10&#8208;vertex B), bicyclo[2.2.2]octane (C), or benzene (D) as the variable structural element were investigated for their mesogenic behavior and electronic interactions. Comparative studies demonstrated that the effectiveness of elements A&#8211;D in stabilization of the mesophase typically increases in the order: B&lt;A&lt;C&lt;D. Absorption and emission spectroscopy for the four series and reference compounds augmented with DFT computational results revealed that the degree of electronic interactions with the connected benzene &#960; system increases in the order C&lt;A&lt;B&lt;D. Emission spectra exhibit large Stokes&#8217; shifts for 10&#8208;vertex derivatives (B) in solutions and in the solid state. Spectroscopic characterization was supplemented with polarization electronic spectroscopy and solvatochromic studies of selected series. Overall, 12&#8208;vertex p&#8208;carborane A acts as an electron withdrawing auxochromic substituent with interactions similar to those of bicyclo[2.2.2]octane, although capable of accepting some electron density in the excited state. In contrast, 10&#8208;vertex p&#8208;carborane B is much more interactive with the &#960;&#8208;aromatic electron manifold and exhibits greater ability to participate in photo&#8208;induced CT processes. Absorption and emission energies and quantum yields (1&#8208;51&#8201;%) for carborane derivatives, representing the D&#8722;A&#8722;D system, were compared to those of their isoelectronic zwitterionic analogues (the A&#8722;D&#8722;A system). The analysis is supplemented with four single&#8208;crystal XRD structures.

         <title>Selective Construction of Molecular Borromean Rings and [2]Catenane Utilizing Ether Bipyridyl Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of discrete Cp* Rh&#8208;based structures were constructed by selecting four ether bipyridyl ligands and three half&#8208;sandwich rhodium (III) bimetallic construction units. This study demonstrates a strategy to convert a binuclear D&#8208;shaped to a [2]catenane by changing the length of bridged ligands. Selective synthesis of [2]catenane and molecular Borromean rings can be achieved under similar conditions.







Abstract
A series of Cp*Rh&#8208;based discrete architectures was constructed by selecting four ether bipyridyl ligands and three half&#8208;sandwich rhodium(III) bimetallic construction units, respectively. This study demonstrates a strategy for making the transition from a binuclear D&#8208;shaped ring to a tetranuclear [2]catenane by adjusting the length of bipyridyl ligands. In addition, changing the position on the naphthyl group of the bipyridyl ligand from 2,6&#8208; to 1,5&#8208;position substitution can realize the selective synthesis of [2]catenane and Borromean rings under similar conditions. The above&#8208;mentioned constructions have been determined via X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis, detailed NMR techniques, electrospray ionization&#8208;time&#8208;of&#8208;flight/mass spectrometry analysis, and elemental analysis.

         <title>Elucidating Conformational Dynamics and Thermostability of Designed Aromatic Clusters Using Protein Cages</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aromatic residues form clusters in proteins and play essential roles in biological systems. However, the stabilization mechanism and dynamic behavior of aromatic clusters remain unclear. Here, we describe designed aromatic interactions confined within a protein cage to reveal how aromatic clusters affect protein stability. The crystal structures and calorimetric measurements indicate that the formation of inter&#8208;subunit phenylalanine clusters enhance the interactions of inter&#8208;helices and increase the melting temperature. Theoretical calculations suggest that this is caused by the transformation of the T&#8208;shaped geometry into &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking at high temperatures, and the hydration entropic gain. Thus, the isolated nano&#8208;environment in a protein cage allows reconstruction and detailed analysis of multiple clustering residues for elucidating the mechanisms of various biomolecular interactions in nature which can be applied to design of bionanomaterials.</dc:description>

         <title>Transition Metal Vacancy in Layered Cathode Materials for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 22, April 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This concept focuses on the formation of transition metal (TM) vacancy, vacancy contained configurations for triggering oxygen redox, advanced characterization techniques for detecting TM vacancy and viable strategies to improve the reversibility of vacancy&#8208;induced oxygen redox for layered cathode materials of sodium&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
Anionic redox has been considered as a promising strategy to break the capacity limitation of cathode materials that solely relies on the intrinsic cationic redox in secondary batteries. Vacancy, as a kind of defect, can be introduced into transition metal layer to trigger oxygen redox, thus enhancing the energy density of layer&#8208;structured cathode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries. Herein, the formation process, recent progress in working mechanisms of triggering oxygen redox, as well as advanced characterization techniques for transition metal (TM) vacancy were overviewed and discussed. Strategies applied to stabilize the vacancy contained structures and harness the reversible oxygen redox were summarized. Furthermore, the challenges and prospects for further understanding TM vacancy were particularly emphasized.

         <title>Ultrafast Electron Transfer Dynamics of Organic Polymer Nanoparticles with Graphene Oxide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 22, April 18, 2023. </description>

Poly&#8208;3&#8208;hexylthiophene nanoparticles with graphene oxide (p3ht NPs&#8208;GO &amp; p3ht NPs&#8208;RGO) were prepared, and revealed the properties of charge transfer complexes. Notably, ultrafast electron transfer in those composites was reported for the first time, and faster electron transfer in p3ht NPs&#8208;RGO implied that p3ht NPs&#8208;RGO might have higher application values for organic polymer solar cells.







Abstract
We prepared organic polymer poly&#8208;3&#8208;hexylthiophene (p3ht) nanoparticles (NPs) and graphene oxide (GO)/reduced graphene oxide (RGO) composites p3ht NPs&#8208;GO/RGO by using the reprecipitation method. We demonstrated that GO/RGO could improve the ordering and planarity of p3ht chains as well as the formation of p3ht NPs, and confirmed the effects of GO/RGO on the fluorescence and carrier transport dynamics of p3ht NPs by using femtosecond fluorescence upconversion and transient absorption (TA) techniques. Ultrafast electron transfer (&#8764;1&#8197;ps) between GO/RGO and p3ht NPs quenched the fluorescence of p3ht NPs, indicating excellent properties of p3ht NPs&#8208;GO/RGO as the charge transfer complexes. Efficient electron transfer may promote the applications of p3ht NPs&#8208;GO/RGO composites in organic polymer solar cells and photocatalysis. Moreover, RGO had stronger interfacial interactions and more matched conduction band energy levels with p3ht NPs than GO did, which implied that p3ht NPs&#8208;RGO might have greater application values than p3ht NPs&#8208;GO.

         <title>Tris(boranil) Columnar Liquid Crystalline Fluorophores: pseudo&#8208;Triphenylene Boron(III) Complexes with Peripheral N&#8722;B&#8722;O Linkages</title>

Photoluminescent tris(boranil) discotics derived from tris&#8208;anils exhibit room temperature columnar mesomorphism, and redox behavior.







Abstract
The borate complexes derived from salicylaldimine ligands, called boranils, possess a wide range of photophysical and electronic characteristics intrinsically. The unique combination of molecular rigidity, rendered by four&#8208;coordinate boron bridges, and extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation enable them to serve as technically feasible fluorescent materials (dyes). The incorporation of liquid crystallinity in these boron(III) complexes, especially the columnar (Col) mesomorphism, which is overlooked hitherto, would provide a new dimension to these complexes. Herein, we report the first examples of tris(boranil) discotic liquid crystal (LC) dyes that have been readily synthesized by treating tris(N&#8208;salicylideneaniline)s, (TSAN)s, with BF3.Et2O in the presence of an acid quencher. These C3&#8208;symmetric borate complexes self&#8208;assemble into the Col phase, existing over a wide thermal span including room temperature. The 2D periodic order of the Col phases shows dependence on the length of the peripheral tails. The photophysical measurements reveal the fluorescence emission in their two condensed states viz., solid and Col phase, and in solution. Their electrochemical, two&#8208;step oxidation process coupled with the aforesaid features upholds their significance in applied research.

         <title>The Aldol&#8208;Tishchenko Reaction of Butanone, Cyclobutanone and a 3&#8208;Pentanone Derived Sulfinylimine and DFT Calculations of the Stereo&#8208;determining Step</title>

Enantio&#8208; and diastereoenriched 1,3&#8208;aminoalcohols are a highly versatile class of molecules in organic synthesis. However, most of the current syntheses involve a multi&#8208;step approach and the stepwise introduction of the chiral centres. Herein, we describe a one&#8208;step, highly diastereoselective method to furnish derivatives of these compounds via a double&#8208;aldol&#8208;Tishchenko reaction of cyclic and acyclic chiral sulfinylimines.







Abstract
Herein, we present a highly diastereoselective method to furnish acyclic 3&#8208;amino&#8208;1,5&#8208;diol derivatives using a tandem double&#8208;aldol&#8208;Tishchenko protocol (dr up to &gt;99&#8201;:&#8201;1) using a butanone derived sulfinylimine. In most cases only 1 diastereomer predominates, from a possible 16. The reaction is also regioselective. In addition, the highly challenging cyclobutanone and 3&#8208;pentanone derivatives are also amenable to a double&#8208;aldol&#8208;Tishchenko reaction, although the dr values are modest. Despite that, clean single diastereomers can be isolated, which should prove very useful in medicinal chemistry and other areas. Detailed DFT calculations support the observed stereoselectivities in all cases, providing a rationale for the excellent dr values in the butanone series and the moderate values for the 3&#8208;pentanone class.

         <title>Experimental and Theoretical Exploration of ESIPT in a Systematically Constructed Series of Benzimidazole Based Schiff Base Probes: Application as Chemosensors</title>

Chemosensors: The combined effect of ESIPT and C=N isomerization in benzimidazole and the substituted aminobenzoic acids bearing Schiff base probes is responsible for different spectral output in solid and solution states. Furthermore, these ESIPT active chemosensors can sense Cu2+ through the inhibition of keto&#8208;enol tautomerisation.







Abstract
Herein, we have utilized 2&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxyphenyl)benzimidazole (HBI) to synthesize 3&#8208;(1H&#8208;benzoimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;5&#8208;methyl&#8208;benzaldehyde (HBIA) followed by three Schiff bases by using &#8211;ortho (H2BIo), &#8208;meta (H3BIdm) and &#8208;para (H2BIp) substituted amino benzoic acids and studied their photophysical properties. We have successfully derived molecular structures of HBI, HBIA and H3BIdm which reveals that in HBI and HBIA, the phenolic &#8722;OH is intramolecularly hydrogen bonded with sp2 N of benzimidazole group whereas in H3BIdm, it is hydrogen bonded with imine C=N of Schiff base moiety, which is responsible for different solid state emission properties of the reported compounds. Extensive experimental and theoretical studies show that for all three Schiff bases, in solution due to activation of C=N isomerization, ESIPT operates through benzimidazole site and displays different emission from the solid state. Furthermore, H2BIo, H3BIdm and H2BIp selectively sense Cu2+ in semi aqueous medium with nano&#8208;molar detection limit and in HuH&#8208;7 cells through the inhibition of ESIPT of process.

         <title>Cooperativity&#8208;Driven Reactivity of a Dinuclear Copper Dimethylglyoxime Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 22, April 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
First check your solvent: In a dinuclear dimethylglyoxime copper(II) complex, hydrolysis of one ligand is facilitated by the cooperative effect of both CuII ions. Hydrolysis yields butane&#8208;2,3&#8208;dione monoxime and NH2OH; depending on the solvent used, the latter is either oxidized to N2O (in CH3CN) or reduced to NH4+ (in ethanol). A combined approach of experimental, theoretical, and spectroscopic methods allowed the reaction mechanism to be suggested.







Abstract
In this report, we present the dinuclear copper(II) dimethylglyoxime (H2dmg) complex [Cu2(H2dmg)(Hdmg)(dmg)]+ (1), which, in contrast to its mononuclear analogue [Cu(Hdmg)2] (2), is subject to a cooperativity&#8208;driven hydrolysis. The combined Lewis acidity of both copper centers increases the electrophilicity of the carbon atom in the bridging &#956;2&#8208;O&#8722;N=C&#8208;group of H2dmg and thus, facilitates the nucleophilic attack of H2O. This hydrolysis yields butane&#8208;2,3&#8208;dione monoxime (3) and NH2OH that, depending on the solvent, is then either oxidized or reduced. In ethanol, NH2OH is reduced to NH4+, yielding acetaldehyde as the oxidation product. In contrast, in CH3CN, NH2OH is oxidized by CuII to form N2O and [Cu(CH3CN)4]+. Herein are presented the combined synthetic, theoretical, spectroscopic and spectrometric methods that indicate and establish the reaction pathway of this solvent&#8208;dependent reaction.

         <title>A Multiresponsive Calix[6]arene Pseudorotaxane Empowered by Fluorophoric Dansyl Groups</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 22, April 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multiresponsive pseudorotaxane, composed by a dansyl calix[6]arene and a bipyridinium axle, is presented. The disassembly of this complex can be triggered by: i) protonation of the dansyl units (chemical stimulus); ii) electrochemical reduction of the bipyridinium unit (electrochemical stimulus); iii) photochemical reduction of the bipyridinium unit, enabled by photoinduced electron transfer from the dansyl units (light stimulus). Overall, three orthogonal and reversible stimuli can be employed to control the stability of this novel pseudorotaxane.







Abstract
We report the synthesis and characterization, by means of NMR and UV&#8208;visible spectroscopy and electrochemical techniques, of a dansyl calix[6]arene derivative and of its pseudorotaxane complex with a bipyridinium&#8208;based axle. This novel macrocycle shows remarkable complexation ability, in analogy with parent compounds, while the dansyl moieties impart valuable features to the system. Indeed, these units: i) signal the state of the system by fluorescence; ii) can be reversibly protonated, enabling the modulation of the complexation abilities of the macrocycle; iii) participate in photoinduced electron transfer processes, which may be exploited to tune the stability of the supramolecular complex. Therefore, in this multiresponsive pseudorotaxane, the threading and de&#8208;threading motions of the molecular components can be modulated either by protonation of the calixarene host or by reduction of the bipyridinium guest, which can be accomplished both by electrochemical reduction and via photoinduced electron transfer. Overall, three orthogonal and reversible stimuli can be used to induce molecular movements of the pseudorotaxane components.

From diquat to dye&#8208;cat. A series of push&#8211;pull dyes using diquat as the electron&#8208;acceptor moiety have been synthesized. Their photocatalytic abilities were tested in the aerobic thiocyanation of indoles and pyrroles, giving yields of up to 97&#8201;%.







Abstract
A series of new organic donor&#8211;&#960;&#8211;acceptor dyes incorporating a diquat moiety as a novel electron&#8208;acceptor unit have been synthesized and characterized. The analytical data were supported by DFT calculations. These dyes were explored in the aerobic thiocyanation of indoles and pyrroles. Here they showed a high photocatalytic activity under visible light, giving isolated yields of up to 97&#8201;%. In addition, the photocatalytic activity of standalone diquat and methyl viologen through formation of an electron donor acceptor complex is presented.

         <title>Aqueous Binders Compatible with Ionic Liquid Electrolyte for High&#8208;Performance Aluminum&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 22, April 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The suitability of aqueous binders for aluminum ion batteries (AIBs), especially the compatibility with ionic liquids and the distribution on the cathode surface, is systematically investigated. Typically, AIBs with sodium alginate (Na&#8722;Alg) as binder exhibit outstanding electrochemical performance in terms of specific capacity, rate capability, and cycling stability.







Abstract
The incompatibility of poly(vinylidene difluoride) (PVDF) with acidic ionic liquid electrolytes and the use of toxic and high&#8208;cost N&#8208;methyl pyrrolidone (NMP) solvents hinder the wide application of aluminum&#8208;ion batteries (AIBs). In this work, sodium alginate (Na&#8722;Alg) is developed as an aqueous binder for the fabrication of graphite positive electrodes in AIBs. The compatibility of various binders with the ionic liquid electrolyte is evaluated, and interaction between various binders and graphite particles before and after cycling is compared and discussed. The results demonstrate that the well compatibility of Na&#8722;Alg in ionic liquids and its reasonable distribution on the graphite surface facilitate fast charge transfer and ion diffusion, reduce electrode polarization, and thus contributing to significantly improved cycling stability and rate capability of AIBs. This work provides a new insight into the development of low&#8208;cost, eco&#8208;friendly, and high&#8208;performance binders for AIBs.

         <title>C versus O Protonation in Zincate Anions: A Simple Gas&#8208;Phase Model for the Surprising Kinetic Stability of Organometallics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 22, April 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Why do organozinc reagents survive instantaneous protolysis in protic media? A gas&#8208;phase model shows that the protonation of the organyl group, although thermodynamically strongly favored, is outcompeted by the protonation of a hydroxy ligand.







Abstract
For better understanding the intrinsic reactivity of organozinc reagents, we have examined the protolysis of the isolated zincate ions Et3Zn&#8722;, Et2Zn(OH)&#8722;, and Et2Zn(OH)2Li&#8722; by 2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethanol in the gas phase. The protonation of the hydroxy groups and the release of water proceed much more efficiently than the protonation of the ethyl groups and the liberation of ethane. Quantum&#8208;chemical computations and statistical&#8208;rate theory calculations fully reproduce the experimental findings and attribute the lower reactivity of the more basic ethyl moiety to higher intrinsic barriers, which override the thermodynamic preference for its protonation. Thus, our minimalistic gas&#8208;phase model provides evidence for the intrinsically low reactivity of organozinc reagents toward proton donors and helps to explain their remarkable kinetic stability against moisture and even protic media.

Thus, our minimalistic gas-phase model provides evidence for the intrinsically low reactivity of organozinc reagents toward proton donors and helps to explain their remarkable kinetic stability against moisture and even protic media.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>C&#8722;H Bond Activation Relay (CHAR) of Proline Ester Derivatives Promoted by In Situ Triarylamine Radical Cation: Selective Synthesis of 4&#8208;Bromopyrrole Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 22, April 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A C&#8722;H activation relay (CHAR) of proline esters was realized by the in&#8197;situ generated tris(4&#8208;bromophenyl)amine radical cation, selectively constructing the skeleton of 4&#8208;bromopyrrole under mild reaction conditions.







Abstract
Using the in&#8197;situ generated triarylamine radical cation as an initiator, the sp3 C&#8722;H bond of proline esters was smoothly oxidized and brominated through C&#8722;H activation relay (CHAR), giving a series of 4&#8208;bromopyrroles in good yields with high regioselectivity. The mechanistic study revealed that the oxidation of the active C&#8722;H bond initiated the followed 1,5&#8208;HAT and bromination, which provides a new method to realize the functionalization of the remote C&#8722;H bond.

         <title>Manipulation of Organic Afterglow in Fluoranthene&#8208;Containing Dopant&#8208;Matrix Systems: From Conventional Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence to Efficient Red TADF&#8208;Type Organic Afterglow</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 22, April 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents the transformation from conventional room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence to efficient red TADF&#8208;type organic afterglow in fluoranthene&#8208;containing dopant&#8208;matrix systems. Red TADF&#8208;type afterglow materials with afterglow efficiency up to 13.1&#8201;% and afterglow lifetime of 0.1&#8197;s have been achieved, which paves the way for afterglow materials&#8217; applications in diverse areas.







Abstract
It remains challenging to fabricate highly&#8208;efficient and long&#8208;lived organic afterglow materials, especially in the case of red afterglow systems. Here we develop advanced charge transfer (CT) technology to boost afterglow efficiency and lifetimes in fluoranthene&#8208;containing dopant&#8208;matrix systems. First, organic CT molecules possess singlet&#8208;triplet splitting energy (&#916;EST) of around 0.5&#8197;eV, much smaller than localized excitation systems. Second, upon doping into suitable organic matrices, dipole&#8208;dipole interactions between 1CT states and organic matrices reduce 1CT levels with less effect on 3CT levels, and thus further narrow &#916;EST and enhance intersystem crossing. Third, the rigid planar structure of fluoranthene groups and the rigid microenvironment provided by organic matrices can suppress phosphorescence quenching. Forth, the multiple donor design enables spectral red&#8208;shifts to red region and switches on TADF mechanism to improve afterglow efficiency to 13.1&#8201;% and maintain afterglow lifetime of 0.1&#8197;s. Such high&#8208;performance afterglow materials have been rarely explored in reported studies.

         <title>Cooperative Rare&#8208;Earth/Lithium&#8208;Mediated Conversion of White Phosphorus</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 22, April 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two heterometal polyphosphorus compounds with cyclo&#8208;P3 and norborane&#8208;P7 skeletons were formed by intramolecular cooperative yttrium hydride/LiPPh2 mediated activation of P4, while a pyramid&#8208;like P(PH)3 moiety was constructed from P4 functionalization using single metal specie (LY&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;THF)2(&#956;&#8208;H)2.







Abstract
The rare&#8208;earth/lithium cooperative effect on functionalization of white phosphorus has been investigated. The reaction of diazabutadiene&#8208;supported yttrium hydride chelated a LiPPh2 molecule (LY&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;THF)2(&#956;&#8208;H)2[&#956;&#8208;PPh2(Li)] (1, L=N,N&#8217;&#8208;di(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)&#8208;1,4&#8208;diazabutadiene) with P4 gave two novel mixed Y/Li multinuclear polyphosphorus complexes (LY&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;THF)2[cyclo&#8208;P3]Li(THF)3 (2) and [Li(THF)4]+[(LY&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;THF)3(norborane&#8208;P7)Li(THF)]&#8722; (3), accompanied with the elimination of diphosphorus compound Ph2PPPh2 (4) and H2. However, the comparative reaction of yttrium hydride (LY&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;THF)2(&#956;&#8208;H)2 with P4 afforded a trinuclear yttrium pyramid&#8208;P4 complex (LY&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;THF)3(&#956;3&#8208;P(PH)3) (5). Further investigations show that 5 cannot continuously react with LiPPh2 to form 2 and 3, and LiPPh2 reacted with P4 to form a Zintl&#8208;P7 lithium complex (TMEDA&#8901;Li)3(Zintl&#8208;P7) (6) and 4. These results indicated that the cooperation of Y/Li for activation of P4 is a key for the formation of 2 and 3. All new compounds have been characterized by NMR spectroscopy and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies.

         <title>Zinc Substituted Myoglobin&#8722;Albumin Fusion Protein: A Photosensitizer for Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 22, April 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Myoglobin combined with human serum albumin, Mb&#8208;HSA, was prepared using a yeast host cell with secretion into the culture medium. The heme of Mb&#8208;HSA was replaced with a zinc protoporphyrin IX, yielding ZnMb&#8208;HSA. This fluorescent fusion protein showed a superior activity of photodynamic cancer therapy in&#8197;vitro. Its blood circulation half&#8208;life was 11&#8208;fold longer than free ZnMb in&#8197;vivo.







Abstract
Myoglobin combined with human serum albumin (Mb&#8208;HSA) can be produced using yeast Pichia pastoris as a host strain, with secretion into the culture medium. This Mb&#8208;HSA fusion protein possesses identical O2 binding affinity to that of naked Mb. The Mb unit is reconstituted with a zinc(II) protoporphyrin IX, yielding (zinc substituted Mb)&#8208;HSA, ZnMb&#8208;HSA. The photophysical property and singlet O2 generation ability of ZnMb&#8208;HSA are equivalent to those of ZnMb. In vitro cell experiments revealed that ZnMb&#8208;HSA acts as a superior photosensitizer for photodynamic cancer therapy. It is noteworthy that ZnMb&#8208;HSA shows long circulation lifetime in&#8197;vivo.

The Mb unit is reconstituted with a zinc(II) protoporphyrin IX, yielding (zinc substituted Mb)-HSA, ZnMb-HSA. The photophysical property and singlet O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; generation ability of ZnMb-HSA are equivalent to those of ZnMb. In vitro cell experiments revealed that ZnMb-HSA acts as a superior photosensitizer for photodynamic cancer therapy. It is noteworthy that ZnMb-HSA shows long circulation lifetime in&#8197;vivo.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Indirect oxidative dehydrogenation: Introduction of appropriate amount of Zn onto ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite resulted in highly dispersed and active site for oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane (C2H6) using CO2 as a milder oxidant (CO2&#8208;ODH), structure&#8208;performance relationship and reaction network were systematically investigated.







Abstract
Ethylene (C2H4) is a major chemical for the modern society, and new technologies for its production are of strategic importance globally. Recently, oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane (C2H6) using CO2 as a milder oxidant (CO2&#8208;ODH) is proposed as a potential way for C2H4 production, and development of effective catalysts for the process is drawing wide attention. Here, we report on a facilely prepared ZSM&#8208;5 supported Zn system, i.&#8201;e., ZnZSM&#8208;5, which showed great promise in CO2&#8208;ODH. Samples with different Zn loadings were prepared and evaluated, and the highest performance was obtained over 0.05ZnZSM&#8208;5 at 700&#8201;&#176;C and a CO2:C2H6 feeding ratio of 5&#8201;:&#8201;1. During 340&#8197;min TOS, the C2H6 conversion decreased moderately from 36.2&#8201;% to 23.1&#8201;%, and the C2H4 yield stabilized at 21.9&#8201;% to 27.9&#8201;%. Based on systematic characterization and investigation of reaction conditions, the structure&#8208;performance relationship and reaction network were discussed in detail.

Coordination polymers: The combination of the rigid, aromatic dinitrile isomers ortho/meta/para&#8208;(NC)2C6H4, the pentaphosphaferrocenes [CpRFe(&#951;5&#8208;P5)] (CpR=Cp*, Cp&#8217;&#8217;; Cp*=&#951;5&#8208;C5Me5; Cp&#8217;&#8217;=&#951;5&#8208;C5H3tBu2&#8208;1,3) with different steric demands and a silver salt with a non&#8208;coordinating anion SbF6&#8722; gives a unique view into how those building blocks can influence a three&#8208;component self&#8208;assembly system giving rise to various 1D/2D/3D&#8208;coordination polymers.







Abstract
Pentaphosphaferrocenes [CpRFe(&#951;5&#8208;P5)] (Cp*=&#951;5&#8208;C5Me5) (A), Cp&#8217;&#8217;=&#951;5&#8208;C5H3tBu2&#8208;1,3 (B)) are excellent building blocks for polymeric assemblies in supramolecular chemistry in combination with coinage metal salts of weakly coordinating anions such as AgSbF6. Adding rigid aromatic dinitriles ortho/meta/para&#8208;(NC)2C6H4 in a one&#8208;pot reaction between [CpRFe(&#951;5&#8208;P5)] and AgSbF6 leads to various coordination polymers (CPs) by a three&#8208;component self&#8208;assembly. The sterical demand of the differently substituted cyclopentadiene ligands as well as the rigid constitution of the isomeric dinitriles (NC)2C6H4 play a key role in the formation of the isolated CPs. All CPs were characterized by NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, elemental analysis, and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction.

A modular synthetic strategy was developed to achieve zigzag&#8208;edged polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons with extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation from &#8220;U&#8208;shaped&#8221; benzo[m]tetraphene&#8208;based precursors. The experimental and theoretical investigations elucidated the edge&#8208; and size&#8208;dependent effect on the electronic structures and optical properties. Moreover, ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy disclosed the modulation of the photophysical properties upon &#960;&#8208;extension.







Abstract
A series of zigzag&#8208;edged polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) (Z1&#8208;Z3) were synthesized from 2,12&#8208;dibromo&#8208;7,14&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;benzo[m]tetraphene (9) as a versatile building block. Their structures were unambiguously confirmed by laser desorption/ionization time&#8208;of&#8208;flight mass spectrometry, 1H NMR, Raman, and Fourier&#8208;transformed infrared (FTIR) spectroscopies as well as scanning tunneling microscopy. The fingerprint vibrational modes were elucidated with theoretical support. The edge&#8208; and size&#8208;dependent optical properties were characterized by UV&#8208;Vis absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy and DFT calculations. Moreover, ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy revealed distinct modulation of the photophysical properties upon &#960;&#8208;extension from Z1 to Z2, the latter having a gulf edge.

         <title>Cyclic or Linear? Parameters Determining the Outcome of Glycine Polymerization in Silica Surface Prebiotic Scenarios</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 22, April 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclic or linear? The parameters determining the outcome of glycine polymerization on silica surface are studied through monomers deposition from both gas and liquid phases. The results showed that the density of the nearly&#8208;free silanols NFS is a crucial parameter to predict the formation of linear or cyclic polymers when Gly is deposited from gas phase. For liquid phase deposition, Gly deposited in its zwitterionic form could isomerize to its neutral form and readsorb on the silanol&#8208;Gly esters to form linear peptides besides DKP.Please consider the following revised version of TOC







Abstract
The parameters that determine the formation of linear peptides and cyclic dimers (diketopiperazine, DKP) on silica surfaces of different surface area, silanol and siloxane ring populations, controlled by thermal treatments, are investigated upon glycine deposition from gas and liquid phases. The formed products were characterized by infrared and Raman spectroscopies, X&#8208;ray diffraction and thermogravimetric analysis. The results reveal the importance of &#8220;nearly&#8208;free&#8221; silanols to form ester centers as primers for the formation of linear peptides over DKP, on surfaces with medium silanol density (1.4 to 2.7&#8197;nm&#8722;2). Quenched reactivity is seen on isolated silanols (density&#8804;0.7&#8197;nm&#8722;2), while silanols involved in hydrogen bonding (density of 4.5&#8197;nm&#8722;2) weakly interact with Gly resulting in its cyclization to DKP. Deposition of glycine from liquid phase may also form both DKP and linear polymers, depending on its loading and silica surface.

     alt="Cyclic or Linear? Parameters Determining the Outcome of Glycine Polymerization in Silica Surface Prebiotic Scenarios"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cyclic or linear&lt;/b&gt;? The parameters determining the outcome of glycine polymerization on silica surface are studied through monomers deposition from both gas and liquid phases. The results showed that the density of the nearly-free silanols NFS is a crucial parameter to predict the formation of linear or cyclic polymers when Gly is deposited from gas phase. For liquid phase deposition, Gly deposited in its zwitterionic form could isomerize to its neutral form and readsorb on the silanol-Gly esters to form linear peptides besides DKP.Please consider the following revised version of TOC
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The parameters that determine the formation of linear peptides and cyclic dimers (diketopiperazine, DKP) on silica surfaces of different surface area, silanol and siloxane ring populations, controlled by thermal treatments, are investigated upon glycine deposition from gas and liquid phases. The formed products were characterized by infrared and Raman spectroscopies, X-ray diffraction and thermogravimetric analysis. The results reveal the importance of &#8220;nearly-free&#8221; silanols to form ester centers as primers for the formation of linear peptides over DKP, on surfaces with medium silanol density (1.4 to 2.7&#8197;nm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;). Quenched reactivity is seen on isolated silanols (density&#8804;0.7&#8197;nm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;), while silanols involved in hydrogen bonding (density of 4.5&#8197;nm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) weakly interact with Gly resulting in its cyclization to DKP. Deposition of glycine from liquid phase may also form both DKP and linear polymers, depending on its loading and silica surface. These conclusions demonstrate the complexity of glycine surface chemistry in the polymerization reaction and highlight the interest of a surface science approach to evaluate geochemical prebiotic scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Energetic materials: In this work, the pentaerythritol backbone was modified with amine, nitramine and tetrazole functionalities leading to powerful melt castable pentaerythritol tetranitrate derivatives that outperform TNT. Exciting insights into the influence of these functionalities on mechanical sensitivities and melting behavior are observed and discussed.







Abstract
In the search for high&#8208;performance and environmentally friendly energetic materials, the derivatization of known materials is an often&#8208;applied concept to fulfill modern&#8208;day demands. Surprisingly, the long know pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN) has only been derivatized to a limited extent. PETN shows a brought application in energetic materials or pharmaceutics. In this work, the PETN backbone is modified by introducing nitramine, ionic nitramine, amine, ionic amine and tetrazole functionalities. The obtained and structurally similar compounds allow good comparability and insights into functional group effects on sensitivity, thermal behavior and performance. The functionalizations result in melting points in the range of 64 to 126&#8201;&#176;C. Some compounds are therefore potential candidates to replace toxic TNT.

         <title>Polarity&#8208;Evolution Control and Luminescence Regulation in Multiple&#8208;Site Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 22, April 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The solvent&#8208;polarity effect on the framework/luminescence regulation was demonstrated based on the multiple&#8208;site hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks: distinct electrostatic forces controlled by solvent polarities (high/low) would benefit for the different framework (cage/channel) structures; the solvent polarity could further adjust the conformation of organic building unit to generate a broadband tunable luminescence.







Abstract
Hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) have shown great potential in separation, sensing and host&#8208;guest chemistry, however, the pre&#8208;design of HOFs remains challenging due to the uncertainty of solvents&#8242; participation in framework formation. Herein, the polarity&#8208;evolution&#8208;controlled framework/luminescence regulation is demonstrated based on multiple&#8208;site hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks. Several distinct HOFs were prepared by changing bonding modes of building units via the evolution of electrostatic forces induced by various solvent polarities. High&#8208;polar solvents with strong electrostatic attraction to surrounding units showed the tendency to form cage structures, while low&#8208;polar solvents with weak electrostatic attraction only occupy hydrogen&#8208;bond sites, conducive to the channel formation. Furthermore, the conformation of optical building unit can be adjusted by affecting the solvent polarity, generating different luminescence outputs. These results pave the way for the rational design of ideal HOFs with on&#8208;demand framework regulation and luminescence properties.

         <title>Enabling Long&#8208;Lived Polymeric Room Temperature Phosphorescence Material in Abominable Solvent</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 22, April 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient long&#8208;lived polymeric room&#8208;temperature phosphorescent material was achieved based on the rigid structure provided by aromatic and piperidine rings of mBPipQ and the dense molecular arrangement of an epoxy resin, which stabilized triplet excitons. More importantly, these materials exhibit stable yellow&#8208;green phosphorescence emission after being immersed in strong acid or alkali solutions for 10&#8197;days.







Abstract
Long&#8208;lived polymeric room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials have drawn more attention due to their convenient preparation process and equally efficient phosphorescence performance in recent years. As the polymer matrix is sensitive to air and humidity, some non&#8208;covalent interactions in the matrix are easily decomposed in water or air, which means that it is difficult for this material to be stored stably for a long time in the atmospheric environment or under harsh conditions. In this work, polymer powder mBPipQ contains aromatic and piperidine rings that are designed and synthesized successfully. Then the polymer is uniformly dispersed into epoxy resin matrix to form long&#8208;lived polymeric RTP material with efficient afterglow properties. The stiff backbone structure of mBPip and dense molecular arrangement of epoxy resin provide a rigid environment to stabilize triplet excitons, the RTP performance is greatly enhanced. The lifetime of mBPipQ in epoxy resin is 2&#8197;times higher than that of small molecule chromophore in that one. Interestingly, after soaking in strong acid or alkali solution for 10&#8197;days, the material can still emit stable and efficient long&#8208;lived phosphorescence. It is thanks to the hard matrix after full curing, which can provide a protective layer to prevent external quenchers from interfering with phosphorescence emission. Utilizing the efficient phosphorescence emission and excellent abominable&#8208;solvent resistance of this RTP material, multilevel information encryption has been successfully demonstrated. This work broadens the application scope of polymeric RTP materials in harsh environments and provides a new idea for achieving efficient RTP emission.

         <title>Facile One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of Polysubstituted Pyridinium Salts by Annulation of Enamines with Alkynes</title>

         <dc:description>
An efficient and facile synthesis of highly substituted pyridinium salts through annulation of enamines with alkynes is reported. The keys to this advancement are: 1) one&#8208;pot, mild reaction conditions; 2) broad substrate scope; and 3) selective 6&#8208;endo&#8208;dig cyclization.







Abstract
An efficient and facile synthesis of highly substituted pyridinium salts through the annulation of enamines with alkynes is reported herein. A Ag2CO3/HNTf2 synergistically acting catalyst system was developed and used in a condensation reaction between carbonyl substrates and propargylamine to afford structurally diverse pyridinium salts. A mechanistic investigation shows that this one&#8208;pot transformation proceeded via selective 6&#8208;endo&#8208;dig cyclization of the in situ generated propargylenamine and protonolysis of the resulting vinyl&#8211;silver intermediate. The reaction conditions are mild, and the substrate scope is broad. During the cyclization, an unusual inversion of the normal reactivity of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl systems was observed.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 22, April 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild and highly efficient copper photoredox&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component coupling of BQ, alkyl/aryl alcohols, and alkyl/aryl terminal/internal alkynes forms highly functionalized products at room temperature. The late&#8208;stage functionalized compounds show good anti&#8208;Candida krusei and anti&#8208;Candida glabrata activities with lower cytotoxicities than that of fluconazole, the standard antifungal medicine.







Abstract
A simple visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced CuCl&#8208;catalyzed synthesis was developed for highly functionalized carbon&#8208;centered compounds (&#945;&#8208;alk/aryloxy&#8208;&#945;&#8208;diaryl/alkylaryl&#8208;acetaldehydes/ketones) at room temperature using benzoquinone, alkyl/aryl alcohol, and alkyl/aryl terminal/internal alkynes. Late&#8208;stage functionalized compounds show good antifungal activities, especially against Candida krusei fungal strain, in in&#8197;vitro experiments (the Broth microdilution method). Moreover, toxicity tests (zebrafish egg model experiments) indicated that these compounds had negligible cytotoxicity. The green chemistry metrics (E&#8208;factor value is 7.3) and eco&#8208;scale (eco&#8208;scale value is 58.8) evaluations show that the method is simple, mild, highly efficient, eco&#8208;friendly, and environmentally feasible.

         <title>A Cu+/Thiourea Dendrimer Achieves Excellent Cytosolic Protein Delivery via Enhanced Cell Uptake and Endosome Escape</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 22, April 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cuprous (I) ions coordinated polymer was synthesized via the coordination of phenylthiourea grafted dendrimer with either cuprous&#8197;(I) ions or copper&#8197;(II) ions, since the copper&#8197;(II) ions in the coordination polymer was reduced to cuprous&#8197;(I) ions. The coordinated polymer facilitates the protein binding, cellular uptake and endosomal escape, and thus enables efficient protein delivery.







Abstract
Intracellular protein delivery has attracted considerable attention in the development of protein&#8208;based therapeutics, however, the design of highly efficient materials for robust delivery of native proteins remains challenging. This study proposes a Cu+ &#8208;based coordination polymer for cytosolic protein delivery with high efficacy and robustness. The phenylthiourea grafted dendrimer is coordinated with cuprous ions to prepare the polymeric carrier, which efficiently bind cargo proteins via a combination of coordination, ionic and hydrophobic interactions. The incorporation of Cu+ ions in the polymer greatly improves its cellular uptake and endosomal escape. The cuprous&#8208;based coordination polymer successfully delivered a variety of structurally diverse proteins into various cell lines with reserved bioactivities. This study provides a new type of coordination polymers for cytosolic delivery of biomacromolecules.

         <title>Divergent Construction of N&#8208;Doped Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons with Indole as the Nitrogen Source Building Block</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 22, April 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal catalyst&#8208;dependent divergent cascade reaction of alkyne&#8208;embedded diazoketones with indoles is reported, which offers expeditious access to benzo[i]phenanthridines and benzo[b]carbazoles in good yield under mild reaction conditions. N&#8208;embedded dienophiles are used rather than alkynes or olefins for cycloaddition with the isobenzopyrylium species, providing a concise and practical approach for the selective construction of N&#8208;doped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with structural diversity and broad functional group compatibility.







Abstract
An Ag/Au&#8208;catalyzed divergent cascade reaction of alkyne embedded diazoketones with indoles has been described. Preliminary mechanistic studies indicate that the reaction goes through a [4+2]&#8208;cycloaddition of an in&#8197;situ formed isobenzopyrylium intermediate with indole, followed by a sequential retro&#8208;Michael addition/carbene N&#8722;H insertion process to give the benzo[i]phenanthridines products with gold catalysis; whereas a dearomatization/rearomatization sequence occurs favourably when the reaction is catalyzed by a silver catalyst, delivering benzo[b]carbazoles in generally high to excellent yields. Notably, this is a rare example of using indole as the dienophile for cycloaddition with the isobenzopyrylium species, providing a concise and practical approach for the selective construction of N&#8208;doped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with structural diversity and broad functional&#8208;group compatibility.

         <title>Orientational Control of Circularly Polarized Luminescence from Pyrene Clusters by Using a DNA Scaffold</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 22, April 18, 2023. </description>

Not just any which way: Circularly polarized luminescence from a pyrene cluster in DNA duplexes has been systematically investigated. CPL properties varied depending not only on the distance but also on the relative orientation between two pyrene dimers.







Abstract
We have investigated the chiroptical activities of pyrene clusters incorporated within a DNA duplex. Three pyrene derivatives were prepared on d&#8208;threoninol linkers to allow incorporation within a DNA strand. DNA scaffolds containing dimers, tetramers, and hexamers of the pyrene derivatives were prepared. The homodimers of 1&#8208; and of 4&#8208;pyrenecarboxylic acid, but not 2&#8208;pyrenecarboxylic acid, emitted intense circularly polarized luminescence signals. Although increasing the number of pyrene units weakened the signal, insertion of natural base pairs between two dimers enhanced its intensity. Interestingly, circularly polarized luminescence intensities varied non&#8208;monotonically depending on the number of intervening base pairs, thus indicating the importance of orientation between pyrene dimers. The results presented here could lead to the development of bright circularly polarized luminescence materials and probes.

Circularly polarized luminescent (CPL) depends on orientation. The DNA helix is depicted as a spiral staircase on which chromophore people stand. The CPL intensity, which is shown as helical light, varies depending not only on the distance between chromophores but also on their relative orientation. Helical structures of DNA duplexes are also illustrated. More information can be found in the Research Article by H. Kashida, H. Asanuma, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202300182).

Incorporated into donor&#8211;acceptor dyes we developed, as well as into charge&#8211;transfer complexes we observed, diquat is enabled to absorb visible light. This allowed the use of these systems in the photocatalytic thiocyanation of various indoles and pyrroles, with air as the oxidant. More information can be found in the Research Article by R. Wilhelm and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202203541).

         <dc:description>
Cooperativity at the crossroad: The two copper centers in the dinuclear copper(II) dimethylglyoxime complex work in concert to facilitate ligand hydrolysis that yields butane&#8208;2,3&#8208;dione monoxime and NH2OH. The fate of NH2OH depends on the solvent used, in CH3CN, for example, NH2OH is oxidized to N2O yielding [Cu(CH3CN)4]+ as reduced species. In ethanol, however, NH2OH is reduced to NH4+, which in turn yields acetaldehyde as oxidized species. More information can be found in the Research Article by S. Becker and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202203438).

         <dc:description>
Supramolecular chirality triggered by unpolarized light and circularly polarized light is systematically discussed. The unpolarized light triggered systems were mainly assisted by various photoactive components. Besides, circularly polarized light can directly induce the supramolecular charity in organic and inorganic systems or their hybridized systems. It is anticipated that this review can advance the development of more responsive chiral functional nanomaterials. For more details, see the Review by F. Yang, B. Yue, and L. Zhu (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202203794).

Circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) has attracted much interest due to its potential applications on chiral photonic techniques and optoelectronic materials science. Chiral supramolecular assembly processes can be accompanied by chirality transfer and induction mechanism, which can promote the amplification effect on the induced CPL of achiral dyes.

Light&#8208;triggered supramolecular chiral assemblies have aroused great attention. According to the different interaction ways between light and system, we mainly summarized non&#8208;polarized light and circularly polarized light (CP light) triggered chiral assemblies. Non&#8208;polarized light triggered systems were mainly assisted by the introduction of photoactive components. As a chiral light source, CP light can directly induce the asymmetric assembly of organic molecules and asymmetric photosynthesis of inorganic metal nanostructures. Besides, photoexcitation induced assembly based physical approach was also explored recently to regulate supramolecular chirality beyond photochemical reactions. Furthermore, many relevant functional applications were also presented.







Abstract
Dynamically controlling the supramolecular chirality is of great significance in development of functional chiral materials, which is thus essential for the specific function implementation. As an external energy input, light is remote and accurate for modulating chiral assemblies. In non&#8208;polarized light control, some photochemically reactive units (e.&#8201;g., azobenzene, &#593;&#8208;cyanostilbene, spiropyran, anthracene) or photo&#8208;induced directionally rotating molecular motors were designed to drive chiral transfer or amplification. Besides, photoexcitation induced assembly based physical approach was also explored recently to regulate supramolecular chirality beyond photochemical reactions. In addition, circularly polarized light was applied to induce asymmetric arrangement of organic molecules and asymmetric photochemical synthesis of inorganic metallic nanostructures, in which both wavelength and handedness of circularly polarized light have effects on the induced supramolecular chirality. Although light&#8208;triggered chiral assemblies have been widely applied in photoelectric materials, biomedical fields, soft actuator, chiral catalysis and chiral sensing, there is a lack of systematic review on this topic. In this review, we summarized the recent studies and perspectives in the constructions and applications of light&#8208;responsive chiral assembled systems, aiming to provide better knowledge for the development of multifunctional chiral nanomaterials.

Abstract
Circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) has attracted much interest due to its potential applications on chiral photonic techniques and optoelectronic materials science. As known, dissymmetry factor (gem) of CPL is one essential factor for evaluating the features of CPL&#8208;active materials. Much attention has focused on how to increase the gem value, which is one of the most important issues for CPL practical applications. Recently, more and more works have demonstrated that chiral supramolecular could provide the significant strategy to improve the gem value through the orderly helical superstructure of chiral building blocks. Normally, this kind of chiral supramolecular assembly process can be accompanied by chirality transfer and induction mechanism, which can promote the amplification effect on the induced CPL of achiral dyes. In this review, we fully summarized recent advances on the induced CPL&#8208;active materials of chiral supramolecular co&#8208;assemblies, their applications in circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (CP&#8208;OLEDs) and current challenges.

In this review, we fully summarized recent advances on the induced CPL-active materials of chiral supramolecular co-assemblies, their applications in circularly polarized organic light-emitting diodes (CP-OLEDs) and current challenges.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Reversible Pressure&#8208;Magnetic Modulation in a Tetrathiafulvalene&#8208;Based Dyad Piezochromic Dysprosium Single&#8208;Molecule Magnet</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The extreme sensitivity of trivalent lanthanide ions to crystal field variations led to the emergence of single&#8208;molecule magnetic switching under various stimuli. The use of pressure as an external stimulus instead of classic light irradiation, oxidation or any chemical reactions allows a fine tuning of the magnetic modulation. Here the well&#8208;known pure isotopically enriched [162Dy(tta)3(L)]&#8901;C6H14 ( 162Dy) Single&#8208;Molecule Magnet (SMM) (tta&#8208; = 2&#8208;2&#8208;thenoyltrifluoroacetonate and L = 4,5&#8208;bis(propylthio)&#8208;tetrathiafulvalene&#8208;2&#8208;(2&#8208;pyridyl)benzimidazole&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;pyridine) was experimentally investigated by single&#8208;crystal diffraction and squid magnetometry under high applied pressures. Both reversible piezochromic properties and pressure modulation of the SMM behavior were demonstrated and supported by ab initio calculations. The magnetic study of the diluted sample [162Dy0.05Y0.95(tta)3(L)]&#8901;C6H14 ( 162Dy@Y) indicated that variations in the electronic structure have both intra&#8208; and inter&#8208;molecular origins. Quantitative magnetic interpretation concludes to a deterioration of the Orbach process for the benefit of both Raman and QTM mechanisms under applied pressure.</dc:description>

         <title>Late&#8208;Stage functionalization for the divergent synthesis of novel podophyllotoxin derivatives by rhodium catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A divergent synthesis of novel podophyllotoxin derivatives was here reported from simple and readily available starting materials via Late&#8208;Stage functionalization strategy by rhodium catalysis. This strategy utilizes the ketone and oxime in substrates as internal direacting groups and requires no external ligand or removable directing group. 75 podophyllotoxin derivatives have been obtained without any erosion of the enantiopurity, indicating the broad substrate scope of this method. Additionally, by using the newly developed strategy, 9aa can be prepared via sequential transformation, which exhibited excellent anticancer activity against eight cancer cell lines. In particularly, 9aa suppressed Hela cells with IC50 values of 74.5 nM, which provides a promising lead compound for future drug discovery.</dc:description>

         <title>Electroreductive Cross&#8208;Electrophile Coupling of Aziridines and Aryl Bromides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, a nickela&#8208;electrocatalyzed cross&#8208;electrophile coupling of readily available aryl aziridines and aryl bromides under mild and sustainable electrochemical conditions to access synthetic useful &#946;&#8209;arylethylamines is developed. This protocol is characterized by its exquisite chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity, broad substrate scope and good functional group compatibility. Mechanistic studies confirmed that the regioselectivity and reactivity observed are a result of electro&#8208;induced ring&#8208;opening of aziridines under electroreductive conditions to generate a benzyl radical intermediate as the active species. Furthermore, this strategy also enables cross&#8208;coupling with CO2 to access &#946;&#8209;amino acids under mild conditions.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Heterogeneous photocatalysis is a promising approach for a wide range of hydrogenative reactions owing to the mild reaction conditions and the possibility of employing liquid hydrogen donors. Currently, the major interest is focused on the development of high performance photocatalyst materials and the expansion of reaction scope. An overview from a perspective of hydrogen donor and thus the related mechanistic understanding of the light&#8208;induced hydrogenative reactions is rare. Here, we have categorized the photocatalytic hydrogenative reactions by the type of employed liquid hydrogen donors (hydrocarbons and water), discussed the basic criteria of hydrogen abstraction from these donors, and elaborated the design strategy of the photocatalyst materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural Requirements of a Glycolipid MPIase for Membrane Protein Integration</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
MPIase, a glycolipid, is involved in membrane protein integration in the inner membrane of Escherichia coli. In this study, we synthesized analogs to reveal the structural requirements and glycan&#8208;length dependency for the integration and chaperone&#8208;like activity, and synergistic effects with the membrane chaperone, YidC. The structure&#8208;activity relationship study verified the mechanism for translocon&#8208;independent integration aided by MPIase.







Abstract
MPIase is a glycolipid involved in membrane protein integration in the inner membrane of Escherichia coli. To overcome the trace amounts and heterogeneity of natural MPIase, we systematically synthesized MPIase analogs. Structure&#8208;activity relationship studies revealed the contribution of distinctive functional groups and the effect of the MPIase glycan length on membrane protein integration activity. In addition, both the synergistic effects of these analogs with the membrane chaperone/insertase YidC, and the chaperone&#8208;like activity of the phosphorylated glycan were observed. These results verified the translocon&#8208;independent membrane integration mechanism in the inner membrane of E. coli, in which MPIase captures the highly hydrophobic nascent proteins via its characteristic functional groups, prevents protein aggregation, attracts the proteins to the membrane surface, and delivers them to YidC in order to regenerate its own integration activity.

     alt="Structural Requirements of a Glycolipid MPIase for Membrane Protein Integration"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;MPIase, a glycolipid&lt;/b&gt;, is involved in membrane protein integration in the inner membrane of &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt;. In this study, we synthesized analogs to reveal the structural requirements and glycan-length dependency for the integration and chaperone-like activity, and synergistic effects with the membrane chaperone, YidC. The structure-activity relationship study verified the mechanism for translocon-independent integration aided by MPIase.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MPIase is a glycolipid involved in membrane protein integration in the inner membrane of &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt;. To overcome the trace amounts and heterogeneity of natural MPIase, we systematically synthesized MPIase analogs. Structure-activity relationship studies revealed the contribution of distinctive functional groups and the effect of the MPIase glycan length on membrane protein integration activity. In addition, both the synergistic effects of these analogs with the membrane chaperone/insertase YidC, and the chaperone-like activity of the phosphorylated glycan were observed. These results verified the translocon-independent membrane integration mechanism in the inner membrane of &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt;, in which MPIase captures the highly hydrophobic nascent proteins via its characteristic functional groups, prevents protein aggregation, attracts the proteins to the membrane surface, and delivers them to YidC in order to regenerate its own integration activity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Substituent and Solvent Effect Studies of N&#8208;Alkenylnitrone 4&#960; Electrocyclizations
</title>

         <dc:description>
Making the unreactive reactive: Substituent and solvent effects for the 4&#960; electrocyclization of N&#8208;alkenylnitrones to azetidine nitrones have been investigated by using Hammett, Eyring, and isotope effect studies. The results of these investigations have been used to prepare previously inaccessible azetidine nitrones, identify catalysts, and establish a fundamental understanding for synthetic applications.







Abstract
The roles of substituent and solvent effects in promoting the 4&#960; electrocyclization of N&#8208;alkenylnitrones to give azetidine nitrones have been investigated by experimental examination of relative rates, activation energies, and linear free energy relationships. These transformations are synthetically important because they favor the formation of a strained heterocyclic ring with imbedded functionality and stereochemical information for versatile derivatization. Mechanistic investigations, including Hammett studies, solvent&#8208;dependent Eyring studies, and solvent isotope effects, provide insight into the steric and electronic factors that control these electrocyclizations and identify trends that can be used to advance this approach towards the rapid synthesis of complex azetidines.

         <title>A New Type of Valence Tautomerism in Cobalt Dioxolene Complexes &#8211; Temperature&#8208;Induced Transition from a Cobalt(III) Catecholate to a Low&#8208;Spin Cobalt(II) Semiquinonate State</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel twist in temperature&#8208;induced switching of electronic states in cobalt dioxolene complexes: Structural, magnetic, and spectroscopic results demonstrate that valence tautomerism can occur by converting a cobalt(III) catecholate into a low&#8208;spin cobalt(II) semiquinonate complex instead of the usual high&#8208;spin complex.







Abstract
The synthesis and characterization of the monocationic cobalt(III) catecholate complex [Co(L&#8208;N4tBu2)(Cl2cat)]+ (L&#8208;N4tBu2=N,N&#8217;&#8208;Di&#8208;tert.&#8208;butyl&#8208;2,11&#8208;diaza[3.3](2,6)pyridinophane, Cl2cat2&#8722;=4,5&#8208;dichlorocatecholate) are presented. The complex exhibits valence tautomeric properties in solution; but, in contrast to the usually observed conversion from a cobalt(III) catecholate to a high&#8208;spin cobalt(II) semiquinonate state, valence tautomerism of [Co(L&#8208;N4tBu2)(Cl2cat)]+ leads to the formation of a low&#8208;spin cobalt(II) semiquinonate complex upon raising the temperature. This new type of valence tautomerism for a cobalt dioxolene complex has been unambiguously established by a detailed spectroscopic investigation using variable&#8208;temperature NMR, IR and UV&#8208;Vis&#8208;NIR spectroscopy. Determination of the enthalpies and entropies characterizing the valence tautomeric equilibria in various solutions shows that the influence of the solvent is almost exclusively entropic.

         <title>Bioactivities of Triazolium&#8208;Based N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Salts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biological activity: 1,2,4&#8208;Triazolium salt derivatives have been extensively studied as N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalysts and ligands. Meanwhile, it has also shown a wide range of highly effective bioactivities, including the activities of antibacterial, antifungal, anticancer, anti&#8208;plasmodium and even worm growth regulation. The development and applications of 1,2,4&#8208;triazolium salts in the development of both agrochemicals and pharmaceuticals are attractive.







Abstract
1,2,4&#8208;Triazolium salts are precursors of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs), which have been extensively used as effective catalysts and ligands for both asymmetric and non&#8208;enantioselective reactions. Nevertheless, they are also a kind of quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs) that possess amphipathic properties. The unique chemical and physical properties of 1,2,4&#8208;triazolium salts have received significant attention from scientists focusing on the development of novel bioactive molecules as pesticides and medicines. It is timely and meaningful to summarize the bioactivities of 1,2,4&#8208;triazolium salt derivatives against various bacteria, fungi, cancer cells, and other pathogens in the past 30&#8197;years. Meanwhile, the structure&#8208;activity relationship (SAR) of 1,2,4&#8208;triazolium salts was also summarized. Finally, our perspective on the future development and applications of triazolium salts as agrichemicals or human drugs is presented.

         <title>Controlled Shell and Kernel Modifications of Atomically Precise Pd/Ag Superatomic Nanoclusters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first controlled modification of kernel and shell arrangements in Pd&#8208;doped superatomic silver clusters containing interstitial hydrides is presented. The sequential addition of individual Ag atoms to an icosahedron core results in PdH@Ag19, PdH@Ag20, and Pd@Ag21, while maintaining a 12&#8208;ligand stabilizing framework. Remarkable aqueous stability, proven by unsupported catalytic reduction of 4&#8208;nitrophenol was demonstrated.







Abstract
The first 8&#8208;electron Pd/Ag superatomic alloys with an interstitial hydride [PdHAg19(dtp)12] (dtp=S2P(OiPr)2&#8722;) 1 and [PdHAg20(dtp)12]+ 2 are reported. The targeted addition of a single Ag atom to 1 is achieved by the reaction of one equivalent of trifluoroacetic acid, resulting in the formation of 2 in 55&#8201;% yield. Further modification of the shell results in the formation of [PdAg21(dtp)12]+ 3 via an internal redox reaction, with the system retaining an 8&#8208;electron superatomic configuration. The interstitial hydride in 1 and 2 contributes its 1s1 electron to the superatomic electron count and occupies a PdAg3 tetrahedron. The distributions of isomers corresponding to different dispositions of the outer capping Ag atoms are investigated by multinuclear VT&#8197;NMR spectroscopy. The emissive state of 3 has a lifetime of 200&#8197;&#956;s (&#955;ex=448; &#955;em=842), while 1 and 2 are non&#8208;emissive. The catalytic reduction of 4&#8208;nitrophenol is demonstrated with 1&#8211;3 at room temperature.

         <title>A Template&#8208;Free Pd2L4 Cage with up to Nanomolar Affinity for Chloride in Aqueous Solutions
</title>

Halide catcher: A template&#8208;free, water&#8208;soluble Pd2L4 cage that binds chloride with up to nanomolar affinity in aqueous solutions is reported here. Of the most abundant essential anions present in living organisms, this cage exclusively binds chloride. This unprecedented binding affinity/selectivity was achieved by making the best use of hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions.







Abstract
Selective binding of chloride over the other most abundant anions in living organisms is pivotal due to its essential role in physiological functions. Herein, we report a template&#8208;free Pd2L4 cage exhibiting high selectivity for medium&#8208;sized halides (i.&#8201;e., Cl&#8722;, Br&#8722;) in water owing to the size&#8208;discriminatory nature of the cage cavity. In pure water, this cage displays high selectivity and micromolar affinity for chloride. The cage shows no binding towards other biologically more abundant essential anions such as phosphates, carboxylates, or bicarbonate. This cage shows an unprecedented nanomolar affinity with 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 binding stoichiometry for chloride in aqueous&#8208;DMSO media. This high affinity was achieved with the best use of traditional hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions, as confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. This well&#8208;defined cage sequestrates F&#8722; by cleaving a B&#8722;F bond in BF4&#8722; in a facile manner in a nonpolar solvent or in the presence of excess ligand. This cage also demonstrates capture of the sub&#8208;ppm chloride level that is present in commercial D2O samples.

         <title>Elemental Magnesium as an Early Transition Metal Substitute: From Pentafulvene Coordination to Deprotonation of Amines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surfing on the pentafulvene: The reaction of elemental magnesium and a pentafulvene indicates the formation of a magnesium pentafulvene complex as an intermediate, in a coordination mode that is only known for early transition metals. This species is interceptable in one&#8208;pot reactions with secondary amines to yield unprecedented magnesium amide half sandwich complexes.







Abstract
The reaction of magnesium turnings and 6,6&#8208;di&#8208;para&#8208;tolylpentafulvene was investigated. Under mild conditions, the magnesium dissolves, forming the MgII complex 1 with a &#960;&#8208;&#951;5&#8201;:&#8201;&#963;&#8208;&#954;1 coordinating ligand of the dimerized pentafulvene, analyzed by NMR and XRD investigations. As a magnesium pentafulvene complex was a possible intermediate, amines were employed as intercepting agents. Thereby, the amines were formally deprotonated by elemental magnesium, yielding the first examples of Cp'Mg(THF)2NR2 complexes. This reaction competes with the formation of 1 and a consecutive formal [1,5]&#8208;H&#8208;shift forming an ansa&#8208;magnesocene. Employing amines with low basicity gave quantitative conversion to the amide complexes.

         <title>Use of Conglomerate Mixed Crystals to Deracemize a Stable Racemic&#8208;Compound&#8208;Forming System</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Starting from a deracemizable conglomerate (blue and red cubes), it is possible to substitute in the solid&#8208;state part of the blue and red enantiomers with chemically related enantiomers (green and yellow cubes) that crystallize as a racemic compound. The mirror&#8208;image solid solutions (enriched mixed crystals) could be deracemized by temperature cycling (deracemized mixed crystals). More information can be found in the Research Article by G. Coquerel and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202300441).

         <title>Steric Effects on the Chelation of Mn2+ and Zn2+ by Hexadentate Polyimidazole Ligands: Modeling Metal Binding by Calprotectin Site 2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently, there has been increasing interest in the design of ligands that bind Mn2+ with high affinity and selectivity, but this remains a difficult challenge. It has been proposed that the cavity size of the binding pocket is a critical factor in most synthetic and biological examples of selective Mn2+ binding. Here, we use a bioinspired approach adapted from the hexahistidine binding site of the manganese&#8208;sequestering protein calprotectin to systematically study the effect of cavity size on Mn2+ and Zn2+ binding. We have designed a hexadentate, trisimidazole ligand whose cavity size can be tuned through peripheral modification of the steric bulk of the imidazole substituents. Conformational dynamics and redox potentials of the complexes are dependent on ligand steric bulk. Stability constants are consistent with the hypothesis that larger ligand cavities are relatively favorable for Mn2+ over Zn2+, but this effect alone may not be sufficient to achieve Mn2+ selectivity.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The structure of the Viologen&#8208;Phenylene&#8208;Imidazole (VPI) guest, previously shown to be bound by cucurbit[7]uril (CB[7]) with binding modes depending on pH and silver ions, has been extended by adding hydrophobic groups on the two extremities of VPI before investigations of CB[7] binding by NMR, ITC, X&#8208;ray diffraction, UV&#8208;vis and fluorescence spectroscopies. With an imidazole station extended by a naphthalene group (VPI&#8208;N), binding modes of CB[7] are similar to those previously observed. However, with the viologen extended by a tolyl group (T&#8208;VPI), CB[7] preferentially sits on station T, shuttling between the T and P stations at acid pH or after Ag+ addition. The CB[7]&#8226;T&#8208;VPI complex thus behaves as a metal&#8208;actuated thermodynamic stop&#8208;and&#8208;go molecular shuttle featured by fast and autonomous ring translocation between two stations and a continuum for fractional station occupancy solely and easily controlled by Ag+ concentration.</dc:description>

         <title>UV&#8208;blocking and light&#8208;responsive poly (&#949;&#8208;caprolactone) /ZIF&#8208;8 multifunctional composite films for efficient antibacterial activities</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Antibacterial photodynamic therapy (APDT) has received considerable attention owing to its superiority. ZIF&#8208;8 was used to address the poor stability of the photosensitizer Rose Bengal (RB) encapsulation to synthesize RB@ZIF&#8208;8 NPs, which were doped into a composite film with poly (&#949;&#8208;caprolactone) (PCL) and polyvinyl alcohol&#8208;quaternary ammonium chitosan (PVA&#8208;QCS) as substrates to form composite films (PQZ). The composite films exhibited excellent photodynamic sterilization and good resistance to bacterial adhesion. The tensile strength of the film increased to 43.4 MPa, which was approximately 1.8 times that of the PCL film. With the addition of SiO2 and RB@ZIF&#8208;8 NPs, the film exhibited water repellency and UV&#8208;blocking properties. RAW264.7 cells were selected using the MTT method to confirm that the composite film had excellent biocompatibility and had no significant inhibitory effect on cell growth and reproduction. PQZ multifunctional composite films show potential as novel APDT antimicrobial materials for food packaging.</dc:description>

         <title>Defluorination of fluorophenols by a nonheme iron(IV)&#8208;oxo species: observation of a new intermediate along the reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;valent iron(IV)&#8208;oxo intermediates are versatile oxidants in the biotransformation of various substrates by metalloenzymes and catalyze essential reactions for human health but also in the biodegradation of toxic organic pollutants in the environment. Herein, we report a biomimetic system that efficiently reacts with fluorophenols through defluorination reactions and trap and characterize various short&#8208;lived intermediates along the reaction mechanism. We present the synthesis and characterization of a nonheme iron(IV)&#8208;oxo species and study its reactivity patterns with a series of trihalophenols (X = F, Cl, Br). A combined experimental and computational study reveals that the oxidative dehalogenation of 2,4,6&#8208;trifluorophenol is initiated with an H&#8208;atom abstraction from the phenolic group by the iron(IV)&#8208;oxo species resulting in the formation of a phenolate radical and an iron(III)&#8208;hydroxo species. This iron(III)&#8208;hydroxo species forms an adduct with the oxidized substrate with lmax at 558 nm which subsequently decays to give quinones as products.</dc:description>

         <title>Ni&#8208;Catalyzed Photochemical C&#8208;N Coupling of Amides with (Hetero)aryl  Chlorides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This paper reports a photochemical C&#8208;N coupling of abundant, but less reactive aryl chlorides, with structurally diverse primary and secondary amides by Ni&#8208;mediated without an external photocatalyst. Under the irradiation of light (390&#8208;395 nm) with a soluble organic amine as the base, the reaction allows for the successful transformation of (hetero)aryl chlorides to a wide range of N&#8208;aryl amides. More than 60 examples are shown, demonstrating the feasibility and applicability of this protocol in organic synthesis. Mechanic studies indicate that this amidation proceeds via a Ni(I)&#8208;Ni(III) catalytic cycle.</dc:description>

         <title>The Impact of the Solvent Dielectric Constant on A&#8592; NH3 Dative Bond Depends on the Nature of the Lewis Electron&#8208;Pair Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The present work aims to determine to what extent the value of the dielectric constant of the solvent can influence the dative bond in Lewis electron pair bonding systems. For this purpose, two different systems, namely H3B&#172;NH3 and {Zn&#172;(NH3)}2+, were studied in selected solvents with significantly different dielectric constants. Based on the results resulting from state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art computational methods using DFT, constrained DFT, energy decomposition analyses, solvent accessible surface area, and charge transfer calculations, we found that the stability of the neutral H3B&#172;NH3 system increases with increasing solvent polarity. In contrast, the opposite trend is observed for the positively charged {Zn&#172;(NH3)}2+. The observed changes are attributed to different charge redistributions in neutral and charged complexes, which are reflected by a different response to the solvent and are quantified by changes in solvation energies.</dc:description>

         <title>A Common C2&#8208;Symmetric 2,2&#8242;&#8208;Biphenol Building Block and its Application in the Synthesis of (+)&#8208;di&#8208;epi&#8208;Gonytolide A</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A variety of biaryl polyketides exhibit remarkable bioactivities. However, their synthetic accessibility is often challenging. Herein, the enantioselective preparation and synthetic application of an axially chiral 2,2&#8242;&#8208;biphenol building block is outlined that represents a common motif of these intriguing natural products. Based on the highly regioselective and scalable bromination of a phenol precursor, a coupling process by Lipshutz cuprate oxidation was developed. A copper&#8208;mediated deracemization strategy proved to be superior to derivatization or kinetic resolution approaches. Key steps in the overall building block synthesis were rationalized through DFT&#8208;studies. Utilizing the 2,2&#8242;&#8208;biphenol, a highly diastereoselective five step synthesis of formerly unknown (+)&#8209;di&#8208;epi&#8208;gonytolide A was developed, thus showcasing the building block&#8217;s general potential for the synthesis of natural products and their derivatives. En route, the first enantioselective construction of a chromone dimer intermediate was established.</dc:description>

         <title>Cooperative Supramolecular Polymerization of Triphenylamine bis&#8208;Urea Macrocycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we probe the hydrogen bond&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly of a triphenylamine (TPA) bis&#8208;urea macrocycle in the presence and absence of guests. Comprised of methylene urea&#8208;bridged TPAs with exterior tridodecyloxy benzene solubilizing groups, the macrocycle exhibits concentration&#8208;dependent aggregate formation in THF and H2O/THF mixtures as characterized by&#160;1H NMR and DOSY experiments. Its assembly processes were further probed by temperature&#8208;dependent UV/Vis and fluorescence spectroscopy. Upon heating, UV/Vis spectra exhibit a hypsochromic shift in the&#160;&#955;max, while fluorescence spectra show an increase in emission intensity. Conversely, the protected macrocycle that lacks hydrogen bond donors demonstrates no significant change. Thermodynamic analysis indicates a cooperative self&#8208;assembly pathway with distinct nucleation and elongation regimes. The morphology and structure of the aggregate were elucidated by dynamic light scattering, atomic force microscopy, scanning and transmission electron microscopy. Variable temperature emission spectra were utilized to monitor the impact of guests, such as diphenylacetylene, that can be bound in the columnar channels. The findings suggest that the elongation of assemblies is influenced by the presence of these guests. In comparison, diphenyl sulfoxide, likely functioning as a chain stopper, limited the assembly size.&#160;&#160;These studies suggest that judicious selection of (co)monomers may modulate the function and utility of these supramolecular systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Modulating the Shape of Short Metal&#8208;Mediated Heteroleptic Tapes of Porphyrins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In view of developing artificial light&#8208;responsive complex systems, the preparation of discrete and robust heteroleptic assemblies of different chromophores in precisely defined positions is of great value since they would allow to investigate directional processes unavailable in symmetrical architectures. Here we describe the preparation, through a modular stepwise approach, and characterization of four novel and robust metal&#8208;mediated heteroleptic 4+3 porphyrin tapes, labeled D4&#8208;T4&#8208;D4, D3&#8208;T4&#8208;D3, D4&#8208;T3&#8208;D4 , and D3&#8208;T3&#8208;D3, where a central meso&#8208;tetrapyridylporphyrin (either 3'&#8208;TPyP = T3or 4'&#8208;TPyP = T4) is connected to two equal cis&#8208;dipyridylporphyrins (either 3&#8242;cisDPyMP = D3 or 4&#8242;cisDPyMP = D4) through four {t,c,c&#8208;RuCl2(CO)2} fragments. Whereas D4&#8208;T4&#8208;D4 is flat, the tapes containing at least one 3&#8242;PyP, i.e. D3&#8208;T4&#8208;D3, D4&#8208;T3&#8208;D4, and D3&#8208;T3&#8208;D3, have unprecedented &#8211; and well defined &#8211; 3D geometries, and each exists in solution as a pair of stereoisomers in slow conformational equilibrium. The X&#8208;ray molecular structures of two such conformers, the C&#8208;shaped (D3&#8208;T4&#8208;D3)C and the z&#8208;shaped (D4&#8208;T3&#8208;D4)z, were determined and are fully consistent with the solution NMR findings.</dc:description>

         <title>Kinetic Resolution of 2&#8208;Aryldihydroquinolines using Lithiation &#8211; Synthesis of Chiral 1,2&#8208; and 1,4&#8208;Dihydroquinolines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Highly enantiomerically enriched dihydrohydroquinolines were prepared in two steps from quinoline. Addition of aryllithiums to quinoline with tert&#8208;butoxycarbonyl (Boc) protection gave N&#8208;Boc&#8208;2&#8208;aryl&#8208;1,2&#8208;dihydroquinolines. These were treated with n&#8208;butyllithium and electrophilic trapping occurred exclusively at C&#8208;4 of the dihydroquinoline, a result supported by DFT studies. Variable temperature NMR spectroscopy gave kinetic data for the barrier to rotation of the carbonyl group (&#916;G&#8225;&#160;~&#160;49 kJ mol&#8211;1, 195 K). Lithiation using the diamine sparteine allowed kinetic resolutions with high enantioselectivities (enantiomer ratio up to 99:1). The enantioenriched 1,2&#8208;dihydroquinolines could be converted to 1,4&#8208;dihydroquinolines with retention of stereochemistry. Further functionalisation led to trisubstituted products. Reduction provided enantioenriched tetrahydroquinolines, whereas acid&#8208;promoted removal of Boc led to quinolines, and this was applied to a synthesis of the antimalarial compound M5717.</dc:description>

         <title>Using Solution History to Control Hydrogel Properties of a Perylene Bisimide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract: pH dependence on water soluble aggregates is well&#8208;known in the field of low molecular weight gelators (LMWGs), with different aggregates sometimes having very different properties depending on their final pH. This aggregation determines their applications and performance. Here, we investigate the pH dependence of perylene bisimide gels; initially solutions are formed at a high pH and gels form as the pH is decreased. We find it is not only the final pH but also the starting pH that can impact the resulting gel. We use small angle neutron scattering (SANS), rheology, 1H NMR spectroscopy and absorption spectroscopy to examine the effect of starting pH on gelation kinetics and final gel properties. Adjusting the solution from pH 9 (where there are few or no aggregates) to pH 6 results in the formation of different worm&#8208;like micelles than the ones directly formed at pH 6, leading to again gels with different mechanical properties. This work highlights the importance of controlling the pH of solutions before gelation, but also opens up more possible morphologies and therefore more properties from the same molecule.</dc:description>

         <title>Sunlight Induced and Alternative Sc(OTf) 3 &#160;Catalyzed Remote C&#8722;H Halogenation of Indoles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A mild and catalyst&#8208;free sunlight induced protocol for the remote meta&#160;bromination of electron&#8208;deficient indoles is described for the first time. Herein, N&#8208;bromosaccharin is activated by sunlight irradiation. Alternately, a synergistic activation model (Sc(OTf)3/HFIP) has also been developed for the activation of haloniums, complementary to the light induced strategy. In addition, the cascade C6&#8722;H bromination and benzylic C&#8722;H oxidation under photocatalytic conditions was also discussed. High regio&#8208;and chem&#8208;selectivity, mild reaction conditions, and scalability demonstrate great potential of the developed methods in practical applications and further functionalization.</dc:description>

         <title>Polarization&#8208;Sensitive Detector of Two&#8208;Dimensional Multilayer Hybrid Perovskite Crystals Showing High Polarization Ratio to Weak Light</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) hybrid perovskite materials have been widely used for polarization&#8208;sensitive photodetection due to their fascinating optical and physical attributes. However, studies on those materials that enable strong polarized&#8208;light activities under a weak&#8208;light condition remain quite scarce. Here, by tailoring aromatic cation into 3D prototype, we have successfully obtained a new 2D hybrid perovskite, (FPEA)2(MA)Pb2Br7 (1, where FPEA is 4&#8208;fluorophenethylammonium and MA is methylammonium). The alternative alignment of inorganic and organic structural components results in significant anisotropy, including optical absorption and electric conductivity. The coupling effect of these anisotropic properties in 1 gives rise to strong dichroic activities toward detecting polarized light. Especially, under weak light intensity (~330 nW/cm2), it can still generate a large polarization ratio up to 1.35, which is even higher than those of some typical 2D materials (i.e., GeSe ~ 1.09). Besides, single crystal&#8208;based photodetector of 1 displays fascinating detecting performances, including large photocurrent on/off ratio (~ 104), fast response time (~ 154/182 &#956;s) and excellent antifatigued stability. These findings disclose the potentials of 1 as a robust candidate for detecting weak polarized light, which has practical applications in the field of polarized optoelectronics.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Two novel nona coordinated Eu(III) complexes [Eu(btfa)3(Ph&#8208;TerPyr)] (Eu&#8208;1) and [Eu(NTA)3(Ph&#8208;TerPyr)] (Eu&#8208;2) &#160;have been synthesized and characterized. The structure of the complexes was elucidated by density functional theory (DFT) methods. The experimental photophysical properties of the complexes were investigated and complemented with theoretical calculations. Effective energy transfer (ET) pathways for the sensitized red luminescence is discussed. The complexes were tested as emitting layers (EML) in OLEDs. At the optimum doping concentration of 4 wt%, the double&#8208;EML OLEDs of Eu&#8208;1 exhibited red electroluminescence (EL) with an EQE of 4.0% and maximum brightness (B) = 1179 cd/m2, maximum current efficiency (&#951;c) = 5.64 cd/A, maximum power efficiency (&#951;p) = 4.78 lm/W with very low turn&#8208;on voltage (Vturn&#8208;on) = 3.6 V at the current density (J) of 10 mA/cm2. Interestingly, the double&#8208;EML OLEDs of Eu&#8208;2 at the optimum concentration of 3 wt%, displayed an outstanding EL performance with EQE of 7.32% and B = 838 cd/m2, &#951;c = 10.19 cd/A, &#951;p = 10.33 lm/W, and Vturn&#8208;on = 3.1 V at J =10 mA/cm2.

         <title>Electron&#8208;rich MoIV3&#8208;Polyoxomolybdates Resembling the Paratungstic Archetype</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first polyoxometalates (POMs) composed of MoIV, MoV2, discrete d1&#8208;MoV and MoVI, [MoIV3MoV6MoVI4O32(&#956; 2 &#8208;OH)(&#956; 3 &#8208;OH)py9] (1), was prepared from the solvothermal partial oxidation of [MoIV3O2(O2CCH3)6(H2O)3]ZnCl4 in a mixture of pyridine and water. The MoV=O adduct&#8208;free unit [H2Mo12O33py9] presents the 11e&#8208;reduced Mo derivative of the paratungtic archetype. The use of methanol, ethanol, n&#8208;propyl alcohol and triglycol instead of water produced the isostructural [MoIV3MoV6MoVI4O32(&#956;3&#8208;OH)(&#956;2&#8208;OR)py9]( R = CH3, 2; C2H5, 3; C3H7, 4; C2H4OH, 5), providing the first examples of MoIV3&#8208;POMs containing bridging alkoxyl groups. The addition of [CrIIIMo6O24]9&#8208; led to the substitution of {MoV=O}3+ with {CrIII&#8208;py}3+ in the allomer [MoIV3MoV5MoVI4CrIIIO32(&#956;&#8208;OH)2py10] (6). Using a mixture of Mo3 and MoW2 precursors afforded WVI&#8208;incorporated allomer [MoIV3MoV6MoVIWVI3O32(&#956;&#8208;OH)2py9] (7). The complete substitution of MoVI with WVI by using a mixture of the Mo2W, MoW2 and W3 precursors produced the diamagnetic [MoIV3MoV6WVI4O33(&#956;3&#8208;OH)py9]&#8208; (syn&#8208;8) resulting from the anti&#8594;syn conversion between the top and bottom M3 triads concomitant with MoV&#8208;MoV bonding. Both anti&#8208;1&#8208;7 and syn&#8208;8 have been characterized by X&#8208;ray single crystal structural analyses. The spin distribution and magnetic interactions have been investigated by temperature&#8208;dependent magnetic susceptibility and DFT theoretical calculations. Heterogeneous hydrogen transfer catalysis has been examined by the Lewis catalysis field (LCF) theory.</dc:description>

Until now, it is still a great challenge to obtain such materials. In this paper, we synthesized a complex of (C5NH13Cl)2MnBr4 (1) with structural phase transition near room temperature. The phase transition further induces the switchable magnetic properties, dielectric anomalies and luminescent response at the same range of temperature. It is the first time to observe the synergetic effect of magnetism, dielectricity and luminescence near room temperature in the same molecular complex.</dc:description>

         <title>Cs2AgBiCl6: a novel, high&#8208;efficient and stable visible&#8208;light photocatalyst for degradation of organic dyes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the past decades, great efforts have been made to develop novel visible&#8208;light photocatalysts to achieve high photocatalytic efficiency by utilizing visible light, the largest proportion of solar energy. As a new type of photocatalyst materials, all&#8208;inorganic lead&#8208;free halide double perovskites have begun to attract widespread interest. Herein, double perovskite Cs2AgBiCl6 was developed into a visible&#8208;light photocatalyst for degrading organic dyes. Cs2AgBiCl6 was prepared by the hydrochloric acid precipitation and anti&#8208;solvent recrystallization methods, respectively, and was used to degrade organic dyes under visible light. Samples prepared by the anti&#8208;solvent recrystallization method are smaller than those prepared by the hydrochloric acid precipitation method, which can degrade 95.7% of Sudan III in 10 min and show excellent photocatalytic activity. The cyclic experiments demonstrate that Cs2AgBiCl6 has a good cycle stability. Moreover, Cs2AgBiCl6&#8208;AS also exhibits good photocatalytic degradation ability for Methyl red and Malachite green. These distinctive results indicate that Cs2AgBiCl6 may be a promising material for developing novel, high&#8208;efficient and stable visible&#8208;light photocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Applications of Bicyclo[1.1.0]butyl and Azabicyclo[1.1.0]butyl Organometallics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metalated (aza)bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes are currently experiencing a renaissance, as evidenced by the numerous reports in the last 5&#8197;years that have relied on such intermediates to facilitate new reactivity or generate novel fragments. This review explores the broad range of chemical transformations that have utilized metalated (aza)bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes as linchpin reagents from their first reported use in synthesis to the present day.







Abstract
The use of metalated (aza)bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes in synthesis is currently experiencing a renaissance, as evidenced by the numerous reports in the last 5&#8197;years that have relied on such intermediates to undergo unique transformations or generate novel fragments. Since their discovery, these species have been demonstrated to participate in a wide range of reactions with carbon and heteroatom electrophiles, as well as metal complexes, to facilitate the rapid diversification of (aza)bicyclo[1.1.0]butane&#8208;containing compounds. Key to this is the relative acidity of the bridgehead C&#8722;H bonds which promotes facile deprotonation and subsequent functionalization of an unsubstituted position on the carbon framework via the intermediacy of a metalated (aza)bicyclo[1.1.0]butane. Additionally, the late&#8208;stage incorporation of deuterium atoms in strained fragments has led to the elucidation of numerous reaction mechanisms that involve strained bicycles. The continued investigation into the inimitable reactivity of metalated bicycles will cement their importance within the field of organometallic chemistry.

         <title>Understanding Off&#8208;Cycle and Deactivation Pathways in Radical&#8208;Type Carbene Transfer Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Radical&#8208;type carbene transfer catalysis is an efficient method for C&#8722;C coupling reactions, but also suffers from off&#8208;cycle and deactivation pathways, such as hydrogen atom transfer and the formation of N&#8208;enolate and bridging carbenes. In this concept article, we demonstrate that off&#8208;cycle species not always lead to a dead&#8208;end and can even unlock new reactivity.







Abstract
Transition metal radical&#8208;type carbene transfer catalysis is a sustainable and atom&#8208;efficient method to generate C&#8722;C bonds, especially to produce fine chemicals and pharmaceuticals. A significant amount of research has therefore been devoted to applying this methodology, which resulted in innovative routes toward otherwise synthetically challenging products and a detailed mechanistic understanding of the catalytic systems. Furthermore, combined experimental and theoretical efforts elucidated the reactivity of carbene radical complexes and their off&#8208;cycle pathways. The latter can imply the formation of N&#8208;enolate and bridging carbenes, and undesired hydrogen atom transfer by the carbene radical species from the reaction medium which can lead to catalyst deactivation. In this concept paper, we demonstrate that understanding off&#8208;cycle and deactivation pathways not only affords solutions to circumvent them, but can also uncover novel reactivity for new applications. In particular, considering off&#8208;cycle species involved in metalloradical catalysis can stimulate further development of radical&#8208;type carbene transfer reactions.

         <title>Reply to &#8220;Where is the Macrocycle?&#8221; Correspondence on &#8220;Simultaneous Organic and Inorganic Host&#8211;guest Chemistry within Pillararene&#8208;Protein Cage Frameworks&#8221;</title>

Abstract
Our recent publication in Chem. Eur. J. 2022, 28, e202104341 has inspired Prof. Peter&#8197;B. Crowley (P.C.) to write a Correspondence questioning the presented concept of electrostatic self&#8208;assembly. The offered criticism is twofold: 1) the role of the cationic pillar[5]arene macrocycle to act as molecular glue in the formation of electrostatically driven protein assemblies is questioned by arguing that the pillararene is not incorporated into the frameworks. 2) Later, P.C. speculates that when the frameworks form, the role of electrostatic interactions is not firmly established and cation&#8208;pi bonding is the more plausible interaction. In this response, the raised comments are addressed. We present direct experimental NMR evidence showing that the pillar[5]arene is incorporated into the frameworks. Furthermore, we discuss the electrostatic self&#8208;assembly and our ferritin&#8208;related research line more broadly and clarify the role of key experiments.

Crowley (P.C.) to write a Correspondence questioning the presented concept of electrostatic self-assembly. The offered criticism is twofold: 1) the role of the cationic pillar[5]arene macrocycle to act as molecular glue in the formation of electrostatically driven protein assemblies is questioned by arguing that the pillararene is not incorporated into the frameworks. 2) Later, P.C. speculates that when the frameworks form, the role of electrostatic interactions is not firmly established and cation-pi bonding is the more plausible interaction. In this response, the raised comments are addressed. We present direct experimental NMR evidence showing that the pillar[5]arene is incorporated into the frameworks. Furthermore, we discuss the electrostatic self-assembly and our ferritin-related research line more broadly and clarify the role of key experiments.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

This Correspondence raises some questions around the recent publication (Chem. Eur. J. 2022, 28, e202104341) by Prof. M. Kostiainen et&#8197;al. The original authors have replied to this Correspondence in the article chem.202201110, which is also linked to the original article.







Abstract
Kostiainen and co&#8208;workers claim to have prepared crystals of ferritin by &#8220;electrostatically bridging&#8221; the protein with a cationic pillar[5]arene. Questions remain regarding the contribution of the pillar[5]arene to protein assembly and the putative role as a molecular glue.

         <title>Flow Synthesis of Gigantic Porphyrinic Cages: Facile Synthesis of P12L24 and Discovery of Kinetic Product P9L18</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report a continuous flow methodology for the facile and high&#8208;yielding synthesis of the porphyrin&#8208;based self&#8208;assembled organic cage, P12L24, along with the serendipitous discovery of a kinetic product, P9L18 cage, which has been characterized by MALDI&#8208;TOF MS, NMR, and AFM analysis. A theoretical study suggests a tricapped trigonal prismatic geometry for P9L18. Unlike P12L24, P9L18 is unstable and readily decomposes into monomers and small oligomers. While the batch synthesis produces only the thermodynamic product P12L24, the continuous flow process generates not only the thermodynamic product but also kinetic products, such as P9L18, illustrating the advantages of the continuous flow process for the synthesis of self&#8208;assembled cages and the exploration of new non&#8208;equilibrium assemblies.</dc:description>

         <title>Organoiridium Complexes Enhance Cellular Defense Against Reactive Aldehydes Species</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although reactive aldehyde species (RASP) are associated with the pathogenesis of many major diseases, there are currently no clinically approved treatments for RASP overload. Conventional aldehyde detox agents are stoichiometric reactants that get consumed upon reacting with their biological targets, which limits their therapeutic efficiency. To achieve longer&#8208;lasting detoxification effects, small&#8208;molecule intracellular metal catalysts (SIMCats) were used to protect cells by converting RASP into non&#8208;toxic alcohols. It was shown that SIMCats were significantly more effective in lowering cell death from the treatment with 4&#8208;hydroxynon&#8208;2&#8208;enal than aldehyde scavengers over a 72 h period. Studies revealed that SIMCats reduced the aldehyde accumulation in cells exposed to the known RASP inducer arsenic trioxide. This work demonstrates that SIMCats offer unique benefits over stochiometric agents, potentially providing new ways to combat diseases with greater selectivity and efficiency than existing approaches.</dc:description>

         <title>Rh&#8208;Catalyzed Direct Decarbonylative Borylation of Carboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Rh catalyzed method for direct decarbonylative borylation of carboxylic acid has been developed. This protocol exhibits a wide scope, is scalable and successfully used to late&#8208;stage diversification of many carboxylic acid containing drugs. One&#8208;pot borylation/derivatization reaction was also achieved and may open the door to explore new transformation from carboxylic acid.







Abstract
Carboxylic acids are abundant, low cost and environmentally friendly, direct convert carboxylic acids into valued&#8208;added compounds are in high demand. Herein, we report a Rh(I) catalyzed direct decarbonylative borylation of aryl and alkyl carboxylic acid using TFFH as activator. This protocol features excellent functional&#8208;group tolerance and a broad substrate scope including natural product and drugs. A gram&#8208;scale decarbonylative borylation reaction of Probenecid is also presented. In addition, the utility of this strategy is highlighted by a one&#8208;pot decarbonylative borylation/ derivatization sequence.

         <title>Nature&#8208;Inspired Chemistry of Complex Alkaloids: Combining Targeted Molecular Networking Approach and Semisynthetic Strategy to Access Rare Communesins in a Marine&#8208;Derived Penicillium expansum</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rare heptacyclic alkaloids, namely communesins, could be specifically targeted on a molecular network and further obtained by semisynthesis. This work describes a comprehensive strategy to access unrevealed chemodiversity from fungi.







Abstract
Communesins are rare alkaloids isolated from fungi of the genus Penicillium. In this work, the extract of a marine&#8208;derived Penicillium expansum strain was studied using targeted molecular networking approach allowing to detect 65 communesins including 55 new ones. A fragmentation pattern for dimethylvinyl communesins was established and a script was implemented allowing to predict the structure and map all communesins in a global molecular network. A semisynthetic strategy was carried out to obtain some minor congeners from the two isolated communesins A and B. Nine communesins were then synthetised: two of them were already described as produced by the studied strain; four are new natural products which occurrence in the extracts was confirmed; three are new semi&#8208;synthetic analogues never described so far. These communesins were evaluated for their cytotoxicity on two human cancer cell lines KB and MCF&#8208;7 leading to a preliminary study of their structure&#8208;activity relationships.

         <title>Extending the Palette of Green Coumarin Photocages &#8211; Oligonucleotide Fragmentation and Superior 5&#8217;&#8208;Caps</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this article, the green&#8208;light&#8208;absorbing DCCM photocage was modified to not just allow oligonucleotide release (OFF&#8594;ON) but also oligonucleotide fragmentation and thereby serve an additional regulation pathway (ON&#8594;OFF) that gives more freedom in gene regulation. Furthermore, the uncaging efficiency of DCCM by rigidification of the coumarin core was improved, resulting in an additional 20&#8197;nm red&#8208;shift.







Abstract
The possibilities of dicyanocoumarin (DCCM)&#8208;modified oligonucleotides are expanded to not just allow their release and therefore activation with green light (OFF&#8594;ON) but to also now offer a solution for their fragmentation after exposure to green light (ON&#8594;OFF). Furthermore, an answer to the decreasing uncaging quantum yields often faced when working with red&#8208;shifted photocages is given and showed that rigidified DCCM 5&#8217;&#8208;caps outperform their predecessors. Those two new 5&#8217;&#8208;caps with ATTO 390 motif or julolidine core are compatible with copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed alkyne&#8208;azide cycloadditions (CuAACs) and therefore suitable for efficient caging through cyclization or more bioconjugation reactions. Due to their planarization, they even experience an additional red&#8208;shift which is important for their use in biological applications.

         <title>Stoichiometry&#8208;Directed Two&#8208;Level Hierarchical Growth of Lanthanide&#8208;Based Supramolecular Nanoarchitectures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The on&#8208;surface synthesis process of a metal&#8208;organic supramolecular structure based on hierarchical growth driven by Dy atoms is shown in this work. Modifying the stoichiometry, it is possible to tune the size of the tecton unit in a controlled manner.







Abstract
The design of a well&#8208;ordered arrangement of atoms on a solid surface has long been sought due to the envisioned applications in many different fields. On&#8208;surface synthesis of metal&#8208;organic networks is one of the most promising fabrication techniques. Hierarchical growth, which involves coordinative schemes with weaker interactions, favours the formation of extended areas with the desired complex structure. However, the control of such hierarchical growth is in its infancy, particularly for lanthanide&#8208;based architectures. Here the hierarchical growth of a Dy&#8208;based supramolecular nanoarchitecture on Au(111) is described. Such an assembly is based on a first hierarchical level of metallo&#8208;supramolecular motifs, which in a second level of hierarchy self&#8208;assemble through directional hydrogen bonds, giving rise to a periodic two&#8208;dimensional supramolecular porous network. Notably, the size of the metal&#8208;organic based tecton of the first level of hierarchy can be tailored by modifying the metal&#8208;ligand stoichiometric ratio.

         <title>Tuning the Photophysical Properties and Photostability of Bis(naphthobipyrrolylmethene) derived BODIPY via Functionalization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of NIR absorbing and emitting, naphthobipyrrole derived BODIPY dyes are reported. These dyes possess different functional groups viz. &#8208;CHO, &#8208;CN, &#8208;NO2, &#8208;Br and Ph at its &#945;,&#945;'&#8208;positions. All the derivatives were characterized thoroughly via various spectroscopic means as well as single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structural analyses. Impacts of functionalization on its photophysical properties as well as photostability were evaluated. For instance, incorporation of the phenyl moieties at the &#945;, &#945;'&#8208;positions by Suzuki coupling of the dibromo&#8208;derivative 4 with phenyl boronic acid led to substantial bathochromic shift in absorption (762 vs 727 nm) and emission (778 vs 744 nm) relative to the unsubstituted parent dye VI. Theoretical calculations have been performed by ground state optimization to evaluate the electronic transitions which supports experimental observation.</dc:description>

         <title>A greener pathway to enantiopurity: mechanochemical deracemization through abrasive grinding.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the first case of mechanochemical deracemization by using liquid&#8208;assisted abrasive grinding. The target molecule is a precursor of Paclobutrazol, an important fungicide and plant growth inhibitor. Using mechanochemical deracemization, we are even able to transform a 10% ee scalemic mixture of this latter in an enantioenriched product of 97% ee in a couple of hours. This is substantially shorter compared to solution&#8208;based deracemization methodologies. The present paper thus introduces an efficient and greener process to enantiopure material.</dc:description>

         <title>A novel C doped MoS2/CoP/MoO2 ternary heterostructure nanoflower for hydrogen evolution reaction at wide pH range and efficient overall water splitting in alkaline media</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;efficiency bifunctional catalysts is still a challenge for hydrogen production through overall water splitting. This paper reports the in&#8208;situ synthesis of C&#8208;doped MoS2/CoP/MoO2 using bacterial cellulose (BC) as the reducing agent and the source of C and using BC (MoS2/Co1.2MoO4.2&#183;1.2H2O/BC) as the template. Heterogeneous structure for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and alkaline water electrolysis in a wide pH range. Due to the large number of defect sites caused by C doping and the synergy between these three active components (MoS2, CoP and MoO2), the HER and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activities of the catalyst have been greatly improved. Therefore, during HER, a small initial overpotential (27 mV) was achieved in 1.0 M KOH. In 0.5 M H2SO4, 0.1 M PBS and 1.0 M KOH, the current density reached 10 mA cm&#8208;2 at overpotentials of 123.4, 150, and 139 mV, respectively. For OER, an overpotential of 268 mV was required to achieve 10 mA cm&#8208;2. The alkaline two&#8208;electrode device composed of C doped MoS2/CoP/MoO2 delivers 10 mA cm&#8208;2 at a low potential of 1.51 V and can be easily driven by a single AA battery.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Structure&#8208;Activity Relationship Studies of C(13)&#8208;Desmethylene&#8208;(&#8211;)&#8208;Zampanolide Analogs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We describe the synthesis and biochemical and cellular profiling of five partially reduced or demethylated analogs of the marine macrolide (&#8722;)&#8208;zampanolide (ZMP). These analogs were derived from 13&#8208;desmethylene&#8208;(&#8211;)&#8208;zampanolide (DM&#8208;ZMP), which is an equally potent cancer cell growth inhibitor as ZMP. Key steps in the synthesis of all compounds were the formation of the dioxabicyclo[15.3.1]heneicosane core by an intramolecular HWE reaction (67%&#8208;95% yield) and a stereoselective aza&#8208;aldol reaction with an (S)&#8208;BINOL&#8208;derived sorbamide transfer complex, to establish the C(20) stereocenter (24%&#8208;71% yield). As the sole exception, for the 5&#8208;desmethyl macrocycle, ring&#8208;closure relied on macrolactonization; however, elaboration of the macrocyclization product into the corresponding zampanolide analog was unsuccessful. Compared to DM&#8208;ZMP, all modifications led to reduced cellular activity and lowered microtubule&#8208;binding affinity, albeit to a different extent. For compounds incorporating the reactive enone moiety of ZMP, IC50's for cancer cell growth inhibition varied between 5 nM and 133 nM, compared to 1 nM to 12 nM for DM&#8208;ZMP. Reduction of the enone double bond led to a several hundred&#8208;fold loss in growth inhibition. The cellular potency of 2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;13&#8208;desmethylene zampanolide, as the most potent analog identified, remained within a 9&#8208;fold range of that of DM&#8208;ZMP.</dc:description>

         <title>Antibodies Directed Against GalNAc&#8208; and GlcNAc&#8208;O&#8208;Tyrosine Posttranslational Modifications &#8211; a New Tool for Glycoproteomic Detection</title>

Catch as catch can. Fmoc&#8208;SPPS &#945;&#8208;GalNAc&#8208;, &#946;&#8208;GlcNAc&#8208; and &#945;&#8208;GlcNAc&#8208;O&#8208;Tyr amino acid building blocks were prepared and applied in synthesis of glycopeptide vaccine constructs and an extensive Tyr&#8208;modified glycopeptide library. Antibodies were raised and affinity purified against the antigen peptides. Evaluation by ELISA, glycopeptide microarrays and by western blot analysis showed high antibody specificity towards GalNAc&#8208; and GlcNAc&#8208;O&#8208;Tyr modifications without cross reactivity to the corresponding Ser or Thr glycopeptides.







Abstract
In the last decade, it was discovered that protein mucin&#8208;type O&#8208;glycosylation and O&#8208;GlcNAcylation modify Tyr residues besides the well explored Thr and Ser amino acids. Several glycoproteomic studies have identified &#945;&#8208;GalNAc&#8208;O&#8208;Tyr modifications, and studies propose that &#946;&#8208;GlcNAc&#8208;O&#8208;Tyr also exists as a new group of posttranslational modifications (PTMs). Specific bacterial toxins have further been identified to modify host GTPases with &#945;&#8208;GlcNAc&#8208;O&#8208;Tyr to promote bacterial virulence. Despite being identified on numerous proteins, the biological roles, biosynthesis and expression of GalNAc&#8208; and GlcNAc&#8208;O&#8208;Tyr modifications are poorly understood. A major obstacle is the lack of tools to specifically detect and identify proteins containing these modifications. With this in mind, we prepared vaccine constructs and raised antibodies to enable selective detection of proteins carrying these new PTMs. The obtained polyclonal antibody sera were evaluated using ELISA and glycopeptide microarrays and were found to be highly selective for GlcNAc&#8208; and GalNAc&#8208;O&#8208;Tyr glycopeptides over the corresponding Ser&#8208; and Thr&#8208;modifications. For microarray analysis, synthetic GlcNAc&#8208; and GalNAc&#8208;O&#8208;Tyr Fmoc&#8208;amino acids were prepared and applied in Fmoc&#8208;SPPS to obtain an extensive O&#8208;glycopeptide library. After affinity purification, the antibodies were applied in western blot analysis and showed specific detection of &#945;&#8208;GlcNAc&#8208;O&#8208;Tyr modified RhoA GTPase.

         <title>Facilitating [2+2] Photocycloadditions by Promoting Oxygen Tolerance and Substrate Activation in Water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Micellar photocatalysis allows for a simple and benign reaction set&#8208;up using water as the solvent without the need for oxygen&#8208;removing protocols. Blue light (456&#8197;nm) is absorbed by the photocatalyst and allows the [2+2] photocycloaddition to occur between &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds and activated alkenes. The observed reactivity for &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes is completely turned on by the use of a micellar solution as opposed to organic solvents. More information can be found in the Research Article by L. N&#230;sborg and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202300627).

         <title>C&#8722;H Functionalization of Heterocycles with Triplet Carbenes by means of an Unexpected 1,2&#8208;Alkyl Radical Migration
</title>

A triplet carbene is involved in the C3&#8208;H functionalization of indole heterocycles. We herein describe a combined experimental and computational study on this reaction and unveil an unexpected 1,2&#8208;alkyl radical migration pathway.







Abstract
The C&#8722;H functionalization of indole heterocycles constitutes a key strategy to leverage the synthesis of endogenous signaling molecules such as tryptamine or tryptophol. Herein, we report on the photocatalytic reaction of ethyl diazoacetate with indole, which shows an unusual solvent dependency. While C2&#8208;functionalization occurs under protic conditions, the use of aprotic solvents leads to a complete reversal of selectivity and exclusive C3&#8208;functionalization occurs. To rationalize for this unexpected reactivity switch, we have conducted detailed theoretical and experimental studies, which suggest the participation of a triplet carbene intermediate that undergoes initial C2&#8208;functionalization. A distinct cationic [1,2]&#8208;alkyl radical migration then leads to formation of C3&#8208;functionalized indole. We conclude with the application of this photocatalytic reaction to access oxidized tryptophol derivatives including gram&#8208;scale synthesis and derivatization reactions.

         <title>Sila[1]ruthenocenophanes: Long Sought&#8208;After Family Members</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
During the last three decades, silicon&#8208;bridged [1]ferrocenophanes were developed into an important class of monomers with the Me2Si&#8208;bridged [1]ferrocenophane being the most applied member. Surprisingly, the strained ruthenocene analogues are unknown. We now solved this mystery and reveal why sila[1]ruthenocenophanes are so challenging to prepare.







Abstract
During the last three decades, silicon&#8208;bridged [1]ferrocenophanes have been developed into an important class of monomers with the resulting polymers being the subject of hundreds of publications. For unknown reasons, not a single example of a silicon&#8208;bridged [1]ruthenocenophane is described in the literature. We set out to address this mystery and could synthesize the first sila[1]ruthenocenophanes. Their molecular structures as well as their heat release in the melt, render them as highly strained sandwich compounds that are polymerizable. Why did it take so long to prepare the first sila[1]ruthenocenophanes? This question is addressed by a detailed analysis of the kinetics of the salt&#8208;metathesis approach, which reveals a striking difference between ferrocene and ruthenocene.

The aromatic (C&#8722;H) sulfenylation reaction with S&#8208;acetamidomethyl cysteine sulfoxide (Cys(Acm)(O)) can be Trp&#8208; or Tyr&#8208;selective under acidic conditions. The red chloride anion team kicks the Cys(Acm)(O) ball into the Trp goal, whereas the blue trimethylsilyl team kicks the ball into the Tyr goal. The proton scoreline in the stands supports both teams. More information can be found in the Research Article by A. Otaka and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202300799).

         <title>Intermolecular Triazene Alkene Cycloaddition via Lewis Base Catalysis: Access to Diverse Trifluoromethylated Pyrazolines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel approach to chemoselective synthesis of biologically important CF3&#8208;subsituted pyrazolines was developed via a Lewis base catalyzed intermolecular triazene cycloaddition reaction of an array of terminal/internal alkenes with CF3CHN2. This strategy features a catalytic amount of 1,8&#8208;diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec&#8208;7&#8208;ene, high yields (up to 95%), wide substrate scope and excellent functional group tolerance (54 examples). Importantly, we preformed scaffold diversification of a panel of known pharmaceuticals, natural products, and bioactive heterocycles to generate the corresponding pyrazoline derivatives with potential broad bioactivities for further development.</dc:description>

         <title>Real&#8208;Time Observation for Dynamic Oscillation during the Self&#8208;Assembly and Clearance of A&#946;42</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The dynamic oscillation implicated in structural heterogeneity during the self&#8208;assembly of amyloid peptide 1&#8208;42 (A&#946;42) may play a crucial role in eliciting cellular responses. We developed a real&#8208;time monitoring platform to observe an oscillatory non&#8208;equilibrium interaction that dominated the A&#946;42 clearance by neuronal cells during interplay with an oscillator (lipopolysaccharide, LPS). Molecular dynamics studies indicated that the electrostatic and hydrophobic segments of LPS involved in the temporary heteromolecular association and slightly decelerated the intrinsic thermally&#8208;induced protein dynamics of A&#946;42. A bait&#8208;specific intervention strategy could temporarily slow down the self&#8208;propagation of A&#946;42 to extend the lifetime of autonomous oscillation and augment the A&#946;42 clearance of neuronal cells. The lifetime increment of dynamic oscillation shows a bait concentration&#8208;dependent manner to reflect the non&#8208;equilibrium binding strength. This relationship may serve as a drug&#8208;screening predictor for Alzheimer's disease drug discovery.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamically Visualized Mechano&#8208;response Supramolecular Self&#8208;assembly System for Small Molecule Release</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The mechano&#8208;response release of small molecules has received extensive attention in ultrasound (US)&#8208;controlled drug release in recent years because it can achieve non&#8208;invasive, spatiotemporally controlled precise drug release. However, the vast majority of small molecules mechano&#8208;release reported so far are almost based on polymer systems, which suffer from complex preparations and single mechano&#8208;response. Here, an isoguanosine (isoG) visualized mechano&#8208;response supramolecular self&#8208;assembly (isoG&#8208;VMRSS) system was successfully constructed by a one&#8208;pot reaction. It is completely composed of small molecules, which allows for multiple mechano&#8208;response releases of isoG (at least 9 times) and ultimately has potential for application in US drug release. A combined experimental&#8208;computational approach reveals the supramolecular network structure (formed by the joint action of related metal coordination bonds, boronate ester bonds and hydrogen bonds mediated by isoG) gradually formed inside the system is the underlying internal mechanism. Therefore, it provides a new and effective idea of small molecule release in the field of mechanochemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Ratiometric fluorescence assay for pyrophosphate based on sulfur nanodots decorated metal organic frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Selective and sensitive detection of inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi) are of great significance both for clinical applications and fundamental research. In this work, a ratiometric fluorescent probe was developed by decorating a porphyrin&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework (PCN&#8208;224) with sulfur nanodots (S&#8208;dots). The red&#8208;fluorescence of PCN&#8208;224 was significantly promoted (more than 6&#8208;fold) by S&#8208;dots through inhibiting molecular motion of porphyrin ligand, which also provided active sites for the detection of Cu2+ and PPi. Cu2+ could selectively quench the red&#8208;fluorescence of PCN&#8208;224 through coordination with porphyrin ligand, and the competition reaction between PPi and Cu2+ resulted in the decomposing of coordination and recovery of red&#8208;fluorescence. The blue&#8208;fluorescence from S&#8208;dots was deemed as effective reference, which provided a built&#8208;in correction in complex environments. Based on these photophysical properties, a ratiometric fluorescence assay was developed for the quantitative detection of Cu2+ and PPi, with a limit of detection of 0.11 and 2.66 &#956;M, respectively. The accuracy and practical applications of assays were also demonstrated by detection in tap water and human serum samples.</dc:description>

         <title>Boosting Hydrostability and Carbon Dioxide Capture of Boroxine&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks by One&#8208;Pot Oligoamine Modification</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Killing two birds with one stone. The representative of boroxine&#8208;linked COFs, COF&#8208;1, is modified with an oligoamine by one&#8208;pot condensation. The modification with the oligoamine not only boosts the water stability of COF&#8208;1, but also significantly increases its CO2 uptake capacity and CO2/N2 selectivity, especially in low pressure region. These advantages make the oligoamine&#8208;modified COF&#8208;1 suitable for capturing CO2 from humid flue gas.







Abstract
Boron&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are susceptible to nucleophilic attack by water at the electron&#8208;deficient boron sites and even slightly humid air could destroy the integrity of their porous frameworks within hours. Such instability is a major limitation to the practical applications of boron&#8208;based COFs. Herein we report a significant enhancement of hydrostability of boroxine&#8208;linked COFs (COF&#8208;1 as representative) by modification with an oligoamine (tetraethylenepentamine, TEPA), which leads to survival of the modified COF in water and long&#8208;time stability under humid atmosphere. Meanwhile, the TEPA modification also results in a considerable increase in CO2 adsorption capacity up to 13&#8197;times and a dramatic improvement in CO2/N2 selectivity in low pressure region, which make the modified COF suitable for capturing CO2 from flue gas. This work provides a facile, efficient, and scalable method to greatly improve hydrostability of boroxine&#8208;linked COFs and reshape them into high&#8208;performance CO2 adsorbents.

         <title>Latent Pronucleophiles in Lewis Base Catalysis: Enantioselective Allylation of Silyl Enol Ethers with Allylic Fluorides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lewis base catalyzed allylations of C&#8208;centered nucleophiles have been largely limited to the niche substrates with acidic C&#8208;H substituted for C&#8208;F bonds at the stabilized carbanionic carbon. Herein we report that the concept of latent pronucleophiles serves to overcome these limitations and allow for a variety of common stabilized C&#8208;nucleophiles, when they are introduced as the corresponding silylated compounds, to undergo enantioselective allylations using allylic fluorides. The reactions of silyl enol ethers afford the allylation products in good yields and with high degree of regio / stereoselectivity as well as diastereoselectivity when cyclic silyl enol ethers are used. Further examples of silylated stabilized carbon nucleophiles that undergo efficient allylation speak in favor of the general applicability of this concept to C&#8208;centered nucleophiles.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The development of an efficient process that produces bioactive medium&#8208;sized N&#8208;heterocyclic scaffolds from 2&#8208;substituted anilines using either iodosobenzene or (bis(trifluoroacetoxy)iodobenzene&#160;is reported. The tether between the sulfonamide and the aryl group can be varied to access dihydroacridine&#8208;, dibenzazepine&#8208;, or dibenzazocine scaffolds. While substitution on the aniline portion is limited to electron&#8208;neutral&#8208; or electron&#8208;poor groups, a broader range of functional groups are tolerated on the&#160;ortho&#8208;substituent and site selective C&#8208;NAr bond formation can be achieved. Preliminary mechanistic investigations suggest that medium&#8208;ring formation occurs via&#160;radical reactive intermediates.</dc:description>

         <title>Concentration&#8208;, Temperature&#8208; and Solvent&#8208;Dependent Self&#8208;Assembly: Merocyanine Dimerization as a Showcase Example for Obtaining Reliable Thermodynamic Data</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mathematical models for the concentration&#8208;, temperature&#8208; and solvent&#8208;dependent analysis of self&#8208;assembly equilibria are derived for the most simple case of dimer formation, to highlight the assumptions these models and the thus determined thermodynamic parameters are based on. The three models were applied to UV/Vis absorption data for the dimerization of a highly dipolar merocyanine dye in 1,4&#8208;dioxane. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) dilution experiments were performed as an independent reference technique. While the concentration&#8208;dependent analysis is according to our studies the most reliable method, also the less time&#8208;consuming temperature&#8208;dependent evaluation can give accurate results in the present example, despite small thermochromic effects. In contrast, the strong negative solvatochromism of the merocyanine tampers with the results from the solvent&#8208;dependent evaluation. Even though the studies presented in this work are limited to the monomer&#8208;dimer equilibrium of a dipolar dye, the basic principles can be transferred to other chromophores and different self&#8208;assembly models, including those for supramolecular polymerization.</dc:description>
