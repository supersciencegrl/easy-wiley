         <title>Catalytic Activity of Cellulose&#8208;supported Platinum and&#160;Palladium Nanoparticles for Allylbenzene Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Platinum and palladium nanoparticles were successfully deposited on tunicate cellulose via the photodeposition or microemulsion deposition method. Evenly distributed, small and narrow&#8208;sized particles in the range of 2&#8209;3 nm&#160;were obtained for microemulsion&#8208;prepared cellulose catalysts. The photodeposition method led to larger particle sizes, broader size distribution, and occasional agglomerations. The catalysts were tested in the allylbenzene hydrogenation reaction and the results were compared to commercially available catalysts. Because of smaller particles, both microemulsion&#8208;prepared catalysts and photodeposited ones show better activity than commercial catalysts. Even platinum and palladium nanoparticles were active for the hydrogenation, only cellulose&#8208;supported platinum nanoparticles showed good stability. For palladium nanoparticles, stronger leaching from the surface of cellulose was observed. Cellulose&#8208;supported catalysts were recycled, and reusability is comparable to commercial catalysts. Therefore, cellulose could be used as an alternative catalyst support.</dc:description>

         <title>Twofold 6&#960;&#8208;Electrocyclization as a Route Toward Multi&#8208;Heteroatom&#8208;Doped Nanographenes Built&#160;on 1,4&#8208;Dihydropyrrolo[3,2&#8208;b]pyrrole Core</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here we present a highly versatile synthetic strategy based on twofold 6&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization accompanied with HBr elimination as a novel approach towards centrosymmetric multi&#8208;heteroatom&#8208;doped nanographenes build around an electron&#8208;rich 1,4&#8208;dihydropyrrolo[3,2&#8208;b]pyrrole core. A straightforward synthesis from readily available substrates offers a unique possibility of fusing the 1,4&#8208;dihydropyrrolo[3,2&#8208;b]pyrrole subunit not only with carbocyclic building blocks, such as electron&#8208;deficient phenanthrenes, chrysenes, or [4]helicenes, but also with heterocyclic systems, such as benzo[b]furan and 5&#8208;thiatruxene. The clear advantage of this strategy is that there is no requirement to assemble complex scaffolds possessing bromoaryl units since bromine atom is introduced by bromination of 1,4&#8208;dihydropyrrolo[3,2&#8208;b]pyrrole core which, because of its exceptionally electron&#8208;rich character, is universal and straightforward reaction. The obtained &#967;&#8208;shaped and S&#8208;shaped nanographenes containing 10 or more fused rings, exhibit visible&#8208;range emissions characterized by fluorescence quantum yields reaching 48%. Computational studies of the reaction mechanism revealed that the 6&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization is kinetically favourable over photo&#8208;induced direct arylation. Steady&#8208;state UV/Visible spectroscopy reveals that upon photoexcitation, the prepared S&#8208;shaped N&#8208;doped nanographenes undergo mostly radiative relaxation leading to large fluorescence quantum yields. We anticipate that this chemistry will empower the creation of new materials with various functionalities.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Organocatalysed Synthesis of (R)&#8208;Mandelic Acid Esters and &#945;&#8208;Alkoxy Derivatives from Commercial Sources</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A first catalytic one&#8208;pot chemical synthesis of optically active (R)&#8208;mandelic acids, esters and &#945;&#8208;alkoxy ester derivatives has been developed. The value&#8208;added final compounds have been obtained in high overall yield (26&#8211;94&#8201;%) and enantioselectivity (up to 97&#8201;% ee), through a straightforward route from commercially and widely available reagents, including aldehydes, water, alcohols and the organocatalyst.







Abstract
Optically active mandelic acid esters represent a highly valuable class of building blocks in organic synthesis and recurrent motifs embedded in bioactive compounds and drugs. Herein, we provide an enantioselective one&#8208;pot synthesis based on Knoevenagel condensation/asymmetric epoxidation/domino ring&#8208;opening hydrolysis (DROH) sequence to the crude mandelic acids, which underwent a final esterification step to (R)&#8208;methyl mandelates. These products have been obtained in good to high overall yield and enantioselectivity, using commercially and widely available reagents and catalyst including aldehydes, phenylsulfonyl acetonitrile, cumyl hydroperoxide, water and an epi&#8208;quinine&#8208;derived urea as the organocatalyst. Moreover, the versatility of the process has been demonstrated to prepare the corresponding &#945;&#8208;alkoxy esters in highly enantioselective manner, when using primary alcohols in a domino ring&#8208;opening esterification (DROE) step. This system is a first example of non&#8208;enzymatic catalytic one&#8208;pot protocol which allows a straightforward asymmetric synthesis of highly valuable mandelic acid derivatives from aldehyde feedstocks.

         <title>Highly Active and Stable Cu&#8722;Cd Bimetallic Oxides for Enhanced Electrochemical CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 4.73&#8201;% Cd&#8208;CuO catalyst exhibits remarkable activity and stability for CO2RR, while facile modulation of product selectivity from CO to C2+ can be readily achieved by precise control of electrolysis conditions. The enhanced performance of the electrocatalyst is ascribed to the introduction of CdO to improve the ability of CuO to activate CO2, the electronic interactions between Cu and Cd can boost the activation and conversion the key intermediates of CO2RR.







Abstract
Electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) can produce value&#8208;added chemicals such as carbon monoxide (CO) and multicarbon (C2+). However, the complex reaction pathways of CO2 electro&#8208;reduction reaction (CO2RR) greatly limit the product selectivity and conversion efficiency. Herein, the Cu&#8722;Cd bimetallic oxides catalyst was designed and applied for the CO2RR. The optimized 4.73&#8201;%Cd&#8208;CuO exhibits remarkable electrocatalytic CO2RR activity for selective CO production in H&#8208;cell using 0.5&#8197;M 1&#8208;butyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate ([Bmim]PF6)/MeCN as electrolyte. The Faradaic efficiency of CO (FE(CO)) can be maintained above 90&#8201;% over a wide potential range of &#8722;2.0 to &#8722;2.4&#8197;V vs. Ag/Ag+. Particularly, the catalyst achieves an impressive FE(CO) of 96.3&#8201;% with a current density of 60.7&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;2.2&#8197;V vs. Ag/Ag+. Furthermore, scaling up the 4.73&#8201;%Cd&#8208;CuO catalyst into a flow cell can reach 56.64&#8201;% FE of C2+ products (ethylene, ethanol and n&#8208;propanol) with a current density as high as 600&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 steadily. The excellent CO2RR performance of the as&#8208;synthesized 4.73&#8201;%Cd&#8208;CuO can be mainly attributed to the introduction of CdO to improve the ability of CuO to activate CO2, the electronic interactions between Cu and Cd can boost the activation and conversion the key intermediates of CO2RR and ensure the continuous stability of the 4.73&#8201;%Cd&#8208;CuO in electrolysis process.

         <title>Substitution of the Axial Type 1 Cu Ligand Affords Binding of a Water Molecule in Axial Position Affecting Kinetics, Spectral, and Structural Properties of the Small Laccase Ssl1</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combining several spectroscopic methods provided evidence that the exchange of the axial methionine of the T1 Cu site in the small laccase Ssl1 by several non&#8208;coordinating amino acids allowed a water molecule to enter the axial position, resulting in a stronger influence on the T1 Cu reduction potential and the intermolecular electron transfer than the chemical properties of the introduced amino acid side chains.







Abstract
Multicopper oxidases use Cu ions as cofactors to oxidize various substrates. High reduction potential at Type 1 Cu is considered as crucial for effective catalysis. Previous studies have shown that replacing the axial methionine ligand of the Type 1 Cu with leucine or phenylalanine leads to an increased reduction potential, but not always to higher enzyme activity. Here we present a study on six variants of the small laccase Ssl1 from Streptomyces sviceus, where the axial methionine ligand was substituted, and the effect of the axial ligand on reduction potential, activity, spectral properties and structure was investigated. Absorption, electronic circular dichroism and EPR spectra revealed the presence of a stronger coordinating axial ligand like oxygen, which influences the electronic and catalytic properties more than the nature of the amino acid side chain. The crystal structures of the Ssl1 variants were solved, which show that none of the amino acid side chains coordinate to the Cu. Instead, a water molecule is found in the axial coordination site, which support the spectroscopic data. Our findings highlight the importance of combining structural and spectroscopic methods to investigate the effect of amino acid exchange on multicopper oxidases.

&lt;p&gt;Combining several spectroscopic methods provided evidence that the exchange of the axial methionine of the T1 Cu site in the small laccase Ssl1 by several non-coordinating amino acids allowed a water molecule to enter the axial position, resulting in a stronger influence on the T1 Cu reduction potential and the intermolecular electron transfer than the chemical properties of the introduced amino acid side chains.

         <title>Unlocking the Potential of Push&#8208;Pull Pyridinic Photobases: Aggregation&#8208;Induced Excited&#8208;State Proton Transfer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The pH&#8208;dependent photophysics of three push&#8208;pull pyridines is addressed through steady&#8208;state and ultrafast spectroscopies. Aggregation is the key to multi&#8208;responsive fluorophores: appealing pKa values for cancer cell recognition; enhanced fluorescence efficiencies (&#966;F) for both neutral (Py&#8208;1) and protonated (Py&#8208;1(H+)) species, leading to acido(fluoro)chromism; longer singlet lifetimes (&#966;F) allowing the Excited&#8208;State Proton Transfer (ESPT) crucial for applications as photobases.







Abstract
The pH effect on the photophysics of three push&#8208;pull compounds bearing dimethoxytriphenylamine (TPA&#8208;OMe) as electron donor and pyridine as electron acceptor, with different ortho&#8208;functionalization (&#8722;H, &#8722;Br, and &#8722;TPA&#8208;OMe), is assessed through steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved spectroscopic techniques in DMSO/water mixed solutions and in water dispersions over a wide pH range. The enhanced intramolecular charge transfer upon protonation of the pyridinic ring leads to the acidochromic (from colorless to yellow) and acido(fluoro)chromic (from cyan to pink) behaviours of the investigated compounds. In dilute DMSO/buffer mixtures these molecules exhibited low pKa values (&#8804;3.5) and extremely short singlet lifetimes. Nevertheless, it is by exploiting the aggregation phenomenon in aqueous environment that the practical use of these compounds largely expands: i) the basicity increases (pKa&#8776;4.5) approaching the optimum values for pH&#8208;sensing in cancer cell recognition; ii) the fluorescence efficiencies are boosted due to Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission (AIE), making these compounds appealing as fluorescent probes; iii) longer singlet lifetimes enable Excited&#8208;State Proton Transfer, paving the way for the application of these molecules as photobases (pKa*=9.1). The synergy of charge and proton transfers combined to the AIE behaviour in these pyridines allows tunable multi&#8208;responsive optical properties providing valuable information for the design of new light&#8208;emitting photobases.

         <title>Enhanced Efficiency and Intrinsic Stability of Wide&#8208;Bandgap Perovskite Solar Cells Through Dimethylamine&#8208;Based Cation Engineering</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The incorporation of the DMA cation into triple cation perovskites significantly altered the crystal structure and grain growth of the perovskite films. This modification inhibited halide segregation and enhanced carrier mobility. As a result, a remarkable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 21.9&#8201;% was achieved for wide&#8208;bandgap PSCs with a bandgap of 1.68&#8197;eV. Furthermore, the stability of PSCs based on DMA&#8208;doped perovskite was substantially improved. After exposure to ambient air for 1500&#8197;hours, the unencapsulated device retained an impressive 80.6&#8201;% of its initial efficiency. This demonstrates the great potential of DMA doping for developing stable and efficient wide&#8208;bandgap PSCs.







Abstract
High efficiency and stable wide&#8208;bandgap (WBG) perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are crucial for the development of perovskite&#8208;based tandem solar cells. However, the efficiency and stability of WBG PSCs are compromised by significant phase segregation and surface defects. In this study, we introduce a cation engineering strategy for WBG perovskite, employing a two&#8208;step sequential method that incorporates dimethylamine hydroiodide (DMAI) into the lead halide complex during the initial step. The addition of DMAI modifies the crystal structure and grain growth of the perovskite film, leading to improved crystal quality, reduced photo&#8208;induced halide segregation, decreased defect density, and enhanced charge carrier mobility. Consequently, we achieved a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 21.9&#8201;% for 1.68&#8197;eV WBG PSCs. Furthermore, the stability of PSCs based on DMA&#8208;doped perovskite was significantly improved. After 1500&#8197;hours of exposure to ambient air, the unencapsulated device retained an impressive 80.6&#8201;% of its initial efficiency. This result highlights the substantial potential for stable and efficient WBG PSCs.

         <title>Focus on Physico&#8208;Chemical Properties of Sulfoximines: Acidity, Basicity and Lipophilicity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Although sulfoximines are emerging entities in chemistry, no physico&#8208;chemical are present in the literature. We disclose here a comprehensive study on the measurement of their acidity, basicity and the determination of their Hansch parameters.







Abstract
Despite the numerous published syntheses and applications of sulfoximines, very few studies describe their physico&#8208;chemical properties and in particular their acidic, basic and lipophilic or hydrophilic characters. We report for the first time the acidity values (pKa) of fluorinated sulfoximines in water and in acetonitrile, as well as the basicity (pKaH) measurements of fluorinated and non&#8208;fluorinated sulfoximines in acetonitrile. The same sulfoximine library was also studied in terms of lipophilicity with measurement of the Hansch parameters of the sulfoximine moieties. Finally, these new data allowed us to optimize the N&#8208;alkylation reaction of fluorinated sulfoximines.

         <title>When the Study of the Post&#8208;Synthetic Modification Method on a 1D Spin Crossover Coordination Polymer Highlights its Catalytic Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The spin crossover iron complex, with the formula [Fe(NH2trz)3](NO3)2, catalyzes imine formation from 4&#8208;amino&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazole and aldehyde. During catalysis, the iron complex undergoes two different PSM reactions: the first with an aldehyde and the second with an aminotriazole. These PSM reactions are thought to be involved in the catalytic mechanism of this iron&#8208;based coordination polymer.







Abstract
We are interested in studying the catalytic activity of the spin crossover (SCO) complex ([Fe(NH2trz)3](NO3)2). In this work, we demonstrate that, by adapting the experimental conditions, we can switch from a quantitative post&#8208;synthetic modification (PSM) reaction to the use of this complex as a catalyst for the formation of imine from 4&#8208;amino&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazole. During the catalytic reaction, the iron complex undergoes two different PSM reactions: the first is the action of the aldehyde on the NH2 groups present on the complex, whereas the second PSM reaction occurs between the imine complex and aminotriazole, leading back to the starting complex. These two PSM reactions are at least partially involved in the catalytic mechanism. Furthermore, the combination of these two PSM reactions enables us to modulate the particle size and shape of the final amine complex without altering its excellent SCO properties. This result is of interest in the field of heterogeneous catalysis, where particle size has a strong influence on the catalytic activity, and for the proper integration in devices for different applications.

         <title>Nucleophilic Amination of Aryl Halides with an Azanide Surrogate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the development of an azanide (&#8722;NH2) surrogate which enables the facile conversion of (hetero)aryl halides into primary N&#8208;aryl amines under transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions. The designed amidine reagent is easy to prepare, bench stable, and undergoes facile N&#8208;arylation under basic conditions at 40 &#176;C. Intermediate N&#8208;aryl amidines are readily cleaved to form N&#8208;aryl amines in situ through hydrolysis or base&#8208;promoted elimination. The developed surrogate is a safer and more selective alternative to existing anionic N&#8208;nucleophiles, such as alkali metal amides or azide salts.</dc:description>

         <title>Stimuli Induced Reversible Switching Between a Self&#8208;assembled 2&#8208;Catenane and the Constituent Coordination Rings</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A pair of comparable sized C&#8208;shaped bis&#8208;monodentate ligands (L1 and L22+) and a linear bis&#8208;monodentate ligand (L3) complimenting to the terminal&#8208;lengths of the C&#8208;shaped ligands have been identified. One&#8208;pot combination of cis&#8208;Pd(tmeda)2+, L1 and L3 (2:1:1 ratio) in water resulted an octa&#8208;cationic 2&#8208;catenane, [Pd2(tmeda)2(L1)(L3)]28+ in which two identical tetra&#8208;cationic macromonocyclic coordination rings are interlocked; however, a guest bound coordination ring was formed in presence of a selected di&#8208;anionic guest. Complexation of cis&#8208;Pd(tmeda)2+ with a mixture of L22+ and L3 (2:1:1 ratio) in water resulted the hexa&#8208;cationic macromonocyclic coordination ring, [Pd2(tmeda)2(L2)(L3)]6+ whereas&#160; a guest bound coordination ring was formed in the presence of the di&#8208;anionic guest.&#160; Addition of the guest to the preformed octa&#8208;cationic catenane caused ring separation to favour the guest&#8208;bound ring. This guest bound ring could be reverted to the 2&#8208;catenane by sequestering the bound guest using the relatively electron deficient hexa&#8208;cationic coordination ring. Thus, a design principle for reversible switching between a 2&#8208;catenane and the constituent macromonocyclic&#8208;rings using anion&#8208;binding/&#8208;sequestering as the core concept has been established.</dc:description>

         <title>NIR Diradical&#8208;Featured   Croconaine Nanoagent for Cancer Photoacoustic Imaging and Photothermal Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Radical&#8208;featured organic materials usually demonstrate significantly narrower bandgap than that of regular organic materials, which is beneficial for near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorption and non&#8208;radiative decay process, making them good candidates for photothermal agents (PTAs) of photothermal therapy (PTT). &#160;However, most organic radicals are too short&#8208;lived to be separated and stable. Herein, a stable pyrylium&#8208;croconaine (CR) dye CR845 with high diradical character was synthesized and assembled into CR845 nanoparticles (NPs) to explore the photoacoustic imaging (PAI) and photothermal therapeutic performance under NIR irradiation in vitro&#160;and in vivo. CR845 exhibited a stable NIR absorption at 845 nm (&#949;&#160;= 3.37 &#215; 105&#160;L mol&#8722;1&#160;cm&#8722;1) and a relatively high photothermal conversion efficiency (PCE) of 58.8%. When assembled into nanoparticles, CR845 NPs showed good photostability, good biocompatibility, favorable NIR photoacoustic potential, effective cancer cell killing and complete tumor elimination upon 850 nm laser irradiation. The work demonstrates a diradical&#8208;featured CR PTA with favorable PAI/PTT effects, which can help to provide new ideas for the development of NIR PTAs, and further promote the application of organic radical materials in the field of biomedicine.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Herein, we present a method for the diastereoselective synthesis of N&#8208;heterocycle&#8208;substituted cyclobutanes from commercially available bromocyclobutanes. This method enables the efficient formation of various heterocyclic aminocyclobutane esters and amides using simple reagents. Notably, N&#8208;nucleophiles such as imidazoles, azoles, and nucleobase derivatives were successfully incorporated, enhancing the chemical diversity of small ring building blocks for medicinal chemistry applications.</dc:description>

         <title>From a P&#8208;Bridging Phosphaketene to &#956;&#8208;Phosphinidenide and &#956;&#8208;Diphosphaurea Units at a Dinickel Core</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Salt metathesis of dinickel(II) complex LNi2Br (1; L is a dinucleating pyrazolate ligand with two &#946;&#8208;diketiminato chelate arms) with Na(OCP)&#8729;(dioxane)2.5 yielded LNi2(PCO) (2) with a P&#8208;bridging phosphaethynolate. Further reaction of 2 with benzyl isocyanide or with an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) triggered decarbonylation and gave LNi2(PCN&#8208;CH2Ph) (3) and LNi2P(NHC) (4) with P&#8208;bridging cyanophosphide and NHC&#8208;phosphinidenide, respectively. Electronic structure analysis indicated a &#956;2&#8208;&#951;2:&#951;1 binding mode of the PCO&#8211; anion between the two NiII ions in 2, which is even more pronounced for the [PCN(&#8208;CH2Ph)]&#8722; anion in 3. DFT assessment of the formation mechanism of 4 showed that attack at the phosphaketene&#8208;C atom is kinetically preferred but reversible and unproductive, while kinetically more demanding back&#8208;side SN2 attack at the phosphaketene&#8208;P atom triggers CO release with 4 as thermodynamic product. Nucleophilic addition at the phosphaketene&#8208;C could be demonstrated by the strongly exergonic reaction of 2 with KPPh2, giving unstable K[LNi2(P(O)CPPh2)] (5) with a P&#8208;bridging and K+&#8208;stabilized diphosphaurea derivative. All new complexes 2&#8211;5 have been comprehensively characterized, including by X&#8208;ray diffraction.</dc:description>

         <title>An Organic Vapor&#8208;Responsive Actuator Based on a Novel Urea Macrocycle</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The mechanical actuation of smart materials has garnered considerable attention in biological and medical research due to their ability to mimic biological processes at both molecular level, such as conformational changes in individual compounds, and at the macroscopic level, where polymeric substrates respond to external stimuli. In this study, we present a polymeric composite incorporating a novel urea macrocycle as a filler, forming a soft actuator that responds to various organic solvent vapors. The underlying actuation mechanism is attributed to crystalline phase transition of urea macrocycle, driven by the host&#8210;guest interactions with diverse guest molecules. This work provides valuable insights for advancing the design of supramolecular hosts in smart material applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Influence of ionic liquid film thickness and flow rate on macrocyclization efficiency and selectivity in supported ionic liquid&#8208;liquid phase catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supported ionic&#8208;liquid phase (SILP) technology in a biphasic setting with n&#8208;heptane as the transport phase was applied to the Ru&#8208;alkylidene&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalyzed macrocyclization of&#160; &#945;,&#969;&#8208;dienes to elucidate the effect of ionic liquid (IL)&#8208;film thickness, flow rate as well as substrate and product concentration on macrocyclization efficiency, and Z&#8208;selectivity. To understand the molecular&#8208;level behavior of the substrates and products at the n&#8208;heptane/IL interphase, atomistic molecular dynamics simulations were conducted and correlated with experimental observations. The thickness of the IL layer strongly influences the Z/E ratio of the products in that a thin IL layer favors higher Z/E ratios by confining the catalyst between the pore wall and the liquid&#8208;liquid interphase whereas a thick IL layer favors formation of the E&#8208;product and Ru&#8208;hydride catalyzed isomerization reactions. Also, macrocyclization efficiency, expressed by the ratio of oligomers/macromonocycle (O/MMC), is influenced both by the flow rate and the thickness of the IL layer.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Engineering of Covalent Organic Frameworks for Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution from Water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have demonstrated significant potential as photocatalysts for efficiently generating hydrogen through photocatalytic water splitting. However, the design of COFs with distinct organic unit blocks at a molecular level profoundly influences their photocatalytic performance. In this study, we synthesized a series of &#946;&#8208;ketoamine COFs through molecular engineering of nitrogen sites, including phenyl&#8208;structured TpBD, phenylpyridine&#8208;structured TpPpy, phenylpyrimidine&#8208;structured TpPpm, and bipyridine&#8208;structured TpBpy. Advanced characterization techniques reveal that TpPpm and TpBpy with more nitrogen sites exhibit superior efficiencies in electron transfer and charge separation compared to TpBD and TpPpy, thereby endowing them with enhanced photocatalytic performance for hydrogen evolution from water. As a result, the photocatalytic hydrogen production rates of TpPpm (33.80 mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1) and TpBpy (29.18 mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1) surpass those of TpBD (20.82 mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1) and TpPpy (27.49 mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1). Additionally, due to the different plane symmetries between Ppm and Bpy resulting from the various positions of nitrogen sites, TpPpm displays superior photochemical properties and better photocatalytic performance compared to TpBpy. Moreover, theoretical calculation results further confirm the exceptional intramolecular charge transfer ability of TpPpm among all COFs. This work underscores the significance of precisely controlling N sites in COFs for designing high&#8208;performance photocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present the preparation and investigation of a fluorine&#8208;free surface&#8208;active bis&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) platinum(II) complex &#8212; trans&#8208;[Pt(mPEG3C8Im)2Cl2] &#8212; for interface&#8208;enhanced supported ionic liquid phase (SILP) catalysis within a group of (mPEGn)&#8208;substituted ionic liquids (ILs) ([(mPEGn)2Im][A] ILs). The complex was characterized by means of single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (scXRD) analysis and multinuclear (1H, 13C, 195Pt) NMR spectroscopy, indicating the presence of two almost equimolar syn&#8211;anti rotamers of the square&#8208;planar complex in solution. Angle&#8208;resolved X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (ARXPS) revealed pronounced interface&#8208;accumulation of trans&#8208;[Pt(mPEG3C8Im)2Cl2] in IL solutions of [(mPEG2)2Im][A] (A&#8722; = I&#8722; and PF6&#8722;).</dc:description>

Herein, we developed glycosyl 2&#8242;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;methylpropionates as glycosyl donors, which can be activated by TMSOTf through remote activation. Both O&#8208;glycosylation and C&#8208;glycosylation were efficiently executed within 1&#8197;h at room temperature. The glycosylation protocol was characterized by its straightforward operation and broad applicability to various substrates.







Abstract
Herein, we developed a Lewis acid&#8208;mediated O&#8208;glycosylation and C&#8208;glycosylation protocol using stable glycosyl 2&#8217;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;methylpropionates as donors. These glycosylation reactions reached completion within 1&#8197;h at room temperature. The practicality of this protocol is characterized by their straightforward operation and efficient applicability to various substrates, including both disarmed and armed glycosyl donors, through the remote activation of easily accessible TMSOTf.

         <title>Rational Assembly of Three&#8208;component Coordination Polymers as Heterogeneous Catalysts for CO2 Cycloaddition and Cyanosilylation Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Four new coordination polymers were constructed. The catalytic performance study showed that the CP 1 exhibited good catalytic efficiency and excellent substrate tolerance in the cycloaddition reaction of CO2 and cyanosilylation of aldehydes under mild conditions. Therefore, the CP 1 was considered efficient and stable heterogeneous catalysts for above the two reactions.







Abstract
Four new coordination polymers based on 5&#8208;(((1H&#8208;imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)methyl)amino) isophthalic acid (H3L) and auxiliary ligands (1,10&#8208;phenanthroline, 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine, and 4,4&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine), namely, {[Zn(HL)(phen)(H2O)]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H2O}n (CP 1), {[Ni(HL)(phen)(H2O)]}n (CP 2), {[Ni(HL)(2,2&#8242;&#8208;bpy)(H2O)]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H2O}n (CP 3) and {[Cd(HL)(4,4&#8242;&#8208;bpy)0.5(H2O)]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H2O}n (CP 4) were rationally assembled. Furthermore, these four CPs were screened as heterogeneous catalysts for CO2 cycloaddition and cyanosilylation reactions under mild conditions. The catalytic experiments showed that CP 1 had the better catalytic performance, excellent substrate tolerance and recyclability for the above two reactions. It is speculated that the excellent activity of CP 1 may be due to the open Lewis base site and the Lewis acidic characteristics of the zinc (II) center. After five cycles, the catalytic activities of CP 1 did not significantly decrease, and the structures remained unchanged. Therefore, the CP 1 was considered efficient and stable heterogeneous catalysts for above the two reactions.

         <title>Enhancing the Chemical Stability of P12L24 Cage: Transformation of the Chemically Labile Imine Cage into a Robust Carbamate Cage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we report enhancement in chemical stability of the imine&#8208;based porphyrinic cage P12L24 by converting it into a robust carbamate porphyrinic cage, c&#8208;P12L24, through a two&#8208;step post&#8208;synthetic modification process. Furthermore, encapsulation of molecular ruler has been demonstrated for the potential application.







Abstract
Herein, we report enhancement in chemical stability of the imine&#8208;based porphyrinic cage P12L24 by converting it into a robust carbamate porphyrinic cage, c&#8208;P12L24, through a two&#8208;step post&#8208;synthetic modification process. First, the imine bonds in P12L24 were reduced to form an amine&#8208;based cage, r&#8208;P12L24, followed by carbamation using N,N&#8242;&#8208;carbonyldiimidazole (CDI) to yield c&#8208;P12L24. The resulting carbamate cage exhibits high stability under acidic and basic conditions (pH&#8197;1&#8211;13) and in the presence of moisture. 1H NMR, DOSY NMR, and DFT calculations revealed that reducing the imine bonds to amine increases the framework's flexibility, causing partial structural collapse, whereas the carbamate formation restores structural rigidity. The insertion of a 4.0&#8197;nm molecular ruler into the cavity of zinc&#8208;metallated c&#8208;P12L24 via metal&#8208;ligand coordination further confirmed restoration of the cavity size and geometry of the original cage. This enhancement of chemical stability through carbamate formation can pave the way to a wide range of potential applications for the gigantic porphyrinic cage.

         <title>Unlocking the Chemical and Structural Complexity of Aluminum Hydroxy Acetates: from Commodity Chemicals to Porous Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;throughput investigation involving more than 330 reactions in the system Al3+/CH3COOH/NaOH/H2O permitted the elucidation of the synthesis&#8208;structure relationship and allowed us to shed light on the structural chemistry and porosity of aluminum acetates for the first time. The robust synthesis procedures permitted scale&#8208;up under mild reaction conditions in high yields.







Abstract
Aluminum acetates have been in use for more than a century, but despite their widespread commercial applications, essential scientific knowledge of their synthesis&#8208;structure&#8208;property relationships is lacking. High&#8208;throughput screening, followed by fine tuning and extensive optimization of reaction conditions using Al3+, OH&#8722; and CH3COO&#8722; ions, has unraveled their complex synthetic chemistry, yielding for the first time the four phase pure products Al(OH)(O2CCH3)2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;x H2O (x=0, 2) (1A and CAU&#8208;65, 1B), Al3O(HO2CCH3)(O2CCH3)7 (2), and the porous aluminum salt [Al24(OH)56(CH3COO)12](OH)4 (CAU&#8208;55&#8208;OH, 3). Structure determination by electron and X&#8208;ray diffraction was carried out and the data suggested porosity for 1B and 3, which was confirmed by physisorption experiments. Even the scale&#8208;up to the 10&#8197;L scale was accomplished for 1A, 1B and 3 with yields of up to 1.1&#8197;kg (99&#8201;%). This study of a seemingly simple chemical system provides important information on both fundamental inorganic chemistry and porous materials.

         <title>Frustrated Radical Pairs: From Fleeting Intermediates to Isolable Species</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein we report the design of stable para&#8208;substituted triarylamine&#8722;DDQ radical ion pairs (RIPs). We investigated several combinations using a wide variety of spectroscopic methods such as IR, EPR and NMR, both in solution and in the solid state. We quantified the degree of single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) and found that both the substituents (MeO &gt; tBu &gt; Br) and the polarity of solvents (MeCN &gt; DCM &gt; toluene) can lead to a greater degree of SET.







Abstract
We present the design and comprehensive investigation of stable para&#8208;substituted triarylamine&#8211;2,3&#8208;dichloro&#8208;5,6&#8208;dicyano&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone (DDQ) radical ion pairs (RIPs) generated via single&#8208;electron transfer (SET). We quantified the degree of SET in both solution and solid phases, utilising a suite of spectroscopic techniques including IR, EPR, NMR, and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SC&#8211;XRD). Our findings reveal that the extent of SET is significantly influenced by the nature of the substituents (MeO &gt; tBu &gt; Br) and the polarity of the solvent (MeCN &gt; DCM &gt; toluene). The radical ion pair [(pMeOPh)3N]&#8901;+[DDQ]&#8901;&#8722; was unambiguously identified using EPR and UV&#8211;vis spectroscopy, and its structure was confirmed by SC&#8211;XRD. Detailed analysis indicates an open&#8208;shell singlet ground state with a thermally accessible triplet state, as corroborated by EPR, magnetic susceptibility measurements, and DFT calculations. This study offers crucial insights into the mechanistic pathways of RIP formation and tuning both in solution and solid states, laying the groundwork for future exploration of their reactivity and potential applications.

Detailed analysis indicates an open-shell singlet ground state with a thermally accessible triplet state, as corroborated by EPR, magnetic susceptibility measurements, and DFT calculations. This study offers crucial insights into the mechanistic pathways of RIP formation and tuning both in solution and solid states, laying the groundwork for future exploration of their reactivity and potential applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Construction and Comparative Research of Two MOFs Proton Conducting Materials Containing Nitro Groups</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two nitro&#8208;containing Cd&#8208;based MOFs, MOF&#8208;1 and MOF&#8208;2, are being synthesized and investigated for their proton conductivity. Both materials show peak conductivity at 98% RH and 90 &#176;C, with MOF&#8208;1 demonstrating significantly higher proton conductivity (9.13 &#215; 10&#8722;3 S&#8901;cm&#8722;1) compared to MOF&#8208;2 (3.00&#215;10&#8722;3 S&#8901;cm&#8722;1). The study emphasizes the role of nitrate in enhancing proton conduction.







Abstract
In field of electrochemistry, there has been a growing interest in the potential applications of proton&#8208;conducting metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs). Therefore, how to design and synthesize MOFs with high proton conductivity is considered crucial. In this study, two examples of nitro&#8208;containing Cd&#8208;based MOFs, MOF&#8208;1 {[Cd3(TIPE)1.5(NO3)5Cl(H2O)2]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;17H2O}n and MOF&#8208;2 {[Cd(TIPE)0.5(nip)]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;10H2O}n (TIPE=1,1,2,2&#8208;tetrakis(4&#8208;(1H&#8208;imidazole&#8208;1&#8208;yl)phenyl)ethene, H2nip=5&#8208;Nitroisophthalic Acid), had been successfully designed and synthesized, and their proton&#8208;conducting properties were thoroughly investigated. Notably, both materials displayed peak proton conductivity at 98&#8201;% RH and 90&#8201;&#176;C, exhibiting values of 9.13&#215;10&#8722;3 and 3.00&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 for MOF&#8208;1 and MOF&#8208;2, respectively. The plausible proton conduction pathways and mechanisms were elucidated through structural analyses, water vapor adsorption studies, and the determination of activation energy (Ea) values. It was found that the difference in proton conductivity between MOF&#8208;1 and MOF&#8208;2 was mainly associated with the different water absorption rates of the samples. The uniqueness of this study was that for the first time conducted an in&#8208;depth study of the role of nitrate in proton conduction, providing new ideas for designing materials with excellent proton conductivity.

         <title>Tuning Tetramethoxy&#8208;acridiniums for Fluorophores and Organic Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Non&#8208;fluorescent tetramethoxy&#8208;acridinium (TMAcr+) become fluorescent when substituted with electron withdrawing groups, due to inhibition of intramolecular PET quenching. Fluorescence quantum yield up to &#966;f=20&#8201;% and a long fluorescence lifetime of &#964;f=9&#8197;ns in CH2Cl2 are obtained. The TMAcr+ can be used as photooxidants due to their excited state reduction potentials (E*red=1.6&#8197;V vs. SCE).







Abstract
Tetramethoxy substituted alkyl&#8208;acridiniums (TMAcr+) are readily available by facile nucleophilic aromatic substitution on tris(2,6&#8208;dimethoxyphenyl)carbenium, but are non&#8208;fluorescent, presumably due to intramolecular photoinduced electron transfer quenching. In this work we introduce electron withdrawing groups by electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions, leading to fluorescence turn&#8208;on. The acridiniums are moderately fluorescent (&#966;f=20&#8201;%) with long fluorescene lifetimes (&#964;f=9&#8197;ns). The positive excited state reduction potentials (E*red=+1.6&#8197;V) make the TMAcr+ excellent electron acceptors in the excited state, and efficient reductive photoredox catalysts able to oxidize a broad range of substrates.

         <title>Recent Advances in NIR&#8208;Switchable Multi&#8208;Redox Systems Based on Organic Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#960;&#8208;Conjugated organic systems with multi&#8208;step redox behavior often exhibit electrochromic properties. Among them, organic molecules that can exhibit ON/OFF switching of NIR absorption are rare but have been developed rapidly. Isolation, structural determination, and electrochemical and spectroscopic measurements of multiple redox states are essential for a better understanding of their natures.







Abstract
Electrochromic systems capable of switching absorption in the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region (750&#8211;2500&#8197;nm) are attractive from the viewpoint of applications for material and life science, and thus several examples have been reported to date. In general, the development of organic&#8208;based systems is needed to reduce the environmental impact and improve biocompatibility. Although extending the switchable spectral range is crucial for the application of organic electrochromic molecules, the switching of NIR absorption based on redox interconversion is still a challenging issue regarding reversibility and durability during interconversion. To overcome this potential instability, the introduction of heteroatoms into the molecular backbone and/or &#960;&#8208;extension could be useful strategies in terms of effective delocalization of charge and spin in the corresponding redox states. In this review, we focus on redox&#8208;active well&#8208;defined small molecules that enable ON/OFF switching of NIR absorption based on precise control of the redox states, and present recent studies on their intrinsic electrochemical and spectroscopic properties and/or structural characterization of their charged states.

         <title>Syn vs. Anti? What Controls Addition Stereochemistry in Chlorolactonization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Syn vs. anti chlorolactonization of an alkenoic acid was investigated using a deuterated analog. Product ratios (syn vs. anti) were dependent on a number of factors, although concentrations were most determinant. Kinetic analysis (Variable Time Normalized Analysis, VTNA) complemented with computational studies led to two proposed transition states that lead to the syn and anti products.







Abstract
The stereochemistry of the uncatalyzed chlorolactonization of 4&#8208;phenylpent&#8208;4&#8208;enoic acid at room temperature was examined to probe the reaction's intrinsic diastereoselectivities as a function of chlorenium ion donor, solvent polarity, and reactant concentration ranges. Kinetic studies using Variable Time Normalization Analysis (VTNA) revealed differing reaction orders for the syn and anti alkene addition processes. Aided and illustrated by quantum chemical modeling, this detailed mechanistic analysis of the substrate's intrinsic chlorolactonization reactions points to concerted AdE3&#8208;type paths for both syn and anti additions. By illuminating the factors selecting for syn&#8208; vs anti&#8208;addition paths, the results provide key reference points for future studies of stereocontrol in halofunctionalization reactions.

         <title>Boron&#8208;Containing Organic Two Dimensional Materials: Synthesis and Application</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic two&#8208;dimensional materials have garnered widespread attention due to their well&#8208;defined structures, structural diversity, and rich electronic effects, demonstrating significant application potential across various fields. Atomic&#8208;level manipulation of the structures of organic two&#8208;dimensional materials has been a primary strategy for enriching and optimizing their properties. The introduction of heteroatoms often significantly affects their electronic structure, thereby endowing these materials with novel and unique properties. Boron atoms, due to their electron&#8208;deficient nature, have been extensively studied in luminescent materials, semiconductor materials, and chemical sensing materials. Consequently, boron&#8208;containing organic two&#8208;dimensional materials are also believed to be promising as a new class of materials with excellent optoelectronic and chemical activities. This article collates and summarizes the preparation and property studies of three types of boron&#8208;containing organic two&#8208;dimensional materials in recent years.</dc:description>

         <title>Study on intelligent bionic superhydrophobic material and its oil&#8208;water separation mechanism</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, an environmentally friendly, simple process and high&#8208;performance Fe3O4@SiO2@PMMA&#8208;based smart bionic superhydrophobic oil&#8208;absorbing material was developed for effectively collecting and removing oil pollutants from water.&#160;By studying the effects of Fe3O4&#160;particle size, PDMS concentration, and heating time on the superhydrophobicity of the materials, the directional regulation of superhydrophobicity and oil&#8208;water separation performance of Fe3O4@SiO2@PMMA@PDMS materials was realized.&#160;The results showed that the material exhibited optimal performance when the Fe3O4&#160;particle size combination was 20/500 nm/1 &#956;m, the mass ratio of PDMS to Fe3O4@SiO2@PMMA was 7:1, and it was heated at 350&#8451; for 1 minute.&#160;The coating achieved a contact angle of 158.7&#176; and a rolling angle as low as 4.9&#176;. This coating not only remained superhydrophobic after a 21 m abrasion test and 288 h immersion in acid, alkali, salt, and high&#8208;temperature solutions, but also efficiently separated oil&#8208;water mixtures, with separation efficiencies of over 99.78% were achieved for trichloromethane, dichloromethane and bromoethane.&#160;Furthermore, superhydrophobic magnetic polyurethane sponge (SFPU) prepared using Fe3O4@SiO2@PMMA not only exhibited excellent oil&#8208;absorbing capacity (11&#8208;28 g/g), but also realized precise oil absorption at multiple sites by magnetic conduction. In the actual oily wastewater test, the oil&#8208;water separation efficiency of the sponge reached 90.58% .</dc:description>

         <title>Surface Sulfurization of Cubic Cu2O to Form Cu2S Nanostructure&#8208;Decorated Catalysts for Light&#8208;Enhanced Electrocatalytic H2 Evolution and Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Slight surface sulfurization was employed to prepare cubic Cu2O@Cu2S core&#8208;shell structures, which can deliver a maximum high surface photovoltage (SPV) of 30 mV. The as&#8208;prepared Cu2O@Cu2S has demonstrated efficient charge separation and migration, which then served as high&#8208;performance bifunctional catalysts for light&#8208;enhanced electrocatalytic H2 evolution and photocatalytic CH4 production, suggesting its promising applications in light&#8208;driven catalysis.







Abstract
Developing highly efficient bifunctional catalysts for electrocatalysis and photocatalysis suffers from sluggish charge transfer and poor photo&#8208;to&#8208;electric conversion rate. Herein, micro&#8208;sized Cu2O cubes were initially prepared for subsequent transformation into Cu2O@Cu2S core&#8208;shell structures by a slight surface sulfurization. The formation of nanostructured Cu2S thin layer at Cu2O surface can endow an immediate charge separation and migration under light irradiation, leading to high surface photovoltages (SPV, 18&#8211;30&#8197;mV). As a result, the as&#8208;prepared Cu2O@Cu2S catalysts exhibited reduced overpotentials (&#951;, only 86&#8197;mV is required for the optimized sample to achieve a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) for H2 evolution with good cycling stability in electrocatalytic water splitting. Meanwhile, a high methane (CH4) production rate of 30.3&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8201;g&#8722;1 can be delivered from the optimized Cu2O@Cu2S sample when used for photocatalytic CO2 reduction. This work has provided a strategy to prepare bifunctional catalysts with improved photoelectric properties for photo/electrocatalytic applications.

         <title>Free Alcohol&#8208;Mediated Radical Alkynylation and Allylation of Unactivated C(sp3)&#8722;H Bonds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel free aliphatic alcohol&#8208;mediated radical alkynylation and allylation of unactivated C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds is disclosed. The transition&#8208;metal free protocol features exclusive site&#8208;selectivity, high product diversity, and simple operation, supplying a robust manifold for C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization using easily available aliphatic alcohols as feedstock.







Abstract
The daunting challenges in converting alcoholic O&#8722;H bonds with high bond&#8208;dissociation energy (BDE) to alkoxy radicals and harnessing those unruly reaction species largely limit exploiting free alcohols in C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization. Herein we describe a novel radical alkynylation and allylation of unactivated C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds with unmodified aliphatic alcohols. The use of phenyliodine bis(trifluoroacetate) (PIFA) enables the formation of alkoxy radicals under mild photochemical conditions. &#945;&#8208;Methyl styrene serves as a sacrificial&#8208;reagent that significantly improves the reaction outcomes. This transition&#8208;metal free protocol further features broad substrate scope, exclusive site&#8208;selectivity, high product diversity, and simple operation, supplying a robust manifold for C(sp3)&#8722;H functionalization using easily available aliphatic alcohols as feedstock.

         <title>Tetraphenylethylene&#8208;Derived Tetracarboxylate Featuring AIE Properties for Dual Ion Sensing and Mechanochromic Self&#8208;Erasable Writing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An aggregation&#8208;induced emission molecule (TPEC) derived from tetraphenylethylene&#8208;based tetracarboxylate was designed and synthesized. It self&#8208;assembles into single&#8208;layer nanosheets in water, demonstrating multifunctional capabilities: fluorescence colorimetric sensing for Al3+ ions, fluorescence quenching sensing for Fe3+ ions, and mechanochromism for self&#8208;erasable writing.







Abstract
The integration of multiple functions within a single fluorescent molecule provides a promising platform for developing versatile, efficient, and cost&#8208;effective materials with enhanced performance across diverse applications. In this study, we introduce TPEC, an aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) molecule derived from tetraphenylethylene&#8208;based tetracarboxylate, which demonstrates multifunctional capabilities, including metal ion sensing and self&#8208;erasable writing. TPEC exhibits amphiphilicity in water, self&#8208;assembling into single&#8208;layer nanosheets with robust blue fluorescence. Notably, the aqueous solution of TPEC displays a fluorescence colorimetric response to Al3+ ions and fluorescence quenching in the presence of Fe3+ ions. Additionally, TPEC powders undergo fluorescence colorimetric changes under mechanical stimulation, enabling self&#8208;erasable writing on prepared paper. This study presents a straightforward strategy for the development of multifunctional luminescent materials based on the self&#8208;assembly of a single&#8208;component fluorophore.

         <title>Isoreticular Contraction in Dicopper Paddle&#8208;Wheel&#8208;Based Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks to Enhance C2H2/CO2 Separation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two isoreticualr MOFs of Cu&#8208;TPTC and Cu&#8208;ABTC were meticulously prepared. By strategically incorporating an azo group in place of a phenyl ring in the tetracarboxylate linker, Cu&#8208;ABTC demonstrated a modest decrease in pore size while retaining high porosity relative to Cu&#8208;TPTC. This modification led to a marked improvement in C2H2 adsorption capacity and C2H2/CO2 separation selectivity of Cu&#8208;ABTC, along with an extended breakthrough time.







Abstract
Achieving a balance between high selectivity and uptake is a formidable challenge for the purification of acetylene from mixtures with carbon dioxide, particularly when seeking to maximize both C2H2 adsorption capacity and C2H2/CO2 separation selectivity in crystalline porous materials. In this study, leveraging the principles of reticular chemistry, we selected two tetracarboxylate&#8208;based linkers and combined them with Cu2+ ions to synthesize two isoreticular dicopper paddle&#8208;wheel&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs): Cu&#8208;TPTC (terphenyl&#8208;3,3&#8217;,5,5&#8217;&#8208;tetracarboxylic acid, H4TPTC) and Cu&#8208;ABTC (3,3,5,5&#8208;azobenzenetetracarboxylic acid, H4ABTC). The structural and sorption analyses revealed that Cu&#8208;ABTC, despite having slightly smaller pores due to the strategic replacement of a phenyl ring with an azo group between two tetratopic ligands, maintains high porosity compared to Cu&#8208;TPTC. Furthermore, Cu&#8208;ABTC outperforms Cu&#8208;TPTC in terms of C2H2 adsorption capacity (196&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 298&#8197;K and 1&#8197;bar) and C2H2/CO2 separation selectivity (16.5~5.6). These findings were corroborated by dynamic breakthrough experiments and computational modeling. This research highlights the potential of the isoreticular contraction strategy in enhancing MOFs for sophisticated gas adsorption and separation processes.

         <title>Fluorescent Coating through Melanisation of Merocyanine Based on Catechol Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel NIR&#8208;fluorophore featuring a merocyanine core and catechol moiety was synthesised for the first time using a straightforward multicomponent approach. Leveraging the catechol's exceptional surface adhesion and polymerisation capabilities, innovative fluorescent polymeric coatings were successfully developed on substrates, including glass, cupronickel, and polypropylene, via bioinspired melanisation. This work paves the way for advanced applications in surface functionalisation and material science.







Abstract
In this study, we present a novel approach for synthesising a merocyanine (MC) compound that integrates gallol and a near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorophore using a straightforward method. We conduct a comprehensive structural analysis to elucidate the specific roles of each functional group during monomer synthesis and their effects on the properties of both the spiropyran (SP) and MC forms, particularly their fluorescence. As a proof of concept, we explore the use of these compounds in formulating innovative fluorescent polymeric coatings by melanising catechol and gallol moieties on various substrates, including glass, a cupronickel coin, and an organic polymer. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a bioinspired approach utilizing the melanisation of a catechol and gallol moiety containing merocyanine.

         <title>Iodide Double Perovskites and the Limits of their Structural Stability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
What determines the stability of iodide double perovskite compounds and our ability to synthesize them? Despite being highly sought after, not a lot is known about this rare compositional family. We present the single crystal X&#8208;ray structures of two iodide double perovskites containing small trivalent ions, and employ design rules for perovskites, coupled with electronic structure calculations, to understand stability limits.







Abstract
While halide double perovskites A2M(I)M(III)X6 have attracted significant attention, examples involving iodides are rare. We examine the limits of the structural stability of iodide double perovskites, presenting the synthesis and single&#8208;crystal structures of Cs2NaScI6 and Cs2NaYI6. Bypassing the common expectation that iodides have small band gaps, these compounds display optical gaps of 3.10&#8197;eV [M(III)&#8201;=&#8201;Sc] and 3.65&#8197;eV [M(III)&#8201;=&#8201;Y]. Cs2NaScI6 is the only iodide double perovskite to exhibit a cubic crystal structure at room temperature. Density functional theory&#8208;based electronic structure calculations help understand the role of competing Cs3M(III)2I9 (3&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8201;:&#8201;9) phases and provide possible reasons for why iodide double perovskites based around In(III), Sb(III) and Bi(III) cations have proved elusive. We confirm design rules for halide double perovskites based around concepts of the tolerance factor and the radius ratio of the smaller, trivalent ion, but also point to situations such as what is observed for Cs2NaScI6 where a double perovskite can be trapped in a metastable structure.

         <title>Basics and Advances of Manganese&#8208;Based Cathode Materials for Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the recent achievements in manganese oxides with different polymorphs and nanostructures as potential cathode materials for aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs). In particular, various strategies, including phase/defect engineering, element doping, and coupling with carbon materials or conducting polymers, are summarized and discussed in detail. The challenges and suggestions for the development of manganese oxides for ZIBs are put forward.







Abstract
It is greatly crucial to develop low&#8208;cost energy storage candidates with high safety and stability to replace alkali metal systems for a sustainable future. Recently, aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) have received tremendous interest owing to their low cost, high safety, wide oxidation states, and sophisticated fabrication process. Nanostructured manganese (Mn)&#8208;based oxides in different polymorphs are the potential cathode materials for the widespread application of ZIBs. However, Mn&#8208;based oxide materials suffer from several drawbacks, such as low electronic/ionic conductivity and poor cycling performance. To overcome these issues, various structural modification strategies have been adopted to enhance their electrochemical activity, including phase/defect engineering, doping with foreign atoms (e.&#8201;g., metal and/or nonmetal atoms), and coupling with carbon materials or conducting polymers. Herein, this review targets to summarize the advantages and disadvantages of the above&#8208;mentioned strategies to improve the electrochemical performance of the cathodic part of ZIBs. The challenges and suggestions for the development of manganese oxides for ZIBs are put forward.

         <title>Perylene&#8208; and Perylene Diimide&#8208;based Framework Materials Constructed through Metal Coordination</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights that the synthesis of perylene (P) and perylene diimide (PDI) organic linkers, involves their integration into coordination frameworks of different dimensionalities &#8211; i.&#8201;e. 2D and 3D MOFs, and 0D MOCs. Additionally, the review highlights the structure&#8208;property relationships of P/PDI&#8208;based coordination frameworks for potential applications including electrochemical devices, photocatalysis, fluorescence sensing and photothermal conversion.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are a class of materials composed of coordinative interactions between metal ions and organic linkers, encompassing two&#8208;dimensional (2D), and three&#8208;dimensional (3D) architectures. Metal&#8208;organic cages (MOCs), a special case of these species, are discrete molecular &#8220;capsules&#8221; with zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) structures. Over the last two decades, MOFs and MOCs composed of organic perylene (P) and perylene diimide (PDI) linkers have gained much attention due to their versatile properties, which can be further enhanced after incorporation into frameworks. This minireview highlights recent progress in the construction and application of P/PDI&#8208;based coordination framework materials. The text offers an overview of the synthesis of P/PDI organic linkers, proceeds to their integration into coordination frameworks of different dimensionalities &#8211; 2D and 3D MOFs, and 0D MOCs, and then explores potential applications. These include sensing, photocatalysis, electrochemical devices and photothermal conversion and focus on the apparent structure&#8208;property relationships. Finally, the challenges and future prospects of P/PDI&#8208;derived coordination frameworks will be addressed.

&lt;p&gt;This review highlights that the synthesis of perylene (P) and perylene diimide (PDI) organic linkers, involves their integration into coordination frameworks of different dimensionalities &#8211; i.&#8201;e. 2D and 3D MOFs, and 0D MOCs. Additionally, the review highlights the structure-property relationships of P/PDI-based coordination frameworks for potential applications including electrochemical devices, photocatalysis, fluorescence sensing and photothermal conversion.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are a class of materials composed of coordinative interactions between metal ions and organic linkers, encompassing two-dimensional (2D), and three-dimensional (3D) architectures. Metal-organic cages (MOCs), a special case of these species, are discrete molecular &#8220;capsules&#8221; with zero-dimensional (0D) structures. Over the last two decades, MOFs and MOCs composed of organic perylene (&lt;b&gt;P&lt;/b&gt;) and perylene diimide (&lt;b&gt;PDI&lt;/b&gt;) linkers have gained much attention due to their versatile properties, which can be further enhanced after incorporation into frameworks. This minireview highlights recent progress in the construction and application of &lt;b&gt;P/PDI-&lt;/b&gt;based coordination framework materials. The text offers an overview of the synthesis of &lt;b&gt;P/PDI&lt;/b&gt; organic linkers, proceeds to their integration into coordination frameworks of different dimensionalities &#8211; 2D and 3D MOFs, and 0D MOCs, and then explores potential applications. These include sensing, photocatalysis, electrochemical devices and photothermal conversion and focus on the apparent structure-property relationships. Finally, the challenges and future prospects of &lt;b&gt;P/PDI&lt;/b&gt;-derived coordination frameworks will be addressed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>One&#8208;step Macrocycle&#8208;to&#8208;Macrocycle Conversion Towards Two New Macrocyclic Arenes with Different Structures and Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two new macrocyclic arenes that showed different structures and photophysical properties were synthesized by a one&#8208;step macrocycle&#8208;to&#8208;macrocycle conversion from carboxylic acid substituted octopus[3]arene. Moreover, both macrocycles had fixed conformations and electron&#8208;rich cavities, which enabled them to effectively complex various nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocyclic guests in solution and the solid state.







Abstract
Two new macrocyclic arenes H1 and H2 were conveniently synthesized by the one&#8208;step reaction of carboxylic acid substituted octopus[3]arene. It was found that H1 was composed of three ethenoanthracene subunits with a rigid hexagonal structure and H2 contained two ethenoanthracene subunits and one anthracene subunit with a rigid house&#8208;shaped structure. Among them, H2 exhibited strong blue fluorescence due to the existence of an anthracene subunit. Moreover, both H1 and H2 showed large and electron&#8208;rich cavities, which enable them to effectively complex different nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocyclic salt guests in solution and the solid state. It was further found that H2 exhibited stronger complexation towards the tested guests than H1 probably due to the stronger charge&#8208;transfer interactions between H2 and the guests.

         <title>Neutral interface directed 3D confined self&#8208;assembly of block copolymer: Anisotropic patterned particles with ordered structures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Three&#8208;dimensional confined self&#8208;assembly (3D&#8208;CSA) of block copolymers (BCPs) is a distinctive and robust strategy that can yield colloidal polymer particles boasting ordered internal structures and diverse morphologies. The unique advantage of neutral interface lies in its ability to create anisotropic particles with surface patterns. The resulting unique polymer particles exhibit deformability under swelling, coupled with excellent spreadability and optical properties. These particles can also be used for fabrication of anisotropic nanoobjects or mesoporous particles via disassembly or serving as templates. This review comprehensively outlines the research advancements in neutral interface&#8208;guided 3D&#8208;CSA systems, including surfactant engineering, internal structure control, properties and future possibilities of anisotropic patterned particles.</dc:description>

         <title>Quadruple stimuli&#8208;responsive behaviour of acylhydrazone crystals: Mechanical, Photomechanical, Thermomechanical, and Optical Waveguide Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As society advances, the demand for high&#8208;performance crystal materials with versatile stimuli&#8208;responsive capabilities has increased. However, there remains a notable shortage of simple molecular crystals that exhibit stable and swift responses to various stimuli. In this study, we synthesized a novel acylhydrazone crystal by integrating benzene&#8208;fused heterocycles and halogens, achieving a crystal material with multiple stimuli&#8208;responsive behaviours. The crystal demonstrates good mechanical flexibility, capable of with standing a strain of 2.3% under applying mechanical force and recovering its original shape after force removal. Crystal structure analysis reveals this property is due to the strong and flexible intermolecular interactions. It also exhibits rapid photomechanical bending away from light source under UV irradiation, which could be attributed to the facile photoisomerization. Moreover, the crystal undergoes significant thermomechanical transitions, including cracking and jumping, upon heating. Additionally, the prepared crystal exhibits passive optical waveguide of red light at 850 nm, which, combining the photomechanical bending, can achieve controllable light output direction. These multi&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive behaviors make the acylhydrazone crystal a promising candidate for applications in multifunctional sensors, optoelectronic devices, and thermal switches. This work provides a helpful reference for the study of potential crystal material design and functionality of advanced responsive systems.</dc:description>

         <title>A Chalcogenide&#8208;Derived NiFe2O4&#160;as Highly Efficient and Stable Anode for Anion Exchange Membrane Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing low&#8208;cost, highly active, and durable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrodes is one of the critical scientific issues for anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer (AEM&#8208;WE). Herein, we report a vacancy&#8208;rich and alkali&#8208;stable NiFe2O4&#8208;type electrode (named as NiFeOx&#8208;350&#8208;Ov), derived from the chemical&#8208;vapor deposited precursor NiFeSexSy&#8208;350, as an efficient and robust anode material. The obtained electrode affords current densities of 100 and 500 mA cm&#8722;2 at overpotentials of 245 and 270 mV, respectively, and displays excellent long&#8208;term durability sustaining 1.0 A cm&#8722;2 at least for 1000 h. When coupled with Ni4Mo/MoO2/NF as hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalyst, the resulting platinum group metal (PGM)&#8208;free single&#8208;cell AEM&#8208;WE exhibits a cell voltage of 1.71 V at the current density of 1000 mA cm&#8722;2 at 80 &#176;C and long&#8208;term durability during a current&#8208;cycling test between 0.5 and 1.0 A cm&#8722;2 over 150 h at 60 &#176;C.

         <title>Synthesis of polysubstituted vinyl sulfones by direct C&#8208;S cross&#8208;coupling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Vinyl sulfones are valued for their unique chemical properties and bioactivity, but creating a wide range of different analogs remains a challenge. To address this limitation, we have developed a novel approach that facilitates the synthesis of polysubstituted vinyl sulfones. This method utilizes the dual functionality of NIS as a promoter that enables sulfonation and elimination in the synthesis of vinyl sulfones. We used the broad applicability, efficiency, selectivity, and functional group tolerance of this approach to synthesize more than 70 examples. Additionally, competition experiments have provided insights into the reactivity and selectivity of the transient sulfonyl radical towards various C&#8208;C multiple bonds. Herein, we describe using this mild protocol in the late&#8208;stage vinyl sulfonation of complex molecules to simplify the synthesis of specific targets and enable the modification of complex natural products and advanced materials.</dc:description>

Herein, we describe using this mild protocol in the late-stage vinyl sulfonation of complex molecules to simplify the synthesis of specific targets and enable the modification of complex natural products and advanced materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Recovery of Berry Natural Products Using Pyrene&#8208;Based MOF Solid Phase Extraction</title>

Recovery of berry natural products (BNPs) by solid&#8208;phase extraction (SPE) using pyrene&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) Al&#8208;PyrMOF and Zn&#8208;NU&#8208;1000. The success of MOF&#8208;SPE was evaluated by their ability to capture and desorb BNPs at elevated concentration.







Abstract
This work introduces a novel method of recovering bioactive berry natural products (BNPs) using solid phase extraction with metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOF&#8208;SPE). Two pyrene&#8208;based MOFs with different structural topologies, Al&#8208;PyrMOF and Zr&#8208;NU&#8208;1000, were evaluated for their ability to capture and desorb BNPs, including ellagic acid, quercetin, gallic acid, and p&#8208;coumaric acid. Time&#8208;dependent BNP uptake via dispersive SPE revealed that NU&#8208;1000 outperformed Al&#8208;PyrMOF in capturing all BNPs. Our findings show NU&#8208;1000 demonstrated a higher and more consistent BNP capture profile, achieving over 90&#8201;% capture of all BNPs within 36&#8197;h, with only a 9&#8201;% variation between the most and least effectively captured BNPs. In contrast, Al&#8208;PyrMOF, displayed a staggered uptake profile, with a significant 53&#8201;% difference in capture efficiency between the most and least effectively captured BNP. However, when a BNP mixture was used at a loading concentration of 50&#8197;&#956;g/mL, Al&#8208;PyrMOF outperformed NU&#8208;1000, capturing over 70&#8201;% of all BNPs. Al&#8208;PyrMOF also exhibited improved BNP recovery, with a minimum of two&#8208;fold greater amount recovered for all BNPs. Further testing with a BNP mixture at a concentration of 15&#8197;&#956;g/mL demonstrated that Al&#8208;PyrMOF efficiently concentrated all BNPs, achieving a maximum extraction factor of 2.71 observed for quercetin. These findings highlight the use of Al&#8208;PyrMOF as a MOF&#8208;SPE sorbent for recovering bioactive BNPs.

         <title>Tuning Electron&#8208;Transfer Driving Force in Photosynthetic Special Pair Models</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In bimetallic {(tpy)Ru&#8208;Ru(L)}, MLCT excited states prepared upon visible light absorption are photoinduced mixed valence systems. This makes them excellent models of the photosynthetic reaction center. In these models, the balance of positive charge density is determined by the tpy radical anion and can be finely controlled by ligand L substitution. Impacts on electronic spectroscopy of photoinduced IVCT bands are discussed with the help of TD&#8208;DFT.







Abstract
Visible&#8208;light excitation of a family of bimetallic ruthenium polypyridines with the formula [RuII(tpy)(bpy)(&#8208;CN)RuII(py)4L]n+ (RuRuLn+), where L=Cl&#8722;, NCS&#8722;, DMAP and ACN, was used to prepare photoinduced mixed&#8208;valence (PI&#8208;MV) MLCT states as models of the photosynthetic reaction center. Ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy allowed to monitor photoinduced IVCT bands between 6000 and 11000&#8197;cm&#8722;1. Mulliken spin densities resulting from DFT and (TD)DFT computations revealed the modulation of the charge density distribution depending on the ligand substitution pattern. Results are consistent with PI&#8208;MV systems ranging from non&#8208;degenerate Class&#8197;II to degenerate Class&#8197;III or II/III, with electronic couplings between 1000 and 3500&#8197;cm&#8722;1. These findings guide the control electron localization&#8208;delocalization in charge&#8208;transfer/charge&#8208;separated excited states, like those involved in the photosynthetic reaction center.

         <title>A Rare Case of Magnesium Alkyl Mediated CO&#8208;to&#8208;Alkoxide Conversion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
While the addition of Mg alkyls to CO2 is generally fast and selective, reactions with CO are troubled by the instability of the acyl anion. Herein we report an odd case of a highly selective three&#8208;fold addition to CO. Switching polarities converts a Mg alkyl into a Mg alkoxide complex.







Abstract
Alcohols can be produced by nucleophilic addition at the C=O functional group of ketones or aldehydes. Such C&#8722;C bond formations generally proceed smoothly and selective. In contrast, nucleophilic addition at carbon monoxide is considerably more complex and unselective due to the instability of polar metal acyl intermediates. Herein, we report a magnesium alkyl complex, stabilised with a dipyrromethenide ligand, and its reactivity with CO2 and CO. Whilst the reaction with CO2 gave the expected carboxylate, reaction with CO took a surprising course, resulting in an alkoxide by formation of three new C&#8722;C bonds in a single reaction. An intertwined experimental and computational approach sheds light on the unusual reactivity of a carbene intermediate.

         <title>Proximity Effects and Aggregation of Hamilton&#8208;Receptor Barbiturate Host&#8211;Guest Complexes Probed by Cross&#8208;Metathesis and ESI MS Analysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The formation of Hamilton receptor&#8208;barbiturate host&#8211;guest complexes (H&#8722;B) and their aggregates was studied using a two&#8208;step method, firstly covalent fixation via cross&#8208;metathesis (CM), followed by ESI MS analysis. This approach, using a cyclopentene&#8208;modified Hamilton receptor (H) and allyl&#8208;substituted barbital (B), confirmed the formation of hydrogen&#8208;bonded aggregates, both in solution and in bulk&#8208;polymers.







Abstract
The molecular environment around supramolecular bonding systems significantly affects their stability and the assembly of host&#8211;guest complexes, most prominent for hydrogen bonds (H&#8208;bonds). Hamilton receptor&#8208;barbiturate host&#8211;guest complexes are well&#8208;known in solution, typically forming a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 molar ratio complex. However, within a polymer matrix, these complexes can form higher&#8208;order assemblies, deviating from the standard 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 complex, which are challenging to characterize and often require lab&#8208;intensive methods. In this study, a novel Hamilton receptor (H) was equipped with cyclopentene moieties and used as a host to form host&#8211;guest complexes (H&#8722;B) with allobarbital (B), followed by covalent crosslinking. UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy titration experiments in different solvents and at various temperatures revealed that polar solvents containing additional H&#8208;bonding sites significantly reduce the formation of the 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 H&#8722;B complex, as indicated by a reduced association constant. Higher&#8208;order aggregates (HH&#8208;dimer, HHH&#8208;trimer) were subsequently detected via an alkene cross&#8208;metathesis (CM) reaction to fix the assemblies covalently, followed by analysis via electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI MS). This two&#8208;step method, firstly via CM fixation followed by ESI MS, was extended to study the H&#8722;B model complex within a polyisobutylene (PIB) matrix, presenting a direct method to analyze the complex host&#8211;guest assembly in solvent&#8208;free (polymer) environments.

The current study focuses on the synthesis and characterization of BICAAC&#8208;stabilized borenium ion equivalents and their application in the hydrosilylation of carbonyls and para&#8208;quinone methides. A broad library of electronically diverse aldehydes and ketones was screened, achieving a turnover frequency (TOFmax) of 1200&#8197;h&#8722;1 with benzaldehyde using 1&#8197;mol&#8201;% of the catalyst in 5&#8197;minutes.







Abstract
Hydride abstraction from the borane adduct, (BICAAC)&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;BH3 afforded the hydride bridged dinuclear borenium ion equivalent complexes 1 and 2 that have been characterized by various spectroscopic and spectrometric techniques followed by the assessment of Lewis acidity using the Gutmann&#8208;Beckett method. The single crystal X&#8208;ray structure of complex 2 revealed the presence of discrete ions in the solid state. The complex (BICAAC)&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;BH2(OTf) (3), obtained from the reaction of (BICAAC)&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;BH3 with MeOTf, formed the corresponding boronium cations [(BICAAC)&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;BH2(L)]+(OTf)&#8722; on reaction with Lewis bases (L= pyridine (4) and DMAP (5)). Complexes 1 and 2 demonstrated notable catalytic activity in the hydrosilylation of a diverse array of carbonyls using 1.0&#8197;mol&#8201;% catalyst loading (achieving the highest turnover frequency (TOFmax) of up to 1200&#8197;h&#8722;1 with benzaldehyde. A broad substrate scope has been presented for aldehydes and ketones decorated with various electron&#8208;donating and withdrawing substituents along with this the hydrosilylation of a few para&#8208;quinone methides has also been presented.

         <title>Modulating the Supramolecular Assembly of &#945;&#8208;Cyclodextrin and Anderson&#8208;type Polyoxometalate through Covalent Modifications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report here the supramolecular complexion of &#945;&#8208;cyclodextrins (&#945;&#8208;CDs) and the covalently modified Anderson&#8208;type polyoxometalates (POMs). It is demonstrated that the covalent modification mode of the Anderson POMs has a profound influence on the resulting supramolecular complexes, which feature novel organic&#8208;inorganic pseudo&#8208;rotaxane structures and stable chirality transfer in aqueous solutions due to strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds.







Abstract
A series of unprecedented supramolecular complexes of covalently modified Anderson&#8208;type polyoxometalates (POMs) and &#945;&#8208;cyclodextrins (&#945;&#8208;CDs) have been obtained and characterized in solid state by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, and in aqueous solution using various techniques including 1H DOSY NMR, 2D NOESY 1H NMR, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), and electrospray ionization time&#8208;of&#8208;flight mass spectroscopy (ESI&#8208;TOF&#8208;MS). It has been demonstrated that the supramolecular assembly process could be modulated by different covalent modification modes of the Anderson POMs, giving rise to a new type of POM/&#945;&#8208;CD complexes featuring organic&#8208;inorganic pseudo&#8208;rotaxane structures, which are in good contrast to those of POM/&#947;&#8208;CD complexes of poly&#8208;rotaxane structures. Moreover, it is delighted to find that these pseudo&#8208;rotaxanes of POM/&#945;&#8208;CD complexes exhibit stable chirality in aqueous solution, which has not been accomplished in previously reported POM/CD assemblies.

         <dc:description>
Asymmetric three&#8208;component coupling to construct hydroxy or amino substituted chiral &#946;&#8208;lactams through Kinugasa/aldol or Kinugasa/Mannich cascade reactions were developed. This strategy enables creating contiguous three stereogenic centers, controlled by copper(I) catalysts and chiral bis(oxazolidine) ligands. The developed protocol features high stereoselectivity, good reaction efficiency, and mild operational condition representing a practical and sustainable synthetic tool for the construction of chiral &#946;&#8208;lactams.







Abstract
The &#946;&#8208;lactam scaffolds are the prevalent structural units in antibiotics and natural products. Herein, three&#8208;component asymmetric Kinugasa/aldol and Kinugasa/Mannich cascade reactions have been developed for constructing &#945;&#8208;quaternary chiral &#946;&#8208;lactams. This method involved the tandem reaction of alkynes, nitrones and aldehydes (or imines), resulting in the formation of three sequential stereocenters controlled by copper(I) catalysts and chiral bis(oxazolidine) ligands. The developed protocol features high enantioselectivity, good reaction efficiency, and mild operational conditions, representing a practical and sustainable synthetic tool for the construction of functionalized chiral &#946;&#8208;lactams.

         <title>Bismuth Bound to Transition Metals: Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced Olefin Coordination, Reductive Elimination, and Oxidative Addition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A set of transition metal carbonyl complexes with a bismuth&#8208;ligand that bears an olefin functional group have been investigated. Visible&#8208;light&#8208;irradiation leads to CO elimination and concomitant coordination of the olefin moiety to the transition metal center in a chemically reversible process. Complexes featuring two bismuth&#8208;based ligands engage in oxidative addition/reductive elimination reactions of the corresponding dibismuthane, R2Bi&#8211;BiR2.







Abstract
A series of dibenzobismepinyl (C14H10Bi) substituted transition metal complexes of the type [(C14H10Bi)M(CO)x(L)] (M=Mn, Co, Fe) was prepared in salt elimination reactions from a halobismepine and sodium metallates. Irradiation of these complexes with visible light has been investigated, aiming at the elimination of one carbonyl ligand and the concomitant coordination of the bismepine's olefin moiety to the transition metal center. The resulting complexes of the type [{&#954;2C,&#954;1Bi&#8208;(C14H10)Bi}M(CO)x&#8722;1(L)] (M=Co, Fe) have been isolated and fully characterized. When two dibenzobismepinyl units are positioned in the coordination sphere of an iron carbonyl complex fragment, reductive elimination/oxidative addition events of the dibismuthane (C14H10Bi)2 have been shown to be relevant. The analytical techniques applied in this work include (heteronuclear) NMR spectroscopy, elemental analysis, single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis, UV/Vis spectroscopy, IR spectroscopy and (TD)&#8208;DFT calculations.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of Metallo&#8208;Supramolecular Amphiphiles based on Azadipyrromethenes: Consecutive Pathways to Nanodiscs and Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Consecutive self&#8208;assembly pathways were revealed for a metallo&#8208;supramolecular amphiphilic dye based on azadipyrromethenes, which led to the first formation of kinetic&#8208;controlled, nanodisc&#8208;shaped Agg. I and the further spontaneous transformation from Agg. I to the thermodynamically more stable Agg. II with a morphology of nanosheet.







Abstract
A new class of metallo&#8208;supramolecular amphiphilic dyes 1&#8201;a, b was constructed by using two azadipyrromethene units which were respectively modified with two hydrophobic alkyl and two hydrophilic oligo(ethylene glycol) chains. The spectroscopic and morphological studies revealed the consecutive self&#8208;assembly pathways of 1&#8201;a in EtOH/H2O mixed solvent. The monomers of 1&#8201;a firstly aggregated into the kinetic&#8208;controlled, nanodisc&#8208;shaped Agg. I upon cooling and the latter spontaneously transformed into the thermodynamically more stable Agg. II with a nanosheet morphology. While the non&#8208;fluorescent Agg. I displayed a broad absorption band (&#955;max=615&#8197;nm), the Agg. II displayed a more intensive and narrowed J&#8208;band (&#955;max=693&#8197;nm) and a fluorescence band with a maximum at 760&#8197;nm (&#934;fl=0.1), which could be ascribed to the J&#8208;aggregation induced emission enhancement. The kinetics of Agg. I to Agg. II transformation was further modulated by seed&#8208;initiated supramolecular polymerization with various ratios of Seedagg.II, in which the transformation rate was significantly increased by ca. 2 orders of magnitude compared to the spontaneous process. The supramolecular amphiphile 1&#8201;b bearing longer hydrophilic chains formed only one type aggregate, which exhibited spectroscopic and morphological properties that were highly comparable with that of Agg. I.

&lt;p&gt;Consecutive self-assembly pathways were revealed for a metallo-supramolecular amphiphilic dye based on azadipyrromethenes, which led to the first formation of kinetic-controlled, nanodisc-shaped &lt;b&gt;Agg. I&lt;/b&gt; and the further spontaneous transformation from &lt;b&gt;Agg. I&lt;/b&gt; to the thermodynamically more stable &lt;b&gt;Agg. II&lt;/b&gt; with a morphology of nanosheet.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new class of metallo-supramolecular amphiphilic dyes &lt;b&gt;1&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;b&lt;/b&gt; was constructed by using two azadipyrromethene units which were respectively modified with two hydrophobic alkyl and two hydrophilic oligo(ethylene glycol) chains. The spectroscopic and morphological studies revealed the consecutive self-assembly pathways of &lt;b&gt;1&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt; in EtOH/H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O mixed solvent. The monomers of &lt;b&gt;1&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt; firstly aggregated into the kinetic-controlled, nanodisc-shaped &lt;b&gt;Agg. I&lt;/b&gt; upon cooling and the latter spontaneously transformed into the thermodynamically more stable &lt;b&gt;Agg. II&lt;/b&gt; with a nanosheet morphology. While the non-fluorescent &lt;b&gt;Agg. I&lt;/b&gt; displayed a broad absorption band (&lt;i&gt;&#955;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;=615&#8197;nm), the &lt;b&gt;Agg. II&lt;/b&gt; displayed a more intensive and narrowed J-band (&lt;i&gt;&#955;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;=693&#8197;nm) and a fluorescence band with a maximum at 760&#8197;nm (&lt;i&gt;&#934;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;fl&lt;/sub&gt;=0.1), which could be ascribed to the J-aggregation induced emission enhancement. The kinetics of &lt;b&gt;Agg. I&lt;/b&gt; to &lt;b&gt;Agg. II&lt;/b&gt; transformation was further modulated by seed-initiated supramolecular polymerization with various ratios of &lt;b&gt;Seed&lt;sub&gt;agg.II&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;, in which the transformation rate was significantly increased by ca. 2 orders of magnitude compared to the spontaneous process. The supramolecular amphiphile &lt;b&gt;1&#8201;b&lt;/b&gt; bearing longer hydrophilic chains formed only one type aggregate, which exhibited spectroscopic and morphological properties that were highly comparable with that of &lt;b&gt;Agg. I&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>Two&#8208;photon absorption (TPA) has attracted growing attention over recent years owing to the wide range of applications in organic nonlinear optical (NLO) materials. The quantitative sensitivity of a two&#8208;photon molecular entity is determined by its TPA cross&#8208;section (&#948;TPA). Perylene diimides (PDIs) are excellent n&#8208;type organic semiconductor materials demonstrating distinguished thermal, optical, and chemical stability. Nonetheless, PDIs&#8208;based sca&#64256;olds exhibit poor &#948;TPA &#160;in the NIR&#8208;I region (700&#8208;900 nm) due to the lack of suitable molecular design. Here, two novel star&#8208;shaped PDIs fluorophores, namely PDI&#8208;S and PDI&#8208;Se, were constructed by four periphery S/Se&#8208;fused PDIs connected with bicarbazole core. PDI&#8208;S manifested excellent &#948;TPA of 3775 GM, which are among the highest values reported for PDIs excited in the NIR&#8208;I region.</dc:description>

Analysis using spectroscopic (NMR, UV&#8208;vis and M&#246;ssbauer for E{14} = Sn), X&#8208;ray diffraction and computational (DFT, QTAIM, TD&#8208;DFT) methods conclude an Al&#8211;E{14} &#963;&#8208;bond derived from a Lewis basic Al and a Lewis acidic tetrylene, with back&#8208;donation from the E{14} &#963;&#8208;orbital lone pair donor NBO to acceptor NBOs on Al derived from s/p&#8208;orbitals. The reaction of the Al&#8211;Ge compound with CO2 forms the dioxocarbene (NON)Al(&#956;&#8208;O2C)Ge(Am), whilst under the same conditions the Al&#8211;Sn compound reacts with additional CO2 to form the carbonate, (NON)Al(&#956;&#8208;CO3)Sn(Am).

         <title>Design and Conformation of Separators for High&#8208;performance Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 65, November 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Separators serve as a core component in aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs), playing a pivotal role in ensuring long&#8208;term cycling stability and facilitating efficient charging and discharging processes, thereby attracting considerable attention. This concept focuses on the structural&#8208;performance relationships of separators, with a particular emphasis on three forms, i.&#8201;e., traditional membrane separators, solid&#8208;state electrolyte separators, and electrode coating separators.







Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) are considered promising candidates for large&#8208;scale energy storage due to their high safety, low cost, and environmental friendliness. As a core component, separator plays a unique yet oftentimes overlooked role in providing electrochemical stability in AZIBs. This concept focuses on the exquisite structure&#8208;property relationship of separators, highlighting three forms of these components and their structural design requirements, i.&#8201;e., traditional membranes, solid&#8208;state electrolytes, and electrode coatings. The mechanism by which separators influence the zinc anode and the cathode is discussed. The article also identifies the challenges and potential future directions for functional separators in the development of high&#8208;performance AZIBs.

         <title>Manipulating the Substituent Sphere of a Bicyclic Silicon(I) Ring Compound Results in Anionic Cubane&#8208;Type Clusters and a Tetrahedral Silanide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 65, November 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Systematic access to anionic silylamine&#8208;substituted silicon&#8208;based cubanes with unsubstituted atoms was achieved upon cleavage of amido ligands from a bicyclic silicon(I) ring compound with KC8. A possible intermediate that dimerizes to the products was trapped with SiMe3Cl. With KOtBu selective SiMe3 group abstraction form the bicyclic silicon(I) ring compound results in anionic tetrahedral silanide that is coordinated by a bridging imido substituent.







Abstract
The reaction of the bicyclic silicon(I) ring compound Si4{N(SiMe3)Mes}4 1 with strong zwitterionic character and moderate sterical demand of the amido substituents with two equivalents of KC8 was investigated. This resulted in the unexpected abstraction of two amido substituents from 1 and additionally in dimerization to a dianionic Si8 cluster compound 2 with four unsubstituted silicon atoms and two [K([18]crown&#8208;6)]+ counter cations. Performing this reaction in the absence of [18]crown&#8208;6 results in release of only one amido substituent from 1 and dimerization to a dianionic Si8 cluster 3 with only two unsubstituted silicon atoms. This reaction with KC8 was repeated and trapping agents such as SiMe3Cl and tBuCl were added in&#8208;situ whereupon the second isolated homocyclic silylene 4 and a monoanionic hydride and tBu substituted Si8 cluster 5 with one unsubstituted silicon atom were isolated. Furthermore, 1 was reacted with KOtBu which resulted in the selective abstraction of one SiMe3 group and formation of the tetrahedral silanide 6 with one imido substituent bridging an edge of the tetrahedron.

         <title>Mapping Electrophile Chemoselectivity in DalPhos/Nickel N&#8208;Arylation Catalysis: The Unusual Influence of Remote Sterics</title>

Factors that influence (hetero)aryl (pseudo)halide electrophile chemoselectivity in nickel&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;N cross&#8208;couplings using furfurylamine as a test nucleophile are examined, including assessing catalyst&#8208;dependent electrophile preferences and identification of a notable impact of remote aryl sterics on nickel&#8208;catalyzed processes.







Abstract
We disclose herein our evaluation of competitive (hetero)aryl&#8208;X (X: Br&gt;Cl&gt;OTf) reactivity preferences in bisphosphine/Ni&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;N cross&#8208;coupling catalysis, using furfurylamine as a prototypical nucleophile, and employing DalPhos and DPPF as representative ancillary ligands with established efficacy. Beyond this general (pseudo)halide ranking, other intriguing structure&#8208;reactivity trends were noted experimentally, including the unexpected observation that bulky alkyl (e.&#8201;g., R=tBu) substitution in para&#8208;R&#8208;aryl&#8208;X electrophiles strongly discourages (pseudo)halide reactivity relative to smaller substituents (e.&#8201;g., nBu, Et, Me), despite being both remote from, and having a similar electronic influence on, the reacting C&#8722;X bond; such effects on nickel oxidative addition have not been documented previously and were not observed in our comparator reactions presented herein involving palladium. Density functional theory modeling of such PhPAd&#8208;DalPhos/Ni&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;N cross&#8208;couplings revealed the origins of competitive turnover of C&#8722;Br over C&#8722;Cl, and possible ways in which bulky para&#8208;alkyl substitution might discourage net electrophile uptake/turnover, leading to inversion of halide selectivity.

A photoinduced copper&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective conjugate addition of acylsilanes has been developed.

         <title>Chiral Pd(II) Nanofiber Promoting Electron Transfer of g&#8208;C3N4 for Efficient Photocatalytic Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 65, November 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral supramolecular nanofiber (the yellow helix in the picture) was fabricated and used as a co&#8208;catalyst to promote the charge transfer of g&#8208;C3N4 (the light pink rectangle and dark blue block represent the g&#8208;C3N4 and its CB and VB, respectively) through the chiral induced spin selectivity effect for efficient photocatalytic H2 evolution.







Abstract
The rapid transfer and separation of photogenerated electrons is very important for the improvement of photocatalytic efficiency. Here, chiral induced spin selectivity effect (CISS effect) was developed to accelerate electron transfer for efficient photocatalytic hydrogen production. A chiral and achiral racemic supramolecular Pd(II) complex nanofiber was fabricated via supramolecular self&#8208;assembly of chiral L&#8722;Py or its racemes with Pd(II) and used to modify carbon nitride (g&#8208;C3N4). The obtained chiral photocatalyst L&#8722;Py&#8722;Pd/g&#8208;C3N4&#8208;4 and achiral photocatalyst Rac&#8208;Pd/g&#8208;C3N4&#8208;4, show enhanced photocatalytic activities with hydrogen evolution rates of 2476 and 1339&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, respectively, while that of pure g&#8208;C3N4 is 30.5&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1. Chiral photocatalyst has 85&#8201;% higher activity than achiral one and is 82.5&#8208;fold of pure g&#8208;C3N4, due to better suppression of the recombination of photogenerated electron&#8208;hole pairs in the interface of g&#8208;C3N4 contact with chiral molecule. Spectral tests and photoelectrochemical tests proved that the chiral supramolecular Pd(II) complex can act both as an electron spin filter and hydrogen reduction catalytic center to enhance photocatalytic efficiency. This work offers a new route to facilitate electron transfer by the CISS effect for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Divergent Synthesis of a 13&#8208;Ring Triquinone and its Facile Conversion to a [4.4.4]Tridecastarphene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 65, November 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;pot divergent synthesis of a 13&#8208;ring triquinone that is readily converted to a [4.4.4]tridecastarphene is reported. The starphene was characterized by 1H&#8197;NMR, 13C&#8197;NMR and UV&#8208;vis spectroscopies, as well as mass spectrometry, cyclic voltammetry, differential pulse voltammetry and DFT calculations, and appears suitable as a p&#8208;type organic semiconductor.







Abstract
Acenes are notable for their optoelectronic properties and applications in organic electronics. Starphenes are structurally related molecules possessing three acene arms that radiate linearly from a central benzene ring (i.&#8201;e., linearly annellated triphenylenes). Large starphenes have been prepared using convergent syntheses involving transition metal catalyzed cyclotrimerizations of either preformed acenes or arynes. Here, we report a one&#8208;pot divergent synthesis of a 13&#8208;ring triquinone that is readily converted to a [4.4.4]tridecastarphene derivative. The one&#8208;pot procedure involves the sequential reactions of three 1,4&#8208;anthraquinones with o&#8208;quinodimethane derivatives that are generated sequentially from a stable, trisulfone precursor. The resulting [4.4.4]tridecastarphene derivative bearing p&#8208;(t&#8208;butyl)phenyl substituents was characterized by 1H&#8197;NMR, 13C&#8197;NMR and UV&#8208;vis spectroscopies, as well as mass spectrometry, cyclic voltammetry and differential pulse voltammetry. Theoretical and experimental studies reveal a relatively high&#8208;lying HOMO orbital (about &#8722;4.70 to &#8722;4.86&#8197;eV) and a relatively small HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap (2.1&#8197;eV), suggesting utility as a p&#8208;type organic semiconductor. Our [4.4.4]tridecastarphene derivative photooxidizes in a CH2Cl2 solution exposed to ambient light and air with a half&#8208;life of 150&#8197;minutes at room temperature, but shows no sign of degradation after 12&#8197;months in the solid&#8208;state. Our [4.4.4]tridecastarphene derivative also shows excellent solubility in a number of organic solvents including dichloromethane, chloroform and toluene, potentially enabling printed electronic applications.

Our [4.4.4]tridecastarphene derivative photooxidizes in a CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; solution exposed to ambient light and air with a half-life of 150&#8197;minutes at room temperature, but shows no sign of degradation after 12&#8197;months in the solid-state. Our [4.4.4]tridecastarphene derivative also shows excellent solubility in a number of organic solvents including dichloromethane, chloroform and toluene, potentially enabling printed electronic applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Selective Oxidation of Alcohols to Carbonyls Under Decatungstate&#8208;Mediated Photoelectrochemical Conditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 65, November 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The selective conversion of both benzylic and aliphatic alcohols to the corresponding carbonyl compounds has been realized under photoelectrochemical conditions mediated by the decatungstate anion. Comparison with chemical oxidant&#8208;promoted and electrochemical conditions demonstrated the superior efficiency of the photoelectrochemical manifold, thanks to the mild conditions involved.







Abstract
The oxidation of alcohols to the corresponding carbonyl derivatives has been realized under photoelectrochemical conditions in the presence of tetrabutylammonium decatungstate (TBADT) as the homogeneous photocatalyst. The protocol can be applied to both primary and secondary, benzylic and aliphatic alcohols. The desired products are obtained selectively, skipping the need for purposely added chemical oxidants. An in&#8208;depth study of photoelectrochemical conditions revealed that the protocol works best under amperostatic conditions in an undivided electrochemical cell irradiated with a 390&#8197;nm LED lamp. The comparison with analogous electrochemical and chemical oxidant&#8208;promoted photocatalytic transformations demonstrates the superior efficiency and selectivity of the hereby reported photoelectrochemical conditions.

         <title>Chiral Amphiphilic Au23 Cluster and Its Specific Recognition to Remote Di&#8208;amines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 65, November 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hydrophility, amphiphilicity, chirality, thermostability, luminescence intensity and circularly polarized luminescence properties of the [Au23(CHT)16]&#8722; has been greatly improved after incorporating the captopril ligands, which further endows the clusters with specific recognizing capacity to remote di&#8208;amine structures such as Arg, Cys, and DNA strands. Chiral Amphiphilic Au23 Cluster and Its Specific Recognition to Remote Di&#8208;amines.







Abstract
The atomic precision of metal nanoclusters and variability of surface ligands pave the way for their rational design and functionalization, whereas the property strengthening in multiple ways has been long challenging. Herein, improved amphiphilicity, chirality, thermostability, and strong CPL (circularly polarized luminescence) properties have been accomplished by facile ligand exchange of [Au23(CHT)16]&#8722; with HCapt (HCHT and HCapt denote cyclohexanethiol and captopril). In addition, the obtained chiral [Au23(SR)16]&#8722; (short for [Au23(CHT)16&#8208;x(Capt)x]&#8722;) clusters show specific binding affinity to remote&#8208;diamines (such as arginine and single/double strand DNA), originating from the hydrogen bonding and Van der Waals interaction among the surface Capt ligands and the di&#8208;amine groups.

Abstract
We have developed a gold&#8208;catalyzed cascade reaction of aryldiynes bearing a hydrosilyl group to afford a variety of unexplored 5H&#8208;benzo[b]indeno[2,1&#8208;d]silines. The reaction system is applicable to the synthesis of bidirectionally &#960;&#8208;extended silacycles from tetra(alkynyl)aryl compounds. Computational studies suggest that 5H&#8208;benzo[b]indeno[2,1&#8208;d]silines are formed via the insertion of a vinyl carbocation intermediate into the Si&#8722;H bond.

         <title>Insoluble Acyclic Cucurbit[n]uril&#8208;Type Receptors Capture Iodine from the Vapor Phase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 65, November 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catechol walled acyclic CB[n]&#8208;type receptors function as solid state sequestrants for iodine from the vapor phase with uptake capacities reaching 2.2&#8197;g&#8201;g&#8722;1 for H2. The uptake process involves both chemisorption (oxidation of H2; reduction of I2) and physisorption processes (uptake of I3&#8722; and I5&#8722;). H2 can be regenerated by treatment with aq. Na2S2O4 and reused five times.







Abstract
Nuclear energy makes large contributions toward meeting global energy needs, but societal concerns remain high given the impacts of the intended release of radioactive materials including 129I and 131I. In this paper we explore the use of a homologous series of acyclic CB[n] type hosts (H1&#8211;H4) as adsorbents of iodine from the vapor phase. We find that H2&#8211;H4, but not H1 &#8211; perform well in this application with uptake capacities of 2.2&#8197;g&#8201;g&#8722;1, 1.5&#8197;g&#8201;g&#8722;1, and 1.9&#8197;g&#8201;g&#8722;1, respectively. The chemisorptive uptake process involves partial oxidation of catechol walled H2 to quinone walled host and capture of I3&#8722; and I5&#8722;. Solid H2 can be regenerated by treatment with Na2S2O4 and reused at least five times. The x&#8208;ray crystal structure of H2 is also reported.

         <title>In Situ Built ZnS/MXene Heterostructure by a Mild Method for Inhibiting Polysulfide Shuttle in Li&#8208;S Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 65, November 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ZnS nanospheres were uniformly in&#8208;situ grown on MXene nanosheets using a mild method. Compared with the critically self&#8208;stacked MXene, the well&#8208;dispersed MXene nanosheets in ZnS/MXene heterostructures provide rich active sites and rapid Li+ transfer channels. The interfacial built&#8208;in electric field further promotes electron/ion migration, thus accelerating polysulfide conversion and alleviating the shuttle effect.







Abstract
With high specific surface area, excellent polysulfide conversion activity, and fast electron/ion transfer at the interface, MXene&#8208;derived heterostructures can be employed as catalysts for lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) batteries to accelerate sulfur redox kinetics and suppress shuttle effect. However, the preparation of MXene&#8208;derived heterostructures often requires high&#8208;temperature reactions, which can easily lead to the oxidation of MXene and sacrifice the electrical conductivity. Herein, a catalytic two&#8208;dimensional heterostructure (ZnS/MXene) was successfully synthesized via a mild method. The MXene skeleton retains the original nanosheet structure without oxidation. The in&#8197;situ&#8208;grown ZnS nanospheres prevent the restacking of MXene nanosheets, which not only increases the active sites, but also guarantees channels for the fast passage of lithium ions. The interfacial built&#8208;in electric field further promotes electron/ion migration, thereby expediting the polysulfide conversion and suppressing the shuttle effect. Consequently, the batteries using ZnS/MXene modified separators exhibit a high initial discharge capacity of 1230&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;C and a low decaying rate of 0.082&#8201;% per cycle after 500 cycles at 0.5&#8197;C. This work offers a reference for the fabrication of MXene&#8208;based heterostructure in Li&#8722;S batteries.

         <title>Formate Salt as a Bifunctional Reagent for Hydroxylation and Carbonylation Reactions Under Photochemically Driven Nickel Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 65, November 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate herein that formate salts can be used as a bifunctional reagent for hydroxylation reactions and as a CO source. The key to success is the unprecedented arylation of formate under activation&#8208;free conditions using a dual Ni/photocatalysis strategy. A wide range of phenols have been obtained, and the generated CO was used in a COware gas reactor for carbonylative processes. Interestingly, this new concept could be exploited for the direct access to 13C&#8208;labeled products.







Abstract
In this study, we disclose for the first time that formate salt can be used as a bifunctional reagent for the synthesis of phenol derivatives and as a CO source for carbonylative cross&#8208;coupling processes using the COware gas reactor under activation free conditions. Key to this success is the in&#8208;situ synthesis of aryl formate via an unprecedented nickel/organophotocatalyst system under blue LED irradiation. This developed system demonstrated high applicability to various aryl iodide substrates for synthesizing phenol derivatives. Moreover, the generated CO could be utilized in a range of carbonylative C&#8208;heteroatom and C&#8722;C processes. Notably, commercially available H13COONa salt can serve as a bifunctional reagent for both synthesizing phenols and generating 13CO.

Herein we report on the synthesis of 1,1&#8208;dichloro&#8208;2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethyl gallium compounds by selective substitution of the &#945;&#8208;fluorine atoms by chlorine atoms in [Ga(C2F5)3(FSiMe3)]. First evidence for the catalytic potential of [Ga(CCl2CF3)3(FSiMe3)] in chlorodefluorination reactions was obtained.







Abstract
The reaction of [Ga(C2F5)3(FSiMe3)] with chlorotrimethylsilane leads to the selective substitution of the &#945;&#8208;fluorine atoms by chlorine atoms and thus to the formation of [Ga(CCl2CF3)3(FSiMe3)]. The corresponding chlorogallate ion, [Ga(CCl2CF3)3Cl]&#8722;, could be isolated and structurally characterized as its tetraphenylphosphonium salt. The catalytic potential of [Ga(CCl2CF3)3(FSiMe3)] was demonstrated via the chlorodefluorination of Me3SiCF3, 2,2&#8208;difluoropropane and [PPh4][Ga(C2F5)4].

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Selective Fluorescence Sensing of Mg2+ and Al3+ Ions by Pincer&#8208;Type NNO Schiff Base Ligand: An Experimental and DFT Optimized Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 65, November 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Schiff base (SB) based dual&#8208;functional fluorescence probe to selectively detect Mg2+ and Al3+ ions in different solvents with rapid, visible fluorescence enhancement. With detection limits of 7.1&#8197;&#956;M for Mg2+ and 0.51&#8197;&#956;M for Al3+Additionally, this probe shows potential for bioimaging, including breast cancer cell imaging, supported by DFT studies







Abstract
A newly developed dual&#8208;functional fluorescence sensing probe (phenylhydrazinyl pyridine) Schiff base (SB) has been designed with good selectivity for distinguishing Mg2+ and Al3+ metal ions in different solvent solutions. SB exhibits quick and visual turn&#8208;on fluorescence enhancement in response to Mg2+ and Al3+ detection. The addition of Mg2+ in ACN&#8211;HEPES buffer (1&#8201;:&#8201;1, v/v, pH&#8197;7.2) at (&#955;max=390&#8197;nm) and Al3+ in MeOH&#8211;HEPES buffer (1&#8201;:&#8201;1, v/v, pH&#8197;7.2) at (&#955;max=360&#8197;nm) resulted in significant enhancement of fluorescence, up to 7&#8211;9 times. These low detection limits of 7.1&#215;10&#8722;6&#8197;M (7.1&#8197;&#956;M) and 5.15&#215;10&#8722;7&#8197;M (0.51&#8197;&#956;M) for Mg2+ and Al3+, respectively, have been achieved by this solvent&#8208;controlled platform. Due to the sensing potential towards Mg2+, the probe was utilized as an imaging material for breast cancer cells. 1H&#8208;NMR studies were utilized to explore SB's sensing mechanism through turn&#8208;on fluorescence. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were utilized to validate optimized SB and its intricate geometries, which govern the sensing mechanism in the solvent environment. Such a probe has extensive potential applications in bioimaging and the assessment of the quality of wastewater.

Chemical tuning of the platinum(II) diaminocarbene complexes makes them extremely high effictive transition metal photocatalysts in alkyne hydrosilylation under green light irradiation.







Abstract
Platinum(II) metalla&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene complexes featuring pyridyl heterocyclic moiety demonstrate remarkable catalytic efficiency in alkyne hydrosilylation under green light irradiation. The photocatalytic properties of complexes are rationalised by the photo&#8208;induced charge transfer occurring in extended condensed system identified with the help of various experimental (UV/vis and emission spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry) and theoretical methods (DFT/TD&#8208;DFT, IFCT analysis).

         <title>A Rare Example of a Gallium&#8208;Based Lewis Superacid: Synthesis and Reactivity of Ga(OTeF5)3</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 65, November 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Lewis superacid Ga(OTeF5)3 has been synthesized and its exceptionally high Lewis acidity has been evaluated. The compound is one of only a few examples of a hard and soft gallium&#8208;based Lewis superacid. The high Lewis acidity allowed to amplify the strength of the Br&#248;nsted acid HOTeF5 and the oxidizer Xe(OTeF5)2 in the synthesis of reactive oxonium and chloronium salts.







Abstract
The Lewis superacid Ga(OTeF5)3 has been synthesized and characterized, revealing a monomeric structure in solution and a dimeric structure in the solid state. Isolated adducts of Ga(OTeF5)3 with strong and weak Lewis bases have been characterized spectroscopically as well as by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffractometry. The Lewis acidity of this new species has been evaluated by means of different experimental and theoretical methods, which has allowed to classify it as one of only a few examples of a gallium&#8208;based Lewis superacid. The high Lewis acidity of Ga(OTeF5)3 was used to amplify the strength of the Br&#248;nsted acid HOTeF5, leading to the protonation of diethyl ether. Furthermore, Ga(OTeF5)3 was utilized to access the strong oxidizing system Ga(OTeF5)3/Xe(OTeF5)2 in SO2ClF, which was successfully employed in the synthesis of the dimethyl chloronium salt [Cl(CH3)2][Ga(OTeF5)4], a strong electrophilic methylation reagent.

         <title>Cascade Reactions of Alkynyl Ketones and Amides to Generate Unsaturated Oxacycles and Aromatic Carbocycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 65, November 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cascade reactions of alkynyl ketones and amides involving an initial conjugate addition of secondary amine or propargylic Alder&#8208;ene reaction followed by 1,4&#8208;addition of amine, selectively generate 2&#8208;methylene&#8208;2H&#8208;pyrans, substituted 3&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;9H&#8208;fluoren&#8208;9&#8208;ones, and amine&#8208;incorporated arenes. The product distributions are sensitive to the steric and electronic factors of the substituents on both the alkyne and 1,3&#8208;diyne moieties, the tether structure connecting them, and the nature of the amine.







Abstract
We describe novel amine&#8208;mediated transformation of alkynyl ketones and amides to generate 2&#8208;methylene&#8208;2H&#8208;pyrans, substituted 3&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;9H&#8208;fluoren&#8208;9&#8208;ones, and amine&#8208;incorporated arenes. These cascade processes are initiated by conjugate addition of secondary amine followed by hydrolysis of the enamine/vinylogous amide intermediates. The product distribution is highly sensitive to the steric and electronic effects of the substituents on both the alkyne moieties, the tether structure connecting them, and the nature of the amine. Alkynyl amide participates in the Alder&#8208;ene reaction favorably to generate more reactive allene amide that reacts with amine to generate amine&#8208;incorporated arene products. These metal&#8208;free cascade reactions are a useful synthetic method that can be exploited for the construction of various hetero&#8208; and carbocyclic systems.

         <title>Twisted Amide&#8208;Mediated Peptide Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 65, November 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust, practical, and sustainable isomerization&#8208;suppressed peptide bond formation via acyl sulfonamide, a twisted amide, was developed. All reagents used in this study are inexpensive and readily available, and thus the developed method can immediately become a truly practical method to solve the synthetic problems of complex molecules such as medium&#8208;sized cyclic peptides and hybrid peptide&#8208;polyketides.







Abstract
A robust, practical, and sustainable isomerization&#8208;suppressed peptide bond formation via acyl sulfonamide, a twisted amide, is disclosed. Tosyl isocyanate and pentafluorobenzyl bromide were applied in combination to activate the peptide C&#8208;terminus, which then reacted with an amine to yield an elongated peptide with high stereochemical purity. Careful analysis of NMR spectra of the active intermediate revealed the presence of an intramolecular hydrogen bond, suggesting that the hydrogen bond suppressed C&#945;&#8208;epimerization during amidation. The isomerization suppression by the intramolecular hydrogen bond is expected to be effective even under high dilution conditions, making the present method a powerful tool for the synthesis of complex macrocyclic peptides. In addition to peptide synthesis, the developed synthetic entry to twisted amides can be applied to the investigation of transition metal&#8208;catalyzed N&#8722;C bond activation. Moreover, the application to the N&#8722;C bond activation returned insight into peptide synthesis, leading to the use of sulfonamide as a protecting group of carboxylic acid that can be orthogonally removed in the presence of other conventional protecting groups.

         <title>Post&#8208;Transition State Bifurcation Controls Torsional Selectivity in Radical Addition of Allenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 65, November 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Radical addition of allenes generally exhibits post&#8208;transition state bifurcation (PTSB), in which the Z/E&#8208;stereoselectivity of the formed allylic radicals is determined by torsional dynamics. We further revealed that such dynamic selectivity is governed by the transition state geometry and the trend of the reaction coordinate, leading to a bivariate structure&#8208;selectivity model for accurate selectivity prediction.







Abstract
Post&#8208;transition state bifurcation (PTSB) has received wide attention in the field of reaction mechanism research due to its role in producing nonstatistical reaction selectivity, which cannot be solely explained by transition state theory. Particularly, even subtle molecular motions such as bond torsion can precipitate PTSB, thereby significantly complicating the quantitative understanding of dynamic selectivity. In this work, we found that the radical addition of allenes is an elementary transformation that generally exhibits PTSB stereoselectivity, where a single radical addition transition state can lead to both Z&#8208; and E&#8208;allylic radicals via the post&#8208;transition state allylic single bond torsion. Interestingly, dynamic Z/E&#8208;selectivity favors the Z&#8208;allylic radicals, which contrasts the thermodynamic preference. Based on the dynamics study of twenty&#8208;five radical additions of mono&#8208;substituted allenes with diverse electronic and steric effects, we have identified that this dynamic stereoselectivity is synergistically controlled by the transition state structure and the differential trends within specific dimensions of the bifurcating reaction coordinates, which also holds true for di&#8208;substituted allene substrates. This study refines the mechanism of radical addition of allenes and underscores the importance of the differential trend of the reaction coordinates in controlling dynamic selectivity, offering a deeper insight into PTSB selectivity factors.

Based on the dynamics study of twenty-five radical additions of mono-substituted allenes with diverse electronic and steric effects, we have identified that this dynamic stereoselectivity is synergistically controlled by the transition state structure and the differential trends within specific dimensions of the bifurcating reaction coordinates, which also holds true for di-substituted allene substrates. This study refines the mechanism of radical addition of allenes and underscores the importance of the differential trend of the reaction coordinates in controlling dynamic selectivity, offering a deeper insight into PTSB selectivity factors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photoinduced On and Off Polymeric Room Temperature Phosphorescence Based On Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon Isomers</title>

This phenomenon that anthracene and phenanthrene as isomers exhibit such a difference on room temperature phosphorescence in polyvinyl alcohol matrix by B&#8722;O click reaction, indicating that irradiation can not only induce the activation of room temperature phosphorescence, but also lead to cycloaddition reaction, especially in polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon system.







Abstract
As family members of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, compound anthracene (Ant) and phenanthrene (Phe) as isomers are widely used in organic optical materials and electronic materials. But their photochemical and physical properties are very different. In this work, the room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) properties of PVA&#8722;B&#8208;Ant and PVA&#8722;B&#8208;Phe are discussed carefully which are prepared by B&#8722;O click reaction through polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) with 9&#8208;anthraceneboronic acid (B&#8208;Ant) and 9&#8208;phenanthrenylboronic acid (B&#8208;Phe), respectively. PVA&#8722;B&#8208;Phe 1&#8201;% film exhibits excellent fluorescence (FL) emission at 374&#8197;nm and RTP emission at 523&#8197;nm with green afterglow and around 1.9&#8197;s phosphorescence lifetime. However, PVA&#8722;B&#8208;Ant 1&#8201;% film only shows strong blue FL emission at 414&#8197;nm, and the emission intensity decreases seriously with the extension of irradiation time. Experimental and theoretical calculations results suggest that the photodimer of Ant which is formed in PVA matrix under the UV light irradiation would be competitive with the process of RTP emission. This work demonstrates that the RTP properties of organic molecules might be probably affected by the photostability of the organic phosphor under UV irradiation.

Abstract
Herein, we report a mechanistic investigation of a recently developed electrochemical method for the deconstructive methoxylation of arylalcohols. A combination of synthetic, electroanalytical, and computational experiments have been performed to gain a deeper understanding of the reaction mechanism and the structural requirements for fragmentation to occur. It was found that 2&#8208;arylalcohols undergo anodic oxidation to form the corresponding aromatic radical cations, which fragment to form oxocarbenium ions and benzylic radical intermediates via mesolytic cleavage, with further anodic oxidation and trapping of the benzylic carbocation with methanol to generate the observed methyl ether products. It was also found that the electrochemical fragmentation of 2&#8208;arylalkanols is promoted by structural features that stabilize the oxocarbenium ions and/or benzylic radical intermediates formed upon mesolytic cleavage of the aromatic radical cations. With an enhanced understanding of the reaction mechanism and the structural features that promote fragmentation, it is anticipated that alternative electrosynthetic transformations will be developed that utilize this powerful, yet underdeveloped, mode of substrate activation.

A photoinduced copper&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective conjugate addition of acylsilanes to &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones and aldehydes has been developed. Metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge&#8208;transfer excitation of an alkene&#8208;bound acylcopper intermediate generates a triplet &#946;&#8208;radical&#8208;C&#8208;enolate&#8208;CuII&#8208;acyl complex with an acyl radical character, which undergoes facile C&#8722;C bond formation in the copper coordination sphere. The picture represents the triplet excited state C&#8722;C bond formation as a powerful synthetic strategy. More information can be found in the Research Article by M. Gao, M. Sawamura and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202402564).

The silicon(I) ring compound Si4{N(SiMe3)Mes}4 can be reduced by using KC8 in the presence of [18]crown&#8208;6 under abstraction of four amido substituents. This results after dimerization in the first dianionic octasilacubane&#8208;type compound with four unsubstituted silicon atoms. DFT calculations revealed that it exhibits a four&#8208;center&#8211;six&#8208;electron bond with electron density inside the cube. Further derivatizations of the silicon(I) ring compound with KC8 in the absence of [18]crown&#8208;6 but using trapping reagents results in more and different anionic silicon based clusters. More information can be found in the Research Article by F. Lips and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202400368).

The Cover Feature depicts the conversion of benzyl alcohols to the corresponding carbonyl compounds. The protocol, also extended to aliphatic derivatives, leverages the unique properties of the decatungstate anion in the role of photocatalyst. The transformation occurred smoothly under photoelectrochemical conditions, requiring the simultaneous irradiation and electrolysis of the reaction mixture, and delivered the desired products in high chemical yields and faradaic efficiencies.

         <title>Experimental and Theoretical Insights on Gas Trapping of Noble Gases in MFU&#8208;4&#8208;Type Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Isostructural metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), namely MFU&#8208;4 and MFU&#8208;4&#8208;Br, in which the pore apertures are defined by anionic side ligands (Cl&#8722; and Br&#8722;, respectively), were synthesized and loaded with noble gases. By selecting the type of side ligand, one can fine&#8208;tune the pore aperture size, allowing for precise regulation of the entry and release of gas guests. In this study, we conducted experiments to examine gas loading and release using krypton and xenon as model gases, and we complemented our findings with computational modeling. Remarkably, the loaded gas guests remained trapped inside the pores even after being exposed to air under ambient conditions for extended periods, in some cases for up to several weeks. Therefore, we focused on determining the energy barrier preventing gas release using both theoretical and experimental methods. The results were compared in relation to the types of hosts and guests, providing valuable insights into the gas trapping process in MOFs, as well as programmed gas release in air under ambient conditions. Furthermore, the crystal structure of MFU&#8208;4&#8208;Br was elucidated using the three&#8208;dimensional electron diffraction (3DED) technique, and the bulk purity of the sample was subsequently verified through Rietveld refinement.</dc:description>

         <title>Hybrid Supports for Oligonucleotide Synthesis: Controlled Pore Glass Derivatives with Branched Amine&#8208;Ended Polyether or Polyimine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hybrid solid supports have been obtained via a two&#8208;step process consisting of a silanization and a subsequent functionalization of Controlled Pore Glass with selected multi&#8208;amine compounds. In particular, 2000&#8197;&#197; CPG functionalized with 8&#8208;arm poly(ethylene glycol) with each arm amine&#8208;terminated applied for 2000&#8197;&#197; CPG allowed high loading capacity and effective automated syntheses of long&#8208;chain (150 nucleotide units) oligonucleotides.







Abstract
Controlled pore glass (CPG), differing in pore size and subsequent specific surface, was chemically modified by: (1)&#8197;increasing surface susceptibility for amine functionalization via reaction with oxirane&#8208;type (active) and alkyl/aryl&#8208;type (inactive towards amine compounds) silane pro&#8208;adhesive compounds, and (2)&#8197;immobilization of trimethylolpropane tris[poly(propylene glycol), amine terminated] ether, comb&#8208;like 8&#8208;arm octa[poly(ethylene glycol) amine] with each branch amine terminated, and a poly(propylene imine) amine&#8208;terminated second&#8208;generation dendrimer. The increase in surface density of amine functions &#8211; monitored by UV&#8208;Vis technique adopted for quantitative measurements of Ruhemann's purple intensity &#8211; improved final loading capacity, characterized by dimethoxytrityl cation absorption. Obtained materials proved their applicability in automatic oligonucleotide (ON) synthesis, especially when silanized 2000&#8197;&#197; CPG modified with 8&#8208;arm octa[poly(ethylene glycol) amine], with deduced empirical formula CPG &#8211; silane &#8211; (NH)6.4PEG&#8208;(NH2)1.6, was used for long&#8208;chain (150 nucleotides) ONs synthesis. This can be regarded as a good CPG support for this purpose. Moreover, hybrid supports with different porosity allowed the synthesis of shorter ONs with satisfactory yield and purity, monitored by RP&#8208;HPLC and MALDI&#8208;TOF. On the molecular level, two competitive mechanisms seem to influence the utility of the final hybrid support: spatial availability of active sites and the propensity of the functionalizer to bond with the CPG surface.

Main group catalysis at work. The C,N&#8208;chelated aryltellurenyl triflate [2&#8208;(tBuNCH)C6H4Te][OTf], a Lewis superacidic carbene analogue, effective activates the Si&#8722;H bonds in tertiary silanes R3SiH (R=Et, Ph, Si(SiMe3)3), which was utilized in main group redox catalysis using p&#8208;quinones, which were converted into (silylated) hydrochinones.







Abstract
The C,N&#8208;chelated aryltellurenyl triflate [2&#8208;(tBuNCH)C6H4Te][OTf] (1) activates the Si&#8722;H bonds in the tertiary silanes R3SiH via umpolung of H&#8722; to H+ to give rise to the iminium salts (tBuN(H)CH)C6H4TeSiR3][OTf] (2R, R=Et, Ph (elusive) and R=Si(CH3)3 isolated; OTf=O3SCF3) comprising Te&#8722;Si bonds, which are capable of generating silyl triflates, R3SiOTf, under attack of a second equivalent of 1. The unprecedented Si&#8722;H activation was utilized in main group redox catalysis using p&#8208;quinones, which were converted into (silylated) hydroquinones.

         <title>50 Years of Organoselenium Chemistry, Biochemistry and Reactivity: Mechanistic Understanding, Successful and Controversial Stories</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
From the stink to the stars! The reputation of organoselenium species changed drastically in the past fifty years. While at the beginning of their history they were notoriously famous for their toxicity and infernal smell, organoselenides are nowadays recognized for their fundamental role in redox biology and as green organocatalysts. While applications in pharmaceutical sciences are still lacking, safe&#8208;to&#8208;be&#8208;administered compounds exist and new venues for bioactive low molecular weight organoselenides are being explored. In this review, the pervasive chemistry of the element of the moon is discussed focusing on the pivotal role of organoselenium species in biology, catalysis and pharmacology, providing an historical perspective on different but intertwined fields.







Abstract
In 1973, two major discoveries changed the face of selenium chemistry: the identification of the first mammal selenoenzyme, glutathione peroxidase 1, and the discovery of the synthetic utility of the so&#8208;called selenoxide elimination. While the chemical mechanism behind the catalytic activity of glutathione peroxidases appears to be mostly unveiled, little is known about the mechanisms of other selenoproteins and, for some of them, even the function lies in the dark. In chemistry, the capacity of organoselenides of catalyzing hydrogen peroxide activation for the practical manipulation of organic functional groups has been largely explored, and some mechanistic details have been clearly elucidated. As a paradox, despite the long&#8208;standing experience in the field, the nature of the active oxidant in various reactions still remains matter of debate. While many successes characterize these fields, the pharmacological use of organoselenides still lacks any true application, and while some organoselenides were found to be non&#8208;toxic and safe to use, to date no therapeutically approved use was granted.

     alt="50 Years of Organoselenium Chemistry, Biochemistry and Reactivity: Mechanistic Understanding, Successful and Controversial Stories"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the stink to the stars! The reputation of organoselenium species changed drastically in the past fifty years. While at the beginning of their history they were notoriously famous for their toxicity and infernal smell, organoselenides are nowadays recognized for their fundamental role in redox biology and as green organocatalysts. While applications in pharmaceutical sciences are still lacking, safe-to-be-administered compounds exist and new venues for bioactive low molecular weight organoselenides are being explored. In this review, the pervasive chemistry of the element of the moon is discussed focusing on the pivotal role of organoselenium species in biology, catalysis and pharmacology, providing an historical perspective on different but intertwined fields.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1973, two major discoveries changed the face of selenium chemistry: the identification of the first mammal selenoenzyme, glutathione peroxidase 1, and the discovery of the synthetic utility of the so-called selenoxide elimination. While the chemical mechanism behind the catalytic activity of glutathione peroxidases appears to be mostly unveiled, little is known about the mechanisms of other selenoproteins and, for some of them, even the function lies in the dark. In chemistry, the capacity of organoselenides of catalyzing hydrogen peroxide activation for the practical manipulation of organic functional groups has been largely explored, and some mechanistic details have been clearly elucidated. As a paradox, despite the long-standing experience in the field, the nature of the active oxidant in various reactions still remains matter of debate. While many successes characterize these fields, the pharmacological use of organoselenides still lacks any true application, and while some organoselenides were found to be non-toxic and safe to use, to date no therapeutically approved use was granted. In this review, some fundamental and chronologically aligned topics spanning organoselenium biochemistry, chemistry and pharmacology are discussed, focusing on the current mechanistic picture describing their activity as either bioactive compounds or catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stable Cu (I) Complexes for Intracellular Cu&#8208;Catalyzed Azide Alkyne Cycloaddition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An original azole ligand scaffold has been used to create a Cu (I) trinuclear dimer, demonstrating air&#8208; and water&#8208;stability due to its linear molecular geometry around the metal center. The complex is characterized and shown to efficiently catalyze the CuAAC reaction in aqueous media at low loading, as well as on fixed cells.







Abstract
The copper&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) has heralded a new era of chemical biology and biomedicine. However, caveats of the CuAAC include formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and other copper&#8208;related toxicity. This limits utility in sensitive biological samples and matrices. Towards addressing these caveats, we synthesized and fully characterized two air and water stable trinuclear Cu(I) dimer complexes. The complexes were stable to oxidation in the presence of hydrogen peroxideand other chelators, which was reasoned to be due to the linear benzimidazole&#8208;Cu&#8208;benzimidazole geometry. Computational investigations of the catalytic cycle implicated two of the three coppers in the trimer complex as the active metal centers. The complexes were shown to catalyze the reaction at far below sub&#8208;toxic concentrations for intracellular click reactions to label triple negative breast cancer cells and compared to the current CuSO4&#8208;THPTA standard.

         <title>Metal&#8208;organic Framework&#160;(MOF)&#8208;Based Sensors for Mercury (Hg) Detection: Design Strategies and Recent Progress</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Monitoring mercury (Hg) is critical for environmental and public health. Metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;based sensors demonstrate the advantage of high sensitivity and rapid response. We summarize the advances of MOF sensors for Hg2+ detection from the perspective of MOF type and role in the sensors. First, we introduce three MOFs used in Hg sensors&#8212;UIO, ZIF, and MIL&#8212;that have demonstrated superior performance. Then, we discuss the specifics of MOF&#8208;based sensors for Hg2+ detection in terms of the recognition and signal elements. Currently, the recognition elements include T&#8208;rich aptamers, noble metal nanoparticles, central metal ions, and organic functional groups inherent to MOFs. Sensors with fluorescence and colorimetric signals are the two main types of optical MOF sensors used for Hg detection. Electrochemical sensors have also been fabricated, but these are less frequently reported, potentially due to the limited conductivity and cycling stability of MOFs. Notably, dual&#8208;signal sensors mitigate background signals interference and enhance the accuracy of Hg2+ detection. Furthermore, to facilitate portability and user&#8208;friendliness, portable devices such as microfluidics, paper&#8208;based devices, and smartphones have been developed for Hg2+ detection, showcasing potential applications. We also address the challenges related to MOF&#8208;based sensors for Hg2+ and future outlook.</dc:description>

         <title>Intersystem Crossing, Photo&#8208;Induced Charge Separation and Regioisomer&#8208;Specific Excited State Dynamics in Fully Rigid Spiro Rhodammine&#8208;Naphthalene/Anthraquinone Electron Donor&#8208;Acceptor Dyads</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We prepared a series fully rigid spiro electron donor&#8208;acceptor orthogonal dyads, with closed form of rhodamine (Rho) as electron donor and naphthalene (Np)/anthraquinone (AQ) as electron acceptor, to access the long&#8208;lived triplet charge separation (3CS) state, via the electron spin control method. We found strong dependency of the photophysical property of the dyads on the amino substitution positions of the Np chromophores in the dyads 1,8&#8208;DaNp&#8208;Rho and 2,3&#8208;DaNp&#8208;Rho. Nanosecond transient absorption (ns&#8208;TA) spectra show the population of the 3LE state (lifetime: 47 &#956;s) for 2,3&#8208;DaNp&#8208;Rho, however, long&#8208;lived 3CS state was observed (&#964;CS = 0.62 &#956;s) for AQ&#8208;Rho, with a CS quantum yield of &#934;CS = 58%. Based on femtosecond transient absorption (fs&#8208;TA) spectra, spin orbit charge transfer ISC (SOCT&#8208;ISC) is proposed to be responsible for the formation of the triplet states. Time&#8208;resolved electron paramagnetic resonance (TREPR) spectra of AQ&#8208;Rho indicate the presence of two states, a 3LE state with zero field splitting (ZFS) D parameter of 1400 MHz and E parameter of &#8208;410 MHz, formed via radical pair ISC (RP&#8208;ISC) and SOCT&#8208;ISC mechanism; and a 3CS state with the electron spin&#8208;spin interaction in the regime of spin&#8208;correlated radical pair (SCRP)</dc:description>

         <title>Regulating Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence of Organic Luminophores through Stepwise Stabilization by Coordination and In&#8208;Situ Precipitation Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing efficiency and long&#8208;lived room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials through straightforward methods is highly desired. In this work, a stepwise stabilization strategy was proposed by the coordination and in&#8208;situ precipitation reactions among organic precursors, inorganic cation and anions, producing room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence materials with high emission efficiency (phosphorescence quantum yield of 45%). Structural and photophysical characterizations revealed the coordination reaction reduced the energy gaps between singlet and triplet states and stabilized the excited states of the guest molecules. The in&#8208;situ precipitation reaction produced a solid matrix, which provided isolated environments for protecting the excitons from quenching. The applications of RTP materials in information encryption were demonstrated. The presented results provided a new clue for producing RTP materials, and extended their applications in wide fields.</dc:description>

         <title>Deep&#8208;Ultraviolet Transparent Nonlinear Optical Phosphates: A New Alternative to Conventional Borates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Deep ultraviolet (DUV) nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals with balanced performance are crucial for extending laser wavelengths into the DUV region, essential for various laser applications. However, developing ideal DUV crystals is challenging due to stringent requirements: strong second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) response, short cut&#8208;off wavelength, and effective phase&#8208;matching behavior. DUV NLO borates, which feature &#960;&#8208;conjugated groups, have garnered attention for their higher SHG coefficients compared to phosphates. However, phosphates typically show short UV cut&#8208;off edges due to the large HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap (approximately 9.6 eV) of the [PO&#8324;] units. To enhance the SHG effect while maintaining DUV transparency in phosphates, several strategies have been proposed: 1) using distorted polymerized P&#8722;O groups like isolated C&#8321;&#8208;[P&#8323;O&#8321;&#8320;]&#8309;&#8315; and [P&#8322;O&#8327;]&#8308;&#8315;; 2) aligning isolated [PO&#8324;]&#179;&#8315; tetrahedra along the polar screw axis; 3) introducing additional NLO&#8208;active units; and 4) exploring new units derived from [PO&#8324;]&#179;&#8315;, such as [PO&#8323;F]&#178;&#8315; tetrahedra. These strategies have led to the successful development of various non&#8208;centrosymmetric phosphates, highlighting their potential as DUV NLO candidates. This review explores the relationship between their crystal structures and DUV NLO performance, and proposes future directions for developing ideal DUV NLO materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Basic&#8208;functionalized Ionic Porous Organic Polymers: Triple Roles in One for Highly Efficient and Recyclable Carboxylative Cyclization of CO2 under Mild Conditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The transformation of carbon dioxide (CO2) into high&#8208;value chemicals is a significant step towards achieving the goal of "carbon neutrality". &#945;&#8208;methylene cyclic carbonate, as an intermediate for the synthesis of many important organic compounds, is widely employed in industrial productions. In this work, a series of ionic porous organic polymers (IPOPs) with different basic&#8208;functionalized anions were successfully synthesized and adjusted to have certain BET surface areas and high contents of ion sites by post&#8208;modification. These basic&#8208;functionalized IPOPs could exhibit excellent catalytic performance for carboxylative cyclization of CO2 at 30 oC and 1 bar in presence of silver salts, eliminating the use of extra organic bases. In the whole catalytic reaction, the basic&#8208;functionalized anions could play triple roles: enriching CO2 for further transformation, activating the hydroxyl groups of substrates to improve the catalytic performance, while coordinating with Ag atom to stabilize and regenerate catalyst. Notably, the catalytic system of DCX&#8208;4&#8208;Tet/Ag2O exhibited excellent recyclability, and the yield of &#945;&#8208;alkylidene cyclic carbonate was well maintained at 99% after 5 cycles. To the best of our knowledge, the catalytic system was the first example of basic&#8208;functionalized IPOPs that played multiple roles for highly efficient CO2 cyclization under mild conditions without any extra organic bases.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Engineering for High&#8208;Performance X&#8208;ray Scintillators</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
X&#8208;ray scintillators have recently garnered considerable attention due to their indispensable roles in radiation detection, safety inspection, therapy, and medical imaging. Herein, we summarize recent advances in the development of high&#8208;performance X&#8208;ray scintillators, focusing innovations driven by molecular engineering approaches.







Abstract
X&#8208;ray scintillators, materials that convert high&#8208;energy radiation into detectable light in the ultraviolet to visible spectrum, are widely used in industrial and medical applications. Organic and organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid systems have emerged as promising alternatives for X&#8208;ray detection and imaging due to their mechanical flexibility, lightweight, tunable excited states, and solution processability for large&#8208;scale fabrication. However, these systems often suffer from weak X&#8208;ray absorption and insufficient exciton utilization, which seriously affects their scintillation performance, limiting their potential for broader application and commercialization. This review highlights recent advances in molecular engineering for developing high&#8208;performance X&#8208;ray scintillators. It focuses on molecular design principles, such as the heavy atom effect, donor&#8208;acceptor/host&#8208;guest strategies, hydrogen/halogen bonding, molecular sensitization, and crystal packing, for enhancing scintillation performance. By leveraging these approaches, researchers have made significant strides in improving X&#8208;ray scintillation efficiency and advancing the potential of these materials for commercial applications.

         <title>Chiral Induction of a Tetrakis(porphyrin) in Various Chiral Solvents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Urethane&#8208;equipped tetrakis(porphyrin) is CD&#8208;active in many chiral solvents, which demonstrates the potential benefits of supramolecular interactions for developing chiral sensory systems.







Abstract
Non&#8208;covalent interactions offer an alternative way for developing stimulus&#8208;responsive materials such as sensors, machines, and drug&#8208;delivery systems. We recently reported that a urethane&#8208;equipped tetrakis(porphyrin) forms one&#8208;handed helical supramolecular polymers in solution in response to chirality of chiral solvents. Conformational changes in helical sense were detected using circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, which showed that the tetrakis(porphyrin) can possibly be used as a sensor for determining the enantiomeric excess of a chiral analyte. Hence, we studied the scope and limitations of the chiral&#8208;induction behavior of tetrakis(porphyrin) to deepen the understanding of tetrakis(porphyrin)&#8208;based chiral sensing systems. Herein, we report the chiral&#8208;induction behavior of tetrakis(porphyrin) in various chiral solvents, which was found to be CD&#8208;active in many chiral solvents. Notably, the tetrakis(porphyrin) was CD active in a cryptochiral molecular solvent, which is exciting because the chiralities of acyclic saturated hydrocarbons are hard to sense. Consequently, this study highlights the potential advantages of supramolecular chiral sensors capable of targeting a wide range of analytes, including molecules that are absorption&#8208;silent in the UV/vis region, ones devoid of anchoring functional groups, and acyclic, saturated hydrocarbons.

         <title>Neo&#8208;Glycolipid Oximes as Intestinal Permeation Enhancers for Peptide Hormone PYY3&#8208;36</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Permeation enhancers optimized. Peptide hormone PYY3&#8208;36 transport across epithelial cell monolayers was facilitated by neo&#8208;glycolipids, selected from a combination of panels of mono&#8208; and disaccharides (blue circle in figure) with lipids comprising different length and terminal charge (red circle in figure).







Abstract
Herein, we describe the design and synthesis of 16 neo&#8208;glycolipids that are potential permeation enhancers for oral drug delivery of peptide therapeutics. These amphiphilic neo&#8208;glycolipids are composed of fatty acids and various carbohydrates (d&#8208;glucose, lactose, cellobiose, maltose) via an oxime linker. The ability of the synthesized neo&#8208;glycolipids to enhance permeation of fluorescein&#8208;labelled dextran (4&#8197;kDa) or 3H&#8208;mannitol across intestinal epithelium was investigated in&#8197;vitro using monolayers of human epithelial Caco&#8208;2 cells. Their effects were compared with (pre&#8208;)clinically known enhancers as reference compounds; sodium salts of octanoic, decanoic, and dodecanoic acid, and sodium salcaprozate (SNAC). Most neo&#8208;glycolipids increased the permeation of the model compounds, proving that neo&#8208;glycolipids, which possess vastly different properties from the reference compounds, e.&#8201;g., in terms of clogD and polar surface area, are effective permeation enhancers. The neo&#8208;glycolipid based on decanoic acid and glucose was more potent than related compounds based on disaccharides. Significant differences in solubility and cellular compatibility were found for neo&#8208;glyolipids based on different carbohydrates. Finally, neo&#8208;glycolipids were evaluated as permeation enhancers for the peptide hormone PYY3&#8208;36. Glucose&#8208; and maltose&#8208;derived neo&#8208;glycolipids based on decanoic and dodecanoic acid showed promising enhancements in PYY3&#8208;36 permeation in&#8197;vitro while maintaining good cellular compatibility, relevant for oral delivery of obesity treatments.

         <title>Design and Evaluation of Azaspirocycles as RNA binders</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study describes efficient synthetic routes for the preparation of novel azaspirocycles. The resulting molecules exhibit unique three&#8208;dimensional structures with potential applications in drug discovery. The investigation of these compounds as RNA binders highlights promising activity as inhibitors of Tat/TAR interactions, presenting prospective therapeutic implications in HIV treatment and beyond.







Abstract
This study presents efficient synthetic pathways for preparing novel azaspirocycles. These methodologies involve functionalizing key bicyclic hydrazines with a substituent on one of their bridgehead carbon atoms. The desired spirocyclic cores were successfully obtained through double reductive amination reactions, intramolecular cyclizations, and cleavages of the N&#8722;N bond. The isolated molecules possess unique three&#8208;dimensional structures, suggesting potential applications in medicinal chemistry and drug discovery. With the growing interest in targeting nucleic acids as a complementary approach to protein&#8208;targeting strategies for developing novel active compounds, we investigated the potential of the synthesized azaspirocycles as RNA binders. As a proof of concept, we highlight the promising activity of some compounds as strong binders of HIV&#8208;1 TAR RNA and inhibitors of Tat/TAR interactions.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Triggered ROS&#8208;Responsive Supramolecular Nanoprodrugs for Targeted and Synergistic Chemo/Photodynamic/Gas Therapy</title>

Photo&#8208;triggered ROS&#8208;responsive supramolecular nanoprodrugs (BNN6@GBTC NPs) were constructed through the self&#8208;assembly of the amphiphilic prodrug molecule (GBTC) and NO donor (BNN6) in water for targeted and synergistic chemo/photodynamic/gas therapy.







Abstract
Photo&#8208;triggered ROS&#8208;responsive supramolecular nanoprodrugs (BNN6@GBTC NPs) are constructed via supramolecular self&#8208;assembly of amphiphilic prodrug molecule (GBTC) and NO donor (BNN6). BNN6@GBTC NPs possess good stability, ROS responsiveness, and selective HepG2 cells targetability via overexpressed galactose receptors on the cell membrane. When BNN6@GBTC NPs are taken up by HepG2 cells, they can generate ROS upon light irradiation, which can not only be used for photodynamic therapy, but also cleave the thioketal linkage to release camptothecin for chemotherapy. Meanwhile, BNN6 triggering release NO for gas therapy. BNN6@GBTC NPs enable targeted and synergistic chemo/photodynamic/gas therapy, which results in reduced damage to normal cells and enhanced anti&#8208;cancer efficacy in&#8197;vitro. This work provides a novel approach for the design of nanoprodrugs based on supramolecular self&#8208;assembly to achieve the multimodal synergistic anti&#8208;cancer therapy.

         <title>Distance&#8208;Dependent Symmetry&#8208;Breaking Charge Transfer in 9,10&#8208; Bis(phenylethynyl)anthracene Dimers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper investigates the role of through&#8208;bond coupling strength in modulating symmetry&#8208;breaking charge separation (SB&#8208;CS) dynamics within anthracene dimers of varying inter&#8208;chromophore distances. Utilizing both steady&#8208;state and transient spectroscopy, we uncover the significance of strong electronic coupling in facilitating SB&#8208;CS, particularly under weakly polar solvent conditions, with direct implications for enhancing photoelectric device performance.







Abstract
To investigate the effect of the through&#8208;bond coupling strength on the symmetry&#8208;breaking charge separation (SB&#8208;CS) dynamics and mechanism, three 9,10&#8208;bis((4&#8208;hexylphenyl)ethynyl)anthracene dimers with varying distances, viz., a single&#8208;bond linked dimer (0&#8208;dimer), a phenylene linked dimer (1&#8208;dimer) and a para&#8208;biphenylene linked dimer (2&#8208;dimer), were synthesized and studied systematically using steady&#8208;state and transient spectroscopy. Steady&#8208;state absorption spectra revealed that the electronic coupling strength decreased gradually with the increase of the inter&#8208;chromophore distance, and the transition of S0&#8594;S1 includes the dark charge transfer (CT) excitation. fs&#8208;TA spectra demonstrated that SB&#8208;CS could be conducted in both weakly and highly polar solvents for 0&#8208;dimer, but the SB&#8208;CS dynamics has a significant difference. In weakly polar solvents, SB&#8208;CS only produces the partial CT (PCT) state, but it could generate the CT state via the PCT state in highly polar solvent. In comparison, SB&#8208;CS is only proceeded in highly polar solvents in 1&#8208;dimer and 2&#8208;dimer to produce the CT state directly. These results demonstrate that the SB&#8208;CS dynamics is strongly dependent on the inter&#8208;chromophore electronic coupling, and the relatively strong electronic coupling is crucial for the occurrence of SB&#8208;CS in weakly polar environment that is commonly presented in photoelectric devices.

         <title>Diels&#8208;Alder Reactivity of Triisopropylsilyl Ethynyl Substituted Acenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Diels&#8208;Alder reaction of TIPS&#8208;Pen as diene with a number of different dienophiles was examined &#8211; the Diels&#8208;Alder reactivity of TIPS&#8208;Pen has not been investigated yet. The lateral size of the dienophile and the dispersion interaction between dienophile and diene are responsible for the unusual regioselectivity of cyclohexene&#8208;based dienophiles with TIPS&#8208;pentacene.







Abstract
We investigated the Diels&#8208;Alder reaction of 6,13&#8208;bis(triisopropylsilylethynyl)pentacene (1) with small dienophiles such as (bridged) dihydronaphthalenes/cyclohexenes that yielded adducts at the central ring, the other dienophiles predominantly or exclusively attacked the unsubstituted off&#8208;center ring. The difference in regioselectivity was investigated by DFT calculations. Apart from dispersion interactions, it is due to the steric demand of the dienophiles, which need to fit in between the silylethynyl substituents to react at the central ring. Epoxynaphthalene adducts of 1 as well as its anthracene and tetracene congeners were deoxygenated, easily furnishing triarenobarrelenes with TIPS&#8208;ethynyl substituents at the bridgeheads, attractive building blocks for porous solids and higher acene&#8208;based trimers.

         <title>Host&#8208;Guest Interactions Facilitated by Chalcogen Bonding within Selenadiazole Functionalised Porphyrin Nanotubes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel and robust porphyrin nanotube (PNT) has been generated by the combination of tetra(4&#8208;pyridyl)porphyrin, a selenadiazole carboxylate anion and Cd(II) centres. Solvent&#8208;filled regions within the PNTs can be evacuated, allowing the incorporation of a variety of guests. X&#8208;ray diffraction and solid&#8208;state NMR provide information relating to chalcogen bonding interactions between the host and appropriate guest solvent molecules.







Abstract
The structural rigidity of tetrakis(4&#8208;pyridyl)porphyrin (TPyP) has been utilised to prepare a robust novel porous coordination polymer of composition Cd2(TPyP)(sez)2 (TPyP=5,10,15,20&#8208;tetra(4&#8208;pyridyl)porphyrin, sez=1,2,5&#8208;benzoselenadiazole&#8208;5&#8208;carboxylate). The coordination polymer may be described as a hexagonal porphyrin nanotube (PNT) and has the potential to bind guest molecules through chalcogen bonding. Single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) data indicate an internal pore diameter ~9&#8197;&#197; which represents ~35&#8201;% of the crystal volume. Immersion of the PNTs in solvents such as DMSO and CS2 result in the incorporation of these molecules within the nanotubes with chalcogen bonding between host and guest. The crystallographic guest&#8208;inclusion investigations are complemented by solid&#8208;state 77Se, 13C, 113Cd and 2H&#8197;NMR studies which provide insights into dynamic behaviour. The porosity of the crystals was further explored using gas adsorption experiments, indicating the reversible uptake of CO2, CH4, H2 and N2. Structure&#8208;function relationships are clearly established from complementary crystallographic, NMR and adsorption investigations.

         <title>Photoinduced EDA Complex&#8208;Initiated Synthesis of Fluoroalkylated Isoquinolinonediones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Disclosed here is an EDA&#8208;complex&#8208;mediated radical tandem difluoroalkylation/cyclization for the construction of diverse CF2&#8208;containing isoquinolin&#8208;1,3(2H,4H)&#8208;diones under visible&#8208;light irradiation. This protocol features operational simplicity, sustainability (without any catalysts or oxidants), mild conditions, and broad substrate scopes in good&#8208;to&#8208;excellent yields, providing a novel environmentally friendly choice for the synthesis of isoquinolinonedione derivatives.







Abstract
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced radical tandem difluoroalkylation/cyclization to construct CF2&#8208;containing isoquinolinonedione skeletons with methacryloyl benzamides is developed. Broad substrate scopes are compatible with metal&#8208;, oxidant&#8208; and photocatalyst&#8208;free conditions under room temperature in good&#8208;to&#8208;excellent yields. Mechanistic analysis revealed that the transformation is initiated by photoinduced electron donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complexes formation.

         <title>Role of Active Centers in Predicting the Catalyst Turnover: A Theoretical Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we emphasized the role of active centres in predicting the efficiency for the [M(OTf)2(Me2Pytacn)] (M=Mn, Co, Ni) catalysts in the light of our two established models viz. efficiency conceptualization model (ECM) and maximum kinetic efficiency (MaxKinEff) model.

         <title>Meso&#8208;&#946; Monofused Porphyrins: Synthesis, Structural, Spectral, Electrochemical and DFT Studies and Their Efficient Third&#8208;Order Nonlinear Optical Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Three new series of &#946;&#8208;to&#8208;ortho&#8208;phenyl monofused porphyrins, denoted as MMFP(MN)X2 (where MFP = monofused porphyrin, MN = malononitrile and X = H or Br) and MMFP(MN)MB (where MB = mono benzo, M = 2H, Co(II), Cu(II) and Zn(II)) were designed and successfully synthesized. These compounds were&#160;characterized using various spectroscopic techniques and SCXRD analysis. Notably, three of the porphyrins&#160;crystallized&#160; in a triclinic crystal system with a P1&#773; space group. The twist angle values for these structures ranged from 14.03&#176; to 21.35&#176;. The meso&#8208;&#946; peripheral fusion and substituents led to tunable electronic spectral features across the synthesized porphyrins. The first reduction and oxidation potentials of all the investigated porphyrins exhibited significant anodically shift as compared to their parent tetraphenylporphyrins attributed to peripheral fusion and electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents, which collectively led to a reduced HOMO&#8210;LUMO gap. Ultrafast third&#8208;order nonlinear optical (NLO) studies revealed that these monofused porphyrins showed a strong two&#8208;photon absorption coefficient &#160;and effective cross&#8208;section ([[EQUATION]] = 0.03 &#8210; 8.05 &#215; 105 GM) values along with self&#8208;defocusing negative nonlinear refraction behaviour (n2 = (&#8210;) 0.5 &#8210; 5.28 &#215; 10&#8210;16 m2/W). These findings open new avenues for the application of meso&#8208;&#946; fused porphyrins in optical limiters, optical devices and other optoelectronic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Correlation Between NMR Coupling Constants and &#963;&#8208;Donating Properties of N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes and Their Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Is the 1JC&#8208;H coupling constant for protonated carbene a relevant measure of its &#963;&#8208;donation ability? This paper addresses this question by comparing calculated 1JC&#8208;H values with various experimental and theoretical approaches across a broad spectrum of carbene compounds. We examined Arduengo&#8208;type NHCs based on the 2&#8208;imidazolylidene scaffold and many other derivatives with modified frameworks, including carbenes with extended, saturated, or conjugated rings, reduced heteroatom stabilization, alternative heteroatoms, permanently charged carbenes, acyclic carbenes, amidocarbenes, and cyclic amino(alkyl/aryl) carbenes, carbodicarbenes and carbodiphosphoranes. Our findings reveal a nuanced relationship between different parameters associated with &#963;&#8208;interaction, such as 1JC&#8208;H, Huynh electronic parameter (HEP), &#963;&#8208;donation from ETS&#8208;NOCV, and lone pair energy. Notably, the best correlation was observed between 1JC&#8208;H and the ETS&#8208;NOCV method, particularly for mono&#8208; and diaminocarbenes, highlighting the utility of 1JC&#8208;H in comparing &#963;&#8208;donation among structurally similar carbene types. However, the use of 1JC&#8208;H as a universal measure across all carbene classes appears limited, especially when considering carbenes with significantly different structural frameworks. While HEP is less effective for carbenes with diverse structural backbones, our study suggests that 1JC&#8208;H has potential across a broader range of systems. Additionally, the analysis demonstrates that lone pair energy reflects basicity rather than &#963;&#8208;donor ability.</dc:description>

         <title>A Novel Methacryloyl&#8211;Masked NIR Fluorescent Probe for Detection of Cysteine and Its Application in Bioimaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cysteine (Cys) detection is recognized as an essential element in this investigation due to the critical function of Cys in several physiological processes in living organisms. A new NIR fluorescent probe SNC&#8211;Cys has been synthesized by incorporating a five&#8208;membered malononitrile derivatized ring as an electron withdrawing group, and a methacryloyl group detection moiety for cysteine. After adding Cys, SNC&#8211;Cys shows an emission of 654 nm and further works as a &#8220;Turn&#8211;on&#8221; probe via ICT photomechanism. SNC&#8211;Cys has high sensitivity and selectivity for Cys (LOD = 0.46 &#181;M) and can discriminate it from other closely related amino acids, molecules with structural similarity, and in some cases very close functional group likeness. Thus, these results allow the effective imaging of Cys in living A549 cells which indicates good cell permeability and high applicability in live cell imaging. This study anticipates that SNC&#8211;Cys could be an aid in the detection of Cys&#8211;relevant diseases.</dc:description>

         <title>Parts&#8208;per&#8208;million Level Loading Cyclometalated Ru(II)&#8722;NHC Catalyzed Selective Oxidation of Olefins to Carbonyls</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oxidative cleavage of olefins is a useful reaction in organic synthesis. The most well&#8208;known catalytic system is the osmium based Lemieux&#8211;Johnson catalyst, which generally requires high catalyst loading and tends to suffer from rapid overoxidation to produce the acid predominantly. Hence, the&#160;development of a mild, general, and selective method toward the oxidative cleavage of alkenes to carbonyl compounds is highly desired. In this work, a highly efficient ruthenium&#8208;based catalyst for olefin oxidation has been demonstrated by employing a fused &#960;&#8208;conjugated imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]quinoxaline (ImQx) based NHC ligand with bidentate C(carbanion)^CNHC motif. Strong C&#8208;donor ligands, paired with a rigid backbone and ruthenium redox activity, provided exceptionally high catalytic activity and a long lifetime for olefin oxidation. Complex showed high catalytic activity and a long lifetime, TONs are several million. The catalyst tolerates numerous functional groups and can be applicable to challenging biomass, natural products, sugar, amino acids, and fatty acid&#8208;derived substrates. Based on kinetic studies, thermodynamic activation parameters, and DFT study, the mechanistic finding demonstrated that [3+2] cycloaddition reaction is the key step in the oxidation process. The use of the&#160;by&#8208;product NaIO3 in the catalytic efficiency has been disclosed for the first time.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper Nanoclusters Imparted Metalloporphyrin Based Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Enhanced CO2 Electroreduction</title>

Cu nanoclusters have been successfully introduced into metalloporphyrin MOFs to prepare a series of hybrid catalysts (i.&#8201;e. Cu NCs@MOF&#8208;54&#8208;M, M=Fe, Co and Ni) that can be applied in electrocatalytic CO2RR for efficient CO production.







Abstract
Strategies that can introduce catalytic auxiliary into electrocatalysts to boost the performance of electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) are meaningful in exploring hybrid electrocatalytic systems. Here, a series of hybrid electrocatalysts (Cu NCs@MOF&#8208;545&#8208;M, M=Fe, Co and Ni) have been prepared by assembly Cu NCs with MOF&#8208;545&#8208;M (M=Fe, Co and Ni) and successfully applied in electrocatalytic CO2RR. In the obtained MOF&#8208;545&#8208;M (M=Fe, Co and Ni), the integration of Cu NCs with MOF&#8208;545&#8208;M (M=Fe, Co and Ni) can create a hybrid electrocatalytic system that enhances the charge transfer efficiency and electrocatalytic CO2RR activity. Specifically, the optimal Cu NCs@MOF&#8208;545&#8208;Co presents remarkable FECO over a wide potential range (&#8722;0.7&#8197;V to &#8722;1.0&#8197;V), high CO generation rate (8.2&#8197;mol&#8201;m&#8722;2&#8201;h&#8722;1) and excellent maximum energy efficiency (69&#8201;%, &#8722;0.7&#8197;V), which is superior to Cu NCs and MOF&#8208;545&#8208;Co, and represented to be one of the best performances to date. This work demonstrates a facile approach to significantly improve the FECO by loading metal nanoclusters into MOFs, providing a valuable reference for future studies on hybridization strategies to enhance the performance of electrocatalysts.

         <title>Cyclic Ruthenium(II)&#8722;Halocarbon Complexes Derived from Ru(II)&#8208;Induced Cyclization of Homopropargylic Halopyridines: Mechanism, Bonding and Reactivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclic metal&#8722;haloquinolizine complexes derived from the cyclization of homopropargylic halopyridines on Ru(II) and Os(II) centers display unusual metal&#8722;halocarbon bonding interactions and reactivity. Unprecedented &#954;2(X,C)&#8208;haloquinolizinium (X=F, Cl, and Br) ligated Ru(II) complexes were synthesized via Ru(II)&#8208;promoted rearrangement and cyclization of homopropargylic halopyridines. These cyclic Ru(II)&#8722;halocarbon complexes, featuring rare M&#8722;X&#8722;R bonding interactions, undergo nucleophilic aromatic substitution to yield quinolizinium&#8208;fused metallaoxazole complex. This work highlights the importance of metal&#8722;halocarbon bonding interactions in catalytic and coordination design.







Abstract
The activation of various homopropargylic pyridines by cis&#8208;[RuII/OsII(dppm)2Cl2] (dppm=1,1&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)methane) has previously been shown to generate a diverse array of metallacycles and metalated heterocyclic complexes. However, a minor structural modification of introducing a halide onto the pyridyl group of the alkyne substrate resulted in the formation of unprecedented Ru(II)/Os(II)&#8722;haloquinolizine complexes. These complexes display (1) &#954;2(X,C)&#8208;haloquinolizine chelates arising from the cycloisomerization of HC&#8801;CC(OH)(CH2(6&#8208;X&#8208;2&#8208;py))(Ph) on [RuII/OsII(dppm)2]2+ moieties via a vinylidene pathway, (2) five&#8208;membered Ru/Os&#8722;X&#8722;C&#8722;N&#8722;C rings (X=F, Cl, Br) ortho&#8208; and peri&#8208;fused to quinolizinium skeletons, and (3) uncommon M&#8722;X&#8722;R bonding interactions that are atypical in coordination complexes. Despite being divalent and integrated into a five&#8208;membered Ru&#8722;X&#8722;C&#8722;N&#8722;C ring system, the X atoms in the Ru(II) complexes are susceptible to substitution by O in the presence of &#8722;OH, resulting in the formation of quinolizinium&#8208;fused ruthenaoxazole complexes. Overall, this work highlights the importance of considering metal&#8722;halocarbon bonding interactions in catalytic or coordination designs.

         <title>Mechano&#8208;Responsive Fluorescent Gel based on Tetraphenylethylene&#8208;Crosslinked Dynamic Covalent Network</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
The rapid development of mechano&#8208;responsive fluorescence has been driven by its promising applications in the fields of sensors, information encryption, and anti&#8208;counterfeiting. However, designing mechanophores that can exhibit fluorescence changes under relatively low force remains challenging. In this study, a mechano&#8208;responsive fluorescent gel was developed using a tetraphenylethylene derivative as a cross&#8208;linker, producing a dynamic covalent network that exhibits increased fluorescence under tensile stress. Based on controlled experimental studies and molecular modeling calculations, the fluorescence enhancement by external forces was attributed to the restriction of intramolecular motion in tetraphenylethylene by macromolecular chain orientation. In time&#8208;dependent experiments, due to the exchange of dynamic covalent bonds, the stress relaxation and the decrease in fluorescence intensity of the gel at fixed strain occurred simultaneously, demonstrating the potential of this fluorescence as an indication of internal stress through aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) type mechanophore.

         <title>Anion&#8208;substituted Hybrid Zinc Halides with Remarkable Dielectric Switches</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermo&#8208;responsive dielectric switching hybrid halides, displaying reversible dielectric bistability, have recently made them highly versatile. Herein, by the strategy of substituting the X site in the general formula A2BX4, the low&#8208;dimensional [C6H5(CH2)4NH3]2ZnX4 (X=Br, I) hybrid halides exhibite remarkable dielectric bistability/switching characteristics with ultra&#8208;wide dielectric hysteresis loop of about 55&#8197;K near room temperature.







Abstract
Thermo&#8208;responsive dielectric switching hybrid halides, displaying reversible dielectric bistability, have recently made them highly versatile and attractive for their structural tunability and rich functional properties. However, the substantial improvement of the dielectric switching operating range is limited near room temperature, and obtaining ultra&#8208;wide dielectric switching temperature region is a major challenge. Herein, a remarkable dielectric switching effect is reported with ultra&#8208;wide dielectric switching temperature region in a hybrid halide system, caused by dipolar orientational polarization ascribing order&#8208;disorder phase transitions. The new A2BX4 hybrid halide [C6H5(CH2)4NH3]2ZnBr4 (4PBA&#8208;ZnBr4) with an ultra&#8208;wide dielectric hysteresis loop of about 55&#8197;K near room temperature is designed successfully through halogen substitution. Meanwhile, structurally similar hybrid materials 4PBA&#8208;ZnI4 were designed as controls. More interestingly, the crystal structure, phase transition temperature (Tc), dielectric and semiconductor properties exhibit significant discrepancies as the halogen atoms vary from Br to I. This discovery provides an efficiently regulated anionic framework to construct hybrid halides with ultra&#8208;wide high dielectric switching and reliable cycling stability by assembling with various cations, making them potentially excellent candidates for highly responsive room temperature smart switches or transducer devices.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of two coal&#8208;tar dyes, purple N&#8208;ethyl phenazinium (PHP) and malachite green (MGP), into the backbones of bis&#8208;monodentate ligands capable of forming lantern&#8208;shaped Pd2L4 coordination cages is shown. Cage Pd2(PHP)4 was used together with methylene blue cage Pd2(MBP)4 to differentiate between nucleoside triphosphates in solution through CD spectroscopy.







Abstract
Organic chromophores have been successfully implemented into supramolecular systems to bestow them with distinct photophysical properties for various applications, ranging from solar energy conversion, photochemical reactions or as receptors for guest molecules with optical readout. We had previously introduced first members of the large family of coal&#8208;tar dyes (methylene blue, crystal violet and rhodamine) as integral components of coordination cages. Here, we add two new chromophores, malachite green (MGP) and a purple phenazinium dye (PHP), serving as backbones of bis&#8208;monodentate banana&#8208;shaped ligands with pyridine donors. We show the formation of corresponding green and purple coloured Pd2L4 coordination cages and investigate their interaction with chiral guest molecules via UV&#8208;Vis and CD spectroscopy. The PHP cage can be used to recognize nucleoside triphosphates, based on chirality transfer from the guests to the structurally flexible helicate. In combination with the already known methylene blue cage MBP we could further differentiate between all four canonical NTPs through characteristic changes in the observed CD signatures.

         <title>Enzymatic Cleavage of Double&#8208;Stranded DNA&#8208;Encoded Libraries (DELs) to Single&#8208;Stranded DELs with Compounds at the 3&#8242; End: Its Application in Photo&#8208;Crosslinking Selection</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we developed a novel method for converting double&#8208;stranded DNA&#8208;encoded libraries (dsDELs) to single&#8208;stranded DELs (ssDELs) with compounds at the 3&#8217; end using cleavabledeoxyuridine. Moreover, such ssDELs are converted to dsDELs with the coding information covalently attached to photo&#8208;crosslinkers (dsDELs&#8208;PC). This approach enhances photo&#8208;crosslinking selection efficiency, maintaining high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise (S/N) ratios under stringent conditions.







Abstract
DNA&#8208;encoded library (DEL) technology is a crucial tool in pharmaceutical research, rapidly identifying compounds that bind to a target of interest from an extensive pool of compounds. In this study, we propose a new method for generating single&#8208;stranded DELs (ssDELs) with compounds at the 3&#8217; end. The introduction of uniquely designed hairpin&#8208;shaped headpieces containing deoxyuridine (NC&#8208;HP) and the use of a cleavage enzyme facilitate the conversion from double&#8208;stranded DELs (dsDELs) to such ssDELs. Moreover, Klenow fill&#8208;in provides the dsDELs with photo&#8208;crosslinkers covalently linked to the coding region, which exhibit durability even under stringent washing conditions and enable photo&#8208;crosslinking with a high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio, as also confirmed in cell&#8208;based photo&#8208;crosslinking selections.

         <title>Cleavage of a Peroxide Bond via a Dual Attack by Functional Mimics of Glutathione Peroxidase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we have reported the cleavage of a peroxide bond via a dual attack by synthetic model compounds similar to the nonmetal&#8208;containing peroxidase enzymes such as glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glyceraldehyde 3&#8208;phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), bacterial peroxide sensor protein OxyR (PaOxyR) and Populus trichocarpa GPX5 (PtGPX5).







Abstract
Nonmetal&#8208;containing peroxidase enzymes, including glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and peroxiredoxins, control cellular redox levels by catalyzing the reduction of H2O2. The remarkably higher reactivity of GPx enzyme as compared to the fully dissociated synthetic selenolate/thiolate molecule is probably due to the dual&#8208;attack on the peroxide bond (HO1&#8722;O2H) by the enzyme; The first one is a nucleophilic attack of the selenolate/thiolate moiety to O1 atom and the second attack at the O2 atom of the peroxide bond by the acidic &#8220;parked proton&#8221; from Trp or His residue present at the enzyme's active site, leading to the facile cleavage of O&#8722;O bond. Herein, we report two synthetic compounds (1 and 2), having a selenolate (Se&#8722;) and a proton donor (imidazolium or &#8722;COOH group) moieties, which showed excellent GPx&#8208;like activity via dual&#8208;attack on the peroxide bond. The combined effect of selenolate moiety that donates electrons to the antibonding (&#963;*) orbital of O1&#8722;O2 bond and the imidazolium or carboxylic acid moiety at the side chain that forms a strong H&#8208;bonding with the O2 atom facilitates O&#8722;O bond cleavage of H2O2 more efficiently. 1 and 2 exhibit remarkable ability in protecting Cu(I)&#8208;complex [TpmCu(CH3CN)]+ (9) against H2O2 by acting as a sacrificial antioxidant, thereby preventing metal&#8208;mediated ROS production.

         <title>Potassium Phosphate&#8208;Mediated Synthesis of C4&#8208;Phosphorylated Quinolines via Cascade Cycloisomerization of Ynones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents an efficient base&#8208;promoted cascade cycloisomerization of &#946;&#8208;(2&#8208;aminophenyl)&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;ynones with diphenylphosphine oxides, enabling straightforward synthesis of C4&#8208;phosphorylated quinolines under mild conditions. The method demonstrates broad substrate scope, high yields, and scalability. More importantly, a representative C4&#8208;phosphorylated quinoline exhibited potent inhibitory activity against Staphylococcus aureus, highlighting the potential antimicrobial applications of these novel compounds.







Abstract
A cascade phosphorylation cycloisomerization of readily accessible ynones and diphenylphosphine oxides facilitated by potassium phosphate is described, allowing for the straightforward synthesis of C4&#8208;phosphorylated quinoline scaffolds. The formation of a C&#8722;P bond and a C&#8722;N bond is achieved in a single procedure without the need for pre&#8208;assembled quinoline cores prior to phosphorylation. This transformation operates without the requirement for metals or oxidants and exhibits excellent compatibility with various functional groups. Furthermore, antimicrobial activity evaluation demonstrated that the synthesized C4&#8208;phosphorylated quinoline derivatives exhibited potent inhibitory activity against Staphylococcus aureus.

         <title>Overcoming the Challenges of Hyperpolarizing Substrates with Parahydrogen&#8208;Induced Polarization in an MRI System</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The parahydrogen&#8208;derived 13C hyperpolarization can be generated with high field polarization transfer sequences. We attempt to circumvent the need for a dedicated polarizer by using the MRI system to produce the substrate. We study the experimental conditions imposed by the MRI setup and mitigate these effects via simulations and experiments and reach hyperpolarization levels of 44.5&#8201;% of the 1&#8208;13C site of ethyl acetate&#8208;d6.







Abstract
Hyperpolarization of 13C nuclei in biomolecules and their administration as imaging agents enables in&#8208;vivo monitoring of metabolism. This approach has demonstrated potential for deriving imaging biomarkers for cancer detection, differentiation, and therapy efficacy assessment. The in&#8197;situ generation of polarized substrates using a permanent addition of parahydrogen to an unsaturated precursor inside the bore of an MRI system used for subsequent imaging circumvents the need for a dedicated external polarizer. This approach reduces polarization loss associated with sample transfer, minimizes hardware requirements and cost, and results in reduced spatial requirements. However, performing INEPT&#8208;like pulsed sequences for heteronuclear spin&#8208;order transfer in the bore of an MRI system is challenged by poor uniformity of static and excitation magnetic field and molecular convection during the polarization transfer. Therefore, here we characterize these effects, implement a robust modification to the pulse sequence, and measure experimentally the polarization improvement upon modification of the sequence. After rigorous optimization of the parameters, we obtained a 13C polarization of 44.5&#8201;% for 50&#8197;mM of the 1&#8208;13C site of ethyl acetate&#8208;d6. Our parahydrogen&#8208;induced polarization approach enhances the accessibility to hyperpolarized MRI, circumventing the need for an external polarizer.

&lt;p&gt;Hyperpolarization of &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C nuclei in biomolecules and their administration as imaging agents enables in-vivo monitoring of metabolism. This approach has demonstrated potential for deriving imaging biomarkers for cancer detection, differentiation, and therapy efficacy assessment. The in&#8197;situ generation of polarized substrates using a permanent addition of parahydrogen to an unsaturated precursor inside the bore of an MRI system used for subsequent imaging circumvents the need for a dedicated external polarizer. This approach reduces polarization loss associated with sample transfer, minimizes hardware requirements and cost, and results in reduced spatial requirements. However, performing INEPT-like pulsed sequences for heteronuclear spin-order transfer in the bore of an MRI system is challenged by poor uniformity of static and excitation magnetic field and molecular convection during the polarization transfer. Therefore, here we characterize these effects, implement a robust modification to the pulse sequence, and measure experimentally the polarization improvement upon modification of the sequence. After rigorous optimization of the parameters, we obtained a &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C polarization of 44.5&#8201;% for 50&#8197;mM of the 1-&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C site of ethyl acetate-d&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;. Our parahydrogen-induced polarization approach enhances the accessibility to hyperpolarized MRI, circumventing the need for an external polarizer.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Direct Experimental Characterization of a Sialyl Cation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, the sialyl cation, the intermediate of sialylation reactions, is experimentally characterized for the first time using messenger&#8208;tagging infrared spectroscopy. The results suggest that this intermediate is stabilized by remote participation of the C5&#8208;NHAc group, leading to the formation of a bicyclic structure. Here, the &#946;&#8208;side is shielded, potentially contributing to the &#945;&#8208;selectivity of various SN1&#8208;type sialylation reactions.







Abstract
Sialic acids are monosaccharide residues involved in several biological processes. Controlling the stereoselectivity of sialylation reactions is challenging and mechanistic studies on the structure of its intermediate, the sialyl cation, are scarce. Here it is shown that a sialyl cation can be generated and isolated from an ionized sialic acid precursor. This short&#8208;lived species is structurally characterized for the first time using cryogenic infrared spectroscopy. In combination with quantum chemical calculations, the results reveal that the positive charge at the anomeric carbon of the sialyl cation is stabilized by remote participation of the C5&#8208;NHAc group leading to the formation of a bridged structure. In this structure, the &#946;&#8208;side is shielded from nucleophilic attack, potentially explaining the &#945;&#8208;selectivity of this building block in SN1&#8208;type sialylation reactions. Other modes of participation are energetically unfavored and cannot be observed experimentally.

         <title>One&#8208;Electron NO to N2O Pathways via Heme Models and Lewis Acid: Metal Effects and Differences from the Enzymatic Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Compared to native nitric oxide reductases using a two&#8208;electron process, Fe and Co hemes, activated by BF3, were recently found to effect this reaction with one electron. Our mechanistic study revealed their complete reaction pathways and advantageous reactivity origins of Fe heme compared to Co and the native pathway.







Abstract
Some pathogens use heme&#8208;containing nitric oxide reductases (NORs) to reduce NO to N2O as their defense mechanism to detoxify NO and reduce nitrosative stress. This reduction is also significant in the global N cycle. Our previous experimental work showed that Fe and Co porphyrin NO complexes can couple with external NO to form N2O when activated by the Lewis acid BF3. A key difference from conventional two&#8208;electron enzymatic reaction is that one electron is sufficient. However, a complete understanding of the entire reaction pathways and the more favorable reactivity for Fe remains unknown. Here, we present a quantum chemical study to provide such information. Our results confirmed Fe's higher experimental reactivity, showing advantages in all steps of the reaction pathway: easier metal oxidation for NO reduction and N&#8722;O cleavage as well as a larger size to expedite the N/O coordination mode transition. The Co system, with a similar product energy as the enzyme, shows potential for further development in catalytic NO coupling. This work also offers the first evidence that this new one&#8208;electron NO reduction is both kinetically competitive and thermodynamically more favorable than the native pathway, supporting future initiatives in optimizing NO reduction agents in biology, environment, and industry.

         <dc:description>Supramolecular interaction between polymers has been utilized for constructing three&#8208;dimensional polymer structures with unique physical and chemical properties. In this study, we demonstrated a novel supramolecular miktoarm star&#8208;shaped copolymer with a cobalt(II) phthalocyanine (CoPc) core using metal&#8208;ligand coordination. Axial coordination of the terminal pyridyl group of poly(methyl methacrylate) to the CoPc core of 4&#8208;armed star&#8208;shaped polystyrene provided AB4&#8208; and A2B4&#8208;type&#160;&#181;&#8208;stars by stepwise complexation. The spin&#8208;coated polymer films from the mixed solutions of CoPcPS4&#160;and pyPMMA in a 1:1 or 1:2 mass ratio showed phase&#8208;separated nanodomains with smooth surfaces. Superamolecular interactions in polymer systems provide a unique topology for polymers and affect their bulk morphology.</dc:description>

         <title>Metalized Borylene in Boron&#8722;Gold Carbonyl Complexes: Infrared Spectra and Theoretical Calculations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Borylenes (:B&#8211;R), built on a single B&#8211;R bond between boron and another nonmetallic atom or group,&#160;are a heated subject of special interest due to their intriguing transition&#8208;metal&#8208;mimicking reactivity, but the relative lack of understanding for the electronic structure and chemical bonding of transition metal borides leads to lingering neglect of metalized borylenes (:B&#8211;M) based on covalent B&#8211;M bonding. Here we use infrared photodissociation spectroscopy in combination with density functional calculations to study the geometric structure and chemical bonding of boron&#8208;gold carbonyl complex cations. The structure and bonding analyses demonstrated that the BAu(CO)3+ and BAu2(CO)4+ complexes can be described as bis&#8208;carbonyl&#8208;trapped borylene adducts. While the metal&#8208;rich BAu3(CO)4+ complex represents an unusual multicenter&#8208;bond&#8208;stabilized borylene cation with excellent &#963;&#8208;acidity and &#960;&#8208;backbonding capability for CO activation, featuring Cs symmetry with a quasi&#8208;T&#8208;shaped BAu3+ core. It is manifested that BAu3+ presents greater amphoteric reactivity and improved stability compared to BAu1,2+ due to the presence of the three&#8208;center&#8208;two&#8208;electron Au&#8211;B&#8211;Au bond. This study discloses a conceptually new platform for accessing reactive metalized borylenes by exploiting the boron&#8208;mediated multicenter&#8208;bond stabilization strategy and using more bench&#8208;stable and ubiquitous metal carbonyl fragments as starting materials, thus providing a broader opportunity for the design of novel chemical structures and catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Translating Solid&#8208;Phase Conformational Memory in the Prophecy of Multi&#8208;stimuli Responsive Low Molecular Weight Gels</title>

         <dc:description>Polymorphism&#160;and its screening&#160;to select the best&#8208;performing form is in high demand. In low molecular weight organogels (LMWG), gelators are designed as they contain flexible groups, functionalities capable of varied H&#8208;bonding,&#160;and increased&#160;the potential to show polymorphism. We synthesized a bis&#8208;urea based LMWG&#160;G1&#160;and isolated three distinct polymorphic phases (Form I,&#160;II, and&#160;III).&#160;G1&#160;polymorphs showed&#160;noticeable differences in solubility;&#160;precisely, Form I is highly soluble compared to the other two. Gel screening was carried out for all three polymorphs using different stimuli like heat&#8208;cool, sonication, shaking, and grinding. Among the polymorphs,&#160;Form I&#160;was found to have better gelling ability which was reflected by the solvent scope, thermal stability (gel&#8208;sol transition temperature Tgel), minimum gelator concentration (M.G.C.), stimuli&#8208;responsiveness, morphology, and rheological properties. The differences in their gelation performance among the three polymorphs are associated with their solubility parameter. Stimuli like sonication, shaking, and grinding triggered&#160;Form I&#160;to form a gel. &#160;Form II&#160;and&#160;III&#160;responded to heat&#8208;cool stimuli only due to poor solubility. Therefore, it is noted crucial to add polymorph screening as an integral part of the gel synthesis to avoid problems associated with reproducibility in the gel prophecy of LMWG systems.</dc:description>

         <title>&#8203;Dual&#8208;Coreactants Enhanced Electrochemiluminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrochemiluminescence (ECL) of ruthenium(II) tris(2,2'&#8208;bipyridyl) (Ru(bpy)32+) with tri&#8208;n&#8208;propylamine (TPrA) as the good coreactant can be unexpectedly enhanced by a weak coreactant, such as triethanolamine (TEOA). First, the intensity of ECL emitted by Ru(bpy)32+/TPrA can be remarkably amplified by 10.8&#8208;fold after adding some amount of TEOA. Moreover, the ECL layer thickness, measured by self&#8208;interference spectroscopy, is also doubled. The enhancement far exceeding the superposition of respective contribution of TPrA and TEOA was elucidated by a &#8220;chemical oxidation mechanism&#8221;, in which TEOA+&#8226; acts as a chemical enhancer to oxidize TPrA in solution and to accelerate significantly the ECL reaction kinetics. This mechanism was proved by single&#8208;photon counting experiment and finite element simulations. In addition, the dual&#8208;coreactants strategy works well not only in solution with freely diffusive Ru(bpy)32+, but also on Ru(bpy)32+&#8208;functionalized microbeads, suggesting that ethanolamines could act as cheap, easily available and low&#8208;background enhancers for ECL&#8208;based bioanalysis and microscopy.</dc:description>

         <title>In&#8208;situ reduced Cu3N nanocrystals enable high&#8208;efficiency ammonia synthesis and zinc&#8208;nitrate batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) involves an 8&#8208;electron transfer process and competes with the hydrogen evolution reaction process, resulting in lower yields and Faraday efficiency (FE) in the process of NH3 synthesis. Especially, Cu&#8208;based catalysts (Cu0 and Cu+) have been investigated in the field of NO3RR due to the energy levels of d&#8208;orbital and the least unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) &#960;* of nitrate's orbital. Based on the above, we synthesized a Cu&#8208;based compound containing Cu3N (Cu+) through a simple one&#8208;step pyrolysis method, applied it to electrocatalytic NO3RR, and tested the performance of the Zn&#8208;NO3&#8722; battery. Through various characterization analyses, Cu&#8208;based catalysts (Cu+) are the key active sites in reduction reactions, making Cu3N a potential catalyst for ammonia synthesis. The research results indicate the application of Cu3N catalyst in NO3RR shows the best NH3 yield of 173.7 &#956;mol h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2, with FENH3 reaching 91.0% at &#8722;0.3 V vs. RHE, which is much higher than that of Cu catalyst without N. In addition, the Zn&#8208;NO3&#8722; battery based on Cu3N electrode also exhibits an NH3 yield of 39.8 &#956;mol h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2, 63.0% FENH3, and a power density of 2.7 mW cm&#8722;2, as well as stable cycling charge&#8208;discharge stability for 5 hours.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We report a general remote tribromo&#8208; and trichloromethylation process using CBr4 and CBrCl3 as ready available sources of trihalomethyl radicals. This method operates under mild and metal&#8208;free photocatalyzed conditions and enables the access to &#947;&#8208;trihalomethylated enals with complete regioselectivity in up to 71% isolated yield. Importantly, this protocol is easily adapted to the selective one&#8208;pot synthesis of the corresponding &#947;&#8208;dihalomethylidenated enals in up to 49% overall yield. Mechanistic studies are in favor of a radical chain propagation initiated by an oxidative quenching of the photocatalyst.</dc:description>

         <title>Magnetohydrodynamic Enhancement of Biofuel Cell Performance</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biofuel cells have become an interesting alternative for the design of sustainable energy conversion systems with multiple applications ranging from biosensing and bioelectronics to autonomously moving devices. However, as an electrochemical system, their performance is intimately related to mass transport conditions. In this work, the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) effect is studied as an easy and straightforward alternative to enhance the performance of a biofuel cell based on the enzymes glucose oxidase (GOx) and bilirubin oxidase (BOD). The synergetic effect between the electric and ionic currents, produced by the enzymatic redox reactions, and a magnetic field orthogonal to the surface of the electrodes, leads to the formation of localized magnetohydrodynamic vortexes. Such an integrated convective regime generates an increase of the bioelectrocatalytic current and its concomitant power output in the presence of the external magnetic field. In addition, by fine&#8208;tuning the spatial arrangement of the anode and cathode, it is possible to benefit from the sum of anodic and cathodic MHD vortexes, leading to an enhanced power output of up to 300%.</dc:description>

         <title>A Multistep Oxidative Cascade Reaction from a Naphthalenediol&#8208;Based pre&#8208;Ligand to a Tetranuclear Perylenequinone&#8208;Based FeIII Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have developed a family of dinuclear complexes using 2,7&#8208;disubstituted 1,8&#8208;naphthalenediol ligands that bind by molecular recognition to two neighboring phosphate diesters of the DNA backbone with the dinuclear CuII and NiII complexes exhibiting a severe cytotoxicity for human cancer cells. To increase the binding affinity, we intended to synthesize the corresponding dinuclear FeIII complex. Surprisingly, we obtained a tetranuclear FeIII perylene&#8208;based complex instead of the expected dinuclear FeIII naphthalene&#8208;based complex. In order to establish a rational and reproducible synthesis, we carefully analyzed this reaction. This revealed a multistep oxidative cascade reaction including the pre&#8208;coordination of FeII ions in the N3&#8208;binding pockets, the Lewis&#8208;acid assisted MOM&#8208;deprotection of the pre&#8208;ligand by the pre&#8208;oriented FeII ions, two oxidative aromatic C&#8208;C coupling reactions, oxidation of the perylene&#8208;based backbone and of FeII to FeIII. The careful analysis of bond lengths, HOMA indices (harmonic oscillation model of aromaticity), FTIR and UV&#8208;Vis&#8208;NIR spectra supported by DFT calculations reveals the presence of an aromatic 18&#8208;electron oxidized perylenequinone ligand backbone. In summary, a multistep cascade reaction involving in total a 10&#8208;electron oxidation has been established for the straight&#8208;forward synthesis of an unprecedented perylenequinone&#8208;based ligand system.</dc:description>

         <title>The Emissive and Electrochemical Properties of Hypervalent Pyridine&#8208;Dipyrrolide Bismuth ComplexesThe Emissive and Electrochemical Properties of Hypervalent Pyridine&#8208;Dipyrrolide Bismuth Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present a series of six hypervalent bismuth complexes Bi(R1PDPR2)X bearing ligands characterized by the pyridine&#8208;2,6&#8208;bis(pyrrolide) (PDP) structural motif. While bismuth holds considerable potential for facilitating efficient intersystem crossing (ISC), reports on phosphorescent molecular bismuth complexes are still scarce and mostly based on systems that exhibit inter&#8209; or intraligand charge transfer character of their optical excitations. Herein, the UV/vis absorptive, luminescent, and electrochemical properties of complexes Bi(R1PDPR2)X are explored, where the substituents R1 and R2, as well as the halide ligand X are varied. These compounds are characterized by an intense HOMO&#174;LUMO transition of mixed ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer (LMCT) and interligand charge transfer (LL&#8217;CT) character, as shown by time&#8208;dependent density functional theory (TD&#8208;DFT) calculations. At 77 K in a 2&#8208;MeTHF matrix, these compounds exhibit red, long&#8208;lived phosphorescence with lifetimes ranging from 671 to 20 &#181;s. Cyclic voltammetry measurements and TD&#8208;DFT calculations show that the substituents influence HOMO and LUMO energies to almost equal extent, resulting in nearly constant emission wavelengths throughout this series. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies of four of the six complexes exemplify the inherent Lewis acidity of the coordinated Bi3+ ion, in spite of its hypervalency.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal Pyrazolyl&#8208;diphosphonate Pillared Materials as Heterogeneous Catalysts in the Mukaiyama&#8208;type Aerobic Olefin Epoxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The structural variability and chemical stability of metal phosphonates under harsh conditions are attractive attributes that have drawn considerable attention in recent years. As the needs for more sustainable solutions rise, the demand for novel and tolerant materials also increases. Thus, herein we report, for the first time, the synthesis of a novel diphosphonic organic linker named pyrazole diphenyl phosphonate (PZDP), envisioning the fabrication of durable metal phosphonates. In view of this, a series of M&#8208;PZDP materials (M = Ca, Sr, Ba, Zn and Co) were synthesized employing either solvothermal or hydrothermal methods. The crystal structures of the Ca, Sr, Zn, and Co derivatives were determined revealing a 2D&#8208;pillared architecture. Zn&#8208;PZDP is an anionic framework with dimethylammonium cations. The Co&#8208;PZDP compound was tested as a heterogeneous catalyst in olefin epoxidation employing molecular oxygen.</dc:description>

         <title>Remarkable effect of stereoisomerism on the Am(III)/Ln(III) solvent extraction. New ligands for highly efficient separation of americium</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two novel 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline&#8208;2,9&#8208;diamide ligands were constructed based on 2&#8208;phenylpyrrolidine and obtained as pure diastereomers. These ligands demonstrated advanced properties in liquid&#8208;liquid extraction tests. They revealed high efficiency of americium(III) extraction alongside with the record values of selectivity in the separation of americium from light lanthanides from strongly acidic media. An abrupt increase of extraction efficiency when moving along the lanthanide series from lanthanum to lutetium was observed. The examination of the extraction behavior of pure diastereomeric forms revealed noticeable differences in their selectivity while maintaining the overall extraction trend. The explanation of the discovered patterns was elucidated by a comprehensive study of the ability of the ligands to bind lanthanide nitrates in solutions. All the data collected (UV&#8208;vis and NMR titration, X&#8208;ray analysis of resulting complexes, solvation numbers estimation) were supported by quantum chemical calculation. These data clearly indicated that in case of light lanthanides the formation of 1:1 complexes is most preferable. In the same time, complexes with heavy lanthanides, such as ytterbium and lutetium, exist as ionic pairs which may consist of [L2M]z+ cations counterbalanced by metallates anions, which may result in formation of unusual composition species L2M2 or even L4M5 clusters.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereodivergent Macrocyclization in Dynamic Chiral Confinement</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The absolute and relative configurations of a macrocyclic natural product bearing multiple chirality have a crucial influence on its physical and biological properties. Nevertheless, their preparation with full stereocontrol remains largely unexplored in synthetic community. Here, we show a stereodivergent macrocyclization under dynamic chiral confinement in which the stepwise chirality switching of a chiral space directs complete stereocontrol. To confine a substrate in a dynamic chiral space, we used a chiral capsule enclosing a substrate which is collectively switchable in the chirality in response to external stimuli, but their conformations are firmly fixed by subsequent self&#8208;assembly. The consecutive chirality switching enables the confined reactions of an enclosed achiral substrate to sequentially install diverse chirality on a macrocycle product with full stereocontrol in a single pot operation, thus changing only a sequence of physical stimuli enables access to a remarkable stereodivergence in a macrocyclization process.</dc:description>

         <title>Orthogonal Functionalization of Oxo&#8208;Graphene Nanoribbons</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oxo&#8208;graphene nanoribbons (oxo&#8208;GNRs) can be prepared by the oxidative unzipping of single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes. We present an orthogonal functionalization method for the functionalization of the rims and the &#960;&#8208;surface, respectively, what is only possible due to the high rim portion in oxo&#8208;GNRs. Thus, in particular X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy could be used to trace reaction to detect marker atoms included in addends. We propose that the reported orthogonal functionalization strategy can also be applied on other oxo&#8208;functionalized carbon materials, such as carbon dots, or reduced graphene oxide flakes.</dc:description>

         <title>Scalable Bulk Synthesis of Phase&#8208;Pure &#947;&#8208;Sn3N4 as a Model for an Argon&#8208;Flow&#8208;Mediated Metathesis Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nitrides represent a promising class of materials for a variety of applications. However, bulk synthesis remains a challenging task due to the stability of the N2 molecule. In this study, we introduce a simple and scalable approach for synthesizing nitride bulk materials. Moderate reaction temperatures are achieved by using reactive starting materials, slow and continuous mixing of the starting materials, and by dissipating heat generated during the reaction. The impact on the synthesis of using different starting materials as nitrogen source and the influence of a flux were examined. &#947;&#8208;Sn3N4 was selected as the model compound. The synthesis of pure &#947;&#8208;Sn3N4 bulk material on a large scale has still been a challenge, although a few synthesis methods were already described in the literature. Here we synthesized &#947;&#8208;Sn3N4 by metathesis reaction of argon&#8208;diluted SnCl4 with Li3N, Mg3N2 or Ca3N2 as nitrogen sources. Products were characterized by powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, scanning and transmission electron microscopy, energy&#8208;dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy, dynamic flash combustion analysis, hot gas extraction analysis, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray absorption and emission spectroscopy. Additionally, single&#8208;crystal diffraction data of &#947;&#8208;Sn3N4, previously unavailable, were successfully collected.</dc:description>

         <title>Nutation spectroscopy of a weakly interacting heterobimetallic spin system</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of VIV and CuII spins to design weakly coupled and dissymmetric spin systems has been examined. Such systems were synthesized using porphyrin&#8208;based complexes, with external coordination sites allowing for the formation of dimers via a PdII linker ion. Continuous&#8208;wave (CW) Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectroscopy allowed the unequivocal magnetic characterization of the mononuclear precursors V and Cu. The porphyrin dimer VPdCu presented a broad and overlapped spectrum that was more pronounced than for the previously reported VPdV, hinting at the effect of weak interspin interactions between dissimilar spins. Pulsed EPR experiments on V, VPdV and VPdCu samples diluted in a diamagnetic matrix confirmed that this complication is also present in the Field&#8208;Swept Echo&#8208;Detected (FSED) spectra of the heterometallic VPdCu system. Despite the strongly overlapped field&#8208;swept spectra, spin nutation experiments revealed two distinct oscillations in the case of VPdCu, which are assigned to transitions with different spin characters. Remarkably, coherence is retained above liquid nitrogen temperatures for all complexes, in particular up to 295 K for V and VPdV and 150 K for VPdCu.</dc:description>

         <title>CoFe Hydroxide Nanopheres for Enhanced Alkaline Splitting and Seawater Oxidation:Anion Doping Effects of Fluorine and Carbonate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Green hydrogen production can be achieved through electrolysis of fresh water or the use of renewable energy to electrolyze seawater. However, due to the low activity and poor stability of oxygen evolution reaction catalysts, direct electrolysis of alkaline seawater faces significant challenges. Herein, The catalyst F&#8208;CoFe(OH)&#8208;CO3/NF with three&#8208;dimensional nanosphere structure was prepared, The introduction of CO32&#8208; into the intermediate layer of&#160;CoFe Hydroxide&#160;improves the corrosion resistance of alkaline electrolyte and the doping of F&#8208; is to design three&#8208;dimensional layered nanostructures, increase the active site, and accelerate the diffusion of the electrolyte. By in situ Raman analysis, partial oxidation of CoFe hydroxide to CoFe (oxy)hydroxide as the active center can accelerating the adsorption of oxygen&#8208;related intermediates. In 1M KOH, it requires overpotentials of 210 mV and 251mV to drive current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm&#8208;2, respectively. And it remained stable at the current density of 100 mA cm&#8208;2 for 120 h in 1M KOH. &#160;F&#8208;CoFe(OH)&#8208;CO3/NF can also catalyzes the decomposition of electrolytic seawater. Compared with hydroxide, anion&#8208;doped carbonate hydroxide is more efficient and stable in electrolyte solution, which is of great importance for the development of a new stable electrocatalyst for water decomposition.</dc:description>

         <title>Towards Designer Photocatalysts: Structure&#8208;Property Relationships in 2,6&#8208;Diaryl&#8208;pyryliums</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fully organic photocatalyst systems are highly attractive, not merely because they are transition&#8208;metal free, but more importantly due to their unique and often potent reactivity. A detailed understanding of the various redox states, both ground and excited state, and specifically what structural parameters control them is therefore crucial for harnessing the full potential of these systems in organic synthesis. However, unlike their organometallic counterparts, detailed structure&#8208;property relationships for organic photocatalysts are largely absent from the literature. In this study, we demonstrate linear free&#8208;energy relationships across a range of key photophysical and electrochemical properties of 2,6&#8208;diarylpyryliums. Electronic absorption and emission maxima can be carefully tuned over the ranges of 83 nm and 102 nm respectively. Intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) interactions were revealed in cases of substitution with polarizable heavy&#8208;atoms. A strong linear dependence of ground state reduction potentials on substituent electronics was observed. Notably, the excited state reduction potential, E*red, could be controlled over a range of nearly 1000 mV. Systematic errors in computational modeling of ground and excited state redox potentials were identified and corrected. We believe the quantitative structure&#8208;property relationships identified here provide foundational tools for rational and predictive organic photocatalyst design.</dc:description>

         <title>Morphological Evolution of Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks into Hedrite, Sheaf and Spherulite Superstructures with Localized Different Coloration</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The branched metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are the first superstructures of this kind, and the growth mechanism may explain crystal shapes of other materials. The mechanism of the formation of fascinating structures having a hedrite, sheaf or spherulite appearance are detailed. The branching can be controlled, resulting in crystals that either exhibit multiple generations of branching or a single generation. These structures might result from an increasing number of defects on fast&#8208;grown rods. As the basal facets become less reactive, material is added to the prism facets, leading to secondary nucleation and triangular branches. These triangular structures are connected to the rod surface, growing longer than the central rod. Electron diffraction analyses show that the sheafs are polycrystalline structures with their fantails consisting of single&#8208;crystalline nanorods deviating gradually from each&#8208;other in their orientation. The crystallographic structure formed from achiral components consists of helical channels with opposite handedness. The accessibility of the nanochannels and the porosity of the superstructures are demonstrated by chromophore diffusion into the channels. The confinement and alignment of the chromophores inside the channels resulted in polarized&#8208;light dependent coloration of the crystals; the polycrystallinity generated areas having different optical properties.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Liquid&#8208;crystallization&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly (LCDSA) has recently emerged as an efficient strategy to create uniform one&#8208;dimensional (1&#8208;D), 2&#8208;D and 3&#8208;D nanostructures in a controlled manner. However, the examples of generation of uniform multi&#8208;morphology nanostructures from solution self&#8208;assembly of one single polymer sample are rare. Herein, we report the first example of preparation of multi&#8208;morphology fried&#8208;egg&#8208;like nanostructures consisting of an inner spherical/bowl&#8208;like core of uniform size and platelets protruded from the core by LCDSA of PAMAM&#8208;Azo6 (PAMAM = polyamidoamine, Azo = azobenzene) in methanol. It is disclosed that the different aggregation rates for PAMAM&#8208;Azo6 with varying contents of Azo units spontaneously separated nucleation and growth stages, which led to the formation of inner spherical/bowl&#8208;like cores (&#8220;seeds&#8221;) firstly, followed by the formation of platelets protruded from the edges of inner core to give &#8220;imperfect&#8221; fried&#8208;egg&#8208;like nanostructures. Additional annealing of initially formed &#8220;imperfect&#8221; fried&#8208;egg&#8208;like micelles will promote the rearrangement of Azo units to give thermodynamically&#8208;favored &#8220;perfect&#8221; fried&#8208;egg&#8208;shaped micelles with a uniform dimension both in the core and whole structure. This work not only provides an efficient strategy to create uniform multi&#8208;morphology fried&#8208;egg&#8208;shaped nanostructures, but also reveals the essential impact of aggregation kinetics of liquid&#8208;crystalline&#8208;coil BCPs in the formation of multi&#8208;morphology nanostructures.</dc:description>

         <title>Functionalization of Emulsion Interfaces: Surface Chemistry made Liquid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Disperse systems, and emulsions in particular, are currently massively used in fields as varied as food industry, cosmetics, health care and environmentally&#8208;friendly materials. To meet increasingly precise needs or targeted applications, these systems need to be endowed with new functionalities at their interfaces, in addition to their composition and structural properties. However, due to the fragility of drops and the low reactivity of their surface, conventional solid surface chemistry cannot be used for such a purpose. Several specific emulsion interface functionalization techniques have thus been developed for targeted systems and applications, but a general framework has yet to be drawn. In this review, we attempt to present these methods in a unified way through the prism of what we may call &#8220;liquid surface chemistry&#8221;. We propose to categorize existing methods into drop&#8208;coating strategies, including layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer techniques and polymer coating, and emulsifier&#8208;carrier approaches involving particles and/or amphiphilic molecules. They are discussed in a transversal way, highlighting the underlying physico&#8208;chemical principles and providing a comparative analysis of their advantages, current limitations and potential for improvement. We also propose future directions and opportunities, involving for instance DNA&#8208;based programmability or artificial intelligence, which could make liquid surface chemistry more versatile and controlled.</dc:description>

         <title>Changes in Secondary Structure upon Pr to Pfr Transition in Cyanobacterial Phytochrome Cph1 detected by DNP NMR</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phytochromes perceive subtle changes in the light environment and convert them into biological signals by photoconversion between the red&#8208;light absorbing (Pr) and the far&#8208;red&#8208;absorbing (Pfr) states. In the primitive bacteriophytochromes this includes refolding of a tongue&#8208;like hairpin loop close to the chromophore, one strand of an antiparallel&#160;b&#8208;sheet&#160;being replaced by&#160;&#945;&#8208;helix. However,&#160;the strand sequence in the&#160;cyanobacterial phytochrome Cph1&#160;is different from that of previously investigated bacteriophytochromes and has a higher&#160;b&#8208;sheet&#160;propensity. We&#160;confirm here the transition experimentally and estimate minimum helix length using&#160;dynamic nuclear polarisation (DNP) magic angle spinning NMR. Sample conditions were optimized for protein DNP NMR studies at high field, yielding Boltzmann enhancements&#160;eB&#160;of 19 at an NMR field of 18.801 T. Selective labelling of Trp, Ile, Arg, and Val residues with&#160;13C and&#160;15N enabled&#160;filtering for pairs of labelled amino acids by the 3D CANCOCA technique to identify signals of the motif&#160;483Ile&#8208;Val&#8208;Arg485&#160;(IVR) present in both sheet and helix. Those signals were assigned for the Pfr state of the protein. Based on the chemical shift pattern, we confirm for Cph1 the formation of a helix covering the IVR motif.</dc:description>

         <title>Evolution Enhances Kemp Eliminase Activity by Optimizing Oxyanion Stabilization and Conformational Flexibility</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The base&#8208;promoted Kemp elimination reaction has been used as a model system for enzyme design. Among the multiple computationally designed and evolved Kemp eliminases generated along the years, the HG3&#8208;to&#8208;HG3.17 evolutionary trajectory is particularly interesting due to the high catalytic efficiency of HG3.17 and the debated role of glutamine 50 (Gln50) as potential oxyanion stabilizer. This study aims to elucidate the structural and dynamic changes along the evolutionary pathway from HG3 to HG3.17 that contribute to improved catalytic efficiency. In particular, we evaluate key variants along the HG3 evolutionary trajectory via molecular dynamics simulations coupled to non&#8208;covalent interactions and water analysis. Our computational study indicates that HG3.17 can adopt a catalytically competent conformation promoted by a water&#8208;mediated network of non&#8208;covalent interactions, in which aspartate 124 is properly positioned for proton abstraction and both glutamine 50 and mutation cysteine 84 contribute to oxyanion stabilization. We find that HG3.17 exhibits a rather high flexibility of Gln50, which is regulated by the conformation adopted by the active site residue Trp44. This interplay between Gln50 and Trp44 positioning induced by distal active site mutations affects the water&#8208;mediated network of non&#8208;covalent interactions, Gln50 preorganization, and water content of the active site pocket.</dc:description>

         <title>Site&#8208;selectively Phosphorylated Hsp90 C&#8208;terminal Domain Variants Provide Access to Deciphering the Chaperone Code.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The ubiquitous molecular chaperone Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) is pivotal in many cellular processes through folding of client proteins under stressed and normal conditions. Despite intensive research on its function as a chaperone, the influence of posttranslational modifications on Hsp90 (the &#8216;chaperone code&#8217;), and its interactions with co&#8208;chaperones and client proteins, still remains to be elucidated. The C&#8208;terminal domain (CTD) of Hsp90 is essential for formation of the active homodimer state of Hsp90 and contains recognition sites for co&#8208;chaperones and client proteins. Here we used expressed protein selenoester ligation to introduce site&#8208;selective phosphorylations in the Hsp90 CTD, while preserving the native amino acid sequence. The two phosphorylations do not affect the overall secondary structure, but in combination, slightly decrease the thermal stability of the CTD. The Hsp90 CTD functions as a chaperone in decreasing aggregation of model client proteins, but the C&#8208;terminal phosphorylations do not significantly alter the anti&#8208;aggregation activity for these clients. The optimization of expressed protein selenoester ligation to carry out several steps in one pot provides an efficient route to access site&#8208;specifically modified Hsp90 CTD variants, allowing the generation of Hsp90 variants with site&#8208;specific PTMs to decipher the chaperone code.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Photophysical Properties of 4&#8217;&#8208;5&#8217; Disubstituted CinNapht Dyes Accessible through Double SNAr Late&#8208;Stage Functionalization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This article describes the synthesis of a difluorinated CinNapht derivative in the 4' and 5' positions allowing the easy access to two new families of fluorophores by late&#8208;stage functionalization using SNAr. The first one comprises derivatives incorporating hindered aromatic amines in the 4' and 5' positions, which show redemission in apolar solvents. The second one is obtained through the use of dinucleophiles. Among them, Tetrahydroquinoxaline (THQ) and tetrahydrobenzodiazepine (THB) compounds show strongly redshifted emission. The photophysical properties of all the fluorophores in these two families are studied and rationalized by DFT and TDDFT calculations. The most promising compounds have been used to image living cells by confocal microscopy.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis, Structures and Air&#8208;stable N&#8208;type Organic Field&#8208;effect Transistor (OFET) Properties of&#160;Functionalized&#8208;phenanthrene Conjugated Asymmetric N&#8208;heteroacenes</title>

         <dc:description>The development of stable high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type organic semiconductors for applications in organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs) under ambient conditions is desirable but challenging. To address this issue, we here synthesized a series of functionalized&#8208;phenanthrene conjugated asymmetric N&#8208;heteroacenes, where the phenanthrene moiety was modified by N substitution or Br functionalization at different positions to induce various degrees of asymmetry in their structures. The photophysical and electrochemical properties of these molecules were studied, and their packing patterns were analysed. The OFETs based on these materials were fabricated through simple spin&#8208;coating method, and the as&#8208;resulted thin films were treated with different conditions. The devices exhibit typical n&#8208;type performances under ambient conditions with charge carrier mobilities up to 4.27 &#215; 10&#8208;3 cm2&#160;V&#8208;1&#160;s&#8208;1. The crystallinities and morphologies of these thin films were studied to investigate the correlations between the device performances and thin&#8208;film characteristics. Our study suggests that phenanthrene conjugated N&#8208;heteroacenes can be developed as promising air&#8208;stable solution&#8208;processable n&#8208;type semiconducting materials, and Br modification at certain positions of phenanthrene is beneficial in adjusting the thin&#8208;film properties for the improvement of OFET performances.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The development of stable high-performance n-type organic semiconductors for applications in organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) under ambient conditions is desirable but challenging. To address this issue, we here synthesized a series of functionalized-phenanthrene conjugated asymmetric N-heteroacenes, where the phenanthrene moiety was modified by N substitution or Br functionalization at different positions to induce various degrees of asymmetry in their structures. The photophysical and electrochemical properties of these molecules were studied, and their packing patterns were analysed. The OFETs based on these materials were fabricated through simple spin-coating method, and the as-resulted thin films were treated with different conditions. The devices exhibit typical n-type performances under ambient conditions with charge carrier mobilities up to 4.27 &#215; 10-3 cm2&#160;V-1&#160;s-1. The crystallinities and morphologies of these thin films were studied to investigate the correlations between the device performances and thin-film characteristics. Our study suggests that phenanthrene conjugated N-heteroacenes can be developed as promising air-stable solution-processable n-type semiconducting materials, and Br modification at certain positions of phenanthrene is beneficial in adjusting the thin-film properties for the improvement of OFET performances.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
