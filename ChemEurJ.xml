         <title>Synthetic antibody&#8208;rhamnose cluster conjugates show potent complement&#8208;dependent cell killing by recruiting natural antibodies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are one of the most rapidly growing drug classes used for the treatment of cancer, infectious and autoimmune diseases. Complement&#8208;dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) is one of the effector functions for antibodies to deplete target cells. We report here an efficient chemoenzymatic synthesis of structurally well&#8208;defined conjugates of a monoclonal antibody with a rhamnose&#8208; and an &#945;Gal trisaccharide&#8208;cluster to recruit natural anti&#8208;rhamnose and anti&#8208;&#945;Gal antibodies, respectively, to enhance the CDC&#8208;dependent targeted cell killing. The synthesis was achieved by using a modular antibody Fc&#8208;glycan remodeling method that includes site&#8208;specific chemoenzymatic Fc&#8208;glycan functionalization and subsequent click conjugation of synthetic rhamnose&#8208; and &#945;Gal trisaccharide&#8208;cluster to provide the respective homogeneous antibody conjugates. Cell&#8208;based assays indicated that the antibody&#8208;rhamnose cluster conjugates could mediate potent CDC activity for targeted cancer cell killing and showed much more potent efficacy than the antibody&#8208;&#945;Gal trisaccharide cluster conjugates for CDC effects.</dc:description>

         <title>Tribo&#8208;excited Chemical Reaction Using EuIII Complex with Stacked Anthracene Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A spin&#8208;selective tribo&#8208;chemical reaction using a dinuclear lanthanide complex is demonstrated for the first time. The dinuclear complex is composed of two Eu  III  ions, hexafluoroacetylacetonato ligands, and anthracene&#8208;based phosphine oxide bridges. Single crystal analysis revealed a face&#8208;to&#8208;face type anthracene dimer structure in the dinuclear Eu  III  complex. Mechanical stimulus on the dinuclear Eu  III  complex induced selective formation of oxidized anthracene. The tribo&#8208;chemical reaction is based on a characteristic energy transfer pathway for the selective formation of an excited triplet state.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereochemical Behavior of Pairs of P&#8208;stereogenic Phosphanyl Groups at the Dimethylxanthene Backbone</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The P&#8208;stereogenic bis(phosphanes) 7 and 9, featuring pairs of P(Mes)&#8208;ethynyl or vinyl substituents at the dimethyl xanthene backbone show rather low barriers of stereochemical inversion at phosphorus. &#960;&#8208;conjugative effects are probably causing these low inversion barriers. Compound 7 reacted with B(C6F5)3 to form the nine&#8208;membered heterocyclic product 10, featuring a [P]&#8208;C&#8801;C&#8208;B(C6F5)3 substituent. Compound 7 was converted to the bis[P(Mes)vinyl] xanthene derivative 9, which gave the zwitterionic P(H)(Mes)&#8208;CH=CH&#8208;B(C6F5)3 containing product 16 upon treatment with B(C6F5)3. Thermally induced epimerization barriers at phosphorus of ca. 20 to 26 kcal mol&#8208;1 were calculated by DFT for the alkenyl&#8208;and alkynyl&#8208;P derived systems 6 to 9, 15 and 16 and experimentally determined for the examples 7 and 16.</dc:description>

         <title>TADF&#8208;Sensitized Fluorescent Enantiomers: A New Strategy for High&#8208;Efficiency Circularly Polarized Electroluminescence**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 7, February 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF)&#8208;sensitized CPL (TSCP) is proposed to realize efficient circularly polarized electroluminescence (CPEL) by taking TADF molecule as sensitizer to improve exciton utilization and CP&#8208;FL molecule as emitter to realize CPEL. In this article, we highlight the research status of CPEL and CP&#8208;TADF, mainly focus on the concept of TSCP and its applications in CP&#8208;OLEDs, and finally give the prospects of TSCP in CPEL research area.







Abstract
A promising strategy of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) sensitized circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) has been proposed for improving the electroluminescence efficiencies of circularly polarized fluorescent emitters. Compared with chiral TADF emitters which suffer from the dilemma of small &#916;EST accompanied by small kr, the TADF&#8208;sensitized CPL (TSCP) strategy using TADF molecules as sensitizers and CP&#8208;FL molecules as emitters might be the most promising method to construct high&#8208;performance circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (CP&#8208;OLEDs). Consequently, by taking advantage of the theoretically 100&#8201;% exciton utilization of TADF sensitizers, especially, by designing CP&#8208;FL emitters with high PLQY, narrow FWHM and large glum values, TSCP&#8208;type CP&#8208;OLEDs with excellent overall performances can be realized.

         <title>A Stereoselective Glycosylation Approach to the Construction of 1,2&#8208;trans&#8208;&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;Glycosidic Linkages and Convergent Synthesis of Saponins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 7, February 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Direct action: A highly stereoselective glycosylation protocol for the synthesis of 1,2&#8208;trans&#8208;&#946;&#8208;d&#8208; or &#945;&#8208;l&#8208;glycosidic linkages is disclosed, which employs a combination of glycosyl N&#8208;phenyltrifluroacetimidates as donors, FeCl3 as promoter, and CH2Cl2/nitrile as solvent and exploits glycosidation via glycosyl &#945;&#8208;nitrilium intermediates. A variety of natural saponins containing (1&#8594;2)&#8208;linked glycan motifs are thus synthesized in convergent manner by direct glycosylation with (1&#8594;2)&#8208;linked glycan donors.







Abstract
Conventional syntheses of 1,2&#8208;trans&#8208;&#946;&#8208;d&#8208; or &#945;&#8208;l&#8208;glycosidic linkages rely mainly on neighboring group participation in the glycosylation reactions. The requirement for a neighboring participation group (NPG) excludes direct glycosylation with (1&#8594;2)&#8208;linked glycan donors, thus only allowing stepwise assembly of glycans and glycoconjugates containing this type of common motif. Here, a robust glycosylation protocol for the synthesis of 1,2&#8208;trans&#8208;&#946;&#8208;d&#8208; or &#945;&#8208;l&#8208;glycosidic linkages without resorting to NPG is disclosed; it employs an optimal combination of glycosyl N&#8208;phenyltrifluroacetimidates as donors, FeCl3 as promoter, and CH2Cl2/nitrile as solvent. A broad substrate scope has been demonstrated by glycosylations with 12 (1&#8594;2)&#8208;linked di&#8208; and trisaccharide donors and 13 alcoholic acceptors including eight complex triterpene derivatives. Most of the glycosylation reactions are high yielding and exclusively 1,2&#8208;trans selective. Ten representative, naturally occurring triterpene saponins were thus synthesized in a convergent manner after deprotection of the coupled glycosides. Intensive mechanistic studies indicated that this glycosylation proceeds by SN2&#8208;type substitution of the glycosyl &#945;&#8208;nitrilium intermediates. Importantly, FeCl3 dissociates and coordinates with nitrile into [Fe(RCN)nCl2]+ and [FeCl4]&#8722;, and the ferric cationic species coordinates with the alcoholic acceptor to provide a protic species that activates the imidate, meanwhile the poor nucleophilicity of [FeCl4]&#8722; ensures an uninterruptive role for the glycosidation.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Direct action&lt;/b&gt;: A highly stereoselective glycosylation protocol for the synthesis of 1,2-&lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-&#946;-&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;- or &#945;-&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;-glycosidic linkages is disclosed, which employs a combination of glycosyl &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-phenyltrifluroacetimidates as donors, FeCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; as promoter, and CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/nitrile as solvent and exploits glycosidation via glycosyl &#945;-nitrilium intermediates. A variety of natural saponins containing (1&#8594;2)-linked glycan motifs are thus synthesized in convergent manner by direct glycosylation with (1&#8594;2)-linked glycan donors.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conventional syntheses of 1,2-&lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-&#946;-&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;- or &#945;-&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;-glycosidic linkages rely mainly on neighboring group participation in the glycosylation reactions. The requirement for a neighboring participation group (NPG) excludes direct glycosylation with (1&#8594;2)-linked glycan donors, thus only allowing stepwise assembly of glycans and glycoconjugates containing this type of common motif. Here, a robust glycosylation protocol for the synthesis of 1,2-&lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-&#946;-&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;- or &#945;-&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;-glycosidic linkages without resorting to NPG is disclosed; it employs an optimal combination of glycosyl &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-phenyltrifluroacetimidates as donors, FeCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; as promoter, and CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/nitrile as solvent. A broad substrate scope has been demonstrated by glycosylations with 12 (1&#8594;2)-linked di- and trisaccharide donors and 13 alcoholic acceptors including eight complex triterpene derivatives. Most of the glycosylation reactions are high yielding and exclusively 1,2-&lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt; selective. Ten representative, naturally occurring triterpene saponins were thus synthesized in a convergent manner after deprotection of the coupled glycosides.

         <title>Origin of the different reactivity of the high&#8208;valent coinage&#8208;metal complexes [RCuiiiMe3]&#8722; and [RAgiiiMe3]&#8722; (R=allyl)**

Gas&#8208;phase fragmentation experiments reveal a contrasting reactivity of the high&#8208;valent coinage&#8208;metal complexes [RCuiiiMe3]&#8722; and [RAgiiiMe3]&#8722; (R=allyl). Using DFT, coupled&#8208;cluster and multi&#8208;configurational calculations together with kinetic modeling, the reactivity difference is traced back to different C&#8722;C coupling propensities of the two complexes. For [RAgMe3]&#8722;, an outer&#8208;sphere cross&#8208;coupling transition state featuring a large multi&#8208;configurational character plays a key role for the understanding of its reactivity.







Abstract
High&#8208;valent tetraalkylcuprates(iii) and &#8208;argentates(iii) are key intermediates of copper&#8208; and silver&#8208;mediated C&#8722;C coupling reactions. Here, we investigate the previously reported contrasting reactivity of [RMiiiMe3]&#8722; complexes (M=Cu, Ag and R=allyl) with energy&#8208;dependent collision&#8208;induced dissociation experiments, advanced quantum&#8208;chemical calculations and kinetic computations. The gas&#8208;phase fragmentation experiments confirmed the preferred formation of the [RCuMe]&#8722; anion upon collisional activation of the cuprate(iii) species, consistent with a homo&#8208;coupling reaction, whereas the silver analogue primarily yielded [AgMe2]&#8722;, consistent with a cross&#8208;coupling reaction. For both complexes, density functional theory calculations identified one mechanism for homo coupling and four different ones for cross coupling. Of these pathways, an unprecedented concerted outer&#8208;sphere cross coupling is of particular interest, because it can explain the formation of [AgMe2]&#8722; from the argentate(iii) species. Remarkably, the different C&#8722;C coupling propensities of the two [RMiiiMe3]&#8722; complexes become only apparent when properly accounting for the multi&#8208;configurational character of the wave function for the key transition state of [RAgMe3]&#8722;. Backed by the obtained detailed mechanistic insight for the gas&#8208;phase reactions, we propose that the previously observed cross&#8208;coupling reaction of the silver complex in solution proceeds via the outer&#8208;sphere mechanism.

         <title>Coexistence of Tellurium Cations and Anions in Phosphonium&#8208;Based Ionic Liquids</title>

Grey tellurium dissolves under disproportionation in the ionic liquids [P66614][OAc] and [P4444][OAc] at ambient temperatures. The stable red&#8208;purple solutions contain tellurium cations, such as (Te4)2+ and (Te6)4+, and anions (Ten)2&#8722; with chain lengths up to at least n=5, as evidenced by spectroscopic and electrochemical techniques. DFT calculations indicate that electrostatic interactions with the components of the ILs stabilize tellurium cations and anions in solution.







Abstract
Elemental tellurium readily dissolves in ionic liquids (ILs) based on tetraalkylphosphonium cations even at temperatures below 100&#8201;&#176;C. In the case of ILs with acetate, decanoate, or dicyanamide anions, dark red to purple colored solutions form. A study combining NMR, UV&#8208;Vis and Raman spectroscopy revealed the formation of tellurium anions (Ten)2&#8722; with chain lengths up to at least n=5, which are in dynamic equilibrium with each other. Since external influences could be excluded and no evidence of an ionic liquid reaction was found, disproportionation of the tellurium is the only possible dissolution mechanism. Although the spectroscopic detection of tellurium cations in these solutions is difficult, the coexistence of tellurium cations, such as (Te4)2+ and (Te6)4+, and tellurium anions could be proven by cyclic voltammetry and electrodeposition experiments. DFT calculations indicate that electrostatic interactions with the ions of the ILs are sufficient to stabilize both types of tellurium ions in solution.

         <title>Asymmetric Catalytic Assembly of Triple&#8208;Columned and Multilayered Chiral Folding Polymers Showing Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission (AIE)</title>

         <dc:description>
A first asymmetric catalytic approach to multilayer 3D folding polymers by using Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling in the presence of chiral catalysts. The resulting multiple &#960;&#8208;assemblies exhibited remarkable optical properties in aggregated states (photoluminescence in solids and aggregation&#8208;induced emission in solutions), as well as reversible redox properties in electrochemical performance.







Abstract
Unprecedented chiral multilayer folding 3D polymers have been assembled and regulated by uniform and differentiated aromatic chromophore units between naphthyl piers. Screening catalysts, catalytic systems and monomers were proven to be crucial for asymmetric catalytic Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura polycouplings for this assembly. X&#8208;ray crystallography of the corresponding dimers and trimers revealed the absolute configuration and the intermolecular packing pattern. Up to 61&#8201;960 Mw/41&#8201;900 Mn and m/z 4317 for polymers and oligomers, as confirmed by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) and MALDI&#8208;TOF MS, indicated that these frameworks were composed of multiple stacked layers. The resulting multiple &#960;&#8208;assemblies exhibited remarkable optical properties in aggregated states (photoluminescence in solids and aggregation&#8208;induced emission in solutions), as well as reversible redox properties in electrochemical performance.

P(o&#8208;TMSC6H4)3: A phosphine with selective reactivity. The steric bulk (represented by the security guard) shields the phosphorus from most external influences &#8211; but not from all. Spectroscopy and diffraction reveal the structural diversity of this molecule and its hand picked reaction products.







Abstract
Tris(2&#8208;(trimethylsilyl)phenyl)phosphine, P(o&#8208;TMSC6H4)3, was synthesised and characterised in solution and in the solid state. The large steric bulk prevents most reactions of the phosphorus donor and makes the compound air stable both in the solid state as well as in solution. This shielded phosphine can still undergo three reactions, namely protonation, oxidation to the phosphine oxide under harsh conditions and complexation to AuI, thus forming a complex with linear coordination. Unexpectedly, complexation was unsuccessful with a range of other metal cations. Neither PdII, PtII, ZnII nor HgII reacted and even the remaining coinage metal cations CuI and AgI could not be coordinated. Both the parent molecule as well as the reaction products were structurally characterised by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, and the conformational change of geometry required to accommodate the additional atoms was analysed in detail. Apart from chemical oxidation with H2O2, P(o&#8208;TMSC6H4)3 displays reversible electrochemical oxidation with a potential not unlike the one of sterically unencumbered phosphines for which the oxidation is usually not reversible. P(o&#8208;TMSC6H4)3 can thus be considered a model compound for the investigation of the electronic properties of sterically unencumbered phosphines.

         <title>Carboboration&#8208;Driven Generation of a Silylium Ion for Vinylic C&#8722;F Bond Functionalization by B(C6F5)3 Catalysis</title>

B(C6F5)3&#8208;catalyzed reactions between fluoroalkenes and silyl ketene acetals gave vinylic C&#8722;F bond&#8208;functionalized products under mild and simple conditions. Carboboration reaction of fluoroalkenes generates an oxygen&#8208;stabilized silylium ion to facilitate the C&#8722;F bond cleavage. DFT and IBO studies were performed to clear the reaction mechanism. A comparative study of &#945;&#8208;chloro or bromostyrenes demonstrated that our reaction can be applied only to &#945;&#8208;fluorostyrenes due to the strong silicon&#8208;fluorine affinity.







Abstract
Strong main&#8208;group Lewis acids such as silylium ions are known to effectively promote heterolytic C(sp3)&#8722;F bond cleavage. However, carrying out the C(sp2)&#8722;F bond transformation of vinylic C&#8722;F bonds has remained an unmet challenge. Herein, we describe our development of a new and simple strategy for vinylic C&#8722;F bond transformation of &#945;&#8208;fluorostyrenes with silyl ketene acetals catalyzed by B(C6F5)3 under mild conditions. Our theoretical calculations revealed that a stabilized silylium ion, which is generated from silyl ketene acetals by carboboration, cleaves the C&#8722;F bond of &#945;&#8208;fluorostyrenes. A comparative study of &#945;&#8208;chloro or bromostyrenes demonstrated that our reaction can be applied only to &#945;&#8208;fluorostyrenes because the strong silicon&#8208;fluorine affinity facilitates an intramolecular interaction of silylium ions with fluorine atom to cleave the C&#8722;F bond. A broad range of &#945;&#8208;fluorostyrenes as well as a range of silyl ketene acetals underwent this C&#8722;F bond transformation.

         <title>Regioselective Fluorination of Acenes: Tailoring of Molecular Electronic Levels and Solid&#8208;State Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 7, February 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controlling energy levels: Partial fluorination of tetracenes allows the precise adjustment of the HOMO and LUMO energy levels. By applying regioselective synthetic strategies, such functionalized tetracenes can be obtained, as demonstrated for the unilaterally fluorinated F3TET, F4TET and F5TET. The solid&#8208;state packing and optoelectronic properties of these materials are compared to the properties of their parental acenes.







Abstract
Optoelectronic properties of molecular solids are important for organic electronic devices and are largely determined by the adopted molecular packing motifs. In this study, we analyzed such structure&#8208;property relationships for the partially regioselective fluorinated tetracenes 1,2,12&#8208;trifluorotetracene, 1,2,10,12&#8208;tetrafluorotetracene and 1,2,9,10,11&#8208;pentafluorotetracene that were further compared with tetracene and perfluoro&#8208;tetracene. Quantum chemical DFT calculations in combination with optical absorption spectroscopy data show that the frontier orbital energies are lowered with the degree of fluorination, while their optical gap is barely affected. However, the crystal structure changes from a herringbone packing motif of tetracene towards a planar stacking motif of the fluorinated tetracene derivatives, which is accompanied by the formation of excimers and leads to strongly red&#8208;shifted photoluminescence with larger lifetimes.

         <title>Properties of Single&#8208;Component Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Crystal&#8208;Glass Composites</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 7, February 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new series of single&#8208;component metal&#8211;organic framework crystal&#8208;glass composites (MOF&#8208;CGCs) were produced, where the materials contained a crystalline and glass phase from the same parent zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF): ZIF&#8208;62(Zn). The composites displayed thermal and adsorptive properties present in both the original crystalline and glass materials and interfacial compatibility between the two phases was evident. A mixed&#8208;metal Co/Zn analogue was also produced to further examine phase&#8208;mixing.







Abstract
The formation, and subsequent structural, thermal and adsorptive properties of single&#8208;component metal&#8211;organic framework crystal&#8208;glass composites (MOF&#8208;CGCs) are investigated. A series of novel materials exhibiting chemically identical glassy and crystalline phases within the same material were produced, where crystalline ZIF&#8208;62(Zn) was incorporated within an agZIF&#8208;62(Zn) matrix. X&#8208;ray diffraction showed that the crystalline phase was still present after heating to above the glass transition temperature of agZIF&#8208;62(Zn), and interfacial compatibility between the crystalline and glassy phases was investigated using a mixed&#8208;metal (ZIF&#8208;62(Co))0.5(agZIF&#8208;62(Zn))0.5 analogue. CO2 gas adsorption measurements showed that the CO2 uptakes of the MOF&#8208;CGCs were between those of the crystalline and glassy phases.

         <title>Synthesis of Redox&#8208;Active Photochromic Phenanthrene Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 7, February 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of photochromic phenanthrene derivatives bearing pyridine or pyridinium units have been synthetized and characterized by spectroscopy, electrochemistry and theoretical calculations. It has been demonstrated that the different substitution positions yield to a drastic difference on the photo and electrochromic properties of these systems. These compounds derived from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons compounds show good qualities for the applications in optoelectronic devices, as opto&#8208;transistors or in organic field&#8208;effect transistors.







Abstract
A phenanthrene unit has been functionalized by several methylthiophene units in order to bring it a photochromic behavior. These compounds were characterized by NMR, absorption and emission spectroscopies, theoretical calculations as well as cyclic voltammetry. The association of a phenanthrene group with a photochromic center could open the door to a new generation of organic field&#8208;effect transistors.

         <title>Cu2O/CeO2 Photo&#8208;electrochemical Water Splitting: A Nanocomposite with an Efficient Interfacial Transmission Path under the Co&#8208;action of a p&#8211;n Heterojunction and Micro&#8208;mesocrystals</title>

         <dc:description>
Improving your PECs: A Cu2O/CeO2 composite with a unique structure has been fabricated, in which a p&#8211;n heterojunction and a micro&#8208;mesocrystal (m&#8208;MC) structure work together. Under their synergistic effect, an optimal Cu2O/CeO2 photocathode provides a decisive pathway for the rapid separation and transfer of electron&#8211;holes, thereby facilitating the separation/transfer of carriers. As a result, the optimal Cu2O/CeO2 shows the best photo&#8208;electrochemical (PEC) water splitting performance and excellent stability.







Abstract
Cu2O is an ideal p&#8208;type material for photo&#8208;electrochemical (PEC) hydrogen evolution, although serious electron&#8211;hole recombination and photocorrosion restrict its further improvement for PEC activity. In this work, CeO2 nanoparticles (NPs) self&#8208;assemble on the surface of Cu2O octahedra, thus successfully forming a Cu2O/CeO2 structure in which p&#8211;n heterojunctions and micro&#8208;mesocrystals (m&#8208;MCs) work together. The optimum Cu2O/CeO2 composite, without the use of any cocatalyst, exhibits a fivefold higher photocurrent density (4.63&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 0&#8197;V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode) than that of Cu2O octahedra, which is better than most Cu2O&#8208;based photocathodes without cocatalyst and even comparable with advanced Cu2O&#8208;based photocathodes. The hydrogen production of the optimal Cu2O/CeO2 (Faradaic efficiency of &#8764;100&#8201;%) is 17.5&#8197;times higher than that of pure Cu2O octahedra, and the photocurrent shows almost no decay under the 12&#8197;h stability test. The delicately designed Cu2O/CeO2 structure in this work provides reference and inspiration for the design of cathodes materials.

         <title>Alkynylgold(I) C3&#8208;Chiral Concave Complexes: Aggregation and Luminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 7, February 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alkynylgold(I) C3&#8208;symmetric complexes bearing triphenyl (1) and trialkyl phosphine ligands (2 and 3) were synthesized and studied. In CHCl3/MeOH mixtures 1 and 2 showed an AIE effect at 540&#8197;nm, probably originating from aurophilic interactions. 3 showed AIE only in nearly pure MeOH and in the solid state. The aggregation of optically pure 1 started at lower MeOH content than (&#177;)&#8208;1, indicating that the latter gave racemates rather than conglomerates.







Abstract
Chiral gold(I) acetylide trinuclear complexes 1&#8211;3 based on the cyclotribenzylene platform and terminal PR3 ligands (R=Ph, Et, and Cy, respectively), were characterized and their light emission studied. They exhibited long&#8208;lived blue phosphorescence in CHCl3 and a weak fluorescence in the UV. In MeOH/CHCl3 mixtures of &gt;1:1 volume ratio, 1 and 2 exhibited a new emission band at ca. 540&#8197;nm that developed at the expense of the UV emission. DLS studies demonstrated the presence of molecular aggregates of &#216; 30&#8211;80&#8197;nm. The green emission observed in MeOH&#8208;rich solvent mixtures was therefore induced by aggregation, and could originate from Au&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Au interactions. The AIE spectrum of 3 was observed only in solutions containing 99&#8201;% of MeOH, and correlated with its solid state emission. The AIE profiles of the enantiomers of 1 differed from that of rac&#8208;1, suggesting that the latter is a true racemate.

         <title>Stereoselective Synthesis, Configurational Assignment and Biological Evaluations of the Lipid Mediator RvD2n&#8208;3 DPA</title>

RvD2n&#8208;3 DPA, a specialized pro&#8208;resolving mediator, is synthesized for the first time based on the retrosynthetic outline depicted, enabling its structural elucidation and biological evaluations against S. aureus and zymosan A induced inflammation.







Abstract
Herein we report the first total synthesis of RvD2n&#8208;3 DPA, an endogenously formed mediator biosynthesized from the omega&#8208;3 fatty acid n&#8208;3 docosapentaenoic acid. The key steps are the Midland Alpine borane reduction, Sonogashira cross&#8208;coupling reactions, and a Z&#8208;selective alkyne reduction protocol, yielding RvD2n&#8208;3 DPA methyl ester in 13&#8201;% yield over 12 steps (longest linear sequence). The physical property data (UV chromophore, chromatography and MS/MS fragmentation) of the synthetic lipid mediator matched those obtained from biologically produced material. Moreover, synthetic RvD2n&#8208;3 DPA also carried the potent biological activities of enhancing macrophage uptake of Staphylococcus aureus and zymosan A bioparticles.

The difference of electron delocalization between two sets of &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems and significant influence of the number of &#8208;CO groups on them were focused on, and the essential reason for the distinct difference in molecular aromaticity was elucidated.







Abstract
The bonding character, electron delocalization, and aromaticity of the cyclo[18]carbon (C18) precursors, C18&#8208;(CO)n (n=6, 4, and 2), have been studied by combining quantum chemical calculations and various electronic wavefunction analyses with different physical bases. It was found that C18&#8208;(CO)n (n=6, 4, and 2) molecules exhibit alternating long and short C&#8722;C bonds, and have out&#8208;of&#8208;plane and in&#8208;plane dual &#960; systems (&#960;out and &#960;in) perpendicular to each other, which are consistent with the relevant characteristics of C18. However, the presence of carbonyl (&#8208;CO) groups significantly reduced the global electron conjugation of C18&#8208;(CO)n (n=6, 4, and 2) compared to C18. Specifically, the &#8208;CO group largely breaks the extensive delocalization of &#960;in system, and the &#960;out system is also affected by it but to a much lesser extent; as a consequence, C18&#8208;(CO)n (n=6, 4, and 2) with larger n shows weaker overall aromaticity. Mostly because of the decreased but still apparent &#960;out electron delocalization in the C18&#8208;(CO)n (n=6, 4, and 2), a notable diatropic induced ring current under the action of external magnetic field is observed, demonstrating the clear aromatic characteristic in the molecules. The correlation between C18&#8208;(CO)n (n=6, 4, and 2) and C18 in terms of the gradual elimination of &#8208;CO from the precursors showed that the direct elimination of two CO molecules in C18&#8208;(CO)n (n=6, 4, and 2) has a synergistic mechanism, but it is kinetically infeasible under normal conditions due to the high energy barrier.

The synthesis and biophysical screening of guanine quadruplex stabilization and binding properties of a family of platinum di&#8208;imine complexes are described. The second&#8208;generation binders display enhanced stabilization and selectivity compared to the parent compound, bearing much promise for the future evolution of this novel platform.







Abstract
The long&#8208;standing history of platinum coordination complexes in nucleic acid recognition attests to the unique suitability of such species for therapeutic applications. Here, we report the synthetic exploration and development of a family of di&#8208;imine ligands, and their platinum(II) complexes, elaborated on a 3&#8208;(2&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;[1,2,4]triazolo[4,3&#8208;a]pyridine platform which, in its unsubstituted form, has recently been shown to display exceptional capabilities for guanine quadruplex (G4) targeting. The identification of facile, high&#8208;yielding synthetic methods for the derivatization of this platform for the incorporation of additional sites of interactions with guanine quadruplex loops and grooves, along with the optimization of platinum(II) complexation methods, are discussed. Gratifyingly, preliminary biophysical screening of this novel family of binders validates all but one family members as robust G4 binders and highlights enhanced selectivity for quadruplex versus duplex DNA compared to the parent compound. These results bear promise for practical developments based on this platform.

         <title>Indoloquinoline Ligands Favor Intercalation at Quadruplex&#8208;Duplex Interfaces</title>

Quadruplex&#8208;duplex junctions: A quadruplex&#8208;duplex interface outcompetes an exposed 5&#8217;&#8208;outer tetrad of a parallel quadruplex as favored binding site for indoloquinoline ligands. The ligands intercalate between the G&#8208;tetrad and the neighboring Watson&#8208;Crick base pair located at the interface. High&#8208;affinity binding associated with a large exothermicity is driven by maximizing &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking and electrostatic interactions of the positively charged indoloquinoline moiety.







Abstract
Quadruplex&#8208;duplex (Q&#8208;D) junctions are increasingly considered promising targets for medicinal and technological applications. Here, a Q&#8208;D hybrid with a hairpin&#8208;type snapback loop coaxially stacked onto the quadruplex 3&#8217;&#8208;outer tetrad was designed and employed as a target structure for the indoloquinoline ligand SYUIQ&#8208;5. NMR spectral analysis demonstrated high&#8208;affinity binding of the ligand at the quadruplex&#8208;duplex interface with association constants determined by isothermal titration calorimetry of about 107&#8197;M&#8722;1 and large exothermicities &#916;H&#176; of &#8722;14&#8197;kcal/mol in a 120&#8197;mM K+ buffer at 40&#8201;&#176;C. Determination of the ligand&#8208;bound hybrid structure revealed intercalation of SYUIQ&#8208;5 between 3&#8217;&#8208;outer tetrad and the neighboring CG base pair, maximizing &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking as well as electrostatic interactions with guanine carbonyl groups in close vicinity to the positively charged protonated quinoline nitrogen of the tetracyclic indoloquinoline. Exhibiting considerable flexibility, the SYUIQ&#8208;5 sidechain resides in the duplex minor groove. Based on comparative binding studies with the non&#8208;substituted N5&#8208;methylated indoloquinoline cryptolepine, the sidechain is suggested to confer additional affinity and to fix the alignment of the intercalated indoloquinoline aromatic core. However, selectivity for the Q&#8208;D junction mostly relies on the geometry and charge distribution of the indoloquinoline ring system. The presented results are expected to provide valuable guidelines for the design of ligands specifically targeting Q&#8208;D interfaces.

         <title>MOF&#8208;Stabilized Perfluorinated Palladium Cages Catalyze the Additive&#8208;Free Aerobic Oxidation of Aliphatic Alcohols to Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 7, February 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorinated pyridine&#8208;Pd2+ coordinate cages have been synthesized and characterized with atomic resolution within the channels of a metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF), and used as catalysts during the aerobic oxidation of aliphatic alcohols to carboxylic acids without any additive. These results illustrate a rare example of stable per&#8208;fluorinated cationic metal complex, with potential implications in the future design of catalytic organometallic complexes.







Abstract
Extremely high electrophilic metal complexes, composed by a metal cation and very electron poor &#963;&#8208;donor ancillary ligands, are expected to be privileged catalysts for oxidation reactions in organic chemistry. However, their low lifetime prevents any use in catalysis. Here we show the synthesis of fluorinated pyridine&#8208;Pd2+ coordinate cages within the channels of an anionic tridimensional metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF), and their use as efficient metal catalysts for the aerobic oxidation of aliphatic alcohols to carboxylic acids without any additive. Mechanistic studies strongly support that the MOF&#8208;stabilized coordination cage with perfluorinated ligands unleashes the full electrophilic potential of Pd2+ to dehydrogenate primary alcohols, without any base, and also to activate O2 for the radical oxidation to the aldehyde intermediate. This study opens the door to design catalytic perfluorinated complexes for challenging organic transformations, where an extremely high electrophilic metal site is required.

         <title>Biodegradation of Herbicides by a Plant Nonheme Iron Dioxygenase: Mechanism and Selectivity of Substrate Analogues</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 7, February 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Density functional theory calculations show how plant enzymes can initiate the biodegradation of herbicide molecules efficiently. However, the reactivity of substituted substrate analogues is slowed down and in some cases encounters a large rebound barrier.







Abstract
Aryloxyalkanoate dioxygenases are unique herbicide biodegrading nonheme iron enzymes found in plants and hence, from environmental and agricultural point of view they are important and valuable. However, they often are substrate specific and little is known on the details of the mechanism and the substrate scope. To this end, we created enzyme models and calculate the mechanism for 2,4&#8208;dichlorophenoxyacetic acid biodegradation and 2&#8208;methyl substituted analogues by density functional theory. The work shows that the substrate binding is tight and positions the aliphatic group close to the metal center to enable a chemoselective reaction mechanism to form the C2&#8208;hydroxy products, whereas the aromatic hydroxylation barriers are well higher in energy. Subsequently, we investigated the metabolism of R&#8208; and S&#8208;methyl substituted inhibitors and show that these do not react as efficiently as 2,4&#8208;dichlorophenoxyacetic acid substrate due to stereochemical clashes in the active site and particularly for the R&#8208;isomer give high rebound barriers.

         <title>Borane Adducts of Aromatic Phosphorus Heterocycles: Synthesis, Crystallographic Characterization and Reactivity of a Phosphinine&#8208;B(C6F5)3 Lewis Pair</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 7, February 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Roll out the barrelene: The synthesis and crystallographic characterization of a phosphinine&#8211;borane adduct has been achieved for the first time. The novel Lewis adduct shows rapid insertion and [4+2] cycloaddition reactivity towards phenylacetylene, whereas a hitherto unknown dihydro&#8208;1&#8208;phosphabarrelene is formed with styrene. Reaction with an ester provides a new, facile and selective route to 1&#8208;R&#8208;phosphininium salts. These subsequently undergo a [4+2] cycloaddition in the presence of alkenes and alkynes to cleanly form unprecedented derivatives of 1&#8208;R&#8208;phosphabarrelenium salts.







Abstract
A phosphinine&#8208;borane adduct of a Me3Si&#8208;functionalized phosphinine and the Lewis acid B(C6F5)3 has been synthesized and characterized crystallographically for the first time. The reaction strongly depends on the nature of the substituents in the &#945;&#8208;position of the phosphorus heterocycle. In contrast, the reaction of B2H6 with various substituted phosphinines leads to an equilibrium between the starting materials and the phosphinine&#8211;borane adducts that is determined by the Lewis basicity of the phosphinine. The novel phosphinine borane adduct (6&#8208;B(C6F5)3) shows rapid and facile insertion and [4+2] cycloaddition reactivity towards phenylacetylene. A hitherto unknown dihydro&#8208;1&#8208;phosphabarrelene is formed with styrene. The reaction with an ester provides a new, facile and selective route to 1&#8208;R&#8208;phosphininium salts. These salts then undergo a [4+2] cycloaddition in the presence of Me3Si&#8722;C&#8801;CH and styrene to cleanly form unprecedented derivatives of 1&#8208;R&#8208;phosphabarrelenium salts.

         <title>Alkaline Stability of Low Oxophilicity Metallopolymer Anion&#8208;Exchange Membranes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 7, February 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metallopolymers can address many of the challenges of anion&#8208;exchange membranes in electrochemical devices, especially those requiring high alkaline stability. Using the same polymer backbone and NHC ligand, membranes are prepared using low oxophilicity metals such as Cu, Zn, Ni and Au, and their relative alkaline stabilities are compared. The Au(III) metallopolymer demonstrates unparalleled alkaline stability and good ion&#8208;conductivity.







Abstract
Anion&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs) are promising energy conversion devices due to their high efficiency. Nonetheless, AEMFC operation time is currently limited by the low chemical stability of their polymeric anion&#8208;exchange membranes. In recent years, metallopolymers, where the metal centers assume the ion transport function, have been proposed as a chemically stable alternative. Here we present a systematic study using a polymer backbone with side&#8208;chain N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands complexed to various metals with low oxophilicity, such as copper, zinc, nickel, and gold. The golden metallopolymer, using the metal with the lowest oxophilicity, demonstrates exceptional alkaline stability, far superior to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art quaternary ammonium cations, as well as good in situ AEMFC results. These results demonstrate that judiciously designed metallopolymers may be superior to purely organic membranes and provides a scientific base for further developments in the field.

         <title>Heteropolymetallic Architectures as Snapshots of Transmetallation Processes at Different Degrees of Transfer</title>

Frustrated R&#8208;transfer processes: The catalytic use of bimetallic couples acting in a cooperative way affords novel and efficient chemical transformations. The presence of M&#8722;M&#8217; interactions is a key feature in these processes. We describe here a complete series of complexes containing G10M&#8722;G11M bonds (G10M=Pd, Pt; G11M=Ag, Au) that can be considered as snapshots of transmetallation processes. All together they compose a sort of short movie that allows to rank the progression of such processes depending on of the metals involved.







Abstract
Novel heteropolymetallic architectures have been built by integrating Pd, Au and Ag systems. The dinuclear [(CNC)(PPh3)Pd&#8208;G11M(PPh3)](ClO4) (G11M=Au (3), Ag (4); CNC=2,6&#8208;diphenylpyridinate) and trinuclear [{(CNC)(PPh3)Pd}2G11M](ClO4) (G11M=Au (6), Ag (5)) complexes have been accessed or isolated. Structural and DFT characterization unveil striking interactions of one of the aryl groups of the CNC ligand(s) with the G11M center, suggesting these complexes constitute models of transmetallation processes. Further analyses allow to qualitatively order the degree of transfer, proving that Au promotes the highest one and also that Pd systems favor higher degrees than Pt. Consistently, Energy Decomposition Analysis calculations show that the interaction energies follow the order Pd&#8722;Au &gt; Pt&#8722;Au &gt; Pd&#8722;Ag &gt; Pt&#8722;Ag. All these results offer potentially useful ideas for the design of bimetallic catalytic systems.

         <title>Injectable Micromotor@Hydrogel System for Antibacterial Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 7, February 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An injectable micromotor@hydrogel drug delivery system which can be injected directly into lesions to release micromotors in response to the environment has been developed to reduce external influence on micromotors and improve the sustained&#8208;release effect. Micromotors underwent enhanced diffusion in the surroundings of bacteria without addition of exogenous hydrogen peroxide, which was manifested by their appearance in edge of the inhibition zone. The proposed micromotor@hydrogel drug delivery system offers a new strategy for the treatment of bacterial infections.







Abstract
The drug delivery system based on nano/micromotors has become a research hot spot in recent years. However, naked micromotors may be ruptured or passivated under the complex biological environment, which will result in the leakage of drugs in advance or limited self&#8208;propulsion performance. Herein, an injectable micromotor@hydrogel drug delivery system to protect micromotors from the external environment is proposed. The micromotors were prepared through layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer assembly technology. The asymmetric decomposition of hydrogen peroxide catalyzed by the locally distributed platinum nanoparticles enabled efficient propulsion of the micromotors in low concentration of hydrogen peroxide. In order to protect micromotors, they were loaded into the Schiff base hydrogel.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;An injectable&lt;/b&gt; micromotor@hydrogel drug delivery system which can be injected directly into lesions to release micromotors in response to the environment has been developed to reduce external influence on micromotors and improve the sustained-release effect. Micromotors underwent enhanced diffusion in the surroundings of bacteria without addition of exogenous hydrogen peroxide, which was manifested by their appearance in edge of the inhibition zone. The proposed micromotor@hydrogel drug delivery system offers a new strategy for the treatment of bacterial infections.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drug delivery system based on nano/micromotors has become a research hot spot in recent years. However, naked micromotors may be ruptured or passivated under the complex biological environment, which will result in the leakage of drugs in advance or limited self-propulsion performance. Herein, an injectable micromotor@hydrogel drug delivery system to protect micromotors from the external environment is proposed. The micromotors were prepared through layer-by-layer assembly technology. The asymmetric decomposition of hydrogen peroxide catalyzed by the locally distributed platinum nanoparticles enabled efficient propulsion of the micromotors in low concentration of hydrogen peroxide. In order to protect micromotors, they were loaded into the Schiff base hydrogel. The micromotor@hydrogel system can be injected directly into the lesion to release micromotors in response to the environment, reducing external influence on micromotors and improving the sustained-release effect. Erythromycin (Ery) loaded into the micromotors and the micromotor@hydrogel system demonstrated excellent antibacterial effect. Micromotors released from the hydrogel underwent enhanced diffusion in the surroundings of bacteria without addition of exogenous hydrogen peroxide, which was manifested by their appearance in edge of the inhibition zone. The proposed micromotor@hydrogel drug delivery system offers a new strategy for the treatment of bacterial infections.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission Leading to White Light Emission in Diphenylbenzofulvene Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 7, February 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Even though the aggregation&#8208;induced emission phenomena have been described for diphenylbenzofulvene derivatives for about 15&#8197;years, their solid&#8208;state emission in films has not been previously studied. Hereby, their solid&#8208;state emission is characterized and the white light emission of a thin film made of mixture of the derivatives DPBFMe and DPMF(Me)2 is deciphered.







Abstract
The search for a unique molecular system able to efficiently emit in the total visible range of the electromagnetic spectra, i.&#8201;e., white light emission (WLE), is a topic of intense research. We here show that aggregates formed by diphenylbenzofulvene (DPBF) derivatives are from two to four orders of magnitude more emissive than their monomers. From a simple strategy, involving structural modification of a DPBF propelled shape core, a close match with the pure white light emission coordinates is obtained with a combination of two derivatives in films, with featured solid&#8208;state emission, without involvement of D&#8722;A groups or energy transfer processes.

         <title>Light&#8208;Assisted Ullmann Coupling of Phenols and Aryl Halides: The Synergetic Effect Between Plasmonic Copper Nanoparticles and Carbon Nanotubes from Various Sources</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 7, February 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, plasmonic copper nanoparticles (Cu NPs) were loaded onto carbon nanotubes (CNTs) from various sources including commercial CNTs and those directly derived from plastic wastes. Under visible&#8208;light irradiation, the synergetic effect between Cu NPs and CNTs could efficiently promote Ullmann coupling of phenols and aryl halides, achieving high yields of diaryl ethers.







Abstract
Utilizing light and plastic wastes as resources to turn the wasted phenols and hazardous aryl halides into value added chemicals seems to be an attractive idea for alleviating the energy crisis and environmental problems. In this work, plasmonic copper nanoparticles (Cu NPs) were loaded onto carbon nanotubes (CNTs) from various sources including commercial CNTs and those derived from plastic wastes. Under visible&#8208;light irradiation, the catalyst could efficiently convert phenols and aryl halides to diaryl ethers. Similar with commercial CNTs, excellent activity is also achieved when utilizing CNTs derived from different kinds of plastic wastes as support for the system. Further investigation shows that the visible&#8208;light irradiation and light&#8208;excited plasmonic Cu NPs are necessary to inhibit the phenol degradation on CNTs and in turn promote the cross&#8208;coupling of phenol and aryl halides. Compared with metal oxides and other carbon materials, the excellent capability of CNTs to absorb light, to convert light to heat, and to adsorb both two reactants simultaneously are critical to enhance the activity of Cu NPs, achieving high yields of diaryl ethers. This study could provide a novel strategy for catalyst design and generate a more economically sustainable process.

Chirality patterns are commonly observed in the universe and in nature, particularly at micro&#8208; and macrolevels governing the origin of life on earth. Multilayer folding 3D chirality was discovered as a new addition to the chirality family, which is now achieved at a macromolecular level through asymmetric catalytic polymerization. These polymers show conformational flexibility upon pushing and releasing operations providing a variety of molecular energy levels. Therefore, they can have unique photo and electronic properties and it is anticipated that they will have a great impact on chemistry and materials science in the future. More information can be found in the Research Article by G. Li et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202104102).

Perfluorinated aromatics and heteroaromatics are versatile reagents for the modification of amino acids, peptides and proteins. This is principally because they undergo rapid and selective nucleophilic substitution reactions with biological nucleophiles. They are, therefore, exciting tools with which to modulate the biological activities and drug&#8208;like properties of natural and synthetic biomolecules in drug discovery and with which to append, for example, fluorescent probes in chemical biology studies. In this Minireview, Will Brittain and Chris Coxon survey the current field, discussing the synthetic incorporation of perfluoro(hetero)aromatics, the challenges posed by their physical and chemical properties, how these can be overcome, and what the future holds for these important new tools. For more information, see the Minireview on page 10.

         <dc:description>
The catalytic use of metallic couples acting in a cooperative way arises as a powerful tool affording novel and efficient chemical transformations. In this article, a series of complexes containing M&#8722;M&#8242; bonds (M=Pd, Pt; M&#8242;=Ag, Au) is described. They can be regarded as arrested intermediates or snapshots of a transmetallation process that becomes &#8220;frustrated&#8221; given the nature of the &#8220;disputed&#8221; R fragment. Still, some gradation in the transfer can be evaluated depending on the M&#8722;M&#8242; couple, and all together they compose a short movie allowing the progression of such processes to be ranked. More information can be found in the Research Article by M. Baya, A. Mart&#237;n, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202104538).

         <dc:description>
The first crystallographically characterized phosphinine&#8211;borane adduct mimics frustrated Lewis&#8208;pair reactivity. In the presence of alkynes, alkenes and esters, a facile conversion to novel phosphinine&#8208;based species is achieved even at room temperature. Our results provide fascinating new perspectives for the future, particularly with respect to the activation of small molecules. More information can be found in the Research Article by T. B&#246;ttcher, C. M&#252;ller et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202104135).

         <title>Perfluoroaryl and Perfluoroheteroaryl Reagents as Emerging New Tools for Peptide Synthesis, Modification and Bioconjugation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 7, February 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Perfluoroaromatic and perfluoroheteroaromatic reagents have emerged in recent years as powerful reagents for peptide and protein modification. Dominated by their regio&#8208; and chemoselective nucleophilic aromatic substitution chemistry under mild conditions, they have been used in peptide synthesis, tagging, cyclisation, stapling and protein bioconjugation.







Abstract
Peptides and proteins are becoming increasingly valuable as medicines, diagnostic agents and as tools for biomedical sciences. Much of this has been underpinned by the emergence of new methods for the manipulation and augmentation of native biomolecules. Perfluoroaromatic reagents are perhaps one of the most diverse and exciting tools with which to modify peptides and proteins, due principally to their nucleophilic substitution chemistry, high electron deficiency and the ability for their reactivity to be tuned towards specific nucleophiles. As discussed in this minireview, in recent years, perfluoroaromatic reagents have found applications as protecting groups or activating groups in peptide synthesis and as orthogonal handles for peptide modification. Furthermore, they have applications in chemoselective &#8216;tagging&#8217;, stapling and bioconjugation of peptides and proteins, as well as tuning of &#8216;drug&#8208;like&#8217; properties. This review will also explore possible future applications of these reagents in biological chemistry.

         <title>An Incremental System To Predict the Effect of Different London Dispersion Donors in All&#8208;meta&#8208;Substituted Azobenzenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An incremental system for London dispersion has been developed that allows an easy back&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;envelope estimation when systematically altering the London dispersion donors. A simple equation is proposed that nicely reproduces the experimental results within error.







Abstract
Predictive models based on incremental systems exist for many chemical phenomena, thus allowing easy estimates. Despite their low magnitude in isolated systems London dispersion interactions are ubiquitous in manifold situations ranging from solvation to catalysis or in biological systems. Based on our azobenzene system, we systematically determined the London dispersion donor strength of the alkyl substituents Me, Et, iPr up to tBu. Based on this data, we were able to implement an incremental system for London dispersion for the azobenzene scheme. We propose an equation that allows the prediction of the effect of change of substituents on London dispersion interactions in azobenzenes, which has to be validated in similar molecular arrangements in the future.

         <title>Formation of Supramolecular Nanostructures through in Situ Self&#8208;Assembly and Post&#8208;Assembly Modification of a Biocatalytically Constructed Dipeptide Hydrazide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermolysin&#8208;assisted biocatalytic construction of a self&#8208;assembling dipeptide hydrazide from two kinds of non&#8208;self&#8208;assembling amino acid derivatives gives rise to the formation of supramolecular helical architectures under aqueous conditions. In addition, post&#8208;assembly modification based on hydrazone formation allows the in&#8208;situ constructed supramolecular helical architectures to be decorated with tethering hydrazide groups as chemical handles.

         <title>Regulating Interfacial Lithium Ion by Artificial Protective Overlayers for High&#8208;Performance Lithium Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fabricating artificial protective overlayer with tunable surficial properties on lithium metal is a precise and effective strategy to relieve nonuniform lithium ion flux and sluggish lithium ion transportation at the anode surface. This Concept article introduces the key advancement of artificial protective overlayers for high&#8208;performance lithium metal anodes.







Abstract
The main limitation of lithium (Li) metal anodes lies in their severe dendrite growth due to nonuniform Li+ flux and sluggish Li+ transportation at the anode surface. Fabricating artificial protective overlayer with tunable surficial properties on Li metal is a precise and effective strategy to relieve this problem. In this Concept article, we focus on the basic principles of regulating interfacial Li+ through artificial protective overlayers and summarize the material preparation as well as structural design of these overlayers. The remaining challenges and promising directions of artificial protective overlayers are then highlighted to provide clues for the practical application of Li metal anodes.

         <title>Functionalized Graphene Quantum Dots Modified Dioxin&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks for Superior Lithium Storage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Functionalized graphene quantum dots (GQDs) modified dioxin&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COF) are fabricated and applied as anode material of lithium&#8208;ion battery for the first time. The modification of carboxyl GQDs leads to more active sites, fast lithium&#8208;ion transportation kinetics, and enhanced electronic conductivity, resulting in enhanced lithium&#8208;storage properties for the graphene quantum dots modified covalent organic frameworks (COF&#8208;GQDs) electrode







Abstract
Covalent organic framework, as an emerging porous nano&#8208;frame structure with pre&#8208;designed structure and custom properties, has been demonstrated as a prospective electrode for rechargeable Li&#8208;ion batteries. For improving the reversible capacity and long&#8208;term cycle stability of COF materials, we propose a GQDs modified COF material (COF&#8208;GQDs) and apply it as the anode for LIBs for the first time. This COF&#8208;GQDs electrode delivers enhanced long&#8208;term cycling performance with a large capacity of &#8764;820&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 300 cycles at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1 and an improved rate performance. The enhanced lithium&#8208;storage performance, in terms of obvious&#8208;shortened activation process and high reversible capacities, can be attributed to the modification of carboxyl GQDs, which would activate more active sites (activated C=C groups from benzene rings) for lithium&#8208;storage, and provide fast lithium&#8208;ion transportation kinetic. Besides, the decreased interphase resistance, enhanced electronic conductivity, and prevented aggregation of needle&#8208;flake COF structure, originated from the addition of GQDs, which lead to the enhanced improved cycling stability of the COF&#8208;GQDs electrode. This manuscript can promote the further exploration on the design of COF&#8208;related materials with modification of functionalized carbonaceous materials to achieve enhanced lithium&#8208;storage properties for next&#8208;generation energy storage.

         <title>A Rare Alder&#8208;ene Cycloisomerization of 1,6&#8208;Allenynes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel Alder&#8208;ene reaction: Thermally induced intramolecular Alder&#8208;ene reactions of 1,6&#8208;allenynes gives &#945;&#8208;methylene&#8208;&#947;&#8208;lactams via a mechanism distinct from previous [2+2] cycloisomerization manifolds of related skeletons. The mechanism involves an unusual transfer of the allene&#8208;hydrogen and is supported by computational and deuterium labelling studies. The reaction is favoured by the electron&#8208;deficient nature of the propiolamide moiety and the absence of substituents on the termini of both the allene &#8220;ene&#8221; moiety and the alkyne of the 1,6&#8208;allenyne.

Thermally induced cycloisomerization reactions of 1,6&#8208;allenynes gives &#945;&#8208;methylene&#8208;&#947;&#8208;lactams via intramolecular Alder&#8208;ene reactions. The mechanism is supported by computational and deuterium labelling studies. This thermal, non&#8208;radical method enables the discovery of a hitherto unknown route that proceeds via a divergent mechanism distinct from the previous [2+2] cycloisomerization manifold.

         <dc:description>
Highly oxygenated intermediates play an important role in the low&#8208;temperature oxidation of fuels. In this study, a molecular beam sampling vacuum ultraviolet photoionization time&#8208;of&#8208;flight mass spectrometer (MB&#8208;VUV&#8208;PI&#8208;TOFMS) is used to observe the low&#8208;temperature oxidation products, especially highly oxygenated intermediates like ketohydroperoxide (KHP), keto&#8208;dihydroperoxide (KDHP), olefinic hydroperoxides (OHP) and dione structure products. More information can be found in the Full Paper by S. Chen, J. Chen, Z. Tang, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202103546).

         <title>Revisiting the Fundamental Nature of Metal&#8208;Ligand Bonding: An Impartial and Automated Fitting Procedure for Angular Overlap Model Parameters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Our work on ligand field theory&#8212;an automated fitting procedure for Angular Overlap Model (AOM) parameters&#8212;is reflected by Van Gogh's Field with Irises near Arles. We showcase the capabilities of this procedure with a two&#8208;dimensional spectrochemical series with the metals manganese, iron, cobalt, nickel and copper and the halides fluoride, chloride, bromide and iodide. The perspective in van Gogh's field resembles a correlation we found between the halide ligands&#8217; AOM parameters and their chemical hardness. More information can be found in the Research Article by V. Krewald et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202103775). Original image credit: Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam (Vincent van Gogh Foundation).

         <title>In&#8208;situ synthesis of the thinnest In2Se3/In2S3/In2Se3 sandwich&#8208;like heterojunction for photoelectrocatalytic water splitting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The efficient utilization of solar energy for photoelectrocatalytic (PEC) water splitting is a feasible solution for developing clean energy and alleviating environmental issues. However, as the core of PEC technology, the existing photoanode catalysts have disadvantages such as poor photoelectrocatalytic conversion efficiency, low conductivity of photogenerated carriers, and instability. Here, we report the ultrathin two&#8208;dimensional sandwich&#8208;like heterojunction of In 2  Se 3  /In 2  S 3  /In 2  Se 3  (SW In 2  S 3  @In 2  Se 3  ) for the first time for PEC water splitting. Our findings identify the efficient separation of electrons and holes by constructing SW In 2  S 3  @In 2  Se 3  heterojunction. The in&#8208;situ synthesis of ultrathin nanosheet arrays by using surface substitution of Se atom to epitaxially grow cell In 2  Se 3  maximizes the contact area of heterogeneous interface and accelerates the transmission of charge carrier. Benefitting from the unique structure and composition characteristic, SW In 2  S 3  @In 2  Se 3  displays excellent performance in PEC water splitting. The photocurrent density of SW In 2  S 3  @In 2  Se 3  reaches 8.43 mA cm &#8722;2  at 1.23 V RHE  . Compared with In 2  S 3  , the SW In 2  S 3  @In 2  Se 3  photoanode has nearly 12 times higher PEC performance, which represents the best performance among the In 2  S 3  &#8208;based photoanode heterojunction reported so far. The evolution rate of O 2  reaches 78.8 &#956;mol cm &#8208;2  h &#8208;1  , and the photocurrent has no apparent variety within 24 hours.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanistic Insight into Hydroboration of Imines from Combined Computational and Experimental Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Detailed DFT calculations and experiments were performed to study the hydroboration mechanisms of two different kinds of imines. Our results revealed that BArF3&#8208;catalyzed imine hydroboration proceeds through a BArF3&#8208;promoted hydride transfer pathway. The catalyst&#8208;free imine hydroboration is difficult to occur under the previously reported conditions (room temperature) according to our studies, and a BH3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;SMe2&#8208;catalyzed hydroboration reaction of imines was established. For the later hydroboration reaction, a hydroboration/B&#8722;H/B&#8722;N &#963;&#8208;bond metathesis pathway is preferred from our results.







Abstract
Boron Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed and catalyst&#8208;free hydroboration reactions of imines are attractive due to the mild reaction conditions. In this work, the mechanistic details of the hydroboration reactions of two different kinds of imines with pinacolborane (HBpin) are investigated by combining density functional theory calculations and some experimental studies. For the hydroboration reaction of N&#8208;(&#945;&#8208;methylbenzylidene)aniline catalyzed by tris[3,5&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]borane (BArF3), our calculations show that the reaction proceeds through a boron Lewis acid&#8208;promoted hydride transfer mechanism rather than the classical Lewis acid activation mechanism. For the catalyst&#8208; and solvent&#8208;free hydroboration reaction of imine, N&#8208;benzylideneaniline, our calculations and experimental studies indicate that this reaction is difficult to occur under the reaction conditions reported previously. With a combination of computational and experimental studies, we have established that the commercially available BH3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;SMe2 can serve as an efficient catalyst for the hydroboration reactions of N&#8208;benzylideneaniline and similar imines. The hydroboration reactions catalyzed by BH3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;SMe2 are most likely to proceed through a hydroboration/B&#8722;H/B&#8722;N &#963;&#8208;bond metathesis pathway, which is very different from that of the reaction catalyzed by BArF3.

Keeping it simple: Minimalist photo&#8208;reactive probes, consisting of a photo&#8208;reactive group and a tag for the detection of target proteins, are useful tools in chemical biology. We have synthesized minimalist probes based on 2&#8208;thienyl&#8208;substituted &#945;&#8208;ketoamide by introducing an alkyne group into the thiophene ring. The position of the alkyne moiety significantly influences the reactivity.







Abstract
Minimalist photo&#8208;reactive probes, which consist of a photo&#8208;reactive group and a tag for detection of target proteins, are useful tools in chemical biology. Although several diazirine&#8208;based and aryl azide&#8208;based minimalist probes are available, no keto&#8208;based minimalist probe has yet been reported. Here we describe minimalist probes based on a 2&#8208;thienyl&#8208;substituted &#945;&#8208;ketoamide bearing an alkyne group on the thiophene ring. The 3&#8208;alkyne probe showed the highest photo&#8208;affinity labeling efficiency.

         <title>Structural Insights into Pixatimod (PG545) Inhibition of Heparanase, a Key Enzyme in Cancer and Viral Infections</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pixatimod (PG545), a drug candidate, is a potent inhibitor of heparanase. Conformational analysis by NMR spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulations revealed a flexible reducing end residue in a skew boat&#8208;like conformation. Docking and molecular dynamics simulations of PG545 with heparanase show that PG545 can block the active site by binding in different conformations, with the cholestanol sidechain making important hydrophobic interactions.







Abstract
Pixatimod (PG545), a heparan sulfate (HS) mimetic and anticancer agent currently in clinical trials, is a potent inhibitor of heparanase. Heparanase is an endo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;glucuronidase that degrades HS in the extracellular matrix and basement membranes and is implicated in numerous pathological processes such as cancer and viral infections, including SARS&#8722;CoV&#8208;2. To understand how PG545 interacts with heparanase, we firstly carried out a conformational analysis through a combination of NMR experiments and molecular modelling which showed that the reducing end &#946;&#8208;D&#8208;glucose residue of PG545 adopts a distorted conformation. This was followed by docking and molecular dynamics simulations to study the interactions of PG545 with heparanase, revealing that PG545 is able to block the active site by binding in different conformations, with the cholestanol side&#8208;chain making important hydrophobic interactions. While PG545 blocks its natural substrate HS from binding to the active site, small synthetic heparanase substrates are only partially excluded, and thus pentasaccharide or larger substrates are preferred for assaying this class of inhibitor. This study provides new insights for the design of next&#8208;generation heparanase inhibitors and substrates.

         <title>Synthesis of Polyoxygenated Tropolones and their Antiviral Activity against Hepatitis B Virus and Herpes Simplex Virus&#8208;1</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy is described for the generation of polyoxygenated tropolones by using an intermolecular oxidopyrylium cycloaddition/ring&#8208;opening strategy and complementary benzyl alcohol incorporation steps. The antiviral activity of these molecules was assessed against the pathogenic viruses hepatitis B virus and herpes simplex virus&#8208;1, providing new structure&#8211;function insight.







Abstract
Polyoxygenated tropolones possess a broad range of biological activity, and as a result are promising lead structures or fragments for drug development. However, structure&#8211;function studies and subsequent optimization have been challenging, in part due to the limited number of readily available tropolones and the obstacles to their synthesis. Oxidopyrylium [5+2] cycloaddition can effectively generate a diverse array of seven&#8208;membered ring carbocycles, and as a result can provide a highly general strategy for tropolone synthesis. Here, we describe the use of 3&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;4&#8208;pyrone&#8208;based oxidopyrylium cycloaddition chemistry in the synthesis of functionalized 3,7&#8208;dimethoxytropolones, 3,7&#8208;dihydroxytropolones, and isomeric 3&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;7&#8208;methoxytropolones through complementary benzyl alcohol&#8208;incorporating procedures. The antiviral activity of these molecules against herpes simplex virus&#8208;1 and hepatitis B virus is also described, highlighting the value of this approach and providing new structure&#8211;function insights relevant to their antiviral activity.

         <title>C(spn)&#8722;X (n=1&#8211;3) Bond Activation by Palladium</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Less is more! Our quantum chemical analyses reveal that the activity of palladium catalysts towards C&#8722;X bond activation increases along ethane, ethylene, acetylene because the steric repulsion between catalyst and substrate is relieved as the number of substituents around the carbon atom goes down.







Abstract
We have studied the palladium&#8208;mediated activation of C(spn)&#8722;X bonds (n = 1&#8211;3 and X = H, CH3, Cl) in archetypal model substrates H3C&#8722;CH2&#8722;X, H2C=CH&#8722;X and HC&#8801;C&#8722;X by catalysts PdLn with Ln = no ligand, Cl&#8722;, and (PH3)2, using relativistic density functional theory at ZORA&#8208;BLYP/TZ2P. The oxidative addition barrier decreases along this series, even though the strength of the bonds increases going from C(sp3)&#8722;X, to C(sp2)&#8722;X, to C(sp)&#8722;X. Activation strain and matching energy decomposition analyses reveal that the decreased oxidative addition barrier going from sp3, to sp2, to sp, originates from a reduction in the destabilizing steric (Pauli) repulsion between catalyst and substrate. This is the direct consequence of the decreasing coordination number of the carbon atom in C(spn)&#8722;X, which goes from four, to three, to two along this series. The associated net stabilization of the catalyst&#8211;substrate interaction dominates the trend in strain energy which indeed becomes more destabilizing along this same series as the bond becomes stronger from C(sp3)&#8722;X to C(sp)&#8722;X.

         <title>Highly selective lysine acylation in proteins using a Lys&#8208;His tag sequence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemical modification of proteins has numerous applications, but it has been challenging to achieve the required high degree of selectivity on lysine amino groups. Recently, we described the highly selective acylation of proteins with an N&#8208;terminal Gly&#8208;His 6 segment. This tag promoted acylation of the N&#8208;terminal N &#945; &#8208;amine resulting in stable conjugates. Here, we report the peptide sequences His n &#8208;Lys&#8208;His m , which we term Lys&#8208;His tags. In combination with simple acylating agents, they facilitate the acylation of the designated Lys N &#949; &#8208;amine under mild conditions and with high selectivity over native Lys residues. We show that the Lys&#8208;His tags, which are 7 to 10 amino acids in length and still act as conventional His tags, can be inserted in proteins at the C&#8208;terminus or in loops, thus providing high flexibility regarding the site of modification. Finally, the selective and efficient acylation of the therapeutic antibody Rituximab, pure or mixed with other proteins, demonstrates the scope of the Lys&#8208;His tag acylation method.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible&#8208;light switching of metallosupramolecular assemblies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A photoswitchable ligand and palladium(II) ions form a dynamic mixture of self&#8208;assembled metallosupramolecular structures. The photoswitching ligand is an ortho&#8208;fluoroazobenzene with appended pyridyl groups. Combining the  E  &#8208;isomer with palladium(II) salts affords a double&#8208;walled triangle with composition [Pd  3  L  6  ]  6+  and a distorted tetrahedron [Pd  4  L  8  ]  8+  (1:2 ratio at 298 K). Irradiation with 410&#160;nm light generates a photostationary state with ~80% of the  E&#8208;  isomer of the ligand and results in the selective disassembly of the tetrahedron, the more thermodynamically stable structure, and the formation of the triangle, the more kinetically inert product. The triangle is then slowly transformed back into the tetrahedron over 2 days at 333 K. The  Z  &#8208;isomer of the ligand does not form any well&#8208;defined structures and has a thermal half&#8208;life of 25 days at 298K. This approach shows how a thermodynamically preferred self&#8208;assembled structure can be reversibly pumped to a kinetic trap by small perturbations of the isomer distribution using non&#8208;destructive visible light.</dc:description>

Combining the  E  -isomer with palladium(II) salts affords a double-walled triangle with composition [Pd  3  L  6  ]  6+  and a distorted tetrahedron [Pd  4  L  8  ]  8+  (1:2 ratio at 298 K). Irradiation with 410&#160;nm light generates a photostationary state with ~80% of the  E-  isomer of the ligand and results in the selective disassembly of the tetrahedron, the more thermodynamically stable structure, and the formation of the triangle, the more kinetically inert product. The triangle is then slowly transformed back into the tetrahedron over 2 days at 333 K. The  Z  -isomer of the ligand does not form any well-defined structures and has a thermal half-life of 25 days at 298K. This approach shows how a thermodynamically preferred self-assembled structure can be reversibly pumped to a kinetic trap by small perturbations of the isomer distribution using non-destructive visible light.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Decisive Role of Spin&#8208;States and Spin&#8208;Coupling in Dictating Selective O2 Adsorption in Chromium(II) MOF</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Coordinatively unsaturated Chromium (II)&#8208;based Cr  3  [(Cr  4  Cl)  3  (BTT)  8  ]  2  (Cr&#8208;BTT; BTT  3&#8208;  =1,3,5&#8208;benzenetristetrazolate) metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) has been shown to exhibit exceptional selectivity towards adsorption of O  2  over N  2  /H  2  . Using periodic Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations, we attempt to decipher the origin of this puzzling selectivity. By computing and analyzing the magnetic exchange coupling, binding energies, the partial density of states (pDOS), and adsorption isotherms for the pristine and gas bound MOFs [(Cr  4  (X)  4  Cl)  3  (BTT)  8  ]  3&#8208;  (X=O  2  , N  2  , and H  2  ), we unequivocally establish the role of spin&#8208;states and spin&#8208;coupling in controlling the gas selectivity. The computed geometries and gas adsorption isotherms are consistent with the earlier experiments. The O  2  binding to the MOF follows an electron&#8208;transfer mechanism resulting in a Cr(III) superoxo species (O  2  &#8208;&#8226;  ) with a very strong antiferromagnetic coupling between the two centers, while N  2  /H  2  found to weakly interact with the metal centre and hence only slightly perturb the associated coupling constants. Although the gas bound and unbound MOFs have S =0 ground state (GS), the nature of spin configurations and the associated magnetic exchanges are dramatically different. The binding energy and the number of oxygen molecules that can favorably bind to the Cr center were found to vary with respect to the spin&#8208;state with a significant energy margin (47.6 kJ/mol). This study offers a hitherto unknown strategy of utilizing spin&#8208;state/spin&#8208;couplings to control gas adsorption selectivity in MOFs.</dc:description>

         <title>A Mechanism for Nitrogenase Including a Loss of a Sulfide.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nitrogenase is the only enzyme in nature that can fix N  2  from the air. The active cofactor of the leading form of this enzyme contains seven irons and one molybdenum, connected by sulfide bridges. In several recent experimental studies it has been suggested that the cofactor is very flexible, and may lose one of its sulfides during catalysis. In the present study, the possible loss of a sulfide has been investigated by model calculations. In previous studies we have shown that there should be four activation steps before catalysis starts and the present study is based on that finding. It is here found that after the four reductions in the activation steps, a sulfide will become very loosely bound, and can be released in a quite exergonic step with a low barrier. The binding of N  2  has no part in that release. In our previous studies we have suggested that the central carbide should be protonated three times after the four activation steps. With the present finding, there will instead be a loss of a sulfide, since the barrier for the loss is much lower than the ones for protonating the carbide. Still, it is here suggested that the carbide will anyway be protonated, but only with one proton, in the E  3  to E  4  step. A very complicated transition state for H  2  formation involving a large structural change has been obtained. The combined step with a loss of H  2  and binding of N  2  is calculated to be endergonic by +2.3 kcal/mol, in excellent agreement with experiments where an easily reversible step has been found.</dc:description>

         <title>Substituent Effects of Tetracoordinate Boron in Organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Promotion by substituents: Tetracoordinate boryl groups stabilize or activate reactive intermediates, such as cations, radicals and &#960;&#8208;conjugation systems, as electron&#8208;donating groups. This review mainly focuses on reactions promoted by such substituent effects of tetracoordinate boryl groups in organic synthesis.







Abstract
The present review focuses on recent examples of tetracoordinate boryl groups greatly influencing reactions in organic synthesis. Electron&#8208;rich tetracoordinate boryl groups stabilize or activate reactive intermediates such as cations, radicals and &#960;&#8208;conjugation systems, and interaction of the intermediates with carbon&#8208;boron or heteroatom&#8208;boron bonds is the origin of such substituent effects. Unique substituent effects of tetracoordinate boryl groups often promote desired reactions and affect results of reactions such as yield and selectivity of products.

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;Driven Molecular Switches and Motors: Recent Developments and Applications</title>

This Review discusses the recent developments in the synthesis and applications of visible light&#8208;driven molecular switches and motors and provides a perspective on their future challenges and opportunities.







Abstract
Inspired by human vision, a diverse range of light&#8208;driven molecular switches and motors have been developed for fundamental understanding and application in material science and biology. Recently, the design and synthesis of visible light&#8208;driven molecular switches and motors have been actively pursued. This emerging trend is partly motivated to avoid the harmful effects of ultraviolet light, which was necessary to drive the classical molecular switches and motors at least in one direction, impeding their employment in biomedical and photopharmacology applications. Moreover, visible light&#8208;driven molecular switches and motors are demonstrated to enable benign optical materials for advanced photonic devices. Therefore, during the past several years, visible light&#8208;driven molecular switches based on azobenzene derivatives, diarylethenes, 1,2&#8208;dicyanodithienylethenes, hemithioindigo derivatives, iminothioindoxyls, donor&#8208;acceptor Stenhouse adducts, and overcrowded alkene based molecular motors have been judiciously designed, synthesized, and used in the development of functional materials and systems for a wide range of applications. In this Review, we present the recent developments toward the design of visible light&#8208;driven molecular switches and motors, with their applications in the fabrication of functional materials and systems in material science, bioscience, pharmacology, etc. The visible light&#8208;driven molecular switches and motors realized so far undoubtedly widen the scope of these interesting compounds for technological and biological applications. We hope this Review article could provide additional impetus and inspire further research interests for future exploration of visible light&#8208;driven advanced materials, systems, and devices.

         <title>211At and 125I&#8208;Labeling of (Hetero)Aryliodonium Ylides: Astatine Wins Again</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The nucleophilic 211At&#8208;labeling of aryliodonium ylides was investigated and proved significantly more efficient than radioiodination. Reaction is rapid at room temperature with electron&#8208;poor activated substrates whereas heating and addition of the radical scavenger TEMPO was essential in the case of deactivated precursors to reach high RCY and molar activity.







Abstract
Despite the growing interest in radioiodine and 211At&#8208;labeled radiopharmaceuticals, the search for radiolabeling reactions has been somewhat neglected, resulting in a limited number of available radiosynthetic strategies. Herein we report a comparative study of nucleophilic 125I and 211At&#8208;labeling of aryliodonium ylides. Whereas radioiodination efficiency was low, 211At&#8208;labeling performed efficiently on a broad scope of precursors. The most activated aryliodonium ylides led rapidly to quantitative reactions at room temperature in acetonitrile. For deactivated precursors, heating up to 90&#8201;&#176;C in glyme and addition of 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidine&#8208;1&#8208;oxyl (TEMPO) as radical scavenger appeared essential to avoid precursor degradation and to achieve high radiochemical yields and molar activity. The approach was applied successfully to the preparation of 4&#8208;[211At]astatophenylalanine (4&#8208;APA), an amino acid derivative increasingly studied as radiotherapeutic drug for cancers. This validated aryliodonium ylides as a valuable tool for nucleophilic 211At&#8208;labeling and will complement the short but now growing list of available astatination reactions.

This validated aryliodonium ylides as a valuable tool for nucleophilic &lt;sup&gt;211&lt;/sup&gt;At-labeling and will complement the short but now growing list of available astatination reactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cationic Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Decarbonylative Aryl Addition of Aromatic Aldehydes to Bicyclic Alkenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Building bridges: We have developed an unprecedented asymmetric decarbonylative aryl addition of an aromatic aldehyde to bicyclic alkenes, catalyzed by chiral cationic iridium. This process provides efficient access to a wide variety of enantioenriched bridged bicyclic systems from aromatic aldehydes in high yields and with excellent enantioselectivities (up to 90&#8201;% yield and up to 99&#8201;%&#8201;ee).







Abstract
We report an unprecedented catalytic protocol for the enantioselective decarbonylative transformation of aryl aldehydes. In this process, the decarbonylation of aldehydes catalyzed by chiral iridium complexes enabled the formation of asymmetric C&#8722;C bonds through the formation of an aryl&#8722;iridium intermediate. The decarbonylative aryl addition to bicyclic alkenes was fluidly performed without a stoichiometric aryl&#8722;metal reagent, such as aryl boronic acid, with a cationic iridium complex generated in&#8197;situ from Ir(cod)2(BArF4) and the sulfur&#8208;linked bis(phosphoramidite) ligand ((R,R)&#8208;S&#8722;Me&#8722;BIPAM). This reaction has broad functional group compatibility, and no waste is generated, except carbon monoxide.

         <title>Hydrazone Photoswitches for Structural Modulation of Short Peptides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Development of new photoswitches that can modulate biomolecules has been of consistent interest. Herein, it is shown that installation of amide substituents at different position(s) of hydrazone photoswitches does not cause a significant change in E/Z photoswitching behaviors. It is also demonstrated that a hydrazone switch comprising an upper phenyl ring and a lower quinolinyl ring is effective for structural control of short peptides.







Abstract
Molecules that undergo light&#8208;driven structural transformations constitute the core components in photoswitchable molecular systems and materials. Among various families of photoswitches, photochromic hydrazones have recently emerged as a novel class of photoswitches with superb properties, such as high photochemical conversion, spectral tunability, thermal stability, and fatigue resistance. Hydrazone photoswitches have been adopted in various adaptive materials at different length scales, however, their utilization for modulating biomolecules still has not been explored. Herein, we present new hydrazone switches that can photomodulate the structures of short peptides. Systematic investigation on a set of hydrazone derivatives revealed that installation of the amide group does not significantly alter the photoswitching behaviors. Importantly, a hydrazone switch comprising an upper phenyl ring and a lower quinolinyl ring was effective for structural control of peptides. We anticipate that this work, as a new milestone in the research of hydrazone switches, will open a new avenue for structural and functional control of biomolecules.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Cascade C&#8722;H Functionalization/Asymmetric Allylation Reaction of Aryl &#945;&#8208;Diazoamides and Allenes: Lewis Acid Makes a Difference</title>

         <dc:description>
An achiral Lewis acid enables chiral palladium complex&#8208;catalyzed cascade C&#8722;H functionalization/asymmetric allylation reaction of aryl &#945;&#8208;diazoamides and allenes to give synthetically useful chiral 3,3&#8208;disubstituted oxindole derivatives in enhanced yield and enantioselectivity (up to 93&#8201;% ee).







Abstract
A Pd&#8208;catalyzed cascade C&#8722;H functionalization/asymmetric allylation reaction with aryl &#945;&#8208;diazoamides and allenes has been developed. The reaction provides an efficient approach to construct chiral 3,3&#8208;disubstituted oxindole derivatives in high levels of yield and enantioselectivity (up to 93&#8201;% ee). Notably, the chromium complex works as Lewis acid to facilitate the formation of palladium carbene and to enhance acidity of carboxylic acid, allowing for higher stereochemical control and efficiency.

         <title>Continuous Flow Bioconjugations of NIR&#8208;AZA Fluorophores via Strained Alkyne Cycloadditions with Intra&#8208;Chip Fluorogenic Monitoring**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Continuous in&#8208;flow fluorogenic bioconjugations are achievable in five minutes under mild conditions with real&#8208;time intra&#8208;chip reaction progress monitoring. The use of a fluorogenic tetrazine fluorophore, in a glass channelled reactor chip, allowed for intra&#8208;chip reaction monitoring by recording fluorescence intensities at various positions throughout the chip. As the inverse electron demand Diels&#8208;Alder reactions proceeded through the chip, the fluorescence intensity increased accordingly in real&#8208;time.







Abstract
The importance of bioconjugation reactions continues to grow for cell specific targeting and dual therapeutic plus diagnostic medical applications. This necessitates the development of new bioconjugation chemistries, in&#8208;flow synthetic and analytical methods. With this goal, continuous flow bioconjugations were readily achieved with short residence times for strained alkyne substituted carbohydrate and therapeutic peptide biomolecules in reaction with azide and tetrazine substituted fluorophores. The strained alkyne substrates included substituted 2&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;&#945;&#8208;D&#8208;glucopyranose, and the linear and cyclic peptide sequences QIRQQPRDPPTETLELEVSPDPAS&#8208;OH and c(RGDfK) respectively. The catalyst and reagent&#8208;free inverse electron demand tetrazine cycloadditions proved more favourable than the azide 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloadditions. Reaction completion was achieved with residence times of 5&#8197;min at 40&#8201;&#176;C for tetrazine versus 10&#8197;min at 80&#8201;&#176;C for azide cycloadditions. The use of a fluorogenic tetrazine fluorophore, in a glass channelled reactor chip, allowed for intra&#8208;chip reaction monitoring by recording fluorescence intensities at various positions throughout the chip. As the Diels&#8208;Alder reactions proceeded through the chip, the fluorescence intensity increased accordingly in real&#8208;time. The application of continuous flow fluorogenic bioconjugations could offer an efficient translational access to theranostic agents.

         <title>Synthesis of Natural Products by C&#8211;H Functionalization of Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Total synthesis is considered by many as the finest combination of art and science. During the last decades, several concepts were proposed for achieving the perfect vision of total synthesis, such as atom economy, step economy, or redox economy. In this context, C&#8211;H functionalization represents the most powerful platform that has emerged in the last years, empowering rapid synthesis of complex natural products and enabling diversification of bioactive scaffolds based on natural product architectures. In this review, we present an overview of the recent strategies towards the total synthesis of heterocyclic natural products enabled by C&#8211;H functionalization. Heterocycles represent the most common motifs in drug discovery and marketed drugs. The implementation of C&#8211;H functionalization of heterocycles enables novel tactics in the construction of core architectures, but also changes the logic design of retrosynthetic strategies and permits access to natural product scaffolds with novel and enhanced biological activities.</dc:description>

         <title>Peptide&#8208;Catalyzed Stereoselective Conjugate Addition Reaction of Aldehydes to C&#8208;Substituted Maleimides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catalytic stereoselective additions with maleimides are useful one&#8208;step reactions to yield chiral succinimides, molecules that are widespread among therapeutically active compounds but challenging to prepare when the maleimide is C&#8208;substituted. We present the tripeptide H&#8208;Pro&#8208;Pro&#8208;Asp&#8208;NHC12H25 as a catalyst for conjugate addition reactions between aldehydes and Csubstituted maleimides to form succinimides with three contiguous stereogenic centers in high yields and stereoselectivities. The peptidic catalyst is so chemoselective that no protecting group is needed at the imide nitrogen of the maleimides. Derivatization of the succinimides was straightforward and provided access to chiral pyrrolidines, lactones, and lactams. Kinetic studies, including a Hammett plot, provided detailed insight into the reaction mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Arylative Cyclizations of Alkyne&#8208; and Allene&#8208;Tethered Electrophiles using Arylboron Reagents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of arylboron reagents in metal&#8208;catalyzed domino addition&#8208;cyclization reactions is a well&#8208;established strategy for the preparation of diverse carbo&#8208; and heterocyclic products. Recent studies have demonstrated nickel catalysis is highly effective in these reactions, in many cases offering unique reactivity and access to products that might otherwise not be readily available using other metal catalysts. This review gives an overview of nickel&#8208;catalyzed arylative cyclizations of alkyne&#8208; and allene&#8208;tethered electrophiles using arylboron reagents.







Abstract
The use of arylboron reagents in metal&#8208;catalyzed domino addition&#8211;cyclization reactions is a well&#8208;established strategy for the preparation of diverse, highly functionalized carbo&#8208; and heterocyclic products. Although rhodium&#8208; and palladium&#8208;based catalysts have been commonly used for these reactions, more recent work has demonstrated nickel catalysis is also highly effective, in many cases offering unique reactivity and access to products that might otherwise not be readily available. This review gives an overview of nickel&#8208;catalyzed arylative cyclizations of alkyne&#8208; and allene&#8208;tethered electrophiles using arylboron reagents. The scope of the reactions is discussed in detail, and general mechanistic concepts underpinning the processes are described.

         <title>Assessing Alkali&#8208;Metal Effects in the Structures and Reactivity of Mixed&#8208;Ligand Alkyl/Alkoxide Alkali&#8208;Metal Magnesiates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis and isolation of several new mixed alkyl/alkoxide alkali&#8208;metal magnesiates have allowed for assessing their stability in solution and their reactivity towards Mg&#8722;Br exchange using 2&#8208;bromoanisole as a model substrate. Revealing a pronounced alkali&#8208;metal effect, potassium magnesiates are more powerful exchange reagents although the constitution of the final products in these reactions is strongly dependent on the nature of the alkoxide employed.







Abstract
Advancing the understanding of using alkali&#8208;metal alkoxides as additives to organomagnesium reagents in Mg&#8722;Br exchange reactions, a homologous series of mixed&#8208;ligand alkyl/alkoxide alkali&#8208;metal magnesiates [MMg(CH2SiMe3)2(dmem)]2 [dmem=2&#8208;{[2&#8208;(dimethylamino)ethyl]methylamino} ethoxide; M=Li, 1; Na, 2; (THF)K, 3] has been prepared. Structural and spectroscopic studies have established the constitutions of these heteroleptic/heterometallic species, which are retained in arene solution. Evaluation of their reactivity towards 2&#8208;bromoanisole has uncovered a marked alkali&#8208;metal effect with potassium magnesiate 3 being the most efficient of the three ate reagents. Studies probing the constitution of the exchange product from this reaction suggest that the putative [KMgAr2(dmem)]2 (Ar=o&#8208;OMe&#8722;C6H4) intermediate undergoes redistribution into its single metal components [KAr]n and [MgAr(dmem)]2 (5). This process can be circumvented by using a different potassium alkoxide containing an aliphatic chain such as KOR&#8217; (R&#8217;=2&#8208;ethylhexyl) which undergoes co&#8208;complexation with Mg(CH2SiMe3) to give [KMg(CH2SiMe3)2(OR&#8217;)]2 (7). This ate, in turn, reacts quantitatively with 2&#8208;bromoanisole furnishing [KMgAr2(OR&#8217;)]2 (9) which is stable in solution as a bimetallic compound. Collectively this work highlights the complexity of these alkali&#8208;metal mediated Mg&#8722;Br exchange reactions, where each reaction component can have a profound effect not only on the success of the reaction; but also the stability of the final metalated intermediates prior to their electrophilic interception.

         <title>Combined in Silico and in Vitro Approaches To Uncover the Oxidation and Schiff Base Reaction of Baicalein as an Inhibitor of Amyloid Protein Aggregation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The oxidation of baicalein and subsequent Schiff base reaction with pentylamine (lysine side&#8208;chain model) have been assessed by computational and experimental approaches. The reaction proceeds through initial ion pair formation followed by a redox chain reaction. The atomistic mechanistic findings (transient intermediates) can be used in drug design campaigns against amyloidogenesis.







Abstract
The oxidized form of baicalein (BA) leads to covalent binding with human amyloid proteins. Such adducts hamper the aggregation and deposition of fibrils. A novel reaction of BA with pentylamine (PA) as a model for the lysine side chain is described. This is the first study addressing the atomistic details of a Schiff base reaction with the trihydroxylated moiety of BA. Nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectrometry approaches clearly indicate the formation of dehydrobaicalein in solution as well as its condensation with PA under aerobic conditions, yielding regioselectively C6&#8208;substituted products. The combined results suggest initial ion pair formation between BA and PA, followed by a redox chain reaction: the initiation by oxygen/air; an o&#8208;quinone&#8208;based chain involving oxidation and reduction steps; and extra off&#8208;chain formation of a doubly oxidized product. These mechanistic details support the anti&#8208;amyloid activity of BA and endorse its trihydroxyphenyl moiety as a pharmacophore for drug&#8208;design studies.

         <title>Weak Antiferromagnetic Exchange and Ferromagnetic Alignment of FeII (S=2) Spins in Differently Charged {HAT&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;(FeIICl2)3}n (n=2&#8208; and 3&#8208;) Assemblies of Hexaazatriphenylenes (HAT)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hexaazatrianthracene (HATA) and hexaazatriphenylene&#8208;hexacarbonitrile {HAT(CN)6} ligands form coordination complexes with high&#8208;spin (S=2) FeII atoms in dianion and radical&#8208;trianion states. This provides weak antiferromagnetic exchange or ferromagnetic alignment of the FeII spins within the coordination assemblies.







Abstract
Hexaazatrianthracene (HATA) and hexaazatriphenylenehexacarbonitrile {HAT(CN)6} are reduced by metallic iron in the presence of crystal violet (CV+)(Cl&#8722;). Anionic ligands are produced, which simultaneously coordinate three FeIICl2 to form (CV+)2{HATA&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;(FeIICl2)3}2&#8722;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;3&#8197;C6H4Cl2 (1) and (CV+)3{HAT(CN)6. (FeIICl2)3}3&#8722;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;0.5CVCl&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2.5&#8197;C6H4Cl2 (2). High&#8208;spin (S=2) FeII atoms in both structures are arranged in equilateral triangles at a distance of 7&#8197;&#197;. An antiferromagnetic exchange is observed between FeII in {HATA&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;(FeIICl2)3}2&#8722; (1) with a Weiss temperature (&#920;) of &#8722;80&#8197;K, the PHI estimated exchange interaction (J) is &#8722;4.7&#8197;cm&#8722;1. The {HAT(CN)6&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;(FeIICl2)3}3&#8722; assembly is obtained in 2. The formation of HAT(CN)6.3&#8722; is supported by the appearance of an intense EPR signal with g=2.0037. The magnetic behavior of 2 is described by a strong antiferromagnetic coupling between the FeII and HAT(CN)6.3&#8722; spins with J1=&#8722;164&#8197;cm&#8722;1 (&#8722;2&#8197;J formalism) and by a weaker antiferromagnetic coupling between the FeII spins with J2=&#8722;15.4&#8197;cm&#8722;1. The stronger coupling results in the spins of the three FeIICl2 units to be aligned parallel to each other in the assembly. As a result, an increase of the &#967;MT values is observed with the decrease of temperature from 9.82 at 300&#8197;K up to 15.06&#8197;emu&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;K/mol at 6&#8197;K, and the Weiss temperature is also positive being at +23&#8197;K. Thus, a change in the charge and spin state of the HAT&#8208;type ligand to &#8901;3&#8722; results in ferromagnetic alignment of the FeII spins, yielding a high&#8208;spin (S=11/2) system. DFT calculations showed that, due to the high symmetry and nearly degenerated LUMO of both HATA and HAT(CN)6, their complexes with FeIICl2 have a variety of closely lying excited high&#8208;spin states with multiplicity up to S=15/2.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal complexes of multi&#8208;porphyrins and multi&#8208;corroles are unique systems that display a host of extremely interesting properties. Availability of free  meso  and b positions allow formation of different types of directly linked bis&#8208;porphyrins giving rise to intriguing optical and electronic properties. While the fields of metalloporphyrin and corroles monomer have seen exponential growth in the last decades, the chemistry of metal complexes of bis&#8208;porphyrins and bis&#8208;corroles remain rather underexplored. Therefore, the impact of covalent linkages on the optical, electronic, (spectro)electrochemical, magnetic and electrocatalytic activities of metal complexes of bis&#8208;porphyrins and &#8208;corroles has been summarized in this review article. This article shows that despite the (still) somewhat difficult synthetic access to these molecules, their extremely exciting properties do make a strong case for pursuing research on these classes of compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral Ligand&#8208;Driven Systematic Synthesis of Coordination Polymers with Noncentrosymmetric Structures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chirality is an important concept in chemistry revealing intriguing optical properties such as circular dichroism (CD), circularly polarized luminescence (CPL), etc. As one of the noncentrosymmmetric (NCS) classes, chiral materials with extended structures may exhibit unique nonlinear optical (NLO) properties, i.e., second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG). In this Concept article, a series of recently discovered NCS coordination polymers (CPs) by using carefully designed chiral organic ligands are reviewed. Combining several metal cations such as lanthanides, lead, zinc, and cadmium with rigid chiral ligands have resulted in interesting CPs with both polar and nonpolar structures. Detailed structures, SHG properties, and structure&#8208;property relationships are provided. The importance of hyperpolarizability formed by intermolecular hydrogen boding interactions to SHG is emphasized.</dc:description>

         <title>Influence of the Flexibility of Nickel PCP&#8208;Pincer Complexes on C&#8722;H and P&#8722;C Bond Activation and Ethylene Reactivity: A Combined Experimental and Theoretical Investigation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A combined experimental/theoretical study of Ni pincer complexes with a bridgehead pyrimidine&#8208;based NHC and arylphosphino side arms revealed unique features about stepwise C&#8722;H activation, ethylene insertion into the Ni&#8722;H bond of an isolated complex followed by ethyl migration with C&#8722;CNHC coupling, and an unprecedented C&#8722;P bond activation affording through PPh2 migration a NiII complex with a terminal phosphanido ligand and a new C&#8722;CNHC&#8722;P pincer ligand.







Abstract
Using a pincer platform based on a bridgehead NHC donor with functional side arms, the combined effect of increased flexibility in six&#8208;membered pyrimidine&#8208;type heterocycles compared to the more often studied five&#8208;membered imidazole, and rigidity of phosphane side arms was examined. The unique features observed include: 1) the reaction of the azolium Csp2&#8722;H bond with [Ni(cod)2] affording a carbanionic ligand in [NiCl(PCsp3HP)] (8) rather than a carbene; 2) its transformation into the NHC, hydrido complex [NiH(PCNHCP)]PF6 (9) upon halide abstraction; 3) ethylene insertion into the Ni&#8722;H bond of the latter and ethyl migration to the N&#8722;C&#8722;N carbon atom of the heterocycle in [Ni(PCEtP)]PF6 (10); and 4) an unprecedented C&#8722;P bond activation transforming the P&#8722;CNHC&#8722;P pincer ligand of 8 in a C&#8722;CNHC&#8722;P pincer and a terminal phosphanido ligand in [Ni(PPh2)(CCNHCP)] (15). The data are supported by nine crystal structure determinations and theoretical calculations provided insights into the mechanisms of these transformations, which are relevant to stoichiometric and catalytic steps of general interest.

         <title>Selective Encapsulation and Unusual Stabilization of cis&#8208;Isomers by a Spherical Polyaromatic Cavity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thanks to a polyaromatic capsule, an azobenzene derivative is quantitatively encapsulated by the spherical cavity with 100&#8201;% cis&#8208;selectivity. The cis&#8208;to&#8208;trans isomerization is suppressed against heat and light due to the confined cavity effect. C,N&#8208;diphenyl imines are also encapsulated by the capsule and adopt an otherwise unstable cis&#8208;form. The cavity suppresses their hydrolysis in water due to the shielding effect.







Abstract
To explore new cavity functions, we herein employed cis&#8208;trans stereoisomers with a N=N, C=C, or C=N unit as guest indicators for a polyaromatic capsule. Thanks to the rigid, spherical cavity with a diameter of &#8764;1&#8197;nm, azobenzene and stilbene derivatives are quantitatively encapsulated by the capsule with 100&#8201;% cis&#8208;selectivity in water. The isomerization of the cis&#8208;azo compound is suppressed against heat and light in the cavity, due to the confinement effect. Furthermore, C,N&#8208;diphenyl imine derivatives are quantitatively encapsulated by the capsule in water and adopt an otherwise unstable cis&#8208;form. The polyaromatic cavity suppresses the hydrolysis of the imines in water, even at elevated temperature, due to the shielding effect. Accordingly, the properties of the cis&#8208;trans isomers could be largely altered through supramolecular manipulation.

         <title>Rearrangements in Scholl Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review portrays rearrangements with substrates of various genres in Scholl reaction. The rearranged products formed due to automerization, migration of substituents, rearrangement accompanied by cyclization, ring expansion, and ring contraction under Scholl&#8208;type reactions are gathered. In cases where new ring is constructed, they are grouped based on ring size. The crucial factors that drive rearrangements via enigmatic intermediates and the methods for successful prevention of rearrangements are also discussed.







Abstract
Rearrangements in Scholl reaction are mostly serendipitous. The design of molecular precursors is what seems to guide the course of rearrangement. This review consolidates different classes of precursors used in Scholl reaction and their accompanying rearrangements that include aryl migration, migration followed by cyclization and skeletal rearrangements involving ring expansion, ring contraction and both, under the reaction conditions. The attempt in collating heretofore&#8208;reported examples in this review is to guide designing appropriate precursors to predictably achieve complex molecular structures or nanographenes or defect&#8208;nanographenes via rearrangement.

Abstract
Temperature monitoring in&#8197;vivo plays a vital role in the investigation of biological processes of organisms and the improvement of disease theranostic methods. The development of lanthanide luminescent nanocomposite&#8208;derived temperature probes in&#8197;vivo allows accurate and reliable interrogation of biological thermodynamic processes due to their superior photostability, high sensitivity, and non&#8208;invasive sensing fashion. This concept presented an overview of the recent development of lanthanide luminescent nanocomposite which are suitable for in&#8197;vivo temperature monitoring, including the thermometric principles, key features, materials designs as well as their potential biomedical applications for non&#8208;invasive temperature detection in the living body. The perspectives of these lanthanide luminescent nanocomposite thermometers for the optimization of temperature monitoring performance and potential future development are also discussed.

         <title>Properties of the Reactants and Their Interactions within and with the Enzyme Binding Cavity Determine Reaction Selectivities. The Case of Fe(II)/2&#8208;Oxoglutarate Dependent Enzymes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fe(II)/2&#8208;oxoglutarate dependent dioxygenases catalyse with high specificity a variety of oxidative transformations of their substrates. This review provides a survey of computational and experimental studies revealing structural and electronic factors responsible for a broad scope of chemistry performed by this class of enzymes. These factors encompass inherent properties of ferryl species and organic substrates, steric hindrance imposed by the enzyme, specific enzyme&#8208;substrate interactions and substrate's conformational freedom within the binding cavity.







Abstract
Fe(II)/2&#8208;oxoglutarate dependent dioxygenases (ODDs) share a double stranded beta helix (DSBH) fold and utilise a common reactive intermediate, ferryl species, to catalyse oxidative transformations of substrates. Despite the structural similarities, ODDs accept a variety of substrates and facilitate a wide range of reactions, that is hydroxylations, desaturations, (oxa)cyclisations and ring rearrangements. In this review we present and discuss the factors contributing to the observed (regio)selectivities of ODDs. They span from inherent properties of the reactants, that is, substrate molecule and iron cofactor, to the interactions between the substrate and the enzyme's binding cavity; the latter can counterbalance the effect of the former. Based on results of both experimental and computational studies dedicated to ODDs, we also line out the properties of the reactants which promote reaction outcomes other than the &#8220;default&#8221; hydroxylation. It turns out that the reaction selectivity depends on a delicate balance of interactions between the components of the investigated system.

         <title>Developing the Low&#8208;Temperature Oxidation Mechanism of Cyclopentane: An Experimental and Theoretical Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A homemade MB&#8208;VUV&#8208;PI&#8208;TOFMS is used to observe the low&#8208;temperature oxidation products of cyclopentane, including cyclic olefins, cyclic ethers, and highly oxygenated intermediates (ketohydroperoxide KHP, keto&#8208;dihydroperoxide KDHP), at a total pressure of 1&#8211;3&#8197;atm and a low temperature range between 500 and 800&#8197;K. The low&#8208;temperature oxidation mechanism of CPT was studied by experimental and theoretical analyses.







Abstract
At present, the reactivity of cyclic alkanes is estimated by comparison with acyclic hydrocarbons. Due to the difference in the structure of cycloalkanes and acycloalkanes, the thermodynamic data obtained by analogy are not applicable. In this study, a molecular beam sampling vacuum ultraviolet photoionization time&#8208;of&#8208;flight mass spectrometer (MB&#8208;VUV&#8208;PI&#8208;TOFMS) was applied to study the low&#8208;temperature oxidation of cyclopentane (CPT) at a total pressure range from 1&#8211;3&#8197;atm and low&#8208;temperature range between 500 and 800&#8197;K. Low&#8208;temperature reaction products including cyclic olefins, cyclic ethers, and highly oxygenated intermediates (e.&#8201;g., ketohydroperoxide KHP, keto&#8208;dihydroperoxide KDHP, olefinic hydroperoxides OHP and ketone structure products) were observed. Further investigation of the oxidation of CPT &#8211; electronic structure calculations &#8211; were carried out at the UCCSD(T)&#8208;F12a/aug&#8208;cc&#8208;pVDZ//B3LYP/6&#8208;31+ G(d,p) level to explore the reactivity of O2 molecules adding sequentially to cyclopentyl radicals. Experimental and theoretical observations showed that the dominant product channel in the reaction of CPT radicals with O2 is HO2 elimination yielding cyclopentene. The pathways of second and third O2 addition &#8211; the dissociation of hydroperoxide &#8211; were further confirmed. The results of this study will develop the low&#8208;temperature oxidation mechanism of CPT, which can be used for future research on accurately simulating the combustion process of CPT.

         <title>A Modular Synthesis of Substituted Cycloparaphenylenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new synthesis provides access to different sized substituted cycloparaphenylenes (CPPs). The use of a key synthon in a sequence of macrocyclization by cross&#8208;coupling with different reaction partners followed by aromatization allows a modular build&#8208;up. The controlled introduction of substituents enables a tube&#8208;like arrangement of these molecular carbon allotropes in the solid state.







Abstract
Herein, we report a modular synthesis providing access to substituted cycloparaphenylenes (CPPs) of different sizes. A key synthon introducing two geminal ester units was efficiently prepared by [2+2+2] cycloaddition. This building block can be conveniently converted to macrocyclic precursors controlling the ring size of the final CPP. Efficient reductive aromatization through single&#8208;electron transfer provided the substituted nanohoops in a straightforward manner. The tBu ester substitution pattern enables a tube&#8208;like arrangement in the solid&#8208;state governed by van der Waals interactions that exhibits one of the tightest packings of CPPs in tube direction, thus opening new avenues in the crystal design of CPPs.

         <title>Evidence for Charge Delocalization in Diazafluorene Ligands Supporting Low&#8208;Valent [Cp*Rh] Complexes**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
4,5&#8208;Diazafluorene&#8208;based ligands are notable analogues of the workhorse 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridyls, but little is known about their ability to stabilize reduced organometallic complexes. Here, synthetic, structural, and electrochemical studies of [Cp*Rh] complexes bearing 9,9&#8242;&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;4,5&#8208;diazafluorene (Me2daf) and related analogues have been used to show that Me2daf can stabilize electron&#8208;rich species through &#960;&#8208;backbonding and concomitant charge delocalization. In light of this, Me2daf can be concluded to be a promising building block for applications in reductive chemistry and catalysis.







Abstract
Ligands based upon the 4,5&#8208;diazafluorene core are an important class of emerging ligands in organometallic chemistry, but the structure and electronic properties of these ligands have received less attention than they deserve. Here, we show that 9,9&#8242;&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;4,5&#8208;diazafluorene (Me2daf) can stabilize low&#8208;valent complexes through charge delocalization into its conjugated &#960;&#8208;system. Using a new platform of [Cp*Rh] complexes with three accessible formal oxidation states (+III, +II, and +I), we show that the methylation in Me2daf is protective, blocking Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;base chemistry commonly encountered with other daf&#8208;based ligands. Electronic absorption spectroscopy and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis of a family of eleven new compounds, including the unusual Cp*Rh(Me2daf), reveal features consistent with charge delocalization driven by &#960;&#8208;backbonding into the LUMO of Me2daf, reminiscent of behavior displayed by the workhorse 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridyl ligand. Taken together with spectrochemical data demonstrating clean conversion between oxidation states, our findings show that 9,9&#8242;&#8208;dialkylated daf&#8208;type ligands are promising building blocks for applications in reductive chemistry and catalysis.

         <title>Enantioselective Total Synthesis of (+)&#8208;Eucophylline</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The total enantioselective synthesis of (+)&#8208;eucophylline  1  was achieved using as a key&#8208;structural motif a chiral piperidinone bearing the natural product all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenter. The elaboration of the latter is based on two strategies relying on the free&#8208;radical carbo&#8208;cyanation and sulfonyl&#8208;cyanation respectively of enantiopure substituted cyclopropenes and cyclobutenes. Co&#8208; or Ni&#8208;boride reduction of the nitrile functional group along with the cyclopropane and cyclobutane ring&#8208;opening then led to the formation of the chiral piperidinone ring. Further elaboration of the latter into the key 1&#8208;azabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane motif followed by its coupling with a 2&#8208;cyanoaniline allowed the formation of the tetrahydrobenzo[  b  ][1,8]&#8208;naphthyridine skeleton of  1  , which was finally accessible in 17 steps and 5.9% overall yield from 1,1&#8208;dibromobutene.</dc:description>

         <title>Tetra&#8208;Substituted p&#8208;Tert&#8208;Butylcalix[4]Arene with Phosphoryl and Salicylamide Functional Groups: Synthesis, Complexation and Selective Extraction of f&#8208;Element Cations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The tetra&#8208;substituted bifunctional calixarene ligand H2L is an effective extraction agent for selective removal of uranyl salts from aqueous rare&#8208;earth containing solutions. As the separation factor &#223;U/Ln is &#8764;100 in a weakly acidic pH range, a complete separation of uranyl from aqueous trivalent lanthanide solutions is expected to be achieved with few separation steps. The separation factors at pH&#8197;6.0 are 121 (UO22+/La3+) and 70 (UO22+/Yb3+)!







Abstract
A new series of lanthanide (1&#8211;5) and uranyl (6) complexes with a tetra&#8208;substituted bifunctional calixarene ligand H2L is described. The coordination environment for the Ln3+ and UO22+ ions is provided by phosphoryl and salicylamide functional groups appended to the lower rim of the p&#8208;tert&#8208;butylcalix[4]arene scaffold. Ligand interactions with lanthanide cations (light: La3+, Pr3+; intermediate: Eu3+ and Gd3+; and heavy: Yb3+), as well as the uranyl cation (UO22+) is examined in the solution and solid state, respectively with spectrophotometric titration and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffractometry. The ligand is fully deprotonated in the complexation of trivalent lanthanide ions forming di&#8208;cationic complexes 2&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8197;M&#8201;:&#8201;L, [Ln2(L)2(H2O)]2+ (1&#8211;5), in solution, whereas uranyl formed a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8197;M&#8201;:&#8201;L complex [UO2(L)(MeOH)]&#8734; (6) that demonstrated very limited solubility in 12 organic solvents. Solvent extraction behaviour is examined for cation selectivity and extraction efficiency. H2L was found to be an effective extracting agent for UO22+ over La3+ and Yb3+ cations.

The compound Li5SnP3 completes for x=0 the series Li10+4xSn2&#8722;xP6 (x=0&#8211;1) of lithium&#8208;ion conducting phosphidostannates. The thorough investigation of the crystal structure as well as the materials properties applying X&#8208;ray diffraction as well as NMR and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy allows for a detailed comparison of the materials structure&#8208;property relationships, and thus, improves the understanding of the conduction mechanism within solid ion conductors.







Abstract
The targeted search for suitable solid&#8208;state ionic conductors requires a certain understanding of the conduction mechanism and the correlation of the structures and the resulting properties of the material. Thus, the investigation of various ionic conductors with respect to their structural composition is crucial for the design of next&#8208;generation materials as demanded. We report here on Li5SnP3 which completes with x=0 the series Li10+4xSn2&#8722;xP6 of the fast lithium&#8208;ion conductors &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;Li8SnP4 (x=0.5) and Li14SnP6 (x=1). Synthesis, crystal structure determination by single&#8208;crystal and powder X&#8208;ray diffraction methods, as well as 6Li, 31P and 119Sn MAS NMR and temperature&#8208;dependent 7Li NMR spectroscopy together with electrochemical impedance studies are reported. The correlation between the ionic conductivity and the occupation of octahedral and tetrahedral sites in a close&#8208;packed array of P atoms in the series of compounds is discussed. We conclude from this series that in order to receive fast ion conductors a partial occupation of the octahedral vacancies seems to be crucial.

&lt;p&gt;The targeted search for suitable solid-state ionic conductors requires a certain understanding of the conduction mechanism and the correlation of the structures and the resulting properties of the material.

         <title>Understanding the Influence of Donor&#8208;Acceptor Diazo Compounds on the Catalyst Efficiency of B(C6F5)3 Towards Carbene Formation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Extensive DFT calculations were carried out to interpret electronic effects of the substituents attached (electron donating/withdrawing substituents) to either side of a diazo functionality towards the ease of carbene generation from the corresponding diazo compounds in presence or absence of catalytic amounts of tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane [B(C6F5)3].







Abstract
Diazo compounds have been largely used as carbene precursors for carbene transfer reactions in a variety of functionalization reactions. However, the ease of carbene generation from the corresponding diazo compounds depends upon the electron donating/withdrawing substituents either side of the diazo functionality. These groups strongly impact the ease of N2 release. Recently, tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane [B(C6F5)3] has been shown to be an alternative transition metal&#8208;free catalyst for carbene transfer reactions. Herein, a density functional theory (DFT) study on the generation of carbene species from &#945;&#8208;aryl &#945;&#8208;diazocarbonyl compounds using catalytic amounts of B(C6F5)3 is reported. The significant finding is that the efficiency of the catalyst depends directly on the nature of the substituents on both the aryl ring and the carbonyl group of the substrate. In some cases, the boron catalyst has negligible effect on the ease of the carbene formation, while in other cases there is a dramatic reduction in the activation energy of the reaction. This direct dependence is not commonly observed in catalysis and this finding opens the way for intelligent design of this and other similar catalytic reactions.

         <title>Formation of Supramolecular Nanostructures through in Situ Self&#8208;Assembly and Post&#8208;Assembly Modification of a Biocatalytically Constructed Dipeptide Hydrazide**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The in&#8208;situ self&#8208;assembly of a biocatalytically constructed dipeptide hydrazide gives rise to supramolecular hydrogels consisting of networks of supramolecular nanoarchitectures under mild aqueous conditions. Moreover, post&#8208;assembly modification through hydrazone bond formation enables the decoration of the prefabricated supramolecular architectures. We believe that these findings could extend the molecular toolbox for programmable supramolecular nanostructures guided by protease&#8208;instructed self&#8208;assembly and subsequent post&#8208;assembly modification based on hydrazone formation.







Abstract
Aqueous self&#8208;assembly of short peptides has attracted growing attention for the construction of supramolecular materials for various bioapplications. Herein, we describe how the thermolysin&#8208;assisted biocatalytic construction of a dipeptide hydrazide from an N&#8208;protected amino acid and an amino acid hydrazide leads to the formation of thermally stable supramolecular hydrogels. In addition, we demonstrate the post&#8208;assembly modification of the supramolecular architectures constructed in&#8197;situ tethering hydrazide groups as a chemical handle by means of fluorescence imaging.

         <title>Light&#8208;Sensitive Phenacyl Crosslinked Dextran Hydrogels for Controlled Delivery**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymer phenacyl crosslinked hydrogels that can release doxorubicin, bovine serum albumin and immunoglobulin G by using light (254&#8197;nm&#8211;375&#8197;nm) as a trigger are reported. One crosslinker was designed to optimize the overlap with the Cerenkov luminescence emission window, bearing an &#960;&#8208;extended phenacyl core, resulting in a high quantum yield (QY, 14&#8201;%) of photocleavage when irradiated with 375&#8197;nm light.







Abstract
Stimuli&#8208;responsive soft materials enable controlled release of loaded drug molecules and biomolecules. Controlled release of potent chemotherapeutic or immunotherapeutic agents is crucial to reduce unwanted side effects. In an effort to develop controlled release strategies that can be triggered by using Cerenkov luminescence, we have developed polymer hydrogels that can release bovine serum albumin and immunoglobulin G by using light (254&#8197;nm&#8211;375&#8197;nm) as a trigger. We describe the synthesis and photochemical characterization of two light sensitive phenacyl bis&#8208;azide crosslinkers that are used to prepare transparent self&#8208;supporting hydrogel patches. One crosslinker was designed to optimize the overlap with the Cerenkov luminescence emission window, bearing an &#960;&#8208;extended phenacyl core, resulting in a high quantum yield (14&#8201;%) of photocleavage when irradiated with 375&#8197;nm light. We used the extended phenacyl crosslinker for the preparation of protein&#8208;loaded dextran hydrogel patches, which showed efficient and selective dosed release of bovine serum albumin or immunoglobulin G after irradiation with 375&#8197;nm light. Cerenkov&#8208;triggered release is as yet inconclusive due to unexpected side&#8208;reactivity. Based on the high quantum yield, efficient release and large overlap with the Cerenkov window, we envision application of these photosensitive soft materials in radiation targeted drug release.

         <title>An Adaptive Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework for the Exclusive Recognition of p&#8208;Xylene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An adaptable microporous hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF) has been realized to exhibit the exclusive recognition of p&#8208;xylene over other C8 isomers. The flexible nature of HOF enables specific encapsulation of pX by simultaneously global and local structural transformations and distortions, providing the promise of developing new strategy and flexible HOF materials for those challenging molecular recognition and separations.







Abstract
Separation of xylene isomers is one of the most important but most challenging and energy&#8208;intensive separation processes in the petrochemical industry. Here, we report an adaptive hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF&#8208;29) constructed from a porphyrin based organic building block 4,4&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;(porphyrin&#8208;5,10,15,20&#8208;tetrayl) tetrabenzonitrile (PTTBN), exhibiting the exclusive molecular recognition of p&#8208;xylene (pX) over its isomers of o&#8208;xylene (oX) and m&#8208;xylene (mX), as clearly demonstrated in the single crystal structure transformation and 1H NMR studies. Single crystal structure studies show that single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal transformation from the as&#8208;synthesized HOF&#8208;29 to the pX exclusively included HOF&#8208;29&#8835;pX is triggered by the encapsulation of pX molecules, accompanied by sliding of the 2D layers and local distortion of the ligand, which provides multiple C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions.

Here, we report an adaptive hydrogen-bonded organic framework (HOF-29) constructed from a porphyrin based organic building block 4,4&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;-(porphyrin-5,10,15,20-tetrayl) tetrabenzonitrile (PTTBN), exhibiting the exclusive molecular recognition of &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-xylene (pX) over its isomers of &lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-xylene (oX) and &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;-xylene (mX), as clearly demonstrated in the single crystal structure transformation and &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H NMR studies. Single crystal structure studies show that single-crystal-to-single-crystal transformation from the as-synthesized HOF-29 to the pX exclusively included HOF-29&#8835;pX is triggered by the encapsulation of pX molecules, accompanied by sliding of the 2D layers and local distortion of the ligand, which provides multiple C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Direct Addition of Grignard Reagents to Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids Enabled by Bulky turbo&#8208;Organomagnesium Anilides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Adding the right amount: The addition of Grignard nucleophiles to carboxylic acids is made difficult by the lower nucleophilicity of these abundant organometallics, the low electrophilicity of carboxylate anions, and the faster over&#8208;addition to any ketones produced. Herein we introduce a simple magnesium anilide additive that enhances the nucleophilicity of Grignard reagents towards aliphatic carboxylates and stabilizes the product towards over&#8208;addition side reactions.







Abstract
The synthesis of ketones through addition of organometallic reagents to aliphatic carboxylic acids is a straightforward strategy that is limited to organolithium reagents. More desirable Grignard reagents can be activated and controlled with a bulky aniline&#8208;derived turbo&#8208;Hauser base. This operationally simple procedure allows the straightforward preparation of a variety of aliphatic and perfluoroalkyl ketones alike from functionalized alkyl, aryl and heteroaryl Grignard reagents.

         <title>Exploring the Association of Electron&#8208;Donating Corroles with Phthalocyanines as Electron Acceptors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electron&#8208;donating corroles (Cor) were integrated with electron&#8208;accepting phthalocyanines (Pc) to afford two different non&#8208;covalent Cor&#8226;Pc systems. At the forefront was the coordination between a 10&#8208;  meso  &#8208;pyridine Cor and a ZnPc. The complexation was corroborated in a combination of NMR, absorption, and fluorescence assays, and revealed association with binding constants as high as 10  6  M  &#8208;1  . Steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved spectroscopies evidenced that regardless of exciting Cor or Pc, the charge&#8208;separated state evolved efficiently in both cases, followed by a slow charge&#8208;recombination to reinstate the ground state. The introduction of non&#8208;covalent linkages between Cor and Pc induces appreciable sizeable differences in the context of light harvesting and transfer of charges when compared with covalently linked Cor&#8208;Pc conjugates.</dc:description>

         <title>Enzymatic Synthesis of Variediene Analogs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Five analogs of dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP) with additional or shifted Me groups were converted with isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and the fungal variediene synthase from  Aspergillus brasiliensis  (AbVS). These enzymatic reactions resulted in the formation of several new terpene analogs that were isolated and structurally characterised by NMR spectroscopy. Several DMAPP analogs showed a changed reactivity giving access to compounds with unusual skeletons. Their formation is mechanistically rationalised and the absolute configurations of all obtained compounds were determined through a stereoselective deuteration strategy, revealing absolute configurations that are analogous to that of the natural enzyme product variediene.</dc:description>

         <title>Fibril structure demonstrates the role of iodine labelling on a pentapeptide self&#8208;assembly</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Iodination has long been employed as a successful labelling strategy to gain structural insights into proteins and other biomolecules  via  several techniques, including Small Angle X&#8208;ray Scattering, Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer (ICP&#8208;MS), and single&#8208;crystal crystallography. However, when dealing with smaller biomolecular systems, interactions driven by iodine may significantly alter their self&#8208;assembly behaviour. The engineering of amyloidogenic peptides for the development of ordered nanomaterials has greatly benefitted from this possibility. Still, to date, iodination has exclusively been applied to aromatic residues. In this work, an aliphatic bis&#8208;iodinated amino acid was synthesized and included into a custom pentapeptide, which showed enhanced fibrillogenic behaviour. Peptide single crystal X&#8208;ray structure and powder X&#8208;ray diffraction on its dried water solution demonstrated the key role of iodine atoms in promoting intermolecular interactions that drive the peptide self&#8208;assembly into amyloid fibrils. These findings enlarge the library of halogenated moieties available for directing and engineering the self&#8208;assembly of amyloidogenic peptides.</dc:description>

         <title>A Universal DNA Aptamer that Recognizes Spike Proteins of Diverse SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Variants of Concern</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report on a unique DNA aptamer, denoted MSA52, that displays universally high affinity for the spike proteins of wildtype SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 as well as the Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Epsilon, Kappa and Delta variants. Using an aptamer pool produced from round 13 of selection against the S1 domain of the wildtype spike protein, we carried out one&#8208;round SELEX experiments using five different trimeric spike proteins from variants, followed by high&#8208;throughput sequencing and sequence alignment analysis of aptamers that formed complexes with all proteins. A previously unidentified aptamer, MSA52, showed&#160;  K  d  &#160;values ranging from 2 &#8208; 10 nM for all variant spike proteins, and also bound similarly to variants not present in the reselection experiments. This aptamer also recognized&#160; pseudotyped lentiviruses (PL) expressing eight different spike proteins of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 with&#160;  K  d  &#160;values between 20 &#8208; 50 pM , and was integrated into a simple colorimetric assay for detection of multiple PL variants. &#160;This discovery provides evidence that aptamers can be generated with high affinity to multiple variants of a single protein, including emerging variants, making it well&#8208;suited for molecular recognition of rapidly evolving targets such as those found in SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2.</dc:description>

         <title>Peroxidase&#8208;Mimetic Copper&#8208;doped Carbon&#8208;Dots for Oxidative Stress&#8208;Mediated Broad&#8208;Spectrum and Efficient Antibacterial Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbon dots (CDs) have recently emerged as antibacterial agents and have attracted considerable attention owing to their fascinating merits of small size, facile fabrication, and surface functionalization. Most of them are involved in external light activation or hybridization with other functional nanomaterials. Herein, we present peroxidase&#8208;like Cu&#8208;doped CDs (Cu&#8208;CDs) for in vitro antibacterial applications. The unique peroxidase&#8208;mimicking property of the Cu&#8208;CDs was demonstrated by tetramethylbenzidine chromogenic assay, electron paramagnetic resonance spectra, and hydroxy radical probe. Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus were chosen as representative gram&#8208;negative/positive models against which Cu&#8208;CDs exhibited superior antimicrobial activity even at a dosage down to 5 &#181;g/mL. A possible mechanism of action was that the Cu&#8208;CDs triggered a catalytic redox reaction of endogenous H  2  O  2  and glutathione depletion in the bacteria cells, with subsequent oxidative stress and membrane disruption. This work provides a new strategy for the design of microenvironment&#8208;responsive antimicrobial nano&#8208;agents.</dc:description>

         <title>Cross&#8208;talk Between (Hydrogen)Sulfite and Metalloproteins: Impact on Human Health</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sulfite is a potent toxic substance causing harm to multi&#8208;organ in human. Despite toxicity, it is widely used as preservative, anti&#8208;browning and anti&#8208;oxidant in foods, beverages, and pharmaceuticals, which cause easy admission of sulfite in human. Sulfite is also produced endogenously during the catabolism of cysteine and methionine. In vivo, the serum sulfite level at physiological range is strictly maintained by a molybdenum dependent sulfite oxidase (SO), which catalyzes sulfite to sulfate via two&#8208;electron oxidation pathway. The loss of SO activity causes high serum sulfite level that fosters several diseases, including asthma, neurological dysfunction, birth defects, and heart diseases. The cytotoxicity of (bi)sulfite is implicated as sulfite radicals, which are generated by mainly heme&#8208;peroxidases via one&#8208;electron oxidation pathway. On the other hand, the toxic sulfite radicals are neutralized to sulfite by heme&#8208;globins. The enzymatic reduction of sulfite to sulfide is catalyzed by sulfite reductase, which contains an unusual metal cofactor, siroheme&#8208;[4Fe4S]&#8208;cluster. Overall, the interaction of sulfite with various metalloproteins in vivo is a close relation with human health. Therefore, this review describes the metabolic conversion of (bi)sulfite to sulfate, sulfite radical or sulfide via oxidation or reduction pathways by various metalloproteins (specially SOs, peroxidases, heme&#8208;globins, and sulfite reductases), and the potential applications of sulfite in biosensors/biofuel cells, anti&#8208;browning, and advance oxidation process.</dc:description>

         <title>Expedient synthesis of oxaboracyclic compounds based on naphthalene and biphenyl backbone and phase&#8208;dependent luminescence of their chelate complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The approach to a series of six&#8208; and seven&#8208;membered oxaboraheterocycles based on naphthalene or biphenyl backbones was developed. The key synthetic step involved Br/Li exchange in respective potassium (bromoaryl)trifluoroborates followed by quenching with selected electrophiles (CO  2  , DMF, Me  2  Si(H)Cl) and hydrolytic workup. Two ring&#8208;expanded benzoxaborole congeners were obtained by an additional reduction step with LiAlH  4  or NaBH  4  . The obtained boracyclic compounds were characterized in detail by NMR spectroscopy and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Specifically, biphenyl&#8208;based systems show dynamic behaviour interpreted in terms of inversion of non&#8208;planar 7&#8208;membered boraheterocycles. The acidity of the obtained compounds varies very strongly (  p  K  a  ranges from 3.1&#8722;9.6) depending on their structure. Due to the enhanced boron Lewis acidity, selected compounds were used as a basis for luminescent complexes with 8&#8208;hydroxyquinoline. A strong phase&#8208;dependent variation of emission band maximum (480&#8722;527 nm) and photoluminescence quantum yield (10&#8722;95%) was observed, which was rationalized in terms of specific aggregation effects.</dc:description>

         <title>Elucidating the germanium distribution in ITQ&#8208;13 zeolites by density functional theory</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>ITQ&#8208;13 is a medium&#8208;pore zeolite that can be prepared in all&#8208;silica form and as silicogermanate with Si/Ge ratios as low as 3. Usually synthesised in the presence of fluoride, ITQ&#8208;13 is among the very few systems containing fluoride anions in two distinct cage types, cube&#8208;like  d4r  units and [4&#183;5  6  ] cages. Here, dispersion&#8208;corrected density functional theory (DFT) calculations are used to investigate the energetically most favourable Ge distributions for Si/Ge ratios between 55 and 6. The calculations show Ge atoms are incorporated at both the corners of  d4r  cages and at the basal plane of the [4&#183;5  6  ] cages, in accordance with  19  F&#8208;NMR spectroscopy. Two Ge atoms at adjacent corners of [4&#183;5  6  ] cages are stable at the highest Ge content considered (Si/Ge = 6).. Such a local environment has not yet been considered in the experimental literature. A calculation of the corresponding  19  F&#8208;NMR resonance points to overlap with other resonances, which might preclude its clear identification. Additional calculations investigate the variation of the dynamic behaviour of the fluoride anions as a function of the local environment as well as the selective defluorination of the [4&#183;5  6  ] cages.</dc:description>

         <title>Strengthening of the C&#8211;F bond in Fumaryl fluoride with Superacids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reaction of fumaryl fluoride with the superacidic solutions XF/MF  5  (X = H, D; M = As, Sb) results in the formation of the monoprotonated and diprotonated species, dependent on the stoichiometric ratio of the Lewis acid in reference to fumaryl fluoride. The salts [C  4  H  3  F  2  O  2  ]  +  [MF  6  ]  &#8211;  (M = As, Sb) and [C  4  H  2  X  2  F  2  O  2  ]  2+  ([MF  6  ]  &#8211;  )  2  (X = H, D; M = As, Sb) are the first examples with a protonated acyl fluoride moiety. They were characterized by low&#8208;temperature vibrational spectroscopy. Low&#8208;temperature NMR spectroscopy and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structure analyses were carried out for [C  4  H  3  F  2  O  2  ]  +  [SbF  6  ]  &#8211;  as well as for [C  4  H  4  F  2  O  2  ]  2+  ([MF  6  ]  &#8211;  )  2  (M = As, Sb). The experimental results are discussed together with quantum chemical calculations of the cations [C  4  H  4  F  2  O  2  &#183; 2 HF]  2+  and [C  4  H  3  F  2  O  2  &#183; HF]  +  on the B3LYP/aug&#8208;cc&#8208;pVTZ level of theory. In addition, Electrostatic Potential (ESP) maps combined with Natural Population Analysis (NPA) charges were calculated in order to investigate the electron distribution and the charge related properties of the diprotonated species.

         <title>Transition Metal&#8208;Free Synthesis of meta&#8208;Bromo&#8208; and meta&#8208;Trifluoromethylanilines from Cyclopentanones by a Cascade Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Anilines are key constituents in biologically active compounds and often obtained from transition metal catalyzed coupling of an aryl halide with an amine. In this work, we report a transition metal free method for the synthesis of meta &#8208;bromo&#8208; and meta &#8208;trifluoromethylanilines starting from 3&#8208;tribromomethylcyclopentanone or 3&#8208;(2&#8208;bromo&#8208;2&#8208;chloro&#8208;1,1,1&#8208;trifluoroethyl)cyclopentanone, respectively. The scope of the transformation is shown by application of primary, secondary and aromatic amines. The reaction proceeds in acceptable to high yields (30&#8208;81%), and allows for the synthesis of anilines with substitution patterns otherwise difficult to access.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereoselective Synthesis of Tertiary Allylic Amines by Titanium&#8208;Catalyzed Hydroaminoalkylation of Alkynes with Tertiary Amines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

Unsymmetrical and symmetrical alkynes undergo hydroaminoalkylation with tertiary amines in the presence of a cationic titanium catalyst system, which is generated in&#8197;situ. The products obtained are synthetically and pharmaceutically very interesting tertiary allylamines, which are formed in very good yields (up to 99&#8201;%) and with excellent stereoselectivity. A major highlight of the work is the successful conversion of trimethylamine into N,N&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;E&#8208;allylamines.







Abstract
Intermolecular hydroaminoalkylation reactions of symmetrical and unsymmetrical alkynes with tertiary amines take place in the presence of catalytic amounts of TiBn4, Ph3C[B(C6F5)4], and a sterically demanding aminopyridinato ligand precursor. The resulting products, synthetically and pharmaceutically useful tertiary &#946;,&#947;&#8208;disubstituted allylic amines, are formed in convincing yields and with excellent stereoselectivity. Particularly promising for future applications is the fact that even the industrial side product trimethylamine can be used as a substrate.

         <title>Novel Lipophilic Fluorophores with Highly Acidity&#8208;Dependent Two&#8208;Photon Response</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two&#8208;photon photophysical characterization of four novel lipophilic pH probes based on phosphazene modified coumarin&#8208;151. These probes are shown to have spectral features robust to variation of local polarity from different solvents, yet display easily separable neutral and protonated forms, with maximum 2PA brightness of, &#963;2PA&#8901;&#981;em=10&#8211;13&#8197;GM. Nonlinear optical properties are quantitatively determined experimentally and compared to computational models.







Abstract
Lipophilic fluorophores are widely implemented in nonlinear microscopy; however, few existing membrane&#8208;specific probes combine the high brightness of two&#8208;photon excited fluorescence (2PEF) with pH sensitivity. Herein we describe four novel two&#8208;photon excited fluorophores, based on a coumarin 151 core structure, where lipophilicity is induced by a covalently attached phosphazene moiety. Changing the environmental acidity using trifluoromethanesulfonic (triflic) acid leads to profound changes in the linear fluorescence and 2PEF characteristics, due to chromophores&#8217; switching between neutral&#8208; and protonated forms. We characterize this dependence by measuring the two&#8208;photon absorption (2PA) spectra over the region &#955;2PA=550&#8211;1000&#8197;nm, observing 2PA cross sections of &#963;2PA=10&#8211;20&#8197;GM, with an associated 2PEF brightness of 10&#8211;13&#8197;GM, in neutral solutions of both acetonitrile and n&#8208;octanol. Although quantum chemical modelling and NMR measurements show that, at high chromophore concentrations, protonation may be accompanied by a dimerization process, these dimers likely do not form at the lower concentrations used in optical spectroscopy.

         <title>A Masked Form of an O&#8208;Borylated Breslow Intermediate for the Diastereoselective FLP&#8208;Type Activation of Aldehydes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Compound 3 featuring an FLP&#8208;type activated CO2 is used as a masked form of an elusive O&#8208;borylated Breslow intermediate for the complete diastereoselective FLP&#8208;type activation of aldehydes. Kinetic and theoretical investigations shed light on the mechanism at play.







Abstract
Breslow intermediates are very often elusive species whose application in frustrated Lewis pair (FLP) chemistry is unprecedented. Described herein is the use of a masked form of an O&#8208;borylated Breslow (OBB) intermediate that performs FLP&#8208;type activation of the carbonyl function of five different benzaldehyde derivatives with complete diastereoselectivity. The resulting compounds are characterised in solution by NMR spectroscopy (compounds 4&#8211;8) and in solid state by X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis (compounds 4&#8211;6). A combined kinetic and theoretical investigation reveals the associative nature of the rate determining step and suggests that the OBB intermediate part is never released during the whole process.

         <dc:description>Triphenylamine (TP) derivatives such as&#160;two&#8208;branch cationic vinylbenzimidazolium triphenylamine  &#160;TP&#8208;2Bzim  are promising turn&#8208;on fluorescent probes suitable for two&#8208;photon imaging, labelling mitochondria in live cells. Here, we designed two  TP&#8208;2Bzim  derivatives as bimodal probes suitable for X&#8208;ray fluorescence imaging. The conjugation of the TP core with a rhenium tricarbonyl moiety in the  TP&#8208;RePyta  probe altered the localisation in live cells from mitochondria to lysosomes. The introduction of bromine on the TP core generated the  TP&#8208;Br  probe retaining good photophysical properties and mitochondria labeling in live cells. The influence of calcium channels in the uptake of  TP&#8208;Br  was studied. Synchrotron Radiation X&#8208;ray Fluorescence (SXRF) imaging of bromine enabled the detection of  TP&#8208;Br  and suggested a negligible presence of the probe in an unbound state in the incubated cells, a crucial point in the development of these probes. This study paves the way towards the development of TP probes as specific organelle stainers suitable for SXRF imaging.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>An electrochemical method for the green and practical synthesis of a broad range of substituted isoxazoline cores is presented. Both aryl and more challenging alkyl aldoximes are converted to the desired isoxazoline  via  an electrochemically enabled regio&#8208; and diastereoselective reaction with electron&#8208;deficient alkenes. Additionally,  in&#8208;situ  reaction monitoring methods compatible with electrochemistry equipment have also been developed in order to probe the reaction pathway. Supporting analyses from kinetic (timecourse) modeling and density functional theory support a stepwise, radical&#8208;mediated mechanism, and discounts hypothesized involvement of closed shell [3+2] cycloaddition pathways.</dc:description>

         <title>Chloromethyl Glycosides as Versatile Synthons to Prepare Glycosyloxymethyl&#8208;Prodrugs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Monosaccharides were introduced on drug molecules to improve their solubility, metabolic stability and oral bioavailability. A new chloromethyl glycoside synthon was developed to enable the synthesis of numerous monosaccharide prodrugs.







Abstract
This work investigates the addition of monosaccharides to marketed drugs to improve their pharmacokinetic properties for oral absorption. To this end, a set of chloromethyl glycoside synthons were developed to prepare a variety of glycosyloxymethyl&#8208;prodrugs derived from 5&#8208;fluorouracil, thioguanine, propofol and losartan. Drug release was studied in&#8197;vitro using &#946;&#8208;glucosidase confirming rapid conversion of the monosaccharide prodrugs to release the parent drug, formaldehyde and the monosaccharide. To showcase this prodrug approach, a glucosyloxymethyl conjugate of the tetrazole&#8208;containing drug losartan was used for in&#8197;vivo experiments and showed complete release of the drug in a dog&#8208;model.

         <title>The Impact of Research Culture on Mental Health &amp; Diversity in STEM</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper focuses on key aspects of academic research culture that can impact STEM researcher mental health: bullying and harassment; precarity of contracts; diversity, inclusion, and accessibility; and the competitive research landscape, as well as exploring why mental health matters for researchers. Further, key recommendations are provided and actionable steps are outlined that institutions can take to make research in STEM inclusive for all.







Abstract
The onset of COVID&#8208;19, coupled with the finer lens placed on systemic racial disparities within our society, has resulted in increased discussions around mental health. Despite this, mental health struggles in research are still often viewed as individual weaknesses and not the result of a larger dysfunctional research culture. Mental health interventions in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) academic community often focus on what individuals can do to improve their mental health instead of focusing on improving the research environment. In this paper, we present four aspects of research that may heavily impact mental health based on our experiences as research scientists: bullying and harassment; precarity of contracts; diversity, inclusion, and accessibility; and the competitive research landscape. Based on these aspects, we propose systemic changes that institutions must adopt to ensure their research culture is supportive and allows everyone to thrive.

         <title>The apparently unreactive substrate facilitates the electron transfer for dioxygen activation in Rieske dioxygenases</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rieske dioxygenases belong to the non&#8208;heme iron family of oxygenases and catalyze important cis&#8208;dihydroxylation as well as O&#8208;/N&#8208;dealkylation and oxidative cyclization reactions for a wide range of substrates. The lack of substrate coordination at the non&#8208;heme ferrous iron center, however, makes it particularly challenging to delineate the role of the substrate for productive O2 activation. Here, we studied the role of the substrate in the key elementary reaction leading to O2 activation from a theoretical perspective by systematically considering (i) the 6&#8208;coordinate to 5&#8208;coordinate conversion of the non&#8208;heme FeII upon abstraction of a water ligand, (ii) binding of O2, and (iii) transfer of an electron from the Rieske cluster. We systematically evaluated the spin&#8208;state&#8208;dependent reaction energies and structural effects at the active site for all combinations of the three elementary processes in the presence and absence of substrate using naphthalene dioxygenase as a prototypical Rieske dioxygenase. We find that reaction energies for the generation of a coordination vacancy at the non&#8208;heme FeII center through thermoneutral H2O reorientation and exothermic O2 binding prior to Rieske cluster oxidation are largely insensitive to the presence of naphthalene and do not lead to formation of any of the known reactive Fe&#8208;oxygen species. By contrast, the role of the substrate becomes evident after Rieske cluster oxidation and exclusively for the 6&#8208;coordinate non&#8208;heme FeII sites in that the additional electron is found at the substrate instead of at the iron and oxygen atoms. Our results imply an allosteric control of the substrate on Rieske dioxygenase reactivity to happen prior to changes at the non&#8208;heme FeII in agreement with a strategy that avoids unproductive O2 activation.</dc:description>

The &#960;&#8208;ligands span from ethylene to larger terminal and internal alkenes and alkynes. By means of X&#8208;ray crystallography, NMR, and IR spectroscopy and gas phase experiments, we show that the binding energies increase in the order Ag &lt; Cu &lt; Au and the binding energies are slightly higher for alkynes than for alkenes.

         <title>Probing the Lewis Acidity of Boronic Acids through Interactions with Arene Substituents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Boronic acids. Hammett analysis of 2,6&#8208;diarylphenylboronic acids reveals that their Lewis acidity remains unchanged upon the introduction of EWG/EDG at the distant para position of the flanking aromatic rings. Structural and computational studies demonstrate that polar&#8208;&#960; interactions and solvation effects contribute to the stabilization of boronic acids and boronate forms by aromatic rings, providing a valuable molecular insight into the rational design of novel catalysts and inhibitors.







Abstract
Boronic acids are Lewis acids that exist in equilibrium with boronate forms in aqueous solution. Here we experimentally and computationally investigated the Lewis acidity of 2,6&#8208;diarylphenylboronic acids; specially designed phenylboronic acids that possess two flanking aromatic rings with tunable aromatic character. Hammett analysis of 2,6&#8208;diarylphenylboronic acids reveals that their Lewis acidity remains unchanged upon the introduction of EWG/EDG at the distant para position of the flanking aromatic rings. Structural and computational studies demonstrate that polar&#8208;&#960; interactions and solvation effects contribute to the stabilization of boronic acids and boronate forms by aromatic rings. Our physical&#8208;organic chemistry work highlights that boronic acids and boronates can be stabilized by aromatic systems, leading to an important molecular knowledge for rational design and development of boronic acid&#8208;based catalysts and inhibitors of biomedically important proteins.

         <title>Abnormal Association between Metal&#8722;Organic Cages and Counterions Regulated by the Hydration Shells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
When introducing extra salts into Cage 1 aqueous solution, most salts (Na2SO4, NaNO3, NaClO4, and NaSCN) can trigger larger&#8208;sized blackberry; while no clear change can be observed for Cage 2 solution, except NaSCN, which can be attribute to the thick hydration shell of Cage 2, inhibiting the counterion&#8211;macroion interaction.







Abstract
A unique trend in the binding affinity between cationic metal&#8722;organic cages (MOCs) and external counteranions in aqueous media was observed. Similar to many macroions, two MOCs, sharing similar structures but carrying different number of charges, self&#8208;assembled into hollow spherical single&#8208;layered blackberry&#8208;type structures through counterion&#8208;mediated attraction. Dynamic and static light scattering and isothermal titration calorimetry measurements confirm the stronger interactions among less charged MOCs and counteranions than that of highly charged MOCs, leading to larger assembly sizes. DOSY NMR measurements suggest the significance of thick hydration shells of highly charged MOCs, inhibiting the MOC&#8208;counterion binding and weakening the interaction between them. This study demonstrates that the greater role played by hydration shell on ion&#8208;pair formation comparing with charge density of MOCs.

         <title>Sandacrabins &#8211; Structurally Unique Antiviral RNA Polymerase Inhibitors from a Rare Myxobacterium**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Non&#8208;nucleoside RdRp inhibitors. A family of unprecedented farnesylated dimethylbenzimidazoles called the sandacrabins have been discovered from a new myxobacterial Sandaracinus species. They exhibit antiviral activities that could be correlated to inhibition of the RNA synthesis as their potential antiviral mode of action. This study describes their structure elucidation, biosynthetic origin, total synthesis and biological evaluation.







Abstract
Structure elucidation and total synthesis of five unprecedented terpenoid&#8208;alkaloids, the sandacrabins, are reported, alongside with the first description of their producing organism Sandaracinus defensii MSr10575, which expands the Sandaracineae family by only its second member. The genome sequence of S. defensii as presented in this study was utilized to identify enzymes responsible for sandacrabin formation, whereby dimethylbenzimidazol, deriving from cobalamin biosynthesis, was identified as key intermediate. Biological activity profiling revealed that all sandacrabins except congener A exhibit potent antiviral activity against the human pathogenic coronavirus HCoV229E in the three digit nanomolar range. Investigation of the underlying mode of action discloses that the sandacrabins inhibit the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 RNA&#8208;dependent RNA polymerase complex, highlighting them as structurally distinct non&#8208;nucleoside RNA synthesis inhibitors. The observed segregation between cell toxicity at higher concentrations and viral inhibition opens the possibility for their medicinal chemistry optimization towards selective inhibitors.

         <title>Electrostatic Perturbations in the Substrate&#8208;Binding Pocket of Taurine/&#945;&#8208;Ketoglutarate Dioxygenase Determine its Selectivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Density functional theory calculations on large active site models of taurine/&#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate dioxygenase show that second&#8208;coordination sphere effects of polar and charged amino acid residues are essential for the correct description of the regioselectivity of taurine activation by this enzyme. In particular, a charged histidine residue incurs a local electric field effect that guides the reactivity to C1&#8208;hydroxylation.







Abstract
Taurine/&#945;&#8208;ketoglutarate dioxygenase is an important enzyme that takes part in the cysteine catabolism process in the human body and selectively hydroxylates taurine at the C1&#8208;position. Recent computational studies showed that in the gas&#8208;phase the C2&#8722;H bond of taurine is substantially weaker than the C1&#8722;H bond, yet no evidence exists of 2&#8208;hydroxytaurine products. To this end, a detailed computational study on the selectivity patterns in TauD was performed. The calculations show that the second&#8208;coordination sphere and the protonation states of residues play a major role in guiding the enzyme to the right selectivity. Specifically, a single proton on an active site histidine residue can change the regioselectivity of the reaction through its electrostatic perturbations in the active site and effectively changes the C1&#8722;H and C2&#8722;H bond strengths of taurine. This is further emphasized by many polar and hydrogen bonding interactions of the protein cage in TauD with the substrate and the oxidant that weaken the pro&#8208;R C1&#8722;H bond and triggers a chemoselective reaction process. The large cluster models reproduce the experimental free energy of activation excellently.

         <title>Release of Molecular Cargo from Polymer Systems by Mechanochemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanochemical design: The incorporation of force&#8208;responsive groups, known as mechanophores, into macromolecular systems has provided access to responsive behaviours and enabled sophisticated functions of the resulting structures and advanced materials. We present examples of molecular cargo release systems and their sonochemical activation by ultrasound. Important design concepts of these advanced materials, as well as their synthesis and applications, are discussed.







Abstract
The design and manipulation of (multi)functional materials at the nanoscale holds the promise of fuelling tomorrow's major technological advances. In the realm of macromolecular nanosystems, the incorporation of force&#8208;responsive groups, so called mechanophores, has resulted in unprecedented access to responsive behaviours and enabled sophisticated functions of the resulting structures and advanced materials. Among the diverse force&#8208;activated motifs, the on&#8208;demand release or activation of compounds, such as catalysts, drugs, or monomers for self&#8208;healing, are sought&#8208;after since they enable triggering pristine small molecule function from macromolecular frameworks. Here, we highlight examples of molecular cargo release systems from polymer&#8208;based architectures in solution by means of sonochemical activation by ultrasound (ultrasound&#8208;induced mechanochemistry). Important design concepts of these advanced materials are discussed, as well as their syntheses and applications.

         <title>Development of Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free Lewis Acid&#8208;Initiated Double Arylation of Aldehyde: A Facile Approach Towards the Total Synthesis of Anti&#8208;breast Cancer Agent</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This work describes a mild and robust double hydroarylation strategy for the synthesis of symmetrical /unsymmetrical diaryl&#8208; and triarylmethanes in excellent yields using Lambert salt (0.2&#8208;1.0 mol%). Despite the anticipated challenges associated with controlling selective product formation, unsymmetrical diaryl&#8208; and triarylmethanes products are obtained unprecedentedly. A highly efficient gram scale reaction has also been reported (TON for symmetrical product = 475 and for unsymmetrical product = 390). The synthetic utility of the methodology is demonstrated by the preparation of several unexplored diaryl&#8208; and triarylmethanes&#8208;based biological relevant molecules, such as arundine, vibrindole A, turbomycin B, anti&#8208;inflammatory agent. A total synthesis of anti&#8208;breast cancer agent is also demonstrated. Control experiments, Hammett analysis, HRMS and GC&#8208;MS studies reveal the reaction intermediates and reaction mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Reductive Aldol Reaction of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Carboxylic Acids to Alkyl Aryl Ketones: Silanes as Activator and Transient Protecting Group</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first reductive aldol reaction of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carboxylic acids was developed in the presence of copper/bisphosphine catalysts. The reaction demonstrated the usability of in situ protection of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carboxylic acids by a hydrosilane for the reductive C&#8722;C bond formation. The Si&#8722;O bond in the aldol products is readily cleaved by a standard workup, showing the silane worked as not only an activator but also a transient protecting group.







Abstract
The first enantioselective reductive aldol reaction of unprotected &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carboxylic acids was developed by employing a copper/bisphosphine catalyst. The reaction features in situ protection and activation of an &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carboxylic acid by a hydrosilane. The copper enolate formed in situ reacts with an alkyl aryl ketone to afford the &#946;&#8208;hydroxy carboxylic acid with excellent enantioselectivity (up to 99&#8201;% ee). The corresponding gram&#8208;scale reaction with a low catalyst loading and the derivatization of the &#946;&#8208;hydroxy carboxylic acids highlight the practicality of this transformation.

         <title>H/F substitution induced large increase of Tc in a 3D hybrid rare&#8208;earth double perovskite multifunctional compound</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Increasing attention to study perovskite&#8208;type multifunctional stimuli&#8208;responsive materials with multiple channel physical characteristics. However, it remains significant challenges to simultaneously achieve multifunction and control of structural phase transition temperature in hybrid compounds. Here, we report two three&#8208;dimensional organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid rare&#8208;earth double perovskite compounds, (HQ)2RbEu(NO3)6 (1, HQ = quinuclidium) and (4FHQ)2 RbEu(NO3)6 (2, 4FHQ = 4&#8208;fluoro&#8208;quinuclidium), which exhibit ferroelasticity, dielectric switch, and excellent photoluminescence response. The phase transition temperature of 2 increases 169 K compared with 1 through H/F substitution. This result is attributed to the H/F substitution generated Rb&#8722;F coordinate between cations and anions. Meanwhile, the photoluminescence emission intensity of 2 shows no quench with the increase of temperature, in particular, the emission spectrum achieves fine regulation at high temperatures. This work provides a new solution for the realization of multi&#8208;functions and regulations of the properties based on hybrid perovskite materials with high critical temperatures.</dc:description>

         <title>Proton or Carbene Transfer? On the Dark and Light Reaction of Diazoalkanes with Alcohols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The formal alkylation reaction of OH groups with diazoalkanes under catalyst&#8208;free reaction conditions finds broad application in organic synthesis. However, this reaction is even today mainly limited to the use of diazomethane as reaction partner. In this combined experimental and theoretical study, we aim at a fundamental understanding of the reaction of diazoalkanes with alcohols to make this transformation amenable to a generalized approach towards formal alkylation reactions of alcohols with diazoalkanes. Experimental and theoretical studies suggest a direct proton transfer only in exceptional cases. In a more general setting, such O&#8208;H functionalization proceed both under dark and photochemical conditions via a key hydrogen&#8208;bonded singlet carbene intermediate that undergoes a protonation&#8208;addition mechanism. We conclude with applications of this approach in O&#8208;H functionalization reactions of alcohols, including simple fluorinated, halogenated and aliphatic alcohols and showcase functional group tolerance of this method in the reaction of biologically active and pharmaceutically relevant alcohols.</dc:description>

         <title>Directed Synthesis and Chemistry of Unsymmetric Dicationic Diboranes and Their Use in FLP&#8208;like Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The chemistry of dicationic diboranes with two B  II  atoms that are engaged in direct B&#8208;B bonding is by enlarge unexplored, although these molecules have intriguing properties due to their combined Lewis acidic and electron&#8208;donor properties. Unsymmetric dicationic diboranes are extremely rare, but especially attractive due to their polarized B&#8208;B bond. In this work we report the directed synthesis of several stable unsymmetric dicationic diboranes by reaction between the electron&#8208;rich ditriflato&#8208;diborane B  2  (hpp)  2  (OTf)  2  (hpp = 1,3,4,6,7,8&#8208;hexahydro&#8208;2  H  &#8208;pyrimido[1,2&#8208;&#945;]pyrimidinate) and a phosphino&#8208;pyridine, establishing B&#8208;N and B&#8208;P bonds with the diborane concomitant with triflate elimination. In the case of 2&#8208;((ditertbutylphosphino)methyl)pyridine, the B&#8208;N bond is formed instantly, but the B&#8208;P bond formation requires (due to steric constraints) several days at ambient conditions for completion, creating an intermediate that could be used for frustrated Lewis pair (FLP)&#8208;like chemistry. Here we test its reaction with an aldehyde, and propose a new type of FLP&#8208;like chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>On the road for more efficient biocompatible two&#8208;photon excitable fluorophores</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Red to NIR absorption and emission wavelengths are key requirements for intravital bioimaging. One of the way to reach such excitation wavelengths is to use two&#8208;photon excitation. Unfortunately, there is still a lack of two&#8208;photon excitable fluorophores that are both efficient and biocompatible. Thus, we design a series of biocompatible quadrupolar dyes in order to study their ability to be used for live&#8208;cell imaging, and in particular for two&#8208;photon microscopy. Hence, we report the synthesis of 5 probes based on different donor cores (phenoxazine, acridane, phenazasiline and phenothiazine) and the study of their linear and non&#8208;linear photophysical properties. TD&#8208;DFT calculations were performed and were able to highlight the structure&#8208;property relationship of this series. All these studies highlight the great potential of three of these biocompatible dyes for two&#8208;photon microscopy, as they both exhibit high two&#8208;photon cross&#8208;sections (up to 3 650 GM) and emit orange to red light. This potential was confirmed through live&#8208;cell two&#8208;photon microscopy experiments, leading to images with very high brightness and contrast.</dc:description>

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;mimetic molecular selective catalysis via single Zr atom catalysis in chelated cage embedded in a flexible piezoelectrical matrix</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The molecularly selective catalysis in enzyme is central to life. However, their functioning mechanism remains elusive. We propose here that the synergistic effects from (i) effective orbital hybridyzing and energy gap decreasing via chelating on single Zr atom as the catalytic center, (ii) selective supramolecular encapsulation in the cage, and (iii) piezoelectrical field motivation are able to achieve the enzyme&#8208;mimetic molecular selective high performance catalysis. Metal&#8208;organic polyhedra (MOPs) are added into a piezoelectrical polymer matrix to achieve the composite structure where ultrasonic treatment motivates redox reactions in the MOP&#8208;guest complex. Encapsulated and chelated guest such as Rhodamine B (RhB) is effectively converted with ratios higher than 90% after 100 min. In comparison, molecules inefficient in either cage encapsulation or chelating with the Zr center can not be converted. This study first proposes a synergistic plot for enzyme&#8208;mimetic catalyst realization and is expected to inspire new mentality in efficient catalyst designing.</dc:description>

         <title>Bright Luminescence by Combining Chiral [2.2]Paracyclophane with a Boron&#8211;Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Polyaromatic Hydrocarbon Building Block</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coupling through&#8208;bond and through&#8208;space by a chiral building block results in excellent optical and chiroptical properties: &#1013; up to 2.04&#215;105&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1, &#934;PL up to 0.70, and intense, mirror&#8208;image electronic circular dichroism and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) signals of a magnitude of 10&#8722;3 for the absorption and luminescence dissymmetry factors.







Abstract
Novel BN&#8208;doped compounds based on chiral, tetrasubstituted [2.2]paracyclophane and NBN&#8208;benzo[f,g]tetracene were synthesized by Sonogashira&#8211;Hagihara coupling. Conjugated ethynyl linkers allow electronic communication between the &#960;&#8208;electron systems through&#8208;bond, whereas through&#8208;space interactions are provided by strong &#960;&#8211;&#960; overlap between the pairs of NBN&#8208;building blocks. Excellent optical and chiroptical properties in racemic and enantiopure conditions were measured, with molar absorption coefficients up to &#1013;=2.04&#215;105&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1, fluorescence quantum yields up to &#934;PL=0.70, and intense, mirror&#8208;image electronic circular dichroism and circularly polarized luminescence signals of the magnitude of 10&#8722;3 for the absorption and luminescence dissymmetry factors. Computed glum,calcd. values match the experimental ones. Electroanalytical data show both oxidation and reduction of the ethynyl&#8208;linked tetra&#8208;NBN&#8208;substituted paracyclophane, with an overlap of two redox processes for oxidation leading to a diradical dication.

         <title>Ferroelectrics in Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structure, nature and future: This review classifies ferroelectric photocatalysts into perovskite, layered bismuth&#8208;based and other materials based on their crystal structure. Progress in ferroelectrics research is then summarized including photocatalytic pollution degradation, water splitting and CO2 reduction. Finally, current challenges and future prospects are provided with the purpose for presenting a deep insight and guideline for future research into ferroelectrics.







Abstract
The rapid development of industrialization and population has brought water, air&#8208;pollution and energy crises. Solar&#8208;driven catalysis is expected to relieve these issues. However, limited by poor light harvesting, serious charge recombination of semiconductors, and high surface reaction barriers, the low efficiency of solar conversion is far from satisfactory for industrial needs. Ferroelectrics are considered to be promising photocatalysts to overcome these shortcomings. Herein, perovskite ferroelectrics such as BaTiO3, PbTiO3, BiFeO3 and LiNbO3, layered bismuth&#8208;based ferroelectrics like Bi2WO6 and Bi2MoO6, and other ferroelectrics are introduced, and their crystal structure, polarity source and synthetic method are highlighted. Subsequently, research progress in ferroelectrics for photocatalysis is summarized, including pollution degradation, water splitting and CO2 reduction. Finally, the current challenges and future prospects of ferroelectric photocatalysts are provided. The purpose of this review is not only to provide a timely summary for the application of ferroelectrics in photocatalysis, but also to present deep insight and a guideline for future research work into ferroelectrics.

         <title>Interstitial Hydrides in Nanoclusters can Reduce M(I) (M=Cu, Ag, Au) to M(0) and Form Stable Superatoms</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The concept proposes that interstitial hydrides in high&#8208;nuclearity coinage metal nanoclusters can reduce M(I) (M=Cu, Ag, Au) to M(0) and form stable superatoms. This implies the hydride species can induce internal self&#8208;redox reactions (no external reducing agent needed) but as prerequisite the transformed clusters seem to have a similar core framework structure. These observations have implications in catalytic and energy cycles.







Abstract
High&#8208;nuclearity clusters resemble the closest model between the determination of atomically precise chemical species and the bulk metallic version thereof, and both impacts on a variety of applications, including catalysis, optics, sensors, and new energy sources. Our interest lies with the nanoclusters of the Group 11 (Cu, Ag, Au) metals stabilized by dichalcogenido and hydrido ligands. Herein, we describe superatoms formed by the clusters and their relationship with precursor hydrido clusters. Specifically, our concept seeks to demonstrate a possible correlation that exist between hydrido clusters (and nanoalloys) and the formation of superatoms, with the loss of hydrides and typically with release of H2 gas. These reactions appear to be internal self&#8208;redox reactions and require no additional reducing agent, but does seem to require a similar core structure. Knowledge of such processes could provide insight into how clusters grow and an understanding in bridging the atomically precise cluster &#8211; metal nanoparticle mechanism.

         <title>Unlocking the hydrolytic mechanism of GH92 &#945;&#8208;1,2&#8208;mannosidases: computation inspires using C&#8208;glycosides as Michaelis complex mimics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The conformational changes in a sugar moiety along the hydrolytic pathway are key to understand the mechanism of glycoside hydrolases (GHs) and to design new inhibitors. The two predominant itineraries for mannosidases go via OS2 &#8594; B2,5 &#8594; 1S5 and 3S1 &#8594; 3H4 &#8594; 1C4. For the CAZy family 92, the conformational itinerary was unknown. Published complexes of Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron GH92 catalyst with a S&#8208;glycoside and mannoimidazole indicate a 4C1 &#8594; 4H5/1S5 &#8594; 1S5 mechanism. However, as observed with the GH125 family, S&#8208;glycosides may not act always as good mimics of GH&#8217;s natural substrate. Here we present a cooperative study between computations and experiments where our results predict the E5 &#8594; B2,5/1S5 &#8594; 1S5 pathway for GH92 enzymes. Furthermore, we demonstrate the Michaelis complex mimicry of a new kind of C&#8208;disaccharides, whose biochemical applicability was still a chimera.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient oligomerization of aromatic amino acids induced by gaps in four&#8208;helix bundles of DNA or RNA</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The formation of peptides from amino acids is one of the processes associated with life. Because of the dominant role of translation in extant biology, peptide&#8208;forming processes that are RNA&#8208;induced are of particular interest. We had previously reported the formation of phosphoramidate&#8208;linked peptido RNAs as the products of spontaneous condensation reactions between ribonucleotides and free amino acids in aqueous solution. We now asked whether four&#8208;helix bundle (4HB) DNA or RNA folding motifs with a single&#8208; or double&#8208;nucleotide gap next to a 5'&#8208;phosphate can act as reaction sites for phosphoramidate formation. For glycine, this was found to be the case, whereas phenylalanine and tryptophan showed accelerated formation of peptides without a covalent link to the nucleic acid. Free peptides with up to 11 tryptophan or phenylalanine residues were found in precipitates forming in the presence of gap&#8208;containing DNA or RNA 4HB's. Control experiments using motifs with just a nick or primer alone did not have the same effect. Because folded structures with a gap in a double helix are likely products of hybridization of strands formed in statistically controlled oligomerization reactions, our results are interesting in the context of prebiotic scenarios. Independent of a putative role in evolution, our findings suggest that for some aromatic amino acids an RNA&#8208;induced pathway for oligomerization exists that does not have a discernable link to translation.</dc:description>

         <title>Hierarchical Modulation of Optical Anisotropy Driven by Metal Cation Polyhedra in Fluorooxoborates MIIB4O6F2 (MII=Be, Mg, Pb, Zn, Cd)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cation substitution from Ca, Sr to Be and Mg (Route&#8208;I), to Pb (Route&#8208;II), Zn, Cd (Route&#8208;III) in a flexible fluorooxoborate framework hierarchically enhances the optical anisotropy up to 46.6&#8201;%.







Abstract
The enhancement mechanism of birefringence is very important to modulate optical anisotropy and materials design. Herein, the different cations extending from alkaline&#8208;earth to alkaline&#8208;earth, d10 electron configuration, and 6s2 lone pair cations are highlighted to explore the influence on the birefringence. A flexible fluorooxoborate framework from AEB4O6F2 (AE=Ca, Sr) is adopted for UV/deep&#8208;UV birefringent structures, namely, MIIB4O6F2 (MII=Be, Mg, Pb, Zn, Cd). The maximal enhancement on birefringence can reach 46.6&#8201;% with the cation substitution from Ca, Sr to Be, Mg (route&#8208;I), Pb (route&#8208;II), and Zn, Cd (route&#8208;III). The influence of the cation size, the stereochemically active lone pair, and the binding capability of metal cation polyhedra is investigated for the hierarchical improvement on birefringence. Significantly, the BeB4O6F2 structure features the shortest UV cutoff edge 146&#8197;nm among the available anhydrous beryllium borates with birefringence over 0.1 at 1064&#8197;nm, and the PbB4O6F2 structure has the shortest UV cutoff edge 194&#8197;nm within the reported anhydrous lead borates that hold birefringence larger than 0.1 at 1064&#8197;nm. This work sheds light on how metal cation polyhedra modulate birefringence, which suggests a credible design strategy to obtain desirable birefringent structures by cation control.

         <title>Pedal to the Metal: The Homogeneous Catalysis of the Native Chemical Ligation Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nucleophilic catalysis is key to the acceleration of the native chemical ligation (NCL) reaction and thus, to its application for protein synthesis, functionalization and utilization in chemical biology. The present concept article discusses the fundamental principles of NCL rate and catalysis with emphasis on thiol nucleophiles.







Abstract
The native chemical ligation reaction of peptide thioesters with cysteinyl peptides is a pivotal chemical process in the production of native or modified peptides and proteins, and well beyond in the preparation of various biomolecule analogs and materials. To benefit from this reaction at its fullest and to access all the possible applications, the experimentalist needs to know the factors affecting its rate and how to control it. This concept article presents the fundamental principles underlying the rate of the native chemical ligation and its homogeneous catalysis by nucleophiles. It has been prepared to serve as a quick guide in the search for an appropriate catalyst.

         <title>A Redox&#8208;Active Microporous Organosiloxane Containing a Stable Neutral Radical, Trioxotriangulene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new silyl&#8208;substituted trioxotriangulene (TOT) neutral radical was synthesized and exhibited a peculiarly high stability and a self&#8208;assembling ability to form a &#960;&#8208;dimer stabilized by the strong multiple SOMO&#8208;SOMO interaction. The polycondensation of the silyl&#8208;substituted TOT yielded a microporous organosiloxane with a large surface area and a micropore of &#8764;1&#8197;nm diameter. The TOT unit incorporated in the organosiloxane&#8208;wall exhibited a reversible multi&#8208;stage redox ability in the chemical and electrochemical methods.







Abstract
A new silyl&#8208;substituted trioxotriangulene (TOT) neutral radical and corresponding porous organosiloxanes (POSs) were synthesized. The neutral radical exhibited a peculiarly high stability and formed a diamagnetic &#960;&#8208;dimer characteristic to TOT neutral radicals stabilized by the strong multiple SOMO&#8208;SOMO interaction in both solution and solid states. POSs including TOT units within the organosiloxane&#8208;wall were prepared by polycondensation of the silyl groups and formed microporous structures with &#8764;1&#8197;nm&#8208;size diameters. Redox ability of TOT units in the POS was demonstrated by the treatment of oxidant/reductant in heterogeneous suspension condition, where the TOT units were reversibly converted between reduced and neutral radical species. Furthermore, the solid&#8208;state electrochemical measurements of the POS revealed the reversible multi&#8208;stage redox ability of TOT units involving polyanionic species within the organosiloxane&#8208;wall.

         <title>Parahydrogen&#8208;Induced Polarization in Hydrogenation Reactions Mediated by a Metal&#8208;Free Catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Substantial hyperpolarization of nuclear spins in alkene products was observed in alkyne hydrogenations with parahydrogen mediated by a metal&#8208;free hydroborane catalyst. The observed effects are unusual, as the mechanism of the reaction is not pairwise, thus allowing hyperpolarization of only one of two protons at double bonds. Moreover, this enabled various important intermediates to be characterized by hyperpolarized 1H, 11B and 15N NMR spectroscopy.







Abstract
We report nuclear spin hyperpolarization of various alkenes achieved in alkyne hydrogenations with parahydrogen over a metal&#8208;free hydroborane catalyst (HCAT). Being an intramolecular frustrated Lewis pair aminoborane, HCAT utilizes a non&#8208;pairwise mechanism of H2 transfer to alkynes that normally prevents parahydrogen&#8208;induced polarization (PHIP) from being observed. Nevertheless, the specific spin dynamics in catalytic intermediates leads to the hyperpolarization of predominantly one hydrogen in alkene. PHIP enabled the detection of important HCAT&#8208;alkyne&#8208;H2 intermediates through substantial 1H, 11B and 15N signal enhancement and allowed advanced characterization of the catalytic process.

         <title>Comparative Study of Nitro&#8208; and Azide&#8208;Functionalized ZnII&#8208;Based Coordination Polymers (CPs) as Fluorescent Turn&#8208;On Probes for Rapid and Selective Detection of H2S in Living Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the reduction approach, newly synthesized coordination polymers (CPs) containing biologically essential metal ion (Zn) was shown to exhibit an excellent ability for the detection of extracellular and intracellular H2S. The CP&#8208;1, containing azido functunal group acted as an efficient fluorencent turn&#8208;on probe with lowest detection limit (7.2&#8197;&#956;M) and shortest response time (30&#8197;s) among the reported Zn&#8208;based probes to date, whereas the nitro group containing CP&#8208;2 was unable to sense H2S due to its framework disruption.







Abstract
Selective detection of H2S in the cellular systems using fluorescent CPs/MOFs is of great scientific interest due to their outstanding aqueous stability, biocompatibility and real&#8208;time detection ability. Fabrication of such materials using complete biologically essential elements and applying them as an efficient biosensor is still quite challenging. In this context, two newly synthesized CPs containing biologically essential metal ion (Zn) and nitro/azido functional groups into the framework to sense extracellular and intracellular H2S by reducing into respective amines are presented. The CP&#8208;1 containing the azide group acted as an efficient fluorescent turn&#8208;on probe with the lowest detection limit (7.2&#8197;&#956;M) and shortest response time (30&#8197;s) among the Zn&#8208;based probes reported till date. Moreover, CP&#8208;1 exhibited green luminescence in live cells after imaging a very low concentration of H2S, whereas the nitro analogue CP&#8208;2 could not detect the target analyte due to its framework disruption.

         <title>Synthesis, Structure, and Dynamics of Chiral Eight&#8208;Membered Cyclic Molecules with Thienylene and Cyclopropylene Units Alternately Connected</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rhodium(II)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric cyclooligomerization of bifunctional monomers possessing triazolyl (carbene precursor) and vinyl groups at 2,3&#8208; and 3,4&#8208;positions on the thiophene ring is studied. Cyclic dimers, which adopt a tub&#8208;shaped conformation, are obtained as the major components. We also observe the phenomenon of racemization caused by a tub&#8208;to&#8208;tub ring&#8208;flipping, the activation energy of which is determined as 108&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1 by electronic circular dichroism spectra measurement.

         <title>Gas Phase Preparation of the Elusive Monobridged Ge(&#956;&#8208;H)GeH Molecule through Nonadiabatic Reaction Dynamics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hitherto elusive monobridged Ge(&#956;&#8208;H)GeH molecule was prepared in the gas phase through bimolecular reaction of atomic germanium with germane (GeH4). The divergent chemistries of germanium versus carbon are reflected when comparing the acetylene isomers with the isovalent germanium analogues. This reaction deepens our understanding of the role of nonadiabatic reaction dynamics in preparing nonclassical, hydrogen&#8208;bridged isomers carrying main group XIV elements.







Abstract
The hitherto elusive monobridged Ge(&#956;&#8208;H)GeH (X1A&#8242;) molecule was prepared in the gas phase by bimolecular reaction of atomic germanium with germane (GeH4). Electronic structure calculations revealed that this reaction commenced on the triplet surface with the formation of a van der Waals complex, followed by insertion of germanium into a germanium&#8208;hydrogen bond over a submerged barrier to form the triplet digermanylidene intermediate (HGeGeH3); the latter underwent intersystem crossing from the triplet to the singlet surface. On the singlet surface, HGeGeH3 predominantly isomerized through two successive hydrogen shifts prior to unimolecular decomposition to Ge(&#956;&#8208;H)GeH isomer, which is in equilibrium with the vinylidene&#8208;type (H2GeGe) and dibridged (Ge(&#956;&#8208;H2)Ge) isomers. This reaction leads to the formation of cyclic dinuclear germanium molecules, which do not exist on the isovalent C2H2 surface, thus deepening our understanding of the role of nonadiabatic reaction dynamics in preparing nonclassical, hydrogen&#8208;bridged isomers carrying main group XIV elements.

         <title>Simultaneous Organic and Inorganic Host&#8208;Guest Chemistry within Pillararene&#8208;Protein Cage Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular self&#8208;assembly of biomolecules provides a powerful bottom&#8208;up strategy to build functional nanostructures and materials. Among the different biomacromolecules, protein cages offer various advantages including uniform size, versatility, multi&#8208;modularity and high stability. Additionally, protein cage crystals present confined microenvironments with well&#8208;defined dimensions. On the other hand, molecular hosts, such as cyclophanes, possess a defined cavity size and selective recognition of guest molecules. However, successful combination of macrocycles and protein cages to achieve functional co&#8208;crystals have remained limited. In this study, we demonstrate the electrostatic binding between cationic pillar[5]arenes and (apo)ferritin cages, which results in porous and crystalline frameworks. The electrostatically assembled crystals present face&#8208;center cubic (FCC) lattice and have been characterized by means of small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS) and cryo&#8208;TEM. These hierarchical structures result in a multiadsorbent framework capable of hosting both organic and inorganic pollutants, such as dyes and toxic metals, with potential application in water remediation technologies.</dc:description>

The electrostatically assembled crystals present face-center cubic (FCC) lattice and have been characterized by means of small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and cryo-TEM. These hierarchical structures result in a multiadsorbent framework capable of hosting both organic and inorganic pollutants, such as dyes and toxic metals, with potential application in water remediation technologies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Role of anionic backbone in NHC&#8208;stabilized coinage metal complexes: New precursors for atomic layer deposition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cu and Ag precursors that are volatile, reactive, and thermally stable are currently of high interest for their application in atomic layer deposition (ALD) of thin metal films. In pursuit of new precursors for coinage metals namely Cu and Ag, a series of new N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) based Cu(I) and Ag(I) complexes were synthesized. Modifications in the substitution pattern of diketonate&#8208;based anionic backbones led to five monomeric Cu complexes and four closely related Ag complexes with the general formula [M(  tBu  NHC)(R)] (M = Cu, Ag;  tBu  NHC = 1,3&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene; R = diketonate). Thermal analysis indicated that most of the Cu complexes are thermally stable and volatile compared to the more fragile Ag analogs. One of the promising Cu precursors was evaluated for the ALD of nanoparticulate Cu metal deposits using hydroquinone as the reducing agent at appreciably low deposition temperatures (145&#8211;160 &#176;C). This study highlights the considerable impact of the employed ligand sphere on the structural and thermal properties of metal complexes that are relevant for vapor phase processing of thin films.</dc:description>

         <title>Four dibenzofuran&#8208;terminated high triplet energy hole&#8208;transporters for high&#8208;efficiency and long&#8208;life organic light&#8208;emitting devices</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The weak stability of a hole&#8208;transporter upon approaching anion state is one of the major bottlenecks for developing long&#8208;life organic light&#8208;emitting devices (OLEDs). Therefore, in this study, we developed a series of thermally and electrically stable hole&#8208;transporters that are end&#8208;capped with four dibenzofuran units. These materials exhibit (i) high bond dissociation energy (BDE) toward anion state, (ii) high glass transition temperature ( T g&#160; &gt;130 &#176;C), and (iii) high triplet energy ( E T&#160; &gt;2.7 eV), thereby enabling approximately 20% high external quantum efficiency (EQE) and significantly prolonging the stability of both thermally activated delayed fluorescent (TADF) and phosphorescent OLEDs with an operation lifetime at 50% (LT 50 ) of 20000&#8211;30000 h at 1000 cd m &#8208;2 . In addition, investigating their structure&#8208;property relationship revealed that ionization potential ( I P ), BDE, and&#160; T g&#160; are critical prerequisites for the hole&#8208; transporter to prolong lifetime in OLEDs.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing robust oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts with excellent performance is essential for conversion of renewable electricity to clean fuel. Herein, we present a facile concept for the design of efficient high entropy metal&#8208;organic frameworks (HEMOFs) as electrocatalyst by one&#8208;step solvothermal synthesis. The strategy allows for control of the microstructure and corresponding lattice distortion by tuning the metal ion composition. As a result, the OER activity was improved by optimising the coordination environment of the metal catalytic center. The environment affects the electronic density and consequently binding energies of oxygenated intermediates at the metal ion centers. The optimized Co&#8208;rich HEMOFs exhibited a low overpotential of 310 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm &#8208;2 , better than RuO 2 catalyst. The finding involves lattice distortion of the high entropy MOFs provides more strategy for developing high&#8208;performance electrocatalyst for energy conversion.</dc:description>

         <title>Activation by Glutathione in Hypoxic Environment of an Azo&#8208;based Rhodamine Activatable Photosensitizer. A Computational Elucidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the present paper, density functional theory (DFT) has been applied to the study of the activation mechanism of a new selenium azo&#8208;rhodamine (azoSeRho) in presence of the tripeptide thiol, glutathione (GSH), as potent photosensitizer to be employed in photodynamic therapy. The introduction of the azo group into the conjugated system of the seleno&#8208;rhodamine dye and its reaction with GSH allow the selective formation of the active photosensitizer, SeRho. Furthermore, DFT calculations have allowed to shed light on the activation mechanism of the azoSeRho photosensitizer when molecular oxygen is present and hydrogen peroxide is formed. This study is the first theoretical investigation revealing how the reductive cleavage of the azo moiety by GSH occurs. Time&#8208;dependent DFT approach has been used to evaluate the chalcogen&#8208;substitution effect on the structures and photophysical properties of the azo derivatives and, then, on the activated photosensitizers.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanistic Insights on the Mechanosynthesis of Phenytoin, a WHO Essential Medicine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In recent years, mechanochemistry has enriched the toolbox of synthetic chemists, enabling faster and more sustainable access to new materials and existing products, including active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). However, molecular&#8208;level understanding of most mechanochemical reactions remains limited, delaying the implementation of mechanochemistry in industrial applications. Herein, we have applied in&#8208;situ monitoring by Raman spectroscopy to the mechanosynthesis of phenytoin, a World Health Organization (WHO) Essential Medicine, enabling the observation, isolation, and characterization of key molecular&#8208;migration intermediates involved in the single&#8208;step transformation of benzil, urea, and KOH into phenytoin. This work contributes to the elucidation of a reaction mechanism that has been subjected to a number of interpretations over time and paints a clear picture of how mechanosynthesis can be applied and optimized for the preparation of added&#8208;value molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Remote Oxidative Activation of a [Cp*Rh] Monohydride</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Half&#8208;sandwich rhodium monohydrides are often proposed as intermediates in catalysis, but little is known regarding the redox&#8208;induced reactivity accessible to these species. Here, the bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocene (dppf) ligand has been used to explore the reactivity that can be induced when a [Cp*Rh] monohydride undergoes remote (dppf&#8208;centered) oxidation by 1e  &#8211;  . Chemical and electrochemical studies show that one&#8208;electron redox chemistry is accessible to Cp*Rh(dppf), including a unique quasi&#8208;reversible Rh  II/I  process at &#8211;0.96 V vs. ferrocenium/ferrocene (Fc  +/0  ). This redox manifold was confirmed by isolation of an uncommon Rh(II) species, [Cp*Rh(dppf)]  +  , that was characterized by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. Protonation of Cp*Rh(dppf) with anilinium triflate yielded an isolable and inert monohydride, [Cp*Rh(dppf)H]  +  , and this species was found to undergo a quasireversible electrochemical oxidation at +0.41 V vs Fc  +/0  that corresponds to iron&#8208;centered oxidation in the dppf backbone. Thermochemical analysis predicts that this dppf&#8208;centered oxidation drives a dramatic increase in acidity of the Rh&#8211;H moiety by 23 p  K  a  units, a reactivity pattern confirmed by  in situ  1  H NMR studies. Taken together, these results show that remote oxidation can effectively induce M&#8211;H activation and suggest that ligand&#8208;centered redox activity could be an attractive feature for the design of new systems relying on hydride intermediates.</dc:description>

         <title>Kinase sensing based on protein interactions at the catalytic site</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The role kinases play in regulating cellular processes makes them potential biomarkers for detecting the onset and prognosis of various diseases, including many types of cancer. Current kinase biosensors, including electrochemical and radiometric methods, rely on sensing the ATP&#8208;dependent enzymatic phosphorylation reaction. Here we introduce a new type of interaction&#8208;based electrochemical kinase biosensor that does not require any chemical labelling or modification. The basis for sensing is the interactions between the catalytic site of the kinase and the phosphorylation site of its substrate rather than the phosphorylation reaction. We demonstrated this concept with the ERK2 kinase and its substrate protein HDGF, which is involved in lung cancer. A peptide monolayer derived from the HDGF phosphorylation site was adsorbed onto a gold electrode and was used to sense ERK2 without ATP. The sensitivity of the assay was down to 10 nM of ERK2, corresponding with the range of its cellular concentration. Surface chemistry analysis confirmed that ERK2 was bound to the HDGF peptide monolayer. This increased the permeability of redox&#8208;active species through the monolayer and resulted in ERK2 electrochemical sensing. Since our detection approach is based on protein&#8208;protein interactions and not on the enzymatic reaction, it can be further utilized for more selective detection of different types of enzymes.</dc:description>

         <title>Photo&#8208;degradable protein&#8208;polymer hybrid shells for caging living cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>There is growing demand for the precise remote control of cellular functions in various fields. Herein, we report a method for caging mammalian cells by coating with photodegradable protein&#8208;polymer hybrid shells to photo&#8208;control their functions without genetic engineering. A layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer assembly of photocleavable synthetic materials through biotin&#8208;streptavidin (SA) binding was employed for cell coating. The cell surfaces were first biotinylated with photocleavable biotinylated poly(ethylene glycol)(PEG)&#8208;lipid and then coated by repeatedly layering SA and micelles of the PEG&#8208;lipid and photocleavable biotinylated four&#8208;arm PEG. The cell extension and adhesion were suppressed with the shells and then triggered with the degradation of the shells by light exposure. Macrophage phagocytosis was also stopped by caging with the shells and restarted by light&#8208;guided uncaging. This study provides the first proof of principle that cellular functions can be remotely controlled by steric hinderance of cell surfaces with photodegradable materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Carbodiimide&#8208;driven dimerization and self&#8208;assembly of artificial, ribose&#8208;based amphiphiles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The aqueous self&#8208;assembly of amphiphiles into aggregates such as micelles and vesicles has been widely investigated over the past decades with applications ranging from materials science to drug delivery. The combination of characteristic properties of nucleic acids and amphiphiles is of substantial interest to mimic biological self&#8208;organization and compartmentalization. Herein, we present ribose&#8208; and ribonucleotide&#8208;based amphiphiles and investigate their self&#8208;assembly as well as their fundamental reactivity. We found that various types of aggregates are formed, ranging in size from nanometers to micrometers and all amphiphiles exhibit aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) in solution as well as in the solid state. We also observed that the addition of 1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;(3&#8208;dimethylaminopropyl)&#8208;carbodiimide (EDC) leads to rapid and selective dimerization of the amphiphiles into pyrophosphates, which decreases the critical aggregation concentration (CAC) by a factor of 25 when compared to the monomers. Since the propensity for amphiphile dimerization is correlated with their tendency to self&#8208;assemble, our results may be relevant for the formation of rudimentary compartments under prebiotic conditions.</dc:description>

Recently, to broaden the scope of applications, regioselective late&#8208;stage functionalizations on these core moieties have been developed. For instance, with the introduction of electron&#8208;donating groups (EDGs), important bathochromic shifts are observed pushing absorptions towards or in the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) spectral domain while emissive properties disappear essentially completely. Herein, to upset this drawback, acetylene derivatives of cationic diazaoxa triangulenes (DAOTA) and [4]helicenes are prepared (16 examples). Contrary to other EDG&#8208;functionalized derivatives, C&#8801;C&#8208;functionalized products remain broadly fluorescent, with red&#8208;shifted absorptions (Dlabs up to 25 nm) and emissions (Dlem up to 73 nm, FPL up to 51%). Quite interestingly, a general dynamic stereoisomerism phenomenon is evidenced for the compounds derived from achiral DAOTA cores. At low temperature in 1H&#8208;NMR spectroscopy (218 K), N&#8208;CH2 protons become diastereotopic with chemical shifts differences (Dd) as high as +1.64 ppm. The signal coalescence occurs around 273 K with a barrier of ~12 kcal.mol&#8208;1. This phenomenon is due to planar chiral conformations (Sp and Rp configurations), induced by the geometry of the alkyl (n&#8208;propyl) side&#8208;chains next to the acetylenic substituents. Finally, DFT calculations offer a valuable insight on geometries, stereodynamics and on the large difference in NMR for some of the diastereotopic protons.</dc:description>

         <title>Redox replacement of Ag on MOF&#8208;derived Cu/C&#8208;nanoparticles on gas diffusion electrodes for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>During the electrochemical CO  2  reduction reaction, bime&#173;tallic tandem catalysts have emerged as a promising strategy to local&#173;ly increase the CO flux for maximizing the conversion rate towards C&#8208;C coupled products. Considering this, a novel Cu/C&#8208;Ag nanostruc&#173;tured catalyst was prepared by a redox replacement process, where the ratio of both metals can be tuned by the replacement time. An optimum Cu/Ag composition with similarly sized particles showed the highest CO  2  conversion to C  2+  products compared to non&#8208;Ag modified gas&#8208;diffusion electrodes. Gas chromatography and  in&#8208;situ  Raman measurements in a CO  2  gas diffusion cell suggest the formation of top bound linear adsorbed &#1645;CO followed by consumption of CO in the successive cascade steps as evidenced by increasing the &#957;C&#8208;H bands. These findings suggest that two mechanisms are simultane&#173;ously operating towards the production of HCO  2  H and C&#8208;C coupled products on the Cu/Ag bimetallic surface.</dc:description>

         <title>Electronic circular dichroism&#8208;circularly polarized Raman (eCP&#8208;Raman): a new form of chiral Raman spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We summarize recent works on the discovery of a new form of chiral Raman spectroscopy,  e  CP&#8208;Raman, which combines two spectroscopies: electronic circular dichroism (ECD) and circularly polarized Raman (CP&#8208;Raman). First, some puzzling observations while carrying out Raman optical activity (ROA) measurements of several transition metal complexes under resonance are described, as well as the search for the mechanisms responsible. Then an equation for quantifying the  e  CP&#8208;Raman contribution is presented, followed by several examples of how  e  CP&#8208;Raman influences  the  I  R  &#8211; I  L  spectra of achiral and chiral solvent molecules and of a number of chiral solutes under resonance. The conditions to extract resonance ROA, when the  e  CP&#8208;Raman contribution is minimized, are also discussed. Finally, we comment on the potential applications of  e  CP&#8208;Raman.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure and Interaction Based Design of Anti&#8208;SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Aptamers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aptamer selection against novel infections is a complicated and time&#8208;consuming approach. Synergy can be achieved by using computational methods together with experimental procedures. This study aims to develop a reliable methodology for a rational aptamer  in silico  et vitro  design. The new approach combines multiple steps: (1) Molecular design, based on screening in a DNA aptamer library and directed mutagenesis to fit the protein tertiary structure; (2) 3D molecular modeling of the target; (3) Molecular docking of an aptamer with the protein; (4) Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the complexes; (5) Quantum&#8208;mechanical (QM) evaluation of the interactions between aptamer and target with further analysis; (6) Experimental verification at each cycle for structure and binding affinity using small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering, cytometry, and fluorescence polarization. Using a new iterative design procedure, Interaction Based Drug Design (SIBDD), a highly specific aptamer to the receptor&#8208;binding domain of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike protein, was developed and validated.
The SIBDD approach enhances speed of the high&#8208;affinity aptamers development from scratch, using a target protein structure. The method could be used to improve existing aptamers for stronger binding. This approach brings to an advanced level the development of novel affinity probes, functional nucleic acids. It offers a blueprint for the straightforward design of targeting molecules for new pathogen agents and emerging variants.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural and Electronic Properties of Boranes Containing Boron&#8208;Chalcogen Multiple Bonds and Stabilized by&#160;Amido Imidazoline&#8208;2&#8208;imine Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The stabilization of elusive monomeric species containing multiple boron&#8208;chalcogen bonds has motivated the investigation of sophisticated ligand systems in the past few years. Recently, a series of neutral, Lewis acid&#8208;free chalcogenboranes were prepared by incorporation of an amido imidazoline&#8208;2&#8208;imine as the supporting ligand (  Frank et al., Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2021, 60, 4633  ), resulting in well&#8208;defined molecular entities with pronounced multiple bond character, B=X (X = O, S, Se, Te). In view of the potential use of N&#8208;heterocyclic boranes (NHB=X) as ligands in catalysis and fine chemistry, we evaluated in this work the bonding properties of the new B=X compounds based on a&#160;&#960;&#8208;backdonation model. The electronic properties of systems in question were modulated via systematic modifications of the NHB ring with respect to ligand variation, saturation, size, and heteroatom substitutions. Investigations on the B=X bond length and order, calculated by means of density functional theory methods, reveal enhanced B=X bonding properties for NHB rings with high electron delocalization in the NHB ring and bearing electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents; a fact that was also confirmed by computational assessment of electron interactions of the B=X species with a dicarbonyl manganese complex. We expect that the analysis will contribute to the rational optimization of existing ligands as well as the development of new moieties, which would further allow for exploration of new boron chemistry.</dc:description>

Ed. 2021, 60, 4633  ), resulting in well-defined molecular entities with pronounced multiple bond character, B=X (X = O, S, Se, Te). In view of the potential use of N-heterocyclic boranes (NHB=X) as ligands in catalysis and fine chemistry, we evaluated in this work the bonding properties of the new B=X compounds based on a&#160;&#960;-backdonation model. The electronic properties of systems in question were modulated via systematic modifications of the NHB ring with respect to ligand variation, saturation, size, and heteroatom substitutions. Investigations on the B=X bond length and order, calculated by means of density functional theory methods, reveal enhanced B=X bonding properties for NHB rings with high electron delocalization in the NHB ring and bearing electron-withdrawing substituents; a fact that was also confirmed by computational assessment of electron interactions of the B=X species with a dicarbonyl manganese complex. We expect that the analysis will contribute to the rational optimization of existing ligands as well as the development of new moieties, which would further allow for exploration of new boron chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tuning the (Chir)optical Properties and Squeezing out the Inherent Chirality in Polyphenylene&#8208;Locked Helical Carbon Nanorings</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Distorting linear polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) out of planarity affects their physical properties and breaks their symmetry to induce inherent chirality. However, the chirality cannot be achieved in large distorted PAHs&#8208;based macrocycles due to low racemization barrier for isomerization. Herein we report the precise synthesis and tuning size&#8208;dependent (chir)optical properties of a new class of chiral PAHs&#8208;containing conjugated macrocycles (cyclo[n]paraphenylene&#8208;2,6&#8208;anthrylene, [n]CPPAn2,6; n = 6&#8208;8). Their inherent chiralities were squeezed out in small anthrylene&#8208;based macrocycles. Efficient resolutions for chiral enantiomers with (P)/(M)&#8208;helicity of small [6&#8208;7]CPPAns were achieved by HPLC. Interestingly, these macrocycles showed enriched size&#8208;dependent physical, chiral, and (chir)optical properties. Theoretical calculations indicate that these macrocycles have high strain energy (Estrain = 60.8 to 73.4 kcal/mol) and very small Egap (~3.0 eV). Notably, these enantiomers showed strong chiroptical properties and dissymmetry factors (|gabs| and |glum| ~0.01 for an enantiomer of [6]CPPAn2,6), which can give them potential applications in optically active materials.</dc:description>
