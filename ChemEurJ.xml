         <title>The Effect of Water on the 2&#8208;Propanol Oxidation Activity of Co&#8208;Substituted LaFe1&#8722;CoxO3 Perovskites</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The effect of water addition on 2&#8208;propanol oxidation was studied on LaFe1&#8208;xCoxO3 catalysts. After surpassing a Co content threshold (x=0.15) the effect of water on the activity at elevated temperatures is beneficial due to slower Co3+ reduction and the number of hydroxide species on the catalyst surface increased.







Abstract
Perovskites are interesting oxidation catalysts due to their chemical flexibility enabling the tuning of several properties. In this work, we synthesized LaFe1&#8722;xCoxO3 catalysts by co&#8208;precipitation and thermal decomposition, characterized them thoroughly and studied their 2&#8208;propanol oxidation activity under dry and wet conditions to bridge the knowledge gap between gas and liquid phase reactions. Transient tests showed a highly active, unstable low&#8208;temperature (LT) reaction channel in conversion profiles and a stable, less&#8208;active high&#8208;temperature (HT) channel. Cobalt incorporation had a positive effect on the activity. The effect of water was negative on the LT channel, whereas the HT channel activity was boosted for x&gt;0.15. The boost may originate from a slower deactivation rate of the Co3+ sites under wet conditions and a higher amount of hydroxide species on the surface comparing wet to dry feeds. Water addition resulted in a slower deactivation for Co&#8208;rich catalysts and higher activity in the HT channel state.

         <title>Activation of Molecular O2 on CoFe2O4 (001) Surfaces: An Embedded Cluster Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Activation pathways for dioxygen on the (001) surfaces of inverse spinel CoFe2O4 were investigated using the periodic electrostatic embedded cluster model. Reduction of molecular O2 into superoxide is relatively facile, whereas the subsequent dissociation into reactive monoatomic species is associated with large energy barriers that may limit the rate of oxidation processes. Of the metal&#8208;O species, [FeIII&#8722;O]2+ is thermodynamically most stable.







Abstract
Dioxygen activation pathways on the (001) surfaces of cobalt ferrite, CoFe2O4, were investigated computationally using density functional theory and the hybrid Perdew&#8208;Burke&#8208;Ernzerhof exchange&#8208;correlation functional (PBE0) within the periodic electrostatic embedded cluster model. We considered two terminations: the A&#8208;layer exposing Fe2+ and Co2+ metal sites in tetrahedral and octahedral positions, respectively, and the B&#8208;layer exposing octahedrally coordinated Co3+. On the A&#8208;layer, molecular oxygen is chemisorbed as a superoxide on the Fe monocenter or bridging a Fe&#8722;Co cation pair, whereas on the B&#8208;layer it is adsorbed at the most stable anionic vacancy. Activation is promoted by transfer of electrons provided by the d metal centers onto the adsorbed oxygen. The subsequent dissociation of dioxygen into monoatomic species and surface reoxidation have been identified as the most critical steps that may limit the rate of the oxidation processes. Of the reactive metal&#8208;O species, [FeIII&#8722;O]2+ is thermodynamically most stable, while the oxygen of the Co&#8722;O species may easily migrate across the A&#8208;layer with barriers smaller than the associative desorption.

         <title>Rh(I)/(III)&#8208;N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Complexes: Effect of Steric Confinement Upon Immobilization on Regio&#8208; and Stereoselectivity in the Hydrosilylation of Alkynes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel Rh(III) pentamethylcyclopentadienyl and Rh(I) complexes containing chelating N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes have been prepared and used in the hydrosilylation of 1&#8208;alkynes. Selected catalysts were immobilized within the mesopores of SBA&#8208;15. The confinement effects either provided by the ligands or the mesoporous support have been studied and allow for hydrosilylation with &#946;(Z)&#8208;selectivity of up to 100&#8201;% with both Rh(I) and Rh(III) complexes.







Abstract
Rh(I) NHC and Rh(III) Cp* NHC complexes (Cp*=pentamethylcyclopentadienyl, NHC=N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene=pyrid&#8208;2&#8208;ylimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene (Py&#8722;Im), thiophen&#8208;2&#8208;ylimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) are presented. Selected catalysts were selectively immobilized inside the mesopores of SBA&#8208;15 with average pore diameters of 5.0 and 6.2&#8197;nm. Together with their homogenous progenitors, the immobilized catalysts were used in the hydrosilylation of terminal alkynes. For aromatic alkynes, both the neutral and cationic Rh(I) complexes showed excellent reactivity with exclusive formation of the &#946;(E)&#8208;isomer. For aliphatic alkynes, however, selectivity of the Rh(I) complexes was low. By contrast, the neutral and cationic Rh(III) Cp* NHC complexes proved to be highly regio&#8208; and stereoselective catalysts, allowing for the formation of the thermodynamically less stable &#946;&#8208;(Z)&#8208;vinylsilane isomers at room temperature. Notably, the SBA&#8208;15 immobilized Rh(I) catalysts, in which the pore walls provide an additional confinement, showed excellent &#946;&#8208;(Z)&#8208;selectivity in the hydrosilylation of aliphatic alkynes, too. Also, in the case of 4&#8208;aminophenylacetylene, selective formation of the &#946;(Z)&#8208;isomer was observed with a neutral SBA&#8208;15 supported Rh(III) Cp* NHC complex but not with its homogenous counterpart. These are the first examples of high &#946;(Z)&#8208;selectivity in the hydrosilylation of alkynes by confinement generated upon immobilization inside mesoporous silica.

         <title>Methane Activation by (MoO3)5O&#8722; Cluster Anions: The Importance of Orbital Orientation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The C&#8722;H activation of CH4 by the bridging oxygen radical (Ob.&#8722;) over molybdenum oxide cluster anions has been experimentally identified under thermal collision conditions. The empty 2p orbital of Ob.&#8722; is perpendicular to the surface of (MoO3)5O&#8722; cluster that is superior to the (MoO3)6O&#8722; cluster that contains a Ob.&#8722; radical with the empty 2p orbital being parallel to the cluster surface.







Abstract
The reactivity of the molybdenum oxide cluster anion (MoO3)5O&#8722;, bearing an unpaired electron at a bridging oxygen atom (Ob.&#8722;), towards methane under thermal collision conditions has been studied by mass spectrometry and density functional theory calculations. This reaction follows the mechanism of hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) and is facilitated by the Ob.&#8722; radical center. The reactivity of (MoO3)5O&#8722; can be traced back to the appropriate orientation of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMO) that is essentially the 2p orbital of the Ob.&#8722; atom. This study not only makes up the blank of thermal methane activation by the Ob.&#8722; radical on negatively charged clusters but also yields new insights into methane activation by the atomic oxygen radical anions.

&lt;sup&gt;.&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; radical center. The reactivity of (MoO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; can be traced back to the appropriate orientation of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMO) that is essentially the 2p orbital of the O&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;.&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; atom. This study not only makes up the blank of thermal methane activation by the O&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;.&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; radical on negatively charged clusters but also yields new insights into methane activation by the atomic oxygen radical anions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Putting Anion&#8208;&#960; Interactions at Work for Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The emergence and development of the concept of &#8220;anion&#8208;&#960; catalysis&#8221;, that employing an electron&#8208;deficient &#960; surface for anionic intermediate and transition state stabilization, is illustrated. Different activation modes are presented to highlight the essential contribution of anion&#8208;&#960; interactions, from both ground&#8208;state and transition&#8208;state stabilization to solely transition&#8208;state stabilization, and to cooperative &#960;&#8208;face activation.







Abstract
Since its discovery two decades ago, anion&#8208;&#960; interaction has been increasingly recognized as an important driving force. Extensive theoretical and experimental efforts on the ground&#8208;state anion&#8208;&#960; binding and recognition have laid the bases for exploring its relevance in catalysis. Accordingly, the concept of &#8220;anion&#8208;&#960; catalysis&#8221; that employing an electron&#8208;deficient &#960; surface (&#960;&#8208;acidic surface) for anionic reaction intermediate and transition state stabilization has emerged. This article shortly reviews the emergence and development of this concept, aiming to provide an emphasis on the general concept and key progress in this exciting area. To highlight the essential contribution of anion&#8208;&#960; interactions, the contents are organized according to their role engaged in catalytic process, for example from both ground&#8208;state and transition&#8208;state stabilization to solely transition&#8208;state stabilization, mainly by a single &#960;&#8208;face, and to cooperative &#960;&#8208;face activation. A concluding remark and outlook on future development of this field is also given.

         <title>Formation of Stable NiIII N&#8208;Confused Porphyrins Aided by a 3&#8208;Ethoxy Group</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis, structures and reactivities of two stable NiIII N&#8208;confused porphyrin complexes 4 and 5 are reported. They were synthesized by oxidation of a NiII intermediate 3 and characterized by MS, UV&#8208;vis and EPR spectroscopy. The structures of 4 and 5 were unambiguously confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. The effects of the 3&#8208;ethoxy substitute and the reactivities of 4 and 5 were investigated.







Abstract
We report the synthesis, characterization, and reactivities of two stable NiIII N&#8208;confused porphyrin (NCP) complexes. Metalation of 3&#8208;OEt NCP 1 with NiCl2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;6H2O in CHCl3/EtOH gave 3&#8208;OEt NiII NCP 3 initially, which was easily oxidized in air to form the NiIII complex of NCP inner C&#8208;oxide 4. Bis&#8208;ethoxy&#8208;modified NiIII complex 5 was synthesized by oxidation of 3 with PIFA in ethanol and CHCl3. The structures of 4 and 5 were determined by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. An unusually long NiIII&#8722;C bond (2.170(9) &#197;) was observed in 4. The g&#8208;factor (g&gt;2.1) observed in the EPR spectra of 4 and 5 further confirmed that they are paramagnetic NiIII complexes. Comparative experiments showed that the 3&#8208;ethoxy group plays an important role in the formation of 4 and 5. Reduction of 4 and 5 with NaBH4 regenerated complex 3.

Masked amino systems: The design of a molecular entity for the auto&#8208;immolative release of fluorophores and its application for the synthesis of two turn&#8208;on fluorophore probes both responding to physiological conditions of H2S is reported (see scheme).







Abstract
Masked trimethyl lock (TML) systems as molecular moieties enabling the bioresponsive release of compounds or dyes in a controlled temporal and spatial manner have been widely applied for the development of drug conjugates, prodrugs or molecular imaging tools. Herein, we report the development of a novel amino trimethyl lock (H2N&#8208;TML) system as an auto&#8208;immolative molecular entity for the release of fluorophores. We designed Cou&#8208;TML&#8208;N3 and MURh&#8208;TML&#8208;N3, two azide&#8208;masked turn&#8208;on fluorophores. The latter was demonstrated to selectively release fluorescent MURh in the presence of physiological concentrations of the redox&#8208;signaling molecule H2S in&#8197;vitro and was successfully applied to image H2S in human cells

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Dehydrogenative C&#8722;H Silylation of Alkynylsilanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multitasking silanes: Cobalt&#8208;catalyzed sp C&#8722;H silylation by a dehydrogenative coupling between silylacetylenes and hydrosilanes is reported. As a result, a variety of complex organosilicon derivatives was obtained. An inexpensive and easy&#8208;to&#8208;synthesize catalyst can be used due to the dual role of phenylsilane as substrate and activator.







Abstract
Herein, we report that a cobalt catalyst permits the general synthesis of substituted alkynylsilanes through dehydrogenative coupling of alkynylsilanes and hydrosilanes. Several silylated alkynes, including di&#8208; and trisubstituted ones, were prepared in a one&#8208;step procedure. Thirty&#8208;seven compounds were synthesized for the first time by applying our catalyst system. The alkynylsilanes bearing hydrosilyl moieties provide an opportunity for further functionalization (e.&#8201;g., hydrosilylation). The use of primary silanes as substrates and precatalyst activators permits the use of inexpensive and easily accessible 3d metal precatalysts, and avoids the presence of additional activators.

Methanobenzo[7]annulenes. Parts&#8208;per&#8208;million catalyst loading for [3+2]&#8208;annulations. An unprecedented, ppm&#8208;level, catalytic asymmetric [3+2]&#8208;annulation of 3&#8208;alkyl&#8208;lawsones with nitroethylenes is reported. It is an efficient, sustainable, catalytic asymmetric annulation reaction for the synthesis of chiral methanobenzo[7]annulenes, which are part of many antibiotics.







Abstract
3&#8208;Alkyl&#8208;lawsones selectively reacted with &#945;&#8208;alkyl&#8208;nitroethylenes under 500 parts&#8208;per&#8208;million (ppm) quinine&#8208;NH&#8208;thiourea&#8208;catalysis to furnish the chiral methanobenzo[7]annulenes in up to &gt;99&#8201;% ee with &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr and TON up to 1820 through tandem Michael/Henry [3+2]&#8208;annulations. These asymmetric ppm&#8208;level, catalytic tandem [3+2]&#8208;annulations would be highly inspirational for the design of many more ppm&#8208;level organocatalytic reactions, and at the same time these final molecules are basic skeletons of antibiotics.

         <title>Synthesis of Non&#8208;Aqueous Neptunium(III) Halide Solvates from NpO2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Neptunium's fundamental chemistry is understudied when compared to the rest of the periodic table and early actinides like uranium and thorium. Therefore, synthesis of starting materials is of utmost importance for investigation of its chemical properties. NpO2 was dissolved in HCl and converted to two novel neptunium(III) solvated halides, NpI3(THF)4 and NpBr3(THF)4. The reported syntheses are convenient and do not require neptunium metal.







Abstract
Two Np(III) halides, NpI3(THF)4 and NpBr3(THF)4, have been prepared and isolated in high yields as described in this work. Starting with neptunia (NpO2), NpCl4(DME)2 was first generated in an updated, higher yielding synthesis than what was previously reported by using HCl/HF. This material was then reduced with KC8, followed by subsequent ligand exchange, to generate NpBr3(THF)4 and NpI3&#8208;(THF)4. Full characterization by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography, 1H NMR spectroscopy and electronic absorption spectroscopy confirmed the molecular formulas and oxidation states. These trivalent materials are straightforward to synthesize and can be used as starting materials for non&#8208;aqueous Np(III) chemistry, obviating the need for rare and restricted Np metal and elemental halogens.

Effect of halide substituents on spin and phase transitions in Mn(III) complexes







Abstract
Three tetraphenylborates of mononuclear Mn(III) cation complexes with hexadentate ligands, the products of the reaction between a N,N&#8242;&#8208;bis(3&#8208;aminopropyl)ethylenediamine and salicylaldehydes with the different haloid substitutions at the 5 or 3,5 positions, have been synthesized: [Mn(5&#8208;F&#8208;sal&#8208;N&#8208;1,5,8,12)]BPh4 (1), [Mn(3,5&#8208;diCl&#8208;sal&#8208;N&#8208;1,5,8,12)]BPh4 (2) and [Mn(3,5&#8208;Br,Cl&#8208;sal&#8208;N&#8208;1,5,8,12)]BPh4 (3). Their crystal structure, dielectric constant (&#1013;) and magnetic properties have been studied. Ligand substituents have a dramatic effect on the structure and magnetic properties of the complexes. With decreasing temperature, the complex (1) shows a gradual spin crossover from the high&#8208;spin state (HS) to the HS:LS intermediate phase, followed by an abrupt transition to the low&#8208;spin state (LS) without changing the crystal symmetry. The complexes 2 and 3 are isostructural, but have fundamentally different properties. Complex 2 demonstrates two structural phase transitions related to sharp spin crossovers from the HS to the HS:LS intermediate phase at 137&#8197;K and from the intermediate phase to the LS at 87&#8197;K, while complex 3 exhibits only one spin transition from the HS to the HS:LS intermediate phase at 83&#8197;K.

         <title>Ring Size Determines the Conformation, Global Aromaticity and Photophysical Properties of Macrocyclic Oligofurans</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In &#960;&#8208;conjugated macrocycles, there is a trade&#8208;off between the global and local expression of effects such as aromaticity, with the outcome of the trade&#8208;off determined by the geometry and aromaticity of the constituent units. Compared with other aromatic rings, furan aromaticity is relatively low, and therefore global effects in macrocyclic furans are expected to be more pronounced. Following our introduction of macrocyclic oligofuran, we present the first synthesis of a series of &#960;&#8208;conjugated bifuran macrocycles of various ring sizes, from trimer to hexamer, and characterize them using both computational and experimental methods. The properties of macrocyclic oligofurans change considerably with size: The smaller trimer is rigid, non&#8208;emissive and planar as revealed by its single crystal structure, and displays global antiaromaticity, while the larger pentamer and hexamer are flexible, emissive, have non&#8208;planar structures, and exhibit local aromaticity. The results are supported by NICS and ACID calculations that indicate the global antiaromaticity of planar furan macrocycles, and by transient absorption measurements showing sharp absorption bands for the trimer and only the internal conversion decay pathway.</dc:description>

         <title>How 5f electron polarizability drives covalency and selectivity in actinide N&#8208;donor complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a series of isostructural tetravalent actinide (Th, U&#8208;Pu) complexes with the  N  &#8208;donor ligand  N  ,  N  '&#8208;ethylene&#8208;bis((pyrrole&#8208;2&#8208;yl)methanimine) (H  2  L, H  2  pyren). Structural data from SC&#8208;XRD analysis reveal [An(pyren)  2  ] complexes with different An&#8211;N  imine  vs. An&#8211;N  pyrrolide  bond lengths, respectively. Quantum chemical calculations elucidate the bonding situation, including differences in covalent character of the coordinative bonds. A comparison to the intensely studied analogous  N  ,  N  &#8242;&#8208; ethylene&#8208; bis(salicylideneimine) (H  2  salen) based complexes [An(salen)  2  ] displays on average almost equal electron sharing of pyren or salen with the An(IV), pointing to a potential ligand&#8208;cage&#8208;driven complex stabilization. This is shown in the fixed ligand arrangement of pyren and salen in the respective An(IV) complexes. The overall bond strength of the pure  N  &#8208;donor ligand pyren to An(IV) (An=Th, U, Np, Pu) is slightly weaker compared

to salen, with the exception of the Pa(IV) complex, which exhibits extraordinarily high electron sharing of pyren with Pa(IV). Such an altered ligand preference within the early An(IV) series points to a specificity of the 5  f  1  configuration, which can be explained by polarization effects of the 5  f  electrons, allowing strongest  f  electron backbonding from Pa(IV) (5  f  1  ) to the  N  &#8208;donors of pyren.</dc:description>

         <title>Perovskite Light&#8208;emitting Electrochemical Cells Employing Electron Injection/Transport Layers of Ionic Transition Metal Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently, perovskites have attracted intense attention due to their high potential in optoelectronic applications. Employing perovskites as the emissive materials of light&#8208;emitting electrochemical cells (LECs) shows the advantages of simple fabrication process, low&#8208;voltage operation, compatibility with inert electrodes, along with saturated electroluminescence (EL) emission. Different from previously reported perovskite LECs, in which salts are incorporated in the emissive layer, we separate the ion&#8208;transport layer from the emissive layer in this work. The layer of ionic transition metal complex (iTMC) not only provides mobile ions but also serves as an electron injection/transport layer. Orthogonal solvents are used in spin coating to prevent intermixing of stacked perovskite and iTMC layers. The blue iTMC with high ionization potential is effective in blocking holes from the emissive layer and thus ensures EL color saturation. In addition, the carrier balance of the perovskite/iTMC LECs can be optimized by adjusting the iTMC layer thickness. The optimized external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the CsPbBr3/iTMC LEC reach 6.8%, which is among the highest reported values for perovskite LECs so far. Compared with mixing all components in a single emissive layer, this work successfully demonstrates that separating the layer of ion transport, electron injection and transport from the perovskite emissive layer is more effective in adjusting device carrier balance. As such, solution&#8208;processable perovskite/iTMC LECs open up a new way to realize efficient perovskite LECs.</dc:description>

         <title>Catechol Moiety Integrated Tri&#8208;aryl Type AIEgen for Visual and Quantitative Boronic Acid Detection</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Novel functional AIEgen based on three compact bound aryl skeletons is designed and synthesized. This tri&#8208;aryl type luminogen (TA&#8208;Catechol) embedded with catechol moiety responds rapidly to series of boronic acids. Real&#8208;time visual and quantitative dual&#8208;mode detection method is established for the first time with modest precision and low detection limit (8.0 &#956;M). Detailed mechanistic discussion identifies tetra&#8208;coordinated boronic species as the key intermediate within sensing procedure. Wide range of organic boronic acids compatible with this strategy is displayed which is promising in high throughput screening technology. Furthermore, solid&#8208;state sensing capability of TA&#8208;Catechol is also demonstrated.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning the reactivity of substrate for SNAP&#8208;tag expands its application for recognition&#8208;driven DNA&#8208;protein conjugation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recognition&#8208;driven modification has been emerging as a novel approach to modify biomolecular targets of interest site&#8208;specifically and efficiently. To this end, the protein modular adaptors (MAs) are the ideal reaction model for recognition&#8208;driven modification of DNA, which constitute both a sequence&#8208;specific DNA&#8208;binding domain (DBD) and a self&#8208;ligating protein&#8208;tag. Coupling the DNA recognition by DBD and the chemoselective reaction of protein tag could provide a highly efficient sequence&#8208;specific reaction. However, combination of MA consisting of a reactive protein&#8208;tag and its substrate,  e.g.,  SNAP&#8208;tag and benzyl guanine (BG), revealed rather non&#8208;selective reaction with DNA. Here, we designed new substrates of SNAP&#8208;tag to realize the sequence&#8208;selective rapid closslinking reaction by MAs with SNAP&#8208;tag. The reactions of substrates to SNAP&#8208;tag were verified by kinetic analyses to enable the sequence&#8208;selective crosslinking reaction of MA. The new substrate enables distinctive orthogonality of SNAP&#8208;tag against CLIP&#8208;tag to achieve the orthogonal DNA&#8208;protein cross&#8208;linking reaction by six unique MAs.</dc:description>

         <title>Bulky PNP ligands blocking metal&#8208;ligand cooperation allow for isolation of Ru(0), and lead to catalytically active Ru complexes in acceptorless alcohol dehydrogenation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We synthesized two 4Me&#8208;PNP ligands which block metal&#8208;ligand cooperation (MLC) with the Ru center and compared their Ru complex chemistry to their two traditional analogues used in acceptorless alcohol dehydrogenation catalysis. The corresponding 4Me&#8208;PNP complexes, which do not undergo dearomatization upon addition of base, allowed us to obtain rare, albeit unstable, 16 electron mono CO Ru(0) complexes. Reactivity with CO and H  2  allows for stabilization and extensive characterization of bis CO Ru(0) 18 electron and Ru(II) cis and trans dihydride species that were also shown to be capable of C(sp2)&#8208;H activation. Reactivity and catalysis are contrasted to non&#8208;methylated Ru(II) species, showing that an MLC pathway is not necessary, with dramatic differences in outcomes during catalysis between  i  Pr and  t  Bu PNP complexes within each of the 4Me and non&#8208;methylated backbone PNP series being observed. Unusual intermediates are characterized in one of the new and one of the traditional complexes, and a common catalysis deactivation pathway was identified.</dc:description>

         <title>Flexibility control of two&#8208;dimensional coordination polymers by crystal morphology: Water adsorption and thermal expansion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Layer flexibility in two&#8208;dimensional coordination polymers (2D&#8208;CPs) contributes to several functional materials as results in anisotropic structural response to external stimuli. Chemical modification is a common technique for modifying layer structures. Herein, we demonstrate that crystal morphology of a cyanide&#8208;bridged 2D&#8208;CP of type [Mn(salen)]  2  [ReN(CN)  4  ] (  1  ) consisting of flexible undulating layers significantly impacts the layer configuration and assembly. Nanoplates of  1  showed an in&#8208;plane contraction of layers with a longer interlayer distance compared to the micrometer&#8208;sized rod&#8208;type particles. These effects by crystal morphology on the structure of the 2D&#8208;CP impacted the structural flexibility, resulting in dual&#8208;functional changes: the enhancement of the sensitivity of structural transformation to water adsorption and modification of anisotropic thermal expansion of  1  . Moreover, the nanoplates incorporated new adsorption sites within the layers, resulting in the uptake of an additional water molecule compared to the micrometer&#8208;sized rods.</dc:description>

         <title>Gold N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Catalysts for the Hydrofluorination of Alkynes Using Hydrofluoric Acid: Reaction Scope, Mechanistic Studies and the Tracking of Elusive Intermediates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An efficient and chemoselective methodology deploying gold&#8208; N &#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) complexes as catalysts in the hydrofluorination of terminal alkynes using aqueous HF has been developed. Mechanistic studies shed light on an in situ generated catalyst, formed by the reaction of Br&#248;nsted basic gold pre&#8208;catalysts with HF in water, which exhibits the highest reactivity and chemoselectivity. The catalytic system has a wide alkyl substituted&#8208;substrate scope, and stoichiometric as well as catalytic reactions with tailor&#8208;designed gold pre&#8208;catalysts enable the identification of various gold species involved along the catalytic cycle. Computational studies aid in understanding the chemoselectivity observed through examination of key mechanistic steps for phosphine&#8208; and NHC&#8208;coordinated gold species bearing the triflate counterion and the elusive key complex bearing a bifluoride counterion.</dc:description>

N&#8208;Amino&#8208;1,8&#8208;naphthalimide was used as a protecting group and a reagent to selective synthesis of various mono&#8208;N&#8208;substituted hydrazines and hydrazides. In all these reactions, the protecting reagent N&#8208;amino&#8208;1,8&#8208;naphthalimide was easily regenerated in good yields by the hydrazinolysis. All these transformations showed good functional&#8208;group tolerance and can be used for large scale C&#8722;N cross&#8208;coupling reactions.







Abstract
A new route to synthesis of various mono&#8208;N&#8208;substituted hydrazines and hydrazides by involving in a new C&#8722;N bond formation by using N&#8208;amino&#8208;1,8&#8208;naphthalimide as a regenerated precursor was invented. Aniline and phenylhydrazines are reproduced upon reacting these individually with 1,8&#8208;naphthalic anhydride followed by hydrazinolysis. The practicality and simplicity of this C&#8722;N dihalo alkanes; developed a synthon for bond formation protocol was exemplified to various hydrazines and hydrazides. N&#8208;amino&#8208;1,8&#8208;naphthalimide is suitable synthon for transformation for selective formation of mono&#8208;substituted hydrazine and hydrazide derivatives. Those are selective mono&#8208;amidation of hydrazine with acid halides; mono&#8208;N&#8208;substituted hydrazones from aldehydes; synthesis of N&#8208;aminoazacycloalkanes from acetohydrazide scaffold and inserted to hydroxy derivatives; distinct synthesis of N,N&#8208;dibenzylhydrazines and N&#8208;benzylhydrazines from benzyl halides; synthesis of N&#8208;amino&#8208;amino acids from &#945;&#8208;halo esters. Ecofriendly reagent N&#8208;amino&#8208;1,8&#8208;naphthalimide was regenerated with good yields by the hydrazinolysis in all procedures.

         <title>Expedient Access to Cyanated N&#8208;Heterocycles by Direct Flow&#8208;Electrochemical C(sp2)&#8722;H Activation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust and scalable C(sp2)&#8722;H electrocyanation of aromatic N&#8208;heterocycles is reported. The protocol employs nBu4NCN as cyanide source and is performed in an undivided cell making it amenable to both batch and flow set&#8208;ups. A total of 44 examples were synthesized in batch and 14 in flow, including privileged drug&#8208;like heterocycles, such as pyrroles, imidazoles, (aza)indoles, and indazoles. The method displays high functional&#8208;group tolerance and, for the first time, allows to directly cyanate unprotected N&#8722;H indoles.







Abstract
Nitriles are recurring motifs in bioactive molecules and versatile functional groups in synthetic chemistry. Despite recent progress, direct introduction of a nitrile moiety in heteroarenes remains challenging. Recent developments in electrochemical reactions pave the way to more practical cyanation protocols. However, currently available methods typically require hazardous cyanide sources, expensive mediators, and often suffer from narrow substrate scope and laborious reaction set&#8208;up. To address the limitations of current synthetic methods, herein, an effective, sustainable, and scalable procedure for the direct C(sp2)&#8722;H cyanation of aromatic N&#8208;heterocycles with a user&#8208;friendly flow&#8208;electrochemical set&#8208;up is reported. Furthermore, high substrate and functional&#8208;group tolerance is demonstrated, allowing late&#8208;stage functionalization of drug&#8208;like scaffolds, such as natural products and pharmaceuticals.

         <title>Host&#8208;Guest Complexation Between Cyclodextrins and Hybrid Hexavanadates: What are the Driving Forces?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 62, Page 15516-15527, November 5, 2021. </description>

Hydrophobic or chaotropic effect? Hybrid Lindqvist&#8208;type polyoxovanadates self&#8208;assemble with cyclodextrins (&#945;&#8208;, &#946;&#8208;, and &#947;&#8208;) in water to form a wide variety of host&#8208;guest complexes. Such a supramolecular process originates from the ability of the CD host to desolvate the hybrid guests, but the nature of this solvent effect depends on the cyclodextrins, inducing direct consequences on redox properties of the guest.







Abstract
Host&#8208;guest complexes between native cyclodextrins (&#945;&#8208;, &#946;&#8208; and &#947;&#8208;CD) and hybrid Lindqvist&#8208;type polyoxovanadates (POVs) [V6O13((OCH2)3C&#8722;R)2]2&#8211; with R = CH2CH3, NO2, CH2OH and NH(BOC) (BOC = N&#8208;tert&#8208;butoxycarbonyl) were studied in aqueous solution. Six crystal structures determined by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis revealed the nature of the functional R group strongly influences the host&#8211;guest conformation and also the crystal packing. In all systems isolated in the solid&#8208;state, the organic groups R are embedded within the cyclodextrin cavities, involving only a few weak supramolecular contacts. The interaction between hybrid POVs and the macrocyclic organic hosts have been deeply studied in solution using ITC, cyclic voltammetry and NMR methods (1D 1H NMR, and 2D DOSY, and ROESY). This set of complementary techniques provides clear insights about the strength of interactions and the binding host&#8208;guest modes occurring in aqueous solution, highlighting a dramatic influence of the functional group R on the supramolecular properties of the hexavanadate polyoxoanions (association constant K1:1 vary from 0 to 2 000&#8197;M&#8722;1) while isolated functional organic groups exhibit only very weak intrinsic affinity with CDs. Electrochemical and calorimetric investigations suggest that the driving force of the host&#8208;guest association involving larger CDs (&#946;&#8208; and &#947;&#8208;CD) is mainly related to the chaotropic effect. In contrast, the hydrophobic effect supported by weak attractive forces appears as the main contributor for the formation of &#945;&#8208;CD&#8208;containing host&#8208;guest complexes. In any cases, the origin of driving forces is clearly related to the ability of the macrocyclic host to desolvate the exposed moieties of the hybrid POVs.

         <title>A Full Flexible NH4+ Ion Battery Based on the Concentrated Hydrogel Electrolyte for Enhanced Performance</title>

A full flexible ammonium ion battery composed of a concentrated hydrogel electrolyte sandwiched between a NH4V3O8&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2.9H2O nanobelts cathode and a polyaniline anode is reported. The simple synthesis of the hydrogel using ammonium sulfate, xanthan gum and water, allows to facilely tune and optimize the salt concentration in the electrolyte, to maximize its ionic conductivity and transport kinetics. It is found that the battery based on the electrolyte prepared using 3&#8197;M ammonium sulfate solution exhibits the best performance.







Abstract
Non&#8208;metal ammonium (
) ions have recently been explored as effective charge carriers in battery systems due to their abundancy, light weight, small hydration shells in water. The research concerning the use of 
 redox chemistry in batteries, particularly in flexible batteries, is still in its infancy. For the first time, we report a flexible full 
 ion battery (AIB) composed of a concentrated hydrogel electrolyte sandwiched between NH4V3O8&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2.9H2O nanobelts cathode and polyaniline (PANI) anode, for enhanced performance. The hydrogel electrolyte is simply synthesized by using ammonium sulfate, xanthan gum and water. As a reference, the AIB based on the liquid aqueous electrolyte is prepared first, which exhibits a capacity of 121&#8197;mAh g&#8722;1 and a capacity retention of 95&#8201;% after 400 cycles at a specific current of 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. On the other hand, the simple synthesis of the hydrogel electrolyte allows us to facilely tune and optimize the salt contents in the electrolyte, to maximize the ionic conductivity, transport kinetics, mechanical characteristics, and consequently the battery performance. It is found that the flexible battery based on the hydrogel electrolyte prepared from 3&#8197;M ammonium sulfate solution shows the best electrochemical performance, i.&#8201;e., a capacity of 60&#8197;mAh g&#8722;1 while maintaining a capacity retention of 88&#8201;% after 250 cycles at a specific current of 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. Moreover, the flexible AIB retains excellent electrochemical performance when bent at different angles, demonstrating remarkable mechanical strength and flexibility. Therefore, this study sheds new light on the utilization of concentrated hydrogel electrolyte in the AIB chemistry, for developments of novel electrochemical energy storage technology with high safety and low cost.

 ion battery (AIB) composed of a concentrated hydrogel electrolyte sandwiched between NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2.9H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O nanobelts cathode and polyaniline (PANI) anode, for enhanced performance. The hydrogel electrolyte is simply synthesized by using ammonium sulfate, xanthan gum and water. As a reference, the AIB based on the liquid aqueous electrolyte is prepared first, which exhibits a capacity of 121&#8197;mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and a capacity retention of 95&#8201;% after 400 cycles at a specific current of 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. On the other hand, the simple synthesis of the hydrogel electrolyte allows us to facilely tune and optimize the salt contents in the electrolyte, to maximize the ionic conductivity, transport kinetics, mechanical characteristics, and consequently the battery performance. It is found that the flexible battery based on the hydrogel electrolyte prepared from 3&#8197;M ammonium sulfate solution shows the best electrochemical performance, i.&#8201;e., a capacity of 60&#8197;mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; while maintaining a capacity retention of 88&#8201;% after 250 cycles at a specific current of 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Moreover, the flexible AIB retains excellent electrochemical performance when bent at different angles, demonstrating remarkable mechanical strength and flexibility. Therefore, this study sheds new light on the utilization of concentrated hydrogel electrolyte in the AIB chemistry, for developments of novel electrochemical energy storage technology with high safety and low cost.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Modelling of kinetics using density functional theory, combined with numerical simulation, reveals that methylaluminoxane activators are sheets formed by assembly of linear oligomers, wherein the statistics and mechanism of aggregation favor formation of even&#8208;numbered sheets.







Abstract
Methylaluminoxane (MAO) activators have sheet structures which form ion&#8208;pairs on reaction of neutral donors such as octamethyltrisiloxane (OMTS). The ion&#8208;pairs can be detected by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI&#8208;MS) in polar media. The growth of these reactive precursors during hydrolysis of Me3Al can be monitored using ESI&#8208;MS. Density functional theory, combined with numerical simulation of growth, indicates that this process involves rapid formation of low MW oligomers, followed by assembly of these species into low MW sheets. These can grow through further addition of low MW oligomers or by fusion into larger sheets. The mechanism of these growth processes leads to the prediction that even&#8208;numbered sheets should be favored, and this surprising result is confirmed by ESI&#8208;MS monitoring experiments of both activator growth and MAO aging.

         <title>SnS Nanosheets for Rapid and Effective Bacteria Sterilization Under Near&#8208;infrared Irradiation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 62, Page 15434-15439, November 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Developing new antibacterial agents that can kill bacteria quickly and effectively is very urgent. SnS nanosheets are synthesized using a simple solvothermal method. SnS nanosheets generate heat as well as reactive oxygen species such as .OH, .O2&#8722; and 1O2 under near&#8208;infrared irradiation. Therefore, SnS nanosheets effectively inhibit the growth of Gram&#8208;negative and Gram&#8208;positive bacteria through the synergistic effect of photothermal therapy (PTT) and photodynamic therapy (PDT).







Abstract
Today, the threat of pathogenic bacterial infection worldwide that leads to the increase of mortality rate strongly demands the development of new antibacterial agents that can kill bacteria quickly and effectively. Although there are a lot of antibacterial agents that have been developed so far, few studies on the antibacterial performance of SnS have been investigated at 808&#8197;nm laser. Here, we synthesized SnS nanosheets with strong near&#8208;infrared absorption performance and excellent antibacterial performance via a simple solvothermal synthesis route. The as&#8208;prepared SnS nanosheets showed excellent photothermal conversion efficiency (38.7&#8201;%), photodynamic performance, and photostability, and at the same time 99.98&#8201;% and 99.7&#8201;% sterilization effect against Gram&#8208;negative Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Gram&#8208;positive Bacillus subtilis (B. subtilis) under near&#8208;infrared irradiation (808&#8197;nm, 1.5&#8197;W/cm2). This study suggests that SnS nanosheets could be a promising candidate for antibacterial therapy owing to the synergetic effects of photothermal and photodynamic performance.

Different 1&#8208;aryl&#8208;3&#8208;alkyl imidazolium ionic liquids (tunable aryl alkyl ionic liquids, TAAILs) with electron withdrawing and electron donating substituents on the phenyl ring of the cation, various alkyl chain lengths and the bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide (LiNTf2) anion have been prepared. Their physical properties, such as melting points, thermal decomposition, viscosity and electrochemical window, are described to give a broad overview of this class of organic salts.







Abstract
Tunable aryl alkyl ionic liquids (TAAILs) based on the imidazolium cation were first reported in 2009. Since then, a series of TAAILs with different properties due to the electron&#8208;donating or &#8208;withdrawing effect of the substituents at the aryl ring has been developed. Herein, a wide variety of those ionic liquids (ILs) is presented in terms of their cation structure. The authors synthesized ILs containing the bromide or bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide anion and 1&#8208;aryl&#8208;3&#8208;alkyl imidazolium cations with various substituents in the ortho and/ or para position of the phenyl ring and alkyl chains of different lengths varying from butyl to dodecyl. The differences of their physical properties (melting point, thermal decomposition, viscosity, electro&#8208;chemical window) of these ILs are reported according to their structure.

The precise path to pincers: Density functional theory studies of the bridge splitting of [PtIIR2(SEt2)]2 (R=Me, 4&#8208;tolyl) by bromoarenes containing nitrogen donor groups, and subsequent intramolecular coordination&#8208;assisted oxidative addition, elucidate for R=4&#8208;tolyl the mechanism for formation of mer&#8208;PtII(N,C,N)Br pincers via platinum(IV) intermediates. The pincers are known for their applications in fundamental and applied chemistry.







Abstract
Density functional theory computation indicates that bridge splitting of [PtIIR2(&#956;&#8208;SEt2)]2 proceeds by partial dissociation to form R2Pta(&#956;&#8208;SEt2)PtbR2(SEt2), followed by coordination of N&#8208;donor bromoarenes (L&#8208;Br) at Pta leading to release of PtbR2(SEt2), which reacts with a second molecule of L&#8208;Br, providing two molecules of PtR2(SEt2)(L&#8208;Br&#8208;N). For R=4&#8208;tolyl (Tol), L&#8208;Br=2,6&#8208;(pzCH2)2C6H3Br (pz=pyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl) and 2,6&#8208;(Me2NCH2)2C6H3Br, subsequent oxidative addition assisted by intramolecular N&#8208;donor coordination via PtIITol2(L&#8208;N,Br) and reductive elimination from PtIV intermediates gives mer&#8208;PtII(L&#8208;N,C,N)Br and Tol2. The strong &#963;&#8208;donor influence of Tol groups results in subtle differences in oxidative addition mechanisms when compared with related aryl halide oxidative addition to palladium(II) centres. For R=Me and L&#8208;Br=2,6&#8208;(pzCH2)2C6H3Br, a stable PtIV product, fac&#8208;PtIVMe2{2,6&#8208;(pzCH2)2C6H3&#8208;N,C,N)Br is predicted, as reported experimentally, acting as a model for undetected and unstable PtIVTol2{L&#8208;N,C,N}Br undergoing facile Tol2 reductive elimination. The mechanisms reported herein enable the synthesis of PtII pincer reagents with applications in materials and bio&#8208;organometallic chemistry.

For R=4-tolyl (Tol), L-Br=2,6-(pzCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Br (pz=pyrazol-1-yl) and 2,6-(Me&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Br, subsequent oxidative addition assisted by intramolecular N-donor coordination via Pt&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;Tol&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(L-&lt;i&gt;N,Br&lt;/i&gt;) and reductive elimination from Pt&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt; intermediates gives &lt;i&gt;mer&lt;/i&gt;-Pt&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;(L-&lt;i&gt;N,C,N&lt;/i&gt;)Br and Tol&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The strong &#963;-donor influence of Tol groups results in subtle differences in oxidative addition mechanisms when compared with related aryl halide oxidative addition to palladium(II) centres. For R=Me and L-Br=2,6-(pzCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Br, a stable Pt&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt; product, &lt;i&gt;fac&lt;/i&gt;-Pt&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt;Me&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;{2,6-(pzCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-&lt;i&gt;N,C,N&lt;/i&gt;)Br is predicted, as reported experimentally, acting as a model for undetected and unstable Pt&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt;Tol&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;{L-&lt;i&gt;N,C,N&lt;/i&gt;}Br undergoing facile Tol&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reductive elimination.

         <title>Halogen Bonding Propensity in Solution: Direct Observation and Computational Prediction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 62, Page 15472-15478, November 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strongly activated halogen bond donors give rise to observable bound and unbound states in Raman spectroscopy when paired with good halogen bond acceptors. The two strongest halogen bond donors examined have almost identical electrostatic potentials, but differ vastly in theoretical binding affinity and experimental halogen bonding strength. The energy terms giving rise to this behavior are elucidated by energy decomposition analysis.







Abstract
Halogen&#8208;bonded complexes are often designed by consideration of electrostatic potential (ESP) predictions. ESP predictions do not capture the myriad variables associated with halogen bond (XB) donors and acceptors; thus, binding interaction cannot be quantitatively predicted. Here, a discrepancy between predictions based on ESP energy difference (&#916;Vs) and computed gas phase binding energy (&#916;Ebind) motivated the experimental determination of the relative strength of halogen bonding interactions in solution by Raman spectroscopic observation of complexes formed from interacting five iodobenzene&#8208;derived XB donors and four pyridine XB acceptors. Evaluation of &#916;Ebind coupled with absolutely&#8208;localized molecular orbital energy decomposition analysis (ALMO&#8208;EDA) deconvolutes halogen bonding energy contributions and reveals a prominent role for charge transfer (CT) interactions. Raman spectra reveal &#916;Ebind accurately predicts stronger interactions within iodopentafluorobenzene (IPFB) complexes than with 1&#8208;iodo&#8208;3,5&#8208;dinitrobenzene (IDNB) complexes even though IPFB has similar electrostatics to IDNB and contains a smaller &#963;&#8208;hole.

         <title>Computational Analysis of Photophysical Properties and Reactivity of a New Phototherapeutic Cyclometalated Au(III)&#8208;Hydride Complex</title>

         <dc:description>
The reactivity exploration by DFT and TD&#8208;DFT of a cyclometalated Au(III)&#8208;hydride complex, as the first member of a new series of Au(III) complexes, has confirmed the low hydricity in dark and the high propensity to undergo substitution reactions leading to H2 release when irradiated. Computational photophysical characterization has allowed the identification of the excited singlet and triplet states involved in substitution reactions. Two&#8208;photon excitation feasibility has been also tested.







Abstract
Gold(III) complexes have recently emerged as new versatile and efficacious metal containing anticancer agents. In an attempt to reconcile the specific affinity of such complexes for target sulfur containing biomolecules with their capability to strongly bind thiol&#8208;containing compounds widely distributed in non&#8208;tumoral cells, a new series of cyclometalated Au(III)&#8208;hydride complexes has been proposed as photoactivatable anticancer prodrugs. Here, the computational exploration of the photophysical properties and reactivity in dark and under light irradiation of the first member of the series, named 1&#8201;a, is reported. Complex 1&#8201;a low hydricity in dark together with facile hydride substitution leading to H2 elimination under excitation by visible light have been examined by means of DFT and TD&#8208;DFT computations. Both singlet and triplet excited states have been characterized, allowing the identification of the active species involved in photoactivation pathways leading to the controlled detachment of the hydride ligand. Also the viable two&#8208;photon activation at the ideal phototherapeutic window has been investigated.

Pd&#8208;Complexes with N&#8208;Boc protected amino acids catalyze diastereoselective oxidative double C&#8722;H functionalization of chiral ferrocenyl amines with heteroarenes. A range of thiophene, pyrrole, furan and indole ferrocene derivative can be obtained in a single step and in high diastereomeric purities. C&#8722;H activation products can be transformed to corresponding phosphines. 19F NMR and DFT calculations helped elucidate reaction mechanism and reasons for stereoinduction.







Abstract
Diastereoselective double C&#8722;H heteroarylation of chiral ferrocenes provides valuable compounds with multiple functionalities using mild reaction conditions and simple reagents. Pd&#8208;Complexes with chiral mono&#8208;protected amino acids afforded corresponding heteroarylated ferrocenyl amines in good yields and high diastereomeric purities. In this way, a variety of indole, thiophene, pyrrole, or furan substituents were introduced to the ferrocene moiety. Furthermore, a range of relevant functional groups, for example ketone, ester, chloro, nitro, or silyl, are tolerated by this method. An alternative combination of amino acid and ferrocenyl amine configurations was leveraged to provide the complementary diastereomeric products. The products of C&#8722;H heteroarylation can be transformed into corresponding phosphines. Absolute configurations of CH&#8208;activation products were confirmed by the combination of X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis and CD spectroscopy. 19F NMR kinetic study and DFT calculations provided insights into the reaction mechanism and reasons governing stereoinduction.

         <title>Trinuclear Cyanido&#8208;Bridged [Cr2Fe] Complexes: To Be or not to Be a Single&#8208;Molecule Magnet, a Matter of Straightness</title>

         <dc:description>
Cyanido&#8208;bridged trinuclear [CrIII2FeII] complexes were investigated in order to assess the influence of the bending of the apical Fe&#8722;N&#8801;C linkages on their SMM behaviors. A comparative examination of the structural and magnetic properties showed an obvious effect of the deviation from straightness of the M&#8722;N&#8801;C alignment on the slow relaxation of the magnetization exhibited by the complexes. Theoretical calculations have highlighted important effects on both the magnetic anisotropy of the FeII center and the exchange interactions with the CrIII units.







Abstract
Trinuclear systems of formula [{Cr(LN3O2Ph)(CN)2}2M(H2LN3O2R)] (M=MnII and FeII, LN3O2R stands for pentadentate ligands) were prepared in order to assess the influence of the bending of the apical M&#8722;N&#8801;C linkages on the magnetic anisotropy of the FeII derivatives and in turn on their Single&#8208;Molecule Magnet (SMM) behaviors. The cyanido&#8208;bridged [Cr2M] derivatives were obtained by assembling trans&#8208;dicyanido CrIII complex [Cr(LN3O2Ph)(CN)2]&#8722; and divalent pentagonal bipyramid complexes [MII(H2LN3O2R)]2+ with various R substituents (R=NH2, cyclohexyl, S,S&#8208;mandelic) imparting different steric demand to the central moiety of the complexes. A comparative examination of the structural and magnetic properties showed an obvious effect of the deviation from straightness of the M&#8722;N&#8801;C alignment on the slow relaxation of the magnetization exhibited by the [Cr2Fe] complexes. Theoretical calculations have highlighted important effects of the bending of the apical C&#8722;N&#8722;Fe linkages on both the magnetic anisotropy of the FeII center and the exchange interactions with the CrIII units.

         <title>Full&#8208;Atom Model of the Agonist LPS&#8208;Bound Toll&#8208;like Receptor 4 Dimer in a Membrane Environment</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 62, Page 15406-15425, November 5, 2021. </description>

Pushing against the limits of all&#8208;atom molecular dynamics simulations&#8242; capability, the agonist lipopolysaccharide&#8208;bound full&#8208;length Toll&#8208;like receptor 4 dimer complex, embedded into a realistic plasma membrane, is addressed. Atomic/molecular and thermodynamic insights are provided for TLR4&#8242;s assembly and biological activity.







Abstract
The Toll&#8208;like receptor 4 (TLR4)/myeloid differentiation factor 2 (MD&#8208;2) innate immunity system is a membrane receptor of paramount importance as therapeutic target. Its assembly, upon binding of Gram&#8208;negative bacteria lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and also dependent on the membrane composition, finally triggers the immune response cascade. We have combined ab&#8208;initio calculations, molecular docking, all&#8208;atom molecular dynamics simulations, and thermodynamics calculations to provide the most realistic and complete 3D models of the active full TLR4 complex embedded into a realistic membrane to date. Our studies give functional and structural insights into the transmembrane domain behavior in different membrane environments, the ectodomain bouncing movement, and the dimerization patterns of the intracellular Toll/Interleukin&#8208;1 receptor domain. Our work provides TLR4 models as reasonable 3D structures for the (TLR4/MD&#8208;2/LPS)2 architecture accounting for the active (agonist) state of the TLR4, and pointing to a signal transduction mechanism across cell membrane. These observations unveil relevant molecular aspects involved in the TLR4 innate immune pathways and will promote the discovery of new TLR4 modulators.

         <title>Autotandem Catalysis: Inexpensive and Green Access to Functionalized Ketones by Intermolecular Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Amidoalkynylation/Hydration Cascade Reaction via N&#8208;Acyliminium Ion Chemistry</title>

Autotandem catalysis: Iron(III) catalysts were shown to efficiently catalyze intermolecular alkynylation reactions of various alkoxy, acetoxylactams, and hydroxylactams. This chemistry broadens the scope of iron catalysis by highlighting new aspects of iron salts &#963;&#8208;Lewis acidity. More importantly, this approach is amenable to an unprecedented tandem intermolecular alkynylation/intramolecular hydration sequence affording expedient access to a new carbonyl structures.







Abstract
Iron&#8208;based catalysts were applied in cascade&#8208;type reactions for the synthesis of different carbonyl compounds. The reactions proceeded by a new iron&#8208;catalyzed cascade of alkynylation/hydration by using both the &#963;&#8208; and &#960;&#8208;Lewis acid properties of iron salts. The alkynylation reactions of several endo and exocyclic acetoxylactams were achieved with three different catalysts including FeCl3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;6H2O, FeCl3, and Fe(OTf)3 showing the efficiency of &#963;&#8208;Lewis acidity of iron (III) salts in catalyzing the alkynylation reaction. We also demonstrated that the reaction sequence could be shortened by the direct use of hydroxylactams, leading to an environmentally friendly protocol, avoiding the need to perform unnecessary lengthy steps. A combination of the hard/soft iron Lewis acid properties was then used to implement an unprecedented tandem intermolecular alkynylation/intramolecular hydration sequence allowing expedient access to a new carbonyl structures from trivial materials.

         <title>A Titanium and Tantalum Phosphate LiNaTiTa2P2O13 with An Open Framework hosting Li and Na Ions</title>

LiNaTiTa2P2O13 displays an open framework comprised of staggered [Ti1/3Ta2/3O3]&#8734; layers and PO4 tetrahedra with a herringbone&#8208;like stacking pattern, similar to monophosphate niobium bronzes. The existence of pentagonal tunnels, hosting the Li+ and Na+ ions, endow LiNaTiTa2P2O13 a moderate ion transport capability (4.67&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S/cm at 823&#8197;K). In addition, the layers constituted by corner&#8208;sharing TiO6 and TaO6 octahedra endow a possibility as being photo&#8208;catalyst. The successful substitution of Nb for Ta results in the optical absorption red&#8208;shifted towards visible range with a narrowing band gap comparable to that of TiO2 (3.2&#8197;eV).







Abstract
Herein, we report a detailed structural, electric, thermal and optical analysis of a titanium and tantalum phosphate LiNaTiTa2P2O13. The title compound is comprised of typical ReO3&#8208;type layers constituted by corner&#8208;sharing TiO6 and TaO6 octahedra, bridged by PO4 tetrahedra, and the structure is closely related to monophosphate niobium bronzes. The existence of pentagonal tunnels, hosting the Li+ and Na+ ions, endows LiNaTiTa2P2O13 a moderate ion transportation behavior (4.67&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S/cm at 823&#8197;K). In addition, the successful substitution of Nb for Ta in LiNaTiTa2P2O13 results in the optical absorption red&#8208;shift towards visible range with a narrowing band gap, which may provide a route of isomorphic replacement to band engineering for photo&#8208;catalysis.

         <title>One&#8208;Step Synthesis and Schlenk&#8208;Type Equilibrium of Cyclopentadienylmagnesium Bromides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 62, Page 15508-15515, November 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclopentadienylmagnesium bromides are accessible with high yields by a fast and smooth one&#8208;pot synthesis. In hydrocarbons and in ethereal solvents a dissociative Schlenk equilibrium is operative interconverting heteroleptic compounds into homoleptic congeners.







Abstract
In the in&#8197;situ Grignard metalation method (iGMM), the addition of bromoethane to a suspension of magnesium turnings and cyclopentadienes [C5H6 (HCp), C5H5&#8208;Si(iPr)3 (HCpTIPS)] in diethyl ether smoothly yields heteroleptic [(Et2O)Mg(CpR)(&#956;&#8208;Br)]2 (CpR=Cp (1), CpTIPS (2)). The Schlenk equilibrium of 2 in toluene leads to ligand exchange and formation of homoleptic [Mg(CpR)2] (3) and [(Et2O)MgBr(&#956;&#8208;Br)]2 (4).

     alt="One-Step Synthesis and Schlenk-Type Equilibrium of Cyclopentadienylmagnesium Bromides"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cyclopentadienylmagnesium&lt;/b&gt; bromides are accessible with high yields by a fast and smooth one-pot synthesis. In hydrocarbons and in ethereal solvents a dissociative Schlenk equilibrium is operative interconverting heteroleptic compounds into homoleptic congeners.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the in&#8197;situ Grignard metalation method (iGMM), the addition of bromoethane to a suspension of magnesium turnings and cyclopentadienes [C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; (HCp), C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;-Si(&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;Pr)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (HCp&lt;sup&gt;TIPS&lt;/sup&gt;)] in diethyl ether smoothly yields heteroleptic [(Et&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)Mg(Cp&lt;sup&gt;R&lt;/sup&gt;)(&#956;-Br)]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (Cp&lt;sup&gt;R&lt;/sup&gt;=Cp (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;), Cp&lt;sup&gt;TIPS&lt;/sup&gt; (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;)). The Schlenk equilibrium of &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; in toluene leads to ligand exchange and formation of homoleptic [Mg(Cp&lt;sup&gt;R&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] (&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;) and [(Et&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)MgBr(&#956;-Br)]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;).

The origin of the pyramidalization of the oxygen center in biarylsilyl oxoniums salts was studied through NMR and X&#8208;ray diffraction studies of a series of biphenylsilyl oxonium salts, and supported by DFT calculations.







Abstract
The structure determination of a series of biphenylsilyloxonium cations through NMR and XRD studies, supported by DFT calculations was carried out, allowing to get insights into the origin of the oxygen pyramidalization in biphenyl and binaphthylsilyl oxoniums. Low barrier of inversion in the oxygenyl series points toward a key role of the biaryl axis in the inversion of configuration at the oxygen center.

         <title>Prolonging the Triplet State Lifetimes of Rhenium Complexes with Imidazole&#8208;Pyridine Framework for Efficient CO2 Photoreduction</title>

CO2 photoreduction: A series of new mononuclear rhenium(I) complexes with imidazole&#8208;pyridine framework based on the long&#8208;lived excited triplet state exhibit satisfactory stability and catalytic efficiency in photoreduction of CO2 to CO. This work emphasizes the practice and importance of tailored photocatalyst design on molecular level, representing appealing and potentially applications for phosphorescent catalysts in CO2 reduction to solar fuels.







Abstract
The photocatalytic reduction of CO2 into fuels offers the prospect for creating a new CO2 economy. Harnessing visible light&#8208;driven CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO reduction mediated by the long&#8208;lived triplet excited state of rhenium(I) tricarbonyl complexes is a challenging approach. We here develop a series of new mononuclear rhenium(I) tricarbonyl complexes (Re&#8208;1&#8722;Re&#8208;4) based on the imidazole&#8208;pyridine skeleton for photo&#8208;driven CO2 reduction. These catalysts are featured by combining pyridyl&#8208;imidazole with the aromatic ring and different pendant organic groups onto the N1 position of 1,3&#8208;imidazole unit, which display phosphorescence under Ar&#8208;saturated solution even at ambient conditions. By contrast, {Re[9&#8208;(pyren&#8208;1&#8208;yl)&#8208;10&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;9H&#8208;pyreno[4,5&#8208;d]imidazole)](CO)3Cl} (Re&#8208;4) by introducing pyrene ring at the N1 position of pyrene&#8208;fused imidazole unit exhibits superior catalytic performance with a higher turnover number for CO (TONCO=124) and &gt;99.9&#8201;% selectivity, primarily ascribed to the strong visible light&#8208;harvesting ability, long&#8208;lived triplet lifetimes (164.2&#8197;&#956;s) and large reductive quenching constant. Moreover, the rhenium(I) tricarbonyl complexes derived from &#960;&#8208;extended pyrene chromophore exhibit a long lifetime corresponding to its ligand&#8208;localized triplet state (3IL) evidenced from spectroscopic investigations and DFT calculations.

Teaching silver to do the trick. Most crucial steps towards oxidative trifluoromethylation via AgI/AgIII redox shuttles are herein deciphered. This innovative cross&#8208;coupling, analogous to the CEL coupling popularized by copper, involves: i) easy AgI/AgIII 2e&#8722; oxidation; ii) phen ligation to AgIII; iii) boron&#8208;to&#8208;AgIII aryl transfer; and iv) benzotrifluoride production from aryl&#8208;AgIII intermediates. Now, AgIIICF3 chemistry is safe and reachable from AgF, KF, CF3TMS and air.







Abstract
In ample variety of transformations, the presence of silver as an additive or co&#8208;catalyst is believed to be innocuous for the efficiency of the operating metal catalyst. Even though Ag additives are required often as coupling partners, oxidants or halide scavengers, its role as a catalytically competent species is widely neglected in cross&#8208;coupling reactions. Most likely, this is due to the erroneously assumed incapacity of Ag to undergo 2e&#8722; redox steps. Definite proof is herein provided for the required elementary steps to accomplish the oxidative trifluoromethylation of arenes through AgI/AgIII redox catalysis (i.&#8201;e. CEL coupling), namely: i) easy AgI/AgIII 2e&#8722; oxidation mediated by air; ii) bpy/phen ligation to AgIII; iii) boron&#8208;to&#8208;AgIII aryl transfer; and iv) ulterior reductive elimination of benzotrifluorides from an [aryl&#8208;AgIII&#8208;CF3] fragment. More precisely, an ultimate entry and full characterization of organosilver(III) compounds [K]+[AgIII(CF3)4]&#8722; (K&#8208;1), [(bpy)AgIII(CF3)3] (2) and [(phen)AgIII(CF3)3] (3), is described. The utility of 3 in cross&#8208;coupling has been showcased unambiguously, and a large variety of arylboron compounds was trifluoromethylated via [AgIII(aryl)(CF3)3]&#8722; intermediates. This work breaks with old stereotypes and misconceptions regarding the inability of Ag to undergo cross&#8208;coupling by itself.

         <title>Triaminocyclopentadienyl Ruthenium Complexes &#8211; New Catalysts for Cascade Conversions of Propargyl Alcohols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 62, Page 15545-15553, November 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Triaminocyclopentadienyl ruthenium complexes are useful catalysts for cascade conversions of propargyl alcohols with CH&#8208;acidic nucleophiles. Their catalytic activities complement the activities of known diaminocyclopentadienone ruthenium complexes. A wide range of cyclic terpenoid and phloroglucinol adducts are obtained by complementary application of both types of catalysts.







Abstract
Various triaminocyclopentadienyl ruthenium complexes have been synthesized from Ru3(CO)12. The new complexes were tested for their ability to catalyze cascade conversions of propargyl alcohols. Their associated catalytic activities complement the activities of known diaminocyclopentadienone ruthenium complexes. In particular, the substrate scope of catalytic cycloadditions with 3&#8208;ketolactones or phloroglucinol derivatives is extended to terpenoid&#8208;derived propargyl alcohols containing an internal alkyne moiety. A wide range of cyclic terpenoid and phloroglucinol adducts are obtained by complementary application of both types of catalysts.

&lt;p&gt;Various triaminocyclopentadienyl ruthenium complexes have been synthesized from Ru&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(CO)&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;. The new complexes were tested for their ability to catalyze cascade conversions of propargyl alcohols. Their associated catalytic activities complement the activities of known diaminocyclopentadienone ruthenium complexes. In particular, the substrate scope of catalytic cycloadditions with 3-ketolactones or phloroglucinol derivatives is extended to terpenoid-derived propargyl alcohols containing an internal alkyne moiety. A wide range of cyclic terpenoid and phloroglucinol adducts are obtained by complementary application of both types of catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

In a musical allegory for chemical synthesis a guitar player in a flask creates notes that become an organic compound. Even a gifted musician needs a good instrument to express her/his talent in the best possible way. Likewise, even a skillful chemist needs a set of tools that allows new molecules to be constructed efficiently. In their Review (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202102108), O.&#8197;O.&#8197;Grygorenko et&#8197;al. cover one example of such tools&#8212;saturated boronic derivatives. Applications of the title compounds in synthetic and medicinal chemistry are discussed. Artwork by Vitalii Boklashchuk.

Computational full&#8208;atom models of the agonist lipopolysaccharide (LPS)&#8208;bound Toll&#8208;like receptor 4 (TLR4) embedded into a realistic plasma membrane reveal dynamic functional and structural insights of the TLR4 activation and signaling across the membrane, the ectodomain bouncing movement, and dimerization patterns (symmetric and asymmetric) of the intracellular Toll/interleukin&#8208;1 receptor (TIR) domain. These studies unveil molecular aspects of the TLR4, main actor in the innate immune pathways, and will promote the discovery of new TLR4 modulators. More information can be found in the Full Paper by S. Martin&#8208;Santamaria et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202102995).

Various obstacles stand in the way of translating photothermal through&#8208;tissue treatments from the lab to the clinic. The topical use of NPs displaying PTE appears to be a safer, or at least easier, application, minimizing the risks of NP internalization and only requiring low irradiance. Non&#8208;biomedical niche applications of photothermal NPs &#8211; anticounterfeit tags, proteinaceous micropatterns with embedded photothermal NPs or photothermally tunable polysulfone membranes for water filtration &#8211; have similar advantages. For more details, see the Minireview by P. Pallavicini, G. Chirico, and A. Taglietti on page 15361&#8197;ff.

The aldol&#8208;type reaction became one of the forefathers of C&#8722;C bond formation reactions. Advancements in the synthetic methodology resulted in the development of chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and stereoselective processes. This Review focuses on reductive aldol&#8208;type alkylation methods implemented to the synthesis of ten approved drug substances. Furthermore, retrosynthetic analysis demonstrates that other active pharmaceutical ingredients could be obtained via reductive Aldol&#8208;type reactions. For more information, see the Review by S. Runikhina et&#8197;al. on page&#8197;15327&#8197;ff.

Even a gifted musician needs a good instrument to present his/her talent in the best possible light. In the same way, organic and medicinal chemists require good synthetic tools to construct their molecules reliably and conveniently. Organoboron compounds have provided such an opportunity for many decades; nevertheless, they are currently receiving increasing attention. This is especially true for saturated boronic derivatives that are widely used as building blocks either to introduce a boron&#8208;containing moiety into a potential drug molecule or to create new C(sp3)&#8722;C/C(sp3)&#8208;heteroatom bonds with enormous efficiency. In their Review on page 15277&#8197;ff, Volochnyuk, Gorlova, and Grygorenko cover both of these applications, as well as numerous synthetic approaches to the title compounds.

Organoboron compounds have provided such an opportunity for many decades; nevertheless, they are currently receiving increasing attention. This is especially true for saturated boronic derivatives that are widely used as building blocks either to introduce a boron-containing moiety into a potential drug molecule or to create new C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;C/C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)-heteroatom bonds with enormous efficiency. In their Review on &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/chem.202102108"&gt;page 15277&#8197;ff&lt;/a&gt;, Volochnyuk, Gorlova, and Grygorenko cover both of these applications, as well as numerous synthetic approaches to the title compounds.

Density functional theory studies of bridge&#8208;splitting of [PtIIR2(SEt2)]2 (R = 4&#8208;tolyl) by bromoarenes containing nitrogen donor groups, subsequent intramolecular coordination assisted oxidative addition, and reductive elimination elucidate the mechanism for formation of mer&#8208;PtII(N,C,N)Br pincers via PtIV, where the pincers have applications in fundamental and applied chemistry. While the research covers the breaking of bridges, it has built a collaborative bridge between Utrecht and Hobart that has stood for over 30 years. More information can be found in the Full Paper by A.&#8197;J. Canty et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202102687).

Landing to explore beneath the silvery reflection of the moon, the unusual air oxidation of silver was investigated, granting access to the homoleptic anion [AgIII(CF3)4]&#8722; (1). The crew compartment of the Lunar Lander illustrates the structure of 1 mimicking the heraldic Occitan Cross, symbol of Occitania, where this work was developed. Compound 1 reacts with 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline leading to the organosilver(III) compound [(phen)AgIII(CF3)3], which is depicted in the descent stage of the Lunar Lander. Upon addition of aryl boron derivatives and base, [(phen)AgIII(CF3)3] undergoes aromatic trifluoromethylation. More information can be found in the Full Paper by N. Nebra et&#8197;al.

         <title>Harvesting Light To Produce Heat: Photothermal Nanoparticles for Technological Applications and Biomedical Devices</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 62, Page 15361-15374, November 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photothermal effect is the ability to transform absorbed electromagnetic radiation into heat. Although it was first studied in nonspherical Au nanoparticles with NIR localized surface plasmon resonance absorptions for through&#8208;tissues hyperthermal tumor ablation, for more than 20&#8197;years this effect has been recognized in nanoparticles of different materials and shapes, and used for a wide spectrum of biomedical and technical applications, which are reviewed here.







Abstract
The photothermal properties of nanoparticles (NPs), that is, their ability to convert absorbed light into heat, have been studied since the end of the last century, mainly on gold NPs. In the new millennium, these studies have developed into a burst of research dedicated to the photothermal ablation of tumors. However, beside this strictly medical theme, research has also flourished in the connected areas of photothermal antibacterial surface coatings, gels and polymers, of photothermal surfaces for cell stimulation, as well as in purely technological areas that do not involve medical biotechnology. These include the direct conversion of solar light into heat, a more efficient sun&#8208;powered generation of steam and the use of inkjet&#8208;printed patterns of photothermal NPs for anticounterfeit printing based on temperature reading, to cite but a few. After an analysis of the photothermal effect (PTE) and its mechanism, this minireview briefly considers the antitumor&#8208;therapy theme and takes an in&#8208;depth look at all the other technological and biomedical applications of the PTE, paying particular attention to photothermal materials whose NPs have joined those based on Au.

Organoboron compounds. The chemistry of saturated boronic acids, boronates, and trifluoroborates is reviewed. Applications of the title compounds in the design of boron&#8208;containing drugs and as tools to construct C(sp3)&#8722;C and C(sp3)&#8208;heteroatom bonds are discussed. The current state of the art in the synthesis of saturated boronic derivatives is described, with a special focus on methodologies developed over the last decade.







Abstract
This review discusses recent advances in the chemistry of saturated boronic acids, boronates, and trifluoroborates. Applications of the title compounds in the design of boron&#8208;containing drugs are surveyed, with special emphasis on &#945;&#8208;amino boronic derivatives. A general overview of saturated boronic compounds as modern tools to construct C(sp3)&#8722;C and C(sp3)&#8208;heteroatom bonds is given, including recent developments in the Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura and Chan&#8208;Lam cross&#8208;couplings, single&#8208;electron&#8208;transfer processes including metallo&#8208; and organocatalytic photoredox reactions, and transformations of boron &#8220;ate&#8221; complexes. Finally, an attempt to summarize the current state of the art in the synthesis of saturated boronic acids, boronates, and trifluoroborates is made, with a brief mention of the &#8220;classical&#8221; methods (transmetallation of organolithium/magnesium reagents with boron species, anti&#8208;Markovnikov hydroboration of alkenes, and the modification of alkenyl boron compounds) and a special focus on recent methodologies (boronation of alkyl (pseudo)halides, derivatives of carboxylic acids, alcohols, and primary amines, boronative C&#8722;H activation, novel approaches to alkene hydroboration, and 1,2&#8208;metallate&#8208;type rearrangements).

Abstract
The efficient chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and stereoselective formation of saturated carbon&#8208;carbon fragment is the critical challenge of organic synthesis; therefore, developing new methods for formation of these bonds is paramount. The rising interest for reductive aldol&#8208;type reactions is conditioned by its versatile applications, allowing the efficient formation of carbon&#8208;carbon bonds. The review aims to highlight the advantages and disadvantage of reductive aldol&#8208;type reactions to total synthesis of pharmaceutical substances in order to summarize knowledge and encourage further investigation of the field.

Butterfly&#8208;like triarylamine dyads were synthesized through modified Sonogashira coupling reactions, which exhibit good solubility, thermal stability, and high charge carrier mobilities in OFET.







Abstract
Highly &#960;&#8208;extended butterfly&#8208;shaped triarylamine dyads with aryleneethynylene spacer were constructed using an efficient synthetic route. These aryleneethynylene&#8208;bridged dyads are highly fluorescent and exhibited high HOMO levels, and low bandgaps, which are suitable for high&#8208;performance p&#8208;type OFETs. The field&#8208;effect transistors were fabricated through a solution&#8208;processable method and exhibited promising p&#8208;type performance with field&#8208;effect mobility up to 4.3&#8197;cm2/Vs and high Ion/off of 108 under ambient conditions.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light Mediated Tryptophan Modification in Oligopeptides Employing Acylsilanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 62, Page 15392-15395, November 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photo click chemistry was used for the selective modification of the indole moiety in various tryptophan&#8208;containing di&#8208;, tri&#8208; and tetra&#8208;peptides. The process uses aroylsilanes as readily available reagents, that cleanly rearrange upon visible light irradiation to the corresponding silyloxycarbenes which in turn insert into the indole N&#8722;H bond to give stable silyl protected hemiaminals.







Abstract
A method for the selective tryptophan modification and labelling of tryptophan&#8208;containing peptides is described. Photoirradiation of acylsilanes generates reactive siloxycarbenes which undergo H&#8722;N&#8208;insertion into the indole moiety of tryptophan to give stable silyl protected hemiaminals. This method is successfully applied to chemically modify various tryptophan containing oligopeptides. The method enables the selective introduction of alkynes to peptides that are eligible for further alkyne&#8208;azide click chemistry. In addition, the dansyl fluorophore can be conjugated to a peptide using this approach.

         <title>Primary Sulfonamide Functionalization via Sulfonyl Pyrroles: Seeing the N&#8722;Ts Bond in a Different Light</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 62, Page 15387-15391, November 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sulfonamides are prevalent in drug molecules, however, methods for functionalizing sulfonamides via S&#8722;N bond cleavage are scarce. Based on a re&#8208;evaluation of N&#8722;Ts deprotection, we developed sulfonyl pyrroles as linchpins for sulfonamide functionalization. Sulfonyl pyrroles engage in various transformations that can proceed through chemical, electrochemical or photochemical pathways.







Abstract
Despite common occurrence in molecules of value, methods for transforming sulfonamides are distinctly lacking. Here we introduce easy&#8208;to&#8208;access sulfonyl pyrroles as synthetic linchpins for sulfonamide functionalization. The versatility of the sulfonyl pyrrole unit is shown by generating a variety of products through chemical, electrochemical and photochemical pathways. Preliminary results on the direct functionalization of primary sulfonamides are also provided, which may lead to new modes of activation.

The first total syntheses of the Stemona alkaloid dehydrostenine A and the structure assigned to dehydrostenine B have been completed from a simple pyrrole substrate in 10 and 11 steps, respectively. Two independent Br&#248;nsted&#8208;acid&#8208;mediated intramolecular Michael additions were exploited to construct the tetracyclic dehydrostenine core. As a result of our synthetic studies and associated analysis of the relevant literature, we propose revisions of the structures originally assigned to dehydrostenines A and B.

         <title>4&#8208;Phosphoryl Pyrazolones for Highly Selective Lithium Separation from Alkali Metal Ions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
4&#8208;phosphoryl pyrazolone as new type of selective lithium receptors were synthesized. The bi&#8208; and trinuclear lithium complexes relying on co&#8208;ligands (TBPO, TBP and TOPO) are reported for the first time. The unexpected aggregation conversion (from tri&#8208; to binuclear) in different TOPO equiv. was monitored by 31P, 1H and 7Li NMR. High extraction power and selectivity for Li+ at pH &#8764;8.2 show promising application in Li+ recognition and separation.







Abstract
Effective receptors for the separation of Li+ from a mixture with other alkali metal ions under mild conditions remains an important challenge that could benefit from new approaches. In this study, it is demonstrated that the 4&#8208;phosphoryl pyrazolones, HL2&#8208;HL4, in the presence of the typical industrial organophosphorus co&#8208;ligands tributylphosphine oxide (TBPO), tributylphosphate (TBP) and trioctylphosphine oxide (TOPO), are able to selectively recognise and extract lithium ions from aqueous solution. Structural investigations in solution as well as in the solid state reveal the existence of a series of multinuclear Li+ complexes that include dimers (TBPO, TBP) as well as rarely observed trimers (TOPO) and represent the first clear evidence for the synergistic role of the co&#8208;ligands in the extraction process. Our findings are supported by detailed NMR, MS and extraction studies. Liquid&#8208;liquid extraction in the presence of TOPO revealed an unprecedented high Li+ extraction efficiency (78&#8201;%) for HL4 compared to the use of the industrially employed acylpyrazolone HL1 (15&#8201;%) and benzoyl&#8208;1,1,1&#8208;trifluoroacetone (52&#8201;%) extractants. In addition, a high selectivity for Li+ over Na+, K+ and Cs+ under mild conditions (pH &#8764;8.2) confirms that HL2&#8208;HL4 represent a new class of ligands that are very effective extractants for use in lithium separation.

         <title>Weinreb Amide, Ketone and Amine as Potential and Competitive Secondary Molecular Stations for Dibenzo&#8208;24&#8208;Crown&#8208;8 in [2]Rotaxane Molecular Shuttles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This paper reports the synthesis and study of new pH&#8208;sensitive DB24C8&#8208;based [2]rotaxane molecular shuttles that contain within their axle the following four potential sites of interaction for the DB24C8: ammonium, amine, Weinreb amide and ketone. At the protonated state, the DB24C8 lied around the best ammonium site. After either deprotonation or deprotonation&#8208;then&#8208;carbamoylation of the ammonium, different localizations of the DB24C8 were noticed, depending on both the number and nature of the secondary stations and steric restriction. Unexpectedly, the results indicated that Weinreb amide was not a proper secondary molecular station for the DB24C8. Nevertheless, via its methoxy side&#8208;chain, it slowed down the shuttling of the macrocycle along the threaded axle, therefore partitioning the [2]rotaxane into two translational isomers on the NMR time scale. Regarding the ketone, it was successfully utilized as a secondary molecular station and its weak affinity for the DB24C8 was similar to that of a secondary amine.</dc:description>

         <title>Design and Control of Perylene Supramolecular Polymers through Imide Substitutions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review covers design principles to control the structure of perylene diimide (PDI) supramolecular polymers (SMPs) by modifying their imide substituents. How specific designs have been adapted and expanded is discussed, and various strategies to create future PDI motifs for highly controlled, tailored SMPs are highlighted. A focus is put on thermodynamic and kinetic control over 1) morphology, 2) H&#8208; or J&#8208;aggregation, and 3) mechanisms of growth.







Abstract
The number and type of new supramolecular polymer (SMP) systems have increased rapidly in recent years. Some of the key challenges faced for these novel systems include gaining full control over the mode of self&#8208;assembly, the creation of novel architectures and exploring functionality. Here, we provide a critical overview of approaches related to perylene&#8208;based SMPs and discuss progress to exert control over these potentially important SMPs through chemical modification of the imide substituents. Imide substitutions affect self&#8208;assembly behaviour orthogonally to the intrinsic optoelectronic properties of the perylene core, making for a valuable approach to tune SMP properties. Several recent approaches are therefore highlighted, with a focus on controlling 1) morphology, 2) H&#8208; or J&#8208; aggregation, and 3) mechanism of growth and degree of aggregation using thermodynamic and kinetic control. Areas of potential future exploration and application of these functional SMPs are also explored.

         <title>In Situ Observation of Ferroelastic Domain and Phase Transition in a Three&#8208;Dimensional Molecular Crystal</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The in situ observation of ferroelastic domain processing by the thermal and stress in hybrid molecular crystal and the compound shows four dielectric phase transitions caused by the order&#8208;disorder transformation of the (MedabcoF)2+ cations and the Rb8(BF4)124&#8208; framework.







Abstract
Massive efforts have been devoted to designing molecular ferroic materials by molecular modification. For molecular ferroelastic, previous work is focused on the temperature&#8208;dependent ferroelastic domains, however, few are related to controlling the ferroelastic domain by the stress. Inspired by the &#8220;quasi&#8208;spherical theory&#8221; and fluorination effect, we designed a more flexible (MedabcoF)2+ (MedabcoF=1&#8208;fluoro&#8208;4&#8208;methyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;diazoniabicyclo[2.2.2]octane) cation by introducing a methyl group and a fluorine atom at the two symmetrical ends of the Dabco (1,4&#8208;diazoniabicyclo[2.2.2]octane) and synthesized a hybrid 3D perovskite (MedabcoF)Rb(BF4)3 (1) which displays three reversible phase transitions accompanying dual ferroelastic behavior. Besides, it not only exhibits ferroelastic domains switching by the thermal stimulation, and the sensitive reaction of in situ domains under the stress of it is also realized. This work not only achieves a force&#8208;controlled ferroelastic domain but develops a more profound comprehension of the relationship between the thermal motion behavior of guest cations and the intriguing properties of materials.

         <title>Reactivity of the Bicyclic Amido&#8208;Substituted Silicon(I) Ring Compound Si4{N(SiMe3)Mes}4 with FLP&#8208;Type Character</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An amido&#8208;substituted bicyclic silicon(I) ring compound 2 Si4{N(SiMe3)Mes}4 with FLP&#8208;type character forms adducts with the carbene NHC
 and with AlBr3. The NHC adduct (3) further coordinates to BH3. Compound 2 displays a very weak Lewis acidic and a strong Lewis basic site. This is confirmed by reaction with Brookharts acid to yield 7. With diphenylacetylene at 111&#8201;&#176;C, formal fragmentation into a silylene and a trisilacyclopropenylidene occurs. Both are trapped with the alkyne to afford 8 and 9.







Abstract
The bicyclic amido&#8208;substituted silicon(I) ring compound Si4{N(SiMe3)Mes}4 2 (Mes=Mesityl=2,4,6&#8208;Me3C6H2) features enhanced zwitterionic character and different reactivity from the analogous compound Si4{N(SiMe3)Dipp}4 1 (Dipp=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3) due to the smaller mesityl substituents. In a reaction with the N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene NHC
 (1,3,4,5&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene), we observe adduct formation to give Si4{N(SiMe3)Mes}4&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;NHC
 (3). This adduct reacts further with the Lewis acid BH3 to yield the Lewis acid&#8211;base complex Si4{N(SiMe3)Mes}4&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;NHC
&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;BH3 (4). Coordination of AlBr3 to 2 leads to the adduct 5. Calculated proton affinities and fluoride ion affinities reveal highly Lewis basic and very weak Lewis acidic character of the low&#8208;valent silicon atoms in 1 and 2. This is confirmed by protonation of 1 and 2 with Brookharts acid yielding 6 and 7. Reaction with diphenylacetylene only occurs at 111&#8201;&#176;C with 2 in toluene and is accompanied by fragmentation of 2 to afford the silacyclopropene 8 and the trisilanorbornadiene species 9.

         <title>Catalytic Atroposelective C7 Functionalisation of Indolines and Indoles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first enantioselective synthesis of C7&#8208;indolino&#8208; and C7&#8208;indolo&#8208;biaryl atropisomers by means of C&#8722;H functionalisation catalysed by our chiral rhodium complex (RhJasCp) is reported. The reaction works for a wide range of substrates and gives excellent yields (up to 92&#8201;%) and very good level of enantioselectivity (up to 90&#8201;% ee). Furthermore, this transformation tolerates a variety of functional groups in both indoles and indolines.







Abstract
Axially chiral atropisomeric compounds are widely applied in asymmetric catalysis and medicinal chemistry. In particular, axially chiral indole&#8208; and indoline&#8208;based frameworks have been recognised as important heterobiaryl classes because they are the core units of bioactive natural alkaloids, chiral ligands and bioactive compounds. Among them, the synthesis of C7&#8208;substituted indole biaryls and the analogous indoline derivatives is particularly challenging, and methods for their efficient synthesis are in high demand. Transition&#8208;metal catalysis is considered one of the most efficient methods to construct atropisomers. Here, we report the enantioselective synthesis of C7&#8208;indolino&#8208; and C7&#8208;indolo biaryl atropisomers by means of C&#8722;H functionalisation catalysed by chiral RhJasCp complexes.

         <title>Structure and Biosynthesis of Myxofacyclines: Unique Myxobacterial Polyketides Featuring Varing and Rare Heterocycles[]**

Discovering the natural route to &#8220;synthetic&#8221; heterocycles: Myxofacyclines are natural products isolated from myxobacteria. Myxofacyclines A&#8211;D display an isoxazole substructure, myxofacyclines E and F contain 4&#8208;pyrimidinole, and myxofacycline G features another rare 1,2&#8208;dihydropyrol&#8208;3&#8208;one moiety. The isoxazole, 4&#8208;pyrimidinole or 1,2&#8208;dihydropyrrol&#8208;3&#8208;one heterocycle in the myxofacyclines and the underlying biosynthesis are rarely described in natural products. Isolation, structure elucidation, mutagenesis of the producer strain and heterologous expression of the identified biosynthetic genes are presented.







Abstract
A metabolome&#8208;guided screening approach in the novel myxobacterium Corallococcus sp. MCy9072 resulted in the isolation of the unprecedented natural product myxofacycline A, which features a rare isoxazole substructure. Identification and genomic investigation of additional producers alongside targeted gene inactivation experiments and heterologous expression of the corresponding biosynthetic gene cluster in the host Myxococcus xanthus DK1622 confirmed a noncanonical megaenzyme complex as the biosynthetic origin of myxofacycline A. Induced expression of the respective genes led to significantly increased production titers enabling the identification of six further members of the myxofacycline natural product family. Whereas myxofacyclines A&#8211;D display an isoxazole substructure, intriguingly myxofacyclines E and F were found to contain 4&#8208;pyrimidinole, a heterocycle unprecedented in natural products. Lastly, myxofacycline G features another rare 1,2&#8208;dihydropyrol&#8208;3&#8208;one moiety. In addition to a full structure elucidation, we report the underlying biosynthetic machinery and present a rationale for the formation of all myxofacyclines. Unexpectedly, an extraordinary polyketide synthase&#8208;nonribosomal peptide synthetase hybrid was found to produce all three types of heterocycle in these natural products.

Inner catalysis: Hydrogen&#8208;bond catalysis is implanted into polyoxometalates (POMs) through the insertion of urea into the framework. A likely combination of electron&#8208;withdrawing effects and double activation through the metal&#8208;oxo surface enables urea catalysis in POMs. The organopolyoxometalate catalysts can be recycled and reused several times. Modelling of the urea conformation when grafted to the vanadium crown, and NMR are used to investigate this new POM property.







Abstract
Several urea&#8208;inserted organo&#8208;polyoxometalates (POMs) derived from polyoxotungstovanadate [P2V3W15O61]9&#8722; were prepared. The insertion of the carbonyl into the polyoxometallic framework activates the urea toward Hydrogen&#8208;bond catalysis. This was shown on the Friedel&#8208;Crafts arylation of trans&#8208;&#946;&#8208;nitrostyrene. Modelling shows that the most stable form of the organo&#8208;POMs features a cis&#8208;trans arrangement of the two N&#8722;H bonds, but that the likely catalytically active trans&#8208;trans form is accessible at room temperature. Finally, it is possible that the oxo substituents next to the vanadium atoms may help the approach of the nucleophile via H&#8208;bonding.

         <title>Synthesis of a Negative Photochrome with High Switching Quantum Yields and Capable of Singlet&#8208;Oxygen Production and Storage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dimethyldihydropyrene photochromic unit bearing electron&#8208;donor and &#8208;acceptor substituents has been synthetized and investigated by spectroscopy, electrochemistry and theoretical calculations (spin&#8208;flip TD&#8208;DFT). This system can be reversibly isomerized with very good quantum yields to its corresponding cyclophanediene form when irradiated by red light under inert atmosphere and is able to generate two endoperoxide isomers upon illumination under air.

A dimethyldihydropyrene (DHP) photochromic unit has been functionalized by donor (triphenylamine group) and acceptor (methylpyridinium) substituents. This compound was characterized by NMR, absorption and emission spectroscopies as well as cyclic voltammetry, and its properties were rationalized by theoretical calculations. The incorporation of both electron&#8208;donor and &#8208;withdrawing groups at the photochromic center allows i) an efficient photo&#8208;isomerization of the system when illuminated at low energy (quantum yield: &#934;c&#8208;o=13.3&#8201;% at &#955;ex=660&#8197;nm), ii) the reversible and quantitative formation of two endoperoxyde isomers when illuminated under aerobic conditions at room temperature, and iii) the storage and production of singlet oxygen. The photo&#8208;isomerization mechanism was also investigated by spin&#8208;flip TD&#8208;DFT (SF&#8208;TD&#8208;DFT) calculations.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A dimethyldihydropyrene photochromic unit&lt;/b&gt; bearing electron-donor and -acceptor substituents has been synthetized and investigated by spectroscopy, electrochemistry and theoretical calculations (spin-flip TD-DFT). This system can be reversibly isomerized with very good quantum yields to its corresponding cyclophanediene form when irradiated by red light under inert atmosphere and is able to generate two endoperoxide isomers upon illumination under air. These endoperoxides can thermally release singlet oxygen.

         <title>Investigation of Bis(Perfluoro&#8208;tert&#8208;Butoxy) Halogenates(I/III)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemistry with halogens in positive oxidation states, especially the lighter halogens, is challenging due to their high oxidation potential. An ensemble of halogen +I and +III compounds with a comparatively large ligand system was synthesized and characterized with experimental and quantum&#8208;chemical methods. This study is envisioned as an example for the diverse but sometimes overlooked chemistry of group&#8197;17.







Abstract
A systematic study of halogenate(I/III) anions with polyatomic ligands is presented. The bis(perfluoro&#8208;tert&#8208;butoxy) halogenates(I) [X(OC4F9)2]&#8722;, X=Cl, Br, I, of chlorine, bromine, and iodine are prepared as their tetraethylammonium salts and characterized with IR, Raman, and NMR spectroscopic methods, as well as single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses. Spectroscopical data are supported by quantum&#8208;chemical calculations. Additionally, the bonding situation of the species in question are analyzed and discussed. Furthermore, the oxidation to the corresponding halogenate(III) derivatives was studied. For [Br(OC4F9)2]&#8722;, oxidation with elemental fluorine gave [BrF2(OC4F9)2]&#8722;. Iodide was directly oxidized by ClOC4F9 to the IIII species [I(OC4F9)4]&#8722;, which is a surprisingly inert anion that might be used as a weakly coordinating anion (WCA) in the future. For [Cl(OC4F9)2]&#8722;, the decomposition products of the synthetic approaches towards a chlorine(III) system were analyzed.

         <title>A Novel Route for the Easy Production of Thermochromic VO2 Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
M1&#8208;VO2 nanoparticles with better thermochromic properties than commercial ones are fabricated by a simple, dry, fast, clean and safe method, compatible with VO2 doping, consisting of thermal treatments of V nanoparticles by fast heating and (a) keeping 700&#8201;&#176;C for about 10&#8197;minutes and slow cooling (one cycle); or (b) 625&#8201;&#176;C for 5&#8197;minutes and fast cooling (two cycles).







Abstract
In this work, a simple, fast and dry method for the fabrication of a thermochromic product with a high load of VO2(M1) consisting of the controlled heat treatment of pure vanadium nanoparticles in air is presented. After a complete design of experiments, it is concluded that the most direct way to attain the maximum transformation of V into VO2(M1) consists of one cycle with a fast heating ramp of 42&#8201;&#176;C&#8201;s&#8722;1, followed by keeping 700&#8201;&#176;C for 530&#8211;600&#8197;seconds, and a subsequent cooling at 0.05&#8201;&#176;C&#8201;s&#8722;1. Careful examination of these results lead to a second optimum, even more suitable for industrial production (quicker and less energy&#8208;intensive because of its lower temperatures and shorter times), consisting of subjecting V to two consecutive cycles of temperatures and times (625&#8201;&#176;C for 5&#8197;minutes) with similar preheating (42&#8201;&#176;C&#8201;s&#8722;1) but a much faster postcooling (&#8764; 8&#8201;&#176;C&#8201;s&#8722;1). These green reactions only use the power for heating a tube open to atmosphere and a vanadium precursor; without assistance of reactive gases or catalysts, and no special vacuum or pressure requirements. The best products present similar thermochromic properties but higher thermal stability than commercial VO2 particles. These methods can be combined with VO2 doping.

         <title>Inherent Reactivity of Spiro&#8208;Activated Electrophilic Cyclopropanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The kinetics of ring&#8208;opening reactions with thiophenolates in DMSO were monitored to assess the inherent SN2 reactivity of electrophilic cyclopropanes. Phenyl&#8208;substituted cyclopropanes reacted faster than their unsubstituted analogues. Variation in the electronic properties of substituents at the phenyl groups of the indandione&#8208;derived cyclopropanes gave rise to parabolic Hammett relationships, which revealed variable electrophile&#8208;dependent effects on the stabilization of the transition states.

         <title>Variable Luminescence and Chromaticity of Homoleptic Frameworks of the Lanthanides together with Pyridylpyrazolates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8208;based reactions of elemental lanthanides with pyridylpyrazoles result in two series of homoleptic 3D frameworks. The products exhibit versatile photoluminescence properties, the linkers being suitable sensitizers for Ln&#8208;based emission. Tuning of the luminescence chromaticity from green to yellow and red as well as towards white&#8208;light emission was achieved by co&#8208;doping the Gd&#8208;containing frameworks of both series with Eu3+ and Tb3.







Abstract
Homoleptic, 3D coordination polymers of the formula 33&#8734;[Ln(3&#8208;PyPz)3] and 3&#8734;[Ln(4&#8208;PyPz)3], (3&#8208;PyPz)&#8722;=3&#8208;(3&#8208;pyridyl)pyrazolate anion, (4&#8208;PyPz)&#8722;=3&#8208;(4&#8208;pyridyl)pyrazolate anion, both C8H6N3&#8722;, Ln=Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, were obtained as highly luminescent frameworks by reaction of the lanthanide metals (Ln) with the aromatic heterocyclic amine ligands 3&#8208;PyPzH and 4&#8208;PyPzH. The compounds form two isotypic series of 3D coordination polymers and exhibit fair thermal stability up to 360&#8201;&#176;C. The luminescence properties of all ten compounds were determined in the solid state, with an antenna effect through ligand&#8211;metal energy transfer leading to high efficiency of the luminescence displayed by good quantum yields of up to 74&#8201;%. The emission is mainly based on ion&#8208;specific lanthanide&#8208;dependent intra 4&#8201;f&#8211;4&#8201;f transitions for Tb3+: green, Dy3+: yellow, Sm3+: orange&#8208;red, Eu3+: red. For the Gd3+&#8208;containing compounds, the yellow emission of ligand triplet&#8208;based phosphorescence is observed at room temperature and 77&#8197;K. Co doping of the Gd&#8208;containing frameworks with Eu3+ and Tb3+ allow further shifting of the chromaticity towards white light emission.

&lt;sub&gt;&#8734;&lt;/sub&gt;[Ln(4-PyPz)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;], (3-PyPz)&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;=3-(3-pyridyl)pyrazolate anion, (4-PyPz)&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;=3-(4-pyridyl)pyrazolate anion, both C&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, Ln=Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, were obtained as highly luminescent frameworks by reaction of the lanthanide metals (Ln) with the aromatic heterocyclic amine ligands 3-PyPzH and 4-PyPzH. The compounds form two isotypic series of 3D coordination polymers and exhibit fair thermal stability up to 360&#8201;&#176;C. The luminescence properties of all ten compounds were determined in the solid state, with an antenna effect through ligand&#8211;metal energy transfer leading to high efficiency of the luminescence displayed by good quantum yields of up to 74&#8201;%. The emission is mainly based on ion-specific lanthanide-dependent intra 4&#8201;f&#8211;4&#8201;f transitions for Tb&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;: green, Dy&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;: yellow, Sm&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;: orange-red, Eu&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;: red. For the Gd&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;-containing compounds, the yellow emission of ligand triplet-based phosphorescence is observed at room temperature and 77&#8197;K. Co doping of the Gd-containing frameworks with Eu&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; and Tb&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; allow further shifting of the chromaticity towards white light emission.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photocatalytic Activity of Supported Metal Nanoparticles and Single Atoms</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal nanoparticles (MNPs) and single atom catalysts (SACs) can be stabilized on porous supports including metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), graphitic carbon nitride (g&#8208;C3N4) and covalent organic frameworks (COFs) to enhance photocatalytic activity for environmental remediation and clean energy production.







Abstract
Photocatalysis has been known as one of the promising technologies due to its eco&#8208;friendly nature. However, the potential application of many photocatalysts is limited owing to their large bandgaps and inefficient use of the solar spectrum. One strategy to overcome this problem is to combine the advantages of heteroatom&#8208;containing supports with active metal centers to accurately adjust the structural parameters. Metal nanoparticles (MNPs) and single atom catalysts (SACs) are excellent candidates due to their distinctive coordination environment which enhances photocatalytic activity. Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), covalent organic frameworks (COFs) and carbon nitride (g&#8208;C3N4) have shown great potential as catalyst support for SACs and MNPs. The numerous combinations of organic linkers with various heteroatoms and metal ions provide unique structural characteristics to achieve advanced materials. This review describes the recent advancement of the modified MOFs, COFs and g&#8208;C3N4 with SACs and NPs for enhanced photocatalytic applications with emphasis on environmental remediation.

         <title>Photochemical Hydrogen Evolution at Metal Centers Probed with Hydrated Aluminium Cations, Al+(H2O)n, n=1&#8211;10</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A complex sequence of events, including intersystem crossing to the triplet surface and electron transfer, is involved in photochemical hydrogen evolution in Al+(H2O)n. For two water molecules, high&#8208;level calculations reveal a scenario for atomic hydrogen formation in which the system passes through a conical intersection between the two lowest&#8208;lying triplet states, and the hydrogen atom is virtually ejected while the remaining hydrated aluminium hydroxide cation relaxes to its new equilibrium geometry.







Abstract
Hydrated aluminium cations have been investigated as a photochemical model system with up to ten water molecules by UV action spectroscopy in a Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FT&#8208;ICR) mass spectrometer. Intense photodissociation was observed starting at 4.5&#8197;eV for two to eight water molecules with loss of atomic hydrogen, molecular hydrogen and water molecules. Quantum chemical calculations for n=2 reveal that solvation shifts the intense 3s&#8211;3p excitations of Al+ into the investigated photon energy range below 5.5&#8197;eV. During the photochemical relaxation, internal conversion from S1 to T2 takes place, and photochemical hydrogen formation starts on the T2 surface, which passes through a conical intersection, changing to T1. On this triplet surface, the electron that was excited to the Al 3p orbital is transferred to a coordinated water molecule, which dissociates into a hydroxide ion and a hydrogen atom. If the system remains in the triplet state, this hydrogen radical is lost directly. If the system returns to singlet multiplicity, the reaction may be reversed, with recombination with the hydroxide moiety and electron transfer back to aluminium, resulting in water evaporation. Alternatively, the hydrogen radical can attack the intact water molecule, forming molecular hydrogen and aluminium dihydroxide. Photodissociation is observed for up to n=8. Clusters with n=9 or 10 occur exclusively as HAlOH+(H2O)n&#8208;1 and are transparent in the investigated energy range. For n=4&#8211;8, a mixture of Al+(H2O)n and HAlOH+(H2O)n&#8208;1 is present in the experiment.

         <title>Azimuthal Dipolar Rotor Arrays on Surfaces</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Arrays of molecular rotors on Ag(111) surfaces were prepared and investigated by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). The synthesis follows a modular approach by combining a molecular platform that absorbs on the surface, a phenyl group as rotary joint and pyridine or pyridazine as molecular dipoles. The molecules sublime without decomposition and form well&#8208;ordered monolayers on Ag(111) surfaces. There is strong intermolecular interaction of the dipoles, which leads to pairwise head&#8208;to&#8208;tail orientations. Rotation was induced by the STM tip.







Abstract
A set of dipolar molecular rotor compounds was designed, synthesized and adsorbed as self&#8208;assembled 2D arrays on Ag(111) surfaces. The title molecules are constructed from three building blocks: (a) 4,8,12&#8208;trioxatriangulene (TOTA) platforms that are known to physisorb on metal surfaces such as Au(111) and Ag(111), (b) phenyl groups attached to the central carbon atom that function as pivot joints to reduce the barrier to rotation, (c) pyridine and pyridazine units as small dipolar units on top. Theoretical calculations and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) investigations hint at the fact that the dipoles of neighboring rotors interact through space through pairs of energetically favorable head&#8208;to&#8208;tail arrangements.

         <title>Manipulation of Organic Afterglow by Thermodynamic and Kinetic Control</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intriguing transformation: Through thermodynamic and kinetic control, dopant&#8208;matrix afterglow materials with different aggregation states and diverse afterglow properties can be obtained. The conversion from metastable aggregation state to thermodynamic state, triggered by thermal and solvent annealing, can lead to the emergence of intriguing afterglow transformation. The thermodynamically unfavorable reversible afterglow transformation can be achieved by coupling the afterglow system to mechanical forces.







Abstract
The fabrication of room&#8208;temperature organic phosphorescence and afterglow materials, as well as the transformation of their photophysical properties, has emerged as an important topic in the research field of luminescent materials. Here, we report the establishment of energy landscapes in dopant&#8208;matrix organic afterglow systems where the aggregation states of luminescent dopants can be controlled by doping concentrations in the matrices and the methods of preparing the materials. Through manipulation by thermodynamic and kinetic control, dopant&#8208;matrix afterglow materials with different aggregation states and diverse afterglow properties can be obtained. The conversion from metastable aggregation state to thermodynamic stable aggregation state of the dopant&#8208;matrix afterglow materials to leads to the emergence of intriguing afterglow transformation behavior triggered by thermal and solvent annealing. The thermodynamically unfavorable reversible afterglow transformation process can also be achieved by coupling the dopant&#8208;matrix afterglow system to mechanical forces.

         <title>The Chemical Bond: When Atom Size instead of Electronegativity Difference Determines Trend in Bond Strength</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atom size, not electronegativity difference, determines C&#8722;X bond strength, which weakens from X=F to I. In their Communication (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202103544), M. Bickelhaupt et&#8197;al. reveal that, as the atom size increases, it is the increase in steric Pauli repulsion that weakens the C&#8722;X bond, and not the weakening of the orbital interaction (which, in fact, strengthens it!), as is traditionally considered in the electronegativity model. With state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art DFT calculations, they provide compelling evidence to challenge the electronegativity model.

         <title>Difluorocarbene&#8208;Induced Ring&#8208;Opening Difluoromethylation&#8208;Halogenation of Cyclic (Thio)Ethers with TMSCF2X (X=Br, Cl)**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In&#8208;situ protonation of difluromethylene oxonium or sulfonium ylides (generated from diflurorocarbene and cyclic (thio)ethers) constitutes the formal activation of C&#8722;O/S bond of (thio)ethers with difluormethyl cation, thus facilitating the ring&#8208;opening difluoromethylation&#8208;halogenation of cyclic (thio)ethers. (TMS=trimethylsilyl).







Abstract
The ring&#8208;opening difluoromethylation&#8208;halogenation of cyclic (thio)ethers is reported through a simple strategy relying on carbon&#8208;chalcogen bond activation with difluorocarbene. The reaction proceeds through in&#8197;situ protonation of the previously little&#8208;known difluoromethylene oxonium or sulfonium ylide intermediate followed by ring&#8208;opening with halide ion to afford halogenated acyclic difluoromethyl (thio)ethers that can then be employed for further elaboration. TMSCF2X (X=Br, Cl) are unique reagents to achieve this synthetic purpose, which serve as both the difluorocarbene source and the halide ion source.

         <title>A New Nonlinear Optical Material with N(CN)2&#8722; Anion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel second&#8208;order nonlinear optical material Y[N(CN)2]4[NH(C2H5)3]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;3H2O with anionic group N(CN)2&#8722; is not only strongly NLO&#8208;active at 1064&#8197;nm with a response of about 2.8&#215;KH2PO4, but also is UV transparent down to 250&#8197;nm.







Abstract
Discovering new functional genes and developing high&#8208;performance materials are the goals being pursued by scientists. In this work, we successfully obtained a second&#8208;order nonlinear optical (NLO) material via the aqueous solution method, Y[N(CN)2]4[NH(C2H5)3]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;3H2O, which is the first NLO material with the anionic group N(CN)2&#8722;. Remarkably, this material is not only strongly NLO&#8208;active at 1064&#8197;nm with a response of about 2.8 &#215; KH2PO4, but also possesses a short UV absorption edge of 250&#8197;nm. In&#8208;depth first&#8208;principles calculations illustrate well that the optical properties are mainly from the strong interaction of N, C and Y atoms. This result indicates that the N(CN)2&#8722; anion may be a new NLO functional gene. This work enriches the diversity of NLO functional genes and materials.

         <title>Lanthanide Identity Governs Guest&#8208;Induced Dimerization in LnIII[15&#8208;MC
N(L&#8208;pheHA)&#8208;5])3+ Metallacrowns</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The formation of metallacrown compartments in neutral aqueous solution can be templated by an anionic guest, for example, muconate. As demonstrated by calorimetric and NMR techniques, metallacrowns containing larger or smaller central lanthanides only form monomeric host&#8208;guest complexes, whereas intermediate lanthanides uniquely form dimeric host2&#8208;guest compartments.







Abstract
Series of lanthanide&#8208;containing metallic coordination complexes are frequently presented as structurally analogous, due to the similar chemical and coordinative properties of the lanthanides. In the case of chiral (LnIII[15&#8208;MC
N(L&#8208;pheHA)&#8208;5])3+ metallacrowns (MCs), which are well established supramolecular hosts, the formation of dimers templated by a dicarboxylate guest (muconate) in solution of neutral pH is herein shown to have a unique dependence on the identity of the MC's central lanthanide. Calorimetric data and nuclear magnetic resonance diffusion studies demonstrate that MCs containing larger or smaller lanthanides as the central metal only form monomeric host&#8208;guest complexes whereas analogues with intermediate lanthanides (for example, Eu, Gd, Dy) participate in formation of dimeric host&#8208;guest&#8208;host compartments. The driving force for the dimerization event across the series is thought to be a competition between formation of highly stable MCs (larger lanthanides) and optimally linked bridging guests (smaller lanthanides).

         <dc:description>
The strength of the antiaromaticity of the title compounds is represented by the power of a phoenix. The phoenix, deprived of its vitality by the arrow of nitrogen, leaps into the flames of thiophene and is reborn strong again. This is a metaphor for the fact that the antiaromaticity of the 8&#960;&#8208;electron system pentalene is substantially impaired by nitrogen doping, but is restored by the condensation of thiophene rings. More information can be found in the Full Paper by J. Usuba and A. Fukazawa (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202103122).

         <title>Jahn&#8208;Teller Effects in a Vanadate&#8208;Stabilized Manganese&#8208;Oxo Cubane Water Oxidation Catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Jahn&#8208;Teller effects in the manganese&#8208;oxo vanadate catalyst [(Mn4O4)(V4O13)(OAc)3]n&#8722; and its activated form [(Mn4O4)(V4O13)(OAc)2(H2)(OH)]n&#8722; lead to a many local minima for different oxidation states and enhance the catalyst's reactivity.







Abstract
Heuristic rules that allow identifying the preferred mixed&#8208;valence isomers and Jahn&#8208;Teller axis arrangements in the water oxidation catalyst [(Mn4O4)(V4O13)(OAc)3]n&#8722; and its activated form [(Mn4O4)(V4O13)(OAc)2(H2O)(OH)]n&#8722; are derived. These rules are based on computing all combinatorially possible mixed&#8208;valence isomers and Jahn&#8208;Teller axis arrangements of the MnIII atoms, and associate energetic costs with some structural features, like crossings of multiple Jahn&#8208;Teller axes, the location of these axes, or the involved ligands. It is found that the different oxidation states localize on different Mn centers, giving rise to clear Jahn&#8208;Teller distortions, unlike in previous crystallographic findings where an apparent valence delocalization was found. The low barriers that connect different Jahn&#8208;Teller axis arrangements suggest that the system quickly interconverts between them, leading to the observation of averaged bond lengths in the crystal structure. We conclude that the combination of cubane&#8208;vanadate bonds that are chemically inert, cubane&#8208;acetate/water bonds that can be activated through a Jahn&#8208;Teller axis, and low activation barriers for intramolecular rearrangement of the Jahn&#8208;Teller axes plays an essential role in the reactivity of this and probably related compounds.

         <title>Total Syntheses of Conjugation&#8208;Ready Repeating Units of Acinetobacter baumannii AB5075 for Glycoconjugate Vaccine Development</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using efficient and stereoselective glycosylations and a double&#8208;serial inversion strategy, the repeating unit of A. baumannii AB5075 as well as two analogues containing a challenging (S)&#8208;3&#8208;hydroxybutanoyl chain were synthesized. All of the oligosaccharides bear an amino group that allows for the covalent attachment to glycan microarrays and carrier proteins. These densely functionalized aminoglycoside trisaccharides are the basis for the development of novel glycoconjugate vaccines against A. baumannii.







Abstract
Acinetobacter baumannii is an opportunistic pathogen that causes serious nosocomial infections. One of the multidrug&#8208;resistant strains, AB5075, can result in bacteremia, pneumonia and wound infections associated with high morbidity and mortality. The structurally unique glycans on the surface of these bacteria are attractive targets for the development of glycoconjugate vaccines. Here, we report the first total synthesis of the densely functionalized trisaccharide repeating unit of A. baumannii AB5075 as well as two analogues. The construction of 1,2&#8208;cis linkages between the rare sugars relies on a double&#8208;serial inversion strategy. The judicious selection of building blocks and reaction conditions allowed for stereoselective glycosylations, the installation of acetamido groups and the (S)&#8208;3&#8208;hydroxybutanoyl chain.

         <title>Cyclodimers and Cyclotrimers of 2,3&#8201;&#8208;Bisalkynylated Anthracenes, Phenazines and Diazatetracenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Upwardly mobile: Glaser&#8208;Hay coupling of ortho&#8208;bisethynylated (aza)acenes furnishes Eglinton&#8208;Gailbrath&#8208;type cyclodimers and cyclotrimers. Although conjugation between the chromophores is poor through the diyne bridges, as evidenced by UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy, the azatetracene&#8208;based trimer exhibits electron mobilities one order of magnitude higher than its dimeric congener.







Abstract
The synthesis of novel (N&#8722;)acene&#8208;based cyclooligomers is reported. Glaser&#8208;Hay coupling of the bisethynylated monomers results in cyclodimers and cyclotrimers that are separable by column and gel&#8208;permeation chromatographies. For the diazatetracene, the use of sec&#8208;butyl&#8208;silylethynyl groups is necessary to achieve solubility. Diazatetracene&#8208;based cyclodimers and cyclotrimers were used as semiconductors in thin&#8208;film transistors. Although their optoelectronic properties are quite similar, their electron mobilities in proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept thin&#8208;film transistors differ by an order of magnitude.

         <title>Explaining the Advantageous Impact of Tertiary versus Secondary Nitrogen Center on the Activity of PNP&#8208;Pincer Co(I)&#8208;Complexes for Catalytic Hydrogenation of CO2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Secondary PNP&#8208;pincer complexes are found to outperform tertiary analogue in various reactions as the former one exhibits metal&#8208;ligand cooperativity (MLC). But in a recent experiment of CO2 reduction reaction in alkaline medium, the tertiary complex has shown a much higher turnover number than the secondary complex and the underline reason is assumed to deteriorate effects of MLC on the secondary complex. So, here detailed density functional theory based kinetic calculations have been carried out explaining the actual reason for this anomaly.







Abstract
Pincer ligated coordination complexes of base metals have shown remarkable catalytic activity for hydrogenation/dehydrogenation of CO2. The recently reported MeN[CH2CH2(iPr2)]2Co(I)PNP&#8208;pincer complex was shown to exhibit substantially higher catalytic activity in comparison to the corresponding catalyst, HN[CH2CH2(iPr2)]2Co(I)PNP, bearing a secondary nitrogen center on the pincer ligand. Here, we computationally investigate the mechanisms for hydrogenation of CO2 to formate catalyzed by these two Co&#8208;PNP complexes to explain how such a small structural difference could have a sizable impact on their catalytic activity. Plausible hydrogenation routes were examined in details and our findings provide solid support for the experimental observations. Our results reveal that such trends in catalytic activity could be explained from the lower activation barrier for the hydride transfer step upon changing the pincer nitrogen center from secondary to tertiary.

         <title>Temperature&#8208;Controlled Electrospray Ionization: Recent Progress and Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The developments in the area of temperature&#8208;controlled electrospray ionization mass spectrometry are reviewed and compared to other biophysical methods for characterizing folding and interactions. The designs of several TC&#8208;ESI sources are discussed, as well as selected applications.







Abstract
Native electrospray ionization (ESI) and nanoelectrospray ionization (nESI) allow researchers to analyze intact biomolecules and their complexes by mass spectrometry (MS). The data acquired using these soft ionization techniques provide a snapshot of a given biomolecules structure in solution. Over the last thirty years, several nESI and ESI sources capable of controlling spray solution temperature have been developed. These sources can be used to elucidate the thermodynamics of a given analyte, as well as provide structural information that cannot be readily obtained by other, more commonly used techniques. This review highlights how the field of temperature&#8208;controlled mass spectrometry has developed.

These sources can be used to elucidate the thermodynamics of a given analyte, as well as provide structural information that cannot be readily obtained by other, more commonly used techniques. This review highlights how the field of temperature-controlled mass spectrometry has developed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synergy of Bi2O3 and RuO2 Nanocatalysts for Low&#8208;Overpotential and Wide pH&#8208;Window Electrochemical Ammonia Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;supporting hybrid electrocatalyst, RuO2&#8722;Bi2O3/FEG, was prepared by electrodepositing RuO2 and Bi2O3 nanoparticles onto the surface of functionalized graphite foil (FEG), which exhibits excellent performance at low overpotential towards electrochemical ammonia synthesis due to the synergistic effect between Bi2O3 and RuO2. This work highlights a new electrocatalyst design strategy that combines transition and main&#8208;group metal elements, which may provide some inspirations for designing low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;performance nitrogen reduction electrocatalysts in the future.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) under ambient conditions is still seriously impeded by the inferior NH3 yield and low Faradaic efficiency, especially at low overpotentials. Herein, we report the synthesis of nano&#8208;sized RuO2 and Bi2O3 particles grown on functionalized exfoliated graphene (FEG) through in&#8197;situ electrodeposition, denoted as RuO2&#8722;Bi2O3/FEG. The prepared self&#8208;supporting RuO2&#8722;Bi2O3/FEG hybrid with a Bi mass loading of 0.70&#8197;wt% and Ru mass loading of 0.04&#8197;wt% shows excellent NRR performance at low overpotentials in acidic, neutral and alkaline electrolytes. It achieves a large NH3 yield of 4.58&#177;0.16&#8197;&#956;gNH3&#8201;h&#8722;1&#8197;cm&#8722;2 with a high Faradaic efficiency of 14.6&#8201;% at &#8722;0.2&#8197;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode in 0.1&#8197;M Na2SO4 electrolyte. This performance benefits from the synergistic effect between Bi2O3 and RuO2 which respectively have a fairly strong interaction of Bi 6p orbitals with the N 2p band and abundant supply of *H, as well as the binder&#8208;free characteristic and the convenient electron transfer via graphene nanosheets. This work highlights a new electrocatalyst design strategy that combines transition and main&#8208;group metal elements, which may provide some inspirations for designing low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;performance NRR electrocatalysts in the future.

         <title>A Lead Mixed Halide with Three Different Coordinated Anions and Strong Second&#8208;Harmonic Generation Response</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new lead mixed halide, Cs3Pb2(CH3COO)2Br3I2, has been designed and rationally synthesized. Cs3Pb2(CH3COO)2Br3I2 featuring that three different anions (I&#8722;, Br&#8722; and O2&#8722;) simultaneously coordinate the Pb(II) atom into a severely distorted [PbBr2I2O2] polyhedron, exhibits a very strong phase&#8208;matching second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) response of 9&#215;KH2PO4 (KDP) and a large birefringence (0.27@1064&#8197;nm). Systematic theoretical calculations demonstrate that the strong SHG effect of Cs3Pb2(CH3COO)2Br3I2 mainly originates from the oriented arrangement of [Pb2Br3I2] chains.







Abstract
Nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals are widely applied in information technology, micro&#8208;manufacturing and medical treatment. Herein, a new lead mixed halide with strong second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) response, Cs3Pb2(CH3COO)2Br3I2, has been designed and rationally synthesized. Cs3Pb2(CH3COO)2Br3I2 represents the rare NLO crystal featuring that three different anions (I&#8722;, Br&#8722; and O2&#8722;) simultaneously coordinate the Pb(II) atom to form a severely distorted [PbBr2I2O2] polyhedron with a large polarizability. Remarkably, Cs3Pb2(CH3COO)2Br3I2 not only exhibits a very strong phase&#8208;matching SHG response of 9&#215;KH2PO4 (KDP), but also possesses a large birefringence (0.27@1064&#8197;nm) and high laser damage threshold (LDT). The strong SHG effect of Cs3Pb2(CH3COO)2Br3I2 mainly originates from the oriented arrangement of [Pb2Br3I2] chains. This study points out an effective strategy to develop new NLO crystals with strong SHG response.

         <title>Position Matters: Fluorescent Positional Isomers for Reliable Multichannel Encryption Devices</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multichannel device for information encryption that uses two fluorescent positional isomers of quinoxaline derivatives is reported. The asymmetry in their electron distribution results in distinguishable acid&#8208;/pH&#8208;responsive emissions that can be separately collected in different fluorescent channels. Thus, the reliability of the encryption can be improved by a minimal compositional difference and responsive mechanism on the molecular level. More information can be found in the Communication by N. Merbouh, F.&#8197;F. Loeffler, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202103441).

Synthesis analysis: A series of novel metal&#8211;organic frameworks with lanthanide double&#8208;layer&#8208;based inorganic subnetworks (KGF&#8208;3) has been synthesized assisted by machine learning. The synthetic conditions were successfully optimized by extracting the dominant factors for KGF&#8208;3 synthesis by using two machine&#8208;learning techniques; cluster analysis and decision&#8208;tree analysis. KGF&#8208;3 possesses unique hydrophilic pores, and impedance measurements demonstrated good proton conductivities at high temperature (363&#8197;K) and a relative humidity of 95&#8201;% RH.







Abstract
Novel metal&#8211;organic frameworks containing lanthanide double&#8208;layer&#8208;based secondary building units (KGF&#8208;3) were synthesized by using machine learning (ML). Isolating pure KGF&#8208;3 was challenging, and the synthesis was not reproducible because impurity phases were frequently obtained under the same synthetic conditions. Thus, dominant factors for the synthesis of KGF&#8208;3 were identified, and its synthetic conditions were optimized by using two ML techniques. Cluster analysis was used to classify the obtained powder X&#8208;ray diffractometry patterns of the products and thus automatically determine whether the experiments were successful. Decision&#8208;tree analysis was used to visualize the experimental results, after extracting factors that mainly affected the synthetic reproducibility. Water&#8208;adsorption isotherms revealed that KGF&#8208;3 possesses unique hydrophilic pores. Impedance measurements demonstrated good proton conductivities (&#963;=5.2&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 for KGF&#8208;3(Y)) at a high temperature (363&#8197;K) and relative humidity of 95&#8201;% RH.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Synthesis analysis&lt;/b&gt;: A series of novel metal&#8211;organic frameworks with lanthanide double-layer-based inorganic subnetworks (KGF-3) has been synthesized assisted by machine learning. The synthetic conditions were successfully optimized by extracting the dominant factors for KGF-3 synthesis by using two machine-learning techniques; cluster analysis and decision-tree analysis. KGF-3 possesses unique hydrophilic pores, and impedance measurements demonstrated good proton conductivities at high temperature (363&#8197;K) and a relative humidity of 95&#8201;% RH.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Novel metal&#8211;organic frameworks containing lanthanide double-layer-based secondary building units (KGF-3) were synthesized by using machine learning (ML). Isolating pure KGF-3 was challenging, and the synthesis was not reproducible because impurity phases were frequently obtained under the same synthetic conditions. Thus, dominant factors for the synthesis of KGF-3 were identified, and its synthetic conditions were optimized by using two ML techniques. Cluster analysis was used to classify the obtained powder X-ray diffractometry patterns of the products and thus automatically determine whether the experiments were successful. Decision-tree analysis was used to visualize the experimental results, after extracting factors that mainly affected the synthetic reproducibility. Water-adsorption isotherms revealed that KGF-3 possesses unique hydrophilic pores. Impedance measurements demonstrated good proton conductivities (&lt;i&gt;&#963;&lt;/i&gt;=5.2&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;4&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;S&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; for KGF-3(Y)) at a high temperature (363&#8197;K) and relative humidity of 95&#8201;% RH.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Rational design and facile synthesis of dual&#8208;state emission fluorophores: Expanding functionality for the sensitive detection of nitroaromatic compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Six novel benzimidazole&#8208;based D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A compounds  4a  &#8208;  4f  were concisely synthesized by attaching different donor/acceptor units to the skeleton of 1,3&#8208;bis(1H&#8208;benzimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)benzene on its 5&#8208;position through a ethynyl link. Due to the twisted conformation and effective conjugation structure, these dual&#8208;state emission (DSE) molecules show intense and multifarious photoluminescence, and their fluorescence quantum yields in solution and solid state can be up to 96.16% and 69.82%, respectively. Especially, for excellent photostability, obvious solvatofluorochromic and extraordinary wide range of solvent compatibility, DSE molecule  4a  is a multifunctional fluorescent probe for the visual detection of nitroaromatic compounds (NACs) with the limit of detection as low as 10  &#8722;7  M. The quenching mechanism has been proved as the results of photoinduced electron transfer and fluorescence resonance energy transfer processes. Importantly, probe  4a  can sensitively detect NACs not only in real water samples, but also on  4a  &#8208;coated strips and  4a  @PBAT thinfilms.</dc:description>

         <title>Low&#8208;Valent Titanium Species Stabilized with Aluminum/Boron Hydride Fragments</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Low&#8208;valent titanium species were prepared by reaction of [TiCp*X3] (Cp* = &#951;5&#8208;C5Me5; X = Cl, Br, Me) with LiEH  4  (E = Al, B) or BH3(thf), and their structures elucidated by experimental and theoretical methods. The treatment of trihalides [TiCp*X3] with LiAlH4  in ethereal solvents (L) leads to the hydride&#8208;bridged heterometallic complexes [{TiCp*(&#956;&#8208;H)}2{(&#956;&#8208;H)2AlX(L)}2] (L = thf, X = Cl, Br; L = OEt2, X = Cl). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations for those compounds reveal an open&#8208;shell singlet ground state with a Ti&#8211;Ti bond and can be described as titanium(II) species. The theoretical analyses also show strong interactions between the Ti&#8211;Ti bond and the empty  s  orbitals of the Al atom of the AlH2XL fragments, which behave as &#963;&#8208;accepting (Z&#8208;type) ligands. Analogous reactions of [TiCp*X3] with LiBH4&#160;(2 and 3 equiv) in tetrahydrofuran at room temperature and at 85 &#186;C lead to the titanium(III) compounds [{TiCp*(BH4)(&#956;&#8208;X)}2] (X = Cl, Br) and [{TiCp*(BH4)(&#956;&#8208;BH4)}2], respectively. The treatment of [TiCp*Me3] with 4 and 5 equiv of BH3(thf) produces the diamagnetic [{TiCp*(BH3Me)}2(&#956;&#8208;B2H6)] and paramagnetic [{TiCp*(&#956;&#8208;B2H6)}2] complexes, respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>An Alternative Route to Complex Allenes or Cyclooctatrienes via a Suzuki Cyclocarbopalladation Cascade</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The 4&#8208; exo &#8208;dig cyclocarbopalladation of vinyl bromides substituted with a triple or double bond, resulted in impressive cascade reactions leading to different compounds under Suzuki cross&#8208;coupling conditions upon a slight modification of the starting material. When the starting compound carries a triple bond, a single cascade occurs providing a structure containing an allene, a tetrasubstituted cyclopropane, and a cyclobutene with complete stereoselectivity. When the related starting material possessing a double bond is reacted under the same conditions in the presence of various vinyl boronic esters or acids, an efficient 8&#960;electrocyclization provides tricyclic systems comprised of a cyclobutene unit, as well as a cyclooctatriene. Five carbons of the latter can be selectively decorated with different substituents depending on the choice of the starting material and the boronic coupling partner.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulation of electrocatalytic activity by local microstructure: focusing on catalytic active zone</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Traditional regulation methods of active sites have been successfully optimized the performance of electrocatalysts, but seem unable to achieve further breakthrough in the catalytic activity. Unlike the conventional viewpoint of focusing on single active site, the concept of local microstructure active zone is more comprehensive and new suits of methods to regulate reaction zone for electrocatalytic reactions are developed accordingly. The local microstructure active zone refers to the zone with high catalytic activity formed by the interaction between active atoms and neighboring coordination atoms as well as the surrounding environment. Instead of the traditional single active atom site, the active zone is more suitable for the actual electrochemical reaction process. According to this concept, the activity of the electrocatalysts can be coordinated by multiple active atoms. This strategy is beneficial to understand the relationship between material, structure and catalysis, which realizes the scientific design and synthesis of high performance electrocatalysts. This review provides the research progress of this strategy in electrocatalytic reactions, with the emphasis on their important applications in oxygen evolution reaction, urea oxidation reaction and carbon dioxide reduction.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Near&#8208;Infrared&#8208;Light&#8208;Activatable Phthalocyanine Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The high penetration of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light makes it effective for use in selective reactions under light&#8208;shielded conditions, such as in sealed reactors and deep tissues. Here, we report the development of phthalocyanine catalysts directly activated by NIR light to transform small organic molecules. The desired photo&#8208;catalytic properties were achieved in the phthalocyanines by introducing the appropriate peripheral substituents and central metal. These phthalocyanine photocatalysts promote cross&#8208;dehydrogenative&#8208;coupling (CDC) reactions under irradiation with 810 nm NIR light. The choice of reaction solvent is important, and a mixture of a reaction&#8208;accelerating (pyridine) and decelerating (methanol) solvent was particularly effective. Moreover, we demonstrate photoreactions under visible&#8208;light&#8208;shielded conditions via the transmission of NIR light. A combined experimental and computational mechanistic analysis revealed that this NIR reaction does not involve a photoredox&#8208;type mechanism via electron transfer, but instead a singlet&#8208;oxygen&#8208;mediated mechanism via energy transfer.</dc:description>

         <title>Unveiling the Unique Roles of Metal Coordination and Modulator in the Polymorphism Control of Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polymorphism control of metal&#8208;organic frameworks is highly desired for elucidating structure&#8208;property relationship, but remains an empirical process and is usually done in a trial&#8208;and&#8208;error approach. Herein, we adopt the rarely touched actinide cation Th  4+  and a ditopic linker to construct a series of thorium&#8208;organic frameworks (TOFs) with a range of polymorphs. The extraordinary coordination versatility of Th  4+  cations and clusters, coupled with synthetic modulation, renders five distinct phases, wherein the highest degree of interpenetration (3&#8208;fold) and porosity (75.9%) of TOFs have been achieved. Notably, the O atom on the capping site of the nine&#8208;coordinated Th  4+  cation can function as a bridging unit to interconnect neighboring SBUs, affording topologies undocumented for other tetravalent metal containing MOFs. Furthermore, HCOOH has been demonstrated as a bridging unit of SBUs to further induce structural complexity. The resulting TOFs exhibit considerably different adsorption behaviors toward organic dyes, suggesting that TOFs represent an exceptional and promising platform for structure&#8208;property relationship study.</dc:description>

         <title>Insertion Chemistry of Lutetacyclopropene toward Unsaturated C&#8722;O/C&#8722;N Bonds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The diversified and unique reactivity of lutetacyclopropene toward ketone, aldehyde, tungsten hexacarbonyl, imine, and carbodiimide was demonstrated to give a series of novel lutetacycles, including oxalutetacyclopentenes, metallacyclic lutetoxycarbene, azalutetacyclopentene, lutetium pinacolate, as well as an acyclic complex with a diamidinate ligand. The intrinsic reactivity of lutetacyclopropene was probably caused by the strongly nucleophilic and high polarized nature of Lu&#8722;Csp2 bonds.







Abstract
Although the reaction chemistry of transition metallacyclopropenes has been well&#8208;established in the last decades, the reactivity of rare&#8208;earth metallacyclopropenes remains elusive. Herein, we report the reaction of lutetacyclopropene 1 toward a series of unsaturated molecules. The reaction of 1 with one equiv. of PhCOMe, Ar1CHO (Ar1=2,6&#8208;Me2C6H3), W(CO)6, and PhCH=NPh provided oxalutetacyclopentenes, metallacyclic lutetoxycarbene, and azalutetacyclopentene via 1,2&#8208;insertion of C=O, C&#8801;O, or C=N bonds into Lu&#8722;Csp2 bond, respectively. However, the reaction between 1 and Ar2N=C=NAr2 (Ar2=4&#8208;MeC6H4) gave an acyclic lutetium complex with a diamidinate ligand by the coupling of one molecule of 1 with two carbodiimides, irrespective of the amount of carbodiimide employed. More interestingly, when 1 was treated with two equiv. of Ar1CHO, the reductive coupling of two C=O bonds was discovered to give a lutetium pinacolate complex along with the release of tolan. Remarkably, the reactivity of 1 is significantly different from that of scandacyclopropenes; these metallacycles derived from 1 all represent the first cases in rare&#8208;earth organometallic chemistry.

         <dc:description>A series of [&#8208;2, &#8208;1, 0] charged&#8208;ligand based iridium(III) complexes of [Ir(bph)(bpy)(acac)] (  1  ), [Ir(bph)(2MeO&#8208;bpy)(acac)] (  2  ), [Ir(bph)(2CF  3  &#8208;bpy)(acac)] (  3  ), [Ir(bph)(bpy)(2  t  Bu&#8208;acac)] (  4  ) and [Ir(bph)(bpy)(CF  3  &#8208;acac)] (  5  ), which using biphenyl as dianionic ligand [&#8722;2], acetylacetone (or its derivatives) as monoanionic ligand [&#8722;1], and 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine (or its derivatives) as neutral ligand [0] were designed and synthesized. The chemical structures were well characterized. All of the ligands have simple chemical structures, thus further making the complexes have excellent thermal stability and are easy to sublimate and purify. Phosphorescent characteristics with short emission lifetime were demonstrated for these emitters. Notably, all of the complexes exhibit remarkable deep red/near infrared emission, which is quite different from the reported [&#8722;1, &#8722;1, &#8722;1] charged&#8208;ligand based iridium(III) complexes. The photophysical properties of these complexes are regularly improved by introducing electron&#8208;donating or &#8208;withdrawing groups into [&#8722;1] or [0] charged&#8208;ligand. The related organic light&#8208;emitting diodes exhibited deep red/near infrared emission with acceptable external quantum efficiency and low turn&#8208;on voltage (&lt; 2.6 V). This work provides a new idea for the construction of new type phosphorescent iridium(III) emitters with different valence states of [&#8722;2, &#8722;1, 0] charged ligands, thus offering new opportunities and challenges for their optoelectronic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Designing a Red&#8208;Emitting Viscosity&#8208;Sensitive BODIPY Fluorophore for Intracellular Viscosity Imaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Going into the red: We report a new red&#8208;emitting fluorescent viscosity probe suitable for intracellular viscosity imaging of MCF&#8208;7 breast cancer cells. This was achieved with the help of DFT calculations that allowed the viscosity sensitivity of the fluorophore to be predicted before synthesis.







Abstract
Viscosity imaging at a microscopic scale can provide important information about biosystems, including the development of serious illnesses. Microviscosity imaging is achievable with viscosity&#8208;sensitive fluorophores, the most popular of which are based on the BODIPY group. However, most of the BODIPY probes fluoresce green light, whereas the red luminescence is desired for the imaging of biological samples. Designing a new viscosity probe with suitable spectroscopic properties is a challenging task because it is difficult to preserve viscosity sensitivity after modifying the molecular structure. Here we describe how we developed a new red&#8208;emitting, viscosity&#8208;sensitive, BODIPY fluorophore BP&#8208;PH&#8208;2M&#8208;NO2 that is suitable for reliable intracellular viscosity imaging of lipid droplets in MCF&#8208;7 breast cancer cells. The design of BP&#8208;PH&#8208;2M&#8208;NO2 was aided by DFT calculations that allowed a successful prediction of the viscosity sensitivity of fluorophores before synthesis. In summary, we report a new red viscosity probe possessing monoexponential fluorescence decay that makes it attractive for lifetime&#8208;based viscosity imaging.

         <title>Synthesis of Extra&#8208;Large Pore, Large Pore and Medium Pore Zeolites Using a Small Imidazolium Cation as the Organic Structure&#8208;Directing Agent</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>One common strategy in the search for new zeolites is the use of organic structure&#8208;directing agents (OSDA). Typically, one seeks to achieve a high specificity in the structure&#8208;directing effect of the OSDA. Here we show, however, that an OSDA lacking strong specificity towards any particular zeolite may provide opportunities for discovery when other synthesis parameters are systematically screened. Thus, 1&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;  n  &#8208;propylimidazolium has allowed to crystallize the new large/medium pore zeolite HPM&#8208;16 as well as the recently reported extra&#8208;large pore  &#8208;SYT  and the medium/small pore and chiral  STW  . The sophisticated OSDA originally affording  &#8208;SYT  and our new simple OSDA have very little in common, both in terms of size, shape and flexibility, while both may still direct the synthesis of the same zeolite. In fact, molecular simulations show that our OSDA is located in three different positions of the  &#8208;SYT  structure, including the discrete 8MR where the original organic could not fit.</dc:description>

         <title>H2S Dosimetry by CuO &#8211; Towards Stable Sensors by Unraveling the Underlying Solid&#8208;State Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The precise detection of the toxic gas H  2  S requires reliable sensitivity and specificity of sensors even at minute concentrations of as low as 10 ppm, the value corresponding to typical exposure limits. CuO can be used for H  2  S dosimetry, based on the formation of conductive CuS and the concomitant significant increase in conductance. In theory, by elevated temperature the reaction is reversed and CuO is formed, ideally enabling repeated and long&#8208;term use of one sensor. Yet, the performance of CuO tends to drop upon cycling. Utilizing defined CuO nanorods we thoroughly elucidated the associated detrimental chemical changes directly on the sensors, by Raman and electron microscopy analysis of each step during sensing (CuO &#8594; CuS) and regeneration (CuS &#8594; CuO) cycles. We find the decrease in the sensing performance is mainly caused by the irreversible formation of CuSO  4  during regeneration. The findings allowed us to develop strategies to reduce CuSO  4  formation and thus to substantially maintain the sensing stability even for repeated cycles. We achieved CuO&#8208;based dosimeters possessing a response time of a few minutes only, even for 10 ppm H  2  S, and prolonged life&#8208;time.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulating Interfacial Lithium Ion by Artificial Protective Overlayers for High&#8208;Performance Lithium Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The main limitation of lithium (Li) metal anodes lies in their severe dendrite growth due to nonuniform Li ion flux and sluggish Li&#160;ion&#160;transportation at the anode surface. Fabricating artificial protective overlayer with tunable surficial properties on Li metal is a precise and effective strategy to relieve this problem. In this Concept article, we focus on the basic principles of regulating interfacial Li ion&#160;through artificial protective overlayers and summarize the material preparation as well as structural design of these overlayers. The remaining challenges and promising directions of artificial protective overlayers are then highlighted to provide clues for the practical application of Li metal anodes.</dc:description>

In this Concept article, we focus on the basic principles of regulating interfacial Li ion&#160;through artificial protective overlayers and summarize the material preparation as well as structural design of these overlayers. The remaining challenges and promising directions of artificial protective overlayers are then highlighted to provide clues for the practical application of Li metal anodes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Pd&#8208;catalyzed Heck&#8208;type Reactions of Allenes for Stereoselective Syntheses of Substituted 1,3&#8208;Dienes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A highly stereoselective Pd&#8208;catalyzed Heck&#8208;type reaction of allenes in which the stereochemistry of both olefins is set simultaneously was developed. The ligand CyJohnPhos was crucial to achieving stereoselectivity, while minimizing isomerization of the starting material via hydropalladation. The stereodetermining factors were proposed to be A1,3 strain between the catalyst and allene substituent, which influences the &#963;&#8208;&#960;&#8208;&#963; equilibrium of the coupled allene intermediate, as well as eclipsing interactions of R groups in the &#946;&#8208;hydride elimination. Good functional group tolerance and stereoselectivities for formation of the Z,E isomer were demonstrated. The methodology was further expanded to include the regioselective formation of 2,4&#8208;dienoates and 2,4&#8208;dienamides with a variety of substitution patterns, albeit in reduced stereoselectivities favoring the E,E isomer. A plausible mechanism is proposed to account for the observed selectivities and substituent effects.</dc:description>

         <title>The appeal of small molecules for practical nonlinear optics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Small organic molecules with a&#160;&#960;&#8208;conjugated system that consists of only a few double or triple bonds can have significantly smaller optical excitation energies when equipped with donor&#8208; and acceptor groups, which raises the quantum limits to the molecular polarizabilities. As a consequence, third&#8208;order nonlinear optical polarizabilities become orders of magnitude larger than those of molecules of similar size without donor&#8208;acceptor substitution. This&#160;&#160;enables strong third&#8208;order nonlinear optical effects (as high as 1000 times those of silica glass) in dense, amorphous monolithic assemblies. These properties, accompanied by the possibility of deposition from the vapor phase and of electric&#8208;field poling at higher temperatures, make the resulting materials competitive towards adding an active nonlinear optical or electro&#8208;optic functionality to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art integrated photonics platforms.</dc:description>

         <title>Carrier Protein&#8208;Free Enzymatic Biaryl Coupling in Arylomycin A2 Assembly and Structure of the Cytochrome P450 AryC</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The arylomycin antibiotics are potent inhibitors of bacterial type I signal peptidase. These lipohexapeptides contain a biaryl structural motif reminiscent of glycopeptide antibiotics. We herein describe the functional and structural evaluation of AryC, the cytochrome P450 performing biaryl coupling in biosynthetic arylomycin assembly. Unlike its enzymatic counterparts in glycopeptide biosynthesis, AryC converts free substrates without the requirement of any protein interaction partner, likely enabled by a strongly hydrophobic cavity at the surface of AryC pointing to the substrate tunnel. This activity enables chemo&#8208;enzymatic assembly of arylomycin A2 that combines the advantages of liquid&#8208; and solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis with late&#8208;stage enzymatic cross coupling. The reactivity of AryC is unprecedented in cytochrome P450&#8208;mediated biaryl construction in non&#8208;ribosomal peptides, in which peptidyl carrier protein (PCP)&#8208;tethering so far was shown crucial both in vivo and in vitro.</dc:description>

         <title>Shorter Alkyl Chains Enhance Molecular Diffusion and Electron Transfer Kinetics Between Photosensitisers and Catalysts in CO2&#8208;Reducing Photocatalytic Liposomes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent functionalisation with alkyl tails is a common method for supporting molecular catalysts and photosensitisers onto lipid bilayers, but the influence of the alkyl chain length on the photocatalytic performances of the resulting liposomes is not well understood. In this work we functionalised PEGylated DPPC liposomes (hereafter noted Cn) with a series of rhenium&#8208;based CO2&#8208;reduction catalysts [Re(4,4&#8217;&#8208;(CnH2n+1)2&#8208;bpy)(CO)3Cl] (ReCn; 4,4&#8217;&#8208;(CnH2n+1)2&#8208;bpy = 4,4&#8217;&#8208;dialkyl&#8208;2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine) and ruthenium&#8208;based photosensitisers [Ru(bpy)2(4,4&#8217;&#8208;(CnH2n+1)2&#8208;bpy)](PF6)2 (RuCn) with different alkyl chain lengths (n = 0, 9, 12, 15, 17, and 19), and performed photocatalytic CO2 reduction in the presence of sodium ascorbate. The photocatalytic performance of the Cn liposomes was found to depend on the alkyl tail length, as the turnover number for CO (TON) was inversely correlated to the alkyl chain length, with a more than fivefold higher CO production (TON = 14.5) for the C9 liposomes, compared to C19 (TON = 2.8). Based on immobilisation efficiency quantification, diffusion kinetics, and time&#8208;resolved spectroscopy, we identified the main reason for this trend: two types of membrane&#8208;bound RuCn species can be found in the membrane, either deeply buried in the bilayer and diffusing slowly, or less buried with much faster diffusion kinetics. Our data suggest that the higher photocatalytic performance of the C9 system is due to the higher fraction of the more mobile and less buried molecular species, which leads to enhanced electron transfer kinetics between RuC9 and ReC9.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The assembly of ancient informational polymers from nucleotide precursors is the central challenge of life&#8217;s origin on our planet. Among the possible solutions, dry polymerization of 3&#180;,5&#180;&#8208;cyclic guanosine monophosphate (3&#180;,5&#180;&#8208;cGMP) has been proposed as a candidate to create oligonucleotides of the length of 15&#8208;20 nucleotides. However, the reported sensitivity of the reaction to the presence of cations raised questions if this chemistry could be relevant in a geological context. The experiments in the current study show that the presence of cations is not restrictive as long as the reaction is conducted in an acidic environment, in contrast to previous reports that suggested optimal conditions at pH 9.</dc:description>

         <title>4&#8208;Iodopyrimidine labeling reveals nuclear translocation and nuclease activity for both MIF and MIF2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) and its homolog MIF2 (also known as D&#8208;dopachrome tautomerase or DDT) play key roles in cell growth and immune responses. MIF and MIF2 expression is dysregulated in cancers and neurodegenerative diseases. Accurate and convenient detection of MIF and MIF2 will facilitate research on their roles in cancer and other diseases. Herein, we report the development and application of a 4&#8208;iodopyrimidine based probe  8  for the selective labeling of MIF and MIF2. Probe  8  incorporates a fluorophore that allows  in situ  imaging of these two proteins. This enabled visualization of the translocation of MIF2 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus upon methylnitronitrosoguanidine stimulation of HeLa cells. This observation, combined with literature on nuclease activity for MIF, enabled the identification of nuclease activity for MIF2 on human genomic DNA.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Half&#8208;sandwich compounds of benzene, cyclopentadienyl, pentamethylcyclopentadienyl and indenyl were studied as a new type of aromatic &#960;&#8208;systems for interactions with halide anions. While uncoordinated benzene forms only C&#8208;H&#183;&#183;&#183;anion interactions, and hexafluorobenzene forms only anion&#8208;&#960; interactions, aromatic ligands in half&#8208;sandwich compounds can form both types of interactions, since their entire electrostatic potential surface is positive. These aromatic ligands can form stronger anion&#8208;&#960; interactions than organic aromatic molecules, as a consequence of more pronounced dispersion and induction energy components. Moreover, C&#8208;H&#183;&#183;&#183;anion interactions of aromatic ligands are stronger than anion&#8208;&#960; interactions, and significantly stronger than C&#8208;H&#183;&#183;&#183;anion interactions of benzene. Our study shows that transition metal coordination can make aromatic moieties suitable for strong interactions with anions, and gives insight into the design of new anion receptors.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multifunctional supramolecular systems are a central research topic in light&#8208;driven solar energy conversion. Here, we report a polyoxometalate (POM)&#8208;based supramolecular dyad, where two platinum&#8208;complex hydrogen evolution catalysts are covalently anchored to an Anderson polyoxomolybdate anion. Supramolecular electrostatic coupling of the system to an iridium photosensitizer enables visible light&#8208;driven hydrogen evolution. Combined theory and experiment demonstrate the multifunctionality of the POM, which acts as photosensitizer / catalyst&#8208;binding&#8208;site and facilitates light&#8208;induced charge&#8208;transfer and catalytic turnover. Chemical modification of the Pt&#8208;catalyst site leads to increased hydrogen evolution reactivity. Mechanistic studies shed light on the role of the individual components and provide a molecular understanding of the interactions which govern stability and reactivity. The system could serve as a blueprint for multifunctional polyoxometalates in energy conversion and storage.</dc:description>

         <title>In Situ Synthesis of CoCeSx Bimetallic Sulfide Nanoparticles on a Bi&#8208;Pyrene Terminated Molecular Wire Modified Graphene Surface for Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The graphene sheets were prepared using a bi&#8208;pyrene terminated molecular wire (BPMW) to avoid re&#8208;stacking of the grapheme sheets, thereby forming nanoscale spaces between sheets. The angle between the BPMW coplanar pyrene group and the phenyl group was 33.2&#176;, and the graphene layer is supported in an oblique direction. Finally, CoCeSx&#8722;SA@BPMW@RGO hybrid is synthesized and employed for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state asymmetric supercapacitor.







Abstract
The excellent electrical conductivity of graphene is due to its highly&#8208;conjugated structures. Manipulation of the electronic and mechanical properties of graphene can be achieved by controlling the destruction of its in&#8208;sheet conjugation system. Herein, we report the preparation of CoCeSx&#8722;SA@BPMW@RGO through &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions at the molecular level. In this study, sodium alginate was reacted with Co2+ and Ce3+, and the composite was loaded onto a graphene surface. The graphene sheets were prepared using a bi&#8208;pyrene terminated molecular wire (BPMW) to avoid re&#8208;stacking of the grapheme sheets, thereby forming nanoscale spaces between sheets. The angle between the BPMW coplanar pyrene group and the phenyl group was 33.2&#176;, and the graphene layer is supported in an oblique direction. Finally, a three&#8208;dimensional porous composite was obtained after annealing and vulcanization. The obtained CoCeSx&#8722;SA@BPMW@RGO exhibited excellent electrical conductivity and remarkable cycle stability. When the current density was 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, its specific capacitance was as high as 1004&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1. BPMW modifies graphene through the synergistic effect of &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interaction and special structure to obtain excellent electrochemical performance. Moreover, a solid&#8208;state asymmetric supercapacitor device was fabricated based on the synthesized CoCeSx&#8722;SA@BPMW@RGO hybrid, which exhibited a power density of 979&#8197;W&#8197;kg&#8722;1 at an energy density of 23.96&#8197;Wh&#8197;kg&#8722;1.

         <title>Tubular Structures of Calcium Carbonate: Formation, Characterization, and Implications in Natural Mineral Environments</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Prebiotic barriers? Calcium carbonate chemical gardens are self&#8208;assembled mineral membranes that form upon contact of a solid calcium salt with an alkaline carbonate&#8208;rich solution. In&#8208;situ studies on solution speciation and ex&#8208;situ membrane characterization show that the tube walls are highly crystalline materials with complex texture that impede ion exchange and prevent transmembrane electrochemical potentials from being generated. These findings have important implications for the relevance of such structures as microreactors for chemical conversions and as catalysts in prebiotic chemistry.







Abstract
Chemical gardens are self&#8208;assembled tubular precipitates formed by a combination of osmosis, buoyancy, and chemical reaction, and thought to be capable of catalyzing prebiotic condensation reactions. In many cases, the tube wall is a bilayer structure with the properties of a diaphragm and/or a membrane. The interest in silica gardens as microreactors for materials science has increased over the past decade because of their ability to create long&#8208;lasting electrochemical potential. In this study, we have grown single macroscopic tubes based on calcium carbonate and monitored their time&#8208;dependent behavior by in&#8197;situ measurements of pH, ionic concentrations inside and outside the tubular membranes, and electrochemical potential differences. Furthermore, we have characterized the composition and structure of the tubular membranes by using ex situ X&#8208;ray diffraction, infrared and Raman spectroscopy, as well as scanning electron microscopy. Based on the collected data, we propose a physicochemical mechanism for the formation and ripening of these peculiar CaCO3 structures and compare the results to those of other chemical garden systems. We find that the wall of the macroscopic calcium carbonate tubes is a bilayer of texturally distinct but compositionally similar calcite showing high crystallinity. The resulting high density of the material prevents macroscopic calcium carbonate gardens from developing significant electrochemical potential differences. In the light of these observations, possible implications in materials science and prebiotic (geo)chemistry are discussed.

In-situ studies on solution speciation and ex-situ membrane characterization show that the tube walls are highly crystalline materials with complex texture that impede ion exchange and prevent transmembrane electrochemical potentials from being generated. These findings have important implications for the relevance of such structures as microreactors for chemical conversions and as catalysts in prebiotic chemistry.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chemical gardens are self-assembled tubular precipitates formed by a combination of osmosis, buoyancy, and chemical reaction, and thought to be capable of catalyzing prebiotic condensation reactions. In many cases, the tube wall is a bilayer structure with the properties of a diaphragm and/or a membrane. The interest in silica gardens as microreactors for materials science has increased over the past decade because of their ability to create long-lasting electrochemical potential. In this study, we have grown single macroscopic tubes based on calcium carbonate and monitored their time-dependent behavior by in&#8197;situ measurements of pH, ionic concentrations inside and outside the tubular membranes, and electrochemical potential differences. Furthermore, we have characterized the composition and structure of the tubular membranes by using ex situ X-ray diffraction, infrared and Raman spectroscopy, as well as scanning electron microscopy. Based on the collected data, we propose a physicochemical mechanism for the formation and ripening of these peculiar CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; structures and compare the results to those of other chemical garden systems. We find that the wall of the macroscopic calcium carbonate tubes is a bilayer of texturally distinct but compositionally similar calcite showing high crystallinity. The resulting high density of the material prevents macroscopic calcium carbonate gardens from developing significant electrochemical potential differences. In the light of these observations, possible implications in materials science and prebiotic (geo)chemistry are discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Size&#8208;Controlled Synthesis of &#946;(1&#8594;4)&#8208;GlcNAc Oligosaccharides Using an Endo&#8208;Glycosynthase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enzymatic cascade synthesis of long&#8208;chain &#946;(1&#8594;4)&#8208;GlcNAc oligosaccharides perfectly controlled in size is reported. A hen egg&#8208;white lysozyme glycosynthase was developed to catalyze the glycosylation of &#945;&#8208;chitintriosyl fluoride. Using this glycosynthase in concert with a chitin&#8208;oligosaccharide N&#8208;deacetylase allowed controlled glycosylation of the fluoride onto oligosaccharide acceptors without competing polycondensation reaction. This enzymatic cascade enabled the preparation of the important plant elicitors chitin hexa&#8208;, hepta&#8208; and octasaccharides with very good yields.







Abstract
Chitin and peptidoglycan fragments are well recognized as pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Long&#8208;chain oligosaccharides of &#946;(1&#8594;4)&#8208;linked N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;D&#8208;glucosamine (GlcNAc) units indeed activate plants and mammals innate immune system. However, the mechanisms underlying PAMPs perception by lysine motif (LysM) domain receptors remain largely unknown because of insufficient availability of high&#8208;affinity molecular probes. Here, we report a two&#8208;enzyme cascade to synthesize long&#8208;chain &#946;(1&#8594;4)&#8208;linked GlcNAc oligomers. Expression of the D52S mutant of hen egg&#8208;white lysozyme (HEWL) in Pichia pastoris at 52&#8197;mg&#8201;L&#8722;1 provided a new glycosynthase catalyzing efficient polymerization of &#945;&#8208;chitintriosyl fluoride. Selective N&#8208;deacetylation at the non&#8208;reducing unit of the glycosyl fluoride donor by Sinorhizobium meliloti NodB chitin&#8208;N&#8208;deacetylase abolished its ability to be polymerized by the glycosynthase but not to be transferred onto an acceptor. Using NodB and D52S HEWL in a one&#8208;pot cascade reaction allowed the synthesis on a milligram scale of chitin hexa&#8208;, hepta&#8208; and octasaccharides with yields up to 65&#8201;% and a perfect control over their size.

         <title>Fast and Efficient Postsynthetic DNA Labeling in Cells by Means of Strain&#8208;Promoted Sydnone&#8208;Alkyne Cycloadditions</title>

Fast and efficient: DNA strands, modified with the novel bioorthogonal reporters sydnones, undergo fast and efficient labeling with cyclooctynes and have the potential to become essential tools for imaging DNA and possibly RNA in cells.







Abstract
Sydnones are highly stable mesoionic 1,3&#8208;dipoles that react with cyclooctynes through strain&#8208;promoted sydnone&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (SPSAC). Although sydnones have been shown to be valuable bioorthogonal chemical reporters for the labeling of proteins and complex glycans, nucleic acids have not yet been tagged by SPSAC. Evaluation of SPSAC kinetics with model substrates showed fast reactions with cyclooctyne probes (up to k=0.59&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1), and two different sydnones were effectively incorporated into both 2&#8217;&#8208;deoxyuridines at position 5, and 7&#8208;deaza&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;deoxyadenosines at position 7. These modified nucleosides were synthetically incorporated into single&#8208;stranded DNAs, which were successfully postsynthetically labeled with cyclooctyne probes both in&#8197;vitro and in cells. These results show that sydnones are versatile bioorthogonal tags and have the premise to become essential tools for tracking DNA and potentially RNA in living cells.

         <title>Metal Centers as Nucleophiles: Oxymoron of Halogen Bond&#8208;Involving Crystal Engineering</title>

Metal centers provide their filled d&#8208;orbitals for halogen bonding, and behave as nucleophilic components toward the noncovalent interaction.







Abstract
This review highlights recent studies discovering unconventional halogen bonding (HaB) that involves positively charged metal centers. These centers provide their filled d&#8208;orbitals for HaB, and thus behave as nucleophilic components toward the noncovalent interaction. This role of some electron&#8208;rich transition metal centers can be considered an oxymoron in the sense that the metal is, in most cases, formally cationic; consequently, its electron donor function is unexpected. The importance of Ha&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;d&#8208;[M] (Ha=halogen; M is Group 9 (Rh, Ir), 10 (Ni, Pd, Pt), or 11 (Cu, Au)) interactions in crystal engineering is emphasized by showing remarkable examples (reported and uncovered by our processing of the Cambridge Structural Database), where this Ha&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;d&#8208;[M] directional interaction guides the formation of solid supramolecular assemblies of different dimensionalities.

         <title>Emerging Design Principle of Near&#8208;Infrared Upconversion Sensitizer Based on Mitochondria&#8208;Targeted Organic Dye for Enhanced Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A NIR photosensitizer Cy5.5&#8208;Br was designed and synthesized based on a cyanine derivate (Cy5.5&#8208;H), which presented extraordinary super heavy atom effect (SHAE) and structure&#8208;inherent targeting (SIT) to tumors. Moreover, Cy5.5&#8208;Br has a satisfactory triplet quantum yield, an unusual long&#8208;lived triplet state and excellent photostability upon hot&#8208;band excitation, which makes it possible to realize effective PDT under a biosafety optical density.







Abstract
Upconversion luminescent (UCL) triggered photodynamic therapy (PDT) affords superior outcome for cancer treatment. However, conventional UCL materials which all work by a multiphoton absorption (MPA) process inevitably need extremely high power density far over the maximum permissible exposure (MPE) to laser. Here, a one&#8208;photon absorption molecular upconversion sensitizer Cy5.5&#8208;Br based on frequency upconversion luminescent (FUCL) is designed for PDT. The unusual super heavy atom effect (SHAE) in Cy5.5&#8208;Br strongly enhances its spin&#8208;orbit coupling (0.23&#8197;cm&#8722;1), triplet quantum yield (11.1&#8201;%) and triplet state lifetime (18.8&#8197;&#956;s) while the potential hot&#8208;band absorption of Cy5.5&#8208;Br is well maintained. Importantly, Cy5.5&#8208;Br can efficiently target the tumour site and kill cancer cells by destroying mitochondria under a biosafety MPE to 808&#8197;nm laser. The photostability and antitumor results are obviously superior to that of a Stokes process. This work provides a design criterion for FUCL dyes to realize effective PDT upon a biosafety optical density, possibly bringing more clinical benefits than conventional MPA materials.

         <title>Tunable Linear and Nonlinear Optical Properties from Room Temperature Phosphorescent Cyclic Triimidazole&#8208;Pyrene Bio&#8208;Probe</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
TT&#8208;Pyr bioprobe crystallizes in different polymorphs and solvates. Starting from solvate structures, thermal transformation to room temperature and, finally, high temperature polymorphs is accompanied by variation in the phopotophysical behavior which has been interpreted through theoretical and structural analyses. Dual fluorescence, RTP and SHG signal are observed for the non&#8208;centrosymmetric TT&#8208;Pyr(HT) polymorph.







Abstract
Organic materials with multiple emissions tunable by external stimuli represent a great challenge. TTPyr, crystallizing in different polymorphs, shows a very rich photophyisics comprising excitation&#8208;dependent fluorescence and phosphorescence at ambient conditions, and mechanochromic and thermochromic behavior. Transformation among the different species has been followed by thermal and X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses and the emissive features interpreted through structural results and DFT/TDDFT calculations. Particularly intriguing is the polymorph TTPyr(HT), serendipitously obtained at high temperature but stable also at room temperature, whose non&#8208;centrosymmetric structure guarantees an SHG efficiency 10 times higher than that of standard urea. Its crystal packing, where only the TT units are strongly rigidified by &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions while the Pyr moieties possess partial conformational freedom, is responsible for the observed dual fluorescence. The potentialities of TTPyr for bioimaging have been successfully established.

         <title>Position Matters: Fluorescent Positional Isomers for Reliable Multichannel Encryption Devices</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The asymmetry in the electron distribution of positional isomers of quinoxaline derivatives results in distinguishable acid&#8208;/pH&#8208;responsive emissions; this can function as the basis for enabling the construction of multichannel encryption devices. The reliability of encryption is improved by the minimized compositional difference and responsive mechanism on the molecular level.







Abstract
Fluorescence signals have been widely used in information encryption for a few decades, but still suffer from limited reliability. Here, reversible multichannel fluorescent devices with encrypted information were constructed, based on two fluorescent positional isomers of a diphenylquinoxaline derivative. Possessing the same core fluorescent group and acid&#8208;/pH&#8208;responsive mechanism, the two isomers showed different fluorescence colors in an acidic environment; this allowed us to realize stepwise encryption of information in orthogonal fluorescence channels. Because the protonation was reversible, the revealed information could be re&#8208;encrypted simply by heating. This approach highlights the value of positional isomers to build multichannel encryption devices, improving their reliability on the molecular level.

         <title>Fluorination Reactions at a Platinum Carbene Complex: Reaction Routes to SF3, S(=O)F and Fluorido Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Studies on the reactivity of thionyl fluoride and sulfur tetrafluoride towards the Pt(0) complex [Pt(IMes)2] led to the generation of Pt(II) SF3 and SOF complexes. The activation of SF6 at [Pt(IMes)2] gave a variety of fluorido complexes, some of which were synthesized independently by fluorination with HF or XeF2.







Abstract
The electron&#8208;rich Pt complex [Pt(IMes)2] (IMes: [1,3&#8208;bis(2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenyl)&#8208;2&#8208;imidazolinylidine]) can be used as precursor for the syntheses of a variety of fluorido ligand containing compounds. The sulfur fluoride SF4 undergoes a rapid oxidative addition at Pt0 to yield trans&#8208;[Pt(F)(SF3)(IMes)2]. A photolytic reaction of SF6 at [Pt(IMes)2] in the presence of IMes gave the fluorido complexes trans&#8208;[Pt(F)2(IMes)2] and trans&#8208;[Pt(F)(SF3)(IMes)2] along with trans&#8208;[Pt(F)(SOF)(IMes)2] and trans&#8208;[Pt(F)(IMes&#8217;)(IMes)] (IMes&#8217;: cyclometalated IMes ligand), the latter being products produced by reaction with adventitious water. trans&#8208;[Pt(F)(SOF)(IMes)2] and trans&#8208;[Pt(F)2(IMes)2] were synthesized independently by treatment of [Pt(IMes)2] with SOF2 or XeF2. A reaction of [Pt(IMes)2] with a HF source gave trans&#8208;[Pt(H)(F)(IMes)2], and an intermediate bifluorido complex trans&#8208;[Pt(H)(FHF)(IMes)2] was identified. Compound trans&#8208;[Pt(H)(F)(IMes)2] converts in the presence of CsF into trans&#8208;[Pt(F)(IMes&#8217;)(IMes)].

         <title>Easy Production of &#8220;Difficult Peptides&#8221; Using Cell&#8208;Free Protein Synthesis and a New Methionine Analogue as a Latent Peptide Cleavage Site</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Difficult peptides as well as unnatural analogues were produced by cell&#8208;free protein synthesis, applying a fusion protein strategy. A new heat&#8208;labile analogue of methionine was utilized in combination with a stable carrier to release the peptide only. No toxic chemicals, neither protected amino acids nor special equipment is required, thus disclosing a considerable alternative to solid phase peptide synthesis.







Abstract
Aliphatic &#947;&#8208;chloro&#8208;&#945;&#8208;amino acids incorporated in place of their canonical analogues through cell&#8208;free protein synthesis act as heat&#8208;labile linkers, offering a useful strategy for the straightforward production of target peptides as fusion proteins, from which the targets are readily released. Until now, the natural abundance of aliphatic amino acids in peptides has limited the scope of the method, as it leads to undesired cleavage sites in synthesized products, but here the authors report the development of a new cleavable chloro amino acid that incorporates in place of the relatively rare amino acid methionine, thus greatly expanding the scope of producible targets. This new strategy is employed for simplified peptide synthesis with a methionine&#8208;free fusion partner, allowing single&#8208;site incorporation of the cleavable linker for clean release and easy purification of the target peptide. Its utility is demonstrated through the straightforward preparation of two peptides reported to be challenging targets and not accessible through standard solid&#8208;phase chemical methodologies, as well as analogues.

Exploiting structural metamorphosis to wrap microspheres: The &#8216;wrapping&#8217; of lectin&#8208;decorated microspheres, which serve as appealing model micron&#8208;sized objects, within cross&#8208;linked polymer film is described. This approach utilizes dynamic covalent polymer chains able to undergo a structural metamorphosis, from being intramolecularly crosslinked to intermolecularly crosslinked, a process that is triggered by polymer concentration upon the particle surface. Experiments demonstrate that both complementary molecular recognition and the dynamic covalent nature of the crosslinker are required for successful &#8216;wrapping&#8217; to occur.







Abstract
There is growing interest in developing methods to &#8216;wrap&#8217; nano&#8208; and micron&#8208;sized biological objects within films that may offer protection, enhance their stability or improve performance. We describe the successful &#8216;wrapping&#8217; of lectin&#8208;decorated microspheres, which serve as appealing model micron&#8208;sized objects, within cross&#8208;linked polymer film. This approach utilizes polymer chains able to undergo a structural metamorphosis, from being intramolecularly cross&#8208;linked to intermolecularly cross&#8208;linked, a process that is triggered by polymer concentration upon the particle surface. Experiments demonstrate that both complementary molecular recognition and the dynamic covalent nature of the crosslinker are required for successful &#8216;wrapping&#8217; to occur. This work is significant as it suggests that nano&#8208; and micron&#8208;sized biological objects such as virus&#8208;like particles, bacteria or mammalian cells&#8212;all of which may benefit from additional environmental protection or stabilization in emerging applications&#8212;may also be &#8216;wrapped&#8217; by this approach.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of Primary and Secondary Aliphatic Amines via Mild and Selective sp3 C&#8722;H Imination</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
One for all: We report the sp3 C&#8722;H imination of simple alkanes and functionalized molecules, which provides primary amines on workup. Our method shows good site selectivity and functional group tolerance, which we have used for the synthesis of complex amines. We characterize a unique mechanism involving radical rebound to imine.







Abstract
The direct replacement of sp3 C&#8722;H bonds with simple amine units (&#8722;NH2) remains synthetically challenging, although primary aliphatic amines are ubiquitous in medicinal chemistry and natural product synthesis. We report a mild and selective protocol for preparing primary and secondary aliphatic amines in a single pot, based on intermolecular sp3 C&#8722;H imination. The first C&#8722;H imination of diverse alkanes, this method shows useful site&#8208;selectivity within substrates bearing multiple sp3 C&#8722;H bonds. Furthermore, this reaction tolerates polar functional groups relevant for complex molecule synthesis, highlighted in the synthesis of amine pharmaceuticals and amination of natural products. We characterize a unique C&#8722;H imination mechanism based on radical rebound to an iminyl radical, supported by kinetic isotope effects, stereoablation, resubmission, and computational modeling. This work constitutes a selective method for complex amine synthesis and a new mechanistic platform for C&#8722;H amination.

         <title>Base&#8208;Mediated Radical Borylation of Alkyl Sulfones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A practical and direct method was developed for the production of versatile alkylboronic esters via transition metal&#8208;free borylation of primary and secondary alkyl sulfones. The key to the success of the strategy is the use of bis(neopentyl glycolato) diboron (B 2 neop 2 ), with a stoichiometric amount of base as a promoter. The practicality and industrial potential of this protocol are highlighted by its wide functional group tolerance, the late&#8208;stage modification of complex compounds, no need for further transesterification, and operational simplicity. Radical clock, radical trap experiments, and EPR studies were conducted which show that the borylation process involves radical intermediates.</dc:description>

         <title>A Case Study of N&#8208;iPr vs. N&#8208;Mes substituted NHC Ligands in Nickel Chemistry: The Coordination and Cyclotrimerization of Alkynes at [Ni(NHC)2]</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A case study on the effect of the employment of two different NHC ligands in complexes [Ni(NHC)2] (NHC =iPr2ImMe&#160;1Me, Mes2Im 2) and their behavior towards alkynes is reported. The reaction of a mixture of [Ni2(iPr2ImMe)4(&#181;&#8208;(&#951;2:&#951;2)&#8208;COD)] B/ [Ni(iPr2ImMe)2(&#951;4&#8208;COD)] B&#8217; or [Ni(Mes2Im)2] 2, respectively, with alkynes afforded complexes [Ni(NHC)2(&#951;2&#8208;alkyne)] 3&#8208;18). Unusual rearrangement products 11a and 12a were identified for the complexes of the terminal alkynes HC&#8801;C(p&#8208;Tol) and HC&#8801;C(4&#8208;tBu&#8208;C6H4), 11 and 12, which were formed via addition of a C&#8211;H bond of one of the NHC N&#8208;iPr methyl groups to the C&#8801;C triple bond of the coordinated alkyne. Complex 2 catalyzes the cyclotrimerization of 2&#8208;butyne, 4&#8208;octyne, diphenylacetylene, dimethyl acetylendicarboxylate, 1&#8208;pentyne, phenylacetylene and methyl propiolate at ambient conditions, whereas 1Me is not a good catalyst. The reaction of 2 with 2&#8208;butyne was monitored in some detail which led to a mechanistic proposal for the cyclotrimerization at [Ni(NHC)2]. DFT calculations reveal that the differences between 1Me and 2 for alkyne cyclotrimerization lie in the energy profile of the initiation steps, which is very shallow for 2, and each step is associated with only a moderate energy change. The higher stability of 3 compared to 14 is attributed to a better electron transfer from the NHC to the metal to the alkyne ligand for the N&#8208;alkyl substituted NHC, to enhanced Ni&#8208;alkyne backbonding due to a smaller CNHC&#8211;Ni&#8211;CNHC bite angle, and to less steric repulsion of the smaller NHC  iPr2ImMe.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The use of electricity over traditional stoichiometric oxidants is a promising strategy for sustainable molecular assembly. Herein, we describe the rhoda&#8208;electrocatalyzed C&#8211;H activation/alkylation of several N&#8208;heteroarenes. This catalytic approach has been successfully applied to several arenes, including biologically relevant purines, diazepam, and amino acids. The versatile C&#8211;H alkylation featured water as a co&#8208;solvent and user&#8208;friendly trifluoroborates as alkylating agents. Finally, the rhodaelectrocatalysis with unsaturated organotrifluoroborates proceeded by paired electrolysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Metallodrug Profiling against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Target Proteins Identifies Highly Potent Inhibitors of the Spike/ACE2 interaction and the Papain&#8208;like Protease PLpro</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The global spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2) has called for an urgent need for dedicated antiviral therapeutics. Metal complexes are commonly underrepresented in the compound libraries that are used for screening in drug discovery campaigns, however, there is growing evidence for their role in medicinal chemistry. Based on previous results, we have selected more than 100 structurally diverse metal complexes for a profiling as inhibitors of two relevant SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 replication mechanisms, namely the interaction of the spike protein with the ACE2 receptor and the papain&#8208;like protease PL  pro  . In addition to many well&#8208;established types of mononuclear experimental metallodrugs, the pool of compounds tested was extended to approved metal&#8208;based therapeutics such as silver sulfadiazine and thiomersal, as well as polyoxometalates (POMs). Among the mononuclear metal complexes, only a small number of active inhibitors of the spike/ACE2 interaction was identified, with titanocene dichloride as the only strong inhibitor. However, among the gold and silver containing complexes many turned out to be very potent inhibitors of PL  pro  activity. Highly promising activity against both targets was noted for many POMs. Selected complexes were evaluated in antiviral SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 assays confirming activity for gold complexes with  N  &#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) or dithiocarbamato ligands, a silver NHC complex, titanocene dichloride as well as a POM. These studies might provide starting points for the design of metal&#8208;based SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 antiviral agents.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The global spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has called for an urgent need for dedicated antiviral therapeutics.

         <dc:description>Mild transition&#8208;metal catalysed cross&#8208;couplings enable direct functionalisation of biocatalytically halogenated tryptophans with alkyl iodides, representing a new alternative for late&#8208;stage derivatisations of halogenated aromatic amino acids.

In the solid state,  Dibanta  &#8208;H forms an unprecedented hydrogen&#8208;bonded cyclic tetrad, stabilized by dispersion interactions of the bulky  t  &#8208;Bu substituents, whereas a cyclic triad was in the crystal structure of  Anta  &#8208;H. These cyclic assemblies form infinite slipped stacks in the crystals. Evidence for analogous hydrogen&#8208;bonded self&#8208;assembly in solution was provided by low&#8208;temperature NMR spectroscopy and computational analyses.

         <title>Development of an Enzyme&#8208;Inhibitor Reaction Using Cellular Retinoic Acid Binding Protein II for One&#8208;Pot Megamolecule Assembly</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This paper presents an enzyme building block for the assembly of megamolecules. The system is based on the inhibition of the human&#8208;derived cellular retinoic acid binding protein II (CRABP2) domain. We synthesized a synthetic retinoid bearing an arylfluorosulfate group, which uses sulfur fluoride exchange click chemistry to covalently inhibit CRABP2. We conjugated both the inhibitor and a fluorescein tag to an oligo(ethylene glycol) backbone and measured a second&#8208;order rate constant for the protein inhibition reaction of approximately 3,600 M  &#8208;1  s  &#8208;1  . We used this new enzyme&#8208;inhibitor pair to assemble multi&#8208;protein structures in one&#8208;pot reactions using three orthogonal assembly chemistries to demonstrate exact control over the placement of protein domains within a single, homogeneous molecule. This work enables a new dimension of control over specificity, orientation, and stoichiometry of protein domains within atomically precise nanostructures.</dc:description>

         <title>Dinuclear Zinc Catalyzed Enantioselective Dearomatization [3+2] Annulation of 2&#8208;Nitrobenzofurans and 2&#8208;Nitrobenzothiophenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first application of dinuclear zinc catalyst in dearomatization reaction has been developed. Catalytic asymmetric dearomatization [3+2] annulations of 2&#8208;nitrobenzofurans or 2&#8208;nitrobenzothiophenes with CF  3  &#8208;containing  N  &#8208;unprotected isatin&#8208;derived azomethine ylides catalyzed by dinuclear zinc catalyst are realized with excellent diastereomer ratios (dr) of &gt;20:1 and enantiomeric excess (ee) of up to 99%, respectively. This protocol provides a practical, straightforward access to structurally diverse pyrrolidinyl spirooxindoles containing a 2,3&#8208;fused&#8208;dihydrobenzofuran (or dihydrobenzothiphene) moiety, and four contiguous stereocenters. This protocol can be performed on a gram scale. The absolute configuration of products is confirmed by X&#8208;ray single crystal structure analysis, and a possible mechanism is proposed.</dc:description>

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Mediated Photoreductive Cross Coupling of Carboxylic Acid Derivatives for Ketone Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A simple visible light photochemical, nickel&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of ketones from carboxylic acid&#8208;derived precursors is presented. Hantzsch&#8208;ester (HE) functions as a cheap, green and strong photoreductant to facilitate radical generation and also engages in the Ni&#8208;catalytic cycle to restore the reactive species. With this dual role, HE allows for the coupling of a large variety of radicals (1&#176;,2&#176;, benzylic, &#945;&#8208;oxy &amp; &#945;&#8208;amino) with aroyl and alkanoyl moieties, a new feature in reactions of this type. With both precursors deriving from abundant carboxylic acids, this protocol is a welcome addition to the organic chemistry toolbox. The reaction proceeds under mild conditions without the need for toxic metal reagents or bases and shows a wide scope, including pharmaceuticals and complex molecular architectures.</dc:description>

Typically, these cobalt(III) complexes are prepared in situ or employed in their neutral form, e.g. [Co(dmgH  2  )(py)Cl], even though related complex salts have been reported previously and could in principle offer improved catalytic activity as well as more efficient immobilization on solid support. Here we report an interdisciplinary investigation into complex salts [Co(dmgH)  2  (py)  2  ]  +  [Co(dmgBPh  2  )  2  Cl  2  ]  &#8208;  , TBA  +  [Co(dmgBPh  2  )  2  Cl  2  ]  &#8208;  &#160;and [Co(dmgH)  2  (py)  2  ]  +  BArF  &#8208;  . We describe their strategic syntheses from commercially available complex [Co(dmgH)  2  (py)Cl] and demonstrate that these double and single complex salts are potent catalysts for the light&#8208;driven hydrogen evolution reaction. We also show that scanning electrochemical cell microscopy can be used to deposit arrays of catalysts [Co(dmgH)  2  (py)  2  ]  +  [Co(dmgBPh  2  )  2  Cl  2  ]  &#8208;&#160;  and&#160; [Co(dmgH)  2  (py)Cl] &#160; on supported and free&#8208;standing amino&#8208;terminated&#160; ~ 1 nm thick carbon nanomembranes (CNMs). Photocatalytic H  2&#160;  evolution at such arrays was quantified with Pd microsensors using scanning electrochemical microscopy, thus providing a new approach for catalytic evaluation and opening up novel routes for the creation and analysis of &#8220;designer catalyst arrays&#8221;, nano&#8208;printed in a desired pattern on a solid support.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Off&#8208;target toxicity and insufficient hydroxyl radicals (&#183;OH) generation limit the further clinical application of nanozymes in chemodynamic therapy (CDT). Herein, we designed and constructed a microRNA&#8208;triggered nanozyme cascade platform for enhanced tumor&#8208;specific chemodynamic therapy. The nanozyme&#8208;based cascade reaction could be triggered successfully by the high expression of microRNA in cancer cells to generate more &#183;OH, thus exhibiting excellent tumor&#8208;specific therapeutic performance. Our work provides a new dimension for tumor&#8208;specific chemodynamic therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Benzoisoselenazolones via Rh(III)&#8208;Catalyzed Direct Annulative Selenation Using Elemental Selenium</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Isoselenazolone derivatives have attracted significant research interest because of their potent therapeutic activities and indispensable applications in organic synthesis. Efficient construction of functionalized isoselenazolone scaffolds is still challenging, and thus new synthetic approaches with improved operational simplicity have been of particular interest. In this manuscript, we introduce a rhodium&#8208;catalyzed direct selenium annulation using stable and tractable elemental selenium. A series of benzamides as well as acrylamides were successfully coupled with selenium under mild reaction conditions, and the obtained isoselenazolones could be pivotal synthetic precursors for several organoselenium compounds. Based on the designed control experiments and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy measurements, we propose an unprecedented selenation mechanism involving a highly electrophilic Se(IV) species as the reactive selenium donor. The reaction mechanism was further verified by a computational study.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Efficient Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence from Pyrazine&#8208;Fused Carbene Au(I) Emitters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;based thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) is conceived to inherit the advantages of both phosphorescent metal complexes and purely organic TADF compounds for high&#8208;performance electroluminescence. Herein a panel of new TADF Au(I) emitters has been designed and synthesized by using carbazole and pyrazine&#8208;fused nitrogen&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) as the donor and acceptor ligands, respectively. Single crystal X&#8208;ray structures show linear molecular shape and coplanar arrangement of the donor and acceptor with small dihedral angles of &lt;6.5  o  . The coplanar orientation and appropriate separation of the HOMO and LUMO in this type of molecules favoured the formation of charge&#8208;transfer excited state with appreciable oscillator strength. Together with a minor but essential heavy atom effect of Au ion, the complexes in doped films exhibit highly efficient (&#1060;~0.9) and short&#8208;lived (&lt; 1 &#956;s) green emissions via TADF. Computational studies on this class of emitters have been performed to decipher the key reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) pathway. In addition to a small energy splitting between the lowest singlet and triplet excited states (&#916;E  ST  ), the spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC) effect was found to be larger at a specific torsion angle between the donor and acceptor planes which favours most the RISC process. This work&#160;provides an alternative molecular design to TADF Au(I) carbene emitters for OLED application.</dc:description>

         <title>19F MRI Probes for Multimodal Imaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is one of the most powerful imaging tools today, capable of displaying superior soft&#8208;tissue contrast. This review discusses developments in the field of  19  F MRI multimodal probes in combination with optical fluorescence imaging (OFI),  1  H MRI, chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) MRI, ultrasonography (USG), X&#8208;ray computed tomography (CT), single photon emission tomography (SPECT), positron emission tomography (PET), and photoacoustic imaging (PAI). In each case, multimodal  19  F MRI probes compensate for the deficiency of individual techniques and offer improved sensitivity or accuracy of detection over unimodal counterparts. Strategies for designing  19  F MRI multimodal probes are described with respect to their structure, physicochemical properties, biocompatibility, and the quality of images.</dc:description>

The structures of  tBu&#8208;azaBDP  and  Ph&#8208;azaBDP  were incontestably confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystal analysis, and  tBu&#8208;azaBDP 2  is more twisted than  Ph&#8208;azaBDP 5. tBu&#8208;azaBDP  s have significant photo&#8208;stability and enhanced water solubility.  tBu&#8208;azaBDP  s possess excellent optical properties such as high molar extinction coefficients, broad full width half maxima, and large Stokes shifts, which can be comparable to those of the parent dye  Ph&#8208;azaBDP  . Although the low&#8208;barrier rotation of the distal &#8211;t&#8208;Bu groups in  tBu&#8208;azaBDP  s results in low quantum yield, photothermal conversion efficiency and singlet oxygen generation ability of  tBu&#8208;azaBDP  s are more effective than those of  Ph&#8208;azaBDP  , which is highly desirable for a photothermal&#8208;photodynamic therapy agent.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Mixed TMP&#8208;bases (TMP = 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidyl), such as TMPMgCl&#183;LiCl, TMP2Mg&#183;2LiCl, TMPZnCl&#183;LiCl and TMP2Zn&#183;2LiCl are outstanding reagents for the metalation of functionalized aromatics and heterocycles. In the presence of Lewis acids such as BF3&#183;OEt2  or MgCl2  , the metalation scope of such bases was dramatically increased and regioselectivity switches were achieved in the presence or absence of these Lewis acids. Furthermore, highly reactive lithium bases, such as TMPLi or Cy2NLi are also compatible with various Lewis acids such as MgCl2&#183;2LiCl, ZnCl2&#183;2LiCl or CuCN&#183;2LiCl. Performing such metalations in continuous flow using commercial setups permitted practical and convenient reaction conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Versatile para&#8208;substituted pyridine lanthanide coordination complexes allow late stage tailoring of complex function</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of cationic and neutral p&#8208;Br and p&#8208;NO2 pyridine substituted Eu(III) and Gd(III) coordination complexes serve as versatile synthetic intermediates. Nucleophilic aromatic substitution occurs readily at the para position under mild conditions, allowing &#8232;C&#8211;N and C&#8211;C bond forming reactions to take place, permitting the introduction of azide, amino and alkynyl substituents. For Eu(III) complexes, this approach allows late stage tuning of absorption and emission spectral properties, exemplified by the lowering of the energy of an LMCT transtion accompanied by a reduction in the Eu&#8208;Npy bond length. Additionally, these complexes provide direct access to the corresponding Eu(II) analogues. With the Gd(III) series, the nature of the p&#8208;substituent does not significantly change the EPR properties (linewidth, relaxation times), as required for their development as EPR spin probes that can be readily conjugated to biomolecules under mild conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Modification of Amorphous Mesoporous Zirconia Nanoparticles with Bisphosphonic Acids: A Straightforward Approach for Tailoring the Surface Properties of the Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of readily prepared bisphosphonic acids obtained through a thio&#8208;Michael addition of a wide range of commercially available thiols on tetraethyl vinylidenebisphosphonate enable the straightforward surface modification of amorphous mesoporous zirconia nanoparticles. By simple stirring of a buffered aqueous solution of the bisphosphonic acid bearing the desired side chain with the zirconia nanoparticles leads to the surface functionalization of the nanoparticles with different kinds of functional groups, charges and hydrophobic properties, with negligible release in neutral or acidic pH conditions. The modified nanoparticles were characterized by IR, XPS, &#950;&#8208;potential analysis to investigate the loading of the bisphosphonic acid, SEM to investigate the size and morphologies of the nanoparticles and  31  P and  1  H MAS NMR to investigate the coordination motif of the phosphonate units on the surface. All these analytical techniques demonstrated the strong affinity of the bisphosphonic moiety for the Zr(IV) metal centers. The functionalization with bisphosphonic acids represents a straightforward covalent approach for derivatization that is complementary to the use of typical  tris  &#8208;alkoxy&#8208;silane or trichloro&#8208;silane reagents largely employed for the functionalization of silica and metal oxide nanoparticles.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning Ruthenium Carbene Complexes for Selective P&#8211;H activation via Metal&#8208;Ligand Cooperation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of iminophosphoryl&#8208;tethered ruthenium carbene complexes for activation of secondary phosphine P&#8211;H bonds is reported. Complexes of type [(p&#8208;cymene)&#8208;RuC(SO  2  Ph)(PPh  2  NR)] (with R = SiMe  3  or 4&#8208;C  6  H  4  &#8208;NO  2  ) were found to exhibit different reactivities depending on the electronics of the applied phosphine and the substituent at the iminophosphoryl moiety. Hence, the electron&#8208;rich silyl&#8208;substituted complex undergoes cyclometallation or shift of the imine moiety after cooperative activation of the P&#8211;H bond across the M=C linkage, depending on the electronics of the applied phosphine. Deuteration experiments and computational studies proved that cyclometallation is initiated by the activation process at the M=C bond and triggered by the high electron&#8208;density at the metal in the phosphido intermediates. Consistently, replacement of the trimethylsilyl (TMS) group by the electron&#8208;withdrawing 4&#8208;nitrophenyl substituent allowed for the selective cooperative P&#8211;H activation to form stable activation products.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Relative rates for the Lewis base&#8208;catalyzed acylation of aryl&#8208;substituted 1,2&#8208;diols with anhydrides differing in size have been determined by turnover&#8208;limited competition experiments and absolute kinetics measurements. Depending on the structure of the anhydride reagent, the secondary hydroxyl group of the 1,2&#8208;diol reacts faster than the primary one. This preference towards the secondary hydroxyl group is boosted in the second acylation step from the monoesters to the diester through size and additional steric effects. In absolute terms the first acylation step is found to be up to 35 times faster than the second one for the primary alcohols due to neighboring group effects.</dc:description>

         <title>Screening of minimalist noncanonical sites in duplex DNA and RNA reveals context and motif&#8208;selective binding by fluorogenic base probes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We hypothesize that programmable hybridization to noncanonical nucleic acid motifs may be achieved by macromolecular display of binders to individual noncanonical pairs (NCPs). As each recognition element may individually have weak binding to an NCP, we developed a semi&#8208;rational approach to detect low affinity interactions between selected nitrogenous bases and noncanonical sites in duplex DNA and RNA. A set of fluorogenic probes was synthesized by coupling abiotic (triazines, pyrimidines) and native RNA bases to thiazole orange (TO) dye. This probe library was screened against duplex nucleic acid substrates bearing single abasic, single NCP and tandem NCP sites. Probe engagement with NCP sites was reported by by 100&#8208;1000X fluorescence enhancement over background. Binding is strongly context&#8208;dependent, reflective of both molecular recognition and stability: less stable motifs are more likely to bind a synthetic probe. Further, DNA and RNA substrates exhibit entirely different abasic and single NCP binding profiles. While probe binding in the abasic and single NCP screens was monotonous, much richer binding profiles were observed with the screen of tandem NCP sites in RNA, in part due to increased steric accessibility. In addition to known binding interactions between the triazine melamine (M) and T/U sites, the NCP screens identified new targeting elements for pyrimidine&#8208;rich motifs in single NCPs and 2x2 internal bulges. We anticipate that semi&#8208;rational approaches of this type will lead to programmable noncanonical hybridization strategies at the macromolecular level.</dc:description>

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Controlled Regiodivergence for Catalytic Stereoselective Semireduction of Allenamides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ligand&#8208;controlled regiodivergence has been developed for catalytic semireduction of allenamides with excellent chemo&#8208; and stereocontrol. This system also provides an example of catalytic regiodivergent semireduction of allenes for the first time. The divergence of the semireduction is enabled by ligand switch with the same palladium pre&#8208;catalyst under operationally simple and mild conditions. Monodentate ligand XPhos exclusively promotes selective 1,2&#8208;semireduction to afford allylic amides, while bidentate ligand BINAP completely switched the regioselectivity to 2,3&#8208;semireduction, producing (E)&#8208;enamide derivatives.</dc:description>

         <title>Acid&#8208;Tolerant Sulfate Tetrahedral Cages from Anion&#8208;Coordination&#8208;Driven Assembly</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular cages have been constructed by anion&#8208;coordination&#8208;driven assembly (ACDA) in recent years and shown unique host&#8208;guest interactions. However, most of the reported cages are made of phosphate ion (PO43&#8722;), while other anions have rarely been explored. Here we show for the first time that sulfate ion (SO42&#8722;) is also able to form the A4L4 tetrahedral motif with tris&#8208;bis(urea) ligands, but this is dependent on the stoichiometry of sulfate ion (in solution). Notably, the sulfate cages display enhanced resistance for both Br&#248;nsted (pH as low as 4.3 in acetone containing 15% water) and Lewis acids (metal complexes) than the corresponding phosphate cages, and thus may find applications where acidic (proton or metals) environment is required.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>During the reduction of molybdenum trioxide (MoO  3  ) to metallic molybdenum, the first reduction step yielding molybdenum dioxide as an intermediary product is of crucial importance. In this study, we examined the impact of the parameters reduction temperature, water influx, and potassium content on the hydrogen reduction of this first reaction step. Beginning from the same starting material the chemical vapor transport mechanism was utilized to yield the phase pure MoO  2  . Analyses including powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, inductively coupled plasma&#8208;mass spectrometry, scanning electron microscopy, and high performance optical microscopy were performed on the product phases. Modulations of the specific surface areas of molybdenum dioxide ranging from 2.28 to 0.41 m  2  /g were possible. Furthermore, a distinct shift from small plate&#8208;like grains to cuboid&#8208;like forms was achieved.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Functionalization of C&#8722;H bonds, ubiquitous in drugs and drug&#8208;like molecules, represents an important synthetic strategy with a potential to streamline the drug discovery process. Late&#8208;stage aromatic C&#8722;N bond forming reactions are highly desirable, but despite their significance, accessing aminated analogues through direct and selective amination of C&#8722;H bonds remains a challenging goal. The herein presented method enables the amination of a wide array of benzoic acids with high selectivity. The robustness of the system is manifested by the large number of functional groups tolerated, which allowed for the amination of a diverse array of marketed drugs and drug&#8208;like molecules. Furthermore, the introduction of a synthetic handle enabled expeditious access to targeted drug delivery conjugates, PROTACs, as well as probes for chemical biology. The rapid access to valuable analogues, combined with operational simplicity and applicability to high&#8208;throughput experimentation has the potential to aid, and considerably accelerate, drug discovery.</dc:description>

         <title>Multiple regulation effects of ammonium acetate on ZnO growth process in chemical bath deposition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemical bath deposition method has been used to synthesize a variety of ZnO morphology structures. However, the specificity and interaction of acetate and ammonium ions with ZnO crystal during the growth process remain elusive. This study contributes to understand the roles of ammonium acetate on the growth mechanism of ZnO in Zn(NO  3  )  2  &#8208;HMTA system. The growth process indicates that the nucleation experienced Zn  2+  &#8208;layered basic zinc salta(LBZs)&#8208;ZnO process, while the self&#8208;assembled unit changed from urchin&#8208;shaped, rod&#8208;shaped to a fully coupled twin&#8208;shaped structure with increasing ammonium acetate concentration. Ammonium acetate dominates the growth process by combing the ligand&#8208;ligand interaction of acetate ions binding to the same Zn&#8208;rich (0001) polar surface and ammonium ions regulating hexamethylenetetramine (HMTA) hydrolysis. Relatively regular hexagonal wurtzite structure and a dissolve&#8208;renucleation&#8208;regrowth process which retains the twin&#8208;shaped template and renucleates at the same position are observed at ~10 mM ammonium acetate. Photoelectrochemistry (PEC) measurements show that the uniform hexagonal ZnO rods (Y&#8208;10, the sample named as Y&#8208;x (x represents x mM ammonium acetate, herein, x is 10 mM)) have a maximum photocurrent density of 1.54 mA cm  &#8208;2  at 1.23 V (vs. RHE), much higher than that of the dumbbell&#8208;shaped ZnO rods (Y&#8208;50, 0.20 mA cm  &#8208;2  ) at the same voltage. These results provide a further explanation of morphology regulation mechanisms on ZnO synthesis processes and pave the road for more practical applications.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Chemical bath deposition method has been used to synthesize a variety of ZnO morphology structures. However, the specificity and interaction of acetate and ammonium ions with ZnO crystal during the growth process remain elusive. This study contributes to understand the roles of ammonium acetate on the growth mechanism of ZnO in Zn(NO  3  )  2  -HMTA system. The growth process indicates that the nucleation experienced Zn  2+  -layered basic zinc salta(LBZs)-ZnO process, while the self-assembled unit changed from urchin-shaped, rod-shaped to a fully coupled twin-shaped structure with increasing ammonium acetate concentration. Ammonium acetate dominates the growth process by combing the ligand-ligand interaction of acetate ions binding to the same Zn-rich (0001) polar surface and ammonium ions regulating hexamethylenetetramine (HMTA) hydrolysis. Relatively regular hexagonal wurtzite structure and a dissolve-renucleation-regrowth process which retains the twin-shaped template and renucleates at the same position are observed at ~10 mM ammonium acetate. Photoelectrochemistry (PEC) measurements show that the uniform hexagonal ZnO rods (Y-10, the sample named as Y-x (x represents x mM ammonium acetate, herein, x is 10 mM)) have a maximum photocurrent density of 1.54 mA cm  -2  at 1.23 V (vs. RHE), much higher than that of the dumbbell-shaped ZnO rods (Y-50, 0.20 mA cm  -2  ) at the same voltage. These results provide a further explanation of morphology regulation mechanisms on ZnO synthesis processes and pave the road for more practical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

[Cp2Ti(NPhAr)][B(C6F5)4] (Cp = &#951;5&#8208;C5H5; Ar = phenyl (1a), p&#8208;tolyl (1b),

p&#8208;anisyl (1c)) were isolated. The bonding situation was studied by

Density Functional Theory using EDA&#8208;NOCV (Energy Decomposition

Analysis with Natural Orbitals for Chemical Valence). The polar Ti&#8208;N

bond in 1a&#8208;c features an unusual inversion of &#963; and &#960; bond strengths

responsible for the balance between stability and reactivity in these

coordinatively unsaturated species. In solution, 1a&#8208;c undergo

photolytic Ti&#8208;N cleavage to release Ti(III) species and aminyl radicals

&#11825;NPhAr. Reaction of 1b with H3BNHMe2 results in fast homolytic Ti&#8208;N

cleavage to give [Cp2Ti(H3BNHMe2)][B(C6F5)4] (3). 1a&#8208;c are highly

active precatalysts in olefin hydrogenation and silanes/amines crossdehydrogenative

coupling, whilst 3 efficiently catalyzes amine&#8208;borane

dehydrogenation. The mechanism of olefin hydrogenation was

studied by DFT and the cooperative H2 activation key step was

disclosed using the Activation Strain Model (ASM).</dc:description>

         <title>In Situ Electronegativity and the Bridging&#160;of Chemical Bonding Concepts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A challenge in chemistry is the plethora of often disparate models for rationalizing the electronic structure of molecules. Chemical concepts abound, but their connections are often frail. This work describes a quantum mechanical framework&#160;that enables a combination of ideas from&#160;three approaches common for the analysis of chemical bonds: Energy Decomposition Analysis (EDA), Quantum Chemical Topology, and Molecular Orbital (MO) Theory. The glue to our theory is the electron energy density, interpretable as one&#8208;part electrons and one&#8208;part electronegativity. We present a three&#8208;dimensional analysis of the electron energy density and use it to redefine what constitutes an atom in a molecule. Definitions of atomic partial charge and electronegativity follow in a way that connects these concepts to the total energy of a molecule. Formation of polar bonds are predicted to cause inversions of electronegativity and a new perspective of bonding in diborane and guanine&#8208;cytosine base&#8208;pairing is presented. Electronegativity of atoms inside molecules is shown to be predictive of&#160;pK&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;.</dc:description>
