      <dc:description>The reactivity of a range of Keggin and Wells&#8208;Dawson type heteropolyacids (HPAs): H3PW12O40 H4SiW12O40, H3PMo12O40, K6P2W18O62, and NaH2W12O4, towards the heavily glycosylated &#945;&#8208;1&#8208;acid glycoprotein (AGP) is reported. Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS&#8208;PAGE) and high&#8208;performance anion exchange chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection (HPAEC&#8208;PAD) show that after incubation of the protein with HPAs at 80 &#176;C and pH 2.8 complete hydrolysis of terminal glycosidic bond has been achieved, resulting in the removal of sialic acids with no observed destruction of the protein core or the residual glycan chains. The 1H NMR spectroscopy confirmed that the released sialic acids preserve intact structure upon their excision from the protein, which makes the reported method suitable for the analysis of sialic acid modifications which play an important role in numerous biological processes. The presence of other sugars was not detected by 1H NMR and HPAEC&#8208;PAD, suggesting that HPAs hydrolyze only the terminal glycosidic bond in the glycoprotein, resulting in the selective release of sialic acid from AGP. The observed rate constants were in the range 6,7 x 10&#8208;2 &#8208;11,9 x 10&#8208;2 min&#8208;1 and the complete and selective excision of sialic acids could be achieved within 60 min of incubation. The Trp fluorescence and CD spectroscopy show that non&#8208;covalent interaction between HPA and protein takes place in solution which could lead to stabilization of the sialosyl cation that is formed during the glycosidic bond hydrolysis by anionic HPA cluster.</dc:description>

      <title>New&#160;Supercage Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Based on Medicine Molecule Ligands Showing&#160;Acetylene Storage and Separation</title>
      <dc:description>To develop efficient adsorbent materials for storage and separation of C2H2, an unprecedented supercage MOF, [Me2NH2]&#183;[Zn3(ALP)(TDC)2.5]&#183;3.5DMF&#183;2H2O (1) was constructed through medicine molecule allopurinol (ALP) and S&#8208;containing 2,5&#8208;Thiophenedicarboxylic acid (H2TDC). 1 contains a novel linear trinuclear cluster that is composed by ALP and carboxylates and forms a final uncommon 5&#8208;connected yfy topological framework. The framework possesses three types of interlinked cages decorated by rich functional sites, and reveals not only high adsorption capacity for C2H2 but also excellent selective separation for C2H2/CO2 and C2H2/CH4 at 298 K. Dynamic breakthrough experiments on C2H2/CO2 (1:1) mixture and C2H2/CH4 (1:1) mixture also demonstrated the potential of the material to separate C2H2 from CO2 or CH4 mixtures. Molecular simulations were also studied to identify the different CO2&#8208; and C2H2&#8208; binding sites in 1, such as carboxylate groups, S atoms and carbonyl groups.</dc:description>

      <title>New Photosensitizers Based on Heteroleptic CuI Complexes and CO2 Photocatalytic Reduction with [NiII(cyclam)]Cl2</title>
      <dc:description>
New photosensitizers based on earth&#8208;abundant CuI absorb blue light and undergo reductive quenching with an electron donor (BIH). A second electron transfer to a Nickel catalyst triggers the catalytic reduction of CO2 to CO.







Abstract
Earth&#8208;abundant metal complexes have been attracting increasing attention in the field of photo(redox)catalysis. In this work, the synthesis and full characterisation of four new heteroleptic CuI complexes are reported, which can work as photosensitizers. The complexes bear a bulky diphosphine (DPEPhos=bis[(2&#8208;diphenylphosphino)phenyl] ether) and a diimine chelating ligand based on 1&#8208;benzyl&#8208;4&#8208;(quinol&#8208;2&#8242;yl)&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazole. Their absorption has a relative maximum in the visible&#8208;light region, up to 450&#8197;nm. Thus, their use in photocatalytic systems for the reduction of CO2 with blue light in combination with the known catalyst [NiII(cyclam)]Cl2 was tested. This system produced CO as the main product through visible light (&#955;=420&#8197;nm) with a TON up to 8 after 4&#8197;hours. This value is in line with other photocatalytic systems using the same catalyst. Nevertheless, this system is entirely noble&#8208;metal free.

      <title>DNA alkylation of the RUNX&#8208;binding sequence by CBI&#8208;PI polyamide comjugates</title>
      <dc:description>Many types of molecular targeted drugs that inhibit cancer growth by acting on specific molecules have been developed. The runt&#8208;related transcription factor (RUNX) family, which induces cancer development by binding to a specific DNA sequence, has attracted attention as a new target for cancer treatment. We have developed Chb&#8208;M &#162; , which targets the RUNX&#8208;binding sequence. Chb&#8208;M &#162; was developed by conjugating pyrrole&#8211;imidazole (PI) polyamides and chlorambucil as an anticancer agent. It was recently reported that Chb&#8208;M &#162; had a remarkable anticancer effect in vivo. In this study, to explore the possibility of an alternative structure, we designed a new series of CBI&#8211;PI polyamides, in which seco&#8208;CBI was applied as a DNA&#8208;alkylating agent. We examined the characteristics of the CBI&#8211;PI polyamides targeting the RUNX&#8208;binding sequence and found that these conjugates have great potential for cancer treatment.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Many types of molecular targeted drugs that inhibit cancer growth by acting on specific molecules have been developed. The runt&#8208;related transcription factor (RUNX) family, which induces cancer development by binding to a specific DNA sequence, has attracted attention as a new target for cancer treatment. We have developed Chb&#8208;M &#162; , which targets the RUNX&#8208;binding sequence. Chb&#8208;M &#162; was developed by conjugating pyrrole&#8211;imidazole (PI) polyamides and chlorambucil as an anticancer agent. It was recently reported that Chb&#8208;M &#162; had a remarkable anticancer effect in vivo. In this study, to explore the possibility of an alternative structure, we designed a new series of CBI&#8211;PI polyamides, in which seco&#8208;CBI was applied as a DNA&#8208;alkylating agent. We examined the characteristics of the CBI&#8211;PI polyamides targeting the RUNX&#8208;binding sequence and found that these conjugates have great potential for cancer treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Selective phase transfer reagents (OxP&#8208;crowns) for chromogenic detection of nitrates especially ammonium nitrate</title>
      <dc:description>Nitrogen and phosphorus&#8208;containing ions such as ammonium, nitrates and phosphates are anthropogenic pollutants while ammonium nitrate may be diverted for nefarious purposes in improvised explosive devices. Crown ether&#8208;oxoporphyrinogen conjugates (OxP&#8208;crowns) are used to selectively detect nitrates, especially their ion pairs with K+ and NH4+, based on ion pair complexation of OxP&#8208;crowns under phase transfer conditions. The presence of phosphate and carbonate lead to deprotonation of OxP&#8208;crowns. OxP&#8208;1N18C6 is capable of extracting ion pairs with nitrate from aqueous phase leading to a selective chromogenic response. Deprotonation of the OxP moiety leads to [OxP&#8208;]&#8208;1N18C6[K+] and is promoted by crown ether selective cation binding coupled with hydration of basic oxoanions, which are constrained to remain in the aqueous phase. This work illustrates the utility of molecular design to exploit partitioning and ion hydration effects establishing selectivity of chromogenic response.</dc:description>

      <title>Trifluoromethylation of [AuF3(SIMes)]: Preparation and Characterization of [Au(CF3)xF3&#8722;x(SIMes)] (x = 1 &#8211; 3) Complexes</title>
      <dc:description>Trifluoromethylation of [AuF  3  (SIMes)] with the Ruppert&#8208;Prakash reagent TMSCF  3  in the presence of CsF yields the product series [Au(CF  3  )  x  F  3&#8211;  x  (SIMes)] (  x  = 1 &#8211; 3). The degree of trifluoro&#8208;methylation is solvent dependent and the ratio of the species can be controlled by varying the stoichiometry of the reaction, as evidenced from the  19  F NMR spectra of the corresponding reaction mixtures. The molecular structures in the solid state of  trans  &#8208;[Au(CF  3  )F  2  (SIMes)] and [Au(CF  3  )  3  (SIMes)] are presented, together with a selective route for the synthesis of the latter complex.

      <title>Electrophilicity Scale of Activated Amides: 17O NMR and 15N NMR Chemical Shifts of Acyclic Twisted Amides in N&#8211;C(O) Cross&#8208;Coupling</title>
      <dc:description>The structure and properties of amides are of tremendous interest in organic synthesis and biochemistry. Traditional amides are planar and the carbonyl group non&#8208;electrophilic due to nN &#8594; p*C=O conjugation. In this study, we report electrophilicity scale by exploiting 17O NMR and 15N NMR chemical shifts of acyclic twisted and destabilized acyclic amides that have recently received major attention as precursors in N&#8211;C(O) cross&#8208;coupling by selective oxidative addition as well as precursors in electrophilic activation of N&#8211;C(O) bonds. Most crucially, we demonstrate that acyclic twisted amides feature electrophilicity of the carbonyl group that ranges between that of acid anhydrides and acid chlorides. Furthermore, a wide range of electrophilic amides is possible with gradually varying carbonyl electrophilicity by steric and electronic tuning of amide bond properties. Overall, the study quantifies for the first time that steric and electronic destabilization of the amide bond in common acyclic amides renders the amide bond as electrophilic as acid anhydrides and chlorides. These findings should have major implications on the fundamental properties of amide bonds.</dc:description>

      <title>Modulating Magnetic and Photoluminescence Properties in 2&#8208;aminonicotinate based Bifunctional Coordination Polymers by Merging 3d&#8208;Metal Ions</title>
      <dc:description>Herein, we report the synthesis and study of bifunctional coordination polymers (CPs) with both, magnetic and photoluminescence properties derived from a heterometallic environment. As a starting point, three isostructural monometallic CPs with [M(&#956;&#8208;2ani)2]n [M(II) = Mn (1Mn), Co (3Co) and Ni (4Ni), 2ani = 2&#8208;aminonicotinate] formula, crystallize as chiral 2D&#8208;layered structures stacked by means of supramolecular interactions. These compounds show high thermal stability in solid state (above 350 &#186;C), despite of which 1Mn in aqueous solution is shown to partially transform into a novel 1D chained CP with [Mn(2ani)2(&#956;&#8208;H2O)2]n (2Mn) formula. A consistent study of the dc magnetic properties of 1Mn, 3Co and 4Ni reveal a spin&#8208;canted structure deriving from antisymmetric antiferromagnetic weak exchanges along the chiral network (as confirmed by DFT calculations) and magnetic anisotropy of the ions, in such a way that the long&#8208;range ordering is observed with variable magnitude for the spin carriers. Moreover, 3Co and 4Ni show no frequency&#8208;dependent ac susceptibility curves under zero dc field, a characteristic behaviour of a glassy state that may be partially supressed for 3Co by applying an external dc field. To overcome the long&#8208;range magnetic ordering, Co(II) ions are diluted in a diamagnetic Zn(II)&#8208;based matrix, which enables the single&#8208;molecule magnet (SMM) behaviour. Interestingly, this strategy allows obtaining a bifunctional CoxZn1&#8208;x2ani material being imbued with a strong photoluminescent emitting capacity characterized by an intense blue light followed by a green afterglow.</dc:description>

Anomeric phosphoramidites were employed to assemble oligonucleotides. According to  T  m  values and thermodynamic data duplex stability of heterochiral duplexes was similar to that of homochiral DNA but mismatch discrimination was better in heterochiral DNA. Replacement of purines by 7&#8208;deazapurines resulted in stable parallel duplexes confirming Watson&#8208;Crick type base pairing. When cytosine was facing cytosine, thymine or adenine residues duplex DNA formed silver mediated base pairs. Whereas CD spectra of single strands with &#945;&#8208;D configuration display mirror like shapes to those with &#946;&#8208;configuration the CD spectra of H&#8208;bonded duplexes and those with a limited number of silver pairs form a B&#8208;type double helix almost indistinguishable from natural DNA. Non&#8208;melting silver ion&#8208;DNA complexes with entirely different CD spectra are generated when the silver ions equal the number of base pairs.</dc:description>

      <title>A Full Li&#8208;S Battery with Ultralow Excessive Li Enabled via Lithiophilic and Sulphilic W2C Modulation</title>
      <dc:description>The practical application of Li&#8208;S batteries demands low cell balance (Li  capacity  /S  capacity  ), which involves uniform Li growth, restrained shuttle effect, and fast redox reaction kinetics of S species simultaneously. Herein, with the aid of W  2  C nanocrystals, a freestanding 3D current collector is applied as both Li and S hosts owing to its lithiophilic and sulphilic property. On the one hand, the highly conductive W  2  C can reduce Li nucleation overpotentials, thus guiding uniform Li nucleation and deposition to suppress Li dendrite growth. On the other hand, the polar W  2  C with catalytic effect can enhance the chemisorption affinity to lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) and guarantee fast redox kinetics to restrain S species in cathode region and promote the utilization of S. Surprisingly, a full Li&#8208;S battery with ultralow cell balance of 1.5:1 and high sulfur loading of 6.06 mg cm  &#8208;2  shows obvious redox plateaus of S and maintains high reversible specific capacity of 1020 mAh g  &#8208;1  (6.2 mAh cm  &#8208;2  ) after 200 cycles. This work may shed new sights on the facile design of full Li&#8208;S battery with low excessive Li supply.</dc:description>

      <title>Shedding light on the origin of the&#8208;solid state luminescence enhancement in butterfly molecules</title>

      <title>Self&#8208;Assembly Behavior of Diacetylenic Acid Molecules upon Vapor Deposition: Odd&#8208;Even Effect on the Film Morphology</title>

A molecular dynamic simulation of the aggregation process suggests that two competing intermolecular interactions and thus aggregation directions are involved and modulated by the odd or even carbon chain length. Further modulation of the interaction by substitution of a phenyl group at the terminus of the chain or by changing the carboxyl head group to amidobenzoic acid head group led to similar odd&#8208;even effect but of different dimension or trend, which can be rationalized similarly.

      <dc:description>Controllable synthesis and rational design of ordered nanostructures are crucial for their renewable energy applications. In this work, a mesoporous CoP/Fe2P doped with 5% Ce via a simple nanocasting method is designed as a superior electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER).

A comprehensive analysis demonstrates that the outstanding OER performance due to the desirable combination of the highly exposed active centers in the Ce doped bimetallic phosphides, efficient mass transfer and effective electron conduction across the hierarchically mesoporous hybridization. Furthermore, the synergistic effect between Ce and CoP/Fe2P accelerates the migration rate of electrons/ions and increases the electrochemical active area.

      <title>Insight into the dependence of particle size of ZIF&#8208;8 on the performance in nanocarbon&#8208;based supercapacitors</title>
      <dc:description>Carbon materials derived from zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;8 (ZIF&#8208;8) and the relevant composites have been intensively investigated in the supercapacitors. The particle size of used ZIF&#8208;8 ranges from dozens of nanometers to several microns. So far, the influence of the particle size of ZIF&#8208;8 on the capacitive performances is still not clear. Herein, a series of ZIF&#8208;8 with different particle sizes (from 25 to 296 nm) are synthesized and carbonized for supercapacitors.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Carbon materials derived from zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;8 (ZIF&#8208;8) and the relevant composites have been intensively investigated in the supercapacitors. The particle size of used ZIF&#8208;8 ranges from dozens of nanometers to several microns. So far, the influence of the particle size of ZIF&#8208;8 on the capacitive performances is still not clear. Herein, a series of ZIF&#8208;8 with different particle sizes (from 25 to 296 nm) are synthesized and carbonized for supercapacitors. Based on TEM, EDX mapping, XRD, Raman, nitrogen adsorption/desorption, XPS, and the results of electrochemical tests, the optimal particle size (~70 nm) is obtained for the superior supercapacitor performances in both acidic and alkaline electrolytes. Therefore, this important result provides a significant reference to guide the future research works focused on the ZIF&#8208;8 related to electrochemical response to achieve the best performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Meso and &#223;&#8208;Pyrrole Linked Chlorin&#8208;Bacteriochlorin Dyads for Promoting Far&#8208;Red FRET and Singlet Oxygen Production</title>
      <dc:description>A series of chlorin&#8208;bacteriochlorin dyads (derived from naturally occurring chlorophyll&#8208;a and bacteriochlorophyll&#8208;a), covalently connected either through the meso&#8208;aryl or b&#8208;pyrrole position (position&#8208;3)  via  an ester linkage have been synthesized and characterized as a new class of far&#8208;red emitting fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) imaging, and heavy atom lacking singlet oxygen producing agents.&#160; From systematic absorption, fluorescence, electrochemical and computational studies, the role of chlorin as an energy donor and bacteriochlorin as an energy acceptor in these wide&#8208;band capturing dyads was established.&#160; Efficiency of FRET evaluated from spectral overlap was found to be 95% and 98% for the meso&#8208;linked and b&#8208;pyrrole linked dyads, respectively.&#160; Furthermore, evidence for the occurrence of FRET from singlet&#8208;excited chlorin to bacteriochlorin was secured from studies involving femtosecond transient absorption studies in toluene. The measured FRET rate constants,  k  FRET,  were on the order of 10  11  s  &#8209;1  , suggesting the occurrence of ultrafast energy transfer in these dyads.&#160; Nanosecond transient absorption studies confirmed relaxation of the energy transfer product,  1  BChl*, to its triplet state,  3  Bchl*.&#160; The  3  Bchl* thus generated was capable of producing singlet oxygen with quantum yields comparable to their monomeric entities.

      <dc:description>
Lanthanides can be separated by precipitation using the naturally occurring redox cofactor pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ). Complexes with early lanthanides are preferentially formed and rapidly precipitate out of aqueous solutions in the reported separation method. In addition, the first molecular structure of a PQQ complex with a biologically relevant metal ion outside a protein environment is reported and shows a Eu2PQQ2 dimer.

      <title>Recent advances in heterogeneous catalytic system containing metal ions for phosphate ester hydrolysis</title>
      <dc:description>Organophosphates are a class of organic compounds important for living organisms, forming the building blocks for DNA, RNA and some essential cofactors. Furthermore, non&#8208;natural organophosphates are widely used in industrial applications, including as pesticides, in laundry detergents, and, unfortunately, as chemical weapons agents. In some cases, the natural degradation of organophosphates can take thousands of years; this longevity creates problems associated with handling, and especially with the storage of the waste generated by such phosphate esters. Efforts to develop new catalysts for the cleavage of phosphate esters have progressed in recent decades, mainly in the area of homogeneous catalysis. In contrast, the development of heterogeneous catalysts for the hydrolysis of organophosphates has not been as prominent. In this review, we describe examples of heterogeneous systems and highlight the importance of the development of heterogeneous catalysts applicable to organophosphate hydrolysis, shedding light into recent advances related to the different solid matrices that have been employed.</dc:description>

Efforts to develop new catalysts for the cleavage of phosphate esters have progressed in recent decades, mainly in the area of homogeneous catalysis. In contrast, the development of heterogeneous catalysts for the hydrolysis of organophosphates has not been as prominent. In this review, we describe examples of heterogeneous systems and highlight the importance of the development of heterogeneous catalysts applicable to organophosphate hydrolysis, shedding light into recent advances related to the different solid matrices that have been employed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Copper Based Hybrid Polyion Complexes for Fenton like Reactions</title>
      <dc:description>An innovative strategy allowing the development of a new generation of easy&#8208;to&#8208;prepare and easy&#8208;to&#8208;use nano&#8208;sized catalysts with high tenability is presented.

      <title>Photophysical properties of DCM revisited: fluorescence vs. photoisomerization</title>
      <dc:description>Although the 4&#8208;dicyanomethylene&#8208;2&#8208;methyl&#8208;6&#8208;(p&#8208;dimethylamino&#8208;styryl)&#8208;4H&#8208;pyran (DCM) has been known for many decades as a bright and photostable fluorophore, used for a wide variety of applications in chemistry, biology and physics, only little attention has been paid so far on the presence of multiple isomers and conformers, namely s&#8208;trans&#8208;(E), s&#8208;cis&#8208;(E), s&#8208;trans&#8208;(Z), and s&#8208;cis&#8208;(Z). Especially, the light&#8208;induced E&#8208;Z isomerization plays a great role on the overall photophysical properties of DCM. Here we report the full description of a photoswitchable DCM derivative by a combination of structural, theoretical and spectroscopic methods. The main s&#8208;trans&#8208;(E) isomer is responsible for most of the fluorescence features, whereas the s&#8208;cis&#8208;(E) conformer only contributes marginally. The non&#8208;emitting (Z) isomers are generated in large conversion yields upon visible (e.g., 485 nm or 514 nm) light&#8208;illumination and converted back to the (E) forms under UV irradiation (e.g., 365 nm). Such a photoswitching is efficient, reversible, with high fatigue&#8208;resistance. The E&#8594;Z and Z&#8594;E photoisomerization quantum yields are determined in different solvents and at different irradiation wavelengths. Interestingly, the fluorescence and photoisomerization properties are strongly influenced by the solvent polarity: the fluorescence is predominant at higher polarity, whereas the photoisomerization becomes more efficient at lower polarity. Intermediate medium (THF) represents an optimized situation with a good balance between these two features.</dc:description>

      <title>Fragmentation Mechanism of White Phosphorus: A Theoretical Insight into Multiple Cleavage/Formation of P&#8210;P and P&#8210;C Bonds</title>
      <dc:description>Molecular&#8208;level understanding of metal&#8208;mediated white phosphorus (P 4 ) activation is meaningful but challenging because of its direct relevance to conversion of P 4 into useful organophosphorus compounds as well as the complicated and unforeseeable cleavage process of P&#8210;P bonds. The related study, however, has still rarely been achieved to date. We reported here a theoretical insight into step&#8208;by&#8208;step process of three P&#8210;P bond cleavage/four P&#8210;C bond formation for [P 3 +P 1 ]&#8208;fragmentation of P 4 mediated by lutetacyclopentadienes. The unique charge&#8208;separated intermediate and the intermolecular cooperation between two lutetacyclopentadienes play a vital role in the subsequent P&#8210;P/P&#8210;C bond breaking/forming. It is found that, although the first P&#8210;C formation is involved in the assembly of cyclo &#8208;P 3 [R 4 C 4 P 3 ] &#8210; unit, the construction of the aromatic five&#8208;membered P 1 &#8208;heterocycle [R 4 C 4 P] &#8210; is completed prior to the cyclo &#8208;P 3 formation. The reaction mechanism has been carefully elucidated by the analyses of geometric structure, frontier molecular orbital, bond index, and natural charge, which greatly broaden and enrich general knowledge on the direct functionalization of P 4 .</dc:description>

This systematic investigation allowed us to perform direct comparison of  19  F resonances of fluorinated glucose analogues and also to determine their lipophilicities. Compounds with a fluorine atom at C&#8208;6 are usually the most hydrophilic whereas those with vicinal polyfluorinated motifs are the most lipophilic. Finally, the solvation energies of fluorinated glucose analogues were assessed for the first time using the density functional theory. This method allowed the log  P  prediction of fluoroglucose analogues, which was comparable with the  C  log  P  values obtained from various web&#8208;based programs.</dc:description>

      <title>Single&#8208;Ion Magnetic Behaviour in an Iron(III) Porphyrin Complex: A Dichotomy Between High&#8208;Spin and 5/2&#8722;3/2 Spin Admixture</title>
      <dc:description>We report a mononuclear iron(III) porphyrin compound exhibiting unexpectedly slow magnetic relaxation which is a characteristic of single&#8208;ion magnet behaviour. This behaviour originates from the close proximity (&#8776; 550 cm  &#8211;1  ) of the intermediate&#8208;spin  S  = 3/2 excited states to the high&#8208;spin  S  = 5/2 ground state. More quantitatively, although the ground state is mostly  S  = 5/2, a spin&#8208;admixture model evidences a sizable contribution (&#8776; 15%) of  S  = 3/2 to the ground state, which as a consequence experiences large and positive axial anisotropy (  D =  +19.2 cm  &#8722;1  ). Frequency&#8208;domain EPR allowed us to directly access the  m  S  = |&#177;1/2&#12297; &#8594; |&#177;3/2&#12297; transitions, thus unambiguously measuring the very large zero&#8208;field splitting (ZFS) in this 3d  5  system. Other experimental results including magnetization, M&#246;ssbauer, and field&#8208;domain EPR (HFEPR) studies are consistent with this model, which is also supported by theoretical calculations.</dc:description>

      <title>Expansion of the Na3MIII(Ln/An)6F30&#160;Series: Incorporation of Plutonium into a Highly Robust and Stable Framework</title>

This extreme robustness can potentially be exploited for the sequestration of Pu in a stable matrix; however, no Na  n  MPu  6  F  30  &#160;compounds have been reported so far. Herein, we present four new plutonium fluorides that have been prepared as single crystals via mild hydrothermal synthesis methods. Structural characterizations revealed their compositions to be Na  3  AlPu  6  F  30  , Na  3  FePu  6  F  30  , Na  3  CoPu  6  F  30  , and Na  2.4  Mn  1.6  Pu  6  F  30  . Surprisingly, in the plutonium series it was found that Co  2+  &#160;and Mn  2+  &#160;precursors oxidized to form Na  3  Co  III  Pu  6  F  30  &#160;and Na  2.4  Mn  II/III  1.6  Pu  6  F  30  , whereas the analogous reactions for cerium result in reduction of the transition metal, even when beginning with a M  3+  &#160;precursor.

      <title>Novel reversibly switchable fluorescent molecular systems based on metallacarborane&#8208;perylenediimide conjugates</title>
      <dc:description>Icosahedral metallacarboranes are &#952;&#8208;shaped anionic molecules in which two icosahedra share one vertex that is a metal center. The most remarkable of these compounds is the anionic cobalt&#8208;based metallacarborane [Co(C2B9H11)2]&#8208;  , whose oxidation&#8208;reduction processes occur via an outer sphere electron process. This, along with its low density negative charge, makes [Co(C2B9H11)2]&#8208;  very appealing to participate in electron&#8208;transfer processes. In this work, [Co(C2B9H11)2]&#8208; is tethered to a perylenediimide dye to produce the first examples of switchable luminescent molecules and materials based on metallacarboranes. In particular, the electronic communication of [Co(C2B9H11)2]&#8208;  with the appended chromophore unit in these compounds can be regulated upon application of redox stimuli, which allows the reversible modulation of the emitted fluorescence. As such, they behave as electrochemically&#8208;controlled fluorescent molecular switches in solution, which surpass the performance of previous systems based on conjugates of perylendiimides with ferrocene. Remarkably, they can form gels by treatment with appropriate mixtures of organic solvents, which result from the self&#8208;assembly of the cobaltabisdicarbollide&#8208;perylendiimide conjugates into 1D nanostructures. The interplay between dye &#960;&#8208;stacking and metallacarborane electronic and steric interactions ultimately governs the supramolecular arrangement in these materials, which for one of the compounds prepared allows preserving the luminescent behavior in the gel state.</dc:description>

      <title>Controlled Self&#8208;Assembly of Metallacycle&#8208;Bridged Gold Nanoparticles for Surface&#8208;Enhanced Raman Scattering</title>
      <dc:description>In this work, well&#8208;defined two&#8208;dimensional metallacycles have been successfully employed for the well controlled self&#8208;assembly of gold nanoparticles into discrete clusters such as dimers, trimers, tetramers, pentamers and even hexamers at the water&#8208;oil interface for the first time. Furthermore, the modular construction of metallacycle molecules allows for precise control of interparticle spacing between gold nanoparticles. Interestingly, it was found that the short interparticle spacing below 5 nm created by molecular metallacycle in the resultant discrete gold nanoparticle clusters lead to a strong plasmon coupling, thus inducing great field enhancement inside the gap between the NPs. More importantly, the different discrete clusters with precise interparticle spacing provide a well&#8208;defined system for studying the hot spot phenomenon in surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS), which revealed that the SERS effects were closely related to the interparticle spacing.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In this work, well&#8208;defined two&#8208;dimensional metallacycles have been successfully employed for the well controlled self&#8208;assembly of gold nanoparticles into discrete clusters such as dimers, trimers, tetramers, pentamers and even hexamers at the water&#8208;oil interface for the first time. Furthermore, the modular construction of metallacycle molecules allows for precise control of interparticle spacing between gold nanoparticles. Interestingly, it was found that the short interparticle spacing below 5 nm created by molecular metallacycle in the resultant discrete gold nanoparticle clusters lead to a strong plasmon coupling, thus inducing great field enhancement inside the gap between the NPs. More importantly, the different discrete clusters with precise interparticle spacing provide a well&#8208;defined system for studying the hot spot phenomenon in surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS), which revealed that the SERS effects were closely related to the interparticle spacing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Magnetic Correlation Engineering in Spin&#8208;Sandwiched Layered Magnetic Frameworks</title>
      <dc:description>The insertion of &#8220;sandwiched spin&#8221; between magnetic layers could efficiently affect interlayer magnetic correlations, but doing so increases the complexity in the interlayer spin alignment because of competition between the inserted spin&#8211;layer interaction (  J  NNI  ) and the interlayer through&#8208;space interaction (  J  NNNI  ) if the magnitude of  J  NNI  is of the same degree as  J  NNNI  with reciprocal signs of the respective interactions. Here, we demonstrate the magnetic phase variations systematically tuned by  J  NNI  and  J  NNNI  in two kinds of metal&#8208;variable isostructural series of supramolecular pillared layer magnets, [  M  Cp*  2  ][{Ru  2  II,II  (2,3,5,6&#8208;F  4  CO  2  )  4  }  2  (TCNQ)]&#8901;2DCE (  M  = Co, Fe, Cr; 2,3,5,6&#8208;F  4  PhCO  2  &#8211;  = 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrafluorobenzoate; TCNQ = 7,7,8,8&#8208;tetracyano&#8208;  p  &#8208;quinodimethane; DCE = 1,2&#8208;dichloroethane), and their DCE&#8208;free series, where the [  M  Cp*  2  ]  +  species with  S  = 0, 1/2, and 3/2 for  M  = Co, Fe, Cr, respectively, were sandwiched between ferrimagnetic layers of [{Ru  2  }  2  (TCNQ)]  &#8211;  .

      <dc:description>
Diphenylberyllium has been known for almost a century. However, neither its structure was known nor its reactivity had been studied systematically. Therefore, an in&#8208;depth investigation of the structure of BePh2 in solution, the solid state, as well as of its reactivity was conducted. This enabled, for the first time, a classification of organoberyllium compounds in comparison to the other (pseudo) main group organyles. More information can be found in the Full Paper by M.

      <title>The application of Y modified Lanthanum Zirconate flexible thin film for high&#8208;performance flexible supercapacitor</title>
      <dc:description>With the rapid development of the wearable electronics devices, the increasing demand for developing new flexible energy storage devices with high security has become a hot research. Although the flexible supercapacitors is considered to be an extra performance energy store equipment because of the fast charging/discharging ability, long cycle life, good reliability, wide operating temperature range and et al, there are still many defects need to be improved. Herein, we have successfully synthesized the La  2  Zr  2  O  7  (LZO) thin film as a new energy store material by using a facile electrospinning method and calcination at low temperature. In addition, we have determined the mechanism of producing flexibility of this film by TG, IR and XRD analysis. As the previous studies suggest that charge storage of LZO film can be attributed to the mechanism of oxygen intercalation, we dope the Y element into LZO film to increase the concentration of oxygen vacancies. To obtain the best doping sample, the changes of structures and electrochemical properties of La  2  Y  x  Zr  2&#8208;x  O  3  (0&#8804;x&#8804;0.5) nano&#64257;bers (LNF&#8208;x) with increase of Y content are studied carefully. Since the LNF&#8208;0.1 sample show the highest areal capacitance of 605.3 mF&#183;cm  &#8208;2  at 2 mA&#183;cm  &#8208;2  , a symmetrical flexible device has been fabricated by LNF&#8208;0.1 electrodes.

      <title>Competing Roles of Two Kinds of Ligand during Nonclassical Crystallization of Pillared&#8208;Layer Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks Elucidated Using Microfluidic Systems</title>
      <dc:description>
Microfluidic systems are efficient tools for elucidating the non&#8208;equilibrium state on the crystallization of multi&#8208;component metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs). The understanding of the crystallization mechanism makes it possible to predict the synthesis conditions. Based on the experimental analysis using microflow reactors, nonclassical crystallization processes are proposed, involving two kinds of intermediate states and the competing roles of two kinds of ligand which promote or suppress nucleation.

      <dc:description>
Getting in flow: Time&#8208;consuming trial&#8208;and&#8208;error investigations are required to diversify metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) and predicting the synthesis conditions for such MOFs requires an understanding of the crystallization mechanism. The use of a microflow system, which efficiently captures non&#8208;equilibrium states, led to the proposal of a three&#8208;step nonclassical nucleation mechanism involving two kinds of intermediate.







Abstract
To diversify metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), multi&#8208;component MOFs constructed from more than two kinds of bridging ligand have been actively investigated due to the high degree of design freedom afforded by the combination of multiple ligands. Predicting the synthesis conditions for such MOFs requires an understanding of the crystallization mechanism, which has so far remained elusive. In this context, microflow systems are efficient tools for capturing non&#8208;equilibrium states as they facilitate precise and efficient mixing with reaction times that correspond to the distance from the mixing point, thus enabling reliable control of non&#8208;equilibrium crystallization processes. Herein, we prepared coordination polymers with pillared&#8208;layer structures and observed the intermediates in the syntheses with an in&#8208;situ measurement system that combines microflow reaction with UV/Vis and X&#8208;ray absorption fine&#8208;structure spectroscopies, thereby enabling their rapid nucleation to be monitored. Based on the results, a three&#8208;step nonclassical nucleation mechanism involving two kinds of intermediate is proposed.

      <title>Linear Hydroaminoalkylation Products from Alkyl&#8208;Substituted Alkenes</title>

      <title>Efficient Deep Blue Platinum Acetylide Phosphors with Acyclic Diaminocarbene Ligands</title>

All of the complexes exhibit deep blue phosphorescence with &#955;  max  ~430 nm in poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) thin films. Whereas isocyanide complexes  1  &#8211;  3  exhibit modest photoluminescence quantum yields (  &#934;  PL  ), incorporation of one acyclic diaminocarbene ligand results in a three&#8208;fold to 16&#8208;fold increase in  &#934;  PL  while still maintaining an identical deep blue color profile.</dc:description>

      <title>Ru/CdS quantum dots templated on clay nanotubes as visible light active photocatalysts: optimization of S/Cd ratio and Ru content</title>
      <dc:description>Nanoarchitectual approach based on in situ quantum dots formation within/outside clay nanotubes was developed. The efficient and stable photocatalysts active under visible light were achieved with ruthenium doped cadmium sulfide quantum dots templated on the surface of azine modified halloysite nanotubes. The catalytic activity was tested in hydrogen evolution reaction from water solution of electrolytes under visible light. Ru doping enhanced the photocatalytic activity of CdS quantum dots thanks to better light adsorption and electron&#8208;hole pair separation due to formation of metal&#8208;semiconductor heterojunction. We found that sulfur to cadmium ratio (S/Cd) was the major factor for stable nanoparticles formation on the surface of the azine modified clay. The quantum yield of 9.3% was reached using Ru/CdS/Halloysite containing 5.2 wt. % of Cd doped with 0.1 wt. % of Ru and S/Cd ratio equaling one. CdS/Halloysite hybrid in vivo and in vitro studies demonstrated an absence of toxic effect in eukaryotic cells and nematodes in short term tests, thus providing promising photosensitive materials for multiple applications.</dc:description>

      <title>N&#8208;aryl amides as chemical exchange saturation transfer magnetic resonance imaging contrast agents</title>
      <dc:description>Chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) MRI has recently emerged as a versatile molecular imaging approach in which diamagnetic compounds can be utilized to generate MRI signal. To expand the scope of CEST MRI applications, herein, we systematically investigated the CEST properties of N&#8208;aryl amides with different N&#8208;aromatic substitution, revealing their chemical shifts (4.6&#8208;5.8 ppm) and exchange rates (up to thousands s  &#8208;1  ) are favorable to be used as CEST agents as compared to alkyl amide. As the first proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study, we used CEST MRI to detect the enzymatic metabolism of the drug acebutolol directly by its intrinsic CEST signal without any chemical labeling. Our study implies that N&#8208;acryl amides may enable the label&#8208;free CEST MRI detection of the metabolism of many N&#8208;aryl amide&#8208;containing drugs and a variety of enzymes that act on N&#8208;aryl amide, greatly expanding the scope of CEST MR molecular imaging.</dc:description>

      <title>New Organometallic Ruthenium(II) Compounds Synergistically Show Cytotoxic, Antimetastatic and Antiangiogenic Activities for the Treatment of Metastatic Cancer</title>
      <dc:description>In this study, we newly designed and synthesized a small library of ten structurally related C,N&#8208;cyclometalated ruthenium(II) complexes containing various pyridine&#8208;functionalized NHC ligand and chelating bipyridyl ligands (e.g., 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine, 5,5&#8217;&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine, and 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline (phen)). The complexes were well characterized by NMR, electrospray ionization&#8208;mass spectrometry, and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structure analyses. Among the new ruthenium(II) derivatives, we identified that the complex  Ru8  bearing bulky moieties (i.e., phen and pentamethyl benzene) had the most potent cytotoxicity against all tested cancer cell lines, generating dose&#8208; and cell line&#8208;dependent IC  50  values at the range of 3.3&#8208;15.0 &#956;M. More significantly,  Ru8  not only efficiently inhibited the antimetastasis process against invasion and migration of tumor cells but also exhibited potent antivascular effects by suppressing HUVEC cells migration and tube formation  in vitro  and blocking vessel generation  in vivo  (chicken chorioallantoic membrane model). In a metastatic A2780 tumor xenograft&#8208;bearing mouse model, administration of  Ru8  outperformed antimetastatic agent NAMI&#8208;A and clinically approved cisplatin in terms of antitumor efficacy and inhibition of metastases to other organs. Overall, these data provided compelling evidence that the new cyclometalated ruthenium complex  Ru  8  is an attractive agent because of synergistically suppressing bulky tumors and metastasized tumor nudes. Therefore, the complex  Ru  8  deserves further investigations.</dc:description>

More significantly,  Ru8  not only efficiently inhibited the antimetastasis process against invasion and migration of tumor cells but also exhibited potent antivascular effects by suppressing HUVEC cells migration and tube formation  in vitro  and blocking vessel generation  in vivo  (chicken chorioallantoic membrane model). In a metastatic A2780 tumor xenograft&#8208;bearing mouse model, administration of  Ru8  outperformed antimetastatic agent NAMI&#8208;A and clinically approved cisplatin in terms of antitumor efficacy and inhibition of metastases to other organs. Overall, these data provided compelling evidence that the new cyclometalated ruthenium complex  Ru  8  is an attractive agent because of synergistically suppressing bulky tumors and metastasized tumor nudes. Therefore, the complex  Ru  8  deserves further investigations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>What is best strategy for water soluble fluorescence dyes? &#8211; A case study using long fluorescence lifetime DAOTA dyes</title>
      <dc:description>The lipophilic nature of organic dyes complicates their effectiveness in aqueous solutions. In this work we investigate three different strategies for achieving water&#8208;solubility of the diazaoxatriangulenium (DAOTA  +  ) chromophore: hydrophilic counter ions, aromatic sulfonation of the chromophore, and attachment of charged side chains. The long fluorescence lifetime (FLT, &#964;  f  = 20 ns) of DAOTA  +  makes it a sensitive probe to analyze solvation and aggregation effects. Direct sulfonation of the chromophore was found to increase solubility drastically, but at the cost of greatly reduced quantum yields (QYs) due to enhanced non&#8208;radiative deactivation processes. The introduction of either cationic (4) or zwitterionic side chains (5), however, brings the FLT (&#964;  f  = 18 ns) and QY (&#966;  f  = 0.56) of the dye to the same level as the parent chromophore in acetonitrile. Time&#8208;resolved fluorescence spectroscopy also reveals a high resistance to aggregation and non&#8208;specific binding in a high loading of bovine serum albumin (BSA). The results clearly show that addition of charged flexible side chains is preferable to direct sulfonation of the chromophore core.</dc:description>

      <title>Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura Cross&#8208;Coupling of Bromotryptophan Derivatives at Ambient Temperature</title>
      <dc:description>Mild reaction conditions are highly desirable for bio&#8208;orthogonal side chain derivatizations of amino acids, peptides or proteins due to the sensitivity of these substrates. Transition metal catalyzed cross&#8208;couplings such as Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura reactions are highly versatile, but usually require unfavourable reaction conditions, in particular, when applied with aryl bromides. Ligand&#8208;free solvent&#8208;stabilized Pd&#8208;nanoparticles represent an efficient and sustainable alternative to conventional phosphine&#8208;based catalysts, because the cross&#8208;coupling can be performed at considerably lower temperature. We report on the application of such a highly reactive heterogeneous catalyst for the Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling of brominated tryptophan derivatives. The solvent&#8208;stabilized Pd&#8208;nanoparticles are even more efficient than the literature&#8208;known ADHP&#8208;Pd precatalyst. Interestingly, the latter also leads to the formation of quasi&#8208;homogeneous Pd&#8208;nanoparticles as the catalytic species. One advantage of our approach is the compatibility with aqueous and aerobic conditions at near&#8208;ambient temperatures and short reaction times of only 2 hours. The influence of different N &#945; &#8208;protecting groups, boronic acids as well as the impact of different amino acid side chains in bromotryptophan&#8208;containing peptides has been studied. Notably, a surprising acceleration of the catalysis was observed when palladium&#8208;coordinating side chains were present in proximal positions.</dc:description>

      <title>Theoretical Study on Photoisomerization Mechanisms of Diphenyl Substituted N,C&#8208;chelate Organoboron Compounds</title>
      <dc:description>N, C&#8208;chelate organoboron compounds are widely employed as photo&#8208;responsive and optoelectronic materials due to their efficient photochromic reactivity. It was found in experiments that two diphenyl substituted organoboron compounds, B(ppy)Ph  2  (ppy=2&#8208;phenylpyridyl) and B(iba)Ph  2  (iba=N&#8208;isopropyl&#8208;benzylidene&#8208;amine), display distinct photochemical reactivity. B(ppy)Ph  2  is inert upon irradiation while B(iba)Ph  2  undergoes photo&#8208;induced transformations, yielding BN&#8208;cyclohepta&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triene via a borirane intermediate. In this work, the complete active space self&#8208;consistent field and its second&#8208;order perturbation (CASPT2//CASSCF) methods were used to investigate the photo&#8208;induced reaction mechanisms of B(ppy)Ph  2  and B(iba)Ph  2  . Our calculations showed that the two compounds isomerize to borirane in the same way bypassing a transition state in S  1  state and a conical intersection between S  1  state and S  0  state. The energy barriers in S  1  state are 0.54 eV and 0.26 eV for B(ppy)Ph  2  and B(iba)Ph  2  , which were explained by analyzing the charge distributions of minima in S  0  and S  1  states. Our results provide helpful insights into the excited state dynamics of organoboron compounds, which could assist in rational design of boron&#8208;based photo&#8208;responsive materials.</dc:description>

In this work, the complete active space self&#8208;consistent field and its second&#8208;order perturbation (CASPT2//CASSCF) methods were used to investigate the photo&#8208;induced reaction mechanisms of B(ppy)Ph  2  and B(iba)Ph  2  . Our calculations showed that the two compounds isomerize to borirane in the same way bypassing a transition state in S  1  state and a conical intersection between S  1  state and S  0  state. The energy barriers in S  1  state are 0.54 eV and 0.26 eV for B(ppy)Ph  2  and B(iba)Ph  2  , which were explained by analyzing the charge distributions of minima in S  0  and S  1  states. Our results provide helpful insights into the excited state dynamics of organoboron compounds, which could assist in rational design of boron&#8208;based photo&#8208;responsive materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Advances in Electrochemical Decarboxylative Transformation Reactions</title>
      <dc:description>Owing to their non&#8208;toxic, stable, inexpensive properties, carboxylic acids are considered as environmentally benign alternatives as coupling partners in various organic transformations. Electrochemical mediated decarboxylation of carboxylic acid has emerged as a new and efficient methodology for the construction of carbon&#8211;carbon or carbon&#8211;heteroatom bonds. Compared with transition&#8208;metal catalysis and photoredox catalysis, electro&#8208;organic decarboxylative transformations are considered as a green and sustainable protocol due to the absence of chemical oxidants and strong bases. Further, it exhibits good tolerance with various functional groups. In this minireview, we summarize the recent advances and discoveries on the electrochemical decarboxylative transformations on C&#8211;C and C&#8211;heteroatoms bond formations.</dc:description>

      <title>Supramolecular Sensor for Astringent Procyanidin C1: Fluorescent Artificial Tongue for Wine Components</title>
      <dc:description>An artificial tongue which detects astringent components for comprehensive evaluation of taste has not been established to date. Herein, we first propose fluorescent polythiophene (PT) derivatives (  S1  &#8208;  S3  ) modified with 3&#8208;pyridinum boronic acid as supramolecular chemosensors for wine components including astringent procyanidin C1. After numerous attempts for the synthetic conditions, more than 95 mol% of the PT unit was modified with the pyridinium boronic acid moiety. To evaluate the PT derivatives as chemosensors of the artificial tongue, qualitative and quantitative analyses were performed with four types of wine components (  i.e.  sweet, sour, bitter, and astringent tastes) in combination with pattern recognition models. Notably, procyanidin C1 in actual wine sample was successfully detected in a quantitative manner. In other words, we have established the authentic artificial tongue by the PT based supramolecular chemosensors.</dc:description>

      <title>Nucleotide bearing benzylidene&#8208;tetrahydroxanthylium near&#8208;IR fluorophore for sensing DNA replication, secondary structures and interactions</title>
      <dc:description>Thymidine triphosphate bearing benzylidene&#8208;tetrahydroxanthylium near&#8208;IR fluorophore linked to the 5&#8208;methyl group via triazole was synthesized through CuAAC reaction and was used for polymerase synthesis of labelled DNA probes. The fluorophore lights up upon incorporation to DNA (up to 348&#8208;times) presumably due to interactions in major groove and the fluorescence further increases in single&#8208;stranded oligonucleotide. The labelled dsDNA senses binding of small molecules and proteins by strong decrease of fluorescence. The nucleotide was used as a light&#8208;up building block in real&#8208;time PCR for detection of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 virus.</dc:description>
