         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Carbon Dots as Photon&#8208;Triggered Pyroptosis Inducers for Enhanced Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This concept article highlights the recent developments in the field of PTP using nonmetallic nanomaterials that have photocatalytic properties and can generate reactive oxygen species (ROS). In addition, it aims to offer a systematic overview of the progression and utilization of nonmetallic carbon dots in PTP, thereby contributing to the renewed comprehension of their applications and potential in cancer immunotherapy.








Abstract
Pyroptosis, a highly immunogenic form of programmed cell death, is characterized by the release of proinflammatory cytokines. Recently, researchers have focused on the use of light to control pyroptosis induction, an approach that holds great promise as being relatively noninvasive and allows for precise spatiotemporal control. Photon&#8208;triggered pyroptosis (PTP) has made great progress in cancer immunotherapy. This concept article highlights the recent developments of metal&#8208;free nanomaterials (especially carbon dots) mediated&#8208;PTP, including the synthetic routes, their photophysical properties and applications in the area of cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Synthesis of PI, PIII, and PV Compounds Supported by Bis(benzimidazole)Benzene</title>

The phosphorus compounds bearing a NCN&#8208;type pincer ligand, the 4&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;2,6&#8208;bis(benzimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)benzene ligand (BZIMB), were synthesized and characterized using spectroscopic methods. Compared with the P&#9472;N bond in topologically related compounds bearing an NNN&#8208;type pincer ligand, the robust P&#9472;C bond allows reactions with various reagents, leading to phosphorus compounds in different oxidation states without dissociation of the phosphorus atom.








Abstract
A series of phosphorus compounds bearing the 4&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;2,6&#8208;bis(benzimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)benzene ligand (BZIMB) were prepared and fully characterized using spectroscopic methods, including X&#8208;ray crystallography. Reaction of the PIII compounds with electrophilic reagents led to PV compounds. Reaction with reducing reagents led to PI phosphinidenes. The phosphinidenes react with electrophilic reagents to generate new PIII compounds. In contrast to topologically related compounds featuring labile P&#9472;N bonds, the robust P&#9472;C bond between the phosphorus center and the ligand prevents dissociation of the phosphorus atom during oxidation and reduction, showing the potential for small molecule activation and opening the door for future catalytic studies.

         <title>A General Synthesis Approach to Double&#8208;Guanidinium Stapled Peptides and Foldamers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Our previous guanidinium stapling strategy has been extended to the generation of bis&#8208;guanidinium stapled peptides and foldamers. This rapid and efficient approach, developed on solid&#8208;support, allows for easy modulation of the ring size and the nature of the linker to reach high affinity hDM2 binders.








Abstract
In the broader context of peptide macrocyclization, methods enabling the formation of specific crosslinks between orthogonally protected, amino&#8208;functionalized side chains (e.g., Lys&#8211;Lys crosslinks) are of potential interest for expanding molecular diversity and stabilizing peptide secondary structures. We recently introduced a solid&#8208;phase synthesis approach for the rapid generation of guanidinium stapled helical peptides and have shown their utility for inhibition of protein&#8211;protein interactions. Whereas our previous work concentrated on the formation of mono&#8208;guanidinium crosslinks, we show here that we can expand this approach to prepare bis&#8208;guanidinium stapled peptides and foldamers on&#8208;resin. The methodology similarly uses two orthogonally protected amino&#8208;functionalized side chains and features the use of a diamino connector. The two guanidinium groups are introduced sequentially, the first one intermolecularly and the second intramolecularly. The method is compatible with the i,i&#160;+&#160;4 and i,i&#160;+&#160;7 cyclization schemes and tolerates a diversity of diamino linkers. We applied the strategy to the synthesis of macrocyclic inhibitors of hDM2 and hDMX and identified several high affinity binders for the two proteins.

         <title>T&#189; Tuning in a Synergistic BODIPY&#8208;Tetrazole Fe(II) Spin&#8208;Crossover&#8208;Photoluminescence System via Co&#8208;Ligand Variation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a modular spin crossover&#8208;photoluminescence (SCO&#8208;PL) system: heteroleptic, mononuclear Fe(II) coordination compounds bearing equatorial BODIPY fluorophores that exhibit synergistic PL response upon spin state switching. Exchanging apical nitrile co&#8208;ligands tunes electronic and structural properties, giving precise control over the SCO and PL response. This versatile SCO&#8208;PL platform offers bifunctional behavior for photonic applications.








Abstract
Bifunctional materials combining spin crossover (SCO) and photoluminescence (PL), offering noncontact and highly sensitive spin&#8208;state detection, are promising candidates for application in photonic devices. However, independently tuning the SCO and PL properties to achieve synergistic SCO&#8208;PL behavior remains challenging. Herein, we present a series of heteroleptic Fe(II) coordination compounds with the general formula [Fe(L)4(RCN)2](ClO4)2&#8226;nRCN, bearing four BODIPY&#8208;derived fluorophores L (L&#160;=&#160;4,4&#8208;difluoro&#8208;1,3,5,7&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;8&#8208;[(1H&#8208;tetrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)methyl]&#8208;4&#8208;bora&#8208;3a,4a&#8208;diaza&#8208;s&#8208;indacene) in the equatorial positions and variable RCN co&#8208;ligands (CH3CH2CN, CH2CHCN, CH3(CH2)2CN, PhCN) in the apical positions. The systematic variation of the co&#8208;ligand modulates steric and/or electronic effects, thereby influencing the SCO behavior without perturbing the PL characteristics. Magnetic susceptibility measurements revealed T1/2 =&#160;220&#160;K and 270&#160;K for R&#160;=&#160;CH3CH2 and R&#160;=&#160;CH2CH, respectively, indicating that electronic effects modulate T1/2. Conversely, for R&#160;=&#160;Ph and R&#160;=&#160;CH3(CH2)2 the SCO capability is progressively lost, with the latter showing no spin&#8208;switching at all. Temperature&#8208;dependent PL studies display an increase in emission upon the SCO, most pronounced for [Fe(L)4(CH3CH2CN)2](ClO4)2&#8226;2CH3CH2CN, which can be attributed to electronic coupling between the SCO center and the fluorophore. This work establishes a single&#8208;molecule SCO&#8208;PL platform, in which the SCO behavior can be tuned independently from the PL response, paving the way for tailored molecular sensors and optical switches.

         <title>Proton Conductivities of Stepwise Protonated Imidazole&#8208;Fused Tetraphenylene Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Proton conducting tetraphenylene molecules (ImTP) containing a imidazole group were controlled by the degree of protonation. By controlling the degree of protonation from neutral ImTP to H1ImTP&#8314;, H2ImTP2&#8314;, and H4ImTP&#8308;&#8314;, we demonstrated that the balance between intermolecular hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions affects structural stability and proton conductivity.








Abstract
The control of crystal structure and proton conductivity was evaluated by stepwise protonation of tetraphenylene molecules (ImTP) containing a imidazole group. By controlling the degree of protonation from neutral ImTP to H1ImTP&#8314;, H2ImTP2&#8314;, and H4ImTP&#8308;&#8314;, we demonstrated that the balance between intermolecular hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions affects structural stability and proton conductivity. X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis revealed that neutral ImTP forms a 2D hydrogen bond network, while H1ImTP&#8314; exhibits enhanced structural stability due to N&#9472;H&#8314;&#183;&#183;&#183;Cl&#8722; electrostatic interactions. H2ImTP2&#8314; forms a 3D network, and H4ImTP&#8308;&#8314; becomes amorphous. Under 40% relative humidity conditions, these compounds adsorb H2O to form proton conduction pathways, exhibiting conductivities of 3.20&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;7, 3.38&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;6, 1.35&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;6, and 6.20&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;6 S cm&#8722;1 at &#8764;363&#160;K for n&#160;=&#160;0, 1, 2, and 4 of HnImTPn&#8314;Cl&#8722;n system, respectively. In particular, H1ImTP&#8314; exhibits an optimal balance between hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions, resulting in high structural stability, reversible H2O adsorption, and proton conductivity.

         <title>Cover Feature: Metal&#8211;Ligand Cooperativity via &#928;&#8211;&#928; Interactions Supporting Outer&#8208;Sphere Hydride Transfer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 56, October 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel form of metal&#8211;ligand cooperativity is presented in which an outer&#8208;sphere hydride transfer is supported by &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions between the aromatic rings of the ligand and substrate. The potential energy landscape is illustrated by a mountain range where the tallest peaks symbolize transition states lacking &#960;&#8208;stabilization. A playful analogy likens the beneficial &#960;&#8211;interaction to a &#8220;pie&#8221;, much like how &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking sweetens the energy profile.

         <title>Small Molecular Dibenzochalcogenophenes as Potent Organic Emitters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 56, October 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review compiles recent achievements and applications of purely organic small luminescent DBC. We present frequently employed functionalities and design strategies, accomplishing room temperature phosphorescence (RTP). In addition, we discuss the challenges for luminescent selenium and tellurium derivatives as well as the influence of commercial impurities on the photophysical properties of this compound class.








Abstract
Dibenzochalcogenophenes (DBC) have attracted huge attention ever since the discovery that they are able to act as potent (phosphorescent) emitters more than 60 years ago. From then on, they were extensively used as versatile emissive platforms for applications in materials science and optoelectronics. In this review, we focus on the main achievements of the past 20 years, highlighting especially monomolecular small purely organic compounds with less than 10 aromatic units and only one chalcogenophene moiety. Besides this, we wish to focus on their emission properties and to evaluate general design principles to fine&#8208;tune photophysical properties.

         <title>Ar&#8211;X Coupling Reactions of Cationic Aryl Copper(II) Complexes with Organic Substrates: What Role Do Radicals Play?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 56, October 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
One of the simplest cationic copper(II) aryl complexes with a bidentate chelating ligand, [(phen)Cu(Ph)]+, has been prepared in the gas phase via three routes: transmetalation, desulfination and decarboxylation. The bimolecular reactivity of this organocopper(II) cation towards a range of organic substrates showcases versatile C&#8211;H, C&#8211;C, C&#8211;I, and C&#8211;S bond formation pathways, some of which involve formation of radicals.








Abstract
Copper(II) aryl species are proposed intermediates in copper catalysed C&#8208;X coupling reactions. Here, the formation and reactions of the cationic copper complexes [(phen)Cu(Ar)]+ (phen&#160;=&#160;1,10&#8208;phenanthroline; Ar&#160;=&#160;Ph, p&#8208;MeC6H4, p&#8208;MeOC6H4, p&#8208;MeCOC6H4) are explored in the gas&#8208;phase using electrospray ionisation (ESI) multistage mass spectrometry (MSn) experiments in a linear ion trap mass spectrometer together with Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. A survey of three routes to the preparation of [(phen)Cu(Ph)]+ showed that transmetalation of [(phen)3Cu][BPh4]+ and desulfination of [(phen)Cu(O2SPh)]+ both produced the desired complex [(phen)Cu(Ph)]+, but decarboxylation of [(phen)Cu(O2CPh)]+ gave a higher yield with fewer competing side reactions, making it the preferred route to the other aryl complexes [(phen)Cu(Ar)]+. The aryl complexes [(phen)Cu(Ar)]+ undergo protonolysis reactions with formic acid to yield a formate complex [(phen)Cu(O2CH)]+; react with N,N&#8242;&#8208;diisopropylcarbodiimide to form an adduct, likely by insertion to give [(phen)Cu((NiPr)2CAr)]+; undergo C&#8211;S bond&#8208;forming reactions with dimethyl disulfide; and react with allyl iodide by Ar&#8211;I bond&#8208;forming reactions in preference to Ar&#8211;allyl bond cross&#8208;coupling reactions. The potential reaction mechanisms associated with the different reaction pathways were explored by DFT calculations.

The bimolecular reactivity of this organocopper(II) cation towards a range of organic substrates showcases versatile C&#8211;H, C&#8211;C, C&#8211;I, and C&#8211;S bond formation pathways, some of which involve formation of radicals.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copper(II) aryl species are proposed intermediates in copper catalysed C-X coupling reactions. Here, the formation and reactions of the cationic copper complexes [(phen)Cu(Ar)]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (phen&#160;=&#160;1,10-phenanthroline; Ar&#160;=&#160;Ph, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-MeC&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-MeOC&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-MeCOC&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) are explored in the gas-phase using electrospray ionisation (ESI) multistage mass spectrometry (MS&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;) experiments in a linear ion trap mass spectrometer together with Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. A survey of three routes to the preparation of [(phen)Cu(Ph)]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; showed that transmetalation of [(phen)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cu][BPh&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and desulfination of [(phen)Cu(O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SPh)]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; both produced the desired complex [(phen)Cu(Ph)]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, but decarboxylation of [(phen)Cu(O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CPh)]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; gave a higher yield with fewer competing side reactions, making it the preferred route to the other aryl complexes [(phen)Cu(Ar)]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. The aryl complexes [(phen)Cu(Ar)]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; undergo protonolysis reactions with formic acid to yield a formate complex [(phen)Cu(O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH)]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;; react with &lt;i&gt;N,N&#8242;&lt;/i&gt;-diisopropylcarbodiimide to form an adduct, likely by insertion to give [(phen)Cu((N&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;Pr)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CAr)]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;; undergo C&#8211;S bond-forming reactions with dimethyl disulfide; and react with allyl iodide by Ar&#8211;I bond-forming reactions in preference to Ar&#8211;allyl bond cross-coupling reactions. The potential reaction mechanisms associated with the different reaction pathways were explored by DFT calculations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Bichromophoric Triazatruxene Tetrad as a Highly Tunable Multicolor Emitter and Its Application in OLEDs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 56, October 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report on a TAT tetrad, whose propargylic linkers electronically decouple the central TAT unit from the peripheral ones. This results in dual fluorescence and, at 77&#160;K, dual phosphorescence emission. The emission color varies with excitation wavelength from blue to yellowish white or orange.








Abstract
We report on the new star&#8208;shaped triazatruxene (TAT) tetrad 1, where three peripheral TAT moieties connect to a central TAT through propargylic spacers. The insulating nature of the linkers results in separate, partially overlapping blue and yellow&#8208;orange emissions from the peripheral and central TATs. This renders 1 a multicolor emitter, whose emission color can be tuned by the choice of the excitation wavelength and the solvent. In frozen solution, dual fluorescence emission from the two different types of TATs is complemented by dual phosphorescence with radiative lifetimes in the range of seconds. Organic light&#8208;emitting devices (OLEDs) constructed with 1 as the emissive layer achieved a peak irradiance of 5.87 &#181;W/nm/m2 at 580&#160;nm at an operation voltage of 6.7&#160;V. Remarkably, the emission color of the electroluminescence can be varied from yellow over different hues of orange to red or&#160;even to near infrared (NIR) emission, depending on the applied voltage. Tetrad 1 is also redox&#8208;active, indicating that 1 may simultaneously serve as a hole conductor and emitter. Its oxidized forms are panchromatic absorbers from the near UV to the NIR due to intra&#8208; and inter&#8208;TAT charge&#8208;transfer (CT) absorptions.

         <title>An Unusual Activity of Conformationally Restricted Naphthalene Peri&#8208;Dichalcogenides in the Reduction of Nitro and Azide Groups</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 56, October 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work highlights the unique ability of a conformationally restricted dichalcogenide to reduce nitro and azide groups to their corresponding amines under physiological conditions. The redox potential is strongly influenced by the nature of chalcogen atom substitution as well as the conformational rigidity of the dichalcogenide bond.








Abstract
Rigid and conformationally restricted dichalcogenides based on 1,8&#8208;naphthyl system have attracted significant interest as electron donors in charge transfer complexes and organic electrode materials. Recently, naphthalene&#8208;1,8&#8208;peri&#8208;diselenides have been shown to mimic the function of two major selenoenzymes&#160;&#8722;&#160;iodothyronine deiodinase (Dio) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) &#8722; mainly through two&#8208;electron redox processes involving deiodination of thyroid hormones and thiol&#8208;mediated reduction of hydrogen peroxide, respectively. Herein, we report that naphthalene&#8208;1,8&#8208;peri&#8208;dichalcogenides can mediate a six&#8208;electron reduction of organic nitro compounds to produce the corresponding primary amines at physiologically relevant temperature (37 &#176;C) using water as the solvent. The stepwise reduction process is highly dependent on the nature of the chalcogen atom present at the peri&#8208;positions of the naphthyl ring. While no reduction was observed with the disulfide, the selenenyl sulfide mediated a four&#8208;electron reduction of the nitro group to the corresponding hydroxylamine. The diselenide and ditelluride reduced the nitro groups all the way to amines through six&#8208;electron transfer. The diselenides also mediated the reduction of various aromatic azides to the corresponding primary amines.

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis and Biological Evaluation of 1,3&#8208; and 1,4&#8208;Disubstituted Isoquinoline&#8208;Containing Lipoxin A4 Analogues</title>

(1R)&#8208; and (1S)&#8208;Epimers of novel isoquinoline&#8208;derived SPMs were prepared, with a Pd&#8208;catalyzed Heck reaction and a Ru(II)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric transfer hydrogenation as the key synthetic steps. Biological assessment demonstrated that several analogues significantly attenuate lipopolysaccharide&#8208;induced NF&#8208;&#954;B activation and downstream pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokine secretion, including IL&#8208;6, IL&#8208;1&#946;, and TNF.








Abstract
The resolution of inflammation is increasingly recognized as an active, highly regulated process essential for restoring tissue homeostasis following immune activation. Lipoxin&#8208;A4 (LXA4), an endogenous specialized pro&#8208;resolving mediator (SPM), plays a central role in this process through activation of the ALX/FPR2 receptor. However, its clinical application is limited by rapid metabolic degradation and poor in vivo stability. In this study, we report the design, asymmetric synthesis, and biological evaluation of novel 1,3&#8208; and 1,4&#8208;disubstituted isoquinoline&#8208;based analogues of LXA4 (Isoq&#8208;sLXms), designed to enhance metabolic stability. The synthetic route employed a palladium&#8208;catalyzed Heck cross&#8208;coupling and Ru(II)&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric transfer hydrogenation, affording diastereomerically pure compounds. Biological assessment in THP&#8208;1 LUCIA monocytes demonstrated that several analogues, particularly (1R)&#8208;8, significantly attenuate lipopolysaccharide (LPS)&#8208;induced NF&#8208;&#954;B activation and downstream pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokine secretion, including IL&#8208;6, IL&#8208;1&#946;, and TNF. Functional assays using ALX/FPR2&#8208;transfected HEK&#8208;293 cells revealed that (1R)&#8208;8 acts as a partial agonist, supporting its role in engaging pro&#8208;resolving signaling mechanisms. Safety profiling confirmed low cytotoxicity across physiologically relevant concentrations. These findings demonstrate that isoquinoline&#8208;based LXA4 mimetics retain and enhance key pro&#8208;resolving bioactivities while offering improved stability and receptor selectivity. (1R)&#8208;8 emerges as a promising lead compound for the development of resolution&#8208;directed therapeutics in the context of chronic inflammation.

Abstract
A Br&#248;nsted acidic ionic liquid (BAIL)&#8208;catalyzed one&#8208;pot tandem reduction of quinoline to tetrahydroquinoline (THQ) followed by reductive alkylation by the aldehyde has been demonstrated under mild reaction conditions with a shorter reaction time. This step&#8208;economical synthetic approach is suitable for late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex bioactive molecules. The reaction is highly chemoselective and tolerates a wide range of reducible&#8208;sensitive functional groups. The current reductive N&#8208;alkylation approach was also successfully utilized to synthesize novel tricyclic oxazino&#8208;fused&#8208;tetrahydroquinoline/benzoxazine compounds via tandem reductive cyclization of 1&#8208;aryl&#8208;2&#8208;(8&#8208;quinolinyloxy) ethanones. Further reductive protocol has been applied for the synthesis of antiarrhythmic drug nicainoprol and tubulin polymerization inhibitor efficiently. Notably, BAIL was easily recovered and reused multiple times without a considerable loss in catalytic activity. The elucidation of the underlying mechanism was achieved through a combination of several control experiments, kinetic studies, and isotopic labelling experiments. This study offers a new reaction pathway for the reduction of quinoline, in which BAIL facilitates proton transfer through a distinctive hydrogen bonding ion&#8208;pair mechanism.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Br&#248;nsted acidic ionic liquid (&lt;b&gt;BAIL&lt;/b&gt;)-catalyzed one-pot tandem reduction of quinoline to tetrahydroquinoline (THQ) followed by reductive alkylation by the aldehyde has been demonstrated under mild reaction conditions with a shorter reaction time. This step-economical synthetic approach is suitable for late-stage functionalization of complex bioactive molecules. The reaction is highly chemoselective and tolerates a wide range of reducible-sensitive functional groups. The current reductive &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-alkylation approach was also successfully utilized to synthesize novel tricyclic oxazino-fused-tetrahydroquinoline/benzoxazine compounds via tandem reductive cyclization of 1-aryl-2-(8-quinolinyloxy) ethanones. Further reductive protocol has been applied for the synthesis of antiarrhythmic drug nicainoprol and tubulin polymerization inhibitor efficiently. Notably, &lt;b&gt;BAIL&lt;/b&gt; was easily recovered and reused multiple times without a considerable loss in catalytic activity. The elucidation of the underlying mechanism was achieved through a combination of several control experiments, kinetic studies, and isotopic labelling experiments. This study offers a new reaction pathway for the reduction of quinoline, in which BAIL facilitates proton transfer through a distinctive hydrogen bonding ion-pair mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

The ring expansion of &#945;&#8208;cyclopropyl diazoacetates into cyclobutenoates upon irradiation at 425&#160;nm was reported in moderate to excellent yields (17% to 75%) and moderate to good regioisomeric ratio (55:45 to 82:18). The formation of two regioisomers was explained using DFT calculations as well as the involvement of a singlet state carbene.

         <title>Acidity Controlled Formal Nucleophilic Substitution of Hydrofluoroolefin&#8208;Based Iodonium Salt with O&#8208;nucleophiles: Synthetic Application and Mechanistic Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 56, October 8, 2025. </description>

A new method using hypervalent iodonium species derived from hydrofluoroolefin gas enables fast, mild, and efficient synthesis of fluoroalkyl ethers from phenols. Experimental and DFT mechanistic studies show that phenol acidity influences the reaction pathway.








Abstract
The development and mechanistic investigation of a novel O&#8208;fluoroalkylation of phenol derivatives using a hypervalent fluoroalkyliodonium salt, derived from hydrofluoroolefin gas (HFO&#8208;1234yf) as bulk fluorous feedstock, is reported. Optimization of the reaction conditions enabled versatile and efficient synthetic applications, and the synthetic study revealed phenol acidity&#8208;dependent selectivity of the O&#8208;fluoroalkylation process. The mechanistic behavior of phenols was supported by both experimental studies and DFT calculations. As a result, we showed that more acidic phenols (pKa &lt; 5) undergo direct O&#8208;alkylation, while reactions of the fluoroalkyliodonium salt involving less acidic phenol substrates proceed via a base&#8208;assisted chloride elimination and substitution pathway. Deuterium&#8208;labeling and halide competition experiments further validated the proposed mechanism. This practical and scalable method provides access to structurally diverse fluoroalkyl ethers and holds significant potential for applications in medicinal and materials chemistry.

         <title>A Strategic Advance from Pincer Complexes to Hexadentate&#8208;Co(III) Catalyst for Metal&#8211;Ligand Cooperative Activation of Primary Alcohols to Access Highly Functionalized Pyrimidines</title>

Herein, we have developed a first cobalt(III) catalyst [Co(III)BPMAP&#8208;O]ClO4 supported by a hexadentate ligand system with a metal&#8208;ligand cooperative approach for sustainable multicomponent reaction to access a library of highly substituted pyrimidines (150 examples) using dehydrogenation of aromatic as well as inactive aliphatic primary alcohols.








Abstract
In this report, we present a sustainable, eco&#8208;friendly, practical, and cost&#8208;effective one&#8208;pot three&#8208;component reaction for the synthesis of a diverse library of highly substituted pyrimidines from amidines, primary alcohols, and aromatic ketones, catalyzed by a cobalt(III) complex. The well&#8208;defined cobalt(III) complex [Co(III)BPMAP&#8208;O]ClO4 is derived from a redox&#8208;active phosphine&#8208;free, pentadentate mono&#8208;carboxamide ligand (BPMAP&#8208;H), and is formed in situ from various cobalt(II) sources, including CoCl2&#183;6H2O, CoBr2, Co(NO3)2&#183;6H2O, Co(OAc)2&#183;4H2O via oxygen activation. Using aromatic ketones and benzyl alcohols, a wide range of 2,4,6&#8208;trisubstituted pyrimidines (TriPym) and 2,4,5,6&#8208;tetrasubstituted pyrimidines (TetraPym) were synthesized (119 examples) in isolated yields of up to 93%. The catalytic system is also applicable to aliphatic ketones and aliphatic primary alcohols, affording 31 additional examples with yields of up to 92%. Control experiments and DFT calculations support a plausible mechanism involving dehydrogenation of the alcohols through a metal&#8208;ligand cooperative pathway.

         <title>Electrochemical and Photoelectrochemical Transformations of Thioamides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 56, October 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work describes efficient EC and iPEC methods for the transformation of thioamides. The EC approach is inexpensive, mild, and metal&#8208; and catalyst&#8208;free. On the other hand, the interfacial iPEC method, due to the lower applied potential, proved to be beneficial in terms of broadening the scope and limitations and energy efficiency.








Abstract
Pursuing innovative and environmentally friendly synthetic strategies is always a desirable goal in organic synthesis, and thus, we have developed green and sustainable electrochemical (EC) and photoelectrochemical (iPEC) transformations of thioamides into amides. The established EC protocol is inexpensive, mild, and metal&#8208; and catalyst&#8208;free. iPEC cells are extensively studied for solar energy conversion, but their application in synthesizing high&#8208;value organic molecules has been limited. Here, we describe a strategy to use BiVO4, an abundant and robust photoanode, for the desulfurization of thioamides. Under light irradiation, the photogenerated holes in BiVO4 oxidize thioamides to radical cations, which further react with the oxygen radical anion to produce amides. The proposed iPEC strategy presents a high promise for green organic chemical transformations with the goal of maximizing not only the atom economy but also the energy efficiency.

         <title>Speciation and Luminescence of a Binuclear Lanthanide Complex Bearing an Aminophenolate Chromophore</title>

Lanthanide complexes are used in patients and for bioimaging and assays. The solution structure and speciation are critical when evaluating function, and here we fully unravel the structure and photophysics of a binuclear lanthanide complex.








Abstract
Lanthanide(III) complexes show diverse speciation in solution. Here, the photophysical properties and speciation in solution of binuclear lanthanide complexes bearing an aminophenolate chromophore that reversibly bind to both metal centers were determined. The aminophenolate can reversibly bind to both lanthanide ions in a pH dependent manner. Above pH 3 the phenolate moiety remains deprotonated and the lanthanide complexes exhibit very high kinetic stability, however, protonation of the amino group modulates the luminescence intensity without changing the luminescence lifetime of the lanthanide. Below pH 3, protonation of the phenol results in a flexible, open structure, leading to reversible demetallation of the lanthanide complex as the system comes under thermodynamic control. This study highlights the importance of a detailed understanding of both the speciation and pH responsive behavior of highly luminescent binuclear lanthanide complexes for their development as responsive probes. These results confirm the promise of phenolate derived binuclear complexes as highly luminescent responsive probes, modulated by changes in pH.

         <title>New ESIPT&#8208;Dyes of Record Capacity to Fluorescence Detection of H&#8208;Bond Donor and Acceptor Molecules, Including Local Water Concentration</title>

Multi&#8208;color fluorescent labels for detecting local water concentration at a selected cite of lipid&#8208;protein, protein&#8208;protein or protein&#8208;DNA complexes.








Abstract
5&#8208;Substituted 3&#8208;hydroxychromones (3&#8208;HCs) are challenging to synthesize but are of significant interest as fluorescent labels. This is primarily due to the pronounced modulation of their fluorescence by surrounding molecules, a consequence of the 5&#8208;substituent's proximity to the negative pole of the molecular dipole. The newly synthesized derivatives of 3&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;(4&#8208;methoxyphenyl)&#8208;4&#8208;oxo&#8208;4H&#8208;chromene&#8208;5&#8208;carboxylic acid exhibit unique fluorescence behaviors. Their color of emission is highly sensitive to the solvation environment and is strongly influenced by the nature of the functional group introduced at position 5. Notably, the fluorescence of acid demonstrates inhibition of ESIPT (excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer) in both neutral and H&#8208;bond donor solvents, a phenomenon not previously observed in 3&#8208;HCs. Furthermore, investigated dye stands out as the first 3&#8208;HC compound whose fluorescence responds to the H&#8208;bond acceptor capacity of the environment, particularly in mildly acidic conditions (below pH 6). In contrast, methyl ester and glycine amide of key acid are responsive to the H&#8208;bond donor properties of their surroundings&#8212;a feature especially relevant in biological systems, where local water concentration plays a critical role. Thus, the derivatives such as N&#8208;terminal or lysine&#8208;labeled peptides incorporating these dyes can serve as valuable tools for investigating peptide&#8208;DNA, peptide&#8208;lipid, and other biomolecular interactions for the selected location of peptide.

         <title>The Important Role of the Polarization Effect in Cationic Hypervalent Chalcogen Bonds Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 56, October 8, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
DFT calculations demonstrate that increasing the central atom size (Se/Te) and incorporating stronger electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents (&#8208;CF3, &#8208;F, &#8208;NO2) in cationic hypervalent ChB catalysts amplify the &#963;&#8208;hole, thereby strengthening ChB interactions. This polarization effect significantly lowers the bromine transfer barrier in the NBS bromolactonization reaction, enabling efficient and tunable organocatalysis.








Abstract
Chalcogen bond (ChB) catalysts have recently garnered considerable attention in the field of organocatalysis owing to their advantages of nontoxicity, environmental sustainability, extensive applicability, affordability, and remarkable reactivity. In this work, the Se&#8208; and Te&#8208;based cationic hypervalent ChB catalysis on the bromolactonization reaction of N&#8208;Bromosuccinimide (NBS) with 4&#8208;pentenoic acid is investigated by high&#8208;level density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The ChB&#8208;catalyzed bromolactonization reaction has an intricate process involving bromine transfer, cyclization, and proton transfer. Moreover, the bromine transfer process is identified as the rate&#8208;determining step with the highest Gibbs free energy barrier. The increase in the size of the central atom in the ChB catalysts and the enhancement of electron&#8208;withdrawing capabilities with greater dipole moments of substitutions on the catalysts provide larger &#963;&#8208;holes with stronger polarization effects, resulting in stronger ChB interactions with the reactant, thus lowering the reaction barrier. From a kinetic perspective, different electron&#8208;withdrawing groups on the catalyst can be used to regulate the reaction rate, leading to better experimental outcomes. These findings demonstrate the important roles of polarization effects in cationic hypervalent chalcogen bonds catalysis and provide a theoretical foundation for the development of novel environmentally friendly and efficient hypervalent ChB catalysts.

A set of new Ru(II)&#8208;CNC pincer complexes with benzimidazolylidenes and their catalytic activity toward &#945;&#8208;alkylation of ketones using primary alcohols is reported. These complexes can operate via inner&#8208; and outer&#8208;sphere mechanisms for the alcohol dehydrogenation step; however, the outer&#8208;sphere path is favored for the subsequent steps. The outer&#8208;sphere hydride transfer is found to be supported by &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions as a new type of metal&#8211;ligand cooperativity.








Abstract
A set of phosphine&#8208;free Ru(II)&#8208;CNC pincer complexes with benzimidazolylidene&#8208;based CNC&#8208;ligands has been synthesized and characterized, which show excellent catalytic activity toward &#945;&#8208;alkylation of ketones using primary alcohols. DFT investigations revealed that these seemingly nonbifunctional complexes can operate via inner&#8208; and outer&#8208;sphere mechanisms for the alcohol dehydrogenation step; however, the outer&#8208;sphere path is favored for the subsequent steps. The outer&#8208;sphere path is found to be supported by &#960;&#8211;&#960; interaction between the extended aromatic ring system of the benzimidazolylidene&#8208;based CNC&#8208;ligand and aromatic rings of the substrates in a new, unprecedented case of metal&#8211;ligand cooperativity.

Natural rhodochrosite as a catalyst with unique activity in methane oxidation.








Abstract
Rhodochrosite, a naturally occurring MnCO3${\rm MnCO}_3$&#8208;based mineral with inherent compositional complexity, is investigated as a catalyst for methane oxidation. The material exhibits distinctive catalytic behavior, including enhanced C2${\rm C}_2$ hydrocarbon formation and selective CO production, attributed to its multielemental composition and dynamic phase transformations under reaction conditions. In particular, rhodochrosite suppresses CO formation while enhancing C2H4${\rm C}_2{\rm H}_4$ production compared to pure MnCO3${\rm MnCO}_3$, the primary component of rhodochrosite. Thermal treatment converts rhodochrosite into mixed manganese oxide phases (Mn2O3${\rm Mn}_2{\rm O}_3$, Mn3O4${\rm Mn}_3{\rm O}_4$), while trace elements and mineral impurities are retained and may influence oxide phase evolution and catalytic behavior. These findings highlight the potential of natural multicomponent minerals as compositionally diverse, phase&#8208;adaptive platforms for selective methane&#160;conversion.

         <title>Substituent Effects on Sulfur Phenolate Exchange Reactions: Reactivity and Bonding Analysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Orbital interactions, and to smaller effect: solvent effects, dominate over Pauli repulsions to determine the success of the SuPhenEx click reaction.








Abstract
The Sulfur Phenolate Exchange reaction (SuPhenEx) provides a fluorine&#8208;free alternative S(VI) exchange chemistry by substituting nitrophenolate as the leaving group instead of fluoride (as in SuFEx reactions), offering a synthetically appealing and environmentally friendly approach in click chemistry. Despite its significance, the reaction mechanism and the underlying electronic interactions in the course of the reaction have yet to be thoroughly explored at the molecular level. Here, we elucidate the electronic interactions of a series of SuPhenEx model reactions between various para&#8208;substituted phenolates (p&#8208;R&#8208;Ph&#8208;O&#8211;) as nucleophiles and PhSO2&#8208;OPh&#8211;p&#8208;NO2 as an electrophile, in both gas and solvent (acetonitrile) phases. As tools, we apply the Activation Strain Model based on density functional theory. We identified the HOMO&#8211;LUMO interaction as the key determinant of reactivity in the gas phase, which shifts to include (HOMO&#8208;1)&#8211;(LUMO&#160;+&#160;1) contributions in the solvent phase, and showed how these interactions can be tuned through the choice of the substituent in the para&#8208;substituted phenolate nucleophiles. The resulting insights, consistent across both phases, facilitate steering future experiments in these and related S(VI) substitution reactions.

         <title>Hybridization on DNA&#8208;Coated Ultrasmall Gold Nanoparticles (2&#160;nm)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DNA&#8208;conjugated ultrasmall gold nanoparticles (2&#160;nm) hybridize with complementary DNA strands to form dimers. Covalent attachment via click chemistry preserves the DNA functionality, creating building blocks for supramolecular chemistry and controlled nanoparticle assembly.








Abstract
Ultrasmall gold nanoparticles were functionalized with covalently attached DNA strands of 20 or 30 nucleotides. This was achieved via click chemistry with alkyne&#8208;terminated DNA and azide&#8208;terminated gold nanoparticles. The particles were characterized by high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy, UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, and small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering. The DNA strands were fluorescently labelled with either FAM or Cy3, permitting their detection and quantification on the nanoparticle surface. Complementary DNA strands were attached to the nanoparticles via hybridization. The connection of gold nanoparticles by complementary DNA strands was also demonstrated. In&#8208;situ fluorescence spectroscopy confirmed the hybridization at ambient temperature and the melting of the DNA strands at elevated temperature. The hybridization was confirmed by fluorescence spectroscopy with the FRET effect. This opens broad possibilities for the noncovalent functionalization of ultrasmall nanoparticles.

         <title>Metal Chloride&#8208;Iodate Nonlinear Optical Materials via Direct Chlorination of Centrosymmetric Metal Iodate Crystals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new simple method that structural directing agents anion could effectively regulate the orientation of polar basic building units to achieve centrosymmetric to noncentrosymmetric transformation is presented. The resultant three excellent NLO crystals of crystals RbAl(IO3)3Cl, CsAl(IO3)3Cl, and CsGa(IO3)3Cl were discovered.








Abstract
Noncentrosymmetric (NCS) crystals may show many interesting and important physical properties and wide applications in science and technology but they are rare in contrast to centrosymmetric crystals. The development of NCS crystals from known centrosymmetric (CS) crystals is of fundamental and applied importance. Herein, a simple and effective strategy that by addition of appropriate diluted HCl into CS crystals to react directly was proposed for the reversal of the CS to NCS structure by utilizing the structural directing agents Cl&#8722; anion to break the symmetry and then to regulate orientation and arrangement of anionic moieties. The resultant a family of NCS iodates AM(IO3)3Cl (A&#160;=&#160;Rb, Cs; M&#160;=&#160;Al, Ga, Fe) were successfully developed via Cl&#8722; anion&#8208; induced transformation from parent CS A2M(IO3)4(H0.5IO3)2 and Cs2Fe(HIO3)(IO3)5. Remarkably, Al&#8208; and Ga&#8208;based compounds RbAl(IO3)3Cl, CsAl(IO3)3Cl, and CsGa(IO3)3Cl exhibit the strong second harmonic generation (SHG) responses (11.0&#8211;12.5&#160;&#215;&#160;KDP), large band&#8211;gaps (4.00&#8211;4.17&#160;eV), high laser damage thresholds (LDTs), wide transparent wavelength regions, and easiness of growing up large crystal. This work provides a new perspective to develop important NCS crystals from CS crystals.

         <title>Mechanisms of Chiral Induction to Foldamer Backbones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Helical foldamers are often built from achiral components and thus have no inherent bias to their twist sense. This review describes mechanisms for controlling their handedness using appended stereocenters. It examines how point chirality directs the twist sense through a combination of short&#8208;range interactions to the directly attached repeat unit and long&#8208;range interactions with groups farther along the backbone.








Abstract
Foldamers, oligomers that adopt well&#8208;defined conformations, represent an efficient strategy toward nanoscale structural complexity. While most foldamers fold into helices, many abiotic foldamers are built from achiral repeat units and therefore do not have a preferred twist sense. Their handedness can, however, be controlled by attaching groups with chirality centers to the foldamer backbone. This process allows chiral information from readily available compounds to be amplified into larger&#8208;scale structural asymmetry and translated into functional behavior. This review describes mechanisms whereby the point chirality of chiral &#8220;controller&#8221; groups directs foldamer twist sense. We highlight examples of aromatic oligoamides, oligohydrazides, oligoindoles, oligo(ortho&#8208;phenylenes), oligooxymethylenes, and oligo(aminoisobutyric acids), examining cases where the controller groups are attached at either the helices&#8217; termini or sides. Our emphasis is on applying intuitive concepts from conformational analysis and, where appropriate, computational modeling of small substructures. In each case, we consider first short&#8208;range interactions that orient the controller group relative to its direct point of attachment to the foldamer, and then its long&#8208;range interactions with more&#8208;distant parts of the oligomer. Together, these interactions allow the twist sense to be predicted (or at least rationalized). Understanding these mechanisms should facilitate the design of systems with dynamic control over helicity.

Understanding these mechanisms should facilitate the design of systems with dynamic control over helicity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Syntheses and Reactivity of Yb and Sm Inverse Sandwich Arene Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reactivity of inverse sandwich&#160;lanthanide benzene complexes depends strongly on the metal oxidation states and consequently, the charge on the bridging benzene anion. Whereas the YbII complex reacted as a 2e donor with biphenyl, naphthalene, anthracene and COT, the strongly bound SmIII complex only reacted with anthracene and COT. 








Abstract
Inverse sandwich arene complexes of rare earth metals have gained notable interest due to their unique electronic properties. In these complexes, an arene ligand bridges two metal centres, storing 0, 2, or 4 electrons, which is the basis for unique reactivity. Herein, we report on the reactivity of [(DIPePBDI)Ln]2(&#951;6,&#951;6&#8208;benzene) (II&#8208;Ln, Ln&#160;=&#160;Yb or Sm) and in situ reduced [(DIPePBDI)SmI]2 (V) (DIPePBDI&#160;=&#160;HC[C(Me)N&#8208;DIPeP]2, DIPeP&#160;=&#160;2,6&#8208;CHEt2&#8208;phenyl). The YbII&#8208;benzene2&#8722;&#8208;YbII complex (II&#8208;Yb) reacted smoothly with biphenyl, naphthalene, anthracene, and COT, giving a range of new YbII complexes with bridging arene or COT ligands. However, due to much stronger Sm&#8208;arene bonding in II&#8208;Sm, which should be regarded as a SmIII&#8208;benzene4&#8722;&#8208;SmIII complex, this reagent only reacted with substrates that can be reduced easily (anthracene and COT). Interestingly, reaction with anthracene gave a SmII&#8208;anthracene2&#8722;&#8208;SmII complex, showing that the benzene4&#8722; is able to reduce SmIII to SmII. In situ reduced [(DIPePBDI)SmI]2 (V) can be considered a (DIPePBDI)SmI synthon, which reacted smoothly with toluene, biphenyl, or 1,3,5&#8208;triphenyl&#8208;benzene and affords a series of SmIII&#8208;arene4&#8722;&#8208;SmIII complexes. However, reaction with pyrene gave an SmII&#8208;pyrene2&#8722;&#8208;SmII product. All complexes have been fully characterized with X&#8208;ray diffraction.

         <title>Pitch&#8208;derived Soft and Hard Carbon Materials for Practical Sodium&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides a comprehensive overview of pitch&#8208;based soft and hard carbons for sodium&#8208;ion batteries from a practical viewpoint. It covers their preparation, structure, sodium storage mechanisms, and applications, while also discussing critical points such as safety and volumetric energy density. From an industrial perspective, we analyze technical hurdles and propose that combining advanced characterization with artificial intelligence is key to clarifying structure&#8208;property relationships for practical application.








Abstract
Sodium&#8208;ion battery (SIB) shows great potential for large&#8208;scale energy storage, high&#8208;power and low&#8208;temperature supplies. Pitch is a promising precursor for preparing carbon anode materials for SIBs owing to its low cost, high carbon yield, and structural tunability. In this review, the preparation and application of pitch&#8208;derived soft&#8208; and hard&#8208;carbons for SIBs are discussed from a practical perspective. We first introduce the full&#8208;slope sodium storage behavior of soft carbon, mainly focused on the storage mechanism, high&#8208;rate feature, modification strategies, application scenario, and existing challenges. Thereafter, we present the preparation of pitch&#8208;derived hard carbon mainly through pre&#8208;oxidation and carbonization. The crucial influencing factors, including pitch property, pre&#8208;oxidation temperature, holding time, heating rate, atmosphere, and carbonization conditions, as well as the underlying mechanisms, are discussed. From scientific and industrial points of view, we also propose the challenges for application of pitch&#8208;derived carbon materials. Future efforts should be paid on clarifying the sodium storage mechanisms and electrochemical kinetics of carbon, revealing the screening criteria of pitch and the &#8220;preparation&#8208;structure&#8208;performance&#8221; relationships through a combination of experiments, artificial intelligence, and big data techniques. Material design and preparation guidance should be obtained to push forward pitch&#8208;based carbon for practical SIBs.

         <title>Moisture&#8208;enabled Electricity Generation From a Single&#8208;layer Composite CNT&#8208;Polymer Membrane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work focuses on the development of single&#8208;layer composite membranes containing a hydrophilic polymeric matrix enriched with various types of carbon nanotubes (single&#8208;, double&#8208;, and multi&#8208;walled CNTs), through an environmentally benign process. The membranes hold potential as low&#8208;budget and self&#8208;sustaining energy systems in the field of moisture&#8208;enabled electricity generators (MEGs).








Abstract
Clean and renewable power sources are crucial toward the development of sustainable energy technologies, to address the global energy demand. Moisture&#8208;enabled electricity generators (MEGs) have emerged as promising candidates to harness ambient low&#8208;grade energy stored in the humidity of the atmosphere. In this study, single&#8208;layer composite membranes were developed, consisting of a hydrophilic cross&#8208;linked polymeric matrix of sodium poly(4&#8208;styrene sulfonate&#8208;co&#8208;glycidyl methacrylate) (P(SSNa&#8208;co&#8208;GMA)) and polyacrylic acid (PAA), and incorporating various types of carbon nanotubes (single&#8208;, double&#8208;, and multi&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes). These composite membranes can spontaneously absorb humidity and display mixed conductivity in a range of relative humidity (RH) environments. The combination of high swelling capacity, hydrophilic surface, and interconnected nanoscale pathways facilitates the formation of a strong ion concentration gradient under humid conditions, leading to higher and more stable voltage output. For example, MEGs based on MWCNTs reaches &#8764;0.65&#160;V. These findings indicate the importance of fine&#8208;tuned morphology and nanotube dispersion in designing efficient MEG devices, as low&#8208;cost and self&#8208;sustaining energy systems.

         <title>Biodegradation of Benzene&#8208;Dicarboxylic Acid Ester Isomers by a Thermally Activated Esterase from Desulfurellaceae Bacterium</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The newly identified esterase DeEst catalyzes the hydrolysis of three regioisomers of benzene&#8208;dicarboxylic acid esters. In particular, phthalic acid esters (PAEs) can be converted into phthalic acid (PA). DeEst exhibits thermostability and an uncommon thermal activation effect.








Abstract
Esterases play a crucial role in the degradation of phthalic acid esters (PAEs), the common persistent organic pollutants and endocrine disrupting chemicals. However, only a few esterases for PAEs degradation have been characterized. In this study, a novel esterase from Desulfurellaceae bacterium (DeEst) has been identified. We found its hydrolytic activity toward three regioisomers of benzene&#8208;dicarboxylic acid esters (i.e., diethyl phthalate, diethyl isophthalate, and diethyl terephthalate). Notably, DeEst is capable of hydrolyzing diethyl phthalate and other PAEs to phthalic acid (PA). The biochemical characterization of DeEst was also investigated. DeEst exhibited strong thermal stability and demonstrated an uncommon thermal activation effect, highlighting its considerable potential for practical applications.

Abstract
The efficient binding of receptors Lk (Lk&#160;=&#160;L5&#8208;L8) to [Eu(hfac)3] (H&#8208;hfac&#160;=&#160;1,1,1,5,5,5&#8208;hexafluoropentane&#8208;2,4&#8208;dione) allows (i) to gather the basic unit&#8208;containing tridentate ligands Lk and the acidic unit&#8208;bearing bidentate hfac&#8722; co&#8208;ligands into a stable single molecular [LkEu(hfac)3] adduct working as a catalyst for Michael C&#9472;C bond formations, (ii) to enhance the acidity of the N&#8208;H units connected to the benzimidazole side arms of the bound ligands L5 and L7, and (iii) to reorganize their geometries into cis&#8208;cis conformation for activating Michael substrates 1 and 2 through H&#8208;bonding interactions on the second&#8208;sphere coordination to provide the target product 3 (up to 92% yield). A maximum enantiomeric excess of 21% could be achieved due to the long distance between the chiral sources and the catalytic sites in the europium complexes. Stepwise distortions from planarity of the terdentate Lk ligands in the yttrium complexes [LkY(hfac)3] (Lk&#160;=&#160;L2, L3, and L5&#8208;L10) can be tuned by addition of specific substituent into the benzimidazole side arms, thus realizing some control over their dual fluorescence and phosphorescence emission properties. All [LkEu(hfac)3] (Lk&#160;=&#160;L2, L3, and L5&#8208;L10) complexes display europium&#8208;centered photoluminescence properties induced by the antenna effect and modulated by the specific design of the light&#8208;harvesting aromatic ligand located in the first coordination sphere.

         <title>Enantioselective Desymmetrization by Chiral Bifunctional H&#8208;Bonding Organocatalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enantioselective desymmetrization has emerged as a highly efficient and conceptually elegant strategy for the construction of chiral molecules from readily available prochiral substrates. This review focuses on recent developments in organocatalytic desymmetrization reactions, with particular emphasis on approaches involving bifunctional activation through hydrogen bonding.








Abstract
Enantioselective desymmetrization has emerged as an effective method for generating highly enriched chiral molecules from achiral compounds. In recent years, organocatalysis has played an increasingly prominent role in this field, offering metal&#8208;free and environmentally benign alternatives to traditional asymmetric catalysis. This review focuses on organocatalytic approaches in desymmetrization reactions that utilize bifunctional hydrogen activation of the substrate by a chiral organocatalyst. The most common types of chiral bifunctional organocatalysts include cinchona alkaloids and their derivatives, such as thioureas, sulfonamides, and squaramides. The following text provides an overview of the enantioselective desymmetrization methods that have been described to date for meso&#8208;anhydrides, meso&#8208;diols, amines, small heterocyclic rings, and various carbonyl compound derivatives.

         <title>Tailoring Pore Size in Anionic MOFs Toward Enhanced Selective Adsorption of Organic Dye Pollutants</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The pore size of MOFs can be successfully adjusted by altering the solvent and temperature of the reaction. The adsorption isotherm results of the cationic dye methylene blue show that the maximum adsorption capacity of the optimized MOF increased by approximately 2.45 times.








Abstract
Organic dye pollutants pose a serious threat to ecosystems and human health, whereas there still exist challenges in efficient and selective adsorption of them due to the difficulty in structure tunability of traditional adsorption materials. Based on the tailorable pore structure of anionic metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), the pore size can be optimized to match the dye molecules through a solvothermal control strategy, thereby achieving efficient adsorption. Herein, the pore size of anionic MOFs was modulated by varying solvents and temperature, facilitating high&#8208;performance selective adsorption of cationic dye via a large&#8208;pore size effect. The optimized MOF (Bio&#8208;MOF&#8208;100) of large pore size achieved a methylene blue adsorption capacity is high to 443.01&#160;mg/g, which is approximately 2.45 times higher than that of the MOF (Bio&#8208;MOF&#8208;1) before pore regulation. Using a mixed matrix membrane (MMM) strategy, the optimized MOF was mixed with polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) to form a membrane. The membrane is not only portable and recyclable, but also inherits the characteristics of MOFs, enabling selective adsorption of cationic dyes. Its maximum adsorption capacity for methylene blue is 141.78&#160;mg/g. These results provide an example for the design and utility of largely&#8208;pore MOFs for targeted pollutants adsorption.

         <title>Low&#8208; Temperature Transformations in Amorphous Silica Bilayers on Ru(0001) After Crystal&#8208;Glass Transition: Closer Look</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work we report on the ring opening of the silica film as studied by fast&#8208;scanning scanning tunneling microscopy together with density functional calculations. The results reveal the influence of the metal support on the transformation energetics.








Abstract
The crystal&#8208;glass transition concerning silicon dioxide has been a topic of intense research. It has been possible to prepare a bilayer silica film on a metal substrate and study the corresponding transition in real space using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). While the initial trigger of the transition has been identified as a so&#8208;called Stone&#8211;Wales ring&#8208;opening process, which requires rather high energies/temperatures, a question has been, whether there are similar follow&#8208;up processes, which require much less energy and thus rather moderate temperatures. Although observations have been reported using electron microscopy, it remains unclear whether, in this case, the modifications were initiated by the measurement itself. Here, we report on a fast&#8208;scanning STM study, allowing a study in real space and indicating structural transformations at room temperature. The experimental results are supported by demanding density functional calculations, which allow for an understanding of the involved ring structure modifying processes. The calculations also reveal the influence of the metal support on the transformation energetics.

The graphical abstract summarizes the review &#8220;Pd(II)&#8208;Catalyzed Strategies for the &#946;&#8208;Arylation of &#945;&#8208;Amino Acids: An Overview&#8221;, highlighting representative Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed methods for the &#946;&#8208;arylation of &#945;&#8208;amino acids. Key mechanistic features, substrate diversity, and synthetic relevance of these transformations are showcased.








Abstract
Metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#9472;H activation has been linked to amino acids for decades. Peptides and &#945;$\alpha $&#8208;amino acids (&#945;&#8208;AAs) have been used as substrates, directing groups (DGs) and ligands, significantly expanding and broadening the definition of metallo&#8208; and organo&#8208;catalysis. This mini&#8208;review focuses on strategies for &#946;&#8208;arylation of &#945;&#8208;AAs involving Pd(II)&#8208;mediated activation of the &#946;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8208;H sigma bond. After a brief introduction in Section 1, strategies exploiting auxiliary bidentate DGs to address the Pd(II)&#8208;mediated C&#9472;H activation are discussed in Section 2. The related Ligand&#8208;controlled processes are treated in Section 3 and Section 4 highlight the most recent atom&#8208;economic developments in peptide late&#8208;stage functionalization (LSF) proceeding via Pd(II)&#8208;mediated &#946;&#8208;C(sp3)&#8208;H activation of a precise &#945;$\alpha $&#8208;AA residue along the peptide sequence.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metal-catalyzed C&#9472;H activation has been linked to amino acids for decades. Peptides and &#945;$\alpha $-amino acids (&#945;-AAs) have been used as substrates, directing groups (DGs) and ligands, significantly expanding and broadening the definition of metallo- and organo-catalysis. This mini-review focuses on strategies for &#946;-arylation of &#945;-AAs involving Pd(II)-mediated activation of the &#946;-C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)-H sigma bond. After a brief introduction in Section 1, strategies exploiting auxiliary bidentate DGs to address the Pd(II)-mediated C&#9472;H activation are discussed in Section 2. The related Ligand-controlled processes are treated in Section 3 and Section 4 highlight the most recent atom-economic developments in peptide late-stage functionalization (LSF) proceeding &lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; Pd(II)-mediated &#946;-C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)-H activation of a precise &#945;$\alpha $-AA residue along the peptide sequence.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enantioselective Catalytic 1,2&#8208;Benzoxazolyl Migration for Tertiary &#945;&#8208;Hydroxy Ester Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral Lewis acid and bifunctional squaramide&#8208;catalyzed enantioconvergent benzilic ester rearrangement of &#945;&#8208;diketones has been developed, enabling the construction of optically active tertiary &#945;&#8208;hydroxy esters with high enantioselectivity and functional group versatility, along with the synthesis of a novel chiral Boox ligand for asymmetric electrocatalysis, while DFT calculations elucidated the hemiketal&#8208;initiated mechanism and key transition states governing enantioselectivity.








Abstract
Asymmetric catalytic rearrangement, particularly the enantioselective benzilic ester rearrangement of &#945;&#8208;diketones, represents a potent synthetic tool for cleaving C&#9472;C bonds to generate optically active tertiary &#945;&#8208;hydroxy esters. However, enantioselective benzilic ester rearrangement involving a 1,2&#8208;heterocycle shift presents significant challenges owing to inadequate enantiomeric differentiation and steric hindrance associated with tertiary alcohols. In this study, we employed chiral Lewis acid and bifunctional squaramide catalysts for enantioconvergent benzilic ester rearrangement, achieving high enantioselectivity in the construction of tertiary alcohols with chemically versatile functional groups and the synthesis of a novel chiral benzoxazole&#8211;oxazoline (Boox) ligand for asymmetric electrocatalysis. DFT calculations elucidated a hemiketal&#8208;initiated reaction mechanism, pivotal 1,2&#8208;heterocycle shift transition states, and catalytic interactions that govern the increased enantioselectivity of the enantioconvergent benzilic ester rearrangement, furnishing crucial insights into the underlying mechanism.

         <title>Double&#8208;Network Soy Protein Adhesives with Enhanced Water Retention and Bonding Strength</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hierarchical dual&#8208;network soy protein adhesive combines chitosan's compliant supramolecular network (hydrogen bonding/electrostatic interactions) for 430% enhanced precure water retention with a stiff covalent crosslinked network formed during curing for 445% improved postcure bonding strength, successfully resolving the traditional trade&#8208;off between these properties in bio&#8208;based adhesives.








Abstract
Developing soy protein adhesives with high water retention and strong bonding strength is essential. Such materials can serve as a sustainable alternative to petroleum&#8208;based formaldehyde adhesives in wood panel manufacturing. However, a trade&#8208;off between precure water retention and postcure bonding strength remains a major challenge, and current strategies rarely achieve simultaneous enhancement of both properties. Inspired by the multi&#8208;enhancement mechanisms of double&#8209;network systems, we established a hierarchical dual&#8209;network adhesive system. It involves the self&#8208;assembly of chitosan into a compliant supramolecular framework via dynamic hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions, along with the additional formation of a stiff covalent crosslinked network during curing. This design achieves synergistic optimization of water retention and bonding strength. The &#8220;skeleton&#8211;tentacle&#8221; structure formed by functionalized chitosan significantly enhanced water retention by 430% and was crucial to forming the dual&#8208;network structure, improving wet shear strength by 445% and work of adhesion by 2133%. Additionally, the adhesive exhibited excellent mildew resistance and flame retardancy. The global warming potential was only 1.4&#160;kg CO2 eq, significantly lower than urea&#8211;formaldehyde and phenol&#8211;formaldehyde resins. This design provides a novel approach for developing high&#8208;performance bio&#8208;based adhesives and is expected to advance its practical application.

         <title>Variability of a Non&#8208;Centrosymmetric Tecto&#8208;Borosulfate: Introduction of Various Molecular Cations into BiX[B(SO4)2]4 (X&#160; = &#160;H3O+, NO2+, NH4+, NO+)</title>

         <dc:description>
To date, Bi(H3O)[B(SO)2]4 is only the second structure type containing a 3D anion within borosulfate chemistry. In this contribution three more representatives were synthesized, formally replacing oxonium by the molecular cations nitrosonium, nitronium, and ammonium. The structures crystallize homeotypically to the very first compound. A careful adjustment of the educts even allows mixed representatives.








Abstract
Although the number of borosulfates increased strongly over the past years, structures comprising a 3D anionic framework are still scarce. Herein, with BiX[B(SO4)2]4 (X&#160; = &#160;NH4+, NO2+, NO+) we present three new representatives. The bismuth borosulfates were synthesized under solvothermal condition and crystallize homeotypically to Bi(H3O)[B(SO4)2]4 in the tetragonal space group I4&#175;$\bar 4$ (Nr.82) (a&#160;=&#160;11.827(6) &#8211; 11.908(1) &#197;, c&#160;=&#160;8.1160(2) &#8211; 8.1315(6) &#197;, Z&#160;=&#160;2). Via all vertices connected BS4 supertetrahedra reveal a zeolite type like structure like its found for the tectosilicate K1.14[Mg0.57Si1.43O4] emphasizing their close relationship. Underlining the weak coordination behavior, for the first&#8208;time nitrosonium and nitrosylium cations are introduced into borosulfate chemistry. SHG measurements confirm the absence of an inversion center and show a nonlinear optical response with intensities up to 1.4 times higher than KDP. Furthermore, the titled compounds were characterized thoroughly by both single&#8208;crystal and powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, infrared spectroscopy, density functional theory (DFT) calculations, and thermal analysis.

         <title>Cyclopenta&#8208;Fused Polyaromatic Hydrocarbon (CP&#8208;PAH) Radicals: Synthesis, Characterization, and Quantum Chemical Calculations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Extending the &#960; system of a fully conjugated framework composed of alternating five&#8208; and six&#8208;membered rings led to further rare examples of bench&#8208;stable carbon&#8208;centered hydrocarbon radicals. Spectroscopic analysis allowed extensive characterization, which was further supported by computational methods.








Abstract
Two air&#8208; and moisture&#8208;stable cyclopenta&#8208;fused polyaromatic hydrocarbon (CP&#8208;PAH) radicals with six six&#8208; and three five&#8208;membered rings alternately fused to nonacycles were obtained by ortho fusion in suitably ortho,ortho&#8217;&#8208;substituted dinaphthylfluorenes and subsequent establishment of the conjugation. The radicals were obtained in five consecutive steps with total yields of 38 and 16%, respectively; key steps are Suzuki couplings and cyclizing SEAr reactions. Mesityl substituents at the five&#8208;membered rings ensure the kinetic stability of the radicals. They were characterized by EPR and UV/Vis spectroscopy. Quantum chemical calculations led to simulated UV/Vis/NIR spectra and disclosed further properties like spin densities, aromaticity, and orbital energies. Both radicals are best described with the unpaired electron centered in the outer five&#8208;membered rings. The respective resonance formulas show the largest number of fully intact benzene rings. A possible triradical character was computed to be small in both compounds. The five&#8208;membered rings, especially the central rings show significant antiaromatic character.

         <title>An Improved Cysteine&#8208;Based Labeling Strategy for GPCR Structural Dynamics Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a strategy to achieve high specificity cysteine&#8208;based labeling of GPCRs by employing phenylarsine oxide to reversibly protect extracellular labile disulfides. This method efficiently reduces nonspecific labeling and enables receptor sample preparations with controllable disulfide redox states, facilitating further spectroscopic studies on GPCR structural dynamics.








Abstract
Spectroscopic investigations of the dynamic signaling process of G protein&#8208;coupled receptors (GPCRs) often require cysteine&#8208;based labeling. However, the presence of a highly conserved but labile disulfide bond in the receptor extracellular domain could result in strong background signals, hindering the application of spectroscopic methods in studying GPCR dynamics. Herein we report an improved strategy for site&#8208;specific labeling of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors by using phenylarsine oxide (PAO) to reversibly protect the conserved disulfide bond. This method can efficiently reduce background signals while maintaining receptor functionality, enabling both fluorophore and 19F labeling for structural dynamics studies of the M2 muscarinic receptor (M2R) by single&#8208;molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) and 19F nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). This improved strategy is anticipated to broaden the applicability of cysteine&#8208;based spectroscopic methods for structural dynamics studies of a wider range of GPCRs facing similar challenges.

         <title>Unraveling an Organic Soluble Precursor&#8208;Based Low&#8208;Temperature Synthetic Strategy to Impurity&#8208;Free Pristine and Transition Metal Doped Lead Apatites</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a mild, one&#8208;step, low&#8208;temperature hydrothermal synthesis of lead hydroxyapatite (Pb&#8208;HA) and transition&#8208;metal&#8208;doped Pb&#8208;HA using [Pb(&#956;&#8208;dtbp)2]n as the molecular precursor. This method prevents impurity formation, ensures selectivity, and yields paramagnetic TM&#8208;doped Pb&#8208;HA, offering a more efficient alternative to existing approaches.








Abstract
Doping of hydroxyapatites has garnered considerable interest, as it enables the tuning of the material's intrinsic properties. However, synthesizing hydroxyapatites and their doped variants is highly challenging, as the synthesis demands high temperature and complex, multi&#8208;step reaction conditions. Hence, we propose a soft, one&#8208;step synthetic approach to develop single&#8208;phase lead hydroxyapatite (Pb&#8208;HA), Pb10(PO4)6(OH)2, and transition metal&#8208;doped lead hydroxyapatites (TM&#8208;doped Pb&#8208;HA), Pb10&#8208;xMx(PO4)6(OH)2 (x &#8771; 0.5 to 1.0) (M&#160;=&#160;Cu, Co, or Mn) through a low&#8208;temperature hydrothermal decomposition route under neutral conditions. A newly synthesized 1D lead phosphate polymer [Pb(&#956;&#8208;dtbp)2]n (1) (dtbp&#160;=&#160;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphosphate) has been used as the metal&#8208;organic precursor for different lead phosphate phases by employing both solvothermal and solid&#8208;state thermal decomposition pathways. Hydrothermal decomposition of 1 in the presence of required stoichiometric amounts of an additional lead precursor, PbO, and transition phosphates/metal oxides (MO) at 140 &#176;C gave phase&#8208;pure Pb&#8208;HA and TM&#8208;doped Pb&#8208;HA. The associated magnetic and electronic property analysis revealed that all the synthesized materials display paramagnetic behavior, and they are wide&#8208;gap n&#8208;type semiconductors. More pertinently, this mild, versatile route offers improved control over the metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand ratio compared to existing methods and can be adapted to introduce other divalent transition metals into hydroxyapatite frameworks.

         <title>Glutathione&#8208;Triggered Nitrite Release From Organic Nitrites Enhances Nitric Oxide Bioavailability in Mammalian Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study provides a three&#8208;in&#8208;one strategy for the generation of nitrite under physiological conditions, measurement of glutathione levels, and determination of the relative amounts of nitric oxide derived from endogenous and exogenous sources.








Abstract
The conversion of nitrite (NO2&#8722;) to nitric oxide (NO) represents a key pathway for NO generation under ischemic conditions. Therefore, organic nitro compounds capable of releasing nitrite under physiological environments have attracted considerable attention. Here, we demonstrate that simple 4&#8208;nitro&#8208;1,8&#8208;naphthalimide derivatives efficiently and almost quantitatively liberate nitrite upon reaction with biological thiols, particularly glutathione (GSH). These compounds function as NO prodrugs, enhancing NO bioavailability in mammalian cells through intracellular nitrite&#8211;to&#8211;NO conversion. Notably, their selectivity toward GSH and the intrinsic fluorescence of the resulting glutathione adducts enable their use as probes for monitoring intracellular GSH levels. Furthermore, cotreatment of endothelial cells with these naphthalimide derivatives and the NO probe DAF&#8208;FM diacetate provides a valuable strategy to distinguish between endogenously produced NO and NO generated via synthetic nitro compound&#8211;derived nitrite release. Together, these findings highlight 4&#8208;nitro&#8208;1,8&#8208;naphthalimides as a promising platform for both NO delivery and real&#8208;time cellular redox sensing.

         <title>Shedding Light on Synthetic Autocatalysis: From Conventional Closed&#8208;Shell Chemistries to Overlooked Open&#8208;Shell Occurrences</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Why add another catalyst when the product itself holds the power to catalyze its own formation? Autocatalysis in synthetic chemistry enhances reaction efficiency and uncovers novel catalytic behavior across both closed&#8208;shell and open&#8208;shell systems, expanding reactivity and enabling innovative design strategies.








Abstract
Autocatalysis is a kinetic phenomenon where a reaction product catalyzes its own formation, often leading to sigmoidal reaction profiles and exponential rate acceleration. This process plays a fundamental role in biological systems, for example, in chemistry of the origins of life. Although synthetic reactions are not as widely reported as the biological studies, autocatalysis offers a unique mechanism and high efficiency to organic synthesis. This review highlights diverse synthetic examples in various autocatalytic mechanistic paradigms, including well&#8208;studied examples such as the Soai reaction. We also explore emerging examples in radical&#8208; and photochemistry&#8208;based systems, emphasizing recent advances in auto&#8208;photocatalysis. By exploring examples from different fields, this review aims to highlight the variety and potential of autocatalytic reactions for synthesis. We aim to encourage further research into autocatalysis as a powerful strategy for improving reaction efficiency, revealing new reaction pathways, and inspiring innovative catalytic methodologies.

         <title>Water&#8208;Soluble Squaraine&#8208;Based NIR Chromofluorogenic Probe for HClO/ClO&#8722; Detection in Environmental Waters and Live&#8208;Cell Bioimaging</title>

         <dc:description>
A near&#8208;infrared (696/725&#160;nm), water&#8208;soluble squaraine dye SO3SQ was presented for the chromofluorogenic detection of HClO/ClO&#8722;. SO3SQ detects HClO/ClO&#8722; in 100% PBS system and exhibits visible colorimetric change, high selectivity, pH&#8208;independence and negligible cytotoxicity. SO3SQ is successfully used to detect HClO/ClO&#8722; in environmental water and enables fluorescence imaging of exogenous/endogenous HClO/ClO&#8722; in live HepG2 cells.








Abstract
Hypochlorous acid/hypochlorite (HClO/ClO&#8722;), as critical biological reactive oxygen species (ROS), plays essential roles in numerous physiological and pathological processes. To enable sensitive detection of HClO/ClO&#8722; in environmental water samples and living cells, a near&#8208;infrared (NIR) water&#8208;soluble squaraine&#8208;based chromofluorogenic probe SO3SQ was developed. SO3SQ exhibits good water solubility, NIR detection wavelength (696&#160;nm/725&#160;nm), high selectivity, rapid response time (within seconds), visible colorimetric response, and minimal cytotoxicity. Furthermore, SO3SQ achieved quantitative HClO/ClO&#8722; detection in environmental water samples and realized real&#8208;time fluorescence imaging of exogenous/endogenous HClO/ClO&#8722; in HepG2 cells. This work provides new ideas for the future design of NIR water&#8208;soluble HClO/ClO&#8722; probes, while expanding the application of squaraine dyes as HClO/ClO&#8722; probes.

SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;SQ detects HClO/ClO&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; in 100% PBS system and exhibits visible colorimetric change, high selectivity, pH-independence and negligible cytotoxicity. SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;SQ is successfully used to detect HClO/ClO&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; in environmental water and enables fluorescence imaging of exogenous/endogenous HClO/ClO&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; in live HepG2 cells.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hypochlorous acid/hypochlorite (HClO/ClO&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;), as critical biological reactive oxygen species (ROS), plays essential roles in numerous physiological and pathological processes. To enable sensitive detection of HClO/ClO&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; in environmental water samples and living cells, a near-infrared (NIR) water-soluble squaraine-based chromofluorogenic probe SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;SQ was developed. SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;SQ exhibits good water solubility, NIR detection wavelength (696&#160;nm/725&#160;nm), high selectivity, rapid response time (within seconds), visible colorimetric response, and minimal cytotoxicity. Furthermore, SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;SQ achieved quantitative HClO/ClO&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; detection in environmental water samples and realized real-time fluorescence imaging of exogenous/endogenous HClO/ClO&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; in HepG2 cells. This work provides new ideas for the future design of NIR water-soluble HClO/ClO&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; probes, while expanding the application of squaraine dyes as HClO/ClO&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; probes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Modular Assembly of Macrocyclic Sulfonamides via Consecutive Cascade Ring Expansion Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methods for the efficient synthesis of macrocyclic sulfur(IV) compounds are rare. In this manuscript, a versatile strategy for the synthesis of macrocyclic sulfonamides is described using a modular three&#8208;stage protocol, including two consecutive cascade ring expansion reactions. The utility of this modular approach is showcased via the synthesis of a library of 42 diversely functionalized 13&#8208; and 14&#8208;membered macrocyclic sulfonamides.








Abstract
Sulfur(IV) groups and macrocycles are both important motifs in bioactive molecules of significant current interest in medicinal chemistry, but methods for the efficient synthesis of macrocyclic sulfur(IV) compounds are rare. In this manuscript, a modular, versatile strategy for the synthesis of macrocyclic sulfonamides is described, using consecutive ring expansion reactions. First, linear starting materials are assembled from simple building blocks. This is followed by two distinct cascade ring expansion reaction steps performed in sequence. The utility of this modular approach is showcased via the synthesis of a library of 42 diversely functionalized 13&#8208; and 14&#8208;membered macrocyclic sulfonamides. The use of consecutive ring expansions is key to the success of the protocol, ensuring the products are formed in overall good yields without requiring high&#8208;dilution conditions.

         <title>A [3]Rotaxane Containing {Ti7Ga} Rings Linking CuII: Synthesis, Structure, and Spectroscopic Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Extended hybrid inorganic&#8208;organic [2]&#8208; and [3]&#8208;rotaxanes are reported based on heterometallic rings with threads that link CuII complexes; the crystal structures are reported, and the solution behavior is investigated by double electron electron resonance spectroscopy methods.








Abstract
We report the synthesis of extended hybrid organic&#8208;inorganic rotaxanes based on (pyCH2NH2CH2CH2py)[TiIV7GaIIIO8(O2CtBu)16] (1) and (pyCH2NH2CH2py)[TiIV7GaIIIO8(O2CtBu)16] (3) building blocks, containing an anionic macrocycle and doubly pyridyl&#8208;terminated secondary ammonium threads. Reaction of 1 and 3 with [Cu(hfac)2] (hfac&#160;=&#160;1,1,1,5,5,5&#8208;hexafluoroacetylacetonate) gives {[Cu(hfac)2]3[1]2} (2) and {[Cu(hfac)2]2[3]} (4), respectively, which are characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography. The products are controlled by the differing steric demands imposed by the two arms of the thread. The structure of 2 is an extended [3]rotaxane, with two molecules of 1 binding to a central [Cu(hfac)2] molecule via the longer arm of the thread, and two [Cu(hfac)2] units terminating the structure at the shorter arm. The structure of 4, where both arms of the thread are short, is an extended [2]rotaxane terminated by two molecules of [Cu(hfac)2]. The Cu&#8230;Cu&#8230;Cu fragment in 2 is linear, with the central Cu lying on an inversion center and with a separation between the terminal copper ions of 31.3&#160;&#197;. Double Electron&#8208;Electron Resonance (DEER; also known as PELDOR) spectroscopy proves that the [3]rotaxane structure remains intact in solution, detecting both terminal&#8230;center and terminal&#8230;terminal Cu&#8230;Cu interactions, with orientation&#8208;selective measurements demonstrating that there is a rearrangement of the structure at the terminal positions on dissolution.

         <title>Unraveling the Ruthenium(VIII)&#8208;Mediated Oxidation of N&#8208;Hydroxy Pyrrolidines to Cyclic Nitrones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The oxidation of N&#8208;hydroxy pyrrolidines to cyclic nitrones with ruthenium tetroxide proceeds via a concerted mechanism with a defined two&#8208;electron transfer direction. In 3&#8208;substituted derivatives, regioselectivity is mainly controlled by the steric hindrance of the substituent. Radical or stepwise pathways are ruled out by calculations.








Abstract
The oxidation of N&#8208;hydroxypyrrolidines to cyclic nitrones represents a valuable transformation in organic synthesis due to the synthetic utility of such nitrones. In this work, we present a detailed computational study of the oxidation of five&#8208;membered N&#8208;hydroxylamines using ruthenium tetroxide. Through density functional theory (DFT) calculations complemented by topological analyses of the electron localization function (ELF), we reveal a concerted yet highly asynchronous two&#8208;electron transfer mechanism. No intermediates as energy minima are identified, but the reaction trajectory lies near the borderline between stepwise and concerted pathways. Our findings indicate that regioselectivity in the oxidation process does not correlate with the electronic nature of the substituent at position 3, but is instead governed by steric hindrance effects that modulate the approach of the ruthenium tetroxide moiety. This steric control provides a rational explanation for the modest regioselectivity observed experimentally. Notably, the computational predictions align closely with experimental product distributions, lending strong support to the proposed mechanistic model.

         <title>Balgacyclamide A: Structural Revision of the First Reported Total Synthesis and Evaluation of Oxazoline Synthesis via &#946;&#8208;Hydroxy Amides Dehydrative Cyclization Conditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synthetic pathway for balgacyclamide A has been developed over 21 synthetic steps with an overall 5% yield. In this route, the absolute stereochemistry via the dehydrative cyclization is established, which helps to shed insight into errors within a previous groups claim of the total synthesis of balgacyclamide A. An epimer was also constructed to further our route via the dehydrative cyclization.








Abstract
A total synthesis of balgacyclamide A was reported for the first time in 2020, however, after multiple epimerization studies of &#946;&#8208;hydroxy amides dehydrative cyclization to access oxazolines, we proposed a configurational reassignment from the previous synthetic pathway. Balgacyclamide A is a macrocyclic hexapeptide with antiparasitic activity against Plasmodium falciparum and Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense. Chemically, its core contains six amino acids that undergo heterocyclization to form one thiazole and two oxazoline rings. Two of the six amino acids are L&#8208;threonines that play an important role in their synthetic pathway to achieve oxazolines with the right configuration upon epimerization at the &#946;&#8208;carbon. Thus, we investigated the effect of L&#8208;threonine and L&#8208;allothreonine &#946;&#8208;carbon epimerization via the Burgess reagent, diethylaminosulfur trifluoride (DAST), and (NH4)6Mo7O24&#8226;4H2O catalyst to support previous oxazoline synthetic studies. Furthermore, the first total synthesis of balgacyclamide A and an epimer is reported via multiple synthetic key steps that involve a tandem sulfur incorporation, cyclization, and aromatization of the thiazole, and a late&#8208;stage &#946;&#8208;hydroxy amide Walden inversion to access both oxazolines.

A quinonoidal dipyrrolyldiketone boron complex with an orthogonally arranged catechol unit in the dianionic form exhibited diradical properties, as observed from the singlet&#8211;triplet energy gaps (&#916;EST) that were modulated by coexisting countercations. &#916;EST values were controlled by the bridging boron moieties in the dianion diradicals.








Abstract
A quinonoidal dipyrrolyldiketone catecholate&#8208;boron complex, with two pyrrole&#8208;quinonemethide moieties bridged by a six&#8208;membered cross&#8208;conjugated unit, was synthesized to modulate the diradical character of the dianion formed upon deprotonation. The dianionic species exhibited near&#8208;infrared absorption and electron spin resonance (ESR) signals, confirming the diradical properties. Variable&#8208;temperature (VT) ESR spectra suggest the thermal excitation from the ground&#8208;state singlet diradical to the triplet diradical, providing singlet&#8211;triplet energy gaps modulated by coexisting cations and bridging boron moieties.

         <title>Enhanced Ring&#8208;Opening Efficiency of Fluorescence Photochromic Switches Based on Benzo[e]&#8208;Fused Dimethyldihydropyrene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorophore&#8208;BDHP conjugates demonstrate enhanced visible&#8208;light photoswitching through effective energy transfer. These robust molecular switches also operate in polymer thin film, facilitating solid&#8208;matrix photoisomerization. The strategy provides a flexible platform for advanced photonic and optoelectronic applications.








Abstract
Fluorophores have a significant impact on the photoswitching efficiency of photochromic systems such as azobenzene, dithienylethene, and spiropyrans by facilitating energy transfer processes that modulate the photoisomerization dynamics. In this study, we investigate the effect of side&#8208;chain functionalization of benzo[e]&#8208;fused dimethyldihydropyrene (BDHP) photochromic system with carefully selected fluorophores, namely anthracene and coumarin, on the ring&#8208;opening photoisomerization efficiency to the corresponding cyclophanediene (BCPD) form. The corresponding phenyl and naphthyl derivatives and the unsubstituted parent BDHP were studied as controls. Comprehensive photophysical analyses, including absorption and emission spectroscopy, along with quantum yield measurements, demonstrate efficient energy transfer from the attached fluorophores to the BDHP core, leading to an enhanced BDHP&#8594;BCPD isomerization process. This energy transfer mechanism significantly enhances the photoisomerization efficiency, resulting in more than a twofold increase in the ring&#8208;opening quantum yield compared to the nonfunctionalized BDHP controls. Additionally, the efficiency of photoisomerization of the coumarin&#8208;substituted derivative was extended in the switching studies in embedded solid polymeric matrices with efficient reversible photoisomerization, photostability over multiple switching cycles, and an all&#8208;optical logic gate. These findings demonstrate a promising strategy to improve the performance of the BDHP photochromic systems and their potential applications in molecular logic devices in thin film.

         <title>Coal&#8208;Derived Carbon Support Regulates Interfacial Water Molecules toward Enhanced Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution on Platinum Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Increasing interfacial free H2O accelerates the alkaline HER, yet simple and effective methods remain scarce. This work shows that carbonyl and carboxyl groups on carbon supports greatly increase the ratio of free H2O via forming local hydrogen bondings. Consequently, a functional support derived from bituminous coal renders Pt with high activity and stability.








Abstract
Carbon&#8208;supported platinum (Pt) nanoparticles (NPs) are efficient electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) but suffer from suboptimal kinetics in alkaline media. While restructuring interfacial water molecules offers a promising route to enhance alkaline HER, simple and effective strategies remain scarce. Here, we prepared Pt NPs on different carbon supports with varied compositions of oxygen&#8208;containing functional groups (OFGs) and explored the correlation between the HER activity and the OFG composition. Structural analyses confirm negligible effects of the support on the morphology, size, or electronic states of Pt NPs. However, in situ Raman spectroscopy reveals that OFGs, including carbonyl (C&#160;=&#160;O) and carboxyl (COOH) groups increase the proportion of interfacial free water molecules by reorganizing local hydrogen bonding. Meanwhile, a bituminous coal&#8208;derived carbon (bitu@C), featuring abundant OFGs, was developed as a functional support for Pt NPs. The Pt/bitu@C catalyst achieves a mass activity of 1.33 A mgpt&#8722;1 at an overpotential of 100&#160;mV, significantly outperforming commercial carbon&#8208;supported counterparts, while exhibiting enhanced stability. This work highlights the critical role of OFGs in modulating water structures and provides a practical, coal&#8208;derived platform for engineering interfacial water molecules toward efficient alkaline HER kinetics.

         <title>Photoinduced Electron Transfer (PET) as Key to Accelerate the Cycloreversion Reaction of Arylquadricyclanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is demonstrated that the photoinduced cycloreversion of a methoxynaphthylquadricyclane in the presence of suitable photocatalysts gives quantitatively the corresponding norbornadiene. As this photochromic norbornadiene&#8208;quadricyclane cycle has favorable properties for light energy conversion, this method provides a useful tool for the targeted release of stored energy with high temporal and local control.








Abstract
The development of methods for the utilization of sustainable energy resources is an important scientific challenge. In one approach, the conversion and storage of solar light energy as chemical energy in a photoreaction has been established, namely as molecular solar thermal energy storage (MOST). In particular, the norbornadiene&#8208;quadricyclane system offers favorable photochemical and physicochemical properties for this purpose. However, the chemical reaction to release the stored energy, i.e., the cycloreversion of the quadricyclane, still requires improvement. In this context, we demonstrate that a fast and controlled cycloreversion of 2&#8208;(5&#8208;(1&#8208;methoxynaphthyl))quadricyclane can be accomplished in a photoinduced electron transfer (PET) reaction. Specifically, we identified 9&#8208;mesityl&#8208;10&#8208;methylacridinium, 9,10&#8208;dicyanoanthracene, and 9&#8208;nitrobenzo[b]quinolizinium as suitable catalysts that initiate the fast cycloreversion of the quadricyclane to the norbornadiene with visible light (420&#160;nm) and with low catalyst loading. At the same time, there is no significant loss of favorable MOST properties, namely half&#8208;life and energy storage density. Thus, this method provides an efficient, complementary tool for the targeted cycloreversion of quadricyclane with high temporal and local control, as required for MOST applications.

         <title>Dipolar Molecular Motor Candidates with Planar Chirality</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two prototypes of molecular motors with simultaneous implementation of planar chirality and a permanent dipole have been designed and synthesized in 7 steps with overall yields of 2.8 to 5.5%.








Abstract
Two molecular motor candidates built around ruthenium(II) centers featuring both planar chirality and a permanent dipole have been synthesized in seven steps. These motors incorporate desymmetrized cyclopentadienyl ligands bearing electron&#8208;donating (4&#8208;methoxyphenyl) and electron&#8208;withdrawing (3,5&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl) groups in 1,2 or 1,3 relative positions, to induce strong dipolar moments and asymmetry helpful for unidirectional rotation. Two dipolar pentaarylcyclopentadienyl ligands were synthesized and coordinated to a Ru(II) trisindazolylborate complex functionalized with thioether moieties for surface anchoring. Structural analysis and DFT calculations revealed that dipole moments increase upon complexation, reaching 5.60 D and 4.58 D for the 1,2&#8208;CpAr5[Ru]Tp and 1,3&#8208;CpAr5[Ru]Tp complexes, respectively. Key synthetic challenges, such as low yields in Knoevenagel condensations and side reactions, were addressed through careful modulation of precursors, reaction conditions and cation selection. This study demonstrates the feasibility of integrating permanent dipoles and chirality into molecular motor design, which could offer an enhanced control over motion under STM&#8208;induced electric fields.

These motors incorporate desymmetrized cyclopentadienyl ligands bearing electron-donating (4-methoxyphenyl) and electron-withdrawing (3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl) groups in 1,2 or 1,3 relative positions, to induce strong dipolar moments and asymmetry helpful for unidirectional rotation. Two dipolar pentaarylcyclopentadienyl ligands were synthesized and coordinated to a Ru(II) trisindazolylborate complex functionalized with thioether moieties for surface anchoring. Structural analysis and DFT calculations revealed that dipole moments increase upon complexation, reaching 5.60 D and 4.58 D for the &lt;b&gt;1,2-Cp&lt;sup&gt;Ar5&lt;/sup&gt;[Ru]Tp&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;1,3-Cp&lt;sup&gt;Ar5&lt;/sup&gt;[Ru]Tp&lt;/b&gt; complexes, respectively. Key synthetic challenges, such as low yields in Knoevenagel condensations and side reactions, were addressed through careful modulation of precursors, reaction conditions and cation selection. This study demonstrates the feasibility of integrating permanent dipoles and chirality into molecular motor design, which could offer an enhanced control over motion under STM-induced electric fields.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Versatile Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8208;H Arylation of Fluoroarenes with 2&#8208;Chloropyridine Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Direct C&#9472;H arylation of fluoroarenes with 2&#8208;chloropyridines is enabled by a simple Pd/SPhos system in isopropyl acetate. The method uses inexpensive reactants and shows broad scope and high yields. DFT computations explain reactivity and selectivity. This practical strategy provides general access to fluorinated heteroarenes relevant across pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and materials science.








Abstract
Direct C&#9472;H arylation of fluoroarenes with 2&#8208;halopyridines remains underexplored, due to the low reactivity of both partners and the reliance on harsh conditions or toxic solvents. Herein, we report a general and sustainable method for the C&#9472;H arylation of fluoroarenes with 2&#8208;chloropyridines using Pd/SPhos as a simple catalytic system in isopropyl acetate. The protocol employs inexpensive starting materials, shows broad functional group tolerance, and delivers a wide range of 2&#8208;(fluorinated aryl)pyridines in up to 90% yield. Substrate scope studies uncovered key substituent effects on both coupling partners, while Density Functional Theory (DFT)&#8208;supported mechanistic analysis rationalized the observed reactivity and chemoselectivity. This research advances sustainable and practical methodologies for the synthesis of complex fluorinated aromatic compounds with potential applications in materials science, agrochemistry, and medicinal chemistry.

         <title>Enhanced Solid&#8208;State Luminescence of Supramolecular Tessellation Assemblies Through F&#246;rster Resonance Energy Transfer From Counterions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work explores how supramolecular tessellation enhances fluorescence quantum yield and induces redshift. Through self&#8208;assembly, it suppresses intramolecular rotation and vibration (RIR) that reduce nonradiative decay, boosting efficiency and shifting emission.








Abstract
The development of straightforward strategies for constructing supramolecular tessellations with enhanced solid&#8208;state luminescence has attracted growing interest in supramolecular chemistry and luminescent materials. Herein, we report the formation of diverse supramolecular tiling patterns by combining electron&#8208;deficient bipyridinium&#8208;based cationic macrocycles with either naphthalene&#8208;1&#8208;sulfonate or naphthalene&#8208;2&#8208;sulfonate counterions directly. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction reveals distinct tessellated superstructures assembled from 3,3&#8242;&#8208;bipyridinium macrocycles, stabilized by a network of electrostatic interactions, hydrogen bonding, &#960;&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; stacking, and CH&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; interactions. These assemblies exhibit red&#8208;shifted and enhanced solid&#8208;state fluorescence, attributed to F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) between the macrocycles and their aromatic counterions. Crystallographic and computational studies provide molecular&#8208;level insights into the noncovalent forces governing both the assembly process and luminescence enhancement. This work establishes a facile design strategy for constructing luminescent supramolecular tessellations and offers a deeper understanding of their structure&#8211;property relationships.

         <title>Hole&#8208;Selective Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayers Overlaid on NiOx or PEDOT:PSS for Tin&#8208;Based Perovskite Solar Cells &#8211; An Overview of Recent Characterization Methods</title>

         <dc:description>
Successfully applying self&#8208;assembled monolayers with hole&#8208;selectivity for lead&#8208;free tin perovskite solar cells requires judicious investigation with appropriately powerful characterization methods, in addition to efforts in the development of new materials and processing. We herein review the diverse characterization methods, the results obtained through them, and how to interpret those results.








Abstract
Self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) with high hole&#8208;selectivity have seen growing use in the research realm of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Even though SAMs can be used solely, their hole&#8208;selective performance is amplifiable on a p&#8208;type underlayer such as nickel oxide (NiOx) or poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrenesulfonate (PEDOT:PSS). This is especially prominent in lead&#8208;free tin&#8208;based PSCs. Herein, we review recent relevant publications on hole&#8208;selective SAMs overlaid on NiOx or PEDOT:PSS for tin PSCs. We first examine the characteristic features of the SAMs introduced in each publication. Since SAMs can affect the surface properties, interfacial properties, and perovskite quality, we focus on how these aspects are characterized and which methods are employed. In particular, the employed methods are various spanning computational simulations, microscopy imaging and electrochemical, spectroscopic, and crystallographic measurements. Through this review, we aim to encourage researchers to explore these aspects and methodologies in future research on hole&#8208;selective SAMs for tin PSCs.

         <title>Decoupling Redox Potentials and Excited State Energies in Substituted Chromium(III) Chromophores</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Redox and excited state properties of organic and precious metal CT photocatalysts are strongly entangled. In contrast, redox potentials of polypyridine chromium(III) complexes, that feature purely metal&#8208;centered SF states, are selectively tuned by incremental substituent effects of the CF3 group, while excited state energies and lifetimes remain unaffected. Such precisely designed chromophores provide a unique tool for the systematic investigation of elementary reaction steps relevant to photoredox catalytic cycles.








Abstract
Redox and excited state properties of classical organic and precious metal charge&#8208;transfer (CT) photocatalysts can be tuned by substituent effects&#8212;however, not independently, as redox and chromophore units are strongly entangled. In contrast, substituent effects should selectively address electrochemical properties of photoactive complexes based on metal&#8208;centered spin&#8208;flip (SF) excited states lacking CT character without compromising excited state properties. Yet, detailed structure&#8208;activity relationships for SF chromophores are lacking. We demonstrate that the redox potentials of polypyridine chromium(III) complexes, that feature purely metal&#8208;centered SF states, can be selectively tuned by incremental substituent effects, while the excited state energies and lifetimes remain unaffected. This delivers a unique series of chromophores with identical optical properties, but redox potentials tuned by increments. We believe, that such precisely designed chromophore series provide a unique tool for the systematic investigation of photoredox reactions and recombination processes relevant to photoredox catalytic cycles.

         <title>(2&#8208;Phosphinophenyl)aluminum Dichloride Complexes as Intramolecular Al/P Frustrated Lewis Pairs for Ketone, Ester, and Imine Activation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three 2&#8208;phosphinophenylaluminum dichloride complexes were synthesized and characterized as novel intramolecular FLPs. These FLP systems exhibit high Lewis acidity and effectively activate challenging substrates including aliphatic ketones, imines, and esters. DFT analysis revealed that strain release and Al&#8211;P dynamics govern their reactivity.








Abstract
(2&#8208;Phosphinophenyl)aluminum dichloride complexes were synthesized and their frustrated Lewis pair (FLP) reactivity was investigated. Selective mono&#8208;substitution of AlCl3 with lithioarenes was achieved by introducing sterically demanding substituents&#8212;tert&#8208;butyl, ethyl, or PCy2&#8212;at the 6&#8208;position of the phenylene linker, effectively suppressing over&#8208;substitution and enabling successful isolation of the target complexes. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and NMR spectroscopic analyses confirmed the formation of a four&#8208;membered P&#8211;Al&#8211;C&#8211;C core structure. These complexes function as Al/P&#8208;based FLPs capable of activating simple carbonyl and imine compounds, including aliphatic ketones, prop&#8208;2&#8208;ynoate esters, and N&#8208;arylimines. The mechanism of carbonyl activation by these Al/P FLPs was elucidated through density functional theory (DFT) calculations.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(2-Phosphinophenyl)aluminum dichloride complexes were synthesized and their frustrated Lewis pair (FLP) reactivity was investigated. Selective mono-substitution of AlCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; with lithioarenes was achieved by introducing sterically demanding substituents&#8212;&lt;i&gt;tert&lt;/i&gt;-butyl, ethyl, or PCy&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8212;at the 6-position of the phenylene linker, effectively suppressing over-substitution and enabling successful isolation of the target complexes. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction and NMR spectroscopic analyses confirmed the formation of a four-membered P&#8211;Al&#8211;C&#8211;C core structure. These complexes function as Al/P-based FLPs capable of activating simple carbonyl and imine compounds, including aliphatic ketones, prop-2-ynoate esters, and &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-arylimines. The mechanism of carbonyl activation by these Al/P FLPs was elucidated through density functional theory (DFT) calculations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis of Cyclobutane&#8208;Containing Tricyclic &#946;&#8208;Lactams Based on a Saturated Scaffold Enabled by Iron&#8208;catalysed [2&#160;+&#160;2]&#8208;Cycloaddition</title>

First syntheses of pyrrolidine&#8208;, piperidine&#8208;, and azepane tricyclic &#946;&#8208;lactams based on a saturated scaffold are achieved through an Fe&#8208;pyrimidinediimine&#8208;catalysed [2&#160;+&#160;2] cycloaddition of allylamines analogues followed by photo&#8208;induced intramolecular C&#9472;H insertion. The cage&#8208;like &#946;&#8208;lactam scaffolds enable strain&#8208;release access to methylphenidate analogues and expand the three&#8208;dimensional chemical space.








Abstract
Highly saturated, three&#8208;dimensional &#946;&#8208;lactams are valuable motifs in medicinal chemistry, yet general routes to cyclobutane&#8208;fused analogues remain scarce. Here we disclose a concise strategy that delivers pyrrolidine&#8208;, piperidine&#8208;, and azepane&#8208;based tricyclic &#946;&#8208;lactams. A pyrimidinediimine&#8208;iron catalyst first constructs the cyclobutane ring and the N&#8208;heterocycle in one step through an intermolecular [2&#160;+&#160;2]&#8208;cycloaddition of allyl amines; a subsequent photochemical intramolecular C&#9472;H insertion then forges the &#946;&#8208;lactam. The major products adopt rigid, cage&#8208;like conformations confirmed for the pyrrolidine series by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Comprehensive conformer sampling (using CREST), DFT&#8208;calculated NMR shifts, and DP4 statistical analysis establish the stereochemistry across the library. Strain&#8208;release opening of the &#946;&#8208;lactam ring furnishes methylphenidate analogues in a single step, underscoring the scaffolds&#8217; synthetic versatility. Comparative studies on the corresponding bicyclic systems highlight the unique three&#8208;dimensionality imparted by the additional cyclobutane ring, further expanding the toolbox for lead&#8208;oriented synthesis.

         <title>Stereoselective Syntheses of Cyclic Microsclerodermin Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Six different cyclic microsclerodermin derivatives are obtained from l&#8208;xylose and d&#8208;arabinose via stereoselective Sakurai allylations and photochemical Arndt&#8208;Eistert homologations.








Abstract
Starting from l&#8208;xylose and d&#8208;arabinose, six different cyclic microscleroderma derivatives were successfully obtained. Key steps of the syntheses are, on the one hand, Sakurai allylations, whose stereochemical course depends on the Lewis acid used, and on the other hand, photochemical Wolff rearrangements in the presence of complex aminofuranosides. Finally, aromatic side chains were introduced via cross metathesis.

         <title>The N&#8208;Bromo&#8208;Hammick Intermediate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spectroscopic and computational analysis uncovers the &#963;2&#963;*0 electronic structure of the N&#8208;bromo&#8208;Hammick intermediate, a singlet N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene isolated in solid neon, whose back&#8208;isomerization to bromopyridine proceeds via a planar transition state.








Abstract
We report the characterization of bromopyridin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene, the N&#8208;bromo&#8208;Hammick intermediate, isolated in solid neon at 4.4&#160;K. Computations (B2PLYP, NEVPT2), IR, and UV/vis spectroscopy characterize this intermediate as a singlet carbene with a vacant &#963;*&#8208;type frontier orbital. This unusual electronic structure (&#963;2&#963;*0) allows the carbene to isomerize to its more stable pyridine tautomer via a planar transition state, avoiding the deviation from planarity seen in other singlet carbenes. The compound's reaction with molecular hydrogen faces a minor but prohibitive barrier (8.4&#160;kcal mol&#8722;1) at the low temperatures of the experiment.

         <title>Hydrogen Bond Reformation in Tetracarboxylic Acid&#8208;Based Organic Frameworks with Square Lattice Topology</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structural transformation in hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) via bond cleavage and reformation is highlighted. Sql&#8208;type HOFs composed of tetracarboxylic acids bearing 4,4&#8242;&#8208;dicarboxy&#8208;o&#8208;terphenyl moieties are shown to be particularly prone to H&#8208;bond reformations. Analysis of molecular conformation and crystal packing provides design insights for controlling H&#8208;bond reformation, guiding the development of dynamic porous materials.








Abstract
The weak and reversible nature of hydrogen bonds endows porous materials with structural flexibility. In this article, we highlight structural transformations involving the cleavage and reformation of hydrogen bonds&#8212;termed H&#8208;bond reformation. To enable control over H&#8208;bond reformation through molecular design, we examine and discuss key structural features. Particular attention is given to tetracarboxylic acids bearing 4,4&#8242;&#8208;dicarboxy&#8208;o&#8208;terphenyl moieties as scaffolds for inducing H&#8208;bond reformation. These insights are expected to guide the rational design of dynamic porous materials with tunable properties and stimuli&#8208;responsive behavior.

         <title>Coordination Chemistry of Phosphinidene Stabilized by Mesoionic N&#8208;heterocyclic Carbene and Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Abnormal N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene&#8208;stabilized phosphinidene, a class of low&#8208;valent phosphorus compounds, has been recently stabilized by an isolated abnormal NHC. However, its coordination chemistry with various metal ions remained unexplored. Herein, we have explored the coordination chemistry of a mesoionic N&#8208;heterocyclic phosphinidene (mNHP,1), stabilized by an abnormal N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (aNHC) with various metals (Cu, Zn, and Sn) to afford trimetallic, bimetallic, and monometallic complexes, respectively. All these complexes were characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies. We have also explored the catalytic activity of one of these complexes for alkynylation of trifluoromethyl ketones and found that mNHP (1)&#8208;bound trimetallic Cu&#8208;complex is an excellent catalyst for this reaction with up to 97% isolated yield under low catalyst loading (3 mol%).

NMR evidence shows that tin(IV) chloride complexes with N,N&#8217;&#8208;bidentate sulfur diimide (SDI) ligands exist in a concentration&#8208;dependent equilibrium with acetonitrile, favoring displacement of SDI in dilute solutions. Voltammetry of only the bis&#8208;acetonitrile adduct shows deposition of tin(0) metal upon reduction, which seems to be suppressed in the presence of SDI, suggesting that SDIs may operate as redox&#8208;active ligands.








Abstract
A series of Sn(IV) chloride complexes with sulfur diimide (SDI, R&#8208;NSN&#8208;R) ligands are presented, including structural characterization of first&#8208;in&#8208;class complexes of bidentate diaryl&#8208;SDIs, [SnCl4{&#954;2&#8208;N,N&#8242;&#8208;S(NAr)2}] (Ar&#160;=&#160;4&#8208;X&#8208;C6H4&#8208;), and an oxygen&#8208;coordinated sulfinylamine, [SnCl4{&#954;1&#8208;O&#8208;OSNPh}2]. As part of the comprehensive experimental and DFT computational investigation, 119Sn NMR analysis revealed a dynamic exchange equilibrium in acetonitrile between SDI ligands and solvent, providing insight into their complicated solution&#8208;state chemical and electrochemical behavior. Voltammetric experiments show that, despite this dynamic equilibrium, the SDI ligands appear to suppress typical Sn(IV) reduction pathways. While tentative due to the complex behavior, this suggests that SDIs are functioning as redox&#8208;active (RA) ligands. In conjunction with our previous systematic characterization of diaryl&#8208;SDIs, these findings highlight their potential as an easily derivatized and highly redox&#8208;tunable category of RA ligand and emphatically warrant further investigation.

         <title>Pomegranate&#8211;Like Nano&#8208;Confined Silicon Inside Conductive Carbon Black as Anode Materials for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

We report a new strategy to prepare a pomegranate&#8208;like nano&#8208;confined silicon&#8208;carbon composites with excellent performance through a combination of wet chemical reduction methods and chemical vapor deposition (CVD) technique. The Si/XC@C&#8208;0.2 electrode exhibited a capacity retention rate of 157.7% after 400 cycles at a current density of 1 A g&#8722;1, while the Si/XC@C&#8208;0.5 electrode achieved the highest capacity after 400 cycles, reaching 835&#160;mA h g&#8722;1.








Abstract
Si materials possess a high theoretical specific capacity when used as anode material in lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). Si/C composites mitigate volume expansion and enhance conductivity, thus achieving improved electrochemical performance in LIBs. Herein, we report a new strategy for preparing pomegranate&#8208;like Si/C nanocomposites based on low&#8208;cost, readily available conductive carbon black (XC) by using a combination of wet chemical reduction and chemical vapor deposition (CVD) techniques. The preparation first involves a facile wet chemical approach to controlled hydrolysis of SiCl4 within XC. Subsequently, the obtained SiO2/XC precursor is reduced to highly crystalline Si particles within XC (Si/XC) using a novel ionic liquid&#8208;magnesium reduction system, avoiding unwanted byproducts associated with conventional high&#8208;temperature magnesium reduction. Finally, a pomegranate&#8208;like Si/XC composite is coated with an outer carbon layer via CVD, forming a nano&#8208;confined Si/C structure. The composites exhibit excellent reversible capacity and good cycle stability in LIBs. At 1 A g&#8722;1 after 400 cycles, the Si/XC@C&#8208;0.5 composite delivered the highest specific capacity of 835&#160;mA h g&#8722;1, exhibiting a capacity retention rate of 121% compared to the first cycle after activation (688&#160;mA h g&#8722;1). This work provides reproducible and scalable means to prepare high&#8208;performance Si/C composites for LIBs.

         <title>Synthesis of Fully Exposed Pt Nanoparticles on a 2D Mesoporous Graphitic Nanocarbon Framework for the Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a novel 2D mesoporous graphitic nanocarbon framework (MGF) is synthesized through chemical etching of 2D Fe3O4 nanocube superlattices (Fe3O4 NCSLs) and subsequent high&#8208;temperature graphitization. MGF possesses large specific surface area, open porous architecture, and high graphitization degree, making it an excellent platform for constructing Pt&#8208;based ORR electrocatalysts. The resulting Pt@MGF catalyst&#160;exhibits superior ORR activity and durability over commercial Pt/C catalysts.








Abstract
The durability of proton&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cells is often compromised by the corrosion of carbon supports in oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) cathodes under harsh operating conditions, including high oxygen concentration, elevated humidity, low pH, and high potentials. To overcome this limitation, we report the synthesis of a 2D mesoporous graphitic nanocarbon framework (MGF) via chemical etching and high&#8208;temperature graphitization. The resulting MGF features a monolayer, highly ordered nanoframe architecture that offers enhanced structural stability and conductivity. Leveraging these structural advantages, we designed fully exposed Pt nanoparticles anchored on the MGF (Pt@MGF) as a model system to investigate the interplay between graphitization degree, pore architecture, and electrocatalytic performance. Among the variants, Pt@MGF&#8208;1200, synthesized at 1200&#160;&#176;C, demonstrates optimized mesopore confinement and strong Pt&#8211;carbon interactions. This results in superior electrochemical durability and ORR activity, positioning Pt@MGF&#8208;1200 as a promising alternative to conventional Pt/C catalysts.

         <title>Products of the Phenyl Radical (C6H5, X2A1) &#8211; Acetylene (C2H2, X1&#931;g+) Reaction in the 800&#8208;1,200&#160;K Temperature Range</title>

A pulsed high&#8208;temperature microreactor coupled with VUV PI Re&#8208;TOF&#8208;MS was used to study the C6H5&#160;+&#160;C2H2 reaction via the HACA mechanism. Key products (C4H4, C6H5, C6H5C2H, C10H8, etc.) were detected in a molecular beam. At 800&#8211;1200&#160;K and 100&#8211;600&#160;Torr, the main products were phenylacetylene (C6H5C2H) and naphthalene (C10H8), supporting HACA dominance. Temperature and pressure trends align with theoretical predictions.








Abstract
A pulsed flow high&#8208;temperature microreactor in tandem with vacuum ultraviolet photoionization (VUV PI) reflectron time&#8208;of&#8208;flight mass spectrometry (Re&#8208;TOF&#8208;MS) was employed to determine branching ratios of key product channels of the reaction of the phenyl radical (C6H5) with acetylene (C2H2) highlighting the role of the Hydrogen Abstraction &#8211; C2H2 Addition (HACA) mechanism at temperatures of 800&#8211;1,200&#160;K. Temporal profiles of m/z&#160;=&#160;26 (C2H2+), 30 (NO+), 52 (C4H4+), 77 (C6H5+), 78 (C6H6+), 102 (C6H5C2H+), 103 (C6H5C2H2+), 107 (C6H5NO+), 128 (C10H8+), and 154 (C12H10+) were recorded and characterized within a molecular beam. From the time profiles of the ion signals and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) calculations in the transient mode, zones of the molecular beam corresponding to the open valve duration time were identified. The gas velocity along the microreactor tube axis with the opened valve is strongly influenced by the backing pressure (p) in front of the nozzle and appears to be subsonic for p = 100&#160;Torr and supersonic for p &#8805; 300&#160;Torr. The main quantified finding is that phenylacetylene (C6H5C2H) constitutes the dominant product, accounting for up to 91% of consumed phenyl radicals at 1,200&#160;K, whereas naphthalene (C10H8) formation is favored at lower temperatures and higher pressures, peaking at the yield of 53% (800&#160;K, 300&#160;Torr). The observed temperature and pressure dependence of naphthalene and phenylacetylene yields are consistent with the HACA mechanism.

&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;), 107 (C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;NO&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;), 128 (C&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;), and 154 (C&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) were recorded and characterized within a molecular beam. From the time profiles of the ion signals and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) calculations in the transient mode, zones of the molecular beam corresponding to the open valve duration time were identified. The gas velocity along the microreactor tube axis with the opened valve is strongly influenced by the backing pressure (p) in front of the nozzle and appears to be subsonic for p = 100&#160;Torr and supersonic for p &#8805; 300&#160;Torr. The main quantified finding is that phenylacetylene (C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H) constitutes the dominant product, accounting for up to 91% of consumed phenyl radicals at 1,200&#160;K, whereas naphthalene (C&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;) formation is favored at lower temperatures and higher pressures, peaking at the yield of 53% (800&#160;K, 300&#160;Torr). The observed temperature and pressure dependence of naphthalene and phenylacetylene yields are consistent with the HACA mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tautomerism&#8208;Coupled Self&#8208;Assembly and Transformations of Iminopyrrole Metallacages</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Four metallacages with varying size, symmetry, and nuclearity were formed via the self&#8208;assembly of 2,5&#8208;diformylpyrrole, tren, and zinc(II) acetate. Tautomerization of the key diiminopyrrole motif to iminoaminoazafulvene altered the assemblies&#8217; properties. Stimuli&#8208;induced, partially reversible interconversions between bi&#8208;, tetra&#8208;, and dodecanuclear cages revealed their dynamic nature.








Abstract
Four discrete metallacages were obtained from the condensation of 2,5&#8208;diformylpyrrole and tren in the presence of Zn(II). The structures differed in nuclearity, size, and symmetry, with the number of templating cations playing a key role in defining the properties of the architecture. The diiminopyrrole coordination motif, a fundamental structural feature of assemblies, undergoes tautomerization in certain cases, yielding an iminoaminoazafulvene, which alters the assembly. The controlled interconversion between bi&#8208;, tetra&#8208;, and dodecanuclear cages was achieved through simple stimuli, highlighting the dynamic nature of these assemblies.

         <title>Terminal Selective Arylation of Inert Alkanes via Radical&#8208;Organometallic Crossover</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selectivity is an essential part of organic synthesis and key to synthetic efficiency. However, selectivity is challenging to achieve in hydrocarbon molecules. Herein we report a mild and direct method that combines photo&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer (photo&#8208;HAT) and nickel&#8208;catalyzed organometallic chainwalking chemistry to give the first highly linear selective arylation reaction starting from inert alkanes.








Abstract
Selectivity is an essential part of organic synthesis and key to synthetic efficiency, where it can help reduce energy requirements for product separation, purification, and disposal of low value by&#8208;products. However, selectivity is challenging to achieve in hydrocarbon molecules, with C&#9472;H functionalization of alkanes almost invariably leading to a complex mixture of products favoring branched isomers and linear selectivity remaining elusive. Herein we report a mild and direct method that combines photo&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer (photo&#8208;HAT) and nickel catalyzed organometallic chainwalking chemistry to give the first highly linear selective arylation reaction starting from inert alkanes. Key to success is crossover from a radical to organometallic chainwalking mechanism permitted by a monodentate lutidine ligand, allowing an unselective photo&#8208;HAT step to be funneled regioconvergently to form the linear arylation product for a variety of alkanes. This result is in sharp contrast to the unselective formation of branched products using bidentate ligands and demonstrates monodentate heterocycles to be a privileged ligand class for selective C&#9472;H functionalization. Preliminary mechanistic experiments are consistent with the radical&#8208;organometallic crossover mechanism and support it as an important step toward controllable and selective functionalization of simple hydrocarbons.

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework Membranes: Emerging Nanofluidic Platforms for Gas Separation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes recent advances in HOF membranes for gas separation. In addition to covering fabrication methods of HOF membranes, this review highlights key characteristics that determine separation performance. Progress in challenging gas separations is deeply discussed, followed by an analysis of current limitations and future research directions for next&#8208;generation membrane development.








Abstract
The development of efficient and sustainable gas separation technologies is crucial for addressing global challenges in energy and the environment. Membrane separation technology, as an innovative, energy&#8208;saving, and highly efficient approach, offers an effective solution to these challenges. High&#8208;performance membranes materials serve as the core component enabling advanced and efficient membrane separation. Notably, hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) represent an emerging class of crystalline porous membrane materials formed through intermolecular hydrogen bonds between organic or metal&#8208;organic building units. The unique advantages of these materials, including moderate synthesis conditions, high crystallinity, and easy repairability and renewability, make them ideal porous membrane materials. This review comprehensively examines recent advances in HOF gas separation membranes. We objectively outline fabrication approaches and material design principle, including development prospects and preparation techniques for HOF separation membranes. We then systematically evaluate the current application status of HOF membranes in gas separation. Finally, future application potentials are projected, and challenges to be addressed in HOF gas separation are discussed.

         <title>Assembly&#8208;Sized&#8208;Controlled Chirality: Increase from Single Molecule to Micrometer Scale Enhances Chiroptical Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We envision a series of chiroptical materials based on highly emissive chiral dye DCS&#8208;Chol in multiple states of solution, powder, aggregate, gel, thin film, and liquid crystal (LC) encapsulation, the |glum| value in LC encapsulation was even amplified 491&#8208;fold, indicating a positive correlation between aggregate/assembly size and chiroptical activity.








Abstract
Achieving a high dissymmetry factor is a major challenge in the field of chiroptical activity. Notably, there is no systematic theory, from the perspective of assembly size, for achieving highly dissymmetric chiroptical materials. Here, we envision a highly emissive fluorophore DCS&#8208;Chol in multiple states, by covalently linking fluorescent dicyanodistyrylbenzene (DCS) with chiral cholesterol (Chol). DCS&#8208;Chol has a superb fluorescence quantum yield (36&#8211;74%) as a solution, powder, aggregate, gel, thin film, and liquid crystal (LC) encapsulation due to the locally excited transition. Interestingly, the successive increase in size of DCS&#8208;Chol aggregates/assemblies from single molecule to LC encapsulated state (105&#160;nm) was accompanied by amplification of circular dichroism (CD) and circularly polarized luminescence, indicating a positive correlation between aggregate/assembly size and chiroptical activity. In this work, a mechanism has been roundly proposed for the occurrence and amplification of chiroptical activity from the perspective of assembly size.

         <title>Recent Advances on the Electrosynthesis of H2O2 Through Two&#8208;Electron Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review comprehensively overviews the electrochemical synthesis of H2O2 via anodic water oxidation, focusing on recent advances in catalyst design, mechanism studies, device fabrication and applications. Finally, the existing challenges and future perspectives in this emerging field are discussed.








Abstract
Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is an eco&#8208;friendly oxidant with broad industrial applications, including wastewater treatment and paper bleaching. Despite the energy&#8208;intensive anthraquinone process is the dominant method for H2O2 production, there is a growing interest in direct electrochemical synthesis as a greener production method. Electrochemical synthesis, leveraging renewable energy and abundant resources, offers a promising alternative for on&#8208;site H2O2 production. This review focuses on advancements in the two&#8208;electron water oxidation reaction (2e&#8722; WOR) for H2O2 synthesis, covering the reaction mechanisms, catalyst development, and reactor designs. In particular, this review emphasizes the importance of understanding reaction mechanisms on guiding the electrocatalyst design. At the same time, this review highlights challenges in indirect H2O2 through tuning the electrolyte ions, like the carbonate or bicarbonate electrolytes, and the need for a comprehensive understanding of the electrolyte ion mediation pathways to guide the development of accurate theoretical models for predicting catalyst performance.

&lt;p&gt;Hydrogen peroxide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is an eco-friendly oxidant with broad industrial applications, including wastewater treatment and paper bleaching. Despite the energy-intensive anthraquinone process is the dominant method for H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production, there is a growing interest in direct electrochemical synthesis as a greener production method. Electrochemical synthesis, leveraging renewable energy and abundant resources, offers a promising alternative for on-site H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production. This review focuses on advancements in the two-electron water oxidation reaction (2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; WOR) for H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; synthesis, covering the reaction mechanisms, catalyst development, and reactor designs. In particular, this review emphasizes the importance of understanding reaction mechanisms on guiding the electrocatalyst design. At the same time, this review highlights challenges in indirect H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; through tuning the electrolyte ions, like the carbonate or bicarbonate electrolytes, and the need for a comprehensive understanding of the electrolyte ion mediation pathways to guide the development of accurate theoretical models for predicting catalyst performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Batch Synthesis of Primaquine Diphosphate Anti&#8208;Malarial Drug</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
According to the WHO, a child under the age of five dies every 2 minutes from malaria in Africa. It is therefore paramount that access and availability of anti&#8208;malarial drugs must be improved. We report a process for the synthesis of Primaquine Diphosphate, where key intermediates were obtained in a much shorter reaction time compared to processes reported in literature.








Abstract
An improved three&#8208;step synthesis route toward Primaquine Diphosphate is reported herein. The anti&#8208;malarial drug was obtained via n&#8208;alkylation of readily available potassium phthalimide, followed by reductive amination and room temperature methylaminolysis&#8208;assisted phthalimido deprotection of the key intermediates to furnish Primaquine Diphosphate in 47% overall isolated yield.

         <title>Proton&#8208;Conducting Amorphous Alumina Electrolytes for Low&#8208;Temperature Ceramic Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Proton&#8208;conducting amorphous alumina electrolyte derived from &#945;&#8208;Al2O3 and &#947;&#8208;Al2O3 showing disordered atomic configuration with multiple fast&#8208;ion pathways, achieving ionic conductivity of 0.08&#8211;0.12 S/cm at 480&#8211;540&#160;&#176;C for solid oxide fuel cell applications.








Abstract
The development of high&#8208;performance electrolytes enabling rapid ionic transport represents a critical pathway for operational temperature reduction in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs). This study introduces amorphous alumina (AlOx) as a novel electrolyte material, systematically investigating its structural characteristics and charge transport mechanisms through comparative analysis with crystalline alumina (&#945;&#8208;Al2O3, &#947;&#8208;Al2O3) and conventional gadolinium&#8208;doped ceria (GDC). It is found that AlOx possesses a notable enrichment of oxygen vacancy concentration. Its unique disordered atomic configuration plays a vital role in facilitating multiple pathways to enable fast ionic transport, resulting in high ionic conductivity of 0.08&#8211;0.12 S/cm at 480&#8211;540&#160;&#176;C, as evidenced by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), which is one order of magnitude superior to its crystalline counterpart. When implemented in symmetrical SOFC configurations, the AlOx electrolyte demonstrates unprecedented power density of 677&#160;mW/cm2 at 540 &#176;C. Further distribution of relaxation times (DRT) analysis confirms the predominance of protonic conduction pathways in AlOx while providing discernment of its electrochemical sub&#8208;processes. This work thus provides a new advanced electrolyte for low&#8208;temperature SOFCs while providing insights into amorphous ceramic.
