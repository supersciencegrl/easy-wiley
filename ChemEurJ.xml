      <title>Iodonium Cation&#8208;Pool Electrolysis for the Three&#8208;Component Synthesis of 1,3&#8208;Oxazoles</title>
      <dc:description>
Cation&#8208;pool electrolysis: The iodonium cation&#8208;pool electrolysis is the key&#8208;step in the three&#8208;component synthesis of 1,3&#8208;oxazoles by a stepwise [2+2+1] cycloaddition of internal alkynes in water&#8208;containing acetonitrile (see scheme).







Abstract
The synthesis of 1,3&#8208;oxazoles from symmetrical and unsymmetrical alkynes was realized by an iodonium cation&#8208;pool electrolysis of I2 in acetonitrile with a well&#8208;defined water content. Mechanistic investigations suggest that the alkyne reacts with the acetonitrile&#8208;stabilized I+ ions, followed by a Ritter&#8208;type reaction of the solvent to a nitrilium ion, which is then attacked by water. The ring closure to the 1,3&#8208;oxazoles released molecular iodine, which was visible by the naked eye. Also, some unsymmetrical internal alkynes were tested and a regioselective formation of a single isomer was determined by two&#8208;dimensional NMR experiments.

      <title>Mechanistic Investigation on Chemiluminescent Formaldehyde Probes</title>
      <dc:description>A first&#8208;generation pair of chemiluminescent formaldehyde (FA) probes&#160;(CFAP540 and CFAP700) was reported recently. CFAP540 and CFAP700 with high selectivity and sensitivity to FA, are respectively suitable in cell and in vivo. Experimentalists have confirmed that both probes utilize a general 2&#8208;aza&#8208;Cope FA&#8208;reactive trigger and a chemiluminogenic phenoxydioxetane scaffold. The mechanism and detailed process of CFAP chemiluminescence (CL) remain largely unknown. In the present paper, we performed (time&#8208;dependent) density functional theory calculations on the entire reaction process of CFAP540 with FA to produce CL. The calculations elucidated the CL producing process: FA initiates the decomposition of CFAP540 by dehydration condensation, and a phenoxy 1,2&#8208;dioxetane is formed through a series of reactions of aza&#8208;Cope rearrangement, hydrolysis of imine, and &#946;&#8208;elimination of alkoxyl group. Afterwards, the produced phenoxy 1,2&#8208;dioxetane decomposes to produce m&#8208;oxybenzoate derivative at the first singlet state (S1) via two crossings between potential energy surfaces of the ground state (S0) and S1 state. This m&#8208;oxybenzoate derivative was assigned to the light emitter of the CFAP540 CL. The CL producing process and assignment of the light emitter of CFAP700 CL are similar with the corresponding ones of CFAP540. By analyzing the D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A architecture of the light emitters of CFAP540 and CFAP700, we theoretically designed a series of CFAPs and proposed a scheme to modulate their CL from visible to near&#8208;infrared region by adjusting the length and structure of the &#960;&#8208;bridge.</dc:description>

      <title>D&#8208;A Interactions Induced Interfacial Synthesis of Ultrathin Fluoric Two&#8208;Dimensional Polymer via Photochemical [2 + 2] Cycloaddition</title>
      <dc:description>Two&#8208;dimensional polymers (2DPs) have attracted much interest due to their unique 2D atomic&#8208;thick covalent network with periodically linked monomers. The preparation of mono&#8208; or few&#8208;layered 2DPs with highly ordered structures is still a big challenge. Here, we report a preparation of ultrathin 2DP film based on photo&#8208;triggered [2 + 2] cycloaddition at the air/water interface. The pre&#8208;assembly process induced by the D&#8208;A interactions before the polymerization plays a key role in constructing highly ordered structure. The precise structure and chemical compositions of the continuous 2DP films were proved by selected area electron diffraction (SAED), tip&#8208;Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (TERS) and molecular&#8208;mechanics&#8208;based structural simulation.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Phosphonium ions are widely used in preparative organic synthesis and catalysis. The provision of new types of cations that contain both functional and chiral information is a major synthetic challenge and can open up new horizons in asymmetric cation&#8208;directed and Lewis acid catalysis.

Also the mechanism of dihydrogen release from a protonated hydrosilane was studied in detail by the help of Si&#8208;centered chirality as stereochemical probe. Chemoselectivity switch (dihydrogen release vs. protodesilylation) can easily be achieved through slight modifications of the solvent.

      <title>Ferrous to ferric transition in Fe&#8208;phthalocyanine driven by NO2 exposure</title>
      <dc:description>Due to its unique magnetic properties offered by the open&#8208;shell electronic structure of the central metal ion, and for being an effective catalyst in a wide variety of reactions, iron phthalocyanine has drawn significant interest from the scientific community. Nevertheless, upon surface deposition, the magnetic properties of the molecular layer can be significantly affected by the coupling occurring at the interface, and the more reactive the surface, the stronger is the impact on the spin state. Here we show that on Cu(100), indeed, the strong hybridization between the Fe  d  &#8208;states of FePc and the  sp  band of the copper substrate modifies the charge distribution in the molecule, significantly influencing the magnetic properties of the iron ion. The Fe  II  ion is stabilized in the low singlet spin state (S=0), leading to the complete quenching of the molecule&#8217;s magnetic moment. By exploiting the FePc/Cu(100) interface, we demonstrate that NO  2  dissociation can be used to gradually change the magnetic properties of the iron ion, by trimming the gas dosage. For lower doses, the FePc film is decoupled from the copper substrate, restoring the gas phase triplet spin state (S=1). A higher dose induces the transition from ferrous to ferric phthalocyanine, in its intermediate spin state, with enhanced magnetic moment due to the interaction with the atomic ligands. Remarkably, in this way, three different spin configurations have been observed within the same metalorganic/metal interface by exposing it to different doses of NO  2  at room temperature.</dc:description>

      <title>Electrochemical and Solvent&#8208;Mediated Visible&#8208;to&#8208;Near&#8208;Infrared Spectroscopic Switching of Benzoselenadiazole Fluorophores</title>
      <dc:description>
Color chart: A fluorophore whose emission spans the visible to the NIR regions depending on solvent has been prepared. Its visible color reversibly bleached upon electrochemical oxidation with the concomitant formation of a new absorption peak in the NIR. Its fluorescence could also be quenched by applying a potential.







Abstract
A series of electronic push&#8211;pull, pull&#8211;pull, and push fluorophores has been prepared from a benzoselenadiazole core so that their spectroscopic, electrochemical, spectro&#8208;electrochemical, and spectro&#8208;electrofluorescence properties could be examined. The emission wavelengths and fluorescence quantum yields (&#934;fl) of the N,N&#8208;dimethyl fluorophores were contingent on the solvent polarity and they ranged from 615 to 850&#8197;nm in aprotic solvents. The positive solvatochromism and the quenched &#934;fl in polar solvents were consistent with an intramolecular charge&#8208;transfer state (ICT). Meanwhile, a locally excited state (LE) was assigned in nonpolar solvents from the blue&#8208;shifted emission and high &#934;fl. The N,N&#8208;dimethylamine fluorophores examined could be both electrochemically oxidized and reduced, whereas the symmetric dinitro pull&#8211;pull derivative could be only reversibly reduced. Courtesy of their electrochemical reversibility, the fluorophores could reversibly change color from yellow to blue with an applied potential in addition to switching off their emission. The absorption of the electrochemically generated intermediates of the N,N&#8208;dimethyl derivatives spanned 500&#8197;nm over the visible and the NIR regions. The colors could be switched for upwards of two hours with applied potential, illustrating their potential use as electroactive materials in electrochromic devices.

Courtesy of their electrochemical reversibility, the fluorophores could reversibly change color from yellow to blue with an applied potential in addition to switching off their emission. The absorption of the electrochemically generated intermediates of the &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;dimethyl derivatives spanned 500&#8197;nm over the visible and the NIR regions. The colors could be switched for upwards of two hours with applied potential, illustrating their potential use as electroactive materials in electrochromic devices.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Azolium/hydroquinone organo&#8208;radical co&#8208;catalysis: Aerobic C&#8210;C&#8208;bond cleavage in ketones</title>
      <dc:description>Organo&#8208;radical catalysts have recently attracted great interest, and the development of this field can be expected to broaden the applications of organocatalysis. Herein, we report the first example of a radical&#8208;generating system that does not require any photoirradiation, radical initiators, or preactivated substrates. The oxidative C&#8211;C&#8208;bond cleavage of 2&#8208;substituted cyclohexanones was achieved using an azolium salt and a hydroquinone as co&#8208;catalysts. A catalytic mechanism is proposed based on the results of diffusion&#8208;ordered spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry measurements, as well as computational studies.</dc:description>

      <title>&#960;&#8208;Bridge Substitution in DASAs: the Subtle Equilibrium Between Photochemical Improvements and Thermal Control</title>
      <dc:description>Donor&#8211;Acceptor Stenhouse Adducts (DASAs) are playing an outstanding role as innovative and versatile photoswitches. Until now, all the efforts have been spent on modifying donor and acceptor moieties, to modulate the absorption energy and improve the cyclization and reversion kinetics. However, there is a strong dependence on specific structural modifications and a lack of predictive behavior, mostly due to the complex photoswitching mechanism. Here, by means of a combined experimental and theoretical study, we systematically explore the effect of chemical modification of the &#960;&#8208;bridge linking the donor and acceptor moieties, finding significant impact on the absorption, photocyclization and relative stability of the open form. Especially, a position along the &#960;&#8208;bridge is found to be the most suited to red&#8208;shift the absorption while preserving cyclization. However, thermal back&#8208;reaction to the initial isomer is blocked. These effects are explained in terms of an increased acceptor capability offered by the &#960;&#8208;bridge substituent that can be modulated. This strategy opens the path toward derivatives with infra&#8208;red absorption and a potential anchoring point for further functionalization.</dc:description>

After 1000 issues of the journal, our Editorial Board Chairs share their views on the past, present and future of Chemistry&#8212;A European Journal. The success of the journal is associated with the creativity and the work of its authors. Like all great journals there is increasing involvement of Asia and the Americas, too, in addition to the ongoing strengths of European chemistry. While the Journal tends to emphasize the fundamental research of the chemistry being published, some of the cutting&#8208;edge contributions also have an applied nature that underpins the industrial innovation of society.

      <dc:description>
The efficient and selective synthesis of functionalized seven&#8208;membered rings remains an important pursuit within synthetic organic chemistry. Use of cycloaddition reactions remains an attractive approach for their construction within the perspective of atom and step economy. This Review summarizes recent advances in transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed construction of seven&#8208;membered rings via combination of 2&#8211;4 components mediated by a variety of metals. An emphasis is placed on the mechanistic aspects of these transformations to both illustrate the state of the science and to highlight the unique application of novel processes of transition&#8208;metals in these transformations. For more details see the Review by B.&#8197;M. Trost et&#8197;al. on page&#8197;15354&#8197;ff.

      <title>Frontispiece: Remote Fluorination and Fluoroalkyl(thiol)ation Reactions</title>
      <dc:description>
Remote functionalization reactions have the power to transform a C&#8722;H (or C&#8722;C) bond at a distant position from a functional group. In the past few years, this strategy started to be practiced for the construction of versatile organofluorine compounds, such as remote fluorination, trifluoromethylation, difluoromethylation, trifluoromethylthiolation, and fluoroalkenation reactions. In this context, this Review aims to highlight key representative advances and breakthroughs in remote fluorination and fluoroalkyl(thiol)ation reactions with a particular emphasis on the control of reactivity and selectivity.

Vital! The recently delineated structure&#8208; and reactivity&#8208;based concept of antivitamins B12 has begun to bear fruit by the generation, and study, of a range of such B12&#8208;dummies, either vitamin B12&#8208;derived, or transition metal analogues that also represent potential antivitamins B12 or specific B12&#8208;antimetabolites.

      <title>Frontispiece: Pnictogen&#8208;Bonding Catalysis: An Interactive Tool to Uncover Unorthodox Mechanisms in Polyether Cascade Cyclizations</title>
      <dc:description>
Epoxide&#8208;opening polyether cascade cyclizations fascinate since the Nakanishi hypothesis was put forward to explain the biosynthesis of brevetoxin&#8197;B. By now, violations of the Baldwin rules are as common as speeding on the highway, McDonald elegantly mastered the inversion of directionality, but how can trans epoxides cyclize into cis&#8208;fused rings? A simple shift from SN2&#8208;type to SN1&#8208;type oxonium opening could be the answer. The currently emerging pnictogen&#8208;bonding catalysis reveals a completely different and quite spectacular alternative. For more details see the Communication by S.

      <title>Isolation and Structural Determination of a Hexacoordinated Antimony(V) Dication</title>
      <dc:description>The hexacoordinated antimony(V) dication [(ppy)3Sb]2+  ([1]2+; ppy = 2&#8208;(2&#8208;pyridyl)phenyl), stabilized by three intramolecular donor&#8208;acceptor interactions, was isolated as its hexachloroantimonate salt [1][SbCl6]2, which was prepared by the oxidative addition of chlorine to the neutral stibine (ppy)3Sb (1) followed by the abstraction of chloride. Air&#8208;stable [1][SbCl6]2  also exhibits remarkable thermal stability and the three ppy ligands on the Sb atom are magnetically inequivalent in the  1H and  13C NMR spectra. A hexacoordinated, meridional octahedral bonding geometry was determined for [1][SbCl6]2  by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis. Theoretical calculations were used to investigate why the meridional form was generated preferentially over the facial form. In addition, the dynamics of the ppy ligands were investigated using variable&#8208;temperature  1H NMR spectroscopy. Other methods to generate dications using a single electron transfer (SET) reagent were also investigated. The structural determination of [1]2+  is the first for a [12&#8211;Sb&#8211;6]2+  chemical species.</dc:description>

      <title>Terpyridine based 3D Metal&#8208;Organic&#8208;Frameworks: A Structure&#8208;Property Correlation</title>
      <dc:description>Design, synthesis, and applications of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are among the most salient fields of research in modern inorganic and materials chemistry. As the structure and physical properties of MOFs are mostly dependent on the organic linkers or ligands, the choice of ligand system always gets importance in the design of MOFs. One such crucial organic linker/ligand is terpyridine (tpy), which can adopt various coordination modes to generate an enormous number of metal&#8208;organic frameworks. These frameworks generally carry physicochemical characteristics induced by the &#960;&#8722;electron&#8208;rich (basically N&#8208;electron rich moiety) terpyridines. In this minireview, we intend to discuss the construction of 3D MOFs associated with symmetrical terpyridines. These ligands could be easily derivatized at the lateral phenyl (4&#697;&#8208;phenyl) position and incorporate additional organic functionalities. These functionalities lead to some different binding modes and form higher dimensional (3D) frameworks. Therefore, these 3D MOFs can carry multiple features along with the characteristics of terpyridines. Some properties of these MOFs, like photophysical, chemical selectivity, photocatalytic degradation, proton conductivity, and magnetism, etc. have also been discussed and correlated with their frameworks.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Design, synthesis, and applications of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are among the most salient fields of research in modern inorganic and materials chemistry. As the structure and physical properties of MOFs are mostly dependent on the organic linkers or ligands, the choice of ligand system always gets importance in the design of MOFs. One such crucial organic linker/ligand is terpyridine (tpy), which can adopt various coordination modes to generate an enormous number of metal&#8208;organic frameworks. These frameworks generally carry physicochemical characteristics induced by the &#960;&#8722;electron&#8208;rich (basically N&#8208;electron rich moiety) terpyridines. In this minireview, we intend to discuss the construction of 3D MOFs associated with symmetrical terpyridines. These ligands could be easily derivatized at the lateral phenyl (4&#697;&#8208;phenyl) position and incorporate additional organic functionalities. These functionalities lead to some different binding modes and form higher dimensional (3D) frameworks. Therefore, these 3D MOFs can carry multiple features along with the characteristics of terpyridines. Some properties of these MOFs, like photophysical, chemical selectivity, photocatalytic degradation, proton conductivity, and magnetism, etc. have also been discussed and correlated with their frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
A facile route to PtII complexes doubly functionalized with bioactive molecules through a bipyridine&#8208;type ligand is described. Initially, ligands LEE (containing two ethacrynic acid units), LEF (ethacrynic acid+flurbiprofen) and LEB (ethacrynic acid+biotin) were obtained in moderate to good yields from 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine&#8208;4,4&#8242;&#8208;dicarboxylic acid. Subsequent reaction of the ligands with [PtCl2(DMSO)2] afforded complexes [PtCl2(LEE)] (2), [PtCl2(LEF)] (3) and [PtCl2(LEB)] (4) in high yields. All compounds were fully characterized by analytical and spectroscopic methods. Complexes&#8197;2&#8211;4 are highly stable in water/DMSO solution at 37&#8201;&#176;C after 72&#8197;h, whereas progressive release of the bioactive fragments was detected in a cell culture medium. The compounds were assessed for their in vitro antiproliferative activity towards tumorigenic A2780, A2780cisR and Y79 cells and non&#8208;tumourigenic HEK293 cells. In particular, the combination of ethacrynic acid and flurbiprofen in 3 overcomes cisplatin&#8208;based resistance and provides strong cancer cell selectivity. Enzyme inhibition assays on human GST P1 and human COX&#8208;2 and cross&#8208;experiments with complex&#8197;1, analogous to 2&#8211;4 but lacking bio&#8208;groups, revealed a clear synergy between the PtII frame and the bioactive organic components.

A hexa&#8208;peri&#8208;hexabenzocoronen based diaza[7]helicene was synthesized featuring a wide lateral &#960;&#8208;extension of the inner helix.

      <dc:description>
&#8220;The annulation of thiophene rings at the 2,3&#8208;positions imparts sufficient stability to the pentalene moieties even in the absence of bulky substituents, while retaining the pronounced antiaromatic character. This result is a stark contrast with the fact that the condensation of benzene rings diminishes the antiaromatic character of the resulting &#960;&#8208;electron systems.&#8221; Read more about the story behind the cover in the Cover Profile and about the research itself on page&#8197;&#9642;&#9642;&#8197;ff.

&lt;p&gt;&#8220;&lt;i&gt;The annulation of thiophene rings at the 2,3&#8208;positions imparts sufficient stability to the pentalene moieties even in the absence of bulky substituents, while retaining the pronounced antiaromatic character. This result is a stark contrast with the fact that the condensation of benzene rings diminishes the antiaromatic character of the resulting &#960;&#8208;electron systems&lt;/i&gt;.&#8221; Read more about the story behind the cover in the Cover Profile and about the research itself on page&#8197;&#9642;&#9642;&#8197;ff.

      <title>Regiospecific Synthesis of Calcium&#8208;Independent Daptomycin Antibiotics Using a Chemoenzymatic Method</title>
      <dc:description>Daptomycin (DAP) is a calcium (Ca2+)&#8208;dependent FDA&#8208;approved antibiotic drug for the treatment of Gram&#8208;positive infections. It possesses a complex pharmacophore hampering derivatization and/or synthesis of analogs. In order to mimic the Ca2+&#8208;binding effect we uses a chemoenzymatic approach to modify the tryptophan (Trp) residue of DAP and synthesize kinetically characterized and structurally elucidated regiospecific Trp&#8208;modified DAP analogs. We demonstrated that the modified DAPs are several&#8208;folds active than the parent molecule against antibiotic&#8208;susceptible and antibiotic&#8208;resistant Gram&#8208;positive bacteria. Strikingly and in contrast to the parent molecule, the DAP derivatives do not rely on calcium or any additional elements for activity.</dc:description>

      <title>Iridium(III) Sensitizers and Energy Upconversion: The Influence of Ligand Structure Upon TTA&#8208;UC Performance</title>
      <dc:description>Six substituted ligands based upon 2&#8208;(naphthalen&#8208;1&#8208;yl)quinoline&#8208;4&#8208;carboxylate and 2&#8208;(naphthalen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)quinoline&#8208;4&#8208;carboxylate have been synthesized in two steps from a range of commercially available isatin derivatives. These species are demonstrated to be effective cyclometalating ligands for Ir(III) yielding complexes of the form [Ir(C^N)2(bipy)]PF6 (where C^N = cyclometalating ligand; bipy = 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine). X&#8208;ray crystallographic studies on three examples demonstrate that the complexes adopt a distorted octahedral geometry wherein a cis&#8208;C,C and trans&#8208;N,N coordination mode is observed. Intra&#8208;ligand torsional distortions are evident in all cases. The Ir(III) complexes display photoluminescence in the red part of the visible region (668&#8208;693 nm) which is modestly tuneable via the ligand structure. The triplet lifetimes of the complexes are clearly influenced by the precise structure of the ligand in each case. Supporting computational (DFT) studies suggest that the differences in observed triplet lifetime are likely due to differing admixtures of ligand&#8208;centred versus MLCT character instilled by the facets of the ligand structure. Triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation upconversion (TTA&#8208;UC) measurements demonstrate that the complexes based upon the 1&#8208;naphthyl derived ligands are viable photosensitizers with upconversion quantum efficiencies of 1.6&#8208;6.7%.</dc:description>

      <title>A high&#8208;efficiency hematite photoanode with enhanced bonding energy around Fe atoms</title>
      <dc:description>Hematite nanoarray is an important photoanode materials. However, it suffers from serious problems of charge transfer and surface states, especially the surface states hinder the increase of photocurrent. Previous strategy to suppress the surface state is the deposition of Fe&#8208;free metal oxide overlayer. Herein, from the viewpoint of atomic bonding energy, we discover that the strength of bonding around Fe atoms in the hematite is the keypoint to suppress the surface states. By treating the surface of hematite with Se and NaBH  4  , the Fe  2  O  3  transfers to be a double&#8208;layer nanostructure. In the outer layer, the Fe&#8208;O bonding is reinforced and the Fe&#8208;Se bonding is even stronger. Therefore, the surface states are inhibited and the increase of the photocurrent density becomes much faster. Besides, the treatment construct a nanoscale p&#8208;n junction to promote the charge transfer. Improvements are achieved in onset potential (0.25 V shift) and in photocurrent density (5.8 times). This work pinpoints the keypoint to suppress the surface states and prepare high&#8208;efficiency hematite nanoarray, and deepens our understanding of the hematite photoanode.</dc:description>

In this work, to address this question, we develop three dibenzo&#8208;azaacene molecules incorporated with two B&#8592;N units at different positions. Although the dibenzo&#8208;azaacene skeleton is fully &#960;&#8208;conjugated, the effect of B&#8592;N unit on the electronic structures of the adjacent rings is much stronger than that of the distant rings.

When used as the active layer in organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs), while the two axisymmetrical molecules show unipolar electron transporting property, the centrosymmetrical molecule exhibits ambipolar hole and electron transporting behavior.

      <title>Modulating the electron&#8208;donating ability of acridine donor units for orange&#8208;red thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitters</title>
      <dc:description>The development of the thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters with orange&#8208;red emission is still lagged behind their blue, green and yellow counterparts. Recent researches to address this problem mainly focused on developing new acceptor units. There were few donor units designed especially for orange&#8208;red emitters. Herein, with the benzothiophene fused to the diphenyl acridine donor unit, a new donor moiety, namely BTDPAc, was designed and synthesized.

      <title>Replacing the rhamnose&#8211;xylose moiety of QS&#8208;21 with simpler terminal disaccharide units attenuates adjuvant activity in truncated saponin variants</title>
      <dc:description>Adjuvants are key immunostimulatory components in vaccine formulations that improve the immune response to the co&#8208;administered antigen. The saponin natural product QS&#8208;21 is one of the most promising immunoadjuvants in the development of vaccines against cancer and infectious diseases but suffers from limitations that have hampered its widespread human use. Previous structure&#8208;activity relationship studies have identified simplified saponin variants with truncated carbohydrate chains, but have not focused on the influence of the linear oligosaccharide domain of QS&#8208;21 in adjuvant activity. Herein we report expeditious 15&#8208;step syntheses of new linear trisaccharide variants of simplified QS&#8208;21&#8208;derived adjuvants in which the complex terminal xylose&#8211;rhamnose moiety has been replaced with commercially available, simpler lactose and cellobiose disaccharides in a &#946;&#8208;anomeric configuration.  In vivo  immunological evaluation of the synthetic saponins showed attenuated antibody responses, highlighting the negative impact of such carbohydrate modifications on adjuvant activity, which could be associated with higher saponin conformational flexibility.</dc:description>

      <title>Emerging Implications of the Concept of Hydricity in Energy&#8208;Relevant Catalytic Processes</title>
      <dc:description>&#8216;Hydricity&#8217; of a species refers to its hydride donor ability. The way the p  K  a  concept is useful to determine the extent of proton transfer, the hydricity concept plays a vital role in understanding hydride transfer reactions. A large number of transition metal&#8208;catalyzed processes involve hydride transfer reaction as a key step.

Therefore, it is imperative to develop an in&#8208;depth relationship of hydricity of transition metal hydrides to its influencing factors so that efficient and suitable hydride transfer catalysts can be designed. Moreover, such a profound knowledge can also help in improving the existing catalysts in terms of their efficiency and working mechanism. With this broad aim in mind, some important research works have been explored in this area in recent times.

When O  2  and H  2  O are present, (1&#8208;methyl&#8208;1H&#8208;benzo[d]imidazole&#8208;2&#8208;carbonyl)amide (  HL1'  ) is first formed and crystallized as [Co  III  (  L1  )  2  (  L1'  )]Cl  2  &#8729;2H  2  O (  4  ) before fusion of H  L1'  with  L1  giving 1&#8208;methyl&#8208;N&#8208;(1&#8208;methyl&#8208;1H&#8208;benzo[d]imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;carbonyl)&#8208;1H&#8208;benzo[d]imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;carboxamide (  HL2''  ) forming one&#8208;dimensional (1D) chain of [Co  II  3  (  L2''  )  2  Cl  4  ]  n  (  5  ). The combination of crystallography and mass spectrometry (ESI&#8208;MS) of isolated crystals and the solutions taken from the reaction as a function time reveal seven intermediate steps leading to  2  , but six steps for  5  which a different sequence takes place. Control and isotope labeling experiments confirm the two carbonyl oxygen atoms in  5  originate from both air and water. The dependence on the metals, compared to FeCl  3  &#183;6H  2  O leading to a stable triheteroarylmethyl radical, is quite astounding, which could be attributed to the different oxidation states of the metals and coordination modes confirmed by DFT calculations. This metal and valence dependent process is a very useful way for selectively obtaining these large molecules which are unachievable by common organic synthesis.</dc:description>

      <title>Understanding the C&#8211;F Bond Activation Mediated by Frustrated Lewis Pairs: Crucial Role of Noncovalent Interactions</title>
      <dc:description>The activation of a single C&#8211;F bond in di&#8208; and trifluoromethyl groups by frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) has been computationally explored by means of Density Functional Theory calculations. It is found that in this activation reaction the FLP partners exhibit a peculiar cooperative action, which is markedly different from related FLP&#8208;mediated processes, and where noncovalent interactions established between the Lewis base and the substrate play a decisive role. In addition, the process proceeds through the intermediacy of a hypervalent species featuring a pentacoordinate carbon atom, which is rare in the chemistry of FLPs. The physical factors controlling this process as well as the bonding situation of these hypervalent intermediates have been quantitatively analyzed in detail using state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art computational methods to not only rationalize the mechanism of the transformation but also to guide experimentalists towards the realization of these so far elusive hypervalent systems.</dc:description>

      <title>New Members of Stuffed tridymite Structure: Synthesis, Structure, SHG, Optical and Multiferroic Properties</title>
      <dc:description>We explored the stuffed tridymite structure Ba(Zn/Co)  1&#8208;x  Si  1&#8208;x  M  2x  O  4  (M = Al  3+  and Fe  3+  ) for the possible multiferroic behaviour and to develop new inorganic colored materials. The compounds were synthesized employing conventional solid&#8208;state chemistry methods in the temperature range of 1100&#8211;1175 &#176;C for 24 h. The powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (PXRD) and Rietveld refinement studies indicate that the compounds stabilize in  P  63 space group (no. 173). The refinement results were also rationalized employing Raman spectroscopic studies.The compounds were found to be SHG active and shows a weak ferroelectric behaviour. The co&#8208;substitution of Co  2+  and Fe  3+  in the structure gives rise to a weak ferromagnetic behaviour to the compound, BaCo  0.75  Si  0.75  Fe  0.5  O  4  , making it a multiferroic material. The optical studies on the prepared compounds exhibited blue color (Co  2+  in T  d  geometry); purple color (Ni  2+  in T  d  geometry) and simultaneous substitution of Co  2+  and Fe  3+  gives rise to blue&#8208;green color due to metal&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer (MMCT) effect.</dc:description>

      <title>Dynamic ion speciation during hydrolysis of aryltrifluoroborates</title>
      <dc:description>Organotrifluoroborates serve as a coupling partner during transmetallation in the Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura reaction but require hydrolysis prior to the coupling reaction. Their anionic nature allows study of their hydrolysis by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI&#8208;MS) by real&#8208;time monitoring, complemented by pH analysis. Induction periods varied according to the borates employed, and a dynamic series of equilibria for numerous ions was observed during hydrolysis. We found that the induction periods and reaction rates were sensitive to the R group of the borates, the shape of reaction vessel, and stir rate.</dc:description>

      <title>Rational Design of High Relaxivity EuII&#8208;Based Contrast Agents for Magnetic Resonance Imaging of Low&#8208;Oxygen Environments</title>
      <dc:description>Metal&#8208;based contrast agents for magnetic resonance imaging present a promising avenue to image hypoxia. Eu  II  &#8208;based contrast agents have a unique biologically relevant redox couple, Eu  II/III  , that distinguishes this metal for use in hypoxia imaging. To that end, we investigated a strategy to enhance the contrast&#8208;enhancing capabilities of Eu  II  &#8208;based cryptates in magnetic resonance imaging by controlling rotational dynamics. Two dimetallic, Eu  II  &#8208;containing cryptates were synthesized to test the efficacy of rigid versus flexible coupling strategies. A flexible strategy to dimerization led to a modest (114%) increase in contrast enhancement per Eu ion (60 MHz, 298 K), but a rigid linking strategy led to an excellent (186%) increase in contrast enhancement despite having the smaller molecular mass of the two dimetallic complexes. We envision the rigid linking strategy to be useful in the future design of potent Eu  II  &#8208;based contrast agents for magnetic resonance imaging.</dc:description>

      <title>An Anthracene&#8208;Based Metal&#8208;Organic Framework for Selective Photo&#8208;Reduction of Carbon Dioxide to Formic Acid Coupled with Water Oxidation</title>
      <dc:description>A Zr&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework has been synthesized and employed as a catalyst for photochemical carbon dioxide reduction coupled with water oxidation. The catalyst shows significant carbon dioxide reduction property with concomitant water oxidation. The catalyst has broadband visible light as well as UV light absorption property, which is further confirmed from electronic absorption spectroscopy. We have obtained formic acid as the only reduced product from carbon dioxide with a TOF of 0.69 h  &#8208;1  and oxygen with a TOF of 0.54 h  &#8208;1  . No external photosensitizer is used and the ligand itself acts as the light harvester. So, here we have illustrated efficient and selective photochemical carbon dioxide reduction to formic acid with concomitant water oxidation using Zr&#8208;based MOF as catalyst.</dc:description>

      <title>Effect of Stereochemistry on the Supramolecular Self&#8208;Assembly Chirality and Gelation Property</title>
      <dc:description>Although chiral nanostructures have been fabricated at various structural levels, the transfer and amplification of chirality from molecules to supramolecular self&#8208;assemblies are still puzzling, especially for heterochiral molecules. Herein, four series of C2&#8208;symmetrical dipeptide&#8208;based derivatives bearing various amino acid sequences and different chiralities are designed and synthesized.  The transcription and amplification of molecular chirality to supramolecular assemblies are achieved. The results show that the supramolecular chirality is only determined by the amino acid adjacent to the benzene core and irrespective of the absolute configuration of C&#8208;terminal amino acid.  In addition, the molecular chirality also has a significant influence on their gelation behaviors. For the diphenylalanine&#8208;based gelators, the homochiral gelators can be gelled through conventional heating&#8208;cooling process, while heterochiral gelators form translucent stable gels under sonication. And the racemic gels possess higher mechanical properties than that of pure enantiomers. All these results contribute to an increasing knowledge over control the generation of specific chiral supramolecular structures and the development of new optimized strategies to achieve functional supramolecular organogel through heterochiral and racemic systems.</dc:description>

New strategies to prevent and treat bacterial infections via eradication of the biofilms are urgently needed. A novel ruthenium&#8208;based compound was reported in this study that functions as both a boronic acid&#8208;decorated photosensitizer (PS) and a light&#8208;triggered nitric oxide (NO) releasing agent.

      <title>Dimesitylborylethynylated Arenes: Unique Electronic and Photophysical Properties Caused by Ethynediyl (C&#8801;C) Spacers</title>
      <dc:description>Herein, we report synthesis, electrochemical and photophysical properties of aromatic hydrocarbons having one and two dimesitylborylethynyl peripherals&#160;  1  &#160;and&#160;  2  . The mono&#8208; (  1  ) and di&#8208;boryl compounds (  2  ) readily prepared by nucleophilic substitution reaction are fairly stable to air and moisture in the solid&#8208;state. The inserted ethynediyl (C &#8801;C) spacer cancels steric hindrance between the bulky dimesitylboryl groups and the aromatic rings, leading to effective&#160; &#960; &#8208;conjugation over the B &#8208; C &#8801; C &#8208;Ar linkages as revealed by cyclic voltammetry. Despite the small structural differences, photophysical properties of the benzene, naphthalene, and anthracene derivatives were different. Virtually no emission was observed for the benzene derivatives, whereas the anthracene derivatives emitted with high quantum yields both in solution and solid states. Notably, the naphthalene derivatives showed aggregation&#8208;induced emission behavior. Unlike common sterically congested triarylborane derivatives reported so far, the anthracene derivatives showed&#160; &#960; &#8208; &#960; * type absorption and emission bands, which derived from the efficient intramolecular orbital interactions between the boron centers and the anthracene moieties as supported by the density functional calculations. As a result, the dimesitylborylethynyl substituents effectively lowers the LUMO levels of the aromatic hydrocarbon parts while the HOMO levels are almost unaffected, leading to materials with controllable HOMO&#8208;LUMO gaps.</dc:description>

      <title>Discovery of a pyrimidine&#8208;dione derivative with potent inhibitory activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis&#160;ketol&#8208;acid reductoisomerase</title>
      <dc:description>New drugs aimed at novel targets are urgently needed to combat the increasing rate of drug resistant tuberculosis (TB). Here, the National Cancer Institute Developmental Therapeutic Program (NCI&#8208;DTP) chemical library was screened against a promising new target, ketol&#8208;acid reductoisomerase (KARI), the second enzyme in the branched chain amino acid (BCAA) biosynthesis pathway. From this library, 6&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;methylthiazolo[4,5&#8208;  d  ]pyrimidine&#8208;5,7(4  H  ,6  H  )&#8208;dione (NSC116565) was identified as a potent time&#8208;dependent inhibitor of  Mycobacterium tuberculosis  (  Mt  ) KARI with a K  i  of 95.4 nM. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC) studies showed that this inhibitor binds to Mt KARI in the presence and absence of the co&#8208;factor, NADPH, which was confirmed by crystal structures of the compound in complex with the closely related Staphylococcus aureus (  Sa  ) KARI. We have also shown that NSC116565 inhibits the growth of H37Ra and H37Rv strains of Mt with MIC  50  values of 2.93 &#181;M and 6.06 &#181;M, respectively. These results further validate KARI as a TB drug target and show that NSC116565 is a promising lead for anti&#8208;TB drug development.</dc:description>

      <title>Lewis Acidic Boranes, Lewis Bases, and Equilibrium Constants: A Reliable Scaffold for a Quantitative Lewis Acidity/Basicity Scale</title>
      <dc:description>In this study, we developed a quantitative Lewis acidity/basicity scale toward boron&#8208;centered Lewis acids based on a set of 90 experimental equilibrium constants for the reactions of triarylboranes with various O&#8208;, N&#8208;, S&#8208;, and P&#8208;centered Lewis bases in dichloromethane at 20 &#176;C. Analysis with the linear&#8208;free energy relationship lg  K  B  =  LA  B  +  LB  B  allows to calculate equilibrium constants  K  B  for any type of borane/Lewis base combination by the sum of two descriptors, one for Lewis acidity (  LA  B  ) and one for Lewis basicity (  LB  B  ). The resulting Lewis acidity/basicity scale is independent of fixed reference acids/bases and valid toward various types of trivalent boron&#8208;centered Lewis acids. We demonstrate that the newly developed Lewis acidity/basicity scale is easily extendable through linear relationships with quantum&#8208;chemically calculated or common physical&#8208;organic descriptors and known thermodynamic data (&#916;  H  BF3  ). Furthermore, we show that this experimental platform can be utilized for the rational development of borane&#8208;catalyzed reactions.</dc:description>

      <title>How does bridging core modification alter the photovoltaic characteristics of triphenylamine&#8208;based hole transport materials? Theoretical understanding and prediction</title>
      <dc:description>Perovskite solar cells have gained immense interest of researchers owing to their high photophysical properties, low&#8208;cost production, and high power conversion efficiencies. Hole transport materials (HTMs) play a dominant role in enhancing the power conversion efficiencies (PCE), and long length diffusion of hole and electron in perovskite solar cells. In hole transport materials, modification of &#960;&#8208;linkers is proved to be an efficient approach for enhancing the overall PCE of perovskite solar cells. In this work, &#960;&#8208;linker modification of recently synthesized H&#8208;Bi molecule (  R  ) is done with novel &#960;&#8208;linkers. After structural modifications, ten novel HTMs (  HB1&#8208;HB10  ) having D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;D backbone have been obtained. Structural&#8208;property relationship, optoelectronic and photovoltaic characteristics of newly designed hole transport materials are comprehensively examined and compared with reference molecule. In addition, different geometric parameters are also examined with assist of density functional theory and time dependent&#8208;density functional theory. All designed molecules exhibit narrow HOMO&#8208;LUMO energy gap (E  g  =2.82&#8208;2.99 eV) as compared to R molecule (E  g  =3.05 eV). Designed molecules expressed red&#8208;shifting in absorption spectra with low values of excitation energy which in return offer high power conversion efficiencies.&#160;Results of all analysis advocate that these novel designed HTMs are ideal aspirant for construction of future high performance perovskite solar cells.</dc:description>

      <title>Doubling F&#246;rster Resonance Energy Transfer Efficiency in Proteins with Extrinsic Thioamide Probes: Implications to Thiomodified Nucleobases</title>
      <dc:description>Designing potential protein&#8208;ligand pair is pivotal not only to track protein structure, dynamics but also to assist in atomistic understanding of drug delivery. Here we report the potentiality of a small model thioamide probe that can be used to study albumin proteins. Monitoring F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) dynamics with the help of fluorescence spectroscopic techniques, we observed two&#8208;fold enhancement in the FRET efficiency in the case of 2&#8208;Thiopyridone (2TPY) compared to its amide analog. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation depicts the relative position of the free energy minima to be quite stable in case of 2TPY via non&#8208;covalent interactions with sulfur which helps for enhancement in the FRET efficiency. Finally, we showed its application by pairing thiouracils with protein. We found that site&#8208;selective sulfur atom substitution approach and non&#8208;covalent interactions with sulfur can substantially enhance the FRET efficiency which can be a potential avenue to explore for designing FRET probes to study structure and dynamics of biomolecules.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Alzheimer&#8217;s Disease (AD) is one of the most common multifactorial diseases characterized by a range of abnormal molecular processes such as the accumulation of extracellular plaques containing the amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) peptides and dyshomeostasis of copper in the brain. Herein, we investigate the effect of Cu(II) ions on the aggregation of A&#946;1&#8208;40, and A&#946;4&#8208;40, representing two most prevalent families of A&#946; peptides, full length and N&#8208;truncated ones. Both families are similarly abundant in healthy and AD brains. In either of the studied peptides, substoichiometric Cu(II) concentrations accelerated aggregation, while superstoichiometric Cu(II) inhibited the fibril formation, likely by stabilizing oligomers. The addition of either A&#946;4&#8208;40 or substoichiometric Cu(II) ions affected the aggregation profile of A&#946;1&#8208;40, by yielding shorter and thicker fibrils. The similarity of these two effects can be attributed to the increase of positive charge at the A&#946; N&#8208;terminus, which is caused either by Cu(II) complexation or N&#8208;truncation at position 4.
