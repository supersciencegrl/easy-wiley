         <title>Resolution of Expanded Porphyrinoids: A Path to Persistent Chirality and Appealing Chiroptical Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chirality is a fundamental characteristic of nature. Expanded porphyrinoids and their analogues offer an attractive platform for delving into the intricacies of chirality. Expanded porphyrioids comprise pyrrolic macrocycles and related heterocyclic systems. As a class, expanded porphyrioids are widely recognized for their flexible structural features, nontrivial coordination capabilities, and intriguing optical and electronic properties. With limited exceptions, their inherent conformational flexibility coupled with a low racemization barrier allows for the facile interchange between enantiomers. As a result, achieving the effective chiral resolution of individual enantiomers and the subsequent exploration of their chiroptical properties represents a significant challenge. This review summarizes strategies used to realize the chiral resolution of expanded porphyrinoids and the understanding of intrinsic chiroptical properties that has emerged from these separation efforts. It is our hope that this review will serve not only to codify our current understanding of chiral expanded porphyrinoids, but also inspire advances in the generalized area of chiral functional materials.</dc:description>

         <title>On the Number of &#960;&#8208;Electrons Involved in Stepwise Cycloaddition Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of higher&#8208;order cycloadditions has mainly been restricted by the requisite usage of highly conjugated and reactive &#960;&#8208;systems. Recent years have witnessed organocatalysis as a potent mediator for several of the challenges associated herein, rendering higher&#8208;order cycloadditions a legitimate option for achieving the selective construction of specific molecular scaffolds. These developments reinvigorate the efforts to try to understand the underlying principles for cycloadditions involving a higher numbers of &#960;&#8208;electrons than the &#8220;classical&#8221; cycloadditions; how do we properly address the impact which the addition of further &#960;&#8208;electrons have on the reactivity of a system? Herein, computational investigations of two model higher&#8208;order cycloaddition systems have been performed to try to provide insights on changes in energetic barriers induced by the presence of benzofusions in a position which is unobstructive to the reactivity. With experimental substantiation as support, these studies might open up for a discussion on whether the &#960;&#8208;electrons of benzofused systems simply act as spectator electrons, or play a tangible role on the observed reactivity to an extent, where a distinct nomenclature is meritable.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamic and Assembly Characteristics of Deep&#8208;Cavity Basket Acting as a Host for Inclusion Complexation of Mitoxantrone in Biotic and Abiotic Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We describe the preparation and dynamic/assembly characteristics of vase&#8208;shaped basket&#160;13&#8208;&#160;along with its ability to form an inclusion complex with anticancer drug mitoxantrone in abiotic and biotic systems.&#160;This novel cavitand has a deep nonpolar pocket consisting of three naphthalimide sides fused to a bicyclic platform at the bottom while carrying polar glycines at the top. The results of&#160;1H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR),&#160;1H NMR Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer&#160;(CEST), Calorimetry, Hybrid&#160;Replica Exchange Molecular Dynamics (REMD), and&#160;Microcrystal Electron Diffraction&#160;(MicroED) measurements are in line with&#160;1&#160;forming dimer [12]6&#8208;, to be in equilibrium with monomers&#160;1(R)3&#8208;(relaxed) and&#160;1(S)3&#8208;&#160;(squeezed). Through simultaneous line&#8208;shape analysis of&#160;1H NMR data, kinetic and thermodynamic parameters characterizing these equilibria were quantified.&#160;Basket&#160;1(R)3&#8208;&#160;includes anticancer drug mitoxantrone (MTO2+) in its pocket to give stable binary complex [MTO&#204;1]&#160;&#8211;&#160;(Kd&#160;= 2.1&#160;mM).&#160;Both&#160;in vitro&#160;and&#160;in vivo&#160;studies showed that the basket is nontoxic, while at a higher proportion with respect to MTO it reduced its cytotoxicity&#160;in vitro.&#160;With well&#8208;characterized internal dynamics and dimerization, the ability to include mitoxantrone, and biocompatibility, the stage is set to develop&#160;sequestering agents from&#160;deep&#8208;cavity baskets.</dc:description>

         <title>Rational Design, Multistep Synthesis and in Vitro Evaluation of Poly(glycerol) Functionalized Nanodiamond Conjugated with Boron&#8208;10 Cluster and Active Targeting Moiety for Boron Neutron Capture Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Good anticancer activity is realized upon neutron irradiation by boron neutron capture therapy using 10B cluster&#8208;based nanodrugs. They consist of nanodiamonds and poly(glycerol&#8208;co&#8208;glyceric acid) conjugated by a 10B source (sodium borocaptate) and active targeting moiety (phenyl boronic acid or RGD peptide) through a multi&#8208;step organic transformation. Their cellular uptake might be facilitated by the negative charge of the boron cluster. More information can be found in the Research Article by M. Nishikawa, N. Komatsu, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202302073).

         <title>Highly Enantioselective Synthesis of Pharmaceuticals at Chiral&#8208;Encoded Metal Surfaces</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanostructured mesoporous Pt&#8208;Ir alloys, illustrated by the tunnel entrances, have been successfully developed as heterogeneous catalysts for the asymmetric synthesis of pharmaceutical compounds. These findings, reported by C. Wattanakit, A. Kuhn, and co&#8208;workers in the Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202302054), illustrate that these designer materials allow the enantioselective hydrogenation of adrenalone to produce the desired epinephrine stereoisomer with up to 95&#8201;% enantiomeric excess.

         <dc:description>
Checkmate! Metastable connections of AgII and sulfate dianions have so far been limited to a quasi&#8208;binary one&#8208;dimensional antiferromagnet, AgSO4. Preparation of Cu[Ag(SO4)2], the first member of the MII[Ag(SO4)2] series, paves the way towards strongly coupled two&#8208;dimensional antiferromagnets with a chessboard&#8208;like spin arrangement within [Ag(SO4)2]2&#8211; sublattice.

         <title>Herringbone Helical Foldamers from Aromatic Ether Derived &#1013;&#8208;Amino Acid Peptides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new type of herringbone helical foldamer based on a non&#8208;natural codon, i.&#8201;e., aromatic ether derived &#1013;&#8208;amino acid, was designed, synthesized and characterized. Attaching a single stereogenic carbon at the C&#8208;termini of the peptides induced single&#8208;handed screw sense, which was amplified through chain propagation.







Abstract
Oligomers based on an aromatic ether derived &#1013;&#8208;amino acid peptides folded into herringbone helical structures, induced by successive NH&#8722;O&#8722;NH &amp; O&#8722;NH&#8722;O bifurcated hydrogen bonding interactions and reinforced by &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking between aryls from adjacent layers. The diaryl ether bonds &#8722;O&#8722; worked both as structural units to provide turn motifs for changing the amplitude of the slope along the axis of helix for herringbone formation, and also as acceptors for hydrogen bonding. Attachment of a single chiral carbon to the C&#8208;termini of the peptides induced excess of single&#8208;handed screw sense and amplification through the chain propagation as exemplified by chain length dependent circular dichroism (CD) investigations.

         <title>2D Covalent Organic Frameworks with Kagome Lattice: Synthesis and Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Representative synthetic approaches and applications of 2D kgm COFs are summarized in this Review. The specific pore structure of kgm topology exhibits unique superiority in selective adsorption, mass diffusion, and exciton migration, which will facilitate the development and provide more opportunities for 2D COFs.







Abstract
2D covalent organic frameworks with Kagome (kgm) topology are a promising class of crystalline frameworks that possess both triangular and hexagonal pores. These dual&#8208;pore structures enable kgm COFs to exhibit unique advantages in selective separation, mass transfer, and targeted drug release. However, the synthesis of 2D kgm COFs has been hindered by the reliance on empirical methods. This review systematically summarizes the conventional macrocycle&#8208;to&#8208;framework strategy, typical [4+2] co&#8208;polymerization synthetic strategy, and bifunctional molecules self&#8208;condensation approach for constructing 2D kgm COFs. Factors influencing the formation of kgm lattice are surveyed, such as monomer type, solvent polarity, substrate concentration, etc., and highlight the representative examples on targeted synthesis. Additionally, applications of 2D kgm COFs and relationships between structure and performances are summarized. Finally, key fundamental perspectives are proposed to accelerate the further development of this intriguing material.

         <title>Quantitative Assessment of Crystallinity and Stability in &#946;&#8208;Ketoenamine&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel quantitative method has been established to quantitatively assess the stability of COFs by utilizing two crystallinity&#8208;dependent parameters, I4.6rel and A4.6rel, from the analysis of PXRD profiles. By employing this method, the stabilities of KEA&#8208;COFs have been thoroughly investigated, offering valuable information that goes beyond qualitative descriptions.







Abstract
The design and synthesis of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with high chemical stability pose significant challenges for practical applications. Although a growing number of robust COFs have been developed and employed for a broad scope of applications, the assessment of COF stability has primarily relied on qualitative descriptions, lacking a rational and quantitative assessment. Herein, a novel assessment method is presented that enables visual and quantitative depiction of COF stability. By analyzing the PXRD patterns of chemically stable &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine&#8208;based COFs (KEA&#8208;COFs), two crystallinity&#8208;dependent parameters are identified, the relative intensity (I2&#952;rel) and the relative area (A2&#952;rel) of the main peak (2&#952;), which are expected to establish a standardized criterion for assessing COF crystallinity. Based on these parameters, the crystalline changes after stability tests can be visually presented, which provides a rational and quantitative assessment of their stability. This study not only demonstrates the remarkable chemical stability of KEA&#8208;COFs, but also provides valuable insights into the quantitative evaluation of COFs&#8217; crystallinity and stability.

         <title>Is Enol Always the Culprit? The Curious Case of High Enantioselectivity in a Chiral Rh(II) Complex Catalyzed Carbene Insertion Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Acquitting enol of all charges: The reaction mechanism and stereoselectivity of a Rh(II) catalyzed indole alkylation reaction with in&#8197;situ generated carbenes are investigated. The reaction proceeds via a novel metal&#8208;associated enol pathway and not via a previously reported metal&#8208;free/oxocarbenium route.







Abstract
The mechanism of Rh2(S&#8208;NTTL)4 catalyzed carbene insertion into C(3)&#8722;H of indole is investigated using DFT methods. Since the commonly accepted enol mechanism cannot account for enantioinduction, a concerted oxocarbenium pathway was proposed in an earlier work using a model catalyst. However, after considering the full catalytic system, this study finds that akin to other reactions, here, too, the enol pathway is of lower energy, which now naturally raises a conundrum regarding the mode of chiral induction. Herein, a new water promoted mechanistic pathway involving a metal&#8208;associated enol intermediate hydrogen bonding and stereochemical model are proposed to solve this puzzle. It is shown how the catalyst bowl&#8208;shaped structure along with substrate&#8208;catalyst binding is crucial for achieving high levels of enantioselectivity. A stereodetermining water&#8208;assisted proton transfer is proposed and confirmed through deuterium&#8208;labeling experiments. The water molecules are held together by H&#8208;bonding interactions with the carboxylate ligands that is reminiscent of enzyme catalysis. Although several previous studies have aimed at understanding the mechanism of metal catalyzed carbene insertion reactions, the origin of high stereoinduction especially with chiral metal complexes remains unclear, and till date there is no transition state model that can explain the high enantioselectivity with such chiral Rh complexes. The metal&#8208;associated enol pathway is currently underrepresented in catalytic cycles and may play a crucial role in catalyst design. Since the enol pathway is commonly adopted in other metal&#8208;catalyzed X&#8722;H insertion reactions involving a diazoester, the presented results are not specific to the current reaction. Therefore, this study could provide the direction for achieving high levels of enantioselectivity which is otherwise difficult to achieve with a single metal catalyst.

         <title>Planar Hexacoordinate Beryllium: Covalent Bonding Between s&#8211;block Metals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Clusters with covalent bonds: To investigate the potential for planar hypercoordination in s&#8208;block metals, we report a planar hexacoordinate beryllium center in the neutral binary Be&#169;Be6Cl6 cluster. This global minimum is dynamic stabilized and displays the 6&#963;/2&#960; double aromaticity. Interestingly, chemical bonding analysis further highlights a substantial covalent interaction between the ligand beryllium atoms and the central metal beryllium atoms.







Abstract
Achieving a planar hypercoordinate arrangement of s&#8208;block metals through covalent bonding with ligands is challenging due to the strong ionicity involved. Herein, we report the first case of a neutral binary global minimum containing a planar hexacoordinate beryllium atom. The central Be atom is coordinated by six active Be atoms, the latter in turn are enclosed by an equal number of more electronegative chlorine atoms in the periphery, forming a star&#8208;like phBe cluster (Be&#169;Be6Cl6). Importantly, the cluster exhibits dynamically stabilized stemming geometrically from the appropriate matching of metal&#8208;ligand size and electronically from adherence to the octet rule as well as possessing a 6&#963;/2&#960; double aromaticity. Remarkably, energy decomposition analysis&#8208;natural orbitals for chemical valence (EDA&#8208;NOCV) analysis reveals a significant covalent interaction between the ligand and the central metal beryllium atoms, a fact further supported by a large Wiberg bond index. This cluster is a promising synthetic as its excellent electronic, dynamic and thermodynamic stability.

         <title>Catalytic Asymmetric Synthesis of N&#8208;N Biaryl Atropisomers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Atropisomers featuring a restricted rotational axis have emerged as important structural scaffolds in natural products, drug design, and asymmetric synthesis. Recently, N&#8208;N biaryl atropisomers have drawn increasing interest due to their unique structure and relatively stable axes. However, its asymmetric synthesis remains scarce compared to its well&#8208;developed C&#8208;C biaryl analogs. In this concept, we summarize the asymmetric synthesis of N&#8208;N biaryl atropisomers including N&#8208;N pyrrole&#8208;pyrrole, N&#8208;N pyrroleindole, N&#8208;N indole&#8208;indole, and N&#8208;N indole&#8208;carbazole, during which a series synthetic strategies are highlighted. Also, a synthetic evolution is briefly reviewed and an outlook of N&#8208;N biaryl atropisomers synthesis is offered.</dc:description>

         <title>Nucleophilicity of 4&#8208;(Alkylthio)&#8208;3&#8208;imidazoline Derived Enamines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Imidazolidine&#8208;4&#8208;thiones (ITOs) are cyclic, secondary amines that were considered as potential prebiotic organocatalysts for light&#8208;driven &#945;&#8208;alkylations of aldehydes by bromoacetonitrile (BAN). Recent studies showed that the initially supplied ITOs represent the pre&#8208;catalyst because they undergo S&#8208;alkylation with BAN to give 4&#8208;(alkylthio)&#8208;3&#8208;imidazolines (TIMs). Given that the same reagent mix that undergoes light&#8208;driven &#945;&#8208;alkylations is also effective in the dark, we synthesized ten ITO&#8208; or TIM&#8208;derived enamines of aldehydes and characterized their nucleophilic reactivities by kinetic studies in acetonitrile. The experimental second&#8208;order rate constants k2 for reactions of enamines with benzhydrylium ions (reference electrophiles) were evaluated by the Mayr&#8208;Patz equation, lg k2(20&#176;C) = sN(N+E). The determined nucleophilicities N (and sN) reveal the reactivity profiles of these enamines under prebiotically relevant conditions as well as their potential for use in organocatalytic synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Selective Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Isomerization&#8208;Hydroboration of Alkenes Affords Terminal Functionalization at Remote C&#8722;H Position</title>

         <dc:description>
Nickel catalyst: Nickel complexes supported by tridentate and bidentate phosphino(silyl) ligands are effective precatalysts for the hydroboration of terminal and internal alkenes using pinacolborane (HBPin). Isomerization to afford exclusively the terminal hydroboration product was obtained across a range of internal alkenes, including tri&#8208; and tetra&#8208;substituted examples.







Abstract
We report herein the synthesis and characterization of nickel complexes supported by tridentate and bidentate phosphino(silyl) ancillary ligands, along with the successful application of these complexes as precatalysts for the hydroboration of terminal and internal alkenes using pinacolborane (HBPin). These reactions proceeded with low nickel loadings of 2.5&#8208;5&#8197;mol&#8201;% in the absence of co&#8208;solvent, and in some cases at room temperature. Isomerization to afford exclusively the terminal hydroboration product was obtained across a range of internal alkenes, including tri&#8208; and tetra&#8208;substituted examples. This reactivity is unprecedented for nickel and offers a powerful means of achieving functionalization at a C&#8722;H position remote from the C=C double bond. Nickel&#8208;catalyzed deuteroboration experiments using DBPin support a mechanism involving 1,2&#8208;insertion of the alkene and subsequent chain&#8208;walking, which results in isotopic scrambling.

         <title>Cation Adaptive Structures Based on Manganese Cyanide Prussian Blue Analogues: Application of Powder Diffraction Data to Solve Complex, Unprecedented Stoichiometries and New Structure Types</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New extended structure types and unprecedented stoichiometries form from ionic MnII and ionic cyanides as a consequence of the shape of the cyanide cation that have applications as molecule&#8208;based magnets and batteries.







Abstract
A Mn(II) salt and A+CN&#8722; under anaerobic conditions react to form 2&#8208;D and 3&#8208;D extended structured compounds of AmMnIIn(CN)m+2n stoichiometry. Here, the creation and characterization of this large family of compounds, for example AMnII3(CN)7, A2MnII3(CN)8, A2MnII5(CN)12, A3MnII5(CN)13, and A2MnII[MnII(CN)6], where A represents alkali and tetraalkylammonium cations, is reviewed. Cs2MnII[MnII(CN)6] has the typical Prussian blue face centered cubic unit cell. However, the other alkali salts are monoclinic or rhombohedral. This is in accord with smaller alkali cation radii creating void space that is minimized by increasing the van der Waals stabilization energy by reducing &#8736;Mn&#8722;N&#8801;C, which, strengthens the magnetic coupling and increases the magnetic ordering temperatures. This is attributed to the non&#8208;rigidity of the framework structure due the significant ionic character associated with the high&#8208;spin MnII sites. For larger tetraalkylammonium cations, the high&#8208;spin Mn sites lack sufficient electrostatic A+&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;NC stabilization and form unexpected 4&#8208; and 5&#8208;coordinated Mn sites within a flexible, extended framework around the cation; hence, the size, shape, and charge of the cation dictate the unprecedented stoichio&#8208;metry and unpredictable cation adaptive structures. Antiferromagnetic coupling between adjacent MnII sites leads to ferrimagnetic ordering, but in some cases antiferromagnetic coupling of ferrimagnetic layers are compensated and synthetic antiferromagnets are observed. The magnetic ordering temperatures for ferrimagnetic A2MnII[MnII(CN)6] with both octahedral high&#8208; and low&#8208;spin MnII sites increase with decreasing &#8736;Mn&#8722;N&#8801;C. The crystal structures for all of the extended structured materials were obtained by powder diffraction.

&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;(CN)&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;, A&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;(CN)&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt;, and A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;[Mn&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;(CN)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;], where A represents alkali and tetraalkylammonium cations, is reviewed. Cs&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;[Mn&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;(CN)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;] has the typical Prussian blue face centered cubic unit cell. However, the other alkali salts are monoclinic or rhombohedral. This is in accord with smaller alkali cation radii creating void space that is minimized by increasing the van der Waals stabilization energy by reducing &#8736;Mn&#8722;N&#8801;C, which, strengthens the magnetic coupling and increases the magnetic ordering temperatures. This is attributed to the non-rigidity of the framework structure due the significant ionic character associated with the high-spin Mn&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; sites. For larger tetraalkylammonium cations, the high-spin Mn sites lack sufficient electrostatic A&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;NC stabilization and form unexpected 4- and 5-coordinated Mn sites within a flexible, extended framework around the cation; hence, the size, shape, and charge of the cation dictate the unprecedented stoichio-metry and unpredictable cation adaptive structures. Antiferromagnetic coupling between adjacent Mn&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; sites leads to ferrimagnetic ordering, but in some cases antiferromagnetic coupling of ferrimagnetic layers are compensated and synthetic antiferromagnets are observed. The magnetic ordering temperatures for ferrimagnetic A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;[Mn&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;(CN)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;] with both octahedral high- and low-spin Mn&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; sites increase with decreasing &#8736;Mn&#8722;N&#8801;C. The crystal structures for all of the extended structured materials were obtained by powder diffraction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Freestanding 3D Skeleton with Gradationally Distributed Lithiophilic Sites for Realizing Stable Lithium Anodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Towards stable Li metal anode: Lithiophilic ZnO with a gradient distribution was embedded onto a 3D carbon nanotube@carbon felt (CNT@CF) substrate, which served as a scaffold for constructing a stable Li metal anode, to prepare a ZnO/CNT@CF&#8722;Li electrode with an inverted structure via electrodeposition. Owing to the synergistic effect of Li metal and the lithiophilic LiZn alloy, the composite electrode with an inverted structure drove Li+ deposition toward the interior of the skeleton. Moreover, the composite electrode moderately prevented Li+ accumulation on the skeleton surface, thereby improving battery safety. Consequently, the ZnO/CNT@CF&#8722;Li anode performed well in both symmetric and full&#8208;cell setups.







Abstract
Lithium (Li) metal anodes are drawing considerable attention owing to their ultrahigh theoretical capacities and low electrochemical reduction potentials. However, their commercialization has been hampered by safety hazards induced by continuous dendrite growth. These issues can be alleviated using the ZnO&#8208;modified 3D carbon&#8208;based host containing carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and carbon felt (CF) fabricated by electroplating in the present study (denoted as ZnO/CNT@CF). The constructed skeleton has lithiophilic ZnO that is gradationally distributed along its thickness. The utilization of an inverted ZnO/CNT@CF&#8722;Li anode obtained by flipping over the carbon skeleton after Li electrodeposition is also reported herein. The synergistic effect of the Li metal and lithiophilic sites reduces the nucleation overpotential, thus inducing Li+ to preferentially deposit inside the porous carbon&#8208;based scaffold. The composite electrode compels Li to grow away from the separator, thereby significantly improving battery safety. A symmetric cell with the inverted ZnO/CNT@CF&#8722;Li electrode operates steadily for 700&#8197;cycles at 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 1&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Moreover, the ZnO/CNT@CF&#8722;Li|S cell exhibits an initial areal capacity of 10.9&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at a S loading of 10.4&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and maintains a capacity of 3.0&#8197;mAh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 after 320&#8197;cycles.

         <title>Isolation of (Aryl)&#8208;(Imino) Phosphide and (Aryl)&#8208;(Phosphaalkene) Amide Complexes of Alkali Metals from Carbene&#8208;Phosphinidenes under Reductive&#8208;Thermal Rearrangements</title>

         <dc:description>
Carbene&#8208;anchored chloro&#8208;phosphinidenes have undergone unprecedented rearrangements under reductive&#8208;thermal conditions in the presence of alkali metals to afford the corresponding (aryl)&#8208;(imino)phosphide and (phosphaalkene)amide complexes. The former proved to be an excellent precursor for a novel chelating ligand with dual PN&#8208;donor sites, which provided direct synthetic routes for CuI4, AgI8 clusters, and cyclic alkyl(aminoboryl) phoshaalkenes.







Abstract
Two&#8208;electron reduction of cyclic alkyl(amino) carbene (cAAC)&#8208;supported chloro&#8208;phosphinidene cAAC=P&#8722;Cl (1) followed by unprecedented thermal rearrangements afforded the alkali metal complexes of (aryl)&#8208;(cyclic alkyl(imino)) phosphides 3&#8201;a&#8211;3&#8201;c, 4&#8201;a&#8211;4&#8201;b through migration of the 2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl (dipp) group from N to the P centre, and the (aryl)&#8208;(cyclic alkyl(phosphaalkene)) amide 5 through cleavage of the CMe2&#8722;N bond followed by energetically favoured 5&#8208;exo&#8208;tet ring&#8208;closure in the presence of the alkali metals Cs (3&#8201;a&#8211;3&#8201;c), K (4&#8201;a, 4&#8201;b), and Li (5). Compound 3&#8201;a was found to be photoluminescent (PL), emitting bright orange light under a laboratory UV lamp of wavelength 365&#8197;nm with PL quantum yield (&#981;PL) of 2.6&#8201;% (&#955;em=600&#8197;nm), and an average lifetime (&#964;) of 4.8&#8197;&#956;s. Reaction of 3&#8201;a with CuCl and AgOTf afforded (aryl)&#8208;(cyclic alkyl(imino)) phosphide&#8208;stabilized tetra&#8208;nuclear CuI (6), and octa&#8208;nuclear AgI (7) clusters, respectively. Moreover, complexes 3&#8201;a&#8211;3&#8201;c provided a direct route for the stabilization of cyclic alkyl(aminoboryl) phosphaalkenes 8&#8201;a&#8208;8&#8201;c when treated with 1&#8208;bromo&#8208;N,N,N&#8242;,N&#8242;&#8208;tetraisopropylboranediamine.

         <title>Atroposelective NiII&#8208;Catalyzed Cross&#8208;Coupling Reactions Enable a Deeper Understanding of Negishi Couplings: Isolation and Application of Solid Aryl Higher&#8208;Order Zincates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Initial experimental findings during optimization of a NiII&#8208;catalyzed atroposelective Negishi cross&#8208;coupling reaction revealed the importance of higher&#8208;order zincates as the transmetallating active species. An easy synthesis procedure for such zincates was developed and applied to a variety of potentially useful solid monoaryl higher&#8208;order zincates. Finally, the advantages of these reagents in different cross&#8208;coupling reactions were exemplified.







Abstract
The Negishi cross&#8208;coupling reactions involves the application of organozinc reagents and is a highly versatile reaction in synthetic organic chemistry. The transmetallation step plays a pivotal role in the mechanism of these types of cross&#8208;coupling reactions. In this study, mechanistic investigations are presented indicating that higher&#8208;order zincates are the transmetallating active species in Pd&#8208; and Ni&#8208;catalyzed Negishi cross&#8208;coupling reactions. These findings are supported by halide salt addition experiments and by obtaining a single X&#8208;ray crystal structure of the solid monoaryl higher&#8208;order zincate [1&#8208;NaphthylZnX3]2&#8722;Mg(THF)22+. The procedure developed in this work was further applied to the synthesis of various monoaryl higher&#8208;order zincates, after which their synthetic usefulness in terms of high reactivity towards transmetallation in Negishi cross&#8208;couplings, as well as stability, was exemplified in several reactions.

         <title>The Challenging World of Simple Inorganic Rings: Revisiting Roesky's Ketone and Roesky's Sulfoxide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Performing Molecular Orbital calculations on unsaturated sulfur&#8208;nitrogen rings remains a challenging task. One particular unresolved issue was the large difference between the experimental solid&#8208;state geometries and the gas&#8208;phase geometries of two five&#8208;membered ring systems, calculated by a variety of methods including DFT, MP4(SDQ) and CCSD(T). New solid&#8208;state and Valence Bond calculations present a partial explanation, even though a full final answer fails to emerge.







Abstract
The surprising differences between the experimental solid&#8208;state and calculated gas&#8208;phase structures of 5&#8208;oxo&#8208;1,3,2,4&#8208;dithiadiazole (Roesky's ketone, 1) and 1&#8208;oxo&#8208;1,2,4,3,5&#8208;trithiadiazole (Roesky's sulfoxide, 2), identified and studied in a series of papers published between 2004 and 2010 but then never satisfactorily explained, have been revisited, making use of the more advanced computational possibilities currently available. The previous calculations&#8217; considerable overestimations of the C&#8722;S and S&#8722;S bond lengths in 1 and 2, respectively, have been partly explained based on the results of periodic calculations and the application of Valence Bond (VB) Theory. In the case of 1, the crystal environment appears to stabilize a structure with a highly polarized C=O bond, which features a C&#8722;S bond with considerable double&#8208;bond character &#8211; an effect which does not exist for the isolated molecule &#8211; explaining the much shorter bond in the solid state. For 2, a similar conclusion can be drawn for the S&#8722;S distance. For both compounds, though, packing effects are not the sole source of the differences: the inability of Density Functional Theory (DFT) to properly deal with the electronic structures of these apparently simple main&#8208;group systems remains a contributing factor.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Stimuli&#8208;Activatable Hybrid Prodrug for the Self&#8208;Immolative Delivery of an Anticancer Agent and Hydrogen Sulfide with Turn&#8208;On Fluorescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Adjuvant drug delivery: Dual&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive thiocarbamate&#8208;based turn&#8208;on fluorogenic prodrug AM&#8208;TCB was developed for the adjuvant delivery of the naphthalimide amine&#8208;based anticancer agent amonafide and the gasotransmitter hydrogen sulfide (H2S). The adjuvant release of H2S helps in ameliorating the anticancer drug&#8208;induced side&#8208;effects.







Abstract
Stimuli&#8208;responsive fluorogenic prodrugs are advantageous for the targeted drug delivery enabling real&#8208;time non&#8208;invasive monitoring with turn&#8208;on fluorescence. We report herein the dual&#8208;stimuli (ROS and CA)&#8208;responsive thiocarbamate&#8208;based prodrug (AM&#8208;TCB) for the turn&#8208;on fluorogenic delivery of the naphthalimide&#8208;based anticancer agent amonafide along with the gasotransmitter hydrogen sulfide (H2S). A carbamate&#8208;based prodrug AM&#8208;CB was also designed, capable of releasing the anticancer agent amonafide without any H2S. The prodrugs were synthesized using multi&#8208;step organic synthesis. UV&#8208;Vis and fluorescence spectroscopic studies revealed selective reactivity of the boronate ester group of prodrugs towards ROS (primarily H2O2) with the release of amonafide and COS/CO2 via self&#8208;immolative processes. Hydrolysis of the generated COS by carbonic anhydrase (CA) produces H2S. While the prodrug AM&#8208;TCB retained the anticancer activity of free amonafide in cancer cells (MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 and HeLa), unlike amonafide, it enhanced the cellular viability of the non&#8208;malignant cells (HEK&#8208;293). Fluorescence imaging in HeLa cells revealed the simultaneous delivery of the anticancer agent and H2S from AM&#8208;TCB with turn&#8208;on fluorescence. Western blot studies further revealed the cytoprotective effects of the released H2S from AM&#8208;TCB. The present adjuvant strategy therefore would be helpful in future for ameliorating the anticancer drug&#8208;induced side&#8208;effects.

         <title>An Artificial Liposome Compartment with Size Exclusion Molecular Transport</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Artificial compartments with uniform diameters were constructed by using DNA origami as the internal skeleton of a liposome. The interior of the liposome was completely isolated from the external environment. Furthermore, the incorporation of an active membrane protein into the compartment enabled the selective transport of small molecules below 600&#8197;Da.







Abstract
The cellular compartment plays an essential role in organizing the complex and diverse biochemical reactions within the cell. By mimicking the function of such cellular compartments, the challenge of constructing artificial compartments has been taken up to develop new biochemical tools for efficient material production and diagnostics. The important features required for the artificial compartment are that it isolates the interior from the external environment and is further functionalized to control the transport of target chemicals to regulate the interior concentration of both substrate and reaction products. In this study, an artificial compartment with size&#8208;selective molecular transport function was constructed by using a DNA origami&#8208;guided liposome prepared by modifying the method reported by Perrault et&#8197;al. This completely isolates the liposome interior, including the DNA origami skeleton, from the external environment and allows the assembly of a defined number of molecules of interest inside and/or outside the compartment. By incorporating a bacterial membrane protein, OmpF, into the liposome, the resulting artificial compartment was shown to transport only the molecule of interest with a molecular weight below 600&#8197;Da from the external environment into the interior of the compartment.

         <title>Enhancing Gating Performance in Organic Molecular Field&#8208;Effect Transistors by Introducing Polar Azulene Components</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic molecular field&#8208;effect transistors based on naphthalene are redesigned by introducing azulene. Theoretical simulations reveal that such modification effectively increases the ON&#8208;state current, while significantly supressing the OFF&#8208;state current. As a result, gate controllability is improved with the ON&#8208;OFF current ratio being enlarged by nearly one order of magnitude.







Abstract
Organic molecular field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs) are promising building components for future electronic circuits. Efficient control of charge transport properties is one key issue in the design of organic molecular FETs. In this study, we propose a redesign of a naphthalene&#8208;based FET by introducing two azulene components in opposite dipole moment directions. Using density functional theory combined with non&#8208;equilibrium Green's function, the simulated electronic transport characteristics reveal that the introduction of polar azulene components effectively narrows the frontier molecular orbitals gap, leading to an increase in the ON&#8208;state current. Meanwhile, the OFF&#8208;state current is significantly suppressed by highly localizing the dominant electronic transport channel. As a result, improved gate controllability is achieved with a higher ON&#8208;OFF current ratio, which is nearly seven times higher than that of the naphthalene&#8208;based FET device. These findings provide theoretical directions for future design of organic molecular FET devices with enhanced gating regulation efficiency.

         <title>Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Addition of Organosulfur Compounds to Alkynes and Alkenes: Catalysis and Catalyst Poisons</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed addition of organosulfur compounds to carbon&#8208;carbon unsaturated bonds has been considered as one of the challenging reactions due to the catalyst poisons. Recently, novel systems have been investigated to suppress the catalyst poisons. This article highlights the pioneering studies on the catalytic addition of organosulfur compounds to alkynes and alkenes and describes their catalysis and catalyst poisons.







Abstract
The addition of heteroatom compounds to alkynes and alkenes is an atom&#8208;efficient method of carbon&#8208;heteroatom bond formation and is widely used as a fundamental synthetic method for the construction of functional molecules. Nevertheless, examples of transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed addition reactions of group&#8197;16 heteroatom compounds to carbon&#8208;carbon unsaturated bonds have been limited due to the widespread belief that organic sulfur and selenium compounds are representative catalyst poisons. In recent decades, however, several seminal catalytic reactions of sulfur compounds have been developed, providing important insights into catalysis and poisons. Therefore, this paper focuses on the transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed addition of organosulfur compounds to alkynes and alkenes, gains comprehensive insights into the catalysis and catalyst poisons, and proposes concepts for the development of transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions of group&#8197;16 heteroatom compounds.

         <title>Synthesis and Additive Manufacturing of Hydrazone&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Framework Aerogels</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fast gelation and crystallization of hydrazone linked COFs enable processing into hierarchically porous aerogels with tunable solvent adsorption properties. Additionally, the fast reaction kinetics facilitate a reactive 3D printing technique with a sacrificial polymer binder to produce 3D printed structures of COF aerogel material.







Abstract
Covalent Organic Frameworks (COFs) are crystalline, porous organic materials. Recent studies have demonstrated novel processing strategies for COFs to form adaptable architectures, but these have focused primarily on imine&#8208;linked COFs. This work presents a new synthesis and processing route to produce crystalline hydrazone&#8208;linked COF gels and aerogels with hierarchical porosity. The method was implemented to produce a series of hydrazone&#8208;linked COFs with different alkyl side&#8208;chain substituents, achieving control of the hydrophilicity of the final aerogel. Variation in the length of the alkyl substituents yielded materials with controllable form factors that can preferentially adsorb water or nonpolar organic solvents. Additionally, a method for additive manufacturing of hydrazone&#8208;linked COFs using hydroxymethylcellulose as a sacrificial additive is presented. This work demonstrates an effective and simple approach to the fabrication of hydrazone COF aerogels and additive manufacturing to produce hydrazone COFs of desired shape.

         <title>Nickel Phosphonate MOF Derived N&#8208;Doped Carbon&#8208;Coated Phosphorus&#8208;Vacancies&#8208;Rich Ni2P Particles as Efficient Bifunctional Oxygen Electrocatalyst</title>

Bifunctional OER catalyst: N&#8208;doped carbon&#8208;coated phosphorus&#8208;rich vacancies Ni2P particles (Vp&#8208;Ni2P@NC) was proposed via simple carbonization and following Ar plasma treatment from a single nickel phosphonate metal&#8211;organic framework. The resultant Vp&#8208;Ni2P@NC catalyst showed excellent bifunctional oxygen electrocatalytic activity, more advantageous &#916;E value (Ej=10&#8722;E1/2) and good long&#8208;term stability based on synergistic effect of introducing P vacancies into Ni2P and N&#8208;doped carbon.







Abstract
The design of non&#8208;noble metal bifunctional electrocatalysts with outstanding performance and remarkable stability for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is one of the most essential issues to the realization of rechargeable zinc&#8208;air battery, and transition metal phosphides (TMPs) have emerged as robust candidates for oxygen electrocatalysts. Herein, N&#8208;doped carbon&#8208;coated phosphorus&#8208;vacancies&#8208;rich Ni2P particles (Vp&#8208;Ni2P@NC) is proposed via simple carbonization and following Ar plasma treatment from a single nickel phosphonate metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) without extra phosphine and nitrogen sources. The facile and rapid plasma treatment can achieve phosphorus vacancies which could modulate the electronic structure to enhance the inherent active and electrical conductivity. Meanwhile, the pyridine&#8208;N and graphitized&#8208;N produced during calcination also could provide more active sites and increase the electrical conductivity. The resultant Vp&#8208;Ni2P@NC catalyst shows excellent bifunctional electrocatalytic activity (OER/ORR) based on synergistic effect of introducing P vacancies into Ni2P and N&#8208;doped carbon. Vp&#8208;Ni2P@NC catalyst shows more advantageous &#916;E value (0.70&#8197;V) compared to Pt/C+RuO2 (0.73&#8197;V) and most reported catalysts. Additionally, the zinc&#8208;air bbatterie (ZAB) employing Vp&#8208;Ni2P@NC as air cathode shows excellent performance. The maximum power density of 203.48&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2, the cycling stability of more than 150&#8197;h at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Biasing the Formation of Solution&#8208;Unstable Intermediates in Coordination Self&#8208;Assembly by Mechanochemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A solvent&#8208;free ball&#8208;mill approach is developed to modulate coordination self&#8208;assembly energy landscapes, allowing access to self&#8208;assembly intermediates in the solid state that are too short&#8208;lived to be observed in traditional solution&#8208;based approaches.







Abstract
Due to the reversible nature of coordination bonds and solvation effect, coordination self&#8208;assembly pathways are often difficult to elucidate experimentally in solution, as intermediates and products are in constant equilibration. The present study shows that some of these transient and high&#8208;energy self&#8208;assembly intermediates can be accessed by means of ball&#8208;milling approaches. Among them, highly aqueous&#8208;unstable Pd3L11 and Pd6L14 open&#8208;cage intermediates of the framed Fujita Pd6L14 cage and Pd2L22, Pd3L21 and Pd4L22 intermediates of Mukherjee Pd6L24 capsule are successfully trapped in solid&#8208;state, where Pd=tmedaPd2+, L1=2,4,6&#8208;tris(4&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine and L2=1,3,5&#8208;tris(1&#8208;imidazolyl)benzene). Their structures are assigned by a combination of solution&#8208;based characterization tools such as standard NMR spectroscopy, DOSY&#8197;NMR, ESI&#8208;MS and X&#8208;ray diffraction. Collectively, these results highlight the opportunity of using mechanochemistry to access unique chemical space with vastly different reactivity compared to conventional solution&#8208;based supramolecular self&#8208;assembly reactions.

         <title>NIR Light&#8208;Activated and RGD&#8208;Conjugated Ultrasmall Fe/PPy Nanopolymers for Enhanced Tumor Photothermal Ferrotherapy and MR Imaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile approach has been developed for preparation of the RGD&#8208;conjugated ultrasmall Fe/PPy nanopolymers for enhanced tumor photothermal ferrotherapy and MR imaging. Under irradiation with NIR light, the heat generated by Fe/PPy&#8208;RGD not only induced a therapeutic photothermal effect but also enhanced the Fenton reaction by inducing ferroptosis. This synergetic photothermal ferrotherapeutic effect greatly improved the efficiency of tumor treatment.







Abstract
Iron&#8208;based nanomaterials have shown great promise for tumor ferrotherapy in recent years. However, nanoparticle&#8208;induced ferroptosis has low therapeutic efficacy owing to unsatisfactory Fenton reaction activity in a typical tumor microenvironment. In this study, NIR light&#8208;activated Fe/PPy&#8208;RGD nanopolymers were developed to combine photothermal therapy and ferrotherapy and achieve enhanced antitumor activity. Importantly, Fe/PPy&#8208;RGD exhibited excellent therapeutic performance under NIR light activation both in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo. Under irradiation with NIR light, the heat generated by Fe/PPy&#8208;RGD not only induced a therapeutic photothermal effect but also enhanced the release of iron ions and the Fenton reaction by inducing ferroptosis. Additionally, by virtue of RGD conjugation and its ultrasmall size, Fe/PPy&#8208;RGD could effectively accumulate at tumor sites in living mice after systemic administration and could be monitored via MR imaging. Hence, this study provides a promising approach for integrating ferrotherapy with photothermal therapy to achieve enhanced tumor treatment.

         <title>The Facile Hydrolysis of Imidazolinium Chlorides (N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Precursors) Under Basic Aqueous Conditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hydrolysis of imidazolinium chlorides takes place readily in a basic water/dichloromethane biphasic mixture at room temperature. Experimental conditions were optimized to afford full conversions and high yields of &#947;&#8208;aminoformamides starting from symmetrical or unsymmetrical substrates. Structural parameters that affect the resilience of these important NHC precursors in the presence of moisture were investigated. In particular, the critical influence of the counteranion was highlighted.







Abstract
The hydrolysis of imidazolinium chlorides takes place readily in a basic water/dichloromethane biphasic mixture at room temperature. Experimental parameters were optimized to afford full conversions and high yields of &#947;&#8208;aminoformamides starting from twelve symmetrical substrates with alkyl or aryl substituents on their nitrogen atoms, and five unsymmetrical 1&#8208;alkyl&#8208;3&#8208;arylimidazolinium chlorides. NMR and XRD analyses showed that the cleavage of unsymmetrical salts led to &#947;&#8208;alkylamino&#8208;N&#8208;arylformamides with a high regioselectivity and that bulky alkyl or aryl groups on the formamide moiety led to the isolation of the (E)&#8208;isomer in high stereoisomeric purity (&gt;95&#8201;%), whereas smaller and more flexible alkyl substituents afforded mixtures of (E)&#8208; and (Z)&#8208;rotamers. Control experiments showed that the hydrolysis of 1,3&#8208;dimesitylimidazolinium chloride (SIMes&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;HCl) did not occur readily in pure or acidic water and that the presence of bulky aromatic substituents on the nitrogen atoms of 1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazolinium chloride (SIDip&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;HCl) efficiently slowed down its hydrolysis under basic aqueous conditions. Most strikingly, this work highlighted the critical influence of the counteranion on the reactivity of imidazolinium cations. Indeed, the chloride salts underwent a facile hydrolysis in the presence of water and Na2CO3, whereas various other NHC&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;HX derivatives reacted much slower or remained essentially inert under these conditions.

         <title>NHC&#8208;Stabilized Dialanes(4) of Al2Mes4</title>

NHC&#8208;stabilized dialanes(4). Synthesis and reactivity of mono&#8208; or bis&#8208;NHC&#8208;stabilized dialanes(4) (NHC)&#8901;Al2Mes4 and (NHC)2&#8901;Al2Mes4 are reported. These compounds reveal relatively long Al&#8722;Al bonds according to their XRD structures, which was verified by DFT calculations. QTAIM analysis on (IMeMe)2&#8901;Al2Mes4 7 revealed non&#8208;nuclear attractors (NNA) along the aluminum aluminum vector. First reactivity studies on (IMeMe)2&#8901;Al2Mes4 7 demonstrate that NHC&#8208;ligated dialanes are thermally robust and storable synthons for the dialane(4) Al2Mes4. The synthesis of (IMeMe)&#8901;AlClMes2 10, {(IMeMe)&#8901;AlMes2}2&#8208;E (E=O 11, S 12), and the dimetallaacetylide {(IMeMe)&#8901;AlMes2}2&#8208;&#956;&#8208;(C&#8801;C) 13 is reported starting from 7.







Abstract
The synthesis and characterization of novel N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) stabilized dialanes Al2Mes4 as well as first investigations concerning the reactivity of these compounds are reported. The synthesis of these compounds proceeds via the mesityl&#8208;substituted alanes (NHC)&#8901;AlHMes2 (NHC=IMeMe{=1,3,4,5&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene}, IiPrMe {=1,3&#8208;di&#8208;iso&#8208;propyl&#8208;4,5&#8208;dimethylimidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene}) and iodo&#8208;alanes (NHC)&#8901;AlIMes2 (NHC=IMeMe, IiPrMe). Metallic reduction of (NHC)&#8901;AlIMes2 afforded the new NHC&#8208;stabilized dialanes (NHC)2&#8901;Al2Mes4 (NHC=IMeMe, IiPrMe). The NHC&#8208;ligated dialanes are thermally robust and storable synthons for the dialane Al2Mes4. First reactivity studies on (IMeMe)2&#8901;Al2Mes4 towards small molecules confirm this, as this compound shows controlled and selective reactions with several substrates. Reaction with CuCl leads to oxidation of the dialane and formation of (IMeMe)&#8901;AlClMes2, reactions with pyridine N&#8208;oxide and tBu&#8722;N=C=S, respectively, gave the chalcogenide&#8208;bridged dimers {(IMeMe)&#8901;AlMes2}2&#8208;&#956;&#8208;E (E=O, S), and reaction with acetylene afforded the dimetallaacetylide {(IMeMe)&#8901;AlMes2}2&#8208;&#956;&#8208;(C&#8801;C).

         <title>Synthesis of Hypervalent Iodine Diazo Compounds and Their Application in Organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hypervalent iodine diazo reagents with electron&#8208;withdrawing groups (EWG) connected to diazo methyl center were a type of donor&#8208;acceptor diazo compounds with potential reaction abilities similar to ordinary diazo compounds. Although several hypervalent iodine diazo reagents were synthesized and used in the nucleophilic substitution reactions as early as 1994, the synthesis and application of new iodine(III) diazo reagents have only been reported to a certain extent in recent years. In the presence of rhodium catalyst, photocatalyst, or nucleophiles, hypervalent iodine diazo reagents can be converted into rhodium&#8208;carbenes, diazomethyl radicals, ester radicals or nucleophilic intermediates, which can be used as key intermediates for the formation of chemical bonds. The aim of this review is to give an overview of hypervalent iodine diazo compounds in organic synthesis.</dc:description>

Both biomimetic gelators can form self&#8208;healing and shape&#8208;persistent gels with a very low critical gelator concentration in water as well as in various organic solvents, indicating they are ambidextrous supergelators. Detailed spectroscopic studies suggested &#946;&#8208;sheet secondary structure formation during anisotropic self&#8208;aggregation of the gelators which resulted in the formation of hierarchical left&#8208;handed helical fibers in acetone with an interlayer spacing of 2.4 nm.&#160; After the physical characterization of the gels, serum protein interaction with the gelators was assessed, indicating they may be ideal for biomedical applications. Further, both gelators are benign, non&#8208;immunogenic, non&#8208;allergenic, and non&#8208;toxic in nature, which was confirmed by performing the blood parameters and liver function tests on Wister rats. Streptomycin&#8208;loaded hydrogels showed efficacious antibacterial activity in vitro and in vivo as well. Finally, cell attachment and biocompatibility of the hydrogels were demonstrated which opens a newer avenue for promising biomedical and therapeutic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Late&#8208;stage C&#8722;H Activation of Drug (Derivative) Molecules with Pd(ll) Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This review comprehensively analyses representative examples of Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed late&#8208;stage C&#8722;H activation reactions and demonstrates their efficacy in converting C&#8722;H bonds at multiple positions within drug (derivative) molecules into diverse functional groups. These transformative reactions hold immense potential in medicinal chemistry, enabling the efficient and selective functionalization of specific sites within drug molecules, thereby enhancing their pharmacological activity and expanding the scope of potential drug candidates. Although notable articles have focused on late&#8208;stage C&#8722;H functionalization reactions of drug&#8208;like molecules using transition&#8208;metal catalysts, reviews specifically focusing on late&#8208;stage C&#8722;H functionalization reactions of drug (derivative) molecules using Pd(II) catalysts are required owing to their prominence as the most widely utilized metal catalysts for C&#8722;H activation and their ability to introduce a myriad of functional groups at specific C&#8722;H bonds. The utilization of Pd&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation methodologies demonstrates impressive success in introducing various functional groups, such as cyano (CN), fluorine (F), chlorine (Cl), aromatic rings, olefin, alkyl, alkyne, and hydroxyl groups, to drug (derivative) molecules with high regioselectivity and functional&#8208;group tolerance. These breakthroughs in late&#8208;stage C&#8722;H activation reactions serve as invaluable tools for drug discovery and development, thereby offering strategic options to optimize drug candidates and drive the exploration of innovative therapeutic solutions.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The fluorobasic character of the strong oxidative fluorinator, XeF6, and the oxidative resistance of the [XeF5]+ and [Xe2F11]+ cations have been exploited for the syntheses of several novel Cr(VI) dianions. The reactions of XeF6 and CrO2F2 in anhydrous HF and in melts by direct fusion of the reactants yielded the first dinuclear Cr(VI) oxyfluoro&#8208;dianion salts, [XeF5]2[Cr2O4F6], [XeF5]2[Cr2O4F6]&#8729;4HF, [XeF5]2[Cr2O4F6]&#8729;2XeOF4, and mononuclear Cr(VI) oxyfluoro&#8208;dianion salt, [XeF5][Xe2F11][CrO2F4]. The salts were structurally characterized by low&#8208;temperature (LT) single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) and LT Raman spectroscopy. The [CrO2F4]2&#8722; and [Cr2O4F6]2&#8722; dianions have distorted octahedral cis&#8208;dioxo Cr(VI) coordination spheres in which two F&#8208;atoms are trans to one another and two F&#8208;atoms are trans to O&#8208;atoms. The [Cr2O4F6]2&#8722; dianion is the fluorine&#8208;bridged dimer of the [CrO2F3]&#8722; anion. Quantum&#8208;chemical (QC) calculations were used to obtain the energy&#8208;minimized, gas&#8208;phase geometries, and the calculated vibrational spectra of the gas&#8208;phase dianions and their ion&#8208;pairs which were used to aid in the vibrational frequency assignments of the crystalline salts. NBO and MEPS analyses and SCXRD show these salts are intimate ion&#8208;pairs in which their cations and anions interact through primarily electrostatic Xe&#8208;&#8208;&#8208;F &#963;&#8208;hole bonds.</dc:description>

         <title>Carbodiimide and Isocyanate Hydroboration by a Cyclic Carbodiphosphorane Catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report hydroboration of carbodiimide and isocyanate substrates catalyzed by a cyclic carbodiphosphorane catalyst. The cyclic carbodiphosphorane outperformed the other Lewis basic carbon species tested, including other zerovalent carbon compounds, phosphorus ylides, an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene, and an N&#8208;heterocyclic olefin. Hydroborations of seven carbodiimides and nine isocyanates were performed at room temperature to form N&#8208;boryl formamidine and N&#8208;boryl formamide products. Intermolecular competition experiments demonstrated the selective hydroboration of alkyl isocyanates over carbodiimide and ketone substrates. DFT calculations support a proposed mechanism involving activation of pinacolborane by the carbodiphosphorane catalyst, followed by hydride transfer and B&#8211;N bond formation.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Evaluation of Glycosyl Luciferins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Measuring glycosidase activity is important to monitor any aberrations in carbohydrate hydrolase activity, but also for the screening of potential glycosidase inhibitors. To this end, synthetic substrates are needed which provide an enzyme&#8208;dependent read&#8208;out upon hydrolysis by the glycosidase. Herein, we present two new routes for the synthesis of caged luminescent carbohydrates, which can be used for determining glycosidase activity with a luminescent reporter molecule. The substrates were validated with glycosidase and revealed a clear linear range and enzyme&#8208;dependent signal upon in situ generation of the luciferin moiety from the corresponding nitrile precursors. Besides, we showed that these compounds could directly be synthesized from unprotected glycosyl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;fluorides in a two&#8208;step procedure with yields up to 75%. The intermediate methyl imidate appeared a key intermediate which also reacted with d&#8208;cysteine to give the corresponding d&#8208;luciferin substrate rendering this a highly attractive method for synthesizing glycosyl luciferins in good yields.</dc:description>

         <title>Silicon&#8208; and Germanium&#8208;Functionalized Perylene Diimides: Synthesis, Optoelectronic Properties, and Their Application as Non&#8208;fullerene Acceptors in Organic Solar Cells</title>

In with the old: Perylene diimide, one of the oldest electron acceptors, was functionalized with group&#8197;14 elements in the bay position. The influence of these substitutions on their properties and performance in organic photovoltaics was thoroughly studied.







Abstract
Organic solar cells have been continuously studied and developed through the last decades. A major step in their development was the introduction of fused&#8208;ring non&#8208;fullerene electron acceptors. Yet, beside their high efficiency, they suffer from complex synthesis and stability issues. Perylene&#8208;based non&#8208;fullerene acceptors, in contrast, can be prepared in only a few steps and display good photochemical and thermal stability. Herein, we introduce four monomeric perylene diimide acceptors obtained in a three&#8208;step synthesis. In these molecules, the semimetals silicon and germanium were added in the bay position, on one or both sides of the molecules, resulting in asymmetric and symmetric compounds with a red&#8208;shifted absorption compared to unsubstituted perylene diimide. Introducing two germanium atoms improved the crystallinity and charge carrier mobility in the blend with the conjugated polymer PM6. In addition, charge carrier separation is significantly influenced by the high crystallinity of this blend, as shown by transient absorption spectroscopy. As a result, the solar cells reached a power conversion efficiency of 5.38&#8201;%, which is one of the highest efficiencies of monomeric perylene diimide&#8208;based solar cells recorded to date.

         <title>Reconsidering the Structures of C2Al4&#8722; and C2Al5&#8722;</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 57, October 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combining anion photoelectron spectroscopy with quantum chemistry computations, it was determined that the C2Al4&#8722; cluster adopts a boat&#8208;like structure, whereas a D3h isomer is the most stable structure for C2Al5&#8722;.







Abstract
The study of C2Al4&#8722;/0 and C2Al5&#8722;/0 was conducted using anion photoelectron spectroscopy and quantum chemical computations. The present findings reveal that C2Al4&#8722; has a boat&#8208;like structure, with a single C2 unit surrounded by four aluminum atoms. In contrast, the neutral C2Al4 species adopts a D2h planar structure with two planar tetracoordinate carbon (ptC) units, consistent with previous reports. Furthermore, the global minimum isomer of C2Al5&#8722; adopts a D3h symmetry, where the C2 unit interacts with five aluminum atoms. It was also found that a lower symmetry structure of C2Al5&#8722;, where all five aluminum atoms are located on the same side of the C2 unit, albeit slightly higher in energy compared to the D3h structure. These computations show that the D3h structure of C2Al5&#8722; is highly stable, exhibiting a large HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Combining anion photoelectron spectroscopy with quantum chemistry computations&lt;/b&gt;, it was determined that the C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Al&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; cluster adopts a boat-like structure, whereas a &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;i&gt;h&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; isomer is the most stable structure for C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Al&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study of C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Al&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;/0&lt;/sup&gt; and C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Al&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;/0&lt;/sup&gt; was conducted using anion photoelectron spectroscopy and quantum chemical computations. The present findings reveal that C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Al&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; has a boat-like structure, with a single C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; unit surrounded by four aluminum atoms. In contrast, the neutral C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Al&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; species adopts a &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;i&gt;h&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; planar structure with two planar tetracoordinate carbon (ptC) units, consistent with previous reports. Furthermore, the global minimum isomer of C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Al&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; adopts a &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;i&gt;h&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; symmetry, where the C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; unit interacts with five aluminum atoms. It was also found that a lower symmetry structure of C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Al&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, where all five aluminum atoms are located on the same side of the C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; unit, albeit slightly higher in energy compared to the &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;i&gt;h&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; structure. These computations show that the &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;i&gt;h&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; structure of C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Al&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; is highly stable, exhibiting a large HOMO-LUMO gap.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Versatile Synthesis of Symmetric and Unsymmetric Imines via Photoelectrochemical Catalysis: Application to N&#8208;Terminal Modification of Phenylalanine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 57, October 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photoelectrochemical strategy for synthesizing imines efficiently is introduced, including both symmetric and unsymmetric imines. Of note, the method is successfully applied to perform the cross&#8208;coupling of N&#8208;terminal phenylalanine residues, highlighting its potential in chemical biology applications. This strategy presents a convenient platform for imine synthesis with broad implications in drug development and organic synthesis.







Abstract
A strategy that combines electrochemical synthesis and photoredox catalysis was reported for the efficient synthesis of imines. This approach was demonstrated to be highly versatile in producing various types of imines, including symmetric and unsymmetric imines, by exploring the impact of different substituents on the benzene ring of the arylamine. Additionally, the method was specifically applied to modify N&#8208;terminal phenylalanine residues and was found to be successful in the photoelectrochemical cross&#8208;coupling reaction between NH2&#8208;Phe&#8208;OMe and aryl methylamines, leading to the synthesis of phenylalanine&#8208;containing imines. Therefore, this technique would present a convenient and efficient platform for synthesizing imines, with promising applications in chemical biology, drug development, and organic synthesis.

         <title>CO2&#8208;Mediated Photocatalytic Chlorine Production Over Bismuth Oxychloride in Chloride Solution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 57, October 13, 2023. </description>

The introduction of CO2 would enhance the productivity of Cl2 from 8.24&#8197;&#956;mol&#8901;h&#8722;1 to 39.6&#8197;&#956;mol&#8901;h&#8722;1 in NaCl solution over BiOCl. Experimental studies reveal that the cycle of carbonate species and the interaction between CO2 and the catalyst of BiOCl play a significant role in this process. This work provides a new feasible method of using abundant CO2 resources to accelerate the process of Cl2 production via photocatalysis.







Abstract
As one of the most commonly bulky chemicals, chlorine is conventionally manufactured by electrolysis of NaCl solution in the chlor&#8211;alkali process, which requires a huge supply of electrical energy. The photocatalytic route to produce chlorine by using solar energy and NaCl solution offers a promising strategy to reduce energy consumption and bring economic benefits. Herein, it was found that the introduction of CO2 would enhance the productivity of Cl2 from 8.24&#8197;&#956;mol&#8901;h&#8722;1 to 39.6&#8197;&#956;mol&#8901;h&#8722;1 in NaCl solution over BiOCl. Experimental studies reveal that the CO2 species (CO32&#8722;) entered into the crystal texture of BiOCl and the interlayer space between [Bi2O2]2+ slabs were increased and distorted, accelerating the cycle of Cl species. Besides, the cycle of carbonate species also existed and accelerated the reaction efficiency of Cl&#8722; oxidation to Cl2. This work provides a new feasible method of using abundant CO2 resources to accelerate the process of chlorine production via photocatalysis.

         <title>Zero&#8208;Dimensional Sn&#8208;Based Enantiomeric Phase&#8208;Transition Materials with High&#8208;Tc and Dielectric Switching</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 57, October 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We successfully designed and synthesized a pair of new organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid enantiomeric high&#8208;temperature plastic phase&#8208;transition materials: (R/S)&#8208;[CH3CH(OH)CH2N(CH2CH3)3]2SnCl6 (1&#8208;R/1&#8208;S), which have a high temperature phase transition of Tc=384&#8197;K, and an obvious CD signal. In addition, compounds 1&#8208;R and 1&#8208;S also have good low&#8208;loss dielectric switch and broadband gap.







Abstract
The combination of chirality and phase&#8208;transition materials has broad application prospects. Therefore, based on the quasi&#8208;spherical theory and the thought strategy of introducing chirality, we have successfully synthesized a pair of chiral enantiomeric ligands (R/S)&#8208;triethyl&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxypropyl)ammonium iodide, which can be combined with a tin hexachloride anion to obtain a pair of new organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid enantiomeric high&#8208;temperature plastic phase&#8208;transition materials: (R/S)&#8208;[CH3CH(OH)CH2N(CH2CH3)3]2SnCl6 (1&#8208;R/1&#8208;S), which have a high temperature phase transition of Tc=384&#8197;K, crystallize in the P21 chiral space group at room temperature, and have obvious CD signals. In addition, compounds 1&#8208;R and 1&#8208;S have a good low&#8208;loss dielectric switch and broadband gap. This work is conducive to the research into chiral high&#8208;temperature reversible plastic phase&#8208;transition materials, and promotes the development of multi&#8208;functional phase&#8208;transition materials.

         <title>Molecular Engineering to Boost the Photo&#8208;Oxidase Activity of Molecular Rotors in Colorimetric Sensing of Temperatures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 57, October 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
To adjust the photocatalytic oxidation ability, CBPy and DAPy were designed and synthesized based on the enhancement and diminishment of the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) process, respectively. The photo&#8208;oxidase activity of molecular rotors was applied for the colorimetric detection of environmental temperatures for the first time.







Abstract
Some organic dyes and photosensitizers with strong visible absorption can behave as photo&#8208;responsive oxidase mimics. However, the relationship between the photo&#8208;oxidase activity and molecular structure remains unclear to date. In this work, a new type of photosensitizer with the characteristics of molecular rotors, namely DPPy, served as the molecular scaffold for further investigation. To adjust the photocatalytic oxidation ability, DAPy and CBPy were designed and synthesized based on the enhancement and diminishment of the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) process, respectively. Kinetic studies revealed that DAPy and CBPy both exhibited highly efficient photo&#8208;activated oxidase&#8208;like activity with 3,3&#8242;,5,5&#8242;&#8208;tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) as the substrate, which were in good accordance with their molecular engineering to promote either type I or type II reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Impressively a colorimetric method based on the visible light induced oxidase&#8208;like activity of molecular rotors was developed to determine the environmental temperature for the first time. Both DAPy and CBPy showed distinct sensitivities toward temperature as compared with several molecular rotors based on the typical fluorimetric detection. This work provides a new strategy for the application of molecular rotors to overcome the non&#8208;emissive challenge in temperature sensing.

         <title>Design and Synthesis of BODIPY&#8208;Hetero[5]helicenes as Heavy&#8208;Atom&#8208;Free Triplet Photosensitizers for Photodynamic Therapy of Cancer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 57, October 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
BODIPY&#8208;hetero[5]helicenes have been synthesized by fusing BODIPY and hetero[5]helicene structures. All the fused compounds have helical structures and their twisting angles are also increased by substitutions at the boron centre. The BODIPY&#8208;hetero[5]helicenes show superior optical properties and high singlet&#8208;oxygen generation capacities that increase proportionally with their twisting angle.







Abstract
Designing heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free triplet photosensitizers (PSs) is a challenge for the efficient photodynamic therapy (PDT) of cancer. Helicenes are twisted polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with an efficient intersystem crossing (ISC) that is proportional to their twisting angle. But their difficult syntheses and weak absorption profile in the visible spectral region restrict their use as heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free triplet PSs for PDT. On the other hand, boron&#8208;containing PAHs, BODIPYs are highly recognized for their outstanding optical properties. However, planar BODIPY dyes has low ISC and thus they are not very effective as PDT agents. We have designed and synthesized fused compounds containing both BODIPY and hetero[5]helicene structures to develop red&#8208;shifted chromophores with efficient ISC. One of the pyrrole units of the BODIPY core was also replaced by a thiazole unit to further enhance the triplet conversion. All the fused compounds have helical structure, and their twisting angles are also increased by substitutions at the boron centre. The helical structures of the BODIPY&#8208;hetero[5]helicenes were confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallography and DFT structure optimization. The designed BODIPY&#8208;hetero[5]helicenes showed superior optical properties and high ISC with respect to [5]helicene. Interestingly their ISC efficiencies increase proportionally with their twisting angles. This is the first report on the relationship between the twisting angle and the ISC efficiency in twisted BODIPY&#8208;based compounds. Theoretical calculations showed that energy gap of the S1 and T1 states decreases in BODIPY&#8208;hetero[5]helicene as compared to planar BODIPY. This enhances the ISC rate in BODIPY&#8208;hetero[5]helicene, which is responsible for their high generation of singlet oxygen. Finally, their potential applications as PDT agents were investigated, and one BODIPY&#8208;hetero[5]helicene showed efficient cancer cell killing upon photo&#8208;exposure. This new design strategy will be very useful for the future development of heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free PDT agents.

         <title>FeIII&#8208;Based Eutectic Mixtures as Multi&#8208;task and Reusable Reaction Media for Efficient and Selective Conversion of Alkynes into Carbonyl Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 57, October 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alkynes were hydration under bench type reaction conditions (45&#8201;&#176;C, air, absence of co&#8208;catalysts or co&#8208;solvents) thanks to the use of a sustainable FeIII&#8208;based deep eutectic solvent (DES) as promoter/reaction medium. This Fe&#8208;DES was recycled for up to eight consecutives runs in the absence of any VOC solvent.







Abstract
An efficient, simple and general protocol for the selective hydration of terminal alkynes into the corresponding methyl ketones has been developed by using a cheap, easy&#8208;to&#8208;synthesise and sustainable FeIII&#8208;based eutectic mixture [FeCl3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;6H2O/Gly (3&#8201;:&#8201;1)] as both promoter and solvent for the hydration reaction, working: i)&#8197;under mild (45&#8201;&#176;C) and bench&#8208;type reaction conditions (air); and ii)&#8197;in the absence of ligands, co&#8208;catalysts, co&#8208;solvents or toxic, non&#8208;abundant and expensive noble transition metals (Au, Ru, Pd). When the final methyl ketones are solid/insoluble in the eutectic mixture, the hydration reaction takes place in 30&#8197;min, and the obtained methyl ketones can be isolated by simply decanting the liquid FeIII&#8208;DES, allowing the direct isolation of the desired ketones without VOC solvents. By using this straightforward and simple isolation protocol, we have been able to recycle the FeIII&#8208;based eutectic mixture system up to eight consecutive times. Furthermore, the FeIII&#8208;eutectic mixture is able to promote the selective and efficient formal oxidation of internal alkynes into 1,2&#8208;diketones, with the possibility of recycling this system up to three consecutive times. Preliminary investigations into a possible mechanism for the oxidation of the internal alkynes seem to indicate that it proceeds through the formation of the corresponding methyl ketones and &#945;&#8208;chloroketones.

         <title>Liquid&#8208;Free, Self&#8208;Repairable, Recyclable, and Highly Stretchable Colorless Solid Ionic Conductive Elastomers for Strain/Temperature Sensors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 57, October 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A liquid&#8208;free polyurethane type ionic conductive elastomer (ICE) was prepared in a facile manner. The mechanical robust, transparent ICE with self&#8208;healing ability proved its advantages in strain and temperature sensing. The recycling and remolding process did not deteriorate the sensing properties







Abstract
Solid&#8208;state ionic conductive elastomers (ICEs) can fundamentally overcome the disadvantages of hydrogels and ionogels (their liquid components tend to leak or evaporate), and are considered to be ideal materials for flexible ionic sensors. In this study, a liquid&#8208;free ionic polyurethane (PU) type conductive elastomer (ICE&#8208;2) was synthesized and studied.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A liquid-free polyurethane&lt;/b&gt; type ionic conductive elastomer (ICE) was prepared in a facile manner. The mechanical robust, transparent ICE with self-healing ability proved its advantages in strain and temperature sensing. The recycling and remolding process did not deteriorate the sensing properties
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solid-state ionic conductive elastomers (ICEs) can fundamentally overcome the disadvantages of hydrogels and ionogels (their liquid components tend to leak or evaporate), and are considered to be ideal materials for flexible ionic sensors. In this study, a liquid-free ionic polyurethane (PU) type conductive elastomer (ICE-2) was synthesized and studied. The PU type matrix with microphase separation endowed ICE-2 with excellent mechanical versatility. The disulfide bond exchange reaction in the hard phase and intermolecular hydrogen bonds contributed to damage repairing ability. ICE-2 exhibited good ionic conductivity (2.86&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;6&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;S/cm), high transparency (average transmittance &amp;gt;89&#8201;%, 400~800&#8197;nm), excellent mechanical properties (tensile strength of 3.06&#8197;MPa, elongation at break of 1760&#8201;%, and fracture energy of 14.98&#8197;kJ/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), appreciable self-healing ability (healing efficiency &amp;gt;90&#8201;%), satisfactory environmental stability, and outstanding recyclability. The sensor constructed by ICE-2 could not only realize the perception of temperature changes, but also accurately and sensitively detect various human activities, including joint movements and micro-expression changes. This study provides a simple and effective strategy for the development of flexible and soft ionic conductors for sensors and human-machine interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Design and Synthesis of Co&#8208;initiators via Base&#8208;Catalysed Sequential Conjugate Addition: Application in Photoinduced Radical Polymerisation Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 57, October 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient synthesis of a co&#8208;initiator for a type&#8208;II photoinitiator promoted photoinduced radical polymerzation reaction via a barrierless catalytic sequential conjugate addition reaction. The computational study confirms the presence of a low HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap for the newly developed addition reaction. The 1,2&#8208;benzenedithiol&#8208;based co&#8208;initiator turned out to be very efficient for the polymerization and the resultant polymeric material has excellent physical properties for dental restoration and 3D&#8208;printing.







Abstract
Applications of photochemistry are becoming very popular in modern&#8208;day life due to its operational simplicity, environmentally friendly and economically sustainable nature in comparison to thermochemistry. In particular photoinduced radical polymerisation (PRP) reactions are finding more biological applications and especially in the areas of dental restoration processes, tissue engineering and artificial bone generation. A type&#8208;II photoinitiator and co&#8208;initiator&#8208;promoted PRP turned out to be a cost&#8208;effective protocol, and herein we report the design and synthesis of a new efficient co&#8208;initiator for a PRP reaction via a barrierless sequential conjugate addition reaction. Experimental mechanistic observations have been further complemented by computational data. Time for newly synthesised 1,2&#8208;benzenedithiol (DTH) based co&#8208;initiator promoted polymerisation of urethane dimethacrylate (UDMA, 70&#8201;%) and triethylene glycol dimethacrylate (TEGDMA, 30&#8201;%) in presence of 450&#8197;nm LED (15&#8197;W) under the aerobic conditions is 38&#8197;seconds. Polymeric material has high glass transition temperature, improved mechanical strength (860 BHN) and longer in&#8208;depth polymerisation (3&#8197;cm).

         <title>A Bifunctional Coordination&#8208;Chain&#8208;Based Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Framework for Quantitative Enantioselective Sensing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 57, October 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An anionic coordination&#8208;chain&#8208;based hydrogen&#8208;bonded framework was applied to accommodate chiral and luminescent centers through a cation exchange reaction, with promising application for instant and quantitative enantioselective luminescence recognition. The competitive absorption and F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer processes contribute cooperatively to the luminescence changes, while the chiral cations that selectively interact with targeting chiral molecules lead to the enantioselective recognition property.







Abstract
Enantioselective sensing is highly crucial and challenging due to the highly similar physical/chemical properties of enantiomers which may have different chemical impact on organism. Luminescent coordination compounds have attracted great attention as sensing materials based on their controllable chemical and electric structures that can be highly matched with the targeted species. To achieve high&#8208;performance enantioselective sensing, the direct synthesis of chiral and luminescent bifunctional coordination compounds is a rational way but highly challenging due to the price and synthesis difficulty. Herein, an anionic coordination&#8208;chain&#8208;based hydrogen&#8208;bonded framework was applied as a host to accommodate chiral and luminescent centers via a facile cation exchange reaction, affording a bifunctional framework that possesses enantioselective sensing properties for the mixture of enantiomers. This study paves a pathway for constructing multifunctional coordination chain&#8208;based hydrogen&#8208;bonded frameworks for rapidly enantioselective sensing function.

         <title>Neighboring&#8208;Group Participation by C&#8208;2 Acyloxy Groups: Influence of the Nucleophile and Acyl Group on the Stereochemical Outcome of Acetal Substitution Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 57, October 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Neighboring&#8208;group participation by C&#8208;2 acyloxy groups can control the 1,2&#8208;trans stereoselectivity of acetal substitution reactions with the employment of strong nucleophiles. 1,2&#8208;Trans selectivity increases with decreased electron&#8208;donating ability of the acyloxy groups at C&#8208;2.







Abstract
A single acyloxy group at C&#8208;2 can control the outcome of nucleophilic substitution reactions of pyran&#8208;derived acetals, but the extent of the neighboring&#8208;group participation depends on a number of factors. We show here that neighboring&#8208;group participation does not necessarily control the stereochemical outcome of acetal substitution reactions with weak nucleophiles. The 1,2&#8208;trans selectivity increased with increasing reactivity of the incoming nucleophile. This trend suggests the intermediacy of both cis&#8208;fused dioxolenium ions and oxocarbenium ions in the stereochemistry&#8208;determining step. In addition, as the electron&#8208;donating ability of the neighboring group decreased, the preference for the 1,2&#8208;trans products increased. Computational studies show how the barriers for the ring&#8208;opening reaction on the dioxolenium ions and the transition states to provide the oxocarbenium ions change with the electron&#8208;donating capacity of the C&#8208;2&#8208;acyloxy group and the reactivity of the nucleophile.

         <title>Peptide Macrocyclization Guided by Reversible Covalent Templating</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 57, October 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Towards sequence/size defined macrocycles: Here we demonstrate a non&#8208;nucleic acid templated synthesis of peptide macrocycle complexes. By using hydrazone bonds, we template and organize short peptide oligomers along a solid supported peptide strand and cyclize them using microwave assisted solid phase peptide synthesis to form sequence and size defined macrocycles. The products are then released from the solid support via acidic hydrolysis and detected by LC&#8211;MS.







Abstract
The creation of complementary products via templating is a hallmark feature of nucleic acid replication. Outside of nucleic acid&#8208;like molecules, the templated synthesis of a hetero&#8208;complementary copy is still rare. Herein we describe one cycle of templated synthesis that creates homomeric macrocyclic peptides guided by linear instructing strands. This strategy utilizes hydrazone formation to pre&#8208;organize peptide oligomeric monomers along the template on a solid support resin, and microwave&#8208;assisted peptide synthesis to couple monomers and cyclize the strands. With a flexible templating strand, we can alter the size of the complementary macrocycle products by increasing the length and number of the binding peptide oligomers, showing the potential to precisely tune the size of macrocyclic products. For the smaller macrocyclic peptides, the products can be released via hydrolysis and characterized by ESI&#8208;MS.

         <title>Temporal Control of Fluorescent EuW10 Aggregates for Autonomous DNA Capture and Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 57, October 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate the temporal programming of the assembly and disassembly of EuW10 nanospheres using a pH clock reaction of acid/urease hydrolysis. The pH&#8208;responsive C12DMAO endow EuW10 nanospheres with dynamical properties, in which fluorescence changes are coded in this system. These fluorescent nanospheres provide new application in time&#8208;programmed information encryption.







Abstract
Self&#8208;assembly exploits noncovalent interaction to offer an effective method for the fabrication of materials. For Na9[EuW10O36]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;32H2O (EuW10), the negative charges and abundant oxygen atoms on its surface provide a handle for static self&#8208;assembly. New properties are envisioned for EuW10 aggregates which are able to display such kinetics and time&#8208;programming characteristics, in order to satisfy more complex and intelligent application scenarios, such as DNA binding and information encryption. In this work, EuW10 coupling with stimuli&#8208;responsive dodecyl dimethylamine oxide (C12DMAO) can generate versatile aggregates with pH&#8208;responsive properties. We demonstrated the temporal programming of the assembly and disassembly of EuW10 nanospheres using a pH clock reaction of acid/urease hydrolysis. The pH clock reaction endows EuW10 assemblies with dynamical properties, in which the charges and fluorescence changes are coded in this system. These fluorescent assemblies provide new application in time&#8208;programmed DNA capture and information encryption.

         <title>Total Synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;5&#8208;Deoxyenterocin and Attempted Late&#8208;Stage Functionalization Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 57, October 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The polyketide natural product (&#8722;)&#8208;5&#8208;deoxyenterocin (2) was stereoselectively synthesized from aldehyde 1, which was in turn obtained from pentane&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triol and (&#8722;)&#8208;menthone. An attempted functionalization at position C5 remained futile, although several C&#8722;H activation methods could be successfully applied to (3aR)&#8208;(+)&#8208;sclareolide (3).







Abstract
The first total synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;5&#8208;deoxyenterocin has been accomplished starting from pentane&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triol (16 steps in the longest linear sequence, 0.2&#8201;% overall yield). (&#8722;)&#8208;Menthone served as the source of chirality to distinguish the enantiotopic hydroxymethyl groups of the substrate. Key steps of the synthesis include two aldol reactions to either end of the C5&#8208;skeleton, a diastereoselective hydroxylation reaction and a biomimetic twofold intramolecular aldol reaction as the final step. Although this step suffered from geometrical constraints and was low yielding (10&#8201;%), enough synthetic material could be secured to substantiate the relative and absolute configuration of the natural product. Additional experiments were directed toward a C&#8722;H functionalization at carbon atom C5. Despite the fact that several protocols could be successfully applied to (3aR)&#8208;(+)&#8208;sclareolide as model substrate, (&#8722;)&#8208;5&#8208;deoxyenterocin withstood any selective functionalization.

         <title>Naphthodithiophene&#8208;Fused Porphyrins: Synthesis, Characterization, and Impact of Extended Conjugation on Aromaticity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 57, October 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Naphthodithiophene&#8208;fused porphyrins were prepared through a Heck&#8208;based cascade reaction and a Scholl reaction. An unusual trend was observed in the florescence quantum yield upon converting benzoporphyrin 2VTP to naphtho[1,2&#8208;b:4,3&#8208;b&#8217;]dithiophene&#8208;fused porphyrin (F2VTP). NICS analysis revealed different impacts of the two isomeric naphthodithiophenes on the global aromaticity upon fusion to porphyrin (F2VTP and F3VTP).







Abstract
The fusion of tetrapyrroles with aromatic heterocycles constitutes a useful tool for manipulating their opto&#8208;electronic properties. In this work, the synthesis of naphthodithiophene&#8208;fused porphyrins was achieved through a Heck reaction&#8208;based cascade of steps followed by the Scholl reaction. The naphthodithiophene&#8208;fused porphyrins display a unique set of optical and electronic properties. Fusion of the naphtho[2,1&#8208;b:3,4&#8208;b&#8217;]dithiophene to porphyrin (F2VTP) leads to a ~20% increase in the fluorescence lifetime, which is accompanied, unexpectedly, by a more than two&#8208;fold drop in the emission quantum yield (&#981;=0.018). In contrast, fusion of the isomeric naphtho[1,2&#8208;b:4,3&#8208;b&#8217;]dithiophene to porphyrin (F3VPT) results in a ~1.5&#8208;fold increase in the fluorescence quantum yield (&#981;=0.13) with a concomitant ~30&#8201;% increase in the fluorescence lifetime. This behavior suggests that fusion of the porphyrin with the naphthodithiopheno&#8208;system mainly affects the radiative rate constant in the Q&#8208;state deactivation pathway, where the effects of the isomeric naphtho[2,1&#8208;b:3,4&#8208;b&#8217;]dithiophene&#8208; versus naphtho[1,2&#8208;b:4,3&#8208;b&#8217;]dithiophene&#8208;fusion are essentially the opposite. Interestingly, nucleus&#8208;independent chemical shifts analysis revealed a considerable difference between the aromaticities of these two isomeric systems. Our results demonstrate that subtle structural differences in the fused components of the porphyrin can be reflected in rather significant differences between the photophysical properties of the resulting systems.

         <title>Molecular Recognition of Aromatics in Spherical Nanocages</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 57, October 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The preferred molecular recognition of aromatics in spherical M12L8 metal&#8211;organic cages (MOCs) has been studied in consecutive single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (SCSC) reactions combining single&#8208;crystal&#8208;XRD (SC&#8208;XRD) analysis, DFT calculations, and solid&#8208;state NMR. Computed DFT host&#8211;guest energy interactions (Ehost&#8211;guest) showed a good match with the observed molecular recognition and the rotational behaviour of the pyridine rings in the M12L8 nanocages (low rotational energy barrier &#8776;3&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1). Considering the structure&#8211;function properties observed in M12L8, the metal&#8211;organic structures could be used in sensing applications.







Abstract
In general, due to the lack of efficient specific molecular interactions, achieving host&#8211;guest molecular recognition inside large and neutral metal&#8211;organic cages (MOCs) is challenging. Preferential molecular recognition of aromatics using the internal binding sites of interlocked icosahedral (i.&#8201;e., spherical) M12L8 MOCs within poly&#8208;[n]&#8208;catenane (1) is reported. The guest absorption was monitored directly in the solid&#8208;state by consecutive single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (SCSC) reactions in a gas&#8208;solid environment, in single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SC&#8208;XRD) experiments. The preferential guest uptake was corroborated by density functional theory (DFT) calculations by determining the host&#8211;guest interaction energy (Ehost&#8211;guest) with a nitrobenzene (NB)&#8811;p&#8208;xylene (p&#8208;xy)&#8811;o&#8208;dichlorobenzene (o&#8208;DCB) trend (i.&#8201;e., from 44 to 25&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1), assessing the XRD outcomes. Combining SC&#8208;XRD, DFT and solid&#8208;state 13C NMR, the exceptional stability of the M12L8 cages, together with the guest exchange/release properties were rationalized by considering the presence of mechanical bonds (efficient &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions) and by the pyridine's rotor&#8208;like behaviour (with 3&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 rotational energy barrier). The structure&#8211;function properties of M12L8 makes 1 a potential candidate in the field of molecular sensors.

The preferential guest uptake was corroborated by density functional theory (DFT) calculations by determining the host&#8211;guest interaction energy (&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;host&#8211;guest&lt;/sub&gt;) with a nitrobenzene (NB)&#8811;&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-xylene (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-xy)&#8811;&lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-dichlorobenzene (&lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-DCB) trend (i.&#8201;e., from 44 to 25&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), assessing the XRD outcomes. Combining SC-XRD, DFT and solid-state &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C NMR, the exceptional stability of the M&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;L&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; cages, together with the guest exchange/release properties were rationalized by considering the presence of &lt;i&gt;mechanical bonds&lt;/i&gt; (efficient &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions) and by the pyridine's &lt;i&gt;rotor-like&lt;/i&gt; behaviour (with 3&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; rotational energy barrier). The structure&#8211;function properties of M&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;L&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; makes &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; a potential candidate in the field of molecular sensors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis, Characterisation, and Functionalisation of Charged Two&#8208;Dimensional MoS2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 57, October 13, 2023. </description>

Negatively charged 2H&#8208;MoS2: The surface of 2H&#8208;MoS2 was activated by reacting liquid exfoliated 2H&#8208;MoS2 with NaBH4 yielding a novel anionically charged semi&#8208;conducting two&#8208;dimensional 2H&#8208;MoS2 defined as n&#8208;2H&#8208;MoS2. The negative doping allowed for dispersibility in water and other polar solvents (unlike pristine 2H&#8208;MoS2), caused a red&#8208;shift in the material's photoluminescence, and allowed for facile functionalisation.







Abstract
The applications of exfoliated MoS2 are limited by its inert surface and poor interface. We have activated the surface of exfoliated 2H&#8208;MoS2 by reacting it with NaBH4, forming an n&#8208;doped material as demonstrated by a negative zeta&#8208;potential value &#950;=&#8722;25&#8197;mV and a 20&#8197;nm (0.05&#8197;eV) red&#8208;shift in its photoluminescence spectrum. The novel material's spectral properties were consistent with pristine 2H&#8208;MoS2 (as determined by HR&#8208;TEM, XPS, pXRD, DRIFT, TGA, and Raman spectroscopy). Importantly, it was readily dispersed in H2O unlike 2H&#8208;MoS2. Its dispersibility properties were explored for a variety of solvents and could be directly correlated with the relative permittivity of the respective solvents. The charged 2H&#8208;MoS2 reacted readily with an organo&#8208;iodide to deliver functionalized 2H&#8208;MoS2. Our approach delivers aqueous dispersions of semiconducting 2H&#8208;MoS2, without additives or chemical functionalities, and allows for controlled and facile functionalization of 2H&#8208;MoS2 opening multiple new avenues of semi&#8208;conducting MoS2 application.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light Enabled Dehydroxylative Alkylation of &#945;&#8208;Hydroxy Carboxylic Acid Derivatives via C&#8722;O Bond Cleavage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 57, October 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Existing protocols for the boryl radical promoted dehydroxylative alkylation of &#945;&#8208;hydroxy carboxylic acid derivatives via C&#8722;O bond cleavage require the use of expensive radical initiators and relatively harsh conditions. An improved protocol is presented that uses cheap and readily available sodium tetraphenyl borate (NaBPh4) as a boron radical source. The reaction using the photoredox catalytic system could take place under mild conditions and avoid tedious preparation of free radical initiator (di&#8208;tert&#8208;butoxydiazene).







Abstract
A novel visible&#8208;light photoredox strategy is reported for the efficient dehydroxylative alkylation of a wide array of &#945;&#8208;hydroxy carboxylic acid derivatives using diaryl boron radical. The reaction features readily accessible starting materials, broad substrate scope with excellent functionality tolerance. Preliminary mechanistic studies reveal that the spin&#8208;center shift process is responsible for the C&#8722;O bond activation, which is promoted by the diaryl boron radical generated from bench&#8208;stable and commercially available tetraphenyl borate (NaBPh4).

         <title>Centrohexaindane, a Unique Polyaromatic Hydrocarbon Bearing the Rare Cq(Cq)4 Core: Inelastic Neutron Scattering, Infrared and Raman Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 57, October 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Centrohexaindane is an unusual molecule that has a quaternary carbon atom that is coordinated to four further such quaternary carbon atoms as its core, each pair of which is bonded to an ortho&#8208;phenylene unit. Vibrational spectroscopy was used to explore the differences between the solution and solid state structures.







Abstract
The structure and vibrational spectroscopy of centrohexaindane, 1, was investigated. This unusual molecule has a quaternary carbon atom that is coordinated to four further such quaternary carbon atoms as its core, each pair of which is bonded to an ortho&#8208;phenylene unit. Previous NMR studies have shown that the molecule has tetrahedral (Td) symmetry in solution. The infrared and Raman spectra of chloroform and deuterochloroform solutions of 1 are completely in agreement with this conclusion, as the only modes that are visible are those allowed for Td symmetry. This is not the case in the solid state: X&#8208;ray powder diffraction indicates that the unit cell is triclinic or monoclinic with a volume in excess of 4000&#8197;&#197;3. The vibrational spectroscopy is consistent with C1 site symmetry and the presence of at least two molecules in the primitive cell. It is likely that the space group is centrosymmetric.

         <title>The Rise of Structurally Anisotropic Plasmonic Janus Gold Nanostars</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 57, October 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel synthesis of plasmonic gold Janus nanostars without templates or masks is reported. The study explores structurally Janus nanostructures with two distinct morphologies and a single&#8208;step growth process using pentatwinned seeds. The interplay of silver and bromide ions influences morphological differences. The SERS capability of Au Janus NSs was investigated; higher enhancement was shown with larger&#8208;sized particles.







Abstract
Nanostructures intrinsically possessing two different structural or functional features, often called Janus nanoparticles, are emerging as a potential material for sensing, catalysis, and biomedical applications. Herein, we report the synthesis of plasmonic gold Janus nanostars (NSs) possessing a smooth concave pentagonal morphology with sharp tips and edges on one side and, contrastingly, a crumbled morphology on the other. The methodology reported herein for their synthesis &#8211; a single&#8208;step growth reaction &#8211; is different from any other Janus nanoparticle preparation involving either template&#8208;assisted growth or a masking technique. Interestingly, the coexistence of lower&#8208; and higher&#8208;index facets was found in these Janus NSs. The general paradigm for synthesizing gold Janus NSs was investigated by understanding the kinetic control mechanism with the combinatorial effect of all the reagents responsible for the structure. The optical properties of the Janus NSs were realized by corelating their extinction spectra with the simulated data. The size&#8208;dependent surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) activity of these Janus NSs was studied with 1,4&#8208;BDT as the model analyte. Finite&#8208;difference time&#8208;domain simulations for differently sized particles revealed the distribution of electromagnetic hot&#8208;spots over the particles resulting in enhancement of the SERS signal in a size&#8208;dependent manner.

         <title>Comparative Study on Proton Conductivity and Mechanism Analysis of Two Imidazole Modified Imine&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>

         <dc:description>
The effect of intramolecular hydrogen bonding on the proton conductivity of COFs was investigated. It was shown that the extrinsic proton carriers could increase the proton conductivity of DaTta, which originally had negligible proton conductivity due to intramolecular hydrogen bonds, to 0.91&#215;10&#8722;2&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 100&#8201;&#176;C/98&#8201;% RH by breaking the intramolecular H&#8208;bonds.







Abstract
This work elucidates the potential impact of intramolecular H&#8208;bonds within the pore walls of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) on proton conductivity. Employing DaTta and TaTta as representative hosts, it was observed that their innate proton conductivities (&#963;) are both unsatisfactory and &#963;(DaTta)&lt;&#963;(TaTta). Intriguingly, the performance of both imidazole&#8208;loaded products, Im@DaTta and Im@TaTta is greatly improved, and the &#963; of Im@DaTta (0.91&#215;10&#8722;2&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1) even surpasses that of Im@TaTta (3.73&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1) under 100&#8201;&#176;C and 98&#8201;% relative humidity. The structural analysis, gas adsorption tests, and activation energy calculations forecast the influence of imidazole on the H&#8208;bonded system within the framework, leading to observed changes in proton conductivity. It is hypothesized that intramolecular H&#8208;bonds within the COF framework impede efficient proton transmission. Nevertheless, the inclusion of an imidazole group disrupts these intramolecular bonds, leading to the formation of an abundance of intermolecular H&#8208;bonds within the pore channels, thus contributing to a dramatic increase in proton conductivity. The related calculation of Density Functional Theory (DFT) provides further evidence for this inference.

With light excitation, triplet oxygen molecules (3O2; red dots) are converted to singlet oxygen (1O2; blue dots) through triplet photosensitization by the BODIPY&#8208;hetero[5]helicene (BHH) molecule. The researcher is trying to increase the twist angle of BHH. As it increases, the stick indicating the percentage of 1O2 conversion moves towards 100. This illustrates how 1O2 conversion increases with increasing BHH twist angle, which is the main highlight of the work. More information can be found in the Research Article by S. Mula and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202301605).

Thanks to the use of a sustainable FeIII&#8208;based deep eutectic solvent (DES) as promoter/reaction medium, alkynes were hydrated under bench&#8208;type reaction conditions (45&#8201;&#176;C, air, absence of co&#8208;catalysts or co&#8208;solvents). This Fe&#8208;DES could be recycled for up to eight consecutives runs in the absence of any VOC solvent (E factor = 10). Furthermore, the Fe&#8208;DES is able to promote the efficient formal oxidation of internal alkynes into 1,2&#8208;diketones, with the system being recycled up to three consecutive times.

         <title>Excited&#8208;State Proton Transfer in Luminescent Dyes: From Theoretical Insight to Experimental Evidence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 57, October 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
To ESPT, or not to ESPT: Efficient use of luminescent dyes requires understanding their excitation and relaxation pathways like Excited&#8208;State Proton Transfer (ESPT). Experimental demonstration is challenging due to competing phenomena. A holistic approach, merging experimental results, computational analysis, and diverse mechanism assessment, is vital for ESPT verification, affecting molecular probes, sensors, and related applications.







Abstract
The effective utilization of luminescent dyes often relies on a comprehensive understanding of their excitation and relaxation pathways. One such pathway, Excited&#8208;State Proton Transfer (ESPT), involves the tautomerization of the dye in its excited state, resulting in a new structure that exhibits distinct emission properties, such as a very large Stokes&#8242; shift or dual&#8208;emission. Although the ESPT phenomenon is well&#8208;explained theoretically, its experimental demonstration can be challenging due to the presence of numerous other phenomena that can yield similar experimental observations. In this review, we propose that an all&#8208;encompassing methodology, integrating experimental findings, computational analyses, and a thorough evaluation of diverse mechanisms, is essential for verifying the occurrence of ESPT in luminescent dyes. Investigations have offered significant understanding of the elements impacting the ESPT process and the array of approaches that can be used to validate the existence of ESPT.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;To ESPT, or not to ESPT&lt;/b&gt;: Efficient use of luminescent dyes requires understanding their excitation and relaxation pathways like Excited-State Proton Transfer (ESPT). Experimental demonstration is challenging due to competing phenomena. A holistic approach, merging experimental results, computational analysis, and diverse mechanism assessment, is vital for ESPT verification, affecting molecular probes, sensors, and related applications.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The effective utilization of luminescent dyes often relies on a comprehensive understanding of their excitation and relaxation pathways. One such pathway, Excited-State Proton Transfer (ESPT), involves the tautomerization of the dye in its excited state, resulting in a new structure that exhibits distinct emission properties, such as a very large Stokes&#8242; shift or dual-emission. Although the ESPT phenomenon is well-explained theoretically, its experimental demonstration can be challenging due to the presence of numerous other phenomena that can yield similar experimental observations. In this review, we propose that an all-encompassing methodology, integrating experimental findings, computational analyses, and a thorough evaluation of diverse mechanisms, is essential for verifying the occurrence of ESPT in luminescent dyes. Investigations have offered significant understanding of the elements impacting the ESPT process and the array of approaches that can be used to validate the existence of ESPT. These discoveries hold crucial ramifications for the advancement of molecular probes, sensors, and other applications that depend on ESPT as a detection mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electrochemical Synthesis and Reactivity of Three&#8208;Membered Strained Carbo&#8208; and Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 57, October 13, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electro&#8208;organic synthesis has become an established and environmentally benign tool for initiating chemical transformations. This review summarizes the electrochemical synthesis and ring&#8208;opening reactions of three&#8208;membered strained rings, and particular attention is given to mechanistic aspects.







Abstract
Three&#8208;membered carbocyclic and heterocyclic ring structures are versatile synthetic building blocks in organic synthesis with biological importance. Moreover, the inherent strain of these three&#8208;membered rings leads to their ring&#8208;opening functionalization through C&#8208;&gt;C, C&#8208;&gt;N, and C&#8722;O bond cleavage. Traditional synthesis and ring&#8208;opening methods for these molecules require the use of acid catalysts or transition metals. Recently, electro&#8208;organic synthesis has emerged as a powerful tool for initiating new chemical transformations. In this review, the synthetic and mechanistic aspects of electro&#8208;mediated synthesis and ring&#8208;opening functionalization of three&#8208;membered carbo&#8208; and heterocycles are highlighted.

         <title>Bioinspired Non&#8208;Heme Mn Catalysts for Regio&#8208; and Stereoselective Oxyfunctionalizations with H2O2</title>

Mn catalyzed C&#8208;H activation: In recent years, Mn based catalysts have been at the forefront of direct oxidative functionalization of organic compounds with hydrogen peroxide. This contribution surveys the progress in this emerging area, achieved in the past five years, with focus on the possibilities for tuning the chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, and stereoselectivity of these catalyst systems.







Abstract
In recent years, metalloenzymes&#8208;mediated highly selective oxidations of organic substrates under mild conditions have been inspiration for developing synthetic bioinspired catalyst systems, capable of conducting such processes in the laboratory (and, in the future, in industry), relying on easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle and environmentally benign oxidants such as H2O2. To date, non&#8208;heme manganese complexes with chiral bis&#8208;amino&#8208;bis&#8208;pyridylmethyl and structurally related ligands are considered as possessing the highest synthetic potential, having demonstrated the ability to mediate a variety of chemo&#8208; and stereoselective oxidative transformations, such as epoxidations, C(sp3)&#8208;H hydroxylations and ketonizations, oxidative desymmetrizations, kinetic resolutions, etc. Furthermore, in the past few years non&#8208;heme Mn based catalysts have become the major platform for studies focused on getting insight into the molecular mechanisms of oxidant activation and (stereo)selective oxygen transfer, testing non&#8208;traditional hydroperoxide oxidants, engineering catalytic sites with enzyme&#8208;like substrate recognition&#8208;based selectivity, exploration of catalytic regioselectivity trends in the oxidation of biologically active substrates of natural origin. This contribution summarizes the progress in manganese catalyzed C&#8208;H oxygenative transformations of organic substrates, achieved essentially in the past 5&#8197;years (late 2018&#8211;2023).

C3&#8208;symmetric chiral cage&#8208;shaped phosphites were developed as a new type of chiral ligand. Their Lewis basicity and chiral environment are precisely controlled by the tethered group. The cage&#8208;shaped phosphites successfully worked as chiral ligands in Rh&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric conjugate additions, realizing acceptable yields with excellent enantioselectivity, and were used to synthesize a pharmacologically important molecule.







Abstract
Designing chiral ligands with an axial symmetry higher than C2&#8208;rotational symmetry is one of the most crucial approaches to improving enantioselectivity in asymmetric synthesis. Herein, C3&#8208;symmetric chiral cage&#8208;shaped phosphites are reported. Their Lewis basicity and chiral environment are precisely controlled by the tethered group. The cage&#8208;shaped phosphites successfully worked as chiral ligands in Rh&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric conjugate additions, realizing acceptable yields with excellent enantioselectivity, and were used to synthesize a pharmacologically important molecule.

         <title>&#8220;Click&#8221; Chemistry for the Functionalization of Graphene Oxide with Phosphorus Dendrons: Synthesis, Characterization and Preliminary Biological Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Several dendrons were functionalized on their surface by different types of pyridine&#8208;imine functions, and at their core by either azide or alkyne. These dendrons were grafted to graphene oxide (GO) via &#8220;click&#8221; reactions between azide or alkyne at their core, and alkynes or azides on the surface of GO, respectively. The biological properties of these new materials were tested.







Abstract
Two families of phosphorhydrazone dendrons having either an azide or an alkyne linked to the core and diverse types of pyridine derivatives as terminal functions have been synthesized and characterized.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Several dendrons&lt;/b&gt; were functionalized on their surface by different types of pyridine-imine functions, and at their core by either azide or alkyne. These dendrons were grafted to graphene oxide (GO) via &#8220;click&#8221; reactions between azide or alkyne at their core, and alkynes or azides on the surface of GO, respectively. The biological properties of these new materials were tested.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two families of phosphorhydrazone dendrons having either an azide or an alkyne linked to the core and diverse types of pyridine derivatives as terminal functions have been synthesized and characterized. These dendrons were grafted via click reaction to graphene oxide (&lt;b&gt;GO&lt;/b&gt;) functionalized with either alkyne or azide functions, respectively. The resulting modified-&lt;b&gt;GO&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;GO&lt;/b&gt;-dendrons materials have been characterized by Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR), Raman spectroscopy (RS), and Magic Angle Spinning Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (MAS&#8197;NMR) analyses. In addition, the free dendrons and the dendrons grafted to &lt;b&gt;GO&lt;/b&gt; were tested toward cancerous (HCT116) and non-cancerous (RPE1) cell lines.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Aroyl&#8208;S,N&#8208;Ketene Acetals: Luminous Renaissance of a Class of Heterocyclic Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aroyl&#8208;S,N&#8208;ketene acetals have experienced a renaissance from a synthetic heterocyclic peculiarity as a short dipole with strong push&#8208;pull characteristics to a promising class of dyes with pronounced controllable and tunable solid&#8208;state and aggregation&#8208;induced emission properties, thus allowing for a methodical and synthetical extension of the system.







Abstract
Aroyl&#8208;S,N&#8208;ketene acetals represent a peculiar class of heterocyclic merocyanines, compounds bearing pronounced and rather short dipoles with great push&#8208;pull characteristics that define their rich properties. They are accessible via a wide array of synthetic concepts and procedures, ranging from addition&#8208;elimination and condensation procedures up to rearrangement and metal&#8208;mediated reactions. With our work from 2020, aroyl&#8208;S,N&#8208;ketene acetals have been identified as powerful and promising dyes with pronounced and vastly tunable solid&#8208;state emission and aggregation&#8208;induced emission properties. One characteristic trademark of this class of dye molecules is the level of control that could be exerted, and which was thoroughly explored. Based on these results, the field was opened to extend the system to bi&#8208; and multichromophoric systems by the full toolkit of synthetic organic chemistry thus giving access to even more exciting properties and manifolded substance libraries capitalizing on the AIE properties. This review aims at outlining the reaction&#8208;based principles that allow for a swift and facile access to aroyl&#8208;S,N&#8208;ketene acetals, their methodical and structural evolution and the plethora of fluorescence and aggregation properties.

         <title>&#960;&#8208;Extended Hexapyrrolylbenzenes: Exploring Charge&#8208;Transfer Phenomena in Donor&#8208;Acceptor Propellers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hexapyrrolylbenzenes bearing electron&#8208;rich and electron&#8208;poor pyrrole units undergo charge transfer upon irradiation. It is most efficient between ortho&#8208;positioned donors and acceptors, for which it can occur even in non&#8208;polar solvents, but it will also take place between para&#8208;substituents in more polar media.







Abstract
A family of propeller&#8208;shaped donor&#8208;acceptor hexapyrrolylbenzenes (HPBs) were designed and synthesized by sequential nucleophilic substitution of hexafluorobenzene with &#960;&#8208;extended pyrroles. In particular, four hybrids were obtained, containing various combinations of electron&#8208;rich and electron&#8208;poor acenaphthylene&#8208;fused pyrroles. Additionally, to probe the efficiency of ortho transfer interactions, a system was designed containing unique donor and acceptor subunits spatially separated with four unfunctionalized pyrroles. DFT calculations showed propeller&#8208;shaped geometries of all HPB molecules and separation of frontier molecular orbitals between donor and acceptor subunits. Steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved photophysical measurements revealed charge&#8208;transfer (CT) character of the emission with strong positive dependence on solvent polarity. The principal CT pathway involves ortho&#8208;positioned pairs of donors and acceptors and requires bending of the acceptor in the excited state.

         <title>Single Crystals of Insoluble Porous Salicylimine Cages</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single crystal X&#8208;ray structures of three barely soluble triptycene based porous organic cages have been obtained and their crystal packing as well as gas sorption properties elucidated. The relation between crystallinity, porosity and gas adsorption selectivity was revealed for these porous structures.







Abstract
Porous organic cages (POCs) are meanwhile an established class of porous materials. Most of them are soluble to a certain extend and thus processable in or from solution. However, a few of larger salicylimine cages were reported to be insoluble in any organic solvents and thus characterized as amorphous materials. These cages were now synthesized as single&#8208;crystalline materials to get insight into packing motifs and preferred intermolecular interactions. Furthermore, the pairs of crystalline and amorphous materials for each cage allowed to compare their gas&#8208;sorption properties in both morphological states.

         <title>Spin Qubit in a 2D GdIIINaI&#8208;Based Oxamato Supramolecular Coordination Framework</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A diamagnetically diluted two&#8208;dimensional oxygen&#8208;coordinated GdIII&#8208;based complex is shown to be a good candidate for molecular qubits, and its near isotropy of GdIII ion and the phonon bottleneck effect from resonance phonon trapped were calculated and fitted to be responsible for the field&#8208;induced slow magnetic relaxation, relatively long spin&#8208;lattace and spin&#8208;spin relaxation times.







Abstract
Qubits are the basic unit of quantum information and computation. To realize quantum computing and information processing, the decoherence times of qubits must be long enough. Among the studies of molecule&#8208;based electron spin qubits, most of the work focused on the ions with the spin S=1/2, where only single&#8208;bit gates can be constructed. However, quantum operations require the qubits to interact with each other, so people gradually carry out relevant research in ions or systems with S&gt;1/2 and multilevel states. In this work, a two&#8208;dimensional (2D) oxygen&#8208;coordinated GdIIINaI&#8208;based oxamato supramolecular coordination framework, Na[Gd(4&#8208;HOpa)4(H2O)]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H2O (1, 4&#8208;HOpa=N&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxyphenyloxamate), was selected as a possible carrier of qubit. The field&#8208;induced slow magnetic relaxation shows this system has phonon bottleneck (PB) effect at low temperatures with a very weak magnetic anisotropy. The pulse electron paramagnetic resonance studies show the spin&#8208;lattice and spin&#8208;spin relaxation times are T1=1.66&#8197;ms at 4&#8197;K and Tm=4.25&#8197;&#956;s at 8&#8197;K for its diamagnetically diluted sample (1Gd0.12&#8201;%). It suggested that the relatively long decoherence time is mainly ascribed to its near isotropic and the PB effect from resonance phonon trapped for pure sample, while the dilution further improves its qubit performance.

         <title>Enabling Stereochemical Communication and Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Chiroptical Properties in Biphenyl&#8208;Capped Cyclodextrins</title>

The use of building blocks from the &#8220;chiral pool&#8221; is challenging for the construction of chiroptical materials, as they often lack chromophores suitable for significant chiroptical properties. A two&#8208;level molecular stack, which combines a point&#8208;chiral element (cyclodextrin) and an axially chiral element (biphenyl), is capable of effectively translating the overall stereochemical information contained in the cyclodextrin core into stimuli&#8208;responsive chiroptical properties.







Abstract
Chiroptical materials are gaining increasing interest due to their innovative character and their applications in optoelectronics and data encryption technologies. Fully harnessing the potential of building blocks from the &#8220;chiral pool&#8221;, such as native cyclodextrins (CDs), as they often lack chromophores suitable for the construction of materials with significant chiroptical properties. Here, we present the synthesis and characterization of a two&#8208;level molecular stack consisting of a point&#8208;chiral element (CD) and an axially chiral element (biphenyl), capable of effectively translating the overall stereochemical information contained in CDs into stimuli&#8208;responsive chiroptical properties. &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;permethylated CDs were efficiently capped with two different 2,2&#8217;&#8208;difunctionalized 1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl units. In CD derivatives containing the rigid 2,2&#8242;&#8208;dihydroxy&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl cap, two intramolecular hydrogen bonds act synergistically as stereoselective actuators, enabling effective communication between the two levels and the transfer of nonchromophoric stereochemical information from the cyclic&#8208;oligosaccharide to the atropoisomeric cap. The chiroptical properties can be finely tuned by external stimuli such as temperature and solvent. The way chirality is transferred from the CD platform to the biphenyl cap was revealed thanks to crystallographic and computational analyses, together with electronic circular dichroism (ECD) studies.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorescent supramolecular polymers have garnered significant attention due to their successful integration of supramolecular polymers and fluorescence, offering vast potential for applications in sensing, imaging, optoelectronics, and photonics. In this study, we present a novel supramolecular polymer based on P5&#8208;OH, derived from mono&#8208;substituted pillararene macrocycles. Notably, these formed supramolecular polymeric aggregates exhibit a prominent blue emission, representing a rare instance of fluorescent polymers devoid of conventional chromophores. Furthermore, through the modification of alkyl chain ending groups attached to pillar[5]arenes, slight shifts in the emission peak could be observed. This research expands the scope of functional supramolecular polymeric systems utilizing pillararenes, providing valuable insights for the design of innovative luminescent materials and optical devices.</dc:description>

         <title>A discrete, boron&#8208;containing triangular triradical</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A neutral boron&#8208;containing triangular triradical based on a triptycene derivative has been designed and synthesized. Its structure, bonding and physical property have been studied by EPR spectroscopy, SQUID magnetometry and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, as well as theoretical calculations. The triradical has a series of isosceles triangle conformations in the solution due to the Jahn&#8208;Teller distortion, leading to the splitting of the two low&#8208;lying doublet states. This factor together with negligible spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC) of composing light atoms quenches the spin frustration. The work represents a rare example of a&#160; neutral through&#8208;space triangular triradical.</dc:description>

         <title>Sheet&#8208;Isolated MoS2 Used for Dispersing Pt Nanoparticles and its Application in Methanol Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It is highly challenging to activate the basal plane and minimize the &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking of MoS2 sheets, thus enhancing its catalytic performance. Here, we display an approach for making well&#8208;dispersed MoS2. By using the N&#8208;doped multi&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (NMWCNTs) as an isolation unit, the aggregation of MoS2 sheets was effectively reduced, favoring the dispersion of Pt nanoparticles (noted as Pt/NMWCNTs&#8208;isolated&#8208;MoS2). Excellent bifunctional catalytic performance for the methanol oxidation and oxygen reduction reaction (MOR/ORR) was demonstrated by the produced Pt/NMWCNTs&#8208;isolated&#8208;MoS2. In comparison to Pt nanoparticles supported on MoS2 (Pt/MoS2), the MOR activity (2314.14 mA mg&#8211;1Pt) and stability (317.69 mA mg&#8211;1 Pt after 2 h of operation) on Pt/NMWCNTs&#8208;isolatedMoS2 were 24 and 232 times higher, respectively. As for ORR, Pt/NMWCNTs&#8208;isolated&#8208;MoS2 holds large half&#8208;wave potential (0.88 V) and high stability (92.71% after 22 h of operation). This work presents a tactic for activating the basal planes and reducing the &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking of 2D materials to satisfy their applications in electrocatalysis. In addition, the proposed sheet&#8208;isolation method can be used for fabricating other 2D materials to promote the dispersion of nanoparticles to apply in other fields of energy as well as the environment.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of bridged tetrazoles with promising properties and potential applications by a one&#8208;step Finkelstein reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Numerous nitramine bridged compounds which show promising combinations of properties have already been identified in the area of energetic materials. In this work, four new nitrazapropane bridged tetrazoles, as well as four new trinitrazaheptane tetrazoles and three oxapropane bridged tetrazoles were synthesized and fully characterized. These new compounds can all be synthesized by a simple, one&#8208;step synthesis using Finkelstein conditions. All of these new energetic materials were characterized using NMR spectroscopy, single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, vibrational analysis and elemental analysis. The thermal behaviour of these compounds was studied by differential thermal analysis (DTA) and partly by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The BAM standard method was used to determine the sensitivities towards impact (IS) and friction (FS). The enthalpies of formation were calculated at the CBS&#8208;4M level, and the energetic performances were calculated using the EXPLO5 (V6.06.01) computer code. The properties of the new compounds were compared to each other as well as to the known energetic material RDX. Moreover, the iron(II) and copper(II) perchlorate complexes with 1,3&#8208;bis&#8208;1,1&#8208;tetrazolylnitrazapropane as ligand were prepared and investigated.</dc:description>

         <title>Deamination of Polyols from the Glycolysis of Polyurethane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Methylenedianiline (MDA) is a secondary, undesired, product of the glycolysis process of polyurethane (PU) scraps due to hydrolysis and pyrolysis side reactions. As an aromatic and carcinogen amine, MDA poses different problems in handling, transporting, and labelling recycled polyols derived from glycolysis, hindering the closure of PU recycling loop.Aiming to provide a solution to this issue, in this work different deaminating agents (DAs) where investigated with the purpose of analyzing their reactivity with MDA. A first part of the study was devoted to the analysis of MDA formation as a function of reaction time and catalyst concentration (potassium acetate) during glycolysis. It was observed that the amount of MDA increases almost linearly with the extent of PU depolymerization and catalyst content. Among the DAs analyzed 2&#8208;ethylhexyl glycidyl ether (2&#8208;EHGE), and acetic anhydride (Ac2O) showed interesting performance, allowing to diminish MDA content below the limit for labelling prescription in 30 minutes. PU rigid foams were therefore synthesized from the corresponding recycled products and characterized in terms of thermal and mechanical performance. Ac2O&#8208;deaminated polyols led to structurally unstable foams with poor compressive strength, while 2&#8208;EHGE&#8208;deaminated products allowed the production of foams with improved mechanical performance and unaltered thermal conductivity.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Methylenedianiline (MDA) is a secondary, undesired, product of the glycolysis process of polyurethane (PU) scraps due to hydrolysis and pyrolysis side reactions. As an aromatic and carcinogen amine, MDA poses different problems in handling, transporting, and labelling recycled polyols derived from glycolysis, hindering the closure of PU recycling loop.Aiming to provide a solution to this issue, in this work different deaminating agents (DAs) where investigated with the purpose of analyzing their reactivity with MDA. A first part of the study was devoted to the analysis of MDA formation as a function of reaction time and catalyst concentration (potassium acetate) during glycolysis. It was observed that the amount of MDA increases almost linearly with the extent of PU depolymerization and catalyst content. Among the DAs analyzed 2-ethylhexyl glycidyl ether (2-EHGE), and acetic anhydride (Ac2O) showed interesting performance, allowing to diminish MDA content below the limit for labelling prescription in 30 minutes. PU rigid foams were therefore synthesized from the corresponding recycled products and characterized in terms of thermal and mechanical performance. Ac2O-deaminated polyols led to structurally unstable foams with poor compressive strength, while 2-EHGE-deaminated products allowed the production of foams with improved mechanical performance and unaltered thermal conductivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Milling Medium&#8208;Free Suzuki Coupling by Direct Mechanocatalysis: From Mixer Mills to Resonant Acoustic Mixers
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Don't LAG behind: Liquid&#8208;assisted grinding can compensate for the absence of milling balls in direct mechanocatalysis by adjusting the rheology. The LAG sweet spot is the same for resonance acoustic mixer and ball&#8208;free mixer mills, thus facilitating a smooth transfer from one method to the other. The new catalyst system maintains its high activity for over 20 reactions with negligible Pd contamination.







Abstract
Here we describe the development of a sustainable and cost&#8208;effective approach for catalytic cross&#8208;coupling reactions in mechanochemistry. It is found that the substrate&#8216;s impact with the vessel wall alone is sufficient to initiate the reaction, thus indicating that milling balls function primarily as a mixing agent for direct mechanocatalytic Suzuki coupling. The absence of milling balls can be offset by adjusting the rheology using liquid&#8208;assisted grinding (LAG). The LAG sweet spot of 0.25&#8197;&#956;L&#8201;mg&#8722;1 is confirmed for both resonance acoustic mixers (RAMs) and ball&#8208;free mixer mills, and is higher than in the presence of milling balls. RAMs exhibit excellent performance in the Suzuki reaction, achieving yields of 90&#8201;% after 60&#8197;min and complete conversion after 90&#8197;min. The longevity of the milling vessel is significantly improved in a RAM, allowing for at least 20 reactions without deterioration.

         <title>From One&#8208;dimensional Disordered Racemate to Ordered Racemic Conglomerates through Metal Coordination Driven Self&#8208;Assembly at the Liquid&#8208;Solid Interface</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In recent years, there has been significant focus on investigating and controlling chiral self&#8208;assembly, specifically in the context of enantiomeric separation. This study explores the self&#8208;assembly behavior of 4&#8208;dodecyl&#8208;3,6&#8208;di(2&#8208;pyridyl)pyridazine (DPP&#8208;C12) at the interface between heptanoic acid (HA) and highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) using a combination of scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and multiscale molecular modeling. The self&#8208;assembled monolayer structure formed by DPP&#8208;C12 is periodic in one direction, but aperiodic in the direction orthogonal to it. These structures resemble 1D disordered racemic compounds. Upon introducing palladium [Pd(II)] ions, complexing with DPP&#8208;C12, these 1D disordered racemic compounds spontaneously transform into 2D racemic conglomerates, which is rationalized with the assistance of force&#8208;field simulations. Our findings provide insights into the regulation of two&#8208;dimensional chirality.</dc:description>

         <title>Cd/Cd(OH)2 Nanosheets Enhancing the Electrocatalytic Activity of CO2 Reduction to CO</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electric&#8208;driven conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2) to carbon monoxide (CO) under mild reaction conditions offers a promising approach to mitigate the greenhouse effect and the energy crisis. The surface engineering is believed to be one of the prospective methods for enhancing the electrocatalytic activity&#160;of CO2 reduction. Herein, the hydroxyl (OH) groups were successfully introduced to cadmium nanosheets to form cadmium and cadmium hydroxide nanocomposites (i.e. Cd/Cd(OH)2 nanosheets) via a facile two&#8208;step method. The as&#8208;prepared Cd/Cd(OH)2/CP (CP indicates carbon paper) electrode displays excellent electrocatalytic activity for CO2 reduction to produce CO. The Faradaic efficiency of CO reaches 98.3% and the current density achieves 23.8 mA cm&#8208;2 at &#8208;2.0 V vs. Ag/Ag+ in a CO2&#8208;saturated 30 wt% 1&#8208;butyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazole hexafluorophosphate ([Bmim]PF6)&#8208;65 wt% acetonitrile (CH3CN)&#8208;5 wt% water (H2O) electrolyte. And the CO partial current density can reach up to 71.6 mA cm&#8208;2 with the CO Faradaic efficiency of more than 85% at &#8208;2.3 V vs. Ag/Ag+, which stands out against Cd/CP, Cd(OH)2/CP, and Cd/CdO/CP electrodes. The excellent electrocatalytic performance of the Cd/Cd(OH)2/CP electrode can be attributed to its unique structural properties, suitable OH groups, perfect interaction with electrolyte, abundant active sites and fast electron transfer rate.</dc:description>

         <title>Probing Radical Addition to 1&#8208;Phosphabutadienes by Employing Muonium as a &#8220;Light Isotope&#8221; of Hydrogen</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Understanding free radical addition to multiple bonds is important to elucidating the mechanistic details of addition polymerization reactions, albeit the fleeting radical intermediates are very difficult to detect by conventional methodologies. Muon spin spectroscopy (&#181;SR) is a highly sensitive method that can detect radical species at 106 spins (cf. EPR: 1012 spins, NMR: 1018 spins). Herein, we employ &#181;SR to detect the radical&#8208;addition products from three 1&#8208;phosphabutadiene monomers, P&#8208;analogues of isoprene. We show that muonium (Mu), a &#8220;light&#8221; H&#8208;atom surrogate, adds predominantly at the C4 position of the P1=C2&#8211;C3=C4 moiety to give unprecedented 1&#8208;phosphaallyl radicals as the major products. Our structural assignments are supported by assignment of muon, phosphorus and proton hyperfine coupling constants using DFT&#8208;calculations. A minor radical product is also detected that is tentatively assigned to an PC3&#8208;heterocyclic free radical. On the basis of DFT&#8208;predictions, we speculate that its formation may involve initial addition of Mu+ at the C3 position followed by electron capture. These studies provide rare insights into the prospective radical (or cationic) polymerization of 1&#8208;phosphabutadienes, which have previously been polymerized using anionic initiation.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering a Cl&#8208;&#8208;Modulated Light&#8208;Driven Na+ Pump</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Microbial Na+&#8208;pumping rhodopsin (NaR) is a promising optogenetic tool due to its unique ability to transport Na+. Like most rhodopsin&#8208;based tools, NaR is limited to light&#8208;based control. In this study, our objective was to develop a novel mode of modulation for NaR beyond light control. By introducing a potential Cl&#8208; binding site near the putative Na+ release cavity, we engineered Nonlabens dokdonensis rhodopsin 2 (NdR2) to be modulated by Cl&#8208;, an essential chemical in organisms. The engineered NdR2 demonstrated an approximately two&#8208;fold increase in Na+ pump activity in the presence of 100 mM Cl&#8208; compared to Cl&#8208;&#8208;free solution. Increasing Cl&#8208; concentration decreased the lifetimes of the M and O intermediates accordingly. The analysis of competitive ion uptake suggested the bound Cl&#8208; may increase the Na+ affinity and selectivity. This chemical modulation allows for more diverse and precise control over cellular processes, advancing the development of next&#8208;generation optogenetic tools. Notably, our Cl&#8208;&#8208;modulated NdR2 establishes an innovative mechanism for linking Cl&#8208; to Na+&#8208;related processes, with potential applications in optogenetic therapies for related diseases.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Recently, it has become imperative to develop high energy density as well as high safety lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBS) to meet the growing energy demand. Among the anode materials used in LIBs, the currently used commercial graphite has low capacity and is a safety hazard due to the formation of lithium dendrites during the reaction. Among the transition metal oxide (TMO) anode materials, TMO based on the intercalation reaction mechanism has a more stable structure and is less prone to volume expansion than TMO based on the conversion reaction mechanism, especially the niobium&#8208;based oxide in it has attracted much attention. Niobium&#8208;based oxides have a high operating potential to inhibit the formation of lithium dendrites and lithium deposits to ensure safety, and have stable and fast lithium ion transport channels with excellent multiplicative performance. This review summarizes the recent developments of niobium&#8208;based oxides as anode materials for lithium&#8208;ion batteries, discusses the special structure and electrochemical reaction mechanism of the materials, the synthesis methods and morphology of nanostructures, deficiencies and improvement strategies, and looks into the future developments and challenges of niobium&#8208;based oxide anode materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Facile Synthesis of Multifunctional Ni(OH)2&#8208;supported Core&#8208;shell Ni@Pd Nanocomposites for the Electro&#8208;oxidation of Small Organic Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the domain of proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs), the development of efficient and durable catalysts for the electro&#8208;oxidation of  small  organic molecules, especially of alcohols (methanol, ethanol, ethylene glycol, et al.) has always been a hot topic. A large number of related electrocatalysts with splendid performance have been designed and synthesized till now, while the preparation processes of most of them are demanding on experimental operations and conditions. Herein, we put forward a facile and handy method for the preparation of multifunctional Ni(OH)2&#8208;supported core&#8208;shell Ni@Pd nanocomposites (Ni(OH)2/Ni@Pd NCs) with the assistance of galvanic replacement reaction (GRR) at room temperature and ambient pressure. As expected, the Ni(OH)2 substrate can prevent the aggregation of core&#8208;shell (CS) Ni@Pd nanoparticles (NPs) and inhibit the formation of COads and further prevent Pd from being poisoned. The synergistic effect between CS Ni@Pd NPs and Ni(OH)2 substrate and the electronic effect between Pd shell and Ni core contribute to the outstanding electrocatalytic performance for methanol, ethanol, and ethylene glycol oxidation in alkaline condition. This study provides a succinct method for the design and preparation of efficient Pd&#8208;based electrocatalysts for alcohol electro&#8208;oxidation.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Exfoliation of Graphene Oxide: Unveiling Structural Properties and Electrochemical Performance</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Between the sheets: The Intercalation&#8208;Exfoliation (I&#8208;E) method was successfully applied to produce graphene oxide (GO) materials with adjustable oxidation levels, defect density, and crystallite size by tuning applied potential and electrolyte concentration. Investigating the electrochemical properties of these GO samples via CV and EIS measurements with a selected redox probe establishes meaningful correlations between their structural features and performance.







Abstract
An electrochemical exfoliation method for the production of graphene oxide and its characterization by electrochemical techniques are presented here. Graphite rods are used as working electrode in a three&#8208;electrode electrochemical cell, and electro&#8208;exfoliation is achieved by applying anodic polarization in a sulfuric acid solution. The electrochemical process involved two steps characterized by an intercalation at lower potential and an exfoliation at higher potential. The electrochemical behavior of the produced GO is studied through cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). X ray Photoelectronic Spectroscopy (XPS), Raman spectroscopy, Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) are employed to characterize the structural and chemical properties of the exfoliated GO. The results demonstrate that the electrochemical exfoliation method yields GO materials with varying degrees of oxidation, defect density, and crystallite size, depending on the applied potential and acid concentration. The graphene oxide samples exhibited distinct electrochemical properties, including charge transfer resistance, interfacial capacitance, and relaxation times for the charge transfer, as revealed by CV and EIS measurements with a specifically selected redox probe. The comprehensive characterization performed provides valuable insights into the structure&#8208;property relationships of the GO materials synthesized through electrochemical exfoliation of graphite.

         <title>Molecular Syringe for Cargo Photorelease: Red&#8208;Light&#8208;Triggered Supramolecular Hydrogel</title>

Red&#8208;y, steady, drop: Molecular syringe is a peptide&#8208;derived photochromic hydrogel that can be loaded with cargo and then release the guest when biocompatible red light illuminates it under physiological conditions.







Abstract
Photochromic supramolecular hydrogels are versatile materials that show macroscopic effects upon irradiation, like liquefaction or shape changes. Here, we demonstrate a simple photochromic cyclic dipeptide (2,5&#8208;diketopiperazine&#8208;based) supergelator, composed of (S)&#8208;lysine and an azobenzene analogue of phenylalanine, that forms supramolecular hydrogels even at 0.1&#8197;wt% loading. The gels can physically encapsulate cargo molecules and release them to the environment in a controllable manner upon irradiation with red light, thus working as a &#8220;molecular syringe&#8221;. As the material is biocompatible and operational in the &#8220;therapeutic window&#8221; of light (&gt;650&#8197;nm) that deeply penetrates soft human tissues, it is applicable to smart drug&#8208;delivery systems.

         <title>Gold(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Ring&#8208;Closing Alkyne&#8208;Carbonyl Metathesis for the Synthesis of Butenolides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;closing alkyne&#8208;carbonyl metathesis has been developed to construct &#947;&#8208;butenolides and related naturally occurring compounds, featuring the concurrent formation of a carbon&#8208;carbon double bond and a ketone group in 100&#8201;% atom economy.







Abstract
Alkyne&#8208;carbonyl metathesis is a type of carbon&#8208;carbon forming reaction involving the construction a carbon&#8208;carbon double bond and a carbonyl group in one transformation. Herein, a Au(I)&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;closing alkyne&#8208;carbonyl metathesis protocol has been developed to make densely substituted &#947;&#8208;butenolides from propargyl &#945;&#8208;ketoesters. It features 100&#8201;% atom economy, excellent substrate flexibility and benign functional group tolerance. Mechanistic studies demonstrate that the coordinative interaction between the gold catalyst and the alkyne might initiate the transfer of an oxygen atom and the formation of the carbon&#8208;carbon double bond. By using this gold&#8208;catalyzed ring&#8208;closing alkyne&#8208;carbonyl metathesis as a key step reaction, four naturally occurring butenolide&#8208;type compounds including decumbic acid (45&#8201;% yield for 3&#8197;steps), deoxyisosporothric acid (32&#8201;% yield for 5&#8197;steps), lichesterinic acid (34&#8201;% yield for 5&#8197;steps) and isomuronic acid (6&#8201;% yield for 8&#8197;steps) have been synthesized starting from commercially available starting materials.

         <title>Dipolarophile&#8208;Steered Formal Stereodivergent Synthesis of 2,5&#8208;cis/trans&#8208;Pyrrolidines Based on Asymmetric 1,3&#8208;Dipolar Cycloaddition of Imino Lactones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The formal diastereodivergent asymmetric synthesis of 2,5&#8208;cis/trans pyrrolidines was achieved by using a different type of activated alkenes. The silver complex&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition of imino lactones with ylidene&#8208;isoxazolones, and subsequent transformation afforded chiral pyrrolidines with 2,5&#8208;trans diastereoselectivity. In contrast, 2,5&#8208;cis substituted pyrrolidines were obtained by the reaction of imino lactones with acyclic enones.







Abstract
The stereodivergent asymmetric synthesis of 2,5&#8208;trans/cis pyrrolidines by 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition using two different types of activated alkenes is described. When ylidene&#8208;isoxazolones were employed as dipolarophiles, the Ag/(S,Sp)&#8208;iPr&#8208;FcPHOX&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric [3+2] cycloaddition of imino lactones proceeded with 2,5&#8208;trans selectivity. Subsequent decarboxylation of the isoxazolone rings produced pyrrolidines with 2,5&#8208;trans stereoretention. In the reaction using acyclic enones as activated alkenes, the Ag/(R,Sp)&#8208;ThioClickFerrophos complex&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric [3+2] cycloaddition afforded 2,5&#8208;cis substituted pyrrolidines in high yields and enantioselectivities. Therefore, these methods can be considered as a formal stereodivergent synthesis of 2,5&#8208;cis/trans pyrrolidines.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stereodivergent asymmetric synthesis of 2,5-&lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt; pyrrolidines by 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition using two different types of activated alkenes is described. When ylidene-isoxazolones were employed as dipolarophiles, the Ag/(&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;)-&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;Pr-FcPHOX-catalyzed asymmetric [3+2] cycloaddition of imino lactones proceeded with 2,5-&lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt; selectivity. Subsequent decarboxylation of the isoxazolone rings produced pyrrolidines with 2,5-&lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt; stereoretention. In the reaction using acyclic enones as activated alkenes, the Ag/(&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;)-ThioClickFerrophos complex-catalyzed asymmetric [3+2] cycloaddition afforded 2,5-&lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt; substituted pyrrolidines in high yields and enantioselectivities. Therefore, these methods can be considered as a formal stereodivergent synthesis of 2,5-&lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt; pyrrolidines.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Non&#8208;Hydrolysable Analogues of Cyclic and Branched Condensed Phosphates: Chemistry and Chemical Proteomics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chemical proteomics approach for non&#8208;linear polyphosphates: Pull&#8208;down probes of non&#8208;hydrolysable analogues of cyclic and branched condensed phosphates, called meta&#8208; and ultraphosphonates, were developed to explore the elusive interactome of meta&#8208; and ultraphosphates. Application to yeast cell extracts provided datasets of potential interactors. In addition, condensation reactions of meta&#8208; and ultraphosphonates were studied in this work.







Abstract
Studies into the biology of condensed phosphates almost exclusively cover linear polyphosphates. However, there is evidence for the presence of cyclic polyphosphates (metaphosphates) in organisms and for enzymatic digestion of branched phosphates (ultraphosphates) with alkaline phosphatase. Further research of non&#8208;linear condensed phosphates in biology would profit from interactome data of such molecules, however, their stability in biological media is limited. Here we present syntheses of modified, non&#8208;hydrolysable analogues of cyclic and branched condensed phosphates, called meta&#8208; and ultraphosphonates, and their application in a chemical proteomics approach using yeast cell extracts. We identify putative interactors with overlapping hits for structurally related capture compounds underlining the quality of our results. The datasets serve as starting point to study the biological relevance and functions of meta&#8208; and ultraphosphates. In addition, we examine the reactivity of meta&#8208; and ultraphosphonates with implications for their &#8220;hydrolysable&#8221; analogues: Efforts to increase the ring&#8208;sizes of meta&#8208; or cyclic ultraphosphonates revealed a strong preference to form trimetaphosphate&#8208;analogue structures by cyclization and/or ring&#8208;contraction. Using carbodiimides for condensation, the so far inaccessible dianhydro product of ultraphosphonate, corresponding to P4O112&#8722;, was selectively obtained and then ring&#8208;opened by different nucleophiles yielding modified cyclic ultraphosphonates.

         <title>Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution using a Nickel&#8208;based Calixpyrrole Complex: Controlling the Secondary Coordination Sphere on an Electrode Surface</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nickel calixpyrrole complex with pendant amine groups is reported, which forms a heterogeneous hydrogen evolution catalyst using anilinium tetrafluoroborate as the proton source. Turnover frequencies (TOF) up to 25,900&#8197;s&#8722;1 or 366,000&#8197;s&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 were observed and a proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) process involving the pendant amine groups was found to be rate&#8208;limiting.Twitter usernames: SuesGroup







Abstract
Incorporating design elements from homogeneous catalysts to construct well defined active sites on electrode surfaces is a promising approach for developing next generation electrocatalysts for energy conversion reactions. Furthermore, if functionalities that control the electrode microenvironment could be integrated into these active sites it would be particularly appealing. In this context, a square planar nickel calixpyrrole complex, Ni(DPMDA) (DPMDA=2,2&#8242;&#8208;((diphenylmethylene)bis(1H&#8208;pyrrole&#8208;5,2&#8208;diyl))bis(methaneylylidene))bis(azaneylylidene))dianiline) with pendant amine groups is reported that forms a heterogeneous hydrogen evolution catalyst using anilinium tetrafluoroborate as the proton source. The supported Ni(DPMDA) catalyst was surprisingly stable and displayed fast reaction kinetics with turnover frequencies (TOF) up to 25,900&#8197;s&#8722;1 or 366,000&#8197;s&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Kinetic isotope effect (KIE) studies revealed a KIE of 5.7, and this data, combined with Tafel slope analysis, suggested that a proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) process involving the pendant amine groups was rate&#8208;limiting. While evidence of an outer&#8208;sphere reduction of the Ni(DPMDA) catalyst was observed, it is hypothesized that the control over the secondary coordination sphere provided by the pendant amines facilitated such high TOFs and enabled the PCET mechanism. The results reported herein provide insight into heterogeneous catalyst design and approaches for controlling the secondary coordination sphere on electrode surfaces.

         <title>Access to Chiral O,O&#8208;Acetals Enabled by Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Addition of Oximes to Alkoxyallenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and stereoselective coupling of oximes and alkoxy allenes enables the access to enantiomerically pure O,O&#8208;acetals, in which the hydrogen bonding interaction between the amide group of the diphosphine ligand and the alkoxy allene is decisive for the high enantioselectivity.







Abstract
Enantiomerically pure acyclic O,O&#8208;acetal compounds (up to 97&#8201;%&#8197;ee) have been accessed through chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and enantioselective palladium&#8208;catalyzed addition of oximes to alkoxyallenes. DFT calculations support that a protonative hydropalladation pathway is favourable, in which the hydrogen bonding interaction between the amide group of the diphosphine ligand and the alkoxyallene is critical for the highly stereoselective formation of the dioxygenated stereogenic center.

         <title>Synthesis of the A&#8211;F Fragment of the Pacific Ciguatoxin CTX3C by Iterative Ring&#8208;Closing Metathesis and Tsuji&#8208;Trost Allylation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The fully functionalized A&#8211;F fragment of the Pacific ciguatoxin CTX3C has been synthesized from a derivative of D&#8208;glucal, which serves as the B&#8208;ring. Rings A and C were introduced to either side of ring B by ring&#8208;closing diene and enyne metathesis (RCM).

         <title>Dioxygen Activation and Reduction by a Soluble Iron Phthalocyanine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Iron ions in a square&#8208;planar coordination can bind molecules at the vacant axial positions and are able to transform them in stoichiometric and catalytic reactions. Nature takes advantage of these properties by incorporating iron into porphyrin systems, which play a key role not only in the binding and transport of oxygen, but also in catalytic oxidation and reduction reactions involving cytochrome P450. Although these systems have been studied extensively, there are still unresolved questions regarding the interplay between the iron ions and the surrounding ligands. Phthalocyanines (Pc) create a similar environment for metal atoms and FePc is known for a long time. However, without axial ligands FePc aggregates leading to solids of low solubility. In this work we used a known six&#8208;coordinate iron phthalocyanine derivative with bulky substituents and removed the stabilizing axial ligands. The resulting paramagnetic, four&#8208;coordinate compound does not aggregate and dissolves well so that NMR spectroscopy can be employed for studying the molecular structure and the reactivity. Solvent molecules bind weakly to the iron centers and oxygen is reduced in the presence of H&#8208;atom donors. The stoichiometric and catalytic reactivity with oxygen was studied in more detail.</dc:description>

         <title>Reversible Binding of Hydrogen and Styrene Coordination on a Manganese Phosphenium Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Co&#8208;photolysis of two simple N&#8208;heterocyclic phosphenium complexes with H2 proceeds in one case under cooperative addition of H2 across the P=Mn double bond and in the other case via decarbonylation without participation of H2. The origin of this divergence and preliminary results on the passing on of the H2 molecule to styrene are discussed.







Abstract
The reactions of two complexes [(RNHP)Mn(CO)4] (RNHP=N&#8208;arylated N&#8208;heterocyclic phosphenium) with H2 at elevated pressure (&#8776;4&#8197;bar) were studied by NMR spectroscopy. Irradiation with UV light initialized in one case (5&#8201;a, R=Dipp) the unselective formation of (RNHP&#8208;H)MnH(CO)4] (6&#8201;a) via cooperative addition of H2 across the Mn=P double bond. In the other case (5&#8201;b, R=Mes), addition of H2 was unobservable and the reaction proceeded via decarbonylation to a dimeric species [(RNHP)2Mn2(CO)7] (7&#8201;b) that was isolated and identified spectroscopically. Taking into account the outcome of further reaction studies under various conditions in the absence and presence of H2, both transformations can be explained in the context of a common mechanism involving decarbonylation to 7&#8201;a,b as the first step, and the different outcome is attributable to the fact that 7&#8201;b is unreactive towards both H2 and CO while 7&#8201;a is not. DFT studies relate this divergence to deviations in the molecular constitution and stability arising from a different level of steric congestion. Preliminary studies suggest further that 5&#8201;a/H2 as well as 6&#8201;a enable the photo&#8208;induced hydrogenation of styrene to ethyl benzene, even if the mechanism and possibly catalytic nature of this process remain yet unknown.

         <title>Reduced Graphene Oxide Modulated FeSe/C Anode Materials for High&#8208;Stable and Long&#8208;Life Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rGO layer on electrode exhibits robust adsorption energies towards EC, DEC, and K+&#8208;ions, regulating the EDL around electrode. The special behavior changes the SEI and markedly improves the reaction kinetics. Meanwhile, rGO with robust mechanical properties remains the integrity of SEI and FeSe/C@rGO electrode. Under these synergies, the anode exhibits excellent potassium storage properties.







Abstract
Reduced graphene oxide (rGO) has been demonstrated to effectively enhance the potassium storage performance of transition metal selenides due to its robust mechanical properties and high conductivity. However, the impact of rGO on the electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface, a crucial factor in the electrochemical performance of potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs), requires further exploration. In this study, we synthesized a seamless architecture of rGO on FeSe/C nanocrystals (FeSe/C@rGO). Comparative analysis between FeSe/C and FeSe/C@rGO reveals that the rGO layer exhibits robust adsorption energies towards EC and DEC, inducing the formation of organic&#8208;rich solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) without damage to the structural integrity. Furthermore, incorporating rGO triggers K+&#8208;ions into the double electrode layer (EDL), markedly improving the transport of K+&#8208;ions. As a PIB anode, FeSe/C@rGO exhibits a reversible capacity of 332&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 200&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 300 cycles, along with excellent long&#8208;term cycling stability, showcasing an ultralow decay rate of only 0.086&#8201;% per cycle after 1900 cycles at 1000&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1.

         <title>Electrochemical Synthesis of Phenothiazinone as Fluorophore and Its Application in Bioimaging</title>

         <dc:description>
Electrochemical synthesis of phenothiazinone via oxidative cyclocondensation of quinone and 2&#8208;aminothiophenol under mild condition is presented, along with its bio&#8208;application as fluorophore for lipid droplets imaging in living cells.







Abstract
Phenothiazinone is a promising yet underutilized fluorophore, possibly due to the lack of a general accessibility. This study reports a robust and scalable TEMPO&#8208;mediated electrochemical method to access a variety of phenothiazinones from 2&#8208;aminothiophenols and quinones. The electrosynthesis proceeds in a simple cell architecture under mild condition, and notably carbon&#8211;halogen bond in quinones remains compared to conventional methods, enabling orthogonal downstream functionalization. Mechanistic studies corroborate that TEMPO exerts a protective effect in avoiding product decomposition at the cathode. In particular, benzophenothiazinones show intriguing luminescence in both solid and solution state, and thus their photophysical properties are scrutinized in detail. Further bio&#8208;imaging of the lipid droplets in living cells highlights the considerable promise of benzophenothiazinones as fluorescent dye in the biomedical fields.

         <title>Dispersing LiCl in Zwitterionic COF for Highly Efficient Ammonia Storage and Separation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A zwitterionic covalent organic frameworks (COF) is proposed as a porous hosts to disperse LiCl for highly efficient NH3 storage and separation. The anionic and cationic groups in zwitterionic COF act as two separated positive and negative charged sites to facilitate the dispersion of lithium chloride, which makes LiCl doped zwitterionic COF exhibit excellent NH3 capture performance.







Abstract
Efficient and inherently safe NH3 storage and separation are of significant importance for the chemical industry. Herein, we proposed zwitterionic COF as a porous host to disperse LiCl for highly efficient NH3 storage and separation with record adsorption capacity. The equivalently cationic and anionic groups in the channels of zwitterionic COF could act as two separated sites to facilitate the dispersion of LiCl, hence the optimal composite exhibits a high capture capacity of 44.98&#8197;mmol/g at 25&#8201;&#176;C and 1&#8197;bar, far exceeding other existing porous materials. Notably, the adsorption capacity is completely reversible and the efficient separation of NH3 from NH3/CO2/N2 mixture is achieved through breakthrough experiments. DFT calculation combined with XPS and 7Li&#8197;NMR experimental results give insight into the interaction between zwitterionic COF and LiCl. This work extends possibilities for the development of efficient adsorbents for NH3 storage and separation.

The anionic and cationic groups in zwitterionic COF act as two separated positive and negative charged sites to facilitate the dispersion of lithium chloride, which makes LiCl doped zwitterionic COF exhibit excellent NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; capture performance.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Efficient and inherently safe NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; storage and separation are of significant importance for the chemical industry. Herein, we proposed zwitterionic COF as a porous host to disperse LiCl for highly efficient NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; storage and separation with record adsorption capacity. The equivalently cationic and anionic groups in the channels of zwitterionic COF could act as two separated sites to facilitate the dispersion of LiCl, hence the optimal composite exhibits a high capture capacity of 44.98&#8197;mmol/g at 25&#8201;&#176;C and 1&#8197;bar, far exceeding other existing porous materials. Notably, the adsorption capacity is completely reversible and the efficient separation of NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; from NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; mixture is achieved through breakthrough experiments. DFT calculation combined with XPS and &lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;Li&#8197;NMR experimental results give insight into the interaction between zwitterionic COF and LiCl. This work extends possibilities for the development of efficient adsorbents for NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; storage and separation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis of Functional Isosorbide&#8208;Based Polyesters and Polyamides by Passerini Three&#8208;Component Polymerization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new family of functional isosorbide&#8208;based polyesters and polyamides with high glass transition temperature are prepared via Passerini&#8208;three component polymerization (P&#8208;3CP). To optimize the P&#8208;3CP conditions, the influence of the polymerization solvent, temperature, feed ratio on the molar mass of final polymers are investigated. The higher molar mass (up to 10100 g/mol) and yield (&gt;70%) are achieved under mild conditions (30 &#176;C, standard atmosphere). Functional side groups, such as alkenyl, alkynyl and methyl ester, were introduced into polymer structure via P&#8208;3CP by using functional isocyanides. The obtained polyesters and polyamides are characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and infrared (IR) spectroscopies, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA). All polymers are thermal stable and amorphous with variable glass transition temperatures (Tg). The obtained polyester has Tg up to 87.5 &#176;C, while the Tg of polyamides (ISPA&#8208;2) is detected to be 97.5 &#176;C depending on the amide bonds in the polymer backbone and the benzene ring side groups. The cytotoxicity is investigated by the CCK&#8208;8 assay against mBMSC cells to confirm the biological safety. Overall, this novel strategy provides an efficient approach to produce functional isosorbide&#8208;based polyesters and polyamides, which are promising prospect for being applied to biodegradable materials.</dc:description>

         <title>New protocol for the synthesis of S&#8208;thioesters from benzylic, allylic and tertiary alcohols with thioacetic acid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new one&#8208;pot solvent&#8208;less reaction to convert benzylic, allylic, ferrocenyl or tertiary alcohols into S&#8208;thioesters, bench&#8208;stable and less odorous precursors of the corresponding thiols, which is based on reactions in neat thioacetic acid in the presence of tetrafluoroboric acid, is presented. Reaction monitoring by NMR and GC of the benzyl alcohol conversion indicated the intermediate formation of benzyl acetate and benzyl thionoacetate (PhCH2OC(S)CH3) prior to the slower conversion to the final S&#8208;benzyl thioacetate product. Increasing the HBF4 concentration enhanced the reaction rate, giving good to excellent yield (up to 99%) for a large scope of alcohols. Control experiments, with support of DFT calculations, have revealed a thermodynamically favorable, though requiring HBF4&#8208;activation, disproportionation of CH3C(O)SH to CH3C(O)OH and CH3C(S)SH, the latter immediately decomposing to H2S and (MeC)4S6 but also generating the hitherto unreported [MeC(O)C(Me)S]2(&#181;&#8208;S)2. Kinetic investigations demonstrated that the rate of benzyl alcohol conversion is second&#8208;order in [PhCH2OH] and second order in [HBF4], while the rate of conversion of the benzyl acetate intermediate to S&#8208;benzyl thioacetate is second order in [PhCOOMe] and fourth order in [HBF4].

         <title>Cold Plasma for Green Advanced Reduction/Oxidation Processes (AROPs) of Organic Pollutants in Water
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Plasma activation: These extremely reactive milieux attack any organic compound, including the most refractory environmental pollutants, leading to their mineralization. Depending on the specific target, suitable plasma sources can be developed for best performance. Cold plasmas offer the promise of novel technologies for PFAS degradation in water under ambient conditions using only (green) energy.







Abstract
Cold plasma is gaining increasing attention as a novel tool to activate energy demanding chemical processes, including advanced reduction/oxidation processes (AROPs) of organic pollutants in water. The very complex milieu generated by discharges at the water/plasma interface comprises photons, strong oxidants and strong reductants which can be exploited for achieving the degradation of most any kind of pollutants. Despite the complexity of these systems, the powerful arsenal of mechanistic tools and chemical probes of physical organic chemists can be usefully applied to understand and develop plasma chemistry. Specifically, the added value of air plasma generated by in&#8197;situ discharge with respect to ozonation (ex situ discharge) is demonstrated using phenol and various phenol derivatives and mechanistic evidence for the prevailing role of hydroxyl radicals in the initial attack is presented. On the reduction front, the impressive performance of cold plasma in inducing the degradation of recalcitrant perfluoroalkyl substances, which do not react with OH radicals but are attacked by electrons, is reported and discussed. The widely different reactivities of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and of perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA) underline the crucial role played in these processes by the interface between plasma and solution and the surfactant properties of the treated pollutants.

         <title>Zn&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks Using Triptycene Hexacarboxylate Ligands: Synthesis, Structure, and Gas&#8208;Sorption Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two types of zinc MOF, Zn&#8208;X2Trp and Zn&#8208;X2PET (X=H, F, Cl, Br, I, Me, Et, Pr), with difunctionalized triptycene&#8208;hexacarboxylate ligands H6X2Trp and H6X2PET that differ in size have been synthesized. All of these Zn&#8208;MOFs show high thermal stability as well as H2&#8208; and CO2&#8208;adsorption capacities. Moreover, MOFs with smaller pore size showed higher H2 and CO2 adsorption. Thus, the introduction of methyl, chloro, and bromo substituents at the bridgehead positions of the triptycene ligands enhances the H2&#8208; and CO2&#8208;adsorption capacities.







Abstract
A series of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) based on zinc ions and two triptycene ligands of different size have been synthesized under solvothermal conditions. Structural analyses revealed that they are isostructural 3D&#8208;network MOFs. The high porosity and thermal stability of these MOFs can be attributed to the highly rigid triptycene&#8208;based ligands. Their BET specific surface areas depend on the size of the triptycene ligands. In contrast to these surface&#8208;area data, the H2 and CO2 adsorption of these MOFs is larger for MOFs with small pores. Consequently, we introduced functional groups to the bridge&#8208;head position of the triptycene ligands and investigated their effect on the gas&#8208;sorption properties. The results unveiled the role of the functional groups in the specific CO2 binding via an induced interaction between adsorbates and the functional groups. Excellent H2 and CO2 properties in these MOFs were achieved in the absence of open metal sites.

         <title>Aluminium and Gallium Silylimides as Nitride Sources
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Terminal aluminium and gallium silylimides have been accessed for the first time by exploiting the oxidative reactions of anionic aluminium(I)/gallium(I) (&#8216;aluminyl&#8217;/&#8217;gallyl&#8217;) reagent with silylazides. These compounds feature minimal M=N &#960;&#8208;bonding and can be shown to act as sources of the nitride ion, [N]3&#8722; in reactions with CO or N2O.







Abstract
Terminal aluminium and gallium imides of the type K[(NON)M(NR)], bearing heteroatom substituents at R, have been synthesised via reactions of anionic aluminium(I) and gallium(I) reagents with silyl and boryl azides (NON=4,5&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropyl&#8208;anilido)&#8208;2,7&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;9,9&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;xanthene). These systems vary significantly in their lability in solution: the N(SiiPr3) and N(Boryl) complexes are very labile, on account of the high basicity at nitrogen. Phenylsilylimido derivatives provide greater stabilization through the &#960;&#8208;acceptor capabilities of the SiR3 group.

     alt="Aluminium and Gallium Silylimides as Nitride Sources**&amp;#xA;"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Terminal aluminium and gallium silylimides have been accessed for the first time by exploiting the oxidative reactions of anionic aluminium(I)/gallium(I) (&#8216;aluminyl&#8217;/&#8217;gallyl&#8217;) reagent with silylazides. These compounds feature minimal M=N &#960;-bonding and can be shown to act as sources of the nitride ion, [N]&lt;sup&gt;3&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; in reactions with CO or N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Terminal aluminium and gallium imides of the type K[(NON)M(NR)], bearing heteroatom substituents at R, have been synthesised via reactions of anionic aluminium(I) and gallium(I) reagents with silyl and boryl azides (NON=4,5-bis(2,6-diisopropyl-anilido)-2,7-di-tert-butyl-9,9-dimethyl-xanthene). These systems vary significantly in their lability in solution: the N(Si&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;Pr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) and N(Boryl) complexes are very labile, on account of the high basicity at nitrogen. Phenylsilylimido derivatives provide greater stabilization through the &#960;-acceptor capabilities of the SiR&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; group. K[(NON)AlN(Si&lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt;BuPh&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)] offers a workable compromise between stability and solubility, and has been completely characterized by spectroscopic, analytical and crystallographic methods. The silylimide species examined feature minimal &#960;-bonding between the imide ligand and aluminium/gallium, with the HOMO and HOMO-1 orbitals effectively comprising orthogonal lone pairs centred at N. Reactivity-wise, both aluminium and gallium silylimides can act as viable sources of nitride, [N]&lt;sup&gt;3&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, with systems derived from either metal reacting with CO to afford cyanide complexes. By contrast, only the gallium system K[(NON)Ga{N(SiPh&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)}] is capable of effecting a similar transformation with N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O to yield azide, N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

         <title>Beryllium&#8208;Mediated Halide and Aryl Transfer onto Silicon</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ring opening of hexamethylcyclotrisoloxane with BeBr2, BeI2 and BePh2 was observed. These reactions yielded previously unknown diorgano bromo and iodo silanolates, [Be3Br2(OSiMe2Br)4] and [Be3I2(OSiMe2I)4], respectively, as well as [Be3Ph2(OSiMe2Ph)4]. Hydrolysis of these beryllium silanolates revealed that dimethyl bromo and iodo silanol are unstable and react to various cyclic cyclosiloxanes.







Abstract
The reactivity of hexamethylcyclotrisiloxane (D3) towards BeCl2, BeBr2, BeI2 and [Be3Ph6]3 was investigated. While BeCl2 only showed unselective reactivity, BeBr2, BeI2 and [Be3Ph6] cleanly react to the trinuclear complexes [Be3Br2(OSiMe2Br)4], [Be3I2(OSiMe2I)4] and [Be3Ph2(OSiMe2Ph)4]. These unprecedented bromide, iodide and phenyl transfer reactions from a group II metal onto silicon offer a versatile access to previously unknown diorgano bromo and iodo silanolates.

         <dc:description>Amphiphobic fluoroalkyl chains are exploited for creating robust and diverse self&#8208;assembled biomimetic catalysts in aqueous solution. Long terminal perfluoroalkyl chains (CnF2n+1 with n = 6, 8, and 10) yoked with a short perhydroalkyl chains (CmH2m with m = 2 and 3) were used to synthesize several 1,4,7&#8208;triazacyclononane (TACN) derivatives, CnF2n+1&#8208;CmH2m&#8208;TACN. In the presence of an equimolar amount of Zn2+ ions that coordinate the TACN moiety and drive the self&#8208;assembly into micelle&#8208;like aggregates, the critical aggregation concentration of polyfluorinated CnF2n+1&#8208;CmH2mTACN&#183;Zn2+ was lowered by ~1 order of magnitude compared to the traditional perhyroalkyl counterpart with identical carbon number of alkyl chain. When 2&#8217;&#8208;hydroxypropyl&#8208;4&#8208;nitrophenyl phosphate was used as the model phosphate substrate, polyfluorinated CnF2n+1CmH2m&#8208;TACN&#183;Zn2+ assemblies showed higher affinity and catalytic activity, compared to its perhyroalkyl chain&#8208;based counterpart. Coarse&#8208;grained molecular dynamic simulations have been introduced to explore the supramolecular assembly of polyfluoroalkyl chains in the presence of Zn2+ ions and to better understand their enhanced catalytic activity.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is the key reaction in metal air and fuel cells. Among the catalysts towards ORR, carbon&#8208;based metal&#8208;free catalysts are getting more attention because of their maximum atom utilization, effective active sites and satisfactory catalytic activity and stability. However, the pyrolysis synthesis of these carbons resulted in disordered porosities and uncontrolled catalytic sites, which hindered us to achieve the catalysts&#8217; properties previously, and build the structure&#8211;property relationship at molecular level. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) constructed with designable building blocks have been employed as metal free electrocatalysts towards oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) due to their controlled skeletons, tailored pores size and environments, and well&#8208;defined location and kinds of catalytic sites. In this concept article, the development of metal&#8208;free COFs for ORR is summarized, and different strategies including skeletons regulation, linkages engineering and edge&#8208;sites modulation to improve the catalytic selectivity and activity are discussed. Furthermore, this Concept provides prospective for design and construction high electrocatalysts based on the catalytic COFs.</dc:description>

         <title>Optimization of 3D synthetic scaffolds for neuronal tissue engineering applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The increasing prevalence of neurodegenerative diseases has spurred researchers to develop advanced 3D models that accurately mimic neural tissues. Hydrogels stand out as ideal candidates as their properties closely resemble those of the extracellular matrix. A critical challenge in this regard is to comprehend the influence of the scaffold's mechanical properties on cell growth and differentiation, thus enabling targeted modifications. In light of this, a synthesis and comprehensive analysis of acrylamide&#8208;based hydrogels incorporating a peptide has been conducted. Adequate cell adhesion and development is achieved due to their bioactive nature and specific interactions with cellular receptors. The integration of a precisely controlled physicochemical hydrogel matrix and inclusion of the arginine&#8208;glycine&#8208;aspartic acid peptide sequence has endowed this system with an optimal structure, thus providing a unique ability to interact effectively with biomolecules. The analysis fully examined essential properties governing cell behavior, including pore size, mechanical characteristics, and swelling ability. Cell&#8208;viability experiments were performed to assess the hydrogel&#8217;s biocompatibility, while the incorporation of grow factors aimed to promote the differentiation of neuroblastoma cells. The results underscore the hydrogel&#8217;s ability to stimulate cell viability and differentiation in the presence of the peptide within the matrix.</dc:description>

         <title>Reticular Synthesis of Flexible Rare&#8208;Earth Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks: Control of Structural Dynamics and Sorption Properties Through Ligand Functionalization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An exciting direction in metal&#8208;organic frameworks involves the design and synthesis of flexible structures which can reversibly adapt their structure when triggered by external stimuli. Controlling the extent and nature of response in such solids is critical in order to develop custom dynamic materials for advanced applications. Towards this, it is highly important to expand the diversity of existing flexible MOFs, generating novel materials and gain an in&#8208;depth understanding of the associated dynamic phenomena, eventually unlocking key structure&#8208;property relationships. In the present work, we successfully utilized reticular chemistry for the construction of two novel series of highly crystalline, flexible rare&#8208;earth MOFs, RE&#8208;thc&#8208;MOF&#8208;2 and RE&#8208;teb&#8208;MOF&#8208;1. Extensive single&#8208;crystal to single&#8208;crystal structural analyses coupled with detailed gas and vapor sorption studies, shed light onto the unique responsive behavior. The development of these series is related to the reported RE&#8208;thc&#8208;MOF&#8208;1 solids which were found to display a unique continuous breathing and gas&#8208;trapping property. The synthesis of RE&#8208;thc&#8208;MOF&#8208;2 and RE&#8208;teb&#8208;MOF&#8208;1 materials represents an important milestone as they provide important insights into the key factors that control the responsive properties of this fascinating family of flexible materials and demonstrates that it is possible to control their dynamic behavior and the associated gas and vapor sorption properties.</dc:description>

The development of these series is related to the reported RE-thc-MOF-1 solids which were found to display a unique continuous breathing and gas-trapping property. The synthesis of RE-thc-MOF-2 and RE-teb-MOF-1 materials represents an important milestone as they provide important insights into the key factors that control the responsive properties of this fascinating family of flexible materials and demonstrates that it is possible to control their dynamic behavior and the associated gas and vapor sorption properties.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High Mannose Oligosaccharide Hemimimetics that Recapitulate the Conformation and Binding Mode to Concanavalin A, DC&#8208;SIGN and Langerin</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The "carbohydrate chemical mimicry" exhibited by sp2&#8208;iminosugars has been utilized to develop practical syntheses for analogs of the branched high&#8208;mannose&#8208;type oligosaccharides (HMOs) Man3 and Man5. In these compounds, the terminal nonreducing Man residues have been substituted with 5,6&#8208;oxomethylydenemannonojirimycin (OMJ) motifs. The resulting oligomannoside hemimimetic accurately reproduce the structure, configuration, and conformational behavior of the original mannoligosaccharides, as confirmed by NMR and computational techniques. Binding studies with mannose binding lectins, including concanavalin A, DC&#8208;SIGN, and langerin, by enzyme&#8208;linked lectin assay and surface plasmon resonance revealed significant variations in their ability to accommodate the OMJ unit in the mannose binding site. Intriguingly, OMJMan segments demonstrated "in line" heteromultivalent effects during binding to the three lectins. Similar to the mannobiose (Man2) branches in HMOs, the binding modes involving the external or internal monosaccharide unit at the carbohydrate binding domain exist in equilibrium, facilitating sliding and recapture processes. This equilibrium, which influences the multivalent binding of HMOs, can be finely modulated upon incorporation of the OMJ sp2&#8208;iminosugar caps. As a proof of concept, the affinity and selectivity towards DC&#8208;SIGN and langerin were adjustable by presenting the OMJMan epitope in platforms with diverse architectures and valencies.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Homocubane, a highly strained cage hydrocarbon, contains two very different positions for the introduction of a nitrogen atom into the skeleton, e.g., a position 1 exchange results in a tertiary amine whereas position 9 yields a secondary amine. Herein reported is the synthesis of 9&#8208;azahomocubane along with associated structural characterization, physical property analysis and chemical reactivity. Not only is 9&#8208;azahomocubane readily synthesized, and found to be stable as predicted, the basicity of the secondary amine was observed to be significantly lower than the structurally related azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptane, although similar to 1&#8208;azahomocubane.</dc:description>

Abstract
Earth&#8208;abundant photosensitizers are highly sought after for light&#8208;mediated applications, such as photoredox catalysis, depollution and energy conversion schemes. Homoleptic and heteroleptic copper(I) complexes are promising candidates in this field, as copper is abundant and the corresponding complexes are easily obtained in smooth conditions. However, some heteroleptic copper(I) complexes suffer from low (photo)stability that leads to the gradual formation of the corresponding homoleptic complex. Such degradation pathways are detrimental, especially when recyclability is desired. This study reports a novel approach for the heterogenization of homoleptic and heteroleptic Cu complexes on silica nanoparticles. In both cases, the photophysical properties upon surface immobilization were only slightly affected. Excited&#8208;state quenching with aryl diazonium derivatives occurred efficiently (108&#8211;1010&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1) with heterogeneous and homogeneous photosensitizers. Moderate but almost identical yields were obtained for the &#945;&#8208;arylation of enol acetate using the homoleptic complex in homogeneous or heterogeneous conditions. Importantly, the silica&#8208;supported photocatalysts were recycled with moderate loss in photoactivity over multiple experiments. Transient absorption spectroscopy confirmed that excited&#8208;state electron transfer occurred from the homogeneous and heterogeneous homoleptic copper(I) complexes to aryl diazonium derivatives, generating the corresponding copper(II) center that persisted for several hundreds of microseconds, compatible with photoredox catalysis applications.

         <title>Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Graphene Quantum Dots as Electrochemiluminescence&#8208;Emitting Species for Sensitive Detection of KRAS G12C Mutation via PET&#8208;RAFT
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nitrogen&#8208;doped graphene quantum dots (NGQDs) synthesized from different ratios of carbon and nitrogen sources have been systematically explored for their electrochemiluminescence (ECL) properties for the first time. And NGQDs as signal molecules combined with photo&#8208;induced electron/energy transfer reversible addition&#8208;fragment chain transfer (PET&#8208;RAFT) signal amplification strategy to construct a ECL biosensor for sensitive detection of KRAS G12C mutation was first reported.







Abstract
The levels of KRAS G12C point mutation is recognized to be closely related to the earlier diagnosis of non&#8208;small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Here, based on nitrogen&#8208;doped graphene quantum dots (NGQDs) and photo&#8208;induced electron/energy transfer reversible addition&#8208;fragment chain transfer (PET&#8208;RAFT) signal amplification strategy, we fabricated a novel electrochemiluminescence (ECL) biosensor for the detection of KRAS G12C mutation for the first time. NGQDs as ECL&#8208;emitting species with cathodic ECL were prepared by a simple calcination method. Firstly, KRAS G12C mutation DNA, i.&#8201;e., target DNA (tDNA), was captured by specific identification with hairpin DNA (hDNA). Then, PET&#8208;RAFT was initiated by blue light, and large numbers of monomers were successfully polymerized to form controllable polymer chains. Lastly, massive NGQDs was introduced via amidation reaction with N&#8208;(3&#8208;aminopropyl)methacrylamide hydrochloride (APMA), which significantly amplified the ECL signal intensity. Under optimal conditions, this biosensor achieved a good linear relationship between ECL intensity and logarithm of the levels of KRAS G12C mutation in the range from 10&#8197;fM to 10&#8197;nM. Moreover, this strategy exhibited high selectivity and excellent applicability for KRAS G12C mutation detection in the serum samples. Therefore, this biosensor has great potential in clinical diagnosis and practical application.

         <title>Slow Magnetization Relaxation in a Family of Triangular {CoIII2LnIII} Clusters: The Effect of Diamagnetic CoIII Ions on the LnIII Magnetic Dynamics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new family of heterometallic complexes, [CoIII2LnIII(OMe)2(naph)2(O2CMe)3(MeOH)2] (Ln=Tb (1), Dy (2), and Er (3)), possessing a rare {CoIII2Ln(&#956;3&#8208;OMe)}8+ triangular core, have been prepared; compounds 2 and 3, as well as the magnetic diluted analogue {Co2Dy0.05Y0.95} (2&#8201;a), behave as mononuclear single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs) with Ueff up to ~90&#8197;K.







Abstract
The first use of the Schiff base chelate N&#8208;naphthalidene&#8208;o&#8208;aminophenol (naphH2) in Co/Ln chemistry has afforded a family of isostructural [CoIII2LnIII(OMe)2(naph)2(O2CMe)3(MeOH)2] (Ln=Tb, Dy and Er) complexes, revealing a rare {CoIII2Ln(&#956;3&#8208;OMe)}8+ triangular core composed of two diamagnetic CoIII ions and a 4f&#8208;ion with slightly distorted square antiprismatic geometry. Alternating current (ac) magnetic susceptibility studies revealed that {Co2Dy}, and its magnetic diluted analogue {Co2Dy0.05Y0.95}, behave as mononuclear single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs) with similar energy barriers for the magnetization reversal, Ueff, of ~85&#8208;90&#8197;K. SMM properties were also detected for {Co2Er}, with the compound exhibiting a Ueff of 18.7&#8197;K under an applied magnetic field of 800&#8197;Oe. To interpret the experimental magnetic results, ab initio CASSCF/RASSI&#8208;SO and DFT calculations were performed as a means of exploring the single&#8208;ion characteristics of LnIII ions and comprehend the role of the diamagnetic CoIII ions in the magnetization relaxation of the three heterometallic compounds.

         <title>Synthesis of Partially Fluorinated Alkyl Triflates by Electrochemical Fluorination (Simons Process)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrosynthesis of partially fluorinated alkyl triflates and nonaflates by using electrochemical fluorination (ECF) has been developed; it provides access to CF3SO2OCH2F and CF3SO2OCHF2 as well as their deuterated analogs. Selected ethyl triflates and nonaflates are also accessible through ECF.







Abstract
A scalable straightforward synthesis of monofluoro&#8208; and difluoromethyl triflate CF3SO2OCH2F (MH2F) and CF3SO2OCHF2 (MHF2) through electrochemical fluorination (ECF, Simons process) of methyl triflate MH3 in anhydrous hydrogen fluoride at nickel anodes is presented. The ECF method is also feasible for the preparation of the deuterated analogues CF3SO2OCD2F (MD2F) and CF3SO2OCDF2 (MD2F). Surprisingly, no H/D exchange occurs during ECF of CF3SO2OCD3 (MD3); this provides further evidence for a NiF3/NiF4&#8208;mediated ECF mechanism. The ECF of selected partially fluorinated ethyl triflates is described, and electrochemical fluorination of CF3SO2OCH2CF3 (EH2F3) leads to the until now unknown chiral CF3SO2OCHFCF3 (EHFF3). The analogous fluoromethyl and fluoroethyl nonaflates are also accessible by ECF. This study contains detailed spectroscopic, structural, and thermal data on (fluoro)methyl and fluoro(ethyl) triflates.

         <title>Synthesis of Photochromic Phosphines by Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Annulation Reaction of Alkynes Bearing Phosphinyl Substituent with a Silacyclopropene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A methodological approach for the preparation of unconventional DTE&#8208;based photochromic phosphines is reported. It relies on the Pd&#8208;catalyzed annulation reaction of alkynyl phosphines in the presence of a silirene.







Abstract
The synthesis of phosphines with light controlled basicity is presented in this study. A methodological approach for the preparation of these unconventional photochromic phosphines based on a dithienylethene organic moiety is reported. It relies on the palladium&#8208;catalyzed annulation of alkynyl phosphines in the presence of a 2,3&#8208;Dithienylsilacyclopropene. Accordingly, a diphenyphosphino moiety is connected to the organic photochrome thanks to different linkers. Their influence on the photochromism and on the phosphinyl group basicity is studied and evaluated based on experimental an NMR descriptor as well as DFT calculations.

         <title>Tailoring the CO2 Hydrogenation Performance of Fe&#8208;Based Catalyst via Unique Confinement Effect of the Carbon Shell</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Core&#8208;shell structured Fe&#8208;based catalyst Na&#8722;Fe3O4@C with confinement effect delivered higher productivity of light olefins compared with the naked Na&#8722;Fe2O3 counterpart. Multiple characterization and DFT calculation verified that the timely carbon chain&#8208;growth termination, as well as unique CO2/H2 ratio and electronic property on the catalytic interface played vital roles in boosting light olefins synthesis.







Abstract
Even though Fe&#8208;based catalysts have been widely employed for CO2 hydrogenation into hydrocarbons, oxygenates, liquid fuels, etc., the precise regulation of their physicochemical properties is needed to enhance the catalytic performance. Herein, under the guidance of the traditional concept in heterogeneous catalysis&#8208;confinement effect, a core&#8208;shell structured catalyst Na&#8722;Fe3O4@C is constructed to boost the CO2 hydrogenation performance. Benefiting from the carbon&#8208;chain growth limitation, tailorable H2/CO2 ratio on the catalytic interface, and unique electronic property that all endowed by the confinement effect, the selectivity and space&#8208;time yield of light olefins (C2=&#8722;C4=) are as high as 47.4&#8201;% and 15.9&#8197;g&#8201;molFe&#8722;1&#8197;h&#8722;1, respectively, which are all notably higher than that from the shell&#8208;less counterpart. The function mechanism of the confinement effect in Fe&#8208;based catalysts are clarified in detail by multiple characterization and density functional theory (DFT). This work may offer a new prospect for the rational design of CO2 hydrogenation catalyst.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Electrochemical Reduction of Disulfides in an Undivided Cell under Mass Transfer Control</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical reductive cleavage of disulfides has been accomplished without the need for sacrificial metal anodes or a divided cell. Excellent conversion and selectivity toward the corresponding thiol can be achieved by tuning the current density at the electrodes. Very high current density at the anode creates a mass transfer barrier that impedes re&#8208;oxidation of the thiol generated at the cathode.







Abstract
Electroorganic synthesis is generally considered to be a green alternative to conventional redox reactions. Electrochemical reductions, however, are less advantageous in terms of sustainability, as sacrificial metal anodes are often employed. Divided cell operation avoids contact of the reduction products with the anode and allows for convenient solvent oxidation, enabling metal free greener electrochemical reductions. However, the ion exchange membranes required for divided cell operation on a commercial scale are not amenable to organic solvents, which hinders their applicability. Herein, we demonstrate that electrochemical reduction of oxidatively sensitive compounds can be carried out in an undivided cell without sacrificial metal anodes by controlling the mass transport to a small surface area electrode. The concept is showcased by an electrochemical method for the reductive cleavage of aryl disulfides. Fine tuning of the electrode surface area and current density has enabled the preparation of a wide variety of thiols without formation of any oxidation side products. This strategy is anticipated to encourage further research on greener, metal free electrochemical reductions.

Divided cell operation avoids contact of the reduction products with the anode and allows for convenient solvent oxidation, enabling metal free greener electrochemical reductions. However, the ion exchange membranes required for divided cell operation on a commercial scale are not amenable to organic solvents, which hinders their applicability. Herein, we demonstrate that electrochemical reduction of oxidatively sensitive compounds can be carried out in an undivided cell without sacrificial metal anodes by controlling the mass transport to a small surface area electrode. The concept is showcased by an electrochemical method for the reductive cleavage of aryl disulfides. Fine tuning of the electrode surface area and current density has enabled the preparation of a wide variety of thiols without formation of any oxidation side products. This strategy is anticipated to encourage further research on greener, metal free electrochemical reductions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Reductive Activation of Aryl Chlorides by Tuning the Radical Cation Properties of N&#8208;Phenylphenothiazines as Organophotoredox Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two photons are better than one: Intramolecular charge transfer in the intermediate radical cation of the N&#8208;phenylphenothiazines as photocatalysts improves the yields for borylation and phosphonylation of aryl chlorides.







Abstract
Aryl chlorides as substrates for arylations present a particular challenge for photoredox catalytic activation due to their strong C(sp2)&#8722;Cl bond and their strong reduction potential. Electron&#8208;rich N&#8208;phenylphenothiazines, as organophotoredox catalysts, are capable of cleaving aryl chlorides simply by photoinduced electron transfer without the need for an additional electrochemical activation setup or any other advanced photocatalysis technique. Due to the extremely strong reduction potential in the excited state of the N&#8208;phenylphenothiazines the substrate scope is high and includes aryl chlorides both with electron&#8208;withdrawing and electron&#8208;donating substituents. We evidence this reactivity for photocatalytic borylations and phosphonylations. Advanced time&#8208;resolved transient absorption spectroscopy in combination with electrochemistry was the key to elucidating and comparing the unusual photophysical properties not only of the N&#8208;phenylphenothiazines, but also of their cation radicals as the central intermediates in the photocatalytic cycle. The revealed photophysics allowed the excited&#8208;state and radical&#8208;cation properties to be fine&#8208;tuned by the molecular design of the N&#8208;phenylphenothiazines; this improved the photocatalytic activity.

         <title>Water&#8208;Soluble Arylazoisoxazole Photoswitches</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Water&#8208;soluble arylazoisoxazoles are introduced as an additional scaffold to the existing arylazoheteroarenes and open the door for tailor&#8208;made properties in molecular and materials chemistry. They were found to combine excellent photochromic behavior with long thermal life times. Supramolecular aggregates were formed by host&#8211;guest interaction and gelation.







Abstract
Azoheteroarenes are emerging as powerful alternatives to azobenzene molecular photoswitches. In this study, water&#8208;soluble arylazoisoxazole photoswitches are introduced. UV/vis and NMR spectroscopy revealed moderate to very good photostationary states and reversible photoisomerization between the E&#8208; and Z&#8208;isomers over multiple cycles with minimal photobleaching. Several arylazoisoxazoles form host&#8211;guest complexes with &#946;&#8208; and &#947;&#8208;cyclodextrin with significant differences in binding constants for each photoisomer as shown by isothermal titration calorimetry and NMR experiments, indicating their potential for photoresponsive host&#8211;guest chemistry in water. One carboxylic acid functionalized arylazoisoxazole can act as a hydrogelator, allowing gel properties to be manipulated reversibly with light. The hydrogel was characterized by rheological experiments, atom force microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. These results demonstrate that arylazoisoxazoles can find applications as molecular photoswitches in aqueous media.

         <title>Improved Catalytic Performance toward Selective Oxidation of Benzyl Alcohols Originated from New Open&#8208;Framework Copper Molybdovanadate with a Unique V/Mo Ratio</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A copper molybdovanadate with mixed&#8208;valent vanadium (V4+/V5+=4/3) and molybdenum (Mo5+/Mo6+=8/2) cations exhibits improved catalytic activity (conv.: 96.8&#8201;%) compared with the complex (Cpyr)5PV2Mo5W5O40 [conv.: 88.51&#8201;%, Cpyr=(C16H32C5H4N)+)] and could serve as a highly efficient heterogeneous catalyst in the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohols to benzaldehydes.







Abstract
A new organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid open&#8208;framework molybdovanadate with mixed&#8208;valences of vanadium (V4+/V5+=4/3) and molybdenum (Mo5+/Mo6+=8/2) cations has been synthesized. The complex possesses the unique V/Mo ratio (7/10), fascinating 8&#8208;C topological network and 1D 4&#8208;MR channels (7.793&#8197;&#197;&#215;6.699&#8197;&#197;). Importantly, its catalytic activities for the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde (oxidant: H2O2, 30&#8201;wt&#8201;%) have been well evaluated. The results indicated that it exhibited improved catalytic activities (conv.: 96.8&#8201;%) compared with the catalyst (Cpyr)5PV2Mo5W5O40 [conv.: 88.51&#8201;%, Cpyr=(C16H32C5H4N)+)], high recyclability and structural stability. Moreover, the conversions and selectivities (conv.: 82.4&#8211;92.5&#8201;%; sele.: 91.5&#8211;95.7&#8201;%) of the substrates containing electron donating groups (&#8722;OH, &#8722;CH3, &#8722;OCH3 and &#8722;Cl) were significantly higher than those of the substrate containing electron withdrawing group (&#8722;NO2) (conv. 67.4&#8201;%; sele.: 80.8&#8201;%). This is due to the fact that the &#8722;NO2 with a large Hammett substituent constant is not conducive to the generation of transition state products. The studies revealed the complex could act as a highly efficient heterogeneous catalyst in selective oxidation of benzyl alcohols.

         <title>Sulfone/Carbonyl&#8208;Based Donor&#8208;Acceptor Fluorescent Dyes: Synthesis, Structures, Photophysical Properties and Cell Imaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sulfone or carbonyl&#8208;based acceptor units were used to construct donor&#8208;acceptor conjugate organic fluorophores. Both TPA&#8208;SO and TPA&#8208;CO have solvent polarity&#8208;dependent photophysical properties for strong intramolecular charge transfer. As sulfone has weak intersystem crossing ability, TPA&#8208;SO has high fluorescence efficiency in solution and nanoparticles, and is a promising fluorescence dye.







Abstract
Electron&#8208;accepting units play vital roles in constructing donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) conjugated organic optoelectronic materials; the electronic structures and functions of the acceptors need to be carefully unveiled to controllably tailor the optoelectronic properties. We have synthesized two D&#8208;A conjugated organic fluorophores, TPA&#8208;SO and TPA&#8208;CO, with similar molecular skeletons based on sulfone&#8208; or carbonyl&#8208;containing polycyclic aromatic acceptors. Both TPA&#8208;SO and TPA&#8208;CO display obvious solvent polarity&#8208;dependent photophysical properties and large Stokes shift of over 100&#8197;nm for strong intramolecular charge transfer processes. Experimental evidence indicates that the sulfone group in TPA&#8208;SO merely serves as a strong electron&#8208;withdrawing unit. TPA&#8208;SO shows yellowish&#8208;green emission with a peak at 542&#8197;nm and an absolute photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 98&#8201;% in solution, whereas the carbonyl group in TPA&#8208;CO can act as both an electron&#8208;withdrawing unit and spin transition convertor, so TPA&#8208;CO displays red emission with a low absolute PLQY of 0.32&#8201;% in solution. Impressively, upon going from solution to aggregate state, TPA&#8208;SO nanoparticles keep a high PLQY of 9.5&#8201;% and moderate biocompatibility, thus they are good nano&#8208;agents for cellular fluorescence imaging. The results reveal that the inherent acceptor characteristic acts as a crucial effect in the photophysical properties and applications of the organic fluorophores.

         <title>Mechanochemical Oxidative Coupling of Amine to Azo&#8208;based Polymers by Hypervalent Iodine Oxidant</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Among porous organic polymers (POPs), azo&#8208;linked POPs represent a crucial class of materials, making them the focus of numerous catalytic systems proposed for their synthesis. However, the synthetic process is limited to metal&#8208;catalyzed, high&#8208;temperature, and liquid&#8208;phase reactions. In this study, we employ mechanochemical oxidative metal&#8208;free systems to encompass various syntheses of azo&#8208;based polymers. Drawing inspiration from the "rule of six" principle (six or more carbons on azide group render the organic compound relatively safe), an azo compound featuring significant steric hindrance is obtained using the hypervalent iodine oxidation strategy. Furthermore, during the polymerization process, steric hindrance is enhanced in monomers to effectively prevent explosions resulting from direct contact between hypervalent iodine oxidants and primary amines. Indeed, this approach provides a facile and innovative solid&#8208;phase synthesis method for synthesizing azo&#8208;based materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Review: Direct Lithium Extraction Using Intercalation Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Worldwide lithium (Li) demand has surged in recent years due to increased production of Li&#8208;ion batteries for electric vehicles and stationary storage. Li supply and production will need to increase such that the transition towards increased electrification in the energy sector does not become cost prohibitive. Many countries have taken policy steps such as listing Li as a critical mineral. Current commercial Li mining is mostly from dedicated mine sources, including ores, clays, and brines. The conventional ways to extract Li+&#160;from those resources are through chemical processing. The environmental and economic sustainability of conventional Li processing has recently received increased scrutiny. Routes such as direct Li+&#160;extraction may provide advantages relative to conventional Li+&#160;extraction technologies, and one possible route to direct Li+&#160;extraction includes leveraging of intercalation materials. Intercalation material processing has recently demonstrated high selectivity towards Li+&#160;as opposed to other cations. Reviews and reports of direct Li+extraction with intercalation materials are limited, even as this technology has started to show promise in smaller scale demonstrations. This paper will review selective Li+&#160;extraction via intercalation materials, including both electrochemical and chemical methods to drive Li+&#160;in and out and efforts to characterize the Li+&#160;insertion/deinsertion processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Benzylic C(sp3)&#8208;H bond oxidation with ketone selectivity by a cobalt(IV)&#8208;oxo embedded in a &#946;&#8208;barrel protein</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Artificial metalloenzymes have emerged as biohybrid catalysts that allow to combine the reactivity of a metal catalyst with the flexibility of protein scaffolds. Here, we report the artificial metalloenzymes based on the &#946;&#8208;barrel protein nitrobindin NB4, in which a cofactor [CoIIX(Me3TACD&#8208;Mal)]+X&#8208; (X = Cl, Br; Me3TACD = N,N&#180;,N&#180;&#180;&#8208;trimethyl&#8208;1,4,7,10&#8208;tetraazacyclododecane, Mal = CH2CH2CH2NC4H2O2) was covalently anchored via a Michael addition reaction. These biohybrid catalysts showed higher efficiency than the free cobalt complexes for the oxidation of benzylic C(sp3)&#8208;H bonds in aqueous media. Using commercially available oxone (2KHSO5&#183;KHSO4&#183;K2SO4) as oxidant, a total turnover number of up to 220 and 97% ketone selectivity were achieved for tetralin. As catalytically active intermediate, a mononuclear terminal cobalt(IV)&#8208;oxo species [Co(IV)=O]2+ was generated by reacting the cobalt(II) cofactor with oxone in aqueous solution and characterized by ESI&#8208;TOF MS.</dc:description>

(6&#8208;Dipp)CuB(OMe)2 was characterised by NMR spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray crystallography and shown to be a monomeric acyclic boryl of copper. (6&#8208;Dipp)CuB(OMe)2 reacted with ethylene and diphenylacetylene to provide insertion compounds into the Cu&#8208;B bond which were characterised by NMR spectroscopy in both cases and X&#8208;ray crystallography in the latter. It was also competent in the rapid catalytic deoxygenation of CO2 in the presence of excess B2(OMe)4. Alongside &#960;&#8208;insertion, (6&#8208;Dipp)CuB(OMe)2 reacted with LiNMe2 to provide a salt metathesis reaction at boron, giving (6&#8208;Dipp)CuB(OMe)NMe2, a second monomeric acyclic boryl, which also cuproborated diphenylacetylene. Computational interrogation validated these acyclic boryl species to be electronically similar to (6&#8208;Dipp)CuBpin.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereoselective Synthesis of Allylic Alcohols via Substrate Control on Asymmetric Lithiation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Allylic alcohols are a privileged motif in natural product synthesis and new methods that access them in a stereoselective fashion are highly sought after. Toward this goal, we found that chiral acetonide&#8208;protected polyketide fragments performing the Hoppe&#8211;Matteson&#8211;Aggarwal rearrangement in the absence of sparteine with high yields and diastereoselectivities rendering this protocol a highly valuable alternative to the Nozaki&#8211;Hiyama&#8211;Takai&#8211;Kishi reaction. Various stereodyads and &#8208;triads were investigated to determine their substrate induction. The mostly strong inherent stereoinduction was attributed to a combination of steric and electronic effects.</dc:description>

         <title>Conjugated Olefin Enabled Rollover Cyclometallation of Distant C&#8208;H Bonds: Regioselective Annulation of o&#8208;Alkenyl Phenols with Alkynes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although challenging, the distant C&#8208;H functionalization with precision is quite rewarding and has long been intriguing. Tailoring an appropriate template accomplishes the job but the prerequisite sets the limitation. We herein unveil our discovery of annulation of alkynes on to two distant (from directing group) C&#8208;H bonds through rollover cyclometallation assisted by conjugated C=C bond. The annulation follows a concomitant cyclization rewarding a rare triple C&#8208;H functionalization. The annulation is totally regioselective with an array of unsymmetrical alkynes, taking the leverage of an extended conjugation or a tertiary hydroxyl co&#8208;ordination. The mechanism is supported by control experiments, KIE &amp; labelling studies and Mass spectrometry.</dc:description>

The annulation is totally regioselective with an array of unsymmetrical alkynes, taking the leverage of an extended conjugation or a tertiary hydroxyl co-ordination. The mechanism is supported by control experiments, KIE &amp; labelling studies and Mass spectrometry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>gem&#8208;Difluoroolefination of Amides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A metal&#8208;free one&#8208;pot process for the gem&#8208;difluoroolefination of amides is described. The reaction is based on interaction of generated in situ &#945;&#8208;chloroiminium salts with difluorinated phosphorus ylide formed from difluorocarbene and triphenylphosphine. The olefination involves nucleophile&#8208;assisted dephosphorylation and proceeds within one hour at low temperature. The gem&#8208;difluoroenamines were used in further transformations leading to a variety of fluoroalkylated amines.</dc:description>

         <title>Living Self&#8208;Assembly of Metastable and Stable Two&#8208;Dimensional Platelets from a Single Small Molecule</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study reports the design of a donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) molecule with two fluorene units on each side of a benzothiadiazole moiety, which allows multiple intermolecular interactions to compete with one another so as to induce the evolution of the metastable 2D platelets to the stable 2D platelets during the self&#8208;assembly of the D&#8208;A molecule. Importantly, the living seeded self&#8208;assembly of metastable and stable 2D structures with precisely controlled sizes can be conveniently achieved using an appropriate supersaturated solution of the D&#8208;A molecule as the seeded growth medium that can temporarily hold the almost&#8208;proceeding spontaneous nucleation from competing with the seeded growth. The stable 2D platelets with smaller area sizes exhibit higher sensitivity to gaseous dimethyl sulfide, illustrating that the novel living self&#8208;assembly method provides more available functional structures with controlled sizes for practical applications. The key finding of this study is that the new living methodology is separated into two independent processes: the elaborate molecular design for various crystalline structures as seeds and the application of an appropriate supersaturated solution as the growth medium to grow the uniform structures with controlled sizes; this would make convenient and possible the living seeded self&#8208;assembly of rich 1D, 2D, and 3D architectures.</dc:description>

         <title>Total Chemical Synthesis of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Spike Receptor&#8208;Binding Domain</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 and its global spread have created an unprecedented public health crisis. The spike protein of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 has gained significant attention due to its crucial role in viral entry into host cells and its potential as both a prophylactic and a target for therapeutic interventions. Herein, we report the first successful total synthesis of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD), highlighting the key challenges and the strategies employed to overcome them. Appropriate utilization of advanced solid phase peptide synthesis and cutting&#8208;edge native chemical ligation methods have facilitated the synthesis of the protein molecule. We discuss problems encountered during the chemical synthesis and approaches taken to optimize the yield and the purity of the synthetic protein molecule. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the chemically synthesized spike RBD efficiently binds to the known mini&#8208;protein binder LCB1. The successful chemical synthesis of the spike RBD presented here can be utilized to gain valuable insights into SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike RBD biology, advancing our understanding and aiding the development of intervention strategies to combat future coronavirus outbreaks. The modular synthetic approach described in this study can be effectively implemented in the synthesis of other mutated variants or enantiomer of spike RBD for mirror&#8208;image drug discovery.</dc:description>

         <title>Dense NiCo2O4 Nanoneedles Grown on Carbon Foam Showing Excellent Electrochemical and Microwave Absorption Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electromagnetic pollution could harm sensitive electronic equipment due to the rising use of electronic devices and communication infrastructure. The supercapacitor's electrochemical performance should be enhanced, and electromagnetic damage should be prevented. This study proposes NiCo2O4/CF composites for supercapacitors and microwave absorption. They are made by combining hydrothermal and annealing processes. Dense NiCo2O4 nanoneedles were uniformly grown on the outer layer of carbon foam (CF) as a growth skeleton, preventing the agglomeration of NiCo2O4. The composite had a specific capacitance of 537.5 F/g at 1 A/g. When the current density was set to 1 A/g, the supercapacitor that used NiCo2O4/CF as the cathode had a specific capacitance of 70.7 F/g, and when the current density was increased to 10 A/g, the original specific capacitance of 87.2% could still be maintained after 5000 charge&#8208;discharge cycles. At a power density of 3695.5 W/kg, an energy density of 22.1 Wh/kg could be maintained. Furthermore, we performed a microwave absorption test and determined its reflection loss curve for various sample thicknesses. Recombination enhanced the composite material's microwave absorption capability by greatly reducing the dielectric loss and the magnetic loss.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalyst&#8208;Free Transfer Hydrogenation from Amine&#8208;Borane Small Oligomers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Amine&#8208;borane dimers and oligomers with varied steric and electronic profiles were prepared via capping agent&#8208;controlled AA/BB polycondensations. They were used for transfer hydrogenations to aldehydes, ketones, imines as well as electron&#8208;poor alkene/alkyne moieties. The amine&#8208;borane Lewis&#8208;paired oligomers and the congested bis(amine&#8208;borane)s provided the highest yields. This was likely helped by facilitated dissociation (oligomers) or H&#8208;bond assistance. In the case of the oligomers, the second equivalent of H2 present was also engaged in the reaction. Solid&#8208;state NMR characterization provides evidence that the Boron&#8208;containing materials obtained after transfer dehydrogenation are highly similar to those obtained from thermal dehydrogenation. The oligomers bridge the gap between simple amine&#8208;borane molecular reductants and the poly&#8208;amine&#8208;boranes and provide a full picture of the reactivity changes at the different scales.</dc:description>

         <title>Bimetallic Manganese Catalysts: A Route to Controlled and Switchable Polymerization of Lactones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The sustainable solution to the environmental problem of polymeric materials calls for efficient and well&#8208;controlled ring&#8208;opening polymerization catalytic systems. Inspired by the highly reactive and stereospecific bimetallic catalysts, three kinds of bimetallic Salen&#8208;Mn catalysts supported by biaryl linking moieties are synthesized and applied to polymerization catalysis of lactide (LA) and &#949;&#8208;caprolactone (&#949;&#8208;CL) in this work. The polymerization is initiated in situ by the ring&#8208;opening of epoxide compounds, in which the ionic cocatalyst could accelerate the reaction process. The Mn&#8208;Mn coordination effect contributes to the higher activity and iso&#8208;selectivity towards LA compared to the mononuclear Salen&#8208;Mn catalyst. The reactivity and stereoselectivity are determined by the conformation of catalysts, specifically the Mn&#8208;Mn separation and dihedral angle. Finally, the CO2&#8208;controlled switchable polymerizations are carried out with LA and &#949;&#8208;CL. The reversibility of the on&#8208;off switching operation is influenced by the combination between CO2 molecules and active species. The success in binuclear Salen&#8208;Mn catalysts not only expands the range of bimetallic catalyst analogues but also claims the promising potential of Mn&#8208;based catalysts in practical and theoretical research.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We use confocal laser scanning microscopy on the small, fluorescent resorufin dye molecule to visualize molecular accessibility and diffusion in the hierarchical, anisotropic pore structure of large (~10 &#181;m&#8208;sized) zeolite&#8208;&#946; crystals. The resorufin dye is widely used in life and materials science, but only in its deprotonated form because the protonated molecule is barely fluorescent in aqueous solution. In this work, we show that protonated resorufin is in fact strongly fluorescent when confined within the zeolite micropores enabling fluorescence microimaging experiments. We find that J&#8208;aggregation guest&#8211;guest interactions lead to a decrease in the measured fluorescence intensity, but is prevented by using non&#8208;fluorescent spacer molecules. By introducing resorufin from the outside solution and following its diffusion into zeolite&#8208;&#946; crystals, we characterize the pore space. The eventual homogeneous distribution of resorufin molecules throughout the zeolite indicates a fully accessible pore network. This enables the quantification of its diffusion coefficient in the straight pores of zeolite&#8208;&#946; without the need for complex analysis, and we find a value of 3 &#215; 10&#8722;15 m2 s&#8722;1. Furthermore, we visualize that diffusion through the straight pores of zeolite&#8208;&#946; is impeded when crossing the boundaries between zeolite sub&#8208;units.</dc:description>

         <title>Temperature&#8208;modulated Reversible Clustering of Gold Nanorods Driven by Small Surface Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Temperature&#8208;modulated colloidal phase of plasmonic nanoparticles is a convenient playground for resettable soft&#8208;actuators or colorimetric sensors.&#160;To render reversible clustering under temperature change, bulky ligands are required, especially if anisotropic morphologies are of interest.&#160;Here, we showcase thermoresponsive gold nanorods by employing small surface ligands, bis (p&#8208;sulfonatophenyl) phenyl&#8208;phosphine dihydrate dipotassium salt (BSPP) and native cationic surfactant.&#160;Temperature&#8208;dependent analysis in real&#8208;time allowed us to describe the structural features (interparticle distance and cluster size) as well as thermal parameters, melting and freezing temperatures. Our findings suggest that neither covalent Au&#8208;S bonds nor bulky ligands are required to obtain a robust thermoresponsive system based on anisotropic gold nanoparticles, paving the way to stimuli&#8208;responsive nanoparticles with a wide range of sizes and geometries.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogenation of Terminal Alkenes Catalyzed by Air&#8208;Stable Mn(I) Complexes Bearing an N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene&#8208;Based PCP Pincer Ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficient hydrogenations of terminal alkenes with molecular hydrogen catalyzed by well&#8208;defined bench stable Mn(I) complexes containing an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene&#8208;based PCP pincer ligand are described. These reactions are environmentally benign and atom economic, implementing an inexpensive, earth abundant non&#8208;precious metal catalyst. A range of aromatic and aliphatic alkenes were efficiently converted into alkanes in good to excellent yields. The hydrogenation proceeds at 100 oC with catalyst loadings of 0.25&#8208;0.5 mol %, 2.5 &#8208; 5 mol % base (KOtBu) and a hydrogen pressure of 20 bar.

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed bis&#8208;Borylation of Quinolines: The Importance of the Cobalt Triplet State</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report herein a mild stereo&#8208; and regioselective dearomatization of quinolines using the simple low valent HCo(N2)(PPh3)3 complex that exhibits labile ligands. Conditions to form selectively, at room temperature, high&#8208;valued 1,4&#8208;bis&#8208;borylated tetrahydroquinolines from simple starting heteroaromatic compounds have been developed. The efficient and selective functionalization of a large scope of quinolines bearing various electron&#8208;donating or electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents is presented, as well as the post&#8208;modification of the resulting C&#8211;B bond. NMR and labelling studies are consistent with a cascade mechanism pathway, starting from an in situ generated paramagnetic bis&#8208;quinoline cobalt(I) hydride complex. A first quinoline dearomatization followed by a cobalt(I)&#8208;catalyzed Markovnikov hydroboration of the remaining double bond allows the introduction of the boronic ester group only at C4 position. DFT calculations particularly highlight the importance of the cobalt triplet state throughout the reaction pathway, and bring some rationalization for the observed C4 selective borylation.</dc:description>

         <title>Hexaguanidino&#8208;Triptycenes and Triphenylenes: Electronic Coupling in Molecules Containing Three Redox&#8208;Active o&#8208;Diguanidinobenzene Units Connected either Directly or Interacting Through Homoconjucation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Novel redox&#8208;active hexaguanidine molecules with multiple redox states were synthesized by connecting three o&#8208;diguanidinobenzene units. In 2,3,6,7,14,15&#8208;hexaguanidino&#8208;triptycenes, the three redox&#8208;active o&#8208;diguanidinobenzene units are connected through C&#8208;C bonds to the sp3&#8208;hybridized bridgehead C atoms, and in 2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexaguanidino&#8208;triphenylenes they are directly connected. The connectivity difference leads to different electronic coupling between the three redox&#8208;active o&#8208;diguanidinobenzene units, with homoconjugation being present in the triptycene, but not in the triphenylene compounds. Motivated by the appearance of an intense low&#8208;energy electronic transition, we especially analysed the effect of homoconjugation on the electronic structure and charge delocalization in the dicationic redox state of the triptycene derivatives. Then, several trinuclear high&#8208;spin cobalt (and copper) complexes were synthesized with the triphenylene and triptycene ligands, and the magnetic coupling and redox properties analysed. By choice of the coligands (hexafluoroacetylacetonate, trifluoroacetylacetonate and acetylacetonate), oxidation could be switched between metal&#8208; and ligand&#8208;centered redox events, leading to drastic changes in the magnetic or optical properties, especially as a consequence of homoconjugation in the triptycene derivatives.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemistry and Biology of Podophyllotoxins&#8722;An Update</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Podophyllotoxin is an aryltetralin lignan lactone derived from different plants of Podophyllum. It consists of five rings with four chiral centers, one trans&#8208;lactone and one aryl tetrahydronaphthalene skeleton with multiple modification sites. Moreover, podophyllotoxin and its derivatives showed lots of bioactivities, including anticancer, anti&#8208;inflammatory, antiviral, and insecticidal properties. The demand for podophyllotoxin and its derivatives is rising as a result of their high efficacy. As a continuation of our previous review (Chem. Eur. J., 2017, 23, 4467&#8208;4526), herein we summarized total synthesis, biotransformation, structural modifications, bioactivities, and structure&#8208;activity relationships of podophyllotoxin and its derivatives from 2017 to 2022. Meanwhile, we compiled an update information on the origin of new podophyllotoxin analogues from plants from 2014 to 2022. We hope that this review will provide a reference for future high value&#8211;added applications of podophyllotoxin and its analogues in the pharmaceutical and agricultural fields</dc:description>

         <title>Acceptorless or Transfer Dehydrogenation of Glycerol Catalyzed by Base Metal Salt Cobaltous Chloride &#8211; Facile Access to Lactic Acid and Hydrogen or Isopropanol</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The dehydrogenation of glycerol to lactic acid (LA) under both acceptorless and transfer dehydrogenation conditions using readily available, inexpensive, environmentally benign and earth&#8208;abundant base metal salt CoCl2 is reported here. The CoCl2 (0.5 mol%) catalyzed acceptorless dehydrogenation of glycerol at 160 &#176;C in the presence of 0.75 equiv of KOH, gave up to 33% yield of LA in 44% selectivity apart from hydrogen. Alternatively, with acetone as a sacrificial hydrogen acceptor, the CoCl2 (0.5 mol%) catalyzed dehydrogenation of glycerol at 160 &#176;C in the presence of 1.1 equiv of NaOtBu resulted in up to 93% LA with 96% selectivity along with another value&#8208;added product isopropanol. Labelling studies revealed a modest secondary KIE of 1.68 which points to the involvement of C&#8208;H bond activation as a part of the catalytic cycle but not as a part of the rate&#8208;determining step. Catalyst poisoning experiments with PPh3 and CS2 are indicative of the homogeneous nature of the reaction mixture involving&#160;molecular species that are likely to be in&#8208;situ formed octahedral Co(II) as inferred from EPR, HRMS and Evans magnetic moment studies. The net transfer dehydrogenation activity is attributed to exclusive contribution from the alcoholysis step.</dc:description>

Alternatively, with acetone as a sacrificial hydrogen acceptor, the CoCl2 (0.5 mol%) catalyzed dehydrogenation of glycerol at 160 &#176;C in the presence of 1.1 equiv of NaOtBu resulted in up to 93% LA with 96% selectivity along with another value-added product isopropanol. Labelling studies revealed a modest secondary KIE of 1.68 which points to the involvement of C-H bond activation as a part of the catalytic cycle but not as a part of the rate-determining step. Catalyst poisoning experiments with PPh3 and CS2 are indicative of the homogeneous nature of the reaction mixture involving&#160;molecular species that are likely to be in-situ formed octahedral Co(II) as inferred from EPR, HRMS and Evans magnetic moment studies. The net transfer dehydrogenation activity is attributed to exclusive contribution from the alcoholysis step.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Rational design&#160;of a multifunctional benzothiadiazole derivative in organic photonics and electronics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In order to achieve a multifunctional compound with potential application in organic photonics and electronics, a multidonor benzothiadiazole derivative was rationally designed and synthesized employing microwave irradiation as energy source, increasing the process efficiency about yields and reaction times in comparison with conventional conditions. This powerful compound displayed solvatochromism and showed efficient behavior as red optical waveguide with low OLC around 10&#8208;2 dB &#956;m&#8208;1 and with the capacity of light transmission in two directions. In addition, the proposed derivative acted as efficient p&#8208;type semiconductor in organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs) with hole mobilities up 10&#8208;1 cm2V&#8208;1s&#8208;1. This corroborates its multifunctional character, thus making it a potential candidate to be applied in hybrid organic field&#8208;effect optical waveguides (OFEWs).</dc:description>

         <title>Bioinspired Functionalization of Carbonyl Compounds Enabled by Metal Chelated Bifunctional Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In Nature, enzymatic reactions proceed through exceptionally ordered transition states giving rise to extraordinary levels of stereoselection. In those reactions, the active site of the enzyme plays crucial roles &#8211; through one position, it holds the substrate in the proximity to the reaction epicentre that facilitates both the reactivity and stereoselectivity of the chemical process. Inspired by this natural phenomenon, synthetic chemists have designed bifunctional ligands that not only coordinate to a metal centre but also preassociate with an organic substrate, e.g. aldehyde and ketone, and exerts stereodirecting influence to accelerate the attack of the incoming reacting partner from a particular enantiotopic face. The chief goal of the current review is to give an overview of the recently developed approaches enabled by privileged bio&#8208;inspired bifunctional ligands that not only bind to the metal catalyst but also activates carbonyl substrates via organocatalysis, thereby easing in the new bond forming step. As carbonyl a&#8208;functionalizations are dominated by enamine and enolate chemistry, the current review primarily focusses on enamine&#8208; and enolate&#8208;metal catalysis by bifunctional ligands. Thus, developments based on traditional cooperative catalysis occurring through two directly coupled but independent catalytic cycles of an organocatalyst and a metal catalyst are not covered.</dc:description>

         <title>Revealing the unique role of water in the formation of benzothiazoles: an experimental and computational study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present here a joint experimental and computational study on the formation of benzothiazoles. Our investigation reveals a green protocol for accessing benzothiazoles from acyl chlorides using either water alongside a reducing agent as the reaction medium or in combination with stoichiometric amounts of a weak acid, instead of the harsh conditions and catalysts previously reported. Specifically, we show that a protic solvent, particularly water, enables the formation of 2&#8208;substituted benzothiazoles from N&#8208;acyl 1,2&#8208;aminothiophenols already at room temperature, without the need for strong acids or metal catalysts. DFT Molecular Dynamics simulations coupled with advanced enhanced sampling techniques provide a clear understanding of the catalytic role of water. We demonstrate how bulk water &#8211; due to its extended network of hydrogen bonds and an efficient Grotthus mechanism &#8211; provides a reaction path that strongly reduces the reaction barriers compared to aprotic environments, namely more than 80 kJ/mol for the first reaction step and 250 kJ/mol for the second. Finally, we discuss the influence of different aliphatic and aromatic substituents with varying electronic properties on chemical reactivity. Besides providing in&#8208;depth mechanistic insights, we believe that our findings pave the way for a greener route toward an important class of bioactive molecules.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>In the present work, several manganese(I) complexes of chelating heteroditopic ligands Mn1&#8208;3, featuring ImNHC (imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) connected to a 1,2,3&#8208;triazole&#8208;N or tzNHC (1,2,3&#8208;triazol&#8208;5&#8208;ylidene) donors via a methylene spacer, with possible modifications at the triazole backbone have been synthesized and completely characterized. Notably, the CO stretching frequencies, electrochemical analysis, and frontier orbital analysis certainly suggests that the chelating ImNHC&#8208;tzNHC ligands have stronger donation capabilities than the related ImNHC&#8208;Ntz ligand in the synthesized complexes. Moreover, these well&#8208;defined phosphine free Mn(I)&#8208;NHC complexes have been found to be effective non&#8208;bifunctional catalysts for the &#945;&#8208;alkylation of nitriles using alcohols and importantly, the catalyst Mn1 containing ImNHC connected to a weaker triazole&#8208;N donor displayed higher activity compared to Mn2/Mn3 containing an unsymmetrical bis&#8208;carbene donors (ImNHC and tzNHC). A wide range of aryl nitriles were coupled with diverse (hetero)aromatic as well as aliphatic alcohols to get the corresponding products in good to excellent yields (32 examples, up to 95% yield). The detailed mechanistic studies including deuterium labelling experiments reveal that the reaction follows a Borrowing Hydrogen pathway.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>One pair of isomers, IDT&#8208;BOF containing S&#183;&#183;&#183;O/F&#183;&#183;&#183;H noncovalently configurational locks and IDT&#8208;BFO containing F&#183;&#183;&#183;H/O&#183;&#183;&#183;H noncovalently configurational locks, were designed and synthesized with an acceptor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor (A&#8208;&#960;&#8208;D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A) structure by choosing 4,9&#8208;dihydro&#8208;s&#8208;indaceno[1,2&#8208;b:5,6&#8208;b']dithiophene (IDT) as the D unit, F/n&#8208;hexyloxy substituted phenyl ring as &#960; bridge, and 3&#8208;(dicyanomethylidene)indan&#8208;1&#8208;one as the A unit. Owing to the S&#183;&#183;&#183;O/F&#183;&#183;&#183;H or F&#183;&#183;&#183;H/O&#183;&#183;&#183;H noncovalently configurational locks, both IDT&#8208;BOF and IDT&#8208;BFO show completely planar structure. In comparison to IDT&#8208;BFO, IDT&#8208;BOF exhibits similar LUMO but higher HOMO energy levels, leading to a smaller optical bandgap and red&#8208;shifted absorption. However, IDT&#8208;BOF&#8208;based bulk&#8208;heterojunction organic solar cells (BHJ&#8208;OSCs) coupled with PBDB&#8208;T, and PCE&#8208;10 as donor materials both exhibited a lower PCE than that of IDT&#8208;BFO (PBDB&#8208;T: 5.2% vs. 6.1%; PCE&#8208;10: 1.7% vs. 3.2%). Comprehensively comparing and investigating IDT&#8208;BOF:PBDB&#8208;T and IDT&#8208;BFO:PBDB&#8208;T OSCs suggested that the large phase separation and serious charge recombination of IDT&#8208;BOF based OSCs contributed to its lower PCE. Importantly, ternary solar cells based on PBDB&#8208;T:Y5 as control devices by adding 10% IDT&#8208;BFO exhibited a 5% enhancement in the PCE compared to the control device (14.3% vs. 13.6%).</dc:description>
