         <title>Synthesis, Structure, and Redox and Optical Properties of 5,10,15,20&#8208;Tetraaryl&#8208;5&#8208;azaporphyrinium Salts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The fundamental properties of azaporphyrins can be modulated over a wide range by changing the number of meso&#8208;nitrogen atoms. We report herein the first examples of 5,10,15,20&#8208;tetraaryl&#8208;5&#8208;azaporphyrinium (MTAMAP) salts, which were prepared via metal&#8208;templated cyclization of the corresponding zinc(II) and copper(II) complexes of 10&#8208;aryl&#8208;1&#8208;chloro&#8208;19&#8208;benzoyl&#8208;5,15&#8208;dimesityl&#8208;10&#8208;azabiladiene&#8208;ac. The inclusion of one meso&#8208;nitrogen atom in the 5,10,15,20&#8208;tetraarylporphyrin skeleton considerably changes the redox and optical properties as well as the degree of aromaticity of the porphyrin ring. The present findings suggest that MTAMAP salts would be promising scaffolds for the development of new azaporphyrin&#8208;based ionic fluorophores and photosensitizers.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanochemical Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Carbon&#8208;Sulfur Bond Formation between Aryl Iodides and Aromatic Sulfur Surrogates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The formation of aromatic thioethers from C&#8208;S coupling is of great importance in synthetic chemistry. Traditional solution strategies through transition&#8208;metal catalysis generally require bulk solution, heat, and longer reaction time. Herein, a mechano&#8208;promoted sulfenylation of aryl iodides with nickel catalysis is described. The active aromatic sulfide agents are in&#8208;situ generated from aromatic thiol or disulfide and subsequently adapted in the nickel catalytic cycle, with a tolerance of broad substituted groups under optimized conditions. In addition to the gram&#8208;scale synthesis that reveals the application potential of the method, the radical trap&#8208;ping and competitive experiments are also conducted for the mechanistic study, thus proposing the plausible mechanism rationally. Furthermore, the proposed methodology is certificated as being versatile and following the green principles with ideal calculated values of green chemistry matrix and the comparison with other approaches for C&#8208;S bond formation.</dc:description>

         <title>Double&#8208;Walled Covalent Organic Frameworks with High Stability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Double&#8208;walled covalent organic frameworks, consisting of two same building blocks parallel to each other forming ladder&#8208;shape linkers, could enhance the stability of the frameworks and increase the density of functional sites, thus making them suitable for various applications. In this study, two double&#8208;walled covalent organic frameworks, namely DW&#8208;COF&#8208;1 and DW&#8208;COF&#8208;2, were successfully synthesized via imine condensation. The resulting DW&#8208;COFs exhibited a honeycomb topology, high crystallinity and stability. Particularly, DW&#8208;COF&#8208;2 showed excellent resistance toward boiling water, strong acid, and strong base, due to its double&#8208;wall structure, which limits the exposure of labile imine bonds to external chemical environments. The DW&#8208;COFs showed high porosity near 900 m2/g, making them suitable for gas storage/separation. The selective gas adsorption experiments showed that at 273 K and 1 atm pressure, DW&#8208;COF&#8208;1 and DW&#8208;COF&#8208;2 exhibited a good IAST selectivity towards CO2/N2 (15/85) adsorption, with selectivity values of 121.3 and 56.4 for CO2 over N2, respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and VCD Spectroscopic Characterization of a Series of Azacryptands from a Chiral Valine&#8208;based Derivative of Tris(2&#8208;aminoethyl)amine (TREN)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Utilizing experimental and computational vibrational circular dichroism (VCD) spectroscopy, we explored the conformational preferences of a series of chiral C3&#8208;symmetric octaazacryptands with tris(2&#8208;aminoethyl)&#8208;amine head groups derived from valine. While the spectra of the smallest azacryptand with p&#8208;phenyl linkers and its elongated derivative with p&#8208;biphenyls linker were found to match well with the computed spectra, the computed conformational preferences of the m&#8208;biphenyl&#8208;based azacryptand did not seem to reflect the conformations dominating in chloroform solution. A detailed analysis revealed that structural changes resulting in a collapsed cage structure gave a notably better match with the experiment. It could subsequently be concluded from the VCD analysis, that the octaazacryptands prefer a collapsed structure, which is not predicted by density functional theory (DFT) calculations as the global minimum structures. These findings are expected to have consequences also for future studies on inclusion complexes of such azacryptands.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrosynthesis of metal&#8208;organic framework films with well&#8208;defined facets</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The deposition of metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) films with defined exposed facets is important to enhance the performance of these films for e.g. catalysis or separations. In this work, MOF films with specific exposed facets are electrodeposited anodically on various substrates (e.g. on copper&#8208;sputtered Si wafers, copper meshes, copper foams, and polypropylene membranes). The influence of the deposition parameters, including the pH of the solution, current density, concentration of linker, and solvent, on the exposed facets of the deposited MOFs was investigated. The results suggest that precise control over the supersaturation during anodic deposition is a possible strategy for synthesizing MOF crystals with well&#8208;defined exposed facets. This approach provides a powerful toolbox for various applications requiring crystal facet control of MOF films.</dc:description>

         <title>Application of Machine Learning Algorithms to Metadynamics for the Elucidation of the Binding Modes and Free Energy Landscape of Drug/Target Interactions: a Case Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the context of drug discovery, computational methods were able to accelerate the challenging process of designing and optimizing a new drug candidate. Amongst the possible atomistic simulation approaches, metadynamics (metaD) has proven very powerful. However, the choice of collective variables (CVs) is not trivial for complex systems. To automate the process of CVs identification, we apply here two different machine learning (ML) algorithms, namely DeepLDA and Autoencoder, to the metaD simulation of a well&#8208;researched drug/target complex, constituted by a pharmacologically relevant non&#8208;canonical DNA secondary structure (G&#8208;quadruplex) and a metallodrug acting as its stabilizer, as well as solvent molecules.</dc:description>

Abstract
The first neutral and cationic Mo imido alkylidene cyclic alkyl amino carbene (CAAC) complexes of the general formulae [Mo(N&#8722;Ar)(CHCMe2Ph)(X)2(CAAC)] and [Mo(N&#8722;Ar)(CHCMe2Ph)(X)(CAAC)][B(ArF)4] (X=Br, Cl, OTf, OC6F5; CAAC=1&#8208;(2,6&#8208;iPr2&#8208;C6H3)&#8208;3,3,5,5&#8208;tetramethyltetrahydropyrrol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) have been synthesized from molybdenum imido bishalide alkylidene DME precursors. Different combinations of the imido and &#8220;X&#8221; ligands have been employed to understand synthetic peculiarities. Selected complexes have been characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis. Due to the pronounced &#963;&#8208;donor/&#960;&#8208;acceptor characteristics of CAACs, the corresponding neutral and cationic molybdenum imido alkylidene CAAC complexes do not require the presence of stabilizing donor ligands such as nitriles. Calculations on the PBE0&#8208;D3BJ/def2&#8208;TZVP level for PBE0&#8208;D3BJ/def2&#8208;SVP optimized geometries revealed partial charges at molybdenum similar to the corresponding molybdenum imido alkylidene N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) complexes with a slightly higher polarization of the molybdenum alkylidene bond in the CAAC complexes. All cationic complexes have been tested in olefin metathesis reactions and showed improved activity compared to the analogous NHC complexes for hydrocarbon&#8208;based substrates, allowing for turnover numbers (TONs) up to 9500 even at room temperature. Some Mo imido alkylidene CAAC complexes are tolerant towards functional groups like thioethers and sulfonamides.

         <title>NAD(P)H:Quinone Acceptor Oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) Activatable Salicylamide H+/Cl&#8722; Transporters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we report two enzyme activatable ion transport systems that, on selective activation by NQO1&#8208; an enzyme abundant in cancer cells, are capable of transporting H+/Cl&#8722; across the lipid bilayer. This transport disrupts the ion homeostasis specifically in the cancer cells and triggers apoptosis via mitochondrial membrane depolarization, lysosomal deacidification, and oxidative stress induction.







Abstract
NAD(P)H:quinone acceptor oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), a detoxifying enzyme overexpressed in tumors, plays a key role in protecting cancer cells against oxidative stress and thus has been considered an attractive candidate for activating prodrug(s). Herein, we report the first use of NQO1 for the selective activation of &#8216;protransporter&#8217; systems in cancer cells leading to the induction of apoptosis. Salicylamides, easily synthesizable small molecules, have been effectively used for efficient H+/Cl&#8722; symport across lipid membranes. The ion transport activity of salicylamides was efficiently abated by caging the OH group with NQO1 activatable quinones via either ether or ester linkage. The release of active transporters, following the reduction of quinone caged &#8216;protransporters&#8217; by NQO1, was verified. Both the transporters and protransporters exhibited significant toxicity towards the MCF&#8208;7 breast cancer line, mediated via the induction of oxidative stress, mitochondrial membrane depolarization, and lysosomal deacidification. Induction of cell death via intrinsic apoptotic pathway was verified by monitoring PARP1 cleavage.

         <title>Naphthalimide&#8208;Dyes Bearing Phosphine and Phosphorylamide Moieties: Synthesis and Optical Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New 1,8&#8208;naphthalimides bearing phosphine and amine chelating moieties has been prepared and their optical properties both as single molecules and when complexed on Pd(II) ions have been investigated. The complexation with Pd(II) quenches the fluorescence emission of the dye but activates an unexpected reactivity leading to a novel strongly emissive 1,8&#8208;naphthalimide dye bearing a cyclic phosphorylamide moiety.







Abstract
1,8&#8208;Naphthalimides (NIs) represent a class of organic dyes with interesting optical properties that has been extensively explored in the last decades in lighting devices, chemosensors, optical probes or medicinal chemistry. However, despite their remarkable potential, reports on organometallic dyes bearing NIs are scarce and virtually inexistent regarding palladium(II) complexes. Herein, we report the synthesis of NIs bearing phosphine and amine chelating moieties and the characterization of their optical properties both as single molecules and when complexed on Pd(II) ions. It is shown that the introduction of phosphine moieties in the naphthalimide core results in a marked increase in non&#8208;radiative processes, leading to a significant reduction of the emission efficiency and lifetime of these dyes, compared to amine&#8208;bearing counterparts. The complexation to Pd(II) sequesters the electronic contribution of chelating moieties, with complexes assuming an optical behavior similar to that of unsubstituted 1,8&#8208;naphthalimide. The complexation significantly increases the acidity of chelating secondary amines, giving rise to an unexpected intramolecular reaction that results in the formation of a novel 1,8&#8208;naphthalimide dye bearing a cyclic phosphorylamide moiety. The new dye exhibits good emission quantum yield, long fluorescence lifetime and sensitivity to basic media, evidencing potential for application in optical imaging and sensing scenarios.

         <title>Caged Luciferase Inhibitor&#8208;Based Bioluminescence Switching Strategy Enables Efficient Detection of Serum APN Activity and the Identification of Its Roles in Metastasis of Non&#8208;Small Cell Lung Cancer
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A caged luciferase inhibitor&#8208;based bioluminescence&#8208;switching strategy (CLIBS) is developed and used to determine circulating Aminopeptidase N (APN) activity in the complicated bio&#8208;samples with robust efficacy. By applying the CLIBS to serum samples in non&#8211;small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, it is revealed that circulating APN activity serves as an independent factor for forecasting NSCLC patients&#8217; risk of metastasis.







Abstract
Bioluminogenic probes emerged as powerful tools for imaging and analysis of various bioanalyses, but traditional approaches would be limited to the low sensitivity during determine the low activity of protease in clinical specimens. Herein, we proposed a caged luciferase inhibitor&#8208;based bioluminescence&#8208;switching strategy (CLIBS) by using a cleavable luciferase inhibitor to modulate the activity of luciferase reporter to amplify the detective signals, which led to the enhancement of detection sensitivity, and enabled the determination of circulating Aminopeptidase N (APN) activity in thousands of times diluted serum. By applying the CLIBS to serum samples in non&#8211;small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients from two clinical cohorts, we revealed that, for the first time, higher circulating APN activities but not its concentration, were associated with more NSCLC metastasis or higher metastasis stages by subsequent clinical analysis, and can serve as an independent factor for forecasting NSCLC patients&#8217; risk of metastasis.

The investigated indolin&#8208;3&#8208;one derivative exhibits fast photoisomerization in apolar solvents. In melanoma cells, the compound showed lipid droplet accumulation along with photoactivated toxicity.







Abstract
The study of a fluorescent indolin&#8208;3&#8208;one derivative is reported that, as opposed to its previously described congeners, selectively undergoes photoactivated ring&#8208;opening in apolar solvents. The excited state involved in this photoisomerization was partially deactivated by the formation of singlet oxygen. Cell studies revealed lipid droplet accumulation and efficient light&#8208;induced cytotoxicity.

2&#8208;(Pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)imidazo[1,5&#8208;b]pyridazine&#8208;7&#8208;ylidene was introduced as a dimetal&#8208;binding rigid scaffold. The scaffold was first converted into an Au,N,N&#8208;tridentate ligand through binding of Au(I)Cl at the carbene site. By using the Au,N,N&#8208;tridentate ligand, various trinuclear heterobimetallic complexes with intermetallic interactions were readily preparable with 3d&#8208;transition metals (CuI, CuII, NiII, and CoII). The structures of these complexes were unambiguously determined by SC&#8208;XRD analysis.







Abstract
As a dimetal&#8208;binding rigid scaffold, 2&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)imidazo[1,5&#8208;b]pyridazine&#8208;7&#8208;ylidene was introduced. The scaffold was first converted into a meridional Au,N,N&#8208;tridentate ligand through binding of a Au(I)Cl moiety at the carbene center. The Au(I) center and the N,N&#8208;chelating moiety were expected to function as metallophilic and 4e&#8208;&#963;&#8208;donative interaction sites, respectively, in the binding of the second metal center. In this manner, various trinuclear heterobimetallic complexes were synthesized with different 3d&#8208;metal sources, such as cationic CuI, CuII, NiII, and CoII salts. SC&#8208;XRD analysis showed that the mono&#8208;3d&#8208;metal di&#8208;gold(I) trinuclear heterobimetallic complexes were constructed through gold(I)&#8208;metal interactions. Metallophilic interactions were also investigated by quantum chemical calculations including the AIM and IGMH methods.

         <title>Iso&#8208;Pentadienyl Carbonate as a Five Carbon Synthon in Manganese(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Selective Linear 1,3&#8208;Dienylation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A manganese(I)&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H dienylation of arenes using iso&#8208;pentadienyl carbonate as five carbon synthons is reported. This is a highly unprecedented report for selective linear 1,3&#8208;dienylation by using C&#8722;H activation catalysis. Our method facilitates the synthesis of varieties of dienes, including those suitable for normal or inverse electron demand Diels&#8208;Alder reactions, dienyl glycoconjugates, and unnatural amino acids. Moreover, the synthetic applicability of this method eased to deliver a 6/6/5&#8208;fused tricyclic nagilactone scaffold.







Abstract
Selective linear 1,3&#8208;dienylations are essential transformations, and numerous synthetic efforts have been documented. However, a general method enabling access to electron&#8208;rich, &#8208;poor, and biologically relevant dienyl molecules is in high demand. Hence, we report a straightforward method of manganese(I)&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H dienylation of arenes by using iso&#8208;pentadienyl carbonate as a five carbon synthon. This is a highly unprecedented report for selective linear 1,3&#8208;dienylation using manganese C&#8722;H activation catalysis. Our method facilitates the synthesis of varieties of dienes, including those suitable for normal or inverse electron demand Diels&#8208;Alder reactions, dienyl glycoconjugates, and unnatural amino acids. Extensive mechanistic studies, including isolation of C&#8722;H activated organo&#8208;manganese complex and isotopic analyses, have supported the proposed mechanism of this dienylation. The synthetic applicability of this method eased to deliver a 6/6/5&#8208;fused tricyclic nagilactone scaffold.

         <title>Thermally&#8208;Activated Geometrical Regioselective E &#8594; Z Isomerization&#8208;Enabled Cascade Sequences of Conjugated Dienals: Experimental and DFT Studies</title>

         <dc:description>The geometrical regioselective E &#8594; Z isomerization of a conjugated alkene under thermal activation poses a challenge due to microscopic reversibility. Herein we report that such reversibility issues can be circumvented by integrating E &#8594; Z isomerization with subsequent cyclization cascade.&#160;Thus, linearly conjugated dienals in a mixture of toluene&#8210;alcohol (2:1) solvents or only with alcohol at 60&#8208;70 &#176;C can be converted to &#947;&#8208;alkoxybutenolides in moderate to good yields. The intermediary 2Z,4E&#8210;isomer can be isolated, which includes the first example of isolating the regioselective isomerization product under thermal conditions.&#160; Density functional theory (DFT) studies have been employed to shed light on the feasibility of geometrical alkene isomerization and ensuing cascade sequences. It has been observed that the regioselective 2E,4E &#8594; 2Z,4E isomerization of dienal is a thermodynamically facile (&#916;G &lt; 0) process. The thermodynamic plausibility of the subsequent cascade reaction from the Z&#8208;isomer to the anticipated product in the presence of a polar protic solvent (here MeOH) is also explicated. Out of the two probable pathways, the "hemiacetal pathway" involving a relay proton transfer is kinetically more feasible due to the diminished activation barrier than the conjugate addition pathway.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly enantioselective synthesis of pharmaceuticals at chiral&#8208;encoded metal surfaces</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enantioselective catalysis is of crucial importance in modern chemistry and pharmaceutical science. To obtain high purity chiral compounds, although various concepts have been used for the development of enantioselective catalysts, most of them are based on homogeneous catalytic systems. Recently, we have successfully developed nanostructured metal layers imprinted with chiral information, which have been applied as electrocatalysts for the enantioselective synthesis of chiral model compounds. However, so far such materials have not been employed as heterogeneous catalysts for the enantioselective synthesis of real pharmaceutical products. In this contribution, we report the asymmetric synthesis of chiral pharmaceuticals (CPs) with chiral imprinted Pt&#8208;Ir surfaces as a simple hydrogenation catalyst. By fine&#8208;tuning the experimental parameters, a very high enantioselectivity (up to 95% enantiomeric excess, ee) with good catalyst stability can be achieved. The designed materials have also been successfully used as catalytically active stationary phases for the continuous asymmetric flow synthesis of pharmaceutical compounds. This illustrates the possibility of producing for the first time real chiral pharmaceuticals at such nanostructured metal surfaces.</dc:description>

         <title>Redox Activity of IrIII Complexes with Multidentate Ligands Based on Dipyrido&#8208;annulated N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes: Access to High Valent and High Spin State with Carbon Donors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synthetic strategies to access high&#8208;valent iridium complexes usually require&#160;use of &#960; donating ligands bearing electronegative atoms (e.g. amide or oxide) or &#963; donating electropositive atoms (e.g. boryl or hydride). Besides the &#951;5&#8208;(methyl)cyclopentadienyl derivatives, high&#8208;valent &#951;1 carbon&#8208;ligated iridium complexes are challenging to synthesize. To meet this challenge, this work reports the oxidation behavior of an all&#8208;carbon&#8208;ligated anionic bis(CCC&#8208;pincer) IrIII complex. Being both &#963; and &#960; donating, the diaryl dipyrido&#8208;annulated N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (dpa&#8208;NHC) IrIII complex allowed a stepwise 4e&#8211; oxidation sequence. The first 2e&#8211; oxidation led to an oxidative coupling of two adjacent aryl groups, resulting in formation of a cationic chiral IrIII complex bearing a CCCC&#8208;tetradentate ligand. A further 2e&#8211; oxidation allowed isolation of a high&#8208;valent tricationic complex with a triplet ground state. These results close a synthetic gap for carbon&#8208;ligated iridium complexes and demonstrate the electronic tuning potential&#160;of organic &#960; ligands for unusual electronic properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Spin Orbit Charge Transfer Intersystem Crossing and Slow Intramolecular Triplet&#8208;Triplet Energy Transfer in Bodipy&#8208;Perylenebisimide Compact Dyads and Triads</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We prepared Bodipy (BDP)&#8208;perylenebisimide (PBI) donor&#8208;acceptor dyads/triad to study the spin orbit charge transfer intersystem crossing (SOCT&#8208;ISC). For BDP&#8208;PBI&#8208;3, in which BDP was attached at the imide position of PBI, higher singlet oxygen quantum yield (FD = 85%) was observed than the bay&#8208;substituted derivative BDP&#8208;PBI&#8208;1 (FD = 30%). Femtosecond transient absorption spectra indicate slow F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET; 40.4 ps) and charge separation (CS; 1.55 ns) in BDP&#8208;PBI&#8208;3, while for BDP&#8208;PBI&#8208;1, CS takes 2.8 ps. For triad BDP&#8208;PBI&#8208;2, ultrafast FRET (149 fs) and CS (4.7 ps) process were observed, the subsequent charge recombination (CR) takes 5.8 ns and long lived 3PBI* (179.8 &#181;s) state is populated. Nanosecond transient absorption spectra of BDP&#8208;PBI&#8208;3 show that the CR gives upper triplet excited state (3BDP*) and subsequently, via a slow intramolecular triplet energy transfer (14.5 &#181;s), the 3PBI* state is finally populated, indicating that upper triplet state is involved in SOCT&#8208;ISC. Time resolved electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy revealed that both radical pair ISC (RP ISC) and SOCT&#8208;ISC contribute to the ISC. A rare electron spin polarization of (e, e, e, e, e, e) was observed for the triplet state formed via the RP ISC mechanism, due to the S&#8208;T+1/T0 states mixing.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Since the discovery of urea inclusion compounds (UICs) in 1940, the handedness of this chiral helical system has not been established experimentally. By studying three UIC systems containing light&#8208;atoms only, the optical rotations were first measured, and the absolute structures of the enantiomorphic domains of three UICs were determined via single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD). The correlation between the optical rotation and the absolute configuration of the UICs was finally established, showcasing the power of absolute structure determination via SCXRD, which is essential in structural chemistry and pharmaceutical research.</dc:description>

         <title>Aminoacid&#8208;Assisted Synthesis of Hollow Hierarchical FER Zeolite with Improved Catalytic Performance</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hierarchical zeolites are highly&#8208;desired catalysts in the petrochemical industry due to their shorter diffusion length, faster diffusion rate, and better accessibility to active acid sites compared with conventional zeolites. Herein, we report a simple aminoacid&#8208;assisted method to synthesize urchin&#8208;like hollow hierarchical FER zeolite with abundant mesopores and macroporous inner cavities. An aminoacid (i.e. L&#8208;lysine) is used to facilitate the agglomeration of primary nanoparticles, and the agglomerates with staged crystallization in the internal and surface. The preferential nucleation and crystal growth at the external surfaces together with the lagged crystallization of the inner core of the agglomerates results in the formation of hollow inner cavities after the exhaustion of interior materials. Thanks to the unique hierarchical structure and more accessible acid sites, the hollow hierarchical FER zeolite exhibits improved catalytic performance over the conventional one in the skeletal isomerization of 1&#8208;butene to isobutene.</dc:description>

         <title>Stabilizing Nitroxide Spin Labels for Structural and Conformational Studies of Biomolecules by Maleimide Treatment</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stabilizing NO radical: The instability of NO radicals in cell lysates and cells limits its application in characterizing biomolecular activity by EPR. Maleimide is shown as an effective reagent of stabilizing the NO radicals in cell lysates by preserving the intracellular confinement, enables high fidelity of EPR measurement of NO spin labelled biomolecules in maleimide treated cell lysates.







Abstract
Nitroxide (NO) spin radicals are effective in characterizing structures, interactions and dynamics of biomolecules. The EPR applications in cell lysates or intracellular milieu require stable spin labels, but NO radicals are unstable in such conditions. We showed that the destabilization of NO radicals in cell lysates or even in cells is caused by NADPH/NADH related enzymes, but not by the commonly believed reducing reagents such as GSH. Maleimide stabilizes the NO radicals in the cell lysates by consumption of the NADPH/NADH that are essential for the enzymes involved in destabilizing NO radicals, instead of serving as the solo thiol scavenger. The maleimide treatment retains the crowding properties of the intracellular components and allows to perform long&#8208;time EPR measurements of NO labeled biomolecules close to the intracellular conditions. The strategy of maleimide treatment on cell lysates for the EPR applications has been demonstrated on double electron&#8208;electron resonance (DEER) measurements on a number of NO labeled protein samples. The method opens a broad application range for the NO labeled biomolecules by EPR in conditions that resemble the intracellular milieu.

         <title>Recent Advances in Aerobic Oxidative of C&#8722;H Bond by Molecular Oxygen Focus on Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A concise summary of recent advances on green oxidative coupling reactions of C&#8722;H bond focus on heterocyclic compounds for construction of C&#8722;C and C&#8722;X (X=N, O, S, or P) bonds using O2 as internal oxidant since 2010 was given. The transformations described here aim to provide a platform for expanding the scope and utility of O2 as green oxidation, together with a brief discussion on research into the mechanisms behind it, hoping to reveal some common reaction patterns and development trends, as well as potential applications and challenges in the near future.







Abstract
Aerobic oxidative cross&#8208;coupling represents one of the most straightforward and atom&#8208;economic methods for construction of C&#8722;C and C&#8722;X (X=N, O, S, or P) bonds using air as a sustainable external oxidant. The oxidative coupling of C&#8722;H bonds in heterocyclic compounds can effectively increase their molecular complexity by introducing new functional groups through C&#8722;H bond activation, or by formation of new heterocyclic structures through cascade construction of two or more sequential chemical bonds. This is very useful as it can increase the potential applications of these structures in natural products, pharmaceuticals, agricultural chemicals, and functional materials. This is a representative overview of recent progress since 2010 on green oxidative coupling reactions of C&#8722;H bond using O2 or air as internal oxidant focus on Heterocycles. It aims to provide a platform for expanding the scope and utility of air as green oxidant, together with a brief discussion on research into the mechanisms behind it.

         <title>Coordination Behavior of the Tellurium Incorporated Mercuraazametallamacrocycle and Investigation of d10&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;d10 Interactions between Closed Shell (Ag+ Hg2+) Metal Ions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Six Metal Interactions: This is the first isolated tellurium and mercury containing metallaazamacrocycle which exhibits unsymmetrical figure&#8208;of&#8208;eight conformation. It hosts two silver ions in the skeleton and displays intramolecular Hg&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Ag, Ag&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Te, Hg&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Te as well as intermolecular Hg&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Hg interactions. The intermolecular Hg&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Hg mercurophilic interactions connect six atoms as Te&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Ag&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Hg&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Hg&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Ag&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Te in non&#8208;linear fashion.







Abstract
Herein, a new tellurium and mercury containing mercuraazametallamacrocycle has been prepared via (2+2) condensation of bis(o&#8208;aminophenyl)telluride and bis(o&#8208;formylphenyl)mercury(II). The isolated bright yellow solid of mercuraazametallamacrocycle has adopted unsymmetrical figure&#8208;of&#8208;eight conformation in the crystal structure. To study the metallophilic interactions between closed shell metal ions, the macrocyclic ligand has been treated with two equiv. of AgOTf (OTf=trifluoromethansulfonate) and AgBF4, which afforded greenish&#8208;yellow bimetallic silver complexes. The isolated silver complexes displayed intramolecular Hg&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Ag, Te&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Ag interactions as well as intermolecular Hg&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Hg interactions and formed an extended 1D molecular chain by directing six atoms to interact as TeII&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;AgI&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;HgII&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;HgII&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;AgI&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;TeII in a non linear fashion. The Hg&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Ag, Te&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Ag interactions have also been studied in solution by 199Hg, 125Te&#8197;NMR spectroscopy, absorption, and emission spectroscopy. In DFT calculations, the Atom in Molecule (AIM) analysis, non&#8208;covalent interactions (NCI), natural bonding orbital (NBO) analysis strongly supported for experimental evidences and revealed that the intermolecular Hg&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Hg interaction is stronger than the intramolecular Hg&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Ag interactions.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herein, a new tellurium and mercury containing mercuraazametallamacrocycle has been prepared via (2+2) condensation of bis(&lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-aminophenyl)telluride and bis(&lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-formylphenyl)mercury(II). The isolated bright yellow solid of mercuraazametallamacrocycle has adopted unsymmetrical figure-of-eight conformation in the crystal structure. To study the metallophilic interactions between closed shell metal ions, the macrocyclic ligand has been treated with two equiv. of AgOTf (OTf=trifluoromethansulfonate) and AgBF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, which afforded greenish-yellow bimetallic silver complexes.

         <title>Borylated Subphthalocyanines: Versatile Precursors for the Preparation of Functional Bowl&#8208;Shaped Aromatics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis, electronic properties, and reactivity of borylated subphthalocyanines (SubPcs) are reported. These compounds display a great stability and serve as powerful starting materials for the post&#8208;functionalization of SubPcs via cross&#8208;coupling reactions.







Abstract
The peripheral borylation of porphyrinoids has become a key step to prepare advanced functional materials. This study reports the synthesis, electronic properties, and reactivity of borylated subphthalocyanines. These compounds, which are prepared by Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura borylation in excellent yields, are easily purified, display a great stability, and serve as powerful starting materials for the post&#8208;functionalization of SubPcs via cross&#8208;coupling reactions. Remarkably, this novel approach is more efficient than the methodologies already described and enables the preparation of exotic systems, such as SubPc dimeric species linked by C&#8722;C bonds, which are not accessible so far and present promising properties for optoelectronic devices.

Allyation: The selective C7&#8208;allylation of indolines with allyl bromide under ruthenium catalysis has been reported. Experimental and DFT study has been carried out to probe the mechanism of the reaction.







Abstract
The selective C7&#8208;allylation of indolines with allyl bromide under ruthenium catalysis has been revealed here. Under established reaction conditions, C7&#8208;allylation of various indolines, including drug compounds, was accomplished with good selectivity and yields. Based on combined experimental and density functional theory (DFT) studies, the olefin insertion route was energetically favorable among four possible pathways. Experimental and DFT studies further revealed that the C&#8722;H activation is a reversible rate&#8208;limiting step.

         <title>Unexcited Light Source Imaging for Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unexcited light imaging has gained much attention in recent years because of its high sensitivity and high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio. This article provides an overview of the application of chemiluminescence, bioluminescence and afterglow luminescence in biomedical imaging. The imaging mechanisms and luminescence enhancement strategies are also briefly described.







Abstract
Optical imaging has a wide range of applications in the biomedical field, allowing the visualization of physiological processes and helping in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases. Unexcited light source imaging technologies, such as chemiluminescence imaging, bioluminescence imaging and afterglow imaging have attracted great attention in recent years because of the absence of excitation light interference in their application and the advantages of high sensitivity and high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio. In this review, the latest advances in unexcited light source imaging technology for biomedical applications are highlighted. The design strategies of unexcited light source luminescent probes in improving luminescence brightness, penetration depth, quantum yield and targeting, and their applications in inflammation imaging, tumor imaging, liver and kidney injury imaging and bacterial infection imaging are introduced in detail. The research progress and future prospects of unexcited light source imaging for medical applications are further discussed.

         <title>Synthesis of 4&#8208;Deoxy&#8208;4&#8208;fluoro&#8208;D&#8208;sedoheptulose: A Promising New Sugar to Apply the Principle of Metabolic Trapping</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorinated carbohydrates are important tools for understanding the deregulation of metabolic fluxes and pathways. Fluorinating specific positions within the sugar scaffold can lead to enhanced metabolic stability and subsequent metabolic trapping in cells. This principle has, however, never been applied to study the metabolism of the rare sugars of the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). Thus, we designed and synthesized two fluorinated derivatives of D&#8208;sedoheptulose: 4&#8208;deoxy&#8208;4&#8208;fluoro&#8208;D&#8208;sedoheptulose (4DFS) and 3deoxy&#8208;3&#8208;fluoro&#8208;D&#8208;sedoheptulose (3DFS). We show that both sugars are taken up by human fibroblasts but that only 4DFS is phosphorylated. We could further show that fluorination of Dsedoheptulose at C&#8208;4 effectively halts the enzymatic degradation by transaldolase and transketolase. 4DFS thus has a high potential as a new PPP imaging probe based on the principle of metabolic trapping. Therefore, we further present the synthesis of potential radiolabeling precursors for 4DFS for future radiofluorinations with fluorine&#8208;18.</dc:description>

&#8220;The interplay between the exceptional &#960;&#8208;acceptor and &#963;&#8208;donor properties of the pyridyl&#8208;mesoionic carbene is fascinating for the design of new potential photo&#8208; and electrocatalysts.&#8221; This and more about the story behind the front cover can be found in the article at 10.1002/chem.202301205).







Abstract
Invited for the cover of this issue are Biprajit Sarkar and co&#8208;workers at the University of Stuttgart and University of Freiburg. In the image, the solar flare represents the non&#8208;innocence (fluorine&#8208;specific interactions) of the counterion, and the black hole at the metal center illustrates the oxidation/electron deficiency of the Cr&#8208;center, while the electron &#8220;gets lost&#8221; in the space (oxidation agent).

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The involvement of nitroalkenes instead of minimal one alkyne motif for (E)&#8208;1,3&#8208;enynes synthesis through a palladium catalyzed stereo&#8208;selective bond forming pathway at room temperature is presented. Implication of nitro group as a sacrificial directing group, formation of magical alkyne on a newly developed Csp3&#8208;Csp3 bond with initial palladium&#8208;MBH adduct make this methodology distinctive. This protocol features an unprecedented sequential acetate addition, carbon&#8208;carbon bond formation, isomerization of double bond and nitromethane degradation in a tandem catalytic walk via dancing hybridization. Mechanistic understanding through identification of intermediates and computational calculations furnishes complete insight into the tandem catalytic pathway. Broad substrates scope and functional groups tolerance make this synthetic methodology magnificent and dynamic. This represents the first example of stereo&#8208;selective 1,3&#8208;enyne synthesis exclusively from alkene substrates by introducing the concept of sacrificial directing group.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The synthesis of the first terminal mono&#8208;boryl complexes of nickel, which are not stabilized by a pincer ligand, is reported. The reaction of the nickel bis&#8208;boryl complex cis&#8208;[Ni(iPr2ImMe)2(Bcat)2] 1 (cat = 1,2&#8208;O2C6H4) with the small donor ligand PMe3 led to a complete ligand exchange at nickel with reductive elimination of B2cat2, formation of the bisNHC adduct [B2cat2 &#183; (iPr2ImMe)2] 3 and formation of [Ni(PMe3)4] 2 as the metal&#8208;containing species.

         <title>Chiral Dual Core Chromophores Based on Binaphthyl Acrylonitrile Motif with Tunable Dual Emission Bands and Anti&#8208;counterfeiting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Small organic molecules which can emit fluorescence with tunable dual emission bands are significant for fundamental research and broad applications. In this work, two binaphthyl based arylacrylonitrile derivatives with pyrene and triphenylamine unit (BiNp&#8208;Py and BiNp&#8208;TPA) were designed and synthesized, respectively, featuring chiral backbone and dual AIE&#8208;active cyanostyrene&#8208;linked chromophores. Excellent fluorescence emissions in a range of solution and solid states were observed with high quantum yields, indicative of the solvatochromism and mechanochromism. More interestingly, dual emission bands were found and tunable by the water fraction in THF, and speculatively attributed to the balancing of intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) and locally excited (LE) emission in solution and aggregate states. Furthermore, the potential application in anti&#8208;counterfeiting ink was also explored, indicating the very low concentration (5 ppm) for sufficient distinguishable vision and small colour migration (28 nm) for printing on the filter. The present work provides a new strategy to design organic luminescent structure having widely fluorescent emissions in dual states and a valuable reference for the study of chiral optical materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Protein Sequencing with Artificial Intelligence: Machine Learning Integrated Phosphorene Nanoslit</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Achieving high throughput protein sequencing at single molecule resolution remains a daunting challenge. Herein, relying on a solid&#8208;state 2D phosphorene nanoslit device, we report an extraordinary biosensor to rapidly identify the key signatures of all twenty amino acids using interpretable machine learning (ML) model. The XGBoost regression algorithm allows the determination of transmission function of all twenty amino acids with high accuracy. The resultant ML and DFT studies reveal that it is possible to identify individual amino acids through transmission and current signals readouts with high sensitivity and selectivity. Moreover, we thoroughly compared our results to those from graphene nanoslit and found that the phosphorene nanoslit device can be an ideal candidate for protein sequencing up to a 13&#8208;fold increase in transmission sensitivity. The present study facilitates high throughput screening of all twenty amino acids and can be further extended to other biomolecules for disease diagnosis and therapeutic decision&#8208;making.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Conformational Analysis of Fullerene Torsion Balances for Assessing the Contribution of Dispersion and Anionic Character in Non&#8208;Covalent Arene&#8211;Fullerene Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 44, August 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By employing torsion balance molecules, we effectively measured the magnitude of the dispersion forces involved in the non&#8208;covalent interactions between substituted arene and fullerene. In addition, our findings indicate that solvation is of paramount importance in the anionic arene&#8211;fullerene interaction between thiophenolate and fullerene.







Abstract
We employ a molecular torsion balance displaying bifurcated conformational isomerism to quantitatively evaluate the non&#8208;covalent interactions between the fullerene surface and substituted arene moieties containing elements with high atomic numbers, as well as the thermodynamic processes involved in the folding equilibrium using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The interaction between fullerene and haloaryl groups was stronger in cases where the introduced halogen had a higher atomic number, indicating that dispersion forces play a significant role in the interaction between fullerenes and 4&#8208;haloaryl groups. The dispersion term also significantly contributed to the interaction between fullerene and the 4&#8208;mercaptophenyl group. Moreover, the addition of an appropriate base to the 4&#8208;mercaptophenyl&#8208;appended torsion balance formed the corresponding thiophenolate anion, resulting in a large negative change in the folding free energy in CDCl3.

     alt="Synthesis and Conformational Analysis of Fullerene Torsion Balances for Assessing the Contribution of Dispersion and Anionic Character in Non-Covalent Arene&#8211;Fullerene Interactions"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By employing torsion balance molecules, we effectively measured the magnitude of the dispersion forces involved in the non-covalent interactions between substituted arene and fullerene. In addition, our findings indicate that solvation is of paramount importance in the anionic arene&#8211;fullerene interaction between thiophenolate and fullerene.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We employ a molecular torsion balance displaying bifurcated conformational isomerism to quantitatively evaluate the non-covalent interactions between the fullerene surface and substituted arene moieties containing elements with high atomic numbers, as well as the thermodynamic processes involved in the folding equilibrium using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The interaction between fullerene and haloaryl groups was stronger in cases where the introduced halogen had a higher atomic number, indicating that dispersion forces play a significant role in the interaction between fullerenes and 4-haloaryl groups. The dispersion term also significantly contributed to the interaction between fullerene and the 4-mercaptophenyl group. Moreover, the addition of an appropriate base to the 4-mercaptophenyl-appended torsion balance formed the corresponding thiophenolate anion, resulting in a large negative change in the folding free energy in CDCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. Detailed analysis suggested that the observed attractive anionic arene&#8211;fullerene interactions predominantly originated from solvation effects.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Predictive Model for the Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Site&#8208;Selective Oxidation of Diols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 44, August 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Site&#8208;selectivity in the palladium&#8208;catalyzed mono&#8208;oxidation of diols can be predicted by a model, supported by experiments and computation. It explains the selective oxidation of hydroxy groups in cis&#8208;diols and the dependency of the rate on the configuration and conformational freedom. The model predicts whether a natural product comprising multiple hydroxy groups is suited for site&#8208;selective palladium&#8208;catalyzed oxidation.







Abstract
A predictive model, shaped as a set of rules, is presented that predicts site&#8208;selectivity in the mono&#8208;oxidation of diols by palladium&#8208;neocuproine catalysis. For this, the factors that govern this site&#8208;selectivity within diols and between different diols have been studied both experimentally and with computation. It is shown that an electronegative substituent antiperiplanar to the C&#8722;H bond retards hydride abstraction, resulting in a lower reactivity. This explains the selective oxidation of axial hydroxy groups in vicinal cis&#8208;diols. Furthermore, DFT calculations and competition experiments show how the reaction rate of different diols is determined by their configuration and conformational freedom. The model has been validated by the oxidation of several complex natural products, including two steroids. From a synthesis perspective, the model predicts whether a natural product comprising multiple hydroxy groups is a suitable substrate for site&#8208;selective palladium&#8208;catalyzed oxidation.

         <title>A Bimetallic Benzene&#8208;1,2,4,5&#8208;Tetrathiolate (btt) Molybdenocene Complex Cp2Mo(btt)MoCp2: Radical and Diradical States</title>

         <dc:description>
The redox active bimetallic dithiolene complex Cp2Mo(btt)MoCp2 (Mo2B) exhibits four successive electron transfers up to the tetracation. The isolated dication [Cp2Mo(btt)MoCp2]2+, with either chair or boat conformations associated with folded MoS2C2 metallacycles, exhibits a diradical character and strong antiferromagnetic coupling.







Abstract
Benzene&#8208;1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrathiolate (btt) has been used as a bridging ligand to prepare a redox active (molybdenocene dithiolene)&#8208;based bimetallic complex Cp2Mo(btt)MoCp2, which exhibits four successive electron transfers up to the tetracation. Spectro&#8208;electrochemical investigations together with DFT and TD&#8208;DFT calculations evidence that the two electroactive MoS2C2 metallacycles are electronically coupled in the monocationic as in the dicationic state. Two salts of the dication [Cp2Mo(btt)MoCp2]2+ have been structurally characterized with PF6&#8722; and HSO4&#8722; counterions, showing different chair or boat conformations associated with variable folding angles of the two MoS2C2 metallacycles along the S&#8722;S hinge. The bis&#8208;oxidized dicationic complex exhibits a diradical character, with both radicals essentially localized on the metallacycles and with antiferromagnetic coupling evidenced from magnetic susceptibility measurements.

         <title>Synthesis and Biological Evaluation of Simplified Ansellone Analogues with Lipophilic Side Chains as HIV Latency&#8208;Reversing Agents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 44, August 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structural simplification of ansellone A (1), which acts as an HIV latency&#8208;reversing agent (LRA), was investigated, and two analogues, 4&#8201;i and 4&#8201;j, showed HIV&#8208;latency&#8208;reversing activity comparable to compound 1.







Abstract
Structurally simplified analogues of ansellone A, in which the decalin skeleton is replaced with a lipophilic chain, were prepared and their HIV latency&#8208;reversing activities biologically evaluated. In particular, two analogues bearing ether and alkenyl side chains, respectively, showed comparable activities to that of ansellone A. Each of the simplified compounds was easily synthesized using Prins cyclisation chemistry.

         <title>Promoting Surface Reconstruction of Low&#8208;Cost Stainless Steel Catalyst for Efficient Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>

         <dc:description>
We present a simple and reasonable method to convert inexpensive 434&#8208;L SS (stainless steel) into cost&#8208;effective and stable electrodes by corrosion and sulfidation strategies. Systematic characterization shows that sulfidization treatment is beneficial to improve the oxygen evolution reaction activity of stainless steel&#8208;based catalysts, and provides an effective method to the design cheap and robust catalysts.







Abstract
The development of cost&#8208;effective transition metal catalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is critical for the production of hydrogen fuel from water splitting. Low&#8208;cost and efficient stainless steel&#8208;based catalysts are expected to replace the scarce platinum group metals for large&#8208;scale energy applications. Here in this work, we report the conversion of commonly available inexpensive and easily accessible 434&#8208;L stainless steel (SS) into highly active and stable electrodes by corrosion and sulfuration strategies. The NixFe1&#8722;xS layer as a pre&#8208;catalyst and S&#8208;doped NixFe oxyhydroxides in&#8197;situ formed on the catalyst surface are the true active species for OER. The optimized 434&#8208;L stainless steel&#8208;based electrocatalyst exhibits a low overpotential of 298&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in 1.0&#8197;M KOH with a small OER kinetics (the Tafel slope of 54.8&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1) and good stability. This work reveals the 434&#8208;L alloy stainless steel with Fe and Cr as the main elements can be used as qualified OER catalysts by surface modification, along with a new mentality to solve the energy and resource waste problems.

Herein, we report a ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed para&#8208;selective alkylation reaction with ethyl 2&#8208;bromo&#8208;2&#8208;cyanopropanoate as the novel alkylating reagent to directly form an &#945;&#8208;arylacetonitrile skeleton with quaternary carbon center. Various protected anilines were tolerated, yielding the corresponding products in moderate to good yields.







Abstract
A ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed para&#8208;selective alkylation of protected anilines to construct &#945;&#8208;arylacetonitrile skeletons has been reported. We firstly disclosed the ethyl 2&#8208;bromo&#8208;2&#8208;cyanopropanoate was an effective alkylating reagent in ruthenmuim&#8208;catalyzed remote&#8208;selective C&#8722;H functionalization. A wide variety of &#945;&#8208;arylacetonitrile skeletons can be directly obtained with moderate to good yields. Importantly, the products contain both nitrile and ester groups guaranteeing its direct transformation into other useful synthetic units, indicating the synthetic importance of this method.

         <title>First Example of 1,2,5&#8208;Oxadiazole&#8208;Based Hypergolic Ionic Liquids: A New Class of Potential Energetic Fuels</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 44, August 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Liquid energy: a novel type of promising thermally stable energetic fuels incorporating 1,2,5&#8208;oxadiazole ring and explosophoric anions is reported for the first time. Prepared materials have high nitrogen&#8208;oxygen content and high heats of explosion retaining low sensitivity to impact which enables their strong potential for various applications.







Abstract
The development of liquid energetic fuels with improved properties is an important topic in space propulsion technologies. In this manuscript, a series of energetic ionic liquids incorporating a 1,2,5&#8208;oxadiazole ring and nitrate, dicyanamide or dinitramide anion was synthesized and their physicochemical properties were evaluated. The synthesized compounds were fully characterized and were found to have good thermal stabilities (up to 219&#8201;&#176;C) and experimental densities (1.21&#8211;1.47&#8197;g&#8201;cm&#8722;3). Advantageously, 1,2,5&#8208;oxadiazole&#8208;based ionic liquids have high combined nitrogen&#8208;oxygen contents (up to 64.4&#8201;%), while their detonation velocities are on the level of known explosive TNT, and combustion performance exceeds those of benchmark 2&#8208;hydroxyethylhydrazinium nitrate. Considering the established hypergolicity with H2O2 in the presence of a catalyst, and insensitivity to impact, synthesized ionic liquids have strong application potential as energetic fuels for space technologies.

         <title>Effect of Polymeric Ligand Grafting Region on Confined Assembly of Gold Nanorods in cylindrical nanopores</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 44, August 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polystyrene end&#8208;tethered gold nanorod (AuNR@End&#8722;PS) exhibits a dumbbell&#8208;like shape, while the AuNR with PS tethered on entire surface (AuNR@Full&#8722;PS) shows a rod&#8208;like morphology. AuNR@End&#8722;PS is affected by the special steric hindrance at both ends, and prefers to form inclination arrangement, whereas AuNR@Full&#8722;PS prefer to be arranged shoulder&#8208;to&#8208;shoulder in a chain&#8208;like assembly in cylindrical nanopores.







Abstract
The grafting region of polymeric ligands exhibit a significant influence on the assembly behavior of polymer tethered gold nanorods (AuNRs) in confined space. In this work, the effect of core size, molecular weight and grafting region of ligands on the assembly structure in cylindrical nanopores was investigated. It is found that polystyrene end&#8208;tethered AuNR (AuNR@End&#8722;PS) exhibits a dumbbell&#8208;like shape, while the AuNR with PS tethered on the entire surface (AuNR@Full&#8722;PS) shows a rod&#8208;like morphology that gradually transforms into a spherical shape as the molecular weight increases. AuNR@End&#8722;PS is affected by the special steric hindrance at both ends, and prefers to form special structures such as inclination arrangement, whereas AuNR@Full&#8722;PS prefers to be arranged shoulder&#8208;to&#8208;shoulder in a chain&#8208;like assembly. The confinement effect was studied as well by varying the diameter of pores. The results show that the nanoparticles prefer to arrange into a regular and ordered assembly structure in the strong confinement spaces. Under the synergy of confined spaces and ligands at both ends, the AuNRs@End&#8722;PS are more likely to form a tilted order&#8208;assembly structure. The results of this work could provide new ideas and guidance for the preparation of ordered assembly of AuNRs with novel structures.

         <title>Potent and Selective Cell&#8208;Active Iminosugar Inhibitors of Human &#945;&#8208;N&#8208;Acetylgalactosaminidase (&#945;&#8208;NAGAL)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 44, August 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rapid synthesis of azasugars from achiral materials delivered a potent inhibitor of human N&#8208;acetylglucosaminidase (NAGAL). Guanidine derivative, DGJNGuan, shows nanomolar inhibitory activity and high selectivity in&#8197;vitro. DGJNGuan is active in cells, elevating NAGAL substrate levels in an image&#8208;based assay and shows high selectivity.







Abstract
Glycoside hydrolases (GHs) are a class of enzymes with emerging roles in a range of disease. Selective GH inhibitors are sought to better understand their functions and assess the therapeutic potential of modulating their activities. Iminosugars are a promising class of GH inhibitors but typically lack the selectivity required to accurately perturb biological systems. Here, we describe a concise synthesis of iminosugar inhibitors of N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;galactosaminidase (&#945;&#8208;NAGAL), the GH responsible for cleaving terminal &#945;&#8208;N&#8208;acetylgalactosamine residues from glycoproteins and other glycoconjugates. Starting from non&#8208;carbohydrate precursors, this modular synthesis supported the identification of a potent (490&#8197;nM) and &#945;&#8208;NAGAL selective (&#8764;200&#8208;fold) guanidino&#8208;containing derivative DGJNGuan. To illustrate the cellular activity of this new inhibitor, we developed a quantitative fluorescence image&#8208;based method to measure levels of the Tn&#8208;antigen, a cellular glycoprotein substrate of &#945;&#8208;NAGAL. Using this assay, we show that DGJNGuan exhibits excellent inhibition of &#945;&#8208;NAGAL within cells using patient derived fibroblasts (EC50=150&#8197;nM). Moreover, in&#8197;vitro and in cell assays to assess levels of lysosomal &#946;&#8208;hexosaminidase substrate ganglioside GM2 show that DGJNGuan is selective whereas DGJNAc exhibits off&#8208;target inhibition both in&#8197;vitro and within cells. DGJNGuan is a readily produced and selective tool compound that should prove useful for investigating the physiological roles of &#945;&#8208;NAGAL.

         <title>Controlling Swing Rates in Macrocyclic Molecular Mortise Hinges</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 44, August 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Variable temperature NMR shows that hinge rates can be controlled with steric congestion leading to a &#916;G&#8800; of 13.3 or 16.3&#8197;kcal/mol depending on constituent. These values are largely independent of solvent.







Abstract
Hinge motion is observed in macrocyclic, mortise&#8208;type molecular hinges using variable temperature NMR spectroscopy.

&lt;p&gt;Variable temperature NMR shows that hinge rates can be controlled with steric congestion leading to a &#916;G&lt;sup&gt;&#8800;&lt;/sup&gt; of 13.3 or 16.3&#8197;kcal/mol depending on constituent. These values are largely independent of solvent.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hinge motion is observed in macrocyclic, mortise-type molecular hinges using variable temperature NMR spectroscopy. The data is consistent with dynamic hinging from a folded-to-extended-to-folded enantiomeric state. Crystallographic and solution structures of the folded states are reported. Chemical shift predictions derived from crystallographic data corroborate fully revolute hinge motion. The rate of hinging is affected by steric congestion at the hinge axis. A macrocycle containing glycine, &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;, hinges faster than one comprising aminoisobutyric acid, &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;. The free energies of activation, &#916;G&lt;sup&gt;&#8800;&lt;/sup&gt;, for &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; were determined to be 13.3&#177;0.3&#8197;kcal/mol and 16.3&#177;0.3&#8197;kcal/mol, respectively. This barrier is largely independent of solvent across those surveyed (CD&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OD, CD&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CN, DMSO-&lt;i&gt;d&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;, pyridine-&lt;i&gt;d&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;, D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O). Experiment and computation predict energy barriers that are consistent with disruption of an intramolecular network of hydrogen bonds. DFT calculations reveal a pathway for hinge motion.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

N&#8208;functionalized pyridinium molecules derived from the three major vitamers of vitamin B6, pyridoxal, pyridoxamine and pyridoxine, have been screened computationally for consideration as negative electrode materials in aqueous organic flow batteries.







Abstract
N&#8208;functionalized pyridinium frameworks derived from the three major vitamers of vitamin B6, pyridoxal, pyridoxamine and pyridoxine, have been screened computationally for consideration as negative electrode materials in aqueous organic flow batteries. A molecular database including the structure and the one&#8208;electron standard reduction potential of related pyridinium derivatives has been generated using a computational protocol that combines semiempirical and DFT quantum chemical methods. The predicted reduction potentials span a broad range for the investigated pyridinium frameworks, but pyridoxal derivatives, particularly those involving electron withdrawing substituents, have potentials compatible with the electrochemical stability window of aqueous electrolytes. The stability of radicals formed upon one&#8208;electron reduction has been analyzed by a new computational tool proposed recently for large&#8208;scale computational screening.

         <title>An Amphiphilic Peptide Carrier for HCl Transport</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 44, August 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
HCl transport mediated by amphiphilic peptides that structurally resemble lipids is described. Carboxylate and amide NH groups in the scaffold facilitate ion&#8208;pair transport across the membrane by carrier mechanism.







Abstract
Single molecules that co&#8208;transport cations as well as anions across lipid membranes are few despite their high biological utility. The elegant yet simple lipidomimmetic peptide design herein enables efficient HCl transport without the use of any external additives for proton transport. The carboxylic acids in the dipeptide scaffold provide a handle to append two long hydrophobic tails and also provide a polar hydrophilic carboxylate group. The peptide central unit also provides NH sites for anion binding. Protonation of the carboxylate group coupled with the weak halide binding of the terminal NH group results in HCl transport with transport rates of H+&gt;Cl&#8722;. The lipid&#8208;like structure also facilitates seamless membrane integration and flipping of the molecule. The biocompatibility, design simplicity, and potential pH regulation of these molecules open up several avenues for their therapeutic use.

         <title>Computational Study of Single Metal Atom Anchored on Black Phosphorus for Methane Oxidation to Methanol by Nitrous Oxide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 44, August 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu single metal atoms anchored on black phosphorus are designed as efficient and low&#8208;price catalysts for converting methane to methanol. First&#8208;principles calculations show that Cu@BP exhibits the best methane activation performance through the radical reaction pathways and the formation of the Cu&#8722;O active site is rate&#8208;determining with an energy barrier of 0.48&#8197;eV.







Abstract
Direct conversion of methane to high&#8208;value&#8208;added transportable methanol is a great challenge, which requires high energy input to break the strong C&#8722;H bond. Developing efficient catalysts for methane oxidation to methanol under mild conditions is of vital importance. In this work, single transition metal atoms (TM=Fe, Co, Ni, Cu) anchored on black phosphorus (TM@BP) were studied as catalysts to assist the methane oxidation to methanol by means of first&#8208;principles calculations. The results indicate that Cu@BP exhibits an outstanding catalytic activity through the radical reaction pathways and the formation of the Cu&#8722;O active site is rate&#8208;determining with an energy barrier of 0.48&#8197;eV. Meanwhile, electronic structure calculations and dynamic simulations show that Cu@BP offers excellent thermal stability. Our calculations provide a new approach for the rational design of single atom catalysts for methane oxidation to methanol.

         <title>Sugar&#8208;Bridged Fullerene Dumbbells and Their Interaction with the [10]Cycloparaphenylene Nanoring</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 44, August 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel sugar&#8208;bridged fullerene dumbbells were synthesized and fully characterized. Methano&#8208; and furan&#8208;fused C60 interacted with [10]CPP, an electron&#8208;donating nanoring, to form bis&#8208;pseudorotaxanes. Interestingly, the methano&#8208;dumbbell molecules showed a different binding behaviour as mono&#8208;, bis&#8208;pseudorotaxanes as well as oligomers (polymers) were detected.







Abstract
The synthesis and characterization of four dumbbell&#8208;shaped fullerene molecules connected by isosorbide and isomannide moieties is presented. Additionally, their electrochemical behavior and their ability to form complexes with [10]cycloparaphenylene ([10]CPP) were investigated. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) results of the fullerene dumbbells demonstrate a high electron affinity, indicating their strong interaction with electron&#8208;donating counterparts such as carbon nanorings, which possess complementary charge and shape properties. To study the thermodynamic and kinetic parameters of complexation, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) was employed. NMR titration experiments provided further insights into the binding stoichiometries. Two distinct approaches were utilized to create bridged structures: one based on cyclopropane and the other based on furan. Regardless of the type of linker used, all derivatives formed conventional 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 complexes denoted as [10]CPP2&#8835;C60derivative. However, the methano&#8208;dumbbell molecules exhibited distinct binding behavior, resulting in the formation of mono&#8208; and bis&#8208;pseudorotaxanes, as well as oligomers (polymers). The formation of linear polymers holds significant potential for applications in solar energy conversion processes.

Low energy absorption and emission were realized in a series of anthracene&#8208;derived donor&#8208;acceptor phosphonium dyes. The electron deficiency of the rare phospha&#8208;spiro architecture allowed to achieve fluorescence at 797&#8197;nm in dichloromethane and at 860&#8197;nm in the solid state.







Abstract
Phosphonium&#8208;based compounds gain attention as promising photofunctional materials. As a contribution to the emerging field, we present a series of donor&#8208;acceptor ionic dyes, which were constructed by tailoring phosphonium (A) and extended &#960;&#8208;NR2 (D) fragments to an anthracene framework. The alteration of the &#960;&#8208;spacer of electron&#8208;donating substituents in species with terminal &#8722;+PPh2Me groups exhibits a long absorption wavelength up to &#955;abs=527&#8197;nm in dichloromethane and shifted the emission to the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region (&#955;=805&#8197;nm for thienyl aniline donor), although at low quantum yield (&#934;&lt;0.01). In turn, the introduction of a P&#8208;heterocyclic acceptor substantially narrowed the optical bandgap and improved the efficiency of fluorescence. In particular, the phospha&#8208;spiro moiety allowed to attain NIR emission (797&#8197;nm in dichloromethane) with fluorescence efficiency as high as &#934;=0.12. The electron&#8208;accepting property of the phospha&#8208;spiro constituent outperformed that of the monocyclic and terminal phosphonium counterparts, illustrating a promising direction in the design of novel charge&#8208;transfer chromophores.

         <title>Hydration Rearrangement in the 4&#8208;Aminobenzonitrile&#8722;(H2O)2 Cluster Induced by Photoionization: The Effect of Solvent&#8208;Solvent Interactions</title>

Hydration dynamics and the role of water&#8208;water interaction at the single&#8208;molecule level. Excess energy dependence of IR spectra of the isolated 4&#8208;aminobenzonitrile&#8722;(H2O)2 cluster reveals that photoionization initiates the migration of an intact water dimer from the CN site to the NH site.







Abstract
The interplay between solute&#8208;solvent and solvent&#8208;solvent interactions plays an essential role in solvation dynamics that has important effects on the mechanism and dynamics of chemical reactions in solution. In this study, the rearrangement of the hydration shell induced by photoionization of a solute molecule is probed in a state&#8208; and isomer&#8208;specific manner by resonant multiphoton ionization detected IR spectroscopy of the prototypical 4&#8208;aminobenzonitrile&#8722;(H2O)2 cluster produced in a molecular beam. IR spectra reveal that the water molecules form a cyclic solvent network around the CN group in the initial neutral state (S0). Different from the singly&#8208;hydrated cluster, in which either the CN or the NH2 group is hydrated, hydration of the NH2 group is not observed in the dihydrated cluster. IR spectra obtained after ionizing the solute molecule into the cation ground state (D0) exhibit features ascribed to both NH&#8208;bound and CN&#8208;bound isomers, indicating that water molecules migrate from the CN to the NH site upon ionization with a yield depending on the ionization excess energy. Analysis of the IR spectra as a function of the excess energy shows that migration produces two different NH2 solvated structures, namely (i) the most stable structure in which both N&#8722;H bonds are singly hydrated and (ii) the second most stable isomer in which one of the N&#8722;H bonds is hydrated by a H&#8208;bonded (H2O)2 dimer. The product branching ratio of the two isomers depends on the excess energy. The role of the water&#8208;water interaction in the hydration rearrangement is discussed based on the potential energy landscape. Solvation dynamics plays an important role in reaction mechanisms in the condensed phase, where not only solute&#8208;solvent solvation but also solvent&#8208;solvent interactions have a significant influence on the dynamics. Thus, the investigation of solvation dynamics at the molecular level substantially contributes to our understanding of the reaction mechanism. In this study, the dihydrated cluster of 4ABN was utilized as a model for the first solvation layer to elucidate solvent motions induced by ionization of the solute and the role of W&#8722;W interactions for the solvent relaxation.

         <title>Synthesis of Bisubstrate Analogues for RNA Methylation Studies using two Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Reactions</title>

Two transition metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions are used to synthesize m6A RNA Methyltransferase bisubstrates. Our method involves copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed alkyne&#8208;azide iodo&#8208;cycloaddition (iCuAAC) followed by palladium&#8208;mediated cross&#8208;coupling to obtain bisubstrates containing a SAM analogue (ASAM) linked to adenosine, dinucleotide or pentamer mimicking the RNA substrate (Asub). Docking studies revealed stabilizing interactions between the triazole linker and the enzyme.







Abstract
RNA methyltransferases (RNA MTases) are a family of enzymes that catalyze the methylation of RNA using the cofactor S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;L&#8208;methionine. While RNA MTases are promising drug targets, new molecules are needed to fully understand their roles in disease and to develop effective drugs that can modulate their activity. Since RNA MTases are suitable for bisubstrate binding, we report an original strategy for the synthesis of a new family of m6A MTases bisubstrate analogues. Six compounds containing a S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;L&#8208;methionine (SAM) analogue unit covalently tethered by a triazole ring to the N&#8208;6 position of an adenosine were synthesized. A procedure using two transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions was used to introduce the &#945;&#8208;amino acid motif mimicking the methionine chain of the cofactor SAM. First, a copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed alkyne&#8208;azide iodo&#8208;cycloaddition (iCuAAC) reaction afforded the 5&#8208;iodo&#8208;1,4&#8208;disubstituted&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazole which was functionalized by palladium&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling to connect the &#945;&#8208;amino acid substituent. Docking studies of our molecules in the active site of the m6A ribosomal MTase RlmJ show that the use of triazole as a linker provides additional interactions and the presence of the &#945;&#8208;amino acid chain stabilizes the bisubstrate. The synthetic method developed here enhances the structural diversity of bisubstrate analogues to explore the active site of RNA modification enzymes and to develop new inhibitors.

Mechanochromic luminescence of bis&#8208;o&#8208;carborane&#8208;anthracene triad is described. By introducing ethynylene spacers, the direction of luminescence wavelength shift was changed. Recrystallization of ground samples occur even at room temperature and then the self&#8208;recovery of emission color can be observed.







Abstract
Luminochromic behaviors regarding mechanochromic luminescence (MCL) of o&#8208;carborane&#8208;modified anthracene derivatives are reported. We have previously synthesized bis&#8208;o&#8208;carborane&#8208;substituted anthracene and found that its crystal polymorphs show dual&#8208;emission properties composed of excimer and charge transfer (CT) emission bands in the solid state. Initially, we observed the bathochromic MCL behavior from 1&#8201;a originating from emission mechanism alteration from dual emission to CT emission. By inserting the ethynylene spacers between anthracene and o&#8208;carboranes, compound 2 was obtained. Interestingly, 2 showed hypsochromic MCL originating from the emission mechanism alteration from CT to excimer emission. Furthermore, luminescent color of ground 1&#8201;a can be recovered to the initial state by allowing to stand at room temperature, meaning that self&#8208;recovery proceeds. Detailed analyses are described in this study.

         <title>Sulfur Dioxide Oxidation by Zinc and Zinc Oxide Nitrate/Nitrite Complexes in the Gas Phase: An Interplay between Redox&#8208;Active Ligands and Metal</title>

Ready for oxidation. Sulfur dioxide has been prepared for fast and efficient intracomplex oxidation by oxygen ion transfer from a [Zn2+&#8208;O&#8901;&#8722;]+ core or by electron transfer from the low&#8208;valence Zn+ of zinc and zinc oxide nitrate/nitrite complexes. The nitrogen oxyanionic ligands continue the process, forming sulfate or sulfite as the ending oxidation products.







Abstract
Different oxidative pathways of sulfur dioxide promoted by ZnO(NO3)2&#8722;, Zn(NO3)2&#8722; and Zn(NO2)(NO3)&#8722; are revealed by a joint investigation by mass spectrometry and theoretical calculations. The reactions are triggered by [Zn2+&#8208;O&#8722;&#8901;]+ or by the low&#8208;valence Zn+ through oxygen ion transfer or electron transfer to SO2, respectively. The NOx&#8722; ligands intervene in the oxidation only when sulfur dioxide is converted to SO3&#8722; or SO2&#8722;, leading to the formation of zinc sulfate and zinc sulfite coordinated to nitrate or nitrite anions. Kinetic analyses show that the reactions are fast and efficient, and theory discloses the elementary steps, namely oxygen ion transfer, oxygen atom transfer and electron transfer, occurring through similar energy landscapes for the three reactive anions.

         <title>Diverse Reactions of &#945;&#8208;Diimine&#8208;Ligated MgI&#8722;MgI&#8208;Bonded Compound with Carbodiimides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 44, August 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diverse reaction types: Reactions of dimagnesium(I) [LMg&#8722;MgL] (L=&#945;&#8208;diimine) with carbodiimides proceed via four pathways: 1) Release of one Me3Si of Me3SiNCNSiMe3 to yield either bridging or mononuclear complexes; 2) N=C=N insertion into the Mg&#8722;Mg bond; 3) coupling of two carbodiimides; and 4) double insertion of carbodiimides into a Mg&#8722;C bond to form an alkyne&#8208;bridged bis(amidinate) [(NCy)2C&#8722;C&#8801;C&#8722;C(NCy)2]2&#8722;.







Abstract
The &#945;&#8208;diimine&#8208;ligated dimagnesium(I) compound [K(thf)3]2[LMg&#8722;MgL] (1, L=[(2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3)NC(Me)]22&#8722;) displays diverse reactivities toward carbodiimides (RN=C=NR) with different R substituents. In the reaction of 1 with Me3SiNCNSiMe3, one of the easily leaving trimethylsilyl groups is lost to yield the Me3SiNCN&#8722; moiety that either bridges two MgII centers (2) or terminally coordinated (3). In contrast, with the similarly bulky tBuNCNtBu, the carbodiimide inserts into Mg&#8722;Mg bond with accompanying C&#8722;H activation of a ligand or solvent (products 4 and 5). In the case of dicyclohexyl or diisopropyl carbodiimide, reductive C&#8722;C coupling of two RNCNR molecules occurs to form the [C2(NR)4]2&#8722; diamido moiety, which bridges two Mg centers, giving complexes [{K(dme)2}2LMg(&#956;&#8208;{C2(NR)4})MgL] (6, R=Cy; 7, R=iPr) and [L&#8901;&#8722;Mg(&#956;&#8208;{C2(NR)4})MgL&#8901;&#8722;] (8). Most interestingly, upon treating 1 with Me3SiC&#8801;CSiMe3, the acetylide complex [K(dme)][LMg(C&#8801;CSiMe3)(dme)] (9) was prepared, which undergoes a rare &#8220;double insertion&#8221; with CyNCNCy to afford [K(solv)][K(dme)2LMg(NCy)2C&#8722;C&#8801;C&#8722;C(NCy)2MgL] (10) containing an acetylenediide&#8208;coupled bis(amidinate) ligand that bridges two Mg atoms.

The carboxylative Buchwald&#8211;Hartwig amination is disclosed herein under mild conditions of temperature and under atmospheric pressure of CO2. The key to success is the use of a dual strategy organophotocatalysis/nickel catalysis under visible light irradiation. The developed conditions demonstrated high functional group tolerance toward (hetero)aryl iodide and bromide. Furthermore, preliminary mechanistic investigations including stoichiometric reactions and DFT calculations shed light on the reaction mechanism.







Abstract
Herein we disclosed an unprecedented photochemically driven nickel&#8208;catalyzed carboxylative Buchwald&#8211;Hartwig amination to access a wide range of aryl carbamate derivatives. This reaction is performed under mild condition of temperature and atmospheric pressure of CO2 starting from commercially available (hetero)aryl iodides/bromides derivatives and alkyl amines preventing the formation of hazardous and/or toxic waste. Moreover, preliminary mechanistic investigations including stochiometric experiments as well as DFT calculations allow us to shed light on the reaction mechanism.

         <title>Natural Light&#8208;Regulated Switchable Self&#8208;Adhesive Supramolecular Films for Smart Windows</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 44, August 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The self&#8208;adhesive supramolecular films, which show tough and long&#8208;term stable adhesion to commercially available organic and inorganic glass, are used to construct smart windows. Reversible and rapid transformations in the color and transmittance of smart windows are fully achieved by natural light irradiation in different weather conditions, including sun, rain, and clouds.







Abstract
Switchable self&#8208;adhesive films are promising coating materials for constructing smart windows. Compared to commonly used hydrogels, self&#8208;adhesive supramolecular films have a variety of advantages and serve as a universal carrier of stimuli&#8208;responsiveness. In this study, supramolecular adhesive material is processed into self&#8208;adhesive films, which display tough and long&#8208;term stable adhesion to commercially available organic/inorganic glass windows. Spiropyrans are used as the photo&#8208;responsive units to endow smart windows with switchable optical behavior. Reverse photochromism is successfully realized by the combination of supramolecular films and spiropyrans. Reversible and rapid transformations in the color and transmittance of smart windows are fully achieved by natural light irradiation in different weather conditions, including sun, rain, and clouds.

         <title>Design, Synthesis and Characterization of Palladium&#8208;Functionalized Covalent Organic Framework and Its Application as Heterogeneous Catalysis for C&#8722;H Arylation of Azoles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 44, August 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A palladium&#8208;functionalized covalent organic framework with high thermal and chemical stabilities has been prepared and used as heterogeneous ligand to immobilize PdII. The resulting Pd&#8208;bound COF was found to be an efficient heterogeneous catalyst for the C&#8722;H arylation of azoles and aryl halides with high recyclability.







Abstract
A novel triazine&#8208;based covalent organic framework (TFPT&#8208;Bz COF) has been constructed by the condensation of 2,4,6&#8208;tris(5&#8208;formyl&#8208;2&#8208;pyridinoxy)&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine (TFPT) and benzidine (BZ) with deep eutectic solvent (DES) as the reaction medium. After the introduction of Pd ions through strong coordination to TFPT&#8208;Bz COF matrix, the constructed TFPT&#8208;Bz COF/Pd composite exhibited excellent catalytic activity for C&#8722;H arylation of azoles with aryl halides in 2&#8208;methyltetrahydrofuran. The protocol allows the arylation of a variety of substituted azoles with diverse aryl halides in high to excellent yield. Moreover, the TFPT&#8208;Bz COF/Pd catalyst can be recycled several times without significantly reducing its activity.

         <title>Merger of Rotation Restriction and Symmetrical Push&#8208;Pull to Synthesize Single&#8208;Benzene Yellow Fluorophores</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 44, August 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The construction of symmetrical push&#8208;pull motifs in combination with restricting bond rotations to suppress molecular motions that cause non&#8208;radiative transitions is the key to creating small yet brightly emitting fluorophores. The tetrahydrobenzodifuran moiety is an effective core architecture to realize unique and powerful single&#8208;benzene fluorophores with high quantum yields and large Stokes shifts in a wide range of solvents.







Abstract
Small yet brightly emitting fluorophores should find fundamental and practical applications in both academic and industrial settings. In this report, tetrahydrobenzodifuran is used as the core architecture to create novel single&#8208;benzene fluorophores. The key for realizing unique and powerful photophysical properties is the combination of the construction of symmetrical push&#8208;pull motifs and the restriction of bond rotations to suppress molecular motions that cause non&#8208;radiative transitions.

         <title>Oxidative NHC Catalysis: An Unconventional Tool for Macrocyclic Oligoesters Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 44, August 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Macrocyclic oligoesters (MCOs) are synthesized through N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalysis under highly diluted oxidative condition, starting from commercial dialdehydes and diols, avoiding the use of toxic acyl chlorides. The protocol versatility is confirmed by the employment of fossil&#8208;based and bio&#8208;based monomers, synthesizing a series of synthetically relevant macrocyclic oligoesters, fully characterized by NMR and MALDI&#8208;TOF MS analysis.







Abstract
The application of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalysis under highly diluted oxidative condition to the polycondensation of dialdehydes and diols is herein presented as an alternative, atom&#8208;economical synthetic route to macrocyclic oligoesters (MCOs). The disclosed protocol paves the way to the straightforward access to MCOs, starting from commercial dialdehydes, avoiding the use of toxic diacyl chlorides, commonly employed in traditional MCOs synthetic processes. The method is totally metal&#8208;free, takes place in the green Me&#8208;THF solvent and requires the use of a fully recyclable quinone oxidant. The protocol versatility is confirmed by the employment of fossil&#8208;based and bio&#8208;based monomers such as 2,5&#8208;diformylfuran (DFF), 2,5&#8208;bis(hydroxymethyl)furan (BHMF), and isomannide, synthesizing a series of novel and known synthetically relevant macrocyclic oligoesters, fully characterized by NMR and MALDI&#8208;TOF MS analysis, with product yields (51&#8211;86&#8201;%) comparable to those obtained by traditional synthetic routes. Finally, to emphasize the synthetic relevance of the target macrocycles, an entropically&#8208;driven ring opening polymerization (ED&#8208;ROP) key study has been performed, optimizing the organocatalyzed synthesis of poly(2,5&#8208;furan&#8208;dimethylene 2,5 furandicarboxylate) (PBHMF) with number&#8208;average molecular weight up to 8200&#8197;g mol&#8722;1 and 66&#8201;% isolated yield.

The reactions of a beryllium(I) radical with E2Ph2 (E=S, Se, Te) and of a beryllole with HEPh (E=S, Se) yield the corresponding beryllium phenylchalcogenides, including the first structurally authenticated beryllium selenide and telluride complexes. Calculations show that their Be&#8722;E bonds are best described as ionic, with Coulombic forces accounting for 56&#8201;% of the attraction and orbital interactions dominated by the &#963; component.

         <title>Photocatalytic Cross&#8208;Pinacol Coupling Promoted by Carbon Dioxide
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 44, August 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A first photocatalytic cross&#8208;pinacol coupling was achieved. The reaction proceeded with a various combination of two aldehydes, two ketones, or an aldehyde and a ketone to afford the corresponding unsymmetric vicinal 1,2&#8208;diols in up to 91&#8201;% yield. In this process, an umpoled anionic carbinol synthon was generated in&#8197;situ, by the assistance of CO2 additive, to react nucleophilically with a second electrophilic carbonyl compound.Photocatalytic Cross&#8208;Pinacol Coupling Promoted by Carbon Dioxide (S. Okumura, Y. Uozumi et al.)







Abstract
Cross&#8208;pinacol coupling of two different carbonyl compounds was achieved through successive one&#8208;electron transfer processes under photocatalytic conditions. In the reaction, an umpoled anionic carbinol synthon was generated in&#8197;situ to react nucleophilically with a second electrophilic carbonyl compound. It was revealed that a CO2 additive promoted the photocatalytic generation of the carbinol synthon to suppress undesired radical dimerization. A wide variety of aromatic and aliphatic carbonyl substrates underwent the cross&#8208;pinacol coupling to afford the corresponding unsymmetric vicinal 1,2&#8208;diols, in which even a combination of carbonyl reactants with similar structures such as two aldehydes and two ketones were also well tolerated with high cross&#8208;coupling selectivity.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Directed H2S Probe and Scavenger for Specific Tumor Imaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 44, August 4, 2023. </description>

Sulfide scavenger: Molecular engineering of ligand&#8208;directed H2S&#8208;responsive tools yields a near&#8208;infrared fluorescent probe and a scavenger for specifically imaging and downregulating the intratumoral H2S levels in live mice; this could potentially help to investigate H2S cancer biology and with related therapies.







Abstract
An expanding body of evidence suggests that specifically targeting hydrogen sulfide (H2S) might potentially benefit both tumor diagnosis and treatment, but there is still a lack of cancer&#8208;targeted molecular tools for in&#8197;vivo applications. Here, we report the first ligand&#8208;directed H2S&#8208;specific near&#8208;infrared fluorescent sensor PSMA&#8208;Cy7&#8208;NBD and scavenger PSMA&#8208;Py&#8208;NBD that target the prostate&#8208;specific membrane antigen (PSMA). PSMA&#8208;Cy7&#8208;NBD displays a 53&#8208;fold off&#8211;on fluorescence response to H2S at 803&#8197;nm with high specificity. PSMA&#8208;Py&#8208;NBD can scavenge H2S fast (k2=30.8&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 at 25&#8201;&#176;C) without interference from biothiols. Both tools are highly water&#8208;soluble and can be transported selectively into PSMA&#8208;expressing prostate cancer cells. Endogenous H2S levels in murine 22Rv1 tumor models can be imaged and downregulated by intravenous injection of PSMA&#8208;Cy7&#8208;NBD and PSMA&#8208;Py&#8208;NBD, respectively. These tools could potentially help to investigate H2S cancer biology and with related therapies.

         <title>Cover Feature: Synthesis and Conformational Analysis of Fullerene Torsion Balances for Assessing the Contribution of Dispersion and Anionic Character in Non&#8208;Covalent Arene&#8211;Fullerene Interactions (Chem. Eur. J. 44/2023)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 44, August 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of fullerene&#8208;derived molecular torsion balances have been synthesized to quantitatively evaluate the contribution of the dispersion force to the arene&#8212;fullerene interaction. The torsion balance with a mercaptophenyl group was converted to the corresponding thiophenolate anion by adding an amine. Consequently, the anionic arene&#8212;fullerene interactions were elucidated. More information can be found in the Research Article by M. Yamada and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202300877).

         <title>Front Cover: Merger of Rotation Restriction and Symmetrical Push&#8208;Pull to Synthesize Single&#8208;Benzene Yellow Fluorophores (Chem. Eur. J. 44/2023)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 44, August 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cover shows a series of our single&#8208;benzene fluorophores. Constructing symmetrical push&#8208;pull motifs in combination with restricting bond rotations to suppress molecular motions that cause nonradiative transitions is the key to creating small, yet brightly emitting, fluorophores. The tetrahydrobenzodifuran moiety has proven to be an effective core architecture to realize single&#8208;benzene yellow fluorophores. More information can be found in the Research Article by Y. Okada and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202301411).

         <title>Anion Effects on Spin Crossover Systems: From Supramolecular Chemistry to Magnetism</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 44, August 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anions with diverse types and geometries have been widely used for the synthesis of ionic spin crossover (SCO) complexes. Anions can be classified into different configurations, and the various configurations and types of anions can significantly influence the supramolecular interactions and stacking modes between anions and cations in compounds, ultimately leading to changes in the SCO properties.







Abstract
The field of anion supramolecular chemistry has received more and more attention in recent years. Anions with diverse types and geometries have been widely used for the synthesis of ionic spin crossover (SCO) complexes. This review is devoted to anion effects on the molecular, supramolecular structures and magnetic properties of discrete SCO compounds. Firstly, typical anions used in the synthesis of these compounds are briefly summarized according to their various geometries. This is followed by a collection of representative examples of anion&#8208;based SCO compounds, whose SCO properties are analyzed in terms of supramolecular interactions, geometry and charge of anions. In the third part, anion effects on SCO complexes of different kinds of metal centers and ligands are outlined and finally remarks on the synthesis new type of ionic SCO complexes in the future are described.

         <title>Selective Hydroxylation of C(sp3)&#8722;H Bonds in Steroids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 44, August 4, 2023. </description>

Steroids are C(sp3)&#8208;rich structures and are highly prevalent in small&#8208;molecule therapeutics, with the level of oxidation being key to their biological activity and physicochemical properties. This review covers highly selective methods for the hydroxylation of steroidal C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds: biocatalysis, metal&#8208;catalysed C&#8722;H oxidation, and organic oxidants, such as dioxiranes and oxaziridines.







Abstract
Steroids are highly prevalent structures in small&#8208;molecule therapeutics, with the level of oxidation being key to their biological activity and physicochemical properties. These C(sp3)&#8208;rich tetracycles contain many stereocentres, which are important for creating specific vectors and protein binding orientations. Therefore, the ability to hydroxylate steroids with a high degree of regio&#8208;, chemo&#8208; and stereoselectivity is essential for researchers working in this field. This review will cover three main methods for the hydroxylation of steroidal C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds: biocatalysis, metal&#8208;catalysed C&#8722;H hydroxylation and organic oxidants, such as dioxiranes and oxaziridines.

         <title>The Effect of Intramolecular Hydrogen Bonds on the Rotational Barriers of the Biaryl C&#8208;C Axis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract: Axially chiral compounds are attracting more and more attention recently. Although hydrogen bonds are reported as a vital weak force that influences the properties of compounds, the effect of intramolecular hydrogen bonds on the atropisomerization of the Caryl&#8208;Caryl single bonds has not yet been well quantitatively investigated. Here, a series of axially chiral biaryl compounds were synthesized to study the effect of hydrogen bonds on the rotational barriers of the biaryl C&#8208;C axis. Experimental studies demonstrated that the rotational barrier of hydrogen bonding biaryl 9 was significantly lower (46.7 kJ mol&#8208;1) than biaryl 10 without hydrogen bonds. Furthermore, theoretical studies revealed that the intramolecular hydrogen bond stabilized the transition state of tri&#8208;ortho&#8208;substituted biaryl 9, relieving the steric repulsion in the TS. We believe that this study will provide chemists with a deeper understanding of the atropisomerization process of axially chiral biaryl compounds.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>
Is ring strain the new h&#957;? Tricyclic cis&#8208;fused alkylidene cyclobutanes are obtained cleanly from the intramolecular [2+2] trapping of 1,2&#8208;cyclohexadienes with styrenes and electron&#8208;deficient olefins.

This reaction &#8211; which occurs at ambient conditions &#8211; provides a mild alternative to classical [2+2] reactions which employ UV light activation or transition metal catalysis.







Abstract
1,2&#8208;Cyclohexadienes generated under mild fluoride&#8208;mediated desilylative conditions undergo efficient intramolecular [2+2] trapping, providing tricyclic alkylidene cyclobutanes with complete diastereoselectivity for the cis&#8208;fused products. Pendent styrenes or electron&#8208;deficient olefins can trap simple 1,2&#8208;cyclohexadienes or their oxygenated counterparts, with 14 substrates being disclosed. Reactions proceed at ambient temperature using just cesium fluoride in up to 91&#8201;% yield, and the necessary precursors are easily accessed from substituted 2&#8208;bromocyclohexenones. Multiple synthetic routes have been developed to install the appropriate functional groups required for [2+2] trapping.

A novel ZnII biological metal&#8211;organic framework mimics &#946;&#8208;lactamase enzymes. The crystal structure of a novel Zn&#8208;based biological MOF occupies the central position to reflect the crucial role that its porous functional channels play in the capture, immobilization and degradation of amoxicillin. The crystal structures of amoxicillin and the degraded derivative surround the MOF, indicating the differences in the antibiotic before and after entering the bioMOF.

         <title>SN2 versus E2 Competition of Cyclic Ethers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Our quantum chemical analyses reveal how the ring size of cyclic ethers has opposite effects on SN2 and E2 pathways and thus on the SN2/E2 competition. The preferred reaction pathway switches from E2, for large cyclic substrates, to SN2, for small cyclic substrates.







Abstract
We have quantum chemically studied the influence of ring strain on the competition between the two mechanistically different SN2 and E2 pathways using a series of archetypal ethers as substrate in combination with a diverse set of Lewis bases (F&#8722;, Cl&#8722;, Br&#8722;, HO&#8722;, H3CO&#8722;, HS&#8722;, H3CS&#8722;), using relativistic density functional theory at ZORA&#8208;OLYP/QZ4P. The ring strain in the substrate is systematically increased on going from a model acyclic ether to a 6&#8208; to 5&#8208; to 4&#8208; to 3&#8208;membered ether ring. We have found that the activation energy of the SN2 pathway sharply decreases when the ring strain of the system is increased, thus on going from large to small cyclic ethers, the SN2 reactivity increases. In contrast, the activation energy of the E2 pathway generally rises along this same series, that is, from large to small cyclic ethers. The opposing reactivity trends induce a mechanistic switch in the preferred reaction pathway for strong Lewis bases from E2, for large cyclic substrates, to SN2, for small cyclic substrates. Weak Lewis bases are unable to overcome the higher intrinsic distortivity of the E2 pathway and, therefore, always favor the less distortive SN2 reaction.

The preferred reaction pathway switches from E2, for large cyclic substrates, to S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2, for small cyclic substrates.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have quantum chemically studied the influence of ring strain on the competition between the two mechanistically different S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2 and E2 pathways using a series of archetypal ethers as substrate in combination with a diverse set of Lewis bases (F&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, Cl&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, Br&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, HO&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, HS&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CS&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;), using relativistic density functional theory at ZORA-OLYP/QZ4P. The ring strain in the substrate is systematically increased on going from a model acyclic ether to a 6- to 5- to 4- to 3-membered ether ring. We have found that the activation energy of the S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2 pathway sharply decreases when the ring strain of the system is increased, thus on going from large to small cyclic ethers, the S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2 reactivity increases. In contrast, the activation energy of the E2 pathway generally rises along this same series, that is, from large to small cyclic ethers. The opposing reactivity trends induce a mechanistic switch in the preferred reaction pathway for strong Lewis bases from E2, for large cyclic substrates, to S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2, for small cyclic substrates. Weak Lewis bases are unable to overcome the higher intrinsic distortivity of the E2 pathway and, therefore, always favor the less distortive S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2 reaction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>N&#8208;Oxides as Control Element for the Direction of a Sigmatropic Rearrangement: Application as a Switch for Fluorescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple change of solvent swaps the predominance of each of these two isomers: The high affinity of the N&#8208;oxide moiety for water and other hydroxylated solvents is responsible for this unprecedented &#8216;Reverse Meisenheimer Rearrangement&#8217;. The N&#8208;oxide fragment thus serves as an &#8216;on/off&#8217; switch for fluorescence and possibly several other applications.







Abstract
An exceptional level of control over the direction of the (2,3)&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement between N&#8208;oxides and alkoxylamine is achieved by simply changing the solvent in which they are dissolved. Protic solvents like water, methanol and hexafluoroisopropanol favour the N&#8208;oxide form, while other solvents like acetone, acetonitrile and benzene favour the alkoxylamine. The reaction temperature and nature of the substituents on the alkene affect the rate of rearrangement. A N&#8208;oxide fragment was attached to two fluorescent molecules and acted as an on/off switch for their fluorescence. The conversion of alkoxylamines into the corresponding N&#8208;oxides has not previously been described and is here termed the &#8216;Reverse Meisenheimer Rearrangement&#8217;.

         <title>Fibrils Emerging from Droplets: Molecular Guiding Principles behind Phase Transitions of a Short Peptide&#8208;Based Condensate Studied by Solid&#8208;State NMR
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phase transitions of short peptide&#8208;based condensates are studied by TEM and solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy. Structural modelling based on NMR distance restraints suggests that matured droplets are stabilized by hydrogen bonds along the fibril axis and side&#8208;chain &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions, pointing to the possible role of such noncovalent interactions in liquid&#8208;to&#8208;solid transitions.







Abstract
Biochemical reactions occurring in highly crowded cellular environments require different means of control to ensure productivity and specificity. Compartmentalization of reagents by liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation is one of these means. However, extremely high local protein concentrations of up to 400&#8197;mg/ml can result in pathological aggregation into fibrillar amyloid structures, a phenomenon that has been linked to various neurodegenerative diseases. Despite its relevance, the process of liquid&#8208;to&#8208;solid transition inside condensates is still not well understood at the molecular level. We thus herein use small peptide derivatives that can undergo both liquid&#8208;liquid and subsequent liquid&#8208;to&#8208;solid phase transition as model systems to study both processes. Using solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), we compare the structure of condensed states of leucine, tryptophan and phenylalanine containing derivatives, distinguishing between liquid&#8208;like condensates, amorphous aggregates and fibrils, respectively. A structural model for the fibrils formed by the phenylalanine derivative was obtained by an NMR&#8208;based structure calculation. The fibrils are stabilised by hydrogen bonds and side&#8208;chain &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions, which are likely much less pronounced or absent in the liquid and amorphous state. Such noncovalent interactions are equally important for the liquid&#8208;to&#8208;solid transition of proteins, particularly those related to neurodegenerative diseases.

         <title>Reactions of Tetra(o&#8208;tolyl)diborane(4) with Organic Azides: Formation of Fluorescent Boron&#8208;Fused Hexazenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel B2N6 heterocycle could be obtained by the reaction of tetra(o&#8208;tolyl)diborane(4) with primary alkyl azides. Experimental and theoretical studies revealed the stepwise mechanism, in which two azide molecules sequentially reacted. This B2N6 heterocycle exhibited a strong fluorescence with a high fluorescent quantum yield. In the case of using aryl, 3&#176;&#8208;alkyl, and 2&#176;&#8208;alkyl azides, different products were obtained depending on the substituents.







Abstract
The reaction of tetra(o&#8208;tolyl)diborane(4) with organic azides afforded three different compounds, diborylamines, diboryltriazenes, and B2&#8208;hexazenes having a bicyclic B2N6 ring system. The reaction with aryl azides gave diborylamines, while the reaction with 1&#8197;equiv. of alkyl azides furnished diboryltriazenes. In the case of the reaction with an excess amount of primary alkyl azide, a new heterocyclic B2&#8208;hexazenes were obtained. The formation of the B2N6 structure could be explained by one general reaction mechanism via the diboryltriazene intermediate according to the control experiments and DFT calculations. The B2&#8208;hexazenes exhibited a strong fluorescence with a remarkably high fluorescent quantum yield of up to 96&#8201;%.

         <dc:description>
The new cyanido&#8208;sulfate anion, [SO3CN]&#8722;, is a complex of the Lewis base CN&#8722; and the Lewis acid SO3. The ion the a pseudo&#8208;halide analogon of the well&#8208;known fluorido&#8208; and chlorido&#8208;sulfates. Its formation is astonishing because the oxidation of the cyanide ion by SO3 seems to be favorable. For the successful preparation it seems to be benefitial that the synthesis can be carried out at room temperature.







Abstract
The reaction of the pyridine adduct of SO3 and tetra&#8208;n&#8208;butyl&#8208;ammonium cyanide, [N(nBu)4][CN] at room temperature leads to the unprecedented cyanido&#8208;sulfate anion [SO3CN]&#8722; stabilized in the salt [N(nBu)4][SO3CN]. The anion is a pseudo&#8208;halogen congener of the well&#8208;known fluoro&#8208; and chloro&#8208;sulfates. The new anion has been studied by vibrational spectroscopy and theoretical calculations.

         <title>The &#8220;How&#8221; and &#8220;Where&#8221; Behind the Functionalization of Graphene Oxide by Thiol&#8208;ene &#8220;Click&#8221; Chemistry</title>

A controlled and orthogonal derivatization of the alkene groups of graphene oxide can be achieved by thiol&#8208;ene radical addition and thiol&#8208;ene Michael addition. The reaction is triggered by either the addition of radical initiators or base catalysts.







Abstract
Graphene oxide (GO) is a 2D nanomaterial with unique chemistry due to the combination of sp2 hybridization and oxygen functional groups (OFGs) even in single layer. OFGs play a fundamental role in the chemical functionalization of GO to produce GO&#8208;based materials for diverse applications. However, traditional strategies that employ epoxides, alcohols, and carboxylic acids suffer from low control and undesirable side reactions, including by&#8208;product formation and GO reduction. Thiol&#8208;ene &#8220;click&#8221; reaction offers a promising and versatile chemical approach for the alkene functionalization (&#8722;C=C&#8722;) of GO, providing orthogonality, stereoselectivity, regioselectivity, and high yields while reducing by&#8208;products. This review examines the chemical functionalization of GO via thiol&#8208;ene &#8220;click&#8221; reactions, providing insights into the underlying reaction mechanisms, including the role of radical or base catalysts in triggering the reaction. We discuss the &#8220;how&#8221; and &#8220;where&#8221; the reaction takes place on GO, the strategies to avoid unwanted side reactions, such as GO reduction and by&#8208;product formation. We anticipate that multi&#8208;functionalization of GO via the alkene groups will enhance GO physicochemical properties while preserving its intrinsic chemistry.

         <title>Structural Expansion of Cyclohepta[def]fluorene towards Azulene&#8208;Embedded Non&#8208;Benzenoid Nanographenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of unprecedented non&#8208;benzenoid NGs containing cyclohepta[def]fluorine unit are obtained via on&#8208;surface synthesis on Au(111). Scanning tunneling microscopy and non&#8208;contact atomic force microscopy evidence their structures and conformations. Moreover, the dynamics of the precursor and its reaction products on the surface are analyzed by DFT and MD simulations.







Abstract
Non&#8208;benzenoid non&#8208;alternant nanographenes (NGs) have attracted increasing attention on account of their distinct electronic and structural features in comparison to their isomeric benzenoid counterparts. In this work, we present a series of unprecedented azulene&#8208;embedded NGs on Au(111) during the attempted synthesis of cyclohepta[def]fluorene&#8208;based high&#8208;spin non&#8208;Kekul&#233; structure. Comprehensive scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and non&#8208;contact atomic force microscopy (nc&#8208;AFM) evidence the structures and conformations of these unexpected products. The dynamics of the precursor bearing 9&#8208;(2,6&#8208;dimethylphenyl)anthracene and dihydro&#8208;dibenzo&#8208;cyclohepta[def]fluorene units and its reaction products on the surface are analyzed by density functional theory (DFT) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Our study sheds light on the fundamental understanding of precursor design for the fabrication of &#960;&#8208;extended non&#8208;benzenoid NGs on a metal surface.

         <title>Materials for Electrochemiluminescence: TADF, Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding, and Aggregation&#8208; and Crystallization&#8208;Induced Emission Luminophores</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes recent advances towards enhanced electrochemiluminescence (ECL) using novel design strategies such as thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) luminophores (both donor&#8208;acceptor and multiresonance), hydrogen&#8208;bonding complexes, and aggregation&#8208; and crystallization&#8208;induced emission strategies. In many scenarios, the ECL enhancement is shown to be significant, thus suggesting future applications for thin film optoelectronics and sensing. These new avenues of intelligent ECL luminophore designs are expected to be of great importance for ECL&#8208;related research.







Abstract
Electrochemiluminescence (ECL) is a rapidly growing discipline with many analytical applications from immunoassays to single&#8208;molecule detection. At the forefront of ECL research is materials chemistry, which looks at engineering new materials and compounds exhibiting enhanced ECL efficiencies compared to conventional fluorescent materials. In this review, we summarize recent molecular design strategies that lead to high efficiency ECL. In particular, we feature recent advances in the use of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters to produce enhanced electrochemiluminescence. We also document how hydrogen bonding, aggregation, and crystallization can each be recruited in the design of materials showing enhanced electrochemiluminescence.

         <title>The Best of Both Worlds: Combining the Power of MICs and WCAs To Generate Stable and Crystalline CrI&#8208;Tetracarbonyl Complexes with &#960;&#8208;Accepting Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reversible oxidation of chromium tetracarbonyl complexes with bidentate &#960;&#8208;accepting ligands is a rare phenomenon, as the resulting electron deficiency at the metal center is often accompanied by subsequent CO dissociation. The incorporation of highly &#963;&#8208;donating pyridyl&#8208;mesoionic carbenes (py&#8208;MIC) facilitates the stabilization of highly reactive 17 VE species, while retaining the &#960;&#8208;acceptor properties. In combination with weakly coordinating anions (WCA), it was possible to isolate for the first time stable and crystalline CrI tetracarbonyl complexes with &#960;&#8208;accepting ligands. More information can be found in the Research Article by B. Sarkar and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202301205).

         <dc:description>We report the synthesis of&#160;&#223;&#8208;cyclodextrin&#8208;modified graphene oxide nanosheets, having different sized alkyl linkers (GO&#8208;Cn&#8208;&#223;CD) and their exploitation as sorbent of per&#8208;and polyfluorinated alkyl substances (PFAS) contaminants from drinking water.&#160;&#223;CDs were functionalized with pending amino group and the resulting precursors grafted to GO nanosheets by epoxide ring opening reaction. Loading of &#223;CD units in the range 16&#8208;36% was estimated by combined XPS and Elemental analysis. Adsorption tests on&#160;&#160;PFBA, a particularly persistent PFAS selected as case study, revealed a strong influence of the alkyl linker length on the adsorption efficiency with the hexyl linker derivative GO&#8208;C6&#8208;&#223;CD outperforming both pristine GO and granular activated carbon (GAC), the standard sorbent benchmark. Molecular dynamics simulations ascribed this evidence to the favorable orientation of the &#946;&#8208;CD unit on the surface of GO which enables a strong contaminant molecules&#160;&#160;retention.</dc:description>

Molecular dynamics simulations ascribed this evidence to the favorable orientation of the &#946;-CD unit on the surface of GO which enables a strong contaminant molecules&#160;&#160;retention.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dimension Tuning of All&#8208;inorganic Ag&#8208;based Metal Halides by Solvent Engineering</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dimension growth of metal halides is important for its properties and applications. However, such dimension control of the metal halides is rarely reported in the literature and the growth mechanism is not clear yet. A minute difference of solvent properties can tremendously alter the process of nucleation and growth of crystals. Herein, an intriguing phenomenon of dimension tuning for Ag&#8208;based metal halides is reported. The 1D Cs2AgCl3 crystals can be obtained in pure DMF while the 2D CsAgCl2 crystals are obtained in pure DMSO. Both exhibit bright yellow emission, which are derived from self&#8208;trapping excitons (STEs). The photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of Cs2AgCl3 (1D) and CsAgCl2 (2D) are 28.46% and 20.61%, respectively. In order to understand the mechanism of the dimension change, additional solvents (DMAC, DMPU) are also selected to process the precursor for crystal growth. By comparing the functional group, dielectric constant, and donor number among the four solvents, we find the donor number plays the predominant role in nucleation process for Cs2AgCl3 and CsAgCl2. This research reveals the relationship between coordination ability of the solvent and the dimension of metal halides.</dc:description>

         <title>Electroactive Dyes Based on 1,8&#8208;Naphthalimide with Acetylene Linkers as Promising OLED Materials &#8211; the Relationship Between Structure and Photophysical Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Four A&#8208;&#960;&#8208;D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A type small organic molecules with 1,8&#8208;naphthalimide motifs were successfully synthesised. The designed compounds are built of two 1,8&#8208;naphthalimide units linked via ethynyl &#960;&#8208;linkages with selected functionalised donor motifs i.e. 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bithiophene, fluorene, phenothiazine and carbazole derivative. The synthesis based on Sonogashira cross&#8208;coupling allowed us to obtain the presented dyes with good yields. The resulting symmetrical small molecules&#8217; optical, electrochemical and thermal properties were thoroughly investigated, and their potential applicability for the OLED devices was demonstrated. In addition, the relationship between molecular structure and properties was considered by employing experimental and theoretical studies. As a result of using various donor groups, it was possible to achieve efficient electroluminescence in the range from green (DEV4) to orange&#8208;red light (DEV3) with a maximum luminance of 3 820 cd/m2 for DEV4. Upon the insertion of an acetylene linker to the designed molecules, the free rotation of D and A fragments, and hence the effective &#960;&#8208;electron communication within the entire molecule, is possible, which was confirmed by DFT studies. The obtained dyes are characterised by high thermal stability, reversible oxidation&#8208;reduction process, satisfactory optoelectronic properties and good solubility in organic solvents, which is advisable for the application in small molecular organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (SM&#8208;OLEDs) technology.</dc:description>

         <title>Organocatalytic Enantioselective Intramolecular Michael Addition via In Situ Generated Aminoisobenzofulvenes: Construction of Spiro Quaternary Carbon Stereocenters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An unprecedented enantioselective organocatalytic spirocyclization strategy is presented via in situ generation of aminoisobezofulvenes. The reaction sequence involves a reductive Michael/aldol&#8208;condensation/Michael addition cascade via iminium&#8208;enamine catalysis. The key success of this spirocyclization was the formation of intermediatory nucleophilic aminoisobenzofuvenes accountable for intramolecular Michael addition. Benzospirononanes featuring an all carbon qauternary spirocenter were obtained using proline&#8208;derived amino&#8208;organocatalyst in moderate to good yields and excellent diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivities (up to &gt;20:1 dr, and 99% ee). Post&#8208;methodological manipulation of benzospirononanes was also demonstrated.</dc:description>

         <title>Ru(II)&#8208;Cyanine Complexes as Promising Photodynamic Photosensitizers for the Treatment of Hypoxic Tumours with Highly Penetrating 770 nm Near&#8208;Infrared Light</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Light&#8208;activated treatments, such as photodynamic therapy (PDT), provide temporal and spatial control over a specific cytotoxic response by exploiting toxicity differences between irradiated and dark conditions. In this work, a novel strategy for developing near infrared (NIR)&#8208;activatable Ru(II) polypyridyl&#8208;based photosensitizers (PSs) was successfully developed through the incorporation of symmetric heptamethine cyanine dyes in the metal complex via a phenanthrimidazole ligand. Owing to their strong absorption in the NIR region, the PSs could be efficiently photoactivated with highly penetrating NIR light (770 nm), leading to high photocytotoxicities towards several cancer cell lines under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions. Notably, our lead PS (Ru&#8208;Cyn&#8208;1), which accumulated in the mitochondria, exhibited a good photocytotoxic activity under challenging low&#8208;oxygen concentration (2% O2) upon NIR light irradiation conditions (770 nm), owing to a combination of types I and II PDT mechanism. The fact that the PS Protoporphyrin IX (PpIX), the metabolite of the clinically approved 5&#8208;ALA PS, was found inactive under the same challenging conditions positions Ru&#8208;Cyn&#8208;1 complex as a promising PDT agent for the treatment of deep&#8208;seated hypoxic tumours.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>In the classical Inverse Electron&#8208;Demand Diels&#8211;Alder (IEDDA) reactions between alkenes and tetrazines, 4,5&#8208;dihydropyridazines are formed. 4,5&#8208;Dihydropyridazines are rapidly converted to the more energetically stable 1,4&#8208;dihydropyridazines by 1,3&#8208;prototropic isomerization. In this study, instead of 1,4&#8208;dihydropyridazines, 4,5&#8208;dihydropyridazine&#8208;3(2H)&#8208;ones were obtained as a result of IEDDA reactions between tetrazines with leaving groups at the 3,6&#8208;positions, and norbornene and barrelene&#8208;derived polycyclic alkenes in the presence of moisture in air or solvent. To show that this new method works not only on strained polycyclic alkenes but also on monocyclic and linear alkenes, the corresponding 4,5&#8208;dihydropyridazine&#8208;3(2H)&#8208;ones were obtained in high yields from the reactions performed with styrene and cyclopentene as well. The chemical structures of the polycyclic 4,5&#8208;dihydropyridazine&#8208;3(2H)&#8208;ones were determined by NMR and HRMS analyses. In addition, the exact structures of the polycyclic 4,5&#8208;dihydropyridazine&#8208;3(2H)&#8208;ones were also experimentally proven by converting them to pyridazine&#8208;3(2H)&#8208;ones known in the literature.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible Light and Triselenium Dicyanide (TSD): New Horizons in the Synthesis of Organic Selenocyanates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we describe a new method for the synthesis of &#945;&#8208;carbonyl selenocyanates by reacting triselenium dicyanide (TSD) and styrenes under blue light irradiation and O2 atmosphere. The reactions are triggered by the formation of Se&#8208;centered radical species, followed by the addition/oxidation of the styrene &#960;&#8208;bond. &#945;&#8208;Carbonyl selenocyanates and &#945;&#8208;hydroxy selenocyanates were obtained in moderate to excellent yields from aryl&#8208; and alkyl&#8208;substituted alkenes, respectively.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Herein we describe a new method for the synthesis of &#945;-carbonyl selenocyanates by reacting triselenium dicyanide (TSD) and styrenes under blue light irradiation and O2 atmosphere. The reactions are triggered by the formation of Se-centered radical species, followed by the addition/oxidation of the styrene &#960;-bond. &#945;-Carbonyl selenocyanates and &#945;-hydroxy selenocyanates were obtained in moderate to excellent yields from aryl- and alkyl-substituted alkenes, respectively. It was demonstrated that &#945;-carbonyl selenocyanates could be used as a synthetic platform in a multicomponent reaction strategy to prepare 2-phenylimidazo[1,2-a]pyridine derivatives, which were evaluated for their photophysical properties. Overall, this new method provides a useful tool for synthesizing &#945;-carbonyl selenocyanates, demonstrating their potential for use in the synthesis of other compounds, and opening new synthetic opportunities to construct organic selenocyanate compounds.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Structural Insight on Supramolecular Polyion Salts: Inositol Hexaphosphate Enclosed in Cationic Macrocyclic Clusters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular macrocyclic forces have been used to trap phytate, myo&#8208;inositol&#8208;1,2,3,4,5,6&#8208;hexakisphosphate, a key bioanion with multiple roles in metabolic processes. Due to the complex chemistry of six multivalent phosphates surrounding the small, cyclic inositol framework, crystallographic information of simple phytate salts has been elusive. This report represents a combined crystallographic, theoretical, and solution binding investigation of a supramolecular macrocyclic complex of phytate.&#160; Together the results provide significant insight to phytate&#8217;s intramolecular and intermolecular interactions at the microenvironment level. The macrocycle&#8208;phytate aggregates consist of phytate anionic pairs, each partly sandwiched by two 24&#8208;membered, amide/amine&#8208;based cationic macrocycles. &#160;The phytate ion pairs hold the tetramer macrocyclic array together by six strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds. Both phytates crystallize in 1a5e phosphate conformations (one axial (P2) and five equatorial phosphates). Solution NMR binding studies in 1:1 DMSO&#8208;d6:D2O indicate 2:1 macrocycle:phytate associations, suggesting that the sandwich&#8208;like nature of the complex holds together in solution. DFT studies indicate the likely occurrence of dynamic intramolecular interchange of phosphate protons, as well as important roles for the axial (P2) phosphate in both intramolecular and intermolecular hydrogen bonding interactions.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>
We've got you surrounded! Conjugated units that are encapsulated within the cavities of macrocycles can have unique properties often including the ability to rotate or wobble within an otherwise stationary crystal lattice. We introduce a strategy for forming macrocycles of this type in only a few synthetic steps using pyridine coordination to transition metals as the final, ring&#8208;closing step. More information can be found in the Research Article by N.&#8197;P.&#8197;Bowling and co&#8208;workers. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202301745).

         <title>Harnessing Pillar[5]arene Host&#8211;Guest Complexation To Improve pH Stability and Affect Enzymatic Degradation of the Anticancer Prodrug Capecitabine: A 19F&#160;NMR Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Improving the ADMET: The stability of capecitabine, a widely used oral chemotherapeutic prodrug sold under the brand name Xeloda, in an acidic environment can be improved significantly by complexation with water&#8208;soluble pillararene derivatives. These host systems also modulate the enzymatic degradation of this clinically used anticancer prodrug.







Abstract
Cancer is a global health problem, and supramolecular chemotherapy is emerging as a novel strategy to battle the disease. Here, we first evaluated the thermodynamic and kinetic stability of the complexes formed between several water&#8208;soluble per&#8208;substituted pillar[5]arene derivatives and capecitabine (1), a widely used oral chemotherapeutic prodrug. The exchange rate was studied, for the first time in pillararene chemistry, by the 19F guest exchange saturation transfer (GEST) NMR technique. Importantly, when we evaluated the effect of complexation on the characteristics of 1, we found that the complexation of 1 with such pillar[5]arene hosts increased capecitabine stability at acidic pH very significantly and slowed its enzymatic degradation by the carboxylesterase enzyme in a manner that depended on the host. These interesting findings could have implications on the clinical use of this heavily used prodrug and might affect the management of cancer patients.

         <title>Reactivity of [AuF3(SIMes)]: Pathway to Unprecedented Structural Motifs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Offering a hand in gold fluorine chemistry: The trans&#8208;F in [AuF3(SIMes)] can be substituted by several ligands with varying electronic properties, yielding complexes of the type trans&#8208;[AuF2X(SIMes)]. They are introduced either by using trimethylsilyl compounds or, by using electron&#8208;deficient carbonyl&#8208;bearing molecules, the latter route being new in gold chemistry.







Abstract
We report on a comprehensive reactivity study starting from [AuF3(SIMes)] to synthesize different motifs of monomeric gold(III) fluorides. A plethora of different ligands has been introduced in a mono&#8208;substitution yielding trans&#8208;[AuF2X(SIMes)] including alkynido, cyanido, azido, and a set of perfluoroalkoxido complexes. The latter were better accomplished via use of perfluorinated carbonyl&#8208;bearing molecules, which is unprecedented in gold chemistry. In case of the cyanide and azide, triple substitution gave rise to the corresponding [AuX3(SIMes)] complexes. Comparison of the chemical shift of the carbene carbon atom in the 13C{1H}&#8197;NMR spectrum, the calculated SIMes affinity and the Au&#8722;C bond length in the solid state with related literature&#8208;known complexes yields a classification of trans&#8208;influences for a variety of ligands attached to the gold center. Therein, the mixed fluorido perfluoroalkoxido complexes have a similar SIMes affinity to AuF3 with a very low Gibbs energy of formation when using the perfluoro carbonyl route.

         <title>Stepwise Functionalization of Single&#8208;Walled Carbon Nanotubes with Subsequent Molecular Conversion to Control Photoluminescence Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stepwise approach combining the functionalization of single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) and subsequent reactions to introduce functional groups into the addenda on the SWCNTs achieved control over the photoluminescence properties and the addition of functionality in the addenda.







Abstract
Functionalization of single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) has attracted interest because it alters the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photoluminescence (PL) wavelength and emission efficiency. These modifications depend on the binding configuration and degree of functionalization. Excessive functionalization reduces the emission efficiency as the integrity of the conjugated &#960; system decreases; thus, controlling the degree of functionalization is essential. Because the binding configurations and degree of functionalization are affected by the reagent structure, a stepwise approach combining SWCNTs functionalization and subsequent reactions to introduce functional groups into the addenda could effectively control their PL properties and functionalities. We studied this approach by implementing the reductive alkylation of SWCNTs by using bromoalkanes with t&#8208;butyl carbamate (Boc)&#8208;protected amino groups and subsequent deprotection and amidation reactions. The reaction products were analyzed based on absorption, PL, and Raman spectroscopy and the Kaiser test. Depending on the structure of the reagent, deprotection and amidation reactions competed with the elimination reaction of addenda, altering the PL properties of the SWCNTs. Furthermore, the elimination reaction was inhibited in the adducts functionalized using dibromoalkane with Boc&#8208;protected amino groups, demonstrating that the use of appropriate reagents enables the molecular conversion of the functional groups of SWCNT adducts without affecting their PL properties.

         <title>Vectorization via Siderophores Increases Antibacterial Activity of K(RW)3 Peptides against Pseudomonas aeruginosa</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of Trojan Horse antibiotics is introduced, consisting of a six amino acid long synthetic antimicrobial peptide (synAMPs) and a number of different siderophore&#8208;type vectors. Excellent activity and internalization by a (yet) unidentified receptor are key features of the new conjugates.







Abstract
A series of new conjugates comprised from a small synthetic antimicrobial peptide (AMP) and a siderophore&#8208;type vector component was designed and tested for activity on P. aeruginosa PAO1 and several genetically modified strains. As AMP, the well&#8208;established arginine&#8208;tryptophane combination K(RW)3 (P1) was chosen with an added lysine for siderophore attachment. This peptide is easy to prepare, modify, and possesses good anti&#8208;bacterial activity. On the vector part, we examined several moieties: (i) the natural siderophore deferoxamine (DFO); (ii) bidentate iron chelators based on the hydroxamate building block (4&#8201;a&#8211;c) ; (iii) the non&#8208;siderophore chelators deferasirox (DFX) and deferiprone&#8208;carboxylate (DFP&#8208;COOH). All conjugates were prepared by solid phase synthesis techniques and fully characterized by HPLC and mass spectrometry (including HR&#8208;MS). 55Fe uptake assays indicate a receptor&#8208;mediated uptake for 4&#8201;a&#8211;c, DFP&#8208;COOH and DFO, which is dependent on the outer membrane transporter FoxA in the case of DFO. All conjugates showed increased antibacterial activity against P. aeruginosa compared to the parent peptide P1 alone when investigated in iron&#8208;depleted medium. MIC values were as low as 2&#8197;&#956;M (for P1&#8208;DFP) on wild type P. aeruginosa. The activity of P1&#8208;DFO and P1&#8208;DFP was even better on genetically mutated strains unable to produce siderophores (down to 0.5&#8197;&#956;M). Although the DFX vector on its own was not able to transport iron inside the bacterial cell as shown by 55Fe uptake studies, the P1&#8208;DFX conjugate had excellent antibacterial activity compared to P1 (2&#8197;&#956;M, and as low as 0.25&#8197;&#956;M on a receptor&#8208;deficient strain unable to produce siderophores), suggesting that the conjugates were indeed recognized and internalized by an (unknown) transporter. Control experiments with an equimolar mixture of P1 and DFX confirm that the observed activity is intrinsic to vectorization. This work thus demonstrates the power of linking small AMPs covalently to siderophores for a new class of Trojan Horse antibiotics, with P1&#8208;DFP and P1&#8208;DFX being the most potent conjugates.

The cover picture illustrates a molecule as a racing car driving on a circuit. The frame of the racing car shows the central skeleton of the molecule of different shape, which can be converted as it passes through a gate (electrode), accompanied by a drastic change in color. This cover implies that the redox reaction occurs in a stepwise manner, and they show tricolor chromic response. Moreover, the circuit represents its high reversibility. More information can be found in the Research Article by Y.&#8197;Ishigaki and co&#8208;workers. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202301476).

         <title>Five Novel Silver&#8208;Based Coordination Polymers as Photoluminescent Sensing Platforms for the Detection of Nitrobenzene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Luminescent silver cluster&#8208;based coordination polymers composed of Ag10 or Ag12 cluster cores and multidentate pyridine linkers were synthesized as well as luminescent polymorphic silver(I)&#8208;based coordination polymers. It was found that these coordination polymers exhibit highly sensitive luminescence quenching effect to nitrobenzene, attributed to the &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interactions between the polymers and nitrobenzene as well as the electron&#8208;withdrawing character of nitrobenzene. More information can be found in the Research Article by S.&#8197;Das, Prof. Y.&#8197;Negishi and co&#8208;workers. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202300706).

         <title>The Power of Automation in Polymer Chemistry: Precision Synthesis of Multiblock Copolymers with Block Sequence Control</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An open&#8208;to&#8208;air, room&#8208;temperature RAFT polymerization procedure is employed in an automated platform to produce unprecedented complex macromolecular structures unobtainable manually. The precise structures made using this machine pave the way for the next generation of material design, harnessing large databases accessible using such automated material manufacturing.







Abstract
Machines can revolutionize the field of chemistry and material science, driving the development of new chemistries, increasing productivity, and facilitating reaction scale up. The incorporation of automated systems in the field of polymer chemistry has however proven challenging owing to the demanding reaction conditions, rendering the automation setup complex and costly. There is an imminent need for an automation platform which uses fast and simple polymerization protocols, while providing a high level of control on the structure of macromolecules via precision synthesis. This work combines an oxygen tolerant, room temperature polymerization method with a simple liquid handling robot to automatically prepare precise and high order multiblock copolymers with unprecedented livingness even after many chain extensions. The highest number of blocks synthesized in such a system is reported, demonstrating the capabilities of this automated platform for the rapid synthesis and complex polymer structure formation.

         <title>Organotin(IV)&#8208;Decorated Graphene Quantum Dots as Dual Platform for Molecular Imaging and Treatment of Triple Negative Breast Cancer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The pharmacological activity of organotin(IV) complexes in cancer therapy is well recognized but their large applicability is hampered by their poor water solubility. Hence, carbon dots, in particular nitrogen&#8208;doped graphene quantum dots (NGQDs), may be a promising alternative for the efficient delivery of organotin(IV) compounds as they have a substantial aqueous solubility, a good chemical stability, and non&#8208;toxicity as well as a bright photoluminescence that make them ideal for theranostic applications against cancer. Two different multifunctional nanosystems have been synthesized and fully characterized based on two fragments of organotin&#8208;based cytotoxic compounds and 4&#8208;formylbenzoic acid (FBA), covalently grafted onto the NGQDs surface. Subsequently, an in vitro determination of the therapeutic and theranostic potential of the achieved multifunctional systems was carried out. The results showed a high cytotoxic potential of the NGQDs&#8208;FBA&#8208;Sn materials against breast cancer cell line (MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231) and a lower effect on a non&#8208;cancer cell line (kidney cells, HEK293T). Besides, thanks to their optical properties, the dots enabled their fluorescence molecular imaging in the cytoplasmatic region of the cells pointing towards a successful cellular uptake and a release of the metallodrug inside cancer cells (NGQDs&#8208;FBA&#8208;Sn).</dc:description>

         <title>Functional Molecular Crystals from the Arylation of a Halogenoplatinum Complex: Stimuli&#8208;Responsiveness, Comproportionation, and &#960;&#8208;Bridged Dimerization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A chloroplatinum complex was arylated to obtain stimuli&#8208;responsive molecular crystals. The resulting arylplatinum complex showed polymorph&#8208;dependent emission, mechano&#8208; and thermochromic luminescence as well as comproportionation and &#960;&#8208;bridged dimerization. Simple mixing of structurally similar arylplatinum complexes at room temperature resulted in transfer of their aryl groups (comproportionation), which allowed tuning their mechanochromic profiles. We also found that recrystallization of the complex afforded a dimerized product in which two platinum ions are bridged via aryl groups resulting in a very short Pt&#8211;Pt distance (3.0466(10) &#197;).</dc:description>

         <title>In silico&#160;investigation of the thermochemistry and photoactivity of pyruvic acid in an aqueous solution of NaCl</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The photochemistry of oxo&#8208;carboxylic acids contributes significantly to the complex chemistry occurring in the atmosphere. In this regard, pyruvic acid undergoes photoreactions that lead to many diverse products. The presence of sodium cation near pyruvic acid in an aqueous solution, or its conjugate base in non&#8208;acidic conditions,&#160;influences the hydration equilibrium and the photosensitivity to UV&#8208;visible light of the oxocarboxylic acid. We performed an ab initio metadynamics simulation which serves two purposes: first, it unveils the mechanisms of the reversible hydration reaction between the keto and the diol forms, with a free&#8208;energy difference of only 2 kJ/mol at 300 K, which shows the influence of sodium on the keto/diol ratio; second, it provides solvent&#8208;shared ion pairing (SSIP) and contact ion pairing (CIP) structures, including Na+&#160;coordinated to carbonyl, for the calculations of the electronic transition energies to an antibonding &#960;* orbital, which sheds light on the photoactivity of these two forms in the actinic region.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Solution Phase Synthesis and Functionalization of 2D WSe2 for Ambient Stability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>2H phase tungsten diselenide (WSe2) is a p&#8208;type 2D semiconductor from the transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) family with unique opto&#8208;electrical properties. Solution phase production of atomically thin WSe2&#160;is challenging due to its instability under ambient conditions. We present a highly efficient and scalable solution method for simultaneously exfoliating and functionalizing&#160;WSe2&#160;by leveraging the noncovalent interaction between mercapto&#8208;group and bulk WSe2.&#160;Single and few&#8208;layer 2H phase pure WSe2&#160;sheets of lateral size up to 5&#160;&#181;m with minimal basal plane defects, as revealed by XPS, Raman and FTIR spectroscopy, are produced in water&#8208;ethanol mixture. Remarkably, WSe2&#160;dispersion remains stable even at high concentrations (10 mg/ml) and exhibited high colloidal stability with shelf&#8208;life exceeding a year. The findings from our study suggest that through precise manipulation of intercalation chemistry, mass production of solution processable phase&#8208;sensitive 2D materials such as WSe2&#160;can be achieved. This advancement holds great potential for facilitating their practical utilization in various real&#8208;world applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Gold(I)&#8208;Mediated Cyclizations of Triene&#8208;Yne Systems: An Easy Access to Cyclopenta&#8208;Fused Anthracenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel triene&#8208;yne systems with a benzofulvene moiety were prepared and applied in the field of gold catalysis. Cyclopenta&#8208;fused anthracenes were obtained under mild conditions and easy steps synthesis.







Abstract
The direct synthesis of cyclopenta&#8208;fused anthracenes (CP&#8208;anthracenes) through a gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed cyclization reaction of easily available triene&#8208;yne systems bearing a benzofulvene substructure, is reported. The targets are of great interest due to the potential use as organic materials and the preparation of these compounds is gaining huge importance. The applied starting materials are readily available through a three&#8208;step synthesis, which further contributes to the advantages of this route. In addition, UV&#8208;Vis and fluorescent spectra of the obtained CP&#8208;anthracenes were recorded.

         <title>Surface Chemistry and Specific Surface Area Rule the Efficiency of Gold Nanoparticle Sensitizers in Proton Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Radiosensitizer efficiency of gold nanoparticles from laser synthesis in liquids for proton therapy was tuned and factors maximizing the production of reactive oxygen species were identified. Here, I) high particle surface areas, II) the absence of surface ligands (citrate), III) alteration of surface chemistry for example higher defect densities were identified as main contributing factors.







Abstract
Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) are currently the most studied radiosensitizers in proton therapy (PT) applicable for the treatment of solid tumors, where they amplify production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, it is underexplored how this amplification is correlated with the AuNPs&#8217; surface chemistry. To clarify this issue, we fabricated ligand&#8208;free AuNPs of different mean diameters by laser ablation in liquids (LAL) and laser fragmentation in liquids (LFL) and irradiated them with clinically relevant proton fields by using water phantoms. ROS generation was monitored by the fluorescent dye 7&#8208;OH&#8208;coumarin. Our findings reveal an enhancement of ROS production driven by I) increased total particle surface area, II) utilization of ligand&#8208;free AuNPs avoiding sodium citrate as a radical quencher ligands, and III) a higher density of structural defects generated by LFL synthesis, indicated by surface charge density. Based on these findings it may be concluded that the surface chemistry is a major and underexplored contributor to ROS generation and sensitizing effects of AuNPs in PT. We further highlight the applicability of AuNPs in&#8197;vitro in human medulloblastoma cells.

         <title>Post&#8208;modification of Robust Covalent Organic Framework for Efficient Sequestration of 99TcO4&#8722;/ReO4&#8211;</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nuclear industry spent fuel reprocessing and some radioactive contamination sites often involve high acidity and salinity environments. Currently developed and reported sorbents in 99TcO4&#8211; sequestration from the nuclear waste are unstable and show low adsorption efficiency in harsh conditions. To address this issue, we developed a post&#8208;synthetic modification strategy by grafting imidazole&#8208;based ionic liquids (ILs) onto the backbone of covalent organic framework (COF) via vinyl polymerization. The resultant COF&#8208;polyILs sorbent exhibits fast adsorption kinetics (&lt; 5 min) and good sorption capacity (388 mg g&#8211;1) for ReO4&#8722; (a nonradioactive surrogate of 99TcO4&#8722;). Outstandingly, COF&#8208;polyILs composite shows superior ReO4&#8722; removal even under highly acidic conditions and in the presence of excess competing ions of Hanford low&#8208;level radioactive waste stream, benefiting from the stable covalent bonds between the COF and polyILs, mass of imidazole rings, and hydrophobic pores in COF.</dc:description>

         <title>Dearomatization of C6 Aromatic Hydrocarbons by Main Group Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The dearomatization reaction is a powerful method for transformation of simple aromatic compounds to unique chemical architectures rapidly in synthetic chemistry. Over the past decades, the chemistry in this field has evolved significantly and various important organic compounds such as crucial bioactive molecules have been synthesized through dearomatization. In general, photochemical conditions or assistance by transition metals are required for dearomatization of rigid arenes. Recently, main&#8208;group elements, especially naturally abundant elements in the Earth&#8217;s crust, have attracted attention as they have low toxicity and are cost&#8208;effective compared to the late transition metals. In recent decades, a variety of low&#8208;valent main&#8208;group molecules, which enable the activation of stable aromatic compounds under mild conditions, have been developed. This minireview highlights the developments in the chemistry of dearomatization of C6 aromatic hydrocarbons by main&#8208;group compounds leading to the formation of seven&#8208;membered EC6 (E = main&#8208;group elements) ring or cycloaddition products.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective and Stepwise Functionalization of the Pyridazine Scaffold by using Thio&#8208;substituted Pyridazine Building Blocks</title>

         <dc:description>We described a regioselective tri&#8208; and tetra&#8208;functionalization of the pyridazine scaffold using two readily available building blocks: 3&#8208;alkylthio&#8208;6&#8208;chloropyridazine and 3,4&#8208;bis(methylthio)&#8208;6&#8208;chloropyridazine by performing selective metalations with TMPMgCl&#183;LiCl and catalyst&#8208;tuned cross&#8208;coupling reactions with arylzinc halides. Several of the resulting pyridazines were converted into more elaborated N&#8208;heterocycles such as thieno[2,3&#8208;c]pyridazines and 1H&#8208;pyrazolo[3,4&#8208;c]pyridazines.</dc:description>

         <title>Boron Polycation Supported by Cyclic Bis(carbodiphosphorane)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel cyclic bis(carbodiphosphorane) ligand was prepared and investigated in coordination with group 13 elements, B, Al and Ga. Al and Ga afforded dinuclear adduct where two metal centers were bridged by the bis(carbodiphosphorane) ligand. In contrast, the reaction with boron trichloride afforded a monomeric dicationic three&#8208;coordinate boron species composed of one boron moieties and one ligand. The structures of these products were determined by X&#8208;ray crystallography. In the dicationic boron compound, the sterically constrained cyclic structure enforced the boron center to acquire strained trigonal geometry with wide C&#8208;B&#8208;C angle of 140&#176;.&#160; Furthermore, theoretical investigation with DFT and NBO suggested a significant contribution of tricationic two&#8208;coordinate boron resonance structure supported by two CDP ligands.</dc:description>

         <title>Advances in RNA Labeling with Trifluoromethyl Groups</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorine labeling of ribonucleic acids&#160;in conjunction with 19F&#8208;NMR spectroscopy has emerged as a powerful strategy for spectroscopic analysis of RNA structure and dynamics, and RNA&#8211; ligand interactions. Here, we present the first syntheses of 2'&#8208;OCF3 guanosine and uridine phosphoramidites, their incorporation into oligoribonucleotides by solid&#8208;phase synthesis and a comprehensive study of their properties. NMR spectroscopic analysis showed that the 2'&#8208;OCF3 modification is associated with preferential C2'&#8208;endo conformation of the U and G ribose in single&#8208;stranded RNA. When paired to the complementary strand, slight destabilization of the duplex caused by the modification was revealed by UV melting curve analysis. Moreover, we demonstrate the power of the 2'&#8208;OCF3 label for NMR spectroscopy by dissecting RNA pseudoknot folding and its binding to a small molecule.&#160;Furthermore, the 2'&#8208;OCF3 modification has potential for applications in therapeutic oligonucleotides. To this end, we tested 2'&#8208;OCF3 modified siRNAs in silencing of the BASP1 gene which indicated enhanced performance. Importantly, together with our earlier work, the present study completes the set of 2'&#8208;OCF3 nucleoside phosphoramidites to all four standard nucleobases and hence enables applications that utilize the favorable properties of the 2'&#8208;OCF3 group without any restrictions in placing the modification into the RNA target sequence.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The synthesis of [n]cycloparaphenylenes ([n]CPPs) and similar nanohoops is usually based on the combination of building blocks to a macrocyclic precursor, which is then aromatized in the final step. Access to those building blocks in large amounts will simplify the synthesis and studies of CPPs as novel functional materials in applications. Herein, we report a continuous flow synthesis of key CPP building blocks using versatile synthesis techniques such as electrochemical oxidation, lithiations and Suzuki cross couplings in self&#8208;built reactors on up&#8208;to kilogram scale.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis, Characterisation, and Functionalisation of Charged Two&#8208;Dimensional MoS2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The applications of exfoliated MoS2 are limited by its inert surface and poor interface. We have activated the surface of exfoliated 2H&#8208;MoS2 by reacting it with NaBH4, forming an n&#8208;doped material as demonstrated by a negative zeta&#8208;potential value &#950; = &#8208;25 mV and a 20 nm (0.05 eV) red&#8208;shift in its photoluminescence spectrum. The novel material&#8217;s spectral properties were consistent with pristine 2H&#8208;MoS2 (as determined by HR&#8208;TEM, XPS, pXRD, DRIFT, TGA, and Raman spectroscopy). Importantly, it was readily dispersed in H2O unlike 2H&#8208;MoS2. Its dispersibility properties were explored for a variety of solvents and could be directly correlated with the relative permittivity of the respective solvents. The charged 2H&#8208;MoS2 reacted readily with an organo&#8208;iodide to deliver functionalized 2H&#8208;MoS2. Our approach delivers aqueous dispersions of semiconducting 2H&#8208;MoS2, without additives or chemical functionalities, and allows for controlled and facile functionalization of 2H&#8208;MoS2 opening multiple new avenues of semi&#8208;conducting MoS2 application.</dc:description>

         <title>A Metallabicycle From Thiocarbonyl&#8208;Cyclopropenium Coupling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel architecture with no organic isolobal analogue, the bicyclic 3&#8208;mercaptopyrylium rhodium complexes, [Rh(&#954;2&#8208;C,S&#8208;C5S2Ph3)X2(PPh3)2] (X=Cl, Br), arise from thiocarbonyl&#8208;cyclopropenium coupling.







Abstract
Addition of triphenylcyclopropenium bromide to the thiocarbonyl complex [RhCl(CS)(PPh3)2] affords novel bicyclic metalla&#8208;3&#8208;mercapto&#8208;thiapyrylliums [Rh(&#954;2&#8208;C,S&#8208;C5S2Ph3)(PPh3)2X2] (X=Cl, Br) &#8211; heterocycles with no metal&#8208;free isolobal precedent. Halide abstraction with silver triflate (AgOTf) in acetonitrile affords the salt [Rh(&#954;2&#8208;C,S&#8208;C5S2Ph3)(NCMe)2(PPh3)2{Ag(OH2)2}{Ag(OTf)3}]&#8208;OTf which in turn reacts with sodium chloride to return [Rh(&#954;2&#8208;C,S&#8208;C5S2Ph3)(PPh3)2Cl2].

         <title>The Oxidation of Oxygen and Sulfur&#8208;Containing Heterocycles by Cytochrome P450 Enzymes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thiophene/Furan metabolization: A model cytochrome P450 enzyme was used to demonstrate that thiophene substrates were oxidized via sulfoxidation before activation towards Diels&#8211;Alder dimerization. Replacing the thiophene ring with a furan resulted in oxidative ring opening to a hydroxybutanoyl derivative, using a whole&#8208;cell system, and this reaction was demonstrated to proceed via a reactive &#947;&#8208;keto&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehyde species.







Abstract
The cytochrome P450 (CYP) superfamily of monooxygenase enzymes play important roles in the metabolism of molecules which contain heterocyclic, aromatic functional groups. Here we study how oxygen&#8208; and sulfur&#8208;containing heterocyclic groups interact with and are oxidized using the bacterial enzyme CYP199A4. This enzyme oxidized both 4&#8208;(thiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)benzoic acid and 4&#8208;(thiophen&#8208;3&#8208;yl)benzoic acid almost exclusively via sulfoxidation. The thiophene oxides produced were activated towards Diels&#8208;Alder dimerization after sulfoxidation, forming dimeric metabolites. Despite X&#8208;ray crystal structures demonstrating that the aromatic carbon atoms of the thiophene ring were located closer to the heme than the sulfur, sulfoxidation was still favoured with 4&#8208;(thiophen&#8208;3&#8208;yl)benzoic acid. These results highlight a preference of this cytochrome P450 enzyme for sulfoxidation over aromatic hydroxylation. Calculations predict a strong preference for homodimerization of the enantiomers of the thiophene oxides and the formation of a single major product, in broad agreement with the experimental data. 4&#8208;(Furan&#8208;2&#8208;yl)benzoic acid was oxidized to 4&#8208;(4&#8242;&#8208;hydroxybutanoyl)benzoic acid using a whole&#8208;cell system. This reaction proceeded via a &#947;&#8208;keto&#8208;&#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehyde species which could be trapped in&#8197;vitro using semicarbazide to generate a pyridazine species. The combination of the enzyme structures, the biochemical data and theoretical calculations provides detailed insight into the formation of the metabolites formed from these heterocyclic compounds.

         <title>In Situ Formation of CoP/Co3O4 Heterojunction for Efficient Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A CoP/Co3O4@TM (TM=titanium mesh) heterojunction exhibits excellent electrocatalytic performance for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and overall water splitting. OER requires an overpotential of 257&#8197;mV to reach 20&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and can work stably for more than 40&#8197;h, HER requires an overpotential of 98&#8197;mV to reach 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and overall water splitting only needs 1.590&#8197;V to reach 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
Electrochemical water splitting is an environmentally friendly and effective energy storage method. However, it is still a huge challenge to prepare non&#8208;noble metal based electrocatalysts that possess high activity and long&#8208;term durability to realize efficient water splitting. Here, we present a novel method of low&#8208;temperature phosphating for preparing CoP/Co3O4 heterojunction nanowires catalyst on titanium mesh (TM) substrate that can be used for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and overall water splitting. CoP/Co3O4@TM heterojunction showed an excellent catalytic performance and long&#8208;term durability in 1.0&#8197;M KOH electrolyte. The overpotential of CoP/Co3O4@TM heterojunction was only 257&#8197;mV at 20&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 during the OER process, and it could work stably more than 40&#8197;h at 1.52&#8197;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (vs. RHE). During the HER process, the overpotential of CoP/Co3O4@TM heterojunction was only 98&#8197;mV at &#8722;10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. More importantly, when used as anodic and cathodic electrocatalyst, they achieved 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 1.59&#8197;V. The Faradaic efficiencies of OER and HER were 98.4&#8201;% and 99.4&#8201;%, respectively, outperforming Ru/Ir&#8208;based noble metal electrocatalysts and other non&#8208;noble metal electrocatalysts for overall water splitting.

         <title>Shape Transformation via Etching and Regrowth: A Systematic Study of Pd Nanocrystals with Different Shapes and Twin Structures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A systematic study was conducted to investigate the etching and regrowth behaviors of Pd nanocrystals, including single&#8208;crystal cubes bounded by {100} facets, single&#8208;crystal octahedra and tetrahedra enclosed by {111} facets; and multiple&#8208;twinned icosahedra covered by {111} facets and twin boundaries.







Abstract
This article describes a systematic study of the oxidative etching and regrowth behaviors of Pd nanocrystals, including single&#8208;crystal cubes bounded by {100} facets, single&#8208;crystal octahedra and tetrahedra enclosed by {111} facets; and multiple&#8208;twinned icosahedra covered by {111} facets and twin boundaries. During etching, Pd atoms are preferentially oxidized and removed from the corners regardless of the type of nanocrystal, and the resultant Pd2+ ions are then reduced back to elemental Pd. For cubes and icosahedra, the newly formed Pd atoms are deposited on the {100} facets and twin boundaries, respectively, due to their relatively higher energies. For octahedra and tetrahedra, the Pd atoms self&#8208;nucleate in the solution phase, followed by their growth into small particles. We can control the regrowth rate relative to etching rate by varying the concentration of HCl in the reaction solution. As the concentration of HCl is increased, 18&#8208;nm Pd cubes are transformed into octahedra of 23, 18, and 13&#8197;nm, respectively, in edge length. Due to the absence of regrowth, however, Pd octahedra are transformed into truncated octahedra, cuboctahedra, and spheres with decreasing sizes whereas Pd tetrahedra evolve into truncated tetrahedra and spheres. In contrast, Pd icosahedra with twin boundaries on the surface are converted to asymmetric icosahedra, flower&#8208;like icosahedra, and spheres. This work not only advances the understanding of etching and growth behaviors of metal nanocrystals with various shapes and twin structures but also offers an alternative method for controlling their shape and size.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Site Metal Catalysts for Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synergistic effect of bimetallic catalytic sites and recent developments of dual&#8208;site metal catalysts (DSMCs) in the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) are presented. This Review includes a description and generalization of the classification of DSMCs used for CO2RR according to the form of metal existence; a detailed analysis of the mechanisms and importance of synergy in enhancing electrocatalytic properties for CO2RR.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is a promising and green approach for reducing atmospheric CO2 concentration and achieving high&#8208;valued conversion of CO2 under the carbon&#8208;neutral policy. In CO2RR, the dual&#8208;site metal catalysts (DSMCs) have received wide attention for their ingenious design strategies, abundant active sites, and excellent catalytic performance attributed to the synergistic effect between dual&#8208;site in terms of activity, selectivity and stability, which plays a key role in catalytic reactions. This review provides a systematic summary and detailed classification of DSMCs for CO2RR, describes the mechanism of synergistic effects in catalytic reactions, and also introduces in&#8197;situ characterization techniques commonly used in CO2RR. Finally, the main challenges and prospects of dual&#8208;site metal catalysts and even multi&#8208;site catalysts for CO2 recycling are analyzed. It is believed that based on the understanding of bimetallic site catalysts and synergistic effects in CO2RR, well&#8208;designed high&#8208;performance, low&#8208;cost electrocatalysts are promising for achieving CO2 conversion, electrochemical energy conversion and storage in the future.

This Review includes a description and generalization of the classification of DSMCs used for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR according to the form of metal existence; a detailed analysis of the mechanisms and importance of synergy in enhancing electrocatalytic properties for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electrocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction reaction (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR) is a promising and green approach for reducing atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration and achieving high-valued conversion of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; under the carbon-neutral policy. In CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR, the dual-site metal catalysts (DSMCs) have received wide attention for their ingenious design strategies, abundant active sites, and excellent catalytic performance attributed to the synergistic effect between dual-site in terms of activity, selectivity and stability, which plays a key role in catalytic reactions. This review provides a systematic summary and detailed classification of DSMCs for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR, describes the mechanism of synergistic effects in catalytic reactions, and also introduces in&#8197;situ characterization techniques commonly used in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR. Finally, the main challenges and prospects of dual-site metal catalysts and even multi-site catalysts for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; recycling are analyzed. It is believed that based on the understanding of bimetallic site catalysts and synergistic effects in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR, well-designed high-performance, low-cost electrocatalysts are promising for achieving CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; conversion, electrochemical energy conversion and storage in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Tropane Scaffolds by an Organocatalyzed 1,3&#8208;Dipolar Cycloaddition of 3&#8208;Oxidopyridinium Betaines and Dienamines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organocatalyzed (5+2) cycloaddition of 3&#8208;oxidopyridinium betaines and dienamines is presented. The protocol allows for the enantioselective construction of functionalized tropane scaffolds in up to &gt;99&#8201;%&#8201;ee and up to quantitative yield. DFT calculations propose a stepwise mechanism in which multiple cycloaddition pathways are possible, but the reversibility of diverging routes renders the reaction fully periselective.







Abstract
Tropane alkaloids constitute a compound&#8208;class which is structurally defined by a central 8&#8208;azabicyclo[3.2.1]octane core. A diverse bioactivity profile combined with an unusual aza&#8208;bridged bicyclic framework has made tropanes molecules&#8208;of&#8208;interest within organic chemistry. Enantioselective examples of (5+2) cycloadditions between 3&#8208;oxidopyridinium betaines and olefins remain unexplored, despite 3&#8208;oxidopyridinium betaines being useful reagents in organic synthesis. The first asymmetric (5+2) cycloaddition of 3&#8208;oxidopyridinium betaines is reported, affording tropane derivatives in up to quantitative yield and with excellent control of peri&#8208;, regio&#8208;, diastereo&#8208;, and enantioselectivity. The reactivity is enabled by dienamine&#8208;activation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes combined with in&#8197;situ formation of the pyridinium reaction&#8208;partner. A simple N&#8208;deprotection protocol allows for liberation of the tropane alkaloid motif, and synthetic elaborations of the cycloadducts demonstrate their synthetic utility to achieve highly diastereoselective modification around the bicyclic framework. DFT computations suggest a stepwise mechanism where regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity are defined during the first bond&#8208;forming step in which the pyridinium dipole exerts critical conformational control over its dienamine partner. In the second bond&#8208;forming step, a kinetic preference toward an initial (5+4) cycloadduct was identified; however, a lack of catalyst turn&#8208;over, reversibility, and thermodynamic bias favoring a (5+2) cycloadduct rendered the reaction fully periselective.

         <title>Water&#8208;Dispersible Carbon Nano&#8208;Test Tubes as a Container for Concentrated DNA Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon nano&#8208;test tubes whose inner surfaces were selectively oxidized work well as a nano&#8208;container for concentrated DNA molecules. The Ca2+&#8208;mediated electrostatic interaction is exerted between DNA phosphate groups and the carboxylate anions formed on the inner carbon surface and the interaction attracts DNA molecules to the inner space so as to make the total net charge of DNA equal to the charge of the carboxylate anions.







Abstract
Water&#8208;dispersible carbon nano&#8208;test tubes (CNTTs) with an inner and outer diameter of about 25 and 35&#8197;nm, respectively, were prepared by the template technique and then their inner carbon surface was selectively oxidized to introduce carboxy groups. The adsorption behavior of DNA molecules on the oxidized CNTTs (Ox&#8208;CNTTs) was examined in the presence of Ca2+ cations. Many DNA molecules are attracted to the inner space of Ox&#8208;CNTTs based on the Ca2+&#8208;mediated electrostatic interaction between DNA phosphate groups and carboxylate anions on the inner carbon surface. Moreover, the total net charge of the DNA adsorbed was found to be equal to the total charge of the carboxylate anions. This selective adsorption into the interior of Ox&#8208;CNTTs can be explained from the fact that the electrostatic interaction onto the inner concave surface is much stronger than that on the outer convex surface. On the other hand, the desorption of DNA easily occurs whenever Ca2+ cations are removed by washing with deionized water. Thus, each of Ox&#8208;CNTTs works well as a nano&#8208;container for a large amount of DNA molecules, thereby resulting in the occurrence of DNA enrichment in the nanospace.

         <title>Photocaging of Carboxylic Function Bearing Biomolecules by New Thiazole Derived Fluorophore</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The design and synthesis of a new fluorophore containing an arylidene thiazole scaffold resulted in a compound with good photophysical characteristics. Furthermore, the thiazole C5&#8208;methyl group was easily modified into specific functional groups (CH2Br and CH2OH) for the formation of a series of photocourier molecules containing model compounds (benzoic acids), as well as prodrugs, including salicylic acid, caffeic acid, and chlorambucil via a &#8220;benzyl&#8221; linker. Spectral characteristics (1&#1053;, 13&#1057; NMR, and high&#8208;resolution mass spectra) corresponded to the proposed structures. The photocourier molecules demonstrated absorption with high values of coefficient of molar extinction, exhibited contrasting green emission, and showed good dark stability. The mechanism of the photorelease was investigated through spectral analysis, HPLV&#8208;HRMS, and supported by TD&#8208;DFT calculations. The photoheterolysis and elimination of carboxylic acids were proved to occur in the excited state, yielding a carbocation as an intermediate moiety. The fluorophore structure provided stability to the carbocation through the delocalization of the positive charge via resonance structures. Viability assessment of Vero cells using the MTT&#8208;test confirmed the weak cytotoxicity of prodrugs without irradiation and it increase upon UV&#8208;light.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Transition metal&#8208;doped two&#8208;dimensional (2D) semiconductor nanoplatelets (NPLs) with atomically precise thickness have attracted much research interest due to their inherent photo&#8208;physical properties. In this work, we have synthesized 2D Cu&#8208;doped CdS NPLs, investigated the charge transfer dynamics using ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy, and fabricated an efficient photodetector device. A large Stoke&#8217;s shifted emission at ~685 nm with an average lifetime of about ~1.45 &#181;s is observed in Cu&#8208;doped CdS NPLs.&#160; Slower bleach recovery kinetics leads to large charge carrier separation in Cu&#8208;doped NPLs which is beneficial for photodetector applications. Cu&#8208;doped NPLs&#8208;based photodetectors exhibit high photocurrent, fast response (~120 ms), ~600 times higher photoresponsivity, and ~300 times higher detectivity (~4.1&#215;1013 Jones) than undoped CdS NPLs. These excellent properties of Cu&#8208;doped CdS NPLs make this material an efficient alternative for next&#8208;generation optoelectronic devices.</dc:description>

         <title>An Iron Macrocyclic Complex Containing Four &#8220;Hybrid&#8221; Pyridinium Amidate/Amidate N&#8208;Donors as a Catalyst for Oxidations With Hydrogen Peroxide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The macrocyclic pro&#8208;ligand [H4L][OTf]2, which contains four carboxamide functions and two conjugated pyridinium groups, is easily deprotonated by the weak base sodium acetate to give the corresponding neutral pro&#8208;ligand [H2L]. Metalation of [H2L] with iron(II) chloride proceeds rapidly to form the macrocyclic complex, [FeIIICl(L)]. This is an effective catalyst for the oxidation of the organic dye orange II by hydrogen peroxide in aqueous solution and the kinetic parameters for this reaction have been determined. In striking contrast to an analogous iron&#8208;TAML complex that contains two phenyl groups in place of the two pyridinium groups, [FeIIICl(L)] is a very active oxidation catalyst at pH 7 and is also highly stable towards acid promoted demetallation at pH 5 or above. The results show that the two pyridinium groups bring greatly enhanced catalytic properties to [FeIIICl(L)].</dc:description>

         <title>Dehydropolymerization of Amine&#8208;Boranes using Bis(imino)pyridine Rhodium Pre&#8208;Catalysis: &#963;&#8208;Amine&#8208;Borane Complexes, Nanoparticles, and&#160;Low Residual&#8208;Metal BN&#8208;Polymers that can be Chemically Repurposed</title>

         <dc:description>The sigma amine&#8208;borane complexes [Rh(L1)(h2:h2H3B&#183;NRH2)][OTf] (L1 = 2,6&#8208;bis&#8208;[1&#8208;(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenylimino)ethyl]pyridine, R = Me, Et, nPr) are described, alongside [Rh(L1)(NMeH2)][OTf]. Using R = Me as the pre&#8208;catalyst (1 mol%) the dehydropolymerization of H3B&#183;NMeH2 gives [H2BNMeH]n selectively. Added NMeH2, or the direct use of [Rh(L1)(NMeH2)][OTf], is required for initiation of catalysis, which is suggested to operate through formation of a neutral hydride complex, Rh(L1)H. The formation of small (1&#8208;5 nm) nanoparticles is observed during catalysis, but studies are ambiguous as to whether the catalysis is solely nanoparticle promoted or if there is a molecular homogeneous component. [Rh(L1)(NMeH2)][OTf] is shown to operate at 0.025 mol% loadings on a 2 g scale to give polyaminoborane [H2BNMeH]n [Mn = 30,900 g/mol, &#208; = 1.8] that can be purified to a low residual [Rh] (6 &#181;g/g). Addition of Na[N(SiMe3)2] to [H2BNMeH]n results in selective depolymerization to form the eee&#8208;isomer of N,N,N&#8208;trimethylborazane [H2BNMeH]3: the chemical repurposing of a main&#8208;group polymer.</dc:description>

         <title>2,4,5,7&#8208;Tetranitrofluorenone Oximate for the Naked&#8208;Eye Detection of H&#8208;Bond Donors and the Chiroptical Sensing of Enantiopure Reagents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogen bonding greatly influences rates and equilibrium positions of chemical reactions, conformations, and sometimes even stereochemistry. Herein, we report on tetranitrofluorenone oximate, a novel dye capable of naked&#8208;eye detection of hydrogen&#8208;bond donating species (HBDs) and of rapid determination of H&#8208;bond donation strength by hypsochromic shift monitoring. In addition, the molecule possesses atropisomeric conformations, of M and P configuration, as evidenced in solid and solution state studies by X&#8208;ray diffraction and electronic circular dichroism (ECD), respectively. In the latter case, enantiopure bis&#8208;thioureas were the most effective HBDs to promote a chiral induction (diastereoselective recognition, Pfeiffer effect); the ECD results being rationalized by time&#8208;dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) calculations. Based on these experiments, bis&#8208;thioureas were used as chiral reagents in asymmetric 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloadditions of structurally&#8208;related nitrones; the ECD sensing of the stereoinduction between bis&#8208;thioureas and the oximate serving as an indirect method of selection of the most effective HBD for asymmetric synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>2&#8208;Benzamide Tellurenyl Iodides: Synthesis and Their Catalytic Role in CO2 Mitigation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Insertion of tellurium into carbon&#8208;iodine bond has been achieved for the first time by a base&#8208;free copper&#8208;catalyzed method for the construction of aryl 2&#8208;benzamide tellurenyl iodides. Furthermore, synthesized tellurenyl iodides were explored for CO2 mitigation to synthesize cyclic carbonates and 1,3&#8208;diaryl ureas, using epoxides and anilines, respectively. In addition, for the first time, the ebtellur intermediate is isolated and characterized by SC&#8208;XRD.







Abstract
Benzamide&#8208;derived organochalcogens (chalcogen=S, Se, and Te) have shown promising interest in biological and synthetic chemistry. Ebselen molecule derived from benzamide moiety is the most studied organoselenium. However, its heavier congener organotellurium is under&#8208;explored. Here, an efficient copper&#8208;catalyzed atom economical synthetic method has been developed to synthesize 2&#8208;phenyl&#8208;benzamide tellurenyl iodides by inserting a tellurium atom into carbon&#8208;iodine bond of 2&#8208;iodobenzamides in one pot with 78&#8211;95&#8201;% yields.

In addition, 2&#8208;iodo&#8208;N&#8208;(quinolin&#8208;8&#8208;yl)benzamide tellurenyl iodides have also been used as pre&#8208;catalyst for activating anilines and CO2 to form a variety of 1,3&#8208;diaryl ureas up to 95&#8201;% yield. The mechanistic investigation for CO2 mitigation is done by 125Te&#8197;NMR and HRMS studies.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Insertion of tellurium&lt;/b&gt; into carbon-iodine bond has been achieved for the first time by a base-free copper-catalyzed method for the construction of aryl 2-benzamide tellurenyl iodides. Furthermore, synthesized tellurenyl iodides were explored for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; mitigation to synthesize cyclic carbonates and 1,3-diaryl ureas, using epoxides and anilines, respectively. In addition, for the first time, the ebtellur intermediate is isolated and characterized by SC-XRD.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Benzamide-derived organochalcogens (chalcogen=S, Se, and Te) have shown promising interest in biological and synthetic chemistry. Ebselen molecule derived from benzamide moiety is the most studied organoselenium. However, its heavier congener organotellurium is under-explored. Here, an efficient copper-catalyzed atom economical synthetic method has been developed to synthesize 2-phenyl-benzamide tellurenyl iodides by inserting a tellurium atom into carbon-iodine bond of 2-iodobenzamides in one pot with 78&#8211;95&#8201;% yields. Further, the Lewis acidic nature of Te center and Lewis basic nature of nitrogen of the synthesized 2-Iodo-&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-(quinolin-8-yl)benzamide tellurenyl iodides enabled them as pre-catalyst for the activation of epoxide with CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; at 1&#8197;atm for the preparation of cyclic carbonates with TOF and TON values of 1447&#8197;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and 4343, respectively, under solvent-free conditions. In addition, 2-iodo-&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-(quinolin-8-yl)benzamide tellurenyl iodides have also been used as pre-catalyst for activating anilines and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to form a variety of 1,3-diaryl ureas up to 95&#8201;% yield. The mechanistic investigation for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; mitigation is done by &lt;sup&gt;125&lt;/sup&gt;Te&#8197;NMR and HRMS studies. It seems that the reaction proceeds via formation of catalytically active Te&#8722;N heterocycle, an ebtellur intermediate which is isolated and structurally characterized.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Infrared Spectroscopic and Theoretical Investigations of Group 13 Oxyfluorides OMF2 and OMF (M=B, Al, Ga, In)</title>

         <dc:description>
Terminal oxygen radicals involving group 13&#8201;atoms: We investigate herein oxydifluoride OMF2 (M=B, Al, Ga and In) radicals by the reactions of laser&#8208;ablated group 13 atoms with OF2 under cryogenic conditions in solid noble gas matrices. The computed molecular orbitals and spin densities showed that the unpaired electron is mainly located at the terminal oxygen atom.







Abstract
Group 13 oxyfluorides OMF2 were produced by the reactions of laser&#8208;ablated group 13 atoms M (M=B, Al, Ga and In) with OF2 and isolated in excess neon or argon matrices at 5&#8197;K. These molecules were characterized by matrix&#8208;isolation infrared spectroscopy and isotopic substitution experiments in conjunction with quantum&#8208;chemical calculations. The calculations indicate that the OMF2 molecules have a 2B2 ground state with C2v symmetry. The computed molecular orbitals and spin densities show that the unpaired electron is mainly located at the terminal oxygen atom. Oxo monofluorides OMF were only observed in solid argon matrices and exhibit a linear structure in the singlet ground state. The M&#8722;O bonding in the OMF molecules can be rationalized as highly polar multiple bonds based on the calculated bond lengths and natural resonance theory (NRT) analyses. In particular, the molecular orbitals of OBF exhibit the character of a triple bond B&#8722;O resulting from two degenerate electron&#8208;sharing &#960; bonds and an O&#8594;B dative &#963; bond formed by the oxygen 2p lone pair which donates electron density to the boron empty 2p orbital.

         <title>Oriented External Electric&#8208;Field Effects on the Activation of Aryl CO Bond in Anisole using Rh(PEP) (E=Al, B, Ga) Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quantum chemical calculations with density functional theory (DFT) demonstrate the effect of Oriented External Electric Field (OEEF) on the heterolytic activation reactions of the C(sp2)&#8722;O bond in aryl ether compounds, such as anisole, catalysed by Rh&#8722;E (E= Al/B/Ga) complexes. New Rh&#8722;E catalyst complexes with improved activity has also been proposed.







Abstract
The present work reports a DFT&#8208;based mechanistic investigation of aryl C&#8722;O bond activation in anisole catalysed by a Rh&#8722;Al pincer&#8208;type complex at room temperature. The study is extended to analogues Rh&#8722;E complexes based on Group&#8197;13 elements (E=B/Ga). Our results show a preference for the heterolytic cleavage pathway over oxidative addition in the C&#8722;O bond activation. The calculated barriers range from 16 to 36&#8197;kcal/mol, following the order: E=Al&lt;E=Ga&lt;E=B. A strong correlation between the activation barriers and the local electric field (LEF) at the Rh metal centre for the studied Rh&#8722;E complexes was observed. Additionally, the ability of Oriented External Electric Field (OEEF) to lower the reaction barrier by applying the OEEF along the direction of electron reorganization, that is, &#8220;the reaction axis&#8221;, was examined. Our results demonstrate the significant effect of applied OEEF on the aryl C&#8722;O bond activation in Rh&#8722;E systems. Furthermore, the effect of OEEF on the C&#8722;O bond activation using modified Rh&#8722;E (E=B, Al, or Ga) complexes, in which electronic structure modifications enable a more efficient barrier control by the OEEF, was showcased. Notably, applying a moderate field strength reduces the high reaction barrier for the Rh&#8722;B system by approximately 13&#8197;kcal/mol.

Meanwhile, a series of corresponding linear cyanido&#8208;bridged pentanuclear compounds [MenCp(dppe)FeIII&#8208;(&#956;&#8208;NC)&#8208;RuII(MeOpy)4&#8208;(&#956;&#8208;NC)&#8208;AgI&#8208;(&#956;&#8208;CN)&#8208;RuII(MeOpy)4&#8208;(&#956;&#8208;CN)&#8208;FeIII(dppe)CpMen][BF4]5 (M[BF4]5, n = 0, M = 4; n = 1, M = 5; n = 3, M = 6) were also obtained and well characterized.

In both the trinuclear N4+ and the pentanuclear M5+ complexes, there exists the neighboring RuII &#8594; FeIII MM'CT transitions, and the MM&#8217;CT energy in the corresponding trinuclear system is higher than those in the pentanuclear system in which no remote metal&#8208;metal interaction occurs. Meanwhile, as the substituted methyl groups on the cyclopentadiene increases, the redox potential of the ruthenium in the trinuclear N4+series increases, but that in the pentanuclear M5+ complexes decreases.</dc:description>

         <title>Tunable Fluorescence and Morphology of Aggregates Built from a Mechanically Bonded Amphiphilic Bistable [2]Rotaxane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mechanically bonded amphiphiles (MBAs), also known as mechanically interlocked molecules (MIMs), have emerged as an important kind of functional building block for the construction of artificial molecular machines and soft materials. Herein, a novel MBA, i.e., bistable [2]rotaxane H2 was designed and synthesized. In the solution state, H2 demonstrated pH and metal ion&#8208;responsive emissions due to the presence of a distance&#8208;dependent photoinduced electron transfer (PET) process and the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) process, respectively. Importantly, the amphiphilic feature of H2 has endowed it with unique self&#8208;assembly capability, and nanospheres were obtained in a mixed H2O/CH3CN solvent. Moreover, the morphology of H2 aggregates can be tuned from nanospheres to vesicles due to the pH&#8208;controlled shuttling motion&#8208;induced alternation of H2 amphiphilicity. Interestingly, larger spheres with novel pearl&#8208;chain&#8208;like structures from H2 were observed after adding stoichiometric Zn2+. In particular, H2 shows pH&#8208;responsive emissions in its aggregation state, allowing the visualization of the shuttling movement by just naked eyes. It is assumed that the well&#8208;designed [2]rotaxane, and particularly the proposed concept of MBA shown here, will further enrich the families of MIMs, offering prospects for synthesizing more MIMs with novel assembly capabilities and bottom&#8208;up building dynamic smart materials with unprecedented functions.</dc:description>

         <title>Schlenk&#8208;type Equilibria of Grignard&#8208;analogous Arylberyllium Complexes: Steric Effects</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The presence of complex Schlenk equilibria is a central property of synthetically invaluable Grignard reagents substantially affecting their reactivity and selectivity in chemical transformations. In this work, we systematically studied the steric effects of aryl substituents on the Schlenk&#8208;type equilibria of their lighter congeners, arylberyllium bromides. Combination of diarylberyllium complexes Ar2Be(OEt2) (1Ar, Ar = Tip, Tcpp; Tip = 2,4,6&#8208;iPr3C6H3, Tcpp = 2,4,6&#8208;Cyp3C6H3, Cyp = c&#8208;C5H9), containing sterically demanding aryl groups, and BeBr2(OEt2)2 (2) affords the Grignard&#8208;analogous arylberyllium bromides ArBeBr(OEt2) (3Ar, Ar = Tip, Tcpp). In contrast, Mes2Be(OEt2) (1Mes, Mes = 2,4,6&#8208;Me3C6H3) and 2 exist in a temperature&#8208;dependent equilibrium with MesBeBr(OEt2) (3Mes) and free OEt2. Ph2Be(OEt2) (1Ph) reacts with 2 to afford dimeric [PhBeBr(OEt2)]2 ([3Ph]2). Moreover, the influence of replacing the OEt2 donor by an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene, IPr2Me2 (IPr2Me2 = C(iPrNCMe)2), on the redistribution reactions was investigated. The solution&#8208; and solid&#8208;state structures of the diarylberyllium and arylberyllium bromide complexes were comprehensively characterized using multinuclear (1H, 9Be, 13C) NMR spectroscopic methods and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, while DFT calculations were employed to support the experimental findings.</dc:description>

         <title>An Acid&#8208;Controlled Method for the Regioselective Functionalization of Anilines over Aliphatic Amines</title>

         <dc:description>Regioselective transformations at similar functional groups is of paramount importance in organic synthesis. Traditional strategies towards regioselective functionalization include serial protection/deprotection and sequential synthesis. Modern organic synthesis emphasizes pathway efficiency and protecting group free routes with a goal of exploiting inherent differences in reactivity. Here we report a method for the regioselective functionalization of anilines over aliphatic amines. Utilizing classic conditions for the Baeyer&#8211;Mills reaction, we were able to show that anilines will react preferentially in the presence of aliphatic amines. Subsequently, we illustrate how this principle of reactivity can be extended to other electrophiles and conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Interaction between the transferrin protein and plutonium (and thorium), what&#8217;s new?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transferrin (Tf) is a glycoprotein that transports iron from the serum to the various organs. Several studies have highlighted that Tf can interact with&#160;metals other than&#160;Fe(III), including actinides that are chemical and radiological toxics.&#160;We propose here to report on the behavior of Th(IV) and Pu(IV) in comparison with Fe(III) upon Tf complexation. We considered UV&#8208;Vis and IR data of the M2Tf complex (M = Fe, Th, Pu) and combined experimental EXAFS data with MD models. EXAFS data of the first M&#8208;O coordination sphere are consistent with the MD model considering 1 synergistic carbonate. Further EXAFS data analysis strongly suggests that contamination by Th/Pu colloids seems to occur upon Tf complexation, but it seems limited. SAXS data have also been recorded for all complexes and also after the addition of DFOB in the medium. The Rg values are very close for apoTf, ThTf and PuTf, but slightly larger than for holoTf. Data suggest that the structure of the protein is more ellipsoidal than spherical, with a flattened oblate form. From this data, the following order of conformation size might be considered : holoTf &lt; M2Tf (M = Th, Pu) &lt; apoTf &lt; M2Tf&#8208;DFOB (M = Fe, Th, Pu).</dc:description>

         <title>Design, Synthesis, and Evaluation of Biological Activity of Ferrocene&#8208;Ispinesib Hybrids: Impact of a Ferrocenyl Group on the Antiproliferative and Kinesin Spindle Protein Inhibitory Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ferrocenyl&#8208; and adamantyl&#8208;ispinesib hybrids showing significantly higher anticancer activity than ispinesib were designed. The presence of an ispinesb core is responsible for KSP inhibitory activity, whereas bulky ferrocenyl and adamantyl substituents are responsible for increased ability to ROS generation and significantly increased G2/M phase cell arrest of the new compounds.







Abstract
With the aim to combine more than one biologically&#8208;active component in a single molecule, derivatives of ispinesib and its (S) analogue were prepared that featured ferrocenyl moieties or bulky organic substituents. Inspired by the strong kinesin spindle protein (KSP) inhibitory activity of ispinesib, the compounds were investigated for their antiproliferative activity. Among these compounds, several derivatives demonstrated significantly higher antiproliferative activity than ispinesib with nanomolar IC50 values against cell lines. Further evaluation indicated that the antiproliferative activity is not directly correlated with their KSP inhibitory activity while docking suggested that several of the derivatives may bind in a manner similar to ispinesib. In order to investigate the mode of action further, cell cycle analysis and reactive oxygen species formation were investigated. The improved antiproliferative activity of the most active compounds may be assigned to synergic effects of various factors such as KSP inhibitory activity due to the ispinesib core and ability to generate ROS and induce mitotic arrest.

&lt;p&gt;With the aim to combine more than one biologically-active component in a single molecule, derivatives of ispinesib and its (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;) analogue were prepared that featured ferrocenyl moieties or bulky organic substituents. Inspired by the strong kinesin spindle protein (KSP) inhibitory activity of ispinesib, the compounds were investigated for their antiproliferative activity. Among these compounds, several derivatives demonstrated significantly higher antiproliferative activity than ispinesib with nanomolar IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values against cell lines. Further evaluation indicated that the antiproliferative activity is not directly correlated with their KSP inhibitory activity while docking suggested that several of the derivatives may bind in a manner similar to ispinesib. In order to investigate the mode of action further, cell cycle analysis and reactive oxygen species formation were investigated.

         <title>[(&#956;3&#8208;F)(BrF5)3]&#8722; &#8211; An Unprecedented Molecular Fluoridobromate(V) Anion in Cs[Br3F16]</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first fluoride&#8208;bridged oligonuclear Br(V) anion, [(&#956;3&#8208;F)(BrF5)3]&#8722;, has been obtained in the compound Cs[Br3F16]. The lone pairs on the Br atoms are shown to be stereochemically active, which has never been observed before for fluoridobromates(V) but only for fluoridoiodates(V).







Abstract
The reaction of Cs[BrF6] with BrF5 gave the compound Cs[Br3F16] with the unprecedented propeller&#8208;shaped, C3&#8208;symmetric [(&#956;3&#8208;F)(BrF5)3]&#8722; anion. All other currently known fluoridobromates(V) contain only octahedral [BrF6]&#8722; anions, which, unlike the related [IF6]&#8722; anions, never exhibited stereochemical activity of the lone pair on the Br atoms. Despite the same coordination number of six for the Br atom in the [BrF6]&#8722; and [(&#956;3&#8208;F)(BrF5)3]&#8722; anions, the longer &#956;3&#8208;F&#8722;Br bonds provide additional space, allowing the lone pairs on the Br atoms to become stereochemically active. Cs[Br3F16] was characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and quantum&#8208;chemical calculations for both the solid&#8208;state compound and the isolated anion at 0&#8197;K. Intrinsic bond orbital calculations show that the &#956;3&#8208;F&#8722;Br bond is essentially ionic in nature and also underpin the stereochemical activity of the lone pairs of the Br(V) atoms.

         <title>Manipulation of hierarchical chiral self&#8208;assembly and anion recognition by supramolecular systems of &#946;&#8208;glucopyranoside&#65292;Pillar[5]arenes, and Polyoxometalates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hierarchical chiral structures have broad applications in optical devices, asymmetric catalysis, and biological systems. The delicate balance of various interactions are key to the self&#8208;assembly of chiral structures. Herein, a ternary co&#8208;assembly consisting of cationic pillar[5]arenes (P5As), anionic &#946;&#8208;glucopyranoside (&#946;GlcD / &#946;GlcL), and Anderson&#8208;type polyoxometalates (POMs) were constructed. Through adjusting the stoichiometry of &#946;GlcD, the assemblies were effectively controlled to form hierarchical nano&#8208;leaf assemblies with twisted nanoribbons in a homochiral direction. The co&#8208;assemblies exhibit strong Cotton effects, and successfully induced the chirality of Anderson&#8208;type POMs. More interestingly, by changing the central metal in Anderson&#8208;type POMs (XMo6O243&#8208; (X = Cr, Al, and Ga)), even though the three clusters have the same numbers of charge and size, the hierarchical chirality of the related assemblies varied in the morphology of the assemblies and the Cotton effect in the CD spectra. Results in theoretical calculations and ITC titration indicates that the tiny difference in long&#8208;range electrostatic interaction would result in the anion recognition of POMs, modulated by &#946;GlcD through host&#8208;guest inclusion and hydrogen bonding in the assembly process.</dc:description>

         <title>Machine&#8208;Learning Aided NO2 Discrimination with an Array of Graphene Chemiresistors Covalently Functionalized by Diazonium Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Boosted by the emerging need for highly integrated gas sensors in IoT ecosystems, electronic noses (e&#8208;noses) are gaining interest for the detection of specific molecules over a background of interfering gases. The sensing of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is particularly relevant for applications in environmental monitoring and precision medicine. Here we present an easy and efficient functionalization procedure to covalently modify graphene layers, taking advantage of diazonium chemistry. Separate graphene layers were functionalised with one of three different aryl rings 4&#8208;nitrophenyl, 4&#8208;carboxyphenyl, and 4&#8208;bromophenyl). The distinct mod(ified graphene layers were assembled with a pristine layer into an e&#8208;nose for NO2 discrimination. A remarkable sensitivity to NO2 is demonstrated through exposures to gaseous solutions with NO2 concentrations in the 1&#8208;10 ppm range at room temperature. Then, the discrimination capability of the sensor array is tested by carrying out exposures to several interfering gases and analyzing the data through multivariate statistical analysis. This analysis shows that the e&#8208;nose can discriminate NO2 among all the interfering gases in a two&#8208;dimensional principal component analysis space. Finally, the e&#8208;nose is trained to accurately recognize NO2 contributions with a linear discriminant analysis approach, thus providing a metric for discrimination assessment with a prediction accuracy above 95%.</dc:description>

         <title>Reduced Tiara&#8208;like Palladium Complex for Suzuki Cross Coupling Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The design of highly active and structurally well&#8208;defined catalysts has become a crucial issue for heterogeneous catalysed reactions while reducing the amount of catalyst employed. Beside conventional synthetic routes, the employment of polynuclear transition metal complexes as catalysts or catalyst precursors has progressively intercepted a growing interest. These well&#8208;defined species promise to deliver catalytic systems where a strict control on the nuclearity allows to improve the catalytic performance while reducing the active phase loading. This study describes the development of a very active and reusable palladium&#8208;based catalyst on alumina (Pd8/Al2O3) for Suzuki cross coupling reactions. An octanuclear tiara&#8208;like palladium complex was selected as active phase precursor to give isolated Pd&#8208;clusters of ca. 1 nm in size on Al2O3. The catalyst was thoroughly characterised by several complementary techniques to assess its structural and chemical nature. The high specific activity of the catalyst has allowed to carry out the cross&#8208;coupling reaction in 30 minutes using only 0.12 mol% of Pd loading under very mild and green reaction conditions. Screening of various substrates and selectivity tests, combined with recycling and benchmarking experiments, have been used to highlight the great potentialities of this new Pd8/Al2O3 catalyst.</dc:description>

         <title>(Bio)Functionalisation of Metal&#8208;Organic Polyhedra via Click Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The surface chemistry of Metal&#8208;Organic Polyhedra (MOPs) is crucial to their physicochemical properties because it governs how they interact with external substances such as solvents, synthetic organic molecules, metal ions, and even biomolecules. Consequently, the advancement of synthetic methods that facilitate the incorporation of diverse functional groups onto MOP surfaces will significantly broaden the range of properties and potential applications for MOPs. Herein, we describe the use of copper(I)&#8208;catalysed, azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) click reactions to post&#8208;synthetically modify the surface of alkyne&#8208;functionalised cuboctahedral MOPs. To this end, we synthesised a novel Rh(II)&#8208;based MOP with 24&#160;available surface alkyne groups. We have demonstrated that each of the 24 alkyne groups on the surface of our &#8220;clickable&#8221; Rh&#8208;MOP can be reacted with azide&#8208;containing molecules at room temperature, without compromising the integrity of the MOP. We exploited the wide substrate catalogue and orthogonal nature of CuAAC click chemistry to densely functionalise MOPs with diverse functional groups, including polymers, carboxylic and phosphonic acids, and even biotin moieties, which retained their recognition capabilities once anchored onto the surface of the MOP.</dc:description>

         <title>The Role of Inverted Ligand Field in the Electronic Structure and Reactivity of Octahedral Formal Platinum (IV) Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Platinum complexes are ubiquitous in chemistry and largely used as catalysts or as precursors in drug chemistry, thus a deep knowledge of their electronic properties may help in planning new synthetic strategies or exploring new potential applications. Herein, the electronic structure of many octahedral platinum complexes is drastically revised especially when they feature electronegative elements such as halogens and chalcogens. The investigation revealed that in most cases the five d platinum orbitals are invariably full, thus the empty antibonding orbitals, usually localized on the metal, are mainly centered on the ligands, suggesting a questionable assignment of formal oxidation state IV. The analysis supports the occurrence of the Inverted Ligand Field theory in all cases with the only exceptions of the Pt&#8208;F and Pt&#8208;O bonding. The trends for the molecular complexes are mirrored also by the Density of States plots of extended structures featuring octahedral platinum moieties in association with chalcogens atoms. Finally, the oxidative addition of a Se&#8208;Cl linkage to a square platinum complex to achieve an octahedral moiety has been revised in the framework of the Inverted Ligand Field.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Platinum complexes are ubiquitous in chemistry and largely used as catalysts or as precursors in drug chemistry, thus a deep knowledge of their electronic properties may help in planning new synthetic strategies or exploring new potential applications. Herein, the electronic structure of many octahedral platinum complexes is drastically revised especially when they feature electronegative elements such as halogens and chalcogens. The investigation revealed that in most cases the five d platinum orbitals are invariably full, thus the empty antibonding orbitals, usually localized on the metal, are mainly centered on the ligands, suggesting a questionable assignment of formal oxidation state IV. The analysis supports the occurrence of the Inverted Ligand Field theory in all cases with the only exceptions of the Pt-F and Pt-O bonding. The trends for the molecular complexes are mirrored also by the Density of States plots of extended structures featuring octahedral platinum moieties in association with chalcogens atoms. Finally, the oxidative addition of a Se-Cl linkage to a square platinum complex to achieve an octahedral moiety has been revised in the framework of the Inverted Ligand Field.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>CO2 Activation with Manganese Tricarbonyl Complexes via an H&#8208;Atom Responsive Benzimidazole Ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report the synthesis and characterization of two manganese tricarbonyl complexes, MnI(HL)(CO)3Br (1a&#8208;Br) and MnI(MeL)(CO)3Br (1b&#8208;Br) (where HL = 2&#8208;(2&#8217;&#8208;pyridyl)benzimidazole; MeL = 1&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;(2&#8217;&#8208;pyridy)benzimidazole) and assayed their electrocatalytic properties for CO2 reduction. A redox&#8208;active pyridine benzimidazole ancillary ligand in complex 1a&#8208;Br displayed unique hydrogen atom transfer ability to facilitate electrocatalytic CO2 conversion at a markedly lower reduction potential than that observed for 1b&#8208;Br.&#160; Notably, a one&#8208;electron reduction of 1a&#8208;Br yields a structurally characterized H&#8208;bonded binuclear Mn(I) adduct (2a&#8217;) rather than the typically observed Mn(0)&#8208;Mn(0) dimer, suggesting a novel method for CO2 activation. Combining advanced electrochemical, spectroscopic, and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction techniques, we demonstrate the use of an H&#8208;atom responsive ligand may reveal an alternative, low&#8208;energy pathway for CO2 activation by an earth&#8208;abundant metal complex catalyst.</dc:description>

         <title>Post&#8208;Installation of Fused Benzoheptagons at the Periphery of NiII Porphyrins: Helical Structures and Conformation&#8208;Adjustable Fullerenes Binding</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fused&#8208;benzoheptagon&#8208;installed NiII porphyrins were synthesized by a protocol consisting of (2&#8208;formyl)arylation at the meso&#8208;position(s) of NiII porphyrins, conversion of formyl group to methoxyethene group by Wittig reaction, and final Bi(OTf)3&#8208;catalyzedcyclization. The structures of these porphyrins have been revealed by X&#8208;ray analysis. Owing to the installed heptagon ring(s), these porphyrins show curved structures with conformational flexibility. Dimer 9 has been shown to have a small activation barrier for inversion and to capture C60 and C70 with large association constants with adjustable conformational changes.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiroptical Recognition of Carboxylates with Charge&#8208;Neutral Double&#8208;Stranded Zinc(II) Helicates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chirality analysis of small molecules for the determination of their enantiopurity is nowadays ruled by streamlined chromatographic methods which utilize chiral stationary phases. Chiroptical probes which rely on host&#8208;guest interactions are so far overshadowed by the latter but have the benefit of depending only on common spectroscopic techniques such as CD spectroscopy to distinguish enantiomers and to quantify their ratio. Interest into this receptor&#8208;based approach is constantly rising because non&#8208;invasive high&#8208;throughput screenings with a minimal waste production can be performed. In this study we investigate the possibility to utilize metal&#8208;based containers in form of charge&#8208;neutral helicates able to recognize anions for this purpose. Key building block of the helicates are triazole units which show rotational freedom and give rise to either a meso&#8208;structure or a racemic mixture of the right&#8208; and left&#8208;handed complex. A chiroptical response of the probe is observed upon recognition of chiral mono&#8208; or dicarboxylates and chirality analysis of tartrate is conducted by CD spectroscopy.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Functionalized SWCNTs with a Dopamine Derivative as a Support for Pd Nanoparticles: A Recyclable Catalyst for the Reduction of Nitro Compounds and the Heck Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) were functionalized with a dopamine derivative in which the amine group was converted to azide (dopamine azide). The direct reaction of SWCNTs and dopamine azide in o&#8208;dichlorobenzene at high temperature (160 &#176;C) led to very highly functionalized CNTs (&#8776;60 wt%). Surprisingly, despite this high degree of functionalization, Raman spectroscopy detected a low disruption of the &#960;&#8208;network of the carbonaceous support. This finding was justified by the rehybridization from sp3 to sp2 of the sidewall carbon atoms of CNTs involved in the functionalization process. Further characterization by means of different techniques such as X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) allowed to shed some light on the chemical composition and morphology of the obtained material. Moreover, the estimation of the total content of phenolic units and their reducing potential after CNTs functionalization was also assessed using Folin and Ciocalteu and 2,2&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;1&#8208;picryl hydrazide (DPPH) assays. The functionalization of CNTs was exploited to immobilize palladium(II) species that were subsequently reduced with NaBH4 leading to the formation of Pd nanoparticles (NPs). The so obtained hybrid material was used as a recyclable heterogeneous catalyst for the reduction of nitro compounds and the Heck reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Erythronium Bonds: Noncovalent Interactions Involving Group 5 Elements as Electron Density Acceptors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Analyses of the Cambridge Structural Database and theoretical calculations (PBE0&#8208;D3/def2&#8208;TZVP level, atoms&#8208;in&#8208;molecules, natural bond orbital studies) prove the formation of net attractive noncovalent interactions between group 5 elements and electron&#8208;rich atoms (neutral or anionic). These bondings are markedly different from coordination bonds formed by the same elements and possess the distinctive features of &#963;&#8208;hole interactions. The term erythroniumbond is proposed to denote these bonds. X&#8208;ray structures of vanadate&#8208;dependent bromoperoxidases show these interactions are present also in biological systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Developments on Photochemical Synthesis of 1,n&#8208;Dicarbonyls</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
1,n&#8208;dicarbonyls, having immense applications in the pharmaceutical industry owing to their fascinating attributes and biological activity, have been exploited as versatile building blocks in synthetic organic chemistry. The recent advancement on assembly of 1,n&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds via different photochemical modes of reaction has been documented in this review.







Abstract
1,n&#8208;dicarbonyls are one of the most fascinating chemical feedstocks finding abundant usage in the field of pharmaceuticals. Besides, they are utilized in a plethora of synthesis in general synthetic organic chemistry. A number of &#8216;conventional&#8217; methods are available for their synthesis, such as the Stetter reaction, Baker&#8208;Venkatraman rearrangement, oxidation of vicinal diols, and oxidation of deoxybenzoins, synonymous with unfriendly reagents and conditions. In the last 15&#8197;years or so, photocatalysis has taken the world of synthetic organic chemistry by a remarkable renaissance. It is fair to say now that everybody loves the light and photoredox chemistry has opened a new gateway to organic chemists towards milder, more simpler alternatives to the previously available methods, allowing access to many sensitive reactions and products. In this review, we present the readers with the photochemical synthesis of a variety of 1,n&#8208;dicarbonyls. Diverse photocatalytic pathways to these fascinating molecules have been discussed, placing special emphasis on the mechanisms, giving the reader an opportunity to find all these significant developments in one place.

         <title>Design and Synthesis of BODIPY&#8208;Hetero[5]helicenes as Heavy&#8208;Atom&#8208;Free Triplet Photosensitizers for Photodynamic Therapy of Cancer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
BODIPY&#8208;hetero[5]helicenes have been synthesized by fusing BODIPY and hetero[5]helicene structures. All the fused compounds have helical structures and their twisting angles are also increased by substitutions at the boron centre. The BODIPY&#8208;hetero[5]helicenes show superior optical properties and high singlet&#8208;oxygen generation capacities that increase proportionally with their twisting angle.







Abstract
Designing heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free triplet photosensitizers (PSs) is a challenge for the efficient photodynamic therapy (PDT) of cancer. Helicenes are twisted polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with an efficient intersystem crossing (ISC) that is proportional to their twisting angle. But their difficult syntheses and weak absorption profile in the visible spectral region restrict their use as heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free triplet PSs for PDT. On the other hand, boron&#8208;containing PAHs, BODIPYs are highly recognized for their outstanding optical properties. However, planar BODIPY dyes has low ISC and thus they are not very effective as PDT agents. We have designed and synthesized fused compounds containing both BODIPY and hetero[5]helicene structures to develop red&#8208;shifted chromophores with efficient ISC. One of the pyrrole units of the BODIPY core was also replaced by a thiazole unit to further enhance the triplet conversion. All the fused compounds have helical structure, and their twisting angles are also increased by substitutions at the boron centre. The helical structures of the BODIPY&#8208;hetero[5]helicenes were confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallography and DFT structure optimization. The designed BODIPY&#8208;hetero[5]helicenes showed superior optical properties and high ISC with respect to [5]helicene. Interestingly their ISC efficiencies increase proportionally with their twisting angles. This is the first report on the relationship between the twisting angle and the ISC efficiency in twisted BODIPY&#8208;based compounds. Theoretical calculations showed that energy gap of the S1 and T1 states decreases in BODIPY&#8208;hetero[5]helicene as compared to planar BODIPY. This enhances the ISC rate in BODIPY&#8208;hetero[5]helicene, which is responsible for their high generation of singlet oxygen. Finally, their potential applications as PDT agents were investigated, and one BODIPY&#8208;hetero[5]helicene showed efficient cancer cell killing upon photo&#8208;exposure. This new design strategy will be very useful for the future development of heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free PDT agents.

         <title>Carbonylative Self&#8208;Coupling of Aryl Boronic Acids Using a Confined Pd Catalyst within Melamine Dendron and Fibrous Nano&#8208;Silica: A CO Surrogate Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A confined Pd/DN&#8208;DFNS as a heterogeneous catalyst is synthesized and used for the oxidative carbonylative synthesis of symmetric biaryl ketones from various aryl boronic acids using N&#8208;formyl saccharine as a C1 source. This catalytic system implies the recyclability of up to five consecutive cycles without loss of catalytic activity, is free of moisture&#8208;sensitive ligands and uses molecular oxygen as an oxidant and CuI as a co&#8208;catalyst.







Abstract
Development of heterogeneous catalysts with tunable activity and selectivity has posed a persistent challenge. This study addresses this challenge by fabricating a hybrid environment through the combination of mesoporous silica and N&#8208;rich melamine dendron via covalent grafting, allowing for controllable growth and encapsulation of Pd NPs. This catalyst presented an excellent catalytic activity for the oxidative carbonylative self&#8208;coupling of aryl boronic acids to afford symmetric biaryl ketones using N&#8208;formyl saccharin as a sustainable solid CO source and Cu as a co&#8208;catalyst.

         <title>DNA Windmill Probe for Multiplexed mRNA Detection and Cell Type Discrimination</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Differences in the relative expression levels of cancer&#8208;related biomarker deliver key information about tumor progression. Herein, we developed a DNA windmill probe with four wind blades that could respond four mRNAs simultaneously and independently. The combination of four markers would present a superior picture for a particular cancer subtype, just like solving a jigsaw puzzle.







Abstract
Accurate cancer diagnosis especially early diagnosis is of great importance for prompt therapy and elevated survival rate. mRNAs are widely used as biomarkers for cancer identification and treatment. mRNA expression levels are highly associated with cancer stage and malignant progression. Nevertheless, single type mRNA detection is insufficient and unreliable. Herein, we developed a DNA nano&#8208;windmill probe for in&#8197;situ multiplexed mRNAs detection and imaging in this paper. The probe is designed to simultaneously target four types of mRNA through wind blades. Importantly, recognition of targets is independent from each other, which further facilitate cell type discrimination. The probe can specifically distinguish cancer cell lines from normal cells. In addition, it can identify changes in mRNA expression levels in living cells. The current strategy enriches the toolbox for improving the accuracy of cancer diagnosis and therapeutic solutions.

         <title>A Doubly Dissipative System Driven by Chemical and Radiative Stimuli</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The motions of an alkali cation from and to the crown&#8208;ether moieties of different ligands (up to three) is controlled over time and in a dissipative fashion by contextually employing two orthogonal stimuli, namely a radiative one and a chemical one. When the stimuli are no longer supplied, moving from out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium states, the system reversibly returns to its equilibrium state.







Abstract
The operation of a dissipative network composed of two or three different crown&#8208;ether receptors and an alkali metal cation can be temporally driven by the use (combined or not) of two orthogonal stimuli of a different nature. More specifically, irradiation with light at a proper wavelength and/or addition of an activated carboxylic acid, are used to modulate the binding capability of the above crown&#8208;ethers towards the metal ion, allowing to control over time the occupancy of the metal cation in the crown&#8208;ether moiety of a given ligand. Thus, application of either or both of the stimuli to an initially equilibrated system, where the metal cation is distributed among the crown&#8208;ether receptors depending on the different affinities, causes a programmable change in the receptor occupancies. Consequently, the system is induced to evolve to one or more out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium states with different distributions of the metal cation among the different receptors. When the fuel is exhausted or/and the irradiation interrupted, the system reversibly and autonomously goes back to the initial equilibrium state. Such results may contribute to the achievement of new dissipative systems that, taking advantage of multiple and orthogonal stimuli, are featured with more sophisticated operating mechanisms and time programmability.

         <title>Impact of Catalyst Deuteration on the Reactivity of Chiral Phase&#8208;Transfer Organocatalysts</title>

Cards for improvement. Site&#8208;specifically deuterated organocatalysts were synthesized and found to display improved reactivity compared to the non&#8208;deuterated analogs. The stability and catalytic performance were generally improved by deuteration, though the improvement was structure dependent. In particular, an unexpectedly large secondary kinetic isotope effect was observed for the tetradeuterated catalyst.







Abstract
Site&#8208;specifically deuterated organocatalysts were prepared and found to show improved reactivity over the non&#8208;deuterated analogs. Two privileged C2&#8208;symmetric chiral binaphthyl&#8208;modified tetraalkylammonium salts were selected for this study. The stability of these phase&#8208;transfer catalysts was generally improved by site&#8208;specific deuteration, though the degree of improvement was structure dependent. In particular, a large secondary kinetic isotope effect was observed for the tetradeuterated phase&#8208;transfer catalyst. The performance of these deuterated catalysts in the asymmetric catalytic alkylation of amino acid derivatives was better than that of non&#8208;deuterated analogs at low catalyst loadings. The results suggest that catalyst deuteration is a promising strategy for enhancing the stability and performance of organocatalysts.

         <title>Development of Fluorescent Isocoumarin&#8208;Fused Oxacyclononyne &#8211; 1,2,3&#8208;Triazole Pairs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorescent pairs of isocoumarin&#8208;fused cycloalkynes IC9O&#8208;COOMe and IC9O&#8208;CN/1,2,3&#8208;triazoles were developed. The basis for creating IC9O&#8208;EWG is understanding the reason for the S1 state deactivation mechanism for their non&#8208;fluorescent analog IC9O using multi&#8208;configurational ab initio and DFT methodologies and eliminating this deactivation pathway through rational design.







Abstract
Fluorescent isocoumarin&#8208;fused cycloalkynes, which are reactive in SPAAC and give fluorescent triazoles regardless of the azide nature, have been developed. The key structural feature that converts the non&#8208;fluorescent cycloalkyne/triazole pair to its fluorescent counterpart is the pi&#8208;acceptor group (COOMe, CN) at the C6 position of the isocoumarin ring. The design of the fluorescent cycloalkyne/triazole pairs is based on the theoretical study of the S1 state deactivation mechanism of the non&#8208;fluorescent isocoumarin&#8208;fused cycloalkyne IC9O using multi&#8208;configurational ab initio and DFT methodologies. The calculations revealed that deactivation proceeds through the electrocyclic ring opening of the &#945;&#8208;pyrone cycle and is accompanied by a redistribution of electron density in the fused benzene ring. We proposed that the S1 excited state deactivation barrier could be increased by introducing a pi&#8208;acceptor group into a position that is in direct conjugation with the formed C=O group and has a reduced electron density in the transition state. As a proof of concept, we designed and synthesized two fluorescent isocoumarin&#8208;fused cycloalkynes IC9O&#8208;COOMe and IC9O&#8208;CN bearing pi&#8208;acceptors at the C6 position. The importance of the nature of a pi&#8208;acceptor group was shown by the example of much less fluorescent CF3&#8208;substituted cycloalkyne IC9O&#8208;CF3.

A game&#8208;changing generation of new protease assay substrates have been developed by using the nitrobenzofurazane (NBD) fluorophore. With applications across different protease classes, this breakthrough promises to decisively improve fluorometric assays in protease drug discovery.







Abstract
Fluorometric assays are one of the most frequently used methods in medicinal chemistry. Over the last 50&#8197;years, the reporter molecules for the detection of protease activity have evolved from first&#8208;generation colorimetric p&#8208;nitroanilides, through FRET substrates, and 7&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;methyl coumarin (AMC)&#8208;based substrates. The aim of further substrate development is to increase sensitivity and reduce vulnerability to assay interferences. Herein, we describe a new generation of substrates for protease assays based on 7&#8208;nitrobenz&#8208;2&#8208;oxa&#8208;1,3&#8208;diazol&#8208;4&#8208;yl&#8208;amides (NBD&#8208;amides). In this study, we synthesized and tested substrates for 10 different proteases from the serine&#8208;, cysteine&#8208;, and metalloprotease classes. Enzyme&#8208; and substrate&#8208;specific parameters as well as the inhibitory activity of literature&#8208;known inhibitors confirmed their suitability for application in fluorometric assays. Hence, we were able to present NBD&#8208;based alternatives for common protease substrates. In conclusion, these NBD substrates are not only less susceptible to common assay interference, but they are also able to replace FRET&#8208;based substrates with the requirement of a prime site amino acid residue.
