         <title>Synthesis of 3&#8208;Borylated Pyrrolidines by 1,3&#8208;Dipolar Cycloaddition of Alkenyl Boronates and Azomethine Ylide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A scalable and efficient approach to the synthesis of 3&#8208;borylated pyrrolidine building blocks with various substitution patterns (including fused and spirocyclic sp3&#8208;rich derivatives) through the 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition of azomethine ylide is disclosed. The target compounds were prepared on a multigram scale, and their potential for C&#8722;C and C&#8722;heteroatom bond&#8208;forming reactions is illustrated.







Abstract
A scalable and efficient process for the preparation of 3&#8208;borylated pyrrolidines by 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition of N&#8208;benzyl azomethine ylide generated in&#8197;situ has been developed. The optimized method included the use of LiF in DMSO at 110&#8201;&#176;C and was suitable for &#945;&#8208;mono&#8208;, &#945;,&#946;&#8208;di&#8208;, and &#945;,&#946;,&#946;&#8208;trialkyl&#8208;, &#946;,&#946;&#8208;(hetera)cycloalkylidene&#8208;, CO2Et&#8208;, as well as most &#946;&#8208;(het)aryl&#8208;substituted alkenyl boropinacolates. The 1,3&#8208;dipolar reaction proceeded on a multigram scale providing 3&#8208;borylated pyrrolidines with diverse substitution patterns (including fused and spirocyclic ones) in a diastereoselective manner. The Pd(OH)2&#8208;mediated N&#8208;debenzylation of pyrrolidine hydrochlorides was successfully performed to give the corresponding bifunctional building blocks on an up to 130&#8197;g scale, thus providing a substantial expansion of the synthetic and medicinal chemist's toolbox. Other reactions included the preparation of trifluoroborates, Zweifel&#8208;Aggarwal sp3&#8208;sp2 coupling, and oxidative deborylation as an example of C&#8208;heteroatom bond formation.

         <title>Dipole&#8208;Dipole and Anion&#8208;&#960;+ Interaction Manipulation Synergistically Enhance Intrinsic Antibacterial Activities of AIEgens</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synergistic manipulation strategy of dipole&#8208;dipole and anion&#8208;&#960;+ interaction is proposed to enhance the binding affinity of dyes toward pathogenic bacteria and to construct highly efficient luminescence&#8208;guided antimicrobials with aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) feature independent of light and the surrounding oxygen.







Abstract
Pathogenic bacteria infections, especially multidrug resistant bacteria infections have aroused worldwide attention due to their severe threats to human beings. Thus, the development of highly effective antibacterial reagents is very important. However, the design of antimicrobials is still quite challenging for the lack of a universal design strategy. Here, a synergistic manipulation strategy of dipole&#8208;dipole and anion&#8208;&#960;+ interaction is proposed for constructing highly efficient antimicrobials with aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) feature. Firstly, four anion&#8208;&#960;+&#8208;type AIE luminogens were designed and synthesized. Due to the electron&#8208;donating and hydrophilic characteristic of methoxy groups, 3MOTPO containing three methoxy groups showed the largest dipole moment (5.06 Debye) and dual anion&#8208;&#960;+ interactions in the solid state. Driven by both dipole&#8208;dipole and anion&#8208;&#960;+ interactions, 3MOTPO showed the strongest bacterial binding ability and the best antibacterial activities (MIC90=3.76&#8197;&#956;M). The work offers a deep insight into the rational design of highly efficient antimicrobials for luminescence&#8208;guided antibacterial study.

         <title>High&#8208;Efficient Ultrathin PdCuMo Porous Nanosheets with Abundant Defects for Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrathin PdCuMo porous nanosheets with rich cavities and structural defects have been successfully prepared by a simple method. Due to the novel structures which can provide extensive active sites and the electronic interaction between Cu, Pd and Mo elements, ultrathin PdCuMo porous nanosheets display outstanding catalytic activities and stabilities.







Abstract
To reduce the over&#8208;dependence on Pt, Pd&#8208;based catalysts have become one of the most effective candidates for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). In order to further accelerate the ORR kinetics and strengthen the catalytic performance of Pd catalysts, component optimization and morphology design have been adopted. Although great progress has been made, it is still difficult to obtain porous ultrathin nanosheets with excellent performance by a simple method. Here, ultrathin PdCuMo porous nanosheets (PdCuMo NSs) were successfully prepared. This structure possessed a large specific surface area with rich cavities and structural defects, significantly enhancing its ORR performance. In special, the mass activity of PdCuMo NSs was 1.46&#8197;A&#8201;mg&#8722;1 at 0.90&#8197;V, which was 12.2, 8.6, and 2.7&#8197;times as high as that of Pd/C, Pt/C, and PdCuMo nanoparticles (PdCuMo NPs), respectively. In addition, it had an excellent ability to resist CO poisoning and exhibited remarkable long&#8208;term stability.

         <title>Fusion of Aza&#8208; and Oxadiborepins with Furans in a Reversible Ring&#8208;Opening Process Furnishes Versatile Building Blocks for Extended &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Materials</title>

         <dc:description>
Merging furan rings with 1,2,7&#8208;oxa&#8208; and &#8208;azadiborepins. This modular synthesis proceeds through a reversible ring&#8208;opening process and furnishes the novel heteropolyaromatic compounds from a common precursor. The tricyclic systems are overall aromatic, and weak aromaticity in the diboron heterocycles favors &#960; electron delocalization over the bifuran unit. The &#960;&#8208;conjugated system is easily extended through the &#945;&#8208;positions of the furan rings.







Abstract
A modular synthesis of both difurooxa&#8208; and difuroazadiborepins from a common precursor is demonstrated. Starting from 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bifuran, after protection of the positions 5 and 5&#8217; with bulky silyl groups, formation of the novel polycycles proceeds through opening of the furan rings to a dialkyne and subsequent re&#8208;cyclization in the borylation step. The resulting bifuran&#8208;fused diborepins show pronounced stability, highly planar tricyclic structures, and intense blue light emission. Deprotection and transformation into dibrominated building blocks that can be incorporated into &#960;&#8208;extended materials can be performed in one step. Detailed DFT calculations provide information about the aromaticity of the constituent rings of this polycycle.

         <title>A Macrocyclic Furan with Accessible Oxidation States: Switching Between Aromatic and Antiaromatic Global Ring Currents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first macrocyclic furan with accessible oxidation states was synthesized using a post&#8208;macrocyclization approach. It exhibits low oxidation potentials, and switching between antiaromatic and aromatic global ring currents upon oxidation.







Abstract
Macrocyclic furans are predicted to switch between global aromaticity and antiaromaticity, depending on their oxidation states. However, the macrocyclic furans reported to date are stabilized by electron withdrawing groups, which result in inaccessible oxidation states. To circumvent this problem, a post&#8208;macrocyclization approach was applied to introduce methylene&#8208;substituted macrocyclic furans, which display an extremely low oxidation potential of &#8722;0.23 vs. Fc/Fc+, and are partially oxidized in ambient conditions. Additional oxidation to the dication results in aromaticity switching to a global 30&#960;e&#8722; aromatic state, as indicated by the formation of a strong diatropic current observed in the 1H&#8197;NMR spectrum. NICS and ACID calculations support this trend and provide evidence for a different pathway for the global current in the neutral and dicationic states. According to these findings, macrocyclic furans can be rendered as promising p&#8208;type materials with stable oxidation states.

         <title>[Nb@Ge13/14]3&#8722;: New Family Members of Ge&#8208;Based Intermetalloid Clusters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two new clusters [Nb@Ge13]3&#8722; and [Nb@Ge14]3&#8722; were successfully synthesized; they represent the first 13&#8208; and 14&#8208;vertex endohedral Ge cages. HOMO&#8208;2 orbital of [Nb@Ge13]3&#8722; (left) shows a bonding character with respect to the shortest Nb&#8722;Ge contact, whereas the analogous HOMO&#8208;2 orbital of [Nb@Ge14]3&#8722; (right) shows anti&#8208;bonding character over the related fragment.







Abstract
During the past two decades, single&#8208;atom&#8208;centered medium&#8208;sized germanium clusters [M@Gen] (M=transition metals, n&gt;12) have been extensively explored, both from theoretical perspectives and experimental gas&#8208;phase syntheses. However, the actual structural arrangements of the Ge13 and Ge14 endohedral cages are still ambiguous and have long remained an unresolved problem for experimental implementation. In this work, we successfully synthesize 13&#8208;/14&#8208;vertex Ge clusters [Nb@Ge13]3&#8722; (1) and [Nb@Ge14]3&#8722; (2), which are structurally characterized and exhibit unprecedented topologies, neither classical deltahedra nor 3&#8208;connected polyhedral structures. Theoretical analysis indicates that the major stabilization of the Ge backbones arises due to the substantial interaction of Ge 4p&#8208;AOs with the endohedral Nb 4d&#8208;AOs through three/four&#8208;center two&#8208;electron bonds with an enhanced electron density accumulated over the shortest Nb&#8722;Ge13 contact in 1. Low occupancies of the direct two&#8208;center two&#8208;electron (2c&#8211;2e) Nb&#8722;Ge and Ge&#8722;Ge &#963; bonds point to a considerable degree of electron delocalization over the Ge cages revealing their electron deficiency.

         <title>Enhanced Optical Properties of Azaborole Helicenes by Lateral and Helical Extension</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#960;&#8208;Extended Azaborole Helicenes. A unique set of &#960;&#8208;extended azaborole helicenes, assembled from N&#8208;heteroaromatic and dibenzo[g,p]chrysene building blocks, shows excellent optical properties. The lateral and helical extensions of the helicene scaffold significantly enhanced emission quantum yields and dissymmetry factors.







Abstract
The synthesis and characterization of laterally extended azabora[5]&#8208;, &#8208;[6]&#8208; and &#8208;[7]helicenes, assembled from N&#8208;heteroaromatic and dibenzo[g,p]chrysene building blocks is described. Formally, the &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems of the pristine azaborole helicenes were enlarged with a phenanthrene unit leading to compounds with large Stokes shifts, significantly enhanced luminescence quantum yields (&#934;) and dissymmetry factors (glum). The beneficial effect on optical properties was also observed for helical elongation. The combined contributions of lateral and helical extensions resulted in a compound showing green emission with &#934; of 0.31 and |glum| of 2.2&#215;10&#8722;3, highest within the series of &#960;&#8208;extended azaborahelicenes and superior to emission intensity and chiroptical response of its non&#8208;extended congener. This study shows that helical and lateral extensions of &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems are viable strategies to improve features of azaborole helicenes. In addition, single crystal X&#8208;ray analysis of configurationally stable [6]&#8208; and &#8208;[7]helicenes was used to provide insight into their packing arrangements.

         <title>Single&#8208;Layer 2D Ni&#8722;BDC MOF Obtained in Supercritical CO2&#8208;Assisted Aqueous Solution</title>

         <dc:description>
A chip off the old MOF: A CO2 molecule can exchange with the lattice&#8208;coordinated H2O molecules and side&#8208;on coordinate with the metal Ni sites on Ni&#8722;BDC surface simultaneously; finally this breaks the interlayer hydrogen bond of bulk Ni&#8722;BDC and helps to form 2D MOF.







Abstract
The development of an efficient strategy for fabricating two&#8208;dimensional metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) nanosheets with high yield and high stability is desirable. Herein, we demonstrate for the first time that large, single&#8208;layer 2D nickel&#8208;benzene dicarboxylate (Ni&#8722;BDC) MOF nanosheets can be fabricated with the assistance of supercritical (SC) CO2 in a pure aqueous system. Detailed experimental evidence reveals that the SC CO2 molecule can exchange with the lattice&#8208;coordinated H2O molecules, side&#8208;on coordinate with the metal Ni1 sites on the Ni&#8722;BDC surface, and finally break the interlayer hydrogen bond to exfoliate the bulk Ni&#8722;BDC into a 2D MOF. More importantly, a thin SC CO2 layer building up at the water&#8722;Ni&#8722;BDC interfaces can transform the pristine hydrophilic interface into a super&#8208;hydrophobic one. This super&#8208;hydrophobic layer at the water&#8208;MOF interface can effectively prevent dissociation, thus promoting the stability of Ni&#8722;BDC in aqueous system.

         <title>Vinylic Trifluoromethylselenolation via Pd&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;H Activation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Trifluoromethylselenolation of vinylic substrates was performed through a palladium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation. This reaction was based on the use of 5&#8208;methoxy&#8208;8&#8208;amino&#8208;quinoline as directing group and trifluoromethyl tolueneselenosulfonate as trifluoromethylselenolating reagent. This method was also extended to fluoroalkylselenolation reactions.







Abstract
Trifluorometylselenolation via C&#8722;H activation is barely described in literature. In particular, no such vinylic functionalization has been yet described. Herein, a palladium&#8208;catalyzed trifluoromethylselenolation of vinylic C&#8722;H bonds is described. The 5&#8208;methoxy&#8208;8&#8208;aminoquinoline has been used as auxiliary directing group to perform this reaction. The reaction gives excellent yields with &#945;&#8208;substituted compounds whatever the substituents and a microwave activation can be used to accelerate the reaction.

     alt="Vinylic Trifluoromethylselenolation via Pd-Catalyzed C&#8722;H Activation"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Trifluoromethylselenolation&lt;/b&gt; of vinylic substrates was performed through a palladium-catalyzed C&#8722;H activation. This reaction was based on the use of 5-methoxy-8-amino-quinoline as directing group and trifluoromethyl tolueneselenosulfonate as trifluoromethylselenolating reagent. This method was also extended to fluoroalkylselenolation reactions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trifluorometylselenolation via C&#8722;H activation is barely described in literature. In particular, no such vinylic functionalization has been yet described. Herein, a palladium-catalyzed trifluoromethylselenolation of vinylic C&#8722;H bonds is described. The 5-methoxy-8-aminoquinoline has been used as auxiliary directing group to perform this reaction. The reaction gives excellent yields with &#945;-substituted compounds whatever the substituents and a microwave activation can be used to accelerate the reaction. With &#946;-substituted substrates lower yields, but still satisfactory, are obtained. This methodology was also successfully extended to other fluoroalkylselenyl groups.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Combustion time! The synthesis of a &#948;&#8208;ketohydroperoxide is described, addressing the compatibilities of ketones and hydroperoxides in these elusive combustion&#8208;relevant species. The hydroperoxide is installed through sulfonylhydrazine substitution, in which it is found that 1,2&#8208;dimethoxyethane is an advantageous medium for the transformation. The synthesis is scalable and safe, providing material for future chemical kinetics studies.







Abstract
A synthesis of a &#948;&#8208;ketohydroperoxide is described, addressing potential functional&#8208;group compatibilities in these elusive species relevant to combustion and atmospheric chemistries. The hydroperoxide is installed via sulfonylhydrazine substitution, which was found to be more effective than displacement of secondary halides. As part of this protocol, it was observed that 1,2&#8208;dimethoxyethane is an advantageous medium for the reaction, avoiding the formation of a tetrahydrofuran hydroperoxide side product. This discovery facilitated the multigram synthesis (6&#8197;steps, 41&#8201;% yield overall) and discrete characterization of the target &#948;&#8208;ketohydroperoxide.

         <title>Acid&#8208;Modulated Synthesis of Novel &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Microporous Polymers for Efficient Metal&#8208;Free Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report an approach to construct two structurally different (&#946;&#8208;ketoenamine and boranil&#8208;based) CMPs from identical monomers via simple acid modulation (BF3.Et2O and CH3COOH). The polymers display distinctly different optical and electronic properties. Boranil CMP display superior photocatalytic activity producing hydrogen at a superior rate of 252&#8197;&#956;mol/g over &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine polymer (100&#8197;&#956;mol/g).







Abstract
Simple synthetic modifications that tune the molecular structures, thereby the properties of the molecules, are of topical interest. Herein, we report the synthesis of two novel cationic rosaniline&#8208;based conjugated microporous polymers (CMPs) from identical monomers via simple acid modulation (Acetic acid and BF3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;Et2O). The condensation reaction of rosaniline with 2,4,6&#8208;triformylphloroglucinol in acetic acid renders &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine&#8208;linked CMP (CMP&#8208;A) while changing the acid to BF3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;Et2O, the linkages transform to enol and undergoes BF2&#8208;complexation, leading to boranil CMP (CMP&#8208;B). BF2&#8208;functionalities in boranil CMP significantly modified the optical and functional properties compared to &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine&#8208;linked CMP. The cationic&#8208;delocalization along with the extended &#960;&#8208;delocalization supported by chromophoric BF2&#8208;groups allow CMP&#8208;B to exhibit broad absorption spanning the visible to Near&#8208;Infrared region (NIR). The absorption red&#8208;edge of CMP&#8208;B appears around 1277&#8197;nm (optical band gap &#8764;1.58&#8197;eV) while CMP&#8208;A displays at 981&#8197;nm (optical band gap &#8764;1.83&#8197;eV). Most interestingly, as a photocatalyst, CMP&#8208;B catalyzes hydrogen evolution with a superior rate of 252&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1 over CMP&#8208;A (100&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1). It is about 2.5&#8197;times higher performance. The transient photocurrent measurements, electrochemical impedance data, and in&#8208;depth mott&#8208;Schottky analysis demonstrate that the BF2&#8208;group in CMP&#8208;B generates photoinduced charge carriers and their migration towards the active sites for photocatalysis. These polymers show significant photocatalytic H2 generation without any supportive metal co&#8208;catalyst. The BF2 complexed building blocks are a unique class of metal&#8208;free photocatalysts for hydrogen evolution through green and cost&#8208;effective approach.

         <title>Photocatalytic Reduction of Nicotinamide Co&#8208;factor by Perylene Sensitized RhIII Complexes
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a catalytically active intramolecular photocatalyst, which combines a perylene photosensitizer and a RhIII catalyst. Spectroscopic studies reveal the formation of a charge&#8208;separated perylene radical cation&#8208;RhII intermediate that results in a catalytically active species in the presence of protons.







Abstract
The ambitious goal of artificial photosynthesis is to develop active systems that mimic nature and use light to split water into hydrogen and oxygen. Intramolecular design concepts are particularly promising. Herein, we firstly present an intramolecular photocatalyst integrating a perylene&#8208;based light&#8208;harvesting moiety and a catalytic rhodium center (RhIIIphenPer). The excited&#8208;state dynamics were investigated by means of steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved absorption and emission spectroscopy. The studies reveal that photoexcitation of RhIIIphenPer yields the formation of a charge&#8208;separated intermediate, namely RhIIphenPer.+, that results in a catalytically active species in the presence of protons.

         <title>Cucurbit[7]uril&#8208;Encapsulation&#8208;Controlled Supramolecular Photoproduct and Radical Fluorescence Emission</title>

Control and stabilize: A host&#8211;guest interaction controlled photoproduct and organic radical fluorescence emission by using cucurbit[7]uril (Q[7])&#8208;based pseudorotaxane structures is reported. Tetrakis(pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;yl)ethylene (TPyE) derivatives can be assembled as cationic guests by the Q[7] host to form a [5]pseudorotaxane in aqueous solution. The host stabilizes the radical fluorescence emission of the photoirradiation&#8208;triggered intermediate of the guest, thus implying that the macrocyclic assembly has potential applications in the development of luminescent radical materials.







Abstract
Herein, a host&#8211;guest interaction&#8211;controlled photoproduct created by using cucurbit[7]uril (Q[7])&#8208;based pseudorotaxane structures is reported. The assembly exhibited controlled behavior towards the reduction of the ethylene (C=C) bond in the tetrakis(pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;yl)ethylene (TPyE) guest molecule under UV light irradiation. This can be attributed to the Q[7] encapsulation masking the four pyridinium arms of the guest, which inhibits planarization of the TPyE core to form the cyclization product. In particular, the strong affinity of Q[7] for the butyl&#8208;substituted guest (TPyE&#8208;4C) led to an unusual radical fluorescence emission of the photoirradiation&#8208;triggered intermediate of the guest molecule being observed in aqueous solution. This work provides a valuable paradigm and new insight for macrocycle&#8208;based host&#8722;guest interactions in supramolecular catalysis and luminescent radical materials.

In particular, the strong affinity of Q[7] for the butyl-substituted guest (TPyE-4C) led to an unusual radical fluorescence emission of the photoirradiation-triggered intermediate of the guest molecule being observed in aqueous solution. This work provides a valuable paradigm and new insight for macrocycle-based host&#8722;guest interactions in supramolecular catalysis and luminescent radical materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cost&#8208;Effective 2D Ultrathin Metal&#8211;Organic Layers with Bis&#8208;Metallic Catalytic Sites for Visible Light&#8208;Driven Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>

         <dc:description>
2D ultrathin metal&#8211;organic layers (MOLs) with bis&#8208;metallic sites have been developed for visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven CO2 reduction. The expanded checkerboard represents the 2D MOL structure. The two differently colored pawns represent bis&#8208;metallic sites, the cream one being responsible for transferring electrons to CO2, and the cyan one denoting protons coupling with CO2. The ingenious layout makes them work synergistically resulting in a magical effect that is crucial for efficient CO2 photoreduction to CO.

         <title>Transition&#8208;Linker Containing Detergents for Membrane Protein Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It is pressing but still challenging to explore the structure and function of membrane proteins (MPs). One of the main obstacles lies in the limited availability of matched detergents in the handling of the specific MPs. We describe herein a new design of detergent by the incorporation of a transition linker between the hydrophilic head and the hydrophobic tail. This design allows a gradual change of hydrophobicity between outside and inside of micelles, in contrast to the abrupt switch in conventional detergents. Notably, many of these detergents assembled into micelles in smaller sizes while retaining the low critical micelle concentrations. Meanwhile, thermal stabilizing evaluation identified superior detergents for representative MPs, including G protein&#8208;coupled receptors and a transporter protein. Among them, selected detergent further improved the NMR study of MPs. We anticipate these optimal results would encourage future detergent expansion through the new remodeling on the traditional detergent scaffold.</dc:description>

         <title>Shedding Light on the Enigmatic TcO2&#183;xH2O Structure with Density Functional Theory and EXAFS Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The &#946;&#8208;emitting  99Tc isotope is a high&#8208;yield fission product in  235U and  239Pu nuclear reactors, raising special concern in nuclear waste management due to its long half&#8208;life and the high mobility of pertechnetate (TcO4&#8722;  ). In the conditions of deep nuclear waste repositories, retention of Tc is achieved via biotic and abiotic reduction of TcO4&#8722;  to compounds like amorphous TcO2&#183;xH2O precipitates. It is generally accepted that these precipitates have linear (Tc(&#956;&#8208;O)2(H2O)2)n  chains, with trans H2O. Although corresponding Tc&#8208;Tc and Tc&#8208;O distances have been obtained from Extended X&#8208;ray Absorption Fine Structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy, this structure is largely based on analogy with other compounds. Here, we combine Density&#8208;Functional Theory with EXAFS measurements of fresh and aged samples to show that, instead, TcO2&#183;xH2O forms zigzag chains that undergo a slow aging process whereby they combine to form longer chains and, later, a tridimensional structure that might lead to a new TcO2  polymorph.</dc:description>

         <title>1,2,5&#8208;Triarylcycloalka[c]arsoles: Structural Effects of Fused&#8208;cycloalkanes on Stability and Photophysical Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we have synthesized a variety of cycloalkane&#8208;fused arsoles. Cyclopentane and cyclohexane were incorporated into the cycloalkane&#8208;fused arsoles. Surprisingly, cyclohexane&#8208;fused arsole  2a  gradually decomposed via oxidative ring&#8208;opening under ambient conditions, while cyclopentane&#8208;fused  1a  was stable. In addition, the Stokes shift of  2a  (7766 cm  &#8211;1  ) is larger than that of  1a  (5120 cm  &#8211;1  ). The effects of the fused cycloalkane on the stability and photophysical properties were attributed to the distortion of the cycloalkane. Computational calculations demonstrated that the cyclohexane moiety in  2a  was frustrated upon being incorporated into the rigid arsole ring, while the cyclopentane moiety in  1a  was much less distorted.</dc:description>

         <title>The Mechanism of Biochemical NO&#8208;Sensing: Insights from Computational Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 49, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The production of cGMP and the resulting regulation of numerous physiological functions is regulated by the NO signaling pathway which occurs in soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC). Previously investigated by experiment, the exact details of the mechanism remain unclear, as two active states have been proposed. In this work, using computational techniques, we find that both active states are plausible, under different partial pressures of NO gas.







Abstract
The binding of small gas molecules such as NO and CO plays a major role in the signaling routes of the human body. The sole NO&#8208;receptor in humans is soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) &#8211; a histidine&#8208;ligated heme protein, which, upon NO binding, activates a downstream signaling cascade. Impairment of NO&#8208;signaling is linked, among others, to cardiovascular and inflammatory diseases. In the present work, we use a combination of theoretical tools such as MD simulations, high&#8208;level quantum chemical calculations and hybrid QM/MM methods to address various aspects of NO binding and to elucidate the most likely reaction paths and the potential intermediates of the reaction. As a model system, the H&#8208;NOX protein from Shewanella oneidensis (So H&#8208;NOX) homologous to the NO&#8208;binding domain of sGC is used. The signaling route is predicted to involve NO binding to form a six&#8208;coordinate intermediate heme&#8208;NO complex, followed by relatively facile His decoordination yielding a five&#8208;coordinate adduct with NO on the distal side with possible isomerization to the proximal side through binding of a second NO and release of the first one. MD simulations show that the His sidechain can quite easily rotate outward into solvent, with this motion being accompanied in our simulations by shifts in helix positions that are consistent with this decoordination leading to significant conformational change in the protein.

         <title>Modulation of the Naked&#8208;Eye and Fluorescence Color of a Protonated Boron&#8208;Doped Thiazolothiazole by Anion&#8208;Dependent Hydrogen Bonding</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 49, September 1, 2022. </description>

The visible and fluorescence colors of a doubly protonated boron&#8208;doped thiazolothiazole can be modulated by tuning its hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions with its counteranions or donor solvent molecules (Cl&#8722;, O3SCF3&#8722;, B(3,5&#8208;(CF3)2C6H3)4&#8722;, OEt2). DFT calculations show that these affect the relative energies of the &#960; orbitals involved in the S0&#8594;S1 transition, thus enabling fine&#8208;tuning of their absorption and emission spectral features.







Abstract
The reaction of a cyclic alkyl(amino)carbene (CAAC)&#8208;stabilized thiazaborolo[5,4&#8208;d]thiazaborole (TzbTzb) with strong Br&#248;nsted acids, such as HCl, HOTf (Tf=O2SCF3) and [H(OEt2)2][BArF4] (ArF=3,5&#8208;(CF3)2C6H3), results in the protonation of both TzbTzb nitrogen atoms. In each case X&#8208;ray crystallographic data show coordination of the counteranions (Cl&#8722;, OTf&#8722;, BArF4&#8722;) or solvent molecules (OEt2) to the doubly protonated fused heterocycle via hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions, the strength of which strongly influences the 1H&#8197;NMR shift of the NH protons, enabling tuning of both the visible (yellow to red) and fluorescence (green to red) colors of these salts. DFT calculations reveal that the hydrogen bonding of the counteranion or solvent to the protonated nitrogen centers affects the intramolecular TzbTzb&#8208;to&#8208;CAAC charge transfer character involved in the S0&#8594;S1 transition, ultimately enabling fine&#8208;tuning of their absorption and emission spectral features.

         <dc:description>
Select and separate: Two novel dicarboxyimide/imino&#8208;based organic cages are proposed as materials for the selective separation of CO2 from N2 and CH4 under vacuum swing adsorption conditions. Robust mixed&#8208;matrix membranes for gas separation were also obtained by loading the cages in either Matrimid&#174; or PEEK&#8208;WC as polymers. An improvement in the gas&#8208;transport properties is achieved compared to that of neat polymer membranes.







Abstract
Two novel imide/imine&#8208;based organic cages have been prepared and studied as materials for the selective separation of CO2 from N2 and CH4 under vacuum swing adsorption conditions. Gas adsorption on the new compounds showed selectivity for CO2 over N2 and CH4. The cages were also tested as fillers in mixed&#8208;matrix membranes for gas separation. Dense and robust membranes were obtained by loading the cages in either Matrimid&#174; or PEEK&#8208;WC polymers. Improved gas&#8208;transport properties and selectivity for CO2 were achieved compared to the neat polymer membranes.

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Free Synthesis of Core&#8208;Functionalised Naphthalene Diimides by Using a Vibratory Ball Mill: Suzuki, Sonogashira and Buchwald&#8211;Hartwig Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 49, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The solvent&#8208;free synthesis of core&#8208;functionalised naphthalene diimide (c&#8208;NDI) residues in a vibratory ball mill is reported. Twenty&#8208;one naphthalene diimide&#8208;based products were produced by using Suzuki, Sonogashira and Buchwald&#8208;Hartwig palladium coupling reactions, including dimeric diimide products that are constituents in functioning organic photovoltaic solar cells. These reactions are rapid (60 to 90&#8197;minutes), do not require additional heating, and are tolerant of air and atmospheric moisture.







Abstract
Solvent&#8208;free synthesis by using a vibratory ball mill (VBM) offers the chance to access new chemical reactivity, whilst reducing solvent waste and minimising reaction times. Herein, we report the core functionalisation of N,N&#8217;&#8208;bis(2&#8208;ethylhexyl)&#8208;2,6&#8208;dibromo&#8208;1,4,5,8&#8208;naphthalenetetracarboxylic acid (Br2&#8208;NDI) by using Suzuki, Sonogashira and Buchwald&#8211;Hartwig coupling reactions. The products of these reactions are important building blocks in many areas of organic electronics including organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs), organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs) and organic photovoltaic cells (OPVCs). The reactions proceed in as little as 1&#8197;h, use commercially available palladium sources (frequently Pd(OAc)2) and are tolerant to air and atmospheric moisture. Furthermore, the real&#8208;world potential of this green VBM protocol is demonstrated by the double Suzuki coupling of a monobromo(NDI) residue to a bis(thiophene) pinacol ester. The resulting dimeric NDI species has been demonstrated to behave as an electron acceptor in functioning OPVCs.

         <title>Bistriazoles Connected Through a B&#8722;B Bridge, Synthesized by Highly Selective Dipolar Cycloaddition Reactions of a Diazido&#8208;diborane(4)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 49, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An exceptionally thermally stable diazido diborane was applied in dipolar cycloaddition reactions with terminal alkynes. The products are the first bistriazoles connected by a B&#8722;B bond. The reactions are highly regioselective, leading exclusively to the 1,4&#8208;triazoles, and tolerate the presence of Lewis&#8208;basic groups and additional alkynyl groups at the alkyne.







Abstract
In this work we report the first cycloaddition reactions between a diazido diborane(4) and terminal alkynes, providing unique access to bis&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazoles connected by a B&#8722;B bridge. The catalyst&#8208;free reactions are highly selective, yielding exclusively the thermodynamically disfavored bis&#8208;1,4&#8208;triazoles. The reactions are enabled by the high thermal stability of the diazido&#8208;diborane [B(hpp)(N3)]2 (hpp=1,3,4,6,7,8&#8208;hexahydro&#8208;2H&#8208;pyrimido[1,2&#8208;&#945;]pyrimidinate). Due to the tetra&#8208;coordinate boron atoms in this reagent, the reactions are tolerant with respect to the introduction of Lewis&#8208;basic groups at the alkyne. The scope and limitations of the new reactions are discussed.

The influence of the size and doping effects of [TimSinO2(m+n)]&#8901;+ (m+n=2, 3, 8, 10, 12, 14) clusters towards methane activation have been explored by using a combination of gas&#8208;phase experiments and quantum chemical calculations.







Abstract
The size and doping effects in methane activation by Ti&#8722;Si&#8722;O clusters have been explored by using a combination of gas&#8208;phase experiments and quantum chemical calculations. All [TimSinO2(m+n)].+ (m+n=2, 3, 8, 10, 12, 14) clusters can extract a hydrogen from methane. The associated energies and structures have been revealed in detail. Moreover, the doping and size effects have been discussed involving generalized Kohn&#8208;Sham energy decomposition analysis, natural population analysis, Wiberg bond indexes (WBI), molecular polarity index (MPI) and ionization potential (IP). It suggested that Ti&#8722;Si&#8722;O clusters with a low Ti&#8201;:&#8201;Si ratio is beneficial to adsorbing methane and inclination to the hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) process, while the clusters with a high Ti&#8201;:&#8201;Si ratio favors the generation of a terminal oxygen radical and results in high reactivity and turnover frequency. On the other hand, a cluster size of m+n=12 is recommended considering both the ionization potential and the turnover frequency of the reaction. Hopefully, these finding will be instructive for the design of high&#8208;performance Ti&#8722;Si&#8722;O catalyst toward methane conversion.

         <title>Key Role of a&#8208;Top CO on Terrace Sites of Metallic Pd Clusters for CO Oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 49, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
O2 titration using in&#8197;situ DRIFTS was performed on metallic Pd cluster supported on Al2O3 saturated with CO. The most weakly adsorbed a&#8208;top CO adsorbed on terrace site preferentially reacted with oxygen than other CO species. It clearly demonstrated that the CO oxidation is initiated with a&#8208;top CO on terrace sites.







Abstract
Pd&#8208;based catalysts are the most widely used for CO oxidation because of their outstanding catalytic activity and thermal stability. However, fundamental understanding of the detailed catalytic processes occurring on Pd&#8208;based catalysts under realistic conditions is still lacking. In this study, we investigated CO oxidation on metallic Pd clusters supported on Al2O3 and SiO2. High&#8208;angle annular dark&#8208;field scanning transmission electron microscopy revealed the formation of similar&#8208;sized Pd clusters on Al2O3 and SiO2. In contrast, CO chemisorption analysis indicated a gradual change in the dispersion of Pd (from 0.79 to 0.2) on Pd/Al2O3 and a marginal change in the dispersion (from 0.4 to 0.24) on Pd/SiO2 as the Pd loading increased from 0.27 to 5.5&#8197;wt&#8201;%; these changes were attributed to differences in the metal&#8208;support interactions. Diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier&#8208;transform spectroscopy revealed that fewer a&#8208;top CO species were present in Pd supported on Al2O3 than those in Pd supported on SiO2, which is related to the morphological differences in the metallic Pd clusters on these two supports. Despite the different dispersion profiles and surface characteristics of Pd, O2 titration demonstrated that linearly bound CO (with an infrared signal at 2090&#8197;cm&#8722;1) reacted first with oxygen in the case of CO&#8208;saturated Pd on Al2O3 and SiO2, which suggests that a&#8208;top CO on the terrace site plays an important role in CO oxidation. The experimental observations were corroborated by periodic density functional calculations, which confirmed that CO oxidation on the (111) terrace sites is most plausible, both kinetically and thermodynamically, compared to that on the edge or corner sites. This study will deepen the fundamental understanding of the effect of Pd clusters on CO oxidation under reaction conditions.

         <title>Selective Oxidations Using a Cytochrome P450 Enzyme Variant Driven with Surrogate Oxygen Donors and Light</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 49, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single amino acid mutation can convert cytochrome P450 monooxygenases into peroxygenase. These do not require the addition of nicotinamide cofactors or electron transfer proteins greatly simplifying their application. For example, urea&#8208;hydrogen peroxide and light can be used to drive the selective oxidations catalysed by these enzymes.







Abstract
Cytochrome P450 monooxygenase enzymes are versatile catalysts, which have been adapted for multiple applications in chemical synthesis. Mutation of a highly conserved active site threonine to a glutamate can convert these enzymes into peroxygenases that utilise hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Here, we use the T252E&#8208;CYP199A4 variant to study peroxide&#8208;driven oxidation activity by using H2O2 and urea&#8208;hydrogen peroxide (UHP). We demonstrate that the T252E variant has a higher stability to H2O2 in the presence of substrate that can undergo carbon&#8208;hydrogen abstraction. This peroxygenase variant could efficiently catalyse O&#8208;demethylation and an enantioselective epoxidation reaction (94&#8201;% ee). Neither the monooxygenase nor peroxygenase pathways of the P450 demonstrated a significant kinetic isotope effect (KIE) for the oxidation of deuterated substrates. These new peroxygenase variants offer the possibility of simpler cytochrome P450 systems for selective oxidations. To demonstrate this, a light driven H2O2 generating system was used to support efficient product formation with this peroxygenase enzyme.

The different micellar and gel states formed by a flavin&#8208;based gelator can be used as effective and selective photocatalysts under visible light. The self&#8208;assembled structure formed directly translates into a difference in the activity of these structures in the photooxidation reactions.







Abstract
A new flavin&#8208;based gelator is reported which forms micellar structures at high pH and gels at low pH. This flavin can be used for the photooxidation of thiols under visible light, with the catalytic efficiency being linked to the self&#8208;assembled structures present.

         <title>Do Antarafacial Cycloadditions Occur? Cycloaddition of Heptafulvalene with Tetracyanoethylene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 49, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Antarafacial? No, suprafacial! The [14+2] cycloaddition of heptafulvalene with tetracyanoethylene has long been held as one of the only examples of an antarafacial cycloaddition. Experimental and computational studies demonstrate that it is not a concerted [14&#960;a+2&#960;s] process but instead a stepwise reaction that affords the trans&#8208;cycloadduct through suprafacial addition across the heptafulvalene ring system.







Abstract
The cycloaddition of heptafulvalene (1) with tetracyanoethylene (TCNE) was previously described as an example of an antarafacial cycloaddition, a [&#960;14a+&#960;2s] process that afforded only the trans cycloadduct by virtue of the edge&#8208;to&#8208;face approach of TCNE, facilitated by the S shape of 1. The reaction has been investigated in depth and found not to be a concerted antarafacial process. At low temperature, the reaction is observed to give a mixture of cis and trans cycloadducts as well as a [4+2] cycloadduct. The mixture of products is converted to the trans cycloadduct by equilibration upon warming to room temperature. Studies with diethyl 2,3&#8208;dicyanofumarate and &#8208;maleate confirmed the formation of cis cycloadducts. DFT studies at the M06&#8208;2X/6&#8208;311+G(2d,p) SCRF=acetone level of theory show that the originally proposed edge&#8208;to&#8208;face approach of TCNE to 1 is highly disfavored, whereas a stepwise mechanism involving the addition of TCNE at C2 to form a zwitterion followed by collapse at either C2&#8242; or C7&#8242; is energetically accessible. The Diels&#8208;Alder adduct is also formed in a stepwise reaction by competitive addition of TCNE at C4 of 1. These studies suggest that edge&#8208;to&#8208;face interactions are prohibitive in even the most favorable cases.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Antarafacial? No, suprafacial&lt;/b&gt;! The [14+2] cycloaddition of heptafulvalene with tetracyanoethylene has long been held as one of the only examples of an antarafacial cycloaddition. Experimental and computational studies demonstrate that it is not a concerted [14&#960;&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;+2&#960;&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;] process but instead a stepwise reaction that affords the &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-cycloadduct through suprafacial addition across the heptafulvalene ring system.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cycloaddition of heptafulvalene (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) with tetracyanoethylene (TCNE) was previously described as an example of an antarafacial cycloaddition, a [&#960;&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;+&#960;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;] process that afforded only the &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt; cycloadduct by virtue of the edge-to-face approach of TCNE, facilitated by the S shape of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;. The reaction has been investigated in depth and found not to be a concerted antarafacial process. At low temperature, the reaction is observed to give a mixture of &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt; cycloadducts as well as a [4+2] cycloadduct. The mixture of products is converted to the &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt; cycloadduct by equilibration upon warming to room temperature. Studies with diethyl 2,3-dicyanofumarate and -maleate confirmed the formation of &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt; cycloadducts. DFT studies at the M06-2X/6-311+G(2d,p) SCRF=acetone level of theory show that the originally proposed edge-to-face approach of TCNE to &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; is highly disfavored, whereas a stepwise mechanism involving the addition of TCNE at C2 to form a zwitterion followed by collapse at either C2&#8242; or C7&#8242; is energetically accessible. The Diels-Alder adduct is also formed in a stepwise reaction by competitive addition of TCNE at C4 of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;. These studies suggest that edge-to-face interactions are prohibitive in even the most favorable cases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Graphene&#8208;Enabled Electric&#8208;Field Regulation and Ionic Redistribution Around Lithiophilic Aurum Nanoparticles Toward a Dendrite&#8208;Free and 2000&#8208;Cycle&#8208;Life Lithium Metal Battery</title>

Graphene is conformally coated on the skeleton of Au@3D&#8722;Cu to form G&#8722;Au@3D&#8722;Cu, in which the conductive graphene layer not only decreases the local current intensity but also regulates the homogeneous redistribution of Li+ ions around lithiophilic Au nanoparticles. Benefiting from these merits, a dendrite&#8208;free and 2000&#8208;cycle&#8208;life LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2||G&#8722;Au@3D&#8722;Cu/Li full cell is proposed.







Abstract
Lithium metal batteries (LMBs) have attracted extensive attention owing to their high energy density. However, the uncontrolled volume changes and serious dendrite growth of the Li metal anode have hindered their commercialization. Herein, a three&#8208;dimensional Cu foam decorated with Au nanoparticles and conformal graphene layer was designed to tune the Li plating/stripping behaviors. The 3D&#8722;Cu conductive host anchored by lithiophilic Au nanoparticles can effectively alleviate the volume expansion caused by the continuous plating/stripping of Li and reduce the nucleation energy barrier. Notably, the conductive graphene not only facilitates the transfer of electrons, but also acts as an ionic rectifier, thereby avoiding the aggregation of local current density and Li+ ions around Au nanoparticles and enabling the uniform Li+ flux. As a result, the G&#8722;Au@3D&#8722;Cu/Li anode ensures the non&#8208;dendritic and homogeneous Li+ plating/stripping. Electrochemical results show that the symmetric G&#8722;Au@3D&#8722;Cu/Li cell delivers a low voltage hysteresis of 110&#8197;mV after 1000&#8197;h at 1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Matched with a layered LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 cathode, the NCM622||G&#8722;Au@3D&#8722;Cu/Li full cell exhibits a long cycle life of 2000 cycles and an ultra&#8208;low capacity decay rate (0.01&#8201;% per cycle).

         <title>Superacid&#8208;Mediated Late&#8208;Stage Aromatic Polydeuteration of Pharmaceuticals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 49, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The simpler the better: While most of the recent studies on late&#8208;stage aromatic polydeuteration focus on the design of metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation procedures, an easy&#8208;to&#8208;setup and broadly applicable method based on the use of superacidic TfOD has been developed that opens new perspectives for the preparation of deuterated drugs.







Abstract
The field of medicinal chemistry is currently witnessing a deuterium rush owing to the remarkable properties of this element as bioisoster of hydrogen atom. Aromatic hydrogen isotope exchange (HIE) is one of the most studied strategies nowadays as it promises to access deuterium&#8208;modified drugs directly from their non&#8208;labeled parents. While most of the recent studies focus on metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation strategy, the use of superacidic conditions has been largely overlooked. This study shows that the use of TfOD as reaction medium allows the late&#8208;stage polydeuteration of a broad library of pharmaceuticals bearing a wide array of functional groups, complementing existing procedures.

         <title>Tetrathienyl Corannulene Compounds with Highly Sensitive Photochromism</title>

Curves are ahead of the curve: Tetrathienyl corannulene compounds showed highly sensitive photochromism with a large molar absorption coefficient and a photocyclization quantum yield close to 1, although dithienyl phenanthrene compounds showed no photoreactivity. Such a high photoreactivity was rationalized by the predominance of the photoreactive atropisomers amplified by energy migration, and the curvature&#8208;induced short distance between photoreactive carbons.







Abstract
We have designed and synthesized photochromic tetrathienyl corannulene compounds, 1,2,7,8&#8208;tetrakis(2&#8208;methyl&#8208;5&#8208;phenylthiophen&#8208;3&#8208;yl)corannulene (1) and 1,2,7,8&#8208;tetrakis(2,4&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;5&#8208;phenylthiophen&#8208;3&#8208;yl)corannulene (2), by fusing two units of photochromic terarylene with a curved aromatic corannulene with a promising antenna effect. Compound 1 exhibited highly sensitive photoreactivity, with a large molar absorption coefficient of 8.2&#215;104&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and practically photon&#8208;quantitative photocyclization. On the other hand, a terarylene derivative with a planar aromatic phenanthrene, 9,10&#8208;bis(2,4&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;5&#8208;phenylthiophen&#8208;3&#8208;yl)phenanthrene (4) showed no photoreactivity. The reason for such a difference was attributed to the predominance of the photoreactive atropisomers amplified by energy migration, and the shortened distance between reactive carbons induced by the curved structure.

Abstract
Adjusting the RedOx activity of polyoxometalate catalysts is a key challenge for the catalysis of selective oxidation reactions. For this purpose, the possibility of influencing the RedOx potential by the introduction of an additional RedOx&#8208;active element was investigated. Thereby, Keggin&#8208;type polyoxometalates (POMs) with up to three different elements in the metal framework were created. An advanced and reproducible synthetic procedure to incorporate MnII and additionally VV into Keggin&#8208;type heteropolyacids alongside comprehensive characterization of the new molecules is presented. The success of our syntheses was confirmed by vibrational spectroscopy (IR and Raman) and elemental analysis. Furthermore, the new compounds were analyzed by NMR spectroscopy to investigate the characteristics of the POMs in solution. The structures of successfully crystalized compounds were determined by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Moreover, all synthesized compounds were characterized using UV/Vis spectroscopy and electrochemical analysis to get further insights into the electronic transfer processes and redox potentials.

Thereby, Keggin-type polyoxometalates (POMs) with up to three different elements in the metal framework were created. An advanced and reproducible synthetic procedure to incorporate Mn&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; and additionally V&lt;sup&gt;V&lt;/sup&gt; into Keggin-type heteropolyacids alongside comprehensive characterization of the new molecules is presented. The success of our syntheses was confirmed by vibrational spectroscopy (IR and Raman) and elemental analysis. Furthermore, the new compounds were analyzed by NMR spectroscopy to investigate the characteristics of the POMs in solution. The structures of successfully crystalized compounds were determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Moreover, all synthesized compounds were characterized using UV/Vis spectroscopy and electrochemical analysis to get further insights into the electronic transfer processes and redox potentials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

PVC&#8208;based solvent polymeric membranes uploaded on cellulose&#8208;based Color Catcher absorbent sheets were doped with a fluorescent chemosensor containing a polyamine unit decorated with the 2&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;3&#8208; naphthyl)&#8208;4&#8208;methylbenzoxazole (HNBO) fluorophore to develop user&#8208;friendly disposable all&#8208;solid&#8208;state devices for the selective detection of Mg2+ in real samples of commercial and tap drinking water, without the interference of Ca2+and other Alkali (A) and Alkaline&#8208;Earth (AE) metal ions.







Abstract
A new series of ligands containing the 2&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;3&#8208; naphthyl)&#8208;4&#8208;methylbenzoxazole (HNBO) fluorophore showed selectivity for Mg2+ ions, without the interference of Ca2+. The most promising representative L3 resulted the best performing sensor for Mg2+ both in solution and embedded in an all&#8208;solid&#8208;state optode, especially towards real samples of drinkable water.

CO2 capture and clean energy production technologies are stirring increasing interest due to the visible effects of global warming on our planet. In the background is a picture of a small lake in Lombardy, Italy, as it appeared in 2018. Novel imide/imine cages have shown promising results in the selective separation of CO2 from N2 and CH4 under vacuum swing adsorption conditions. The cages have also been successfully tested as fillers in mixed&#8208;matrix membranes. More information can be found in the Research Article by J.&#8197;C. Jansen, M. Carta, V. Amendola et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202201631).

         <title>Cover Feature: Tetrathienyl Corannulene Compounds with Highly Sensitive Photochromism (Chem. Eur. J. 49/2022)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 49, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tetrathienyl corannulene compounds showed highly sensitive photochromism with a large molar absorption coefficient and photocyclization quantum yield close to 1, although dithienyl phenanthrene compounds showed no photoreactivity. Such a high photoreactivity was rationalized by the predominance of the photoreactive atropisomers amplified by energy migration, and the curvature&#8208;induced short distance between photoreactive carbons. More information can be found in the Research Article by M. Yamada, T. Kawai, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202201286).

Electrochemical exfoliation of 2D phosphorene is a very promising approach that offers high yield, great efficiency, low cost, simple instrumentation, and excellent up&#8208;scalability. This Review article introduces the recent studies on preparation of 2D phosphorene sheets categorized by the intercalation ion employed. Moreover, the relationship between spalling conditions, potential mechanisms, and potential applications of exfoliated phosphorene is also included. The remaining challenges and promising directions of electrochemical exfoliation are then highlighted to provide clues for the practical application of phosphorene sheets. For more information, see the Review by C. Shu, W. Tang, X. Sun. et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202200857)

Synergistic catalysis offers the unique possibility of simultaneous activation of both the nucleophile and the electrophile in a reaction. This review discusses developments in aminocatalysis and its synergistic combination with other synthetic platforms published since 2015. Through the four sections, a critical overview of the most common systems involving amino&#8208;organo, amino&#8208;metal, amino&#8208;photoredox and amino&#8208;electrocatalysis is provided, with particular emphasis on HOMO&#8208;raising and LUMO&#8208;lowering strategies and asymmetric transformations. For more details, see the Review by F. Pesciaioli and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202200818)

Come together: Asymmetric aminocatalysis plays a pivotal role on the development in stereoselective transformations, synergistically combined with organo&#8208;, metal, photoredox and electrocatalysis. In this scenario, the HOMO&#8208;raising and LUMO&#8208;lowering activation of carbonyl compounds open new gateways to complex architectures and new sustainable reactivities. Last but not least, this research area will keep driving the development of the whole organocatalysis, toward its synergistic combination with other activation strategies.







Abstract
Synergistic catalysis offers the unique possibility of simultaneous activation of both the nucleophile and the electrophile in a reaction. A requirement for this strategy is the stability of the active species towards the reaction conditions and the two concerted catalytic cycles. Since the beginning of the century, aminocatalysis has been established as a platform for the stereoselective activation of carbonyl compounds through HOMO&#8208;raising or LUMO&#8208;lowering. The burgeoning era of aminocatalysis has been driven by a deep understanding of these activation and stereoinduction modes, thanks to the introduction of versatile and privileged chiral amines. The aim of this review is to cover recent developments in synergistic strategies involving aminocatalysis in combination with organo&#8208;, metal&#8208;, photo&#8208;, and electro&#8208;catalysis, focusing on the evolution of privileged aminocatalysts architectures.

This review presents concise and crucial studies of the recent and most representative developments in electrochemical exfoliation of two&#8208;dimensional phosphorene sheets, including the relationship between exfoliation philosophy, internal mechanisms, processing techniques, and multiple applications of phosphorene. Finally, we also offer our insight into their future challenges and opportunities.







Abstract
Recently, single or few&#8208;layer phosphorene has attracted intense attention due to its exceptional physicochemical properties. To this end, mass production of high&#8208;quality phosphorene nanosheets with specific functionalities represents a pivotal factor for the basic academic studies and practical applications. Among the current synthetic methods, electrochemical exfoliation of black phosphorous is one of the most hopeful ways for mass&#8208;production of phosphorene sheets owing to the uncomplicated apparatus, low cost as well as significant efficiency. Especially, regulating the electrochemical parameters not only induces adjustable phosphorene characteristics but also enables them a promising candidate in energy applications. In this Review, a concise and crucial studies of the recent and most representative developments in this domain was introduced, including the relationship between exfoliation philosophy, internal mechanisms, processing techniques, and multiple applications of phosphorene. At the end, a summary discussion and future perspectives is also provided.

         <title>Effective Charge Carrier Utilization of BiVO4 for Solar Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solar energy&#8208;driven overall water splitting (OWS) is an attractive way for generating green hydrogen. This review focuses on the current research status of BiVO4&#8208;constituted photo(electro)catalytic OWS systems, and summarizes the effective strategies for BiVO4 photo(electro)catalysts in a mainline of efficient charge utilization. It is hoped to provide comprehensive guidance for the construction of advanced solar OWS systems.







Abstract
Solar energy&#8208;driven overall water splitting (OWS) is an attractive way for generating clean and renewable green hydrogen. One key challenge is the construction of OWS systems with high solar energy conversion efficiencies, in which how to manipulate photoexcited charge carriers to efficiently participate in the reaction is the top priority. In recent years, bismuth vanadate (BiVO4) has emerged as one of the most promising materials for photo(electro)catalytic OWS and considerable progress has been achieved. In this review, recent advances of BiVO4&#8208;constituted OWS systems in both photoelectrocatalytic and photocatalytic approaches are presented in a mainline of effective charge carrier utilization. Various strategies for improved charge carrier utilization, including band structure engineering, improving charge separation, reducing charge recombination, and accelerating reaction kinetics, are summarized and analyzed in detail. Finally, perspective and outlook on further exploring the application potential of BiVO4 are proposed.

         <title>Infusion of Variable Chemical Structure to Tune Stacking among Metal&#8208;Organic Layers in 2D Nano MOF</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stacking is directly proportional to the thickness of 2D moieties. This study showed the tuning of stacking among metal&#8208;organic layers (MOLs) which leads to regulate the thickness of 2D stacked MOFs. Integration of variable chemical structs in linkers of MOFs, is found to be a crucial factor to tune the stacking trend.







Abstract
Thickness of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) govern their intriguing functionalities. Primarily this thickness is controlled by the stacking between the metal&#8208;organic layers (MOL). It is observed that until now such modulating factors for stacking efficiency of MOL are not well studied. Here, we report a fundamental hypothesis to comprehend regulation of stacking efficiency among MOLs as a function of chemical structure of organic ligands (dicarboxylic acids and pillar linkers). This basically involves a series of isostructural three&#8208;dimensional (3D) MOFs which contain linkers of variable chemical nature that could be depillared to generate 2D stacked MOFs of different thickness. Depending on the linkers, we encountered the formation of single MOL to stacked multiple MOLs as evidenced from atomic force microscopic and other experimental analysis.

     alt="Infusion of Variable Chemical Structure to Tune Stacking among Metal-Organic Layers in 2D Nano MOF"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Stacking is directly&lt;/b&gt; proportional to the thickness of 2D moieties. This study showed the tuning of stacking among metal-organic layers (MOLs) which leads to regulate the thickness of 2D stacked MOFs. Integration of variable chemical structs in linkers of MOFs, is found to be a crucial factor to tune the stacking trend.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thickness of two-dimensional (2D) metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) govern their intriguing functionalities. Primarily this thickness is controlled by the stacking between the metal-organic layers (MOL). It is observed that until now such modulating factors for stacking efficiency of MOL are not well studied. Here, we report a fundamental hypothesis to comprehend regulation of stacking efficiency among MOLs as a function of chemical structure of organic ligands (dicarboxylic acids and pillar linkers). This basically involves a series of isostructural three-dimensional (3D) MOFs which contain linkers of variable chemical nature that could be depillared to generate 2D stacked MOFs of different thickness. Depending on the linkers, we encountered the formation of single MOL to stacked multiple MOLs as evidenced from atomic force microscopic and other experimental analysis. The present study gives a concrete correlation between the stacking within 2D MOFs (from monolayer to multilayers), and their 3D counter parts, which may provide a thickness tuning pathway for 2D MOFs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>The synthesis and isolation of [Pd(NHC)(PhC&#8801;CPh)] complexes are reported. These new 14&#8208;electron Pd(0)&#8208;complexes are key synthons leading to known palladium(0) and palladium(II) species, as well as permitting access to&#160;&#160;unprecedented mixed NHC&#8208;phosphite palladium(0) complexes.This motif permits the facile catalytic hydrosilylation of allenes. DFT calculations have allowed to characterize the relatively weak interaction between the metal and the diphenylacetylene ligand, with a comparison with a series of ligands with more or less coordinating power, bearing varied structural and electronic effects.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, the two examples of La(III) based&#160;MOFs (rare earth based metal organic frameworks), Eu&#8208;ETTB and Gd&#8208;ETTB, were obtained by self&#8208;assembly. Both materials showed extremely high proton conductivity, where the proton conductivity value of Eu&#8208;ETTB was 1.53 &#215; 10&#8722;2 S/cm at 98% relative humidity (RH) and 85 &#176;C, while Gd&#8208;ETTB had a proton conductivity value of 2.63 &#215; 10&#8722;2 S/cm at 98% RH and 75 &#176;C. This was almost the best performance observed for three&#8208;dimensional porous MOFs without post&#8208;synthetic modification and was based on milder conditions than most materials. Furthermore, cycle test experiment and continuous work test showed that both materials had excellent performance both in terms of stability and durability. Water vapor adsorption experiment showed that a large number of water molecules are adsorbed, the hydrogen bond network was rebuilt by the adsorbed water molecules in the pore channel and optimized the channels for proton transfer, explained its high performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Influence of Sulfur Atoms on TADF Properties from Through&#8208;Space Charge Transfer Excited States</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The harnessing of heavy atom effect of chalcogen elements offers a way for boosting the thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) of purely organic luminescent materials that can harvest triplet excitons. However, the conformational and electronic variations induced by the heavy and large atoms may also have adverse effects on the TADF properties. Herein, the design, synthesis, and structures of a new type of through&#8208;space charge transfer (TSCT) emitters containing benzothiazino[2,&#8203;3,&#8203;4&#8208;&#8203;kl]&#8203;phenothiazine (DPTZ) as the donor unit are reported. The influences of S atoms on the emission properties have been systematically investigated by means of theoretical simulations, electrochemical and spectroscopic studies. Although the presence of &#960;&#8208;stacking interactions and calculated spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC) values are beneficial for TSCT&#8208;TADF properties, the triplet TSCT states are uplifted to above the locally excited LE state of the acceptor moieties. As a result, the new emitters display longer delayed fluorescence lifetimes (&#964;  DF  ) of 255.0&#8210;114.3 &#956;s and lower PLQYs of 45&#8210;61% in comparison with the O&#8208;containing congeners (&#964;  DF  = 26.9&#8210;6.8 &#956;s; PLQYs = 74&#8210;71%). This work highlights that a full consideration of various effects is essential when making use of heavy chalcogen atoms for the design of TADF emitters.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulating Oxygen Configuration in Hierarchically Porous Carbon Nanosheets for High&#8208;Rate and Durable Na+ Storage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Surface oxygen functionalities (particularly C&#8722;O configuration) in carbon materials have negative influence on their electrical conductivity and Na+ storage performance. Herein, we propose a concept from surface chemistry to regulate the oxygen configuration in hierarchically porous carbon nanosheets (HPCNS). It is demonstrated that the C&#8722;O/C=O ratio in HPCNS reduces from 1.49 to 0.43 and its graphitization degree increases by increasing the carbonization temperature under a reduction atmosphere. Remarkably, such high graphitization degree and low C&#8722;O content of the HPCNS&#8208;800 are favorable for promoting its electron/ion transfer kinetics, thus endowing it with high&#8208;rate (323.6 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.05 A g&#8722;1 and 138.5 mAh g&#8722;1 at 20.0 A g&#8722;1) and durable (96% capacity retention over 5700 cycles at 10.0 A g&#8722;1) Na+ storage performance. This work permits the optimization of heteroatom configurations in carbon for superior Na+ storage.</dc:description>

         <title>Fabrication of Highly Luminescent and Thermally Stable Phosphors through In&#8208;Situ Formation of BaSO4 on Sulfur Nanodots</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly luminescent and thermally stable hybrid phosphors of sulfur nanodots@BaSO4 were fabricated through an in&#8197;situ precipitation method. Sulfur nanodots are incorporated in the matrix of BaSO4, and BaSO4 provides passivation effect for surface ligands or traps, resulting in the promotion of photoluminescence quantum yield from 23&#8201;% to 58&#8201;%, and the BaSO4 matrix also leads to promotion of thermal stability.







Abstract
Producing high performance phosphors using abundant and non&#8208;toxic precursors yet straightforward methods are promising but still a challenging task. Herein, highly luminescent and thermally stable phosphors were fabricated through an in&#8197;situ precipitation synthesis strategy. Sulfur nanodots (S&#8208;dots) act as the precursors for precipitation reactions and also provide the luminescent centers. Structural and optical characterization investigations suggest that S&#8208;dots are incorporated in the matrix of BaSO4, and BaSO4 provides passivation effect for the surface ligands or traps of S&#8208;dots. This results in the promotion of photoluminescence quantum yield from 23&#8201;% to 58&#8201;%, and the BaSO4 matrix also leads to the obvious promotion of thermal stability. These merits endow the construction of phosphor&#8208;based light&#8208;emitting diodes by utilizing the S&#8208;dots@BaSO4 hybrid phosphors as a color conversion layer. These research results are significant for developing sulfur&#8208;based luminescent materials, and also provide a solid and universal theory to produce high quality phosphors.

     alt="Fabrication of Highly Luminescent and Thermally Stable Phosphors through In-Situ Formation of BaSO4 on Sulfur Nanodots"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Highly luminescent and thermally stable hybrid phosphors of sulfur nanodots@BaSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; were fabricated through an in&#8197;situ precipitation method. Sulfur nanodots are incorporated in the matrix of BaSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, and BaSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; provides passivation effect for surface ligands or traps, resulting in the promotion of photoluminescence quantum yield from 23&#8201;% to 58&#8201;%, and the BaSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; matrix also leads to promotion of thermal stability.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Producing high performance phosphors using abundant and non-toxic precursors yet straightforward methods are promising but still a challenging task. Herein, highly luminescent and thermally stable phosphors were fabricated through an in&#8197;situ precipitation synthesis strategy. Sulfur nanodots (S-dots) act as the precursors for precipitation reactions and also provide the luminescent centers. Structural and optical characterization investigations suggest that S-dots are incorporated in the matrix of BaSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, and BaSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; provides passivation effect for the surface ligands or traps of S-dots. This results in the promotion of photoluminescence quantum yield from 23&#8201;% to 58&#8201;%, and the BaSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; matrix also leads to the obvious promotion of thermal stability. These merits endow the construction of phosphor-based light-emitting diodes by utilizing the S-dots@BaSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; hybrid phosphors as a color conversion layer. These research results are significant for developing sulfur-based luminescent materials, and also provide a solid and universal theory to produce high quality phosphors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Cross&#8208;Coupling of Thioesters and Organomanganese Reagents
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article discloses the development of an iron(III)&#8208;catalyzed coupling of thioesters with aliphatic organomanganese reagents. The good functional group tolerance resulted in successful transformation of a range of thioesters, including biologically relevant compounds. The presence of accessible &#946;&#8208;hydrogen atom in the organomanganese reagent seems crucial for an effective catalyst activation. The liberated thiolate stabilizes the generated alkylferrate(II) species.







Abstract
We report a Fukuyama&#8208;type coupling of thioesters with aliphatic organomanganese reagents utilizing a cheap and easily available iron(III) precatalyst. The reactions exhibit a wide tolerance of solvents and functional groups, allowing for the conversion of thioesters derived from natural products and pharmaceutical compounds. A strong steric impact from each reaction component (carboxylic moiety, thiol substituent and manganese reagent) was displayed, which enabled regioselective transformation of dithioesters. Mechanistic investigations showed that the released thiolate does not act as a mere spectator ligand, but rather positively influences the stability of intermediate alkyl(II)ferrates.

The transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free method is applicable across a diverse array of readily accessible substrates, accessing a broad range of synthetically useful products containing versatile stereodefined internal alkenes. Synthetic and computational mechanistic studies indicate that the isomerization proceeds along competing 1,2&#8208;hydride shift and hydride abstraction pathways.

         <title>Influence of the Intramolecular Hydrogen Bond on the Fluorescence of 2&#8208;ortho&#8208;Aminophenyl Pyridines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intramolecular hydrogen bonds play an important role in the fluorescence of 2&#8208;ortho&#8208;aminophenyl pyridines, shifting the emission colour from deep blue to cold white. These multi&#8208;emissive dynamic systems bearing excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) moieties are susceptible to pH. The cover feature illustrates how DFT and td&#8208;DFT calculations can elucidate why different levels of protonation lead to different emission colours. Photochemists are depicted as sailing through the waves of a spectrum. More information can be found in the Research Article by A.&#8197;M.&#8197;S. Silva, S. Guieu, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202201844).

         <title>Heterobimetallic Gold/Ruthenium Complexes Synthesized via Post&#8208;functionalization and Applied in Dual Photoredox Gold Catalysis</title>

Acting in concert: Novel heterobimetallic AuI/RuII complexes synthesized in a Diels&#8208;Alder reaction are reported. The applied post&#8208;functionalization strategy allows which isomer is obtained to be controlled. Their application as catalysts in carbon&#8208;phosphorus cross&#8208;coupling showed that the dinuclear complexes can outperform their monometallic counterparts







Abstract
The synthesis of heterobimetallic AuI/RuII complexes of the general formula syn&#8208; and anti&#8208;[{AuCl}(L1&#8745;L2){Ru(bpy)2}][PF6]2 is reported. The ditopic bridging ligand L1&#8745;L2 refers to a P,N hybrid ligand composed of phosphine and bipyridine substructures, which was obtained via a post&#8208;functionalization strategy based on Diels&#8208;Alder reaction between a phosphole and a maleimide moiety. It was found that the stereochemistry at the phosphorus atom of the resulting 7&#8208;phosphanorbornene backbone can be controlled by executing the metal coordination and the cycloaddition reaction in a different order. All precursors, as well as the mono&#8208; and multimetallic complexes, were isolated and fully characterized by various spectroscopic methods such as NMR, IR, and UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy as well as cyclic voltammetry. Photophysical measurements show efficient phosphorescence for the investigated monometallic complex anti&#8208;[(L1&#8745;L2){Ru(bpy)2}][PF6]2 and the bimetallic analogue syn&#8208;[{AuCl}(L1&#8745;L2){Ru(bpy)2}][PF6]2, thus indicating a small influence of the {AuCl} fragment on the photoluminescence properties. The heterobimetallic AuI/RuII complexes syn&#8208; and anti&#8208;[{AuCl}(L1&#8745;L2){Ru(bpy)2}][PF6]2 are both active catalysts in the P&#8208;arylation of aryldiazonium salts promoted by visible light with H&#8208;phosphonate affording arylphosphonates in yields of up to 91&#8201;%. Both dinuclear complexes outperform their monometallic counterparts.

         <dc:description>
A chiral bis(phosphine) monooxide (BPMO) derived from a C2&#8208;symmetric bis(phosphine) ligand does magic to the copper&#8208;catalyzed conjugate borylation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;disubstituted cyclobutenones. Yields and levels of stereoselection, especially enantioselectivity, are exceedingly high (see scheme).







Abstract
Chiral bis(phosphine) monooxides (BPMOs) derived from C2&#8208;symmetric bis(phosphines) have been found to induce superior levels of enantioselection in copper&#8208;catalyzed conjugate borylation of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;disubstituted cyclobutenones. More precisely, enantiomeric excesses as well as chemical yields are exceedingly high with (R,R)&#8208;Bozphos as the chiral ligand while these values are low with parent (R,R)&#8208;Me&#8208;Duphos. A similar yet less pronounced effect was seen in the corresponding 1,6&#8208;addition to para&#8208;quinone methides.

A transition metal&#8208;free method for the trans&#8208;hydroboration of 1,3&#8208;diynes to afford (E)&#8208;1&#8208;boryl&#8208;1,3&#8208;enynes is reported. Boron adds to the external carbon of the diyne framework. Experimental and DFT studies suggest that phosphine attack on the diyne is a key step in the catalytic cycle.







Abstract
We report a transition metal&#8208;free, regio&#8208; and stereo&#8208;selective, phosphine&#8208;catalyzed method for the trans hydroboration of 1,3&#8208;diynes with pinacolborane that affords (E)&#8208;1&#8208;boryl&#8208;1,3&#8208;enynes. The reaction proceeds with excellent selectivity for boron addition to the external carbon of the 1,3&#8208;diyne framework as unambiguously established by NMR and X&#8208;ray crystallographic studies. The reaction displays a broad substrate scope including unsymmetrical diynes to generate products in high yield (up to 95&#8201;%). Experimental and theoretical studies suggest that phosphine attack on the alkyne is a key process in the catalytic cycle.

Experimental and theoretical studies suggest that phosphine attack on the alkyne is a key process in the catalytic cycle.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Metalloenzyme&#8208;Mediated Thiol&#8208;Yne Addition Towards Photoisomerizable Fluorescent Dyes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A regioselective metalloenzyme&#8208;directed synthesis of a vinyl sulfide&#8208;based inhibitor, which has shown to be involved in an unexpected Z to E photoisomerization process, is reported. Tuning of the spectral features guided by theoretical studies revealed structural modifications for effective bidirectional photoconversion of thermally bistable vinyl sulfide diastereoisomers, while maintaining the high biological activity of the parent inhibitor.







Abstract
Proteins are able to irreversibly assemble biologically active ligands from building blocks bearing complementary reactive functions due their spatial proximity, through a kinetic target&#8208;guided synthetic process (also named in&#8197;situ click chemistry). Although linkages thus formed are mostly passive, some of them have shown to significantly contribute to the protein binding through for instance hydrogen bonding and stacking interactions. Biocompatible reactions and click chemistry are a formidable source of inspiration for developing such new protein&#8208;directed ligations. This study reports a proximity&#8208;induced thiol&#8208;yne synthesis of carbonic anhydrase inhibitors. Not only this example widens the arsenal of kinetic target&#8208;guided synthesis (KTGS) eligible reactions, but the obtained product displayed unsuspected photophysical properties. The corresponding vinyl sulfide linkage conjugated to a coumarin core proved to be engaged in a monodirectional Z to E photoisomerization process. Further investigations guided by theoretical calculations showed that fine&#8208;tuning of the nature of the substituents on the coumarin moiety allows to obtain a bidirectional photochemical process, thus discovering a new photoswitching moiety, displaying moreover fluorescence properties. Due to the spectral tunability of coumarin derivatives, this work should open new opportunities for the design of vinyl sulfide&#8208;based photoswitch systems with modular photophysical properties.

         <title>Synthesis of Cage&#8208;Shaped Borates Bearing Pyrenylmethyl Groups: Efficient Lewis Acid Catalyst for Photoactivated Glycosylations Driven by Intramolecular Excimer Formation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cage&#8208;shaped borate 3aB having pyrenylmethyl groups was synthesized. The obtained 3aB functioned as a photoactivated Lewis acid catalyst. The photoactivation originates from the deformation of the cage&#8208;shaped scaffold driven by intramolecular excimer formations of the pyrenes, allowing the catalytic O&#8208;glycosylation using glycosyl fluorides to proceed with a high efficiency.







Abstract
We describe the synthesis and characterization of a photoactivated boron&#8208;based Lewis acid catalyst based on a cage&#8208;shaped triphenolic ligand with three pyrenylmethyl moieties. The obtained cage&#8208;shaped borate functioned as a photoactivated Lewis acid catalyst thanks to the flexible three pyrenylmethyl moieties. The deformation of the cage&#8208;shaped scaffold driven by intramolecular excimer formations of the pyrenes is a critical factor in realizing the photoactivation. Mannich&#8208;type reactions and glycosylations significantly were accelerated under 370&#8197;nm light irradiations. It is noteworthy that various glycosyl fluorides, which are not easily activated in photocatalytic systems due to their high C&#8722;F bond stability, are activated by the photoimproved catalytic activity of the catalyst.

         <title>Controlling Electronic Events Through Rational Structural Design in Subphthalocyanine&#8211;Corrole Dyads: Synthesis, Characterization, and Photophysical Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of covalently linked subphthalocyanine&#8211;corrole (SubPc&#8208;Cor) dyads have been prepared. In four of the reported examples, Cor.+&#8208;SubPc.&#8722; charge&#8208;separated states have been observed, whereas in the case of the electron&#8208;rich SubPc and the electron&#8208;deficient Cor dyad, only energy transfer has been detected.







Abstract
Porphyrinoids are considered perfect candidates for their incorporation into electron donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) arrays due to their remarkable optoelectronic properties and low reorganization energies. For the first time, a series of subphthalocyanine (SubPc) and corrole (Cor) were covalently connected through a short&#8208;range linkage. SubPc axial substitution strategies were employed, which allowed the synthesis of the target molecules in decent yields. In this context, a qualitative synthetic approach was performed to reverse the expected direction of the different electronic events. Consequently, in&#8208;depth absorption, fluorescence, and electrochemical assays enabled the study of electronic and photophysical properties. Charge separation was observed in cases of electron&#8208;donating Cors, whereas a quantitative energy transfer from the Cor to the SubPc was detected in the case of electron accepting Cors.

         <title>Synthesis of Metal Chalcogenide Semiconductors by Thermal Decomposition of Organosulfur and Organoselenium Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A scalable and facile solid&#8208;state synthesis method using thiourea has been investigated to obtain chalcogenide semiconductors, such as CdSxSe1&#8208;x solid solution. Thiourea was found to work as a molten reaction medium at moderate temperature, although it leaves organic residues in the solid phase.







Abstract
Metal chalcogenides &#8211; because of their excellent optical and electrical properties &#8211; are important semiconductor materials for optical devices, such as solar cells, sensors, and photocatalysts. The challenges associated with metal chalcogenides are the complexity of the conventional synthesis methods and the stringent synthesis conditions. In this study, the synthesis conditions were simplified in a solvent&#8208;free synthesis method using cadmium precursor, thiourea and selenium to synthesize metal chalcogenides, such as CdS and CdSe, which have particularly suitable band gaps for the optical devices. CdSxSe1&#8208;x solid solution was successfully synthesized under molten thiourea as the reactive reaction medium at relatively low temperatures, even at 180&#8201;&#176;C, with residual melamine derivatives in the solid phase. The luminescence properties of CdSxSe1&#8208;x and the products in the gas and solid phases were investigated. Optimization of the synthesis conditions for solid solutions of CdSxSe1&#8208;x and the role of organic compounds in the formation of metal chalcogenides are discussed.

         <title>Catalysis by [Ga4L6]12&#8722; Metallocage on the Nazarov Cyclization: The Basicity of Complexed Alcohol is Key</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Nazarov cyclization process performed inside a metallocage is much faster than in solution. This is mainly due to the change of basicity of the substrate (an alcohol) once encapsulated.







Abstract
The Nazarov cyclization is investigated in solution and within K12[Ga4L6] supramolecular organometallic cage by means of computational methods. The reaction needs acidic condition in solution but works at neutral pH in the presence of the metallocage. The reaction steps for the process are analogous in both media: (a) protonation of the alcohol group, (b) water loss and (c) cyclization. The relative Gibbs energies of all the steps are affected by changing the environment from solvent to the metallocage. The first step in the mechanism, the alcohol protonation, turns out to be the most critical one for the acceleration of the reaction inside the metallocage. In order to calculate the relative stability of protonated alcohol inside the cavity, we propose a computational scheme for the calculation of basicity for species inside cavities and can be of general use. These results are in excellent agreement with the experiments, identifying key steps of catalysis and providing an in&#8208;depth understanding of the impact of the metallocage on all the reaction steps.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Nazarov cyclization is investigated in solution and within K&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;[Ga&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;L&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;] supramolecular organometallic cage by means of computational methods. The reaction needs acidic condition in solution but works at neutral pH in the presence of the metallocage. The reaction steps for the process are analogous in both media: (a) protonation of the alcohol group, (b) water loss and (c) cyclization. The relative Gibbs energies of all the steps are affected by changing the environment from solvent to the metallocage. The first step in the mechanism, the alcohol protonation, turns out to be the most critical one for the acceleration of the reaction inside the metallocage. In order to calculate the relative stability of protonated alcohol inside the cavity, we propose a computational scheme for the calculation of basicity for species inside cavities and can be of general use. These results are in excellent agreement with the experiments, identifying key steps of catalysis and providing an in-depth understanding of the impact of the metallocage on all the reaction steps.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bioorthogonal Click of Colloidal Gold Nanoparticles to Antibodies In vivo</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combining nanotechnology and bioorthogonal chemistry. Due to their size, nanomedicines target tumors passively. Whereas bioorthogonal chemistry allows for a pretargeting approach. Herein, we demonstrate &#8208; for the first time &#8208; the possibility to successfully ligate Tz&#8208;AuNPs in&#8197;vivo to pretargeted monoclonal antibodies.







Abstract
Combining nanotechnology and bioorthogonal chemistry for theranostic strategies offers the possibility to develop next generation nanomedicines. These materials are thought to increase therapeutic outcome and improve current cancer management. Due to their size, nanomedicines target tumors passively. Thus, they can be used for drug delivery purposes. Bioorthogonal chemistry allows for a pretargeting approach. Higher target&#8208;to&#8208;background drug accumulation ratios can be achieved. Pretargeting can also be used to induce internalization processes or trigger controlled drug release. Colloidal gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) have attracted widespread interest as drug delivery vectors within the last decades. Here, we demonstrate for the first time the possibility to successfully ligate AuNPs in&#8197;vivo to pretargeted monoclonal antibodies. We believe that this possibility will facilitate the development of AuNPs for clinical use and ultimately, improve state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art patient care.

         <title>Cationic Gold(II) Complexes: Experimental and Theoretical Study
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gilded gases: Gold(II) complexes are rare, and a little is known about their properties. We have generated gaseous gold(II) halido complexes from their gold(III) precursors with various auxiliary ligands and investigated them by helium&#8208;tagging infrared and visible photodissociation spectroscopy. The structure of the complexes was described by DFT calculations benchmarked by comparison with the experimental data.







Abstract
Gold(II) complexes are rare, and their application to the catalysis of chemical transformations is underexplored. The reason is their easy oxidation or reduction to more stable gold(III) or gold(I) complexes, respectively. We explored the thermodynamics of the formation of [AuII(L)(X)]+ complexes (L=ligand, X=halogen) from the corresponding gold(III) precursors and investigated their stability and spectral properties in the IR and visible range in the gas phase. The results show that the best ancillary ligands L for stabilizing gaseous [AuII(L)(X)]+ complexes are bidentate and tridentate ligands with nitrogen donor atoms. The electronic structure and spectral properties of the investigated gold(II) complexes were correlated with quantum chemical calculations. The results show that the molecular and electronic structure of the gold(II) complexes as well as their spectroscopic properties are very similar to those of analogous stable copper(II) complexes.

         <title>Molecularly Imprinted Nanozymes with Free Substrate Access for Catalyzing the Ligation of ssDNA Sequences</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reverse microemulsion template docking surface imprinting (RMTD&#8208;SI) is proposed as an approach to prepare nanozyme for the ligation of ssDNA. For two short ssDNA substrates that are half&#8208;complementary to the imprinted cavity, good catalytic activity and specificity towards substrate ssDNA were achieved. In addition, the prepared nanozyme allowed the ligation of a ssDNA substrate fully matched with the imprinted cavity with other ssDNA substrates, generating longer ssDNA sequences. Thus, the RMTD&#8208;SI approach opens a new avenue to the preparation of molecularly imprinted nanozymes.







Abstract
Nanozymes have attracted wide attention for the unique advantages of low cost, high stability and designability. Molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) have demonstrated great potential as a new type of nanozymes due to their excellent specificity and high affinity. However, effective approaches for creating molecularly imprinted nanozymes still remain limited. Herein, reverse microemulsion template docking surface imprinting (RMTD&#8208;SI) is reported as a new approach for the rational design and engineering of nanozymes with free substrate access for the ligation of ssDNA sequences. As a proof of the principle, octa&#8208;deoxyribonucleotide&#8208;imprinted nanoparticles were successfully prepared. Using tetradeoxyribonucleotides and octa&#8208;deoxyribonucleotide as substrates, the properties, catalytic activity and behavior of the imprinted nanoparticles were thoroughly investigated. The imprinted nanozyme exhibited an enhanced reaction speed (by up to 41&#8208;fold) and good sequence selectivity towards substrate tetra&#8208;deoxyribonucleotides. More interestingly, due to the open substrate access, the imprinted nanozyme also allowed the ligation of a ssDNA that fully matched with the imprinted cavity and other ssDNA substrates to form longer sequences, but at the price of substrate selectivity. Thus, this study provides not only a new avenue to the rational design and synthesis of molecularly imprinted nanozymes but also new insights of their catalytic behavior.

         <title>Mechanistic and Kinetic Investigations of ON/OFF (Photo)Switchable Binding of Carbon Monoxide by Chromium(0), Molybdenum(0) and Tungsten(0) Carbonyl Complexes with a Pyridyl&#8208;Mesoionic Carbene Ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Kinetic and mechanistic investigations of the photo&#8208;induced reversible binding and release of CO to Cr0, Mo0 and W0 complexes with pyridyl&#8208;mesoionic carbene ligands ([LM(CO)4]) are reported. Irradiation of the complexes in the solid state at 10&#8197;K leads to a FTIR spectroscopically detectable intermediate [LM(CO)3] without ligand&#8211;sphere reorganization. In solution, clean conversion to a stable photoproduct [LM(CO)3Xaxial] (X=MeCN, BuCN, Py) is observed. The photodissociation quantum yield increases from W0 via Mo0 to Cr0 up to 46&#8201;%. It is remarkable that there is a fully reversible CO exchange, especially as the reverse recombination reaction with the solvated CO can take hours (Cr&#8810;Mo&lt;W); this opens a new field of highly selective (photo)switchable transition metal complexes. More information can be found in the Research Article by G. Niedner&#8208;Schatteburg, B. Sarkar, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202201038).

         <title>SMM Behaviour of the Butterfly {CrIII2DyIII2} Pivalate Complex and Magneto&#8208;structurally Correlated Relaxation Thermal Barrier</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a new pivalate butterfly {CrIII2LnIII2} system with magnetization tunneling relaxation suppresion and hysteresis opening up to 3.6&#8197;K in the Ln=Dy complex, due to Cr&#8722;Dy exchange interaction. We have found a magneto&#8208;structural correlation between the Orbach thermal barrier for magentization reversal and the mean Cr&#8722;Dy bond lenght across all literature reported butterfly {CrIII2DyIII2} complexes.







Abstract
We are reporting the synthesis, single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structure characterization, and magnetic property investigations of the pivalate butterfly {CrIII2LnIII2} complexes with Ln= Gd and Dy and the isostructural Y(III) sample. We found an anti&#8208;ferromagnetic Cr(III)&#8208;Ln(III) exchange interaction, which, as previously observed in related Cr(III)/Ln(III) systems, plays a key role in suppressing quantum tunnelling of magnetization and enhances the SMM performance in the Dy(III) complex. In fact, a pure Orbach relaxation mechanism, with absence of QT regime, is observed with a thermal barrier of 50&#8197;cm&#8722;1, leading to magnetization hysteresis opening, measured with a commercial magnetometer, up to 3.6&#8197;K with a coercive field of 2.9&#8197;T. Analysis of SMM behaviour in literature&#8208;known butterfly {CrIII2DyIII2} complexes, reveals the existence of a magneto&#8208;structural correlation between Ueff, the thermal barrier size, and the mean Cr&#8722;Dy bond distances. Moreover, a clear correlation is found for the thermal barrier magnitude and the maximum temperature hysteresis opening and coercive field.

         <title>Phosphine&#8208;Functionalized Syndiotactic Polystyrenes: Synthesis and Application to Immobilization of Transition Metal Nanoparticle Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel phosphine&#8208;functionalized syndiotactic polystyrenes composed of o&#8208;diphenylphosphinostyrene and styrene alternating copolymer block and syndiotactic polystyrene block prepared by the copolymerization of o&#8208;diphenylphosphinostyrene with styrene using (C5Me4SiMe3)Sc(CH2C6H4NMe2&#8208;o)2 showed not only thermal stability and chemical (solvent) resistance, but also excellent performance of immobilization of transition metal nanoparticle catalysts.







Abstract
The precise control of monomer sequence and stereochemistry in copolymerization is of much interest and importance for the synthesis of high performance materials, but studies toward this goal have met with only limited success to date. The coordination polymerization of diphenylphosphinostyrene (p&#8208;StPPh2 and o&#8208;StPPh2) and its copolymerization with styrene (St) by (C5Me4SiMe3)Sc(CH2C6H4NMe2&#8208;o)2 have been achieved for the first time to afford a new series of phosphine functionalized syndiotactic polystyrene. By the design of the polymer structure, the copolymer of o&#8208;StPPh2 and St (poly(o&#8208;StPPh2&#8208;alt&#8208;St)&#8208;b&#8208;sPS) containing o&#8208;StPPh2 and St atactic alternating copolymer block and syndiotactic polystyrene block (sPS) showed excellent thermal stability and chemical resistance. The simple combination of the triphenylphosphine and syndiotactic polystyrene realized the stable immobilization of metal nanoparticles to afford highly robust metal@poly(o&#8208;StPPh2&#8208;alt&#8208;St)&#8208;b&#8208;sPS nanocatalysts at high temperature and various atmospheres. The Cu@poly(o&#8208;StPPh2&#8208;alt&#8208;St)&#8208;b&#8208;sPS catalyst can serve as a highly efficient heterogeneous catalyst for the synthesis of quinoline derivatives by acceptorless dehydrogenative coupling of o&#8208;aminobenzylalcohol with ketones.

         <title>The Importance of Mg2+&#8208;Free State in Nucleotide Exchange of Oncogenic K&#8208;Ras Mutants</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Systematic structural and dynamic analysis of wildtype K&#8208;Ras and its selected oncogenic mutations (G12C, G12D, and G12V) provides insight into mutation&#8208; and nucleotide&#8208;specific differences aiding the development of allosteric inhibitors targeting K&#8208;Ras signalling, in particular, the K&#8208;Ras&#8208;Sos interaction.







Abstract
For efficient targeting of oncogenic K&#8208;Ras interaction sites, a mechanistic picture of the Ras&#8208;cycle is necessary. Herein, we used NMR relaxation techniques and molecular dynamics simulations to decipher the role of slow dynamics in wild&#8208;type and three oncogenic P&#8208;loop mutants of K&#8208;Ras. Our measurements reveal a dominant two&#8208;state conformational exchange on the ms timescale in both GDP&#8208; and GTP&#8208;bound K&#8208;Ras. The identified low&#8208;populated higher energy state in GDP&#8208;loaded K&#8208;Ras has a conformation reminiscent of a nucleotide&#8208;bound/Mg2+&#8208;free state characterized by shortened &#946;2/&#946;3&#8208;strands and a partially released switch&#8208;I region preparing K&#8208;Ras for the interaction with the incoming nucleotide exchange factor and subsequent reactivation. By providing insight into mutation&#8208;specific differences in K&#8208;Ras structural dynamics, our systematic analysis improves our understanding of prolonged K&#8208;Ras signaling and may aid the development of allosteric inhibitors targeting nucleotide exchange in K&#8208;Ras.

This one&#8208;step, chloride promoter&#8208;free methodology provides access to so far inaccessible, yet highly desirable strongly Lewis acidic fluorosulfoxonium cations from electron&#8208;deficient and/or sterically demanding sulfoxides that are shown to be practically unreactive towards the previously reported XeF2/NEt4Cl system. Experimental and density functional theory studies have been conducted to assess the Lewis acidities of the prepared sulfur(VI) cations.

         <title>Functional Liquid Crystal Elastomers Based on Dynamic Covalent Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of advanced liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) with dynamic nature is of paramount significance for a new generation of "smart" applications such as soft robotics, 3D/4D printing, adaptive camouflage, and beyond. The marriage with emerging dynamic covalent chemistry (DCC) is known to endow the LCEs with exciting functional behaviors, hardly seen in ordinary LCEs, such as reprogramming, reprocessing, chemical recycling, and self&#8208;healing properties. In this review, we address a systematic overview of LCEs based on DCC, starting with a brief introduction to the structural properties of traditional LCEs and their conventional synthetic chemistries. Emphasis is then on the chemistry of the dynamic covalent bonds (DCBs) so far found in LCEs, focusing on the exchangeable reaction mechanisms, alignment fundamentals, and the influence of composition and topology of the polymer LCE system on their ultimate dynamic properties. Finally, future challenges and opportunities in the development of promising dynamic LCEs and their potential applications are discussed. This review is expected to provide new insights into the development of intelligent liquid crystalline materials that embraces chemistry, nanoscience, materials science, device engineering, and nanotechnology.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamic Timing Control of Molecular Photoluminescent Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dynamic control of molecular photoluminescence offers chemical solutions for designing functional emissive materials. Although stimuli&#8208;switchable molecular luminescent systems have been well established, it remains challenging how to encode these dynamic emissive systems in a &#8220;timing&#8221; manner, i.e., time&#8208;dependent luminescent properties. This Concept aims at summarizing the design principles of dynamic timing molecular photoluminescent systems by discussing the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art progresses of this topic and shaping the fabrication strategies at both molecular and supramolecular levels. Outlook and perspectives are given to outline the future opportunities and challenges on the rational design and potential applications of these smart emissive systems.</dc:description>

         <title>The Alkynylative Difunctionalization of Alkenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The alkynylative difunctionalization of alkenes is one of the most straightforward and efficient strategies for preparing useful alkynyl&#8208;containing compounds and so has made great progress in recent years. This review comprehensively summarized the alkynylative difunctionalization of alkenes. For more information, see the Review by J. Huang and Z.&#8208;M. Chen (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202201519).







Abstract
Given alkynyl group is an important functional unit, a variety of efficient methods have been developed to construct alkynyl&#8208;containing compounds. Among them, the alkynylative difunctionalization of alkenes is one of the most straightforward and efficient strategies for preparing these compounds and so has made great progress in recent years, including the catalytic asymmetric manner. However, there is no comprehensive review to summarize these studies. This review is aimed at comprehensively summarizing the alkynylative difunctionalization of alkenes, which is presented in terms of alkynylation&#8208;initiated and alkynylation&#8208;terminated difunctionalizations of alkenes. We hope that this review will help to encourage more researchers to further explore in this field.

         <title>Two Paths to Oxidative C&#8722;H Amination Under Basic Conditions: A Theoretical Case Study Reveals Hidden Opportunities Provided by Electron Upconversion

Exploring the possibilities of an odd&#8208;electron bond formation under basic and oxidative conditions in silico: How radical&#8208;anion bond formation and electron upconversion allow for milder oxidative conditions.







Abstract
Traditionally, cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling (CDC) leads to C&#8722;N bond formation under basic and oxidative conditions and is proposed to proceed via a two&#8208;electron bond formation mediated by carbenium ions. However, the formation of such high&#8208;energy intermediates is only possible in the presence of strong oxidants, which may lead to undesired side reactions and poor functional group tolerance. In this work we explore if oxidation under basic conditions allows the formation of three&#8208;electron bonds (resulting in &#8220;upconverted&#8221; highly&#8208;reducing radical&#8208;anions). The benefit of this &#8220;upconversion&#8221; process is in the ability to use milder oxidants (e.&#8201;g., O2) and to avoid high&#8208;energy intermediates. Comparison of the two&#8208; and three&#8208;electron pathways using quantum mechanical calculations reveals that not only does the absence of a strong oxidant shut down two&#8208;electron pathways in favor of a three&#8208;electron path but, paradoxically, weaker oxidants react faster with the upconverted reductants by avoiding the inverted Marcus region for electron transfer.

         <title>Interplay and Competition Between Two Different Types of Redox&#8208;Active Ligands in Cobalt Complexes: How to Allocate the Electrons?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular transition metal complexes with two different types of redox&#8208;active ligands are uncommon. Herein, the synthesis of the first mono&#8208; and dinuclear cobalt complexes is reported which exhibit redox&#8208;active oxolene&#8208;type ligands in combination with redox&#8208;active bisguanidine/urea azine ligands, representing four or six center redox systems. Radical ligands are present in all complexes; the differences in the electronic structures lead to characteristic magnetic and optical properties.







Abstract
The field of molecular transition metal complexes with redox&#8208;active ligands is dominated by compounds with one or two units of the same redox&#8208;active ligand; complexes in which different redox&#8208;active ligands are bound to the same metal are uncommon. This work reports the first molecular coordination compounds in which redox&#8208;active bisguanidine or urea azine (biguanidine) ligands as well as oxolene ligands are bound to the same cobalt atom. The combination of two different redox&#8208;active ligands leads to mono&#8208; as well as unprecedented dinuclear cobalt complexes, being multiple (four or six) center redox systems with intriguing electronic structures, all exhibiting radical ligands. By changing the redox potential of the ligands through derivatisation, the electronic structure of the complexes could be altered in a rational way.

         <title>&#960;&#8208;Extended Pleiadienes by [5+2] Annulation of 1&#8208;Boraphenalenes and ortho&#8208;Dihaloarenes</title>

         <dc:description>
Intrigued by their (anti)aromaticity and expected negative curvature, a series of &#960;&#8208;extended pleiadienes has been synthesized by palladium&#8208;catalyzed [5+2] annulation. Their structural, redox and optical properties were probed and further investigated by theoretical calculations.







Abstract
Palladium&#8208;catalyzed [5+2] annulation of 1&#8208;boraphenalenes with ortho&#8208;dihaloarenes afforded negatively curved &#960;&#8208;extended pleiadienes. Two benzo[1,2&#8208;i:4,5&#8208;i&#8217;]dipleiadienes (BDPs) featuring a seven&#8208;six&#8208;seven&#8208;membered ring arrangement were synthesized and investigated. Their crystal structure revealed a unique packing arrangement and theoretical calculations were employed to shed light onto the dynamic behavior of the BDP moiety and its aromaticity. Further, a naphthalene&#8208;fused pleiadiene was stitched together by oxidative cyclodehydrogenation to yield an additional five&#8208;membered ring. This formal azulene moiety led to distinct changes in optical and redox properties and increased perturbation of the aromatic system.

         <title>Synthesis of Enantioenriched Sulfoxides by an Oxidation&#8208;Reduction Enzymatic Cascade</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Linear oxidation&#8208;reduction bienzymatic cascade was designed to synthesize chiral sulfoxides starting from sulfides. The combinatorial cascade gave a broad range of structurally diverse sulfoxides in excellent optical purity (&gt;99&#8201;% ee) with complementary chirality. The cascade combines the superb stability of CiVCPO and enantioselectivity of MsrA/MsrB, as a result, it not only allows CiVCPO to gain relevance in chiral sulfoxide synthesis, but also provides a powerful approach for (S)&#8208;sulfide synthesis.







Abstract
Chiral sulfoxides are versatile synthons and have gained a particular interest in asymmetric synthesis of active pharmaceutical and agrochemical ingredients. Herein, a linear oxidation&#8211;reduction bienzymatic cascade to synthesize chiral sulfoxides is reported. The extraordinarily stable and active vanadium&#8208;dependent chloroperoxidase from Curvularia inaequalis (CiVCPO) was used to oxidize sulfides into racemic sulfoxides, which were then converted to chiral sulfoxides by highly enantioselective methionine sulfoxide reductase A (MsrA) and B (MsrB) by kinetic resolution, respectively. The combinatorial cascade gave a broad range of structurally diverse sulfoxides with excellent optical purity (&gt;99&#8201;%&#8197; ee) with complementary chirality. The enzymatic cascade requires no NAD(P)H recycling, representing a facile method for chiral sulfoxide synthesis. Particularly, the envisioned enzymatic cascade not only allows CiVCPO to gain relevance in chiral sulfoxide synthesis, but also provides a powerful approach for (S)&#8208;sulfoxide synthesis; the latter case is significantly unexplored for heme&#8208;dependent peroxidases and peroxygenases.

     alt="Synthesis of Enantioenriched Sulfoxides by an Oxidation-Reduction Enzymatic Cascade"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Linear oxidation-reduction&lt;/b&gt; bienzymatic cascade was designed to synthesize chiral sulfoxides starting from sulfides. The combinatorial cascade gave a broad range of structurally diverse sulfoxides in excellent optical purity (&amp;gt;99&#8201;% ee) with complementary chirality. The cascade combines the superb stability of &lt;i&gt;Ci&lt;/i&gt;VCPO and enantioselectivity of MsrA/MsrB, as a result, it not only allows &lt;i&gt;Ci&lt;/i&gt;VCPO to gain relevance in chiral sulfoxide synthesis, but also provides a powerful approach for (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)-sulfide synthesis.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chiral sulfoxides are versatile synthons and have gained a particular interest in asymmetric synthesis of active pharmaceutical and agrochemical ingredients. Herein, a linear oxidation&#8211;reduction bienzymatic cascade to synthesize chiral sulfoxides is reported. The extraordinarily stable and active vanadium-dependent chloroperoxidase from &lt;i&gt;Curvularia inaequalis&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Ci&lt;/i&gt;VCPO) was used to oxidize sulfides into racemic sulfoxides, which were then converted to chiral sulfoxides by highly enantioselective methionine sulfoxide reductase A (MsrA) and B (MsrB) by kinetic resolution, respectively. The combinatorial cascade gave a broad range of structurally diverse sulfoxides with excellent optical purity (&amp;gt;99&#8201;%&#8197; ee) with complementary chirality. The enzymatic cascade requires no NAD(P)H recycling, representing a facile method for chiral sulfoxide synthesis. Particularly, the envisioned enzymatic cascade not only allows &lt;i&gt;Ci&lt;/i&gt;VCPO to gain relevance in chiral sulfoxide synthesis, but also provides a powerful approach for (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)-sulfoxide synthesis; the latter case is significantly unexplored for heme-dependent peroxidases and peroxygenases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mechanistic Studies for the Rational Design of Multivalent Glycodendrimers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Interaction analysis of B antigen 16&#8208;mers (glycodendrimers), which differ with respect to the length of their linkers, with their IgM antibody revealed that the statistical rebinding model, which involves the rapid exchange of clustered glycans, contributes significantly to the multivalency. These results suggest that in addition to the chelation ability, high&#8208;density glycan&#8208;presentation to enhance statistical rebinding should also be taken into consideration in glycodendrimer design.







Abstract
We have synthesized B&#8208;antigen&#8208;displaying dendrimers (16&#8208;mers) with different sizes and evaluated their affinity to their IgM antibody in order to investigate which design features lead to effective multivalency. Unexpectedly, the smallest dendrimer, which cannot chelate the multiple binding sites of IgM, clearly exhibited multivalency, together with an affinity similar to or higher than those of the larger dendrimers. These results indicate that the statistical rebinding model, which involves the rapid exchange of clustered glycans, significantly contributes to the multivalency of glycodendrimers. Namely, in the design of glycodendrimers, high&#8208;density glycan presentation to enhance statistical rebinding should be considered in addition to the ability to chelate multiple binding sites. This notion stands in contrast to the currently prevailing scientific consensus, which prioritizes the chelation model. This study thus provides new and important guidelines for molecular design of glycodendrimers.

         <title>Water Reduction and Dihydrogen Addition in Aqueous Conditions With ansa&#8208;Phosphinoborane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Water reduction and H2 activation by an ortho&#8208;phenylene&#8208;bridged phosphinoborane compound are demonstrated. The mechanisms of these transformations are investigated using kinetic measurements and DFT calculations. Nuclear spin hyperpolarization is detected as a result of parahydrogen (para&#8208;H2) activation by the phosphinoborane in the presence of water, proving the reversibility of water addition to this compound.







Abstract
Ortho&#8208;phenylene&#8208;bridged phosphinoborane (2,6&#8208;Cl2Ph)2B&#8208;C6H4&#8208;PCy2 1 was synthesized in three steps from commercially available starting materials. 1 reacts with H2 or H2O under mild conditions to form corresponding zwitterionic phosphonium borates 1&#8208;H2 or 1&#8208;H2O. NMR studies revealed both reactions to be remarkably reversible. Thus, when exposed to H2, 1&#8208;H2O partially converts to 1&#8208;H2 even in the presence of multiple equivalents of water in the solution. The addition of parahydrogen to 1 leads to nuclear spin hyperpolarization both in dry and hydrous solvents, confirming the dissociation of 1&#8208;H2O to free 1. These observations were supported by computational studies indicating that the formation of 1&#8208;H2 and 1&#8208;H2O from 1 are thermodynamically favored. Unexpectedly, 1&#8208;H2O can release molecular hydrogen to form phosphine oxide 1&#8208;O. Kinetic, mechanistic, and computational (DFT) studies were used to elucidate the unique &#8220;umpolung&#8221; water reduction mechanism.

         <title>Improving the Electrocatalytic Activity of a Nickel&#8208;Organic Framework toward the Oxygen Evolution Reaction through Vanadium Doping</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The spherical structure V&#8208;doped Ni&#8208;MOF was successfully constructed on nickel foam by a facile two&#8208;step hydrothermal method. The V0.09&#8722;Ni0.91MOF/NF catalyst demonstrates extraordinary OER performance in alkaline. Studies showed that the three&#8208;dimensional structure of V&#8208;doped Ni&#8208;MOF/NF can provide more catalytically active sites and adjust the binding energy with intermediates, thereby enhancing the OER catalytic activity.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) have been considered as potential oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts owning to their ultra&#8208;thin structure, adjustable composition, high surface area, and high porosity. Here, we designed and fabricated a vanadium&#8208;doped nickel organic framework (V1&#8722;x&#8722;NixMOF) system by using a facile two&#8208;step solvothermal method on nickel foam (NF). The doping of vanadium remarkably elevates the OER activity of V1&#8722;x&#8722;NixMOF, thus demonstrating better performance than the corresponding single metallic Ni&#8208;MOF, NiV&#8208;MOF and RuO2 catalysts at high current density (&gt;400&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2). V0.09&#8722;Ni0.91MOF/NF provides a low overpotential of 235&#8197;mV and a small Tafel slope of 30.3&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1 at a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. More importantly, a water&#8208;splitting device assembled with Pt/C/NF and V0.09&#8722;Ni0.91MOF/NF as cathode and anode yielded a cell voltage of 1.96&#8197;V@1000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, thereby outperforming the&#8208;state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art RuO2(+)||Pt/C(&#8722;). Our work sheds new insight on preparing stable, efficient OER electrocatalysts and a promising method for designing various MOF&#8208;based materials.

         <title>Modulation of the Sorption Characteristics for an H&#8208;bonded porous Architecture by Varying the Chemical Functionalization of the Channel Walls</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fine tuning of gas sorption properties and I2 capture/release was achieved by variation of the functional group(s) decorating the channels of a microporous H&#8208;bonded framework material.







Abstract
Five isostructural microporous supramolecular architectures prepared by H&#8208;bonded assembly between the hexa&#8208;anionic complex [Zr2(Ox)7]6&#8722; (Ox=oxalate, (C2O4)2&#8722;) and tripodal cations (H3&#8208;TripCH2&#8208;R)3+ with R=H, CH3, OH and OBn (Bn=CH2Ph) are reported. The possibility to obtain the same structure using a mixture of tripodal cations with different R group (R=OH and R=CH3) has also been successfully explored, providing a unique example of three&#8208;component H&#8208;bonded porous framework. The resulting SPA&#8208;1(R) materials feature 1D pores decorated by R groups, with apparent pore diameters ranging from 3.0 to 8.5&#8197;&#197;. Influence of R groups on the sorption properties of these materials is evidenced through CO2 and H2O vapor sorption/desorption experiments, as well as with I2 capture/release experiments in liquid media. This study is one of the first to demonstrate the possibility of tuning the porosity and exerting precise control over the chemical functionalization of the pores in a given H&#8208;bonded structure, without modifying the topology of the reference structure, and thus finely adjusting the sorption characteristics of the material.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fine tuning of gas sorption properties&lt;/b&gt; and I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; capture/release was achieved by variation of the functional group(s) decorating the channels of a microporous H-bonded framework material.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five isostructural microporous supramolecular architectures prepared by H-bonded assembly between the hexa-anionic complex [Zr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(Ox)&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;6&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; (Ox=oxalate, (C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) and tripodal cations (H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-TripCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-R)&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; with R=H, CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, OH and OBn (Bn=CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ph) are reported. The possibility to obtain the same structure using a mixture of tripodal cations with different R group (R=OH and R=CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) has also been successfully explored, providing a unique example of three-component H-bonded porous framework. The resulting SPA-1(R) materials feature 1D pores decorated by R groups, with apparent pore diameters ranging from 3.0 to 8.5&#8197;&#197;. Influence of R groups on the sorption properties of these materials is evidenced through CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O vapor sorption/desorption experiments, as well as with I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; capture/release experiments in liquid media. This study is one of the first to demonstrate the possibility of tuning the porosity and exerting precise control over the chemical functionalization of the pores in a given H-bonded structure, without modifying the topology of the reference structure, and thus finely adjusting the sorption characteristics of the material.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chemo&#8208; and Site&#8208;Selective Electro&#8208;Oxidative Alkane Fluorination by C(sp3)&#8722;H Cleavage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8208;free electrochemical C(sp3)&#8722;H fluorination was accomplished without the requirement for directing groups and electrophilic fluorine sources, featuring high levels of site&#8208; and chemoselectivity.







Abstract
Electrochemical fluorinations of C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds with a nucleophilic fluoride source have been accomplished in a chemo&#8208; and site&#8208;selective fashion, avoiding the use of electrophilic F+ sources and stoichiometric oxidants. The introduced metal&#8208;free strategy exhibits high functional group tolerance, setting the stage for late&#8208;stage fluorinations of biorelevant motifs. The synthetic utility of the C(sp3)&#8722;H fluorination was reflected by subsequent one&#8208;pot arylation of the generated benzylic fluorides.

         <title>High&#8208;fidelity Recognition of Organotrifluoroborate Anions (R&#8722;BF3&#8722;) as Designer Guest Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic trifluoroborate anions (R&#8722;BF3&#8722;) are found to be competent size&#8208;matched binding partners for cyanostar macrocycles. Binding involves the BF3&#8722; headgroups and is modulated by the sterics of the substituent. Small vinyl and methyl substituents bind equally well and lay a foundation for the guest&#8208;design of self&#8208;assembled architectures.







Abstract
The recognition of boron compounds is well developed as boronic acids but untapped as organotrifluoroborate anions (R&#8722;BF3&#8722;). We are exploring the development of these and other designer anions as anion&#8208;recognition motifs by considering them as substituted versions of the parent inorganic ion. To this end, we demonstrate strong and reliable binding of organic trifluoroborates, R&#8722;BF3&#8722;, by cyanostar macrocycles that are size&#8208;complementary to the inorganic BF4&#8722; progenitors. We find that recognition is modulated by the substituent's sterics and that the affinities are retained using the common K+ salts of R&#8722;BF3&#8722; anions.

         <title>Dynamic Covalent Optical Chirality Sensing with a Sterically Encumbered Aminoborane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sterically encumbered aminoborane was designed to generate strong CD effects upon dynamic covalent binding of chiral alcohols, amino alcohols and diols. This can be used for the fast determination of the concentration, absolute configuration and enantiomeric excess of a variety of small molecules and for streamlining of small&#8208;scale asymmetric reaction analysis with less than 1&#8197;mg of crude material and without work&#8208;up.







Abstract
A sterically encumbered aminoborane sensor is introduced and used for quantitative stereochemical analysis of monoalcohols, diols and amino alcohols. The small&#8208;molecule probe exhibits a rigid ortho&#8208;substituted arene scaffold with a proximate boron binding site and a triarylamine circular dichroism (CD) reporter unit which proved to be crucial for the observed chiroptical signal induction. Coordination of the chiral target molecule produces strong Cotton effects and UV changes that are readily correlated to its absolute configuration, enantiomeric composition and concentration to achieve comprehensive stereochemical analysis within a 5&#8201;% absolute error margin. The sensing method was successfully applied in the chromatography&#8208;free analysis of less than one milligram of a crude asymmetric reaction mixture and the advantages of this chiroptical sensing approach, which is amenable to high&#8208;throughput experimentation equipment and automation, over traditional methods is discussed.

         <title>(Na0.74Ag1.26)BaSnS4: A New AgGaS2&#8208;Type Nonlinear Optical Sulfide with a Wide Band Gap and High Laser Induced Damage Threshold</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new AgGaS2&#8208;type sulfide (Na0.74Ag1.26)BaSnS4 with compressed chalcopyrite&#8208;like structure was obtained. It exhibits balanced NLO properties, including moderate SHG response, wide band gap, and high LIDT.







Abstract
The development of high&#8208;power solid&#8208;state lasers is in urgent need of infrared (IR) nonlinear optical (NLO) materials with wide band gaps and high laser&#8208;induced damage thresholds (LIDTs). Herein, a new compressed chalcopyrite&#8208;like IR NLO crystal (Na0.74Ag1.26)BaSnS4 was successfully synthesized using a facile high&#8208;temperature solid&#8208;state method. Its structure can be considered as a variant of chalcopyrite AgGaS2 (AGS)&#8208;type ones. It features a three&#8208;dimensional framework constructed by corner&#8208;sharing {[(Na/Ag)S4]7&#8722;}&#8734; layers and isolated SnS4 tetrahedra with negative cavities occupied by counter ion Ba2+. (Na0.74Ag1.26)BaSnS4 exhibits phase&#8208;matchable moderate SHG response (0.31 &#215; AGS), wide band gap (3.70&#8197;eV), and high LIDT (6.44 &#215; AGS). Theoretical calculations reveal that the NLO response of (Na0.74Ag1.26)BaSnS4 is mainly originated from the synergetic effects of AgS4 and SnS4 tetrahedra, and the inclusion of alkaline and alkaline earth metals is responsible for the wide band gap and high LIDT. Moreover, the discovery of this chalcopyrite&#8208;like compound will provide a feasible design strategy for the exploration of new promising IR NLO materials.

         <title>Coordination Adaptable Networks: Zirconium(IV) Carboxylates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Getting into shape again: Coordination adaptable networks (CooANs) are reshapable materials based on the dynamic and degenerate exchange of coordinative bonds. The materials described here, built by ligand exchange from [Zr6O4(OH)4(O2CMe)12] and a carboxylic acid&#8208;containing polymer matrix, which yields [Zr6O4(OH)4]&#8208;based crosslinks, display vitrimer&#8208;like properties.







Abstract
Vitrimers are 3D &#8220;covalent adaptable networks&#8221; (CANs) with flow properties thanks to thermally activated associative exchange reactions. This contribution introduces coordination adaptable networks, or CooANs, that are topologically related to metal&#8211;organic frameworks with octahedral Zr6 clusters as secondary building units in a carboxylic acid&#8208;functionalized acrylate&#8208;methacrylate copolymer matrix. A series of Zr&#8208;CooAN&#8208;x materials (x=percent of Zr6 loading relative to maximum capacity) was synthesized with x=5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 50 and 100. The mechanical and rheological investigations demonstrate vitrimer&#8208;like properties for x up to 50, the crosslink migration being ensured by carboxylate ligand exchange, with relaxation becoming slower as the Zr6 content is increased. The flow activation energy of Zr&#8208;CooAN&#8208;10 is 92.9&#177;3.6&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1. Rapid (30&#8197;min) hot&#8208;press reshaping occurs at temperatures in the 50&#8211;100&#8201;&#176;C range under a 3&#8208;ton pressure and does not significantly alter the material properties.

         <title>Colloidal Stability of TiO2 Nanoparticles: The Roles of Phosphonate Ligand Length and Solution Temperature</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
More than enough is too much! The cover shows a role of phosphonate ligand length in the colloidal stability of TiO2 nanoparticles. In contrast to classical colloid theory, the dodecylphosphonate ligand provided better colloidal stability than the longer or shorter n&#8208;alkylphosphonate ligands. The proposed method is applicable to a wide range of colloidal nanoparticle systems. More information can be found in the Research Article by Y. Okada and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202201560).

         <title>Solution structure of a lanthanide&#8208;binding DNA aptamer determined using high quality pseudocontact shift restraints</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this contribution we report the high&#8208;resolution NMR structure of a recently identified lanthanide&#8208;binding aptamer (LnA). We demonstrate that the rigid lanthanide binding by LnA allows for the measurement of anisotropic paramagnetic NMR restraints which to date remain largely inaccessible for nucleic acids. One type of such restraints &#8208; pseudocontact shifts (PCS) induced by four different paramagnetic lanthanides &#8208; was extensively used throughout the current structure determination study and the measured PCS turned out to be exceptionally well reproduced by the final aptamer structure. This finding opens the perspective for a broader application of paramagnetic effects in NMR studies of nucleic acids through the transplantation of the binding site found in LnA into other DNA/RNA systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Temperature&#8208;Controlled Selective Mono vs Di&#8208;ortho&#8208;Arylation for the Synthesis of Arylhydrazine Derivatives.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the method of palladium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;H arylation assisted with 3,4,4&#8208;trimethylpyrazol&#8208;5&#8208;on directing group providing selectively mono&#8208; and di&#8208;  ortho  &#8208;arylated products. Steric hindrance appearing between the directing group and the already introduced aryl substituent enables control of mono  vs  diarylation selectivity by the temperature of the reaction. Taking advantage of this, a series of monosubstituted and disubstituted derivatives were obtained in good yields. Moreover, unsymmetrical double&#8208;arylation in a one&#8208;pot procedure was developed to give corresponding products in reasonable yields. Additionally, synthesis and X&#8208;ray study of intermediate palladium metallacycles of both, the first and second arylation reactions, were conducted. X&#8208;ray structure comparison emphasizes the geometrical differences that were consistent with the observed reactivity. Finally, decarboxylative cleavage of the pyrazolone directing group under mild conditions gave synthetically useful hydrazones. The presented solution opens the alternative synthetic way to such  ortho  arylated derivatives of arylhydrazines.</dc:description>

         <title>Enabling Aromatic Hydroxylation in a Cytochrome P450 Monooxygenase Enzyme through Protein Engineering</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The cytochrome P450 (CYP) family of heme monooxygenases catalyse the selective oxidation of C&#8208;H bonds under ambient conditions. The CYP199A4 enzyme from  Rhodopseudomonas palustris  catalyses aliphatic oxidation of 4&#8208;cyclohexylbenzoic acid but not the aromatic oxidation of 4&#8208;phenylbenzoic acid, due to the distinct mechanisms of aliphatic and aromatic oxidation.&#160;The aromatic substrates 4&#8208;benzyl&#8208;, 4&#8208;phenoxy&#8208; and 4&#8208;benzoyl&#8208;benzoic acid and methoxy&#8208;substituted phenylbenzoic acids were assessed to see if they could achieve an orientation more amenable to aromatic oxidation. CYP199A4 could catalyse the efficient benzylic oxidation of 4&#8208;benzylbenzoic acid. The methoxy substituted phenylbenzoic acids were oxidatively demethylated with low activity. However, no aromatic oxidation was observed with any of these substrates. Crystal structures of CYP199A4 with 4&#8208;(3&#162;&#8208;methoxyphenyl)benzoic acid demonstrated that the substrate binding mode was like that of 4&#8208;phenylbenzoic acid. 4&#8208;Phenoxy&#8208; and 4&#8208;benzoyl&#8208;benzoic acid bound with the ether or ketone oxygen atom hydrogen&#8208;bonded to the heme aqua ligand. We also investigated if the substitution of phenylalanine residues in the active site could permit aromatic hydroxylation. Mutagenesis of the F298 residue to a valine did not significantly alter the substrate binding position or enable the aromatic oxidation of 4&#8208;phenylbenzoic acid. The F182L mutant was able to catalyse 4&#8208;phenylbenzoic acid oxidation generating 2'&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;, 3'&#8208;hydroxy&#8208; and 4'&#8208;hydroxy metabolites in a 83:9:8 ratio, respectively. Molecular dynamics simulations, in which the distance and angle of attack were considered, demonstrated that in the F182L variant, in contrast to the wild&#8208;type enzyme, the phenyl ring of 4&#8208;phenylbenzoic acid attained a productive geometry for aromatic oxidation to occur.</dc:description>

         <title>Computational insights of selective intramolecular O&#8208;atom transfer mediated by bioinspired copper complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The stereoselective copper&#8208;mediated hydroxylation of intramolecular C&#8208;H bonds from tridentate ligands is reinvestigated using DFT calculations. The computational study aims at deciphering the mechanism of C&#8208;H hydroxylation obtained after reaction of Cu(I) precursors with dioxygen, using ligands bearing either activated (  L  1  ) or non&#8208;activated (  L  2  ) C&#8208;H bonds.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The stereoselective copper-mediated hydroxylation of intramolecular C-H bonds from tridentate ligands is reinvestigated using DFT calculations. The computational study aims at deciphering the mechanism of C-H hydroxylation obtained after reaction of Cu(I) precursors with dioxygen, using ligands bearing either activated (  L  1  ) or non-activated (  L  2  ) C-H bonds. Configurational analysis allows rationalization of the experimentally observed regio- and stereoselectivity. The computed mechanism involves the formation of a&#160;  side-on  &#160;peroxide species (  P  ) in equilibrium with the key intermediate bis-(&#956;-oxo) isomer (  O  ) responsible for the C-H activation step. The&#160;  P/O  &#160;equilibrium yields the same activation barrier for the two complexes.&#160; However, the main difference between the two model complexes is observed during the C-H activation step , where the complex bearing the non-activated C-H bonds yields a higher energy barrier, accounting for the experimental lack of reactivity of this complex under those conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hydrostannylation of Red Phosphorus: A Convenient Route to Monophosphines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The preparation of valuable and industrially relevant organophosphorus compounds currently depends on inefficient and indirect multi&#8208;step procedures involving difficult&#8208;to&#8208;handle white phosphorus as a common P atom source, alongside extremely hazardous, toxic, and/or corrosive reactants and intermediates. Herein, we report a practical and versatile method for the synthesis of a variety of monophosphorus compounds directly from the bench&#8208;stable allotrope red phosphorus (P red ). The productive functionalisation of relatively inert P red is achieved using the cheap and readily available radical reagent tri&#8208; n &#8208;butyltin hydride, and subsequent treatment with electrophiles yields useful P 1 compounds. Remarkably, these transformations require only modest inert atmosphere techniques and use only reagents that are inexpensive, commercially available, and easy to safely handle, making this a convenient and practical methodology accessible in most laboratory settings.</dc:description>

         <title>Insights into the effect of adsorption preference of additives on the anisotropic growth of ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zeolite morphology plays a crucial role to affect catalytic performance, while it is persistently challenging to tailor via crystal anisotropic growth. It has been recognized that specific additives can be introduced in the synthetic process of zeolites to achieve anisotropic growth, while their role and the underlying mechanism are yet well understood. Herein, the effect of eight specific additives on the anisotropic growth of ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite was unveiled within the framework of crystallization engineering. Either the inhibition effect or the promotion effect is revealed for each additive according to the crystallization kinetics. The adsorption preference of typical additives on different surfaces was demonstrated by total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM) and transmission X&#8208;ray microscopy (TXM) together with 3D reconstruction. The calculated adsorption energy difference between MFI [100]/[101] and [010] surfaces was proposed as a key descriptor to estimate the possible morphology induced by additive. ZSM&#8208;5 zeolites varying from sphere&#8208;like, plate&#8208;like to noodle&#8208;like morphology could be synthesized by employing specific additives with increasing adsorption strength difference on distinct surfaces.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Chemoselective Catalytic Photooxidations Using Solvent as a Sacrificial Electron Acceptor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract:  Catalyst recovery is an integral part of photoredox catalysis. It is often solved by adding another component&#8208;a sacrificial agent&#8208; whose role is to convert the catalyst back into its original oxidation state. However, an additive may cause a side reaction thus decreasing the selectivity and overall efficiency. Herein, we present a novel approach towards chemoselective photooxidation reactions based on suitable solvent&#8208;acetonitrile acting simultaneously as an electron acceptor for catalyst recovery, in combination with anaerobic conditions. This is allowed by the unique properties of the catalyst, 7,8&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;3&#8208;methyl&#8208;5&#8208;phenyl&#8208;5&#8208;deazaflavinium chloride existing in both strongly oxidizing and reducing forms, whose strength is increased by excitation with visible light. Usefulness of this system is demonstrated in chemoselective dehydrogenations of 4&#8208;methoxy&#8208; and 4&#8208;chlorobenzyl alcohols to aldehydes without over&#8208;oxidation to benzoic acids achieving yields up to 70%. 4&#8208;Substituted 1&#8208;phenylethanols were oxidized to ketones with yields 80&#8208;100% and, moreover, with yields 31&#8208;98% in the presence of benzylic methyl group, diphenylmethane or thioanisole which are readily oxidized in the presence of oxygen but these were untouched with our system. Mechanistic studies based on UV&#8208;VIS spectro&#8208;electrochemistry, EPR and time&#8208;resolved spectroscopy measurements showed the process involving an electron release from an excited deazaflavin radical to acetonitrile forming solvated electron is crucial for the catalyst recovery.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanism of BPh3&#8208;Catalyzed N&#8208;Methylation of Amines with CO2 and Phenylsilane: Cooperative Activation of Hydrosilane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>BPh3 catalyzes the N&#8208;methylation of secondary amines and the C&#8208;methylenation (methylene&#8208;bridge formation between aromatic rings) of N,N&#8208;dimethylanilines or 1&#8208;methylindoles in the presence of CO2 and PhSiH3, and these reactions proceed at 30&#8211;40 &#176;C under solvent&#8208;free conditions. In contrast, B(C6F5)3 shows little or no activity. 11B NMR spectra suggested the generation of [HBPh3]&#8211;. The detailed mechanism of the BPh3&#8208;catalyzed the N&#8208;methylation of N&#8208;methylaniline (1) with CO2 and PhSiH3 was studied by DFT calculations. BPh3 promotes the conversion of two substrates (N&#8208;methylaniline and CO2) into a twitterionic carbamate to give three&#8208;component species [Ph(Me)(H)N+CO2&#8211;&#183;&#183;&#183;BPh3]. The carbamate and BPh3 act as the nucleophile and Lewis acid, respectively, for the activation of PhSiH3 to generate [HBPh3]&#8211;, which is used to produce key CO2&#8208;derived species, such as silyl formate and bis(silyl)acetal, essential for the N&#8208;methylation of 1. DFT calculations also suggested other mechanisms involving water for the generation of [HBPh3]&#8211; species.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The application of solar energy is  crucial  for alleviating the energy crisis and achieving sustainable development. In recent years, photo&#8208;assisted rechargeable batteries have attracted researchers because they can directly convert and store solar energy in the batteries. And it also can be used like a normal battery without light illumination. Photo&#8208;assisted lithium&#8208;based batteries have received more attention than other energy storage systems due to their higher energy density and relatively mature development. This review focuses on the design of various photo&#8208;assisted lithium&#8208;based batteries including Li&#8208;ion, Li&#8208;S, Li&#8208;O  2  , Li&#8208;CO  2  and Li&#8208;I batteries, as well as the working mechanism of photoelectrodes in these batter systems. The basic understanding and challenge of photo&#8208;assisted lithium&#8208;based batteries are also discussed. At last, perspectives about the photoelectrode development are provided in the summary to advance photo&#8208;assisted energy storage systems.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Epoxy resins coatings are commonly found in corrosion protection coatings but the presence of water can affect their adhesion to the substrate, often weakening the adhesion of the coating to the solid, reducing its efficiency. Nevertheless, small amounts of water can enhance the epoxy/substrate interactions. In this work, the interphase region of an epoxy precursor and metal oxide substrates is investigated using molecular simulations and it is found that water accumulates between the epoxy layer and the solid substrate. At high water concentrations (9%wt) the interaction between the epoxy precursor and the solid surface is weakened regardless of the nature of the solid, but at low water concentrations the nature of the solid surface becomes important. For hematite, the presence of water decreases the strength of adhesion but for goethite the presence of a small amount of water (3%wt) enhances the adhesion to the surface resulting in a densification at the interface.</dc:description>

         <title>A Reversibly Porous Supramolecular Peptide Framework</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The ability to use bio&#8208;inspired building&#8208;blocks in the assembly of novel supramolecular frameworks is at the forefront of this exciting research field. Herein, we present the first polyproline helix to self&#8208;assemble into a reversibly porous, crystalline, supramolecular peptide framework (SPF). This framework is assembled from a short oligoproline, adopting the polyproline II conformation, driven by hydrogen&#8208;bonding and dispersion interactions. Thermal activation, guest&#8208;induced dynamic porosity and enantioselective guest inclusion have been demonstrated for this novel system. The principles of the self&#8208;assembly associated with this SPF will be used as a blueprint allowing for the further development of helical peptide linkers in the rational design of SPFs and metalpeptide frameworks.</dc:description>

         <title>Characterization of a novel cytochrome involved in Geobacter sulfurreducens&#8217; electron harvesting pathways</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electron harvesting bacteria are key targets to develop microbial electrosynthesis technologies, which are valid alternatives for the production of value&#8208;added compounds without utilization of fossil fuels. Geobacter sulfurreducens, that is capable of donating and accepting electrons from electrodes, is one of the most promising electroactive bacteria. Its electron transfer mechanisms to electrodes have been progressively elucidated, however the electron harvesting pathways are still poorly understood. Previous studies showed that the periplasmic cytochromes PccH and GSU2515 are overexpressed in current&#8208;consuming G. sulfurreducens biofilms. PccH was characterized, though no putative partners have been identified. In this work, GSU2515 was characterized by complementary biophysical techniques and in silico simulations using the AlphaFold neural network. GSU2515 is a low&#8208;spin monoheme cytochrome with a disordered N&#8208;terminal region and an &#945;&#8208;helical C&#8208;terminal domain harboring the heme group. The cytochrome undergoes a redox&#8208;linked heme axial ligand switch, with Met91 and His94 as distal axial ligand in the reduced and oxidized state, respectively. The reduction potential of the cytochrome is negative and is modulated by the pH in the physiological range: &#8208;78 mV at pH 6 and &#8208;113 mV at pH 7. Such pH&#8208;dependence coupled to the redox&#8208;linked switch of the axial ligand allows the cytochrome to drive a proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer step that is crucial to confer directionality to the respiratory chain. Biomolecular interactions and electron transfer experiments indicated that GSU2515 and PccH form a redox complex. Overall, the data obtained highlights for the first time how periplasmic proteins bridge the electron transfer between the outer and inner membrane in the electron harvesting pathways of G. sulfurreducens.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultrathin Niobate Nanosheet Assembly with Au NPs and CdS QDs as a Highly Efficient Photocatalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Niobate nanosheets have aroused widespread interest in recent years for their prospects in catalysis. The exploration of 2D niobate catalysis with stable and efficient properties is still the focus in chemistry and materials science. Herein, we demonstrated the successful fabrication of 2D CdS/Au/HNb  3  O  8  catalyst which revealed efficient photocatalytic properties in H  2  evolution, oxidative self&#8208;coupling of amines to imines, and degradation of dyes. Especially the assembled architecture can give a rate of 5.85 mmol&#183;g  &#8208;1  &#183;h  &#8208;1  of photocatalytic H  2  evolution, an ~254&#8208;fold enhancement, compared with bare HNb  3  O  8  nanosheets under identical conditions. In accordance with density functional theory (DFT) and X&#8208;ray adsorption fine structure (XAFS) analyses, the vast improvements are benefited from efficient migration and separation of charge carriers. Besides, the surface plasma resonance (SPR) effect of Au NPs enhances the light harvesting capacity and boosts the generation of hot electrons, efficiently improving the visible&#8208;light absorption.</dc:description>

Polynuclear niobium(V)&#8208;based carboxylate oxo clusters: A series of aryl monocarboxylate ligands was used to isolate molecular coordination complexes corresponding to dinuclear {Nb2O}, tetranuclear {Nb4O4}, or octanuclear {Nb8O12} niobium(V)&#8208;centered poly&#8208;oxo clusters related to different hydrolysis rates.







Abstract
The reactivity of aryl monocarboxylic acids (benzoic, 1&#8208; or 2&#8208;naphtoic, 4&#8217;&#8208;methylbiphenyl&#8208;4&#8208;carboxylic, and anthracene&#8208;9&#8208;carboxylic acids) as complexing agents for the ethoxide niobium(V) (Nb(OEt)5 precursor has been investigated. A total of eight coordination complexes were isolated with distinct niobium(V) nuclearities as well as carboxylate complexation states. The use of benzoic acid gives a tetranuclear core Nb4(&#956;2&#8208;O)4(L)4(OEt)8] (L=benzoate (1)) with four Nb&#8722;(&#956;2&#8208;O)&#8722;Nb linkages in a square plane configuration. A similar tetramer, 7, was obtained with 2&#8208;naphtoic acid by using a 55&#8201;% humid atmosphere synthetic route. Two types of dinuclear brick were identified with one central Nb&#8722;(&#956;2&#8208;O)&#8722;Nb linkage; they differ in their complexation state, with one bridging carboxylate ([Nb2(&#956;2&#8208;O)(&#956;2&#8208;OEt)(L)(OEt)6], with L=1&#8208;naphtoate (3) or anthracene&#8208;9&#8208;carboxylate (5)) or two bridging carboxylate groups ([Nb2(&#956;2&#8208;O)(L)2(OEt)6], with L=4&#8217;&#8208;methylbiphenyl&#8208;4&#8208;carboxylic (4) or anthracene&#8208;9&#8208;carboxylate (6)). An octanuclear moiety [Nb8(&#956;2&#8208;O)12(L)8(&#951;1&#8208;L)4&#8722;x(OEt)4+x] (with L=2&#8208;naphtoate, x=0 or 2; 8) was obtained by using a solvothermal route in acetonitrile; it has a cubic configuration with niobium centers at each node, linked by 12&#8197;&#956;2&#8208;O groups. The formation of the niobium oxo clusters was characterized by infrared and liquid 1H NMR spectroscopy in order to analyze the esterification reaction, which induces the release of water molecules that further react through oxolation with niobium atoms, in different {Nb2O}, {Nb4O4} and {Nb8O12} nuclearities.

An octanuclear moiety [Nb&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;(&#956;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-O)&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;(&lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;(&#951;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-&lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&#8722;&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;

The formation of the niobium oxo clusters was characterized by infrared and liquid &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H NMR spectroscopy in order to analyze the esterification reaction, which induces the release of water molecules that further react through oxolation with niobium atoms, in different {Nb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O}, {Nb&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;} and {Nb&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;} nuclearities.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photostable NIR&#8208;II Pigments from Extended Rylenecarboximides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of organic near infrared (NIR) absorbers based on rylenecarboximide and anthraquinone were obtained with maximum absorption peaks ranging from 870&#8197;nm to 1100&#8197;nm. A photostable pigment with NIR&#8208;II absorption was developed through de&#8208;alkylation reaction under formation of intermolecular hydrogen bonds.







Abstract
A series of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) organic absorbers, named FNs and FPs, have been obtained with absorption maxima from 870&#8197;nm to 1100&#8197;nm and thus falling into the attractive second near&#8208;infrared region (NIR&#8208;II). The synthesis of their extended aromatic cores utilized an initial aryl&#8208;amination between 4&#8208;aminonaphthalene&#8208;1,8&#8208;dicarboximide (NMI&#8208;NH2) or 9&#8208;aminoperylene&#8208;3,4&#8208;dicarboximide (PMI&#8208;NH2) with chloro&#8208;substituted 9,10&#8208;anthraquinones followed by a novel base&#8208;induced cyclodehydrogenation. A NIR&#8208;II pigment, compound FPP, was obtained through de&#8208;alkylation of a soluble precursor. The synthesis of this photostable pigment is high&#8208;yielding and avoids column chromatographic purification which is important for many applications.

         <title>Rational Tuning of the Reactivity of Three&#8208;Membered Heterocycle Ring Openings via SN2 Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It's a trap! Our quantum chemical analyses reveal that ring&#8208;opening reaction barriers decrease in the order aziridines&gt;phosphiranes&gt;epoxides&gt;thiiranes, and thus do not simply follow the order of C&#8722;Y leaving&#8208;group bond strength. We illustrate that orbital interaction (HOMONu&#8211;LUMOSubstrate is an all&#8208;important factor for these reactions. The high reactivity of aziridines and phosphiranes substituted with electron&#8208;withdrawing groups is mainly caused by a diminished steric repulsion between the reactants.







Abstract
The development of small&#8208;molecule covalent inhibitors and probes continuously pushes the rapidly evolving field of chemical biology forward. A key element in these molecular tool compounds is the &#8220;electrophilic trap&#8221; that allows a covalent linkage with the target enzyme. The reactivity of this entity needs to be well balanced to effectively trap the desired enzyme, while not being attacked by off&#8208;target nucleophiles. Here we investigate the intrinsic reactivity of substrates containing a class of widely used electrophilic traps, the three&#8208;membered heterocycles with a nitrogen (aziridine), phosphorus (phosphirane), oxygen (epoxide) or sulfur atom (thiirane) as heteroatom. Using quantum chemical approaches, we studied the conformational flexibility and nucleophilic ring opening of a series of model substrates, in which these electrophilic traps are mounted on a cyclohexene scaffold (C6H10Y with Y=NH, PH, O, S). It was revealed that the activation energy of the ring opening does not necessarily follow the trend that is expected from C&#8722;Y leaving&#8208;group bond strength, but steeply decreases from Y=NH, to PH, to O, to S. We illustrate that the HOMONu&#8211;LUMOSubstrate interaction is an all&#8208;important factor for the observed reactivity. In addition, we show that the activation energy of aziridines and phosphiranes can be tuned far below that of the corresponding epoxides and thiiranes by the addition of proper electron&#8208;withdrawing ring substituents. Our results provide mechanistic insights to rationally tune the reactivity of this class of popular electrophilic traps and can guide the experimental design of covalent inhibitors and probes for enzymatic activity.

         <title>Calcium carbonate dissolution from the laboratory to the ocean: kinetics and mechanism</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The ultimate fate, over the course of millennia, of nearly all of the carbon dioxide formed by human kind is for it to react with calcium carbonate in the world&#8217;s oceans. Although, this reaction is of global relevance, aspects of the calcite dissolution reaction remain poorly described with apparent contradictions present throughout the expansive literature. In this perspective we aim to evidence how a lack of appreciation of the role of mass&#8208;transport may have hampered developments in this area. These insights have important implications for both idealised experiments performed under laboratory conditions and for the measurement and modelling of oceanic calcite sediment dissolution.</dc:description>

         <title>Improved Dye Survival in Expansion Microscopy through Stabilizer&#8208;conjugated Linkers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Expansion microscopy (ExM) has been widely used to detect biomolecules in cultured cells and tissue samples due to its enablement of super resolution imaging with conventional microscopes, via physical expansion of samples. However, reaction conditions inherent to the process bring about strong fluorescent signal loss during polymerization and digestion and thus limit the brightness of the signal obtained post expansion. Here, we explore the impact of stabilizer&#8208;containing organic fluorophores in ExM, as a mitigation strategy for this radical&#8208;induced dye degradation. Through direct conjugation of 4&#8208;Nitrophenylalanine (NPA) to our previously developed trifunctional reagents, we validate and demonstrate that these multifunctional linkers enable visualization of different organelles with improved fluorescent intensity, owning to protection of the dyes to radical induced degradation as well as to photoprotection upon imaging. At this point we cannot disentangle the relative contribution of both mechanisms. Furthermore, we report anchoring linkers that allow straightforward application of NPA or Trolox to commercially available fluorophore&#8208;conjugated antibodies. We show that these anchoring linkers enable complete retention of biological targets while increasing fluorophore photostability. Our results provide guidance in exploring these stabilizer&#8208;modified agents in ExM and methods for increased signal survival through the polymerization steps of the ExM protocols.</dc:description>

         <title>2D Catalysts for CO2 Photoreduction: Discussing Structure Efficiency Strategies and Prospects for Scaled Production Based on Current Progress</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Currently, the excessive consumption of fossil fuels is accompanied by massive emissions of CO  2  , leading to severe energy shortage and intensified global warming. It is of great significance to develop and utilize renewable clean energy, while reducing the concentration of CO  2  in the atmosphere. Photocatalytic technology is a promising strategy for carbon dioxide conversion. Clearly, the achievement of the above goals largely depends on the design and construction of catalysts. This review is mainly focused on the application of 2D materials for photocatalytic CO  2  reduction. The contribution of synthetic strategies to structure as well as performance is emphasized. In the end, the current challenges, and prospects of 2D materials for photoreduction of CO  2  with high efficiency, even for practical application are discussed. It is hoped that this review can provide some guidance for the rational design, controllable synthesis of 2D materials, and their application for efficient photocatalytic CO  2  reduction.</dc:description>

This review is mainly focused on the application of 2D materials for photocatalytic CO  2  reduction. The contribution of synthetic strategies to structure as well as performance is emphasized. In the end, the current challenges, and prospects of 2D materials for photoreduction of CO  2  with high efficiency, even for practical application are discussed. It is hoped that this review can provide some guidance for the rational design, controllable synthesis of 2D materials, and their application for efficient photocatalytic CO  2  reduction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Fabrication of Nb2O5/Carbon Submicrostructures&#160;for Advanced Lithium&#8208;Ion Battery Anodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nb2O5&#160;possesses superior fast Li+&#160;storage capability for LIBs anode, benefiting from its fast pseudocapacitive behavior and low volumetric change within the cycling processes. However, the poor electric conductivity for Nb2O5&#160;restricts its reaction kinetics and rate property. Herein, Nb2O5/Carbon (C)&#160;submicrostructures are fabricated&#160;by&#160;solvothermal method followed by calcination process. The Nb2O5/C submicrostructures exhibit outstanding rate behavior and cyclic performance (332 (194) mAh g&#8208;1&#160;after 1000 cycles at 1 (5) A g&#8208;1). The superior electrochemical property is attributed to the distinctive structure for Nb2O5/C submicrostructures, in which Nb2O5&#160;nanoparticles uniformly distributed within Nb2O5/C&#160;composite&#160;can protect Nb2O5&#160;nanoparticles from agglomeration, and the porous carbon matrix can enhance electron/ion conductivity. This work furnishes a novel strategy for fabricating Nb2O5/C submicrostructures with superior Li+&#160;storage performance, which can be potentially used to design other metal oxide/C submicrostructures for second battery anode.</dc:description>

Effective method for TfOH&#8208;catalyzed construction of spiroindanes and spirotetralines containing an all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenter was developed, and the reaction was applied to the first total synthesis of (&#177;)&#8208;misrametine.







Abstract
An effective method was developed for TfOH&#8208;catalyzed construction of spiroindanes and spirotetralines containing an all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenter. Intramolecular Friedel&#8208;Crafts&#8208;type 1,4&#8208;addition of the substrates which were di&#8208; or trimethoxybenzene and 2&#8208;cyclohexenone linked by an alkyl chain proceeded smoothly in the presence of 30&#8197;mol&#8201;% of TfOH. A variety of spiroindanes and spirotetralines were obtained with moderate to excellent yield by this method. The reaction was successfully applied in the first total synthesis of the unusual proaporphine alkaloid (&#177;)&#8208;misrametine, which included the gram&#8208;scale spirocyclization and selective O&#8208;demethylation used KCN in DMSO condition as key steps.

         <title>Fe&#8208;Catalyzed Amidation of Allylic Alcohols by Borrowing Hydrogen Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The amidation of allylic alcohols with chiral tert&#8208;butylsulfinamide catalyzed by an Earth&#8208;abundant Fe complex via a borrowing hydrogen pathway has been developed. With water as the only by&#8208;product, a range of synthetically useful chiral sulfinamide olefin derivatives were obtained under mild reaction conditions with exclusive linear selectivity and retention of enantioselectivity.







Abstract
Allylic amines are useful building blocks in organic synthesis, so the development of green and efficient methods for the preparation of allylic amines are of great importance. An Fe&#8208;catalyzed amidation of allylic alcohols with chiral tert&#8208;butylsulfinamide has been developed. With water as the only by&#8208;product, a range of synthetically useful chiral sulfinamide olefin derivatives (30 examples) were obtained under mild reaction conditions. The reaction can be performed on a gram&#8208;scale, and the products could serve as chiral ligands for asymmetric catalysis. Mechanistic studies suggest that the reaction proceeds by an Fe&#8208;catalyzed borrowing hydrogen process, which is different from most of the reported allylic amination reactions.

Abstract
The sequence of reactions of the phosphorus&#8208;containing aryllithium compound 5&#8208;t&#8208;Bu&#8208;1,3&#8208;[(P(O)(O&#8208;i&#8208;Pr)2]2C6H2Li (ArLi) with Ph2PCl, KMnO4, elemental sulfur and elemental selenium, respectively, gave the aryldiphenylphosphane chalcogenides 5&#8208;t&#8208;Bu&#8208;1,3&#8208;[(P(O)(O&#8208;i&#8208;Pr)2]2C6H2P(E)Ph2 (1, E=O; 2, E=S; 3, E=Se). Compound 1 partially hydrolysed giving [5&#8208;t&#8208;Bu&#8208;1&#8208;{(P(O)(O&#8208;i&#8208;Pr)2}&#8208;3&#8208;{(P(O)(OH)2}C6H2]P(O)Ph2 (4). The reaction of ArLi with PhPCl2 provided the benzoxaphosphaphosphole [1(P), 3(P)&#8208;P(O)(O&#8208;i&#8208;Pr)OPPh&#8208;6&#8208;t&#8208;Bu&#8208;4&#8208;P(O)(O&#8208;i&#8208;Pr)2]C6H2P (5i) as a mixture of the two diastereomers. The oxidation of 5i with elemental sulfur gave the benzoxaphosphaphosphole sulfide [1(P), 3(P)&#8208;P(O)(O&#8208;i&#8208;Pr)OP(S)Ph&#8208;6&#8208;t&#8208;Bu&#8208;4&#8208;P(O)(O&#8208;i&#8208;Pr)2]C6H2 (5) as pair of enantiomers P1(R), P3(S)/P1(S), P3(R) of the diastereomer (RS/SR)&#8208;5 (5b). The aryldiphenylphosphane 5&#8208;t&#8208;Bu&#8208;1,3&#8208;[(P(O)(O&#8208;i&#8208;Pr)2]2C6H2PPh2 (6) was obtained from the reaction of the corresponding aryldiphenylphosphane sulfide 2 with either sodium hydride, NaH, or disodium iron tetracarbonyl, Na2Fe(CO)4. The oxidation of the aryldiphenylphosphane 6 with elemental iodine and subsequent hydrolysis yielded the aryldiphenyldioxaphosphorane 9&#8208;t&#8208;Bu&#8208;2,6&#8208;(OH)&#8208;4,4&#8208;Ph2&#8208;3,5&#8208;O2&#8208;2,6&#8208;P2&#8208;4&#955;5&#8208;P&#8208;[5.3.1.0]&#8208;undeca&#8208;1(10),7(11),8&#8208;triene (7). Both of its diastereomers, (RR/SS)&#8208;7 (7a) and (RS/SR)&#8208;7 (7b), were separated as their chloroform and i&#8208;propanol solvates, 7a&#8901;2CHCl3 and 7b&#8901;i&#8208;PrOH, respectively. DFT calculations accompanied the experimental work.

The oxidation of &lt;b&gt;5i&lt;/b&gt; with elemental sulfur gave the benzoxaphosphaphosphole sulfide [1(P), 3(P)-P(O)(O-&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;-Pr)OP(S)Ph-6-&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;-Bu-4-P(O)(O-&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;-Pr)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt;) as pair of enantiomers P1(&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;), P3(&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)/P1(&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;), P3(&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;) of the diastereomer (&lt;i&gt;RS/SR&lt;/i&gt;)-&lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt; (&lt;b&gt;5b&lt;/b&gt;). The aryldiphenylphosphane 5-&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;-Bu-1,3-[(P(O)(O-&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;-Pr)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PPh&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;6&lt;/b&gt;) was obtained from the reaction of the corresponding aryldiphenylphosphane sulfide &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; with either sodium hydride, NaH, or disodium iron tetracarbonyl, Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Fe(CO)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. The oxidation of the aryldiphenylphosphane &lt;b&gt;6&lt;/b&gt; with elemental iodine and subsequent hydrolysis yielded the aryldiphenyldioxaphosphorane 9-&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;-Bu-2,6-(O&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;)-4,4-Ph&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-3,5-O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-2,6-P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-4&#955;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;-P-[5.3.1.0]-undeca-1(10),7(11),8-triene (&lt;b&gt;7&lt;/b&gt;).

         <title>&#8220;Activated Borane&#8221; &#8211; A Porous Borane Cluster Network as an Effective Adsorbent for Removing Organic Pollutants</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The unprecedented co&#8208;thermolysis of decaborane(14) ( nido &#8208;B 10 H 14 ) and toluene results in a novel porous material (that we have named &#8220;Activated Borane&#8221;) containing micropores 1.0 and 1.5 nm in diameter and a specific surface area of 774 m 2 g &#8208;1 (Ar, 87 K) that is thermally stable up to 1000 &#176;C. Solid&#8208;state 1 H, 11 B and 13 C MAS NMR, UV&#8208;vis and IR spectroscopies suggest an amorphous structure of borane clusters interconnected by toluene moieties in a ratio of about three toluene molecules for every borane cluster. In addition, the structure contains Lewis&#8208;acidic tri&#8208;coordinated boron sites giving it some unique properties. Activated Borane displays high sorption capacity for pollutants such as sulfamethoxazole, tramadol, diclofenac and bisphenol A that exceed the capacity of commercially&#8208;available activated carbon. The consistency in properties for each batch made, and the ease of its synthesis, make Activated Borane a promising porous material worthy of broad attention.</dc:description>

         <title>C&#8722;H Activation of Inert Arenes using a Photochemically Activated Guanidinato&#8208;Magnesium(I) Compound</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>UV irradiation of solutions of a guanidinateo dimagnesium(I) compound, [{(Priso)Mg}  2  ]  3  (Priso = [(DipN)  2  CNPr  i  2  ]  &#8208;  ), in either benzene, toluene, xylenes, or mesitylene, leads to activation of an aromatic C&#8210;H bond of the solvent, and formation of aryl/hydride bridged magnesium(II) products, [{(Priso)Mg}  2  (m&#8208;H)(m&#8208;Ar)]  4  &#8208;  9  . These C&#8210;H activations proceed with little regioselectivity, though they are considerably faster. Reaction of  3  with an excess of the pyridine,  p  &#8208;NC  5  H  4  Bu  t  (py  Bu  t  ), gave [(Priso)Mg(py  Bu  t  H)(py  Bu  t  )  2  ]  10  , presumably  via  reduction of the pyridine to yield a radical intermediate, [(Priso)Mg(py  Bu  t  &#183;)(py  Bu  t  )  2  ]  11  , which then abstracts a proton from the reaction solvent or a reactant. DFT calculations imply that the observed arene C&#8210;H activations proceed  via  photochemical cleavage of the Mg&#8210;Mg bond of  3  , generating magnesium(I) radicals, (Priso)Mg&#183;. These then doubly reduce the arene substrate to give &#8220;Birch&#8208;like&#8221; products, which subsequently rearrange  via  C&#8210;H activation of the arene. Circumstantial evidence for the photochemical generation of transient magnesium radical species include the fact that irradiation of a cyclohexane solution of  3  leads to an intramolecular aliphatic C&#8210;H activation process and formation of an alkyl&#8208;bridged magnesium(II) species, [{Mg(m&#8208;Priso  &#8208;H  )}  2  ]  12  . Furthermore, irradiation of a 1:1 mixture of  3  and the b&#8208;diketiminato dimagnesium(I) compound, [{(  Dip  Nacnac)Mg}  2  ], effects a &#8220;scrambling&#8221; reaction, and the formation of an unsymmetrical dimagnesium(I) compound, [(Priso)Mg&#8210;Mg(  Dip  Nacnac)]  13  . Finally, the EPR spectrum (77 K)&#160;of UV irradiated  3  is dominated by a broad featureless signal, indicating the presence of a radical species.</dc:description>

         <title>The sulfur rich fluorothiophosphate dianions [S5P2F2]2&#8208; and [S3PF]2&#8208;: Cluster and chelation control of P&#8208;S Heterolysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The sulfur rich diphosphate dianion [S  5  P  2  F  2  ]  2&#8208;  , from fluoride addition to P  4  S  10  , has a somewhat checkered history and proves to be the main product of the reaction in acetonitrile. Its optimized synthesis, and structural characterization, as the tetrapropylammonium salt, [N  n  Pr  4  ]  2  [S  5  P  2  F  2  ] allows for the first coordination chemistry for this dianion. Reactions of [S  5  P  2  F  2  ]  2&#8208;  with d  10  metal ions of zinc(II), and cadmium(II), and d  9  copper(II) resulted in a surprising diverse array of binding modes and structural motifs. In addition to the simple bis&#8208;chelate coordination of [S  5  P  2  F  2  ]  2&#8208;  with zinc, cleavage of the P&#8208;S bond resulted in complexes with the unusual [S  3  PF]  2&#8208;  fluorotrithiophosphate dianion. This was observed in two cluster complexes: a trinuclear cadmium complex with mixed [S  5  P  2  F  2  ]  2&#8208;  /[S  3  PF]  2&#8208;  ligands, [Cd  3  (S  5  P  2  F  2  )  3  (S  3  PF)  2  ]  4&#8208;  as well as an octanuclear copper cluster, [Cu  8  (S  3  PF)  6  ]  4&#8208;  which form rapidly at room temperature. These new metal/sulfur/ligand clusters are of relevance to understanding multimetal binding to metallothionines, and to potential capping strategies for the condensed nanoparticulate cadmium chalcogenide semiconductors CdS and CdSe.</dc:description>

         <title>How Water and Ion Mobility Affect the NMR Fingerprints of the Hydrated JBW Zeolite: a Combined Computational&#8208;Experimental Investigation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An important aspect within zeolite synthesis is to make fully tunable framework materials with controlled aluminium distribution. A major challenge in characterising these zeolites at operating conditions is the presence of water. In this work, we investigate the effect of hydration on the  27  Al NMR parameters of the ultracrystalline K,Na&#8208;compensated aluminosilicate JBW zeolite using experimental and computational techniques. The JBW framework, with Si/Al ratio of 1, is an ideal benchmark system as a stepping stone towards more complicated zeolites. The presence and mobility of water and extraframework species directly affect NMR fingerprints. Excellent agreement between theoretical and experimental spectra is obtained provided dynamic methods are employed with hydrated structural models. This work shows how NMR is instrumental in characterising aluminium distributions in zeolites at operating conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Photo&#8208;oxidizing Ruthenium(II) Complexes with Enhanced Visible Light Absorption and G&#8208;quadruplex DNA Binding Abilities</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photosensitizers that gather high photo&#8208;oxidizing power and strong visible light absorption are of great interest in the development of new photo&#8208;chemotherapeutics. Indeed, such compounds constitute attractive candidates for the design of type I photosensitizers that are not dependent on the presence of oxygen. In this paper, we report on the synthesis and studies of new ruthenium(II) complexes that display strong visible light absorption and can oxidize guanine residues under visible light irradiation, as evidenced by nanosecond transient absorption spectroscopy. The reported compounds also tightly bind to G&#8208;quadruplex DNA structuresfrom the human telomeric sequence (TTAGGG repeat). The kinetic and thermodynamic parameters of the interaction of these Ru(II) complexes with G&#8208;quadruplex and duplex DNA were studied thanks to luminescence titrations and bio&#8208;layer interferometry measurements, which revealed higher affinities towards the non&#8208;canonical G&#8208;quadruplex architecture. Docking experiments and non&#8208;covalent ionic analysis allowed to gain information on the mode and the strength of the interaction of the compounds towards G&#8208;quadruplex and duplex DNA. The different studies emphasize the substantial influence of the position and the number of non&#8208;chelating nitrogen atoms on the interaction with both types of DNA secondary structures.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemotactic Colloidal Motor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemotaxis plays a crucial role in the realization of various functions of human life such as fertilization, immune function, inflammatory response, regeneration process. Inspired by the natural chemotaxis, colloidal motors with chemotactic ability can realize intelligent sense and targeted navigation, which bring a revolutionary method to biomedical applications like precision medicine. However, the application in the biomedical field requires the colloidal motors with submicrometer scale, strong chemotactic ability and clear chemotactic mechanism. In this concept article, we introduce the recent progress of chemotactic colloidal motors, covering the fundamental theory behind experimental advancements. Particularly, the torque&#8208;driven reorientation motion of the submicrometer&#8208;sized colloidal motors during chemotaxis is discussed, and also their underlying mechanism is proposed. With the continuous research on chemotactic colloidal motors, it is believed that the emerging chemotactic colloidal motors will broaden practical applications in the biomedical field.</dc:description>

         <title>Analysis of the magnetic coupling in a Mn(II)&#8208;U(V)&#8208;Mn(II) Single Molecule Magnet</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>[{Mn(TPA)I}{UO2 (Mesaldien)}{Mn(TPA)I}]I formula (here TPA = tris(2&#8208;pyridylmethyl)amine and Mesaldien = N,N&#8217;&#8208;(2&#8208;aminomethyl)diethylenebis(salicylidene imine)) reported by Mazzanti and coworkers (Chatelain et al. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2014, 53, 13434) is so far the best Single Molecule Magnet (SMM) in the {3d&#8208;5f} class of molecules exhibiting barrier height of magnetization reversal as high as 81.0 K. In this work, we have employed a combination of ab initio CAS and DFT methods to fully characterize this compound and to extract the relevant spin Hamiltonian parameters. We show that the signs of the magnetic coupling and of the g&#8208;factors of the monomers are interconnected. The central magnetic unit [U  V  O  2  ]  +  is described by a Kramers Doublet (KD) with negative g&#8208;factors, due to a large orbital contribution. The magnetic coupling for the {Mn(II)&#8208;U(V)} pair is modeled by an anisotropic exchange Hamiltonian: all components are ferromagnetic in terms of spin moments, the parallel component J Z twice larger as the perpendicular one J  &#8869;  . The spin density distribution suggests that spin polarization on the U(V) center favors the ferromagnetic coupling. Further, the J  Z  /J  &#8869;  ratio, which is related to the barrier height, was found to correlate to the corresponding spin contribution of the g&#8208;factors of the U(V) center. This correlation established for the first time offers a direct way to estimate this important ratio from the corresponding g  S  &#8208;values, which can be obtained using traditional ab initio packages and hence has a wider application to other {3d&#8208;5f} magnets. It is finally shown that the magnetization barrier height is tuned by the splitting of the [U  V  O  2  ]  +  5f orbitals.</dc:description>

         <title>Intracellular Assembly of Interacting Enzymes Yields Highly&#8208;Active Nanoparticles for Flow Biocatalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>All&#8208;enzyme hydrogel (AEH) particles with a hydrodynamic diameter of up to 120 nm were produced intracellularly with an  Escherichia coli  &#8208;based  in vivo  system. The inCell&#8208;AEH nanoparticles were generated from polycistronic vectors enabling simultaneous expression of two interacting enzymes, the  Lactobacillus brevis  alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and the  Bacillus subtilis  glucose&#8208;1&#8208;dehydrogenase (GDH), fused with a SpyCatcher or SpyTag, respectively. Formation of inCell&#8208;AEH was analyzed by dynamic light scattering and atomic force microscopy. Using the stereoselective two&#8208;step reduction of a prochiral diketone substrate, we show that the inCell&#8208;AEH approach can be advantageously used in whole&#8208;cell flow&#8208;biocatalysis, where flow reactors could be operated for &gt;4 days under constant substrate perfusion. More importantly, the inCell&#8208;AEH concept enables the recovery of efficient catalyst materials for stable flow bioreactors in a simple and economical one&#8208;step procedure from crude bacterial lysates. We believe that our method will contribute to further optimization of sustainable biocatalytic processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Design of a Photocatalytic [2 + 2] Cycloaddition Reaction Using Redox&#8208;Tag Strategy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Design of photocatalytic processes is important for a sustainable society. The electron transfer process is the key to the photocatalytic process. Herein, we focused on titanium dioxide photocatalyzed organic synthesis and designed a new [2 + 2] cycloaddition reaction based on the electron transfer process. Electron transfer not only between the substrate and the photocatalyst but also inter&#8208; and intramolecularly, is an important consideration for reaction design. Radical cations were generated by the photocatalyst and trapped by alkenes. The resultant cyclobutyl radical cations were immediately reduced by the aryl rings via intramolecular electron transfer to obtain cyclobutane rings. The outcome of the reaction was controlled by substitution of the aryl ring and the linker connecting the aryl ring to the enol ether. Carefully&#8208;designed substrates were highly effective for photocatalytic cycloaddition.</dc:description>

         <title>Terpyridine Diphosphine Ruthenium Complexes as Efficient Photocatalysts for the Transfer Hydrogenation of Carbonyl Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The cationic achiral and chiral terpyridine diphosphine ruthenium complexes [RuCl(PP)(tpy)]Cl (PP = dppp (  1  ), (  R  ,  R  )&#8208;Skewphos (  2  ) and (  S  ,  S  )&#8208;Skewphos (  3  )) are easily obtained in 85&#8208;88% yield through a one&#8208;pot synthesis from [RuCl  2  (PPh  3  )  3  ], the diphosphine and 2,2&#8242;:6&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;terpyridine (tpy) in 1&#8208;butanol. Treatment of  1  &#8208;  3  with NaPF  6  in methanol at RT affords quantitatively the corresponding derivatives [RuCl(PP)(tpy)]PF  6  (PP = dppp (  1a  ), (  R  ,  R  )&#8208;Skewphos (  2a  ) and (  S  ,  S  )&#8208;Skewphos (  3a  )). Reaction of [RuCl  2  (PPh  3  )  3  ] with (  S  ,  R  )&#8208;Josiphos or (  R  )&#8208;BINAP in toluene, followed by treatment with tpy in 1&#8208;butanol and finally with NaPF  6  in MeOH gives [RuCl(PP)(tpy)]PF  6  (PP = (  S  ,  R  )&#8208;Josiphos (  4a  ), (  R  )&#8208;BINAP (  5a  )) isolated in 78 and 86% yield, respectively.

         <dc:description>An unprecedented, Brookhart&#8217;s acid catalyzed temperature switchable regioselective divergent approach for  N  &#8208;alkylation of arylamines and heterocyclic amines by utilising cyclopropylcarbinols is presented herein. The reaction offers  N  &#8208;alkylated cyclopropyl derivatives and homoallyl amines by employing 2.5 mol% catalyst loading at different temperatures in excellent regioselectivity and yields. This method has shown to be relevant with a wide range of cyclopropylcarbinols, including aliphatic ones. Several control experiments and spectroscopic studies have been performed to gain insight into the reaction mechanism. Further, the synthetic utility of the protocol has also been described.</dc:description>

         <title>Three&#8208;ligand Co&#8208;assembled 2D Au(I)&#8208;Thiolate Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) Au(I)&#8208;thiolate (AT) assemblies are a special type of material that can balance high structural stability and rich surface functionality, which show promising prospects in both fundamental research and applications. Co&#8208;assembly of multiple ligands is a facile way to further enrich the surface properties and functions, and expand their application potentials. In this work, taking 3&#8208;mercaptopropionic acid (MPA), cysteine (Cys) and 1&#8208;thioglycerol (TGO) as example ligands, we studied in detail the possibility to co&#8208;assemble them into one nanosheet. Although the three ligands have significantly different controllability and pathways when self&#8208;assembling individually with Au(I), they can still be effectively co&#8208;assembled by reacting with HAuCl  4  together to obtain three&#8208;ligand nanosheets with good colloidal stability. The key points for successful co&#8208;assembly are also revealed by comparing single&#8208; and three&#8208;ligand self&#8208;assembly processes, laying a solid foundation for co&#8208;assembly of even more ligands. The easy but powerful strategy for 2D materials with closely&#8208;packed and multiple tunable surface functional groups addresses the surface engineering problem for 2D materials and pave the way for their wider applications in sensing and biomaterials.</dc:description>

         <title>Restrictive Regulation of Ionic Liquid Quaternary Ammonium Salt in SBA&#8208;15 Pore Channel for Efficient Carbon Dioxide Conversion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The cycloaddition reaction of CO  2  and epoxides is an efficient way of carbon fixation. Herein, a new type of catalysts SBA&#8208;M (Schiff complex of different metal types grafted on SBA&#8208;15) based on a quaternization reaction was synthesized. The different amount of ionic liquid was added into SBA&#8208;15 by the post&#8208;grafting method, by which ionic liquid can be grafted into pore channel restrictively. SBA&#8208;Mn (0.2) (0.2 represented that the amount of ionic liquid is 0.2 mmol) with metal and halogen active sites into the pore channel showed high PC (propylene carbonate) yields and selectivity for five different epoxides at 90 &#176;C. Notably, SBA&#8208;Mn (0.2) has been demonstrated to maintain its catalytic activity and stability for over six cycles. Besides, we proposed a reaction mechanism for cycloaddition of CO  2  with epoxides by density&#8208;functional theory, showing that the metal was coordinated to oxygen atom of epoxide, and the halogen attacked the &#946; carbon of epoxide. Moreover, the theoretical calculations and synthesis strategy shows great potential for CO  2  conversion.</dc:description>

         <title>Plasma&#8208;Assisted Coupling Reactions of Dinitrogen and Carbon Dioxide Mediated by Monometallic YB1&#8722;4&#8722; Anions: Carbon&#8722;Nitrogen Bond Formation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition&#8208;metal catalyzed coupling to form C&#8722;N bonds is significant in chemical science. However, the inert nature of N  2  and CO  2  renders their coupling quite challenging. Herein, we report the activation of dinitrogen in the mild plasma atmosphere by the gas&#8208;phase monometallic YB  1&#8722;4  &#8722;  anions and further coupling of CO  2  to form C&#8722;N bonds by using mass spectrometry and theoretical calculation. The observed product anions are NCNBO  &#8722;  and N(BO)  2  &#8722;  , accompanied by the formation of neutral products YO and YB  0&#8722;2  NC, respectively. We can tune the reactivity and the type of products by manipulating the number of B atoms. The B atoms in YB  1&#8722;4  N  2  &#8722;  act as electron donors in CO  2  reduction reactions, and the carbon atom originating from CO  2  serves as an electron reservoir. This is the first example of gas&#8208;phase monometallic anions, which are capable to realize the functionalization of N  2  with CO  2  &#160;through C&#8722;N bond formation and N&#8722;N and C&#8722;O bond cleavage.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two&#8208;dimensional conductive metal&#8208;organic frameworks (2D c&#8208;MOFs) are a family of highly tunable and electrically conducting materials that can be utilized in optoelectronics. A major issue of 2D c&#8208;MOFs for photodetection is their poor charge separation and recombination dynamics upon illumination. This study demonstrates a Cu3(HHTP)2/ZnO type&#8208;II heterojunction ultraviolet (UV) photodetector fabricated by Layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer (LbL) deposition, in which the charge separation of photogenerated carriers is enhanced. At optimized MOF layer cycles, the device achieves a responsivity of 78.2 A/W and detectivity of 3.8&#215;109 Jones at 1 V. Particularly, the device can be operated in the self&#8208;powered mode with an ultrafast response time of 70 &#956;s, which is the record value for MOF&#8208;based photodetectors. In addition, even after 1000&#8208;time bending of 180&#176;, the flexible device maintains stable performance. This flexible MOF&#8208;based UV photodetector with anti&#8208;fatigue and anti&#8208;bending properties provides strong implication to wearable optoelectronics.</dc:description>

         <title>Experimental and Computational Insights on the Influence of Organic Co&#8208;solvent on Structural and Catalytic Properties of a Biocatalyst: Inhibitory Effect of DMSO on Halohydrin Dehalogenase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although the application of organic solvents in biocatalysis is well explored, in&#8208;depth understanding of solvent interactions with proteins, in particular oligomeric ones, is still scant. Understanding of these interactions is essential in tailoring enzymes for industrially relevant catalysis in nonaqueous media. In our study, homotetrameric enzyme halohydrin dehalogenase (HHDH) from  Agrobacterium radiobacter  AD1 (HheC) was investigated, as a model system, in DMSO&#8208;water solvent mixtures. DMSO, the most commonly used co&#8208;solvent for biocatalytic transformations, was found to act as a mixed&#8208;type inhibitor with a prevalent competitive contribution. Already 5% (v/v) DMSO inhibits the activity of HheC by half. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations showed that DMSO keeps close to Ser&#8208;Tyr catalytic residues forming alternate H&#8208;bonds with them. Stability measurements paired with differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), dynamic light scattering (DLS) methods and MD studies revealed that HheC conserves structural integrity in content as high as 30% (v/v) DMSO.</dc:description>

         <title>Revealing Phosphorus Nitrides up to the Megabar Regime: Synthesis of &#945;&#8242;&#8208;P3N5, &#948;&#8208;P3N5 and PN2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Non&#8208;metal nitrides are an exciting field of chemistry, featuring a significant number of compounds that can possess outstanding materials properties. This characteristic relies on maximizing the number of strong covalent bonds, with crosslinked XN 6 octahedra frameworks being particularly intriguing. In this study, the phosphorus&#8208;nitrogen system was studied up to 137 GPa in laser&#8208;heated diamond anvil cells and three previously unobserved phases were synthesized and characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy measurements and density functional theory calculations. &#948;&#8208;P 3 N 5 and PN 2 were found to form at 72 and 134 GPa, respectively, and both feature dense 3D networks of the so far elusive PN 6 units. The two are ultra&#8208;incompressible, having a bulk modulus of K 0 = 322 GPa for &#948;&#8208;P 3 N 5 and of K 0 = 339 GPa for PN 2 . Upon decompression below 7 GPa, &#948;&#8208;P 3 N 5 undergoes a transformation into a novel &#945;&#8242;&#8208;P 3 N 5 solid, stable at ambient conditions, that has a unique structure type based on PN 4 tetrahedra. The formation of &#945;&#8242;&#8208;P 3 N 5 underlines that a phase space otherwise inaccessible can be explored through high&#8208;pressure formed phases.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract:  &#160;This study aims to deepen the knowledge of the current state of rational G4&#8208;ligand design through the design and synthesis of a novel set of compounds based on indoles, quinolines, and benzofurans and their comparisons with well&#8208;known G4&#8208;ligands. This resulted in novel synthetic methods and G4&#8208;ligands that bind and stabilise G4 DNA with high selectivity. Furthermore, the study corroborates previous studies on the design of G4&#8208;ligands and adds deeper explanations to why&#160;a)&#160;macrocycles offer advantages in terms of G4&#8208;binding and &#8208;selectivity,&#160;b)&#160;molecular pre&#8208;organisation is of key importance in the development of strong novel binders,&#160;c)&#160;an electron&#8208;deficient aromatic core is essential to engage in strong arene&#8208;arene interactions with the G4&#8208;surface, and&#160;d)&#160;aliphatic amines can strengthen interactions indirectly through changing the arene electrostatic nature of the compound. Finally, fundamental physicochemical properties of selected G4&#8208;binders are evaluated, underscoring the complexity of aligning the properties required for efficient G4 binding and stabilisation with feasible pharmacokinetic properties.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A novel Pd&#8208;catalysed oxidative coupling between benzoic acids and vinylarenes or acrylates to furnish isocoumarins and phtalides is reported. The reaction proceeds smoothly in molten tetrabutylammonium acetate  via  a selective C&#8208;H bond activation, with very low percentage of ligand&#8208;free palladium acetate as the catalyst, under atmospheric pressure of oxygen. Sub&#8208;stoichiometric amount of copper acetate is also required as a reoxidant for the palladium.</dc:description>

         <title>Leveraging Metal and Ligand Reactive Sites for One Pot Reactions: Ligand&#8208;Centered Borenium Ions for Tandem Catalysis with Palladium</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tandem catalysts that perform two different organic transformations in a single pot are highly desirable because they enable rapid and efficient assembly of simple organic building blocks into more complex molecules. Many examples of tandem catalysis rely on metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions involving one or more metal complexes. Remarkably, despite surging interest in the development of chemically reactive (i.e. noninnocent) ligands, there are few examples of metal complexes that leverage ligand&#8208;centered reactivity to perform catalytic reactions in tandem with separate catalytic reactions at the metal. Here we report how multifunctional Pd complexes with triaminoborane&#8208;derived diphosphorus ligands, called TBDPhos, appear to facilitate borenium&#8208;catalyzed cycloaddition reactions at the ligand, and Pd&#8208;catalyzed Stille and Suzuki cross&#8208;coupling reactions at the metal. Both transformations can be accessed in one pot to afford rare examples of tandem catalysis using separate metal and ligand catalysis sites in a single complex.</dc:description>

         <title>Advanced and Designing Strategies in Polymeric Antifungal Agents Inspired by Membrane&#8208;Active Peptides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The high&#8208;mortality invasive fungal infections seriously threaten the lives of immunocompromised people. Host defense peptides and cell&#8208;penetrating peptides are representative membrane&#8208;active peptides with different functions. Among them, host defense peptides mimicking is a valid strategy in the design of synthetic antifungal agents. Despite the brilliance in the field of intracellular delivery, the potential of cell&#8208;penetrating peptides and their mimics for designing antifungal agents has been overlooked. In this concept article, we describe the structural design of synthetic antifungal polymers as mimics of host defense peptides, and highlight the effectiveness and potential of cell&#8208;penetrating peptide&#8208;inspired strategy in designing potent and selective antifungal polymeric agents. In addition, an outlook for further expanding the design horizons of antifungal polymers is also presented.</dc:description>

         <title>"Crystal memory" affects the properties of peptide hydrogels &#8208; the case of the cyclic Tyr&#8208;Tyr dipeptide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work a relationship between the crystal form and morphology and rheological properties of peptide&#8208;based hydrogels is examined. We show, that under favorable circumstances a correlation between a starting solid material and a self&#8208;assembly processes in solution can exist, leading to different properties of a resulting soft matter. This observation, together with an in&#8208;depth analysis of the influence of stereochemistry of self&#8208;assembled (  ll  ) and (  dl  ) Tyr&#8208;Tyr cyclic dipeptides (cYY) on the observed relationship between gelation and crystallization allowed us to gain a deeper understanding of the peptide hydrogelation processes at a molecular level, using liquid state NMR, rheological studies and scanning electron microscopy. In the course of our studies, several crystal forms of (  ll  )&#8208;cYY has been discovered and described in details using single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, as well as advanced solid state NMR, X&#8208;ray diffraction of powders, thermal analysis, FT&#8208;IR, circular dichroism and crystal structure prediction (CSP) calculations. Subsequently, we found that while (  ll  )&#8208;cYY easily assembles into hydrogels with different properties depending on the starting solid form, (  dl  )&#8208;cYY always precipitated as one crystal form in the tested conditions. Molecular&#8208;level justification for this observation is given.</dc:description>

         <title>Pushing the Limits of Nucleic Acid Function</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>For many decades it was thought that information storage and information transfer were the main functions of nucleic acids. However, artificial evolution experiments have shown that the functional potential of DNA and RNA is much greater. Here I provide an overview of this technique and highlight recent advances which have increased its potency. I also describe how artificial evolution has been used to identify nucleic acids with extreme functions. These include deoxyribozymes that generate unusual products such as light, tiny motifs made up of fewer&#160;than ten nucleotides, ribozymes that catalyze complex reactions such as RNA polymerization, information&#8208;rich sequences that encode overlapping ribozymes, motifs that catalyze reactions at rates too fast to be followed by manual pipetting, and functional nucleic acids which are active in extreme conditions. Such motifs highlight the limits of our knowledge and provide clues about as of yet undiscovered functions of DNA and RNA.</dc:description>

         <title>Inhibition of urease by hydroquinones: a structural and kinetic study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydroquinones are a class of organic compounds abundant in nature which result from the full reduction of the corresponding quinones. Quinones are known to efficiently inhibit urease, a Ni(II)&#8208;containing enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of urea to yield ammonia and carbonate and acts as a virulence factor of several human pathogens, in addition to decreasing the efficiency of soil organic nitrogen fertilization. Here, we report the molecular characterization of the inhibition of urease from  Sporosarcina pasteurii  (SPU) and  Canavalia ensiformis  (jack bean, JBU) by 1,4&#8208;hydroquinone (HQ) and its methyl&#8208; and  tert  &#8208;butyl&#8208; derivatives. The 1.63&#8208;&#197; resolution X&#8208;ray crystal structure of the SPU&#8208;HQ complex discloses that HQ covalently binds to the thiol group of &#945;Cys322, a key residue located on a mobile protein flap directly involved in the catalytic mechanism. Inhibition k inetic data obtained for the three compounds on JBU revealed the occurrence of an irreversible inactivation process that involves a radical&#8208;based autocatalytic mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Thiazole Boron Difluoride Dyes with Large Stokes Shift, Solid State Emission and Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The small Stokes shift and weak emission in the solid state are two main shortcomings associated with the boron&#8208;dipyrromethene (BODIPY) family of dyes. We present herein the design, synthesis and luminescent properties of boron difluoro complexes of 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;5&#8208;alkylamino&#8208;4&#8208;alkylaminocarbonylthiazoles. &#160;These dyes display&#160; Stokes shifts (&#8710; &#955; ,&#160; 77&#8208;101 nm) with quantum yields (  &#934;  FL  ) up to 64.9 and 34.7% in toluene solution and in solid state, respectively. Some of these compounds exhibit dual fluorescence and room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) emission properties with modulable phosphorescence quantum yields (  &#934;  PL  ) and lifetime ( &#964;  p  &#160;up to 251&#160; &#956; s). The presence of intramolecular H&#8208;bonds and negligible&#160; p &#8208; p &#160;stacking revealed by X&#8208;ray crystal structure might account for the observed large Stokes shift and significant solid&#8208;state emission of these fluorophores, while the enhanced spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC) of iodine and the self&#8208;assembly driven by halogen bonding,&#160; &#960; &#8208; &#960; &#160;and C&#8208;H  &#8230;  &#928; &#160;interactions could be responsible for the observed RTP of iodine containing phosphors.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We disclose a novel doubly cyclopentannulated carbazole which is accessible through a successive &#960;&#8208;expansion of di(1&#8208;naphthylamine).

         <title>Detection of Reactive Oxygen and Nitrogen Species via Upconversion Nanoparticle&#8208;Based Near&#8208;infrared Nanoprobes: Recent Progress and Perspectives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) are essential oxidative metabolites of organisms, which are closely related to physiological, pathological and pharmacological processes. The accurate detection of ROS/RNS is important for the understanding of biological processes, monitoring of pharmacological effects, and predicting the course of disease. The recently developed NIR nanoprobes based on upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) hold great prospects in sensitive and deep&#8208;tissue detection of ROS/RNS, and considerable progress has been achieved so far. In this review, we systematically summarize the up&#8208;to&#8208;date advances of UCNPs&#8208;based NIR probes for ROS/RNS sensing, and the potential challenges and perspectives for further research are also highlighted. We envision that such a research field will have a bright future for modern biomedical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Approach for Expanding the Three&#8208;Dimensional Space of Tetrahydroquinoline to Develop BET Bromodomain Inhibitors**</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The pharmaceutical industry has a pervasive need for chiral specific molecules with optimal affinity for their biological targets. However, the mass production of such compounds is currently limited by conventional chemical routes, that are costly and have an environmental impact. Here, we propose an easy access to obtain new tetrahydroquinolines, a motif found in many bioactive compounds, that is rapid and cost effective. Starting from simple raw materials, the procedure uses a proline&#8208;catalyzed Mannich reaction followed by the addition of BF  3  .OEt  2  , which generates a highly electrophilic aza&#8208;  ortho  &#8208;quinone methide intermediate capable of reacting with different nucleophiles to form the diversely functionalized tetrahydroquinoline. Moreover, this enantioselective one&#8208;pot process provides access for the first time to tetrahydroquinolines with a  cis  &#8208;2,3 and  trans  &#8208;3,4 configuration. As proof of concept, we demonstrate that a three&#8208;step reaction sequence, from simple and inexpensive starting compounds and catalysts, can generate a BD2&#8208;selective BET bromodomain inhibitor with anti&#8208;inflammatory effect.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The pharmaceutical industry has a pervasive need for chiral specific molecules with optimal affinity for their biological targets. However, the mass production of such compounds is currently limited by conventional chemical routes, that are costly and have an environmental impact. Here, we propose an easy access to obtain new tetrahydroquinolines, a motif found in many bioactive compounds, that is rapid and cost effective. Starting from simple raw materials, the procedure uses a proline-catalyzed Mannich reaction followed by the addition of BF  3  .OEt  2  , which generates a highly electrophilic aza-  ortho  -quinone methide intermediate capable of reacting with different nucleophiles to form the diversely functionalized tetrahydroquinoline. Moreover, this enantioselective one-pot process provides access for the first time to tetrahydroquinolines with a  cis  -2,3 and  trans  -3,4 configuration. As proof of concept, we demonstrate that a three-step reaction sequence, from simple and inexpensive starting compounds and catalysts, can generate a BD2-selective BET bromodomain inhibitor with anti-inflammatory effect.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Lewis Acid Stabilized Ketenimine in an Unusual Variant of the Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) can provide a straightforward approach to the efficient synthesis of functionalized complex aromatic molecules. In general, Lewis acids serve as a beneficial stimulus for the formation of a Wheland complex, the intermediate in the classical S  E  Ar mechanism of EAS, which is responsible for H / E (E = electrophile) substitution under formal H  +  elimination. Herein, we report a new variant of EAS, in which a complex molecule such as the tricyanomethane, HC(CN)  3  , is activated with a strong Lewis acid (B(C  6  F  5  )  3  ) to the point where it can finally be used in an EAS. However, the Lewis acid here causes the isomerization of the tricyano&#173;methane to the ketenimine, HN=C=C(CN)  2  , which in turn directly attacks the aromatic species in the EAS, with simultaneous proton migration of the aromatic proton to the imino group, so that no elimination occurs that is otherwise observed in the S  E  Ar mechanism. By this method, it is possible to build up amino&#8208;malononitrile&#8208;substituted aromatic compounds in one step.</dc:description>

         <title>Templated generation of a Bcl&#8208;xL inhibitor by isomer&#8208;free SPAAC based on azacyclonon&#8208;5&#8208;yne</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;affinity inhibitors of large protein&#8208;protein interactions often have a high molecular weight, which compromises their cell permeability and oral bioavailability. We recently presented isomer&#8208;free, strain&#8208;promoted azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (iSPAAC) as a method by which to generate large, chemically uniform bioactive molecules inside living cells from two smaller components with higher cell permeability. Here, we present the synthesis of Fmoc&#8208;protected azacyclonon&#8208;5&#8208;yne (Fmoc&#8208;ACN) as the first cyclononyne suitable for iSPAAC. ACN facilitated the structure&#8208;guided development of a single&#8208;digit micromolar triazole inhibitor of the protein&#8208;protein interaction domain of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl&#8208;xL. Inhibitor formation in aqueous buffer at 37 &#176;C, templated by the target protein Bcl&#8208;xL, proceeded 2.800 times faster than the reaction between Fmoc&#8208;ACN and benzyl azide under standard conditions in acetonitrile. Our data demonstrate the utility of cyclononynes for iSPAAC and their potential for achieving vastly accelerated templated reactions in the aqueous environment.</dc:description>

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Cyclization of 1,6&#8208;Enynes via Intramolecular Chlorine Transfer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Palladium&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective cyclization of enynes has contributed significantly to the construction of chiral cyclic molecules. In contrast, the catalytic asymmetric cyclization involving halopalladation remains an unresolved challenge with the inevitable disturbance of the halide ions. Herein, an intramolecular chlorine transfer strategy is used to accomplish the enantioselective chloropalladation cyclization of 1,6&#8208;enynes. This reaction provides a redox&#8208;neutral approach to a variety of chiral &#945;&#8208;chloromethylene&#8208;&#947;&#8208;butyrolactones with excellent E selectivity and enantioselectivity. The precisely controlled coordination of palladium with both the in&#8208;situ generated nucleophilic species and the monodentate phosphoramidite ligand is crucial for enantioselectivity.</dc:description>
