         <title>Development of novel redox&#8208;active organic materials based on benzimidazole, benzoxazole, and benzothiazole &#8211; a combined theoretical and experimental screening approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sustainability is one of the hot topics of todays&#8217; research, in particular when it comes to energy storage systems such as batteries. Redox&#8208;active molecules implemented in organic batteries represent a promising alternative to lithium&#8208;ion batteries, which partially rely on non&#8208;sustainable heavy metal salts. As an alternative, we propose benzothiazole, &#8208;oxazole and &#8208;imidazole derivatives as redox&#8208;active moieties for polymers in organic (radical) batteries. The target mole&#173;cules have been identified by a combination of theoretical and experimental approaches for the investigation of new organic active materials. Herein, we present the synthesis, electrochemical cha&#173;rac&#173;terization and theoretical investigation of the proposed molecules, which can later be introduced into a polymer backbone and utilized in organic polymer batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Breaking radial dipole symmetry in planar macrocycles modulates edge&#8208;edge packing and disrupts cofacial stacking</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dipolar interactions are ever&#8208;present in supramolecular architectures though their impact is typically revealed by making dipoles stronger. While it is also possible to assess the role of dipoles by altering their orientations using synthetic design, doing so without altering molecular shape is not straightforward. We do this by flipping one triazole unit in a rigid macrocycle, tricarb. The macrocycle is composed of three carbazoles (2 Debye) and three triazoles (5 Debye) defining an array of dipoles aligned radially but organized alternately in and out. These dipoles are believed to dictate edge&#8208;to&#8208;edge tiling and face&#8208;to&#8208;face stacking. We modified our synthesis to prepare isosteric macrocycles with the orientation of one triazole dipole rotated 40&#176;. The new dipole orientations guide edge&#8208;edge contacts to reorder the stability of two surface&#8208;bound 2D polymorphs. The impact on dipole&#8208;enhanced &#960; stacking, however, was unexpected. Our stacking model identified an unchanged set of short&#8208;range (3.4 &#197;) anti&#8208;parallel dipole contacts. Despite this situation, the reduction in self&#8208;association was attributed to long&#8208;range (~6.4 &#197;) dipolar repulsions between &#960;&#8208;stacked macrocycles. This work highlighted our ability to control the build&#8208;up and symmetry of macrocyclic skeletons by synthetic design, and the work needed to further our understanding of how dipoles control self&#8208;assembly.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Chiral Aza/Boracyclophanes with a meta and para Substitution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We herein describe the synthesis of a new class of axially chiral aza/boracyclophanes (BDN1, BXN1, BDB1 and BXB1) using binaphthyls as chiral building blocks and the main&#8208;group (B/N) chemistry with tunable electronic effects. All macrocycles substituted with triarylamine donors or triarylborane acceptors are strongly luminescent. These macrocycles showed two distinct meta and para &#960;&#8208;conjugation pathways, leading to the formation of quasi figure&#8208;of&#8208;eight and square&#8208;shaped conformations. Interestingly, comparison of such structural models revealed that the former type of macrocycles BXN1 and BXB1 gave higher racemization barriers relative to the other ones. The results reported here may provide a new approach to engineer the optical stability of &#960;&#8208;conjugated chiral macrocycles by controlling &#960;&#8208;substitution patterns. The ring constraints induced by macrocyclization were also demonstrated to contribute to the configurational persistence as compared with the open&#8208;chain analoguesp&#8208;BTT and m&#8208;BTT.</dc:description>

         <title>Simple Synthesis of 1,2&#8208;Dideoxy&#8208;2&#8208;Vinyl Carbohydrates by Tin&#8208;Free Radical Reactions of Xanthates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Radical and non&#8208;toxic: C&#8208;Branched carbohydrates 3 are easily available from glycals 1 via xanthates 2. Key step is a radical reaction with triethylborane, which proceeds under mild conditions with high regioselectivity. Various side products have been isolated in pure form. They speak for a reversible ring&#8208;opening of the intermediary cyclopropylmethyl radicals, which is interesting for the mechanistic understanding of such reactions.







Abstract
Vinyl&#8208;substituted carbohydrates have been synthesized from glycals derived from hexoses and pentoses. Key step is the radical reaction of xanthates in the presence of triethylborane, a non&#8208;toxic reagent. The mechanism has been investigated by isolation of various side products, which speak for a reversibility of the cyclopropylmethyl radical ring&#8208;opening. Compared to reactions with tributyltin hydride, higher regioselectivities in favor of the 2&#8208;vinyl&#8208;substituted sugars have been obtained. Yields are slightly lower with triethylborane, but all products have been isolated in analytically pure form. The new reaction is applicable to benzyl&#8208; and silyl&#8208;protected carbohydrates, which makes free sugars accessible as well. Overall, more than 15 1,2&#8208;dideoxy&#8208;2&#8208;vinyl carbohydrates have been synthesized from simple precursors in only few steps.

         <title>Catalyst&#8208;Free Transfer Hydrogenation from Amine&#8208;Borane Small Oligomers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Small hydrogen&#8208;rich amine&#8208;borane oligomers were prepared via capping agent&#8208;controlled AA/BB polycondensation. Solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy, Differential Scanning Calorimetry and reactivity in catalyst&#8208;free transfer hydrogenations &#8211; to aldehydes, imines, electron&#8208;poor alkenes and alkynes &#8211; were used to assess how the oligomers bridge the gap between molecular amine&#8208;boranes and poly(amine&#8208;borane)s.







Abstract
Amine&#8208;borane dimers and oligomers with varied steric and electronic profiles were prepared via capping agent&#8208;controlled AA/BB polycondensations. They were used for transfer hydrogenations to aldehydes, ketones, imines as well as electron&#8208;poor alkene/alkyne moieties. The amine&#8208;borane Lewis&#8208;paired oligomers and the congested bis(amine&#8208;borane)s provided the highest yields. This was likely helped by facilitated dissociation (oligomers) or H&#8208;bond assistance. In the case of the oligomers, the second equivalent of H2 present was also engaged in the reaction. Solid&#8208;state NMR characterization provides evidence that the boron&#8208;containing materials obtained after transfer dehydrogenation are highly similar to those obtained from thermal dehydrogenation. The oligomers bridge the gap between simple amine&#8208;borane molecular reductants and the poly&#8208;amine&#8208;boranes and provide a full picture of the reactivity changes at the different scales.

We describe an approach to stabilize NIR absorbing rhodamine dyes containing phosphinate esters, affording cell permeable photoacoustic probes with maximal absorbance in the range of commercial instrumentation. A derivative of our optimal dye can used for turn&#8208;on detection of a disease relevant analyte in living cells and mice.







Abstract
Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) is an emerging imaging technique that uses pulsed laser excitation with near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light to elicit local temperature increases through non&#8208;radiative relaxation events, ultimately leading to the production of ultrasound waves. The classical xanthene dye scaffold has found numerous applications in fluorescence imaging, however, xanthenes are rarely utilized for PAI since they do not typically display NIR absorbance. Herein, we report the ability of Nebraska Red (NR) xanthene dyes to produce photoacoustic (PA) signal and provide a rational design approach to reduce the hydrolysis rate of ester containing dyes, affording cell permeable probes. To demonstrate the utility of this approach, we construct the first cell permeable rhodamine&#8208;based, turn&#8208;on PAI imaging probe for hypochlorous acid (HOCl) with maximal absorbance within the range of commercial PA instrumentation. This probe, termed SNR700&#8208;HOCl, is capable of detecting exogenous HOCl in mice. This work provides a new set of rhodamine&#8208;based PAI agents as well as a rational design approach to stabilize esterified versions of NR dyes with desirable properties for PAI. In the long term, the reagents described herein could be utilized to enable non&#8208;invasive imaging of HOCl in disease&#8208;relevant model systems.

         <title>Hydrazine Sulfonic Acid, NH3NH(SO3), the Bigger Sibling of Sulfamic Acid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrazine sulfonic acid has been structurally elucidated for the first time. Like its smaller congener, sulfamic acid, the acid crystallizes as a zwitterion in the solid state. The hydrazine sulfonate anion is accessible by deprotonation, as demonstrated for Ba[N2H3(SO3)]2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O.







Abstract
The reaction of hydrazine hydrate, N2H4&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O, and SO3 leads to hydrazine sulfonic acid (Pca21, a=849.59(4)&#8197;pm, b=482.18(2)&#8197;pm, c=832.17(4)&#8197;pm). Structure elucidation reveals the zwitter&#8208;anionic nature of the compound according to NH3NH(SO3). With the barium salt Ba[NH2NH(SO3)]2(H2O), a first salt of hydrazine sulfonic acid has been prepared (P
, a=489.75(5)&#8197;pm, b=737.52(7)&#8197;pm, c=1317.4(1)&#8197;pm, &#945;=88.238(4)&#176;, &#946;=84.761(4)&#176;, &#947;=79.701(4)&#176;). The compounds were characterized by vibrational spectroscopy, DFT calculations and thermal analyses.

         <title>Effects of Fluorinated Functionalization of Linker on Quercetin Encapsulation, Release and Hela Cell Cytotoxicity of Cu&#8208;Based MOFs as Smart pH&#8208;Stimuli Nanocarriers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two copper&#8208;based MOFs, Cu2(BDC)2DABCO and Cu2(F4BDC)2DABCO, as smart carriers of Quercetin (QU), with high loading potential and sustained release of Quercetin, were synthesized and investigated for their potential as pH stimulus nanocarriers of QU as an anticancer agent. Their interactions with QU were investigated through Grand Canonical Monte Carlo simulation calculations. Cytotoxicity was evaluated by MTT assays against HEK&#8208;293 and HeLa cell lines. Also, kinetic models of release were evaluated.







Abstract
Controlled delivery of target molecules is required in many medical and chemical applications. For such purposes, metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), which possess desirable features such as high porosity, large surface area, and adjustable functionalities, hold great potential as drug carriers. Herein, Quercetin (QU), as an anticancer drug, was loaded on Cu2(BDC)2(DABCO) and Cu2(F4BDC)2)DABCO) MOFs (BDC=1,4&#8208;benzenedicarboxylate and DABCO=1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane). As these Cu&#8208;MOFs have a high surface area, an appropriate pore size, and biocompatible ingredients, they can be utilized to deliver QU. The loading efficiency of QU in these MOFs was 49.5&#8201;% and 41.3&#8201;%, respectively. The drug&#8208;loaded compounds displayed sustained drug release over 15&#8197;days, remarkably high drug loading capacities and pH&#8208;controlled release behavior. The prepared nanostructures were characterized by different characterization technics including FT&#8208;IR, PXRD, ZP, TEM, FE&#8208;SEM, UV&#8208;vis, and BET. In addition, MTT assays were carried out on the HEK&#8208;293 and HeLa cell lines to investigate cytotoxicity. Cellular apoptosis analysis was performed to investigate the cell death mechanisms. Grand Canonical Monte Carlo simulations were conducted to analyze the interactions between MOFs and QU. Moreover, the stability of MOFs was also investigated during and after the drug release process. Ultimately, kinetic models of drug release were evaluated.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Induced C&#8722;H Methylation Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, we present a concise overview of recent breakthroughs in photochemical C&#8722;H methylation. These advancements encompass a variety of methodologies, including transition metal&#8208;based photocatalysis, organophotocatalysis, and various metal&#8208;free approaches, such as electron donor&#8208;acceptor &#8208;enabled processes.







Abstract
Direct C&#8722;H methylation is a highly valuable approach for introducing methyl groups into organic molecules, particularly in pharmaceutical chemistry. Among the various methodologies available, photo&#8208;induced methylation stands out as an exceptional choice due to its mild reaction conditions, energy efficiency, and compatibility with functional groups. This article offers a comprehensive review of photochemical strategies employed for the direct and selective methylation of C(sp3)&#8722;H, C(sp2)&#8722;H, and C(sp)&#8722;H bonds in various organic molecules. The discussed methodologies encompass transition&#8208;metal&#8208;based photocatalysis, organophotocatalysis, as well as other metal&#8208;free approaches, including electron donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA)&#8208;enabled transformations. Importantly, a wide range of easily accessible agents such as tert&#8208;butyl peroxide, methanol, DMSO, methyl tert&#8208;butyl ether, TsOMe, N&#8208;(acetoxy)phthalimide, acetic acid, methyl halides, and even methane can serve as effective methylating reagents for modifying diverse targets. These advancements in photochemical C&#8722;H methylation are anticipated to drive further progress in the fields of organic synthesis, photocatalysis, and pharmaceutical development, opening up exciting avenues for creating novel organic molecules and discovering new drug compounds.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Covalent Organic Frameworks for the Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8208;free COFs: Catalytic skeletons, linkages and edges have been employed to construct metal&#8208;free covalent organic frameworks for the oxygen reduction reaction. By tuning the COFs&#8217; electronic states, the corresponding catalytic properties can be precisely modulated, which provides new insight into designing such electrocatalysts at the molecular&#8208;level.







Abstract
The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is the key reaction in metal air and fuel cells. Among the catalysts that promote ORR, carbon&#8208;based metal&#8208;free catalysts are getting more attention because of their maximum atom utilization, effective active sites and satisfactory catalytic activity and stability. However, the pyrolysis synthesis of these carbons resulted in disordered porosities and uncontrolled catalytic sites, which hindered us in realizing the catalysts&#8217; design, the optimization of catalyst performance and the elucidation of structure&#8211;property relationship at the molecular level. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) constructed with designable building blocks have been employed as metal&#8208;free electrocatalysts for the ORR due to their controlled skeletons, tailored pores size and environments, as well as well&#8208;defined location and kinds of catalytic sites. In this Concept article, the development of metal&#8208;free COFs for the ORR is summarized, and different strategies including skeletons regulation, linkages engineering and edge&#8208;sites modulation to improve the catalytic selectivity and activity are discussed. Furthermore, this Concept provides prospectives for designing and constructing powerful electrocatalysts based on the catalytic COFs.

By tuning the COFs&#8217; electronic states, the corresponding catalytic properties can be precisely modulated, which provides new insight into designing such electrocatalysts at the molecular-level.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is the key reaction in metal air and fuel cells. Among the catalysts that promote ORR, carbon-based metal-free catalysts are getting more attention because of their maximum atom utilization, effective active sites and satisfactory catalytic activity and stability. However, the pyrolysis synthesis of these carbons resulted in disordered porosities and uncontrolled catalytic sites, which hindered us in realizing the catalysts&#8217; design, the optimization of catalyst performance and the elucidation of structure&#8211;property relationship at the molecular level. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) constructed with designable building blocks have been employed as metal-free electrocatalysts for the ORR due to their controlled skeletons, tailored pores size and environments, as well as well-defined location and kinds of catalytic sites. In this Concept article, the development of metal-free COFs for the ORR is summarized, and different strategies including skeletons regulation, linkages engineering and edge-sites modulation to improve the catalytic selectivity and activity are discussed. Furthermore, this Concept provides prospectives for designing and constructing powerful electrocatalysts based on the catalytic COFs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mechanochemical Oxidative Coupling of Amine to Azo&#8208;based Polymers by Hypervalent Iodine Oxidant</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthetic strategy of azo&#8208;based polymers is tedious and limited to liquid&#8208;phase synthesis. In most cases, the explosion is inevitable when hypervalent iodine in direct contacts with primary amines, which further restricts the solid&#8208;state synthesis. Inspired by the principle of &#8220;rule of six&#8221;, it is feasible to construct azo&#8208;based polymers by hypervalent iodine oxidant in ball milling process.







Abstract
Among porous organic polymers (POPs), azo&#8208;linked POPs represent a crucial class of materials, making them the focus of numerous catalytic systems proposed for their synthesis. However, the synthetic process is limited to metal&#8208;catalyzed, high&#8208;temperature, and liquid&#8208;phase reactions. In this study, we employ mechanochemical oxidative metal&#8208;free systems to encompass various syntheses of azo&#8208;based polymers. Drawing inspiration from the &#8220;rule of six&#8221; principle (six or more carbons on an azide group render the organic compound relatively safe), an azo compound featuring significant steric hindrance is obtained using the hypervalent iodine oxidation strategy. Furthermore, during the polymerization process, steric hindrance is enhanced in monomers to effectively prevent explosions resulting from direct contact between hypervalent iodine oxidants and primary amines. Indeed, this approach provides a facile and innovative solid&#8208;phase synthesis method for synthesizing azo&#8208;based materials.

         <title>Conformational Studies of &#946;&#8208;Azapeptoid Foldamers: A New Class of Peptidomimetics with Confined Dihedrals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Controlling amide bond geometries and the secondary structures of &#946;&#8208;peptoids is a challenging task as they contain several rotatable single bonds in their backbone. Herein, we describe the synthesis and conformational properties of novel &#8220;&#946;&#8208;azapeptoids&#8221; with confined dihedrals. We discuss how the acylhydrazide sidechains in these molecules enforce trans amide geometries (&#969; ~ 180&#8304;) via steric and stereoelectronic effects. We also show that the &#920;(C&#945;&#8208;C&#946;) and &#936;(OC&#8208;C&#945;) backbone torsions of &#946;&#8208;azapeptoids occupy a narrow range (170&#8208;180&#8304;) that can be rationalized by the staggered conformational preference of the backbone methylene carbons and a novel backbone nO &#8594; &#963;*C&#946;&#8208;N interaction discovered in this study. However, the &#966; (C&#946;&#8208;N) torsion remains freely rotatable and, depending on &#966;, the sidechains can be parallel, perpendicular, and anti&#8208;parallel relative to each other. In fact, we observed parallel and perpendicular relative orientations of sidechains in the crystal geometries of &#946;&#8208;azapeptoid dimers. We show that &#966; of &#946;&#8208;azapeptoids can be controlled by incorporating a bulky substituent at the backbone &#946;&#8208;carbon, which could provide complete control over all the backbone dihedrals. Finally, we show that the &#966; and &#936; dihedrals of &#946;&#8208;azapeptoids resemble that of a PPII helix and they retain&#160;PPII structure when incorporated in Host&#8208;Guest proline peptides.</dc:description>

         <title>Unveiling the Potential of Heterogeneous Catalysts for Molecular Solar Thermal Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solar energy utilization has gained considerable attention due to its abundance and renewability. However, its intermittent nature presents a challenge in harnessing its full potential. The development of energy storing compounds capable of capturing and releasing solar energy on demand has emerged as a potential solution. These compounds undergo a photochemical transformation that results in a high&#8208;energy metastable photoisomer, which stores solar energy in the form of chemical bonds and can release it as heat when required. Such systems are referred to as MOlecular Solar Thermal (MOST)&#8208;systems. Although the photoisomerization of MOST systems has been vastly studied, its back&#8208;conversion, particularly using heterogeneous catalysts, is still underexplored and the development of effective catalysts for releasing stored energy is crucial. Herein we compare the performance of 27 heterogeneous catalysts releasing the stored energy in an efficient Norbornadiene/Quadricyclane (NBD/QC) MOST system. We report the first benchmarking of heterogeneous catalysts for a MOST system using a robust comparison method of the catalysts&#8217; activity and monitoring the conversion using UV&#8208;Visible (UV&#8208;Vis) spectroscopy. Our findings provide insights into the development of effective catalysts for MOST systems. We anticipate that our assay will reveal the necessity of further investigation on heterogeneous catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Thermochromic Hydrogels with Opaque&#8208;Transparent Gradient Transition for Switchable Window and Temperature Monitor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogels with gradient opaque&#8208;transparent transition thermochromic temperature from 5&#8201;&#176;C to 53&#8201;&#176;C were prepared and the accuracy was controlled at 1&#8201;&#176;C. The thermochromic property was regulated by the aggregation state of sodium dodecyl sulfate micelles by adding potassium tartrate hemihydrate and cations. The thermochromic hydrogel can serve for smart window and temperature detector/monitor.







Abstract
In recent years, the thermochromic hydrogel was acted as suitable sandwiching material to adjust light transmission. However, to accurately control the thermochromic temperature in a wide range still was a significant challenge. Here, a simple method was explored to prepare hydrogels with gradient opaque&#8208;transparent transition thermochromic temperature from 5&#8201;&#176;C to 53&#8201;&#176;C, which was regulated by the aggregation state of sodium dodecyl sulfate micelles by adding potassium tartrate hemihydrate and cations. Using Li+, Na+, and K+ as cations, the accuracy was controlled at 1&#8201;&#176;C. Moreover, the transmittance of the hydrogel was not changed when the thermochromic temperature was adjusted. As a result, an intelligent window was fabricated by utilizing thermochromic hydrogel as a sandwiching layer into the outer glass layers, which could effectively and stably regulate the visible and infrared light. The temperature monitors/detectors were also designed, which showed excellent temperature monitoring/detecting ability. Therefore, this low&#8208;cost, high&#8208;efficient, large&#8208;scale prepared thermochromic hydrogel provided more potential for intelligent temperature devices.

         <title>Optimization of 3D Synthetic Scaffolds for Neuronal Tissue Engineering Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The increasing prevalence of neurodegenerative diseases has prompted researchers to develop advanced three&#8208;dimensional models that accurately mimic neuronal tissues. In this regard, the synthesis of an acrylamide&#8208;based hydrogel incorporating the peptide sequence arginine&#8208;glycine&#8208;aspartic acid has been carried out, examined in depth the matrix properties that govern cell behavior.







Abstract
The increasing prevalence of neurodegenerative diseases has spurred researchers to develop advanced 3D models that accurately mimic neural tissues. Hydrogels stand out as ideal candidates as their properties closely resemble those of the extracellular matrix. A critical challenge in this regard is to comprehend the influence of the scaffold&#8216;s mechanical properties on cell growth and differentiation, thus enabling targeted modifications. In light of this, a synthesis and comprehensive analysis of acrylamide&#8208;based hydrogels incorporating a peptide has been conducted. Adequate cell adhesion and development is achieved due to their bioactive nature and specific interactions with cellular receptors. The integration of a precisely controlled physicochemical hydrogel matrix and inclusion of the arginine&#8208;glycine&#8208;aspartic acid peptide sequence has endowed this system with an optimal structure, thus providing a unique ability to interact effectively with biomolecules. The analysis fully examined essential properties governing cell behavior, including pore size, mechanical characteristics, and swelling ability. Cell&#8208;viability experiments were performed to assess the hydrogel's biocompatibility, while the incorporation of grow factors aimed to promote the differentiation of neuroblastoma cells. The results underscore the hydrogel's ability to stimulate cell viability and differentiation in the presence of the peptide within the matrix.

         <title>Synthesis of Bridged Tetrazoles with Promising Properties and Potential Applications by a One&#8208;Step Finkelstein Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Several new nitramine&#8208; and oxa&#8208;bridged bis&#8208;tetrazolyl energetic materials were synthesized and fully characterized. The thermal behavior of all compounds was studied and their sensitivities towards impact (IS) and friction (FS) determined. Energetic properties, were calculated using the EXPLO5 (V6.06.01) computer code. In particular, 1,3&#8208;bis&#8208;2,2&#8217;&#8208;nitrotetrazolylnitrazapropane and 1,7&#8208;bis&#8208;2,2&#8217;&#8208;tetrazolyltrinitrazaheptane show promising properties for use as RDX replacements.







Abstract
Numerous nitramine bridged compounds which show promising combinations of properties have already been identified in the area of energetic materials. In this work, four new nitrazapropane bridged tetrazoles, as well as four new trinitrazaheptane tetrazoles and three oxapropane bridged tetrazoles were synthesized and fully characterized. These new compounds can all be synthesized by a simple, one&#8208;step synthesis using Finkelstein conditions. All of these new energetic materials were characterized using NMR spectroscopy, single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, vibrational analysis and elemental analysis. The thermal behaviour of these compounds was studied by differential thermal analysis (DTA) and partly by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The BAM standard method was used to determine the sensitivities towards impact (IS) and friction (FS). The enthalpies of formation were calculated at the CBS&#8208;4M level, and the energetic performances were calculated using the EXPLO5 (V6.06.01) computer code. The properties of the new compounds were compared to each other as well as to the known energetic material RDX. Moreover, the iron(II) and copper(II) perchlorate complexes with 1,3&#8208;bis&#8208;1,1&#8208;tetrazolylnitrazapropane as ligand were prepared and investigated.

         <title>Mechanochemical Scholl Reaction on Phenylated Cyclopentadiene Core: One&#8208;Step Synthesis of Fluoreno[5]helicenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluoreno[5]helicenes are prepared in the solid state in one synthetic step from commercially available phenylated cyclopentadiene precursors in high isolated yields using a ball milling mechanochemical technique.







Abstract
In this study, we explore feasibility of the mechanochemical approach in the synthesis of tetrabenzofluorenes (fluoreno[5]helicenes). For this, commercially available phenylated cyclopentadiene precursors are subjected to the Scholl reaction in the solid state using FeCl3 as an oxidant and sodium chloride as the solid reaction medium. This ball milling process gave access to the 5&#8208;membered ring containing&#8208;helicenes in one synthetic step in high (95&#8211;96&#8201;%) isolated yields. The solution&#8208;phase reactions, however, were found to be moderate to low yielding in this regard (10&#8211;40&#8201;%).

         <title>Molecular Accessibility and Diffusion of Resorufin in Zeolite Crystals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Resorufin has been investigated as a fluorescent probe for 3D microimaging in microporous materials. Understanding the processes, such as aggregation, that affect the measured fluorescence intensity enables the probe to be used to measure real&#8208;time diffusion, microporosity, and accessibility in zeolite&#8208;&#946; crystals.







Abstract
We have used confocal laser scanning microscopy on the small, fluorescent resorufin dye molecule to visualize molecular accessibility and diffusion in the hierarchical, anisotropic pore structure of large (~10&#8197;&#956;m&#8208;sized) zeolite&#8208;&#946; crystals. The resorufin dye is widely used in life and materials science, but only in its deprotonated form because the protonated molecule is barely fluorescent in aqueous solution. In this work, we show that protonated resorufin is in fact strongly fluorescent when confined within zeolite micropores, thus enabling fluorescence microimaging experiments. We find that J&#8208;aggregation guest&#8211;guest interactions lead to a decrease in the measured fluorescence intensity that can be prevented by using non&#8208;fluorescent spacer molecules. We characterized the pore space by introducing resorufin from the outside solution and following its diffusion into zeolite&#8208;&#946; crystals. The eventual homogeneous distribution of resorufin molecules throughout the zeolite indicates a fully accessible pore network. This enables the quantification of the diffusion coefficient in the straight pores of zeolite&#8208;&#946; without the need for complex analysis, and we found a value of 3&#215;10&#8722;15&#8197;m2&#8197;s&#8722;1. Furthermore, we saw that diffusion through the straight pores of zeolite&#8208;&#946; is impeded when crossing the boundaries between zeolite subunits.

         <dc:description>The Hauser&#8208;Kraus (H&#8208;K) annulation of N&#8208;unsubstituted 3&#8208;olefinic oxindoles with 3&#8208;nucleophilic phthalides triggers a cascade of ring expansion and ring contraction reactions through several regioselective steps in one pot. While oxazepines were isolated in the presence of stoichiometric amounts of base at room temperature, carbazoles and phenanthridinediones were the products in the presence of excess base and microwave irradiation. Mechanistic studies guided by stepwise reactions and control experiments revealed that the isolable oxazepine intermediate, formed via ring expansion of the H&#8208;K adduct, is the key precursor to carbazole and phenanthridinedione via decarboxylative regioselective cyclizations.</dc:description>

         <title>Coordination Engineering of Heteronuclear Fe&#8208;Mo Dual&#8208;Atom Catalyst for Promoted Electrocatalytic Nitrogen Fixation: A DFT Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing efficient nanostructured electrocatalysts for N2 reduction to NH3 under mild conditions remains a major challenge. The Fe&#8208;Mo cofactor serves as the archetypal active site in nitrogenase. Inspired by nitrogenase, we designed a series of heteronuclear dual&#8208;atom catalysts (DACs) labeled as FeMoN6&#8208;aXa (a =1, 2, 3; X = B, C, O, S) anchored on the pore of g&#8208;C3N4 to probe the impact of coordination on FeMo&#8208;catalyzed nitrogen fixation. The stability, reaction paths, activity, and selectivity of 12 different FeMoN6&#8208;aXaDACs have been systematically studied using density functional theory. Of these, four DACs (FeMoN5B1, FeMoN5O1, FeMoN4O2, and FeMoN3C3) displayed promising nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) performance. Notably, FeMoN5O1 stands out with an ultralow limiting potential of &#8722;0.11 V and high selectivity. Analysis of the density of states and charge/spin changes shows FeMoN5O1's high activity arises from optimal N2 binding on Fe initially and synergy of the FeMo dimer enabling protonation in NRR. This work contributes to the advancement of rational design for efficient NRR catalysts by regulating atomic coordination environments.</dc:description>

         <title>Are &#8216;carbon dots&#8217; always carbon dots? Evidence for their supramolecular nature from structural and dynamic studies in solution and in the pure solid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A model for the morphology (size, shape, and crystallinity) of carbon dots (CDs) in solid state consistent with the observed photoluminescence in solution is herein proposed. Overwhelming evidence has been collected which links the data coming from solid state analysis (high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and matrix&#8208;assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry (MS)) to that of solution (pulsed field gradient (PFG)&#8208;nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, time&#8208;resolved fluorescence anisotropy (TRFA), and steady&#8208;state/time&#8208;resolved fluorescence), allowing the establishment of an overall structural model for CDs. According to this model, the so&#8208;called carbon dots, observed under HRTEM imaging, are in fact supramolecular organized structures dynamically assembled from small to medium size molecular species when removing the solvent to obtain the solid form. In this way, the imaged nanoparticles (TEM/AFM) are not covalently bound entities formed during the synthetic process, but instead supramolecular entities formed by noncovalent interactions. These particles, if at all present in solution, have the form of loose associations of relatively small molecules. The present study was conducted on CDs obtained from the hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) of a biomass waste (olive wet pomace).</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Waixenicin A: Exploring Strategies for Nine&#8208;Membered Ring Formation&#8203;</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present a comprehensive account on our efforts behind the recently published synthesis of waixenicin A. Our approach for constructing the dihydropyran ring relied on an Achmatowicz rearrangement. For the assembly of the nine&#8208;membered ring four distinct strategies were investigated. Our initial attempts using radical&#8208;based addition/fragmentation reactions targeting the C7&#8208;C11 bond proved unsuitable for accessing the 6/9&#8208;bicycle. By employing anionic fragmentation conditions at the furfuryl alcohol stage, we successfully reached a 5/9&#8208;bicycle. However, subsequent ring&#8208;expansion was unsuccessful. Alternative approaches, such as Nozaki&#8211;Hiyama&#8211;Kishi or Heck reactions to connect the C6&#8208;C7 bond, also encountered difficulties, with no nine&#8208;membered ring formation observed. Our first breakthrough came from our attempts to install the C5&#8208;C6 bond via an intramolecular alkylation. Surprisingly, subsequent functional group modifications proved unexpectedly challenging, necessitating a redesign of our synthetic route. Drawing from all our investigations, we concluded that construction of the C9&#8208;C10 bond would enable efficient nine&#8208;membered ring alkylation and would facilitate the installation of the desired substitution pattern along the southern periphery. Exploration of this strategy yielded further surprises but ultimately led to the successful synthesis of waixenicin A and 9&#8208;deacetoxy&#8208;14,15&#8208;deepoxyxeniculin. For the latter compound, a bioinspired one&#8208;step rearrangement to xeniafauranol A was achieved.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanistic insights into amphoteric reactivity of an iron&#8208;bispidine complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reactivity of FeIII&#8208;alkylperoxido complexes has remained a riddle to inorganic chemists owing to their thermal instability and impotency towards organic substrates. These iron&#8208;oxygen adducts have been known as sluggish oxidants towards oxidative electrophilic and nucleophilic reactions. Herein, we report the synthesis and spectroscopic characterization of a relatively stable mononuclear high&#8208;spin FeIII&#8208;alkylperoxido complex supported by an engineered bispidine framework. Against the notion, this FeIII&#8208;alkylperoxido complex serves as a rare example of versatile reactivity in both electrophilic and nucleophilic reactions. Detailed mechanistic studies and computational calculations reveal a novel reaction mechanism, where a putative superoxido intermediate orchestrates the amphoteric property of the oxidant. The design of the backbone is pivotal to convey stability and reactivity to alkylperoxido and superoxido intermediates. Contrary to the well&#8208;known O&#8208;O bond cleavage that generates an iron(IV)&#8208;oxido species, the iron(III)&#8208;alkylperoxido complex reported here undergoes O&#8208;C bond scission to generate a superoxido moiety that is responsible for the amphiphilic reactivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Calamitic Liquid Crystals for Reversible Light&#8208;modulated Phase Regulation based on Arylazopyrazole Photoswitches</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The design of responsive liquid crystals enables a diversity of technological applications. Especially photochromic liquid crystals gained a lot of interest in recent years due to the excellent spatiotemporal control of their phase transitions. In this work we present calamitic light responsive mesogens based on a library of arylazopyrazole photoswitches.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The design of responsive liquid crystals enables a diversity of technological applications. Especially photochromic liquid crystals gained a lot of interest in recent years due to the excellent spatiotemporal control of their phase transitions. In this work we present calamitic light responsive mesogens based on a library of arylazopyrazole photoswitches. These compounds show liquid-crystalline behavior as shown by differential scanning calorimetry, grazing incidence X-ray diffraction and polarized optical microscopy. UV-vis spectroscopy and NMR analysis confirmed the excellent photophysical properties in solution and thin film. Additionally, polarized optical microscopy studies of the pristine compounds show reversible phase transition upon irradiation with light. Moreover, as a dopant in the commercially available liquid crystal 4-cyano-4'-pentylbiphenyl (5CB), the temperature range was reduced to ambient temperatures while preserving the excellent photophysical properties. Remarkably this co-assembled system shows reversible liquid-crystalline to isotropic phase transition upon irradiation with light of different wavelengths. The spatiotemporal control of the phase transition of the liquid crystals offers opportunities in the development of optical devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>This report describes a one&#8208;pot multi&#8208;step procedure to obtain double azahelicenes via nucleophilic fluorine substitution of 2,2&#8208;di(2&#8208;bromophenyl)&#8208;1,1&#8208;difluoroalkenes and palladium&#8208;catalysed ring closing reaction. The developed synthesis approach allows easy diversification of substituents at all four fragments of the obtained X&#8208;shaped aza[4,6]helicene entity.

         <title>Supramolecular Organic Ferroelectric Materials from Donor&#8208;Acceptor Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Amongst different class of organic systems, donor(D)&#8208;acceptor(A) charge&#8208;transfer (CT)&#8208; complexes were recognized promising for ferroelectricity owing to their neutral&#8208;to&#8208;ionic phase transition at low temperature. This review presents an overview of different supramolecular D&#8208;A systems, explored for ferroelectric (FE) phase transitions. Discussion begins with a general introduction of ferroelectricity and different associated parameters. Then it moves on to show early examples of CT&#8208;cocrystals that showed FE properties in sub&#8208;ambient temperature. Subsequently, recent development in the field on room temperature (rt) ferroelectricity, exhibited by H&#8208;bond stabilized lock&#8208;arm supramolecular&#8208;ordering (LASO) in D&#8208;A co&#8208;crystals or other FE CT&#8208;crystals devoid of neutral&#8208;ionic phase transition are discussed. Then the discussion moves on to emerging reports on other D&#8208;A soft&#8208;materials such as gel and foldable polymers and finally it shows very recent development on ferroelectricity in supramolecular assemblies of single&#8208;component dipolar or ambipolar &#960;&#8208;systems, exhibiting intra&#8208;molecular charge transfer. Effect of structural nuances such as H&#8208;bonding, balanced charge&#8208;transfer and chirality on the observed ferroelectricity is described with available examples. Finally, piezoelectricity in recently reported ambipolar ADA&#8208; type systems are discussed to highlight the future potential of these soft materials in micropower energy harvesting.</dc:description>

         <title>Optical Cavity Design and Functionality for Molecular Strong Coupling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Optical cavity/molecule strong coupling offers attractive opportunities to modulate photochemical or photophysical processes. When atoms or molecules are placed in an optical cavity, they can coherently exchange photonic energy with optical cavity vacuum fields, entering the strong coupling interaction regime. Recent work suggests that the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of molecules can be significantly changed by strong coupling, resulting in the emergence of intriguing photochemical and photophysical phenomena. As more and more physico&#8208;chemical systems are studied under strong coupling conditions, optical cavities have also advanced in their sophistication, responsiveness, and (multi)functionality. In this review, we highlight some of these recent developments, particularly focusing on Fabry&#8208;Perot microcavities.</dc:description>

         <title>Carbon Nitrides from Supramolecular Crystals: From Single Atoms to Heterojunctions and Advanced Photoelectrodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 62, November 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular single crystals based on C&#8722;N monomers are used to prepared carbon nitride materials with tailored morphology and porosity, single atom catalysts or heterojunctions. This approach can be applied to fabricate efficient water splitting photoelectrodes.







Abstract
Carbon nitride materials (CN) have become one of the most studied photocatalysts within the last 15&#8197;years. While CN absorbs visible light, its low porosity and fast electron&#8208;hole recombination hinder its photoelectric performance and have motivated the research in the modification of its physical and chemical properties (such as energy band structure, porosity, or chemical composition) by different means. In this Concept we review the utilization of supramolecular crystals as CN precursors to tailor its properties. We elaborate on the features needed in a supramolecular crystal to serve as CN precursor, we delve on the influence of metal&#8208;free crystals in the morphology and porosity of the resulting materials and then discuss the formation of single atoms and heterojunctions when employing a metal&#8208;organic crystal. We finally discuss the performance of CN photoanodes derived from crystals and highlight the current standing challenges in the field.

         <title>Photoisomerisation of Exo&#8208;Imine Complexes and the Role of MECP in the Reverse Thermal Equilibrium: An Experimental and DFT Computational Investigation
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 62, November 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exo&#8208;imine complexes have been synthesised and shown to behave as molecular switches. Irradiation with visible light converts the more stable to the less stable form (usually trans to cis). The reverse process is thermally activated. DFT calculations show the important role of a minimum energy crossing point (MECP) in the thermal isomerisation.







Abstract
Complexes [MCl2Cp*]2 (M=Ir, Rh), [RuCl2(p&#8208;cymene)]2 and [Ir(C^N)2Cl]2 (HC^N=a, phenylpyridine ; b, phenylpyrazole,) react with imine ligands derived from &#959;&#8208;aminophenol to yield complexes with an exocyclic C=N bond which has a cis or trans configuration. The trans isomer is favoured except for sterically crowded complexes Cp*M (M=Ir, Rh) when the imine has a mesityl substituent, for which the cis isomer is favoured. The complexes undergo photoisomerisation in visible light but revert back to the original isomer over time or when heated. The rate of the thermal reverse isomerisation depends on the imine substituent and the metal fragment. DFT calculations correctly reproduce the favoured isomer and suggest that the reverse isomerisation occurs by a rehybridisation at the N atom as found in organic imines. In addition, a triplet state, thermally accessible by a Minimum Energy Crossing Point (MECP) provides a low energy pathway for reverse isomerisation in the case of the half&#8208;sandwich complexes.

         <title>Antibactericidal Ir(III) and Ru(II) Complexes with Phosphine&#8208;Alkaloid Conjugate and Their Interactions with Biomolecules: A Case of N&#8208;Methylphenethylamine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 62, November 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The phosphine derived from natural alkaloid N&#8208;methylphenethylamine was used to synthesize half&#8208;sandwich iridium(III) and ruthenium(II) complexes. It turned out that they are selective towards Gram&#8208;positive bacteria, whereas the Ir(III) complex was more bactericidal. The potential action mode was proposed, based on the interactions with various biomolecules (ctDNA, plasmid DNA, 9&#8208;ethylguanine, and 9&#8208;methyladenine, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, glutathione, and ascorbic acid).







Abstract
The phosphine ligand (Ph2PCH2N(CH3)(CH2)2Ph, PNMPEA) obtained by the reaction of the (hydroxymethyl)diphenylphosphine with naturally occurring alkaloid N&#8208;methylphenethylamine, was used to synthesize the half&#8208;sandwich iridium(III) (Ir(&#951;5&#8208;Cp*)Cl2Ph2PCH2N(CH3)(CH2)2Ph, IrPNMPEA) and ruthenium(II) (Ru(&#951;6&#8208;p&#8208;cymene)Cl2Ph2PCH2N(CH3)(CH2)2Ph, RuPNMPEA) complexes. They were characterized using a vast array of methods, including 1D and 2D NMR, ESI(+)MS spectrometry, elemental analysis, cyclic voltammetry (CV), electron spectroscopy in the UV&#8208;Vis range (absorption, fluorescence) and density functional theory (DFT). The initial antimicrobial activity in&#8197;vitro toward Gram&#8208;positive and Gram&#8208;negative bacterial strains was examined, indicating that both complexes are selective towards Gram&#8208;positive bacteria, e.&#8201;g., Staphylococcus aureus, where the IrPNMPEA has been more bactericidal compared to RuPNMPEA. Additionally, the interactions of these compounds with various biomolecules, such as DNA (ctDNA, plasmid DNA, 9&#8208;ethylguanine (9&#8208;EtG), and 9&#8208;methyladenine (9&#8208;MeA)), nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH), glutathione (GSH), and ascorbic acid (Asc) were described. The results showed that both Ir(III) and Ru(II) complexes accelerate the oxidation process of NADH, GSH and Asc that appeared to occur by an electron transfer mechanism. Interestingly, only IrPNMPEA leads to the formation of various biomolecule adducts, which can explain its higher activity. Furthermore, RuPNMPEA and IrPNMPEA have been interacting with the DNA through weak noncovalent interactions.

         <title>Amino&#8208;Acid&#8208;Assisted Synthesis of Hollow Hierarchical FER Zeolite with Improved Catalytic Performance</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 62, November 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hollow hierarchical FER zeolite is synthesized through an amino&#8208;acid&#8208;assisted approach without the use of mesoporogens, and exhibits improved catalytic performance in the skeletal isomerization of 1&#8208;butene to isobutene.







Abstract
Hierarchical zeolites are highly&#8208;desired catalysts in the petrochemical industry due to their shorter diffusion length, faster diffusion rate, and better accessibility to active acid sites compared with conventional zeolites. Herein, we report a simple amino&#8208;acid&#8208;assisted method to synthesize urchin&#8208;like hollow hierarchical FER zeolites with abundant mesopores and macroporous inner cavities. An amino acid (i.&#8201;e. L&#8208;lysine) is used to facilitate the agglomeration of primary gel nanoparticles. The preferential nucleation and crystal growth at the external surfaces together with the lagged crystallization of the inner core of the agglomerates results in the formation of hollow inner cavities after the exhaustion of interior materials. Thanks to the unique hierarchical structure and more accessible acid sites, the hollow hierarchical FER zeolite exhibits improved catalytic performance over the conventional one in the skeletal isomerization of 1&#8208;butene to isobutene.

         <title>Development of Lysine Crotonyl&#8208;Mimic Probe to Covalently Identify H3K27Cr Interacting Proteins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 62, November 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The enhancement of cysteine reactivity of crotonylated lysine (Kcr) in thiol&#8208;Michael addition by replacing the amide bond with an ester bond is reported. The H3g27Cr probe identified the known H3K27Cr&#8208;binding protein HDAC1, as well as the unknown protein STAT3, as potential binders of H3K27Cr in a possibly complex manner. A specific crotonyl group aimed at identifying newer Kcr&#8208;binding interactomes is reported.







Abstract
Histone lysine crotonylation (Kcr) is one newly discovered acylation modification and regulates numerous pathophysiological processes. The binding affinity between Kcr and its interacting proteins is generally weak, which makes it difficult to effectively identify Kcr&#8208;interacting partners. Changing the amide of crotonyl to an ester increased reactivity with proximal cysteines and retained specificity for Kcr antibody. The probe &#8220;H3g27Cr&#8221; was designed by incorporating the ester functionality into a H3K27 peptide. Using this probe, multiple Kcr&#8208;interacting partners including STAT3 were successfully identified, and this has not been reported previously. Further experiments suggested that STAT3 possibly could form complexes with Histone deacetylase HDACs to downregulate the acetylation and crotonylation of Histone H3K27. Our unique design provided intriguing tools to further explore Kcr&#8208;interacting proteins and elucidate their working mechanisms.

         <title>Highly Scalable and Inherently Safer Preparation of Di, Tri and Tetra Nitrate Esters Using Continuous Flow Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 62, November 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient continuous flow O&#8208;nitration of aliphatic polyols was developed. Industrially important nitrate esters containing two, three and four nitro groups were synthesized. Examples include glycol dinitrates: 1,2&#8208;propanediol dinitrate (PGDN), ethylene glycol dinitrate (EGDN), diethylene glycol dinitrate (DEGDN), triethylene glycol dinitrate (TEGDN); trinitrates: trimethylolethane trinitrate (TMETN), 1,2,4&#8208;butanetriol trinitrate (BTTN); and tetranitrates: erythritol tetranitrate (ETN). The optimized process for each molecule provided yield &gt;90&#8201;% in a short residence time of 1&#8197;min corresponding to a space time yield of &gt;18&#8197;g/h/mL reactor volume.







Abstract
Nitrate esters are important organic compounds having wide application in energetic materials, medicines and fuel additives. They are synthesized through nitration of aliphatic polyols. But the process safety challenges associated with nitration reaction makes the production process complicated and economically unviable. Herein, we have developed a continuous flow process wherein polyol and nitric acid are reacted in a microreactor to produce nitrate ester continuously. Our developed process is inherently safer and efficient. The process was optimized for industrially important nitrate esters containing two, three and four nitro groups. Substrates include glycol dinitrates: 1,2&#8208;propylene glycol dinitrate (PGDN), ethylene glycol dinitrate (EGDN), diethylene glycol dinitrate (DEGDN), triethylene glycol dinitrate (TEGDN); trinitrates: trimethylolethane trinitrate (TMETN), 1,2,4&#8208;butanetriol trinitrate (BTTN); and tetranitrates: erythritol tetranitrate (ETN). The optimized process for each molecule provided yield &gt;90&#8201;% in a short residence time of 1&#8197;min corresponding to a space time yield of &gt;18&#8197;g/h/mL of reactor volume.

         <title>Chiral Dual Core Chromophores Based on Binaphthyl Acrylonitrile Motif with Tunable Dual Emission Bands and Anti&#8208;counterfeiting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 62, November 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The prepared chiral dual core chromophores based on binaphthyl acrylonitrile were shown to have the excellent dual state emissions and tunable dual wavelength emissions. A range of colors could be observed by solvatochromic and mechanochromic effects, and the anti&#8208;counterfeiting application with small color migration was also achieved.







Abstract
Small organic molecules which can emit fluorescence with tunable dual emission bands are significant for fundamental research and broad applications. In this work, two binaphthyl based arylacrylonitrile derivatives with pyrene and triphenylamine unit (BiNp&#8208;Py and BiNp&#8208;TPA) were designed and synthesized, respectively, featuring chiral backbone and dual AIE&#8208;active cyanostyrene&#8208;linked chromophores. Excellent fluorescence emissions in a range of solution and solid states were observed with high quantum yields, indicative of the solvatochromism and mechanochromism. More interestingly, dual emission bands were found and tunable by the water fraction in THF, and speculatively attributed to the balancing of intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) and locally excited (LE) emission in solution and aggregate states. Furthermore, the potential application in anti&#8208;counterfeiting ink was also explored, indicating the very low concentration (5&#8197;ppm) for sufficient distinguishable vision and small colour migration (28&#8197;nm) for printing on the filter. The present work provides a new strategy to design organic luminescent structure having widely fluorescent emissions in dual states and a valuable reference for the study of chiral optical materials.

         <title>Structural Variations in Carboxylated Bispidine Ligands: Influence of Positional Isomerism and Rigidity on the Conformation, Stability, Inertness and Relaxivity of their Mn2+ Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 62, November 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mn(II) complexes with acetate&#8208;substituted bispidine ligands can adopt different conformations depending on the N3 substituent. Complexes in chair&#8208;chair conformation display high relaxivity and strong kinetic inertness, both very important for their potential use as MRI contrast agents. In contrast, the boat&#8208;chair conformers undergo fast dissociation and do no retain good relaxivity.







Abstract
Mn2+ complexes of 2,4&#8208;pyridyl&#8208;disubstituted bispidine ligands have emerged as more biocompatible alternatives to Gd3+&#8208;based MRI probes. They display relaxivities comparable to that of commercial contrast agents and high kinetic inertness, unprecedented for Mn2+ complexes. The chemical structure, in particular the substituents on the two macrocyclic nitrogens N3 and N7, are decisive for the conformation of the Mn2+ complexes, and this will in turn determine their thermodynamic, kinetic and relaxation properties. We describe the synthesis of four ligands with acetate substituents in positions N3, N7 or both. We evidence that the bispidine conformation is dependent on N3 substitution, with direct impact on the thermodynamic stability, kinetic inertness, hydration state and relaxivity of the Mn2+ complexes. These results unambiguously show that (i) solely a chair&#8208;chair conformation allows for favorable inertness and relaxivity, and (ii) in this family such chair&#8208;chair conformation is accessible only for ligands without N3&#8208;appended carboxylates.

         <title>A Unique Two&#8208;Dimensional Silver(II) Antiferromagnet Cu[Ag(SO4)2] and Perspectives for Its Further Modifications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 62, November 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
CuAg(SO4)2, a novel mixed&#8208;metal sulfate, shows a layered structure, with [Ag(SO4)2]2&#8722; sublattice (shown) hosting strong antiferromagnetic interactions. Calculations suggest that copper site could easily be changed for other small divalent cations, giving rise to a new family of two&#8208;dimensional magnetic materials.







Abstract
Copper(II) silver(II) sulfate crystallizes in a monoclinic CuSO4&#8208;related structure with P21/n symmetry. This quasi&#8208;ternary compound features Ag(SO4)22&#8722; layers, while the remaining cationic sites may be occupied either completely or partially by Cu2+ cations, corresponding to the formula of (CuxAg1&#8722;x)[Ag(SO4)2], x=0.6&#8722;1.0. CuAg(SO4)2 is antiferromagnetic with large negative Curie&#8208;Weiss temperature of &#8722;140&#8197;K and shows characteristic ordering phenomenon at 40.4&#8197;K. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the strongest superexchange interaction is a two&#8208;dimensional antiferromagnetic coupling within Ag(SO4)22&#8722; layers, with the superexchange constant J2D of &#8722;11.1&#8197;meV. This renders CuAg(SO4)2 the rare representative of layered Ag2+&#8208;based antiferromagnets. Magnetic coupling is facilitated by the strong mixing of Ag d(x2&#8722;y2) and O 2p states. Calculations show that M2+ sites in MAg(SO4)2 can be occupied with other similar cations such as Zn2+, Cd2+, Ni2+, Co2+, and Mg2+.

         <title>A 3D Covalent Organic Framework with In&#8208;situ Formed Pd Nanoparticles for Efficient Electrochemical Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 62, November 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An effective catalyst for oxygen reduction reaction was prepared by in&#8197;situ formation of palladium nanoparticle (Pd NPs) within a three&#8208;dimensional covalent organic framework (COF) and carbonization. Due to the homogeneous dispersion and uniform size of Pd NPs, the catalyst reached a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.906&#8197;V, providing a new idea for cathode catalysts of fuel cells and zinc&#8208;air batteries.







Abstract
Non&#8208;platinum noble metals are highly desirable for the development of highly active, stable oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalysts for fuel cells and metal&#8208;air batteries. However, how to improve the utilization of non&#8208;platinum noble metals is an urgent issue. Herein, a highly efficient catalyst for ORR was prepared through homogeneous loading of Pd precursors by a domain&#8208;limited method in a three&#8208;dimensional covalent organic framework (COF) followed by pyrolysis. The morphology of the Pd nanoparticles (Pd NPs) was well maintained after carbonization, which was attributed to the rigid structure of the 3D COF. Thanks to the uniform distribution of Pd NPs in the carbon, the catalyst exhibited a remarkable half&#8208;wave potential of 0.906&#8197;V and a Tafel slope of 70&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1 in 0.1&#8197;M KOH, surpassing the commercial Pt/C catalyst (0.863&#8197;V and 75&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1). Furthermore, a maximum power density of 144.0&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 was achieved at 252&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, which was significantly higher than the control battery (105.1&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2). This work not only provides a simple strategy for in&#8208;situ preparation of highly dispersible metal catalysts in COFs, but also offers new insights into the ORR electrocatalysis.

         <title>Anion&#8208;Dependent Hydrogen&#8208;Bond Polarity Switching in Ethylene&#8208;bridged Urea Oligomers</title>

The reversible coordination of various anions to a binding site at one terminus of a urea oligomer leads to a global switch in polarity of a linear chain of hydrogen&#8208;bonded ureas. The fluorescence response of a hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;responsive dithiomaleimide fluorophore at the opposite terminus reveals a relayed change in local hydrogen bonding directionality.







Abstract
The reversible coordination of anions to an N,N&#8217;&#8208;disubstituted 3,5&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)phenylurea located at a terminus of a linear chain of ethylene&#8208;bridged hydrogen&#8208;bonded ureas triggers a cascade of conformational changes. A series of hydrogen&#8208;bond polarity reversals propagates along the oligomer, leading to a global switch of its hydrogen&#8208;bond directionality. The induced polarity switch, transmitted through four reversible urea groups, results in a change in emission and excitation wavelengths of a fluorophore located at the opposite terminus of the oligomer. The molecule thus behaves as a chemical sensor with a relayed remote spectroscopic response to variations in anion concentration. The polarity switch induced by anion concentration constitutes an artificial communication mechanism for conveying information through oligomeric structures.

         <title>Exploring the Potential of Anthraquinone&#8208;Based Hybrids for Identifying a Novel Generation of Antagonists for the Smoothened Receptor in HH&#8208;Dependent Tumour</title>

A new design principle is provided for the preparation of a first and second generation of anthraquinone&#8208;based hybrids by combining the rhein scaffold with variously substituted piperazine nuclei structurally similar to the active portion of known inhibitors of SMO, the main transducer of the HH pathway.







Abstract
Natural products (NPs) are highly profitable pharmacological tools due to their chemical diversity and ability to modulate biological systems. Accessing new chemical entities while retaining the biological relevance of natural chemotypes is a fundamental goal in the design of novel bioactive compounds. Notably, NPs have played a crucial role in understanding Hedgehog (HH) signalling and its pharmacological modulation in anticancer therapy. However, HH antagonists developed so far have shown several limitations, thus growing interest in the design of second&#8208;generation HH inhibitors. Through smart manipulation of the NPs core&#8208;scaffold, unprecedented and intriguing architectures have been achieved following different design strategies. This study reports the rational design and synthesis of a first and second generation of anthraquinone&#8208;based hybrids by combining the rhein scaffold with variously substituted piperazine nuclei that are structurally similar to the active portion of known SMO antagonists, the main transducer of the HH pathway. A thorough functional and biological investigation identified RH2_2 and RH2_6 rhein&#8208;based hybrids as valuable candidates for HH inhibition through SMO antagonism, with the consequent suppression of HH&#8208;dependent tumour growth. These findings also corroborated the successful application of the NPs&#8208;based hybrid design strategy in the development of novel NP&#8208;based SMO antagonists.

         <title>Ring Strain Energy of Diheteropnictogeniranes El2Pn (Pn=N, P, As, Sb)&#8211; Accurate versus Additive Approaches</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 62, November 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Accurate ring strain energies (RSE) were computed for a wide set of (dielementa)pnictogeniranes (El2Pn). Together with other reported rings, an additive methodology was developed by least squares regression using either atom&#8208; or bond&#8208;strain parameters, achieving a very acceptable accuracy. Factors affecting RSE were analyzed, including aromaticity and its differentiation from atom&#8208;centred diatropic currents.







Abstract
Accurate ring strain energy (RSE) values for sixty&#8208;six parent pnictogeniranes having two other identical p&#8208;block elements, El2Pn, have been reported. A decrease in RSE was observed to correlate with an increase in the p character of the AO used in endocyclic bonds, which is particularly remarkable on descending the groups 15 and 16. The latter also parallels higher &#8208;NICS(1) values, which seems not to be related with an increase in aromaticity, as pointed out by other NICS&#8208;related criteria, but to atom&#8208;centred diatropic currents mostly arising from the presence of lone pairs. Only in case of pnictogenaditrieliranes Tr2Pn (Tr=B, Al, Ga), the decrease of &#8208;NICS(1) is related to a lower H&#252;ckel&#8208;type 2&#960;&#8208;electron aromaticity on descending group 13. The use of an additive methodology based on atom&#8208;strain contributions enables estimation of RSEs for a large majority of all possible three&#8208;membered rings containing group 13&#8211;16 elements with modest accuracy (RMSE=4.371&#8197;kcal/mol), that could be remarkably improved by using bond&#8208;strain contributions (RMSE=1.183&#8197;kcal/mol) instead.

A novel visible&#8208;light driven two&#8208;step one&#8208;pot multicomponent reactions of aliphatic amines and propiolate acid esters for preparation of &#946;&#8208;CF3 enamines has been reported.







Abstract
A novel one&#8208;pot two&#8208;step multicomponent reaction has been achieved for the preparation of &#946;&#8208;CF3 enamines by using different aliphatic amines, propiolates, and CF3SO2Na as starting material. In this protocol, various aliphatic amines including primary amines, cyclic or acyclic secondary amines were demonstrated to be good coupling partners, and different &#946;&#8208;CF3 enamines were obtained in moderate to good yields. Among them, the primary aliphatic amines only gave pure (E)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CF3 enamines as products. The synthetic utility of the MCRs strategy was further demonstrated by mild conditions, gram&#8208;scale synthesis and natural sunlight&#8208;induced protocol. Preliminary mechanistic studies suggest that this trifluoromethylation of C(sp2)&#8722;H involves radical process.

         <title>Multifunctional Roles of Clathrate Hydrate Nanoreactors for CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 62, November 8, 2023. </description>

Clathrate hydrates act hydrogen&#8208;bonded nanoreactors that possess multifunctional properties, facilitating CO2 reduction such as confinement, tethering, H&#8208;bond catalysis, and proton pumping.







Abstract
In this study, we explore a possible platform for the CO2 reduction (CO2R) in one of water's solid phases, namely clathrate hydrates (CHs), by ab initio molecular dynamics and well&#8208;tempered metadynamics simulations with periodic boundary conditions. We found that the stacked H2O nanocages in CHs help to initialize CO2R by increasing the electron&#8208;binding ability of CO2. The substantial CO2R processes are further influenced by the hydrogen bond networks in CHs. The first intermediate CO2&#8722; in this process can be stabilized through cage structure reorganization into the H&#8208;bonded [CO2&#8722;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#8722;OHcage] complex. Further cooperative structural dynamics enables the complex to convert into a vital transient [CO22&#8722;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#8722;OHcage] intermediate in a low&#8208;barrier disproportionation&#8208;like process. Such a highly reactive intermediate spontaneously triggers subsequent double proton transfer along its tethering H&#8208;bonds, finally converting it into HCOOH. These hydrogen&#8208;bonded nanoreactors feature multiple functions in facilitating CO2R such as confining, tethering, H&#8208;bond catalyzing and proton pumping. Our findings have a general interest and extend the knowledge of CO2R into porous aqueous systems.

&lt;p&gt;In this study, we explore a possible platform for the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R) in one of water's solid phases, namely clathrate hydrates (CHs), by ab initio molecular dynamics and well-tempered metadynamics simulations with periodic boundary conditions. We found that the stacked H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O nanocages in CHs help to initialize CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R by increasing the electron-binding ability of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The substantial CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R processes are further influenced by the hydrogen bond networks in CHs. The first intermediate CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; in this process can be stabilized through cage structure reorganization into the H-bonded [CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#8722;OH&lt;sub&gt;cage&lt;/sub&gt;] complex. Further cooperative structural dynamics enables the complex to convert into a vital transient [CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#8722;OH&lt;sub&gt;cage&lt;/sub&gt;] intermediate in a low-barrier disproportionation-like process. Such a highly reactive intermediate spontaneously triggers subsequent double proton transfer along its tethering H-bonds, finally converting it into HCOOH. These hydrogen-bonded nanoreactors feature multiple functions in facilitating CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R such as confining, tethering, H-bond catalyzing and proton pumping. Our findings have a general interest and extend the knowledge of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R into porous aqueous systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis of 4&#8208;Deoxy&#8208;4&#8208;Fluoro&#8208;d&#8208;Sedoheptulose: A Promising New Sugar to Apply the Principle of Metabolic Trapping</title>

Synthesis of 4&#8208;deoxy&#8208;4&#8208;fluorosedoheptulose (4DFS) and 3&#8208;deoxy&#8208;3&#8208;fluorosedoheptulose (3DFS) as well as of suitable precursors for the synthesis of their [18F]&#8208;analogues is described. First biochemical investigations show that 4DFS is taken up by human fibroblasts and phosphorylated (giving 4DFS7P) but not further metabolized by transaldolase or transketolase. Thus, 4DFS has a high potential as new pentose phosphate pathway imaging probe.







Abstract
Fluorinated carbohydrates are important tools for understanding the deregulation of metabolic fluxes and pathways. Fluorinating specific positions within the sugar scaffold can lead to enhanced metabolic stability and subsequent metabolic trapping in cells. This principle has, however, never been applied to study the metabolism of the rare sugars of the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). In this study, two fluorinated derivatives of d&#8208;sedoheptulose were designed and synthesized: 4&#8208;deoxy&#8208;4&#8208;fluoro&#8208;d&#8208;sedoheptulose (4DFS) and 3&#8208;deoxy&#8208;3&#8208;fluoro&#8208;d&#8208;sedoheptulose (3DFS). Both sugars are taken up by human fibroblasts but only 4DFS is phosphorylated. Fluorination of d&#8208;sedoheptulose at C&#8208;4 effectively halts the enzymatic degradation by transaldolase and transketolase. 4DFS thus has a high potential as a new PPP imaging probe based on the principle of metabolic trapping. Therefore, the synthesis of potential radiolabeling precursors for 4DFS for future radiofluorinations with fluorine&#8208;18 is presented.

         <title>The Effect of Intramolecular Hydrogen Bonds on the Rotational Barriers of the Biaryl C&#8722;C Axis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 62, November 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we show that the transition state of atropisomerization of tri&#8208;ortho&#8208;substituted biaryl was stabilized by intramolecular hydrogen bonds, resulting in a significant reduction in the steric repulsion around C&#8722;C axes and a decrease in the energy barrier of atropisomerization (&#916;&#916;G&#8800;(10&#8208;9)=46.7&#8197;kJ/mol).







Abstract
Axially chiral compounds are attracting more attention recently. Although hydrogen bonds are reported as a vital weak force that influences the properties of compounds, the effect of intramolecular hydrogen bonds on the atropisomerization of the Caryl&#8722;Caryl single bonds has not yet been well quantitatively investigated. Here, a series of axially chiral biaryl compounds were synthesized to study the effect of hydrogen bonds on the rotational barriers of the biaryl C&#8722;C axis. Experimental studies demonstrated that the rotational barrier of hydrogen bonding biaryl 9 was significantly lower (46.7&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1) than biaryl 10 without hydrogen bonds. Furthermore, theoretical studies revealed that the intramolecular hydrogen bond stabilized the transition state (TS) of tri&#8208;ortho&#8208;substituted biaryl 9, relieving the steric repulsion in the TS. We believe that this study will provide chemists with a deeper understanding of the atropisomerization process of axially chiral biaryl compounds.

Mono&#8208;boryl complexes: The synthesis of the first terminal mono&#8208;boryl complexes of nickel, which are not stabilized by a pincer ligand, is reported.







Abstract
The synthesis of the first terminal mono&#8208;boryl complexes of nickel, which are not stabilized by a pincer ligand, is reported. The reaction of the nickel bis&#8208;boryl complex cis&#8208;[Ni(iPr2ImMe)2(Bcat)2] 1 (cat=1,2&#8208;O2C6H4) with the small donor ligand PMe3 led to a complete ligand exchange at nickel with reductive elimination of B2cat2 and formation of the bis&#8208;NHC adduct [B2cat2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;(iPr2ImMe)2] 3 and [Ni(PMe3)4] 2 as the metal&#8208;containing species. Electrophilic attack of MeI on complex 1 or ligand dismutation of 1 with trans&#8208;[Ni(iPr2ImMe)2Br2] led to loss of only one boryl ligand of 1 and afforded the nickel mono&#8208;boryl complexes trans&#8208;[Ni(iPr2ImMe)2(Bcat)Br] 4&#8201;a and trans&#8208;[Ni(iPr2ImMe)2(Bcat)I] 4&#8201;b.

         <title>Functional Molecular Crystals from the Arylation of a Halogenoplatinum Complex: Stimuli Responsiveness, Comproportionation, and &#960;&#8208;Bridged Dimerization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 62, November 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An arylplatinum complex that shows polymorph&#8208;dependent emission, mechano&#8208; and thermochromic luminescence, as well as comproportionation and &#960;&#8208;bridged dimerization is reported. Simple mixing of this complex with a structurally similar arylplatinum complex in solution at room temperature resulted in transfer of their aryl groups (comproportionation); this allows their mechanochromic profiles to be tuned. Recrystallization of the complex afforded a dimerized product in which two platinum ions are bridged by aryl groups resulting in a very short (3.0466(10) &#197;) Pt&#8722;Pt distance.







Abstract
A chloroplatinum complex was arylated to obtain stimuli&#8208;responsive molecular crystals. The resulting arylplatinum complex showed polymorph&#8208;dependent emission, mechano&#8208; and thermochromic luminescence as well as comproportionation and &#960;&#8208;bridged dimerization. Simple mixing of structurally similar arylplatinum complexes at room temperature resulted in the transfer of their aryl groups (comproportionation), which allowed their mechanochromic profiles to be tuned.

&lt;p&gt;A chloroplatinum complex was arylated to obtain stimuli-responsive molecular crystals. The resulting arylplatinum complex showed polymorph-dependent emission, mechano- and thermochromic luminescence as well as comproportionation and &#960;-bridged dimerization. Simple mixing of structurally similar arylplatinum complexes at room temperature resulted in the transfer of their aryl groups (comproportionation), which allowed their mechanochromic profiles to be tuned.

         <title>Electrosynthesis of Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Films with Well&#8208;Defined Facets</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 62, November 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we report a facile anodic electrochemical synthesis method for the in&#8208;situ preparation of metal&#8211;organic framework films with well&#8208;defined facets by precisely regulating the supersaturation of the growth units. This method provides a powerful toolbox for various applications that require precise control of crystal facets in MOF films.







Abstract
The deposition of metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) films with defined exposed facets is important to enhance the performance of these films for, for example, catalysis or separations. In this work, MOF films with specific exposed facets are electrodeposited anodically on various substrates (e.&#8201;g. on copper&#8208;sputtered Si wafers, copper meshes, copper foams, and polypropylene membranes). The influence of the deposition parameters, including the pH of the solution, current density, concentration of linker, and solvent, on the exposed facets of the deposited MOFs was investigated. The results suggest that precise control over the supersaturation during anodic deposition is a possible strategy for synthesizing MOF crystals with well&#8208;defined exposed facets. This approach provides a powerful toolbox for various applications requiring crystal facet control of MOF films.

         <title>Gated Photochromism of Dithienylethene&#8208;Embedded Expanded Calixphyrins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 62, November 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
DTE&#8208;embedded expanded calixphyrins exhibit reversible photochromism. The closed forms of these porphyrinoids are oxidized with DDQ to lock the recorded information by converting to photochemically inactive expanded porphyrins, which can be reduced with NaBH4 to restore the photochromism activity. This gated photochromic behavior was demonstrated in PMMA film.







Abstract
Dithienylethene (DTE)&#8208;embedded expanded porphyrins were synthesized and confirmed to be photochemically inactive due to the lowest excited state of the expanded porphyrins. On the other hand, DTE&#8208;embedded expanded calixphyrins exhibited reversible photochromism upon UV&#8208;irradiation to form colored closed forms, which reverted to colorless open forms upon red&#8208;light irradiation. The closed forms were oxidized with DDQ or the air to lock the recorded information by converting to photochemically inactive expanded porphyrins. This was unlocked by reduction with NaBH4 to restore expanded calixphyrins with photochromism activity. These gated photochromic behaviors were demonstrated in PMMA (polymethyl methacrylate) film.

Machine Learning&#8208;powered metadynamics enabling the unbiased selection of collective variables to describe the binding free energy of a non&#8208;covalent metallodrug/DNA G&#8208;quadruplex adduct and the effects of water solvation.







Abstract
In the context of drug discovery, computational methods were able to accelerate the challenging process of designing and optimizing a new drug candidate. Amongst the possible atomistic simulation approaches, metadynamics (metaD) has proven very powerful. However, the choice of collective variables (CVs) is not trivial for complex systems. To automate the process of CVs identification, two different machine learning algorithms were applied in this study, namely DeepLDA and Autoencoder, to the metaD simulation of a well&#8208;researched drug/target complex, consisting in a pharmacologically relevant non&#8208;canonical DNA secondary structure (G&#8208;quadruplex) and a metallodrug acting as its stabilizer, as well as solvent molecules.

         <title>Isonitrile&#8208;Proline &#8208; A Versatile Handle for the Chemoselective Derivatization of Collagen Peptides</title>

         <dc:description>
Isonitrileproline (Inp) is introduced as the first isonitrile&#8208;containing amino acid for solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis. The conformation directing properties of the isonitrile group and its effect on the collagen triple helix were elucidated. The value of Inp for peptide derivatization was showcased by a chemoselective ligation with a functional chlorooxime.







Abstract
Functional groups that allow for chemoselective and bioorthogonal derivatization are valuable tools for the labelling of peptides and proteins. The isonitrile is such a group but synthetic methods for its incorporation into peptides by solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis are not known. Here, we introduce (4S)&#8208; and (4R)&#8208;isonitrileproline (Inp) as building blocks for solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis. Conformational studies of (4S)&#8208; and (4R)&#8208;Inp and thermal stability analysis of Inp&#8208;containing collagen triple helices revealed that the isonitrile group exerts a stereoelectronic gauche effect. We showcase the value of Inp for bioorthogonal labelling by derivatization of Inp&#8208;containing collagen model peptides (CMPs). Dual labelling with a pair of bioorthogonal reactions of a CMP containing Inp and azidoproline residues further highlights the versatility of the new isonitrile&#8208;containing amino acids.

         <title>Tunable Chromic Properties of Viologen&#8208;Metal Polymers Modulated by Coordination Modes for Inkless Erasable Printing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 62, November 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
With the help of theoretical calculations, we predicted that tunable chromic properties of viologen&#8208;metal polymers could be achieved through modulating coordination modes. Two ZnII&#8208;viologen model polymers were successfully synthesized and comparative experimental vigorously confirm bilateral coordination model exhibit quicker stimuli response, stronger color contrast, longer radical lifetime, which also has shown excellent inkless&#8208;erasable&#8208;printing performance.







Abstract
Inkless and erasable printing (IEP) based on chromic materials holds great promise to alleviate environmental and sustainable problems. Metal&#8211;organic polymers (MOPs) are bright platforms for constructing IEP materials. However, it is still challenging to design target MOPs with excellent specific functions rationally due to the intricate component&#8208;structure&#8208;property relationships. Herein, an effective strategy was proposed for the rational design IEP&#8208;MOP materials. The stimuli&#8208;responsive viologen moiety was introduced into the construction of MOPs to give it potential chromic behaviors and two different coordination models (i.&#8201;e. bilateral coordination model, M1; unilateral coordinated model, M2) based on the same viologen ligand were designed. Aided by theoretical calculations, model M1 was recommended secondarily as a more suitable system for IEP materials. Along this line, two representative viologen&#8208;ZnII MOPs 1 and 2 with models M1 and M2 were synthesized successfully. Experiments exhibit that 1 does have quicker stimuli response, stronger color contrast and longer radical lifetime compared to 2.

     alt="Tunable Chromic Properties of Viologen-Metal Polymers Modulated by Coordination Modes for Inkless Erasable Printing"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the help of theoretical calculations, we predicted that tunable chromic properties of viologen-metal polymers could be achieved through modulating coordination modes. Two Zn&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;-viologen model polymers were successfully synthesized and comparative experimental vigorously confirm bilateral coordination model exhibit quicker stimuli response, stronger color contrast, longer radical lifetime, which also has shown excellent inkless-erasable-printing performance.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inkless and erasable printing (IEP) based on chromic materials holds great promise to alleviate environmental and sustainable problems. Metal&#8211;organic polymers (MOPs) are bright platforms for constructing IEP materials. However, it is still challenging to design target MOPs with excellent specific functions rationally due to the intricate component-structure-property relationships. Herein, an effective strategy was proposed for the rational design IEP-MOP materials. The stimuli-responsive viologen moiety was introduced into the construction of MOPs to give it potential chromic behaviors and two different coordination models (i.&#8201;e. bilateral coordination model, &lt;b&gt;M&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;; unilateral coordinated model, &lt;b&gt;M&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;) based on the same viologen ligand were designed. Aided by theoretical calculations, model &lt;b&gt;M&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; was recommended secondarily as a more suitable system for IEP materials. Along this line, two representative viologen-Zn&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; MOPs &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; with models &lt;b&gt;M&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;M&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; were synthesized successfully. Experiments exhibit that &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; does have quicker stimuli response, stronger color contrast and longer radical lifetime compared to &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;. Significantly, the obtained &lt;b&gt;1-IEP&lt;/b&gt; media brightly inherits the excellent chromic characteristics of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; and the flexibility of the paper at the same time, which achieves most daily printing requirements, as well as enough resolution and durability to be used in identification by smart device.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photoisomerization of &#8220;Partially Embedded Dihydropyridazine&#8221; with a Helical Structure</title>

Photoisomerization of &#8220;partially embedded fused&#8208;dihydropyridazine N&#8208;aryl aza[5]helicene derivatives&#8221; (PDH) with a helical structure inspires the demonstration of intrinsic photo&#8208;triggered multi&#8208;functional properties based on a Kekul&#233; biradical and structural flexibility. Multiple functions, such as T&#8208;type photochromism, photo&#8208;excitation&#8208;mediated triplet biradical formation, and photoracemization, which are attributed to PDH, are revealed.







Abstract
Herein, we report the synthesis of two &#8220;partially embedded fused&#8208;dihydropyridazine N&#8208;aryl aza[5]helicene derivatives&#8221; (PDHs) and the demonstration of their intrinsic photo&#8208;triggered multi&#8208;functional properties based on a Kekul&#233; biradical structure. Introducing bulky electron&#8208;withdrawing trifluoromethyl or pentafluoroethyl groups into the aza[5]helicene framework (PDH&#8208;CF3 and &#8722;C2F5) gives PDH axial chirality based on the helicity of the P and M forms, even at room temperature. Upon photo&#8208;irradiation of PDH&#8208;CF3 in a frozen solution, an ESR signal from the triplet biradical with zero&#8208;field splitting values, generated by N&#8722;N bond dissociation, was observed. However, when the irradiation was turned off, the ESR signal became silent, thus indicating the existence of two equilibria: between the biradical and quinoidal forms based on the Kekul&#233; structure, and between N&#8722;N bond cleavage and recombination. The observed photo&#8208; and thermally induced behaviors indicate that T&#8208;type photochromic molecules are involved in the photoisomerization mechanism involving the two equilibria. Inspired by the photoisomerization, chirality control of PDH by photoracemization was achieved. Multiple functionalities, such as T&#8208;type photochromism, photo&#8208;excitation&#8208;mediated triplet biradical formation, and photoracemization, which are attributed to the &#8220;partially embedded dihydropyridazine&#8221; structure, are demonstrated.

         <title>Iminoboranes With Parent B=NH Entity: Imino Group Metathesis, Nucleophilic Reactivity and N&#8722;N Coupling</title>

Imine or not Imine? We present a rare example of a parent iminoborane with the unfunctionalized B=NH entity. The reactivity of this rare compound class shows remarkable differences to boron's neighbor element carbon as found in organic imines.







Abstract
While R2C=N&#8722;R double bonds in organic imines are well established, the related iminoboranes R&#8208;B=N&#8722;R are either prone to oligomerization or can only be stabilized at sufficient steric congestion. In particular, the examples of unsubstituted parent B=N&#8208;H entity are rare. We demonstrate that the amino imidazoline&#8208;2&#8208;imine ligand system (HAmIm) not only gives rise to the isolation of a parent (AmIm)B=N&#8722;H iminoborane, but also to species of type (AmIm)B=N&#8208;SiMe3 with concomitant stabilization by lithium bromide. The double bond character in these systems is unambiguously corroborated by DFT calculations. The steric accessibility of the (AmIm)B=NH unit allows facile reactivity including metathesis reactions with C=O and C=S bonds, nucleophilic addition toward organic and organometallic carbonyl compounds, but also oxidative N&#8722;N coupling within a dimeric unit. Thus, the chemical behavior of the (AmIm)B=N&#8722;H and (AmIm)B=N&#8208;SiMe3 is distinctly different from that of organic imines.

By converting the halogen moiety of a metal complex into a &#960;&#8208;conjugated system, unique properties such as &#960;&#8208;bridged dimerization and comproportionation can be realized. To illustrate the unique bridging style of the dimer, a diagram of the arrangement of artificial satellites is depicted. The comproportionation is represented by the convergence of two rays, transforming into one ray with both characteristics. More information can be found in the Research Article by T. Seki and D. Korenaga (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202302333).

Checkmate! Metastable connections of AgII and sulfate dianions have so far been limited to a quasi&#8208;binary one&#8208;dimensional antiferromagnet, AgSO4. Preparation of Cu[Ag(SO4)2], the first member of the MII[Ag(SO4)2] series, paves the way towards strongly coupled two&#8208;dimensional antiferromagnets with a chessboard&#8208;like spin arrangement within [Ag(SO4)2]2&#8211; sublattice.

Chirality control of the title compound by photoracemization is depicted, inspired by &#8220;Jack and the Beanstalk&#8221;. The spiraling trees reaching skyward symbolize molecular changes induced by sunlight, specifically photoirradiation. This image vividly portrays the N&#8722;N bond cleavage within the dihydropyridazine (DHP) ring, rotational motions around a C&#8722;C bond, and the subsequent recombination of N&#8722;N bonds. These transformations serve as a visual representation of the concept of T&#8208;type photochromism of new&#8208;type helicene molecules. More information can be found in the Research Article by K. Usui, Y. Kobori, S. Karasawa and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202302413).

         <title>Probing Interactions between Chiral Plasmonic Nanoparticles and Biomolecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 62, November 8, 2023. </description>

Detecting interactions: This review of the interactions between chiral plasmonic nanoparticle systems and biomolecules focuses on the application of circular dichroism spectroscopy to probe such interactions, toward biosensing applications.







Abstract
Chiral plasmonic nanoparticles (and their assemblies) interact with biomolecules in a variety of different ways, resulting in distinct optical signatures when probed by circular dichroism spectroscopy. These systems show promise for biosensing applications and offer several advantages over achiral plasmonic systems. Arguably the most notable advantage is that chiral nanoparticles can differentiate between molecular enantiomers and can, therefore, act as sensors for enantiomeric purity. Furthermore, chiral nanoparticles can couple more effectively to chiral biomolecules in biological systems if they have a matching handedness, improving their effectiveness as biomedical agents. In this article, we review the different types of interactions that occur between chiral plasmonic nanoparticle systems and biomolecules, and discuss how circular dichroism spectroscopy can probe these interactions and inform how to optimize systems for biosensing and biomedical applications.

         <title>Spatially Resolved Chiroptical Spectroscopies Emphasizing Recent Applications to Thin Films of Chiral Organic Dyes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 62, November 8, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A critical and up&#8208;to&#8208;date overview is given on spatially resolved chiroptical spectroscopies, which represent a promising tool for mapping and disentangling local supramolecular structures in thin films of chiral organic dyes.







Abstract
Instrumental techniques able to identify and structurally characterize the aggregation states in thin films of chiral organic &#960;&#8208;conjugated materials, from the first&#8208;order supramolecular arrangement up to the microscopic and mesoscopic scale, are very helpful for clarifying structure&#8208;property relationships. Chiroptical imaging is currently gaining a central role, for its ability of mapping local supramolecular structures in thin films. The present review gives an overview of electronic circular dichroism imaging (ECDi), circularly polarized luminescence imaging (CPLi), and vibrational circular dichroism imaging (VCDi), with a focus on their applications on thin films of chiral organic dyes as case studies.

         <title>The Origin of Delayed Polymorphism in Molecular Crystals Under Mechanochemical Conditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The extended induction period associated with mechanochemical polymorphism arises from the phenomenon of mechanical activation, which preceeds the transformation.







Abstract
We show that mechanochemically driven polymorphic transformations can require extremely long induction periods, which can be tuned from hours to days by changing ball milling energy. The robust design and interpretation of ball milling experiments must account for this unexpected kinetics that arises from energetic phenomena unique to the solid state. Detailed thermal analysis, combined with DFT simulations, indicates that these marked induction periods are associated with processes of mechanical activation. Correspondingly, we show that the pre&#8208;activation of reagents can also lead to marked changes in the length of induction periods. Our findings demonstrate a new dimension for exerting control over polymorphic transformations in organic crystals. We expect mechanical activation to have a much broader implication across organic solid&#8208;state mechanochemistry.

         <title>Initial Quenching Efficiency Determines Light&#8208;Driven H2 Evolution of [Mo3S13]2&#8722; in Lipid Bilayers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Light&#8208;driven H2 evolution at water&#8208;liposomes interfaces with molecular catalyst and photosensitizer is determined by the properties of the lipid bilayer. Initial light&#8208;driven charge transfer at room temperature depends upon the local lipid environment, with the highest efficiency at the transition temperature of the lipid bilayer.







Abstract
Nature uses reactive components embedded in biological membranes to perform light&#8208;driven photosynthesis. Here, a model artificial photosynthetic system for light&#8208;driven hydrogen (H2) evolution is reported.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Light-driven H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; evolution&lt;/b&gt; at water-liposomes interfaces with molecular catalyst and photosensitizer is determined by the properties of the lipid bilayer. Initial light-driven charge transfer at room temperature depends upon the local lipid environment, with the highest efficiency at the transition temperature of the lipid bilayer.
&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Mechanistic Avenues in the Chan&#8208;Lam&#8208;Based Etherification Reaction: A Computational Exploration</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have carried out extensive computational investigations to explore the mechanistic avenues in CuII(OAC)2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O&#8208;catalyzed Chan&#8208;Lam&#8208;based etherification reaction. Transmetalation from the methoxide&#8208;bridged CuII intermediate is rate determining. Hammett studies indicate higher catalytic turnovers for electron&#8208;rich boronic ester substituents.







Abstract
Ongoing advances in CuII&#8208;catalyzed aerobic oxidative coupling reactions between arylboronic esters and diverse heteroatom nucleophiles have strengthened the development of the general Chan&#8208;Lam (CL)&#8208;based reaction protocol, including C&#8722;O bond formation methodologies. In&#8208;depth mechanistic understanding of CL etherification with specific emphasis on different reaction routes and their energetics are still lacking, even though the reaction has been experimentally explored. Here, we present a DFT&#8208;guided computational study to unravel the mechanistic pathways of CL&#8208;based etherification. The computational findings provide some interesting insights into the fundamental steps of the catalytic cycle, particularly the rate&#8208;determining transmetalation event. An aryl boronic ester&#8208;coordinated, methoxide&#8208;bridged CuII intermediate that acts as resting state undergoes transmetalation with an activation barrier of 20.4&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1. The energy spans of the remaining fundamental steps leading to the methoxylated product are relatively low. The minor p&#8208;cresol product requires an additional 14.2&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 energy span to surmount in comparison to the favored route. Hammett studies for the substituted aryl boronic esters reveal higher reaction turnovers for electron&#8208;rich aryl systems. The results agree with previously reported spectroscopic and kinetic observations. For a series of alcohol substrates, it was observed that, except for cyclohexanol, moderate to high etherification turnovers are predicted.

         <title>Exceptionally Stable And Super&#8208;Efficient Electrocatalysts Derived From Semiconducting Metal Phosphonate Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two isostructural semiconducting metal phosphonate frameworks, Co2[1,4&#8208;NDPA] and Zn2[1,4&#8208;NDPA] (1,4&#8208;NDPA4&#8722; is 1,4&#8208;naphthalenediphosphonate), are reported which have optical bandgaps within the semiconducting regime (1.7&#8197;eV and 2.5&#8197;eV, respectively),. The electrocatalyst derived from Co2[1,4&#8208;NPDA] as a precatalyst holds potential in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER).







Abstract
Two new isostructural semiconducting metal&#8208;phosphonate frameworks are reported. Co2[1,4&#8208;NDPA] and Zn2[1,4&#8208;NDPA] (1,4&#8208;NDPA4&#8722; is 1,4&#8208;naphthalenediphosphonate) have optical bandgaps of 1.7&#8197;eV and 2.5&#8197;eV, respectively. The electrocatalyst derived from Co2[1,4&#8208;NPDA] as a precatalyst generated a low overpotential of 374&#8197;mV in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with a Tafel slope of 43&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1 at a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in alkaline electrolyte (1&#8197;mol&#8201;L&#8722;1 KOH), which is indicative of remarkably superior reaction kinetics. Benchmarking of the OER of Co2[1,4&#8208;NPDA] material as a precatalyst coupled with nickel foam (NF) showed exceptional long&#8208;term stability at a current density of 50&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for water splitting compared to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Pt/C/RuO2@NF after 30&#8197;h in 1&#8197;mol&#8201;L&#8722;1 KOH. In order to further understand the OER mechanism, the transformation of Co2[1,4&#8208;NPDA] into its electrocatalytically active species was investigated.

Dimer contest: A combined matrix&#8208;isolation spectroscopic and theoretical study provides unprecedented insight into isolated dimers of two constitutional benzoacridine isomers and the differences to dimeric structures in the crystalline solid state.







Abstract
In this work, matrix&#8208;isolation spectroscopy and quantum&#8208;chemical calculations are used together to analyse the structure and properties of weakly bound dimers of the two isomers benzo[a]acridine and benzo[c]acridine. Our measured experimental electronic absorbance spectra agree with simulated spectra calculated for the equilibrium structures of the dimers in gas&#8208;phase, but in contrast, disagree with the simulated spectra calculated for the structures obtained by optimising the experimental solid&#8208;state structures. This highlights the sensitivity of the electronic excitations with respect to the dimer structures. The comparison between the solid&#8208;state and gas&#8208;phase dimers shows how far the intermolecular interactions could change the geometric and electronic structure in a disordered bulk material or at device interfaces, imposing consequences for exciton and charge mobility and other material properties.

Borrowing hydrogen: The catalytic efficiency of phosphine&#8208;free non&#8208;bifunctional MnI&#8722;NHC complexes of chelating heteroditopic ligands featuring ImNHC connected to a 1,2,3&#8208;triazole&#8208;N or tzNHC donors through a methylene spacer have been explored for coupling of diverse nitriles with alcohols by borrowing hydrogen protocol. The catalyst Mn1 containing ImNHC connected to triazole&#8208;N donor displayed higher activity than Mn2/Mn3 containing an unsymmetrical bis&#8208;carbene donors (ImNHC and tzNHC).







Abstract
In the present work, several manganese(I) complexes of chelating heteroditopic ligands Mn1&#8211;3, featuring ImNHC (imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) connected to a 1,2,3&#8208;triazole&#8208;N or tzNHC (1,2,3&#8208;triazol&#8208;5&#8208;ylidene) donors via a methylene spacer, with possible modifications at the triazole backbone have been synthesized and completely characterized. Notably, the CO stretching frequencies, electrochemical analysis, and frontier orbital analysis certainly suggest that the chelating ImNHC&#8208;tzNHC ligands have stronger donation capabilities than the related ImNHC&#8208;Ntz ligand in the synthesized complexes. Moreover, these well&#8208;defined phosphine&#8208;free Mn(I)&#8722;NHC complexes have been found to be effective non&#8208;bifunctional catalysts for the &#945;&#8208;alkylation of nitriles using alcohols and importantly, the catalyst Mn1 containing ImNHC connected to a weaker triazole&#8208;N donor displayed higher activity compared to Mn2/Mn3 containing an unsymmetrical bis&#8208;carbene donors (ImNHC and tzNHC). A wide range of aryl nitriles were coupled with diverse (hetero)aromatic as well as aliphatic alcohols to get the corresponding products in good to excellent yields (32 examples, up to 95&#8201;% yield). The detailed mechanistic studies including deuterium labelling experiments reveal that the reaction follows a Borrowing Hydrogen pathway.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Borrowing hydrogen&lt;/b&gt;: The catalytic efficiency of phosphine-free non-bifunctional Mn&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;&#8722;NHC complexes of chelating heteroditopic ligands featuring ImNHC connected to a 1,2,3-triazole-N or tzNHC donors through a methylene spacer have been explored for coupling of diverse nitriles with alcohols by borrowing hydrogen protocol. The catalyst &lt;b&gt;Mn1&lt;/b&gt; containing ImNHC connected to triazole-N donor displayed higher activity than &lt;b&gt;Mn2/Mn3&lt;/b&gt; containing an unsymmetrical bis-carbene donors (ImNHC and tzNHC).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the present work, several manganese(I) complexes of chelating heteroditopic ligands &lt;b&gt;Mn1&#8211;3&lt;/b&gt;, featuring ImNHC (imidazol-2-ylidene) connected to a 1,2,3-triazole-N or tzNHC (1,2,3-triazol-5-ylidene) donors via a methylene spacer, with possible modifications at the triazole backbone have been synthesized and completely characterized. Notably, the CO stretching frequencies, electrochemical analysis, and frontier orbital analysis certainly suggest that the chelating ImNHC-tzNHC ligands have stronger donation capabilities than the related ImNHC-Ntz ligand in the synthesized complexes. Moreover, these well-defined phosphine-free Mn(I)&#8722;NHC complexes have been found to be effective non-bifunctional catalysts for the &#945;-alkylation of nitriles using alcohols and importantly, the catalyst &lt;b&gt;Mn1&lt;/b&gt; containing ImNHC connected to a weaker triazole-N donor displayed higher activity compared to &lt;b&gt;Mn2&lt;/b&gt;/&lt;b&gt;Mn3&lt;/b&gt; containing an unsymmetrical bis-carbene donors (ImNHC and tzNHC). A wide range of aryl nitriles were coupled with diverse (hetero)aromatic as well as aliphatic alcohols to get the corresponding products in good to excellent yields (32 examples, up to 95&#8201;% yield). The detailed mechanistic studies including deuterium labelling experiments reveal that the reaction follows a Borrowing Hydrogen pathway.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chasing Turns and Twists: Unraveling the One&#8208;Step Synthesis, Intricate Pathways, and Structural Revelations of N&#8208;Aryl Aza&#8208;quasi[8]circulenes</title>

COT is caught! This report presents an efficient one&#8208;step, metal&#8208;free synthesis of aza&#8208;quasi[8]circulenes from bis(biaryl)carbazoles. The regioselective &#8242;fold&#8208;in&#8242; synthesis unravels the intricate pathways involved and overcomes the helical strain in the intermediate aza[7]helicene formed. The resulting aza&#8208;quasi[8]circulenes feature a non&#8208;planar central cyclooctatetraene (COT) and exhibit intriguing optical, chiroptical, and redox properties, making them promising candidates for future applications in organic electronics.







Abstract
An efficient one&#8208;step synthesis of N&#8208;Aryl aza&#8208;quasi[8]circulenes is reported starting from bis(biaryl)carbazoles. The intermediacy of N&#8208;aryl aza[7]helicene is investigated, and the Scholl oxidative cyclization route is invoked here to overcome the large strain during the formation of N&#8208;aryl aza&#8208;quasi[8]circulenes from N&#8208;aryl aza[7]helicene. Notably, this transformation occurs without the need for directing groups and proceeds from a more helical to a less helical pathway. Both the N&#8208;aryl aza[7]helicene and N&#8208;aryl aza&#8208;quasi[8]circulene are confirmed by single crystal X&#8208;ray structural analysis. The enantiomers of N&#8208;aryl aza[7]helicene are separated by chiral HPLC and analyzed by circular dichroism spectroscopy to investigate their chiroptical properties. However, N&#8208;aryl aza&#8208;quasi[8]circulene racemizes rapidly. The radical cations generated from aza&#8208;quasi[8]circulene through chemical oxidation exhibit broad absorption in the near&#8208;IR region and air stability up to 24&#8197;h. Optical and electrochemical studies with aza[7]helicene and aza&#8208;quasi[8]circulene derivatives highlight their potential in organic electronic devices.

         <title>Pinacol Cross&#8208;Coupling Promoted by an Aluminyl Anion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The potassium aluminyl K[Al(NON)] (NON=[O(SiMe2NDipp)2]2&#8722;) is a suitable platform for the pinacol coupling of aldehydes and ketones. Isolating an intermediate allows unsymmetrical examples to be accessed via a sequential addition strategy. A rare example of a p&#8208;block ketyl complex was isolated, and DFT was used to confirm a carbon&#8208;based radical. Product release was achieved using an iodosilane, demonstrating the steps required to generate a closed synthetic cycle.







Abstract
A simple sequential addition protocol for the reductive coupling of ketones and aldehydes by a potassium aluminyl grants access to unsymmetrical pinacolate derivatives. Isolation of an aluminium ketyl complex presents evidence for the accessibility of radical species. Product release from the aluminium centre was achieved using an iodosilane, forming the disilylated 1,2&#8208;diol and a neutral aluminium iodide, thereby demonstrating the steps required to generate a closed synthetic cycle for pinacol (cross) coupling at an aluminyl anion.

         <title>Acceptorless or Transfer Dehydrogenation of Glycerol Catalyzed by Base Metal Salt Cobaltous Chloride &#8211; Facile Access to Lactic Acid and Hydrogen or Isopropanol</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Readily available, inexpensive, environmentally benign and earth&#8208;abundant base metal salt cobaltous chloride has been employed to catalyze the reforming of glycerol to lactic acid in high yield and excellent selectivity either in an acceptorless fashion or under transfer dehydrogenation conditions at 160&#8201;&#176;C.







Abstract
The dehydrogenation of glycerol to lactic acid (LA) under both acceptorless and transfer dehydrogenation conditions using readily available, inexpensive, environmentally benign and earth&#8208;abundant base metal salt CoCl2 is reported here. The CoCl2 (0.5&#8197;mol&#8201;%) catalyzed acceptorless dehydrogenation of glycerol at 160&#8201;&#176;C in the presence of 0.75&#8197;equiv. of KOH, gave up to 33&#8201;% yield of LA in 44&#8201;% selectivity apart from hydrogen. Alternatively, with acetone as a sacrificial hydrogen acceptor, the CoCl2 (0.5&#8197;mol&#8201;%) catalyzed dehydrogenation of glycerol at 160&#8201;&#176;C in the presence of 1.1&#8197;equiv. of NaOtBu resulted in up to 93&#8201;% LA with 96&#8201;% selectivity along with another value&#8208;added product isopropanol. Labelling studies revealed a modest secondary KIE of 1.68 which points to the involvement of C&#8722;H bond activation as a part of the catalytic cycle but not as a part of the rate&#8208;determining step. Catalyst poisoning experiments with PPh3 and CS2 are indicative of the homogeneous nature of the reaction mixture involving molecular species that are likely to be in&#8208;situ formed octahedral Co(II) as inferred from EPR, HRMS and Evans magnetic moment studies. The net transfer dehydrogenation activity is attributed to exclusive contribution from the alcoholysis step.

         <title>Support Engineering for the Stabilisation of Heterogeneous Pd3P&#8208;Based Catalysts for Heck Coupling Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The concept of support engineering using phosphorus&#8208;modified silica is used to modulate catalyst&#8208;support interactions and to stabilize catalytically active species on the support. Following this approach, an enhanced catalytic performance and catalyst stability as well as a reduction of metal leaching can be achieved for Pd3P.







Abstract
Herein we report the use of a supported Pd3P catalyst for Heck coupling reactions. For the stabilisation of Pd3P and Pd, as reference system, the silica support material was modified via phosphorus doping (0.5 and 1&#8197;wt&#8201;% P). Through this so&#8208;called support engineering approach, the catalytic activity of Pd3P was clearly enhanced. Whereas an iodobenzene conversion of 79&#8201;% was witnessed for Pd3P@SiO2 in the coupling of styrene and iodobenzene in 1&#8197;h, 90&#8201;% conversion could be achieved using Pd3P@1P&#8208;SiO2. This improved catalytic activity probably stems from an electronic modulation of the support surface via the introduction of phosphorus. Simultaneously, the recyclability was boosted and the Pd3P@1P&#8208;SiO2 catalyst has shown to maintain its catalytic activity over several recovery tests. Hereby, metal leaching could almost be suppressed completely to 3&#8201;% by the use of a P&#8208;modified silica support.

         <title>An Aryl&#8208;ether&#8208;linked Covalent Organic Framework Modified with Thioamide Groups for Selective Extraction of Palladium from Strong Acid Solutions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust covalent organic framework (COF) functionalized with thioamide groups exhibits remarkable selectivity and high adsorption capacity for palladium from 4&#8197;M nitric acid, underscoring the highly promising potential of COFs for environmental remediation under harsh conditions.







Abstract
Efficient adsorption of palladium ions from acid nuclear waste solution is crucial for ensuring the safety of vitrification process for radioactive waste. However, the limited stability and selectivity of most current adsorbents hinder their practical applications under strong acid and intense radiation conditions. Herein, to address these limitations, we designed and synthesized an aryl&#8208;ether&#8208;linked covalent organic framework (COF&#8208;316&#8208;DM) grafted dimethylthiocarbamoyl groups on the pore walls. This unique structure endows COF&#8208;316&#8208;DM with high stability and exceptional palladium capture capacity. The robust polyarylether linkage enables COF&#8208;316&#8208;DM to withstand irradiation doses of 200 or 400&#8197;kGy of &#946;/&#947; ray. Furthermore, COF&#8208;316&#8208;DM demonstrates fast adsorption kinetics, high adsorption capacity (147&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1), and excellent reusability in 4&#8197;M nitric acid. Moreover, COF&#8208;316&#8208;DM exhibits remarkable selectivity for palladium ions in the presence of 17 interference ions, simulating high level liquid waste scenario. The superior adsorption performance can be attributed to the strong binding affinity between the thioamide groups and Pd2+ ions, as confirmed by the comprehensive analysis of FT&#8208;IR and XPS spectra. Our findings highlight the potential of COFs with robust linkers and tailored functional groups for efficient and selective capture of metal ions, even in harsh environmental conditions.

         <title>Modifying the Catalytic Activity of Lipopeptide Assemblies with Nucleobases</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biomolecular conjugates consisting of a catalytic tripeptide, a fatty acid and nucleobase moieties form defined fibrillar assemblies in aqueous media and catalyze the reaction of butanal with nitrostyrene. The interaction between complementary nucleobases enhanced the order in the supramolecular assemblies and influenced the catalytic properties of the peptide&#8208;nucleolipids, indicating that nucleobases can be valuable for control over the self&#8208;assembly and catalytic properties of biologically inspired supramolecular catalysts.







Abstract
Biohybrid catalysts that operate in aqueous media are intriguing for systems chemistry. In this paper, we investigate whether control over the self&#8208;assembly of biohybrid catalysts can tune their properties. As a model, we use the catalytic activity of functional hybrid molecules consisting of a catalytic H&#8208;dPro&#8208;Pro&#8208;Glu tripeptide, derivatized with fatty acid and nucleobase moieties. This combination of simple biological components merged the catalytic properties of the peptide with the self&#8208;assembly of the lipid, and the structural ordering of the nucleobases. The biomolecule hybrids self&#8208;assemble in aqueous media into fibrillar assemblies and catalyze the reaction between butanal and nitrostyrene. The interactions between the nucleobases enhanced the order of the supramolecular structures and affected their catalytic activity and stereoselectivity. The results point to the significant control and ordering that nucleobases can provide in the self&#8208;assembly of biologically inspired supramolecular catalysts.

         <title>Symmetrical and Mixed Tris(acyl)phosphines: Synthesis, Oxidation and Photochemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In a phosphorus mine, the acid chloride workers are shoveling red phosphorus to provide the chemicals necessary to produce the Brandsma reagent. This reaction leads to the formation of symmetrical and mixed trisacylphosphines. As these are in equilibrium with their corresponding phosphaalkenes, the trisacylphosphine form is enriched by increasing the temperature, as represented by the Bunsen burner. Production is then completed by oxidation to the corresponding symmetrical and mixed trisacylphosphine oxides, which is represented by the oxygen tank. More information can be found in the Research Article by G. Gescheidt, H. Gr&#252;tzmacher, M. Haas and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202302535).

         <title>Zeolite/Polymer Composites Prepared by Photopolymerization: Effect of Compensation Cations on Opacity and Gas Adsorption Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The fabrication of structured zeolite adsorbents through photopolymerization&#8208;based 3D printing which offers a solution to the limitations of conventional shaping techniques has been demonstrated but many parameters still need to be optimized. In this study, we studied the influence of zeolite compensation cations on the photopolymerization and the composite&#8217;s properties. Modified zeolites (LTA 4A and FAU 13X exchanged with K+, Li+, Sr2+, Ca2+ or Mg2+) were incorporated in PEGDA with BDMK as photoinitiator, and the formulation was cured under mild conditions (LED@405 nm, room temperature, under air). Our results indicate that the nature of zeolite compensation cations affects the colorimetric properties of polymer/zeolite composites: a better translucency parameter results in higher depth of cure. After calcination at 650 &#176;C and complete removal of PEGDA, pure zeolitic monoliths were tested for adsorption of gas molecules of interest (carbon dioxide, dichlorobenzene and water). Structured 4A and 13X monoliths obtained by 3D printing exhibit comparable adsorption capacity to commercial beads prepared from the same zeolites. This study enhances our understanding of the photopolymerization process involved in the production of polymer/zeolite composites. These composites are used in the fabrication of zeolitic objects through 3D printing, offering potential solutions to various environmental and dental challenges.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Shapeable and flexible pressure sensors with superior mechanical and electrical properties are of major interest as they can be employed in a wide range of applications. In this regard, elastomer&#8208;based composites incorporating carbon nanomaterials in the insulating matrix embody an appealing solution for designing flexible pressure sensors with specific properties. In this study, PDMS chains of different molecular weight were successfully functionalized with benzoxazine moieties in order to thermally cure them without adding a second component, nor a catalyst or an initiator. These precursors were then blended with 1 weight percent of multi&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) using an ultrasound probe, which induced a transition from a liquid&#8208;like to a gel&#8208;like behavior as CNTs generate an interconnected network within the matrix. After curing, the resulting nanocomposites exhibit mechanical and electrical properties making them highly promising materials for pressure&#8208;sensing applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Ring&#8208;Opening of 1,3&#8208;Imidazole Based Mesoionic Carbenes (iMICs) and Ring&#8208;Closing Clicks: Facile Access to iMIC&#8208;Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>

         <dc:description>This&#160;study presents an efficient method for on&#8208;resin dimer generation through self&#8208;condensation of 3,3&#8208;dimethoxypropionic acid&#8208;modified molecules, resulting in 2&#8208;pyridones. The approach demonstrated remarkable versatility by producing homodimers of peptides, peptoids, and non&#8208;peptidic ligands. Its ease of application, broad utility, and mild reaction conditions not only hold significance for peptide and peptoid research but also offer potential for the on&#8208;resin development of a wide range of bivalent ligands.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Biphenyl&#8208;bridged &#949;&#8208;Sultams by Organocatalytic Mannich Reactions of Cyclic N&#8208;Sulfonylimines with Unactivated Ketones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A highly enantioselective Mannich reaction of biphenyl&#8208;bridged seven&#8208;membered cyclic N&#8208;sulfonylimines with methyl alkyl ketones is disclosed in this study. The reaction was performed under organocatalysis, using a quinine&#8208;derived primary amine as the catalyst in combination with a Br&#248;nsted acid as the co&#8208;catalyst. High yields (up to 89%) and excellent enantioselectivities (up to 97% ee) were observed. For methyl alkyl ketones containing a larger alkyl substituent, specific regioselective addition to the C=N bond is favoured at the methyl group. On the contrary, ketones containing a smaller alkyl substituent or hydroxyacetone substrates gave major syn selective Mannich products at the methylene group.</dc:description>

         <title>Supporting Electrolyte&#8208;Free Electrochemical Oxidative C&#8210;H Sulfonylation and Thiocyanation of Fused Pyrimidin&#8208;4&#8208;ones in an All&#8208;Green Electrolytic System</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An electrooxidative C&#8210;H functionalization is a widely accepted route to obtain sulfur&#8208;containing arenes and heteroarenes. However, this process often involves using non&#8208;recyclable supporting electrolytes, (co)solvents like hexafluoroisopropanol, additives like acid, or catalysts. The use of additional reagents can increase costs and waste, reducing atom efficiency. Moreover, unlike other nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles, there have only been sporadic reports of electrochemical C&#8210;H functionalization in fused pyrimidin&#8208;4&#8208;ones, and an electrolyte&#8208;free process has yet to be developed. We demonstrate that such anodic coupling reactions can be performed in an all&#8208;green electrolytic system without using such additional electrolytes or HFIP, maintaining a high atom economy. This C&#8210;H functionalization strategy utilizes inexpensive sodium sulfinates and ammonium thiocyanate as sulfonylating and thiocyanating agents in an undivided cell at a constant current, using a mixture of CH3CN/H2O as solvent at room temperature. Thus, fused pyrimidin&#8208;4&#8208;ones can be selectively converted into C3&#8208;sulfonylated and &#8208;thiocyanated derivatives in moderate to good yields.</dc:description>

&#8220;It was exciting to find out that there is an acylphosphine&#8211;phosphaalkene equilibrium, and that we can intentionally increase&#8230; our yields by simply elevating the temperature.&#8221; This and more about the story behind the front cover can be found in the article at 10.1002/chem.202302535).







Abstract
Invited for the cover of this issue are the groups of M. Haas, G. Gescheidt and H. Gr&#252;tzmacher from the Graz University of Technology and the ETH Z&#252;rich. The image depicts a phosphorus mine, where the workers are acid chlorides using their shovels and red phosphorus to provide the chemicals necessary to produce novel reagents.

         <title>Living Self&#8208;Assembly of Metastable and Stable Two&#8208;Dimensional Platelets from a Single Small Molecule</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The living seeded self&#8208;assembly of metastable and stable 2D structures with uniform shapes and precise sizes can be achieved using an appropriate supersaturated level of a solution of 1 as the growth medium that can temporarily hold the almost&#8208;proceeding spontaneous nucleation. This new methodology allows the living self&#8208;assembly of small molecules to proceed in two independent steps, i.&#8201;e., the design of molecules for various crystalline structures as seeds and the application of a supersaturated solution with appropriate levels as the growth medium to grow the uniform structures with controlled sizes, thus rendering a convenient and adaptable methodology for novel architectures.







Abstract
This study reports the design of a donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) molecule with two fluorene units on each side of a benzothiadiazole moiety, which allows multiple intermolecular interactions to compete with one another so as to induce the evolution of the metastable 2D platelets to the stable 2D platelets during the self&#8208;assembly of the D&#8208;A molecule. Importantly, the living seeded self&#8208;assembly of metastable and stable 2D structures with precisely controlled sizes can be conveniently achieved using an appropriate supersaturated level of a solution of the D&#8208;A molecule as the seeded growth medium that can temporarily hold the almost&#8208;proceeding spontaneous nucleation from competing with the seeded growth. The stable 2D platelets with smaller area sizes exhibit higher sensitivity to gaseous dimethyl sulfide, illustrating that the novel living self&#8208;assembly method provides more available functional structures with controlled sizes for practical applications. The key finding of this study is that the new living methodology is separated into two independent processes: the elaborate molecular design for various crystalline structures as seeds and the application of a supersaturated solution with appropriate levels as the growth medium to grow the uniform structures with controlled sizes; this would make convenient and possible the living seeded self&#8208;assembly of rich 1D, 2D, and 3D architectures.

We report an efficient protocol to prepare sulfonyl carbamimidic azide and sulfonyl aminotetrazole via Co&#8208;catalyzed three component coupling of sulfonyl azide (acts as nitrene source), isocyanide, and TMS&#8208;azide at room temperature under visible light. The sulfonyl carbamimidic azide cyclizes in the presence of base to deliver N&#8208;sulfonyl aminotetrazole, which can also be synthesized directly without isolating the sulfonyl carbamimidic azide.







Abstract
Herein, we report an operationally simple and efficient protocol to prepare sulfonyl carbamimidic azide and N&#8208;sulfonyl aminotetrazole via Co&#8208;catalyzed three component coupling of sulfonyl azide (acts as nitrene source), isocyanide, and TMS&#8208;azide at room temperature under visible light. Initially, the carbamimidic azide is formed, which cyclizes only in the presence of base to deliver N&#8208;sulfonyl aminotetrazole in very good yields. The sulfonyl aminotetrazole can also be synthesized directly without isolating the carbamimidic azide in the presence of base. The sulfonyl azide is anticipated to generate nitrene and reacts with isocyanide to produce carbodiimide. Subsequent addition of azide (TMS&#8208;N3) to carbodiimide results in the formation of carbamimidic azide.

         <title>Interrelations between Linkage Isomers of an Efficient Square&#8208;planar Nickel(II) Nitrite Photoswitch in the Solid State</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient square&#8208;planar nitrite nickel(II) photoswitch is reported and used as a model case to study the nitro&#8208;to&#8208;nitrito isomerization mechanism in the solid state. Based on combined experimental and theoretical studies the nitro&#8594;exo&#8208;nitrito&#8594;endo&#8208;nitrito reaction pathway is proposed.







Abstract
An efficient nitrite nickel(II) photoswitch, with the 1&#8208;phenyl&#8208;2&#8208;hydroxyimino&#8208;3&#8208;[(2&#8217;&#8208;dimethylamino)ethyl]imino&#8208;1&#8208;propanone moiety used as the ancillary ligand, is reported. In the ground&#8208;state (&#8216;dark&#8217;) crystal structure, the studied compound exists predominantly as the nitro&#8208;(&#951;1&#8208;N(O)2) isomer, however, traces of the exo&#8208; and endo&#8208;nitrito&#8208;(&#951;1&#8208;ONO) forms are detected both at 100&#8197;K (4&#8211;5&#8201;% each) and under ambient conditions (~9&#8201;% each). When excited with the 405&#8211;530&#8197;nm LED light, the nitro&#8208;to&#8208;nitrito isomerization takes place. The total conversion exceeds 90&#8201;%. The exo&#8208;nitrito linkage isomer constitutes the dominant photo&#8208;generated form, whereas the relative population of both nitrito species depends on temperature. The reaction is fully reversible and reproducible. The photo&#8208;products are stable up to 200&#8197;K. The system constitutes a good model case for the reaction mechanism studies. Thus, experimental and theoretical investigations on the photo&#8208;isomerism were conducted and are presented in detail. Eventually, the nitro&#8594;exo&#8208;nitrito&#8594;endo&#8208;nitrito reaction pathway is proposed.

         <title>Capture&#8208;SELEX of DNA Aptamers for Sulforhodamine B and Fluorescein</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using the capture&#8208;SELEX method, a non&#8208;G&#8208;quadruplex DNA aptamer for sulforhodamine B (SRhB) was isolated with a Kd of 1&#8197;&#956;M. Aptamer binding induced fluorescence enhancement of SRhB. Using fluorescein as a target, the same method yielded an aptamer with a much lower affinity, suggesting that structural features of target molecules are critical for aptamer binding.







Abstract
While many dye binding aptamers have been reported, most of them were for light&#8208;up aptamers that can significantly enhance the quantum yield of fluorophores. Sulforhodamine B (SRhB) was used as a target previously to select both DNA and RNA aptamers, and the DNA aptamer was a G&#8208;quadruplex that can bind to a number of rhodamine analogs. In addition, the previous selections were performed by immobilizing the target molecules. In this work, the library immobilization method was used to respectively select aptamers for SRhB and fluorescein. The SRhB aptamer has a non&#8208;G&#8208;quadruplex structure with a Kd of 1.0&#8197;&#956;M measured from isothermal titration calorimetry. Upon titration of the aptamer, the fluorescence of SRhB increased 2.5&#8208;fold, and this aptamer does not require Mg2+ for binding. Rhodamine&#8197;B has even tighter binding suggesting binding through the xanthene moiety of the dyes. No binding was detected for fluorescein. For the fluorescein selection, a dominant aptamer sequence with a Kd of 147&#8197;&#956;M was obtained. This study provides two new aptamers for two important fluorophores that can be used to study aptamer&#8208;based separation, dye detection and catalysis. Comparison of these aptamers also provides insights into the effect of functional groups on aptamer binding.

         <title>Rational Design of a Multifunctional Benzothiadiazole Derivative in Organic Photonics and Electronics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A careful rational design of a multidonor benzothiadiazole derivative was carried out. This compound was synthesized employing microwave irradiation as energy source, that allows to increase the yields and reduce the reaction times. The desired compound showed multifunctional character with application in organic photonics as red optical waveguide and in organic electronics as p&#8208;type semiconductor in organic field&#8208;effect transistors.







Abstract
In order to achieve a multifunctional compound with potential application in organic photonics and electronics, a multidonor benzothiadiazole derivative was rationally designed and synthesized employing microwave irradiation as energy source, increasing the process efficiency about yields and reaction times in comparison with conventional conditions. This powerful compound displayed solvatochromism and showed efficient behavior as red optical waveguide with low OLC around 10&#8722;2&#8197;dB&#8201;&#956;m&#8722;1 and with the capacity of light transmission in two directions. In addition, the proposed derivative acted as efficient p&#8208;type semiconductor in organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs) with hole mobilities up 10&#8722;1&#8197;cm2&#8197;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1. This corroborates its multifunctional character, thus making it a potential candidate to be applied in hybrid organic field&#8208;effect optical waveguides (OFEWs).

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catalytic activities of Mn(I) complexes derived from expensive MnBr(CO)5 salt have been explored in various dehydrogenative transformations. However, the reactivity and selectivity of inexpensive high spin Mn(II) complexes are uncommon. Herein, we have synthesized four new Mn(II) complexes and explored switchable alkenylation and alkylation of methyl heteroarenes employing a single Mn(II)catalyst. The developed protocol selectively furnishes a series of functionalized E&#8208;heteroarenes and C&#8208;alkylated heteroarenes with good to excellent yields. Various medicinally and synthetically useful compounds are successfully synthesized using our developed protocol. Various controls and kinetics experiments were executed to shed light on the mechaism,which reveals that &#945;&#8208;C&#8208;H bond breaking of alcohol is the slowest step.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultrathin Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Nanosheets for Selective Photocatalytic C2H2 Semihydrogenation in Aqueous Solution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The selective semihydrogenation of C2H2 to C2H4 in crude C2H4 (with ~1 vol% C2H2 contamination) is a crucial process in the manufacture of polyethylene. Comparing to conventional thermalcatalytic route with Pd as catalytic under high temperature with H2 as hydrogen source, photocatalytic C2H2 reduction reaction with H2O as hydrogen source can achieve high selectivity under milder conditions, but has rarely been reported. Here, we present a kind of ultrathin metal&#8208;organic framework nanosheets (Cu&#8208;Co&#8208;MNSs) that demonstrate excellent catalytic activities in the semihydrogenation of C2H2. Employing Ru(bpy)32+ as the photosensitizer, this catalyst attains a noteworthy turnover number (TON) of 2124 for C2H4, coupled with an impressive selectivity of 99.5% after a 12 h visible light irradiation. This performance is comparable to molecular catalysts and notably surpasses the efficiency of bulk metal&#8208;organic framework materials. Furthermore, Cu&#8208;Co&#8208;MNSs achieve a 99.95% conversion of C2H2 under industrial relevant conditions (1.10% C2H2 in C2H4) with 90.3% selectivity for C2H4 over C2H6, demonstrating a great potential for polymer&#8208;grade C2H4 production.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report the synthesis of a rare bis&#8208;silylene 1 in which two silylene atoms are bridged by a Si(IV) atom.&#160; Compound 1 contains an unusual Si(II)&#8208;Si(IV)&#8208;Si(II) bonding arrangement with the Si(II)&#8208;Si(IV) bond distances of 2.4212(8) and 2.4157(7) &#197;. Treatment of 1 with Fe(CO)5 afforded a dinuclear Fe(0) complex 2 with two unusually long Si&#8211;Si bonds (2.4515(8) and 2.4488(10) &#197;). We have also carried out a detailed computational study to understand the nature of the Si&#8211;Si bonds in these compounds. The NBO (Natural bond orbital) and EDA&#8208;NOCV (energy decomposition analysis&#8208;Natural orbital for chemical valence) analyses reveal that the Si&#8208;Si bonds in 1&#8208;2 are of electron&#8208;sharing nature.</dc:description>

The unprecedented reductive&#8208;thermal rearrangements of cyclic alkyl(amino) carbene (cAAC)&#8208;supported chloro&#8208;phosphinidenes afforded two novel ligands, the (aryl)&#8208;(imino) phosphides and the (aryl)&#8208;(phosphaalkene) amide, in the form of their corresponding alkali metal complexes. The former ligand was successfully used for the stabilization and first solid&#8208;state isolation of three cyclic alkyl(amino&#8208;boryl) phosphaalkenes, and two clusters with CuI4 and AgI8 cores.

Chiral&#8208;at&#8208;metal racemization has been unraveled for MoO2(acnac)2 by using density functional theory. Nine energy minima, 13 transition structures, and all intrinsic reaction coordinates were identified. The kudu's antlers show the three sets enantiomers for cis&#8208;MoO2(acnac)2. Each antler reflects their chiral isomerization by DML twists. The horizontal lines connecting the antlers reflect chiral&#8208;at&#8208;metal racemization for each enantiomer by CH twists. More information can be found in the Research Article by K. Lammertsma and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202302516). Design by Paul&#8197;F. Lammertsma.

         <title>On the Number of &#960;&#8208;Electrons Involved in Stepwise Cycloaddition Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
All these electrons. Many recently disclosed higher&#8208;order cycloadditions utilize cycloaddends which are benzofused. Are the &#960;&#8208;electrons of the appended aromatic ring acting as &#8220;spectator electrons&#8221; in higher&#8208;order cycloadditions, or do they exert an influence on the reaction?







Abstract
The development of higher&#8208;order cycloadditions has mainly been restricted by the requisite usage of highly conjugated and reactive &#960;&#8208;systems. Recent years have witnessed organocatalysis as a potent mediator for several of the challenges associated herein, rendering higher&#8208;order cycloadditions a legitimate option for achieving the selective construction of specific molecular scaffolds. These developments reinvigorate the efforts to try to understand the underlying principles for cycloadditions involving a higher number of &#960;&#8208;electrons than the &#8220;classical&#8221; cycloadditions; how do we properly address the impact which the addition of further &#960;&#8208;electrons have on the reactivity of a system? Herein, computational investigations of two model higher&#8208;order cycloaddition systems have been performed to try to provide insights on changes in energetic barriers induced by the presence of benzofusions in a position which is unobstructive to the reactivity. With experimental substantiation as support, these studies might open up for a discussion on whether the &#960;&#8208;electrons of benzofused systems simply act as spectator electrons, or play a tangible role on the observed reactivity to an extent where a distinct nomenclature is meritable.

         <title>Electron Paramagnetic Resonance, Electronic Ground State, and Electron Spin Relaxation of Seven Lanthanide Ions Bound to Lanmodulin and the Bioinspired Chelator, 3,4,3&#8208;LI(1,2&#8208;HOPO)</title>

         <dc:description>
EPR spectroscopy has never been applied to small&#8208;molecule or protein complexes of lanthanide(III) ions besides Gd3+. Here, the EPR properties of 7 lanthanide(III) ions with the protein, lanmodulin, and the small&#8208;molecule chelator, 3,4,3&#8208;LI(1,2&#8208;HOPO), are investigated. The study shows differences in spectrum and relaxation properties that are dependent on both metal ion and coordination and motivates wider investigation of the EPR of lanthanides.







Abstract
The electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra of lanthanide(III) ions besides Gd3+, bound to small&#8208;molecule and protein chelators, are uncharacterized. Here, the EPR properties of 7 lanthanide(III) ions bound to the natural lanthanide&#8208;binding protein, lanmodulin (LanM), and the synthetic small&#8208;molecule chelator, 3,4,3&#8208;LI(1,2&#8208;HOPO) (&#8220;HOPO&#8221;), were systematically investigated. Echo&#8208;detected pulsed EPR spectra reveal intense signals from ions for which the normal continuous&#8208;wave first&#8208;derivative spectra are negligibly different from zero. Spectra of Kramers lanthanide ions Ce3+, Nd3+, Sm3+, Er3+, and Yb3+, and non&#8208;Kramers Tb3+ and Tm3+, bound to LanM are more similar to the ions in dilute aqueous:ethanol solution than to those coordinated with HOPO. Lanmodulins from two bacteria, with distinct metal&#8208;binding sites, had similar spectra for Tb3+ but different spectra for Nd3+. Spin echo dephasing rates (1/Tm) are faster for lanthanides than for most transition metals and limited detection of echoes to temperatures below ~6 to 12&#8197;K. Dephasing rates were environment dependent and decreased in the order water:ethanol&gt;LanM&gt;HOPO, which is attributed to decreasing librational motion. These results demonstrate that the EPR spectra and relaxation times of lanthanide(III) ions are sensitive to coordination environment, motivating wider application of these methods for characterization of both small&#8208;molecule and biomolecule interactions with lanthanides.

         <title>Functionalization of Dodecaborates by Mild and Efficient Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Formation of B&#8722;C Bonds with Boronic Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The toolbox is full of boronic acids for Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling. To connect them to the dodecaborate cluster, special tools are necessary: iodine as leaving group on the dodecaborate, DavePhos as special ligand, and solvents that differ for electron&#8208;rich and electron&#8208;poor boronic acids. With these tools, the coupling can be carried out successfully. More information can be found in the Research Article by D. Gabel and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202302466).

         <title>Transformation of Highly Hydrophobic Triarylphosphines into Amphiphiles via Staudinger Reaction with Hydrophilic Trichlorophenyl Azide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A straightforward transformation of highly hydrophobic triarylphosphines into amphiphiles via the Staudinger reaction with a hydrophilic trichlorophenyl azide is reported. The obtained amphiphiles were remarkably water&#8208;soluble, enabling their spontaneous self&#8208;assembly into 2&#8197;nm&#8208;sized micelles composed of 4&#8211;5 molecules in water. An amphiphile having a large hydrophobic surface solubilized various hydrophobic organic dyes in water.







Abstract
Owing to its hydrophobic properties and reactivity, triarylphosphines (PAr3) are promising precursors for the development of new amphiphiles. However, an efficient and reliable synthetic method for amphiphiles based on highly hydrophobic PAr3 is still required. Herein, a straightforward transformation of highly hydrophobic PAr3 into amphiphiles via the Staudinger reaction is reported. By simply mixing PAr3 and a hydrophilic trichlorophenyl azide containing two hydrophilic chains, amphiphiles bearing a N=P bond (i.&#8201;e., an azaylide moiety) were quantitatively formed. The obtained azaylide&#8208;based amphiphiles were remarkably water&#8208;soluble, enabling their spontaneous self&#8208;assembly into 2&#8197;nm&#8208;sized micelles composed of 4&#8211;5 molecules in water with a low critical micelle concentration (up to 0.05&#8197;mM or less) due to the effective intermolecular interactions among the hydrophobic surfaces. Although the azaylide moiety is easily hydrolyzed in the presence of water, the azaylide in the amphiphiles displayed notable stability in water even at 60&#8197;h, which stems from the LUMO modulation induced by the presence of three electron&#8208;withdrawing chloro groups and two twisted alkoxycarbonyl groups, according to DFT calculations. An amphiphile having a large hydrophobic surface solubilized various hydrophobic organic dyes through efficient intermolecular interactions, resulting in the dyes exhibiting either monomer or excimer emissions in water.

         <title>Nitrene C&#8722;H Bond Insertion Approach to Carbazolones and Indolones, and a Reactivity Departure for 7&#8208;Membered Analogues
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2&#8208;Arylcyclohexane&#8208;1,3&#8208;diones and 2&#8208;arylcyclopentane&#8208;1,3&#8208;diones can be converted in a facile 2&#8208;step, 1&#8208;pot manner to 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;3&#8208;azidocycloalk&#8208;2&#8208;en&#8208;1&#8208;ones. These azides can be smoothly cyclized to carbazolones and indolones with catalytic Rh2(O2CC7H15)4. Although 3&#8208;azido&#8208;2&#8208;phenylcyclohept&#8208;2&#8208;en&#8208;1&#8208;one could be readily prepared from 2&#8208;phenylcycloheptane&#8208;1,3&#8208;dione, by contrast the Rh&#8208;catalyzed cyclization gave an azirine in preference to the indole. Mechanistic and DFT studies complement the synthetic work.







Abstract
A modular platform for facile access to 1,2,3,9&#8208;tetrahydro&#8208;4H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;4&#8208;ones (H4&#8208;carbazolones) and 3,4&#8208;dihydrocyclopenta[b]indol&#8208;1(2H)&#8208;ones (H2&#8208;indolones) is described. The requisite 6&#8208; and 5&#8208;membered 2&#8208;arylcycloalkane&#8208;1,3&#8208;dione precursors were readily obtained through a Cu&#8208;catalyzed arylation of 1,3&#8208;cyclohexanediones or by a ring expansion of aryl succinoin derivatives. Enolization of one carbonyl group in the diones, conversion to a leaving group, and subsequent azidation gave 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;3&#8208;azidocycloalk&#8208;2&#8208;en&#8208;1&#8208;ones. This two&#8208;step, one&#8208;pot azidation is highly regioselective with unsymmetrically substituted 2&#8208;arylcyclohexane&#8208;1,3&#8208;diones. The regioselectivity, which is important for access to single isomers of 3,3&#8208;disubstituted carbazolones, was analyzed mechanistically and computationally. Finally, a Rh&#8208;catalyzed nitrene/nitrenoid insertion into the ortho C&#8722;H bond of the aryl moiety gave the H4&#8208;carbazolones and H2&#8208;indolones. One carbazolone was elaborated to an intermediate reported in the total synthesis of N&#8208;decarbomethoxychanofruticosinate, (&#8722;)&#8208;aspidospermidine, (+)&#8208;kopsihainanine A. With 2&#8208;phenylcycloheptane&#8208;1,3&#8208;dione, prepared from cyclohexanone and benzaldehyde, the azidation reaction was readily accomplished. However, the Rh&#8208;catalyzed reaction unexpectedly led to a labile but characterizable azirine rather than the indole derivative. Computations were performed to understand the differences in reactivities of the 5&#8208; and 6&#8208;membered 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;3&#8208;azidocycloalk&#8208;2&#8208;en&#8208;1&#8208;ones in comparison to the 7&#8208;membered analogue, and to support the structural assignment of the azirine.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2-Arylcyclohexane-1,3-diones&lt;/b&gt; and 2-arylcyclopentane-1,3-diones can be converted in a facile 2-step, 1-pot manner to 2-aryl-3-azidocycloalk-2-en-1-ones. These azides can be smoothly cyclized to carbazolones and indolones with catalytic Rh&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CC&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;15&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. Although 3-azido-2-phenylcyclohept-2-en-1-one could be readily prepared from 2-phenylcycloheptane-1,3-dione, by contrast the Rh-catalyzed cyclization gave an azirine in preference to the indole. Mechanistic and DFT studies complement the synthetic work.

         <title>Reductive Coupling of a Diazoalkane Derivative Promoted by a Potassium Aluminyl and Elimination of Dinitrogen to Generate a Reactive Aluminium Ketimide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The potassium aluminyl K[Al(NON)] reductively couples 9&#8208;diazo&#8208;9H&#8208;fluorene (fluN2) to generate a highly coloured species containing the [fluNNNNflu]2&#8722; ligand. Thermal elimination of N2 and loss of doubly reduced 1,2&#8208;di(9H&#8208;fluoren&#8208;9&#8208;yl)diazene [fluN=Nflu]2&#8722; as the potassium salt generates a neutral aluminium ketimide, which undergoes cycloaddition and hydrogen transfer to form the corresponding guanidinate complex.







Abstract
The reaction of 9&#8208;diazo&#8208;9H&#8208;fluorene (fluN2) with the potassium aluminyl K[Al(NON)] ([NON]2&#8722;=[O(SiMe2NDipp)2]2&#8722;, Dipp=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3) affords K[Al(NON)(&#954;N1,N3&#8208;{(fluN2)2})] (1). Structural analysis shows a near planar 1,4&#8208;di(9H&#8208;fluoren&#8208;9&#8208;ylidene)tetraazadiide ligand that chelates to the aluminium. The thermally induced elimination of dinitrogen from 1 affords the neutral aluminium ketimide complex, Al(NON)(N=flu)(THF) (2) and the 1,2&#8208;di(9H&#8208;fluoren&#8208;9&#8208;yl)diazene dianion as the potassium salt, [K2(THF)3][fluN=Nflu] (3). The reaction of 2 with N,N&#8217;&#8208;diisopropylcarbodiimide (iPrN=C=NiPr) affords the aluminium guanidinate complex, Al(NON){N(iPr)C(N=CMe2)N(CHflu)} (4), showing a rare example of reactivity at a metal ketimide ligand. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations have been used to examine the bonding in the newly formed [(fluN2)2]2&#8722; ligand in 1 and the ketimide bonding in 2. The mechanism leading to the formation of 4 has also been studied using this technique.

Bartering a halide for two electrons: We describe the first halide&#8208;coupled double electron transfer reactions between a diborane and an organic substrate, leading to diborylated dienamines.







Abstract
The ditriflato&#8208;diborane B2(&#956;&#8208;hpp)2(OTf)2 (hpp=1,3,4,6,7,8&#8208;hexahydro&#8208;2H&#8208;pyrimido[1,2&#8208;a]pyrimidinate) acts as a stable surrogate of the elusive dication [B2(hpp)2]2+, being both electrophilic (vacant boron p orbitals) and nucleophilic (filled B&#8722;B bond orbital). This combination of seemingly contrasting behaviors could be used to develop a metallomimetic diborane chemistry, with Lewis &#963;&#8208;basic and &#960;&#8208;acidic substrates being bound and reduced at the diborane. Here, we report on a novel reaction type within this general theme, in which double electron transfer from the diboron unit to the boron&#8211;bound organic substrate is coupled with halide transfer in the other direction. Novel diborylated dienamines are synthesized in this way. The scope of this unprecedented reaction motif and the reaction pathways are elucidated.

         <title>Transforming Hetera&#8208;Buckybowls into Chiral Conjugated Polycycles Incorporating Epoxycyclooctadiene: a Two&#8208;Step Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we present a novel approach to synthesize chiral &#960;&#8208;conjugated polycycles incorporating the epoxycyclooctadiene moiety, a key fragment found in the natural products. Our synthetic strategy capitalizes on innovative reactions involving hetera&#8208;buckybowl triselenasumanene (TSS) and is achieved through a concise two&#8208;step process.







Abstract
Chiral &#960;&#8208;conjugated polycycles have garnered increasing attention due to versatile applications in optoelectronic materials and biological sciences. In this study, we report the synthesis of chiral &#960;&#8208;conjugated polycycles incorporating a chiral epoxycyclooctadiene moiety. Our synthetic strategy capitalizes on the novel reactions of hetera&#8208;buckybowl triselenasumanene (TSS) and is achieved in two&#8208;step manner. Firstly, the TSS is regio&#8208;selectively transformed into its ortho&#8208;quinone form. Subsequently, the nucleophilic addition reactions of TSS ortho&#8208;quinone by phenylethynides are metal ion&#8208;dependent. When utilizing (phenylethynyl)magnesium bromide as the nucleophile, two phenylethynyls are furnished onto the edged benzene ring of TSS. When the nucleophile is (phenylethynyl)lithium, a cascade of nucleophilic addition, intermolecular electron&#8208;transfer, ring&#8208;opening, and tetradehydro&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder (TDDA) reactions occur sequentially in one&#8208;pot, ultimately affording chiral &#960;&#8208;conjugated polycycles featuring the epoxycyclooctadiene moiety as an integral part of their backbones. This work represents a step forward in the synthesis of chiral &#960;&#8208;conjugated polycycles using TSS as synthon.

         <title>Anion Tuned Structural Modulation and Nonlinear Optical Effects of Metal&#8208;Ion Directed 310&#8208;Helix Networks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The utility of short tripeptide 310&#8208;helices with terminal pyridyl groups was demonstrated in constructing diverse silver&#8208;coordinated networks. Further, the non&#8208;linear optical effects of these silver coordinated peptide networks was studied.







Abstract
Metals play an important role in the structure and functions of various proteins. The combination of metal ions and peptides have been emerging as an attractive field to create advanced structures and biomaterials. Here, we are reporting the anion&#8208;influenced, silver ion coordinated diverse networks of designed short tripeptide 310&#8208;helices with terminal pyridyl groups. The short peptides adopted classical right&#8208;handed, left&#8208;handed and 310EL&#8208;helical conformations in the presence of different silver salts. The peptides have displayed conformational flexibility to accommodate different sizes and interactions of anions to yield a variety of metal&#8208;coordinated networks. The complexes of metal ions and peptides have shown different porous networks, right&#8208; and left&#8208;handed helical polymers, transformation of helix into superhelix and 2&#8201;:&#8201;2 metal&#8208;peptide macrocycles. Further, the metal&#8208;peptide crystals with inherent dipoles of helical peptides gave striking second harmonic generation response. The optical energy upconversion from NIR to red and green light is demonstrated. Overall, we have shown the utilization of short 310&#8208;helices for the construction of diverse metal&#8208;coordinated helical networks and notable non&#8208;linear optical effects.

         <title>J&#8208;Aggregate&#8208;Triggering BODIPYs: an Ultrasensitive Chromogenic and Fluorogenic Sensing Platform for Perfluorooctanesulfonate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Per&#8208; and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are chemicals that bioaccumulate and resist degradation, posing serious threats to health and the environment. Current analytical methods are ill&#8208;suited for the rapid visual detection of point sources of contamination in the field. Here, a simple, rapid, and highly sensitive chromogenic and fluorogenic &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; sensor is reported that can detect and remove PFASs from contaminated water with high efficiency.







Abstract
Contamination of water supplies by polyfluoroalkyl substances, notably perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), has serious health and environmental consequences. Therefore, the development of straightforward and effective means of monitoring and removing PFASs is urgently required. In this study, we report a rapid and sensitive method for the detection of PFOS and PFOA in water that rely on the J&#8208;aggregate formation of meso&#8208;ester&#8208;BODIPY dyes. The dye C10&#8208;mim, which contains a hydrophilic methylimidazolium group and a hydrophobic alkylated BODIPY, self&#8208;assembles in water into weakly green&#8208;emissive micellar assemblies. Upon binding to PFOS or PFOA, a spontaneous disassembly and reorganization forms orange&#8208;emissive J&#8208;aggregates. The rapid formation (&#8804;5&#8197;s) of J&#8208;aggregates and the accompanying spectral shifts provide a superior sensing performance, with excellent sensitivity (limit of detection=0.18&#8197;ppb for PFOS) and distinct chromogenic and fluorogenic &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; responses.

         <dc:description>Magnetic refrigeration technology based on Gd&#8208;based paramagnets is expected to be applied to refrigeration in extremely low temperatures, thereby reducing the consumption of liquid helium. Here, we obtained a compound, Gd3TeBO9 with high Gd3+ concentration through element substitution. The Gd3+ concentration in this compound is as high as 2.4&#215;1024 ions/kg, which is 33% higher than the commercial Gd3Ga5O12 (GGG), and further magnetic tests show that Gd3TeBO9 has a large magnetic entropy change (57.44 J/(kg K) and 408 mJ/(cm3 K) at 2.6 K and 7 T), which is 1.5 times that of GGG, implying the possibility of its further development as an potential magnetocaloric material.</dc:description>

         <title>Exploring the Multifarious Role of the Ligand in Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution Reaction Pathways</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent years have seen an emerging interest in the scientific world to exploring the multifaceted properties of redox&#8208;active ligands towards the design and synthesis of robust and efficient molecular electrocatalysts exhibiting HER. This Review highlights the role of metal&#8211;ligand cooperativity on mechanistic pathways utilizing 3d transition metal&#8208;based complexes.







Abstract
In recent years, researchers have shifted their focus towards investigating the redox properties of ancillary ligand backbones for small&#8208;molecule activation. Several metal complexes have been reported for the electrocatalytic H2 evolution reaction (HER), providing valuable mechanistic insights. This process involves efficient coupling of electrons and protons. Redox&#8208;active ligands stipulate internal electron transfer and promote effective orbital overlap between metal and ligand, thereby, enabling efficient proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer reactions. Understanding such catalytic mechanisms requires thorough spectroscopic and computational analyses. Herein, we summarize recent examples of molecular electrocatalysts based on 3d transition metals that have significantly influenced mechanistic pathways, thus, emphasizing the multifaceted role of metal&#8211;ligand cooperativity.

         <title>HER&#8208;2&#8208;Targeted Boron Neutron Capture Therapy with Carborane&#8208;integrated Immunoliposomes Prepared via an Exchanging Reaction</title>

Carborane integrated immunoliposome was prepared by host exchanging reaction as a boron agent for BNCT.







Abstract
Boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) is a promising modality for cancer treatment because of its minimal invasiveness. To maximize the therapeutic benefits of BNCT, the development of efficient platforms for the delivery of boron agents is indispensable. Here, carborane&#8208;integrated immunoliposomes were prepared via an exchanging reaction to achieve HER&#8208;2&#8208;targeted BNCT. The conjugation of an anti&#8208;HER&#8208;2 antibody to carborane&#8208;integrated liposomes successfully endowed these liposomes with targeting properties toward HER&#8208;2&#8208;overexpressing human ovarian cancer cells (SK&#8208;OV3); the resulting BNCT activity toward SK&#8208;OV3 cells obtained using the current immunoliposomal system was 14&#8208;fold that of the l&#8208;BPA/fructose complex, which is a clinically available boron agent. Moreover, the growth of spheroids treated with this system followed by thermal neutron irradiation was significantly suppressed compared with treatment with the l&#8208;BPA/fructose complex.

         <title>Differentiating between Label and Protein Conformers in Pulsed Dipolar EPR Spectroscopy with the dHis&#8208;Cu2+(NTA) Motif</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Keeping on the straight and narrow: The dHis&#8208;Cu2+(NTA) motif does not require a histidine&#8208;null background construct and enables label and protein conformers to be differentiated in pulsed dipolar EPR experiments. Here, we show that &#945;&#8208;helix 14 of YopO adopts only a straight conformation in the absence of actin.







Abstract
Pulsed dipolar EPR spectroscopy (PDS) in combination with site&#8208;directed spin labeling is a powerful tool in structural biology. However, the commonly used spin labels are conjugated to biomolecules via rather long and flexible linkers, which hampers the translation of distance distributions into biomolecular conformations. In contrast, the spin label copper(II)&#8208;nitrilotriacetic acid [Cu2+(NTA)] bound to two histidines (dHis) is rigid and yields narrow distance distributions, which can be more easily translated into biomolecular conformations. Here, we use this label on the 71&#8197;kDa Yersinia outer protein O (YopO) to decipher whether a previously experimentally observed bimodal distance distribution is due to two conformations of the biomolecule or of the flexible spin labels. Two different PDS experiments, that is, pulsed electron&#8211;electron double resonance (PELDOR aka DEER) and relaxation&#8208;induced dipolar modulation enhancement (RIDME), yield unimodal distance distribution with the dHis&#8208;Cu2+(NTA) motif; this result suggests that the &#945;&#8208;helical backbone of YopO adopts a single conformation in frozen solution. In addition, we show that the Cu2+(NTA) label preferentially binds to the target double histidine (dHis) sites even in the presence of 22 competing native histidine residues. Our results therefore suggest that the generation of a His&#8208;null background is not required for this spin labeling methodology. Together these results highlight the value of the dHis&#8208;Cu2+(NTA) motif in PDS experiments.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Keeping on the straight and narrow&lt;/b&gt;: The dHis-Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;(NTA) motif does not require a histidine-null background construct and enables label and protein conformers to be differentiated in pulsed dipolar EPR experiments. Here, we show that &#945;-helix 14 of YopO adopts only a straight conformation in the absence of actin.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pulsed dipolar EPR spectroscopy (PDS) in combination with site-directed spin labeling is a powerful tool in structural biology. However, the commonly used spin labels are conjugated to biomolecules via rather long and flexible linkers, which hampers the translation of distance distributions into biomolecular conformations. In contrast, the spin label copper(II)-nitrilotriacetic acid [Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;(NTA)] bound to two histidines (dHis) is rigid and yields narrow distance distributions, which can be more easily translated into biomolecular conformations. Here, we use this label on the 71&#8197;kDa &lt;i&gt;Yersinia&lt;/i&gt; outer protein O (YopO) to decipher whether a previously experimentally observed bimodal distance distribution is due to two conformations of the biomolecule or of the flexible spin labels. Two different PDS experiments, that is, pulsed electron&#8211;electron double resonance (PELDOR aka DEER) and relaxation-induced dipolar modulation enhancement (RIDME), yield unimodal distance distribution with the dHis-Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;(NTA) motif; this result suggests that the &#945;-helical backbone of YopO adopts a single conformation in frozen solution. In addition, we show that the Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;(NTA) label preferentially binds to the target double histidine (dHis) sites even in the presence of 22 competing native histidine residues. Our results therefore suggest that the generation of a His-null background is not required for this spin labeling methodology. Together these results highlight the value of the dHis-Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;(NTA) motif in PDS experiments.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthetic Strategies of N&#8208;Heterocyclic Olefin (NHOs) and Their Recent Application of Organocatalytic Reactions and Beyond</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;heterocyclic olefins (NHO) properties, synthetic methods, and applications are the main topics of this review work. In contrast to the NHC catalyst, NHOs, a recently identified class of electron&#8208;rich, polar alkene, exhibit important characteristics including strong basicity, high nucleophilicity, and high donating tendency. In addition, we comprehend their chemical reactivity and selectivity, and summarised the majority of organic synthesis processes, such as asymmetric catalysis, hydroborylation, hydrosilylation, reduction, CO2 sequestration, polymerisation, alkylation, etc.







Abstract
N&#8208;heterocyclic olefin (NHO) derivatives have an electron&#8208;rich as well as highly polarized carabon&#8208;carbon (C=C) double bond because of the electron&#8208;donating nature of nitrogen and sulphur atoms. While NHOs have been developing as novel organocatalysts and ligands for transition&#8208;metal complexes in various organic compound syntheses, different research groups are currently interested in preparing imidazole and triazolium&#8208;based chiral NHO catalysts. Some of them have been used for enantioselective organic transformations, but were still elusive. N&#8208;heterocyclic olefins, the alkylidene derivatives of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHC), have shown promising results as effective promoters for numerous organic syntheses such as asymmetric catalysis, hydroborylation, hydrosilylation, reduction, CO2 sequestration, alkylation, cycloaddition, polymerization and the ring&#8208;opening reaction of aziridine and epoxides, esterification, C&#8722;F bond functionalization, amine coupling, trifluoromethyl thiolation, amination etc. NHOs catalysts with suitable structures can serve as a novel class of Lewis/Bronsted bases with strong basicity and high nucleophilicity properties.These facts strongly suggest their enormous chemical potential as sustainable catalysts for a wide variety of reactions in synthetic chemistry. The synthesis of NHOs and their properties are briefly reviewed in this article, along with a summary of the imidazole and triazole core of NHOs&#8242; most recent catalytic uses.

         <title>Charge Transfer in Be&#8722;Ru Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Be7Ru4 and Be12Ru7 are novel structural prototypes featuring an inhomogeneous 2D intergrowth of Fe2P&#8208; and U3Si2&#8208;type motifs. Chemical bonding analysis reveals the presence of polar multi&#8208;atomic bonds and charge transfer. Topological analysis of electron density in the Be&#8722;Ru compounds demonstrates non&#8208;linear change in the atomic volumina and complex variation of QTAIM atomic charges with composition.







Abstract
During the investigation of the binary system Be&#8722;Ru two new phases &#8211; Be7Ru4 and Be12Ru7 &#8211; with similar compositions (63.6 at. % Be and 63.2 at. % Be, respectively), are discovered. They both represent new structural prototypes. The phases are located between Be2Ru (Fe2P&#8208;type structure) and Be3Ru2 (U3Si2&#8208;type structure) in the phase diagram. This explains why their crystal structures, solved and refined from single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction data, are described as 2D intergrowth of Fe2P and U3Si2 motives. The calculated electronic density of stats (DOS) reveals pronounced minima in the vicinity of the Fermi level for both compounds. Position&#8208;space analysis of chemical bonding exhibits the formation of three&#8208; and four&#8208;atomic polar bonds, involving both, Ru and Be, atoms, and a strong charge transfer from Be to the more electronegative Ru.

         <title>Synthesis and Properties of Boron&#8208;Containing Heteromerous Bistricyclic Aromatic Enes: Structural Effects on Thermodynamic Stability and Photoreactivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Overcrowded bistricyclic aromatic enes (BAEs) are compounds that exhibit various conformational isomers. In this study, heteromerous BAEs were synthesized by incorporating different tricyclic structures into a homomerous boron&#8208;containing BAE. The thermodynamic stability of the heteromerous BAEs could be modulated by the flexibility of the introduced structures. Additionally, photoreactivity was observed, resulting in the preparation of compounds with helicity.







Abstract
Overcrowded bistricyclic aromatic enes (BAEs) have several conformations such as twisted and anti&#8208;folded conformers, and their stereochemistry and chromism have been studied in earnest. In this study, boron&#8208;containing heteromerous BAEs having various tricyclic structures were synthesized and their photophysical properties investigated. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis revealed that the introduction of a rigid fluorene unit resulted in a twisted conformer, whereas the introduction of flexible units such as thioxanthene and 9,9&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;9,10&#8208;dihydroanthracene units resulted in an anti&#8208;folded conformer. The absorption spectra of the heteromerous BAEs were dependent on the introduced tricyclic structures, suggesting the immense impact of the tricyclic structures on the electronic structures of BAEs. DFT calculations revealed the large effect of the flexibility of the tricyclic structures on the thermodynamic stability of the conformers. In addition, the boron&#8208;containing heteromerous BAEs underwent photocyclization reactions, indicating their potential application as precursors of polyaromatic hydrocarbons and helical aromatic materials.

         <title>Direct Spectroscopic Identification of BN&#8208;Arynes and Subtle Steric Effects on Nitrogen Fixation
</title>

         <dc:description>
The unstable 9&#8208;azido&#8208;9&#8208;borafluorene is successfully studied via matrix isolation, employing its pyridine adduct as a precursor for sublimation. A photoinduced isomerization process leads to the formation of the unique Lewis acid&#8208;base adduct between the BN&#8208;aryne and dinitrogen. Introduction of tert&#8208;Bu groups on the other hand reduces reactivity, effectively preventing N2 fixation.







Abstract
1,2&#8208;Azaborinines are the BN analogues of arynes through exchange of the formal CC triple bond by an isoelectronic BN bond. The BN&#8208;arynes are an underexplored class of reactive intermediates. Dibenzo[c,e][1,2]azaborinine (10,9&#8208;BN&#8208;phenanthryne) 1 was inferred as reactive intermediate by trapping reactions. Here it is shown that 1 can be generated in the gas phase by thermolysis from the pyridine adduct of 9&#8208;azido&#8208;9&#8208;borafluorene by cleavage of the dative bond with pyridine and dinitrogen extrusion. The ionization potential of 1 is 8.2&#8197;eV with ionization resulting from the &#960; HOMO. Under cryogenic matrix isolation conditions, 9&#8208;azido&#8208;9&#8208;borafluorene photolysis results in isomerization to the dinitrogen adduct of 1 without involvement of a triplet borylnitrene intermediate. Photochemical nitrogen extrusion from 1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;N2 is not possible and nitrogen fixation is irreversible under cryogenic conditions. In contrast, 2,4,7,9&#8208;tetra&#8208;tert&#8208;butyldibenzo[c,e][1,2]azaborinine can be photogenerated from the corresponding azidoborole precursor under cryogenic matrix isolation conditions, and nitrogen fixation is precluded due to steric hindrance. The BN stretching vibration at about 1750&#8197;cm&#8722;1 is much weaker than in typical linear diaryl iminoboranes.

Under cryogenic matrix isolation conditions, 9-azido-9-borafluorene photolysis results in isomerization to the dinitrogen adduct of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; without involvement of a triplet borylnitrene intermediate. Photochemical nitrogen extrusion from &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is not possible and nitrogen fixation is irreversible under cryogenic conditions. In contrast, 2,4,7,9-tetra-&lt;i&gt;tert&lt;/i&gt;-butyldibenzo[c,e][1,2]azaborinine can be photogenerated from the corresponding azidoborole precursor under cryogenic matrix isolation conditions, and nitrogen fixation is precluded due to steric hindrance. The BN stretching vibration at about 1750&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; is much weaker than in typical linear diaryl iminoboranes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Molecules that Turn Themselves Inside&#8208;Out: Tuning in/out Equilibria and Homeomorphic Isomerization in Macrobicyclic Dibridgehead Diphosphines P((CH2)n)3P Newly Accessible by Earth&#8208;Abundant&#8208;Metal Templates</title>

It&#8242;s not sorcery. Certain molecules can turn themselves inside out, akin to many articles of clothing, thus displaying two distinct external surfaces. Rates and equilibria for the title diphosphines, as well as greatly improved syntheses, are described. This provides the first in&#8208;depth mapping of such phenomena as a function of ring size for any series of aliphatic macrobicyclic compounds XE((CH2)n)3EX.







Abstract
Photolyses of trans&#8208;Fe(CO)3(P((CH2)n)3P) (n=10 (a), 12 (b), 14 (c), 16 (d), 18 (e)) in the presence of PMe3 provide the first economical and scalable route to macrobicyclic dibridgehead diphosphines P((CH2)n)3P (1). These are isolated as mixtures of in,in/out,out isomers that equilibrate with degenerate in,out/out,in isomers at 150&#8201;&#176;C via pyramidal inversion at phosphorus. For the entire series, VT 31P NMR data establish or bound Keq, rates, and activation parameters for a variety of phenomena, many of which involve homeomorphic isomerizations, topological processes by which certain molecules can turn themselves inside out (e.&#8201;g., in,in&#8652;out,out). This provides the first detailed mapping of such trends in homologous series of aliphatic bicyclic compounds XE((CH2)n)3EX with any type of bridgehead. Isomeric diborane adducts 1&#8201;a,d&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2BH3 are also characterized. Crystal structures of out,out&#8208;1&#8201;a and in,in&#8208;1&#8201;a&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2BH3 aid isomer assignments and reveal unusual cage conformations.

         <title>Harnessing the Peterson Reaction for the Stereospecific Synthesis of Z&#8208;Vinyl Ethers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Near exclusive formation of a Z vinyl ether: A variant of the Peterson reaction generates Z vinyl ethers of the type RCH=CHOR&#8217; with very high stereoselectivity, a functionality found in natural plasmalogens. (R,R)/(S,S)&#8208;1&#8208;alkoxy&#8208;2&#8208;hydroxyalkylsilanes, obtained from terminal alkynes, via 2&#8208;trimethylsilyl&#8208;3&#8208;substituted epoxides by regioselective, BF3&#8208;catalysed epoxide ring opening with an alcohol, were treated with KH in &#945;,&#945;,&#945;&#8208;trifluorotoluene to give Z vinyl ethers (Z/E ratio: 99&#8201;:&#8201;1).







Abstract
Vinyl ethers are valuable synthetic intermediates which are also found as natural products, including aflatoxins, rifamycins and plasmalogens. The latter are ubiquitous phospholipids in human cells and contain a vinyl ether moiety with specifically Z configuration. Although numerous methods are available for synthesis of vinyl ethers, there is a lack of methods for obtaining Z isomers of molecules of the type RCH=CHOR&#8217; that are applicable to plasmalogens. A variant of the Peterson reaction is described that generates such molecules with very high stereoselectivity (Z/E ratio: 99&#8201;:&#8201;1). (R,R)/(S,S)&#8208;1&#8208;alkoxy&#8208;2&#8208;hydroxyalkylsilanes were synthesized from 1&#8208;trimethylsilylalkynes by a sequence of reduction with di&#8208;isobutylaluminium hydride to a (Z)&#8208;1&#8208;trimethylsilylalkene, epoxidation of the alkene to a 2&#8208;trimethylsilyl&#8208;3&#8208;substituted epoxide and regioselective, boron&#8208;trifluoride catalyzed ring&#8208;opening of the epoxide by reaction with an alcohol. Conversion of the (R,R)/(S,S)&#8208;1&#8208;alkoxy&#8208;2&#8208;hydroxyalkylsilanes to vinyl ethers (RCH=CHOR&#8217;) was achieved under basic conditions as in a standard Peterson reaction. However, near exclusive formation of a Z vinyl ether was only achieved when the reaction was performed using potassium hydride in the non&#8208;polar solvent &#945;,&#945;,&#945;&#8208;trifluorotoluene, more polar solvents giving increasing amounts of the E isomer. The sequence described embraces a variety of substituents and precursors, proceeds in overall high yield and is readily scalable.

         <title>A Methoxylation&#8208;Promoted CPET Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A methoxylation reaction at the ligand backbone promoting a CPET reaction oxidizing central metal ion has been disclosed. Notably, the demethoxylation induced reduction has also been realized. Hither&#8208;to&#8208;unknown such reactions have been achieved on a cobalt(II) high spin complex containing a redox non&#8208;innocent 1,4&#8208;naphthoquinone derivative.







Abstract
The manuscript discloses a methoxylation reaction to an aromatic carbonyl function that carries out a CPET reaction oxidizing a transition metal ion. Spontaneous methoxylation of a redox non&#8208;innocent fragment coordinated to a high spin cobalt(II) ion, promoted concerted proton electron transfer (CPET) reaction oxidizing cobalt(II) to cobalt(III) in air and subsequent demethoxylation induced reduction of cobalt(III) to cobalt(II) producing H2O2 are authenticated. The cobalt(III)/cobalt(II) electron transfer (ET) potential of the designed complex in CH2Cl2 is &#8722;0.27&#8197;V vs Fc+/Fc redox couple. However, in presence of MeOH the reduction potential decreases to &#8722;1.02&#8197;V due to CPET involving MeOH proton. In CH2Cl2/CHCl3 spontaneous demethoxylation occurs giving back the original complex and reactive methoxyl radical that reacts with O2 producing H2O2. Overall one molecule of MeOH produces one molecule of H2O2. To analyze the involvement of the proton, the rate constants of the CPET reactions in CH2Cl2&#8208;MeOH (2&#8201;:&#8201;1) and CH2Cl2&#8208;CD3OD (2&#8201;:&#8201;1) and the demethoxylation reaction in CHCl3 at 330&#8197;K were determined by time drive UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy.

         <title>A Prato Tour on Carbon Nanotubes: Raman Insights</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The functionalisation of carbon nanotubes using Prato reaction and diazonium&#8208;based radical addition has been studied. The results support the idea that data obtained by Raman spectroscopy are only helpful for comparing functionalisations produced using the same type of reaction. However, they should be carefully analysed when comparing different reaction types.







Abstract
The functionalisation of carbon nanotubes has been instrumental in broadening its application field, allowing especially its use in biological studies. Although numerous covalent and non&#8208;covalent functionalisation methods have been described, the characterisation of the final materials has always been an added challenge. Among the various techniques available, Raman spectroscopy is one of the most widely used to determine the covalent functionalisation of these species. However, Raman spectroscopy is not a quantitative technique, and no studies are reported comparing its performance when the same number of functional groups are added but using completely different reactions. In this work, we have experimentally and theoretically studied the functionalisation of carbon nanotubes using two of the most commonly used reactions: 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition of azomethylene ylides and diazonium&#8208;based radical addition. The number of groups introduced onto the tubes by these reactions has been determined by different characterisation techniques. The results of this study support the idea that data obtained by Raman spectra are only helpful for comparing functionalisations produced using the same type of reaction. However, they should be carefully analysed when comparing functionalisations produced using different reaction types.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The functionalisation of carbon nanotubes&lt;/b&gt; using Prato reaction and diazonium-based radical addition has been studied. The results support the idea that data obtained by Raman spectroscopy are only helpful for comparing functionalisations produced using the same type of reaction. However, they should be carefully analysed when comparing different reaction types.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The functionalisation of carbon nanotubes has been instrumental in broadening its application field, allowing especially its use in biological studies. Although numerous covalent and non-covalent functionalisation methods have been described, the characterisation of the final materials has always been an added challenge. Among the various techniques available, Raman spectroscopy is one of the most widely used to determine the covalent functionalisation of these species. However, Raman spectroscopy is not a quantitative technique, and no studies are reported comparing its performance when the same number of functional groups are added but using completely different reactions. In this work, we have experimentally and theoretically studied the functionalisation of carbon nanotubes using two of the most commonly used reactions: 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of azomethylene ylides and diazonium-based radical addition. The number of groups introduced onto the tubes by these reactions has been determined by different characterisation techniques. The results of this study support the idea that data obtained by Raman spectra are only helpful for comparing functionalisations produced using the same type of reaction. However, they should be carefully analysed when comparing functionalisations produced using different reaction types.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Multi&#8208;Pyridine&#8208;Anchored and &#8208;Linked Bilayer Photocathode for Water Reduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
NiO Substrate &amp; Co. A photocathode has been prepared by using a pyrene&#8208;based photosensitizer with multiple terminal pyridine moieties as both the anchoring and linking groups to connect a Co hydrogen&#8208;evolution catalyst to the NiO substrate. This photocathode exhibits good dye adsorption and photochemical stability in aqueous solution and is applied in water reduction into hydrogen under irradiation in photo&#8208;electrochemical cells.







Abstract
The development of efficient photocathodes is of critical importance for the constructions of promising tandem photo&#8208;electrochemical cells. Most known dye&#8208;sensitized photocathodes are prepared with the conventional carboxylic or phosphonic acid anchors and require the presence of other terminal linking groups to connect catalysts; they suffer from high synthetic difficulty and low adsorption stability in aqueous media. Here, a compact bilayer photocathode has been prepared by using a pyrene&#8208;based photosensitizer with multiple terminal pyridine moieties as both the anchoring and linking groups to connect a Co hydrogen&#8208;evolution catalyst to the NiO substrate. The catalyst and dye molecule are assembled in a layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer manner on NiO through the metal&#8208;pyridine coordination. This photocathode exhibits good dye adsorption stability in aqueous media. A stable cathodic photocurrent of 70&#8197;&#956;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 was achieved, with H2 being generated at the photocathode under the visible&#8208;light irradiation. The Faraday efficiency of H2 evolution was estimated to be 9.1&#8201;%. Transient absorption spectral studies suggest that the interfacial hole transfer occurs within a few picoseconds. The integration of the organic photosensitizer with pyridine anchoring and linking groups is expected to provide a simple method for the fabrication of stable and efficient photocathodes.

         <title>Recent Developments of Dual Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Nitrogen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In recent years, DSACs for ENRR have been developed rapidly. We give essential characterization and detection methods after reviewing DSACs&#8242; coordination environments, support materials, the N2 molecule, and NRR mechanism configuration. Finally, we suggested electrochemical NRR research issues, answers, and future directions.







Abstract
Ammonia is vital for fertilizer production, hydrogen storage, and alternative fuels. The conventional Haber&#8208;Bosch process for ammonia production is energy&#8208;intensive and environmentally harmful. Designing environmentally friendly and low&#8208;energy consumption strategies for electrocatalytic N2 reduction reaction (ENRR) in mild conditions is meaningful. Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) have been studied extensively for NRR due to their high atomic utilization and unique electronic structure but are limited by their poor faradic efficiency and low ammonia formation yield. Dual single&#8208;atom catalysts (DSACs) have recently emerged as a promising solution for the effective activation of molecular N2, providing diverse active sites and synergistic interactions between adjacent atoms. In this review, we summarize the latest advances in metal DSACs for electrochemical ENRR based on both theoretical calculations and experimental studies, including aspects such as their variety, coordination, support, N2 adsorption and activity mechanisms, the characterization of NRR and electrochemical cell Configuration. We also address challenges and prospects in this rapidly evolving field, providing a comprehensive overview of DSACs for ENRR.

         <title>Bioinspired Functionalization of Carbonyl Compounds Enabled by Metal Chelated Bifunctional Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The current Review gives an overview of the recently developed synthetic transformations enabled by Nature&#8208;inspired bifunctional ligands that not only bind to a metal catalyst but also activate the carbonyl substrates, for example aldehydes, ketones etc., via organocatalysis, thereby accelerating the rate and facilitating stereoselectivity of the new chemical bond forming step.







Abstract
In Nature, enzymatic reactions proceed through exceptionally ordered transition states giving rise to extraordinary levels of stereoselection. In those reactions, the active site of the enzyme plays crucial roles &#8211; through one position, it holds the substrate in the proximity to the reaction epicentre that facilitates both the reactivity and stereoselectivity of the chemical process. Inspired by this natural phenomenon, synthetic chemists have designed bifunctional ligands that not only coordinate to a metal centre but also preassociate with an organic substrate, for example aldehyde and ketone, and exerts stereodirecting influence to accelerate the attack of the incoming reacting partner from a particular enantiotopic face. The chief goal of the current review is to give an overview of the recently developed approaches enabled by privileged bio&#8208;inspired bifunctional ligands that not only bind to the metal catalyst but also activates carbonyl substrates via organocatalysis, thereby easing in the new bond forming step. As carbonyl &#945;&#8208;functionalizations are dominated by enamine and enolate chemistry, the current review primarily focusses on enamine&#8208; and enolate&#8208;metal catalysis by bifunctional ligands. Thus, developments based on traditional cooperative catalysis occurring through two directly coupled but independent catalytic cycles of an organocatalyst and a metal catalyst are not covered.

         <title>Classical gold carbonyl complexes in tetrahedral and trigonal&#8208;planar settings</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A unique four&#8208;coordinate, classical gold(I)&#8208;carbonyl complex with substantial backdonation from gold has been isolated using a B&#8208;methylated and fluorinated tris(pyridyl)borate chelator. Its lighter silver(I) and copper(I) analogs enabled a study of coinage metal family group trends. The B&#8208;arylated ligand version also afforded a gold carbon monoxide complex that displays a notably low C&#8208;O stretch value, but with a trigonal planar geometry at gold. A computational analysis shows that the Au(I)&#8208;CO bonds of these tris(pyridyl)borate ligand supported molecules consist of electrostatic attraction, OC&#8594;Au donation, and very significant Au&#8594;CO &#960;&#8208;back&#8208;bonding components. The latter is responsible for the observed C&#8208;O stretching frequencies that are lower than in free CO.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Reaching the formidable C&#8208;H corners has been one of the top priorities of organic chemists in the recent past. This prompted us to disclose herein a vicinal annulation of 2&#8208;iodo benzoates, indoles and carbazoles with N&#8208;embedded 1,6&#8208;enynes through 7&#8208;/8&#8208;membered palladacycles. The relay does not require the assistance of any directing group, leading to multi&#8208;cyclic scaffolds which are readily diversified to an array of adducts (with new functional tethers and/or 3 contiguous stereocenters) where we showcase a rare benzylic mono&#8208;oxygenation.</dc:description>

         <title>Amido Silicon Chalcogenides: New Cage Compounds Derived From The Bicyclic Silicon(I) Ring Compound Si4{N(SiMe3)Mes}4</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The bicyclic silicon(I) ring compound Si4{N(SiMe3)Mes}42 was used as starting material in reactions with chalcogens and chalcogen transfer agents at low temperatures. This results in the selective formation of new cage compounds. With Me3NO a silicon oxide with adamantane&#8208;type cage 3 was isolated that represents the first isolated T4 silsesquioxane. The reactions propylenesulfide and red selenium gave direct access to defect heterocubane&#8208;type cages 4 and 5 with three Si&#8211;Si bonds wherein the silicon atoms adopt different low oxidation states of +I and +III. A reaction with elemental tellurium even occurs below room temperature to provide a ditelluro&#8208;tetrasila&#8208;tricyclohexane 6.</dc:description>

         <title>Brook Rearrangement as Trigger for Dearomatization Reaction: Synthesis of Non&#8208;Aromatic N&#8208;Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The [1,2]&#8208;Brook rearrangement stands as a potent technique for constructing complex molecules. In this study, we showcase its power in the dearomatization of aromatic N&#8208;heterocycles. Through a concise four&#8208;step process that integrates lithiation, nucleophilic addition, Brook rearrangement and dearomatization reaction, we demonstrate a versatile strategy for generating diverse non&#8208;aromatic N&#8208;heterocycles which exhibit ambident reactivities. Various acyl silanes, halo&#8208;pyridines, and quinolines have been explored within this context. The synthetic utility of this methodology is demonstrated through the construction of complex architectures.</dc:description>

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;mediated Dehydrogenation of Hydroboranes and Group 14 Compounds: Base&#8208;stabilized Silylene and Germylene Complexes vs. Transmetalation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Monocarbonyl rhodium complex LRh(CO), 1, which is stabilized by a pyrrole&#8208;based bis(phosphinimine) pincer ligand (L = &#8232;&#954;3&#8208;NNN&#8217; = 2,5&#8208;[iPr2P=N(4&#8208;iPrC6H4)]2&#8208;N&#8217;(C4H2)&#8208;), serves as a versatile platform for the dehydrogenation of Group 14 substrates. Reaction with primary and secondary silanes and germanes (MesSiH3, Et2SiH2, Ph2GeH2, tBuGeH3; Mes = mesityl) liberates H2 and yields base&#8208;stabilized tertylene compounds of the form &#954;2&#8208;L(CO)Rh(ER2) (E = Si: R = Mes, H, 2; R = Et, 5; E= Ge: R = Ph, 6; R = tBu, H, 8). The &#8220;:ER2&#8221; fragment in these species bridges between the rhodium center and a phosphinimine donor. Preliminary reactions between pinacol (Pin) and &#954;2&#8208;L(CO)Rh(ER2), E = Si, Ge, indicate that such complexes can serve as silylene and germylene synthons, releasing:ER2 and catalytically generating PinER2. In contrast, combination of complex 1 and MesGeH3 does not yield the anticipated dehydrogenation product, but rather, transmetalation similar to that observed upon reaction between 1 and 3,5&#8208;dimethylphenylborane prevails.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Properties of Fluorenone&#8208;containing Cyclo&#8208;paraphenylenes and their Late&#8208;Stage Transformation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cycloparaphenylenes (CPPs) are the smallest possible armchair carbon nanotubes, the properties of which strongly depend on their ring sizes. They can be further tuned by either peripheral functionalizations or by replacing phenylene rings for other aromatic units. Here we show how four novel donor&#8208;acceptor chromophores are obtained by incorporating fluorenone or 2&#8208;(9H&#8208;fluoren&#8208;9&#8208;ylidene)malononitrile into the loops of two differently sized CPPs. Synthetically, we managed to perform late&#8208;stage functionalization of the fluorenone&#8208;based rings by high&#8208;yielding Knoevenagel condensations. The structures were confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallographic analyses, revealing that replacing a phenylene for a fused&#8208;ring&#8208;system acceptor introduces additional strain. The donor&#8208;acceptor characters of the CPPs were supported by absorption and fluorescence spectroscopic studies, electrochemical studies (displaying the CPPs as multi&#8208;redox systems undergoing reversible or quasi&#8208;reversible redox events), as well as by computations. The oligophenylene parts were found to comprise the electron donor units of the macrocycles and the fluorenone parts the acceptor units.</dc:description>

         <title>Extended Tetrathiafulvalenes with Fluoreno[3,2&#8208;b]fluorene and Diindeno[1,2&#8208;b:1',2'&#8208;i]anthracene Cores</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In one&#8208;dimensional polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) containing five&#8208; and six&#8208;membered rings fused together, one key question is whether the structures possess a quinoidal or aromatic diradical character. Here, we generate such PAHs by reversible oxidation of PAH&#8208;extended tetrathiafulvalenes (TTFs). Extended TTFs were thus prepared and studied for their geometrical properties (crystallography), redox properties, and UV/Vis/NIR/EPR characteristics as a function of charge state. The EPR measurements of radical cations showed unique features for each PAH&#8208;TTF. The dications, formally composed of fluoreno[3,2&#8208;b]fluorene and diindeno[1,2&#8208;b:1',2'&#8208;i]anthracene cores, were experimentally found to exhibit singlet ground states. For the latter, calculations reveal the closed shell, quinoid singlet state to be isoenergetic with the open shell singlet diradical. Each charge state exhibited unique optical properties with radical cations absorbing strongly in the NIR region with signatures from&#160;&#960;&#8208;dimers for the large core.&#160;The experimental results were paralleled and supported by detailed computations, including&#160;spin density distribution calculations, EPR simulations, and&#160;nucleus independent chemical shift (NICS)&#160;xy&#160;scans.</dc:description>

         <title>Rebound or Cage Escape? The Role of the Rebound Barrier for the Reactivity of Non&#8208;heme High&#8208;valent FeIV=O species</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Owing to their high reactivity and selectivity, variations in the spin ground state and a range of possible pathways, high&#8208;valent FeIV=O species are popular models with potential bioinspired applications. An interesting example of a structure&#8211;reactivity pattern is the detailed study with five nonheme amine&#8208;pyridine pentadentate ligand FeIV=O species, including N4py: [(L1)FeIV=O]2+ (1), bntpen: [(L2)FeIV=O]2+ (2), py2tacn: [(L3)FeIV=O]2+ (3), and two isomeric bispidine derivatives: [(L4)FeIV=O]2+ (4) and [(L5)FeIV=O]2+ (5). In this set, the order of increasing reactivity in the hydroxylation of cyclohexane differs from that with cyclohexadiene as substrate. A comprehensive DFT, ab initio CASSCF/NEVPT2 and DLPNO&#8208;CCSD(T) study is presented to untangle the observed patterns. These are well reproduced when both activation barriers for the C&#8208;H abstraction and the OH rebound are taken into account. An MO, NBO and deformation energy analysis reveals the importance of &#960;(pyr) &#224; &#960;*xz(FeIII&#8208;OH) electron donation for weakening the FeIII&#8208;OH bond and thus reducing the rebound barrier. This requires that pyridine rings are oriented perpendicularly to the FeIII&#8211;OH bond, i.e., this is a subtle but crucial point in ligand design for non&#8208;heme iron alkane hydroxylation.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Synthesis of Phosphoryltriacetates from White Phosphorus via Visible Light Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organophosphorus compounds (OPCs) are widely used in many fields. However, traditional synthetic routes in the industry usually involve multistep and hazardous procedures. Therefore, it&#8217;s of great significance to construct such compounds in an environmental&#8208;friendly and facile way. Herein, a photoredox catalytic method has been developed to construct novel phosphoryltriacetates. Using fac&#8208;Ir(ppy)3 (ppy = 2&#8208;phenylpyridine) as the photocatalyst and blue LEDs (456 nm) as the light source, white phosphorus can react with &#945;&#8208;bromo esters smoothly to generate phosphoryltriacetates in moderate to good yields. This one&#8208;step approach features mild reaction conditions and simple operational process without chlorination.</dc:description>

         <title>Total Synthesis of Cyanobactin Natural Product Balgacyclamide B</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Balgacyclamide A&#8208;C are a family of cyanobactin natural products isolated from freshwater cyanobacteria&#160;Microcystis aeruginosa. These macrocyclic peptides are characterized by their oxazoline&#8208;thiazole core, their 7 or 8 stereocenters, and their antiparasitic activities. Balgacyclamide B is known for its activity towards&#160;Plasmodium falciparum&#160;chloroquine&#8208;resistant strain K1,&#160;Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense,&#160;and&#160;Leishmania donovani. In this report, the first total synthesis of Balgacyclamide B is described in a 17&#8208;steps pathway and a 2% overall yield. The synthetic pathway toward balgacyclamide B can be adapted for the future syntheses of balgacyclamide A and C. In addition, a brief history background of oxazolines syntheses is shown to emphasize the importance of the cyclization conditions used to interconvert or retain configuration of&#160;b&#8208;hydroxy amides via dehydrative cyclization.</dc:description>

         <title>Organophotocatalyzed Alkyl/Arylsulfonylation of Vinylcyclopropanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Allyl sulfones are an essential pharmacophore in many bioactive compounds. To combat their synthetic barrier, we report a practical, straightforward organophotocatalyzed&#160;methodology for accessing miscellaneously functionalized allyl sulfone derivatives using inexpensive and bench&#8208;stable sodium sulfinate salts under mild conditions. This photo&#8208;catalyzed radical sulfonylation provides access to a variety of allyl sulfones in good to excellent yields with high E:Z selectivity. A wide range of vinyl cyclopropanes, as well as aryl/hetero and alkyl sodium sulfinates, were tolerated and reliable in gram&#8208;scale synthesis. Later on, further functionalization of allyl sulfones was demonstrated. A plausible mechanism is proposed for radical sulfonylation with the control experiments.</dc:description>

         <title>New Multifunctional Bipyrimidine&#8208;Based Chromophores for NLO Active Thin&#8208;Film Preparation.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>New synthesized bipyrimidine&#8208;based chromophores presenting alkoxystyryl donor groups carrying aliphatic achiral and chiral chains in the 4 position, connected to electron&#8208;accepting 2,2&#8208;bipyrimidine cores have been synthesized. Their linear and nonlinear optical properties were investigated as well as their mesomorphic properties by various techniques (light&#8208;transmission measurements, polarized&#8208;light optical microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry measurements and two&#8208;photon excited fluorescence). &#160;The derivatives with achiral linear carbon chains were found to exhibit liquid&#8208;crystal properties with the formation smectic phases over large temperature ranges which were confirmed by small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering analysis via stacking models. The nonlinear optical properties in the solid state for derivatives with C14 and the citronellol chains have been studied by wide&#8208;field second&#8208;harmonic generation and multi&#8208;photon fluorescence imaging, confirming centrosymmetry for these achiral mesogens and their excellent third&#8208;order nonlinearity whereas the chiral compound exhibits non&#8208;centrosymmetric organization resulting in a strong Second Harmonic Generation at the crystal state.</dc:description>

         <title>Reductive Release from a Hybrid PKS&#8208;NRPS during the Biosynthesis of Pyrichalasin H</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Three central steps during the biosynthesis of cytochalasan precursors, including reductive release, Knoevenagel cyclisation and Diels Alder cyclisation are not yet understood at a detailed molecular level. In this work we investigated the reductive release step catalysed by a hybrid polyketide synthase non&#8208;ribosomal peptide synthetase (PKS&#8208;NRPS) from the pyrichalasin H pathway. Synthetic thiolesters were used as substrate mimics for in vitro studies with the isolated reduction (R) and holo&#8208;thiolation (T) domains of the PKS&#8208;NRPS hybrid PyiS. These assays demonstrate that the PyiS R&#8208;domain mainly catalyses an NADPH&#8208;dependent reductive release of an aldehyde intermediate that quickly undergoes spontaneous Knoevenagel cyclisation. The R&#8208;domain can only process substrates that are covalently bound to the phosphopantetheine thiol of the upstream T&#8208;domain, but it shows little selectivity for the polyketide.</dc:description>

         <title>Colloidal and Thermal Stability of Three&#8208;Component Hybrid Materials containing Clay Mineral, Polysaccharide and Surfactant</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The paper presents the colloidal and thermal stability of the three&#8208;component hybrid materials containing halloysite, polysaccharides (alginic acid, cationic cellulose and hydroxyethyl cellulose) and Tritons. TX&#8208;100, TX&#8208;165 and TX&#8208;405 were used as non&#8208;ionic surfactants. Stability and other properties of the hybrid materials were tested by the following methods: UV&#8208;Vis, TGA (thermogravimetric analysis) and DSC (differential scanning calorimetry), CHN (elemental analysis), SEM&#8208;EDX (scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X&#8208;Ray spectroscopy) and tensiometry. According to the results with the increasing polymer concentration the colloidal stability of the tested systems also increases. Moreover, the addition of the surfactants causes the increase of polysaccharide adsorption but the colloidal stability of the tested systems decreases due to large weights of formed aggregates. As follows from the thermal analysis, the comparison of the TG/DTG&#8208;DSC curves obtained for the investigated polymers confirms that their thermal decomposition courses have some common features. The obtained results have the application potential in the formation of the materials for the pollutants removal from water and sewages.</dc:description>

         <title>Tunable Metal&#8208;free Imidazole&#8208;Benzimidazole Electrocatalysts for Oxygen Reduction in Aqueous Solutions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of metal&#8208;free imidazole&#8208;benzimidazole catalysts (ImBenz&#8208;H, ImBenz&#8208;NO2, ImBenz&#8208;OCH3) for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) were prepared. We demonstrate that the electrocatalytic O2 reduction by ImBenz&#8208;NO2 with the electron&#8208;withdrawing group showed high selectivity toward H2O with the number of electrons transferred (n = 3.7) in a neutral aqueous solution. The highest ORR selectivity toward H2O2 was achieved using ImBenz&#8208;H (n = 2.4) in an alkaline solution. Electrochemical studies of reaction kinetics disclosed that the highest turnover frequencies were obtained from ImBenz&#8208;H in both neutral and alkaline aqueous solutions. The results prove that the ORR selectivity is tunable by modulating the substituent of the ImBenz catalysts. Furthermore, DFT calculations suggested that the ORR mechanism of ImBenz&#8208;H involves the electron transfer from imidazole&#8208;benzimidazole to O2 resulting in the formation of H2O2 which supports the redox active properties of the catalysts ImBenz.</dc:description>

         <title>A Metal&#8208;Free Molecular Ferroelectric [4&#8208;Me&#8208;cyclohexylamine]ClO4 Introduced by Boat and Chair Conformations of Cyclohexylamine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic ferroelectrics have received a great deal of interest due to their exclusive&#160;properties. However, organic ferroelectrics have not been fully explored, which hinders their practical application. Here, we presented a novel metal&#8208;free organic molecular ferroelectric [4&#8208;MCHA][ClO4] (1) (4&#8208;MCHA = trans&#8208;4&#8208;methylcyclohexylamine), which exhibits an above&#8208;room&#8208;temperature of 328 K. Strikingly, the crystal structure analysis of 1 shows that the driving force of phase transition is related to the interesting chair&#8208;boat conformation change of 4&#8208;MCHA cation, in addition to&#160; the order&#8208;disorder transition. Using piezoelectric response force microscopy (PFM), the presence of domains and the implemented polarization switching was clearly observed, which explicitly determined the presence of room&#8208;temperature ferroelectricity of 1. As far as we know, the ferroelectric phase transition mechanism attributed to the conformational change in a trans isomeric cation is very rare. This research enriched the path of designing ferroelectric materials and smart materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Simulating non&#8208;adiabatic dynamics of photoexcited phenyl azide: Investigating electronic and structural relaxation en route to the formation of phenyl nitrene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Excited state molecular dynamics simulations of the photoexcited phenyl azide have been performed. The semi&#8208;classical surface hopping approximation has enabled an unconstrained analysis of the electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom which contribute to the molecular dissociation of phenyl azide into phenyl nitrene and molecular nitrogen. The significance of the second singlet excited state in leading the photodissociation has been established through electronic structure calculations, based on multiconfigurational schemes, and state population dynamics. The investigations on the structural dynamics have revealed the N &#8722; N bond separation to be accompanied by synchronous changes in the azide N &#8722; N &#8722; N bond angle. The 100 fs simulation results in a nitrene fragment that is electronically excited in the singlet manifold.</dc:description>

         <title>Understanding the Electronic Structure of Magnetic Trinuclear Complexes Based on the Tris&#8208;dioxolene Triphenylene Non&#8208;innocent Bridging Ligand, a Theoretical Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A complete theoretical analysis using first the simple H&#252;ckel model followed by more sophisticated multi&#8208;reference calculations on a trinuclear Ni(II) complex (Tp#Ni3HHTP), bearing the non&#8208;innocent bridging ligand HHTP3&#8208;, is carried out. The three semiquinone moieties of HHTP3&#8208;&#160;couple antiferromagnetically and lead to a single unpaired electron localized on one of the moieties. The calculated exchange coupling integrals together with the zero&#8208;field parameters allow, when varied within a certain range, reproducing the experimental data. These results are generalized for two similar other trinuclear complexes containing Ni(II) and Cu(II). The electronic structure of HHTP3&#8208;&#160;turns out to be independent of both the chemical nature and the geometry of the metal ions. We also establish a direct correlation between the geometrical and the electronic structures of the non&#8208;innocent ligand that is consistent with the results of calculations. It allows experimentalists to get insight into the magnetic behavior of this type of complexes by an analysis of their X&#8208;ray structure.</dc:description>

         <title>Deciphering iron&#8208;catalyzed C&#8211;H amination with organic azides:&#160;

N2&#160;cleavage from a stable organoazide complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catalytic C&#8211;N bond formation by direct activation of C&#8211;H groups offers wide synthetic potential. En route to C&#8211;H amination, complexes with organic azides are critical precursors towards the reactive nitrene intermediate. Despite their relevance, only&#160;&#945;&#8208;N coordinated organoazide complexes are scarce in general, and elusive with iron, although iron complexes are by far the most active catalysts for C&#8211;H amination with organoazides. Herein, we report the synthesis of a stable iron&#160;&#945;&#8208;N coordinated organoazide complex from Fe(N(SiMe3)2)2&#160;and AdN3&#160;(Ad = 1&#8208;adamantyl) and its crystallographic, IR, NMR and M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopic characterization. These analyses revealed that the organoazide is in fast equilibrium between the free and coordinated state (Keq&#160;= 62). Photo&#8208;crystallography experiments showed gradual dissociation of N2, which imparted an Fe&#8211;N bond length increase and correspond to structural snapshots of the formation of an iron imido/nitrene complex. Reactivity of the organoazide complex in solution showed complete loss of N2, and subsequent formation of a C&#8211;H aminated product via nitrene insertion into a C&#8211;H bond of the N(SiMe3)2&#160;ligand. Monitoring this reaction by&#160;1H NMR spectroscopy indicates the transient formation of the imido/nitrene intermediate, which was supported by zero&#8208;field M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy in frozen solution.</dc:description>

         <title>The Improving Effect of Bromine&#8208;Substitution on Photothermal Performance of &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Phototheranostic Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging&#8208;guided photothermal therapy (PTT) has been widely investigated due to its great application potential in tumor theranostics. PTT is an effective and non&#8208;invasive tumor treatment method that can adapt to tumor hypoxia; nevertheless, simple and effective strategies are still desired to develop new materials with excellent PTT properties to meet the clinical requirements. In this work, we arise a bromine&#8208;substitution strategy to enhance the PTT of A&#8208;D&#8208;A&#8217;&#8208;D&#8208;A &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules. The experimental results reveal that bromine&#8208;substitution can notably enhance the absorptivity (&#949;) and photothermal conversion efficiency (PCE) of the &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules, resulting in the brominated molecules generating two&#8208;fold more heat (&#949;808 nm &#215; PCE) compared with the non&#8208;substituted counterpart. We declare that the enhanced photothermal properties of bromine&#8208;substituted &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules are a combined outcome of the heavy&#8208;atom effect, enhanced ICT effect, and bromine&#8208;mediate more intense intermolecular &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking. Finally, the NIR&#8208;II tumor imaging capability and efficient PTT tumor ablation of the brominated &#960;&#8208;conjugated materials demonstrate that bromine&#8208;substitution will become a promising strategy for developing high&#8208;performance NIR&#8208;II imaging&#8208;guided PTT agents in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>Doubly Bridged Anthracenes: Blue Emitters for OLEDs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The photooxidative stability of a series of doubly bridged anthracenes was evaluated after their preparation via twofold macrocyclization of a bis(resorcinyl)anthracene. Lightfastness correlates with the energy levels of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO), resulting in superior stability of the tetraesters compared to the tetraethers. The lengths and steric demand of the linker only plays a minor role for the ester&#8208;based compounds, which can be prepared in reasonable yields and thus tested in proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept organic light&#8208;emitting diodes. Double ester&#8208;bridging allows deep blue electro&#8208;luminescence, highlighting the importance of the choice of the functional groups used for macrocyclization.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulating the Interfacial Charge Density by Constructing a Novel Zn Anode&#8208;Electrolyte Interface for Highly Reversible Zn Anode</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) have attracted considerable attention. However, due to the uneven distribution of charge density at Zn anode|electrolyte interface, severe dendrites and corrosion are generated during cycling. In this work, a facile and scalable strategy to address the above&#8208;mentioned issues has been proposed through regulating the charge density at Zn anode|electrolyte interface. As a proof of concept, amidinothiourea (ATU) with abundant lone&#8208;pair electrons is employed as an interfacial charge modifier for Zn anode|electrolyte interface. The uniform and increased interfacial charge distribution on Zn anode|electrolyte interface has been obtained. Moreover, the unique Zn&#8208;bond constructed between N atoms and Zn2+ as well as the hydrogen bonds are formed among ATU and Ac&#8208; anion/active H2O, which promote the migration and desolvation behavior of Zn2+ at anode|electrolyte interface. Accordingly, at a trace concentration of 0.01 mg mL&#8208;1 ATU, these features endow Zn anode with a long cycling life (more than 800 h), and a high average Columbic efficiency (99.52%) for Zn||Cu batteries. When pairing with I2 cathode, the improved cycling ability (5000 cycles) with capacity retention of 77.9% is achieved. The fundamental understanding on the regulation of charge density at anode|electrolyte interface can facilitate the development of AZIBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Computational design of &#945;&#8208;conotoxins to target specific nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subtypes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are drug targets for neurological diseases and disorders, but selective targeting of the large number of nAChR subtypes is challenging. Marine cone snail &#945;&#8208;conotoxins are potent blockers of nAChRs and some have been engineered to achieve subtype selectivity. This engineering effort would benefit from rapid computational methods able to predict mutational energies, but current approaches typically require high&#8208;resolution experimental structures, which are not widely available for &#945;&#8208;conotoxin complexes. Here, we benchmarked five mutational energy prediction methods using crystallographic and mutational data on two acetylcholine binding protein/&#945;&#8208;conotoxin systems. We developed molecular models for six nAChR subtypes in complex with five &#945;&#8208;conotoxins that were studied through 150 substitutions. We determined that the best method was a combination of FoldX and molecular dynamics simulations, resulting in a predictive Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 0.68 (85% accuracy). Novel &#945;&#8208;conotoxin mutants designed using this method were successfully validated by experimental assay with improved pharmaceutical properties. This work paves the way for the rapid design of subtype&#8208;specific nAChR ligands and potentially accelerated drug development.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Adhesion of a Pilus&#8208;derived Peptide Involved in Pseudomonas aeruginosa Biofilm Formation on non&#8208;polar ZnO Surfaces</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bacterial colonization and biofilm formation on abiotic surfaces are initiated by the adhesion of peptides and proteins. Understanding the adhesion of such peptides and proteins at a molecular level thus represents an important step toward controlling and suppressing biofilm formation on technological and medical materials. This study investigates the molecular adhesion of a pilus&#8208;derived peptide that facilitates biofilm formation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a multidrug&#8208;resistant opportunistic pathogen frequently encountered in healthcare settings. Single&#8208;molecule force spectroscopy (SMFS) was performed on chemically etched ZnO surfaces to gather insights about peptide adsorption force and its kinetics. Metal&#8208;free click chemistry for the fabrication of peptide&#8208;terminated SMFS cantilevers was performed on amine&#8208;terminated gold cantilevers and verified by X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and polarization&#8208;modulated infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (PM&#8208;IRRAS). Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and XPS analyses reveal stable topographies and surface chemistries of the substrates that are not affected by SMFS. Rupture events described by the worm&#8208;like chain model (WLC) up to 600 pN were detected for the non&#8208;polar ZnO(11&#8208;20) surfaces. The dissociation barrier energy at zero force &#916;G(0), the transition state distance xb and bound&#8208;unbound dissociation rate at zero force koff(0) for the single crystalline substrate indicate that coordination and hydrogen bonds dominate the peptide/surface interaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemo&#8208;Enzymatic Synthesis of Isomeric I&#8208;branched Polylactosamines using Traceless Blocking Groups</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Poly&#8208;N&#8208;acetyl lactosamines (polyLacNAc) are common structural motifs of N&#8208; and O&#8208;linked glycan, glycosphingolipids and human milk oligosaccharides. They can be branched by the addition of &#946;1,6&#8208;linked N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;glucosamine (GlcNAc) moieties to internal galactoside (Gal) residues by the I&#8208;branching enzyme beta&#8208;1,6&#8208;N&#8208;acetylglucosaminyltransferase 2 (GCNT2). I&#8208;branching has been implicated in many biological processes and is also associated with various diseases such as cancer progression. Currently, there is a lack of methods that can install, in a regioselective manner, I&#8208;branches and allows the preparation of isomeric poly&#8208;LacNAc derivatives. Here, we described a chemo&#8208;enzymatic strategy that addresses this deficiency and is based in the enzymatic assembly of an oligo&#8208;LacNAc chain that at specific positions is modified by a GlcNTFA moiety. Replacement of the trifluoroacetyl (TFA) moiety by tert&#8208;butyloxycarbonyl (Boc) gives compounds in which the galactoside at the proximal site is blocked from modification by GCNT2. After elaboration of the antennae, the Boc group can be removed, and the resulting amine acetylated to give natural I&#8208;branched structures. It is also shown that fucosides can function as a traceless blocking group that can provide complementary I&#8208;branched structures from a single precursor. The methodology made it possible to synthesize a library of polyLacNAc chains having various topologies.</dc:description>

         <title>Extremely Slow Thermally&#8208;induced Spin Crossover in the Two&#8208;dimensional Network [Fe(bbtr)3](BF4)2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cooling [Fe(bbtr)3](BF4)2 (bbtr=1,4&#8208;di(1,2,3&#8208;triazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)butane) triggers very slow spin crossover below 80 K (T1/2&#8595; = 76 K). The spin crossover (SCO) is accompanied by a hysteresis loop &#8232;(T1/2&#8593; = 89 K). In contrast to isostructural perchlorate analogue [Fe(bbtr)3](ClO4)2 in which spin crossover during cooling is preceded by phase transition at TPT=126 K in tetrafluoroborate phase transition does not occur to the beginning of spin crossover (80 K). Studies of mixed crystals [Fe(bbtr)3](BF4)2(1&#8208;x)(ClO4)2x (0.5&#8804;x&#8804;0.9) showed that a phase transition precedes spin crossover, however, for x &#8773; 0.46 intersection of T1/2(x) and TPT(x) dependencies takes place. The application of pressure of 1 GPa shifts the spin crossover in [Fe(bbtr)3](BF4)2 to a temperature above 270 K. High&#8208;pressure studies of neat tetrafluoroborate and perchlorate, as well as mixed crystals [Fe(bbtr)3](BF4)2(1&#8208;x)(ClO4)2x (0.1&#8804;x&#8804;0.9), revealed that at 295 K P1/2 value changes linearly with x indicating similar mechanism of spin crossover under elevated pressure in all systems under investigation. Variable pressure single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies confirmed that in contrast to thermally induced spin crossover undergoing differently in tetrafluoroborate and perchlorate an application of high pressure removes this differentiation leading to a similar mechanism depending at first on start spin crossover and then P&#8208;3&#8594;P&#8208;1 phase transition occurs.</dc:description>

         <title>o&#8208;Hydroxyarylphosphanes: Strategies for Syntheses of Configurationally Stable, Electronically and Sterically Tunable Ambiphiles with Multiple Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>o&#8208;Hydroxyarylphosphanes are fascinating compounds by their multiple&#8208;reactivity features, attributed to the ambident hard and soft Lewis&#8208; and also Br&#248;nstedt acid&#8208;base properties, wide tuning opportunities via backbone substituents with &#177;mesomeric and inductive, at P and in o&#8208;position to P and O also steric effects, and in addition, the configurational stability at three&#8208;valent phosphorus. Air sensitivity may be overcome by reversible protection with BH3, but the easy oxidation to P(V)&#8208;compounds may also be used. Since the first reports on the title compounds ca. 50 years ago the multiple reactivity has led to versatile applications. This includes various P&#8208;E&#8208;O and P=C&#8208;O heterocycles, a multitude of O&#8208;substituted derivatives including acyl derivatives for traceless Staudinger couplings of biomolecules with labels or functional substituents, phosphane&#8208;phosphite ligands, which like the o&#8208;phosphanylphenols itself form a range of transition metal complexes and catalysts. Also main group metal complexes and (bi)arylphosphonium&#8208;organocatalysts are derived. Within this review the various strategies for the access of the starting materials are illuminated, including few hints to selected applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Spin&#8208;Vibronic Coupling Controls the Intersystem Crossing of Iodine&#8208;Substituted BODIPY Triplet Chromophores</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>4,4&#8208;difluoro&#8208;4&#8208;borata&#8208;3a&#8208;azonia&#8208;4a&#8208;aza&#8208;s&#8208;indacene (BODIPY) dyes are extensively used in various applications of their triplet states, ranging from photoredox catalysis, through triplet sensitization to photodynamic therapy. However, the rational design of BODIPY triplet chromophores by ab initio modelling is limited by their strong interactions of spin, electronic and vibrational dynamics. In particular, spin&#8208;vibronic coupling is often overlooked when estimating intersystem crossing (ISC) rates. In this study, we developed a combined experimental and theoretical approach using spin&#8208;vibronic coupling to correctly describe ISC in BODIPY dyes. For this purpose, we examined seven &#960;&#8208;extended BODIPY derivatives with iodine atoms in different positions. We found that the heavy&#8208;atom effect of iodine atoms is site&#8208;specific, causing high triplet yields in only some positions. This site&#8208;specific ISC was explained by El&#8208;Sayed rules, so both the contribution and character of the molecular orbitals involved in the excitation must be considered when predicting the ISC rates. Overall, the rational design of BODIPY triplet chromophores requires using (i) the high&#8208;quality electronic structure theory, including both static and dynamical correlations, and (ii) the two&#8208;component wave function Hamiltonian, and rationalizing (iii) ISC based on the character of the molecular orbitals of heavy atoms involved in the excitation, expanding El&#8208;Sayed rules beyond their traditional applications.</dc:description>

         <title>A Proof&#8208;of&#8208;Principle Design for Through&#8208;Space Transmission of Unidirectional Rotary Motion by Molecular Photogears</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The construction of molecular photogears that can achieve through&#8208;space transmission of the unidirectional double&#8208;bond rotary motion of light&#8208;driven molecular motors onto a remote single&#8208;bond axis is a formidable challenge in the field of artificial molecular machines. Here, we present a proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle design of such photogears that is based on the possibility to use stereogenic substituents to control both the relative stabilities of two helical forms of the photogear and the double&#8208;bond photoisomerization reaction that connects them. The potential of the design is verified by quantum&#8208;chemical modeling through which photogearing is found to be a favorable process compared to free&#8208;standing single&#8208;bond rotation (&#8220;slippage&#8221;). Overall, our study unveils a surprisingly simple approach to realizing unidirectional photogearing.</dc:description>

         <title>Cage Match: Comparing the Anion Binding Ability of Isostructural Versus Isofunctional Pairs of Metal&#8208;Organic Nanocages</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Affinities of six anions (mesylate, acetate, trifluoroacetate, p&#8208;toluenecarboxylate, p&#8208;toluenesulfonate, and perfluorooctanoate) for three related Pt2+&#8208;linked porphyrin nanocages were measured to probe the influence of different noncovalent recognition motifs (e.g., hydrogen bonding, electrostatics, &#960; bonding) on anion binding. Two new hosts of M6L312+ (1b) and M4L28+ (2) composition (M = (en)Pt2+, L = (3&#8208;py)4porphyrin) were prepared in a one&#8208;pot synthesis and allowed comparison of hosts that differ in structure while maintaining similar N&#8208;H hydrogen&#8208;bond donor ability. Comparisons of isostructural hosts that differ in hydrogen&#8208;bonding ability were made between 1b and a related M6L312+ nanoprism (1a, M = (tmeda)Pt2+) that lacks N&#8208;H groups. Considerable variation in association constants (K1 = 1.6 x 103 M&#8208;1 to 1.3 x 108 M&#8208;1) and binding mode (exo vs. endo) were found for different host&#8208;guest combinations. Strongest binding was seen between ptoluenecarboxylate and 1b, but surprisingly, association of this guest with 1a was only slightly weaker despite the absence of NH&#8208;&#8208;&#8208;O interactions. The high affinity between p&#8208;toluenecarboxylate and 1a could be turned off by protonation, and this behavior was used to toggle between the binding of this guest and the environmental pollutant perfluorooctanoate, which otherwise has a lower affinity for the host.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral Benzene Triimide (BTI) Radical Anions for Probing the Interplay of Unpaired Electron Spin and Chirality</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein a series of chiral BTI radical anions bearing different chiral substituents were efficiently prepared by chemical reduction. X&#8208;ray crystallography revealed finely&#8208;tuned packing and helix assemblies of the radicals by the size of chiral substituents in crystalline state. In accordance with the crystalline&#8208;state packing, the powder ESR spectra indicate that 4a&#8211;&#8226;CoCp2+ and 4c&#8211;&#8226;CoCp2+ &#960;&#8208;dimers exhibit thermally excited triplet states arising from strong spin&#8208;spin interactions, while discrete 4b&#8211;&#8226;CoCp2+ shows a broad doublet&#8208;state signal reflecting to weak spin&#8208;spin interactions. The interplay between the unpaired electron spin and chiral substituents was studied by UV&#8208;Vis&#8208;NIR spectra, electronic circular dichroism (ECD) and TD DFT calculations. Different NIR absorptions of the radicals attributing to isolated SOMO&#8594;LUMO+1 (~889 nm) transitions were recorded. The emergence of Cotton effects (CEs) at the NIR region for 4c&#8211;&#8226;CoCp2+ radical enantiomers suggest the interplay between chirality and unpaired electron spin. The origin of the different circularly polarized light absorptions regarding SOMO derived transitions (around 880 nm) was attributed to chiral substitutes regulated electric and magnetic transition dipole moments of the unpaired electron participated transition.</dc:description>

         <title>Altering the Localization of an Unpaired Spin in a Formal Ni(V) Species</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The participation of both ligand and the metal center in the redox events has been recognized as one of the ways to attain the formal high valent complexes for the late 3d metals, such as Ni and Cu. Such an approach has been employed successfully to stabilize a Ni(III) bisphenoxyl diradical species in which there exist an equilibrium between the ligand and the Ni localized resultant spin. The present work however broadens the scope of the previously reported three oxidized equivalent species by conveying the approaches that tend to affect the reported equilibrium in CH3CN at 233 K. Various spectroscopic characterization revealed that employing exogenous N&#8208;donor ligands like 1&#8208;methyl imidazole and pyridine favors the formation of the Ni centered localized spin though axial binding. In contrast, due to its steric hinderance, quinoline favors an exclusive ligand localized radical species. DFT studies shed light on the novel intermediates' complex electronic structure. Further, the three oxidized equivalent species with the Ni centered spin was examined for its hydrogen atom abstraction ability stressing their key role in alike reactions.</dc:description>
