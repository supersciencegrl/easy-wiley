      <title>Synthesis of nitro&#8208;aryl functionalised 4&#8208;amino&#8208;1,8&#8208;naphthalimides and their evaluation as fluorescent hypoxia sensors</title>
      <dc:description>Fluorescent sensors are a vital research tool, enabling the study of intricate cellular processes in a sensitive manner. The design and synthesis of responsive and targeted probes is necessary to allow such processes to be interrogated in the cellular environment. This remains a challenge, and requires methods for functionalisation of fluorophores with multiple appendages for sensing and targeting groups. Methods to synthesise more structurally complex derivatives of fluorophores will expand their potential scope. Most known 4&#8208;amino&#8208;1,8&#8208;naphthalimides are only functionalised at imide and 4&#8208;positions, and structural modifications at additional positions will increase the breadth of their utility as responsive sensors. Here we evaluate methods for the incorporation of a hypoxia sensing group to 4&#8208;amino&#8208;1,8&#8208;naphthalimide. We developed an intermediate that allowed us to incorporate a sensing group, targeting group, and ICT donor to the naphthalimide core in a modular fashion. Synthetic strategies for attaching the hypoxia sensing group and how they affected the fluorescence of the naphthalimide were evaluated by photophysical characterisation and time&#8208;dependent density functional theory. We then rationally designed an extracellular hypoxia probe that could selectively image the hypoxic and necrotic region of tumour spheroids. Our results demonstrate the versatility of the naphthalimide scaffold and expand its utility. This approach to probe design will enable the flexible, efficient generation of selective, targeted fluorescent sensors for various biological purposes.</dc:description>

They were found to dramatically enhance the CL emission of luminol&#8208;H2O2  reaction for 1349 times, and therefore employed as very sensitive signal probes for conducting CL immunoassay of cardiac troponin I. The detection limit of the target analyte was as low as 3.3 pg/mL. It is the first time to validate employment of SACs for boosting CL reaction. The Co SACs can also be employed to trace other biorecognition events with high sensitivity.</dc:description>

      <title>An Ultra&#8208;microporous Metal Organic Framework with Exceptional Xe Capacity</title>
      <dc:description>Molecular confinement plays a significant effect on trapped gas and solvent molecules. A fundamental understanding of gas adsorption within the porous confinement provides information necessary to design a material with improved selectivity. In this regard, metal organic frameworks (MOFs) adsorbents are ideal candidate materials to study confinement effects for weakly interacting gas molecules such as noble gases. Among the noble gases, Xenon (Xe) has practical applications in the medical, automotive and aerospace industries. In this communication, we report an ultra&#8208;microporous nickel&#8208;isonicotinate MOF with exceptional Xe uptake and selectivity compared to all benchmark MOF and porous organic cage materials. The selectivity arises because of the near perfect fit of the atomic Xe inside the porous confinement. Notably, at low partial pressure, the Ni&#8208;MOF interacts very strongly with Xe compared to the closely related Krypton gas (Kr) and more polarizable CO 2 . Further 129 Xe NMR suggests a broad isotropic chemical shift due to the reduced motion as a result of confinement.</dc:description>

      <title>Reactive compression molding post&#8208;inverse vulcanization: A method to assemble, recycle, and repurpose sulfur polymers and composites</title>
      <dc:description>Inverse vulcanization provides dynamic and responsive materials made from elemental sulfur and unsaturated cross&#8208;linkers. These polymers have been used in a variety of applications such as energy storage, infrared optics, repairable materials, environmental remediation, and precision fertilizers. In spite of these advances, there is a need for methods to recycle and reprocess these polymers. In this study, polymers prepared by inverse vulcanization are shown to undergo reactive compression molding. In this process, the reactive interfaces of sulfur polymers are brought into contact by mechanical compression. Upon heating these molds at relatively low temperatures (~100 &#186;C), chemical bonding occurs at the polymer interfaces by S&#8208;S metathesis. This method of processing is distinct from previous studies on inverse vulcanization because the polymers examined in this study do not form a liquid phase when heated. Neither compression nor heating alone was sufficient to mold these polymers into new architectures, so this is a new concept in the manipulation of sulfur polymers. Additionally, high&#8208;level ab initio calculations revealed that the weakest S&#8208;S bond in organic polysulfides decreases linearly in strength from a sulfur rank of 2 to 4, but then remains constant at about ~100 kJ mol  &#8208;1  for higher sulfur rank. This is critical information in engineering these polymers for S&#8208;S metathesis. Guided by this insight, polymer repair, recycling, and repurposing into new composites was demonstrated.</dc:description>

      <title>N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes Reduce and Functionalize Copper Oxide Surfaces in One Pot</title>
      <dc:description>Benzimidazolium hydrogen carbonate salts have been shown to act as N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene precursors which can remove oxide from copper oxide surfaces and functionalize the resulting metallic surfaces in a single step. Both the surfaces and the etching products are fully characterized by spectroscopic methods. Analysis of surfaces before and after NHC treatment by X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy demonstrates the complete removal of copper(II) oxide. Using 13 C&#8208;labelling, we determine that the products of this transformation include a cyclic urea, a ring&#8208;opened formamide and a bis&#8208;carbene copper(I) complex. These results illustrate the potential of NHCs to functionalize a much broader class of metals, including those prone to oxide treatment, greatly facilitating the preparation of NHC&#8208;based films on metals other than gold.</dc:description>

Complex  3  activates a C&#8208;H bond of two molecules of benzene to form PhBpin and regenerates  2  and  1  also in a sequential manner. Thus, complexes  1,  2, and  3  define two cycles for the catalytic direct C&#8208;H borylation of arenes with HBpin, which have the dihydride  2  as a common intermediate. The C&#8208;H bond activation of the arenes is the rate determining step of both cycles, being the C&#8208;H oxidative addition to  3  faster than to  2  . Results from the kinetic study of the reactions of  1  and  2  with HBpin support a cooperative function of the hydride ligands in the B&#8208;H bond activation. The addition of the boron atom of the borane to a hydride facilitates the coordination of the B&#8208;H bond through the formation of &#954;1  &#8208; and &#954;2  &#8208;dihydrideborate intermediates.</dc:description>

The use of highly nucleophilic 1,3,5&#8208;trimethoxybenzene (TMB) as the reducing agent is described for the first time and applied successfully in the deoxygenation of simple and functionalized sulfoxides. The method is easy to handle, economic, appropriate for gram scale and decidedly appropriate for poly&#8208;functionalized molecules, as demonstrated with more than 45 examples, including commercial medicines and analogues. We also report some competition experiments to define the more reactive sulfoxide and a mechanistic proposal based on substrate and product observations.</dc:description>

      <title>A Dimeric Chromium(II) Pincer as an Electron Shuttle for N=N Bond Scission</title>
      <dc:description>Reduction of the bis&#8208;pyrazolyl pyridine complex [CrL]2 with 4 KC8, followed by addition of one azobenzene, PhNNPh, transfers reducing equivalents to three azobenzenes, to form [K3Cr(PhNNPh)3]. This has three k2 PhNNPh2&#8722; ligands and K+ bound to nitrogens of azobenzene. When the stoichiometry is modified to 1:4:3, the product is changed to [K2CrL(PhNNPh)2], which has C2 symmetry except for the intimate ion pairing of two K+ to reduced azobenzene nitrogens, and to pyrazolate and phenyl rings. The origin of the observed delivery of reducing equivalents to several, not to a single N=N bond, is traced to the resistance of the one&#8208;electron reduced substrate to receiving a second electron, and is thus a general phenomenon. [CrL]2 alone is shown to be a two&#8208;electron reductant towards benzo[c]cinnoline (BCC) resulting in a product of formula [Cr2L2(BCC)], where the reducing equivalents originate purely from CrII. An analogous study of reaction of [CrL]2 with azobenzene yields [Cr2L2(PhNNPh)(THF)]. Together these illustrate different modes for the Cr2L2 unit to bind and reduce the N=N bond. A least squares fit of the two singly reduced DFT structures shows the only major change is a re&#8208;orientation of one phenyl ring in order to avoid repulsion with potassium but to still allow interaction of that phenyl &#960; system with K+. This shows both the impact of K+, being modest to N/Cr interactions, but nevertheless accommodating some &#960; donation of phenyl to potassium. Finally, delivering increasing equivalents of KC8 leads to complete cleavage of the N=N bond, and both N bind to three CrII.</dc:description>

      <title>Productive Syntheses of Privileged Scaffolds Inspired by the Recognition of a Diels&#8208;Alder Pattern Common to three Classes of Natural Products</title>
      <dc:description>Identification of a common Diels&#8208;Alder pattern in three classes of bioactive natural products led us to study the synthesis and cycloaddition of a new class of cyclic dienes readily available from   &#8208;unsaturated lactams. A practical and readily scalable route to the parent PMB&#8208;protected 6&#8208; and 7&#8208;membered   &#8208;unsaturated lactams was developed. These were readily transformed into the corresponding O&#8208;silylated dienes which were reacted with dimethyl&#8208; and diethyl fumarate to yield stereoselectively highly functionalized bicyclic adducts. These exhibited unexpected and versatile transformations upon acid hydrolysis depending on the nature of the dienophile substituents and the acid catalyst. All reactions have been performed on multigram quantities. These transformations provide a convenient, economical, and easily scalable pathway for the rapid construction of functionally and stereochemically dense privileged scaffolds for the construction of libraries of natural products&#8208;inspired molecules of pharmacological relevance.</dc:description>

      <title>Unprecedented Reverse Volume Expansion in Spin&#8208;Transition Crystals</title>
      <dc:description>The current craze for research around the spin crossover phenomenon can be justified to some extent by the mechanical properties due to the decrease of volume associated with the transition of the metal ion from the HS state to the LS state. As demonstrated here, the molecular complex [Fe(PM&#8208; p BrA) 2 (NCS) 2 ] exhibits, on the contrary, an increase of the unit&#8208;cell volume from HS to LS. This counter&#8208;intuitive and unprecedented behavior that concerns both the thermal and the photo&#8208;excited spin conversions is revealed by a combination of single&#8208;crystal and powder X&#8208;ray diffraction complemented by magnetic measurements. Interestingly, this abnormal volume change appears concomitant with the wide rotation of a phenyl ring which induces a drastic modification, though reversible, of the structural packing within the crystal. In addition, the light&#8208;induced HS state obtained through the Light&#8208;Induced Excited Spin&#8208;State Trapping shows a remarkably high relaxation temperature, namely T( LIESST ), of 109 K, one of the highest so far reported. The above set of quite unusual characteristics opens up new fields of possibilities within the development of spin crossover materials.</dc:description>

      <title>Structural Characterization and Lifetimes of Triple&#8208;Stranded Helical Coinage Metal Complexes: Synthesis, Spectroscopy and Quantum Chemical Calculations</title>
      <dc:description>We report on a series of polynuclear complexes containing a trinuclear Cu, Ag, or Au core in combination with the  fac  &#8208;isomer of the metalloligand [Ru(pypzH)  3  ](PF  6  )  2  (pypzH = 3&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)pyrazole). These (in case of the Ag and Au containing species) newly synthesized compounds of the general formula [{Ru(pypz)  3  }  2  M  3  ](PF  6  ) (  2  : M = Cu;  3  : M = Ag;  4  : M = Au) contain triple&#8208;stranded helical structures in which two ruthenium moieties are connected by three N&#8211;M&#8211;N (M = Cu, Ag, Au) bridges.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We report on a series of polynuclear complexes containing a trinuclear Cu, Ag, or Au core in combination with the  fac  &#8208;isomer of the metalloligand [Ru(pypzH)  3  ](PF  6  )  2  (pypzH = 3&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)pyrazole). These (in case of the Ag and Au containing species) newly synthesized compounds of the general formula [{Ru(pypz)  3  }  2  M  3  ](PF  6  ) (  2  : M = Cu;  3  : M = Ag;  4  : M = Au) contain triple&#8208;stranded helical structures in which two ruthenium moieties are connected by three N&#8211;M&#8211;N (M = Cu, Ag, Au) bridges. In order to obtain a detailed description of the structure both in the electronic ground and excited states, extensive spectroscopic and quantum chemical calculations are applied.

      <title>Unexpected Vulnerability of DPEphos to C&#8208;O Activation in the Presence of Nucleophilic Metal Hydrides</title>
      <dc:description>C&#8208;O bond activation of DPEphos occurs upon mild heating in the presence of [Ru(NHC) 2 (PPh 3 ) 2 H 2 ] (NHC = N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene) to form phosphinophenolate products. When NHC = IEt 2 Me 2 C&#8208;O activation is accompanied by C&#8208;N activation of an NHC ligand to yield a coordinated N&#8208;phosphino&#8208;functionalised carbene. DFT calculations define a nucleophilic mechanism in which a hydride ligand attacks the aryl carbon of the DPEphos C&#8208;O bond. This is promoted by the strongly donating NHC ligands which render a trans dihydride intermediate featuring highly nucleophilic hydride ligands accessible. C&#8208;O bond activation also occurs upon heating cis &#8208;[Ru(DPEphos) 2 H 2] . DFT calculations suggest this reaction is promoted by the steric encumbrance associated with two bulky DPEphos ligands. Our observations that facile degradation of the DPEphos ligand via C&#8208;O bond activation is possible under relatively mild reaction conditions has potential ramifications for the use of this ligand in high temperature catalysis.</dc:description>

      <title>Carbon Monoxide Coupling Reactions: A New Concept for the Formation of Hexahydroxybenzene</title>
      <dc:description>Abstract:  For linear and cyclic coupling reactions of CO among others products the formation of the hexapotassium salt of hexahydroxybenzene is in particular interesting. The interaction of metallic potassium and CO offers  via  the assumed K[OC&#8801;CO]K as the result of several carbon monoxide coupling reactions the formation of C  6  (OK)  6  among other products.

It is expected that the presence of transition metal impurities would promote the reaction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <dc:description>The precise regulation, nucleation growth and assembly of polymers is still an intriguing goal but an enormous challenge. In this study, we proposed a pre&#8208;polymerization strategy to regulate the assembly and growth of porphyrin polymers by facile controlling the concentration of polymerization initiator, and thus obtained two kinds of different nanosheet&#8208;based polymer materials using tetrakis&#8208;5,10,15,20&#8208;(4&#8208;aminophenyl) porphyrin (TAPP) as the precursor. Notably, due to the &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking and doping of TAPP during the preparation process, the obtained PTAPP&#8208;Nanocubes material exhibits a high intrinsic bulk conductivity reaching 1.49 &#215; 10  &#8208;4  S m  &#8208;1  . Profiting from the large &#960;&#8208;conjugated structure of porphyrin units, closely&#8208;stacked layer structure and excellent conductivity, the resultant porphyrin polymers, as electrode materials for lithium ion batteries, deliver high specific capacity (~ 650 mA h g  &#8208;1  at the current density of 100 mA g  &#8208;1  ), excellent rate performance and stable long&#8208;cycle performance, which are among the best record for porphyrin polymer&#8208;based as electrode materials for lithium ion battery, to the best of our knowledge.

      <title>Resonance Assisted Hydrogen Bonding Phenomenon Unveiled from Both Experiment and Theory &#8211; an Example of New Family of Ethyl N&#8208;salicylideneglycinate Dyes</title>
      <dc:description>We report extensive experimental and theoretical investigations on the nature of resonance assisted hydrogen bonding phenomenon (RAHB) and its influence on photophysical and thermochromic properties of the newly designed dyes differing in donor&#8208;acceptor properties: ethyl  N  &#8208;salicylideneglycinate (  1  ), ethyl  N  &#8208;(5&#8208;methoxysalicylidene)glycinate (  2  ), ethyl  N  &#8208;(5&#8208;bromosalicylidene)glycinate (  3  ) and ethyl  N  &#8208;(5&#8208;nitrosalicylidene)glycinate (  4  ). It is unveiled, that the magnitude of RAHB effect fine tunes the strength of the O&#8211;H&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;N bonding and accordingly the relative populations of the enol,  cis  &#8208;keto and  trans  &#8208;keto forms leading to variation of the photophysical properties of  1&#8211;4  . It is determined, that the electron&#8208;withdrawing NO  2  in  4  amplifies the most RAHB effect causing the breaking of the O&#8211;H&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;N hydrogen bond and accordingly formation of the dominant  cis  &#8208;keto isomer in both the solid state and EtOH. To this end, the UV&#8208;vis spectra of  1&#8211;3  in EtOH revealed the exclusive presence of the enol form, while the prevalent contribution of the  cis  &#8208;keto form was found for  4  . Furthermore, only compound  4  is emissive in the solid state in ambient condition due to dual emission arising from the  cis  &#8208;keto* and  trans  &#8208;keto* forms, while  2  was found to be highly emissive in EtOH. It is revealed, based on the ETS&#8208;NOCV and EDDB methods, that RAHB is based on electrons pumping or sucking through both the &#960;&#8208; and &#963;&#8208;channels, what accordingly exerts chemical bonding changes at both the phenyl ring and predominantly a distant O&#8211;H&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;N area.</dc:description>

      <title>An iterative divergent approach to conjugated starburst borane dendrimers</title>
      <dc:description>Using a new divergent approach, conjugated triarylborane dendrimers were synthesized up to the 2  nd  generation. The synthetic strategy consists of three steps: 1) functionalization, via iridium catalyzed C&#8211;H borylation; 2) activation, via fluorination of the generated boronate ester with K[HF  2  ]  or  [N(  n  Bu  4  )][HF  2  ]  ;  and 3) expansion, via reaction of the trifluoroborate salts with aryl Grignard reagents. The concept was also shown to be viable for a convergent approach. All but one of the conjugated borane dendrimers exhibit multiple, distinct and reversible reduction potentials, making them potentially interesting materials for applications in molecular accumulators. Based on their photophysical properties, the 1  st  generation dendrimers exhibit good conjugation over the whole system. However, the conjugation does not further increase upon expansion to the 2  nd  generation, but the molar extinction coefficients increase linearly with the number of triarylborane sub&#8208;units, suggesting a potential application as photonic antennas.</dc:description>

      <title>One Terminal Guanosine Flip of Intramolecular Parallel G&#8208;quadruplex: Catalytic Enhancement of G&#8208;quadruplex/Hemin DNAzymes</title>
      <dc:description>Numerous studies have shown compelling evidences that incorporation of an inversion of polarity site (IPS) in G&#8208;rich sequences can affect the topological and structural characteristics of G&#8208;quadruplexes (G4s). Herein, we explore the influence of IPS on the formation of previously studied intramolecular parallel G4 of d(G3TG3TG3TG3) (TTT) and its stacked higher&#8208;order structures. Insertion of 3'&#8208;3' or 5'&#8208;5' IPS did not change the parallel folding pattern of TTT. However, both the species and position of IPS in TTT have a significant impact on the G4 stability and end&#8208;stacking via the alteration of G4&#8208;G4 interfaces properties. Our data demonstrate that one base flip in each terminal G&#8208;tetrad can stabilize parallel G4s and facilitate intermolecular packing of monomeric G4s. Such modifications can also enhance fluorescence and enzymatic performances by promoting interactions between parallel G4s with N&#8208;methyl mesoporphyrin IX (NMM) and hemin, respectively.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>The fundamental concept of effective molarity is observed in a variety of biological processes such as protein compartmentalization within organelles, membrane localization and signaling paths. To control molecular encountering and promote effective interactions, Nature places biomolecules in specific sites inside the cell in order to generate a high, localized concentration different from the bulk concentration.

      <dc:description>The oxidation of  cis  &#8208;[Pt(NH  3  )  2  (OAc)  2  ] with H  2  O  2  yields a mixture of two isomers:  ctc  &#8208;[Pt(NH  3  )  2  (OH)  2  (OAc)  2  ] and  ctc  &#8208;[Pt(NH  3  )  2  (OH)(OAc)(OH)(OAc)]. Following modification with phenylbutyric anhydride, two isomers were separated and characterized; the symmetric  ctc  &#8208;[Pt(NH  3  )  2  (PhB)  2  (OAc)  2  ] and the non&#8208;symmetric  ctc  &#8208;[Pt(NH  3  )  2  (PhB)(OAc)(PhB)(OAc)]. They differ in their logP values and despite having similar cellular uptake and similar DNA platination levels, the symmetric  ctc  &#8208;[Pt(NH  3  )  2  (OH)  2  (OAc)  2  ] is more than 4 fold more potent than the non&#8208;symmetric isomer in a panel of 4 cancer cell lines.</dc:description>

      <title>Solvent&#8208;dependent growth and stabilization mechanisms of surfactant&#8208;free colloidal Pt nanoparticles</title>
      <dc:description>Understanding the formation of nanoparticles (NPs) is key to develop materials via sustainable routes. The Co4Cat TM process is a new synthesis of precious metal NPs in alkaline mono&#8208;alcohols well&#8208;suited to develop active nanocatalysts. The synthesis is &#8216;facile&#8217;, surfactant&#8208;free and performed under mild conditions like low temperature. Interestingly, this process is sensitive to parameters masked in other colloidal syntheses. The oxidation properties of the solvent are here shown to strongly influence the formation of Pt NPs. Based on the in situ formation of CO adsorbed on the NP surface by solvent oxidation, a model is proposed that accounts for the different growth and stabilization mechanisms as well as re&#8208;dispersion properties of the surfactant&#8208;free NPs in different solvents. Using in situ and ex situ characterizations, it is established that in methanol, a slow nucleation with a limited NP growth is achieved.

      <title>Transition of 2&#8208;D to 3&#8208;D SBA&#8208;15 by high temperature fluoride addition and its impact on the surface reactivity probed by isopropanol conversion</title>
      <dc:description>We report on a systematic variation of the SBA&#8208;15 synthesis conditions and its impact on the structural and chemical characteristics. An incremental alteration of the hydrothermal aging temperature and time was used to induce first changes of the highly ordered SBA&#8208;15 structure. Any effects on the total surface area, mesopores size, micropore contributions and pore connectivity are amplified by a combined incremental increase of the NH  4  F concentration. Based on changes of the unit cell parameter as a function of the mesopore size, and a feature in the low angle XRD, useful descriptors for the disorder of the corresponding SBA&#8208;15 are identified. An additional analysis of the BET surface area and pore size distributions enables investigations on the structural integrity of the material. Our systematic approach evidences&#160; the identification of coherencies between the evolutions of physical SBA&#8208;15 properties. The obtained correlations of the surface and structural characteristics allow to discriminate between highly ordered 2&#8208;D SBA&#8208;15, disordered 3&#8208;D SBA&#8208;15 and highly nonuniform silica fractions with mainly amorphous character.

      <title>Binding site switch by dispersion interactions: rotational signatures of fenchone&#8208;phenol and fenchone&#8208;benzene complexes</title>
      <dc:description>Non&#8208;covalent interactions between molecules determine molecular recognition and the outcome of chemical and biological processes. Characterising how non&#8208;covalent interactions influence binding preferences is of crucial importance in advancing our understanding of these events. Here we analyse interactions involved in smell and specifically the effect of changing the balance between hydrogen bonding and dispersion by examining the complexes of the common odorant fenchone with phenol and benzene, mimics of tyrosine and phenylalanine residues, respectively. Using rotational spectroscopy and quantum chemistry, two isomers of each complex have been identified. Our results show that the increased weight of dispersion in these complexes changes the preferred binding site in fenchone and sets the basis for a better understanding of the effect of different residues in molecular recognition and binding events.</dc:description>

      <title>Molecular Bismuth Cations: Assessment of Soft Lewis Acidity</title>
      <dc:description>Three&#8208;coordinate cationic bismuth compounds [Bi(diaryl)(EPMe3)][SbF6] have been isolated and fully characterized (diaryl = [(C6H4)2C2H2]2&#8211;, E = S, Se). They represent rare examples of molecular complexes with Bi&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;EPR3 interactions (R = monoanionic substituent). The 31P NMR chemical shift of EPMe3 has been found to be sensitive to the formation of LA&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;EPMe3 Lewis acid/base interactions (LA = Lewis acid). This corresponds to a modification of the Gutmann&#8208;Beckett method and reveals information about the hardness/softness of the Lewis acid under investigation. A series of organobismuth compounds, bismuth halides, and cationic bismuth species have been investigated with this approach and compared to traditional group 13 and cationic group 14 Lewis acids. Especially cationic bismuth species have been shown to be potent soft Lewis acids that may prefer Lewis pair formation with a soft (S/Se&#8208;based) rather than a hard (O/N&#8208;based) donor.

      <title>Chemical Profiling of A&#8208;to&#8208;I RNA Editing Using a Click&#8208;Compatible Phenylacrylamide</title>
      <dc:description>Straightforward methods for detecting adenosine&#8208;to&#8208;inosine (A&#8208;to&#8208;I) RNA editing are key to better understanding its regulation, function, and connection with disease. We address this need by developing a novel reagent,  N  &#8208;(4&#8208;ethynylphenyl)acrylamide (EPhAA), and illustrating its ability to selectively label inosine in RNA. EPhAA is synthesized in a single step, reacts rapidly with inosine, and is &#8220;click&#8221;&#8208;compatible, enabling flexible attachment of fluorescent probes at editing sites. We first validate EPhAA reactivity and selectivity for inosine in both ribonucleosides and RNA substrates, and then apply our approach to directly monitor  in vitro  A&#8208;to&#8208;I RNA editing activity using recombinant ADAR enzymes. This method improves upon existing inosine chemical labeling techniques and provides a cost&#8208;effective, rapid, and non&#8208;radioactive approach for detecting inosine formation in RNA. We envision this method will improve study of A&#8208;to&#8208;I editing and enable better characterization of RNA modification patterns in different settings.</dc:description>

      <title>Halogen Bonded Assemblies of Arylene&#8208;imides and &#8208;diimides: Insight from Electronic, Structural and Computational studies</title>
      <dc:description>Halogen bonding interactions in electron deficient  &#960;  &#8208;scaffolds has largely been underexplored. Herein, we have studied the halogen bonding properties of arylene&#8208;imide/&#8208;diimide&#8208;based electron deficient scaffolds. We probed the influence of: scaffold size, e.g. from small phthalimide (PTMI), moderately&#8208;sized pyromelliticdiimide (PMDI) or naphthalenediimides (NDIs) to large perylenediimide (PDI); axial&#8208;group modifications; varied number of halogens, etc. on the halogen bonding and its self&#8208;assembly in a set of nine molecules. The structural modification leads to tunable optical as well as redox property. The first reduction potential, E  1  1/2  range between &#8208;1.09 to &#8208;0.17 V (vs SCE). Two of the molecules, e.g.  6  and  9  embrace deep&#8208;lying LUMOs with values reaching &#8208;4.2 eV. Gratifyingly, we realized single crystals of all the nine systems, which revealed Br&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;O, Br&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;Br or Br&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;  &#960;  halogen bonding interactions, with few systems capable of forming all the three&#8208;types. These interactions lead to halogen bonded rings (up to 12&#8208;membered), which propagate to form stacked 1D&#8208;, 2D&#8208; or corrugated sheets. We also identified few outliers, e.g. molecule which prefer C&#8208;H&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;O hydrogen bonding over halogen bonding; or a non&#8208;centrosymmetric organization over the centrosymmetric ones. Computational studies based on Atoms in Molecules (AIM) and Natural Bond Orbital (NBO) analysis provided further insight into the halogen bonding interactions. This study can lead to a predictive design tool&#8208;box to further explore related systems on surfaces reinforced by these weak directional forces.</dc:description>

      <title>Redox&#8208;Active Supramolecular Heteroleptic M4L2L&#8217;2 Assemblies with Tunable Interior Binding Site</title>
      <dc:description>Three  Pt  4  L  2  L&#8217;  2  heteroleptic rectangles (  1  &#8208;  3  ), containing ditopic redox&#8208;active bis&#8208;pyridine functionalized perylene bisimide (PBI) ligands  PBI&#8208;pyr  2  (  L  ) are reported. Co&#8208;ligand  L&#8217;  is a dicarboxylate spacer of varying length, leading to modified overall size of the assemblies.  1  H NMR spectroscopy reveals a trend in the splitting and upfield chemical shift of the PBI&#8208;hydrogens in the rectangles with respect to free PBI, most pronounced with the largest strut length (  3  ) and least with the smallest strut length (  1  ). This is attributed to increased rotational freedom of the  PBI&#8208;pyr  2  ligand over its longitudinal axis (N  py  &#8208;N  py  ), due to increased distance between the PBI&#8208;surfaces, which is corroborated by VT&#8208;NMR measurements and DFT calculations. The intramolecular motion entails desymmetrization of the two PBI&#8208;ligands, in line with cyclic voltammetry (CV) data. The first (overall two&#8208;electron) reduction event and re&#8208;oxidation for  1  display a subtle peak&#8208;to&#8208;peak splitting of 60 mV, whilst increased splitting of this event is observed for  2  and  3  . The binding of pyrene in  1  is probed to establish proof of concept of host&#8208;guest chemistry enabled by the two PBI&#8208;motifs. Fitting the binding curve obtained by  1  H NMR titration with a 1:1 complex formation model led to a binding constant of 964 &#177; 55 M  &#8208;1  . Pyrene binding is shown to directly influence the redox&#8208;chemistry of  1  , resulting in a cathodic and anodic shift of approximately 46 mV on the first and second reduction event, respectively.</dc:description>

      <title>Self&#8208;Assembly Propensity Dictates Lifetimes in Transient Naphthalimide&#8208;dipeptide Nanofibers</title>
      <dc:description>We present transient self&#8208;assembly of dipeptide nanofibers with lifetimes that are predictably variable through dipeptide sequence design. This is achieved using 1,8&#8208;Naphthalimide (NI)&#8208; amino acid methyl&#8208;esters (Phe, Tyr, Leu) that are biocatalytically coupled to amino acid&#8208;amides (Phe, Tyr, Leu, Val, Ala, Ser) to form self&#8208;assembling NI&#8208;dipeptides. However, competing hydrolysis of the dipeptides results in disassembly. We demonstrate that the kinetic parameters like lifetimes of these nanofibers can be predictably regulated by the thermodynamic parameter, namely the self&#8208;assembly propensity of the constituent dipeptide sequence. These lifetimes could vary from minutes, to hours, to permanent gels that do not degrade. Moreover, the in&#8208;built NI fluorophore was utilized to image the transient nanostructures in solution with stimulated emission depletion (STED) based on super&#8208;resolution fluorescence microscopy.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Herein we present a comprehensive study of highly oxidized multiple&#8208;decker complexes composed of Tb(III) and Cd(II) ions and two to five phthalocyaninato ligands, which are stabilized by electron&#8208;donating n &#8208;butoxy groups.

In addition, unusual coexistence of square antiprism and square prism geometries around metal ions was observed in +4 e charged species. From paramagnetic 1 H NMR studies on the resulting series of triple, quadruple and quintuple&#8208;decker complexes, ligand oxidation leads to a decrease in the magnetic anisotropy, as predicted from theoretical calculations. Unusual paramagnetic shifts were observed in the spectra of the +2 e charged quadruple and quintuple&#8208;decker complexes, indicating that those two species are actually unexpected triplet biradicals.

      <title>Tetrahydroimidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyrazine Derivatives: Synthesis and Evaluation As G&#945;q&#8208;Protein Ligands</title>
      <dc:description>The 5,6,7,8&#8208;tetrahydroimidazo[1,2&#8208;  a  ]pyrazine derivative BIM&#8208;46174 and its dimeric form BIM&#8208;46187 (  1  ) are heterocyclized dipeptides that belong to the very few cell&#8208;permeable compounds known to preferentially silence G&#945;  q  proteins. To explore the chemical space of G&#945;  q  inhibitors of the BIM chemotype, a combinatorial approach was conducted towards a library of BIM molecules. This library was evaluated in a second messenger&#8208;based fluorescence assay to analyze the activity of G&#945;  q  proteins through the determination of intracellular  myo  &#8208;inositol 1&#8208;phosphate. Structure&#8208;activity relationships were deduced and structural requirements for biological activity obtained, which were (i) a redoxreactive thiol/disulfane substructure, (ii) an  N  &#8208;terminal basic amino group, (iii) a cyclohexylalanine moiety, and (iv) a bicyclic skeleton. Active compounds exhibited cellular toxicity, which was investigated in detail for the prototypical inhibitor  1  . This compound affects the structural cytoskeletal dynamics in a G&#945;  q/11  &#8208;independent manner.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The 5,6,7,8&#8208;tetrahydroimidazo[1,2&#8208;  a  ]pyrazine derivative BIM&#8208;46174 and its dimeric form BIM&#8208;46187 (  1  ) are heterocyclized dipeptides that belong to the very few cell&#8208;permeable compounds known to preferentially silence G&#945;  q  proteins. To explore the chemical space of G&#945;  q  inhibitors of the BIM chemotype, a combinatorial approach was conducted towards a library of BIM molecules. This library was evaluated in a second messenger&#8208;based fluorescence assay to analyze the activity of G&#945;  q  proteins through the determination of intracellular  myo  &#8208;inositol 1&#8208;phosphate. Structure&#8208;activity relationships were deduced and structural requirements for biological activity obtained, which were (i) a redoxreactive thiol/disulfane substructure, (ii) an  N  &#8208;terminal basic amino group, (iii) a cyclohexylalanine moiety, and (iv) a bicyclic skeleton. Active compounds exhibited cellular toxicity, which was investigated in detail for the prototypical inhibitor  1  . This compound affects the structural cytoskeletal dynamics in a G&#945;  q/11  &#8208;independent manner.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Thermo&#8208;Sensitive Dual&#8208;Functional Nanospheres with Enhanced Lubrication and Drug Delivery for the Treatment of Osteoarthritis</title>
      <dc:description>Osteoarthritis is a typical degenerative joint disease related with lubrication deficiency of articular cartilage, which is characterized by increased friction at joint surface and severe inflammation of joint capsule. Consequently, a therapy combining lubrication restoration and drug intervention is regarded as a promising strategy for the treatment of osteoarthritis. In the present study, we developed thermo&#8208;sensitive dual&#8208;functional nanospheres, poly[N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide&#8208;2&#8208;methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine] (PNIPAM&#8208;PMPC), via emulsion polymerization. The PNIPAM&#8208;PMPC nanospheres could enhance lubrication based on the hydration lubrication mechanism by forming a tenacious hydration layer surrounding the zwitterionic headgroups, and achieve local drug delivery via encapsulating an anti&#8208;inflammatory drug of diclofenac sodium. The lubrication and drug release tests showed improved lubrication and thermo&#8208;sensitive drug release of the nanospheres. The  in vitro  test using cytokines&#8208;treated chondrocytes indicated that the PNIPAM&#8208;PMPC nanospheres were biocompatible and upregulated anabolic genes while simultaneously downregulated catabolic genes of the articular cartilage. In summary, the developed PNIPAM&#8208;PMPC nanospheres, with the property of enhanced lubrication and local drug delivery, can be an effective nanomedicine for the treatment of osteoarthritis.</dc:description>

      <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of Mitochondria&#8208;Targeted Photosensitizer to Increase Photostability and Photodynamic Therapeutic Efficacy in Hypoxia</title>
      <dc:description>The development of photosensitizers for cancer photodynamic therapy has been challenging due to&#160;their&#160;low photostability and therapeutic inefficacy in hypoxic tumor microenvironments. To overcome these issues, we developed a mitochondria&#8208;targeted photosensitizer consisting of an indocyanine moiety with triphenylphosphonium arms, which can self&#8208;assemble into spherical micelles directed to mitochondria. Self&#8208;assembly of the photosensitizer resulted in a higher photostability by preventing free rotation of the indoline ring of the indocyanine moiety. The mitochondria targeting capability of the photosensitizer allowed it to utilize intramitochondrial oxygen. We found that the mitochondria&#8208;targeted photosensitizer localized to mitochondria and induced apoptosis of cancer cells&#160;both normoxic and hypoxic&#160;conditions through generation of ROS. The micellar self&#8208;assemblies&#160;of the&#160;photosensitizer were further confirmed to selectively localize to tumor tissues in a xenograft tumor mouse model through passive targeting and showed efficient tumor growth inhibition.</dc:description>

      <title>Phase transition and band gap regulated by halogen substitute of organic cation in organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid perovskite semiconductor</title>
      <dc:description>Since the last decade, hybrid materials have received widespread attention. Especially, hybrid lead&#8208;halide perovskite&#8208;type semiconductors are the most attractive due to their great flexibility in band gap engineering. Here, using precise molecular modifications, we designed and obtained three one&#8208;dimensional perovskite&#8208;type semiconductor materials: [Me  3  PCH  2  X][PbBr  3  ] (X=H, F and Cl for compounds  1  ,  2  and  3  , respectively). The introduction of heavier halogen atom (F or Cl) to [Me  4  P]  +  increases the potential energy barrier required for the tumbling motion of the cation, hence achieving the transformation of the phase transition temperature from low temperature (192 K) to room temperature (285 K) and high temperature (402.3 K). Moreover, the optical band gaps reveal a broadening trend with 3.176 eV, 3.215 eV and 3.376 eV along the H&#8594;F&#8594;Cl series, which is attributed to the formation of the structural distortion.</dc:description>

      <title>Atomic&#8208;Scale Description of Interfaces between Antigen and Aluminum&#8208;Based Adjuvants used in Vaccines by DNP Enhanced NMR Spectroscopy</title>
      <dc:description>The addition of aluminum&#8208;based adjuvants in vaccines enhances the immune response to antigens. The strength of antigen adsorption on adjuvant gels is known to modulate vaccine efficacy. However, a detailed understanding of the mechanisms of interaction between Al&#8208; gels and antigens is still missing. Here, we implement a new analytical approach based on Dynamic Nuclear Polarization (DNP) enhanced NMR spectroscopy under Magic Angle Spinning (MAS) to provide a molecular description of antigen&#8208;adjuvant interface. This approach is demonstrated on Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) particles in combination with three Al&#8208;gels obtained from different suppliers. Both non&#8208;covalent and covalent interactions between the phospholipids of the antigen particles and the surface of the Al&#8208;gels are identified by using MAS DNP NMR 27 Al and 31 P correlation experiments. While covalent interactions were detected for only one of the formulations, dipolar recoupling REAPDOR experiments reveal significant differences in the strength of weak interactions.</dc:description>

      <title>The Underlying Chemistry to Formation of Phosphoryl Radicals from Organophosphorus Compounds &#8208; A Missing Puzzle Piece in the Flame Chemistry</title>
      <dc:description>Reactive species such as &#8729;PO  2  and HOPO are considered of upmost importance in flame inhibition and catalytic combustion processes of fuels. However, the underlying chemistry of their formation remains speculative due to the unavailability of suitable analytical techniques which can identify the transient species that lead to their formation. This study elucidates the reaction mechanisms of formation of phosphoryl species from dimethyl methyl phosphonate (DMMP) and dimethyl phosphoramidate (DMPR) under well&#8208;defined oxidative conditions. Photoelectron photoion coincidence techniques utilizing vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) synchrotron radiation were applied to isomer&#8208;selectively detect the elusive key intermediates and stable products. With the help of in&#8208;situ recorded spectral fingerprints different transient species, such as PO  2  and triplet O radicals, have been exclusively identified from their isomeric components, which helped piece together the formation mechanisms of phosphoryl species under various conditions. It was found that &#183;PO  2  requires oxidative conditions above 1070 K. The combined presence of O  2  and H  2  led to significant changes in the decomposition chemistry of both model phosphorus compounds leading to the formation of &#183;PO  2  . The reaction &#183;PO + O  2  &#8594; &#183;PO  2  + &#183;O&#183; was identified as the key step in the formation of &#183;PO  2  . Interestingly, the presence of O  2  in DMPR thermolysis, suppresses formation of PN containing species.</dc:description>

      <title>Dynamic PdII/CuI multimetallic assemblies as molecular models to study metal&#8208;metal cooperation in Sonogashira coupling</title>
      <dc:description>Cooperation between two different metals plays a crucial role in many synergistic catalytic reactions such as the Sonogashira C&#8208;C cross&#8208;coupling reaction, where an interaction between the Pd and Cu centers is proposed in the transmetallation step.

In this work, we report a stepwise and systematic approach to building heteromultimetallic Pd/Cu assemblies as a tool to study metal&#8208;metal cooperativity. We obtained fully characterized Pd/Cu multimetallic assemblies that show reactivity in alkyne activation, formation of catalytically relevant aryl/acetylide species, and C&#8208;C elimination, serving as functional models for Sonogashira reaction intermediates.

      <title>Synthesis of heterocycles through denitrogenative cyclization of triazoles and benzotriazoles</title>
      <dc:description>During the past decades there has been considerable growth in the development of denitrogenative reactions of triazole skeletons to construct valuable cyclic compounds, particularly heterocycles. Despite the inherent difficulty of the ring opening of triazole derivatives, many novel and efficient approaches are arising in this area mainly with the use of transition metal (such as rhodium, palladium, silver, copper) catalysis, photolysis or free radical mediated. Generally, these procedures begin with the ring opening of 1,2,3&#8208;triazoles or benzotriazoles followed by N  2  extrusion and subsequent diverse transformations, which enable the rapid synthesis of various heterocycles in a single step. To avoid overlap with other related reviews, this minireview covers the recent advances in the denitrogenative cyclization of 1,2,3&#8208;triazoles since 2016 and the denitrogenative cyclization of benzotriazoles since 2012.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Strong metal&#8208;support interaction of supported metal catalysts is an important concept to describe the effect of metal&#8208;support interaction on structures and catalytic performances of supported metal particles. Using an example of CeO  x  adlayers supported on Ag nanocrystals, we herein put forward a concept of electronic&#160;oxide&#8208;metal strong interaction (EOMSI) that significantly affects electronic structures of oxide adlayers via the metal&#8208;to&#8208;oxide charge transfer. The EOMSI&#160;can stabilize oxide adlayers in a low&#8208;oxidation state under an ambient condition, which individually is not stable; moreover, the oxide adlayers experiencing the EOMSI&#160;are resistant to high temperature oxidation in air to certain an extent.

      <title>Flexibility of the CueR Metal Site Probed by Instantaneous Change of Element and Oxidation State from AgI to CdII</title>
      <dc:description>
Relax: AgI activates the transcriptional regulatory protein CueR, while CdII does not activate CueR. In this work the fact that 111Ag decays to 111Cd is exploited, to elucidate the subsequent relaxation at the metal site from transcriptional activator to repressor by PAC spectroscopy. Considerable metal site flexibility is observed, and it is hypothesized that this is relevant to the function of CueR.







Abstract
Selectivity for monovalent metal ions is an important facet of the function of the metalloregulatory protein CueR. 111Ag perturbed angular correlation of &#947;&#8208;rays (PAC) spectroscopy probes the metal site structure and the relaxation accompanying the instantaneous change from AgI to CdII upon 111Ag radioactive decay. That is, a change from AgI, which activates transcription, to CdII, which does not. In the frozen state (&#8722;196&#8201;&#176;C) two nuclear quadrupole interactions (NQIs) are observed; one (NQI1) agrees well with two coordinating thiolates and an additional longer contact to the S77 backbone carbonyl, and the other (NQI2) reflects that CdII has attracted additional ligand(s). At 1&#8201;&#176;C only NQI2 is observed, demonstrating that relaxation to this structure occurs within &#8776;10&#8197;ns of the decay of 111Ag. Thus, transformation from AgI to CdII rapidly disrupts the functional linear bis(thiolato)AgI metal site structure. This inherent metal site flexibility may be central to CueR function, leading to remodelling into a non&#8208;functional structure upon binding of non&#8208;cognate metal ions. In a broader perspective, 111Ag PAC spectroscopy may be applied to probe the flexibility of protein metal sites.

      <title>Kinetics and Mechanism of Cation&#8208;Induced Guest Release from Cucurbit[7]uril</title>
      <dc:description>
Contrasting mechanisms: Stopped&#8208;flow studies on the release of two organic guests from cucurbit[7]uril (CB7) in aqueous solutions of inorganic salts revealed two contrasting mechanisms. Whereas metal cations Mn+ promote the release of berberine (B+) from CB7 in a multistep process, the expulsion of dicationic dye 2,7&#8208;dimethyldiazapyrenium has a simpler mechanism.







Abstract
The release of two organic guests from cucurbit[7]uril (CB7) was selectively monitored by the stopped&#8208;flow method in aqueous solutions of inorganic salts to reveal the mechanistic picture in detail. Two contrasting mechanisms were identified: The symmetric dicationic 2,7&#8208;dimethyldiazapyrenium shows a cation&#8208;independent complex dissociation mechanism coupled to deceleration of the ingression in the presence of alkali and alkaline earth cations (Mn+) due to competitive formation of CB7&#8211;Mn+ complexes. A much richer, unprecedented kinetic behaviour was observed for the ingression and egression of the monocationic and non&#8208;symmetric berberine (B+). The formation of ternary complex B+&#8211;CB7&#8211;Mn+ was unambiguously revealed. A difference of more than two orders of magnitude was found in the equilibrium constants of Mn+ binding to B+&#8211;CB7 inclusion complex. Large cations, such as K+ and Ba2+, also promoted B+ expulsion from the ternary complex in a bimolecular process. This study reveals a previously hidden mechanistic picture and motivates systematic kinetic investigations of other host&#8211;guest systems.

      <dc:description>Arylazopyrazoles are an emerging class of photoswitches with red&#8208;shifted switching wavelength, high photostationary state, long thermal half&#8208;lives and facile synthetic access. Understanding pathways for a simple modulation of the thermal half&#8208;lives, while keeping other parameters of interest constant, is an important aspect for out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium systems design and application. Here, we demonstrate that the thermal half&#8208;life of a water&#8208;soluble, PEG&#8208;tethered arylazo&#8208;bis(o&#8208;methylated)pyrazole (AAP) can be tuned by more than five orders of magnitude using simple pH adjustment, which is beyond the tunability of azobenzenes. The mechanism of thermal relaxation is investigated by thorough spectroscopic analyses and density function theory (DFT) calculations. Finally, we transfer the concepts of a tunable half&#8208;life from the molecular scale to the material scale. Based on the photochromic characteristics of E&#8208; and Z&#8208;AAP, we showcase transient information storage in form of light&#8208;written patterns inside films cast from different pH, which in turn leads to different times of storage. With respect to prospective precisely tunable materials and time&#8208;programmed out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium systems, an externally tunable half&#8208;life is likely advantageous over changing the entire system by the replacement of the photoswitch.</dc:description>

      <title>Synthesis and Characterization of Thiophene&#8208;based Donor&#8211;Acceptor&#8211;Donor Heptameric Ligands for Spectral Assignment of Polymorphic Amyloid&#8208;&#946; Deposits</title>
      <dc:description>
Head or tail: Distinct periodicity of anionic charges along the conjugated backbone is an important chemical determinant for achieving thiophene&#8208;based donor&#8211;acceptor&#8211;donor heptameric ligands for spectral assignment of different amyloid&#8208;&#946; deposits. Having the acetate side chains of the central trimeric thiophene&#8208;BTD&#8208;thiophene unit tail&#8208;to&#8208;tail instead of head&#8208;to&#8208;head greatly reduced the ability of the ligand to distinguish A&#946; morphotypes.







Abstract
Protein deposits are associated with many devastating diseases and fluorescent ligands able to visualize these pathological entities are essential. Here, we report the synthesis of thiophene&#8208;based donor&#8211;acceptor&#8211;donor heptameric ligands that can be utilized for spectral assignment of distinct amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) aggregates, one of the pathological hallmarks in Alzheimer's disease. The ability of the ligands to selectively distinguish A&#946; deposits was abolished when the chemical composition of the ligands was altered. Our findings provide the structural and functional basis for the development of new fluorescent ligands that can distinguish between aggregated proteinaceous species consisting of the same peptide or protein. In addition, such ligands might aid in interpreting the potential role of polymorphic A&#946; deposits in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.

      <title>Surface&#8208;Deactivated Core&#8211;Shell Metal&#8211;Organic Framework by Simple Ligand Exchange for Enhanced Size Discrimination in Aerobic Oxidation of Alcohols</title>
      <dc:description>
Site control: Removing catalytic sites near the surface of the MOF crystal allowed for enhanced size discrimination of the reactants thus improving selectivity.







Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are an attractive catalyst support for stable immobilization of the active sites in their scaffold due to the high tunability of organic ligands. The active site&#8208;functionalized ligands can be easily employed to construct MOFs as porous heterogeneous catalysts. However, the existence of active sites on the external surfaces as well as internal pores of MOFs seriously impedes the selective reaction in the pore. Herein, through a simple post&#8208;synthetic ligand exchange (PSE) method we synthesized surface&#8208;deactivated (only core&#8208;active) core&#8211;shell&#8208;type MOF catalysts, which contain 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidin&#8208;1&#8208;yl)oxyl (TEMPO) groups on the ligand as active sites for aerobic oxidation of alcohols. The porous but catalytically inactive shell ensured the size&#8208;selective permeability by sieving effects and induced all reactions to take place in the pores of the catalytically active core. Because PSE is a facile and universal approach, this can be rapidly applied to a variety of MOF&#8208;based catalysts for enhancing reaction selectivity.

      <dc:description>
The photoinitiated, radical&#8208;mediated thiol&#8208;ene coupling reaction of unsaturated sugars is shown as a fast, simple and powerful new method for the stereoselective synthesis of a broad variety of thio&#8208;linked glycomimetics. Addition of thiols to 2&#8208;substituted hexoglycals under UV&#8208;irradiation leads to exclusive formation of 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;&#945;&#8208;S&#8208;glycosides independently of the sugar identity and the protecting groups applied. Application of exoglycals or 1&#8208;substituted endoglycals as the alkene partners enables stereoselective formation of 2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;&#946;&#8208;glycosidic and &#946;&#8208;mannosidic structures. Hence, this method can be utilized for the efficient synthesis of stable carbohydrate mimetics, which would be very difficult by the classical ionic methods.

      <title>Frontispiece: Ruthenium&#8208;Induced Cyclization of Heteroatom&#8208;Functionalized Alkynes: Progress, Challenges and Perspectives</title>
      <dc:description>
Ruthenium catalysts for the synthesis of heterocycles: Metal&#8208;induced cyclization of functionalized alkynes represents one of the most general approaches to prepare organic heterocycles. Although RuII centers are well&#8208;established to promote alkyne to vinylidene rearrangements and many RuII&#8208;mediated alkyne cyclizations have been rationalized to be the results of post&#8208;vinylidene transformations, recent discoveries indicate that RuII centers can serve as electrophiles and induce alkyne cyclizations without vinylidene intermediacy. In their Minireview on page&#8197;6102&#8197;ff., C.&#8208;Y.&#8197;Wong et&#8197;al. give an overview of the RuII&#8208;induced cyclization of heteroatom&#8208;functionalized alkynes in the last decade, with an emphasis on the discoveries and validations of the unconventional &#8220;non&#8208;vinylidene&#8208;involving&#8221; pathways.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ruthenium catalysts for the synthesis of heterocycles&lt;/b&gt;: Metal&#8208;induced cyclization of functionalized alkynes represents one of the most general approaches to prepare organic heterocycles. Although Ru&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; centers are well&#8208;established to promote alkyne to vinylidene rearrangements and many Ru&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;mediated alkyne cyclizations have been rationalized to be the results of post&#8208;vinylidene transformations, recent discoveries indicate that Ru&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; centers can serve as electrophiles and induce alkyne cyclizations without vinylidene intermediacy. In their Minireview on &lt;a&gt;https://doi.org/10.1002/chem.201905506page&#8197;6102&#8197;ff.&lt;/a&gt;, C.&#8208;Y.&#8197;Wong et&#8197;al. give an overview of the Ru&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;induced cyclization of heteroatom&#8208;functionalized alkynes in the last decade, with an emphasis on the discoveries and validations of the unconventional &#8220;non&#8208;vinylidene&#8208;involving&#8221; pathways.

      <title>Fabrication of Carbon Nanotube Thin Films for Flexible Transistors by Using a Cross&#8208;Linked Amine Polymer</title>
      <dc:description>
An efficient method for the fabrication of the single&#8208;walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) thin film using cross&#8208;linking methoxycarbonyl polyallylamine (Moc&#8208;PAA) was developed. The amine&#8208;terminated surface of cross&#8208;linked Moc&#8208;PAA enables the formation of the highly dense and uniform thin film of SWCNT networks. The thin film transistor using the fabricated SWCNT film exhibited an excellent performance with a small variability.







Abstract
Owing to their remarkable properties, single&#8208;walled carbon nanotube thin&#8208;film transistors (SWCNT&#8208;TFTs) are expected to be used in various flexible electronics applications. To fabricate SWCNT channel layers for TFTs, solution&#8208;based film formation on a self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAM) covered with amino groups is commonly used. However, this method uses highly oxidized surfaces, which is not suitable for flexible polymeric substrates. In this work, a solution&#8208;based SWCNT film fabrication using methoxycarbonyl polyallylamine (Moc&#8208;PAA) is reported. The NH2&#8208;terminated surface of the cross&#8208;linked Moc&#8208;PAA layer enables the formation of highly dense and uniform SWCNT networks on both rigid and flexible substrates. TFTs that use the fabricated SWCNT thin film exhibited excellent performance with small variations. The presented simple method to access SWCNT thin film accelerates the realization of flexible nanoelectronics.

      <title>Overview of Synthetic Methods to Prepare Plasmonic Transition&#8208;Metal Nitride Nanoparticles</title>
      <dc:description>
Standout stability: The search for plasmonic materials that are low&#8208;cost, chemically and thermally stable, and exhibit low optical losses has attracted significant attention. Among new materials, plasmonic transition&#8208;metal nitride nanostructures are promising non&#8208;noble&#8208;metal alternatives.

Abstract
The search for new plasmonic materials that are low&#8208;cost, chemically and thermally stable, and exhibit low optical losses has garnered significant attention among researchers. Recently, metal nitrides have emerged as promising alternatives to conventional, noble&#8208;metal&#8208;based plasmonic materials, such as silver and gold. Many of the initial studies on metal nitrides have focused on computational prediction of the plasmonic properties of these materials. In recent years, several synthetic methods have been developed to enable empirical analysis. This review highlights synthetic techniques for the preparation of plasmonic metal nitride nanoparticles, which are predominantly free&#8208;standing, by using solid&#8208;state and solid&#8211;gas phase reactions, nonthermal and arc plasma methods, and laser ablation. The physical properties of the nanoparticles, such as shape, size, crystallinity, and optical response, obtained with such synthetic methods are also summarized.

      <title>Exchange&#8208;Biasing in a Dinuclear Dysprosium(III) Single&#8208;Molecule Magnet with a Large Energy Barrier for Magnetisation Reversal
</title>
      <dc:description>
Single&#8208;molecule magnet: A dichlorido&#8208;bridged dinuclear dysprosium(III) single&#8208;molecule magnet shows a new record of energy barrier for magnetisation reversal for polynuclear single&#8208;molecule magnets. Moreover, the zero&#8208;field tunnelling effect is suppressed by exchange&#8208;biasing effect arising from magnetic coupling interactions between the DyIII centres.







Abstract
A dichlorido&#8208;bridged dinuclear dysprosium(III) single&#8208;molecule magnet [Dy2L2(&#956;&#8208;Cl)2(thf)2] has been made by using a diamine&#8208;bis(phenolate) ligand, H2L. Magnetic studies show an energy barrier for magnetisation reversal (Ueff) around 1000&#8197;K. An exchange&#8208;biasing effect is clearly seen in magnetic hysteresis with steps up to 3&#8197;K. Ab initio calculations exclude the possibility of a pure dipolar origin of this effect leading to the conclusion that super&#8208;exchange through the chloride bridging ligands is important.

      <title>On the Limited Stability of BDPA Radicals</title>
      <dc:description>
Instability of BDPA radicals: 1,3&#8208;Bis(diphenylene)&#8208;2&#8208;phenylallyl (BDPA) radicals have limited persistence both in solution and in the solid state. Decomposition in the solid state was found to be due to oxidation while dimer formation is a significant pathway of decomposition in solution (see figure).







Abstract
1,3&#8208;Bis(diphenylene)&#8208;2&#8208;phenylallyl (BDPA)&#8208;based radicals are of interest as polarizing agents for dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP). For this purpose, a BDPA&#8208;nitroxide biradical, employing a phosphodiester linkage, was synthesized. Contrary to what is commonly assumed, BDPA&#8208;derived radicals were observed to have limited stability. Hence, the effects of various factors on the stability of BDPA radicals were investigated. Solvent polarity was found to play a significant role on degradation; a polar BDPA radical was observed to degrade faster in a non&#8208;polar solvent, whereas non&#8208;polar radicals were more unstable in polar solvents. The rate of decomposition was found to increase non&#8208;linearly with increasing radical concentration; a 2&#8208;fold increase in concentration led to a 3&#8208;fold increase in the rate of degradation. Collectively, these results indicate that the dimerization is a significant degradation pathway for BDPA radicals and indeed, a dimer of one BDPA radical was detected by mass spectrometry.

      <title>Enhanced Electrosynthetic Hydrogen Evolution by Hydrogenases Embedded in a Redox&#8208;Active Hydrogel</title>
      <dc:description>
The redox polymer cobaltocene&#8208;functionalized polyallylamine (Cc&#8208;PAA) was utilized to immobilize hydrogenase enzyme on an electrode surface and mediate electron transfer for hydrogen evolution. Cc&#8208;PAA has been found to effectively mediate electron transfer between an electrode and hydrogenases at high specificity and efficiency.







Abstract
Molecular hydrogen is a major high&#8208;energy carrier for future energy technologies, if produced from renewable electrical energy. Hydrogenase enzymes offer a pathway for bioelectrochemically producing hydrogen that is advantageous over traditional platforms for hydrogen production because of low overpotentials and ambient operating temperature and pressure. However, electron delivery from the electrode surface to the enzyme's active site is often rate&#8208;limiting. Here, it is shown that three different hydrogenases from Clostridium pasteurianum and Methanococcus maripaludis, when immobilized at a cathode in a cobaltocene&#8208;functionalized polyallylamine (Cc&#8208;PAA) redox polymer, mediate rapid and efficient hydrogen evolution. Furthermore, it is shown that Cc&#8208;PAA&#8208;mediated hydrogenases can operate at high faradaic efficiency (80&#8211;100&#8201;%) and low apparent overpotential (&#8722;0.578 to &#8722;0.593&#8197;V vs. SHE). Specific activities of these hydrogenases in the electrosynthetic Cc&#8208;PAA assay were comparable to their respective activities in traditional methyl viologen assays, indicating that Cc&#8208;PAA mediates electron transfer at high rates, to most of the embedded enzymes.

      <title>The Development of Vanadyl Phosphate Cathode Materials for Energy Storage Systems: A Review</title>
      <dc:description>
VOPO4 cathodes: Vanadyl phosphate shows great promise as a cathode material for rechargeable batteries and supercapacitors. The electrochemical performance is closely related to the structures of VOPO4 and types of inserted cations. This review presents the polymorphs of vanadyl phosphate materials, their charge storage behaviors, and the related mechanism investigations.







Abstract
Various cathode materials have been proposed for high&#8208;performance rechargeable batteries. Vanadyl phosphate is an important member of the polyanion cathode family. VOPO4 has seven known crystal polymorphs with tunneled or layered frameworks, which allow facile cation (de)intercalations. Two&#8208;electron transfer per formula unit can be realized by using VV/VIV and VIV/VIII redox couples. The electrochemical performance is closely related to the structures of VOPO4 and the types of inserted cations. This Review outlines the crystal structures of VOPO4 polymorphs and their lithiated phases. The research progress of vanadyl phosphate cathode materials for different energy storage systems, including lithium&#8208;ion batteries, sodium&#8208;ion batteries, potassium&#8208;ion batteries, multivalent batteries, and supercapacitors, as well as the related mechanism investigations are summarized. It is hoped that this Review will help with future directions of using vanadyl phosphate materials for energy storage.

      <title>Synthesis and Assembly of Zinc Oxide Microcrystals by a Low&#8208;Temperature Dissolution&#8211;Reprecipitation Process: Lessons Learned About Twin Formation in Heterogeneous Reactions</title>
      <dc:description>
Conversion of cobalt&#8208;doped layered zinc acetate into zinc oxide: Twinning is an often&#8208;observed process during crystallization or mineralization of ZnO. However, if minor Co doping of a precursor is allowed, a twin free formation of highly regular hexagonal platelets of ZnO microcrystals displaying piezoelectric behavior is observed. Tessellation of these crystals by the Langmuir&#8211;Blodgett technique using n&#8208;butanol is possible, albeit only over small areas, if the surface is covered with a polyelectrolyte prior to deposition. This accounts for a subtle charge&#8208;mediated orientation of these crystals on the substrate. More information can be found in the Full Paper by J.&#8197;J. Schneider et&#8197;al.

      <title>Tetrathiafulvalene&#8208;Fused Heterabuckybowl: Protonation&#8208;Induced Electron Transfer and Self&#8208;Sensitized Photooxidation</title>
      <dc:description>
Double donors: Heterabuckybowl trichalcogenasumanene (D1) and tetrathiafulvalene (D2) electron&#8208;donating moieties are fused together through a pyrazine electron&#8208;accepting unit (A) to give a D1&#8211;A&#8211;D2 type fused &#960;&#8208;system. This system shows interesting transient&#8208;state dynamics owing to the electronic interplay between D1 and D2, and exhibits protonation&#8208;induced electron transfer and self&#8208;sensitized photooxidation behavior that can be spectroscopically observed.







Abstract
The electron donor tetrathiafulvalene (D1) was fused onto the electron&#8208;rich heterabuckybowl trichalcogenasumanene (D2) through an electron&#8208;deficient pyrazine unit (A) to give 1&#8201;c, 1&#8201;d, 2&#8201;c, and 2&#8201;d, featuring the D1&#8211;A&#8211;D2 structure. Both D1 and D2 play a pivotal role in intramolecular charge&#8208;transfer (ICT) transitions, consequently 1&#8201;c, 2&#8201;d, 2&#8201;c, and 2&#8201;d show a broad ICT band at 450&#8211;720&#8197;nm in steady state. They exhibit two charge&#8208;separated transient states, CS1 and CS2, that appear in sequence. CS1 has a short lifetime (542&#8197;fs), and the D1 moiety on CS1 is in the radical cation state with an absorption maximum (&#955;max) at 889&#8197;nm. CS1 then converts into CS2 (&#955;max, 1105&#8197;nm) through an ICT between D1.+ and D2, affording D1(1&#8722;&#948;).+ and D2&#948;.+. Compounds 1&#8201;c, 1&#8201;d, 2&#8201;c, and 2&#8201;d show protonation&#8208;induced intramolecular electron transfer that leads to absorption at &#955;=700&#8211;1300&#8197;nm. Owing to the existence of an electron&#8208;rich C=C bond on the D1 moiety and in situ generation of 1O2 by the pyrazine&#8208;fused D2 moiety, compounds 1&#8201;c, 1&#8201;d, 2&#8201;c, and 2&#8201;d display self&#8208;sensitized photooxidation in 50&#8197;s.

     alt="Tetrathiafulvalene&#8208;Fused Heterabuckybowl: Protonation&#8208;Induced Electron Transfer and Self&#8208;Sensitized Photooxidation"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Double donors&lt;/b&gt;: Heterabuckybowl trichalcogenasumanene (D&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) and tetrathiafulvalene (D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) electron&#8208;donating moieties are fused together through a pyrazine electron&#8208;accepting unit (A) to give a D&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&#8211;A&#8211;D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; type fused &#960;&#8208;system. This system shows interesting transient&#8208;state dynamics owing to the electronic interplay between D&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and exhibits protonation&#8208;induced electron transfer and self&#8208;sensitized photooxidation behavior that can be spectroscopically observed.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The electron donor tetrathiafulvalene (D&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) was fused onto the electron&#8208;rich heterabuckybowl trichalcogenasumanene (D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) through an electron&#8208;deficient pyrazine unit (A) to give &lt;b&gt;1&#8201;c&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;1&#8201;d&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;2&#8201;c&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;2&#8201;d&lt;/b&gt;, featuring the D&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&#8211;A&#8211;D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; structure. Both D&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; play a pivotal role in intramolecular charge&#8208;transfer (ICT) transitions, consequently &lt;b&gt;1&#8201;c&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;2&#8201;d&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;2&#8201;c&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;2&#8201;d&lt;/b&gt; show a broad ICT band at 450&#8211;720&#8197;nm in steady state. They exhibit two charge&#8208;separated transient states, CS&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; and CS&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, that appear in sequence. CS&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; has a short lifetime (542&#8197;fs), and the D&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; moiety on CS&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; is in the radical cation state with an absorption maximum (&lt;i&gt;&#955;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;) at 889&#8197;nm. CS&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; then converts into CS&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (&lt;i&gt;&#955;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;, 1105&#8197;nm) through an ICT between D&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;.+&lt;/sup&gt; and D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, affording D&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;(1&#8722;&lt;i&gt;&#948;&lt;/i&gt;).+&lt;/sup&gt; and D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;&#948;&lt;/i&gt;.+&lt;/sup&gt;. Compounds &lt;b&gt;1&#8201;c&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;1&#8201;d&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;2&#8201;c&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;2&#8201;d&lt;/b&gt; show protonation&#8208;induced intramolecular electron transfer that leads to absorption at &lt;i&gt;&#955;&lt;/i&gt;=700&#8211;1300&#8197;nm. Owing to the existence of an electron&#8208;rich C=C bond on the D&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; moiety and in situ generation of &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by the pyrazine&#8208;fused D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; moiety, compounds &lt;b&gt;1&#8201;c&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;1&#8201;d&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;2&#8201;c&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;2&#8201;d&lt;/b&gt; display self&#8208;sensitized photooxidation in 50&#8197;s.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Diphenylberyllium Reinvestigated: Structure, Properties, and Reactivity of BePh2, [(12&#8208;crown&#8208;4)BePh]+, and [BePh3]&#8722;</title>
      <dc:description>
Finally, the structure of diphenylberyllium has been determined and its reactivity explored. BePh2 acts as a Lewis acid but with unexpectedly low ether&#8208;affinity. Several triphenylberyllates were characterized, of which one originates from the selfionization of BePh2. The generated phenylberyllium cation exhibits an unusual 4+1 coordination and all compounds are stable in chlorinated solvents (see scheme). These findings enabled a classification of organoberyllium compounds in comparison to the other (pseudo)main group organyles.







Abstract
The first synthesis of BePh2 was accomplished almost a century ago. However, its structure has remained unknown so far, while the corresponding aryls of the elements adjacent to beryllium in the periodic table are well investigated. Herein, we present an improved synthesis for diphenylberyllium and show by X&#8208;ray diffraction that it forms a trinuclear complex in the solid state. NMR spectroscopy revealed that this structure is also retained in solution but exhibits dynamic behavior. Its stability against heat and coordinating solvents is discussed and the possible obstacles to the synthesis of BePh2 from BeCl2 are examined. In the process of this study two ether adducts, BePh2&#8901;Et2O and Be2Ph4&#8901;Et2O, have been characterized as well as the previously unknown triphenylberyllate anion. From the latter several single&#8208;crystal structures were obtained under various conditions, in which [BePh3]&#8722; is either isolated or acts as a ligand for Li+. Furthermore, the crown ether induced selfionization of BePh2 is described and the resulting [(12&#8208;crown&#8208;4)BePh]+ cation was isolated, which shows an unusual 4+1 coordination around the Be atom.

      <title>Recent Advances in One&#8208;Electron&#8208;Oxidized CuII&#8211;Diphenoxide Complexes as Models of Galactose Oxidase: Importance of the Structural Flexibility in the Active Site</title>
      <dc:description>
Galactose oxidase (GO) has been widely investigated in terms of biological and model complex studies, due to the unique oxidation state of the CuII&#8211;phenoxyl radical. Although properties and reactivities of the CuII&#8211;phenoxyl radical have been clarified, details of the roles of the other structural factors in the active site of GO are still unclear. Recent progress of model studies on GO is reviewed, focusing on some new aspects of structural factors.







Abstract
The phenoxyl radical plays important roles in biological systems as cofactors in some metalloenzymes, such as galactose oxidase (GO) catalyzing oxidation of primary alcohols to give the corresponding aldehydes. Many metal(II)&#8211;phenoxyl radical complexes have hitherto been studied for understanding the detailed properties and reactivities of GO, and thus the nature of GO has gradually become clearer. However, the effects of the subtle geometric and electronic structural changes at the active site of GO, especially the structural change in the catalytic cycle and the effect of the second coordination sphere, have not been fully discussed yet. In this Review, we focus on further details of the model studies of GO and discuss the importance of the structural change at the active site of GO.

      <dc:description>
Ir&#8208;catalyzed selective alkenylation of cage B(3,6)&#8722;H bonds in o&#8208;carboranes has been achieved for the controlled synthesis of 3,6&#8208;trans&#8208;, 3&#8208;cis&#8208;, and 3&#8208;cis&#8208;6&#8208;trans&#8208;alkenylated o&#8208;carboranes in high yields with excellent regio and very good cis&#8208;trans selectivity. Regioselectivity results from the differences in vertex electron density in o&#8208;carborane, while the configuration of the resultant olefinic units is dominated by the nature of alkyne substituents. Alkyl groups lead to trans&#8208;configuration, whereas bulky aryl substitutions result in cis&#8208;configuration. More information can be found in the Full Paper by R. Cheng, Z. Qiu, and Z. Xie.

      <title>Aqueous Chemical Solution Deposition of Functional Double Perovskite Epitaxial Thin Films</title>
      <dc:description>
Slow films: The use of polymers to control the growth of ceramic thin films can make it easier to produce materials for spintronic applications, which use electron spin instead of charge to carry information. Water&#8208;soluble polymers bind to metal cations and slow down crystallization rates so that the most thermodynamically favored double perovskite structure films, with an optimal orientation and high magnetism for device applications, are formed.







Abstract
Double perovskite structure (A2BB&#8242;O6) oxides exhibit a breadth of multifunctional properties with a huge potential range of applications in fields as diverse as spintronics, magneto&#8208;optic devices, or catalysis, and most of these applications require the use of thin films and heterostructures. Chemical solution deposition techniques are appearing as a very promising methodology to achieve epitaxial oxide thin films combining high performance with high throughput and low cost. In addition, the physical properties of these materials are strongly dependent on the ordered arrangement of cations in the double perovskite structure. Thus, promoting spontaneous cationic ordering has become a relevant issue. In this work, our recent achievements by using polymer&#8208;assisted deposition (PAD) of environmentally friendly, water&#8208;based solutions for the growth of epitaxial ferromagnetic insulating double perovskite La2CoMnO6 and La2NiMnO6 thin films on SrTiO3 and LaAlO3 single&#8208;crystal substrates are presented. It is shown that the particular crystallization and growth process conditions of PAD (very slow rate, close to thermodynamic equilibrium conditions) promote high crystallinity and quality of the films, as well as favors spontaneous B&#8208;site cationic ordering.

      <title>Structure&#8208;Guided Design of a Group&#8197;B Streptococcus Type&#8197;III Synthetic Glycan&#8211;Conjugate Vaccine</title>
      <dc:description>
Group B Streptococcus III has been considered a model of highly complex glycan epitope. Based on the X&#8208;ray crystallographic structure of a polysaccharide fragment&#8208;mAb complex, a hexasaccharide was synthesized comprising the positions involved in binding. After conjugation to a carrier protein and in vivo testing, the oligosaccharide was as efficacious as the natural polysaccharide in inducing protective antibodies. This study underlines the role of structural glycobiology in simplifying the design of vaccines based on complex bacterial polysaccharides. More information can be found in the Full Paper by R. Adamo et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202000284).

      <title>Alkynes and Nitrogen Compounds: Useful Substrates for the Synthesis of Pyrazoles</title>
      <dc:description>
One goal: Cyclization reactions of alkynes and nitrogen compounds represent a powerful tool for the preparation of pyrazoles. This Review covers the recent advances in the preparation of pyrazoles starting from alkynes and nitrogen compounds by using transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed or metal&#8208;free conditions to promote the cyclization.







Abstract
The easy preparation and functionalization of pyrazoles associated with their innumerable biological properties have made this class of N&#8208;heterocycles very attractive for the development of new synthetic routes and applications. The cyclization reactions of alkynes and nitrogen compounds represent a powerful tool for the preparation of pyrazoles. This Review covers the recent advances in the preparation of pyrazoles by reacting alkynes and nitrogen compounds under transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed or metal&#8208;free conditions.

      <title>Scope and Limitations of the s&#8208;Block Metal&#8208;Mediated Pudovik Reaction</title>
      <dc:description>
The Pudovik reaction is an atom&#8208;economic addition of phosphane oxides across alkynes, strongly depending on the nature of the s&#8208;block metal, the solvent, the bulkiness of P&#8208;bound groups, and the concentration. Bulky mesityl groups can interact with the newly formed C=C bond of the alkenylphosphane oxides.







Abstract
The hydrophosphorylation of phenylacetylene with di(aryl)phosphane oxides Ar2P(O)H (Pudovik reaction) yields E/Z&#8208;isomer mixtures of phenylethenyl&#8208;di(aryl)phosphane oxides (1). Alkali and alkaline&#8208;earth metal di(aryl)phosphinites have been studied as catalysts for this reaction with increasing activity for the heavier s&#8208;block metals. The Pudovik reaction can only be mediated for di(aryl)phosphane oxides whereas P&#8208;bound alkyl and alcoholate substituents impede the P&#8722;H addition across alkynes. The demanding mesityl group favors the single&#8208;hydrophosphorylated products 1&#8208;Ar whereas smaller aryl substituents lead to the double&#8208;hydrophosphorylated products 2&#8208;Ar. Polar solvents are beneficial for an effective addition. Increasing concentration of the reactants and the catalyst accelerates the Pudovik reaction. Whereas Mes2P(O)H does not form the bis&#8208;phosphorylated product 2&#8208;Mes, activation of an ortho&#8208;methyl group and cyclization occurs yielding 2&#8208;benzyl&#8208;1&#8208;mesityl&#8208;5,7&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydrophosphindole 1&#8208;oxide (3).
