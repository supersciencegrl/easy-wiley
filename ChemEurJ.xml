         <title>Revealing the crystal phase&#8208;activity relationship on NiRu alloy nanoparticles encapsulated in N&#8208;doped carbon towards efficient hydrogen evolution reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Adjusting the crystal phase&#160;of metal alloy is an important method to optimize catalytic performance. However, its detailed understanding about the relationship for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is still limited. In this work, the crystal phase&#8208;activity relationship of NiRu nanoparticles is studied employing the N&#8208;doped carbon shell coated NiRu nanoparticles with different phase contents. It is found that the NiRu@NC (mix)&#160;with both face&#8208;centered cubic (fcc) and thermodynamically unstable hexagonal close&#8208;packed (hcp) phase NiRu give the best HER performance. Further activity studies demonstrate that hcp NiRu has better HER performance, and NiRu@NC (mix) with rich (~70%) hcp phase presented outstanding performance with an overpotential of only 27 mV @ 10 mA&#183;cm&#8208;2. The high HER activity of NiRu@NC (mix) is attributed&#160;to the formation of hcp phase. This finding indicates that the regulation of crystal structure can provide a new strategy for optimizing HER activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural Engineering of Red Luminogens to Realize High Emission Efficiency Through ACQ&#8208;to&#8208;AIE Transformation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Deep red/near&#8208;infrared (NIR, &gt; 650 nm) emissive organic luminophores with aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) behaviours have emerged as promising candidates for the applications in optoelectronic devices and biological fields. However, the molecular design philosophy for AIE luminogens (AIEgens) with narrow band gaps are rarely explored. Herein, we rationally designed two red organic luminophores, FITPA and FIMPA, by considering the enlargement of transition dipole moment in the charge&#8208;transfer state and the transformation from aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) to AIE. The transition dipole moments were effectively enhanced with a &#8220;V&#8208;shaped&#8221; molecular configuration. Meanwhile, the ACQ&#8208;to&#8208;AIE transformation from FITPA to FIMPA was induced by a methoxy&#8208;substitution strategy. The experimental and theoretical results demonstrated that the ACQ&#8208;to&#8208;AIE transformation originated from a crystallization&#8208;induced emission (CIE) effect because of additional weak interactions in the aggregate state introduced by methoxy groups. Owing to the enhanced transition dipole moment and AIE behaviour, FIMPA presented intense luminescence covering the red&#8208;to&#8208;NIR region, with a photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of up to 38% in solid state. The promising cell&#8208;imaging performance further verified the great potential of FIMPA in biological applications. These results provide a guideline for the development of red and NIR AIEgens through comprehensive consideration of both the effect of molecular structure and molecular interactions in aggregate states.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly E&#8208;Selective Olefin Synthesis Catalysed by Novel Quinoxalinone Photocatalyst under Visible Light Conditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In photo&#8208;induced olefin synthesis, the photocatalysts with high triplet energy could cause the isomerization of olefins. This study demonstrates a new quinoxalinone photocatalytic system for highly stereoselective alkenes preparation from alkenyl sulfones and alkyl boronic acids. Our photocatalyst could not convert the thermodynamically favored E&#8208;olefin to Z&#8208;olefin, guaranteeing the high E&#8208;configuration selectivity of the reaction. There is weak interaction between boronic acids and quinoxalinone according to NMR experiments, probably decreasing the oxidation potential of boronic acids. This system can be further extended to the allyl and alkynyl sulfones to give corresponding alkenes and alkynes.</dc:description>

         <title>Mitochondria&#8208;Targeted Gene Silencing Facilitated by Mito&#8208;CPDs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) plays an essential role in maintaining normal cellular activities. Its heteroplasmic mutations are known to cause various genetic diseases. Current genetic engineering strategies, such as those based on RNA interference (RNAi) and antisense technology, are difficult to genetically alter mtDNA, however, due to the inability of highly negatively charged oligonucleotides to translocate across the double&#8208;membrane mitochondria. We report herein a universal mitochondria&#8208;targeted gene&#8208;delivery approach by using cell&#8208;penetrating poly(disulfide)s (CPDs). Novel CPD&#8208;based mitochondrial transporters, named Mito&#8208;CPDs, were synthesized by using triphenylphosphonium (TPP)&#8208;fused propagating monomers containing either disulfide or diselenide backbones. Upon spontaneous complex formation with an oligonucleotide (single&#8208; or double&#8208;stranded), the resulting nanoscale Mito&#8208;CPD@Oligo exhibited excellent properties in common biological media. While the intracellular gene&#8208;delivery efficiency of these Mito&#8208;CPDs was comparable to that of commercial transfection agents, their unique mitochondria&#8208;localized properties enabled effective release of the loaded cargo inside these organelles. Subsequent mitochondrial delivery of siRNA and antisense oligonucleotides against suitable mtDNA&#8208;encoded proteins showed successful down&#8208;regulation of target protein expression, leading to profound effects on mitochondrial functions. Mito&#8208;CPDs thus provide a useful tool for future investigations of mitochondrial biology and treatment of mitochondria&#8208;related diseases.</dc:description>

         <title>A new Type of Valence Tautomerism in Cobalt Dioxolene Complexes &#8211; Temperature&#8208;Induced Transition from a Cobalt(III) Catecholate to a Low&#8208;Spin Cobalt(II) Semiquinonate State</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis and characterization of the monocationic cobalt(III) catecholate complex [Co(L&#8208;N4 t Bu2)(Cl2cat)]+ (L&#8208;N4 t Bu2 = N,N&#8217;&#8208;Di&#8208;tert.&#8208;butyl&#8208;2,11&#8208;diaza[3.3](2,6)pyridinophane, Cl2cat2&#8208; = 4,5&#8208;dichlorocatecholate) are presented. The complex exhibits valence tautomeric properties in solution; but, in contrast to the usually observed conversion from a cobalt(III) catecholate to a high&#8208;spin cobalt(II) semiquinonate state, valence tautomerism of [Co(L&#8208;N4 t Bu2)(Cl2cat)]+ leads to the formation of a low&#8208;spin cobalt(II) semiquinonate complex upon raising the temperature. This new type of valence tautomerism for a cobalt dioxolene complex has been unambiguously established by a detailed spectroscopic investigation using variable&#8208;temperature NMR, IR and UV&#8208;Vis&#8208;NIR spectroscopy. Determination of the enthalpies and entropies characterizing the valence tautomeric equilibria in various solutions shows that the influence of the solvent is almost exclusively entropic.</dc:description>

         <title>Water&#8208;Induced Single&#8208;Crystal to Single&#8208;Crystal Transformation of Ionic Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks with Enhanced Proton Conductivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two ionic hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (iHOF&#8208;10, iHOF&#8208;11) by using 1,1&#697;&#8208;diamino&#8208;4,4&#697;&#8208;bipyridine diiodide (DBpy&#8729;2I) and tetrakis(4&#8208;sulfophenyl)ethylene (H4TPE). With increasing RH and temperature, water molecules induce single crystal to single crystal (SCSC) transformation of iHOF&#8208;10, resulting in the formation of iHOF&#8208;11. At 98% RH, the proton conductivity of iHOF&#8208;11 (7.03 &#215; 10&#8211;3 S cm&#8211;1) is 2.09 times higher than iHOF&#8208;10 (3.37 &#215; 10&#8211;3 S cm&#8211;1) at 90 &#176;C.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Two ionic hydrogen-bonded organic frameworks (iHOF-10, iHOF-11) by using 1,1&#697;-diamino-4,4&#697;-bipyridine diiodide (DBpy&#8729;2I) and tetrakis(4-sulfophenyl)ethylene (H4TPE). With increasing RH and temperature, water molecules induce single crystal to single crystal (SCSC) transformation of iHOF-10, resulting in the formation of iHOF-11. At 98% RH, the proton conductivity of iHOF-11 (7.03 &#215; 10&#8211;3 S cm&#8211;1) is 2.09 times higher than iHOF-10 (3.37 &#215; 10&#8211;3 S cm&#8211;1) at 90 &#176;C. At 50 &#176;C, iHOF-11 (9.49 &#215; 10&#8211;4 S cm&#8211;1) is 19.06 times higher than iHOF-10 (4.98 &#215; 10&#8211;5 S cm&#8211;1).

         <title>Cooperativity&#8208;driven reactivity of a dinuclear copper dimethylglyoxime complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this report, we present the dinuclear copper(II) dimethylglyoxime (H2dmg) complex [Cu2(H2dmg)(Hdmg)(dmg)]+ (1) that, in contrast to its mononuclear analogue [Cu(Hdmg)2] (2), is subject to a cooperativity&#8208;driven hydrolysis. The combined Lewis acidity of both copper centers increase the electrophilicity of the carbon atom in the bridging &#181;2&#8208;O&#8208;N=C&#8208;group of H2dmg and thus, facilitates the nucleophilic attack of H2O. This hydrolysis yields 2,3&#8208;butanedione monoxime (3) and NH2OH that depending on the solvent is then either oxidized or reduced. In ethanol, NH2OH is reduced to NH4+, yielding acetaldehyde as oxidation product. In contrast, in CH3CN, NH2OH is oxidized by CuII to form N2O and [Cu(CH3CN)4]+. Herein are presented the combined synthetic, theoretical, spectroscopic and spectrometric methods that indicate and establish the reaction pathway of this solvent&#8208;dependent reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Plasmonic Photocatalysis for CO2 Reduction: Advances, Understanding and Possibilities</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Plasmonic photocatalysis for CO  2  &#160; reduction is attracting increasing attention due to their appealing properties and great potential for real applications. In this review, the fundamentals of plasmonic photocatalysis and the most recent developments regarding its application in driving CO  2  reduction are reported. Firstly, we present the review on the mechanism of plasmonic photocatalytic CO  2  reduction, the energy transfer of plasmon, and the CO  2  reduction process on the catalyst surface. Then, the modulation on the plasmonic nanostructures and also the semiconductor counterpart to regulate CO  2  photoreduction is discussed. Next, the influence of the core&#8208;shell structure and the interface between the plasmonic metal and semiconductor on the CO  2  photoreduction performance is also outlined. In addition, the latest progress on the emerging direction regarding the plasmonic photocatalysis for methane dry reforming with CO  2  is especially emphasized. Finally, a summary on the challenges and prospects of this promising field are provided.</dc:description>

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Piezochromism from an o&#8208;Carborane Dyad: Boron Clusters Facilitating a Wide&#8208;Range Redshift and High Sensitivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spherical boron cluster. An o&#8208;carborane dyad (MTCb) with a D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A architecture was developed as a high&#8208;sensitivity piezochromic material. Compared to the carborane&#8208;free MTY, the o&#8208;carborane dyad MTCb showed a larger emission wavelength difference of 131&#8197;nm and a higher sensitivity of 32.8&#8197;nm&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;GPa&#8722;1, resulting from the presence of icosahedral boron clusters.







Abstract
Piezochromic materials, which exhibit a fluorescence response with large emission spectral shifts and high sensitivity, may be useful in important applications, but there have been few reports of such organic luminophores. Herein, we report a new high&#8208;sensitivity piezochromic material based on the incorporation of an o&#8208;carborane unit, which exhibits aggregation&#8208;induced emission properties. In a high&#8208;pressure experiment, compared to carborane&#8208;free MTY, which exhibits an emission spectral shift of 75&#8197;nm and a sensitivity of 19.1&#8197;nm&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;GPa&#8722;1, the o&#8208;carborane dyad MTCb shows a larger emission wavelength difference of 131&#8197;nm and a higher sensitivity of 32.8&#8197;nm&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;GPa&#8722;1, demonstrating a performance that ranks among the best of organic piezochromic materials reported thus far. MTCb molecules adopt a J&#8208;aggregated pattern and have relatively loose molecular packing in the crystalline state. Interestingly, nonconjugated spherical carborane can disrupt the &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions between adjacent molecules during compression, which results in excellent piezochromic performance.

         <title>Fe&#8208;Catalyzed Aliphatic C&#8722;H Methylation of Glycine Derivatives and Peptides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A concise strategy relying on multifunctional iron catalysis in the presence of di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl peroxide has been reported, allowing rapid and highly selective C(sp3)&#8722;H methylation of various glycine derivatives and peptides.







Abstract
Direct and selective C&#8722;H methylation is a powerful tool with which to install methyl groups into organic molecules, and is particularly useful in pharmaceutical chemistry. However, practical methods for such modification of biologically interesting targets have been rarely developed. We here report an iron&#8208;catalyzed C(sp3)&#8722;H methylation reaction of glycine derivatives, peptides and drug&#8208;like molecules in an alcohol in the presence of di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl peroxide. A readily available iron catalyst plays multiple roles in the transformation, which accelerates oxidation of C&#8722;N bonds to C=N double bonds, activates imine intermediates as Lewis acids by bidentate chelation, and at the same time facilitates cleavage of the peroxide to generate methyl radicals. A variety of methylated N&#8208;aryl glycine derivatives and peptides were obtained in good yield and with excellent chemo&#8208; and site&#8208;selectivity. This reaction is scalable, easily managed, and can be completed within 1&#8211;2&#8197;h. It features an economic, bio&#8208;friendly catalyst, a green solvent and low toxic reagents, and will provide effective access to precise C&#8722;H modification of biomolecules and natural products.

         <title>Transition Metal Vacancy in Layered Cathode Materials for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This concept focuses on the formation of transition metal (TM) vacancy, vacancy contained configurations for triggering oxygen redox, advanced characterization techniques for detecting TM vacancy and viable strategies to improve the reversibility of vacancy&#8208;induced oxygen redox for layered cathode materials of sodium&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
Anionic redox has been considered as a promising strategy to break the capacity limitation of cathode materials that solely relies on the intrinsic cationic redox in secondary batteries. Vacancy, as a kind of defect, can be introduced into transition metal layer to trigger oxygen redox, thus enhancing the energy density of layer&#8208;structured cathode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries. Herein, the formation process, recent progress in working mechanisms of triggering oxygen redox, as well as advanced characterization techniques for transition metal (TM) vacancy were overviewed and discussed. Strategies applied to stabilize the vacancy contained structures and harness the reversible oxygen redox were summarized. Furthermore, the challenges and prospects for further understanding TM vacancy were particularly emphasized.

         <title>On&#8208;Demand Release of Secondary Amine Bases for the Activation of Catalysts and Crosslinkers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Apart from their properties as self&#8208;healing materials, DCv ureas can be applied as starting points for triggered reaction cascades. Input such as heat and water can release free base on demand. We apply this release system for the deprotection of a latent organocatalyst to catalyse acylhydrazone formation as well as for on&#8208;demand gelation.







Abstract
Dynamic covalent (DCv) ureas have been used abundantly to design self&#8208;healing materials. We demonstrate that apart from self&#8208;healing materials, the species present in the equilibrium of DCv ureas can be employed as responsive organocatalysts. Easily controllable stimuli like heat or addition of water shift the equilibrium towards isocyanate and free base which can function as an in situ released reagent. We demonstrate this application of DCv ureas with two examples. Firstly, we use the liberated base to catalytically activate a latent organocatalyst for acylhydrazone formation. Secondly, this base can be employed in an equimolar manner to trigger the release of nitrile&#8208;N&#8208;oxides from chlorooximes, which react with acrylate&#8208;terminated polymers to form an isoxazoline polymer gel.

         <title>Investigations into Simplified Analogues of the Herbicidal Natural Product (+)&#8208;Cornexistin</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the design, synthesis and biological evaluation of simplified analogues of the herbicidal natural product (+)&#8208;cornexistin. Guided by an X&#8208;Ray co&#8208;crystal structure of cornexistin bound to the transketolase enzyme from Zea mays, we attempted to identify the key interactions that are necessary for cornexistin to maintain its herbicidal profile. This resulted in the preparation of three novel analogues investigating the importance of substituents that are located on the nine&#8208;membered ring of cornexistin. One analogue maintained a good level of biological activity and could provide researchers insights in how to further optimize the structure of cornexistin for commercialization in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>Three&#8208; and Five&#8208;Membered Anionic Chains of Pnictogenylboranes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three&#8208;membered chains of substituted anionic compounds composed of both boron and pnictogen (phosphorus and/or arsenic) atoms are synthesized from the reaction of pnictogenide salts with H2E&#8722;BH2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;NMe3 (E=P, As). Such compounds can be further reacted with H2E&#8722;BH2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;NMe3 to form unprecedented five&#8208;membered anionic group 13/15 oligomers.







Abstract
An unprecedented family of three&#8208; and five&#8208;membered substituted anionic derivatives of parent pnictogenylboranes is herein reported. Reacting various combinations of the pnictogenylboranes H2E&#8242;&#8722;BH2&#8722;NMe3 (E&#8242;=P, As) with pnictogen&#8208;based nucleophiles MER1R2 (E=P, As; R1=H, R2=tBu; R1=R2=Ph; M=Na, K) allows for the isolation of the unsymmetrical products [Na(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)][H2E&#8242;&#8722;BH2&#8722;EHtBu] (3: E=E&#8242;=P; 4: E=E&#8242;=As; 5: E=As, E&#8242;=P) and [M(C)][H2E&#8242;&#8722;BH2&#8722;EPh2] (7: E=E&#8242;=P, M=Na, C=18&#8208;crown&#8208;6; 8: E=E&#8242;=As; M=K, C=[2.2.2]cryptand; 9: E=P, E&#8242;=As, M=Na, C=[2.2.2]cryptand; 10: E=As, E&#8242;=P, M=K, C=[2.2.2]cryptand). [Na(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)][H2As&#8722;BH2&#8208;tBuPH&#8722;BH3] (6) is only accessible by a different pathway, using tBuPH2, BH3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;SMe2 and NaNH2 as starting materials. Additionally, the synthesis of symmetrical diphenyl&#8208;substituted compounds [M(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)][Ph2E&#8722;BH2&#8722;EPh2] (11: E=P, M=Na; 12: E=As, M=K) is reported which can be regarded as isostructural inorganic, negatively charged analogs of dppm (1,1&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)methane) and dpam (1,1&#8208;bis(diphenylarsino)methane). Furthermore, an elongation of the pnictogen boron backbone in compounds 3, 7 and 9&#8242; (similar compound to 9, stabilized however by 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6), is attainable by reacting them with the pnictogenylboranes H2E&#8242;&#8722;BH2&#8722;NMe3 leading to corresponding five&#8208;membered chain&#8208;like compounds [Na(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)][H2E&#8722;BH2&#8722;R1R2P&#8722;BH2&#8722;E&#8242;H2] (E=E&#8242;=P, R1=H, R2=tBu (13); E=E&#8242;=P, R1=R2=Ph (14); E=E&#8242;=As, R1=R2=Ph (15); E=P, E&#8242;=As, R1=R2=Ph (16)). Finally, the thermodynamics of the reaction pathways were evaluated by quantum chemical computations.

         <title>Reagent&#8208;Controlled Regioselective Intramolecular [2+2] Cycloaddition between Vinylsilanes and Allenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unprecedented intramolecular [2+2] cycloaddition reaction between allenes and silicon&#8208;bearing olefins is presented. This is also the first example of the reagent&#8208;controlled regioselective [2+2] cycloaddition of allenes. The products in this work were oil compounds. The crystal sponge method was successfully used to determine their structures.







Abstract
This paper provides the first report of the intramolecular [2+2] cycloaddition of vinylsilane. The [2+2] cycloaddition of allenes is a useful reaction that can synthesize cyclobutanes. However, no previous works have attempted to control the regioselectivity between the two double bonds of allenes only by changing the reaction conditions, although there have been some reports of the regioselective [2+2] cycloaddition of allenes by changing the substrate. In this study, we have succeeded in controlling intramolecular [2+2] cycloaddition reactions at the proximal and distal positions of allenes simply by changing the reaction conditions. We found that the atomic radius of silicon is very important for perfect control of the reaction's sites. The structures of all key compounds were determined by the crystal sponge method which could identify the structures of liquid compounds.

     alt="Reagent-Controlled Regioselective Intramolecular [2+2] Cycloaddition between Vinylsilanes and Allenes"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A unprecedented&lt;/b&gt; intramolecular [2+2] cycloaddition reaction between allenes and silicon-bearing olefins is presented. This is also the first example of the reagent-controlled regioselective [2+2] cycloaddition of allenes. The products in this work were oil compounds. The crystal sponge method was successfully used to determine their structures.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This paper provides the first report of the intramolecular [2+2] cycloaddition of vinylsilane. The [2+2] cycloaddition of allenes is a useful reaction that can synthesize cyclobutanes. However, no previous works have attempted to control the regioselectivity between the two double bonds of allenes only by changing the reaction conditions, although there have been some reports of the regioselective [2+2] cycloaddition of allenes by changing the substrate. In this study, we have succeeded in controlling intramolecular [2+2] cycloaddition reactions at the proximal and distal positions of allenes simply by changing the reaction conditions. We found that the atomic radius of silicon is very important for perfect control of the reaction's sites. The structures of all key compounds were determined by the crystal sponge method which could identify the structures of liquid compounds.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mechanoresponsive Metal&#8208;Organic Cage&#8208;Crosslinked Polymer Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The utilization of homobifunctional poly(ethylene glycol) chains terminally substituted with bipyridines as ligands for Pd6L4 cages enabled crosslinking of the metal&#8208;organic cages and subsequent network formation, leading to supramolecular polymer hydrogels. The hydrogels allow for non&#8208;covalent guest uptake and release using ultrasound from aqueous solution.







Abstract
We report the formation of metal&#8208;organic cage&#8208;crosslinked polymer hydrogels. To enable crosslinking of the cages and subsequent network formation, we used homodifunctionalized poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) chains terminally substituted with bipyridines as ligands for the Pd6L4 corners. The encapsulation of guest molecules into supramolecular self&#8208;assembled metal&#8208;organic cage&#8208;crosslinked hydrogels, as well as ultrasound&#8208;induced disassembly of the cages with release of their cargo, is presented in addition to their characterization by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques, rheology, and comprehensive small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS) experiments. The constrained geometries simulating external force (CoGEF) method and barriers using a force&#8208;modified potential energy surface (FMPES) suggest that the cage&#8208;opening mechanism starts with the dissociation of one pyridine ligand at around 0.5&#8197;nN. We show the efficient sonochemical activation of the hydrogels HG3&#8211;6, increasing the non&#8208;covalent guest&#8208;loading of completely unmodified drugs available for release by a factor of ten in comparison to non&#8208;crosslinked, star&#8208;shaped assemblies in solution.

         <title>PtSnBi Nanoplates Enable Photoacoustic Imaging&#8208;Guided Highly Efficient Photothermal Tumor Ablation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two&#8208;dimensional intermetallic PtSnBi nanoplates were constructed as a novel photothermal agent with a high photothermal conversion efficiency of 61&#8201;% upon 808&#8208;nm laser irradiation. The application of PtSnBi nanoplates for photothermal cancer therapy both in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo was successfully carried out, suggesting that PtSnBi nanoplates have great promise in cancer theranostics.







Abstract
The development of photothermal agents (PTAs) with robust photostability and high photothermal conversion efficiency is of great importance for cancer photothermal therapy. Herein, a novel PTA was created using two&#8208;dimensional intermetallic PtSnBi nanoplates (NPs), which demonstrated excellent photostability and biocompatibility with a high photothermal conversion efficiency of &#8764;61&#8201;% after PEGylation. More importantly, PtSnBi NPs could be employed as photoacoustic imaging contrast agents for tumor visualization due to their strong absorbance in the NIR range. In addition, both in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo experiments confirmed that PtSnBi NPs had a good photothermal efficacy under NIR laser irradiation. Therefore, the remarkable therapeutic characteristics of PtSnBi NPs make them a most promising candidate for cancer theranostics.

         <title>Stereoselective Synthesis of Tetraarylethylenes Enabled by Reductive anti&#8208;1,2&#8208;Dimetallation of Alkynes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tetraarylethylenes (TAEs) have been gaining attentions from various scientific disciplines for their characteristic chemical and physical properties. From the synthetic perspective, however, efficient methods for the selective synthesis of different isomers of TAEs are still underdeveloped. Here, we report the regio&#8208; and stereoselective synthesis of TAEs by means of sodium&#8208;promoted reductive anti&#8208;1,2&#8208;dimagnesiation of alkynes. Subsequent transmetallation to zinc generates trans&#8208;1,2&#8208;dizincioalkenes, which underwent the stereoselective arylation under a palladium catalysis to afford a variety of TAEs that had been difficult to prepare according to the conventional procedures. In addition, the present method accommodates not only diarylacetylenes but also alkyl aryl acetylenes and thus enables to synthesize a wide range of all&#8208;carbon tetrasubstituted alkenes.</dc:description>

         <title>Stability of Catalytic Centres in Light&#8208;driven Hydrogen Evolution by Oligonuclear Photocatalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A review. In the past decades, mimicking natural photosynthesis by artificial photocatalysis represented a major research direction towards the final goal of reducing the consumption of fossil fuels by efficiently harvesting solar energy. To transfer molecular photocatalysis from the lab scale to an industrially relevant process, it is important to overcome instability problems of the catalysts during light&#8208;driven operation. As it is well&#8208;known that many of the typically utilized noble metal&#8208;based catalytic centres (e.g.&#160;Pt and Pd) undergo particle formation during (photo)catalysis and thus switch the whole process from a homogeneous into a heterogeneous one, an understanding of the factors governing particle formation is crucially needed. The review therefore focuses on di&#8208; and oligonuclear photocatalysts bearing a range of different bridging ligand architectures for drawing structure&#8208;catalyst&#8208;stability relationships in light&#8208;driven intramolecular reductive catalysis. In addition, ligand effects at the catalytic centre and its consequences on the catalytic activity in intermolecular systems will be addressed, as well as yielding important insights into the future design of operationally stable catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Can Copper(I) and Silver(I) be Hydrogen Bond Acceptors?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Gold(I) centers can form moderately strong (Au&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;H) hydrogen bonds with tertiary ammonium groups, as has been demonstrated on 3AuCl+ (3+ = 1&#8208;(tert&#8208;butyl)&#8208;3&#8208;phenyl&#8208;4&#8208;(2&#8208;((dimethylammonio)methyl)phenyl)&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazol&#8208;5&#8208;ylidene) complex. However, similar hydrogen bonding interactions with isoelectronic silver(I) or copper(I) centers are unknown. Herein, we first explored whether the Au&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;H bond originally observed in 3AuCl+ can be strengthened by replacing Cl with Br or I. Experimental gas&#8208;phase IR spectra in the ~3000 cm&#8208;1 region showed only a small effect of the halogen on the Au&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;H bond. Next, we measured the spectra of 3AgCl+, which exhibited significant differences compared to its 3AuX+ counterparts. The difference has been explained by DFT calculations which indicated that the Ag&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;H interaction is only marginal in this complex, and a Cl&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;H hydrogen bond is formed instead. Calculations predicted the same for the 3CuCl+ complex. However, we noticed that for Ag and Cu complexes with less flexible ligands, such as dimethyl(2&#8208;(dimethylammonio)phenyl)phosphine (L&#8311;H + ), the computations predict the presence of the respective Ag&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;H and Cu&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;H hydrogen bonds, with a strength similar to the Au&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;H bond in 3AuCl+. We, therefore, propose possible complexes where the presence of (Ag/Cu)&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;H bonds could be experimentally verified to broaden our understanding of these unusual interactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Shape, Electronic Factors and the Ferroelectric Nematic Phase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis and characterisation of two series of low molar mass mesogens, the (4&#8208;nitrophenyl) 2&#8208;alkoxy&#8208;4&#8208;(4&#8208;methoxybenzoyl)oxybenzoates (NT3.m) and the (3&#8208;fluoro&#8208;4&#8208;nitrophenyl) 2&#8208;alkoxy&#8208;4&#8208;(4&#8208;methoxybenzoyl)oxybenzoates (NT3F.m), are reported in order to investigate the effect of changing the position of a lateral alkoxy chain from the methoxy&#8208;substituted terminal ring to central phenyl ring in these two series of materials based on RM734. All members of the NT3.m series exhibited a conventional nematic phase, N, which preceded the ferroelectric nematic phase, NF, whereas all the members of the NT3F.m series exhibited direct NF&#8208;I transitions except for NT3F.1 which also exhibited a N phase. These materials cannot be described as wedge&#8208;shaped, yet their values of TNFN exceed those of the corresponding materials with the lateral alkoxy chain located on the methoxy&#8208;substituted terminal ring. In part, this may be attributed to the effect that changing the position of the lateral alkoxy chain has on the electronic properties of these materials, specifically in the electron density associated with the methoxy&#8208;substituted terminal aromatic ring. The value of TNI decreased with the addition of a fluorine atom ortho to the nitro group in NT3F.1, however, the opposite behaviour is found comparing the transition temperatures of the NF phase which are higher for the NT3F.m series, and this may reflect a change in the polarity and polarizability of those materials. This suggests that, rather than simply promoting a tapered shape, the role of the lateral chain in inhibiting anti&#8208;parallel associations and its effect on the electronic properties of the molecules are the key factors in driving the formation of the NF phase.</dc:description>

         <title>A cyclodextrin polymer as supramolecular matrix for scalable green photooxygenation of hydrophobic substrates in homogeneous phase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the quest for new therapies targeting hypoxia, aromatic endoperoxides have intriguing potential as oxygen releasing agents (ORAs) able to free O2&#160;in tissues upon suitable trigger. Four aromatic substrates were synthesized and the formation of their corresponding endoperoxides was optimized in organic solvent upon selective irradiation of Methylene Blue, a low&#8208;cost photocatalyst, producing the reactive singlet oxygen species. Complexation of the hydrophobic substrates within a hydrophilic cyclodextrin (CyD) polymer allowed their photooxygenation in homogeneous aqueous environment using the same optimized protocol upon dissolution in water of the three readily accessible reagents. Notably, reaction rates were comparable in buffered D2O and organic solvent and, for the first time, the photooxygenation of highly hydrophobic substrates was achieved for millimolar solutions in non&#8208;deuterated water. Quantitative conversion of the substrates, straightforward isolation of the endoperoxides and recovery of the polymeric matrix were achieved. Cycloreversion of one ORA to the original aromatic substrate was observed upon thermolysis. These results hold great potential for the launch of CyD polymers both as reaction vessels for green, homogeneous photocatalysis and as carrier for the delivery of ORAs in tissues.</dc:description>

         <title>ASSESSING COMBINATIONS OF B(C6F5)3 AND N2&#8208;DERIVED MOLYBDENUM NITRIDO COMPLEXES FOR HETEROLYTIC BOND ACTIVATION</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two different dinitrogen&#8208;derived molybdenum nitrido complexes varying by their geometry, ligand spheres and oxidations states were shown to engage their N ligand in dative bonding with the strong Lewis acid B(C6F5)3. The stable adducts were assessed for frustrated Lewis pair&#8208;type heterolytic E&#8211;H bond splitting of hydrosilanes (E = Si) and HB(C6F5)2. Whereas Si&#8211;H bond activation was achieved, HB(C6F5)2 was shown to substitute B(C6F5)3 in a quantitative or equilibrated fashion, depending on the nature of the nitrido complex. No B&#8211;H bond splitting was observed. Thermodynamics of these reactions, computed by DFT, are in agreement with the experimental outcomes.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlling the Flexibility of Carbazole&#8208;based Metal&#8211;organic Frameworks by Substituent Effects</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have developed highly porous Cu&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) using carbazole&#8208;type linkers. The novel topological structure of these MOFs was revealed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. Molecular adsorption/desorption experiments indicated that these MOFs are flexible and change their structure upon adsorption/desorption of organic solvents and gas molecules. These MOFs exhibit unprecedented properties that allow controlling their flexibility by adding a functional group onto the central benzene ring of the organic ligand. For example, the introduction of electron&#8208;donating substituents increases the robustness of the resulting MOFs. These MOFs also exhibit flexibility&#8208;dependent differences in gas&#8208;adsorption and &#8208;separation performance. Thus, this study represents the first example of controlling the flexibility of MOFs with the same topological structure via the substituent effect of functional groups introduced into the organic ligand.</dc:description>

         <title>Marigold Flower&#8208;Shaped Metal Organic Framework Supported Manganese Vanadium Oxide Electrocatalyst for Efficient Oxygen Evolution Reactions in an Alkaline Medium</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a key process in many renewable energy systems. The development of low&#8208;cost, long&#8208;lasting alternatives to precious&#8208;metal catalysts, particularly functional electrocatalysts with high activity for OER processes, is crucial for reducing the operating expense and complexity of renewable energy generating systems. This work describes a concise method for generating marigold flower&#8208;like metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) aided manganese vanadium oxide via a hydrothermal procedure for increased OER activity. As synthesized MOF MnV oxide has a higher surface area due to the 3D flower&#8208;like structure, which is reinvented with enhanced electrocatalytic active sites. These distinctive structural features result in remarkable catalytic activity for MOF MnV oxide microflower towards OER with a low overpotential of 310 mV at 50 mA cm&#8208;2 and a Tafel slope with only 50.1 mV dec&#8208;1 in alkaline conditions. This study provides a concise method for developing an optimized catalytic material with greater morphology and beneficial features for potential energy and environmental applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Construction of Corrole&#8208;peptide Conjugates by Controllable Bilane Formation on Resin</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Corroles have attracted increasing research interests in recent decades owing to their unique properties over porphyrins. However, the relatively inefficient and tedious synthetic procedures of corrole building blocks with functional groups for bioconjugation hindered their bioapplications. Herein, we report a highly efficient protocol to synthesize corrole&#8208;peptide conjugates with good yields (up to 63 %) without using prepared corrole building blocks. By condensing two &#8208;COOH&#8208;bearing&#8208;dipyrromethane molecules onto an aldehyde group on resin&#8208;bound peptide chains in a controllable manner, a series of desired products with long (up to 25 residues) and bioactive peptide chains were obtained with at most one chromatographic purification. The synthesized compounds exhibited potential applications as chelators for metal ions for biomedical applications, as building blocks for supramolecular materials, as well as targeted fluorescent probes.</dc:description>

         <title>Tyrosine&#8208;Conjugation Method for Evaluating BACE1 Activity Based on Silver Nanoparticles/Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Composites as Electrochemical Tags</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Beta&#8208;site secretase (BACE1) catalyzes the cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP), which process ultimately lead to plaque deposition in the brain of Alzheimer&#8217;s disease (AD). Thus, accurate monitor of BACE1 activity is essential to screen inhibitors for AD treatment. This study develops a sensitive electrochemical assay for probing BACE1 activity based on silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) and tyrosine conjugation as tags and a marking method, respectively. An APP segment is&#160;firstly immobilized on aminated microplate reactor. Cytosine (C) rich sequence&#8208;templated AgNPs/Zr&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF)&#160;composite is&#160;modified by phenol groups, and then the prepared tag&#160;(ph&#8208;AgNPs@MOF) is&#160;captured in microplate surface by the&#160;conjugation reaction of phenolic groups between tyrosine and tag. After cleavage by BACE1, the solution containing ph&#8208;AgNPs@MOF tags is&#160;transferred to the screen&#8208;printed graphene electrode&#160;(SPGE) surface for voltammetric detection of AgNP signal. This sensitive detection for BACE1 provided an excellent linear relationship between 1&#160;to 200 pM&#160;with a detection limit of 0.8 pM. Furthermore, this electrochemical assay is&#160;successfully applied for screening of BACE1 inhibitors. This strategy is&#160;also verified to be used for evaluation of BACE1 in serum samples.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Beta-site secretase (BACE1) catalyzes the cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP), which process ultimately lead to plaque deposition in the brain of Alzheimer&#8217;s disease (AD). Thus, accurate monitor of BACE1 activity is essential to screen inhibitors for AD treatment. This study develops a sensitive electrochemical assay for probing BACE1 activity based on silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) and tyrosine conjugation as tags and a marking method, respectively. An APP segment is&#160;firstly immobilized on aminated microplate reactor. Cytosine (C) rich sequence-templated AgNPs/Zr-based metal-organic framework (MOF)&#160;composite is&#160;modified by phenol groups, and then the prepared tag&#160;(ph-AgNPs@MOF) is&#160;captured in microplate surface by the&#160;conjugation reaction of phenolic groups between tyrosine and tag. After cleavage by BACE1, the solution containing ph-AgNPs@MOF tags is&#160;transferred to the screen-printed graphene electrode&#160;(SPGE) surface for voltammetric detection of AgNP signal.

         <title>Unexpectedly Large Structural Variations in Benzyl&#8208;Substituted Sila[1]ferrocenophanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A set of four planar&#8208;chiral sila[1]ferrocenophanes equipped with a benzyl group in the &#945;&#8208;position, either on one or both Cp rings, and substituted on the bridging silicon atom, either by methyl or phenyl groups, were prepared. While NMR, UV/Vis, and DSC measurements did not show anything uncommon, single crystal X&#8208;ray analyses revealed unexpectedly large variations of the dihedral angles between both Cp rings (&#945; tilt angle). While DFT calculations predicted &#945; between 19.6 and 20.8&#176;, measured values were found between 16.6(2) and 21.45(14)&#176;. However, experimentally determined conformers differ significantly from those calculated for the gas phase. For the sila[1]ferrocenophane with the largest mismatch between the experimental and predicted &#945; angle, it was shown that the orientation of benzyl groups have a significant influence on the ring&#8208;tilted structure. Packing of molecules in the crystal lattice forces benzyl groups into unusual orientations, resulting in a significantly reduced &#945; angle through steric repulsions.</dc:description>

         <title>Chalcogen Bonding Catalysis of the Cloke&#9472;Wilson Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Cloke&#8722;Wilson rearrangement is an important method to construct heterocycles which was conventionally facilitated by strong Lewis acids, Br&#248;nsted acids and Lewis bases. A weak interaction catalysis approach to the Cloke&#8722;Wilson rearrangement remains a challenging topic and yet no example is reported. Herein, we describe a chalcogen bonding catalysis method to achieve the Cloke&#8722;Wilson rearrangement that involves activation of carbonyl cyclopropanes by double Se&#183;&#183;&#183;O interactions. This chalcogen bonding catalysis approach afforded a wide range of dihydrofurans with good yields, thus establishing an alternative strategy to catalyze the Cloke&#8722;Wilson rearrangement.</dc:description>

         <title>In Situ X&#8208;ray Diffraction Studies on the Reduction of V2O5 and WO3 by Using Hydrogen</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ X&#8208;ray powder diffraction was used to investigate the reduction of WO3 to WO2 and V2O5 to V2O3 under hydrogen gas with regard to intermediate oxides and bronzes as well as influence of the heating and hydrogen&#8208;flow rates.







Abstract
The reduction of metal oxides with hydrogen is widely used for the production of fine chemicals and metals both on the laboratory and industry scale. In situ methods can help to elucidate reaction pathways and to gain control over such synthesis reactions. In this study, the reduction of WO3 and V2O5 with hydrogen was investigated by in situ X&#8208;ray powder diffraction with regard to intermediates and the influence of heating rates and hydrogen flow rates. Mixtures of V4O9, V6O13 and VO2 in two modifications were identified as intermediates on the way to phase&#8208;pure V2O3. None of the intermediates occurs in a single phase and therefore cannot be prepared this way. In contrast, the intermediates of the WO3 reduction, H0.23WO3 and W10O29, appear consecutively and can be isolated. For both reactions, the heating and flow rates have little influence on the formation of intermediates.

         <title>Trace Explosive Detection Based on Photonic Crystal Amplified Fluorescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Trace TNT detection enabled by the amplification effect of photonic crystal on fluorescence signals is achieved. The photonic crystal&#8208;based sensor chips can sense trace explosive TNT in different environments, including air, environmental wastewater, and contaminated soil.







Abstract
With increasing demand for public security and environmental protection, it is highly desirable to develop strategies to identify trace explosives (e.&#8201;g., 2,4,6&#8208;trinitrotoluene (TNT)). Herein, we report novel photonic crystal (PC)&#8208;based sensor chips for trace TNT detection by using amplification effect of PCs on fluorescence (FL) signals. The sensor chips are constructed by integrating silica nanoparticles (NPs) modified with (3&#8208;aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (APTES) and fluorescein isothiocyanate isomer (FITC) and PC substrates. The amino groups on FITC&#8208;APTES&#8208;silica NPs can specifically bind with TNT molecules to form Meisenheimer complexes and strongly quench the FL signal of neighboring fluorophores FITC through F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer. PCs with matched PBG can amplify the FL signal of FITC&#8208;APTES&#8208;silica NPs about 24.4&#8208;fold and significantly improve sensitivity and resolution of trace TNT detection with the limit of detection of 0.23&#8197;nM. The PC&#8208;based sensor chips are stable, sensitive, and reliable TNT sensing platforms, showing great potential in homeland safety and environmental protection.

         <title>Fast Motions Dominate Dynamics of Intrinsically Disordered Tau Protein at High Temperatures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reorientational dynamics of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) at low temperatures are composed of multiple components such as segmental motions and local conformational fluctuations. Temperature&#8208;dependent spectral density analysis of 15N&#8197;NMR relaxation rates demonstrates that local backbone and relaxation&#8208;active segmental chain dynamics of IDPs might merge into an effectively single dynamic component at sufficiently high temperatures.







Abstract
Reorientational dynamics of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) contain multiple motions often clustered around three motional modes: ultrafast librational motions of amide groups, fast local backbone conformational fluctuations and slow chain segmental motions. This dynamic picture is mainly based on 15N&#8197;NMR relaxation studies of IDPs at relatively low temperatures where the amide&#8208;water proton exchange rates are sufficiently small. Less is known, however, about the dynamics of IDPs at more physiological temperatures. Here, we investigate protein dynamics in a 441&#8208;residue long IDP, tau protein, in the temperature range from 0&#8211;25&#8201;&#176;C, using 15N&#8197;NMR relaxation rates and spectral density analysis. While at these temperatures relaxation rates are still better described in terms of amide group librational motions, local backbone dynamics and chain segmental motions, the temperature&#8208;dependent trend of spectral densities suggests that the timescales of fast backbone conformational fluctuations and slower chain segmental motions might become inseparable at higher temperatures. Our data demonstrate the remarkable dynamic plasticity of this prototypical IDP and highlight the need for dynamic studies of IDPs at multiple temperatures.

         <title>Diastereoselective Synthesis of trans&#8208;anti&#8208;Hydrophenanthrenes via Ti&#8208;mediated Radical Cyclization and Total Synthesis of Kamebanin</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A diastereoselective synthesis of the functionalized trans&#8208;anti&#8208;hydrophenanthrenes via Ti&#8208;mediated reductive radical cyclization has been developed. This method enabled the convergent total synthesis of nebularilactone A and the first total synthesis of kamebanin via a novel formal semi&#8208;pinacol rearrangement reaction and an unprecedented Thorpe&#8208;Ziegler&#8208;type D&#8208;ring formation reaction.







Abstract
Ent&#8208;kaurenes consist of an ABC&#8208;ring based on a trans&#8208;anti&#8208;hydrophenanthrene skeleton and a D ring with an exomethylene. Highly oxygen&#8208;functionalized ent&#8208;kauren&#8208;15&#8208;ones have promising antiinflammatory pharmacological activity. In this study, we developed a novel diastereoselective synthesis of trans&#8208;anti&#8208;hydrophenanthrenes via a Ti&#8208;mediated reductive radical cyclization. We also demonstrated the applicability of this method by developing the first total synthesis of (&#177;)&#8208;kamebanin (longest linear sequence; 17&#8197;steps, overall yield; 6.5&#8201;%). Furthermore, this synthesis provided a formal semi&#8208;pinacol rearrangement for the construction of the quaternary carbon at C8 and a novel Thorpe&#8208;Ziegler&#8208;type reaction for the construction of the D&#8208;ring.

         <title>Synthesis of a Bifunctionalized Glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) Anchor Useful for the Study of GPI Biology</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bifunctional glycosylphosphatidylinositol derivative containing photoactivable and clickable groups was synthesized by a convergent strategy.







Abstract
A new, bifunctional glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) derivative containing the highly conserved core structure of all natural GPI anchors with a photoactivable diazirine in the lipid chain and clickable alkynes in the glycan was synthesized by a convergent [3+2] glycosylation strategy with late stage protecting group manipulation and regioselective phosphorylation. The challenges of this synthesis were due to the presence of several distinctive functional groups in the synthetic target, which complicated the protection tactics, in addition to the inherent difficulties associated with GPI synthesis. This bifunctional GPI derivative can cross&#8208;react with molecules in proximity upon photoactivation and be subsequently labeled with other molecular tags via click reaction. Therefore, it should be a valuable probe for biological studies of GPIs, such as analysis of GPI&#8208;interacting membrane proteins, and gaining insights into their functional mechanisms.

         <title>Ability of Azathiacyclen Ligands To Stop Cu(A&#946;)&#8208;Induced Production of Reactive Oxygen Species: [3N1S] Is the Right Donor Set</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cu bound to A&#946; (heads of the meteorites) produces reactive oxygen species (tails) that attack the brain. In the presence of the azamacrocyclic ligand 3N1S (the green belt), the Cu ions are removed by the ligand (the head of the meteorite is broken) and the ROS production is abolished (the tail disappears). Hence, the brain is safe behind its shield. In absence of 3N1S, the ROS produced by Cu(A&#946;) attack the brain, which is &#8220;destroyed&#8221;. More information can be found in the Research Article by C. Esmieu, C. Hureau, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202203667).

Nontoxic and energy&#8208;efficient COF synthesis: Covalent organic framework TpPa&#8208;1 has been successfully obtained in a microwave&#8208;assisted hydrothermal synthesis, replacing the traditional organic&#8208;based solvent with water and reducing reaction times from several days to 30&#8197;minutes. High&#8208;temperature hydrothermal synthesis resulted in higher BET specific surface areas (compared to traditional solvothermal processes), improved material yields, and excellent textural properties.

         <title>Synthesis, Characterization and Singlet Fission Behaviors of Heteroatom&#8208;Doped Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons with (&#946;, &#946;) Connected Furan/Thiophene Ring</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Singlet fission (SF) has been proven to be an effective strategy to overcome the Shockley&#8722;Queisser limit of photovoltaics. However, the materials suitable for SF are relatively rare due to the strict requirements for the occurrence of this process. In the present study, we report the first preparation of two heteroatoms (O and S)&#8208;doped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) molecules with (&#946;, &#946;) connected furan/thiophene ring. The optical and physiochemical properties of both compounds are investigated by a variety of spectroscopies, including UV&#8208;vis absorption, photoluminescence and cyclic voltammetry. In addition, their ultrafast excited state dynamics are studied by femtosecond transient absorption. Experimental data showed that the singlet fission efficiency was improved by 2 times when replacing oxygen with sulfur atom, which could provide some guidelines in designing singlet fission materials with better efficiency.</dc:description>

         <title>Optimization of the Lead Compound NVP&#8208;BHG712 as Colorectal Cancer Inhibitor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The ephrin type&#8208;A receptor 2 (EPHA2) belongs to the largest family of receptor tyrosine kinases. There are several indications of an involvement of EPHA2 in the development of infectious diseases and cancer. Despite pharmacological potential, EPHA2 is an under&#8208;examined target protein. In this study, we synthesized a series of derivatives of the inhibitor NVP&#8208;BHG712 and triazine&#8208;based compounds. These compounds were evaluated to determine their potential as kinase inhibitors of EPHA2, including elucidation of their binding mode (X&#8208;ray crystallography), affinity (microscale thermophoresis), and selectivity (kinobeads assay). Eight inhibitors showed affinities in the low nanomolar regime (KD &lt; 10 nM). Testing in up to seven colon cancer cell lines that express EPHA2 reveals that several derivatives feature promising effects for control of human colon carcinoma. Thus, we have developed a set of powerful tool compounds for fundamental new research on the interplay of EPH receptors in a cellular context.</dc:description>

         <title>In cellulo light&#8208;induced dynamics in a BODIPY&#8208;perylene dyad</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>BODIPY&#8208;based donor&#8208;acceptor dyads are widely used as sensors and probes in life science. Thus, their biophysical properties are well established in solution, while their photophysical properties in cellulo, i.e., in the environment, in which the dyes are designed to function, are generally understood less. To address this issue, we present a sub&#8208;ns time&#8208;resolved transient absorption study of the excited&#8208;state dynamics of a BODIPY&#8208;perylene dyad designed as a twisted intramolecular charge transfer (TICT) probe of the local viscosity in live cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Fullerene C70 as Photoredox Catalyst for the Synthesis of Pyrrolo[2,1&#8209;a]isoquinolines via 1,3&#8208;Dipolar Cycloaddition&#8208;Aromatization Sequence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we introduce fullerene (C70) as an effective photoredox catalyst for the construction of a highly functionalised pyrrolo[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinoline framework via 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition&#8208;aromatisation reaction sequence. The ability of C70 to efficiently harvest visible light, its long&#8208;triplet state lifetime, good photostability, and strong singlet oxygen generation potential (&#1060;&#8776;1), make it an efficient photoredox catalyst. Upon photoirradiation, C70 promotes the formation of singlet oxygen and superoxide radical via energy transfer (EnT) and single electron transfer (SET) mechanism, which acts as a potential oxidant in the formation of azomethine ylide through the oxidation&#8208;deprotonation tandem process, which further participates in [3 + 2]&#8208;cycloaddition reaction protocol with alkene/alkyne to give the corresponding pyrrolo[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinolines. Interestingly, this protocol allows the activation of a wide range of substrates giving access to a diverse library of 48 well&#8208;decorated pyrrolo[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinolines with good functional group tolerance.</dc:description>

         <title>Expedient Synthesis of Dihaloalkenynes via Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Haloalkynylation Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, the PdII&#8208;catalyzed construction of functionalized dihaloalkenynes from haloalkynes via a self&#8208;haloalkynylation reaction, without specialized ligands or oxidizing additives, is reported. The method tolerates a diverse range of haloalkynes, including electron&#8208;donating and electron&#8208;withdrawing functional groups, such as macrocyclic alkynols, spiro&#8208;oxy ring alkynols, and even carbazole&#8208;containing, pyrrolidine&#8208;2,5&#8208;dione&#8208;containing and silyl&#8208;protected bromoalkynes. Using an opposite lithium halide (LiX) to the haloalkyne starting material, remarkably high regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity of the haloalkynylation reaction is possible, yielding 1&#8208;bromo&#8208;2&#8208;chloroalkenyne or 2&#8208;bromo&#8208;1&#8208;chloroalkenyne products as desired.</dc:description>

         <title>Chloride&#8208;Free Electrolytes for High&#8208;Voltage Magnesium Metal Batteries: Challenges, Strategies, and Perspectives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 10, February 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A little light on electrolytes: We take a timely and comprehensive look at the criteria for high&#8208;voltage magnesium metal batteries (RMBs) from the viewpoint of high&#8208;voltage chloride&#8208;free electrolytes and the corresponding electrolyte/anode interphase. Potential high&#8208;voltage chloride&#8208;free electrolytes and the corresponding interphase degradation mechanisms are analyzed in depth.







Abstract
The demand for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density and safe energy storage devices has spurred increasing interest in high&#8208;voltage rechargeable magnesium batteries (RMB). As electrolytes are the bridge connecting the cathode and anode materials, the development of high&#8208;voltage electrolytes is the key factor in realizing high&#8208;voltage RMBs. This concept presents an overview of three chloride&#8208;free electrolyte systems with wide electrochemical windows, together with the degradation mechanisms and modification strategies at the anode/electrolyte interphase. Finally, future directions in stabilizing Mg anodes and realizing high&#8208;voltage RMBs are highlighted.

         <title>Emission and Luminescent Vapochromism Control of Octahedral Cu4I4 Complexes by Conformationally Restricted P,N Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 10, February 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The existence of two conformers with &#8220;compact&#8221; and &#8220;stretched&#8221; geometry of Cu4I4 demonstrating green and red emissions was established for the octahedral L2Cu4I4 complex with the conformationally restricted P,N&#8208;ligand. Stretching of the Cu4I4 core provides the drastic change of the emission and might be a reason for the dual emission of the Cu4I4 octahedral complexes.







Abstract
A conformationally restricted P,N&#8208;ligand capable of the design of polynuclear copper(I) complexes was synthesized via the reaction of primary pyridylphosphine, paraformaldehyde, and benzhydrylamine. The reaction of the ligand with copper(I) iodide leads to the tetranuclear copper(I) complex with the octahedral type of copper&#8208;iodide core. Different orientation of coordination bonds of the ligands relative to the P,N2&#8208;heterocyclic fragments and to the Cu4I4 cores leads to the existence of two types of conformers of the complex with &#8220;compact&#8221; or &#8220;stretched&#8221; geometry of the Cu4I4 cluster. This lability of the complex allowed for obtaining two crystalline phases displaying green or red luminescence. The TDDFT computations along with XRD structural analysis gave a strong interpretation of the green emission belonging to the &#8220;compact&#8221; form of the complex and belonging of the red emission to the &#8220;stretched&#8221; form. Moreover, both crystalline phases demonstrate the strong vapochromic responses of luminescence on the vapors of wide range of solvents.

Different orientation of coordination bonds of the ligands relative to the P,N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-heterocyclic fragments and to the Cu&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; cores leads to the existence of two types of conformers of the complex with &#8220;compact&#8221; or &#8220;stretched&#8221; geometry of the Cu&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; cluster. This lability of the complex allowed for obtaining two crystalline phases displaying green or red luminescence. The TDDFT computations along with XRD structural analysis gave a strong interpretation of the green emission belonging to the &#8220;compact&#8221; form of the complex and belonging of the red emission to the &#8220;stretched&#8221; form. Moreover, both crystalline phases demonstrate the strong vapochromic responses of luminescence on the vapors of wide range of solvents.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Nontoxic Artificial Chloride Channel Formation in Epithelial Cells by Isophthalic Acid&#8208;Based Small Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 10, February 16, 2023. </description>

Nontoxic Cl&#8722; transport: The work reports two structurally simple isophthalic acid&#8208;based systems that self&#8208;assemble via different intermolecular H&#8208;bonding and &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions to render artificial channels, which facilitate selective translocation of Cl&#8722; ions across liposomes and cells. Interestingly, the transport of Cl&#8722; ions by these ion channels across cell membranes do not exert any toxicity, even at elevated concentrations.







Abstract
Artificial channels capable of facilitating the transport of Cl&#8722; ions across cell membranes while being nontoxic to the cells are rare. Such synthetic ion channels can mimic the functions of membrane transport proteins and, therefore, have the potential to treat channelopathies by replacing defective ion channels. Here we report isophthalic acid&#8208;based structurally simple molecules 1&#8201;a and 2&#8201;a, which self&#8208;assemble to render supramolecular nanochannels that allow selective transport of Cl&#8722; ions. As evident from the single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis, the self&#8208;assembly is governed by intermolecular hydrogen bonding and &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions. The MD simulation studies for both 1&#8201;a and 2&#8201;a confirmed the formation of stable Cl&#8722; channel assembly in the lipid membrane and Cl&#8722; transport through them. The MQAE assay showed the efficacy of the compounds in delivering Cl&#8722; ions into cells, and the MTT assays proved that the compounds are nontoxic to cells even at a concentration of 100&#8197;&#956;M.

         <title>Preparation and Functionalization of Mono&#8208; and Polyfluoroepoxides via Fluoroalkylation of Carbonyl Electrophiles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 10, February 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a new synthetic methodology that allows tandem 1,2&#8208;addition and ring closure reactions between fluoroalkyl anion synthons and carbonyl electrophiles to form fluorinated epoxides. We clarify the generality of the reaction sequence by examining the fluoroalkyl requiremements. This approach enabled access to unique compounds that can be diversified through either ring opening or ring opening defluorinative functionalization reactions.







Abstract
We outline a new synthetic method to prepare mono&#8208; and polyfluoroepoxides from a diverse pool of electrophiles (ketones, acyl chlorides, esters) and fluoroalkyl anion equivalents. The initially formed &#945;&#8208;fluoro alkoxides undergo subsequent intramolecular ring closure when heated. We demonstrated the versatility of the method through the isolation of 16 mono&#8208; and polyfluoroepoxide products. These compounds provide unique entry points for further diversification via either fluoride migration coupled with ring opening, or defluorinative functionalization reactions, the latter of which can be used as a late&#8208;stage method to install select bioactive moieties. The reaction sequences described herein provide a pathway to functionalize the commonly observed products formed from 1,2&#8208;addition into carbonyl electrophiles

         <title>Fast and Cost&#8208;Efficient 17O&#8208;Isotopic Labeling of Carboxylic Groups in Biomolecules: From Free Amino Acids to Peptide Chains</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 10, February 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fast, user&#8208;friendly and cost&#8208;efficient labeling strategies were developed for 17O&#8208;enrichment of free amino acids, Fmoc/tBu&#8208;protected amino acids (produced on 1&#8197;g/day scale) and peptide side&#8208;chains (site&#8208;selective labeling). 17O&#8208;Labeled biomolecules were reproducibly obtained pure, in high synthetic yields (up to 85&#8201;%), and with high enrichment levels (&#8764;40&#8201;%).







Abstract
17O NMR spectroscopy is a powerful technique, which can provide unique information regarding the structure and reactivity of biomolecules. However, the low natural abundance of 17O (0.04&#8201;%) generally requires working with enriched samples, which are not easily accessible. Here, we present simple, fast and cost&#8208;efficient 17O&#8208;enrichment strategies for amino acids and peptides by using mechanochemistry. First, five unprotected amino acids were enriched under ambient conditions, consuming only microliter amounts of costly labeled water, and producing pure molecules with enrichment levels up to &#8764;40&#8201;%, yields &#8764;60&#8208;85&#8201;%, and no loss of optical purity. Subsequently, 17O&#8208;enriched Fmoc/tBu&#8208;protected amino acids were produced on a 1&#8197;g/day scale with high enrichment levels. Lastly, a site&#8208;selective 17O&#8208;labeling of carboxylic functions in peptide side&#8208;chains was achieved for RGD and GRGDS peptides, with &#8764;28&#8201;% enrichment level. For all molecules, 17O ssNMR spectra were recorded at 14.1 T in reasonable times, making this an important step forward for future NMR studies of biomolecules.

         <title>Substituent Effects in Iron Porphyrin Catalysts for the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 10, February 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The comparison of differently substituted iron porphyrins in their as&#8208;prepared state and after immobilization on carbon indicates no or only a weak interaction with the carbon support. Hydrogen evolution catalysis of the supported systems is improved by electron donating groups that destabilize an Fe(II) intermediate, presumably by assisting in the formation of a radical anion.







Abstract
For a future hydrogen economy, non&#8208;precious metal catalysts for the water splitting reactions are needed that can be implemented on a global scale. Metal&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;carbon (MNC) catalysts with active sites constituting a metal center with fourfold coordination of nitrogen (MN4) show promising performance, but an optimization rooted in structure&#8208;property relationships has been hampered by their low structural definition. Porphyrin model complexes are studied to transfer insights from well&#8208;defined molecules to MNC systems. This work combines experiment and theory to evaluate the influence of porphyrin substituents on the electronic and electrocatalytic properties of MN4 centers with respect to the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in aqueous electrolyte. We found that the choice of substituent affects their utilization on the carbon support and their electrocatalytic performance. We propose an HER mechanism for supported iron porphyrin complexes involving a [FeII(P&#8901;)]&#8722; radical anion intermediate, in which a porphinic nitrogen atom acts as an internal base. While this work focuses on the HER, the limited influence of a simultaneous interaction with the support and an aqueous electrolyte will likely be transferrable to other catalytic applications.

         <title>Preorganized Polyaromatic Soft Terdentate Hosts for the Capture of [Ln(&#946;&#8208;diketonate)3] Guests in Solution</title>

For its binding to the La(hfac)3 lanthanum container, the benzimidazole side arms of the terdentate ligand L1 must rotate to reach the cis&#8208;cis arrangement required for the formation of the heteroleptic [L1La(hfac)3] complex. The novel rigid, planar and cis&#8208;cis preorganized ligand L8 avoids this energy penalty and increases the overall stability of the final [L8La(hfac)3] complex by three orders of magnitude.







Abstract
The concept of preorganization is famous in coordination chemistry for having transformed flexible bidentate 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine scaffolds into rigid 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline platforms. The resulting boosted affinities for d&#8208;block cations has successfully paved the way for the design of a wealth of functional complexes, devices and materials for analysis and optics. Its extension toward terdentate homologues adapted for the selective complexation of f&#8208;block cations with larger coordination numbers remains more overlooked. The resulting rigidification of 2,6&#8208;bis(1&#8208;methyl&#8208;1H&#8208;benzo[d]imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)pyridine ligands (L1&#8211;L7) produces the highly preorganized and extended polyaromatic benzo[4&#8242;,5&#8242;]imidazo[1&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8201;:&#8201;1,2]pyrido[3,4&#8208;b]benzo[4,5]imidazo[1,2&#8208;h][1,7]naphthyridines (L8&#8211;L11) receptors, which offer some novel and rare opportunities for efficiently complexing trivalent lanthanides with polyaromatic soft terimine ligands. The crystal structures of the stable heteroleptic [LkLn(hfac)3] adducts (Lk=L1, L8, L9; Ln=La, Eu, Gd, Er, Yb, Y; H&#8208;hfac=1,1,1,5,5,5&#8208;hexafluoropentane&#8208;2,4&#8208;dione) show a drastic decrease in the Ln&#8722;N bond valences upon replacement of the flexible ligand L1 with its preorganized counterparts L8 and L9. This points to a limited match between the preorganized cavity and the entering [Ln(hfac)3] lanthanide containers. However, thermodynamic studies conducted in dichloromethane reach the opposite conclusion, with an improved affinity, by up to three orders of magnitude for catching Ln(hfac)3 when L1 is replaced by the preorganized L8&#8211;L9 receptors. The key to the enigma lies in the removal of the energy penalty which accompanies the formation of flexible [L1Ln(hfac)3] complexes in solution. This driving force overcomes the poor match between the preorganized terdentate N&#8745;N&#8745;N cavity in L8 and L9 and the size of trivalent lanthanides. As planned, the rigid, planar and extended &#960;&#8208;conjugated system found in L8 and L9 shifts the ligand&#8208;centered absorption bands by about 5000&#8197;cm&#8722;1 toward lower energies, a crucial point if these stable [L8Ln(hfac)3] and [L9Ln(hfac)3] platforms have to be considered for the visible sensitization of luminescent lanthanides in metallopolymers.

         <title>Fluorescence Turn&#8208;on of Tetraphenylethylene Derivative by Transfer from Cyclodextrin to Liposomes, HeLa Cells, and E. coli</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 10, February 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
It's fluorescence time! Although the tetraphenylethylene derivative (TPE&#8722;OH4) was fluorescence OFF state in &#947;&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#947;&#8208;CDx), the fluorescence turn&#8208;on was observed in the liposomes, HeLa cells, and E. coli, because TPE&#8722;OH4 was transferred from the &#947;&#8208;CDx cavity to the lipid or cell membranes.







Abstract
Herein, trimethyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (TMe&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CDx) and &#947;&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#947;&#8208;CDx) could dissolve a tetraphenylethylene derivative (TPE&#8722;OH4) in water through high&#8208;speed vibration milling. The fluorescence intensity of the TMe&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CDx&#8722;TPE&#8722;OH4 complex was much higher than that of the &#947;&#8208;CDx&#8722;TPE&#8722;OH4 complex, as the rotation of the central C=C double bond of TPE&#8722;OH4 after photoactivation was inhibited in a smaller TMe&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CDx cavity in comparison with the &#947;&#8208;CDx cavity. In contrast, the fluorescence intensity of the &#947;&#8208;CDx&#8722;TPE&#8722;OH4 complex was very weak; nevertheless, it increased after the addition of liposomes due to the transfer of TPE&#8722;OH4 from the &#947;&#8208;CDx cavity to the lipid membrane as a &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; phenomenon. Furthermore, to apply temperature sensor, it was demonstrated that the fluorescence intensity in the liposomes depended on the phase&#8208;transition temperature. By using the fluorescence turn&#8208;on phenomenon, TPE&#8722;OH4 could detect the presence of HeLa cells and E. coli by fluorescence.

         <title>C&#8208;Terminal Lipidation of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Fusion Peptide Reinstates Superior Membrane Fusion Catalytic Ability</title>

Making a link: C&#8208;Terminal myristoylation of fusion peptide restores the fusion&#8208;catalytic role of fusion peptide (FP). The lipid linker might restrict the localization of the C&#8197;terminus of the FP at the interface, assist the free dive of the N&#8197;terminus of the fusion peptide to the membrane, and bridge the viral membrane and host membrane through plasticity to promote the fusion.







Abstract
The spike (S) protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome&#8208;associated coronavirus&#8208;2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2) mediates a critical stage in infection, the fusion between viral and host membranes. The protein is categorized as a class&#8197;I viral fusion protein and has two distinct cleavage sites that can be activated by proteases. The activation deploys the fusion peptide (FP) for insertion into the target cell membranes. Recent studies including our experiments showed that the FP was unable to modulate the kinetics of fusion at a low peptide&#8208;to&#8208;lipid ratio akin to the spike density at the viral surface. Therefore, we modified the C&#8197;terminus of FP and attached a myristoyl chain (C&#8208;myr&#8208;FP) to restrict the C&#8197;terminus near to the interface, bridge both membranes, and increase the effective local concentration. The lipidated FP (C&#8208;myr&#8208;FP) of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 greatly accelerates membrane fusion at a low peptide&#8208;to&#8208;lipid ratio as compared to the FP with no lipidation. Biophysical experiments suggest that C&#8208;myr&#8208;FP adopts a helical structure, perturbs the membrane interface, and increases water penetration to catalyze fusion. Scrambled peptide (C&#8208;myr&#8208;sFP) and truncated peptide (C&#8208;myr&#8208;8FP) could not significantly catalyze the fusion, thus suggesting the important role of myristoylation and the N&#8197;terminus. C&#8208;myr&#8208;FP enhances murine coronavirus infection by promoting syncytia formation in L2 cells. The C&#8208;terminal lipidation of the FP might be a useful strategy to induce artificial fusion in biomedical applications.

The activation deploys the fusion peptide (FP) for insertion into the target cell membranes. Recent studies including our experiments showed that the FP was unable to modulate the kinetics of fusion at a low peptide-to-lipid ratio akin to the spike density at the viral surface.

The lipidated FP (C-myr-FP) of SARS-CoV-2 greatly accelerates membrane fusion at a low peptide-to-lipid ratio as compared to the FP with no lipidation. Biophysical experiments suggest that C-myr-FP adopts a helical structure, perturbs the membrane interface, and increases water penetration to catalyze fusion. Scrambled peptide (C-myr-sFP) and truncated peptide (C-myr-8FP) could not significantly catalyze the fusion, thus suggesting the important role of myristoylation and the N&#8197;terminus.

Two switches, three components, quadruple switchability: Tying together two types of anionic molecular switches with cationic macroions by self&#8208;assembly in an aqueous solution results in stable nano&#8208;objects, the size and shape of which can be changed by irradiation with two wavelengths, pH alteration, and darkness.







Abstract
Multi&#8208;switchable supramolecular nano&#8208;objects that respond to irradiation of different wavelengths with changes in size and shape have been built from two different water&#8208;soluble molecular switches, joined by attachment to the same polyelectrolyte. Accordingly, two wavelength&#8208;specific reactions, namely the excited&#8208;state proton dissociation of a photoacid and the cis&#8211;trans isomerization of an azo dye, are combined in one supramolecular nano&#8208;object that is stable in aqueous solution. The concept has potential in the fields of sensors, molecular motors, and transport.

         <title>Disproportionation and Ligand Lability in Low Oxidation State Boryl&#8208;Tin Chemistry

The carbene&#8208;stabilized distannyne and donor&#8208;free distannide systems (boryl)SnSn(IPrMe)(boryl) and K2[Sn2(boryl)2], can be synthesized from (boryl)Sn(NHC)Br using Mg(I) or K reducing agents. In contrast to their germanium congeners, systems of the type [Sn(boryl)]n are unstable with respect to disproportionation: NHC abstraction from (boryl)SnSn(IPrMe)(boryl) and 2&#8208;electron oxidation of K2[Sn2(boryl)2] both yield a 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 mixture of Sn(boryl)2 and the hexatin cluster, Sn6(boryl)4. A viable mechanism for this rearrangement is shown by quantum chemical studies to involve the vinylidene&#8208;type intermediate (boryl)2Sn=Sn.







Abstract
Boryltin compounds featuring the metal in the+1 or 0 oxidation states can be synthesized from the carbene&#8208;stabilized tin(II) bromide (boryl)Sn(NHC)Br (boryl={B(NDippCH)2}; NHC=C{(NiPrCMe)2}) by the use of strong reducing agents. The formation of the mono&#8208;carbene stabilized distannyne and donor&#8208;free distannide systems (boryl)SnSn(IPrMe)(boryl) (2) and K2[Sn2(boryl)2] (3), using Mg(I) and K reducing agents mirrors related germanium chemistry. In contrast to their lighter congeners, however, systems of the type [Sn(boryl)]n are unstable with respect to disproportionation. Carbene abstraction from 2 using BPh3, and two&#8208;electron oxidation of 3 both result in the formation of a 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 mixture of the Sn(II) compound Sn(boryl)2, and the hexatin cluster, Sn6(boryl)4 (4). A viable mechanism for this rearrangement is shown by quantum chemical studies to involve a vinylidene intermediate (analogous to the isolable germanium compound, (boryl)2Ge=Ge), which undergoes facile atom transfer to generate Sn(boryl)2 and trinuclear [Sn3(boryl)2]. The latter then dimerizes to give the observed hexametallic product 4, with independent studies showing that similar trigermanium species aggregate in analogous fashion.

         <title>Hydrogenation Reactions with Synergistic Catalysis of Pd single atoms and nanoparticles under Near&#8208;Ambient Conditions</title>

Synthesis of a synergistic catalyst of Pd single atoms and Pd nanoparticles is presented, which shows broad catalytic activity towards hydrogenation of organic nitro molecules and functional aromatics.







Abstract
Due to the limited resources and high cost of noble metals, boosting their catalytic activities is highly desired in the current catalysis industry. Here, we report a synergetic catalyst, combining Pd2+ and Pd0 species in a nitrogen&#8208;doped porous carbons (NPC), which shows boosted catalytic activities in hydrogenation reactions of organic nitro compounds (nitrobenzene, 4&#8208;nitrophenol, 1&#8208;nitronaphthalene and 1&#8208;nitropropane) under near ambient conditions. This synergetic catalyst NPC&#8208;[Pd] was synthesized by partial reduction of a palladium&#8208;loaded NPC. The catalytic activities and selectivity of NPC&#8208;[Pd] for hydrogenation were enhanced significantly compared with those of NPC&#8208;Pd2+ or NPC&#8208;Pd0 nanoparticles. Theoretical calculations show that H2 preferentially dissociates on Pd nanoparticles, and then organic molecules (nitrobenzene) can be captured and react with the dissociated H atom on Pd2+ sites. Similar reaction procedure also occur on Pt or Rh. Hydrogenation of different aromatic compounds with different functional groups (naphthalene, 4&#8208;nitrochlorobenzene, benzaldehyde and acetophenone) confirmed the broad excellent catalytic activity of this synergistic catalyst.

         <title>Edge&#8208;Decorated Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons by an Oxidative Coupling Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 10, February 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alkoxy highly edge&#8208;decorated polycylic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) have been formed. Oxidative cross coupling of phenols constructs frameworks without any need for the prefunctionalization required by conventional methods. Moreover, smaller optical gaps can be achieved relative to systems of similar size.







Abstract
Oxidative phenol coupling reduces reliance on halo/metalated substrates used in conventional redox neutral couplings. A new strategy for constructing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) that incorporates oxidative phenol coupling is outlined in a three&#8208;stage approach: oxidative fragment coupling, linking of the two resultant units, and oxidative cyclization. The protocol allows rapid assembly of both planar and helical systems with a high degree of edge functionalization. The incorporation of 12 alkoxy groups on systems with 12 rings gave rise to lower optical gaps compared to systems with a lesser degree of edge functionalization.

         <title>One Carbon Ring Expansion of Bipyrrole to Bipyridine Enables Access to a &#960;&#8208;Extended, Non&#8208;innocent, Corrole&#8208;like Ligand</title>

Diazatriphenylene was synthesized by a double, one&#8208;carbon&#8208;insertion reaction. Following elaboration, this key precursor allowed access to an unprecedented NiII&#8208;bipyricorrole radical and a cationic square planar complex upon one&#8208;electron oxidation.







Abstract
A &#960;&#8208;extended, diaza&#8208;triphenylene embedded, mono&#8208;anionic corrole analogue and its NiII complex were synthesized from a diaza&#8208;triphenylene precursor, which was obtained from a double one&#8208;carbon insertion into a naphthobipyrrole diester. Following conversion to the corresponding activated diol and acid&#8208;catalyzed condensation with pyrrole, subsequent reaction with pentafluorobenzaldehyde afforded mono&#8208;anionic, &#960;&#8208;extended bipyricorrole&#8208;like macrocycle. Attempted NiII insertion with Ni(OAc)2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;4H2O resulted an ESR active, NiII bipyricorrole radical complex, which was converted to a stable cationic NiII complex upon treatment with [(Et3O)+(SbCl6)&#8722;]. Both complexes were characterized by 1H and 13C&#8197;NMR, UV/Vis spectroscopy and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. The NiII bipyricorrole radical complex is converted to a cationic NiII complex by single&#8208;electron reduction using cobaltocene. Both the cationic NiII complex and the radical NiII complex exhibited ligand&#8208;centered redox behavior, whereas the NiII remains in the +2 oxidation state.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Diazatriphenylene&lt;/b&gt; was synthesized by a double, one-carbon-insertion reaction. Following elaboration, this key precursor allowed access to an unprecedented Ni&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;-bipyricorrole radical and a cationic square planar complex upon one-electron oxidation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &#960;-extended, diaza-triphenylene embedded, mono-anionic corrole analogue and its Ni&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; complex were synthesized from a diaza-triphenylene precursor, which was obtained from a double one-carbon insertion into a naphthobipyrrole diester. Following conversion to the corresponding activated diol and acid-catalyzed condensation with pyrrole, subsequent reaction with pentafluorobenzaldehyde afforded mono-anionic, &#960;-extended bipyricorrole-like macrocycle. Attempted Ni&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; insertion with Ni(OAc)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;4H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O resulted an ESR active, Ni&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; bipyricorrole radical complex, which was converted to a stable cationic Ni&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; complex upon treatment with [(Et&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(SbCl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;]. Both complexes were characterized by &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H and &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C&#8197;NMR, UV/Vis spectroscopy and single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. The Ni&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; bipyricorrole radical complex is converted to a cationic Ni&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; complex by single-electron reduction using cobaltocene. Both the cationic Ni&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; complex and the radical Ni&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; complex exhibited ligand-centered redox behavior, whereas the Ni&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; remains in the +2 oxidation state.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Boron&#8208;Mediated Regioselective Aromatic C&#8722;H Functionalization via an Aryl BF2 Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 10, February 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Regioselective functionalization of 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;azaarenes N&#8208;heteroarenes and aryl aldehydes has been achieved. The reaction proceeds via a BBr3 promoted 5 and 6&#8208;membered boracycle that undergoes a ligand exchange promoted by Selectfluor to give a previously scarce aryl BF2 species. The aryl BF2 is a bench stable intermediate that can be used for the deborylative functionalization of the 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;azaarenes scaffold.







Abstract
An efficient regioselective functionalization of 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;heteroarenes and aryl aldehydes via an azaaryl BF2 complex has been developed. Mechanistically the reaction comprises fluoride to bromide ligand exchange on an aryl boron species and consecutive C&#8722;B bond cleavage to deliver a broad range of functionalized products. The reaction is high yielding, has a broad substrate scope where several different heteroarenes can be functionalized with chloro, bromo, iodo, hydroxyl, amine and BF2 in a highly regioselective fashion. The method can be applied for late&#8208;stage functionalization or for rapid skeleton remodeling with for instance cross&#8208;couplings.

Primary resource: Hypervalent iodine&#8208;based aminating reagents containing a transferable (diarylmethylene)amino group can be used for the &#945;&#8208;amination of simple carbonyl compounds such as esters, amides, and ketones in the presence of a lithium base. The (diarylmethylene)amino groups of the products can be readily modified, thus providing access to primary amines and diarylmethylamines.







Abstract
Hypervalent iodine&#8208;based aminating reagents containing a transferable (diarylmethylene)amino group can be used for the &#945;&#8208;amination of simple carbonyl compounds such as esters, amides, and ketones in the presence of a lithium base. The (diarylmethylene)amino groups of the products can be readily modified, thus providing access to primary amines and diarylmethylamines. The developed method features transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions and a simple one&#8208;pot procedure without the need to prepare enolate equivalents separately, thus offering a general and practical approach to the synthesis of a wide variety of &#945;&#8208;amino carbonyl compounds. Experimental mechanistic investigations indicate that this amination proceeds through a unique radical coupling of an &#945;&#8208;carbonyl radical with an iminyl radical; they are generated through a single&#8208;electron transfer between a lithium enolate and the hypervalent iodine reagent.

         <title>Synthesis of Efficient and Stable Tetrabutylammonium Copper Halides with Dual Emissions for Warm White Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 10, February 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A warm welcome for a WLED: The synthesis of single&#8208;component phosphor, tetrabutylammonium copper halides, with dual broad&#8208;band emission (494 and 654&#8197;nm), high photoluminescent (PL) quantum yield (93.7&#8201;%) and large Stokes shift (150&#8197;nm) is reported. The resulting diodes emitted white light with a high color rendering index of 89 and correlated color temperature (CCT) of 4516&#8197;K.







Abstract
In order to achieve a high color&#8208;rendering index (CRI) and low correlated color temperature (CCT) indoor lighting, single&#8208;component phosphors with broad&#8208;band dual emission are in high demand for white&#8208;light&#8208;emitting diodes (WLEDs). However, phosphors with such fluorescent properties are rare at present. Herein, we report a facile solid&#8208;state chemical method for the synthesis of single&#8208;component phosphor with broad&#8208;band emission and a large Stokes shift that can meet the requirements of future white&#8208;light sources. These new tetrabutylammonium copper halides phosphors have excellent warm white emission characteristics, and their luminescence peaks are located at 494 and 654&#8197;nm. The optimized photoluminescence (PL) quantum yield can reach 93.7&#8201;%. The typical CIE coordinate of the as&#8208;fabricated WLED is at (0.3620, 0.3731) with a CRI of 89 and low CCT of 4516&#8197;K.

Gearing up for portable devices: A flexible, self&#8208;healing Zn&#8208;ion battery uses a freestanding cathode that is composed of a 3D gear&#8208;like NH4V4O10@C composite on carbon paper. The battery retained a capacity of over 102.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after being folded 60 times with a high angle of 180&#176;, and a better capacity retention of &gt;100&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after cutting and twisting to 90&#176;. The highly flexible, safe, aqueous Zn&#8208;ion battery opens up a practical way to power various carry&#8208;on electronic devices.







Abstract
A foldable battery with high flexibility provides great potential in various wearable electronic devices for health and fitness tracking, chronic disease management, performance monitoring, navigation tracking, and portable gears for soldiers. We report a highly flexible, self&#8208;healing Zn&#8208;ion battery with a free&#8208;standing cathode that is composed of a 3D gear&#8208;like NH4V4O10@C composite on carbon paper. The battery retained a capacity of up to 102.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 even after being folded 60 times with a high angle of 180&#176;. An aqueous hydrogel consisting polyvinyl alcohol, glycerin and Zn(CF3SO3)2 was used as electrolyte, which showed as high as 580&#8201;% tensile strain under a loading weight of 78&#8197;N. The battery exhibited a better capacity retention of over 100&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 and Coulombic efficiency of over 99.8&#8201;% after cutting and twisting to 90&#176;, thereby indicating a great self&#8208;healing performance. The gear&#8208;like geometry greatly improved the volume accommodation due to the increased interval space between the blades and the outward configuration. Meanwhile the Zn2+ ionic conductivity was improved by rapid re&#8208;binding of many existing hydroxy groups from the electrolyte and the enhanced contact surface area and diffusion route from the cathode material. The highly flexible, safe aqueous Zn&#8208;ion battery opens a practical way to power various carry&#8208;on electronics under mechanical agitation.

An aqueous hydrogel consisting polyvinyl alcohol, glycerin and Zn(CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was used as electrolyte, which showed as high as 580&#8201;% tensile strain under a loading weight of 78&#8197;N. The battery exhibited a better capacity retention of over 100&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and Coulombic efficiency of over 99.8&#8201;% after cutting and twisting to 90&#176;, thereby indicating a great self-healing performance. The gear-like geometry greatly improved the volume accommodation due to the increased interval space between the blades and the outward configuration. Meanwhile the Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ionic conductivity was improved by rapid re-binding of many existing hydroxy groups from the electrolyte and the enhanced contact surface area and diffusion route from the cathode material. The highly flexible, safe aqueous Zn-ion battery opens a practical way to power various carry-on electronics under mechanical agitation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

A highly efficient catalytic asymmetric Rubottom&#8208;type oxidation is described. Using meta&#8208;chloroperbenzoic acid (m&#8208;CPBA) as the oxidant and chiral calcium phosphate as the catalyst, the facile transformation enables direct hydroxylation of N&#8208;Boc oxindoles and &#946;&#8208;ketoesters in high yields (up to 99&#8201;%) and in a highly enantioenriched fashion (up to &gt;99&#8201;% ee).

         <title>Crystallographic Deciphering of Spontaneous Self&#8208;Assembly of Achiral Calciphores to Chiral Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 10, February 16, 2023. </description>

By manipulating a metal&#8208;deprivation strategy, a new skeleton of thiazolyl&#8208;pyridine natural product (thiapyricins) with calcium&#8208;binding property was discovered from metal&#8208;tolerant extremophile, Saccharothrix sp. TRM_47004. Their characteristic co&#8208;occurrence in the &#916;/&#923;&#8208;form of octahedral chirality visualizes achiral natural products assemble into chiral complexes.







Abstract
Thiapyricins (TPC&#8208;A/B, 1 and 2), which are new metallophore scaffolds exhibiting selective divalent cation binding property, were produced in response to metal&#8208;deprived conditions by Saccharothrix sp. TRM_47004 isolated from the Lop Nor Salt Lake. TPCs represent a thiazolyl&#8208;pyridine skeleton of a calcium&#8208;binding natural product, calciphore, owing to the selectivity to calcium ions among diverse metal ions. The thiapyricins exhibited notable co&#8208;crystalline characteristics of the apo&#8208; and holo&#8208;forms with racemic enantiomers comprising a pair of space isomers in a &#916;/&#923;&#8208;form. Therefore, we postulated a mechanism for the four&#8208;hierarchical self&#8208;assembly of achiral natural products into chiral complexes. Furthermore, their metal&#8208;chelating trait aided the adaptation of the host during metal starvation by increasing the production of TPCs. This study presents a structural paradigm of a new calciphore, provides insight into the mechanism of natural product assembly, and highlights the causality between the production of the metallophore and metallic habitats.

         <title>Energy Level, Crystal Morphology and Fluorescence Emission Tuning in Cocrystals via Molecular&#8208;Level Engineering</title>

New DCAF based charge transfer cocrystals with tunable energy level, crystal morphology and fluorescence emission were prepared via a cocrystal engineering method.







Abstract
Organic donor&#8208;acceptor complexes as new organic semiconductor class have attracted wide attention, due to their potential applications in functional optoelectronics. Herein, we present two new charge transfer cocrystals of di&#8208;cyanodiazafluorene &#8208;perylene (DCPE) and di&#8208;cyanodiazaflfluorene&#8208;pyrene (DCPY) through a rational cocrystal&#8208;engineering strategy. Although they are both 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 mixed stacking cocrystals with similar chemical structures, the DCPE cocrystal possesses a non&#8208;centrosymmetric space group and narrower band gap compared to DCPY cocrystal, because of the non&#8208;covalent bonding variation. The electrostatic potential accumulated in the lateral facets leads to highly twisted DCPE nanobelts, and the small band gap causes near infrared fluorescence. Meanwhile, the DCPY crystals with centrosymmetric space groups and weaker intermolecular interactions exhibited an untwisted morphology and red emission. This study will be helpful for the design and understanding of functional cocrystal materials that can be used in flexible micro/nano&#8208;mechanics, mechanical energy, and optical devices.

Diastereoisomer separation: Through the use of a well&#8208;defined enantiopure &#960;&#8208;allylic ruthenium(IV) precatalyst, facile access to enantioenriched indolin&#8208;3&#8208;one emitters was achieved. Facile separation of diastereoisomers demonstrated mirror image chiroptical responses.







Abstract
A novel enantiopure &#960;&#8208;allylruthenium(IV) precatalyst allowed the enantioselective and stereospecific allylations of indoles and gave access to indolin&#8208;3&#8208;ones, containing vicinal stereogenic centers. Facile separation of diastereoisomers exhibiting opposite circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) activities in diverse solvents, including water, demonstrated the potential of these sustainable transformations and of the newly prepared molecules.

Transcriptional immuno&#8208;CRISPR: A target&#8208;responsive CRISPR&#8208;Cas13d sensing system for proteins was rationally designed by dual&#8208;aptamer&#8208;based target recognition and binding&#8208;induced in&#8208;vitro transcription to trigger Cas13d&#8208;mediated signal amplification. Such a dual recognition/amplification mode enables protein detection with high specificity and sensitivity, expanding CRISPR&#8208;Cas13d diagnostic toolbox significantly.







Abstract
CRISPR&#8208;based biosensing technology has been emerging as a revolutionary diagnostic tool for many disease&#8208;related biomarkers. In particular, RspCas13d, a newly identified RNA&#8208;guided Cas13d ribonuclease derived from Ruminococcus sp., has shown great promise for accurate and sensitive detection of RNA due to its RNA sequence&#8208;specific recognition and robust collateral trans&#8208;cleavage activity. However, its diagnostic utility is limited to detecting nucleic&#8208;acid&#8208;related biomarkers. To address this limitation, herein we present a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration of a target&#8208;responsive CRISPR&#8208;Cas13d sensing system for protein biomarkers. This system was rationally designed by integrating a dual&#8208;aptamer&#8208;based transcription amplification strategy with CRISPR&#8208;Cas13d (DATAS&#8208;Cas13d), in which the protein binding initiates in&#8208;vitro RNA transcription followed by the activation of RspCas13d. Using a short fluorescent ssRNA as the signal reporter and cardiac troponin I (cTnI) as the model analyte, the DATAS&#8208;Cas13d system showed a wide linear range, low detection limit, and high specificity for the detection of cTnI in buffer and human serum. Thanks to the facile integration of various bioreceptors into the DATAS&#8208;Cas13d system, the method could be adapted to detecting a broad range of clinically relevant protein biomarkers, and thus broaden the medical applications of Cas13d&#8208;based diagnostics.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Transcriptional immuno-CRISPR&lt;/b&gt;: A target-responsive CRISPR-Cas13d sensing system for proteins was rationally designed by dual-aptamer-based target recognition and binding-induced in-vitro transcription to trigger Cas13d-mediated signal amplification. Such a dual recognition/amplification mode enables protein detection with high specificity and sensitivity, expanding CRISPR-Cas13d diagnostic toolbox significantly.

         <title>Proton&#8208;Induced Defect&#8208;Rich Vanadium Oxides as Reversible Polysulfide Conversion Sites for High&#8208;Performance Lithium Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 10, February 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Decreasing dissolution: A defect&#8208;rich sodium vanadium oxide with a proton doping nanobelt was fabricated and used as the functional interface layer in Li&#8208;S batteries. Benefiting from the abundant defects and catalytic activity, the dissolution of polysulfide was greatly decreased. The graphene layer contributes to accelerating the charge carrier. Therefore, the design of the electrode/separator interface layer is beneficial for achieving high&#8208;performance Li&#8208;S batteries.







Abstract
Lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries have attracted attention due to their high theoretical energy density, natural abundance, and low cost. However, the diffusion of polysulfides decreases the utilization and further degrades the battery's life. We have successfully fabricated a defect&#8208;rich layered sodium vanadium oxide with proton doping (HNVO) nanobelt and used it as the functional interface layer on the separator in Li&#8208;S batteries. Benefiting from the abundant defects of NVO and the catalytic activity of metal vanadium in the electrochemical process, the shuttle of polysulfides was greatly decreased by reversible chemical adsorption. Moreover, the extra graphene layer contributes to accelerating the charge carrier at high current densities. Therefore, a Li&#8208;S battery with G@HNVO delivers a high capacity of 1494.8&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.2&#8197;C and a superior cycling stability over 700 cycles at 1&#8197;C. This work provides an effective strategy for designing the electrode/separator interface layer to achieve high&#8208;performance Li&#8208;S batteries.

         <title>Acceleration Effect of Bowl&#8208;Shaped Structure in Aerobic Oxidation Reaction: Synthesis of Homosumanene ortho&#8208;Quinone and Azaacene&#8208;Fused Homosumanenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 10, February 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intrinsic strain in the molecule considerably accelerates the oxidation rate of peripheral carbons in aromatic compounds. The aerobic oxidation of hydroxyhomosumanene proceeds much faster than for the planar analogue because of their unusual keto&#8208;enol tautomerization caused by the curved structure. The homosumanene ortho&#8208;quinone was converted to several azaacene&#8208;fused homosumanenes, and their crystal structures, photophysical properties, and charge transport properties were investigated.







Abstract
An oxidation reaction of hydroxyhomosumanene on silica gel providing homosumanene ortho&#8208;quinone and its synthetic application for azaacene&#8208;fused homosumanenes is described. Hydroxyhomosumanene is photochemically oxidized by air, when it is coated on silica gel; this aerobic oxidation proceeds faster than that of planar analogues. The difference of such reactivity was attributed to the unusual keto&#8208;enol tautomerization due to structural difference between planar and curved &#960;&#8208;system. The homosumanene ortho&#8208;quinone was used in the synthesis of several azaacene&#8208;fused homosumanenes, azaacenohomosumanenes. X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis of the single crystals revealed their columnar stacking structures due to the interactions between each bowl. Azaacenohomosumanenes exhibited high electron affinity due to the combination of buckybowl and electron&#8208;deficient azaacene moieties.

         <title>Controlled Formation of Porous 2D Lattices from C3&#8208;symmetric Ph6&#8722;Me&#8208;Tribenzotriquinacene&#8208;OAc3</title>

STM investigation of temperature&#8208;controlled deposition of hexaphenyl&#8208;methyltribenzotriquinacene with thermolabile acetate groups revealed highly ordered coverage and temperature dependent self&#8208;assembly of this C3 symmetric structure. At higher temperature the structure flattens and interacts strongly with the metal substrate due to loss of all acetate groups and the methyl groups resulting in an unsaturated triquinacene core.







Abstract
The on&#8208;surface self&#8208;assembly of molecules to form holey nanographenes is a promising approach to control the properties of the resulting 2D lattice. Usually, planar molecules are utilized to prepare flat, structurally confined molecular layers, with only a few recent examples of warped precursors. However, control of the superstructures is limited thus far. Herein, we report the temperature&#8208;controlled self&#8208;assembly of a bowl&#8208;shaped, acetylated C3&#8208;symmetric hexaphenyltribenzotriquinacene derivative on Cu(111). Combining scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and density functional theory (DFT) confirms the formation of highly differing arrangements starting with &#960;&#8208;stacked bowl&#8208;to&#8208;bowl dimers at low coverage at room temperature via chiral honeycomb structures, an intermediate trigonal superstructure, followed by a fully carbon&#8208;based, flattened hexagonal superstructure formed by on&#8208;surface deacetylation, which is proposed as a precursor for holey graphene networks with unique defect structures.

Recent advances in long&#8208;wavelength light&#8208;emitting electrochemical cells (LECs) are reviewed from the perspectives of materials, including ionic transition metal complexes, small molecules, conjugated polymers, and perovskites, as well as device engineering. Device engineering techniques, including spectral modification by adjusting the microcavity effect, and light outcoupling enhancement, are also discussed. This review aims to pave the way for researchers to design materials and device engineering techniques for long&#8208;wavelength LECs in the applications of displays, bio&#8208;imaging, telecommunication, and night&#8208;vision displays.







Abstract
Long&#8208;wavelength light&#8208;emitting electrochemical cells (LECs) are potential deep&#8208;red and near infrared light sources with solution&#8208;processable simple device architecture, low&#8208;voltage operation, and compatibility with inert metal electrodes. Many scientific efforts have been made to material design and device engineering of the long&#8208;wavelength LECs over the past two decades. The materials designed the for long&#8208;wavelength LECs cover ionic transition metal complexes, small molecules, conjugated polymers, and perovskites. On the other hand, device engineering techniques, including spectral modification by adjusting microcavity effect, light outcoupling enhancement, energy down&#8208;conversion from color conversion layers, and adjusting intermolecular interactions, are also helpful in improving the device performance of long&#8208;wavelength LECs. In this review, recent advances in the long&#8208;wavelength LECs are reviewed from the viewpoints of materials and device engineering. Finally, discussions on conclusion and outlook indicate possible directions for future developments of the long&#8208;wavelength LECs. This review would like to pave the way for the researchers to design materials and device engineering techniques for the long&#8208;wavelength LECs in the applications of displays, bio&#8208;imaging, telecommunication, and night&#8208;vision displays.

&lt;p&gt;The roles of organic ammonium salts (OASs) which are widely used for the surface treatment of the perovskite film, including formation of 2D perovskites, direct surface passiviation, and other effects, have been reviewed. The influencing factors for these roles of OASs are also discussed, which are important for improved efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells.

         <title>Synthesis of Thioesters from Aldehydes via N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene (NHC) Catalyzed Radical Relay</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient reaction has been developed for thioesterification of aldehydes via radical relay by NHC catalysis. The key step is the coupling of the Breslow radical cation with the heteroatom radical (sulfur&#8208;radical). The excellent yields and broad substrate scope illustrated the efficiency of this strategy for achieving novel reactions via NHC catalysis.







Abstract
We have developed an efficient N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;catalyzed thioesterification of aldehydes using N&#8208;thiosuccinimides as the thiolation reagent. This organocatalyzed transition involves the generation of sulfur radicals by single electron transfer of the Breslow enolate (generated from aldehyde and NHC catalyst) with N&#8208;thiosuccinimides. This method offers facile access to various highly functionalized thioesters and exhibits good chemical yields and functional group tolerance.

         <title>Ge32Co9&#8722;x: Creating &#8220;Empty&#8221; Space by High Pressure</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The metastable phase Ge32Co9&#8722;x has been synthesized at high&#8208;pressure and temperature. It adopts a new structure type with three&#8208;core heteroclusters and unique chemical bonding. Units of three condensed cubes interconnect by sharing vertices and edges. As a result, two congruent frameworks interpenetrate while being separated by &#8220;empty space&#8221; housing lone pairs and covalent Ge&#8722;Ge bonds.







Abstract
The compound Ge32Co9&#8722;x (x=0.54(6), a=10.9861(3)&#8197;&#197;, space group Im
m) prepared under high pressure and at high temperature is metastable under ambient conditions. It crystallizes in a new structure type, Pearson symbol cI82&#8722;1.08. The crystal structure represents a slightly distorted cubic primitive arrangement of germanium atoms with part of the Ge cubes filled by cobalt. Analysis of the chemical bonding by real&#8208;space methods revealed three&#8208;core cluster units Ge16Co3 and seemingly empty regions comprising either covalent inter&#8208;polyhedral Ge&#8722;Ge bonds or lone&#8208;pairs located at the germanium atoms. The electrical conductivity is metal&#8208;like.

         <title>Probing Peptidylprolyl Bond cis/trans Status Using Distal 19F NMR Reporters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is demonstrated that incorporation of 4&#8208;fluorophenylalanine in model peptides provides an accurate and non&#8208;biased reporter of peptidylprolyl cis&#8208;trans conformational status by 19F NMR at physiological pH, even when several residues away from proline. In simple models, the prolyl bond conformational populations are predominantly governed by the amino acids local to proline and are conserved across different model systems.







Abstract
A method for measuring peptidylprolyl bond cis&#8208;trans conformational status in peptide models is described, using 4&#8208;fluorophenylalanine (4FPhe) as a distal reporter for 19F NMR. The %cis&#8208;Pro population was measured for peptides of the general structure Ac&#8208;X&#8208;Pro&#8208;Z&#8208;Ala&#8208;Ala&#8208;4FPhe (X and Z are proteinogenic amino acids) at pH&#8197;7.4, and provided conformational populations consistent with literature values obtained by more complex methods. This approach was applied to probe the prolyl bond status in pentapeptide models of the intrinsically disordered C&#8208;terminal region of &#945;&#8208;synuclein, which mirrored the preferences in the Ac&#8208;X&#8208;Pro&#8208;Z&#8208;Ala&#8208;4FPhe models. Advantageously, the 19F reporter group does not need to be adjacent to or attached to proline to provide quantifiable signals and distal 4&#8208;fluorophenylalanines can be placed so as not to influence prolyl bond conformation. Finally, we demonstrated that the prolyl bond status is not significantly affected by pH when there are ionisable amino acid residues at the carboxyl side of proline, which makes 19F NMR an invaluable tool with which to study proline isomerism at a range of pHs and in different solvents and buffers.

         <title>Selectivity Rule of Cryptands for Anions: Molecular Rigidity and Bonding Site</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cryptand cages with either &#8722;NH or &#8722;CH groups were computationally studied to identify their differences and determine the factors governing the anion preference. While the electrostatic interaction plays the predominating role in the capturing of halide anions by all CH/NH receptors, computational analyses revealed that the electrostatic attraction also rules the selectivity of &#8722;NH cryptands for halide anions. In contrast, the molecular rigidity governs the anion preference of &#8722;CH cryptands.







Abstract
Cryptands utilize inside CH or NH groups as hydrogen bond (H&#8208;bond) donors to capture anions such as halides. In this work, the nature and selectivity of confined hydrogen bonds inside cryptands were computationally analyzed with the energy decomposition scheme based on the block&#8208;localized wavefunction method (BLW&#8208;ED), aiming at an elucidation of governing factors in the binding between cryptands and anions. It was revealed that the intrinsic strengths of inward hydrogen bonds are dominated by the electrostatic attraction, while the anion preferences (selectivity) of inner CH and NH hydrogen bonds are governed by the Pauli exchange repulsion and electrostatic interaction, respectively. Typical conformers of cages are classified into two groups, including the C3(h)&#8208;symmetrical conformers, in which all halide anions are located near the centroids of cages, and the &#8220;semi&#8208;open&#8221; conformers, which exhibit shifted bonding sites for different halide anions. Accordingly, the difference in governing factors of selectivity is attributed to either the rigidity of cages or the binding site of anions for these two groups. In details, the C3 conformers of NH cryptands can be enlarged more remarkably than the C3(h)&#8208;symmetrical conformers of CH cryptands as the size of anion (ionic radius) increases, resulting in the relaxation of the Pauli repulsion and a dramatic reduction in electrostatic attraction, which eventually rules the selectivity of NH cryptands for halide anions. By contrary, the CH cryptands are more rigid and cannot effectively reduce the Pauli repulsion, which subsequently governs the anion preference. Unlike C3 conformers whose rigidity determines the selectivity, semi&#8208;open conformers exhibit different binding sites for different anions. From F&#8722; to I&#8722;, the bonding site shifts toward the outside end of the pocket inside the semi&#8208;open NH cryptand, leading to the significant reduction of the electrostatic interaction that dominates the anion preference. Differently, binding sites are much less affected by the size of anion inside the semi&#8208;open CH cryptand, in which the Pauli exchange repulsion remains the key factor for the selectivity of inner hydrogen bonds.

&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; conformers of NH cryptands can be enlarged more remarkably than the &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;3(h)&lt;/sub&gt;-symmetrical conformers of CH cryptands as the size of anion (ionic radius) increases, resulting in the relaxation of the Pauli repulsion and a dramatic reduction in electrostatic attraction, which eventually rules the selectivity of NH cryptands for halide anions. By contrary, the CH cryptands are more rigid and cannot effectively reduce the Pauli repulsion, which subsequently governs the anion preference. Unlike &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; conformers whose rigidity determines the selectivity, semi-open conformers exhibit different binding sites for different anions. From F&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; to I&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, the bonding site shifts toward the outside end of the pocket inside the semi-open NH cryptand, leading to the significant reduction of the electrostatic interaction that dominates the anion preference. Differently, binding sites are much less affected by the size of anion inside the semi-open CH cryptand, in which the Pauli exchange repulsion remains the key factor for the selectivity of inner hydrogen bonds.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>C&#8722;C and C&#8722;N Bond Activation, Lewis&#8208;Base Coordination and One&#8208; and Two&#8208;Electron Oxidation at a Linear Aminoborylene</title>

An isolable linear aminoborylene: A dicoordinate cyclic alkyl(amino)carbene (CAAC)&#8208;stabilized aminoborylene isoelectronic with an allene undergoes intramolecular C&#8722;C bond activation under photolytic conditions, intramolecular aryl migration in the presence of acetonitrile, one&#8208;electron oxidation with copper(I) halides to the corresponding haloboryl radicals, transition&#8208;metal&#8208;like binding of CO and reduction of N2O, sulfur and selenium, the latter yielding a terminal boraselenone.







Abstract
A cyclic alkyl(amino)carbene (CAAC)&#8208;stabilized dicoordinate aminoborylene is synthesized by the twofold reduction of a [(CAAC)BCl2(TMP)] (TMP=2,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidyl) precursor. NMR&#8208;spectroscopic, X&#8208;ray crystallographic and computational analyses confirm the cumulenic nature of the central C=B=N moiety. Irradiation of [(CAAC)B(TMP)] (2) resulted in an intramolecular C&#8722;C bond activation, leading to a doubly&#8208;fused C10BN heterocycle, while the reaction with acetonitrile resulted in an aryl migration from the CAAC to the acetonitrile nitrogen atom, concomitant with tautomerization of the latter to a boron&#8208;bound allylamino ligand. One&#8208;electron oxidation of 2 with CuX (X=Cl, Br) afforded the corresponding amino(halo)boryl radicals, which were characterized by EPR spectroscopy and DFT calculations. Placing 2 under an atmosphere of CO afforded the tricoordinate (CAAC,CO)&#8208;stabilized aminoborylene. Finally, the twofold oxidation of 2 with chalcogens led, in the case of N2O and sulfur, to the splitting of the B&#8722;CCAAC bond and formation of the 2,4&#8208;diamino&#8208;1,3,2,4&#8208;dichalcogenadiboretanes and CAAC&#8208;chalcogen adducts, whereas with selenium a monomeric boraselenone was isolated, which showed some degree of B&#8722;Se multiple bonding.

         <title>Phosphorus&#8208;Boron Multiple Bonding in the &#960; Radical HBP</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The multiply bonded &#960; radical HBP has been generated and characterized for the first time. Bonding analysis suggest that it differs from the isovalent HNB since the unpaired electron occupies one of the doubly degenerate &#960; bonding MOs, resulting in a B&#8722;P bond order of two and half.







Abstract
The HBP radical was generated via the reaction of laser ablated boron atom with PH3 in a solid neon matrix, which is identified via IR spectroscopy with isotopic substitutions and quantum chemical calculations. The results show that HBP has a 2&#928; electronic ground state with a short B&#8722;P bond. Bonding analysis indicates that besides an electron&#8208;sharing &#963; bond, there are two degenerate &#960; bonding orbitals that are occupied by three electrons, resulting in a bond order of two and half between P and B. This is in sharp contrast to the bonding properties of the isovalent HNB, which was characterized to be a N&#8801;B triply bonded &#963; radical with the unpaired electron locating on the B atom.

Total syntheses of geissoschizine&#8208;type monoterpenoid indole alkaloids (MTIAs) are reported. Intramolecular Pictet&#8208;Spengler cyclization was developed for the synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;villocarine&#8197;A.

Abstract
A series of hitherto unknown 5,14&#8208;diphenylbenzo[j]naphtho[2,1,8&#8208;def][2,7]phenanthrolines, containing a 5&#8208;azatetracene and a 2&#8208;azapyrene subunit, were prepared by combination of Pd&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions with a one&#8208;pot Povarov/cycloisomerization reaction. In the final key step four new bonds are formed in one step. The synthetic approach allows for a high degree of diversification of the heterocyclic core structure. The optical and electrochemical properties were studied experimentally and by DFT/TD&#8208;DFT and NICS calculations. Due to the presence of the 2&#8208;azapyrene subunit, the typical electronic nature and characteristics of the 5&#8208;azatetracene moiety are lost and the compounds are electronically and optically more related to 2&#8208;azapyrenes.

         <title>Highly Fluorescent Supramolecular Nanoring Composed of Bent&#8208;Shaped Cyanostilbene Derivatives and Cucurbit[8]urils</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we materialized zero dimensional supramolecular organic framework with enhanced emission. We designed bent&#8208;shape guest molecule by novel backbone &#8220;cyanostilbene&#8221;. This unique bent&#8208;shape molecule only emitted enhanced fluorescence with cucurbit[8]uril (CB[8]) as a host in water. This nano&#8208;confined emissive molecule also formed homogeneous system without bundling at the high concentration when it became complex with CB[8].







Abstract
Supramolecular organic frameworks (SOFs) made of organic guest molecule and cucurbit[8]uril (CB[8]) in aqueous solution have great potential for diverse applications. Herein, we designed highly fluorescent zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) nano&#8208;ring SOF with CB[8] as a host and novel bent&#8208;shaped cyanostilbene guest. This host&#8211;guest complex successfully formed macrocyclic hexamer and showed significantly enhanced fluorescence (&#934;F=68&#8201;%) compared to non&#8208;assembled monomer (&#934;F=2&#8201;%). Unlike other SOFs, this 0D SOF could be dispersed uniformly without bundling phenomenon in water.

&lt;p&gt;In this work, we materialized zero dimensional supramolecular organic framework with enhanced emission. We designed bent-shape guest molecule by novel backbone &#8220;cyanostilbene&#8221;. This unique bent-shape molecule only emitted enhanced fluorescence with cucurbit[8]uril (CB[8]) as a host in water. This nano-confined emissive molecule also formed homogeneous system without bundling at the high concentration when it became complex with CB[8].
&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Ab Initio Metadynamics Simulations of Hexafluoroisopropanol Solvent Effects: Synergistic Role of Solvent H&#8208;Bonding Networks and Solvent&#8208;Solute C&#8722;H/&#960; Interactions</title>

         <dc:description>
Ab initio metadynamics simulations under explicit solvent environments were performed to investigate the promotion effect of HFIP solvent in Friedel&#8211;Crafts alkylation and Cope rearrangement reactions. The H&#8208;bonding network and the HFIP&#8208;substrate C&#8722;H/&#960; interaction are identified as the major factors affecting reactivity.







Abstract
The solvent effects in Friedel&#8211;Crafts cycloalkylation of epoxides and Cope rearrangement of aldimines were investigated by using ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. Explicit molecular treatments were applied for both reactants and solvents. The reaction mechanisms were elucidated via free energy calculations based on metadynamics simulations. The results reveal that both reactions proceed in a concerted fashion. Key solvent&#8208;substrate interactions are identified from the structures of transition states with explicit solvent molecules. The remarkable promotion effect of hexafluoroisopropanol solvent is ascribed to the synergistic effect of H&#8208;bonding networks and C&#8722;H/&#960; interactions with substrates.

         <title>High&#8208;Tc 1D Phase&#8208;Transition Semiconductor Photoluminescent Material with Broadband Emission</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid perovskite photoelectric multifunctional material: [C7H13ONCH2F] PbBr3 (1) was successfully designed and synthesised. It realized the coupling of thermo&#8208;dielectric switching characteristics, semiconductor characteristics and photoluminescence characteristics of STE broadband emission.







Abstract
One dimensional (1D) organic&#8208;inorganic halide hybrid perovskites have the advantages of excellent organic cation modifiability and diversity of inorganic framework structures, which cannot be ignored in the development of multi&#8208;functional phase&#8208;transition materials in photoelectric and photovoltaic devices. Here, we have successfully modified and synthesized an organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid perovskite photoelectric multifunctional phase&#8208;transition material: [C7H13ONCH2F]&#8901;PbBr3 (1). The synergistic effect of the order double disorder transition of organic cations and the change of the degree of distortion of the inorganic framework leads to its high temperature reversible phase&#8208;transition point of Tc=374&#8197;K/346&#8197;K and its ultra&#8208;low loss high&#8208;quality dielectric switch response. Through in&#8208;depth research and calculation, compound 1 also has excellent semiconductor characteristics with a band gap of 3.06&#8197;eV and the photoluminescence characteristics of self&#8208;trapped exciton (STE) broadband emission. Undoubtedly, this modification strategy provides a new choice for the research field of organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid perovskite reversible phase&#8208;transition photoelectric multifunctional materials with rich coupling properties.

         <title>Thermo&#8208;Induced Bathochromic Emission in Columnar Discotic Liquid Crystals Realized by Intramolecular Planarization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Most organic thermochromic fluorescent materials exhibit thermo&#8208;induced hypsochromic emission due to the formation of excimers in ordered molecular solids; however, it is still a challenge to endow them with bathochromic emission despite its significance in making up the field of thermochromism. Here, we report a thermo&#8208;induced bathochromic emission in columnar discotic liquid crystals realized by intramolecular planarization of the mesogenic fluorophores. We synthesized a kind of three&#8208;armed discotic molecules of dialkylamino&#8208;tricyanotristyrylbenzenes, which preferred to twist out of the core plane to accommodate ordered molecular stacking in hexagonal columnar mesophases, giving rise to bright green monomer emission. However, intramolecular planarization of the mesogenic fluorophores occurred in isotropic liquid increasing the conjugation length, and as a result led to thermo&#8208;induced bathochromic emission from green to yellow light. This work reports a new concept in the thermochromic field and provides a novel strategy to achieve fluorescence tuning from intramolecular actions.</dc:description>

         <title>Control over Dethreading Kinetics Allows Evaluating&#160;the Entropy Stored in an Interlocked Molecular Machine Out&#8208;of&#8208;Equilibrium</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The operation of nanomachines is fundamentally different from that of their macroscopic counterparts. In particular, the role of solvent is critical yet rarely associated with machine functionality. Here we study a minimal model of one of the most advanced molecular machines to gain control of its operation by engineering components and the employed solvent. Operation kinetics were changed over more than four orders of magnitude and could be modulated by solvent. Leveraging solvent properties, it was possible to monitor the relaxation of the molecular machine towards equilibrium and measure the heat exchanged in the process. Our work expands the capabilities of acid&#8208;base powered molecular machines, confirming experimentally that such systems have a dominant entropy content.</dc:description>

         <title>Insights into the Conformational Plasticity of the Protein Kinase Akt1 by Multi&#8208;Lateral Dipolar Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The serine/threonine kinase Akt1 is part of the PI3K/Akt pathway and plays a key role in the regulation of various cellular processes such as cell growth, proliferation, and apoptosis. Here, we analysed the elasticity between the two domains of the kinase Akt1, connected by a flexible linker, recording a wide variety of distance restraints by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. We studied full length Akt1 and the influence of the cancer&#8208;associated mutation E17K. The conformational landscape in the presence of different modulators, like different types of inhibitors and membranes was presented, revealing a tuned flexibility between the two domains, dependent on the bound molecule.</dc:description>

         <title>Construction of a Diverse Range of Boron Heterocycles via Ring Expansion of a Carboranyl&#8208;Substituted 9&#8208;Borafluorene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Direct insertion of unsaturated substrates into a five&#8208;membered borole ring is a useful method to obtain valuable heterocycles containing one or more three&#8208;coordinate boron atoms. A 9&#8208;o&#8208;carboranyl&#8208;9&#8208;borafluorene, in which the&#160;o&#8208;carboranyl substituent is connected via one of the cluster carbon atoms to the boron atom of the 9&#8208;borafluorene unit, was found to react with a vast array of unsaturated molecules, such as alkynes, aldehydes and various organic azides, to form larger boraheterocyclic products. The ring expansion reactions of the central borole ring proceed rapidly at room temperature, cementing the role of the&#160;o&#8208;carboranyl substituent in enhancing the insertion reactivity of 9&#8208;borafluorenes.</dc:description>

         <title>A novel electrocatalyst Pd(II)@Ni3(HITP)2 for ultrasensitive detection of chloramphenicol: experimental and computational investigation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ultrasensitive electrochemical detection on hazardous substances like antibiotics and pesticides is essential but still challenging in rapid test technology. Herein, we proposed the first electrode using high conductive metal organic frameworks (HCMOFs) for electrochemical detection of chloramphenicol, and demonstrated that Pd can be loaded onto HCMOFs to design the electrocatalyst Pd(II)@Ni3(HITP)2 with ultra&#8208;sensitivity in detection of chloramphenicol. An ultra&#8208;low limit of detection (LOD) of 0.2 nM (64.6 pg/mL) was observed, which is 1&#8208;2 order of magnitude lower than those of the reported materials as well as chromatographic detection. Moreover, the proposed HCMOFs showed long&#8208;time stability over 24 h. The superior detection sensitivity can be attributed to the high conductivity of Ni3(HITP)2, and the large content of Pd loading. The experimental characterizations and computational investigation consistently point out that the Pd loading mechanism in Pd(II)@Ni3(HITP)2 is PdCl2 adsorption on the abundant adsorption sites of Ni3(HITP)2. The proposed electrochemical sensor design using HCMOFs was demonstrated to be both effective and efficient, showing that the adoption of HCMOFs decorated with other effective electrocatalysts, combining high conductivity and large loading of electrocatalysts, can be of great advantages for ultrasensitive detection.</dc:description>

         <title>Pd/Co Catalyst with High Pd Atom Utilization Efficiency for Nitrobenzene Hydrogenation at Room Temperature: Experimental and DFT Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Put to good use: A Pd&#8208;doped Co (Pd/Co) catalyst with high Pd atom utilization efficiency was designed and prepared for hydrogenation of nitroarenes. Its catalytic activity was much better than commercial Pd powder (&gt;150 times) in nitrobenzene hydrogenation reaction. This work might provide a simple and low&#8208;cost methodology to design and synthesize highly efficient catalysts.







Abstract
Enhancing catalytic performance as well as reducing catalyst cost are the eternal pursuit for the catalysis community. Herein, a simple and effective palladium&#8208;doped cobalt (Pd/Co) catalyst with high Pd atom utilization efficiency was synthesized via galvanic replacement reaction for the selective hydrogenation of nitrobenzene with H2 at room temperature, delivering &gt;99&#8201;% yield of aniline with up to 158 times higher catalytic activity than commercial palladium powder. Detailed characterizations and DFT calculations revealed that Co&#8722;Pd interaction leads to a decrease in electron density of Pd and the distance between Pd atoms that results in the enhanced catalytic performance. Further experiments indicated that the Pd/Co catalyst serves as a highly efficient, selective, and recyclable catalyst for a range of nitroarene substrates. This work might provide a green and sustainable methodology to design and synthesize highly active catalysts with high utilization efficiency of the noble metals in fundamental and applied research.

Travelling without moving: A Ferrier rearrangement/aza&#8208;Wacker cyclization on commercial glycals allows both a 3,4&#8208;cis amination at position three and a motion of the double bound restoring the glycal. Epoxidation/glycosylation of N&#8208;Ts 3&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;deoxygalactal provided disaccharide with high diastereoselectivity and yield, thus defining FAWEG (Ferrier/Aza&#8208;Wacker/Epoxidation/Glycosylation) as a new sequence to access 1,2&#8208;trans 3&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;deoxyglycosides.







Abstract
3&#8208;Amino&#8208;3&#8208;deoxyglycosides constitute an essential class of nitrogen&#8208;containing sugars. Among them, many important 3&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;deoxyglycosides possess a 1,2&#8208;trans relationship. In view of their numerous biological applications, the synthesis of 3&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;deoxyglycosyl donors giving rise to a 1,2&#8208;trans glycosidic linkage is thus an important challenge. Even though glycals are highly polyvalent donors, the synthesis and reactivity of 3&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;deoxyglycals have been little studied. In this work, we describe a new sequence, involving a Ferrier rearrangement and subsequent aza&#8208;Wacker cyclization that allows the rapid synthesis of orthogonally protected 3&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;deoxyglycals. Finally a 3&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;deoxygalactal derivative was submitted for the first time to an epoxidation/glycosylation with high yield and great diastereoselectivity, highlighting FAWEG (Ferrier/Aza&#8208;Wacker/Epoxidation/Glycosylation) as a new approach to access 1,2&#8208;trans 3&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;deoxyglycosides.

         <title>Morphological Evolution of Calcite Grown in Bipolar&#8208;Charged Hydrogels: Charge Effects Enhanced by Gel&#8208;Incorporation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The incorporation of charged biomacromolecules is widely found in biomineralization. To investigate the significance of this biological strategy for mineralization control, we examined gelatin&#8208;incorporated calcite crystals grown from gelatin hydrogels with different charge distributions along the gel networks. We found that the charged groups on gelatin networks (amino cations, &#8211;NH3+ and carboxylic anions, &#8211;COO&#8208;) play crucial roles in controlling the crystallinity and the crystal morphology. And the charge effects are greatly enhanced by the gel&#8208;incorporation because the gel networks force the charged groups to attach to crystallization fronts. In contrast, ammonium ions (NH4+) and acetate ions (Ac&#8208;) dissolve in the crystallization media do not exhibit the similar charge effects because they easily desorb from the crystallization fronts. Employing the revealed charge effects, the calcite crystal composites with different morphologies can be flexibly prepared.</dc:description>

         <title>Recognizing the Minimum Structural Units Driving the Crystallization of SAPO&#8208;34 in a Top&#8208;Down Process</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A top&#8208;down synthesis system was designed to study the crystallization of SAPO&#8208;34. Based on characterizations on a clear precursor solution with abundant nuclei and designed synthesis experiments, it was demonstrated that the formation of small species containing Si&#8722;O&#8722;Al bonds is crucial for driving the crystallization of SAPO&#8208;34, rather than structural units with specific spatial conformation.







Abstract
Recognizing the structure and nature of the nuclei for zeolites crystallization on an atomic level is of great importance, which can provide guidance on the control of crystallization kinetics and the rational synthesis of zeolites. However, it remains a long&#8208;standing challenge due to the difficulty in characterization of amorphous precursor with limited crystal nuclei. Herein, a top&#8208;down synthesis system was designed for SAPO&#8208;34 molecular sieve and well investigated. A clear precursor solution with abundant SAPO&#8208;34 crystal nuclei was obtained under a depolymerization&#8208;dominant condition. The species in the liquid precursor were identified by FT&#8208;ICR MS, solid&#8208;state MAS NMR and atomic pair distribution function analyses. In combination with various designed experiments, it is revealed that both the formation of small species containing Si&#8722;O&#8722;Al bonds and reaching a certain concentration, is crucial for driving the crystallization of SAPO&#8208;34, rather than structural units with specific spatial conformation. This work provides an important understanding on the (pre)nucleation of SAPO&#8208;34 and sheds light on the synthesis control of SAPO molecular sieves.

         <title>Enhancing the Activity of an Alcohol Dehydrogenase by Using &#8220;Aromatic Residue Scanning &#8221; at Potential Plasticity Sites</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An alcohol dehydrogenase LkADH was successfully engineered to exhibitimproved activity and substrate tolerance for the production of (S)&#8208;2&#8208;chloro&#8208;1&#8208;(3,4&#8208;difluorophenyl)ethanol, an important precursor of ticagrelor. Five potential hotspots were identified for enzyme mutagenesis by using natural residue abundance as an indicator to evaluate their potential plasticity. A semi&#8208;rational strategy named &#8220;aromatic residue scanning&#8221; was applied to randomly mutate these five sites simultaneously by using tyrosine, tryptophan, and phenylalanine as &#8220;exploratory residues&#8221; to introduce steric hindrance or potential &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions. The best variant Lk&#8208;S96Y/L199W identified with 17.2&#8208;fold improvement in catalytic efficiency could completely reduce up to 600 g/L (3.1 M) 2&#8208;chloro&#8208;1&#8208;(3,4&#8208;difluorophenyl)ethenone in 12 h with &gt;99.5% ee, giving the highest space&#8208;time yield ever reported. This study, therefore, offers a strategy for mutating alcohol dehydrogenase to reduce aromatic substrates and provides an efficient variant for the efficient synthesis of (S)&#8208;2&#8208;chloro&#8208;1&#8208;(3,4&#8208;difluorophenyl)ethanol.</dc:description>

         <title>Co2+ to Al3+ aliovalent substitution induced dual&#8208;site synergistic catalysis to Friedel&#8208;Crafts alkylation reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The dual&#8208;site synergistic effect in heterogeneous catalysis is quite interesting, and also complex because at least two substrate molecules are adsorbed or activated on the catalyst surface, which apparently needs two spatially separated and functionally independent active sites. It would become more difficult when the substrate molecules are large ones. The replacement of Al3+ in Al4B6O15 lattice with Co2+ leads to the formation of unsaturated Co2+ (4&#8208;fold coordination) along with oxygen vacancies (O v ). The former one behaves as a medium&#8208;strength Lewis acid site, and can adsorb and activate molecules with a nitro group (e.g., &#946;&#8208;nitrostyrene). The latter one can adsorb and activate oxygen species, which further activates the indole derivatives. Next, the spatially separated dual sites on the catalyst surface can synergistically and efficiently catalyze their Friedel&#8208;Crafts alkylation reactions under mild conditions. The high durability can be proved by the as&#8208;maintained high yields, i.e. 98%, 93%, 96%, 92% and 90% for 5 runs, respectively. The reaction kinetics obey the second&#8208;order characteristic. Annealing under hydrogen condition can further generate more surficial O v , leading to an improvement to the catalytic activity. A simple and probably routine aliovalent doping endows such a complex synergistic catalysis involving two large substrate molecules, providing an inspired perspective of developing dual&#8208;site catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of a B&#8208;Antigen Hexasaccharide, a B&#8208;Lewis b Heptasaccharide and Glycoconjugates Thereof to Investigate Binding Properties of Helicobacter pylori</title>

Introduction of the Gal&#8208;&#945;&#8208;(B)&#8208;determinant into a versatile Lacto&#8208;N&#8208;tetraose precursor followed by mono&#8208; or difucosylation afforded, after deprotection, the B&#8208;Lewis b heptasaccharide and the B&#8208;hexasaccharide structures, which were conjugated to BSA to yield glycoconjugates. Initial inhibition studies investigates the dependence of the binding to H. pylori strains on loading and the presence of B (Gal) and Lewis (Fuc) determinants.







Abstract
Infecting the stomach of almost 50&#8201;% of people, Helicobacter pylori is a causative agent of gastritis, peptic ulcers and stomach cancers. Interactions between bacterial membrane&#8208;bound lectin, Blood group Antigen Binding Adhesin (BabA), and human blood group antigens are key in the initiation of infection. Herein, the synthesis of a B&#8208;antigen hexasaccharide (B6) and a B&#8208;Lewis b heptasaccharide (BLeb7) and Bovine Serum Albumin glycoconjugates thereof is reported to assess the binding properties and preferences of BabA from different strains. From a previously reported trisaccharide acceptor a versatile key Lacto&#8208;N&#8208;tetraose tetrasaccharide intermediate was synthesized, which allowed us to explore various routes to the final targets, either via initial introduction of fucosyl residues followed by introduction of the B&#8208;determinant or vice versa. The first approach proved unsuccessful, whereas the second afforded the target structures in good yields. Protein conjugation using isothiocyanate methodology allowed us to reach high glycan loadings (up to 23 per protein) to mimic multivalent displays encountered in Nature. Protein glycoconjugate inhibition binding studies were performed with H. pylori strains displaying high or low affinity for Lewis b hexasaccharide structures showing that the binding to the high affinity strain was reduced due to the presence of the B&#8208;determinant in the Bleb7&#8208;conjugates and further reduced by the absence of the Lewis fucose residue in the B6&#8208;conjugate.

         <title>Effect of Mini&#8208;PEGs Modification on the Enzymatic Digestion of D&#8208;Amino Acid&#8208;Containing Peptides under the Action of PROK
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of mini&#8208;PEGs modified D&#8208;amino acid&#8208;containing peptides were synthesized. It was determined that the polyethylene glycol (PEG) modification promoted the enzymatic cleavage of the D&#8208;amino acid&#8208;containing peptides under the action of serine&#8208;like proteases.







Abstract
It was previously reported that D&#8208;amino acid&#8208;containing peptides exhibited the ability to resist enzymatic hydrolysis. This study investigated the influence of mini&#8208;PEGs modification on enzymatic hydrolysis ability of D&#8208;amino acid&#8208;containing peptides. The results showed that PEGylation promoted enzymatic hydrolysis of the D&#8208;amino acid&#8208;containing peptide, especially, the cleavage rate of the D&#8208;amino acid&#8208;containing peptide 6&#8208;w with PEG3 modification at the N&#8208;ends was up to 17 times higher in the presence of proteinase K (PROK) compared to those without PEG3 modification. Moreover, analysis of the enzymatic cleavage sites demonstrated a similar cleavage pattern of the PEGylated D&#8208;amino acid&#8208;containing peptide to that of the unmodified peptide. The computational simulations further showed that the enhanced enzymatic hydrolysis ability can be attributed to the strong interaction between PROK and the peptide after PEG3 modification and the resulting formation of a mature catalytic triad structure.

         <title>l&#8208;Serine is the Direct Precursor for the Pyrazine Ring Construction in the Biosynthesis of 3&#8208;Isobutyl&#8208;2&#8208;Methoxypyrazine in Bell Pepper Fruits (Capsicum annuum L.)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The biosynthetic pathway of 3&#8208;isobutyl&#8208;2&#8208;methoxypyrazine (IBMP) was investigated in plants using in&#8197;vivo feeding experiments with stable&#8208;isotope labeled precursors. It has been demonstrated that photorespiratory derived l&#8208;serine serves as a C2&#8208;builing block and an N&#8208;donor in IBMP&#8208;biosynthesis.







Abstract
3&#8208;Isobutyl&#8208;2&#8208;methoxypyrazine (IBMP) is an extremely potent odorant and responsible for the specific aroma of many fruits and vegetables. Especially bell pepper contains high levels of IBMP, which is the character impact compound of its typical aroma. However, since the discovery of methoxypyrazines in plants in the 1960s the biosynthesis of their pyrazine ring motif remained so far unknown. Therefore, the biosynthetic pathway to IBMP was investigated by feeding experiments with stable&#8208;isotope labeled precursors. For the first time it could be shown that l&#8208;serine plays a key role in the pyrazine ring construction of 3&#8208;alkyl&#8208;2&#8208;methoxypyrazines (MPs). Based on HS&#8208;SPME&#8208;GCxGC&#8208;TOF&#8208;MS analysis, it is shown that the biosynthetic pathway to IBMP is closely linked to photorespiratory derived l&#8208;serine.

         <title>Asymmetrical Platinum and Rhodium Dinuclear Complex Strongly Bound to Filled d
 Complexes by Unbridged Pt&#8722;Metal Bonds: Toward Heterometallic&#8208;Extended Metal Atom Chains</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Line up, line up! HOMO&#8208;LUMO interactions between metal d
 orbitals were used to synthesize hetero&#8208;xtended metal atom chains (EMACs) for tuning the number of nuclei and metal species. Mixing an asymmetrical Pt&#8722;Rh dinuclear complex with a LUMO in the &#963;* orbital and a mononuclear complex with a HOMO in the d
 orbital allows two&#8208;step multinucleation, affording hetero&#8208;EMACs with three well&#8208;aligned metal species.







Abstract
Heterometallic extended metal atom chains (EMACs) aligned with three types of metal were rationally synthesized by forming unbridged metal&#8722;metal bonds based on the interactions between highest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals at the d
 orbital. These chains form pentanuclear structures aligned as Rh&#8722;Pt&#8722;M&#8722;Pt&#8722;Rh with relatively large formation constants of 5.0&#215;1013&#8197;M&#8722;2 for M=Pt and 6.3&#215;1011&#8197;M&#8722;2 for M=Pd, while retaining their backbones in solution. In the case of M=Cu, the original Cu(+2) atoms were reduced to Cu(+1) during the synthetic process. Cu(+1) has an unprecedented trigonal bipyramidal coordination geometry. The reported synthesis based on asymmetrical dinuclear complexes provides a guideline for the synthesis of hetero&#8208;EMACs to allow several analogs through judicious combinations realized by tuning the number of metal nuclei and metal species.

A low&#8208;cost and environmentally benign iron(III) catalyst triggers a novel cascade reaction paving the way to synthesize various heterocycles and spirocycles. Appropriate design of substrates by using simple starting materials could provide access to biologically and synthetically useful products as depicted through the generation of exquisite alpana art decorated with simple flowers. The putative mechanistic cycle represented herein tries to shed some light on the inherent chemistry involved with this methodology. More information can be found in the Research Article by S.

         <title>Fabricating Robust Pt Clusters on Sn&#8208;Doped CeO2 for CO Oxidation: A Deep Insight into Support Engineering and Surface Structural Evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reported on a simple Sn&#8208;doped CeO2 approach to create oxygen&#8208;rich vacancies, and investigated the impact of such vacancies on the CO oxidation performance of Pt/CSO&#8208;a catalysts. The oxygen vacancies were found to limit Pt agglomeration and promote a smaller particle size of the Pt/CSO&#8208;a catalyst. The smaller particle size led to more exposed active sites, which enhanced the ability to activate oxygen and improve the catalytic activity towards CO oxidation.







Abstract
The size effect on nanoparticles, which affects the catalysis performance in a significant way, is crucial. The tuning of oxygen vacancies on metal&#8208;oxide support can help reduce the size of the particles in active clusters of Pt, thus improving catalysis performance of the supported catalyst. Herein, Ce&#8722;Sn solid solutions (CSO) with abundant oxygen vacancies have been synthesized. Activated by simple CO reduction after loading Pt species, the catalytic CO oxidation performance of Pt/CSO was significantly better than that of Pt/CeO2. The reasons for the elevated activity were further explored regarding ionic Pt single sites being transformed into active Pt clusters after CO reduction. Due to more exposed oxygen vacancies, much smaller Pt clusters were created on CSO (ca. 1.2&#8197;nm) than on CeO2 (ca. 1.8&#8197;nm). Consequently, more exposed active Pt clusters significantly improved the ability to activate oxygen and directly translated to the higher catalytic oxidation performance of activated Pt/CSO catalysts in vehicle emission control applications.

Metal&#8208;organic framework or smoked meat sandwiches? A novel orthogonalized aryl&#8208;phosphonate linker is used to direct formation of porous open frameworks. The network structures are highly dependent on the inclusion and structure of the guest aromatic compounds.







Abstract
The reliable self&#8208;assembly of microporous metal&#8208;phosphonate materials remains a longstanding challenge. This stems from, generally, more coordination modes for the functional group allowing more dense structures, and stronger bonding driving less crystalline products. Here, a novel orthogonalized aryl&#8208;phosphonate linker, 1,3,5&#8208;tris(4&#8217;&#8208;phosphono&#8208;2&#8217;,6&#8217;&#8208;dimethylphenyl) benzene (H6L3) has been used to direct formation of open frameworks. The peripheral aryl rings of H6L3 are orthogonalized relative to the central aromatic ring giving a tri&#8208;cleft conformation of the linker in which small aromatic molecules can readily associate. When coordinated to magnesium ions, a series of porous crystalline metal&#8208;organic, and hydrogen&#8208;bonded metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs, HMOFs) are formed (CALF&#8208;41 (Mg), HCALF&#8208;42 (Mg), &#8208;43 (Mg)). While most metal&#8208;organic frameworks are tailored based on choice of metal and linker, here, the network structures are highly dependent on the inclusion and structure of the guest aromatic compounds. Larger guests, and a higher stoichiometry of metal, result in increased solvation of the metal ion, resulting in networks with connectivities increasingly involving hydrogen&#8208;bonds rather than direct phosphonate coordination. Upon thermal activation and aromatic template removal, the materials exhibit surface areas ranging from 400&#8211;600&#8197;m2/g. Self&#8208;assembly in the absence of aromatic guests yields mixtures of phases, frequently co&#8208;producing a dense 3&#8208;fold interpenetrated structure (1). Interestingly, a series of both more porous (530&#8211;900&#8197;m2/g), and more robust solids is formed by complexing with trivalent metal ions (Al, Ga, In) with aromatic guest; however, these are only attainable as microcrystalline powders. The polyprotic nature of phosphonate linkers enables structural analogy to the divalent analogues and these are identified as CALF&#8208;41 analogues. Finally, insights to the structural transformations during metal ion desolvation in this family are gained by considering a pair of structurally related Co materials, whose hydrogen&#8208;bonded (HCALF&#8208;44 (Co)) and desolvated (CALF&#8208;44 (Co)) coordination bonded networks were fully structurally characterized.

&lt;p&gt;The reliable self-assembly of microporous metal-phosphonate materials remains a longstanding challenge. This stems from, generally, more coordination modes for the functional group allowing more dense structures, and stronger bonding driving less crystalline products. Here, a novel orthogonalized aryl-phosphonate linker, 1,3,5-tris(4&#8217;-phosphono-2&#8217;,6&#8217;-dimethylphenyl) benzene (H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;L3) has been used to direct formation of open frameworks. The peripheral aryl rings of H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;L3 are orthogonalized relative to the central aromatic ring giving a tri-cleft conformation of the linker in which small aromatic molecules can readily associate. When coordinated to magnesium ions, a series of porous crystalline metal-organic, and hydrogen-bonded metal-organic frameworks (MOFs, HMOFs) are formed (CALF-41 (Mg), HCALF-42 (Mg), -43 (Mg)). While most metal-organic frameworks are tailored based on choice of metal and linker, here, the network structures are highly dependent on the inclusion and structure of the guest aromatic compounds. Larger guests, and a higher stoichiometry of metal, result in increased solvation of the metal ion, resulting in networks with connectivities increasingly involving hydrogen-bonds rather than direct phosphonate coordination.

Collaborative work: The synthesis of a new monoboranyl ligand scaffold is described. This ambiphilic diphosphine allows for the cooperative coordination of organonitriles in partnership with nickel(0).







Abstract
Metal&#8208;ligand cooperation has emerged as a versatile tool for substrate activation in chemical reactivity. Herein, we provide the synthesis and characterization of a monoboranyl&#8208;containing analogue of the ubiquitous bulky diphosphine ligand, 1,2&#8208;bis(di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphosphino)ethane, whose reactivity has been examined using nickel. Together, the pairing of nickel and boron provides a platform that allows for the cooperative coordination of organonitriles, giving unusual examples of intermolecularly bound dinickelacycles.

         <title>Heterophenoquinones: Tuning Optoelectronics and Electrochromicity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the synthesis and optoelectronic properties of 16 thiophene&#8208;based heterophenoquinones. These compounds were accessed in a convergent and modular approach, allowing for their efficient synthesis. Tuning of the optical band gap was achieved through &#960;&#8208;extension by annulation of a benzene or tropone moiety to the thiophene, oxidation, change of the heteroatom or by attachment of a donor substituent to the thiophene core. The resulting compounds display intense colors covering the entire visible spectrum. We identified structure &#8208; property relationships and their impact on the HOMO and LUMO levels. Additionally, these materials change color upon reduction and according to in situ ultraviolet&#8208;visible&#8208;near infrared (UV&#8208;vis&#8208;NIR) and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectro&#8208;electrochemistry, they are promising electrochromes with cathodic color changes. Seven different electrochromic devices were constructed which all displayed a change in colour upon reduction, demonstrating the potential of these new dyes in e.g. tintable glass.</dc:description>

         <title>Detection of Large Genomic RNA via DNAzyme&#8208;Mediated RNA Cleavage and Rolling Circle Amplification: SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 as a Model</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report on a new method for the detection of genomic RNA that combines RNA cleavage by the 10&#8208;23 DNAzyme and use of the cleavage fragments as primers to initiate rolling circle amplification (RCA). We first screened 230 different 10&#8208;23 DNAzyme variants to identify those that target accessible RNA sites within the highly structured RNA transcripts of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. A total of 28 DNAzymes were identified with &gt;20% cleavage, 5 with &gt;40% cleavage and one with &gt;60% in 10 min. The cleavage fragments from these reactions were then screened for coupling to an RCA reaction, leading to the identification of several cleavage fragments that could efficiently initiate RCA. Using a newly developed quasi&#8208;exponential RCA method with a detection limit of 500 aM of RNA, we evaluated 14 RT&#8208;PCR positive and 15 RT&#8208;PCR negative patient saliva samples for SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 genomic RNA, achieving a clinical sensitivity of 86% and specificity of 100% for detection of the virus in &lt;2.5 hours.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemo&#8208;enzymatic synthesis of long&#8208;chain oligosaccharides for studying xylan&#8208;modifying enzymes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Plant research is hampered in several aspects by a lack of pure oligosaccharide samples that closely represent structural features of cell wall glycans. An alternative to purely chemical synthesis to access these oligosaccharides is chemo&#8208;enzymatic synthesis using glycosynthases. These enzymes enable the ligation of oligosaccharide donors, when activated for example as a&#8208;glycosyl fluorides, with suitable acceptor oligosaccharides. Herein, the synthesis of xylan oligosaccharides up to dodecasaccharides is reported, with glycosynthase&#8208;mediated coupling reactions as key steps. The xylo&#8208;oligosaccharide donors were protected at the non&#8208;reducing end with a 4&#8208;O&#8208;tetrahydropyranyl (THP) group to prevent polymerization. Installation of an unnatural 3&#8208;O&#8208;methylether substituent at the reducing end xylose of the oligosaccharides ensured good water solubility. Biochemical assays demonstrated enzymatic activity for the xylan acetyltransferase XOAT1 from Arabidopsis thaliana, xylan arabinofuranosyl&#8208;transferase XAT3 enzymes from rice and switchgrass, and the xylan glucuronosyltransferase GUX3 from Arabidopsis thaliana. In case of the glucuronosyltransferase GUX3, MALDI&#8208;MS/MS analysis of the reaction product suggested that a single glucuronosyl substituent was installed primarily at the central xylose residues of the dodecasaccharide acceptor, demonstrating the value of long&#8208;chain acceptors for assaying biosynthetic glycosyltransferases.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Plant research is hampered in several aspects by a lack of pure oligosaccharide samples that closely represent structural features of cell wall glycans. An alternative to purely chemical synthesis to access these oligosaccharides is chemo-enzymatic synthesis using glycosynthases. These enzymes enable the ligation of oligosaccharide donors, when activated for example as a-glycosyl fluorides, with suitable acceptor oligosaccharides. Herein, the synthesis of xylan oligosaccharides up to dodecasaccharides is reported, with glycosynthase-mediated coupling reactions as key steps. The xylo-oligosaccharide donors were protected at the non-reducing end with a 4-O-tetrahydropyranyl (THP) group to prevent polymerization. Installation of an unnatural 3-O-methylether substituent at the reducing end xylose of the oligosaccharides ensured good water solubility. Biochemical assays demonstrated enzymatic activity for the xylan acetyltransferase XOAT1 from Arabidopsis thaliana, xylan arabinofuranosyl-transferase XAT3 enzymes from rice and switchgrass, and the xylan glucuronosyltransferase GUX3 from Arabidopsis thaliana. In case of the glucuronosyltransferase GUX3, MALDI-MS/MS analysis of the reaction product suggested that a single glucuronosyl substituent was installed primarily at the central xylose residues of the dodecasaccharide acceptor, demonstrating the value of long-chain acceptors for assaying biosynthetic glycosyltransferases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hemipiperazines are a recently discovered class of peptide&#8208;derived molecular photoswitches with high biocompatibility and therapeutic potential. Here, for the first time we describe photochromism of heterocyclic hemipiperazines. They demonstrate long thermal lifetimes, enlarged band separation between photoisomers. Efficient photoisomerization occurs under aqueous conditions, although with a need for organic co&#8208;solvent. Bidirectional switching with visible light is observed for an extended aromatic system.</dc:description>

         <title>Isomerization of DASA Molecules in the Nanopores of Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks: What Determines Its Reversibility?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In recent years, light responsive molecules have been incorporated in metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) to fabricate light&#8208;responsive intelligent devices, where reversible isomerization of the guest molecules in the nanopores is crucial. However, how to design porous environment of MOFs to achieve a reversible isomerization remains unknown until now. In this work, donor&#8208;acceptor Stenhouse adduct (DASA), a new kind of visible light responsive compounds, were confined in the nanopores of different MOFs to study their isomerization upon visible light irradiation/mild heating. We found that the polarity of the pore environment is the key to control the reversibility of isomerization of such guest molecules. Under the guidance of this principle, MIL&#8208;53(Al) was screened to investigate proton conductivity and switching performance of the DASA confined MOF. The proton conductance was up to 0.013 S cm&#8208;1 at 80 &#8451; and 98% RH, and at least 30 switching cycles were achieved thanks to the Grotthuss&#8208;type mechanism and low polarity of MIL&#8208;53(Al) pore environment.</dc:description>

         <title>Progress of Azametallacyclopentadienes in the New Century</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As the key intermediates in metal promoted/catalyzed C&#8210;C bond coupling reactions of nitriles and alkynes, azametallacyclopentadienes, M(N=CR1&#8210;CR2=CR3), are an important class of azametallacycles. Although the first authentic azametallacyclopentadienes were documented in 1986, their chemistry towards solid&#8208;state structures, intrinsic reactivity and synthetic application was rarely investigated for a long time. At the beginning of this century, seminal works about the applications of azametallacyclopentadienes in the synthesis of heterocycles, including multi&#8208;substituted pyridines, isoquinolines, furans and pyrroles were reported. Subsequently, a series of new complexes with this motif, namely the group 4, aluminum, actinide and rare&#8208;earth azametallacyclopentadienes were isolated and structurally characterized. Among them, the rare&#8208;earth metallacyclopentadiene expresses high reactivity towards unsaturated molecules, such as nitriles, isocyanides and Mo(CO)6 to provide novel fused metallacycles. In this concept, we summarized the advances towards the preparation, reactivity and synthetic application of azametallacyclopentadienes in past twenty years.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective transformations from nitriles to NH2&#8208;&#945;&#8208;tertiary amines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic molecules, containing one or more amine chiral centers, are very common to see in natural products and medicines. Although a large number of methods have been developed to afford enantiopure amines, most of the known approaches are limited with various reasons. For example, many methodologies start from nitrogen protected and activated substrates, which usually need multistep operations and seriously decrease the atom economy. Here we disclose a new catalytic strategy from commercial nitriles to high enantioselective &#945;&#8208;tertiary primary amines in up to 90% yield and 95% enantiomeric excess. This transformation firstly undergoes an addition process of organolithium reagents to nitriles to generate the imine intermediates in situ. Subsequently, the most challenging step is by employing copper catalytic enantioselective addition of AllylBpin to the imine intermediates to form the final amines in one pot.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sequence&#8208;defined polymer is one of the most promising alternative media for high&#8208;density data storage. It could be used to alleviate the problem of insufficient storage capacity of conventional silicon&#8208;based devices for the explosively increasing data. To fulfil the goal of polymer data storage, suitable methods should be developed to accurately read and decode the information&#8208;containing polymers, especially for those composed by a combination of the natural and unnatural monomers. Nanopore&#8208;based approaches have become one of the most competitive analysis and sequencing techniques, which are expected to read both natural and synthetic polymers with single&#8208;molecule precision and monomeric resolution. Herein, this work emphasizes the advances being made in nanopore reading and decoding of information stored in the man&#8208;made polymers and DNA nanostructures, and discusses the challenges and opportunities towards the development and realization of high&#8208;density data storage.</dc:description>

         <title>Cysteine&#8208;Selective Modification of Peptides and Proteins via Desulfurative C&#8722;C Bond Formation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cysteine&#8208;selective, visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated bioconjugation reaction that enables direct installation of a range of desired moieties into peptide and protein scaffolds via C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) bond formation is described. The method is rapid, operationally simple, tolerant to ambient atmosphere and can be utilized to incorporate general tools for chemical biology, including effective PTM mimics, via a stable, biogenic hydrocarbon linkage.







Abstract
The site&#8208;selective modification of peptides and proteins facilitates the preparation of targeted therapeutic agents and tools to interrogate biochemical pathways. Among the numerous bioconjugation techniques developed to install groups of interest, those that generate C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) bonds are significantly underrepresented despite affording proteolytically stable, biogenic linkages. Herein, a visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated reaction is described that enables the site&#8208;selective modification of peptides and proteins via desulfurative C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) bond formation. The reaction is rapid and high yielding in peptide systems, with comparable translation to proteins. Using this chemistry, a range of moieties is installed into model systems and an effective PTM&#8208;mimic is successfully integrated into a recombinantly expressed histone.

Photo&#8208;assisted metal air battery: The diagram exhibits an integrated photo&#8208;assisted metal air battery with the typical two&#8208;electrode configuration. This minireview introduces the general photo&#8208;assisted strategies and summarizes the recent advances of various photo&#8208;assisted metal air battery systems including Li&#8722;O2 battery, Zn&#8722;O2 battery and other metal&#8208;air batteries and highlights the remaining challenges and future opportunities.







Abstract
To meet the need of high energy density, long durability, safe and cost&#8208;efficient energy conversion and storage devices, metal&#8208;air batteries like Li&#8722;O2 and Zn&#8722;O2 batteries have received enormous attention and were subject to exciting development in the past decade. Photo&#8208;assisted strategies that enable the effective combination of photo/electric energy conversion/storage render a new dimension for the conventional metal&#8208;air batteries techniques with mere electric energy utilization. Therefore, tremendous research is ongoing in search of more efficient and durable devices with photo&#8208;assisted strategies. This review provides an overview of photo&#8208;assisted Li&#8722;O2 batteries, Zn&#8722;O2 batteries, and batteries with various metal/air components. The working mechanism, the basic device architecture and practical performances of various photo&#8208;assisted systems are summarized and discussed. Furthermore, certain technical challenges and future opportunities for the photo&#8208;assisted metal air batteries are emphasized and discussed in the hope of stimulating further research.

Synthesis of overcrowded negatively curved polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. A hexabrominated benzo&#8208;fused tris&#8208;cycloheptenylene was &#960;&#8208;extended by Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling to afford PAHs consisting of two heptagons and one octagon as a consequence of a ring&#8208;expanding 1,2&#8208;rearragement. This is due to the high steric demand. The title compounds display a blue to blue&#8208;green fluorescence and increased emission intensity as well as hypsochromic shifts in the solid state. More information can be found in the Research Article by K. M&#252;llen and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202203735).

         <title>Chromatic Selectivity of Coumarin&#8208;Caged Oligonucleotides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of green&#8208;light activatable DCCM photo&#8208;tethers allows efficient photocaging of oligonucleotides. In addition, DCCM can be used in combination with conventional blue&#8208;light absorbing DEACM to build an &#8220;orthogonal&#8221; system. It was suggested to rather use the term &#8220;chromatic selectivity&#8221; for which the necessary equations were provided. These showed that chromatic selectivity can even be adjusted by careful choice of starting material.







Abstract
A system of two coumarin&#8208;based caging groups is presented &#8211; one absorbing in the blue (400&#8211;450&#8197;nm) and the other absorbing in the green (480&#8211;550&#8197;nm) part of the visible spectrum. Together they form a pair, which allows to selectively photoactivate the one or the other in oligonucleotides. A numerical characterization defining the term &#8220;chromatic selectivity&#8221; was proposed, and it was shown how chromatically selective uncaging can literally be titrated in a kinetic reaction scheme.

         <title>Tin Active Sites Confined in Zeolite Framework as a Promising Shape&#8208;Selective Catalyst for Ethylene Oxide Hydration</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Topotactic conversion of germanosilicate UTL into stannosilicates Sn&#8208;PCR with various Sn contents have been realized through post&#8208;synthesis strategy. The Sn&#8208;PCR&#8208;20 (Si/Sn molar ratio of 77) catalyst served as a shape&#8208;selective nanoreactor for eco&#8208;efficient production of glycol.







Abstract
Shape&#8208;selective stannosilicates have been post&#8208;synthesized for the hydration of epoxide to diols. A simple acid treatment has been employed to remove extensively the interlayer double four ring units, converting the three&#8208;dimensional (3D) UTL germanosilicate into a 2D layered IPC&#8208;1P intermediate. Isomorphous incorporation of tetrahedrally coordinated Sn active centers was realized via solid&#8208;liquid treatment of IPC&#8208;1P with diammonium hexachlorostannate aqueous solution, which was accompanied by the spontaneous condensation of neighboring silica&#8208;rich cfi layers upon calcination and structural construction of a 3D PCR structure. Sn&#8208;PCR stannosilicates with tunable Sn contents were thus prepared. With Sn&#8208;derived robust Lewis acidity confined in the intersecting 10&#8208; and 8&#8208;ring channels, the Sn&#8208;PCR (Si/Sn molar ratio of 77) catalyst served as a shape&#8208;selective nanoreactor for the hydration of ethylene oxide (EO) into ethylene glycol (EG), exhibiting a remarkable EO conversion (99.5&#8201;%) as well as a steady EG selectivity (&gt;98.4&#8201;%) at greatly reduced H2O/EO molar ratio and near&#8208;ambient reaction temperature.

         <title>Excited&#8208;State Dynamics in Borylated Arylisoquinoline Complexes in Solution and in cellulo</title>

Four&#8208;coordinate organoboron N,C Chelates are used as fluorescence dyes in biological environment. Their excited&#8208;state properties within human MCF&#8208;7&#8197;cells are characterized by time&#8208;resolved pump&#8208;probe spectroscopy and fluorescence lifetime microscopy. Two chromophores show different features in cellulo depending on the nature of the anchored PEG chains. These findings underline that our approach can extend the information from FLIM and evaluate the excited&#8208;state properties of functional fluorophores in a complex biological environment.







Abstract
Two four&#8208;coordinate organoboron N,C&#8208;chelate complexes with different functional terminals on the PEG chains are studied with respect to their photophysical properties within human MCF&#8208;7&#8197;cells. Their excited&#8208;state properties are characterized by time&#8208;resolved pump&#8208;probe spectroscopy and fluorescence lifetime microscopy. The excited&#8208;state relaxation dynamics of the two complexes are similar when studied in DMSO. Aggregation of the complexes with the carboxylate terminal group is observed in water. When studying the light&#8208;driven excited&#8208;state dynamics of both complexes in cellulo, i.&#8201;e., after being taken up into human MCF&#8208;7&#8197;cells, both complexes show different features depending on the nature of the anchoring PEG chains. The lifetime of a characteristic intramolecular charge&#8208;transfer state is significantly shorter when studied in cellulo (360&#177;170&#8197;ps) as compared to in DMSO (&#8764;960&#8197;ps) at 600&#8197;nm for the complexes with an amino group. However, the kinetics of the complexes with the carboxylate group are in line with those recorded in DMSO. On the other hand, the lifetimes of the fluorescent state are almost identical for both complexes in cellulo. These findings underline the importance to evaluate the excited&#8208;state properties of fluorophores in a complex biological environment in order to fully account for intra&#8208; and intermolecular effects governing the light&#8208;induced processes in functional dyes.

Abstract
Herein, we report the design and scalable synthesis of three new Co(III) complexes, which have an unusual hydrocarbon &#951;1&#8208;alkyl&#8208;&#951;3&#8208;allyl&#8208;&#951;5&#8208;cyclopentadienyl ligation structure, from the reactions of readily available cobalt(II) compound CoCl2(PPh3)2 and biomass material &#946;&#8208;pinene via C&#8722;C bond activation. These Co(III) complexes are air&#8208;stable, fairly volatile, and thermally stable, so they are excellent candidates as the metal precursors for the vapor deposition of cobalt&#8208;containing thin films. As a demonstration, we show that the Co(III) complex of [(3&#8217;&#8208;5&#8217;&#8208;&#951;,1&#8208;&#963;)&#8208;methylene(2,2,4&#8208;trimethyl&#8208;4&#8208;cyclohexene&#8208;1,3&#8208;diyl)](&#951;5&#8208;methylcyclopentadienyl)Co (i.&#8201;e. (seco&#8208;pinene)(MeCp)Co) is well suited for the atomic layer deposition (ALD) of Co3O4 and CoS2 thin films, and the deposited Co3O4 and CoS2 films are able to conformally cover trench structures with a fairly high aspect ratio of 10&#8201;:&#8201;1.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Various combinations of charged porphyrins with controlled electronic states were achieved by ion&#8208;pair metathesis based on the HSAB theory. The transient absorption spectra of the porphyrin ion pairs revealed photoinduced electron transfer from the anion to the cation through substituent&#8208;dependent photoexcitation processes. More information can be found in the Research Article by Y. Kobayashi, H. Maeda, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202203957).

         <title>Cumulative Effect of pH and Redox Triggers on Highly Adaptive Transient Coacervates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An intricate synergism between multiple biochemical processes and physical conditions determines the formation and function of various biological self&#8208;assemblies. Thus, a complex set of variables dictate the far&#8208;from&#8208;equilibrium nature of these biological assemblies. Mimicking such systems synthetically is a challenging task. We report multi&#8208;stimuli responsive transient coacervation of an aldehyde&#8208;appended polymer and a short peptide. The coacervates are formed by the disulphide linkages between the peptide molecules and the imine bond between the polymer and the peptide. Imines are susceptible to pH changes and the disulphide bonds can be tuned by oxidation/reduction processes. Thus, the coacervation is operational only under the combined effect of appropriate pH and oxidative conditions. Taking advantage of these facts, the coacervates are transiently formed under a pH cycle (urea &#8211; urease /gluconolactone) and a non&#8208;equilibrium redox cycle (TCEP/H2O2). Importantly, the system showed high adaptability toward environmental changes. The transient existence of the coacervates can be generated without any apparent change in size and shape within the same system through the sequential application of the abovementioned nonequilibrium reaction cycles. Additionally, the coacervation allows for efficient encapsulation/stabilisation of proteins. Thus, the system has the potential to be used for</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two&#8208;photon (2P) activatable probes are of high value in biological and medical chemistry since near infrared (NIR) light can penetrate deeply even in blood&#8208;perfused tissue and due to the intrinsic three&#8208;dimensional activation properties. Designing two&#8208;photon chromophores is challenging. However, the two&#8208;photon absorption qualities of a photocage can be improved with an intramolecular sensitizer, which transfers the absorbed light onto the cage. We herein present the synthesis and photophysical characterization of a 2P&#8208;sensitive uncaging dyad based on rhodamine 101 as donor fluorophore and a redshifted BODIPY as acceptor photocage. Liberation of p&#8208;nitroaniline (PNA) upon one&#8208;photon photolysis was confirmed by HPLC analysis. The photoreaction was found to be accompanied by a considerable change of the fluorescence properties of the chromophores. The possibility of a fluorescent readout enabled the detection of two&#8208;photon induced uncaging by confocal fluorescence microscopy.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Applications of Bicyclo[1.1.0]butyl and Azabicyclo[1.1.0]butyl Organometallics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of metalated (aza)bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes in synthesis is currently experiencing a renaissance, as evidenced by the numerous reports in the last 5 years that have relied on such intermediates to undergo unique transformations or generate novel fragments. Since their discovery, these species have been demonstrated to participate in a wide range of reactions with carbon and heteroatom electrophiles, as well as metal complexes, to facilitate the rapid diversification of (aza)bicyclo[1.1.0]butane&#8208;containing compounds. Key to this is the relative acidity of the bridgehead C&#8210;H bonds which promotes facile deprotonation and subsequent functionalization of an unsubstituted position on the carbon framework via the intermediacy of a metalated (aza)bicyclo[1.1.0]butane. Additionally, the late&#8208;stage incorporation of deuterium atoms in strained fragments has led to the elucidation of numerous reaction mechanisms that involve strained bicycles. The continued investigation into the inimitable reactivity of metalated bicycles will cement their importance within the field of organometallic chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>ACTIVE&#8208;BAPO &#8211; A Versatile Transfer Agent for Photoactive Bis(acyl)phosphane Oxide Units</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A N&#8208;hydroxy succinimide (NHS)&#8208;ester substituted bis(acyl)phosphane oxide (ACTIVE&#8208;BAPO) was prepared via phospha&#8208;Michael addition and used for an easy one&#8208;step BAPO ligation with substrates containing primary amino groups such as amino acids, proteins and poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) dendrimers. Thereby a range of new molecular and polymeric photoinitators was obtained. Real&#8208;time photo&#8208;rheology experiments demonstrated the outstanding efficiency of the PAMAM BAPOs as photoinitiators for free radical polymerization. Remarkably, it is found that PAMAM BAPOs also act as crosslinking agents to convert monofunctional methacrylate monomers into thermosetting networks without any further additives. Depending on the number of the attached BAPOs, thermosets with a different degree of crosslinking and swelling capability in water were obtained.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Herein we present a systematic study of the influence of different alkyl chains in malonyl ester fullerene adducts with [10]cycloparaphenylene ([10]CPP]) and a tert&#8208;butyl (tBu) ester substituted [10]CPP analogue.

         <title>Machine Learning&#8208;Guided Computational&#160;Screening of New Candidate Reactions with&#160;High Bioorthogonal Click Potential</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bioorthogonal click chemistry has become an indispensable part of the biochemist's toolbox. Despite the wide variety of applications that have been developed in recent years, only a limited number of bioorthogonal click reactions have been discovered so far, most of them based on (substituted) azides. In this work, we present a computational workflow to discover new candidate reactions with promising kinetic and thermodynamic properties for bioorthogonal click applications. Sampling only around 0.05% of an overall search space of over 10,000,000 dipolar cycloadditions, we develop a machine learning model able to predict DFT&#8208;computed activation and reaction energies within ~2&#8208;3 kcal/mol across the entire space. Applying this model to screen the full search space through iterative rounds of learning, we identify a broad pool of candidate reactions with rich structural diversity, which can be used as a starting point or source of inspiration for future experimental development of both azide&#8208;based and non&#8208;azide&#8208;based bioorthogonal click reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>CoNi2S4 Electrode with High Mass&#8208;loading for High&#8208;energy&#8208;density Supercapacitor: Role of S&#8208;containing Anions Exchange</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Anion exchange is recognized as an effective method to regulate the composition, electronic conductivity, and electrochemical behavior of the transition metal&#8208;based compounds. In this work, anion exchange is adopted as a rational post&#8208;treatment route to facilitate the capacitive activity of CoNi2S4 nanoparticle arrays grown on carbon cloth (CC) with high mass&#8208;loading. As soaked in saturated Na2S solution, the CoNi2S4/CC electrode showed an increased capacity from 483 C g&#8208;1 to 841 C g&#8208;1 at 10 mA cm&#8208;2 with excellent rate performance and stable cycling performance, which was superior to the CoNi2S4/CC electrode activated by NaBH4 reduction. Anion exchange was beneficial for enhancing the crystallinity, retaining the adhesion of nanoarrays, and realizing low resistance nature in a mild route. The as&#8208;assembled CoNi2S4/CC//activated CC hybrid supercapacitor delivered a high areal capacitance of 1.28 F cm&#8722;2 at 5 mA cm&#8208;2, and achieved an energy density of 0.58 mWh cm&#8722;2 at a power density of 4.5 mW cm&#8722;2 with excellent cycle stability with 90.6% capacity retention after 10,000 cycles.</dc:description>

         <title>Strain&#8208;Sensitive On&#8208;Surface Ladderization by Non&#8208;Dehydrogenative Heterocyclization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
On&#8208;surface non&#8208;dehydrogenative cyclization leads to low&#8208;temperature formation of pyrrolopyrrole&#8208;bridged ladder oligomer with an unprecedented high ratio of nitrogen and carbon of 1&#8201;:&#8201;4. The reaction barrier of the ladderization is sufficiently low as the small segment of the ladder units already appeared at 40&#8201;&#176;C. However, once the long linear oligomer as the intermediate is synthesized, the reaction barrier significantly increases since the orientation of the unit has to be rotated, which is the origin of the strain&#8208;sensitive on&#8208;surface ladderization.







Abstract
On&#8208;surface cyclodehydrogenation recently became an important reaction to planarize &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules and oligomers. However, the high&#8208;activation barrier to cleave the C&#8722;H bond often requires high&#8208;temperature annealing, consequently restricting structures of precursor molecules and/or leading to random fusion at their edges. Here, we present a synthesis of pyrrolopyrrole&#8208;bridged ladder oligomers from 11,11,12,12&#8208;tetrabromo&#8208;1,4,5,8&#8208;tetraaza&#8208;9,10&#8208;anthraquinodimethane molecules on Ag(111) with bond&#8208;resolved scanning tunnelling microscopy. This non&#8208;dehydrogenative cyclization between pyrazine and ethynylene/cumulene groups has a low&#8208;activation barrier for forming intermediary dimeric oligomer containing dipyrazinopyrrolopyrrolopyrazine units, thus giving new insight into the strain&#8208;sensitive in ladder&#8208;oligomer formation.

         <title>Paramagnetic Liquid Crystals With Close &#960;&#8211;&#960; Packing: The Effect of Blatter Radical Planarization on Behavior of Bent&#8208;Core Mesogens</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A diphenol containing 19&#8208;&#960; delocalized electrons was developed as a general intermediate to paramagnetic columnar and lamellar liquid crystals with close &#960;&#8211;&#960; contacts for electronic applications.







Abstract
A new, 19 &#960;&#8208;delocalized electrons planar Blatter radical building block was developed and used to obtain paramagnetic bent&#8208;core liquid crystals. The mesogens were investigated by optical, thermal, powder XRD and DFT methods in the pure form and as binary mixtures. Comparison of their properties with those of the classical Blatter radical analogues revealed that planarization of the central angular element results in a significantly higher stability of the mesophases and increased molecular organization suitable for the formation of ordered banana and columnar mesophases with tighter &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions. These results indicate access to a new, potentially rich class of functional paramagnetic soft materials.

         <title>Pro&#8208;aromaticity Enabled Dealkenylative Functionalizations via Photo&#8208;excitation and Oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A general and practical approach for diverse dealkenylative functionalization of olefin&#8208;containing substrates has been developed through the one&#8208;pot formation and utilization of pro&#8208;aromatic 1,4&#8208;dihydropyridazines using tetrazine as the key cycloaddition reagent. Triggered by either excitation or oxidation, the targeted C&#8722;C bonds in the 1,4&#8208;dihydropyridazine intermediates could be readily cleaved to generate alkyl radicals for subsequent transformations.

         <title>Dual Chemiexcitation by a Unique Dioxetane Scaffold Gated by an OR Logic Set of Triggers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemiexcitation of phenoxy&#8208;1,2&#8208;dioxetane chemiluminescent luminophores is initiated by electron transfer from a&#160;meta&#8208;positioned phenolate ion to the peroxide&#8208;dioxetane bond. Here we report the development of a unique 1,2&#8208;dioxetane chemiluminescent scaffold with chemiexcitation gated by an OR logic dual&#8208;set of triggering events. This scaffold is composed of&#160;meta&#8208;dihydroxyphenyl&#8208;1,2&#8208;dioxetane&#8208;adamantyl molecules, equipped with&#160;acrylic acid and chlorine substituents, that&#160;chemiexcitation&#160;under physiological conditions.&#160;A dual&#8208;mode chemiluminescent probe, armed with two different triggering substrates designed for activation by the enzymes&#160;&#946;&#8208;galactosidase and alkaline phosphatase, was synthesized.&#160;The probe emitted intense&#160;light signals in the response to each enzyme, demonstrating its ability to serve as a single&#8208;component chemiluminescent sensor for dual&#8208;analyte detection. We also demonstrated the ability of the probe to detect&#160;&#946;&#8208;galactosidase and of phosphatase activities in bacteria. This is the first&#160;1,2&#8208;dioxetane scaffold capable of response to two different chemiexcitation events from two different positions on the same dioxetane molecule.We anticipate that the OR&#8208;gated mode of chemiexcitation, described herein, will find utility in preparation of&#160;chemiluminescent&#160;probes with a dual&#8208;analyte detection/imaging mode.</dc:description>

         <title>SnS&#8208;SnO2 heterostructures anchored on GO as a high&#8208;performance anode for Sodium ion battery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>SnO2 is a theoretically excellent transformed anode material with high theoretical capacity for SIBs. However, SnO2 faces serious volume effect and high resistance, which greatly damages its electrochemical performance. Given that, the SnS&#8208;SnO2 heterostructures is constructed with special internal electric field, which is beneficial to promote the transfer ability of sodium ions. Besides, the graphene oxide (GO) modification is carried out to isolate intrinsic materials from direct contact with electrolyte, and alleviate volume expansion of the anode, ultimately promote the electrochemical performance. Furthermore, the structure and the conductivity characteristics of SnS, SnO2, SnS&#8208;SnO2 and SnS&#8208;SnO2@ GO are simulated respectively by first principles, and are compared with the correspondence experiment results to verify the accuracy of established models. Owing to the special p&#8208;n junction in SnS&#8208;SnO2@GO heterostructures, the resistance of SnS&#8208;SnO2@GO can be reduced to 36.23 &#937;, much lower than SnO2 (Rct=341.9 &#937;). Notably, the combination of GO effectively alleviate volume expansion of SnS&#8208;SnO2@GO electrode, and present excellent capacity higher than 384.7 mAh&#183;g&#8208;1 after 100 cycles. Thus, the efficient synthesis of SnS&#8208;SnO2@GO heterostructures and excellent performance for sodium storage is expected to provide valuable direction for SIBs anode materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Surface&#8208;stabilized CsPbI3 nanocrystals with tailored organic polymer ligand binding</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) exhibit attractive photophysical properties by combining the excellent optoelectronic properties of bulk perovskites with the strong quantum confinement effect at the nanoscale. However, CsPbI3 NCs easily transform into a non&#8208;perovskite phase because of the ionic lattice and dynamic ligand binding. Here, we report stable black&#8208;phase CsPbI3 NCs capped with a new organic ligand, HO&#8208;PS&#8208;N3 (HOPS), which consists of a polystyrene segment with hydroxyl and azide end groups. This organic polymer ligand passivated the surface defects and enhanced the stability of CsPbI3 NCs by exposing the linking hydrophobic polystyrene segment. Consequently, the optimized CsPbI3 NCs exhibit significantly improved resistance to moisture or light and maintained 70% of the original luminous intensity after immersion in water for two months. The theoretical results revealed that the binding energy of the HOPS ligand on the surface of the CsPbI3 NCs is higher than that of the commonly used oleic acid, alleviating the defects&#8208;induced degradation during purification. Thus, surface&#8208;stabilized CsPbI3 NCs are beneficial for a broad range of optoelectronic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>LiHMDS&#8208;Mediated Deprotonative Coupling of Toluenes with Ketones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lithium hexamethyldisilazide (LiHMDS) acts as an effective base for deprotonative coupling reactions of toluenes with ketones. Various functionalities are allowed on the toluenes. Notably, this system proved successful with low&#8208;reactive toluenes bearing a large pKa value compared to that of the conjugate acid of LiHMDS (hexamethyldisilazane, 25.8, THF), as demonstrated by 4&#8208;phenyltoluene (38.57, THF) and toluene itself (&#8764;43, DMSO).







Abstract
We demonstrate that lithium hexamethyldisilazide (LiHMDS) acts as an effective base for deprotonative coupling reactions of toluenes with ketones to afford stilbenes. Various functionalities (halogen, OCF3, amide, Me, aryl, alkenyl, alkynyl, SMe, and SPh) are allowed on the toluenes. Notably, this system proved successful with low&#8208;reactive toluenes bearing a large pKa value compared to that of the conjugate acid of LiHMDS (hexamethyldisilazane, 25.8, THF), as demonstrated by 4&#8208;phenyltoluene (38.57, THF) and toluene itself (&#8764;43, DMSO).

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Tandem Coupling Method for the Short&#8208;Step Formal Synthesis of Riccardin C</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A formal total synthesis of riccardin C was achieved by a sequential five&#8208;steps four&#8208;component one&#8208;pot tandem coupling method. By optimizing each step, four individual units were connected by two Sonogashira coupling reactions and one Suzuki coupling reaction, followed by diimide reduction and acid deprotection.







Abstract
One&#8208;pot reactions reduce reagent amounts and circumvent process treatments, such as work&#8208;up and purifications in multi&#8208;step reactions. In this study, we achieved the formal total synthesis of riccardin C through a one&#8208;pot reaction by simultaneously linking four units through two Sonogashira coupling reactions and one Suzuki coupling reaction, followed by reduction and deprotection. Thus, this one&#8208;pot method comprised five steps and did not require the purification of intermediate reaction mixtures, which saves resources, such as reagents and solvents, and expedites the work process.

Ultra&#8208;sensitive detection, capture, and recovery/removal of Pd(II) and Cr(VI) ions by guanidine&#8208;modified fluorescent sp2 carbon&#8208;conjugated covalent organic framework is reported.







Abstract
Palladium is a key element in fuel cells, electronic industries, and organic catalysis. At the same time, chromium is essential in leather, electroplating, and metallurgical industries. However, their unpremeditated leakage into aquatic systems has caused human health and environmental apprehensions. Herein, we reported the development of an sp2 carbon&#8208;conjugated fluorescent covalent organic framework with a guanidine moiety (sp2c&#8208;gCOF) that showed excellent thermal and chemical stability. The sp2c&#8208;gCOF showed effective sensing, capture, and recovery/removal of Pd(II) and Cr(VI) ions, which could be due to the highly accessible pore walls decorated with guanidine moieties. The fluorescent sp2c&#8208;gCOF showed higher selectivity for Pd(II) and Cr(VI) ions, with an ultra&#8208;low detection limit of 2.7 and 3.2&#8197;nM, respectively. The analysis of the adsorption properties with a pseudo&#8208;second&#8208;order kinetic model showed that sp2c&#8208;gCOF could successfully and selectively remove both Pd(II) and Cr(VI) ions from aqueous solutions. The polymer also showed excellent capture efficacy even after seven consecutive adsorption&#8208;desorption cycles. Hence, this study reveals the potential of fluorescent sp2c&#8208;gCOF for detecting, removing, and recovering valuable metals and hazardous ions from wastewater, which would be useful for economic benefit, environmental safety, human health, and sustainability. The post&#8208;synthetic modification of sp2c&#8208;COF with suitable functionalities could also be useful for sensing and extracting other water pollutants and valuable materials from an aqueous system.

         <title>Dioxygen Binding Is Controlled by the Protein Environment in Non&#8208;heme FeII and 2&#8208;Oxoglutarate Oxygenases: A Study on Histone Demethylase PHF8 and an Ethylene&#8208;Forming Enzyme</title>

Local interactions: Study of dioxygen binding and 2OG coordination by using two model 2OG enzymes &#8211; a class&#8197;7 histone demethylase (PHF8) and the ethylene&#8208;forming enzyme (EFE) &#8211; showing the role played by the protein environment in dioxygen transport and how the binding mode of dioxygen in the iron center is affected by SCS interactions.







Abstract
This study investigates dioxygen binding and 2&#8208;oxoglutarate (2OG) coordination by two model non&#8208;heme FeII/2OG enzymes: a class&#8197;7 histone demethylase (PHF8) that catalyzes the hydroxylation of its H3K9me2 histone substrate leading to demethylation reactivity and the ethylene&#8208;forming enzyme (EFE), which catalyzes two competing reactions of ethylene generation and substrate l&#8208;Arg hydroxylation. Although both enzymes initially bind 2OG by using an off&#8208;line 2OG coordination mode, in PHF8, the substrate oxidation requires a transition to an in&#8208;line mode, whereas EFE is catalytically productive for ethylene production from 2OG in the off&#8208;line mode. We used classical molecular dynamics (MD), quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) MD and QM/MM metadynamics (QM/MM&#8208;MetD) simulations to reveal that it is the dioxygen binding process and, ultimately, the protein environment that control the formation of the in&#8208;line FeIII&#8208;OO&#8901;&#8722; intermediate in PHF8 and the off&#8208;line FeIII&#8208;OO&#8901;&#8722; intermediate in EFE.

         <title>Thermoresponse of Odd&#8208;Even Effect in n&#8208;Alkanethiolate Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayers on Gold Substrates
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermoresponse of odd&#8208;even effect in alkanethiolate SAMs is investigated with contact&#8208;angle goniometry and vibrational sum frequency generation spectroscopy. The thermoresponse significantly depends on the supramolecular packing feature of SAMs, and the opposite conformational change is observed for odd and even carbon numbers.







Abstract
This study examines thermoresponse of odd&#8208;even effect in self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) of n&#8208;alkanethiolates (SCn, n=3&#8211;18) formed on template&#8208;stripped gold (AuTS) using macro&#8208; and microscopic analytical techniques, contact angle goniometry (CAG) and vibrational sum frequency generation (VSFG) spectroscopy, respectively. Both CAG and VSFG analyses showed that the odd&#8208;even effect in liquid&#8208;like SAMs (n=3&#8211;9) disappeared upon heating at 50&#8211;70&#8201;&#176;C, indicating that the heating led to increased structural disorder regardless of odd and even carbon numbers. In contrast, the opposite thermoresponse was observed for odd and even SCn molecules in wax&#8208; and solid&#8208;like SAMs (n=10&#8211;18). Namely, temperature&#8208;dependent orientational change of terminal CH3 relative to the surface normal was opposite for the odd and even molecules, thereby leading to mitigated odd&#8208;even effect. Our work offers important insights into thermoresponse of supramolecular structure in condensed organic matter.

         <title>Magneto&#8208;Structural Correlations in a Mixed Porphyrin(Cu2+)/Trityl Spin System: Magnitude, Sign, and Distribution of the Exchange Coupling Constant</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of multi&#8208;frequency continuous&#8208;wave electron paramagnetic resonance and density functional theory calculations were used to determine the magnitude, sign, and distribution of the exchange coupling constant J in a biradical consisting of a trityl radical and a copper(II)tetraphenylporphyrin. The ferromagnetic exchange coupling and its distribution are related to the structure and dynamics of the biradical.







Abstract
Tetrathiatriarylmethyl radicals (TAM or trityl) are receiving increasing attention in various fields of magnetic resonance such as imaging, dynamic nuclear polarization, spin labeling, and, more recently, molecular magnetism and quantum information technology. Here, a trityl radical attached via a phenyl bridge to a copper(II)tetraphenylporphyrin was synthesized, and its magnetic properties studied by multi&#8208;frequency continuous&#8208;wave electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy and magnetic measurements. EPR revealed that the electron spin&#8208;spin coupling constant J between the trityl and Cu2+ spin centers is ferromagnetic with a magnitude of &#8722;2.3&#8197;GHz (&#8722;0.077&#8197;cm&#8722;1, 
 convention) and a distribution width of 1.2&#8197;GHz (0.040&#8197;cm&#8722;1). With the help of density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the obtained ferromagnetic exchange coupling, which is unusual for para&#8208;substituted phenyl&#8208;bridged biradicals, could be related to the almost perpendicular orientation of the phenyl linker with respect to the porphyrin and trityl ring planes in the energy minimum, while the J distribution was rationalized by the temperature weighted rotation of the phenyl bridge about the molecular axis connecting both spin centers. This study exemplifies the importance of molecular dynamics for the homogeneity (or heterogeneity) of the magnetic properties of trityl&#8208;based systems.

         <title>Mechanistic Insights into the Metal&#8208;Free Deoxygenative Borylation of Ketones and Aldehydes with Bis(catecholato)diborane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DFT calculations on the deoxygenative triboration/monoboration of ketones and aldehydes with B2cat2 revealed that the in&#8197;situ formed 1,2&#8208;B2cat2 rather than 1,1&#8208;B2cat2 is the key borylation intermediate. The solvent N,N&#8208;dimethylacetamide plays an important role in the isomerization from 1,1&#8208; B2cat2 to 1,2&#8208;B2cat2 and promotes some intermediate processes.







Abstract
The mechanisms of direct deoxygenative borylation of acetone and benzaldehyde with bis(catecholato)diborane (B2cat2) in the solvent N,N&#8208;dimethylacetamide (DMA) are investigated through detailed density functional theory calculations. These calculations show that the isomer 1,2&#8208;B2cat2 in&#8197;situ generated from 1,1&#8208;B2cat2 induced by DMA is the reactive boron intermediate for the reactions. The addition of the B&#8722;B bond of 1,2&#8208;B2cat2 to the C=O bond of acetone or benzaldehyde via a concerted [2&#963;+2&#960;]&#8208;cycloaddition&#8208;like transition state is the rate&#8208;limiting step for both the triboration reaction of acetone and the monoboration reaction of benzaldehyde. DMA not only acts as the solvent but also promotes the structural isomerization of B2cat2, the deoxygenation of acetone to form the vinyl boronate intermediate and subsequent diboration of vinyl boronate with 1,2&#8208;B2cat2, as well as the protodeboronation of the gem&#8208;diboronate intermediate in the deoxygenative borylation of benzaldehyde. The presented computational results can explain the observed experimental facts and provide insight into the roles of the isomeric 1,2&#8208;B2cat2 and the solvent DMA in related reactions.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;DFT calculations&lt;/b&gt; on the deoxygenative triboration/monoboration of ketones and aldehydes with B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;cat&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; revealed that the in&#8197;situ formed 1,2-B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;cat&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; rather than 1,1-B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;cat&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is the key borylation intermediate. The solvent &lt;i&gt;N,N&lt;/i&gt;-dimethylacetamide plays an important role in the isomerization from 1,1- B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;cat&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to 1,2-B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;cat&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and promotes some intermediate processes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mechanisms of direct deoxygenative borylation of acetone and benzaldehyde with bis(catecholato)diborane (B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;cat&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) in the solvent N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMA) are investigated through detailed density functional theory calculations. These calculations show that the isomer 1,2-B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;cat&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in&#8197;situ generated from 1,1-B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;cat&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; induced by DMA is the reactive boron intermediate for the reactions. The addition of the B&#8722;B bond of 1,2-B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;cat&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to the C=O bond of acetone or benzaldehyde via a concerted [2&#963;+2&#960;]-cycloaddition-like transition state is the rate-limiting step for both the triboration reaction of acetone and the monoboration reaction of benzaldehyde. DMA not only acts as the solvent but also promotes the structural isomerization of B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;cat&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, the deoxygenation of acetone to form the vinyl boronate intermediate and subsequent diboration of vinyl boronate with 1,2-B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;cat&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, as well as the protodeboronation of the gem-diboronate intermediate in the deoxygenative borylation of benzaldehyde. The presented computational results can explain the observed experimental facts and provide insight into the roles of the isomeric 1,2-B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;cat&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and the solvent DMA in related reactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Role of Counterions in the Structural Stabilisation of Redox&#8208;Active Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Revealing the role of counterions: Redox&#8208;active metal&#8208;organic frameworks often rely on counterions to access specific charge states of the components. We show, through a quantum chemical investigation, that the counterion can play an important steric role in the structural stabilisation of such frameworks beyond pure charge balancing effects.







Abstract
The crystal structures of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are typically determined by the strong chemical bonds formed between the organic and inorganic building units. However, the latest generation of redox&#8208;active frameworks often rely on counterions in the pores to access specific charge states of the components. Here, we model the crystal structures of three layered MOFs based on the redox&#8208;active ligand 2,5&#8208;dihydroxybenzoquinone (dhbq): Ti2(Cl2dhbq)3, V2(Cl2dhbq)3 and Fe2(Cl2dhbq)3 with implicit and explicit counterions. Our full&#8208;potential first&#8208;principles calculations indicate that while the reported hexagonal structure is readily obtained for Ti and V, the Fe framework is stabilised only by the presence of explicit counterions. For high counterion concentrations, we observe the formation of an electride&#8208;like pocket in the pore center. An outlook is provided on the implications of solvent and counterion control for engineering the structures and properties of porous solids.

         <title>Enhancing the Magnetization Blocking Energy of Biradical&#8208;Metal System by Merging Discrete Complexes into One&#8208;Dimensional Chains</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The pentanuclear fragments and one&#8208;dimensional chains of 2p&#8211;3d&#8208;4f are achieved using a new nitronyl nitroxide biradical through changing reaction temperature. The different magnetic relaxation features are observed for two Dy derivatives, in which the enhanced magnetic relaxation behavior of 1D compound could be attributed to the long&#8208;range ferromagnetic interaction.







Abstract
The reaction of nitronyl nitroxide biradical NITPhMeImbis [5&#8208;(2&#8208;methylimidazole)&#8208;1,3&#8208;bis(1&#8208;oxyl&#8208;3&#8217;&#8208;oxido&#8208;4&#8217;,4&#8217;,5&#8217;,5&#8217;&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;4,5&#8208;hydro&#8208;1H&#8208;imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;benzene] with Ln(hfac)3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H2O and Cu(hfac)2 (hfac=hexafluoroacetylacetonate), led to two series of 2p&#8211;3d&#8208;4f complexes, namely, nona&#8208;spin clusters, [Ln2Cu3(hfac)12(NITPhMeImbis)2] (Ln=Gd 1, Dy 2), or one&#8208;dimensional chains [LnCu2(hfac)7(NITPhMeImbis)] (Ln=Y 3, Dy 4, Tb 5) depending on the temperature of the reaction. All five complexes contain a biradical&#8208;Ln unit in which the biradical chelates the LnIII ion by the means of one aminoxyl (i.&#8201;e. NO) group of each NIT unit. For the discrete complexes, a Cu(hfac)2 links two biradical&#8208;Ln units via one of the remaining NO groups, while for the chain compounds, the two remaining NO groups of the biradical&#8208;Ln moiety are each coordinated to a Cu(hfac)2 unit to form a 1D coordination polymer. Moreover, a terminal Cu(hfac)2 unit is coordinated to the imidazole&#8208;N atom of the NITPhMeImbis ligand. Spin dynamics investigations evidenced the onset of slow relaxation of the magnetization for 2, whereas 4 and 5 exhibit a typical single&#8208;chain magnet behavior. This highlights the vital role of the 1D spin correlation in the blocking of the magnetization. These results illustrate that from the same basic building blocks, magnetic relaxation can be carefully modulated by structural adjustments.

         <title>Guided Isolation of An Uncommon Cembranoid Orthoester, Sarcotortin A, and Three Skeletal Diverse Terpenoids from the Hainan Soft Coral Sarcophyton tortuosum Based on Molecular Networking Strategy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chemical study on the Hainan soft coral Sarcophyton tortuosum under the guidance of emerging molecular networking strategy led to the isolation and full characterization of an uncommon cembranoid orthoester, sarcotortin A (1), featuring a 3/14/8/5&#8208;fused scaffold, an unusual eunicellane&#8208;type diterpenoid, sarcotorolide A (2), and two new biscembranoids, ximaolides M and N (7 and 8).







Abstract
Applying the emerging molecular networking strategy, an uncommon cembranoid orthoester, sarcotortin A (1), featuring a 3/14/8/5&#8208;fused scaffold, an unusual eunicellane&#8208;type diterpenoid, sarcotorolide A (2), and two new biscembranoids, ximaolides M and N (7 and 8), along with nine known terpenoids 3&#8211;6 and 9&#8211;13 were isolated from the Hainan soft coral Sarcophyton tortuosum. The structure and absolute configuration of all new compounds were established by a combination of spectroscopic data, X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis, and/or quantum chemical computational approaches. The plausible biogenetic relationship among these skeletally different terpenoids was proposed and discussed. In in vitro bioassay, new compound 7 exhibited a remarkable inhibitory activity against protein tyrosine phosphatases 1B (PTP1B) with the IC50 value of 8.06&#8197;&#956;M. In addition, compounds 4 and 10 displayed significant inhibitory effects on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)&#8208;induced inflammatory responses in RAW264.7 macrophages cells with the IC50 values of 19.13 and 16.45&#8197;&#956;M, respectively. Compound 9 showed interesting cytotoxicity against H1975, MDA&#8208;MB231, A549, and H1299 cancer cell lines with IC50 values of 31.59, 34.96, 43.87, and 27.93&#8197;&#956;M, respectively.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solid&#8208;state light&#8208;emitting electrochemical cells (LECs) show promising advantages of simple device architecture, low operation voltage, and insensitivity to the electrode work functions such that they have high potential in low&#8208;cost display and lighting applications. In this work, novel white LECs based on phosphor&#8208;sensitized thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) are proposed. The emissive layer of these white LECs is composed of a blue&#8208;green phosphorescent host doped with a deep&#8208;red TADF guest. Efficient singlet&#8208;to&#8208;triplet intersystem crossing (ISC) on the phosphorescent host and the subsequent F&#246;rster energy transfer from the host triplet excitons to guest singlet excitons can make use of both singlet and triplet excitons on the host. With the good spectral overlap between the host emission and the guest absorption, 0.075 wt.% guest doping is sufficient to cause substantial energy transfer efficiency (ca. 40%). In addition, such a low guest concentration also reduces the self&#8208;quenching effect and a high photoluminescence quantum yield of up to 84% ensures high device efficiency. The phosphor&#8208;sensitized TADF white LECs indeed show a high external quantum efficiency of 9.6%, which is comparable with all&#8208;phosphorescent white LECs. By employing diffusive substrates to extract the light trapped in the substrate, the device efficiency can be further improved by ca. 50%. In the meantime, the intrinsic EL spectrum and device lifetime of the white LECs recover since the microcavity effect is destroyed. This work successfully demonstrates that the phosphor&#8208;sensitized TADF white LECs are potential candidates for efficient white light&#8208;emitting devices.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Efficient methods for the synthesis of two types of furan&#8208;fused tricyclic compounds were developed based on a regiodivergent intramolecular carbometalation strategy using 2&#8208;(2&#8217;&#8208;alkynylaryl)&#8208;3&#8208;iodofurans as a common substrate.

         <title>Double addition vs. ring closure: Systematic reactivity study of CO(NCO)2 and CO(NCS)2 towards hydrogen halides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reactivity of carbonyl diisocyanate, CO(NCO)2, and carbonyl diisothiocyanate, CO(NCS)2 with nucleophiles shows different patterns: Whereas carbonyl diisocyanate adds two equivalents of nucleophile forming carbonyl bis(carbamoylhalides), carbonyl diisothiocyanate only adds one equivalent and undergoes intramolecular ring closure, resulting in the formation of substituted thiadiazines. In this study we have reacted both carbonyl diisocyanate and carbonyl diisothiocyanate with the full series of hydrogen halides HF to HI, isolating carbonyl bis(carbamoylfluoride) (1), &#8208;chloride (2), &#8208;bromide (3), and &#8208;iodide (4) as well as (6&#8208;chloro&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2&#8208;thioxo&#8208;4H&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;thiadiazin&#8208;4&#8208;one (5), and 6&#8208;bromo&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2&#8208;thioxo&#8208;4H&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;thiadiazin&#8208;4&#8208;one (6). The compounds were analysed by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, NMR spectroscopy, IR and Raman spectroscopy, and elemental analysis.

         <title>Fluorescence Detection of the Persistent Organic Pollutant Chlordecone in Water at Environmental Concentrations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chlordecone (CLD), a Persistent Organic Pollutant, is still present in water and food chain of the French West Indies (FWI), leading to dramatical public health problems. One of the major issues is the lack of an easy, non&#8208;expensive, sensitive and robust method for the detection of chlordecone to ensure chlordecone&#8208;free water and foods for the residents of the FWI. Here we report on the development of a fluorescent molecular cage that allows a simple and convenient detection of chlordecone in water at environmental concentration. The specific structural features of chlordecone prompted us to choose hemicryptophanes as receptor. First, we optimized the size, shape of the cavity, as well as the recognition units, to identify the most efficient non fluorescent host for CLD complexation. Then, this selected compound was equipped with fluorophores at different positions in order to find the most efficient system for CLD detection by fluorescence. Among the two most promising fluorescent cages, the newly synthesized hemicryptophane with biphenyl moieties allowed us to develop a fast, easy, reproducible and cheap procedure to detect CLD in water. Its sensitivity and scalability, with modulation of hemicryptophane concentration enabled us to estimate CLD concentrations over five orders of magnitude (10&#8208;2 &#8208; 103 &#181;g/L) including the environmental levels of contamination and the permissible limit for drinking water in the FWI.</dc:description>

A new method for the efficient synthesis of diarylmethanes via a radical process involving thermolysis of bis(arylmethyl)tin dichlorides in the presence of arenes is reported. The intermediate arylmethyl radical can be trapped with TEMPO.







Abstract
The oxidative&#8208;addition reaction between an arylmethyl chloride (RCH2Cl; R=1&#8208;C10H7, 2,4,6&#8208;Me3C6H2, 4&#8208;MeC6H4, 3&#8208;MeC6H4, C6H5, 4&#8208;ClC6H4) and tin powder in boiling toluene produces bis(arylmethyl)tin dichlorides, [(RCH2)2SnCl2] in good yields. At 160&#8201;&#176;C in mesitylene bis(1&#8208;naphthylmethyl)tin dichloride undergoes Sn&#8722;C homolytic cleavage to generate two 1&#8208;naphthylmethyl radicals (1&#8208;C10H7CH2&#8901;) which were trapped by TEMPO (C9H8NO&#8901;). Subsequently, the radicals (RCH2&#8901;) produced in this manner were utilized for efficient substitution reactions with electron&#8208;rich arenes (R&#8242;H; R&#8242;=2,4,6&#8208;Me3C6H2, 1,2,4,5&#8208;Me4C6H, 1,2,3,4,5&#8208;Me5C6) to obtain a variety of unsymmetrical diarylmethanes (RR&#8242;CH2). The addition of one equivalent of iodine (I2) to the reaction mixture resulted in a significant increase in the yields of coupled products.
