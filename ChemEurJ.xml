         <title>DNA&#8208;Encoded Libraries: Hydrazide as a Pluripotent Precursor for On&#8208;DNA Synthesis of Various Azole Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The phylogenic chemical transformation approach to synthesize on&#8208;DNA 1,3,4&#8208;oxadiazole, 1,3,4&#8208;thiadiazol&#8208;2&#8208;amine and 1,2,4&#8208;triazole derivatives using DNA&#8208;conjugated benzoyl hydrazine as pluripotent precursor are reported here, which shows great potential in facilitating rapid construction of azole&#8208;focused DELs.







Abstract
DNA&#8208;encoded combinatorial chemical library (DEL) technology, an approach that combines the power of genetics and chemistry, has emerged as an invaluable tool in drug discovery. Skeletal diversity plays a fundamental importance in DEL applications, and relies heavily on novel DNA&#8208;compatible chemical reactions. We report herein a phylogenic chemical transformation strategy using DNA&#8208;conjugated benzoyl hydrazine as a common versatile precursor in azole chemical expansion of DELs. DNA&#8208;compatible reactions deriving from the common benzoyl hydrazine precursor showed excellent functional group tolerance with exceptional efficiency in the synthesis of various azoles, including oxadiazoles, thiadiazoles, and triazoles, under mild reaction conditions. The phylogenic chemical transformation strategy provides DELs a facile way to expand into various unique chemical spaces with privileged scaffolds and pharmacophores.

         <title>Crystallization Induced Self&#8208;Assembly: A Strategy to Achieve Ultra&#8208;Small Domain Sizes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lamellar morphologies with ultra&#8208;small domain sizes (down to 3&#8197;nm) are achieved by the self&#8208;assembly of giant molecules. The driven force for the phase separation is attributed to the strong tendency and fast kinetics for crystallization of vinyl polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (VPOSS) segment. Upon the gamma ray radiation followed pyrolysis, ultra&#8208;thin two dimensional nano&#8208;silica sheets are obtained due to polymerization of vinyl group in VPOSS.







Abstract
Achieving self&#8208;assembled nanostructures with ultra&#8208;small feature sizes (e.&#8201;g., below 5&#8197;nm) is an important prerequisite for the development of block copolymer lithography. In this work, the preparation and self&#8208;assembly of a series of giant molecules composed of vinyl polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (VPOSS) tethered with monodispersed oligo(L&#8208;lactide) chains are presented. Small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) results demonstrate that ultra&#8208;small domain sizes (down to 3&#8197;nm) of phase separated lamellar morphology are achieved in bulk, driven by the strong tendency and fast kinetics for crystallization of VPOSS moieties. Moreover, upon gamma ray radiation, VPOSS cages in the lamellar structure can be crosslinked via polymerization of the vinyl groups. After pyrolysis at high temperature, ultra&#8208;thin two&#8208;dimensional nano&#8208;silica sheets can be obtained.

         <title>Affinity selections of DNA&#8208;encoded chemical libraries on carbonic anhydrase IX&#8208;expressing tumor cells reveal a dependence on ligand valence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>DNA&#8208;encoded chemical libraries are typically screened against purified protein targets. Recently, cell&#8208;based selections with encoded chemical libraries have been described, commonly revealing suboptimal performance due to insufficient recovery of binding molecules. We used carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX)&#8208;expressing tumor cells as a model system to optimize selection procedures with code&#8208;specific quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) as selection readout. Salt concentration and performing PCR on cell suspension had the biggest impact on selection performance, leading to 15&#8208;fold enrichment factors for high&#8208;affinity monovalent CAIX binders (acetazolamide; K  D  = 8.7 nM). Surprisingly, the homobivalent display of acetazolamide at the extremities of both complementary DNA strands led to a substantial improvement of both ligand recovery and enrichment factors (above 100&#8208;fold). The optimized procedures were used for selections with a DNA&#8208;encoded chemical library comprising 1 million members against tumor cell lines expressing CAIX, leading to a preferential recovery of known and new ligands against this validated tumor&#8208;associated target. This work may facilitate future affinity selections on cells against target proteins which might be difficult to express otherwise.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanochemical Formation, Solution Rearrangements, and Catalytic Behavior of a Polymorphic Ca/K Allyl Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solvent&#8208;free mechanochemical synthesis provides the metastable organocalciate K[CaA&#8217;3] (A&#8217;= 1,3&#8208;(SiMe3)2C3H3), whose &#8216;first contact&#8217; with solvent determines how fast it rearranges to a more stable form: minutes (in hexanes) to days (in arenes). The latter form of the calciate initiates the polymerization of methyl methacrylate and isoprene under mild conditions.







Abstract
Without solvents present, the often far&#8208;from&#8208;equilibrium environment in a mechanochemically driven synthesis can generate high&#8208;energy, non&#8208;stoichiometric products not observed from the same ratio of reagents used in solution. Ball milling 2&#8197;equiv. K[A&#8217;] (A&#8217;=[1,3&#8208;(SiMe3)2C3H3]&#8722;) with CaI2 yields a non&#8208;stoichiometric calciate, K[CaA&#8217;3], which initially forms a structure (1) likely containing a mixture of pi&#8208; and sigma&#8208;bound allyl ligands. Dissolved in arenes, the compound rearranges over the course of several days to a structure (2) with only &#951;3&#8208;bound allyl ligands, and that can be crystallized as a coordination polymer. If dissolved in alkanes, however, the rearrangement of 1 to 2 occurs within minutes. The structures of 1 and 2 have been modeled with DFT calculations, and 2 initiates the anionic polymerization of methyl methacrylate and isoprene; for the latter, under the mildest conditions yet reported for a heavy Group 2 species (one&#8208;atm pressure and room temperature).

         <title>Modulation of Src kinase activity by selective substrate recognition with pseudopeptidic cages</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The selective recognition of tyrosine (Tyr) residues in peptides is an appealing approach to inhibit their phosphorylation mediated by tyrosine kinases (TKs). Here we describe pseudopeptidic cages that efficiently protect the substrates from the action of the Src TK enzyme, precluding the corresponding Tyr phosphorylation. The most efficient cage inhibitors strongly bind the peptide substrates as shown by fluorescence emission titrations, with a very good correlation between the binding constants and the inhibitory potency. Structural insights and additional control experiments further support the proposed mechanism by the selective supramolecular protection of the substrates. Moreover, the approach also works in a completely different kinase&#8208;substrate system. These results illustrate the potential of supramolecular complexes for the efficient and selective modulation of TK signaling.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Gold Chemistry: From Simple Salts to Complexes for Regioselective C&#8208;H Bond Functionalization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Gold coordinated to neutral phosphines (R  3  P),  N  &#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) or anionic ligands is catalytically active in functionalizing various C&#8208;H bonds with high selectivity. The sterics/electronic nature of the studied C&#8208;H bond, oxidation state of gold and stereoelectronic capacity of the coordinated auxiliary ligand are some of the associated selectivity factors in gold&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;H bond functionalization reactions. Hence, in this review a comprehensive update about the action of different types of gold catalysts, from simple to sophisticated ones, on C&#8208;H bond reactions and their regiochemical outcome is disclosed. This review also highlights the catalytic applications of Au(I)&#8208; and Au(III)&#8208;species in creating new opportunities for the regio&#8208; and site&#8208;selective activation of challenging C&#8208;H bonds. Finally, it also intends to stress the potential applications in selective C&#8208;H bond activation associated with a variety of heterocycles recently described in the literature.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective production of linear aldehydes and alcohols from alkenes using formic acid as syngas surrogate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Performing carbonylation without the use of carbon monoxide for high&#8208;value&#8208;added products is an attractive yet challenging topic in sustainable chemistry. Herein, effective methods for producing linear aldehydes or alcohols selectively with formic acid as both carbon monoxide and hydrogen source have been described. Linear&#8208;selective hydroformylation of alkenes proceeds smoothly with up to 88% yield and &gt; 30 regioselectivity in the presence of single Rh catalyst. Strikingly, introducing Ru into the system, the dual Rh/Ru catalysts accomplish efficient and regioselective hydroxymethylation in one pot. The present processes utilizing formic acid as syngas surrogate operate simply under mild condition, which opens a sustainable way for production of linear aldehydes and alcohols without the need for gas cylinders and autoclaves. As formic acid can be readily produced via CO 2 hydrogenation, the protocols represent indirect approaches for chemical valorization of CO 2 .</dc:description>

         <title>In Situ Nitrogen Retention of Carbon Anode for Enhancing the Electrochemical Performance for Sodium&#8208;Ion Battery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple strategy has been successfully adopted to retain N atoms in&#8197;situ and increase production yield of a novel composite PAZ by mixing 3&#8197;wt&#8201;% of zinc borate (ZB) with poly(acrylonitrile&#8208;co&#8208;itaconic acid) (PANIA). After being carbonised at 700&#8201;&#176;C, PAZ&#8208;CF&#8208;700 maintains 90&#8201;% of the original N from PANIA. At the same time, PAZ&#8208;CF&#8208;700 also exhibits a good rate performance and excellent long&#8208;term cycling stability with a specific capacity of 94&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 4000 cycles at 1.6&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1.







Abstract
Retaining nitrogen for polyacrylonitrile (PAN) based carbon anode is a cost&#8208;effective way to make full use of the advantages of PAN for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). Here, a simple strategy has been successfully adopted to retain N atoms in&#8197;situ and increase production yield of a novel composite PAZ by mixing 3&#8197;wt&#8201;% of zinc borate (ZB) with poly (acrylonitrile&#8208;co&#8208;itaconic acid) (PANIA). Among the prepared carbonised fibre (CF) samples, PAZ&#8208;CF&#8208;700 maintains the highest N content, retaining 90&#8201;% of the original N from PANIA. It represents the highest capacity storage contribution (80.55&#8201;%) and the lowest impedance Rct (117&#8197;&#937;). Consequently, the specific capacity increases from 60&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 of PANIA&#8208;CF&#8208;700 to 190&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 of PAZ&#8208;CF&#8208;700 at a current density of 100&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1. At the same time, PAZ&#8208;CF&#8208;700 exhibits a good rate performance and excellent long&#8208;term cycling stability with a specific capacity of 94&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 4000 cycles at 1.6&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1.

         <title>Cyano Derivatives of 7&#8208;Aminoquinoline that are Highly Emissive in Water: Potential for Sensing Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
6&#8208;Cyano&#8208;7&#8208;azidoquinoline was synthesized and found to be non&#8208;emissive in water, while the amino derivative 6CN&#8722;7AQ exhibits intense emission, making the azido/amino pair excellent in sensing H2S. Moreover, conjugation of 6CN&#8722;7AQ with peptide renders a nearly non&#8208;emissive composite that can be digested by proteinase&#8208;K, recovering intense 6CN&#8722;7AQ emission with &#8764;200&#8208;fold enhancement.







Abstract
6&#8208;Cyano&#8208;7&#8208;aminoquinoline (6CN&#8722;7AQ) and 3&#8208;cyano&#8208;7&#8208;aminoquinoline (3CN&#8722;7AQ) were synthesized and found to exhibit intense emission with quantum yield as high as 63&#8201;% and 85&#8201;%, respectively, in water. Conversely, their derivatives 6&#8208;cyano&#8208;7&#8208;azidoquinoline (6CN&#8722;7N3Q) and 3&#8208;cyano&#8208;7&#8208;azidoquinoline (3CN&#8722;7N3Q) show virtually no emission, which makes them suitable to be used as recognition agents in azide reactions based on fluorescence recovery. Moreover, conjugation of 6CN&#8722;7AQ with a hydrophobic biomembrane&#8208;penetration peptide PFVYLI renders a nearly non&#8208;emissive 6CN&#8722;7AQ&#8208;PFVYLI composite, which can be digested by proteinase K, recovering the highly emissive 6CN&#8722;7AQ with &#8764;200&#8208;fold enhancement. The result provides an effective early confirmation for RT&#8208;qPCR in viral detection.

         <title>CO2 Capture by Hydroxylated Azine&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent organic frameworks were investigated towards their CO2 capture properties as a function of their textural and chemical features. Experimental and theoretical data indicated that the relative number of hydroxyl groups in the COF backbone acts as an adsorption threshold. For the best performing COF, a variety of CO2 concentrations and temperatures were investigated, showing excellent isothermal recyclability up to 3 cycles.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) RIO&#8208;13, RIO&#8208;12, RIO&#8208;11, and RIO&#8208;11m were investigated towards their CO2 capture properties by thermogravimetric analysis at 1&#8197;atm and 40&#8201;&#176;C. These microporous COFs bear in common the azine backbone composed of hydroxy&#8208;benzene moieties but differ in the relative number of hydroxyl groups present in each material. Thus, their sorption capacities were studied as a function of their textural and chemical properties. Their maximum CO2 uptake values showed a strong correlation with an increasing specific surface area, but that property alone could not fully explain the CO2 uptake data. Hence, the specific CO2 uptake, combined with DFT calculations, indicated that the relative number of hydroxyl groups in the COF backbone acts as an adsorption threshold, as the hydroxyl groups were indeed identified as relevant adsorption sites in all the studied COFs. Additionally, the best performing COF was thoroughly investigated, experimentally and theoretically, for its CO2 capture properties in a variety of CO2 concentrations and temperatures, and showed excellent isothermal recyclability up to 3 cycles.

         <title>Chalcogen Bonding Ion&#8208;Pair Cryptand Host Discrimination of Potassium Halide Salts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chalcogen bonding (ChB) and halogen bonding (XB) ion&#8208;pair heteroditopic cryptands exhibit cooperative recognition of potassium halide salts. Incorporation of bidentate triazole&#8208;based ChB or XB donor motifs into a dibenzo&#8208;30&#8208;crown&#8208;10&#8208;based macrobicyclic receptor framework is demonstrated to profoundly influence selectivity and affinity behaviour towards the recognition of KBr and KI ion&#8208;pairs relative to hydrogen bonding analogues.







Abstract
A series of chalcogen, halogen and hydrogen bonding heteroditopic macrobicyclic cryptands are reported and their potassium halide ion&#8208;pair recognition properties investigated. Saliently, the co&#8208;bound potassium cation was determined to be crucial in switching on the bromide and iodide recognition properties of the respective cryptand receptor. Importantly, the nature of the sigma&#8208;hole mediated interaction employed in the anion recognition component is demonstrated to significantly augment the ion&#8208;pair binding behaviour, markedly so for the halogen bonding analogue. Most notably the incorporation of a chelating chalcogen bonding donor motif significantly improves the selectivity towards KBr over KI, relative to halogen and hydrogen bonding analogues.

         <title>The Versatile Electronic, Magnetic and Photo&#8208;electro Catalytic Activity of a New 2D MA2Z4 Family</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The recent successful growth of MoSi2N4 and WSi2N4 monolayer led to the discovery of a new class of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) MA2Z4 materials with no known 3D layered allotropes, which renders great possibilities to integrate diverse properties by proper design of sandwiched &#8220;MZ2&#8221; building blocks and &#8220;A&#8208;Z&#8221; passivation layers. In this work, we theoretically probe the dynamic stability, electronic properties, and surface reactivity of the new MA2Z4 family, in which M is Ti, Zr, Hf, V, Nb, Ta, Cr, Mo, W, A refers to Si or Ge, and Z is N, P or As. Among the proposed 54 possible combinations, about 42 compositions are dynamically stable, which vary from non&#8208;magnetic, anti&#8208;ferromagnetic, to ferromagnetic semiconductors, metals and half&#8208;metal. In particular, the VB (V, Nb, Ta) MA2Z4 possesses robust intrinsic ferromagnetism that is essential for spintronics applications. In regards to surface activity, most of MA2Z4, particularly for N or P terminated IVB and VB MA2Z4, have high catalytic potential for hydrogen evolution, and the &#8710;GH of non&#8208;magnetic MA2Z4 is highly correlated to the highest occupied p electronic states of surface Z atom. Moreover, the photocatalytic activity is also evaluated, MoSi2N4 and WSi2N4 within 4% tensile strain are capable of photocatalytic overall water splitting. Our findings indicate the new 2D MA2Z4 family has fascinating properties and possesses strong potential for applications but not limited to electronics, spintronics and catalysts, which will stimulate the interests of experimental synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>First total synthesis of phytoprostanes with prostaglandin&#8208;like&#160;configuration, evidence for their formation in edible vegetable oils and orienting study of their biological activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phytoprostanes (PhytoP) are natural products, which form in plants under oxidative stress conditions from &#945;&#8208;linolenic acid. However, their epimers with relative prostaglandin configuration termed phytoglandins (PhytoG) have never been detected in Nature, likely because of the lack of synthetic reference material. Here, the first asymmetric total synthesis of such compounds, namely of PhytoGF  1  a  &#160;(9&#8208;  epi  &#8208;16&#8208;F  1t  &#8208;PhytoP) and its diastereomer&#160;  ent  &#8208;16&#8208;  epi  &#8208; PhytoGF  1  a  &#160;(  ent  &#8208;9,16&#8208;  diepi  &#8208;16&#8208;F  1t  &#8208;PhytoP), has been accomplished. The synthetic strategy is based on radical anion oxidative cyclization, copper(I)&#8208;mediated alkyl&#8208;alkyl coupling and enantioselective reduction reactions. A UHPLC&#8208;MS/MS study using the synthesized compounds as standards indicates PhytoG formation at significant levels during autoxidation of &#945;&#8208;linolenic acid in edible vegetable oils. Initial testing of synthetic PhytoGs together with F  1  &#8208;PhytoP and 15&#8208;F  2t  &#8208;IsoP derivatives for potential interactions with the PGF  2&#945;  &#160;(FP) receptor did not reveal significant activity. The notion that PUFA&#8208;derived oxidatively formed cyclic metabolites with prostaglandin configuration do not form to a significant extent in biological or food matrices has to be corrected. Strong evidence is provided that oxidatively formed PhytoG metabolites may be ingested with plant&#8208;derived food, which necessitates further investigation of their biological profile.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Heptacene and Its Hole&#8208;Transfer Property of Stable Thin Films</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heptacene (  1  ) was produced through a monoketone precursor (  2  ), which was prepared starting from 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrabromobenzene through 9 steps in a total yield of 10%. Compound  2  was converted to  1  quantitatively by heating at 202 &#176;C. Heptacene exhibited high thermal stability in the solid state without observable change over two months. To investigate the potential value of  1  as a material for  p  &#8208;type organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs), the top&#8208;contact OFET devices were fabricated by vacuum&#8208;deposition of  1  on a hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS)/SiO  2  /Si substrate. The best performance of hole mobility was 2.2 cm  2  V  &#8211;1  s  &#8211;1  . This is the first report that stable heptacene was used in an effective device and examined on its charge carrier property.</dc:description>

         <title>Tailoring Valence Tautomerism using Redox Potentials: Studies on Ferrocene&#8208;Based Triarylmethylium Dyes With Electron&#8208;Poor Fluorenylium and Thioxanthylium Acceptors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Three new electrochromic ferrocenyl triarylmethylium dyes with fluorenylium (  1a  +  ,  1b  +  ) or thioxanthylium (  1c  +  ) residues were selected in order to keep the intrinsic differences of redox potentials for ferrocene oxidation and triarylmethylium reduction small and to trigger valence tautomerism. UV/Vis/NIR and quantitative EPR spectroscopy identified paramagnetic diradical isomers  1a  +&#8226;&#8226;  &#8208;1c  +&#8226;&#8226;  alongside diamagnetic forms  1a  +  &#8208;1c  +  , which renders these complexes magnetochemical switches. The diradical forms  1a  +&#8226;&#8226;  &#8208;1c  +&#8226;&#8226;  as well as the one&#8208;electron reduced triarylmethyl forms of the complexes were found to dimerize in fluid solution. For radical  1a  &#8226;  , dimerization occurs on the timescale of cyclic voltammetry, which allowed us to determine the kinetics and equilibrium constant for this process by digital simulation. M&#246;&#223;bauer spectroscopy indicated that  1a  +  and  1b  +  retain VT even in the solid state. UV/Vis/NIR spectroelectrochemistry revealed the polyelectrochromic behaviour of these complexes by establishing distinctly different electronic absorption profiles of the corresponding oxidized and reduced form  s.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>N&#8208;enriched porous carbon/SiO  2  (SiO  2  /NC) composite from rice husks was prepared by ball mill and tested as stable anode for lithium ion batteries (LIBs), in which the homogeneous dispersion of SiO  2  nanoparticles and carbon matrix, and high level of N&#8208;doping can be realized simultaneously. The N&#8208;doping influence on a series of SiO  2  /NC has been systematically studied, which proves that the porosity, N&#8208;doping content and electronic conductivity of SiO  2  /NC can be controlled by adjusting common nitrogen sources (urea and melamine) and doping routes including dry and wet mill to reach a desirable balance of high capacity, long&#8208;term cyclability and rate property. The optimized SiO  2  /NC composite delivers stably reversible capacity of 581 mA h g  &#8208;1  at high current load of 1.0 A g  &#8208;1  at 1000  th  . The novel Li&#8208;storage mechanism of active silica in composite has been firstly proposed upon N&#8208;doping effect that redox reaction between SiO  2  and Li  +  is accelerated to transform into alloying reaction of Si generated and Li  +  , enhancing reversible capacity. Besides, kinetics analysis confirms that there is combined Li&#8208;storage mechanism of battery&#8208;capacitive pattern in composite, which contributes to fast charge transfer and ion diffusion during cycle.</dc:description>

         <title>STED imaging the dynamic of lysosomes by dually fluorogenic Si&#8208;rhodamine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Super&#8208;resolution microscopy (SRM) imaging of the finite subcellular structures and subtle bioactivities inside organelles delivers abundant cellular information with high fidelity to unravel the intricate biological processes. An ideal fluorescent probe with precise control of fluorescence is critical in SRM technique like stimulated emission depletion (STED). Si&#8208;rhodamine was decorated with both targeting group and H  +  &#8208;receptor, affording the dually fluorogenic Si&#8208;rhodamine in which the NIR fluorescence was efficiently controlled by the coalescent of spirolactone&#8208;zwitterion equilibrium and PeT mechanism. The dually fluorogenic characters of the probe offer a perfect mutual enhancement in sensitivity, specificity and spatial resolution. Strong fluorescence only released in the existence of targeting protein at acidic lysosomal pH, ensured precisely tracking the dynamic of lysosomal structure and pH in living cells by STED.</dc:description>

         <title>A Smart Access to the Dinitramide Anion &#8211; The Use of Dinitraminic Acid for the Preparation of Energetic Coordination Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dinitraminic acid (HN(NO  2  )  2  , HDN) was prepared by ion exchange chromatography and acid&#8208;base reaction with basic copper(II) carbonate allowed the  in situ  preparation of copper(II) dinitramide, which was reacted with twelve nitrogen&#8208;rich ligands e.g. 4&#8208;amino&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazole, 1&#8208;methyl&#8208;5  H  &#8208;tetrazole, di(5  H  &#8208;tetrazolyl)&#8208;methane/&#8208;ethane/&#8208;propane/&#8208;butane. Nine of the complexes were investigated by low temperature X&#8208;ray diffraction. In addition, all compounds were investigated by infrared spectroscopy (IR), differential thermal analysis (DTA), elemental analysis (EA) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) for selected compounds. Furthermore, investigations of the materials were carried out regarding their sensitivity toward impact (IS), friction (FS), ball drop impact (BDIS) and electrostatic discharge (ESD). In addition, hot plate and hot needle tests were performed. Complex [Cu(AMT)  4  (H  2  O)](DN)  2  , based on 1&#8208;amino&#8208;5&#8208;methyltetrazole (AMT), is most outstanding for its detonative behavior and thus also capable of detonating PETN in classical initiation experiments. Laser ignition experiments at a wavelength of 915&#160;nm were performed for all substances and solid&#8208;state UV&#8208;Vis spectra were recorded for apprehending the ignition mechanism.</dc:description>

Furthermore, investigations of the materials were carried out regarding their sensitivity toward impact (IS), friction (FS), ball drop impact (BDIS) and electrostatic discharge (ESD). In addition, hot plate and hot needle tests were performed. Complex [Cu(AMT)  4  (H  2  O)](DN)  2  , based on 1&#8208;amino&#8208;5&#8208;methyltetrazole (AMT), is most outstanding for its detonative behavior and thus also capable of detonating PETN in classical initiation experiments. Laser ignition experiments at a wavelength of 915&#160;nm were performed for all substances and solid&#8208;state UV&#8208;Vis spectra were recorded for apprehending the ignition mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mixed Cu2Se Hexagonal Nanosheets@Co3Se4 Nanospheres for High&#8208;Performance Asymmetric Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rational designing and constructing multiphase hybrid electrode materials is an effective method to compensate for the performance defects of the single component. Based on this strategy, Cu  2  Se hexagonal nanosheets@Co  3  Se  4  nanospheres mixed structures have been fabricated by a facile two&#8208;step hydrothermal method. Under the synergistic effect of the high ionic conductivity of Cu  2  Se and the remarkable cycling stability of Co  3  Se  4  , Cu  2  Se@Co  3  Se  4  can exhibit outstanding electrochemical performance as a novel electrode material. The as&#8208;prepared Cu  2  Se@Co  3  Se  4  electrode displays high specific capacitance of 1005 F g  &#8208;1  at 1 A g  &#8208;1  with enhanced rate capability (56% capacitance retention at 10 A g  &#8208;1  ), and ultralong lifespan (94.2% after 10000 cycles at 20 A g  &#8208;1  ). An asymmetric supercapacitor is assembled applying the Cu  2  Se@Co  3  Se  4  as anode and graphene as cathode, which delivers a wide work potential window of 1.6 V, high energy density (30.9 Wh kg  &#8208;1  at 0.74 kW kg  &#8208;1  ), high power density (21.0 Wh kg  &#8208;1  at 7.50 kW kg  &#8208;1  ), and excellent cycling stability (85.8% after 10000 cycles at 10 A g  &#8208;1  ).</dc:description>

         <title>Thermally activated delayed fluorescence and phosphorescence quenching in iminophosphonamide copper and zinc complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of copper and zinc complexes of four variably substituted iminophosphonamide ligands is presented. While the copper complexes form ligand bridged dimers, the zinc compounds are monomeric. Due to different steric demand of the ligand the arrangement of the ligands within the dimeric complexes varies. Similar to the structurally related iminophosphonamide complexes of alkali metals and calcium, the steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved photoluminescence (PL) of four of the seven compounds studied here as solids in a temperature range of 5&#160;&#8211;&#160;295 K can be described within the scheme of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF). Accordingly, they exhibit bright blue&#8208;green phosphorescence at low temperatures (&lt;100 K), which turns into delayed fluorescence by increasing the temperature. However, unusually, the fluorescence is practically absent in two copper complexes which otherwise still conform to the TADF scheme. In these cases, the excited singlet states decay essentially non&#8208;radiatively and their thermal population from the corresponding low&#8208;lying triplet states efficiently quenches PL (phosphorescence). Three other copper and zinc complexes only exhibit prompt fluorescence, evidencing a wide variation of photophysical properties in this class of compounds. The excited states of the copper complex with especially pronounced phosphorescence quenching were also investigated by low&#8208;temperature time&#8208;resolved infrared spectroscopy and quantum chemical calculations.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A soluble and green&#8208;blue fluorescent &#960;&#8208;extended azatrioxa[8]circulene was synthesized by oxidative condensation of a 3,6&#8208;dihydroxycarbazole and 1,4&#8208;anthraquinone utilizing benzofuran scaffolding. This is the first circulene to incorporate anthracene within it carbon framework. Solvent&#8208;dependent fluorescence and bright green electroluminescence accompanied by excimer emission are key optical properties of this material. The presence of sliding &#960;&#8208;stacked columns in the single crystal of dianthracenylazatrioxa[8]circulene is found to cause a very high rate for the electron hopping making this material a promising n&#8208;type organic semiconductor with an electron mobility predicted around 2.26 cm  2  V  &#8722;1  s  &#8722;1  . The best OLED device based on the dianthracenylazatrioxa[8]circulene fluorescent emitter has a brightness around 16 000 Cd m  &#8208;2  and external quantum efficiency of 3.3%. By using dianthracenylazatrioxa[8]circulene as a host matrix material the quantum dots based OLEDs were fabricated.</dc:description>

         <title>Quantification and Prediction of Imine Formation Kinetics in Aqueous Solution by Microfluidic NMR</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Quantitatively predicting the reactivity of dynamic covalent reaction is essential to understand and rationally design complex structures and reaction networks. In this work, we quantified the reactivity of aldehydes and amines in various rapid imine formation in aqueous solution by microfluidic NMR. Investigation of reaction kinetics allows us to quantify the forward rate constants  k  +  by an empirical equation, of which three independent parameters were introduced as reactivity parameters of aldehydes (  S  E  ,  E  ) and amines (  N  ). Furthermore, these reactivity parameters were successfully used to predict the unknown forward rate constants of imine formation. Finally, two competitive reaction networks were rationally designed based on the proposed reactivity parameters. Our work has demonstrated the capability of microfluidic NMR in quantifying the kinetics of label&#8208;free chemical reactions, especially rapid reactions that complete in minutes.</dc:description>

         <title>A Nazarov&#8208;Ene Tandem Reaction for the Stereoselective Construction of Spiro Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The different reactivity of trienones under Lewis and Br   &#248;   nsted acids catalysis was investigated, resulting in distinct cyclization products and carbon backbones that originated either from a conjugate Prins cyclization or an interrupted Nazarov cyclization. In particular, an unprecedented Nazarov cyclization tandem reaction is presented, terminating the oxyallyl cation by an ene&#8208;type reaction, and leading stereoselectively to bicyclic spiro compounds. The terminal olefin of this motif represents a useful handle for further functionalization, making it a strategic intermediate in total syntheses.  The tandem Nazarov/ene cyclization  was shown to be preferred over a Nazarov/  [  3+2]  tandem reaction for all our substrates, independent of chain length. Deuteration studies further support the mechanistic hypothesis of the terminating ene reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly and Aggregation Induced Emission in Aqueous Media of Responsive Luminescent Copper(I) Coordination Polymer Nanoparticles.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Luminescent copper(I)&#8208;based compounds have recently attracted much attention since they can reach very high emission quantum yields. Interestingly, Cu(I) clusters can also be emissive, and the extension from small molecules to larger architecture could represent the first step to novel materials that could be reached by programming the units to undergo self&#8208;assembly. However, for Cu(I) compounds the formation of supramolecular systems is challenging due to the coordinative diversity of copper centers. Herein we show that this diversity can be exploited in the construction of responsive systems. In detail, we followed the changes in the emissive profile of different aggregates formed in water by phosphine&#8208;thioether copper(I) derivatives. Our results demonstrate that the self&#8208;assembly and disassembly of Cu(I)&#8208;based coordination polymeric nanoparticles (CPNs) is sensitive to solvent composition. The solvent&#8208;induced changes are related to modifications in the coordination sphere of copper at the molecular level, which alters not only the emission profile but also the morphology of the aggregates. We expect our findings to inspire construction of smart supramolecular systems based on dynamic coordinative metal centers.</dc:description>

         <title>Morphology Engineering of Fullerene[C70] Microcrystals: from Perfect Cube, Defective Hopper to Novel Cruciform&#8208;pillar</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Controlled crystallization of fullerene molecules into ordered molecular assemblies is important for their applications. However, the morphology engineering of fullerene[C  70  ] assemblies is challenging and complicated architectures have rarely been reported due to the low molecular symmetry of C  70  molecules which makes their crystallization difficult to control and the low production yield as well. Herein, with the assistance of solvent intercalation, we report a general reprecipitation approach to prepare morphologically controllable C  70  microcrystals with mesitylene as a good solvent and n&#8208;propanol as a poor solvent in one solvent system without replacing specific solvents. A series of C  70  microcrystals with high uniformity from perfect cubes and defective hoppers to novel cruciform&#8208;pillars are obtained by intentionally tuning C  70  concentration and the volume ratio of mesitylene to n&#8208;propanol. Among them, novel cruciform&#8208;pillar&#8208;shaped microcrystals are obtained for the first time by further decreasing the amount of mesitylene in the solvent&#8208;intercalated microcrystals. Noteworthily, the C  70  concentration is a key parameter for the selective growth of C  70  hopper, rather than the volume ratio of mesitylene to n&#8208;propanol. Interestingly, the hopper&#8208;shaped microcrystals exhibit excellent photoluminescence properties relative to those of cubes and cruciform&#8208;pillars owing to the enhanced light absorption, proving their potential applications in optoelectronic devices.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;Step Template/Solvent&#8208;Free Pyrolysis for   in&#8208;situ  &#160;Immobilization of CoP Nanoparticles onto N and P  co&#8208;Doped Carbon Porous Nanosheets towards&#160;High&#8208;efficiency Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The search for economical, active and stable electrocatalysts towards the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is highly imperative for the progression of water electrolysis technology and related sustainable energy conversion technologies. The delicate&#160;optimization of chemical composition and architectural configuration is paramount to design high&#8208;efficiency non&#8208;precious HER electrocatalysts. Herein, we report a one&#8208;step scalable template/solvent&#8208;free pyrolysis approach for in&#8208;situ&#160;immobilizing uniform CoP nanoparticles onto N and P co&#8208;doped carbon porous nanosheets (denoted as CoP@N,P&#8208;CNSs hereafter). The simultaneous consideration of architectural design and nanocarbon hybridization renders the formed CoP@N,P&#8208;CNSs with plentiful well&#8208;dispersed anchored active sites, shortened pathway for mass diffusion, enhanced electric conductivity, and reinforced mechanical stability. As a consequence, the optimized CoP@N,P&#8208;CNSs exhibit an overpotential of 115 mV to afford a current density of 10 mA cm&#8208;2, small Tafel slope of 74.2 mV dec&#8208;1, high Faradaic efficiency of nearly 100%, and superb long&#8208;term durability in an alkaline medium. Given the fabrication feasibility, mass production potential and outstanding HER performance, the CoP@N,P&#8208;CNSs may hold great promise for large&#8208;scale electrochemical water splitting. More importantly, the explored one&#8208;step template/solvent&#8208;free pyrolysis methodology offers a feasible and versatile route to fabricate carbon nanosheet&#8208;based nanocomposites for diverse energy conversation&#8208;related applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrophobic metal&#8208;organic frameworks and derived composites for microelectronics applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The extraordinary characteristic features of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) make them applicable for use in a variety of fields but their conductivity in microelectronics over a wide relative humidity (RH) range has not been extensively explored. To achieve good performance, MOFs must be stable in water, i.e., under humid conditions. However, the design of ultrastable hydrophobic MOFs with high conductivity for use in microelectronics as conducting and dielectric materials remains a challenge. In this Review, we discuss applications of an emerging class of hydrophobic MOFs with respect to their use as active sensor coatings, tunable low&#8208;&#954; dielectrics and conductivity, which provide high&#8208;level roadmap for stimulating the next steps toward the development and implementation of hydrophobic MOFs for use in microelectronic devices. Several methodologies including the incorporation of long alkyl chain and fluorinated linkers, doping of redox&#8208;active TCNQ, the use of guest molecules, and conducting polymers or carbon materials in the pores or surface of MOFs have been utilized to produce hydrophobic MOFs. The contact angle of a water droplet and a coating can be used to evaluate the degree of hydrophobicity of the surface of a MOF. These unique advantages enable hydrophobic MOFs to be used as a highly versatile platform for exploring multifunctional porous materials. Classic representative examples of each category are discussed in terms of coordination structures, types of hydrophobic design, and potential microelectronic applications. Lastly, a summary and outlook as concluding remarks in this field are presented. We envision that future research in the area of hydrophobic MOFs promise to provide important breakthroughs in microelectronics applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Broad Scope and High&#8208;yield Access to Unsymmetrical Acyclic [11C]ureas for Biomedical Imaging from [11C]carbonyl Difluoride</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Effective methods are needed for labelling acyclic ureas with carbon&#8208;11 (  t  1/2  = 20.4 min) as potential radiotracers for biomedical imaging with positron emission tomography (PET). Herein, we describe the rapid and high&#8208;yield syntheses of unsymetrical acyclic [  11  C]ureas under mild conditions (room temperature and within 7 minutes) using no&#8208;carrier&#8208;added [  11  C]carbonyl difluoride with aliphatic and aryl amines. This methodology is compatible with diverse functionality (e.g., hydroxy, carboxyl, amino, amido, or pyridyl) in the substrate amines. The labelling process proceeds through putative [  11  C]carbamoyl fluorides and for primary amines through identifiable [  11  C]isocyanate intermediates. Unsymmetrical [  11  C]ureas are produced with negligible amounts of unwanted symmetrical [  11  C]urea byproducts. Moreover, the overall labelling method tolerates trace water and the generally moderate to excellent yields show good reproducibility. [  11  C]Carbonyl difluoride shows exceptional promise for application to the synthesis of acyclic [  11  C]ureas as new radiotracers for biomedical imaging with PET.</dc:description>

         <title>Plant&#8208;derived stilbenoids as DNA&#8208;binding agents: from monomers to dimers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stilbenoids are natural compounds endowed with several biological activities, including cardioprotection and cancer prevention. Among them, (&#177;)&#8208;  trans  &#8208;&#948;&#8208;viniferin, deriving from  trans  &#8208;resveratrol dimerization, was here investigated in its ability to target DNA duplex and G&#8208;quadruplex structures by exploiting NMR, circular dichroism, fluorescence spectroscopy and molecular docking. (&#177;)&#8208;  trans  &#8208;&#948;&#8208;Viniferin proved to bind both the minor and major grooves of duplexes, whereas it bound the 3&#8217;&#8208; and 5&#8217;&#8208;ends of a G&#8208;quadruplex by stacking on the outer quartets, accompanied by rearrangement of flanking residues. Noteworthy, (&#177;)&#8208;  trans  &#8208;&#948;&#8208;viniferin demonstrated higher affinity for the investigated DNA targets than its monomeric counterpart. Additionally, the methoxylated derivatives of (&#177;)&#8208;  trans  &#8208;&#948;&#8208;viniferin and  trans  &#8208;resveratrol, i.e. (&#177;)&#8208;pterostilbene&#8208;  trans  &#8208;dihydrodimer and  trans  &#8208;pterostilbene respectively, were evaluated, revealing similar binding modes, affinities and stoichiometries with the DNA targets as their parent analogues. All the tested compounds were cytotoxic at &#181;M concentration on several cancer cell lines, showing DNA damaging activity consistent with their ability to tightly interact with duplex and G&#8208;quadruplex structures.</dc:description>

         <title>Amorphous calcium phosphates: Solvent&#8208;controlled growth and stabilization through the Epoxide Route</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Calcium phosphates stand among the most promising nanobiomaterials where their intrinsic properties as crystalline structure, composition, particle shape and size define their successful use in key biomedical applications as bone repairment, signalling or drug/gene delivery. Among these compounds, metastable amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP) is currently gaining particular attention due to its inherently high reactivity in solution, which is   crucial in bone development mechanisms. However, the obtainment of this highly desired (bio)material with control over its shape, size and phase purity remains as a synthetic challenge. Herein, we have adapted the Epoxide Route for the synthesis of   pure and stable ACP colloids   . By using biocompatible solvents such as ethylene glycol and/or glycerine we are able to avoid t   he natural tendency of ACP to maturate into more stable and crystalline apatites. Moreover, this procedure offers size control, ranging from small nanoparticles (60 nm) to micrometric spheroids (500 nm), and the eventual fractalization of the microstructure, by simply adjusting the   composition of the solvent mixture, means   ethylene glycol:glycerine   ratio.   These findings introduce the use of green   solvents as a new tool to control crystallinity and/or particle size in the synthesis of nanomaterials, avoiding the use of capping agents and preserving the natural chemical reactivity of the pristine surface.</dc:description>

         <title>Reevaluating the Solution Photophysics of Tetraphenylethylene at the Origin of their Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through actinometric NMR evaluation of the photoisomerization kinetics of tetraphenylethylene simple derivatives, it is shown that process is the almost exclusive nonradiative pathway accounting for their luminescence quenching in solution, while photocyclization plays at best a minor role.







Abstract
Although tetraphenylethylene (TPE) and its derivatives have been the most commonly used building blocks in the construction of molecules with aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) properties, no absolute consensus exists regarding the mechanisms at the origin of the phenomenon. Restriction of intramolecular rotations (RIR) of peripheral phenyls has historically been a dominant paradigm, which has served as a valuable guideline in the molecular engineering of AIEgens. Yet, an increasing number of recent works have established that photoisomerization or photocyclization may actively participate in the nonradiative dissipation of the excitation energy. In this paper, the first experimental evaluation of the quantum efficiencies of these different processes is reported, and photoisomerization is shown to be by far the dominant photophysical pathway in solution, accounting for virtually all nonradiative decay of the molecule&#8216;s excited state in degassed solution.

         <title>Ultraviolet&#8208;Cured Semi&#8208;Interpenetrating Network Polymer Electrolytes for High&#8208;Performance Quasi&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Semi&#8208;interpenetrating network polymer (SNP) electrolyte composed of an UV&#8208;crosslinked polymer network (ETPTA), linear polymer chains (PVDF&#8208;HFP) and lithium salt solution are designed to satisfy the demands of high ionic conductivity, good mechanical flexibility and electrochemical stability. LiFePO4/Li battery based on the SNP electrolyte delivers a high specific capacity, good rate capability and cycling stability at room temperature.







Abstract
Solid polymer electrolytes with relatively low ionic conductivity at room temperature and poor mechanical strength greatly restrict their practical applications. Herein, we design semi&#8208;interpenetrating network polymer (SNP) electrolyte composed of an ultraviolet&#8208;crosslinked polymer network (ethoxylated trimethylolpropane triacrylate), linear polymer chains (polyvinylidene fluoride&#8208;co&#8208;hexafluoropropylene) and lithium salt solution to satisfy the demand of high ionic conductivity, good mechanical flexibility, and electrochemical stability for lithium metal batteries. The semi&#8208;interpenetrating network has a pivotal effect in improving chain relaxation, facilitating the local segmental motion of polymer chains and reducing the polymer crystallinity. Thanks to these advantages, the SNP electrolyte shows a high ionic conductivity (1.12&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 30&#8201;&#176;C), wide electrochemical stability window (4.6&#8197;V vs. Li+/Li), good bendability and shape versatility. The promoted ion transport combined with suppressed impedance growth during cycling contribute to good cell performance. The assembled quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (LiFePO4/SNP/Li) exhibit good cycling stability and rate capability at room temperature.

         <title>Synthesis of Spirocycles via Ni&#8208;Catalyzed Intramolecular Coupling of Thioesters and Olefins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nickel&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular coupling of thioesters and olefins is reported, which provides unique and atom&#8208;economic access to spirocyclic scaffolds. This transformation is characterized by the simultaneous transfer of both acyl and thiol moieties to the alkene, with the suppression of decarbonylation and &#946;&#8208;hydrogen elimination.







Abstract
A nickel&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular coupling of thioesters and olefins has been developed for the efficient synthesis of spirocycles, a privileged scaffold commonly found in natural products. This transformation is characterized by the simultaneous transfer of both acyl and thiol moieties to the alkene, with the suppression of decarbonylation and &#946;&#8208;hydrogen elimination. Initial mechanistic investigations are consistent with an oxidative addition/olefin insertion/reductive elimination mechanism. The incorporated methylene sulfide substituent can undergo a variety of further reactions to increase molecular diversity and complexity. These results demonstrate that thioester derivatives can be used as powerful building blocks for the assembly of complex scaffolds.

         <title>Cyclopentadienone Derivative Dimers as Tunable Photoswitches</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of novel photoswitches based on a cyclopentadienone derivative dimer was synthesized. Their photoswitching properties were investigated.







Abstract
A series of photoswitchable cyclopentadienone derivative dimers bearing bromo, thienyl, 4&#8208;(dimethylamino)phenyl, 3&#8208;pyridinyl, 4&#8208;nitrophenyl and cyano groups was designed and facilely synthesized. Photoswitching properties such as the photoconversions in the photostationary state (PSS), the thermal kinetics and thermal half&#8208;lives of photoisomers were systematically investigated. These photoswitches show high fatigue resistance and large photoconversions in the PSS. This work proves that the photoswitching properties of photoswitches based on cyclopentadienone dimers can be tuned by substitution groups and also pave the way to functionalize the cyclopentadienone derivative dimer&#8208;based photoswitch, which is important for its future applications.

         <title>New Noncentrosymmetric Tetrel Pnictides Composed of Square&#8208;Planar Gold(I) with Peculiar Bonding</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Compared to common types of Au(I) coordination, such as linear, trigonal planar, and tetrahedral units observed in extended solids, the square planar coordination is rare. Au(I)relia, shown in the cover image, exhibits the 3&#8208;centered bonding of Au&#8208;Tt&#8208;Au and Au&#8208;Pn&#8208;Au (on her feathers), square planar cis&#8208;[AuTt2Pn2] units (her pendant), and linear &#8230;&#8208;Au&#8208;Au&#8208;Au&#8208;&#8230; chains (her legs) that are characteristic of the novel equiatomic AuSiAs, AuGeP, and AuGeAs compounds. The image was created by designer Grant Luhmann. More information can be found in the Full Paper by K. Kovnir et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202005312).

The image was created by designer Grant Luhmann. More information can be found in the Full Paper by K. Kovnir et&#8197;al.

         <title>Cationic Zinc Hydride Catalyzed Carbon Dioxide Reduction to Formate: Deciphering Elementary Reactions, Isolation of Intermediates, and Computational Investigations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cooperativity between cationic zinc hydrides and triphenylborane is utilized to catalyze CO2 reduction. Elementary reactions provide insights into a general mechanism for zinc hydride promoted CO2 hydrosilylation and hydroboration. The significance of the zinc&#8208;bound ligand denticity and the Lewis acid additive role in the catalytic process is highlighted. More information can be found in the Full Paper by L. Maron, A. Venugopal, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202005392).

         <title>Interconnectivity between Surface Reactivity and Self&#8208;Assembly of Kemp Elimination Catalyzing Nanorods</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;powered assembly: Synthetic functional assembly of catalytic unit (gold nanorod), principally regulated through their surface catalytic reactivity towards proton transfer reaction is reported. The hydrophobic cavities formed during flocking of gold nanorods has been utilized as reactors for hydrophobic substrates towards aromatic nucleophilic substitution reaction in aqueous media, demonstrating a catalytic cascading which is completely unrelated to primary reaction products.







Abstract
Understanding the fundamental facts behind dynamicity of catalytic processes has been a longstanding quest across disciplines. Herein, we report self&#8208;assembly of catalytically active gold nanorods that can be regulated by tuning its reactivity towards a proton transfer reaction at different pH. Unlike substrate&#8208;induced templating and co&#8208;operativity, the enhanced aggregation rate is due to alteration of catalytic surface charge only during reactivity as negatively charged transition state of reactant (5&#8208;nitrobenzisoxazole) is formed on positively charged nanorod while undergoing a concerted E2&#8208;pathway. Herein, enhanced diffusivity during catalytic processes might also act as an additional contributing factor. Furthermore, we have also shown that nanosized hydrophobic cavities of clustered nanorods can also efficiently accelerate the rate of an aromatic nucleophilic substitution reaction, which also demonstrates a catalytic phenomenon that can lead to cascading of other reactions where substrates and products of the starting reactions are not directly involved.

         <title>Rapid and Mild Lactamization Using Highly Electrophilic Triphosgene in a Microflow Reactor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rapid (0.5 to 10&#8197;s), mild, inexpensive, and less wasteful lactamization was achieved using highly electrophilic triphosgene in a micro&#8208;flow reactor. This work reports two methods using NMM and NMI, respectively. The slight difference in basicity is critical in the lactamization depending on the type of lactam. A plausible reaction mechanism was discussed. Various lactams as well as a cyclic peptide containing acid&#8208; and/or heat&#8208;labile functional groups were synthesized in good to high yields without tedious purifications. More information can be found in the Full Paper by S. Fuse et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202100059).

         <title>Metal&#8208;Dependent and Selective Crystallization of CAU&#8208;10 and MIL&#8208;53 Frameworks through Linker Nitration</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Starting from 5&#8208;hydroxyisophthalic acid (not shown), in situ nitration leads to different nitrated linker molecules that selectively react with Ga3+ or Al3+ ions to Ga&#8208;MIL&#8208;53 and Al&#8208;CAU&#8208;10 type frameworks, respectively. The pale blue and orange light path represents the crystallization of the respective MOF. More information can be found in the Full Paper by N. Stock et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202100373).

         <title>The Missing Parent Compound [(C5H5)Fe(&#951;5&#8208;P5)]: Synthesis, Characterization, Coordination Behavior and Encapsulation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The discovery of parent pentaphosphaferrocene [CpFe(&#951;5&#8208;P5)] has been achieved after more than 30 years, closing the gap within the large class of pentaphosphaferrocenes; the cover image depicts the parent compound taking its proper place on the family tree. The influence of the unsubstituted Cp ligand on the complex formation was shown, reflecting specific conditions during the synthesis, its eclipsed conformation, different coordination behavior towards CuI halides and ability to template the construction of nano&#8208;sized fullerene&#8208;like spheres, acting hereby, in contrast to the other homologous, as an electron donor.

         <title>Sulfur&#8208;Induced Growth of Coordination Polymer Derived&#8208;Straight Carbon Nanotubes on Carbon Nanofiber Network for Zn&#8208;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The scheme illustrates the sulfur&#8208;induced synthesis of a Masson pine twigs&#8208;like 3&#8208;dimensional carbon nanofibers network with abundant straight carbon nanotubes from a type of Co&#8208;based coordination polymer, which are encapsulated with Co9S8 nanoparticles. Combined with the effective catalytic sites of the Co, N, and S doped carbon nanofibers/carbon nanotubes and the unique structure of 3&#8208;dimensional cross&#8208;connected carbon nanofiber network, CNFT&#8208;Co9S8&#8208;T shows excellent ORR catalytic activity.







Abstract
Low&#8208;cost heteroatom&#8208;doped carbon nanomaterials have been widely studied for efficient oxygen reduction reaction and energy storage and conversion in metal&#8208;air batteries. A Masson pine twigs&#8208;like 3&#8208;dimensional network construction of carbon nanofibers (CNFs) with abundant straight long Co, N, and S&#8208;doped carbon nanotubes (CNTs) is developed by thermal treatment of Co&#8208;based polymer coated onto polyacrylonitrile nanofiber network together with thiourea at 900&#8201;&#176;C, denoted as CNFT&#8208;Co9S8&#8208;900. It is interesting to note that the introduction of a high concentration of sulfur does not lead to the complete toxicity of catalysts, but promotes the axial growth to selectively form straight CNTs instead of curly bamboo&#8208;like CNTs. The highly graphitized in&#8208;situ grown Co, N, S&#8208;doped CNTs and the 3&#8208;dimensional N&#8208;doped CNF network provide both active catalytic sites and highly conductive paths, which are beneficial for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Thus, the optimal CNFT&#8208;Co9S8&#8208;900 performs the excellent ORR catalytic activity with a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.84&#8197;V and a diffusion&#8208;limited current density of 5.49&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, the CNFT&#8208;Co9S8&#8208;900&#8208;based Zn&#8208;air devices also possess a high power density of 136.9&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 better than commercial Pt/C.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The scheme illustrates&lt;/b&gt; the sulfur&#8208;induced synthesis of a Masson pine twigs&#8208;like 3&#8208;dimensional carbon nanofibers network with abundant straight carbon nanotubes from a type of Co&#8208;based coordination polymer, which are encapsulated with Co&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; nanoparticles. Combined with the effective catalytic sites of the Co, N, and S doped carbon nanofibers/carbon nanotubes and the unique structure of 3&#8208;dimensional cross&#8208;connected carbon nanofiber network, CNFT&#8208;Co&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;T shows excellent ORR catalytic activity.

B12&#8208;derived phenyl&#8208;corrins are antivitamins B12 that resist the enzymatic cleavage of their Co&#8722;C bond. Surprisingly, as shown by ESI&#8208;MS threshold CID, the Co&#8722;Csp2 bonds of phenyl&#8208;corrins are weaker than Co&#8722;Csp3 bonds of analogous methyl&#8208;corrins, contrasting the known effect of the hybridization on bond strengths. Hence, for the behavior of phenyl&#8208;cobalamins as antivitamins B12, stereo&#8208;electronic restrictions of the nucleophilic displacement are more critical than Co&#8722;C bond strengths.

         <title>Glycerol as a Substrate and Inactivator of Coenzyme B12&#8208;Dependent Diol Dehydratase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two distinct enzymes, coenzyme B12&#8208;dependent diol dehydratase (B12&#8208;dDDH) and coenzyme B12&#8208;independent glycerol dehydratase (B12&#8208;iGDH), are capable of catalyzing the selective transformation of glycerol to 3&#8208;hydroxypropionaldehyde. Only the former enzyme is subject to substrate&#8208;induced inactivation, however. Utilizing molecular dynamics (MD), quantum mechanical (QM), and hybrid QM/MM techniques, we found that inactivation in B12&#8208;dDDH occurs if hydrogen abstraction takes place from the &#8216;wrong&#8217; side (C3) of glycerol.







Abstract
Diol dehydratase, dependent on coenzyme B12 (B12&#8208;dDDH), displays a peculiar feature of being inactivated by its native substrate glycerol (GOL). Surprisingly, the isofunctional enzyme, B12&#8208;independent glycerol dehydratase (B12&#8208;iGDH), does not undergo suicide inactivation by GOL. Herein we present a series of QM/MM and MD calculations aimed at understanding the mechanisms of substrate&#8208;induced suicide inactivation in B12&#8208;dDDH and that of resistance of B12&#8208;iGDH to inactivation. We show that the first step in the enzymatic transformation of GOL, hydrogen abstraction, can occur from both ends of the substrate (either C1 or C3 of GOL). Whereas C1 abstraction in both enzymes leads to product formation, C3 abstraction in B12&#8208;dDDH results in the formation of a low energy radical intermediate, which is effectively trapped within a deep well on the potential energy surface. The long lifetime of this radical intermediate likely enables its side reactions, leading to inactivation. In B12&#8208;iGDH, by comparison, C3 abstraction is an endothermic step; consequently, the resultant radical intermediate is not of low energy, and the reverse process of reforming the reactant is possible.

         <title>Enantioselective CO2 Fixation Via a Heck&#8208;Coupling/Carboxylation Cascade Catalyzed by Nickel</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

COTWO task. An enantioselective nickel catalyzed tandem Heck coupling/carboxylation synthetic sequence with CO2 is reported that provides ready access to 2,3&#8208;dihydrobenzofuran&#8208;3&#8208;ylacetic acids and analogous compounds (ee up to 99&#8201;%). Labelling experiments, DFT analysis and X&#8208;ray characterizations enabled both mechanistic steps and stereodiscriminating transition states to be fully elucidated.







Abstract
A novel asymmetric nickel&#8208;based procedure has been developed in which CO2 fixation is achieved as a second step of a truncated Heck coupling. For this, a new chiral ligand has been prepared and shown to achieve enantiomeric excesses up to 99&#8201;%. The overall process efficiently furnishes chiral 2,3&#8208;dihydrobenzofuran&#8208;3&#8208;ylacetic acids, an important class of bioactive products, from easy to prepare starting materials. A combined experimental and computational effort revealed the key steps of the catalytic cycle and suggested the unexpected participation of Ni(I) species in the coupling event.

         <title>Photochemical Activation of Aromatic Aldehydes: Synthesis of Amides, Hydroxamic Acids and Esters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photochemistry. A facile, mild and metal&#8208;free one&#8208;pot protocol for the activation of aromatic aldehydes and their conversion into amides, hydroxamic acids and esters was developed, using cheap household lamps as the light source and thioxanthen&#8208;9&#8208;one as the photocatalyst.







Abstract
A cheap, facile and metal&#8208;free photochemical protocol for the activation of aromatic aldehydes has been developed. Utilizing thioxanthen&#8208;9&#8208;one as the photocatalyst and cheap household lamps as the light source, a variety of aromatic aldehydes have been activated and subsequently converted in a one&#8208;pot reaction into amides, hydroxamic acids and esters in good to high yields. The applicability of this method was highlighted in the synthesis of Moclobemide, a drug against depression and social anxiety. Extended and detailed mechanistic studies have been conducted, in order to determine a plausible mechanism for the reaction.

         <title>Supramolecular Coordination Cages Based on N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene&#8208;Gold(I) Ligands and Their Precursors: Self&#8208;Assembly, Structural Transformation and Guest&#8208;Binding Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a trackable CpZr&#8208;involved cage to cage conversion to generate heteroleptic V2E3 cages from two homoleptic cages with different geometries of V2E3 and V4E6. The heteroleptic assembly can also be formed by ligand displacement transformations from homoleptic assembly.







Abstract
The incorporation of functional groups into the cavity of discrete supramolecular coordination cages (SCCs) will bring unique functions and applications. Here, three dicarboxylate ligands (H2L1Cl, H2L2Cl and H2L3Cl) containing N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) precursors as linkers were introduced to construct SCCs by combining with two C3&#8208;symmertic (CpZr)3(&#956;3&#8208;O)(&#956;2&#8208;OH)3 clusters as three&#8208;connect vertices, resulted in a series of rugby&#8208;like V2E3 (V=vertex, E=edge) type homoleptic cages (SCC&#8208;1, SCC&#8208;2 and SCC&#8208;3). However, V4E6&#8208;type tetrahedral cages (SCC&#8208;4 and SCC&#8208;5), incorporating six Au&#8208;NHC moieties, were obtained when the corresponding NHC&#8208;gold(I) functionalized ligands (H2L1Au, H2L2Au) were applied. For the first time, we present a trackable CpZr&#8208;involved cage to cage conversion to generate a heteroleptic V2E3 cage (SCC&#8208;6) from two homoleptic cages (SCC&#8208;2 and SCC&#8208;5) with different geometries of V2E3 and V4E6. The heteroleptic assembly SCC&#8208;6 can also be formed upon a subcomponent displacement strategy. The structural transformation and reassembly processes were detected and monitored by 1H NMR spectroscopy and electrospray&#8208;ionization mass spectrometry. The formation of heteroleptic assembly was further supported by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. Moreover, homoleptic cage SCC&#8208;2 possesses a trigonal bipyramidal cationic cavity allowing the encapsulation of a series of sulfonate anionic guests.

         <title>Enantioselective Total Synthesis of the Putative Biosynthetic Intermediate Ambruticin J</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The family of anti&#8208;fungal natural products known as the ambruticins are structurally distinguished by a pair of pyran rings adorning a divinylcyclopropane core. Previous characterization of their biosynthesis, including the expression of a genetically modified producing organism, revealed that the polyketide synthase pathway proceeds through a diol intermediate, known as ambruticin J. Here we report the first enantioselective total synthesis of the putative PKS product, ambruticin J, via  a triply&#8208;convergent synthetic route featuring a Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling and a Julia&#8208;Kocienski olefination for fragment assembly. This synthesis takes advantage of synthetic methodology, previously developed by our laboratory, for the stereoselective generation of the trisubstituted cyclopropyl linchpin.</dc:description>

         <title>The Long and Bright Path of a Lanthanide MOF: From Basics towards the Application</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dynamic structural and optical changes of Tb&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks in the presence of aqueous fluoride solutions are reported in this work. The structural transformation of the MOF in the presence of fluorides was scrutinized by XRD, XAFS, and dynamic measurements of the Tb emission, and all the information was summarized in the development of a tech&#8208;demo. The cover shows &#8220;The Great Wave off Kanagawa&#8221; hinting at the flow between the different but connected states of the MOF when the fluoride concentration increases, first increasing the emission by replacement of Tb&#8722;OH groups in the MOF by Tb&#8722;F and later quenching the emission by the formation of TbF3. The cover image was designed by ScienceBrush Design. More information can be found in the Full Paper by E.&#8197;H. Otal, M. Kimura, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202005222).

         <title>Altered Membrane Mechanics Provides a Receptor&#8208;Independent Pathway for Serotonin Action</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Serotonin is an important signaling molecule with a high lipid membrane affinity. Membrane binding of serotonin modulates membrane properties and potentially cellular function as well, providing an activity pathway completely independent of serotonin receptors. The results presented in this study suggest a mode of serotonin&#8211;membrane interaction that can potentiate key cellular processes in a receptor&#8208;independent fashion.

         <title>Click and Release Chemistry for Activity&#8208;Based Purification of &#946;&#8208;Lactam Targets</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we functionalized carbapenem &#946;&#8208;lactams for the development of an original activity&#8208;based purification method of the complex targets of these drugs. The alkyne drug covalently bound to the target specifically reacted with an azido probe containing a biotin moiety for affinity purification and an iminosydnone for single&#8208;step elution and fluorescent labeling of the targets.







Abstract
&#946;&#8208;Lactams, the cornerstone of antibiotherapy, inhibit multiple and partially redundant targets referred to as transpeptidases or penicillin&#8208;binding proteins. These enzymes catalyze the essential cross&#8208;linking step of the polymerization of cell wall peptidoglycan. The understanding of the mechanisms of action of &#946;&#8208;lactams and of resistance to these drugs requires the development of reliable methods to characterize their targets. Here, we describe an activity&#8208;based purification method of &#946;&#8208;lactam targets based on click and release chemistry. We synthesized alkyne&#8208;carbapenems with suitable properties with respect to the kinetics of acylation of a model target, the Ldtfm L,D&#8208;transpeptidase, the stability of the resulting acylenzyme, and the reactivity of the alkyne for the cycloaddition of an azido probe containing a biotin moiety for affinity purification and a bioorthogonal cleavable linker. The probe provided access to the fluorescent target in a single click and release step.

         <title>Circularly Polarized Fluorescent Helicene&#8208;Boranils: Synthesis, Photophysical and Chiroptical Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Helicene&#8208;mono&#8208; and bis&#8208;boranils have been prepared in enantiopure forms. The chiroptical (electronic circular dichroism and optical rotation) and photophysical properties (unpolarized and circularly polarized luminescence) of these new chiral emissive helicenes have been studied both experimentally and theoretically and highlight their combined helical and axial chirality effects.







Abstract
Mono&#8208; and di&#8208;boranil&#8208;substituted helicenes were prepared by BF2&#8208;borylation of the corresponding anils, readily synthesized by condensation of 2&#8208;amino&#8208; and 2,15&#8208;diamino&#8208;helicenes with 4&#8208;(diethylamino)salicylaldehyde. After enantiomeric resolution using HPLC, their chiroptical properties including circularly polarized fluorescence in solution and in PMMA films were investigated and rationalized with the help of NMR, X&#8208;ray and quantum&#8208;chemical calculations.

         <title>Vapochromic Luminescent &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Systems with Reversible Coordination&#8208;Number Control of Hypervalent Tin(IV)&#8208;Fused Azobenzene Complexes</title>

         <dc:description>
Vapochromic luminescence of hypervalent tin(IV) complexes: Hypervalent tin(IV) complexes having deep&#8208;red emission can be synthesized. The critically narrow energy gap was attributed to three&#8208;center four&#8208;electron (3c&#8211;4e) bonds. Furthermore, dynamic and reversible color changes of the &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems were caused by coordination&#8208;number control of the hypervalent tin(IV) complexes. The color&#8208;change mechanism and degree of binding constants were well explained by theoretical calculation.







Abstract
The dynamic and reversible changes of coordination numbers between five and six in solution and solid states, based on hypervalent tin(IV)&#8208;fused azobenzene (TAz) complexes, are reported. It was found that the TAz complexes showed deep&#8208;red emission owing to the hypervalent bond composed of an electron&#8208;donating three&#8208;center four&#8208;electron (3c&#8211;4e) bond and an electron&#8208;accepting nitrogen&#8211;tin (N&#8211;Sn) coordination. Furthermore, hypsochromic shifts in optical spectra were observed in Lewis basic solvents because of alteration of the coordination number from five to six. In particular, vapochromic luminescence was induced by attachment of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) vapor to the coordination point at the tin atom accompanied with a crystal&#8211;crystal phase transition. Additionally, the color&#8208;change mechanism and degree of binding constants were well explained by theoretical calculation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of vapochromic luminescence by using stable and variable coordination numbers of hypervalent bonds.

         <title>Synergistic Effect of Boron Nitride and Carbon Domains in Boron Carbide Nitride Nanotube Supported Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Efficient Nitrogen Fixation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 23, Page 6945-6953, April 21, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single metal atoms supported on boron carbide nitride nanotubes are considered as promising electrocatalysts for N2 reduction to NH3 with high activity and selectivity. The outstanding performance is ascribed to the synergistic effect of boron nitride and carbon domains, which tuned the charge polarization of metal&#8208;atom active site and the electronic properties of material.







Abstract
Developing the low&#8208;cost and efficient single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) for nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) is of great importance while remains as a great challenge. The catalytic activity, selectivity and durability are all fundamentally related to the elaborate coordination environment of SACs. Using first&#8208;principles calculations, we investigated the SACs with single transition metal (TM) atom supported on defective boron carbide nitride nanotubes (BCNTs) as NRR electrocatalysts. Our results suggest that boron&#8208;vacancy defects on BCNTs can strongly immobilize TM atoms with large enough binding energy and high thermal/structural stability. Importantly, the synergistic effect of boron nitride (BN) and carbon domains comes up with the modifications of the charge polarization of single&#8208;TM&#8208;atom active site and the electronic properties of material, which has been proven to be the essential key to promote N2 adsorption, activation, and reduction. Specifically, six SACs (namely V, Mn, Fe, Mo, Ru, and W atoms embedded into defective BCNTs) can be used as promising candidates for NRR electrocatalysts as their NRR activity is higher than the state&#8208;of&#8208;the art Ru(0001) catalyst. In particular, single Mo atom supported on defective BCNTs with large tube diameter possesses the highest NRR activity while suppressing the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction, with a low limiting potential of &#8722;0.62&#8197;V via associative distal path. This work suggests new opportunities for driving NH3 production by carbon&#8208;based single&#8208;atom electrocatalysts under ambient conditions.

         <title>Naphthalenediimides with High Fluorescence Quantum Yield: Bright&#8208;Red, Stable, and Responsive Fluorescent Dyes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 23, Page 6954-6962, April 21, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first example of a bis&#8208;NH2 core&#8208;substituted naphthalenediimide (NDI) with remarkably high 
. A simple synthetic protocol to NH2&#8208;substituted NDIs is described. Dependent on the substituents, fluorescence can be tuned from bright&#8208;green to the red/NIR region and the 
 modulated by two orders of magnitude. These fluorophores show large Stokes&#8208;shift and great responsiveness to solvent polarity.







Abstract
The naphthalenediimide (NDI) scaffold in contrast to its higher congeners possess low&#8208;fluorescence. In spite of elegant synthetic developments, a highly emissive NDI is quite rare to find, as well as, a green&#8208;light&#8208;emitting NDI is yet to be explored. Herein, we report a novel class of symmetric and asymmetric NH2&#8208;substituted core&#8208;NDIs (1&#8211;5) with tunable fluorescence in the visible region and extending to the NIR frontier. Importantly, the bis&#8208;NH2&#8208;substituted NDI 2 revealed quantum yield, 
 of &#8776;81 and &#8776;68&#8201;% in toluene and DMSO, respectively, suggesting versatility of the fluorophore in a wide range of solvent polarity. The dye 1 is shown to be the first NDI&#8208;based green&#8208;light emitter. The donor piperidine group in 5 diminish the 
 by 40&#8208;fold providing a lever to modulate the excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) process. Our synthetic protocol applies a Pd catalyst and a benign hydride source simplifying the non&#8208;trivial &#8722;NH2 group integration at the NDI&#8208;core. TD&#8208;DFT calculations predicted strong intramolecular hydrogen bonds in the excited state in the bulk nonpolar medium and responsiveness to solvent polarity. The maximization of the NDI emission outlined here would further boost the burgeoning repertoire of applications of the NDI scaffold.

         <title>Organic Nanoparticles with Persistent Luminescence for In Vivo Afterglow Imaging&#8208;Guided Photodynamic Therapy</title>

Afterglow organic nanoparticles (ONPs) with long lifetime and near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emission offered high signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio and good tissue penetration for afterglow imaging&#8208;guided photodynamic therapy (PDT) in vivo. Owing to strong afterglow luminescence and abundant singlet oxygen generation from the ONPs upon NIR laser irradiation, they have shown effective suppression of tumor growth after imaging&#8208;guided PDT in mice with minimal damage to major organs.







Abstract
Optical imaging&#8208;guided photodynamic therapy (PDT), with precise localization and non&#8208;invasive treatment of tumors, is an emerging technique with great potential for cancer therapy. However, impaired by tissue auto&#8208;fluorescence that causes low signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio (SBR), most fluorescence imaging systems show poor sensitivity to tumors in vivo. In this study, we synthesized organic nanoparticles (ONPs) with persistent luminescence and good biocompatibility for afterglow imaging&#8208;guided PDT. The ONPs displayed near&#8208;infrared light emission with half&#8208;life time at minute level, which offered high SBR and good tissue penetration for in vivo afterglow tumor imaging. Taking advantage of their abundant singlet oxygen generation by NIR laser irradiation guided to the tumor sites, the ONPs also enabled imaging&#8208;guided PDT for efficient suppression of tumor growth in mice with minimal damage to major organs.

         <title>Prediction of Spin Density, Baird&#8208;Antiaromaticity, and Singlet&#8211;Triplet Energy Gap in Triplet&#8208;State Polybenzenoid Systems from Simple Structural Motifs</title>

Spin density guidelines: Characterization of T1 polybenzenoid hydrocarbons (PBHs) reveals that spin density localizes on specific substructures, according to a hierarchy of motifs. A set of general guidelines is defined, allowing prediction of the location of spin density and Baird&#8208;antiaromaticity in PBHs of varying topology and, in addition, prediction of relative T1 energies and singlet&#8211;triplet gaps.







Abstract
Triplet&#8208;state aromaticity has been recently proposed as a strategy for designing functional organic electronic compounds, many of which are polycyclic aromatic systems. However, in many cases, the aromatic nature of the triplet state cannot be easily predicted. Moreover, it is often unclear how specific structural manipulations affect the electronic properties of the excited&#8208;state compounds. Herein, the relationship between the structure of polybenzenoid hydrocarbons (PBHs) and their spin&#8208;density distribution and aromatic character in the first triplet excited state is studied. Although a direct link is not immediately visible, classifying the PBHs according to their annulation sequence reveals regularities. Based on these, a set of guidelines is defined to qualitatively predict the location of spin and paratropicity and the singlet&#8211;triplet energy gap in larger PBHs, using only their smaller tri&#8208; and tetracyclic components, and subsequently tested on larger systems.

Two dimensional nanomaterials: An asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC, HRG//m&#8208;WO3 ASC) fabricated from tungsten oxide (m&#8208;WO3) nanoplates as a negative electrode and highly reduced graphene oxide (HRG) as a positive electrode material attains specific capacitance of 389&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1 at a current density of 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, with an associated high energy density of 93&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 at a power density of 500&#8197;W&#8201;kg&#8722;1 in a wide 1.6&#8197;V operating potential window. In addition, the HRG//m&#8208;WO3 ASC displays long&#8208;term cycling&#8208;stability, maintaining around 92&#8201;% of the original specific capacitance after 5000 galvanostatic charge&#8211;discharge cycles.







Abstract
Tungsten oxide/graphene hybrid materials are attractive semiconductors for energy&#8208;related applications. Herein, we report an asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC, HRG//m&#8208;WO3 ASC), fabricated from monoclinic tungsten oxide (m&#8208;WO3) nanoplates as a negative electrode and highly reduced graphene oxide (HRG) as a positive electrode material. The supercapacitor performance of the prepared electrodes was evaluated in an aqueous electrolyte (1&#8201;m H2SO4) using three&#8208; and two&#8208;electrode systems. The HRG//m&#8208;WO3 ASC exhibits a maximum specific capacitance of 389&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1 at a current density of 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, with an associated high energy density of 93&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 at a power density of 500&#8197;W&#8201;kg&#8722;1 in a wide 1.6&#8197;V operating potential window. In addition, the HRG//m&#8208;WO3 ASC displays long&#8208;term cycling stability, maintaining 92&#8201;% of the original specific capacitance after 5000 galvanostatic charge&#8211;discharge cycles. The m&#8208;WO3 nanoplates were prepared hydrothermally while HRG was synthesized by a modified Hummers method.

         <title>Carbohydrate&#8208;Derived Metal&#8208;Chelator&#8208;Triggered Lipids for Liposomal Drug Delivery</title>

Liposomes deliver: Glucose was used as template for stimuli&#8208;responsive lipids that can exist in two conformational states. In the active ON state, a Zn2+ ion is complexed by the polar head group of the lipid. The inactive OFF state can be achieved by treating the active lipid with a metal chelator. The active lipids were incorporated into the membrane of liposomes containing a fluorescent cargo. In the presence of a metal chelator, a change in conformation of the incorporated lipids resulted in the release of the cargo from the liposomes, which suggests potential applications in drug delivery.







Abstract
Liposomes are versatile three&#8208;dimensional, biomaterial&#8208;based frameworks that can spatially enclose a variety of organic and inorganic biomaterials for advanced targeted&#8208;delivery applications. Implementation of external&#8208;stimuli&#8208;controlled release of their cargo will significantly augment their wide application for liposomal drug delivery. This paper presents the synthesis of a carbohydrate&#8208;derived lipid, capable of changing its conformation depending on the presence of Zn2+: an active state in the presence of Zn2+ ions and back to an inactive state in the absence of Zn2+ or when exposed to Na2EDTA, a metal chelator with high affinity for Zn2+ ions. This is the first report of a lipid triggered by the presence of a metal chelator. Total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy and a single&#8208;liposome study showed that it indeed was possible for the lipid to be incorporated into the bilayer of stable liposomes that remained leakage&#8208;free for the fluorescent cargo of the liposomes. On addition of EDTA to the liposomes, their fluorescent cargo could be released as a result of the membrane&#8208;incorporated lipids undergoing a conformational change.

Donation of an electron pair from the HOMO of [Fe(CO)5]2 to the 4s LUMO of Cu+ giving the (+,+) component of the Fe&#8208;Cu&#8208;Fe &#963; bond in [Cu{Fe(CO)5}2]+. The associated charge flow with the direction red&#8594;blue is given by the deformation density.







Abstract
Syntheses of the copper and gold complexes [Cu{Fe(CO)5}2][SbF6] and [Au{Fe(CO)5}2][HOB{3,5&#8208;(CF3)2C6H3}3] containing the homoleptic carbonyl cations [M{Fe(CO)5}2]+ (M=Cu, Au) are reported. Structural data of the rare, trimetallic Cu2Fe, Ag2Fe and Au2Fe complexes [Cu{Fe(CO)5}2][SbF6], [Ag{Fe(CO)5}2][SbF6] and [Au{Fe(CO)5}2][HOB{3,5&#8208;(CF3)2C6H3}3] are also given. The silver and gold cations [M{Fe(CO)5}2]+ (M=Ag, Au) possess a nearly linear Fe&#8208;M&#8208;Fe&#8217; moiety but the Fe&#8208;Cu&#8208;Fe&#8217; in [Cu{Fe(CO)5}2][SbF6] exhibits a significant bending angle of 147&#176; due to the strong interaction with the [SbF6]&#8722; anion. The Fe(CO)5 ligands adopt a distorted square&#8208;pyramidal geometry in the cations [M{Fe(CO)5}2]+, with the basal CO groups inclined towards M. The geometry optimization with DFT methods of the cations [M{Fe(CO)5}2]+ (M=Cu, Ag, Au) gives equilibrium structures with linear Fe&#8208;M&#8208;Fe&#8217; fragments and D2 symmetry for the copper and silver cations and D4d symmetry for the gold cation. There is nearly free rotation of the Fe(CO)5 ligands around the Fe&#8208;M&#8208;Fe&#8217; axis. The calculated bond dissociation energies for the loss of both Fe(CO)5 ligands from the cations [M{Fe(CO)5}2]+ show the order M=Au (De=137.2&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1)&gt;Cu (De=109.0&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1)&gt;Ag (De=92.4&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1). The QTAIM analysis shows bond paths and bond critical points for the M&#8722;Fe linkage but not between M and the CO ligands. The EDA&#8208;NOCV calculations suggest that the [Fe(CO)5]&#8594;M+&#8592;[Fe(CO)5] donation is significantly stronger than the [Fe(CO)5]&#8592;M+&#8594;[Fe(CO)5] backdonation. Inspection of the pairwise orbital interactions identifies four contributions for the charge donation of the Fe(CO)5 ligands into the vacant (n)s and (n)p AOs of M+ and five components for the backdonation from the occupied (n&#8208;1)d AOs of M+ into vacant ligand orbitals.

         <title>Scalable Synthesis of Porous SiFe@C Composite with Excellent Lithium Storage</title>

Threesome is impressive: A novel and scalable strategy for the fabrication of porous SiFe@C composite with mesoporous structure is reported. The conductive phase of FeSi2 is partially retained; together with a uniform carbon layer excellent lithium storage is achieved.







Abstract
Utilizing cost&#8208;effective raw materials to prepare high&#8208;performance silicon&#8208;based anode materials for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) is both challenging and attractive. Herein, a porous SiFe@C (pSiFe@C) composite derived from low&#8208;cost ferrosilicon is prepared via a scalable three&#8208;step procedure, including ball milling, partial etching, and carbon layer coating. The pSiFe@C material integrates the advantages of the mesoporous structure, the partially retained FeSi2 conductive phase, and a uniform carbon layer (12&#8211;16&#8197;nm), which can substantially alleviate the huge volume expansion effect in the repeated lithium&#8208;ion insertion/extraction processes, effectively stabilizing the solid&#8211;electrolyte interphase (SEI) film and markedly enhancing the overall electronic conductivity of the material. Benefiting from the rational structure, the obtained pSiFe@C hybrid material delivers a reversible capacity of 1162.1&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 200&#8197;cycles at 500&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1, with a higher initial coulombic efficiency of 82.30&#8201;%. In addition, it shows large discharge capacities of 803.1 and 600.0&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 500&#8197;cycles at 2 and 4&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, respectively, manifesting an excellent electrochemical lithium storage. This work provides a good prospect for the commercial production of silicon&#8208;based anode materials for LIBs with a high lithium&#8208;storage capacity.

         <title>Catalytic Performance of Zr&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks Zr&#8208;abtc and MIP&#8208;200 in Selective Oxidations with H2O2</title>

An eight&#8208;connected metal&#8211;organic framework Zr&#8208;abtc catalyzes a range of H2O2&#8208;based selective oxidations. The significant predominance of 1,2&#8208;epoxide in the epoxidation of carvone and high sulfone selectivity in thioether oxidation point to a nucleophilic oxidation mechanism. With highly reactive alkenes, such as caryophyllene, electrophilic oxidation can also be realized.







Abstract
The catalytic performance of Zr&#8208;abtc and MIP&#8208;200 metal&#8211;organic frameworks consisting of 8&#8208;connected Zr6 clusters and tetratopic linkers was investigated in H2O2&#8208;based selective oxidations and compared with that of 12&#8208;coordinated UiO&#8208;66 and UiO&#8208;67. Zr&#8208;abtc demonstrated advantages in both substrate conversion and product selectivity for epoxidation of electron&#8208;deficient C=C bonds in &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones. The significant predominance of 1,2&#8208;epoxide in carvone epoxidation, coupled with high sulfone selectivity in thioether oxidation, points to a nucleophilic oxidation mechanism over Zr&#8208;abtc. The superior catalytic performance in the epoxidation of unsaturated ketones correlates with a larger amount of weak basic sites in Zr&#8208;abtc. Electrophilic activation of H2O2 can also be realized, as evidenced by the high activity of Zr&#8208;abtc in epoxidation of the electron&#8208;rich C=C bond in caryophyllene. XRD and FTIR studies confirmed the retention of the Zr&#8208;abtc structure after the catalysis. The low activity of MIP&#8208;200 in H2O2&#8208;based oxidations is most likely related to its specific hydrophilicity, which disfavors adsorption of organic substrates and H2O2.

         <title>Front Cover: Organic Nanoparticles with Persistent Luminescence for In Vivo Afterglow Imaging&#8208;Guided Photodynamic Therapy (Chem. Eur. J. 23/2021)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 23, Page 6815-6815, April 21, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Afterglow organic nanoparticles (ONPs) with long lifetime and near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emission offered high signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio and good tissue penetration for afterglow imaging&#8208;guided photodynamic therapy (PDT) in vivo. Owing to strong afterglow fluorescence and abundant singlet oxygen generation from the ONPs upon NIR laser irradiation, they have shown effective suppression of tumor growth after imaging&#8208;guided PDT in mice with minimal damage to major organs. More information can be found in the Full Paper by B. Liu, A. Tong, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202100406).

Structure, sequence, spin: The structures of polybenzenoid hydrocarbons are analyzed in terms of the sequence of tricyclic annulations, revealing regularities in the location of spin density and Baird&#8208;antiaromaticity. The two properties localize onto specific tri&#8208; and tetracyclic substructures according to a hierarchy: linear, zig&#8208;zag, curved. The same preferences are reflected in the relative energy of the T1 systems and in the singlet&#8208;triplet energy gaps. More information can be found in the Full Paper by R. Gershoni&#8208;Poranne et&#8197;al. on page 6923.

         <dc:description>
Mechanochemistry, especially ball&#8208;milling, is still lacking a systematic and mechanistic understanding. Success is thus also governed by chance. As a result, only a few scientists dare to play in this field and try their fate. Nonetheless, such a trial&#8208;and&#8208;error basis has led quite often to remarkable discoveries, such as the synthesis of interesting nanostructured catalyst materials, unusual phases, or complex composites, often surpassing in convenience the traditional methods typically applied by default. For more information, see the Review by F. Sch&#252;th et&#8197;al. on page 6819.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 23, April 21, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intermediate valence states in lanthanide compounds have often resulted in unexpected or puzzling spectroscopic and magnetic properties. In their Minireview on page 6860, Thomas Simler, Gr&#233;gory Nocton and colleagues highlight the different singularities that have been observed among lanthanide complexes, detail the models used to rationalise them and show how such electronic effects may be adjusted depending on energy and symmetry considerations.

Permanganyl fluoride's existence at the stability threshold in the series of oxides and oxide fluorides of the late 3d transition metals is reflected by its experimentally challenging properties. The Review article by Hubert Schmidbaur and W.&#8197;H.&#8197;Eugen Schwarz on page 6848 deals with the history of this molecule and takes the reader through early qualitative observations and the growing scattered information on its chemical and physical properties to the accurate determination and interpretation of its molecular structure and spectral features.

Hydroaminoalkylation! In this work, the conversion of alkynes into allylic amines within an unbelievably short reaction time of 4&#8197;h is presented. In addition to the fast reaction, hydroaminoalkylation is promoted by broad scope, high yields, and excellent stereoselectivity to provide access to synthetically useful products in record time. More information can be found in the Communication by R. Beckhaus, S. Doye, et&#8197;al. on page 6899.

Stimuli&#8208;responsive lipids based on a glucose head group could promote pore formation in the membrane of liposomes upon treatment with EDTA. Using a total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy setup, it was possible to monitor the release of a fluorescent dye from liposomes containing the metal chelator&#8208;responsive lipids. The liposomes containing the lipids remained stable and able to incapsulate the cargo in the absence of EDTA. Only when introducing the metal chelating EDTA to the liposomes would they release their cargo through pores formed in their membrane. This could serve as a platform for future drug&#8208;delivery systems. More information can be found in the Full Paper by C.&#8197;M. Pedersen et&#8197;al. on page 6917.

         <title>Permanganyl Fluoride: A Brief History of the Molecule MnO3F and of Those Who Cared For It</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 23, Page 6848-6859, April 21, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Permanganyl fluoride is positioned at the stability threshold of the metal oxide fluorides of the 3d elements in their highest oxidation states. The history of this compound reflects the experimental and theoretical challenges faced by scientists over two centuries. The spectroscopic features of the molecule with its apparently simple closed&#8208;shell configuration [Mn7+(d0), 3&#215;O2&#8722;(p6), F1&#8722;(p6)] reveal an extremely complex electronic structure with non&#8208;innocent ligands exerting an inverted ligand field.







Abstract
Permanganyl fluoride's existence at the stability threshold in the series of oxides and oxide fluorides of the late 3d transition metals is reflected by its experimentally challenging properties and by the difficulties posed in the theoretical description of its bonding characteristics. The history of this molecule is reviewed from early qualitative observations and the growing scattered information on its chemical and physical properties to the accurate determination and interpretation of its molecular structure and spectral features. The still problematic theoretical models for MnO4&#8722; and MnO3F are briefly presented in the broader context of the chemistry of elements in high oxidation states. Short biographies of the scientists engaged in these studies are offered. Related technetium and rhenium compounds are briefly considered for comparison.

         <title>Intermediate Valence States in Lanthanide Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 23, Page 6860-6879, April 21, 2021. </description>

Intermediate valence states: This review summarizes the spectroscopic and magnetic singularities gathered over more than 50 years and pointing to intermediate valence states in lanthanide compounds. This substantial body of evidence, supported by advanced computational studies, bolsters ground&#8208;state multiconfigurational behaviour. Understanding and tuning these effects through symmetry and energy considerations paves the way to novel and unusual reactivities.







Abstract
Over more than 50&#8197;years, intermediate valence states in lanthanide compounds have often resulted in unexpected or puzzling spectroscopic and magnetic properties. Such experimental singularities could not be rationalised until new theoretical models involving multiconfigurational electronic ground states were established. In this minireview, the different singularities that have been observed among lanthanide complexes are highlighted, the models used to rationalise them are detailed and how such electronic effects may be adjusted depending on energy and symmetry considerations is considered. Understanding and tuning the ground&#8208;state multiconfigurational behaviour in lanthanide complexes may open new doors to modular and unusual reactivities.

         <title>Mechanochemical Synthesis of Catalytic Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 23, Page 6819-6847, April 21, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanochemical routes enable the synthesis of different families of catalytic materials in a more sustainable and convenient way than classical methods. In addition, unusual properties may arise, leading to improved catalytic performance. The review covers the major achievements in the synthesis of catalysts assisted by mechanochemistry, discusses associated aspects, and provides perspectives.







Abstract
The mechanochemical synthesis of nanomaterials for catalytic applications is a growing research field due to its simplicity, scalability, and eco&#8208;friendliness. Besides, it provides materials with distinct features, such as nanocrystallinity, high defect concentration, and close interaction of the components in a system, which are, in most cases, unattainable by conventional routes. Consequently, this research field has recently become highly popular, particularly for the preparation of catalytic materials for various applications, ranging from chemical production over energy conversion catalysis to environmental protection. In this Review, recent studies on mechanochemistry for the synthesis of catalytic materials are discussed. Emphasis is placed on the straightforwardness of the mechanochemical route&#8212;in contrast to more conventional synthesis&#8212;in fabricating the materials, which otherwise often require harsh conditions. Distinct material properties achieved by mechanochemistry are related to their improved catalytic performance.

Viscosity, as a vital microenvironment parameter, is tightly associated with multitudinous cellular processes and diseases. In this minireview, the viscosity&#8208;sensitive small molecular fluorescent probes used in bioimaging are comprehensively summarized, mainly focusing on the last three years.

Abstract
Viscosity, as a vital microenvironment parameter, is tightly associated with multitudinous cellular processes and diseases. Recently, precise visualization of viscosity has started to arouse more and more interest. However, owing to the complicated character, it is still a huge challenge to directly observe viscosity in living systems. In this regard, mounting fluorescence probes are being increasingly fabricated to map viscosity inside live cells and small animals. In this minireview, the viscosity&#8208;sensitive small molecular fluorescent probes used in bioimaging are comprehensively summarized, mainly focusing on the last three years. Moreover, the current challenges and opportunities for the development of viscosity&#8208;specific fluorescent probes will be discussed.

         <title>Directed Assembly of Multi&#8208;Walled Nanotubes and Nanoribbons of Amino Acid Amphiphiles Using a Layer&#8208;by&#8208;Layer Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 23, Page 6904-6910, April 21, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multi&#8208;walled nanotubes and nanoribbons of amino acid amphiphiles are fabricated by using a layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer technique, where successive rigid amphiphile layers are glued together by oppositely charged polyelectrolyte. The resulting well&#8208;defined 1D structures are attractive as potential biocompatible delivery systems and building blocks in nanotechnology.







Abstract
Monodisperse unilamellar nanotubes (NTs) and nanoribbons (NRs) were transformed to multilamellar NRs and NTs in a well&#8208;defined fashion. This was done by using a step&#8208;wise approach in which self&#8208;assembled cationic amino acid amphiphile (AAA) formed the initial NTs or NRs, and added polyanion produced an intermediate coating. Successive addition of cationic AAA formed a covering AAA layer, and by repeating this layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer (LBL) procedure, multi&#8208;walled nanotubes (mwNTs) and nanoribbons were formed. This process was structurally investigated by combining small&#8208;angle neutron scattering (SANS) and cryogenic&#8208;transmission electron microscopy (cryo&#8208;TEM), confirming the multilamellar structure and the precise layer spacing. In this way the controlled formation of multi&#8208;walled suprastructures was demonstrated in a simple and reproducible fashion, which allowed to control the charge on the surface of these 1D aggregates. This pathway to 1D colloidal materials is interesting for applications in life science and creating well&#8208;defined building blocks in nanotechnology.

         <title>Intermolecular Hydroaminoalkylation of Alkynes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 23, Page 6899-6903, April 21, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Allylic amines are directly formed from secondary amines and alkynes in the presence of highly active titanium catalysts. The corresponding hydroaminoalkylation reactions, which take place by C&#8722;H bond activation at sp3&#8208;centers in the &#945;&#8208;position to a nitrogen atom, can be achieved with internal and terminal alkynes, and best results are obtained with N&#8208;benzylaniline derivatives.







Abstract
Intermolecular hydroaminoalkylation reactions of alkynes with secondary amines, which selectively give access to allylic amines with E configuration of the alkene unit, are achieved in the presence of titanium catalysts. Successful reactions of symmetrically substituted diaryl&#8208; and dialkylalkynes as well as a terminal alkyne take place with N&#8208;benzylanilines, N&#8208;alkylanilines, and N&#8208;alkylbenzylamines.

         <title>CoS2/N&#8208;doped Hollow Spheres as Anode Material for High Performance Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, we first synthesized polyacrylic acid (PAA) spheres and used PAA as a template to load Co(OH)  2  particles on its surface. The product of CoS  2  nanoparticles dispersed in N&#8208;doped hollow spheres (N&#8208;HCS) was prepared through sulfurization treatment (CoS  2  /S@N&#8208;HCS). During the sulfuration process, S will penetrate into the PAA and be embedded in the graphite layer along with the carbonization process. It was found that during the charging and discharging process, the S in the carbon layer will gradually dissolve out, thereby forming new ion diffusion channels in the carbon spheres and exposing more CoS  2  active sites. CoS  2  /S@N&#8208;HCS composite exhibits a specific capacity of 729.6 mAh g  &#8208;1  after 500 cycles at a current density of 1 A g  &#8208;1  . The sodium storage mechanism and reaction kinetics of the materials were further measured by in&#8208;situ electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, ex&#8208;situ X&#8208;ray diffraction, capacitance performance evaluation and galvanostatic intermittent titration technique. The excellent cycling performance and rate capability demonstrated that the CoS  2  /S@N&#8208;HCS is a potential and prospective anode material for sodium&#8208;ion batteries.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Regulating the structure of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) by adjusting the ligands reasonably is expected to enhance the interaction of MOFs on special molecules/ions, which has significant application value for the selective adsorption of guest molecules. In this work, two tricarboxylic ligands H3L&#8208;Cl and H3L&#8208;NH2 were designed and synthesized based on the ligand H3TTCA by replacing part of the benzene rings with C=C bonds and modifying the chlorine and amino groups on the 4&#8208;position of the benzene ring. Two 3D Fe&#8208;MOFs (UPC&#8208;60&#8208;Cl and UPC&#8208;60&#8208;NH2) with the novel topology types were constructed. As the C=C bonds of the ligands have flexible torsion angles, UPC&#8208;60&#8208;Cl features three types of irregular 2D channels, while UPC&#8208;60&#8208;NH2 has a cage with two types of windows on the surface. The synergistic effect of unique channels and modification of functional groups endows UPC&#8208;60&#8208;Cl and UPC&#8208;60&#8208;NH2 with high adsorption capacity for organic dyes. UPC&#8208;60&#8208;Cl shows high adsorption capacity for CV (147.2 mg g&#8208;1), RHB (100.3 mg g&#8208;1), and MO (220.9 mg g&#8208;1), while UPC&#8208;60&#8208;NH2 exhibits selective adsorption of MO (158.7 mg g&#8208;1). Meanwhile, based on the&#160;diverse pore structure and modification of active sites, UPC&#8208;60&#8208;Cl and UPC&#8208;60&#8208;NH2 show the selective separation of equimolar C2H2/CO2. Therefore, reasonable regulation of organic ligands plays a significant role in guiding the structure diversification and performance improvement of MOFs.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;pot synthesis of 11C&#8208;labelled primary benzamides via intermediate [11C]aroyl dimethylaminopyridinium salts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrophilic  11  C&#8208;labelled aroyl dimethylaminopyridinium salts, obtained by carbonylative cross coupling of aryl halides with [  11  C]carbon monoxide, were prepared for the first time and shown to be valuable intermediates in the synthesis of primary [  11  C]benzamides. The methodology furnished a set of benzamide model compounds, including the two poly (ADP&#8208;ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors niraparib and veliparib, in moderate to excellent radiochemical yields. In addition to providing a convenient and practical route to primary&#160;[  11  C]benzamides, the current methodology paves the way for future application of [  11  C]aroyl dimethylaminopyridinium halide salts in PET tracer synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Probing the Catalytically Active Species in POM&#8208;catalysed DNA&#8208;model Hydrolysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phosphoester hydrolysis is an important chemical step in DNA repair. One archetypal molecular model of phosphoesters is para&#8208;nitrophenylphosphate (pNPP). It has been shown previously that the presence of molecular metal oxide [Mo  7  O  24  ]  6&#8211;  may catalyse the hydrolysis of pNPP through the partial decomposition of polyoxomolybdate framework resulting in a [(PO  4  )  2  Mo  5  O  15  ]  6&#8211;  product. Real&#8208;time monitoring of the catalytic system using electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry (ESI&#8208;MS) provided a glance into the species present in the reaction mixture and identification of potential catalytic candidates. Following up on the obtained spectrometric data, Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations were carried out to characterise the hypothetical intermediate [Mo  5  O  15  (pNPP)  2  (H  2  O)  6  ]  6&#8211;  that would be required to form under the hypothesised transformation. Surprisingly, our results point to the dimeric [Mo  2  O  8  ]  4&#8211;  anion resulting from the decomposition of [Mo  7  O  24  ]  6&#8211;  as the active catalytic species involved in the hydrolysis of pNPP rather than the originally assumed {Mo  5  O  15  } species. A similar study was carried out involving the same species but substituting Mo by W. The mechanism involving W species showed a higher barrier and less stable products in agreement with the non&#8208;catalytic effect found in experimental results</dc:description>

         <title>Fundamental Characterization, Photophysics and Photocatalysis of a Base Metal Iron(II)&#8208;Cobalt(III) Dyad</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new base metal iron&#8208;cobalt dyad is presented, connecting a heteroleptic tetra&#8209;NHC iron(II) photosensitizer combining a 2,6&#8208;bis[3&#8208;(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene]pyridine) with 2,6&#8208;bis(3&#8208;methyl&#8208;imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene)&#8208;4,4'&#8208;bipyridine ligand, and a cobaloxime catalyst. This iron(II)&#8208;cobalt(III) assembly is characterized by ground and excited state methods like X&#8209;ray crystallography, X&#8209;ray absorption spectroscopy, (spectro&#8209;)electrochemistry, and steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved optical absorption spectroscopy, with a focus on the stability of the assembly in solution and the determination of the excited state landscape. NMR and UV&#8209;Vis spectroscopy reveal dissociation of the dyad in acetonitrile at concentrations below 1 mM and high photostability. Transient absorption spectroscopy after excitation into the metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer absorption band suggests a relaxation cascade originating from hot singlet and triplet &#160;MLCT states, leading to the population of the  3  MLCT state that exhibits the longest lifetime. Decay into the ground state finally involves a  3MC state. The attachment of cobaloxime to the iron photosensitizer increases the  3MLCT lifetime at the iron center. Together with the directing effect of the linker, this potentially makes the dyad more active in photocatalytic proton reduction experiments than the analogue two&#8208;component system, consisting of the iron photosensitizer and Co(dmgH)2(py)Cl. This work thus sheds new light on the functionality of base metal dyads, important for more efficient and sustainable future proton reduction systems.</dc:description>

This work thus sheds new light on the functionality of base metal dyads, important for more efficient and sustainable future proton reduction systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Intersystem Crossing and Electron Spin Selectivity in Anthracene&#8208;Naphthalimide Compact Electron Donor&#8208;Acceptor Dyads Showing Different Geometry and Electronic Coupling Magnitudes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dependency of the charge transfer and Intersystem crossing on molecular geometry and electronic coupling in electron donor&#8208;acceptor dyads: Efficient spin&#8208;orbit charge transfer intersystem crossing (SOCT&#8208;ISC) was observed in compact electron donor&#8208;acceptor dyads. The electron spin selectivity of the ISC was studied with time&#8208;resolved electron paramagnetic resonance (TREPR) spectra.







Abstract
Anthracene&#8208;naphthalimide (An&#8208;NI) compact electron donor&#8208;acceptor dyads were prepared, in which the orientation and distance between the two subunits were varied by direct connection or with intervening phenyl linker. Efficient intersystem crossing (ISC) and long triplet state lifetime (&#934;&#916;=92&#8201;%, &#964;T=438&#8197;&#956;s) were observed for the directly connected dyads showing a perpendicular geometry (81&#176;). This efficient spin&#8208;orbit charge transfer ISC (SOCT&#8208;ISC) takes 376&#8197;fs, inhibits the direct charge recombination (CR) to ground state (1CT&#8594;S0, takes 3.04&#8197;ns). Interestingly, efficient SOCT&#8208;ISC for dyads with intervening phenyl linker (&#934;&#916;=40&#8201;% in DCM) was also observed, although the electron donor and acceptor adopt almost coplanar geometry (dihedral angle: 15&#176;). Time&#8208;resolved electron paramagnetic resonance (TREPR) spectroscopy shows that the electron spin polarization of the triplet state, i.&#8201;e. the electron spin selectivity of ISC, is highly dependent on the dihedral angle and the linker. For the dyads showing weaker coupling between the donor and acceptors, the charge separation and the intramolecular triplet energy transfer are inhibited at 80&#8197;K (frozen solution), because both the 3An and 3NI states were observed and the ESP are same as compared to the native anthracene and naphthalimide, which unravel their origin. The dyads were used as triplet photosensitizers for triplet&#8722;triplet annihilation upconversion (TTA UC). High UC quantum yield (&#934;UC=12.9&#8201;%) as well as a large anti&#8208;Stokes shift (0.72&#8197;eV) was attained by excitation into the CT absorption band.

         <dc:description>Subnanoparticles (SNPs) with sizes of ~1 nm are attractive for enhancing the catalytic performance of transition metals and their oxides. &#160; Such SNPs are of particular interest as redox&#8208;active catalysts in selective oxidative reactions. &#160; However, the electronic states and oxophilicity of copper oxide SNPs are still a subject of debate in terms of their redox properties during oxidation reactions for hydrocarbons. &#160; In this work,  in situ  X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure  (XAFS) measurements of Cu  28  O  x  SNPs, which were prepared using a dendritic phenylazomethine template, during temperatureprogrammed reduction (TPR) with H  2  achieved lowering of the temperature (  T  50  = 138 &#176;C) reported thus far for the Cu(II) &#8594; Cu(I) reduction reaction because of Cu&#8211;O bond elongation in the ultrasmall copper oxide particles.</dc:description>

         <title>Radiochromic Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks for X&#8208;Ray Detection</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Porous materials have been investigated as efficient photochromic platforms for detecting hazardous radiation, while the utilization of hydrogen bonded&#8208;organic frameworks (HOFs) in this field has remained intact. Herein, two HOFs were synthesized through self&#8208;assembly of tetratopic viologen ligand and formic acid (PFC&#8208;25, PFC&#8208;26), as a new class of &#8220;all&#8208;organic&#8221; radiochromic smart materials, opening a gate for HOFs in this desired field. PFC&#8208;26 is active upon both X&#8208;rays and UV light, while PFC&#8208;25 is only active upon X&#8208;rays. The same building block yet different radiochromic behaviors of PFC&#8208;25 and PFC&#8208;26 allow us to gain a deep mechanistic understanding of the factors that control the detection specificity. Theoretical and experimental studies reveal that the degree of &#960;&#8208;conjugation of viologen ligand is highly related to the threshold energy of triggering a charge transfer, therefore being a vital factor for the particularity of radiochromic materials. Thanks to its convenient processibility, nanoparticle size, and UV silence, PFC&#8208;25 can be further fabricated into a portable naked&#8208;eye sensor for X&#8208;ray detection, which shows obvious color change with the merits of high transmittance contrast, good sensitivity (reproducible dose threshold of 3.5 Gy), and excellent stability. The work exhibits the promising practical potentials of HOF materials in photochromic technology.</dc:description>

         <title>Trifaceted Mickey Mouse Amphiphiles for Programmable Self&#8208;Assembly, DNA Complexation and Organ&#8208;Selective Gene Delivery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Instilling segregated cationic and lipophilic domains with an angular disposition in a trehalose&#8208;based trifaceted macrocyclic scaffold allows engineering patchy molecular nanoparticles leveraging directional interactions that emulate those controlling self&#8208;assembling processes in viral capsids. The resulting trilobular amphiphilic derivatives, featuring a Mickey Mouse architecture, can electrostatically interact with plasmid DNA (pDNA) and further engage in hydrophobic contacts to promote condensation into transfectious nanocomplexes. Notably, the topology and internal structure of the cyclooligosaccharide/pDNA co&#8208;assemblies can be molded by fine&#8208;tuning the valency and characteristics of the cationic and lipophilic patches, which strongly impacts the transfection efficacy  in vitro  and  in vivo  . Outstanding organ selectivities can then be programmed with no need of incorporating a biorecognizable motif in the formulation. The results provide a versatile strategy for the construction of fully synthetic and perfectly monodisperse nonviral gene delivery systems uniquely suited for optimization schemes by making cyclooligosaccharide patchiness the focus.</dc:description>

         <title>Coordination&#8208;Driven Selective Formation of D2 Symmetric Octanuclear Organometallic Cages</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here we describe the coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly of organometallic half&#8208;sandwich iridium(III)&#8208; and rhodium(III)&#8208;based building blocks with asymmetric ambidentate pyridyl&#8208;carboxylate ligands. Despite the potential for obtaining a statistical mixture of multiple products,  D  2  symmetric octanuclear cages were formed selectively by taking advantage of the electronic effects emanating from the two types of chelating sites &#8213; (  O  ,  O&#8242;  ) and (  N  ,  N&#8242;  ) &#8213; on the tetranuclear building blocks. The metal sources and the lengths of bridging ligands show influence on the selectivity of the self&#8208;assembly. Experimental observations, supported by computational studies, suggest that the  D  2  symmetric cages are the thermodynamically favoured products. Overall, the results underline the importance of electronic effects on the selectivity of coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly, and demonstrate that asymmetric ambidentate ligands can be used to control the design of discrete supramolecular coordination complexes.</dc:description>

         <title>Stabilisation of [WVF4]+ by N&#8208; and P&#8208;Donor Ligands: Second&#8208;Order Jahn&#8208;Teller Effects in Octacoordinate d1 Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first isolated examples of cationic fluoridotungsten(V) complexes are reported as octacoordinate [WF  4  (L)  4  ]  +  (L = C  5  H  5  N, P(CH  3  )  3  ). The [WF  4  (NC  5  H  5  )  4  ]  +  cation is synthesised as its [O  3  SCF  3  ]  &#8211;  salt upon reaction of WF  5  (NC  5  H  5  )  2  with [(CH  3  )  3  Si(NC  5  H  5  )][O  3  SCF  3  ] in excess C  5  H  5  N, whereas [WF  4  {P(CH  3  )  3  }  4  ]  +  is accessed directly from WF  6  upon reaction with (CH  3  )  3  SiO  3  SCF  3  and excess P(CH  3  )  3  . These salts were characterised by X&#8208;ray crystallography and Raman spectroscopy in the solid state. New geometry indices for octacoordinate complexes (&#964;  8  and &#964;  8  &#8242;) are introduced, allowing for the facile differentiation of trigonal&#8208;dodecahedral (TD) and square&#8208;antiprismatic (SA) geometries. This has disambiguated the SA geometries of [WF  4  (L)  4  ]  +  and the geometries of a series of previously reported  d  0  and  d  1  MA  4  B  4  complexes. Computational (DFT&#8208;B3LYP) studies of [WF  4  (PH  3  )  4  ]  2+/+  and related model systems demonstrate the occurrence of a second&#8208;order Jahn&#8208;Teller (SOJT) distortion from TD in  d  0  complexes to SA in  d  1  complexes, with the degree of SOJT stabilisation being most significant in 5  d  complexes containing fluorido ligands and monodentate neutral donors.</dc:description>

         <title>Solvent Effects in Halogen and Hydrogen Bonding Mediated Electrochemical Anion Sensing in Aqueous Solution and at Interfaces</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sensing anionic species in competitive aqueous media is a well&#8208;recognised challenge to long&#8208;term applications across a multitude of fields. Herein, we report a comprehensive investigation of the electrochemical anion sensing performance of novel halogen bonding (XB) and hydrogen bonding (HB) bis&#8208;ferrocene&#8208;(iodo)triazole receptors in solution and at self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs), in a range of increasingly competitive aqueous organic solvent media (ACN/H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O). In solution, the XB sensor notably outperforms the HB sensor, with substantial anion recognition induced cathodic voltammetric responses of the ferrocene/ferrocenium redox couple persisting even in highly competitive aqueous solvent media of 20% water content. The response to halides, in particular, shows a markedly lower sensitivity to increasing water content associated with a unique halide selectivity at unprecedented levels of solvent polarity. The HB sensor, in contrast, generally displayed a preference towards oxoanions. A significant surface&#8208;enhancement effect was observed for both XB/HB receptive films in all solvent systems, whereby the HB sensor generally displayed larger responses towards oxoanions than its halogen bonding analogue.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A gold&#8208;catalyzed cycloisomerization of 2&#8208;indolyl&#8208;3&#8208;[(trimethylsilyl)ethynyl)]quinoxalines with concomitant 1,2&#8208;silyl shift gives rise to the formation of 6&#8208;(trimethylsilyl)indolo[3,2&#8208;a]phenazines in moderate to excellent yield. These silylated heterocycles are readily transformed into 6&#8208;aryl&#8208;indolo[3,2&#8208;a]phenazines in moderate to good yield by one&#8208;pot ipso&#8208;iodination&#8208;Suzuki coupling synthesis.

Structure&#8208;property relationships for 6&#8208;aryl&#8208;indolo[3,2&#8208;a]phenazines obtained by Hammett correlations with &#963;p+ substituent parameters indicate that emission maxima, Stokes shifts, and fluorescence quantum yields can be fine&#8208;tuned by the remote para&#8208;aryl substituent. Furthermore, indolo[3,2&#8208;a]phenazines were found to exhibit interesting activities against medically relevant pathogens such as the Apicomplexa parasite Toxoplasma gondii with IC50 up to 0.67 &#177; 0.13 &#181;M. Therefore, these compounds are promising candidates for novel anti&#8208;parasitic therapies.</dc:description>

         <title>Cooperative Ligands in Dissolution of Gold</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Development of new, environmentally benign dissolution methods for metallic gold is driven by needs in the circular economy. Gold is widely used in consumer electronics, but sustainable and selective dissolution methods for Au are scarce. Herein we describe a quantitative dissolution of gold in organic solution under mild conditions using hydrogen peroxide as an oxidant. In the dissolution reaction, two thiol ligands, pyridine&#8208;4&#8208;thiol and 2&#8208;mercaptobenzimidazole, work in a cooperative manner. The mechanistic investigations suggest that two pyridine&#8208;4&#8208;thiol molecules form a complex with Au0 that can be oxidized, while the role of inexpensive 2&#8208;mercaptobenzimidazole is to stabilize the formed AuI species via a ligand exchange process. Under optimized conditions, the reaction proceeds vigorously and gold dissolves quantitatively in an hour. The demonstrated ligand exchange mechanism with two thiols allows us to drastically reduce the thiol consumption and may lead to even more effective gold dissolution methods in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>Comprehensive Characterization of the Self&#8208;folding Cavitand&#160; Dynamics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The conformational equilibria and guest exchange process of a resorcin[4]arene derived self&#8208;folding cavitand receptor have been characterized in detail by molecular dynamics simulations (MD) and  1  H EXSY experiments. A multi&#8208;timescale strategy for exploring the fluxional behaviour of this system has been constructed, exploiting conventional MD and accelerated MD (aMD) techniques. The use of aMD allows the reconstruction of the folding/unfolding process of the receptor by sampling high&#8208;energy barrier processes unattainable by conventional MD simulations. We obtained MD trajectories sampling events occurring at different timescales from ns to s: 1) rearrangement of the directional hydrogen bond seam stabilizing the receptor, 2) folding/unfolding of the structure transiting partially open intermediates, and c) guest departure from different folding stages. Most remarkably, reweighing of the biased aMD simulations provided kinetic barriers that are in very good agreement with those determined experimentally by  1  H NMR. These results constitute the first comprehensive characterization of the complex dynamic features of cavitand receptors. Our approach emerges as a valuable rational design tool for synthetic host&#8208;guest systems</dc:description>

         <title>A Rapid and Mild Sulfation Strategy Reveals Conformational Preferences in Therapeutically Relevant Sulfated Xylooligosaccharides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although sulfated xylooligosaccharides are promising therapeutic leads for a multitude of afflictions, the structural complexity and heterogeneity of commercially deployed forms (e.g. Pentosan polysulfate&#160;1) complicates their path to further clinical development. We describe herein the preparation of the largest homogeneous persulfated xylooligomers prepared to date&#8212;comprising up to eight xylose residues&#8212;as homogeneous standards for biological studies. Near quantitative sulfation was accomplished using a remarkably mild and operationally simple protocol which avoids the need for high temperatures and a large excess of the sulfating reagent. Moreover, the sulfated xylooligomer standards so obtained enabled definitive identification of a pyridinium contaminant in a sample of a commercially prepared Pentosan drug and provided significant insights into the conformational preferences of the constituent persulfated monosaccharide residues. As the spatial&#160;distribution of sulfates is a key determinant of the binding of sulfated oligosaccharides to endogenous targets, these findings have broad implications for the advancement of Pentosan&#8208;based treatments.</dc:description>

         <title>Selectivity in Ligand Functionalization of Photocatalytic Metal Oxide Nanoparticles for Phase Transfer and Self&#8208;Assembly Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Functionalization of photocatalytic metal oxide nanoparticles of TiO  2  , ZnO, WO  3  and CuO with amine&#8208;terminated (oleylamine) and thiol&#8208;terminated (1&#8208;dodecanethiol) alkyl chained ligands was studied under ambient conditions. A high selectivity was observed in the binding specificity of a ligand towards nanoparticles of these different oxides. It was observed that oleylamine binds stably to only TiO  2  and WO  3  , while 1&#8208;dodecanethiol binds stably only to ZnO and CuO. Similarly, polar to non&#8208;polar solvent phase transfer of TiO  2  and WO  3  nanoparticles could be achieved by using oleylamine, but not by 1&#8208;dodecanethiol, while the contrary holds for ZnO and CuO. The surface chemistry of ligand functionalized nanoparticles was probed by ATR&#8208;FTIR spectroscopy, that enabled to elucidate the occupation of the ligands at the active sites. The photo&#8208;stability of the ligands on the nanoparticle surface was determined by the photocatalytic self&#8208;cleaning properties of the material. While TiO  2  and WO  3  degrade the ligands within 24 hours under both UV and visible light, ligands on ZnO and CuO remain unaffected. The gathered insights are also highly relevant from an application point of view. As an example, since the ligand functionalized nanoparticles are hydrophobic in nature, they can thus be self&#8208;assembled at the air&#8208;water interface, for obtaining nanoparticle films with demonstrated photocatalytic as well as anti&#8208;fogging properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Probing Multiconfigurational States by Spectroscopy: The Cerium XAS L3&#8208;edge Puzzle</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#8220;Many studies on cerium compounds relate back to CeO2 and Ce(C8H8)2 when it comes to assigning the metal oxidation state and other ground&#8208;state wavefunction characteristics. It was therefore very important to establish, from first principles, how the ground states and the core&#8208;excited states in the different peaks exactly relate to each other. The Ce L3 edges in CeO2 and Ce(C8H8)2 have never been calculated without prior assumptions about the excited states or within an ab initio formalism that considers explicitly the differential wavefunction relaxation of the ground&#8208;states and the core&#8208;excited states.

Abstract
Invited for the cover of this issue are Prof. Jochen Autschbach and Dr. Dumitru&#8208;Claudiu Sergentu of State University of New York at Buffalo, and Dr. Corwin H. Booth of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. The image depicts high&#8208;energy X&#8208;ray beams as lightnings probing Ce at the L3 edge in the iconic covalent&#8208;bonded Ce(C8H8)2 and in CeO2. The mountain peaks in the background represent the double&#8208;peaked L3 edges. The peaks turn out to be intuitively interpreted in terms of localized orbitals and hence metal oxidation states.

         <title>Modular Toolkit of Multifunctional Block Copoly(2&#8208;oxazoline)s for the Synthesis of Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Post&#8208;polymerization modification provides an elegant way to introduce chemical functionalities onto macromolecules to produce tailor&#8208;made materials with superior properties. We have adapted this concept to well&#8208;defined block copolymers of the poly(2&#8208;oxazoline) family and demonstrate the large potential of these macromolecules as universal toolkit for numerous applications. Triblock copolymers with separated water&#8208;soluble, alkyne&#8208; and alkene&#8208;containing segments were synthesized and orthogonally modified with various low&#8208;molecular weight functional molecules by copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) and thiol&#8208;ene (TE) click reactions, respectively. Representative toolkit polymers were used for the synthesis of gold, iron oxide and silica nanoparticles.</dc:description>

         <title>The Development of Non&#8208;Hydrolysable Oligosaccharide Activity&#8208;Based Inactivators for Endoglycanases: A Case Study on&#160;a&#8208;1,6 Mannanases</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>There is a vast genomic resource for enzymes active on carbohydrates. Lagging far behind, however, are functional chemical tools for the rapid characterization of carbohydrate&#8208;active enzymes. Activity&#8208;based probes (ABPs) offer one chemical solution to these issues with ABPs based upon cyclophellitol epoxide and aziridine covalent and irreversible inhibitors representing a potent and widespread approach. Such inhibitors for enzymes active on polysaccharides are potentially limited by the requirement for several glycosidic bonds, themselves substrates for the enzyme targets. Here we show that non&#8208;hydrolysable trisaccharide can be synthesized and applied even to enzymes with challenging subsite requirements. We find that incorporation of carbasugar moieties, which we accomplished by cuprate&#8208;assisted regioselective trans&#8208;diaxial epoxide opening of carba&#8208;mannal we synthesised for this purpose, yields inactivators that act as powerful activity&#8208;based inhibitors for&#160;a&#8208;1,6&#160;endo&#8208;mannanases. 3&#8208;D structures at 1.35 &#8211; 1.47&#160;&#197;&#160;resolutions confirm the design rationale and binding to the enzymatic nucleophile. Carbasugar oligosaccharide cyclophellitols offer a powerful new approach for the design of robust endoglycosidase inhibitors, while the synthesis procedures presented here should allow adaptation towards activity&#8208;based endoglycosidase probes as well as configurational isosteres targeting other endoglycosidase families.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper(II) Pyridyl Amino&#8208;Phenolates: Hypoxia&#8208;Selective, Nucleus Targeting Cytotoxins, and Magnetic Resonance Probes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Targeting of low&#8208;oxygen (hypoxic) environments found in many tumors using redox&#8208;active metal complexes is a strategy that can enhance efficacy and reduce side effects of chemotherapies. We have developed a series of Cu(II) complexes with tridentate pyridine aminophenolate&#8208;based ligands for preferential activation in the reduction window provided by hypoxic tissues. Furthermore, ligand functionalization with a CF3&#160;pendant group provides a 19F spectroscopic handle for magnetic resonance studies of redox processes at the metal centre and behaviour in cellular environments. The phenol group in the ligand backbone was substituted at the para&#8208;position with H, Cl, and NO2  &#160;&#160;  to modulate the reduction potential of the Cu(II) centre, giving a range of values below the window expected for hypoxic tissues. The NO2&#160;substituted complex, which has the highest reduction potential, showed enhanced cytotoxic selectivity towards HeLa cells grown in hypoxic conditions. Cell death occurs via apoptosis, as determined by cell morphology analysis. A combination of 19F NMR and ICP&#8208;OES indicates localization of the NO2&#160;complex in HeLa cell nuclei and increased cellular accumulation under hypoxia. This correlates with DNA nuclease activity being the likely origin of cytotoxic activity, as demonstrated by cleavage of DNA plasmids in the presence of the Cu(II) nitro complex and a reducing agent. Selective detection of the paramagnetic Cu(II) complexes and their diamagnetic ligands through 19F MRI suggests hypoxia targeting theranostic applications via redox activation.</dc:description>

         <title>In&#8208;situ Synthesis of N, O, P&#8208;doped Hierarchical Porous Carbon from Poly&#8208;bis(phenoxy)phosphazene for Polysulfide&#8208;Trapping Interlayer in Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The shuttling of polysulfides is the most detrimental problem that degrades the capacity and cycle stability of lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries. Adding a carbon interlayer is feasible to prevent the polysulfides from migration, and a rational design of the structures and surface properties of the carbon layer is the essential enabler to increasing its effectiveness. Here, we report a hierarchical porous carbon (HPC) via carbonization of  bis(phenoxy)phosphazene  and in&#8208;situ doping of triple heteroatoms into the carbon lattice for fabricating an effective polysulfide&#8208;trapping interlayer. The generated carbon integrates the advantages of the hierarchical porous structure, high specific area and rich dopants (N, O and P), yielding chemisorption and physical confinement for polysulfides  and fast ion&#8208;transport synergistically  . The HPC interlayer significantly improves the electrochemical performance of Li&#8208;S batteries, including  an exceptional discharge capacity  of  1509 mA h/g at 0.06C  and a high capacity retention of 83.7% after 250 cycles at 0.3C  . This work proposes a facile in&#8208;situ synthesis of heteroatom&#8208;doped carbon with rational porous structures for suppressing the shuttle effect.</dc:description>

         <title>A Look at the Synthetic Methodologies of Photoluminescent Nanoparticulate Carbon Quantum Dots and Corresponding Photophysical Properties1</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A number of synthetic methodologies and applications of carbon quantum dots (CQDs) have been reported since they were first discovered nearly two decades ago. Unlike metal&#8208;based or semiconductor&#8208;based (e.g., metal chalcogenides) quantum dots (MSQDs), CQDs have the unique feature of being prepared through a variety of synthetic protocols, which are typically understood from considerations of reaction models and photoluminescence mechanisms. Consequently, this brief review article describes quantum dots, in general, and CQDs, in particular, from various viewpoints: (i) their definition, (ii) their photophysical properties, and (iii) the superiority of CQDs over MSQDs. Where possible, comparisons are made between CQDs and MSQDs. First, however, the review begins with a general brief description of quantum dots (QDs) as nanomaterials (sizes &#8804; 10 nm), followed by a short description of MSQDs and CQDs. Described subsequently are the various top&#8208;down and bottom&#8208;up approaches to synthesize CQDs followed by their distinctive photophysical properties (emission spectra; quantum yields, &#934;s).</dc:description>

         <title>An In&#8208;situ Self&#8208;regeneration Catalyst for the Production of Renewable 1,3&#8208;pentadiene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catalyst deactivation is a problem of great concern for many heterogeneous reactions. Here, an urchin&#8208;like LaPO4 catalyst was facile developed for 2,3&#8208;pentanediol dehydration, it features an impressive ability to restore the activity in situ by itself during the reaction, accounting for its high stability. This facilitates the efficient production of renewable 1,3&#8208;pentadiene from 2,3&#8208;pentanedione via a novel approach, where 2,3&#8208;pentanediol was obtained as an intermediate in 95% yield under mild conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Axial Ligand Coordination Tuning of Electrocatalytic Activity of Iron Porphyrin Electrografted on Carbon Nanotubes for Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is essential in many life processes and energy conversion systems. Inspired by enzymatic oxygen activation/reduction processes, it is desirable to design transition metal molecular catalysts as an alternative to noble&#8208;metal&#8208;Pt&#8208;based ORR electrocatalysts in view point of fuel cell commercialization. Herein, we fabricate bio&#8208;inspired molecular catalysts electrografted on multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), where iron porphyrin FeF  20  TPP&#160; is coordinated with covalently electrografted axial ligand on the MWCNTs&#8217; surface varying from thiophene to imidazole. With the change of axial coordination environment, the catalysts&#8217; electrocatalytic activity varied accordingly, and the imidazole coordinated catalyst MWCNTs&#8208;Im&#8208;FeF  20  TPP exhibited the highest ORR activity among the prepared catalysts. When MWCNTs&#8208;Im&#8208;FeF  20  TPP was loaded on the cathode of a zinc&#8211;air battery assembly, open&#8208;cell voltage (OCV) of 1.35 V and the maximum power density (  P  max  ) of 110 mW cm  &#8722;2  were achieved, which was higher than those of MWCNTs&#8208;Thi&#8208;FeF  20  TPP (OCV = 1.30 V,  P  max  = 100 mW cm  &#8722;2  ) and MWCNTs&#8208;Ox&#8208;FeF  20  TPP (OCV = 1.28 V,  P  max  = 86 mW cm  &#8722;2  ) and comparable with that loaded with a Pt/C catalyst (OCV = 1.45 V,  P  max  = 120 mW cm  &#8722;2  ) under similar experimental conditions. This study provides a time&#8208;saving method to prepare covalently immobilized molecular electrocatalysts on carbon&#8208;based materials with structure&#8211;performance correlation, which is also applicable to the design of other electrografted catalysts for energy conversion.</dc:description>

         <title>Breaking the Passivation: Sodium Borohydride Synthesis by Reacting Hydrated Borax with Aluminium</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A significant obstacle in the large&#8208;scale applications of sodium borohydride (NaBH4) for hydrogen storage is its high cost. Herein, we report a new method to synthesize NaBH4  by ball milling hydrated sodium tetraborate (Na2B4O7&#183;10H2O) with low&#8208;cost Al or Al88Si12, instead of Na, Mg or Ca. An effective strategy is developed to facilitate mass transfer during the reaction by introducing NaH to enable the formation of NaAlO2  instead of dense Al2O3  on Al surface, and by using Si as a milling additive to prevent agglomeration and also break up passivation layers. Another advantage of this process is that hydrogen in Na2B4O7&#183;10H2O serves as a hydrogen source for NaBH4  generation. Considering the low cost of the starting materials and simplicity in operation, our studies demonstrate the potential of producing NaBH4  in a more economical way than the commercial process.</dc:description>

         <title>Quantitative Structure&#8211;Property Relationship Modelling for the Prediction of Singlet Oxygen Generation by Heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free BODIPY Photosensitizers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free sensitizers forming long&#8208;living triplet excited states  via  the spin&#8208;orbit charge transfer intersystem crossing (SOCT&#8208;ISC) process have potential to replace transition metal complexes in photonic applications. The efficiency of SOCT&#8208;ISC in BODIPY donor&#8208;acceptor dyads can be tuned by structural modification. Predicting the triplet state yields and reactive oxygen species generation quantum yields in a particular solvent is challenging due to a lack of quantitative structure&#8208;property relationship (QSPR) models. We analyzed data on  1  O  2  generation quantum yields (&#934;  &#916;  ) for &gt;70 heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free BODIPY in toluene, acetonitrile, and THF. To build reliable QSPR models, we synthesized new BODIPYs containing different electron donating groups, studied their optical and structural properties and the solvent dependence of  1 O2  , which confirmed the formation of triplet states via SOCT&#8208;ISC. More than 5000 quantum&#8208;chemical descriptors were calculated including descriptors using DFT, namely M06&#8208;2X functional. QSPR models predicting &#934;&#916; values were developed using multiple linear regression (MLR), which perform significantly better than other machine learning methods and show sufficient statistical parameters (R = 0.88 &#822; 0.91 and q  2  = 0.62 &#822; 0.69) for all three solvents. A small root mean squared error of 8.2% was obtained for &#934;&#916;  values predicted using MLR model in toluene. QSPR and machine learning techniques can be useful for predicting &#934;&#916; values in different media and virtual screening of new heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free BODIPYs with improved photosensitizing ability.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;supporting Atmosphere Assisted Synthesis of 1D Mo2C&#8208;based Catalyst for Efficient Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>One&#8208;dimensional (1D) materials exhibit fascinating properties in electrocatalytic applications but their fabrication faces the challenge of tedious and complicated operations. Herein, we develop a bottom&#8208;up strategy to construct 1D metal carbide catalyst (Mo2C@NC) consisting of ultrafine Mo2C nanoparticles embedded within nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon layers via simply calcining a mixture of ammonium molybdate, urea and melamine. Experimental results and thermodynamic calculations demonstrate the retainable pyrolysis&#8208;generated self&#8208;supporting atmosphere plays a crucial role in the crystalline phase and morphology of materials. When functioned as an electrocatalyst for HER, the achieved Mo2C@NC presents an excellent catalytic activity as well as outstanding stability. This work may shed fresh light into the facile synthesis of effective HER catalysts with 1D nanostructure.</dc:description>

         <title>Take your Positions and Shine: Effects of Positioning Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission Luminophores within Sequence&#8208;Defined Macromolecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A luminophore with aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) is employed for the conjugation onto supramolecular ligands in order to allow for detection of ligand binding. Supramolecular ligands are based on the combination of sequence&#8208;defined oligo(amidoamine) scaffolds and guanidiniocarbonyl&#8208;pyrrole (GCP) as binding motif. We hypothesize that AIE properties are strongly affected by positioning of the luminophore within the ligand scaffold. Therefore, we systematically investigate the effects placing the AIE luminophore at different positions within the overall construct, e.g. in the main or side chain of the olig(amidoamine). Indeed, we can show that the position within the ligand structure strongly affects AIE, both for the ligand itself as well as when applying the ligand for the detection of different biological and synthetic polyanions.</dc:description>

         <title>CoOx@Co&#8208;NC Catalyst with Dual Active Centers for Enhanced Oxygen Evolution: Breaking Trade&#8208;off of Particle Size and Metal Loading</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Increasing the metal loading and downsizing the metal particle size are two effective ways to boost the electrochemical performance of catalysts. However, it is difficult to simultaneously increase the metal loading and reduce the particle size since isolated individual atoms are easy to aggregate into nanoparticles when increasing the metal loading. To tackle this contradiction, we report a bottom&#8208;up ligand&#8208;mediated strategy to facilely prepare ultrafine CoO  x  &#160;nanoclusters anchored on a Co&#8208;N&#8208;containing carbon matrix (CoO  x  @Co&#8208;NC). The co&#8208;exist of N and O atoms prevent Co atoms agglomerating into large particles and allowing the formation of ultrafine dispersed Co species with large Co loading (up to 20 wt.%). Since the relationship between ultrasmall size and large metal loading is well balanced, the CoO  x  nanoclusters have no inhibitory effect, but facilitate the catalytic performance of Co&#8208;N  4  sites during OER process. Consequently, due to the synergistic effect of ultrafine CoO  x  nanoclusters and Co&#8208;N  4  &#160;macrocycles, the as&#8208;synthesized CoO  x  @Co&#8208;NC exhibit promising OER activity (&#951;  10  =370 mV, Tafel plot=40 mV/dec), bettering than that of benchmark RuO  2  &#160;(&#951;  10  =411 mV, Tafel plot=72 mV/dec). This ligand&#8208;mediated strategy to synthesize carbonaceous materials containing dual active centers with large metal loading is promising for developing active and stable catalysts for electrocatalytic applications.</dc:description>

This ligand&#8208;mediated strategy to synthesize carbonaceous materials containing dual active centers with large metal loading is promising for developing active and stable catalysts for electrocatalytic applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

The interplay between the quantum theory of atoms in molecules and the local potentials that appear in the Euler equation for electron density as well as the corresponding electronic inner&#8208;crystal forces of electrostatic and kinetic origin is explored. Novel physically grounded bonding descriptors derived within the orbital&#8208;free quantum crystallography provide the detailed examination of C=O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; and &#960;&#8208;stacking interactions and nonclassical hydrogen bonds.







Abstract
A detailed analysis of a complete set of the local potentials that appear in the Euler equation for electron density is carried out for noncovalent interactions in the crystal of a uracil derivative using experimental X&#8208;ray charge density. The interplay between the quantum theory of atoms in molecules and crystals and the local potentials and corresponding inner&#8208;crystal electronic forces of electrostatic and kinetic origin is explored. Partitioning of crystal space into atomic basins and atomic&#8208;like potential basins led us to the definite description of interatomic interaction and charge transfer. Novel physically grounded bonding descriptors derived within the orbital&#8208;free quantum crystallography provided the detailed examination of &#960;&#8208;stacking and intricate C=O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions and nonclassical hydrogen bonds present in the crystal. The donor&#8208;acceptor character of these interactions is revealed by analysis of Pauli and von Weizs&#228;cker potentials together with well&#8208;known functions, e.&#8201;g., deformation electron density and electron localization function. In this way, our analysis throws light on aspects of these closed&#8208;shell interactions hitherto hidden from the description.

         <title>Reactions of C60 with Pyridazine and Phthalazine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The benzoannulation of pyridazine changes its electronic structure drastically, thus rendering the pericyclic reaction with C60 efficient. Theoretical calculations suggested that the reaction proceeds with normal electron demand in contrast to hitherto considered inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand pathway. Therefore, the enhanced reactivity could be explained by the better interaction between the LUMO of C60 and the HOMO of phthalazine.







Abstract
Cage&#8208;opened bisfulleroids are one of suitable building blocks for making a large hole on fullerenes. This work focuses on the Diels&#8208;Alder reaction of C60 with azines, among synthetic methods developed thus far, to provide bisfulleroids. Surprisingly, the computational study predicted that the reaction proceeds with normal electron demand in contrast to hitherto considered inverse&#8208;electron&#8208;demand pathway. The benzoannulation to the pyridazine ring, i.&#8201;e., phthalazine, resulted in the remarkably shortened reaction time due to the better interaction between the HOMO of phthalazine and the LUMO of C60 as well as stronger 2,3&#8208;diaza&#8208;1,3&#8208;butadiene character in the phthalazine as confirmed crystallographically. Contrary to expectations, the benzobisfulleroid was converted into corresponding orifice&#8208;enlarged derivative via the photooxygenation slightly faster than the fulleroid derived from pyridazine.

         <title>High&#8208;pressure Nucleation of Low&#8208;Density Polymorphs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Low&#8208;density polymorphs obtained in a high&#8208;pressure environment are reported in this work. The single crystals were grown by the kinetic crystallization of the seeds precipitated in high&#8208;entropy conditions, owing to the extreme temperature and pressure in the confined space. This simple and inexpensive method opens a colorful palette of polymorphic forms inaccessible with traditional methods. More information can be found in the Full Paper by A.&#8197;Katrusiak et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202005121).

         <dc:description>
The puzzling two&#8208;peaked X&#8208;ray absorption structure at the Ce L3 edge provides a wealth of information about the electronic structure of Ce complexes, such as the Ce 4f occupation and oxidation state and the extent of metal&#8208;ligand covalency. Multiconfigurational wavefunction calculations of the Ce L3 edges in CeO2 and Ce(C8H8)2, reveal the identity of the two&#8208;peaked edge structures and connection with the configurational admixture of the spectroscopically probed electronic states.

         <dc:description>
A redox&#8208;active chiral near&#8208;infrared circularly polarized luminescent field&#8208;induced single&#8208;molecule magnet of YbIII at the solid&#8208;state was designed from the bridging of two Yb(facam)3 units with the bis(1,10&#8208;phenantro[5,6b])tetrathiafulvalene triad.







Abstract
A field&#8208;induced chiral YbIII Single&#8208;Molecule Magnet (SMM) displayed an unprecedented near&#8208;infrared circularly polarized luminescence (NIR&#8208;CPL) in the solid&#8208;state. The bridging bis(1,10&#8208;phenantro[5,6b])tetrathiafulvalene triad (L) allowed an efficient sensitization of the NIR 2F5/2&#8594;2F7/2 emission while the NIR&#8208;CPL is associated to the f&#8208;f transitions of the YbIII ion bearing chiral &#946;&#8208;diketonate derived&#8208;camphorate ancillary ligands.

         <title>Synthesis of Uniform Gold Nanorods with Large Width to Realize Ultralow SERS Detection</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;quality gold nanorods (Au NRs) with width ranging from 6.5&#8197;nm to 175&#8197;nm were successfully synthesized by introducing heptanol molecules during cetyltrimethylammonium bromide&#8208;templated, seeded growth method. The array of vertically aligned Au NRs as SERS substrates can achieve the ultralow limit of detection (LOD) (10&#8722;16&#8197;M for CV probes) with good reliability and reproducibility. Thanks to their LOD, they can be used for rapid detection and identification of residual harmful substances with an ultralow concentration.







Abstract
In this work, we successfully demonstrate high&#8208;yield synthesis of high&#8208;quality gold nanorods (Au NRs) with width ranging from 6.5&#8197;nm to 175&#8197;nm by introducing heptanol molecules as secondary templating agents during cetyltrimethylammonium bromide&#8208;templated, seeded growth method. The results show that an appropriate concentration of heptanol molecules not only alter the micellization behavior of CTAB in water, but also help silver ions impact the symmetry&#8208;breaking efficiency of additional Au&#8722;NP seeds in addition to enhancing the utilization of gold precursors. Moreover, the generality and versatility of the present strategy for synthesis of Au NRs with flexible controlled dimensions are further demonstrated by successful synthesis of Au NRs with the assistance of other fatty alcohols with properly long alkyl chains. Furthermore, when arrays of vertically aligned Au NRs with large width (AVA&#8722;Au120&#215;90 NRs) are used as SERS substrates, they can achieve the ultralow limit of detection for crystal violet (10&#8722;16&#8197;M) with good reliability and reproducibility, and the rapid detection and identification of residual harmful substances.

         <title>Structural Effects of Incorporation of 2'&#8208;Deoxy&#8208;2'2'&#8208;Difluorodeoxycytidine (Gemcitabine) in A&#8208; and B&#8208;Form Duplexes</title>

         <dc:description>
2'&#8208;Deoxy&#8208;2',2'&#8208;difluorocytidine (gemcitabine) is an adaptable nucleotide derivative that can adopt a North type sugar conformation when inserted in pure DNA (B&#8208;form helix), or a South sugar conformation in the context of DNA&#8201;:&#8201;RNA hybrids (A&#8208;form helix).







Abstract
We report the structural effect of 2'&#8208;deoxy&#8208;2',2'&#8208;difluorocytidine (dFdC) insertions in the DNA strand of a DNA&#8201;:&#8201;RNA hybrid duplex and in a self&#8208;complementary DNA&#8201;:&#8201;DNA duplex. In both cases, the modification slightly destabilizes the duplex and provokes minor local distortions that are more pronounced in the case of the DNA&#8201;:&#8201;RNA hybrid. Analysis of the solution structures determined by NMR methods show that dFdC is an adaptable derivative that adopts North type sugar conformation when inserted in pure DNA, or a South sugar conformation in the context of DNA&#8201;:&#8201;RNA hybrids. In this latter context, South sugar pucker favors the formation of a 2'F&#8901;&#8901;H8 attractive interaction with a neighboring purine, which compensates the destabilizing effect of base pair distortions. These interactions share some features with pseudohydrogen bonds described previously in other nucleic acids structures with fluorine modified sugars.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A copper&#8208;catalyzed regio&#8208; and anti&#8208;selective addition of silylboronates to unsymmetric internal alkynes has been developed for the synthesis of structurally defined tetrasubstituted alkenes. A variety of unactivated alkynes can be employed with high selectivity under simple and mild conditions and the resulting products have been further functionalized by utilizing silyl and boryl groups on the alkene.

As a new and complementary method for the synthesis of structurally defined tetrasubstituted alkenes, a copper&#8208;catalyzed regio&#8208; and anti&#8208;selective addition of silylboronates to unsymmetric internal alkynes has been developed.

         <title>Accelerating H2 Evolution by Anodic Semi&#8208;dehydrogenation of Tetrahydroisoquinolines in Water over Co3O4 Nanoribbon Arrays Decorated Nickel Foam</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Semi&#8208;dehydrogenation conversion based on a cobalt electrocatalyst was employed to accelerate hydrogen evolution in water. The Co3O4 nanoribbon arrays modified nickel foam anode provided rich active sites for the transformation of tetrahydroisoquinolines into various value&#8208;added dihydroisoquinolines. Electro&#8208;activated higher&#8208;valent cobalt and plenty of surface oxygen species were responsible for promoting the electrocatalytic oxidation.







Abstract
Coupling the H2 evolution reaction in water with thermodynamically favorable organic oxidation reactions is highly desirable, because it can enhance the energy conversion efficiency compared with electrocatalytic water splitting, and produce value&#8208;added chemicals instead of O2 in the anodic reaction. Herein, Co3O4 nanoribbon arrays in&#8197;situ grown on nickel foam (Co3O4@NF) was employed as an effective electrocatalyst for the selective oxidation of tetrahydroisoquinolines (THIQs). Various value&#8208;added semi&#8208;dehydrogenation products including dihydroisoquinolines with electro&#8208;deficient or &#8208;rich groups could be obtained with moderate yields and faradaic efficiencies. Benefitting from the rich surface active sites of Co3O4@NF, a two&#8208;electrode (Co3O4@NF||Pt) electrolytic system drove a benchmark current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at a cell voltage as low as 1.446&#8197;V in 1.0&#8197;M KOH aqueous solution containing 0.02&#8197;M THIQ, which was reduced by 174&#8197;mV in comparison with that of overall water splitting.

Various value&#8208;added semi&#8208;dehydrogenation products including dihydroisoquinolines with electro&#8208;deficient or &#8208;rich groups could be obtained with moderate yields and faradaic efficiencies. Benefitting from the rich surface active sites of Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;@NF, a two&#8208;electrode (Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;@NF||Pt) electrolytic system drove a benchmark current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at a cell voltage as low as 1.446&#8197;V in 1.0&#8197;M KOH aqueous solution containing 0.02&#8197;M THIQ, which was reduced by 174&#8197;mV in comparison with that of overall water splitting.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Synthesis, Structure, and Chiroptical Properties of Indolo&#8208; and Pyridopyrrolo&#8208;Carbazole&#8208;Based C2&#8208;Symmetric Azahelicenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Azahelicenes bearing an indolocarbazole backbone were prepared by a step&#8208;economic double dehydrogenative cyclization under palladium catalysis. Their optical resolutions were attained by chiral HPLC. The pyridopyrrolo derivative (X=N, R=H) was found to show ca. 6 times larger dissymmetry factors than those of the parent azahelicene (X=CH, R=H) in both CD and CPL measurements. The CPL color could be switched by addition of an acid or introduction of a donor substituent R.







Abstract
Treatment of 11,12&#8208;bis(1,1&#8217;&#8208;biphenyl&#8208;3&#8208;yl or 6&#8208;phenylpyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;substituted 11,12&#8208;dihydro&#8208;indolo[2,3&#8208;a]carbazole with an oxidizing system of Pd(II)/Ag(I) induced effective double dehydrogenative cyclization to afford the corresponding &#960;&#8208;extended azahelicenes. The optical resolutions were readily achieved by a preparative chiral HPLC. It was found that the pyridopyrrolo&#8208;carbazole&#8208;based azahelicene that contains four nitrogen atoms exhibits ca. 6 times larger dissymmetry factors both in circularly dichroism (CD) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL), |gCD| and |gCPL| values being 1.1&#215;10&#8722;2 and 4.4&#215;10&#8722;3, respectively, as compared with the parent indolocarbazole&#8208;based azahelicene. Theoretical calculations at the RI&#8208;CC2 level were employed to rationalize the observed enhanced chiroptical responses. The (chir)optical properties of the former helicene was further tuned by a protonation leading to remarkable red&#8208;shift with a considerable enhancement of the |gCPL| value.

         <title>Iridoid Sex Pheromone Biosynthesis in Aphids Mimics Iridoid&#8208;Producing Plants</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Natural product biosynthesis in animals: Chemical synthesis of isotopically&#8208;labelled molecular probes and topical application using female pea aphids, Acyrthosiphon pisum, are deployed along with coupled GC&#8208;mass spectrometry (GC&#8208;MS) to show that biosynthesis of the female&#8208;produced aphid sex pheromone components (1R,4aS,7S,7aR)&#8208;nepetalactol (1) and (4aS,7S,7aR)&#8208;nepetalactone (2) may follow a broadly similar route to that characterized for plants.







Abstract
Biosynthesis of (1R,4aS,7S,7aR)&#8208;nepetalactol (1) and (4aS,7S,7aR)&#8208;nepetalactone (2) in plants involves iridoid synthase (ISY), an atypical reductive cyclase that catalyses the reduction of 8&#8208;oxogeranial into the reactive enol of (S)&#8208;8&#8208;oxocitronellal, and cyclization of this enol intermediate, either non&#8208;enzymatically or by a nepetalactol&#8208;related short chain dehydrogenase enzyme (NEPS) that yields the nepetalactols. In this study, we investigated the biosynthesis in&#8197;vivo of 1 and 2 in the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum, using a library of isotopically&#8208;labelled monoterpenoids as molecular probes. Topical application of deuterium&#8208;labelled probes synthesized from geraniol and nerol resulted in production of 2H4&#8722;lactol 1 and 2H4&#8722;lactone 2. However, deuterium incorporation was not evident using labelled probes synthesized from (S)&#8208;citronellol. These results suggest that iridoid biosynthesis in animals, specifically aphids, may follow a broadly similar route to that characterised for plants.

         <title>Reactions on a 1,2&#8208;Dicarbonyl Moiety of a Fullerene Skeleton</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chemical transformation of a 1,2&#8208;dicarbonyl moiety embedded in a cage&#8208;opened fullerene C60 derivative was examined to produce &#946;&#8208;oxo&#8208;phosphorus ylide, &#945;&#8208;methylene carbonyl, and acid anhydride compounds. The former two showed a significantly supressed encapsulation/escape dynamics of a water molecule as well as electrochemical properties largely different from the last one.







Abstract
A 1,2&#8208;dicarbonyl moiety on a cage&#8208;opened fullerene skeleton is one of suitable building blocks for the further derivatization. Herein, we discuss the chemical transformation of a 1,2&#8208;dicarbonyl compound into &#946;&#8208;oxo&#8208;phosphorus ylide, acid anhydride, and &#945;&#8208;methylene carbonyl derivatives. Despite possessing a sterically small methylene unit in the last one, the release of an encapsulated water molecule was significantly supressed whereas the &#946;&#8208;oxo&#8208;phosphorus ylide bearing three bulky p&#8208;tolyl groups on the P&#8208;atom enabled the faster insertion/release dynamics, implying the flexibility of the phosphonium substituent. The replacement of the carbonyl group with phosphorus ylide and methylene units largely varied electrochemical properties of the fullerene skeleton, likely arising from the anionic charge delocalized over the entire molecule and removal of an electron&#8208;withdrawable carbonyl group, respectively.

         <dc:description>
Multicomponent dynagels for heparin encapsulation: Dynamic covalently cross&#8208;linked dynamers with high mechanical strength, biocompatibility and self&#8208;healing behaviors have been used for biomedical applications.







Abstract
Double cross&#8208;linked dynamic hydrogels, dynagels, have been prepared through reversible imine bonds and supramolecular interactions, which showed good pH responsiveness, injectability, self&#8208;healing property and biocompatibility. With the further encapsulation of heparin, the obtained hydrogels exhibited good anti&#8208;bacterial activity and promotion effects for 3D cell culture.

         <title>On the Structural Assignments Underlying R.&#8197;B. Woodward's Most Personal Data That Led to the Woodward&#8211;Hoffmann Rules: Subramania Ranganathan's Key Role and Related Research by E.&#8197;J. Corey and A.&#8197;G. Hortmann</title>

In 1963 and early 1964, R. B. Woodward and his postdoctoral student Subramania Ranganathan discovered a route&#8208;ending glitch in the isoxazole route to vitamin B12. However, they simultaneously discovered two coupled pairs of stereospecific valence isomerizations that became Woodward's 5th mysterious reaction and led to the Woodward&#8211;Hoffmann rules. This Essay discusses the behind&#8208;the&#8208;scenes story of Ranganathan's research and confirms his structure determinations using quantum chemical calculations of 1H&#8197;NMR parameters.







Abstract
In the early 1960s, as part of R. B. Woodward's isoxazole route to vitamin B12, Subramania Ranganathan uncovered two coupled sets of stereospecific reactions, a thermal set and a photochemical set. These four reactions illustrated the alternating configurations that were the major data points that prompted the solution of the no&#8208;mechanism problem. Though Ranganathan's reactions played a major role, according to Woodward, in the development of the Woodward&#8211;Hoffmann rules, they were published only as part of the documentation of a lecture given by Woodward in 1966. The authors of this paper have uncovered Subramania Ranganathan's 1964 postdoctoral report and have used modern quantum chemical theory to predict the 1H&#8197;NMR spectra for Ranganathan's key compounds, providing support for the structure assignments made by Woodward and Ranganathan. A similar set of alternating, stereospecific reactions was observed by E.&#8197;J. Corey and Alfred Hortmann in their 1963 total synthesis of dihydrocostunolide. We also have applied the computational process used for Ranganathan's compounds to Hortmann's compounds, now also including the calculation of coupling constants, and find computational support for Corey and Hortmann's structure assignments.

         <title>Synthesis of Desepoxy&#8208;Tedanolide C</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The total synthesis of one isomer of the marine natural product tedanolide C was accomplished and provides evidence about the relative configuration of this member of the tedanolide family. The synthesis takes advantage of a variant of the Kiyooka aldol protocol for the stereoselective synthesis of the tertiary alcohol flanked by three additional oxygenated carbon atoms. The synthesis was particularly sensitive to the appropriate selection of protecting groups, which made constant protecting group switches necessary. The spectroscopic data of the synthesized isomer support a different configuration than the originally proposed one.







Abstract
The synthesis of desepoxy&#8208;tedanolide C was accomplished and provided experimental evidence on the configuration of tedanolide C. The reported chemical shifts and coupling constants point to a configuration different from the published structure and analogous to the structures of the other members of this family of natural products. The key step is a Kiyooka aldol protocol for the stereoselective synthesis of the tertiary alcohol flanked by three additional oxygenated carbon atoms. Furthermore, two additional aldol reactions and a Julia&#8211;Kocienski olefination were used to assemble the carbon framework.

Chemical synthesis of a Kdo&#8208;containing rhamnogalacturonan II pentasaccharide was achieved by a [4+1] post&#8208;glycosylation oxidation approach.







Abstract
The synthesis of a fully deprotected Kdo&#8208;containing rhamnogalacturonan II pentasaccharide is described. The strategy relies on the preparation of a suitably protected homogalacturonan tetrasaccharide backbone, through a post&#8208;glycosylation oxidation approach, and its stereoselective glycosylation with a Kdo fluoride donor.

New visible&#8208;light&#8208;excitable solvatochromic fluorescent label for light&#8208;up and colour&#8208;change sensing of DNA&#8208;protein interactions.







Abstract
The synthesis of 2&#8242;&#8208;deoxycytidine and its 5&#8242;&#8208;O&#8208;triphosphate bearing solvatochromic acetophenyl&#8208;thienyl&#8208;aniline fluorophore was developed using the Sonogashira cross&#8208;coupling reaction as the key step. The triphosphate was used for polymerase synthesis of labelled DNA. The labelled nucleotide or DNA exerted weak red fluorescence when excited at 405&#8197;nm, but a significant colour change (to yellow or green) and light&#8208;up (up to 20 times) was observed when the DNA probes interacted with proteins or lipids.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A flash chromatography column free and transition metal free cyanation of &#945; C&#8722;H sulfonylamide was developed to access valuable &#945;&#8208;amino cyanation products from a variety of fluorine masked sulfonylamides. Compared with Strecker reaction, this transformation offers a complementary strategy to efficiently construct &#945;&#8208;amino cyanides from direct &#945; C&#8722;H functionalization of sulfonylamindes. The reaction has a broad substrate scope and occurs under mild conditions. More importantly, the new two&#8208;electron allows for excellent &#945; site&#8208;selectivity.







Abstract
This report describes the site&#8208;selective &#945;&#8208;functionalization of sulfonylamide derivatives through the in&#8208;situ generation of imine intermediates. The N&#8722;F sulfonylamides, which could facilitate the elimination to generate imines, are coupled with TBACN to efficiently and mildly afford &#945;&#8208;amino cyanides. Comparing with Strecker reaction, this transformation offers a complementary strategy to efficiently construct &#945;&#8208;amino cyanides from direct &#945; C&#8722;H functionalization of sulfonylamindes. The reaction is also characterized by broad substrate scope and flash chromatography column free workup. More importantly, the new two&#8208;electron pathway to generate imines through manipulation of the leaving group allows us to achieve excellent &#945; site&#8208;selectivity.

         <title>Surprising Homolytic Gas Phase Co&#8722;C Bond Dissociation Energies of Organometallic Aryl&#8208;Cobinamides Reveal Notable Non&#8208;Bonded Intramolecular Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The crucial resistance of aryl&#8208;cobalamins, as antivitamins B12, against metabolic conversion into B12 cofactors has been traced to their presumed strong organometallic bond. The strength of the Co&#8722;C bond of aryl&#8208;cobinamides was examined here by ESI&#8208;MS threshold collision&#8208;induced dissociation (CID) experiments. Surprisingly, the Co&#8722;C
 bonds of these aryl&#8208;corrins were less strong than the Co&#8722;C
 bond in their methyl analogue, revealing the relevance of non&#8208;bonded interactions.







Abstract
Aryl&#8208;cobalamins are a new class of organometallic structural mimics of vitamin B12 designed as potential &#8216;antivitamins B12&#8217;. Here, the first cationic aryl&#8208;cobinamides are described, which were synthesized using the newly developed diaryl&#8208;iodonium method. The aryl&#8208;cobinamides were obtained as pairs of organometallic coordination isomers, the stereo&#8208;structure of which was unambiguously assigned based on homo&#8208; and heteronuclear NMR spectra. The availability of isomers with axial attachment of the aryl group, either at the &#8216;beta&#8217; or at the &#8216;alpha&#8217; face of the cobalt&#8208;center allowed for an unprecedented comparison of the organometallic reactivity of such pairs. The homolytic gas&#8208;phase bond dissociation energies (BDEs) of the coordination&#8208;isomeric phenyl&#8208; and 4&#8208;ethylphenyl&#8208;cobinamides were determined by ESI&#8208;MS threshold CID experiments, furnishing (Co&#8722;C
)&#8208;BDEs of 38.4 and 40.6&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1, respectively, for the two &#946;&#8208;isomers, and the larger BDEs of 46.6 and 43.8&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 for the corresponding &#945;&#8208;isomers. Surprisingly, the observed (Co&#8722;C
)&#8208;BDEs of the Co&#946;&#8208;aryl&#8208;cobinamides were smaller than the (Co&#8722;C
)&#8208;BDE of Co&#946;&#8208;methyl&#8208;cobinamide. DFT studies and the magnitudes of the experimental (Co&#8722;C
)&#8208;BDEs revealed relevant contributions of non&#8208;bonded interactions in aryl&#8208;cobinamides, notably steric strain between the aryl and the cobalt&#8208;corrin moieties and non&#8208;bonded interactions with and among the peripheral sidechains.

         <title>Mononuclear Dysprosium Alkoxide and Aryloxide Single&#8208;Molecule Magnets</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mononuclear lanthanide single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs) have progressively evolved in recent years. Lanthanide alkoxide and aryloxide chemistry offers a modular design approach to study the relaxation dynamics of high&#8208;performing SMMs. Alkoxide and aryloxide ligands on a single axis at a DyIII ion enhances the magnetic anisotropy and the barrier to magnetic reversal (Ueff). Leading examples of DyIII alkoxide and aryloxide SMMs are discussed in this review.







Abstract
Recent studies have shown that mononuclear lanthanide (Ln) complexes can be high&#8208;performing single&#8208;molecule magnets (SMMs). Recently, there has been an influx of mononuclear Ln alkoxide and aryloxide SMMs, which have provided the necessary geometrical control to improve SMM properties and to allow the intricate relaxation dynamics of Ln SMMs to be studied in detail. Here non&#8208;aqueous Ln alkoxide and aryloxide chemistry applied to the synthesis of low&#8208;coordinate mononuclear Ln SMMs are reviewed. The focus is on mononuclear DyIII alkoxide and aryloxide SMMs with coordination numbers up to eight, covering synthesis, solid&#8208;state structures and magnetic attributes. Brief overviews are also provided of mononuclear TbIII, HoIII, ErIII and YbIII alkoxide and aryloxide SMMs.

         <title>Synthesis of Glycodendrimers with Antiviral and Antibacterial Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

Sticky scaffolds: The state of the art in the design and synthesis of glycodendrimers for the development of anti&#8208;adhesion therapy against bacterial and viral infections is described.







Abstract
Glycodendrimers are an important class of synthetic macromolecules that can be used to mimic many structural and functional features of cell&#8208;surface glycoconjugates. Their carbohydrate moieties perform key important functions in bacterial and viral infections, often regulated by carbohydrate&#8211;protein interactions. Several studies have shown that the molecular structure, valency and spatial organisation of carbohydrate epitopes in glycoconjugates are key factors in the specificity and avidity of carbohydrate&#8211;protein interactions. Choosing the right glycodendrimers almost always helps to interfere with such interactions and blocks bacterial or viral adhesion and entry into host cells as an effective strategy to inhibit bacterial or viral infections. Herein, the state of the art in the design and synthesis of glycodendrimers employed for the development of anti&#8208;adhesion therapy against bacterial and viral infections is described.

         <title>Tunable Light&#8208;Emission Properties of Solution&#8208;Processable N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Cyclometalated Gold(III) Complexes for Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Golden carbene emitter systems: N&#8208;Heterocyclic carbene (NHC) monocyclometalated gold(III) complexes that efficiently emit in the sky&#8208;blue to green part of the electromagnetic spectrum are reported. A first example of a solution&#8208;processable organic light&#8208;emitting device has been realized for this class of gold(III) complexes, revealing unique opportunities presented by these highly efficient gold(III) carbene emitter systems.







Abstract
N&#8208;Heterocyclic carbene (NHC) cyclometalated gold(III) complexes remain very scarce and therefore their photophysical properties remain currently underexplored. Moreover, gold(III) complexes emitting in the blue region of the electromagnetic spectrum are rare. In this work, a series of four phosphorescent gold(III) complexes was investigated bearing four different NHC monocyclometalated (C^C*)&#8208;type ligands and a dianionic (N^N)&#8208;type ancillary ligand ((N^N)=5,5&#8217;&#8208;(propane&#8208;2,2&#8208;diyl)bis(3&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)&#8208;1&#8201;H&#8208;pyrazole) (mepzH2)). The complexes exhibit strong phosphorescence when doped in poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) at room temperature, which were systematically tuned from sky&#8208;blue [&#955;PL=456&#8197;nm, CIE coordinates: (0.20, 034)] to green [&#955;PL=516&#8197;nm, CIE coordinates: (0.31, 0.54)] by varying the monocyclometalated (C^C*) ligand framework.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Golden carbene emitter systems&lt;/b&gt;: N&#8208;Heterocyclic carbene (NHC) monocyclometalated gold(III) complexes that efficiently emit in the sky&#8208;blue to green part of the electromagnetic spectrum are reported. A first example of a solution&#8208;processable organic light&#8208;emitting device has been realized for this class of gold(III) complexes, revealing unique opportunities presented by these highly efficient gold(III) carbene emitter systems.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;N&#8208;Heterocyclic carbene (NHC) cyclometalated gold(III) complexes remain very scarce and therefore their photophysical properties remain currently underexplored. Moreover, gold(III) complexes emitting in the blue region of the electromagnetic spectrum are rare. In this work, a series of four phosphorescent gold(III) complexes was investigated bearing four different NHC monocyclometalated (C^C*)&#8208;type ligands and a dianionic (N^N)&#8208;type ancillary ligand ((N^N)=5,5&#8217;&#8208;(propane&#8208;2,2&#8208;diyl)bis(3&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)&#8208;1&#8201;&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;pyrazole) (mepzH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)). The complexes exhibit strong phosphorescence when doped in poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) at room temperature, which were systematically tuned from sky&#8208;blue [&lt;i&gt;&#955;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;PL&lt;/sub&gt;=456&#8197;nm, CIE coordinates: (0.20, 034)] to green [&lt;i&gt;&#955;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;PL&lt;/sub&gt;=516&#8197;nm, CIE coordinates: (0.31, 0.54)] by varying the monocyclometalated (C^C*) ligand framework. The complexes revealed high quantum efficiencies (&lt;i&gt;&#981;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;PL&lt;/sub&gt;) of up to 43&#8201;% and excited&#8208;state lifetimes (&lt;i&gt;&#964;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) between 15&#8211;266&#8197;&#956;s. The radiative rate constant values found for these complexes (&lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;=10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#8211;10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) are the highest found in comparison to previously known best&#8208;performing monocyclometalated gold(III) complexes.

         <title>Co&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Intramolecular [3+2] Cycloaddition of Yne&#8208;Alkylidenecyclopropanes and its Reaction Mechanism</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first Co&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric intramolecular [3+2] reaction of yne&#8208;alkylidenecyclopropanes (yne&#8208;ACPs) using a commercially available ligand has been realized for the synthesis of 5/5 and 6/5 bicycles. This reaction avoids the use of precious Pd and Rh catalysts usually used for these reactions. Mechanistic studies suggest that the reaction takes places via oxidative cyclometallation of the alkyne and the ACP, ring opening of the cyclopropyl group, and reductive elimination.







Abstract
Developing new transition metal&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric cycloadditions for the synthesis of five&#8208;membered carbocycles (FMCs) is a research frontier in reaction development due to the ubiquitous presence of chiral FMCs in various functional molecules. Reported here is our discovery of a highly enantioselective intramolecular [3+2] cycloaddition of yne&#8208;alkylidenecyclopropanes (yne&#8208;ACPs) to bicyclo[3.3.0]octadiene and bicyclo[4.3.0]nonadiene molecules using a cheap Co catalyst and commercially available chiral ligand (S)&#8208;Xyl&#8208;BINAP. This reaction avoids the use of precious Pd and Rh catalysts, which are usually the choices for [3+2] reactions with ACPs. The enantiomeric excess in the present reaction can be up to 92&#8201;%. Cationic cobalt(I) species was suggested by experiments as the catalytic species. DFT calculations showed that this [3+2] reaction starts with oxidative cyclometallation of alkyne and ACP, followed by ring opening of the cyclopropyl (CP) group and reductive elimination to form the cycloadduct. This mechanism is different from previous [3+2] reactions of ACPs, which usually start from CP cleavage, not from oxidative cyclization.

         <title>Temperature Dependence of 1H Paramagnetic Chemical Shifts in Actinide Complexes, Beyond Bleaney's Theory: The AnVIO22+&#8211;Dipicolinic Acid Complexes (An=Np, Pu) as an Example</title>

         <dc:description>
NMR spectroscopy: The temperature dependence of paramagnetic 1H NMR chemical shifts are measured and modelled in the AnVIO22+&#8211;dipicolinic acid complexes. Only the pseudocontact term is non&#8208;zero. The magnetic susceptibility tensor, the energy states and magnetic moments of the paramagnetic center are deduced and compared to the SO&#8208;CASPT2 values.







Abstract
Actinide +VI complexes (
=
, 
 and 
) with dipicolinic acid derivatives were synthesized and characterized by powder XRD, SQUID magnetometry and NMR spectroscopy. In addition, 
 and 
 complexes were described by first principles CAS based and two&#8208;component spin&#8208;restricted DFT methods. The analysis of the 1H paramagnetic NMR chemical shifts for all protons of the ligands according to the X&#8208;rays structures shows that the Fermi contact contribution is negligible in agreement with spin density determined by unrestricted DFT. The magnetic susceptibility tensor is determined by combining SQUID, pNMR shifts and Evans&#8217; method. The SO&#8208;RASPT2 results fit well the experimental magnetic susceptibility and pNMR chemical shifts. The role of the counterions in the solid phase is pointed out; their presence impacts the magnetic properties of the 
 complex. The temperature dependence of the pNMR chemical shifts has a strong 
 contribution, contrarily to Bleaney's theory for lanthanide complexes. The fitting of the temperature dependence of the pNMR chemical shifts and SQUID magnetic susceptibility by a two&#8208;Kramers&#8208;doublet model for the 
 complex and a non&#8208;Kramers&#8208;doublet model for the 
 complex allows for the experimental evaluation of energy gaps and magnetic moments of the paramagnetic center.

         <title>Additive&#8208;free Aqueous Dispersions of Two&#8208;Dimensional Materials with Glial Cell Compatibility and Enzymatic Degradability</title>

Bioelectronics: Processing of additive&#8208;free aqueous dispersions of 2D materials like transition metal dichalcogenides and hexagonal boron nitride is demonstrated, and biological implications like cell compatibility and enzymatic degradability are investigated.







Abstract
Water&#8208;dispersible two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials are desirable for diverse applications. Aqueous dispersions make processing safer and greener and enable evaluation of these materials on biological and environmental fronts. To evaluate the effects of 2D materials with biological systems, obtaining dispersions without additives is critical and has been a challenge. Herein, a method was developed for obtaining additive&#8208;free aqueous dispersions of 2D materials like transition metal dichalcogenides and hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN). The nanosheet dispersions were investigated through spectroscopic and microscopic methods, along with the role of size on stability. The aqueous media enabled investigations on cytocompatibility and enzymatic degradation of molybdenum disulphide (MoS2) and h&#8208;BN. Cytocompatibility with mixed glial cells was observed up to concentrations of 100&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;mL&#8722;1, suggesting their plausible usage in bioelectronics. Besides, biodegradation using human myeloperoxidase (hMPO) mediated catalysis was investigated through Raman spectroscopy and electron microscopy. The findings suggested that additive&#8208;free 2H&#8208;MoS2 and h&#8208;BN were degradable by hMPO, with 2H&#8208;phase exhibiting better resistance to degradation than the 1T&#8208;phase, while h&#8208;BN exhibited slower degradation. The findings pave a path for incorporating 2D materials in the burgeoning field of transient bioelectronics.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Water&#8208;dispersible two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials are desirable for diverse applications. Aqueous dispersions make processing safer and greener and enable evaluation of these materials on biological and environmental fronts. To evaluate the effects of 2D materials with biological systems, obtaining dispersions without additives is critical and has been a challenge. Herein, a method was developed for obtaining additive&#8208;free aqueous dispersions of 2D materials like transition metal dichalcogenides and hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN). The nanosheet dispersions were investigated through spectroscopic and microscopic methods, along with the role of size on stability. The aqueous media enabled investigations on cytocompatibility and enzymatic degradation of molybdenum disulphide (MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and h&#8208;BN. Cytocompatibility with mixed glial cells was observed up to concentrations of 100&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;mL&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, suggesting their plausible usage in bioelectronics. Besides, biodegradation using human myeloperoxidase (hMPO) mediated catalysis was investigated through Raman spectroscopy and electron microscopy. The findings suggested that additive&#8208;free 2H&#8208;MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and h&#8208;BN were degradable by hMPO, with 2H&#8208;phase exhibiting better resistance to degradation than the 1T&#8208;phase, while h&#8208;BN exhibited slower degradation. The findings pave a path for incorporating 2D materials in the burgeoning field of transient bioelectronics.&lt;/p&gt;

Doubling up: The synthesis and first&#8208;principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations of Fe&#8208;doped, lead&#8208;free dipyramidal shape Cs2AgBiCl6 crystals for photodetector applications are presented. The results of systematic investigation of the crystal structure, morphology, optical properties, band structure, and stability of these materials are discussed.







Abstract
Lead&#8208;free double perovskites have emerged as stable and non&#8208;toxic alternatives to Pb&#8208;halide perovskites. Herein, the synthesis of Fe&#8208;doped Cs2AgBiCl6 lead&#8208;free double perovskites are reported that display blue emission using an antisolvent method. The crystal structure, morphology, optical properties, band structure, and stability of the Fe&#8208;doped double perovskites were investigated systematically. Formation of the Fe&#8208;doped Cs2AgBiCl6 double perovskite is confirmed by X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis. XRD and thermo&#8208;gravimetric analysis (TGA) shows that the Cs2AgBiCl6 double perovskite has high structural and thermal stability, respectively. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE&#8208;SEM) analysis revealed the formation of dipyramidal shape Cs2AgBiCl6 crystals. Furthermore, energy&#8208;dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy (EDS) mapping shows the overlapping of Cs, Bi, Ag, Fe, and Cl elements and homogenous incorporation of Fe in Cs2AgBiCl6 double perovskite. The Fe&#8208;doped Cs2AgBiCl6 double perovskite shows a strong absorption at 380&#8197;nm. It extends up to 700&#8197;nm, suggesting that sub&#8208;band gap states transition may originate from the surface defect of the doped perovskite material. The radiative kinetics of the crystals was studied using the time&#8208;correlated single&#8208;photon counting (TCSPC) technique. Lattice parameters and band gap value of the Fe&#8208;doped Cs2AgBiCl6 double perovskites predicted by the density functional theory (DFT) calculations are confirmed by XRD and UV/Visible spectroscopy analysis. Time&#8208;dependent photo&#8208;response characteristics of the Fe&#8208;doped Cs2AgBiCl6 double perovskite show fast response and recovery time of charge carriers. We believe that the successful incorporation of Fe in lead&#8208;free, environmentally friendly Cs2AgBiCl6 double perovskite can open a new class of doped double perovskites with significant potential optoelectronics devices fabrication and photocatalytic applications.
