         <title>Sidechain&#8208;Backbone Tetrel Bonding Interactions Provide a General Mechanism for trans&#8208;Peptoid Stabilization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cis&#8208;trans isomerization of amide bonds impedes de novo design of folded peptoids (poly&#8208;N&#8208;substituted glycines) with precise secondary structures and affects peptoid&#8208;biomolecule binding affinity. Herein, from X&#8208;ray, NMR and DFT studies of azapeptoids, we have discovered a tetrel bonding interaction that stabilizes trans&#8208;peptoids. We show that peptoids having &#945;&#8208;heteroatoms and N&#8208;aryl groups in the sidechain adopt trans&#8208;amide geometries due to the presence of a nX/&#960;Ar &#8594; &#963;*C&#945;&#8210;N tetrel bonding interaction between the sidechain &#945;&#8208;heteroatom lone pair (nX) or &#960;&#8208;electrons (&#960;Ar) and the &#963;* orbital of the backbone C&#945;&#8210;N bond. Further, CD spectroscopic studies of oligo&#8208;proline host&#8208;guest model peptides showed that azapeptoid residues stabilize polyproline II helical conformation. These data indicate that the sidechain&#8208;backbone tetrel bonding could be leveraged to design peptoids with precise secondary structures for a wide range of biological and material applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Fullerene C70 as Photoredox Catalyst for the Synthesis of Pyrrolo[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinolines by 1,3&#8208;Dipolar Cycloaddition&#8208;Aromatization Sequence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8208;free photoredox catalyst C70 was introduced for the facile construction of pyrrolo[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinolines under mild conditions, yielding a diverse library of pyrrolo[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinolines. Low catalyst loading, gram scale synthesis, and broad substrate scope (48 examples) demonstrate the synthetic utility of the protocol and encourage its future application as a photoredox catalyst in organic transformations.







Abstract
Herein, fullerene (C70) is introduced as an effective photoredox catalyst for the construction of a highly functionalised pyrrolo[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinoline framework by 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition&#8208;aromatisation reaction sequence. The ability of C70 to efficiently harvest visible light, its long&#8208;triplet state lifetime, good photostability, and strong singlet oxygen generation potential (&#934;&#9653;&#8776;1), make it an efficient photoredox catalyst. Upon photoirradiation, C70 promotes the formation of singlet oxygen and superoxide radical by energy transfer (EnT) and single electron transfer (SET) mechanism. The superoxide radical acts as a potential oxidant in the formation of azomethine ylide through the oxidation&#8208;deprotonation tandem process. Azomethine ylide further participates in [3+2]&#8208;cycloaddition reaction protocol with alkene/alkyne to give the corresponding pyrrolo[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinolines. Interestingly, this protocol allows the activation of a wide range of substrates giving access to a diverse library of 48 well&#8208;decorated pyrrolo[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinolines with good functional group tolerance.

         <title>Modifications of acyl carrier protein&#8208;bound glycosylated polyketides in pactamycin biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The potent antitumor antibiotic pactamycin is an aminocyclopentitol&#8208;containing natural product produced by the soil bacterium Streptomyces pactum. Recent studies showed that the aminocyclopentitol unit is derived from N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;D&#8208;glucosamine, which is attached to an acyl carrier protein (ACP)&#8208;bound polyketide by a glycosyltransferase enzyme, PtmJ. Here, we report a series of post&#8208;glycosylation modifications of the sugar moiety of the glycosylated polyketide while it is still attached to the carrier protein. In vitro reconstitution of PtmS (an AMP&#8208;ligase), PtmI (an ACP), PtmJ, PtmN (an oxidoreductase), PtmA (an aminotransferase), and PtmB (a putative carbamoyltransferase) showed that the N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;D&#8208;glucosamine moiety of the glycosylated polyketide is first oxidized by PtmN and then transaminated by PtmA to give ACP&#8208;bound 3&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;deoxy&#8208;N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;D&#8208;glucosaminyl polyketide. The amino group is then coupled with carbamoyl phosphate by PtmB to give a urea functionality. We also show that PtmG is a deacetylase that hydrolyses the C&#8208;2 N&#8208;acetyl group to give a free amine.</dc:description>

         <title>An Efficient Light&#8208;mediated Protocol for the Direct Amide Bond Formation via a Novel Carboxylic Acid Photoactivation Mode by Pyridine&#8211;CBr4</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The direct amide bond formation between a carboxylic acid and an amine still constitutes a challenging reaction for both academia and industry. We demonstrate herein that several pairs of amines (halogen bond acceptors) and organohalogen sources may be used for the photochemical amidation reaction under either UVA or sunlight irradiation. Our studies led to the identification of pyridine&#8211;CBr4 as an efficient agent to perform synthesis of amides under LED 370 nm irradiation, avoiding super&#8208;stoichiometric quantities. An extended substrate scope was demonstrated, showing that the widely used amino and carboxyl protecting groups are compatible with this photochemical protocol, while a number of industrially interesting products and bioactive compounds were synthesized. Direct infusion&#8211;high resolution mass spectrometry studies suggest an unprecedented type of carboxylic acid activation mode upon irradiation, involving the generation of a symmetric anhydride, an active ester with pyridine N&#8208;oxide and a mixed anhydride with hypobromous acid.</dc:description>

         <title>Reactivity of Yellow Arsenic towards Cyclic (Alkyl)(Amino) Carbenes (CAACs)</title>

         <dc:description>Different cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbenes (CAACs) were reacted with yellow arsenic. Several products [(CAAC&#8208;n)2(&#956;,&#951;1:1&#8208;As2)] (n = 1 (1), 4 (2)), [(CAAC&#8208;2)3(&#956;3,&#951;1:1:1&#8208;As4)] (3) and [(CAAC3)4(&#956;4,&#951;1:1:1:1&#8208; As8)] (6) were isolated due to the differing steric properties of CAAC&#8208;1&#8208;4. The products contain As2, As4 or As8 units and represent the first examples of CAACs&#8208;substituted products of yellow arsenic. The reactivity of As4 was compared with the reactivities of P4 and the interpnictogen compound AsP3, which led to a series of phosphorus&#8208;containing derivatives such as ([(CAAC&#8208;3)3(&#956;3,&#951;1:1:1&#8208;P4)] (4) and [(CAAC&#8208;3)4(&#956;4,&#951;1:1:1:1&#8208;P8)] (7)) and the [(CAAC3)3(&#956;3,&#951;1:1:1&#8208;AsP3)] (5).

         <title>Esterase specific Fluorescent Probe: Mechanistic Understanding Using QM/MM Calculation and Cell States Discrimination</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Esterases enzymes regulate the body&#8217;s homeostasis by catalyzing the hydrolysis of various esters. These are also involved in protein metabolism, detoxification, and signal transmission. Most importantly, esterase plays a significant role in cell viability and cytotoxicity assays. Hence, developing an efficient chemical probe is essential for monitoring the esterase activity. Several fluorescent probes for esterase have also been reported targeting cytosol and lysosomes. However, the ability to create efficient probes is constrained due to a lack of understanding of the esterase's active site for hydrolyzing the substrate. In addition, the fluorescent turn&#8208;on may limit efficient monitoring. Herein, we have developed a unique fluorescent probe,&#160;PM&#8208;OAc,&#160;to monitor mitochondrial esterase enzyme activity ratiometrically. This probe exhibited a bathochromic wavelength shift with esterase enzyme in alkaline pH (pH~ 8.0) due to an intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) process. The phenomenon is well supported by TD&#8208;DFT calculation. Moreover, the substrate (PM&#8208;OAc)&#160;binding at the active site of esterase and its catalytic mechanism to hydrolyze the ester bond are elucidated by molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and QM/MM (Quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics) calculations, respectively. Fluorescent image&#8208;based analysis of the cellular environment reveals that our probe can distinguish between live and dead cells based on esterase enzyme activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Atroposelective Synthesis of Heterobiaryls through Ring Formation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Axially chiral heterobiaryls have wide applications in chiral ligands, catalysts, and bioactive compounds, which have aroused great interest in the chemistry community. This review provides a summary of the recent atroposelective synthesis strategies of heterobiaryls via ring&#8208;formation approaches involving transition&#8208;metal catalysis and organocatalysis.







Abstract
Atropisomeric heterobiaryls play a vital role in natural products, chiral ligands, organocatalysts, and other research fields, which have aroused great interest from chemists in recent years. Until now, a growing number of optically active heterobiaryls based on indole, quinoline, isoquinoline, pyridine, pyrrole, azole, and benzofuran skeletons have been successfully synthesized through metal or organic catalytic cross&#8208;coupling, functionalization of prochiral or racemic heterobiaryls, and ring formation. Among different strategies for the atroposelective synthesis of heterobiaryls, the strategy of ring formation has become a vital tool toward this goal. In this review, we summarize the enantioselective synthesis of axially chiral heterobiaryls through ring formation approaches, such as cycloaddition, cyclization, and chirality conversion. Meanwhile, the reaction mechanism and the corresponding applications of the chiral heterobiaryls are also discussed.

         <title>Inclusion Complex Formation with Tetra&#8208;PEGylated Tetraphenylporphyrin and Face&#8208;to&#8208;Face Cyclodextrin Dimer through Unprecedented Molecular Threading</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synthetic tetra&#8208;PEGylated tetraphenylporphyrin (FePEG5kTPP) formed an 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 inclusion complex with a face&#8208;to&#8208;face cyclodextrin dimer in aqueous solution. The O2 adduct of the ferrous complex shows similar O2 binding affinity with natural hemoglobin and a long circulation time in blood, leading to the simple supramolecular complex that can be used as an artificial O2 carrier in&#8197;vivo.







Abstract
Herein, a host&#8211;guest inclusion complex formation between tetra&#8208;PEGylated tetraphenylporphyrin with a per&#8208;O&#8208;methylated cyclodextrin (CD) dimer through the molecular threading process that is physically unexpected to occur is described. Although the molecular size of the PEGylated porphyrin is much greater than that of the CD dimer, the sandwich&#8208;type porphyrin/CD dimer 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 inclusion complex was spontaneously formed in water. The ferrous porphyrin complex binds O2 reversibly in aqueous solution, which functions as an artificial O2 carrier in&#8197;vivo. Pharmacokinetic study using rats revealed that the inclusion complex showed a long circulation in blood in contrast to the complex without PEG. We further demonstrate the unique host&#8211;guest exchange reaction from the PEGylated porphyrin/CD monomer 1/2 inclusion complex to the 1/1 complex with the CD dimer through the complete dissociation process of the CD monomers.

         <title>Fine Tuning of Quantum Dots Photocatalysts for the Synthesis of Tropane Alkaloid Skeletons
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
CdS core, CdSe core and inverted type I CdS&#8208;CdSe core&#8208;shell quantum dots proved to be efficient photocatalysts for a two steps [3+3]&#8208;annulation reaction giving access to tropane skeletons, whereas InP&#8208;ZnS quantum dots stopped after the first step, affording a clean allylation reaction.







Abstract
Several types of Quantum Dots (QDs) (CdS, CdSe and InP, as well as core&#8208;shell QDs such as type I InP&#8208;ZnS, quasi type&#8208;II CdSe&#8208;CdS and inverted type&#8208;I CdS&#8208;CdSe) were considered for generating &#945;&#8208;aminoalkyl free radicals. The feasibility of the oxidation of the N&#8208;aryl amines and the generation of the desired radical was evidenced experimentally by quenching of the photoluminescence of the QDs and by testing a vinylation reaction using an alkenylsulfone radical trap. The QDs were tested in a radical [3+3]&#8208;annulation reaction giving access to tropane skeletons and that requires the completion of two consecutive catalytic cycles. Several QDs such as CdS core, CdSe core and inverted type I CdS&#8208;CdSe core&#8208;shell proved to be efficient photocatalysts for this reaction. Interestingly, the addition of a second shorter chain ligand to the QDs appeared to be essential to complete the second catalytic cycle and to obtain the desired bicyclic tropane derivatives. Finally, the scope of the [3+3]&#8208;annulation reaction was explored for the best performing QDs and isolated yields that compare well with classical iridium photocatalysis were obtained.

         <title>Machine Learning&#8208;Guided Computational Screening of New Candidate Reactions with High Bioorthogonal Click Potential</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
With the help of a QM&#8208;augmented&#8208;GNN, trained on a recently generated computational dataset, a vast chemical space of [3+2] cycloaddition reactions is screened for bioorthogonal potential, i.&#8201;e., a balance between speed and selectivity. A broad pool of candidate reactions with rich structural diversity is identified as a potential starting point for future experimental development of new bioorthogonal click reactions.







Abstract
Bioorthogonal click chemistry has become an indispensable part of the biochemist's toolbox. Despite the wide variety of applications that have been developed in recent years, only a limited number of bioorthogonal click reactions have been discovered so far, most of them based on (substituted) azides. In this work, we present a computational workflow to discover new candidate reactions with promising kinetic and thermodynamic properties for bioorthogonal click applications. Sampling only around 0.05&#8201;% of an overall search space of over 10,000,000 dipolar cycloadditions, we develop a machine learning model able to predict DFT&#8208;computed activation and reaction energies within &#8764;2&#8211;3&#8197;kcal/mol across the entire space. Applying this model to screen the full search space through iterative rounds of learning, we identify a broad pool of candidate reactions with rich structural diversity, which can be used as a starting point or source of inspiration for future experimental development of both azide&#8208;based and non&#8208;azide&#8208;based bioorthogonal click reactions.

The electronic nature of the Pd catalyst changes from &#960;&#8208;philicity to oxophilicity during the catalytic cycle, and this change plays an essential role in controlling the chemoselectivity of the cyclization reactions.







Abstract
It is well documented in the literature that 1,6&#8208;enynes are cyclized using PhI(OAc)2 (PIDA) in the presence of Pd(OAc)2 as a catalyst to yield cyclopropyl ketones. In contrast, it has been reported that when 1,6&#8208;enynes are substituted by a hydroxy group at the &#945;&#8208;position to the alkyne, the chemoselectivity of the cyclization reaction is altered, and polycyclic oxa&#8208;heterocycles are formed. This suggests that the hydroxy substituent plays a crucial role in changing the mechanism of the reaction. The aim of this study is to use density functional theory (DFT) calculations at the SMD/M06&#8208;D3/def2TZVP//SMD/M06/SDD,6&#8208;31G(d) level of theory to shed light on the reason for this change by investigating the detailed mechanistic aspects of these transformations. This study demonstrates that the electronic nature of the Pd catalyst changes from &#960;&#8208;philicity to oxophilicity during the catalytic cycle, and this change plays an essential role in controlling the chemoselectivity of the cyclization reactions. In addition, it was found that (1) the hypervalent iodine reagent PIDA serves not only as an oxidant for the oxidation of Pd(II) to Pd(IV), but also as a nucleophile that drives the acetoxypalladation step of the reaction, (2) the oxidation of Pd(II) to Pd(IV) by the iodonium ion [PhIOAc]+ occurs via an interesting mechanism involving coordination of [PhIOAc]+ to the Pd(II) centre, followed by a twist in the hypervalent iodine, and (3) Pd &#960;&#8208;complexes are not very susceptible to oxidation. (4) A Pd(II) complex can be six coordinate if the Pd centre is partially oxidized.

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Solid&#8208;State Na&#8208;Ion Conductor for Stable Sodium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;entropy hexagonal&#8208;prismatic Na4.9Sm0.3Y0.2Gd0.2La0.1Al0.1Zr0.1Si4O12 was successfully synthesized with a high room&#8208;temperature ionic conductivity of 6.7&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and low activation energy of 0.22&#8197;eV. It demonstrates an excellent electrochemical stability and a superior compatibility with sodium. Solid&#8208;state batteries based on this material deliver almost no capacity decay after 600 cycles.







Abstract
Solid&#8208;state sodium&#8208;metal batteries (SSBs) hold great promise for their merits in low&#8208;cost, high energy density, and safety. However, developing solid electrolyte (SE) materials for SSBs with high performance is still a great challenge. In this study, high&#8208;entropy Na4.9Sm0.3Y0.2Gd0.2La0.1Al0.1Zr0.1Si4O12 was synthesized at comparatively low sintering temperature of 950&#8201;&#176;C with high room&#8208;temperature ionic conductivity of 6.7&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 and a low activation energy of 0.22&#8197;eV. More importantly, the Na symmetric cells using high&#8208;entropy SE show a high critical current density of 0.6&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, outstanding rate performance with fairly flat potential profiles at 0.5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and steady cycling over 700&#8197;h under 0.1&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Solid&#8208;state Na3V2(PO4)3||high&#8208;entropy SE||Na batteries are further assembled manifesting a desirable cycling stability with almost no capacity decay after 600 cycles and high Columbic efficiency over 99.9&#8201;%. The findings present opportunities for the design of high&#8208;entropy Na&#8208;ion conductors toward the development of SSBs.

         <title>Antimicrobial Conjugated Oligoelectrolytes Containing Triphenylphosphonium Solubilizing Groups</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Triphenylphosphonium functionalization of a conjugated oligoelectrolyte (COE) with a stilbene core improved its spectrum of activity to include ESKAPE pathogens and mycobacteria while crucially retaining the membrane&#8208;perturbing mode of action characteristic of COEs. The efficacy of the lead compound in&#8197;vivo highlights the potential of the COE molecular platform for designing more effective antibiotics.

         <title>Facilitating [2+2] Photocycloadditions by Promoting Oxygen Tolerance and Substrate Activation in Water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Micellar photocatalysis enables an oxygen&#8208;sensitive energy&#8208;transfer&#8208;catalysed [2+2] photocycloaddition in water and under aerobic conditions. Micellar effects suppress undesired quenching of triplet states by molecular oxygen through low oxygen solubility and compartmentalization of the micellar reaction mixture. Additionally, activation of the substrates towards sensitization by hydrogen bonding in the Stern layer is proposed, allowing efficient triplet energy transfer from [Ru(bpy)3]2+.







Abstract
Micellar photocatalysis has been used to overcome oxygen quenching and enable a [2+2] photocycloaddition through triplet&#8208;energy transfer in water under aerobic conditions. The cheap and commercially available self&#8208;assembling sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) micelles were found to increase the oxygen tolerance of a typically oxygen&#8208;sensitive reaction. Furthermore, the use of the micellar solution was found to activate &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds to energy transfer and allow [2+2] photocycloadditions to take place. Our preliminary studies of micellar effects on energy&#8208;transfer&#8208;based reactions demonstrate the reaction between &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds and activated alkenes in a mixture of SDS, water and [Ru(bpy)3](PF6)2.

         <title>Use of Conglomerate Mixed Crystals to Deracemize a Stable Racemic&#8208;Compound&#8208;Forming System</title>

Deracemization of a solid solution: The deracemization of a racemic&#8208;compound&#8208;forming system by using the possibility of syncrystallization, that is the formation of solid solution, with a chemically related conglomerate&#8208;forming system has been demonstrated. Based on phase diagram study, three model compounds crystallizing as racemic compounds were deracemized this way giving the evidence of the concept.







Abstract
Deracemization extended to racemic&#8208;compound&#8208;forming systems is demonstrated. We present here the first results of an alternative for the resolution of systems that exhibit a stable racemic compound but also a closely related conglomerate&#8208;forming system. If the couples of enantiomers forming the racemic compound and the enantiomers of the stable conglomerate can syncrystallize in mirror&#8208;related partial solid solutions, it is possible to deracemize the racemic mixture of mixed crystals to access to a single handedness. The evidence for this possibility is given in three examples by using temperature&#8208;cycling&#8208;induced deracemization.

         <title>Residue&#8208;Selective C&#8722;H Sulfenylation Enabled by Acid&#8208;Activated S&#8208;Acetamidomethyl Cysteine Sulfoxide with Application to One&#8208;Pot Stapling and Lipidation Sequence</title>

Acid test for Tyr and Trp: S&#8208;Acetamidomethyl cysteine sulfoxide (Cys(Acm)(O)) enables the residue&#8208;selective C&#8722;H sulfenylation of Tyr or Trp under appropriately selected acidic reaction conditions. The dicationic intermediate derived from the Cys(Acm)(O) selectively reacts with Tyr, whereas the S&#8208;chlorocysteine allows Trp&#8208;selective sulfenylation. The one&#8208;pot sequence of stapling and lipidation of peptides was achieved.







Abstract
A tyrosine (Tyr)&#8208; or tryptophan (Trp)&#8208;selective metal&#8208;free C&#8722;H sulfenylation reaction using an acid&#8208;activated S&#8208;acetamidomethyl cysteine (Cys) sulfoxide, Cys(Acm)(O), has been achieved. The dually protonated intermediate produced from Cys(Acm)(O) under acidic conditions allows the sulfenylation of Tyr. Significantly, the reaction in the presence of trimethylsilyl trifluoromethanesulfonate (TMSOTf) mainly affords a Cys&#8208;Tyr&#8208;linked peptide even in the presence of Trp residues. In contrast, a Cys&#8208;Trp&#8208;linked peptide was selectively obtained from the reaction in the presence of guanidine hydrochloride (Gn&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;HCl) under acidic conditions. Established Tyr&#8208; and Trp&#8208;selective sulfenylation methods were used in the Cys&#8208;Tyr stapling and Trp lipidation of glucagon&#8208;like peptides 1 in a one&#8208;pot/stepwise manner. Investigation of the mechanism showed that orbital&#8208; and charge&#8208;controlled reactions are responsible for the Trp and Tyr selectivity, respectively.

         <title>Wide&#8208;Temperature Flexible Supercapacitor from an Organohydrogel Electrolyte and Its Combined Electrode</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A flexible supercapacitor that integrates a wide application temperature range, satisfactory electrochemical performance and mechanical properties was fabricated by using anti&#8208;freezing and anti&#8208;drying organohydrogels both as electrolyte and binder of the combined electrode. The H2O molecules in the organohydrogel are fixed in the 3D polyacrylamide network through the hydrogen bond interaction of ethylene glycol and ionic hydration of LiCl, thus greatly limiting their crystallization or evaporation at extreme temperatures. More information can be found in the Research Article by J. Hao and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202300123).

         <title>Tyrosine&#8208;Conjugation Method for Evaluating BACE1 Activity Based on Silver Nanoparticles/Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Composites as Electrochemical Tags</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrochemical assay for probing the cleavage of surface&#8208;confined APP peptide substrates by BACE1 was developed based on specific chemical labeling of terminal tyrosine.







Abstract
Beta&#8208;site secretase (BACE1) catalyzes the cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP), which process ultimately lead to plaque deposition in the brain of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Thus, accurate monitor of BACE1 activity is essential to screen inhibitors for AD treatment. This study develops a sensitive electrochemical assay for probing BACE1 activity based on silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) and tyrosine conjugation as tags and a marking method, respectively. An APP segment is firstly immobilized on aminated microplate reactor. Cytosine (C) rich sequence&#8208;templated AgNPs/Zr&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) composite is modified by phenol groups, and then the prepared tag (ph&#8208;AgNPs@MOF) is captured in microplate surface by the conjugation reaction of phenolic groups between tyrosine and tag. After cleavage by BACE1, the solution containing ph&#8208;AgNPs@MOF tags is transferred to the screen&#8208;printed graphene electrode (SPGE) surface for voltammetric detection of AgNP signal. This sensitive detection for BACE1 provided an excellent linear relationship between 1 to 200&#8197;pM with a detection limit of 0.8&#8197;pM. Furthermore, this electrochemical assay is successfully applied for screening of BACE1 inhibitors. This strategy is also verified to be used for evaluation of BACE1 in serum samples.

         <dc:description>
The energy storage cycle of the molecular solar thermal (MOST) system has been investigated. In particular, upon irradiation, the energy&#8208;lean 2&#8208;carbethoxy&#8208;3&#8208;phenyl&#8208;norbornadiene is converted into its energy&#8208;rich quadricyclane isomer. The energy&#8208;releasing back reaction can be triggered thermally by means of a suitable catalyst surface. The differences in the energy landscapes is visualized by sea level and mountains. More information can be found in the Research Article by C. Papp and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202203739). Cover design by F. Hemauer.

         <dc:description>
Novel red&#8208;to&#8208;NIR fluorophores called Nanchang Red (NCR) dyes have been constructed by rational structural hybridization of cyanine and borondifluoride curcuminoid. The peculiar asymmetrical layout of the three key fragments endows these long&#8208;wavelength dyes with ideal photophysical properties and ER self&#8208;targeting capability. The photoluminescent mechanism, revealed by quantum chemical calculations, will greatly facilitate future exploration of cyanine&#8208;BF2 hybridized NIR dyes.

         <title>Organophosphorus Extractants: A Critical Choice for Actinides/Lanthanides Separation in Nuclear Fuel Cycle</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The separation of actinides from lanthanides in spent nuclear fuel reprocessing is a vital step of nuclear fuel cycle process. As one class of mature industrial extractants, the organophosphorus extractants have been widely used for the extraction and separation of actinides and lanthanides in spent fuel reprocessing due to their strong extraction ability and low&#8208;cost acquisition. In this concept, the application scope of tributyl phosphate (TBP), bis(2&#8208;ethylhexyl) phosphate (HDEHP), octyl(phenyl)&#8208;N,N&#8208;diisobutylcarbamoylmethylphosphine oxide (CMPO), trialkyl phosphine oxide (TRPO), and purified Cyanex 301 (bis(2,4,4&#8208;trimethylpentyl) dithiophosphinic acid, HA301) are introduced, and their extraction mechanism, as well as structure&#8208;function relationships for separation of actinides over lanthanides are also discussed. Furthermore, the design criteria, extraction properties and mechanism of several typical newly developed organophosphorus extractants (CMPO&#8208;modified calixarene/pillarene, phenanthroline&#8208;derived organophosphorus extractants, and phosphate&#8208;modified carborane) based on pre&#8208;organized skeletons are briefly reviewed. Finally, we summarize and emphasize the important role played by those organophosphorus extractants and look forward to their potential applications in separation of actinides over lanthanides in future advanced nuclear fuel cycle.</dc:description>

         <title>From chemotherapy to phototherapy &#8208; changing the therapeutic action of a metallo&#8208;intercalating RuII&#8208;ReI luminescent system by switching its sub&#8208;cellular location.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of a new heterodinuclear ReIRuII metallointercalator containing RuII(dppz) and ReI(dppn) moieties is reported. Cell&#8208;free studies reveal that the complex has similar photophysical properties to its homoleptic M(dppz) analogue and it also binds to DNA with a similar affinity. However, the newly reported complex has very different in&#8208;cell properties to its parent. In complete contrast to the homoleptic system, the RuII(dppz)/ReI(dppn) complex is not intrinsically cytotoxic but displays appreciable phototoxic, despite both complexes displaying very similar quantum yields for singlet oxygen sensitization. Optical microscopy suggests that the reason for these contrasting biological effects is that whereas the homoleptic complex localises in the nuclei of cells, the RuII(dppz)/ReI(dppn) complex preferentially accumulates in mitochondria. These observations illustrate how even small structural changes in metal based therapeutic leads can modulate their mechanism of action.</dc:description>

         <title>Stretching the Bisalkyne Raman Spectral Palette Reveals a New Electrophilic Covalent Motif</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Small heteroaryl&#8208;diyne (Het&#8208;DY) tags with distinct vibrational frequencies, and physiologically relevant cLog P were designed for multiplexed bioorthogonal Raman imaging. Pd&#8208;Cu catalyzed coupling, combined with the use of Lei ligand, was shown to improve overall yields of the desired heterocoupled Het&#8208;Dy tags, minimizing the production of homocoupled side&#8208;products. Spectral data were in agreement with the trends predicted by DFT calculations and systematic introduction of electron&#8208;rich/poor rings stretched the frequency limit of aryl&#8208;capped diynes (2209&#8208;2243 cm&#8208;1). The improved Log P of these Het&#8208;Dy tags was evident from their diffuse distribution in cellular uptake studies and functionalizing tags with organelle markers allowed the acquisition of location&#8208;specific biological images. LC&#8208;MS&#8208; and NMR&#8208;based assays showed that some heteroaryl&#8208;capped internal alkynes are potential nucleophile traps with structure&#8208;dependent reactivity. These biocompatible Het&#8208;Dy tags, equipped with covalent reactivity, open up new avenues for Raman bioorthogonal imaging.</dc:description>

         <title>Normal vs. Inverted Ordering of Reduction Potentials in [FeFe]&#8208;Hydrogenases Biomimetics: Effect of the Dithiolate Bulk</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Three hexacarbonyl diiron dithiolate complexes [Fe2(CO)6(&#181;&#8208;(SCH2)2X)] with different substituted bridgeheads (X = CH2, CEt2, CBn2 (Bn = CH2C6H5)), have been studied under the same experimental conditions by cyclic voltammetry in dichloromethane [NBu4][PF6] 0.2 M. DFT calculations were performed to rationalize the mechanism of reduction of these compounds. The three complexes undergo a two&#8208;electron transfer whose the mechanism depend on the bulkiness of the dithiolate bridge, which involves a different timing of the structural changes (Fe&#8208;S bond cleavage, inversion of conformation and CO bridging) vs redox steps. The introduction of a bulky group in the dithiolate linker has obviously an effect on normally ordered (as for propanedithiolate (pdt)) or inverted (pdtEt2, pdtBn2) reduction potentials. Et &#8594; CH2Ph replacement is not theoretically predicted to alter the geometry and energy of the most stable mono&#8208;reduced and bi&#8208;reduced forms but such a replacement alters the kinetics of the electron transfer vs the structural changes.</dc:description>

         <title>Coordination vs. Insertion: On the Interaction of 5d&#8208;Transition Metal Carbonyl Clusters with Silver(I)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The title silver(I) complex salts [Ag{Re2(CO)10}{Re(CO)5}2]+[Al(ORF)4]&#8722; (AgRe4; ORF = &#8208;OC(CF3)3) and [Ag{Ir4(CO)12}2]+&#173;[Al(ORF)4]&#8722; (AgIr8) form upon reaction of Ag+[Al(ORF)4]&#8722; and the transition metal carbonyls (TMCs) Re2(CO)10 and Ir4(CO)12 respectively. The solid&#8208;state structure of the AgRe4 cluster shows an unexpected asymmetric coordination motif, wherein the silver(I) cation has inserted into the Re&#8208;Re bond of one Re2(CO)10 moiety, while the other dirhenium carbonyl coordinates only over one metal atom towards the silver(I) cation. The AgIr8 cluster is formed by the edge&#8208;on coordination of two Ir4 tetrahedra and the silver cation in a D2 symmetric fashion with a torsion angle of 46.5&#176;. The QTAIM analysis shows bond paths between the silver atom and the nearby metal atoms in all cases, whereas only the non&#8208;inserted Re2(CO)10 moiety shows additional bond paths between the carbonyl ligands and the silver cation. In addition, the insertion of the Ag+ cation into the Re&#8208;Re bond in Re2(CO)10 removes the bond path between the two rhenium atoms. The EDA&#8208;NOCV analysis suggests an increase of the interaction energy between the silver(I) cation and the respective metal carbonyls from the metal centered TMC donors W(CO)6 &lt; Re2(CO)10 &lt; Os3(CO)12 &lt; Ir4(CO)12. In all cases, the dominating orbital interaction is &#963;&#8208;donation [TMC]&#8594;Ag+&#8592;[TMC].</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A precise investigation of NbO has been carried out by advanced electron microscopy combined with powder and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD). The structure of pristine NbO has been determined as Pm&#8208;3m space group (SG) with a=4.211 &#197; and the positions of Nb and O at the 3c and 3d Wyckoff positions, respectively, which is consistent with previous report based on powder XRD data. Electron beams induced a structural transition, which was investigated and explained by combining electron diffraction and atomic&#8208;resolution imaging. The results revealed that the electron beam stimulated both Nb and O atom&#8208;migrations within each fcc sublattice, and that the final structure was SG Fm&#8208;3m with a=4.29 &#197;, Nb and O at the 4a and 4b with 75% occupancy and same chemical composition. Antiphase planar defects were discovered in the pristine NbO and related to the structural transformation. Theoretical calculations performed by density functional theory (DFT) supported the experimental conclusions.</dc:description>

Herein, using density functional theory (DFT) methods and microkinetic simulations, we systematically investigated the ORR catalytic performance of a series of 2D metal&#8208;organic frameworks M3(HADQ)2 (HADQ = 2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexaamine dipyrazino quinoxaline). It shows that all 2D M3(HADQ)2 (M = Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Ru, Rh and Pd) monolayers are metallic, due to &#960;&#8208;conjugated crystal orbitals centered on the central metals and ligand N atoms. The catalytic activity of M3(HADQ)2 depends on the binding strength between ORR intermediates and metal species, and can be tuned via changing the central metals. Among these candidates, Rh3(HADQ)2 and Co3(HADQ)2 show superior ORR performance to Pt (111) with high half&#8208;wave potentials of 0.99 and 0.93 V, respectively. Moreover, the screened two catalysts have excellent intermediate&#8208;tolerance ability for dynamic coverage of oxygenated species on the active sites. Our work provides a new path towards developing efficient ORR electrocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanisms of the Reaction of Elemental Sulfur and Polysulfides with Cyanide and Phosphines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reactions of elemental sulfur (S8) and polysulfides with nucleophiles are relevant to organic synthesis, materials science and biochemistry, but the mechanisms by which they operate are still unknown due to the inherent thermodynamic and kinetic instability of polysulfide intermediates. Using Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations at the &#969;B97X&#8208;D/aug&#8208;cc&#8208;pV(T+d)Z/SMD(MeCN) // &#969;B97X&#8208;D/ aug&#8208;cc&#8208;pVDZ/SMD(MeCN) level of theory, we studied the mechanisms behind the reaction of elemental sulfur and polysulfides with cyanide and phosphines, which quantitatively generate the monosulfide products thiocyanate and phosphine sulfides, respectively. All plausible pathways including nucleophilic decomposition, unimolecular decomposition, scrambling reactions, and attack on thiosulfoxides, have been considered to provide the first comprehensive mechanistic picture for this class of reactions. Overall, intramolecular cyclization is identified as the most favorable decomposition pathway for long polysulfides. For short polysulfides, a mixture of unimolecular decomposition, nucleophilic attack, and scrambling pathways can be expected.</dc:description>

         <title>Redox Convergent Synthesis and Reactivity of a Cobalt(III)&#8208;pentasulfido Compound</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new mononuclear cobalt(III)&#8208;pentasulfido compound, [(L)Co(S5)] (3) has been synthesized using a convergent redox reaction between elemental sulfur and two new cobalt(II)&#8208;thiolato compounds, [(L)Co(SR)] (R = Ph, 2a; 2,6&#8208;Me2&#8208;C6H4, 2b), which in turn were synthesized from a dimeric cobalt(II) complex, [(L)2Co2]2+ (1). Compound 3 features a low spin, diamagnetic, Co(III) centre with a coordinated pentasulfido (S52&#8315;) chain and has no precedence in the literature. Compound 3 is highly stable towards reduction with a potential of &#8208;1.36 V (vs. Cp2Fe+/Cp2Fe) and gives back 1 upon chemical/electrochemical reduction. Reaction of 3 with phosphines yields back 1 and phosphine sulfides, while protonation of the coordinated S52&#8315; chain in 3 leads to the formation of 1, elemental sulfur and H2S. Finally, transfer of the coordinated S52&#8315; chain in 3 to selected organic compounds, such as MeI, PhCH2Br and PhCOCl, for the generation of organopolysulfido compounds has been demonstrated.</dc:description>

Silanols, as the silicon analogues of alcohols, are valuable and important compounds, which have found widespread applications in the field of materials science, synthetic chemistry, and medicinal chemistry. This concept intends to highlight recent advances in the construction of silicon&#8208;stereogenic silanols, and hope to inspire chemists to continue contributing to the development of novel synthetic methods toward chiral silanols.







Abstract
Silanols are valuable and important compounds, which have found widespread applications in the field of materials science, synthetic chemistry, and medicinal chemistry. Although a handful of approaches have been developed for the synthesis of various silanols, access to enantioenriched silicon&#8208;stereogenic silanols remains underdeveloped. This Concept article intends to summarize and highlight recent advances in the construction of silicon&#8208;stereogenic silanols and endeavors to encourage further research in this area.

         <title>An Improved Spectrophotometric Method for Toluene&#8208;4&#8208;Monooxygenase Activity</title>

The incorporation of a novel extraction step into a decades&#8208;old colorimetric assay enables rapid and simple regioisomer quantification of products from monooxygenase enzymes without costly, complex instrumentation.







Abstract
Monooxygenases, an important class of enzymes, have been the subject of enzyme engineering due to their high activity and versatile substrate scope. Reactions performed by these biocatalysts have long been monitored by a colorimetric method involving the coupling of a dye precursor to naphthalene hydroxylation products generated by the enzyme. Despite the popularity of this method, we found the dye product to be unstable, preventing quantitative readout. By incorporating an extraction step to solubilize the dye produced, we have improved this assay to the point where quantitation of enzyme activity is possible. Further, by incorporating spectral deconvolution, we have, for the first time, enabled independent quantification of the two possible regioisomeric products: 1&#8208;naphthol and 2&#8208;naphthol. Previously, such analysis was only possible with chromatographic separation, increasing the cost and complexity of analysis. The efficacy of our improved workflow was evaluated by monitoring the activity of a toluene&#8208;4&#8208;monooxygenase enzyme from Pseudomonas mendocina KR&#8208;1. Our colorimetric regioisomer quantification was found to be consistent with chromatographic analysis by HPLC. The development and validation of a quantitative colorimetric assay for monooxygenase activity that enables regioisomeric distinction and quantification represents a significant advance in analytical methods to monitor enzyme activity. By maintaining facile, low&#8208;cost, high&#8208;throughput readout while incorporating quantification, this assay represents an important alternative to more expensive chromatographic quantification techniques.

         <title>Hyperbranched Diketopyrrolopyrrole&#8208;based Polymers Constructed via Linear Side&#8208;Chains towards Organic Field&#8208;Effect Transistors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 19, April 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hyperbranched diketopyrrolopyrrole&#8208;based polymers were designed and synthesized via linear alkyl side&#8208;chain linkers towards OFETs. The results reveal that 2D topological hyperbranched polymers form stable thin film microstructures, and thus improve the device stability. Besides, the incorporation of linear alkyl chain instead of branching alkyl one can reduce steric hindrance, and thus improve the charge mobility.







Abstract
Conjugated polymers with high charge mobilities have drawn increasing attention in organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs) in recent years. However, OFETs of conjugated polymers with high mobility and good device stability remain a challenge. In this article, we report a hyperbranched polymer approach to improve the charge mobility and device stability. Three hyperbranched diketopyrrolopyrrole&#8208;based polymers were designed and synthesized via linear alkyl side&#8208;chain linkers. The results show that 2D topological hyperbranched polymers form stable thin film microstructures, and thus improve the device stability, since the conjugated moiety is interconnected by linear alkyl chain. Besides, the incorporation of linear alkyl chain instead of branching alkyl one reduce steric hindrance, and improve the microstructure ordering as well as the charge mobility. Bar&#8208;coated OFETs result demonstrates that the devices mobilities and operational stabilities (bias stability and bending resistance) are both improved. All these indicate that hyperbranched polymer is a potential candidate for future application.

         <title>Base&#8208;Mediated Radio&#8208;Iodination of Arenes by Using Organosilane and Organogermane as Radiolabelling Precursors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 19, April 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Discovery of a mild base mediated process allows radio&#8208;iodination to take place from either silane or germane. Comparison of the results shows that arylgermanes offers clinical potential as radio&#8208;iodination precursors. Proof of concept is demonstrated through the labelling of [125I]IMTO and [125I]MIBG thus offering an alternative to radio&#8208;iododestannylation processes using non&#8208;toxic precursors.







Abstract
The radio&#8208;iodination of arenes is investigated from organosilane and organogermane precursors using ipso&#8208;electrophilic halogenation (IEH). Discovery of a mild base mediated process allows radio&#8208;iodination in HFIP (1,1,1,3,3,3&#8208;hexafluoro&#8208;2&#8208;propanol) of either aryl silane or germane, with germanes being more reactive. Clinical potential of arylgermanes as radio&#8208;iodination precursors is demonstrated through the labelling of [125I]IMTO (iodometomidate) and [125I]MIBG (meta&#8208;iodobenzylguanidine) thus offering an alternative to radio&#8208;iododestannylation processes using non&#8208;toxic precursors.

         <title>Cycloisomerization of Alkyne&#8208;Tethered N&#8208;Acyloxycarbamates to 2&#8208;(3H)Oxazolones through Nitrenoid&#8208;Mediated Carboxyamidation</title>

Zip and shift: Activation of alkyne&#8208;tethered N&#8208;benzoyloxycarbamates with PtCl2/CO or FeCl3 promotes 5&#8208;exo&#8208;cyclization to form carboxyamidation products and subsequent in&#8197;situ double bond migration catalyzed by Pt&#8208;catalyst or DMAP generates the final product 2&#8208;(3H)oxazolones. Experimental evidence suggests a concerted mechanism of nitrenoid&#8208;mediated C&#8722;N and C&#8722;O bond formation.







Abstract
The cycloisomerization of alkyne&#8208;tethered N&#8208;benzoyloxycarbamates to 2&#8208;(3H)oxazolones is described. Two catalytic systems are tailored for intramolecular 5&#8208;exo&#8208;alkyne carboxyamidation and concomitant alkene isomerization. PtCl2/CO (5&#8197;mol%, toluene, 100&#8201;&#176;C) promotes both carboxyamidation and alkene isomerization but has a limited substrate scope. On the other hand, FeCl3 (5&#8197;mol%, CH3CN, 100&#8201;&#176;C) promotes carboxyamidation effectively but a cocatalyst is required for the exocyclic alkene isomerization. Thus, a two&#8208;step one&#8208;pot protocol has been developed for a broader reaction scope, which involves FeCl3&#8208;catalyzed carboxyamidation and base&#8208;induced alkene isomerization. Crossover experiments suggest that these reactions proceed mainly through a mechanism involving acylnitrenoid intermediates rather than carbenoid intermediates.

Gearing up ruthenium complexes: Trisindazolylborate tripodal ligands used as ruthenium&#8208;supported rotating cogwheels have been enlarged by functionalizing the indazole moieties with peripheral aryl groups. Based on the single crystal structures, the apparent diameter of the new cogwheels increases of a factor up to 2.0 rendering them suitable for intermolecular gearing motions on surface.







Abstract
This paper reports the synthesis of ruthenium&#8208;based molecular gear prototypes composed of a brominated or non&#8208;brominated pentaphenylcyclopentadienyl ligand as an anchoring unit and a tripodal ligand with aryl&#8208;functionalized indazoles as a rotating cogwheel. Single crystal structures of the ruthenium complexes revealed that the appended aryl groups increase the apparent diameter of the cogwheel rendering them larger than the diameter of the anchoring units and consequently making them suitable for intermolecular gearing motions once the complexes will be adsorbed on a surface.

         <title>Dimerized Nitrogen&#8208;Annulated Perylene Synthesized from 1,6&#8208;Diazecine as Chiral Emitter</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 19, April 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Embedded by an atropomeric 1,6&#8208;diazecine unit, DNP&#8722;DA demonstrates circularly polarized luminescence, elevated molecular levels, expanded conjugation, supramolecular interactions with acceptors, etc. It presents a limited example of nitrogen&#8722;perylene based chiral emitter and provides the generality of utilizing 1,6&#8208;diazecine as an efficient chiral unit.







Abstract
In this work, nitrogen&#8208;annulated perylene (NP) was dimerized into one framework connected by two nitrogen atoms, generating the target molecule of DNP&#8722;DA. Owing to the substructure of 1,6&#8208;diazecine ten&#8208;membered ring, DNP&#8722;DA illustrates helical chirality with moderate dissymmetry factor, elevated molecular levels, expanded conjugation and supramolecular interactions with acceptors etc. Notably, DNP&#8722;DA represents a limited example of nitrogen&#8722;perylene based CPL emitter with glum around 6&#215;10&#8722;3. Intrigued by the facile fabrication via a simple amination&#8208;cross coupling sequence and other above advancing features, this work demonstrates the potential generality of utilizing 1,6&#8208;diazecine as a chiral unit to build CPL&#8208;active materials.

&lt;p&gt;Embedded by an atropomeric 1,6-diazecine unit, &lt;b&gt;DNP&#8722;DA&lt;/b&gt; demonstrates circularly polarized luminescence, elevated molecular levels, expanded conjugation, supramolecular interactions with acceptors, etc. It presents a limited example of nitrogen&#8722;perylene based chiral emitter and provides the generality of utilizing 1,6-diazecine as an efficient chiral unit.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this work, nitrogen-annulated perylene (NP) was dimerized into one framework connected by two nitrogen atoms, generating the target molecule of &lt;b&gt;DNP&#8722;DA&lt;/b&gt;. Owing to the substructure of 1,6-diazecine ten-membered ring, &lt;b&gt;DNP&#8722;DA&lt;/b&gt; illustrates helical chirality with moderate dissymmetry factor, elevated molecular levels, expanded conjugation and supramolecular interactions with acceptors etc. Notably, &lt;b&gt;DNP&#8722;DA&lt;/b&gt; represents a limited example of nitrogen&#8722;perylene based CPL emitter with &lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;lum&lt;/sub&gt; around 6&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;. Intrigued by the facile fabrication via a simple amination-cross coupling sequence and other above advancing features, this work demonstrates the potential generality of utilizing 1,6-diazecine as a chiral unit to build CPL-active materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Programmed Control of Fluorescence Blinking Patterns based on Electron Transfer in DNA</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 19, April 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In single&#8208;molecule fluorescence imaging, in addition to luminance and color, the fluorescence blinking pattern can be a parameter for the simultaneous detection of multiple targets. Electron transfer is known to be one of the major mechanisms of fluorescence blinking. Using DNA as a platform, we show that the blinking pattern can be fine&#8208;tuned by controlling electron transfer.







Abstract
Fluorescence imaging uses changes in the fluorescence intensity and emission wavelength to analyze multiple targets simultaneously. To increase the number of targets that can be identified simultaneously, fluorescence blinking can be used as an additional parameter. To understand and eventually control blinking, we used DNA as a platform to elucidate the processes of electron transfer (ET) leading to blinking, down to the rate constants. With a fixed ET distance, various blinking patterns were observed depending on the DNA sequence between the donor and acceptor units of the DNA platform. The blinking pattern was successfully described with a combination of ET rate constants. Therefore, molecules with various blinking patterns can be developed by tuning ET. It is expected that the number of targets that can be analyzed simultaneously will increase by the power of the number of blinking patterns.

         <title>Synthesis and Properties of B4N4&#8208;Heteropentalenes Fused with Polycyclic Hydrocarbons</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 19, April 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of carbon&#8208;BN hybrid molecules (1Naph, 1Anth, and 1Phen), consisting of a B4N4&#8208;heteropentalene core fused with polycyclic aromatic wings, were synthesized and fully characterized, and 1Phen featuring the highest triplet&#8208;state energy among 1 was shown to serve as a good host material for phosphorescent organic light&#8208;emitting diodes.







Abstract
Hybrid molecules of &#960;&#8208;conjugated carbon rings and BN&#8208;heterocyclic rings (h&#8208;CBNs) fused with each other have been a rare class of compounds due to the limited availability of their synthetic methods. Here we report the synthesis of new h&#8208;CBNs featuring a B4N4&#8208;heteropentalene core and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon wings. Using 1,2&#8208;azaborinine derivatives as a building block, we developed a rational synthetic protocol that allows the formation of a B4N4 ring in a stepwise manner, resulting in the fully fused ABA&#8208;type triblock molecules. Thus, three derivatives of 1 bearing naphthalene (1Naph), anthracene (1Anth), or phenanthrene (1Phen) wings fused with the B4N4 core were synthesized and characterized. Among them, 1Phen, which displays the highest triplet&#8208;state energy, was found to serve a host material for phosphorescent OLED devices, for which a maximum external quantum efficiency of 13.7&#8201;% was recorded. These findings may promote the synthesis of various types of h&#8208;CBNs aiming at new properties arising from the synergy of two different &#960;&#8208;electronic systems.

         <title>AIE&#8208;doped Poly(Ionic Liquid) Photonic Spheres for the Discrimination of Psychoactive Substances</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 19, April 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The high&#8208;degree flexibility and extendibility of introducing various functional anions into the poly(ionic liquid)&#8208;based single sphere sensing platform undoubtedly enable to obtain a huge number of sensing spheres with different properties, together with dual&#8208;channel response mechanism, it shows great potential for high&#8208;efficiency/high&#8208;throughput identification of complicated multi&#8208;analytes.







Abstract
Drugs of abuse has drawn intense attention due to increasing concerns to public health and safety. The construction of a sensing platform with the capability to identify them remains a big challenge because of the limitations of synthetic complexity, sensing scope and receptor extendibility. Here a kind of poly(ionic liquid) (PIL) photonic crystal spheres doped with aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) luminogens was developed. As diverse noncovalent interactions involve in PIL moieties, the single sphere shows different binding affinity to a broad range of psychoactive substances. Furthermore, the dual&#8208;channel signals arising from photonic crystal structures and sensitive AIE&#8208;luminogens provide high&#8208;dimensional information for discriminative detection of targets, even for molecules with slight structural differences. More importantly, such single sphere sensing platform could be flexibly customized through ion&#8208;exchange, showing great extendibility to fabricate high&#8208;efficiency/high&#8208;throughput sensing arrays without tedious synthesis.

         <title>Divergent Functionalization of Styrenes via Radical/Polar Crossover with CO2 and Sodium Sulfinates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 19, April 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Not so radical: The amalgamation of radical chemistry with polar chemistry is used to develop a tunable multicomponent reaction which involves CO2, sodium sulfinates and styrenes to access both &#946;&#8208;sulfonylateds carboxylic acids through radical&#8211;polar crossover process and to &#945;&#8208;substituted acrylates through sequential sulfonyl radical addition/coupling/elimination process. This setup exhibits excellent tolerance to different functional groups and its application towards biologically relevant molecules and product diversification contributes to the synthetic utility of this method.







Abstract
Sulfones and carboxylic acids are prominent motifs widely present in the chemical structure of agrochemicals, pharmaceuticals and many other highly valuable compounds. Herein, we describe a conjunctive strategy for the precise installation of these functionalities onto styrenes using sodium sulfinates and CO2 as coupling partners. The protocol allowed the preparation of carboxy&#8208;sulfonylated compounds in good yields and broad functional group tolerance. Additionally, taking advantage of the leaving group ability of the sulfone moiety, a one&#8208;pot photocatalytic carboxy&#8208;sulfonylation&#8208;elimination strategy was developed for the synthesis of &#945;&#8208;aryl&#8208;acrylates.

Partially thermal reduction and galvanic replacement proved to be a fascinating method to induce CuPt growth on CuHHTP MOF in order to achieve CuPt@CuHHTP heterojunction. It was discovered that the size of CuPt nanoparticles can be effectively regulated by the reduction temperature. The resultant CuPt NP@CuHHTP heterojunction nanoarrays were used to construct an enzyme&#8208;free electrochemical sensor of H2O2, which exhibited outstanding H2O2 sensing performance.







Abstract
Assembling bimetallic alloys (BAs) with metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) to form heterojunctions has emerged as a promising strategy for the construction of highly active electrocatalysts. However, the current approaches to prepare BA@MOF heterojunctions suffer from poor controllability. In this work, a fascinating method involving partial thermal reduction and galvanic replacement to induce CuPt growth on a CuHHTP MOF (HHTP=2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexahydroxytriphenylene) is reported in order to construct a CuPt@CuHHTP heterojunction. The size of the CuPt nanoparticles can be effectively regulated by modifying the reduction temperature. The resultant CuPt NP@CuHHTP heterojunction nanoarrays exhibit high electrocatalytic activity and potential as an electrochemical H2O2 sensor with a low detection limit (5&#8197;nM), high sensitivity (6.942&#8197;mA&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;mM&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;2), and outstanding selectivity. This in situ approach provides not only new insights into the preparation of BA@MOF&#8208;based heterojunctions but also an effective approach for the optimization of the catalytic performance of MOFs and related materials.

         <title>Pillar[5]arene Derivatives Embedded with Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission Luminogens and Their Fluorescence Regulation</title>

Three meso&#8208;position functionalized pillar[5]arene derivatives (H&#8208;1, H&#8208;2, and H&#8208;3) have been successfully prepared by embedding aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogens (AIEgens, diphenyldibenzofulvene and tetraphenylethylene) into the skeleton of supramolecular macrocycles. Their host&#8208;guest complexation properties with pyrazine salt G&#8208;1 and 1,4&#8208;dicyanobutane G&#8208;2 suggest that G&#8208;1 can decrease the fluorescence intensity of the AIE macrocycles, while G&#8208;2 can increase their fluorescence intensity.







Abstract
Through McMurry coupling reaction, three meso&#8208;position functionalized pillar[5]arene derivatives (H&#8208;1, H&#8208;2, and H&#8208;3) have been successfully prepared by embedding aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogens (AIEgens, diphenyldibenzofulvene (DPDBF) and tetraphenylethylene (TPE)) into the skeleton of supramolecular macrocycles. H&#8208;1, bearing [15]paracyclophane ([15]PCP) and DPDBF moiety, exhibits yellow emission and demonstrates obvious AIE effect. In order to further improve the host&#8208;guest properties of this type of structure, H&#8208;2 and H&#8208;3 are prepared by replacing the [15]PCP moiety with pillar[5]arene backbone, both of which show significant AIE effect and excellent host&#8208;guest complexation properties with pyrazine salt guest G&#8208;1 and 1,4&#8208;dicyanobutane G&#8208;2. Our findings indicate that G&#8208;1 can decrease the fluorescence intensity of the AIE macrocycles, while G&#8208;2 can increase their fluorescence intensity in solution.

         <title>Spin Crossover Induced by Changing the Identity of the Secondary Metal Ion from PdII to NiII in a Face&#8208;Centered FeII8MII6 Cubic Cage
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 19, April 3, 2023. </description>

Changing the identity of the secondary metal ion at the faces of the cage resulted in a spin crossover active material, with the packing effects of the axial acetonitrile ligands providing the steric freedom for structural reconformations associated with spin transition.







Abstract
Discrete spin crossover (SCO) heteronuclear cages are a rare class of materials which have potential use in next&#8208;generation molecular transport and catalysis. Previous investigations of cubic cage [Fe8Pd6L8]28+ constructed using semi&#8208;rigid metalloligands, found that FeII centers of the cage did not undergo spin transition. In this work, substitution of the secondary metal center at the face of the cage resulted in SCO behavior, evidenced by magnetic susceptibility, M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Structural comparisons of these two cages shed light on the possible interplay of inter&#8208; and intramolecular interactions associated with SCO in the NiII analogue, 1 ([Fe8Ni6L8(CH3CN)12]28+). The distorted octahedral coordination environment, as well as the occupation of the CH3CN in the NiII axial positions of 1, prevented close packing of cages observed in the PdII analogue. This led to offset, distant packing arrangements whereby important areas within the cage underwent dramatic structural changes with the exhibition of SCO.

         <title>RGD Cyclopeptide Equipped with a Lysine&#8208;Engaging Salicylaldehyde Showing Enhanced Integrin Affinity and Cell Detachment Potency</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 19, April 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A RGD cyclopeptide with a C&#8208;terminal salicylaldehyde tag shows a higher affinity for integrin &#945;V&#946;3 than control compounds. Covalent docking studies ascribe this increased affinity to a plausible formation of an intermolecular imine bond between salicylaldehyde and a Lys residue on the &#946;3 integrin subunit.







Abstract
Salicylaldehyde (SA) derivatives are emerging as useful fragments to obtain reversible&#8208;covalent inhibitors interacting with the lysine residues of the target protein. Here the SA installation at the C terminus of an integrin&#8208;binding cyclopeptide, leading to enhanced ligand affinity for the receptor as well as stronger biological activity in cultured glioblastoma cells is reported.

         <title>Nonmetallic Nitrogen&#8208;Doped MnO2 as Highly Efficient Oxygen Electrocatalyst for Rechargeable Zinc&#8208;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 19, April 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;MnO2 was synthesis at mild annealing temperature in 2&#8197;vol&#8201;% NH3 atmospheres. While avoiding the formation of Mn3O4, the introduction of Mn3+ and Vo by N doping improves the surface areas and enhances charge transfer property of catalysts, leading to outstanding bifunctional performance for ORR and OER.







Abstract
Zinc&#8208;air batteries (ZABs) have been considered as one of the most promising energy storage devices to solve the problem of energy crisis and environmental pollution. In this work, we reported the synthesis of nitrogen&#8208;doped MnO2 (N&#8208;MnO2) to replace the noble metal electrocatalysts for air cathode in ZABs. The doped N atoms here introduced more Mn3+ and oxygen vacancies for MnO2, enhancing charge transfer property and accelerating surface intermediate product during the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Hence, the best N&#8208;MnO2 achieved remarkable electrocatalytic activities towards ORR (half&#8208;wave potential of 0.797&#8197;V vs. RHE), and reversible oxygen overpotential of around 0.842&#8197;V, which is better than or comparable to the Pt/C and Mn&#8208;based catalysts reported recently. Moreover, the homemade ZABs based on N&#8208;MnO2 showed the maximum power density of 132.8&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and excellent cyclic stability.

&lt;p&gt;Zinc-air batteries (ZABs) have been considered as one of the most promising energy storage devices to solve the problem of energy crisis and environmental pollution. In this work, we reported the synthesis of nitrogen-doped MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (N-MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) to replace the noble metal electrocatalysts for air cathode in ZABs. The doped N atoms here introduced more Mn&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; and oxygen vacancies for MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, enhancing charge transfer property and accelerating surface intermediate product during the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR).

         <title>Crystallization of a Neptunyl Oxalate Hydrate from Solutions Containing NpV and the Uranyl Peroxide Nanocluster U60Ox30</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 19, April 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Interactions between U60Ox30 clusters and NpV reveal different mechanisms based on NpV concentrations. Low NpV concentrations cause the clusters to aggregate into larger macrostructures. Higher concentrations of NpV outcompete UVI for coordination with oxalate and lead to cluster dissociation. Neptunyl oxalate crystals and studtite precipitate from cluster remnants.







Abstract
Uranyl peroxide nanoclusters are an evolving family of materials with potential applications throughout the nuclear fuel cycle. While several studies have investigated their interactions with alkali and alkaline earth metals, no studies have probed their interactions with the actinide elements. This work describes a system containing U60Ox30, [((UO2)(O2))60(C2O4)30]60&#8722;, and neptunium(V) as a function of neptunium concentration. Ultra&#8208;small and small angle X&#8208;ray scattering were used to observe these interactions in the aqueous phase, and X&#8208;ray diffraction was used to observe solid products. The results show that neptunium induces aggregation of U60Ox30 when the neptunium concentration is&#8804;10&#8197;mM, whereas (NpO2)2C2O4&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;6H2O(cr) and studtite ultimately form at 15&#8211;25&#8197;mM neptunium. The latter result suggests that neptunium coordinates with the bridging oxalate ligands in U60Ox30, leaving metastable uranyl peroxide species in solution. This is an important finding given the potential application of uranyl peroxide nanoclusters in the recycling of used nuclear fuel.

         <title>Captodative Effect Facilitates the Excitation in Diboron Molecule (CAAC)2B2(SH)2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 19, April 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The co&#8208;planarity of thiol groups and the consequent captodative effect facilitate the electronic excitation in (CAAC)2B2(SR)2 by reducing the singlet&#8208;triplet gap. Two forces contribute to the &#960; electron movements. One is the &#8220;push&#8221; effect from the lone pairs on the sulfur atoms which boost the &#960; electron delocalization between BB center and CAACs. The other is the &#960; electron withdrawal by CAAC within each (CAAC)B(SR) fragment.







Abstract
Given the extraordinary versatility in chemical reactions and applications, boron compounds have gained increasing attentions in the past two decades. One of the remarkable advances is the unprecedented preparation of unsaturated boron species. Notably, Braunschweig et&#8197;al. found that the cyclic (alkyl)(amino) carbenes (CAACs) stabilized diboron molecules (CAAC)2B2(SR)2 host unpaired electrons and exist in the 90&#176;&#8208;twisted diradical form, while other analogues, such as N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs), stabilized diboron molecules prefer a conventional B=B double bond. Since previous studies recognized the differences in the steric effect between CAAC and NHC carbenes, here we focused on the role of thiol substituents in (CAAC)2B2(SR)2 by gradually localizing involved electrons. The co&#8208;planarity of the thiol groups and the consequent captodative effect were found to be the culprit for the 90&#176;&#8208;twisted diradical form of (CAAC)2B2(SR)2. Computational analyses identified two forces contributing to the &#960; electron movements. One is the &#8220;push&#8221; effect of lone pairs on the sulfur atoms which boosts the &#960; electron delocalization between the BB center and CAACs. The other is the &#960; electron delocalization within each (CAAC)B(SR) fragment where the pull effect originates from the &#960; electron withdrawal by CAACs. There are two such independent and orthogonal push&#8208;pull channels which function mainly in individual (CAAC)B(SR) fragments. This enhanced &#960; push&#8208;pull effect in the triplet state facilitates the electronic excitation in (CAAC)2B2(SR)2 by reducing the singlet&#8208;triplet gap.

Ultrathin Two&#8208;Dimensional BiOCl&#8208;Bi2S3&#8208;Cu2S Ternary Heterostructures with Enhanced LSPR effect for NIR Photonic Bacterial Disinfection (Chen, Yang, et&#8197;al.).







Abstract
Abstract: Photonic disinfection, particularly near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light triggered antibacterial, has emerged as a highly promising solution for combating pathogenic microbes due to its spatiotemporal operability, safety, and low cost of apparatus. However, it remains challenging to construct NIR&#8208;responsive antibacterial agents with high light&#8208;converting efficacy and elucidate synergistic mechanisms. In this work, ultrathin two&#8208;dimensional (2D) BiOCl&#8208;Bi2S3&#8208;Cu2S ternary heterostructures that can efficiently kill drug&#8208;resistant bacteria were synthesized by doping 0D Bi2S3 and Cu2S nanoparticles in the 2D BiOCl nanosheets via a facile one&#8208;pot hydrothermal method. Notably, the incorporation of Cu2S nanoparticles bestows strong NIR light&#8208;harvesting capability to the composite nanosheets due to their localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR). Upon NIR light illumination, the BiOCl&#8208;Bi2S3&#8208;Cu2S nanosheets can achieve enhanced photonic hyperthermia and reaction oxygen species (ROS) generation, serving as single light&#8208;activated bi&#8208;functional photothermal/photodynamic therapeutics. High&#8208;speed hot electrons and large local electronic fields caused by LSPR might play an important role in thermal vibrations and effective carrier separations, respectively. Benefiting from the unique ternary heterostructures, both the photothermal conversion and ROS generation efficacy of BiOCl&#8208;Bi2S3&#8208;Cu2S nanosheets are significantly improved compared to the binary BiOCl&#8208;Cu2S or BiOCl&#8208;Bi2S3 nanosheets. Accordingly, the ternary composite nanosheets can effectively kill bacteria via the NIR&#8208;driven photonic disinfection mechanism. This work presents a new type of 2D composite nanosheets with ternary heterostructures for NIR photonic disinfection.

         <title>Light&#8208;Triggered Control of Glucocerebrosidase Inhibitors: Towards Photoswitchable Pharmacological Chaperones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 19, April 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoactive pairs with stronger affinity for GCase in the light&#8208;activated form than in the thermally&#8208;deactivated one were identified for the development of pharmacological chaperones. The study shows that enantiopure trihydroxypiperidine and azobenzene are key&#8208;units in the inhibition process of human GCase enzyme and that photoswitchable iminosugars bind at an allosteric site.







Abstract
Piperidine&#8208;based photoswitchable derivatives have been developed as putative pharmacological chaperones for glucocerebrosidase (GCase), the defective enzyme in Gaucher disease (GD). The structure&#8208;activity study revealed that both the iminosugar and the light&#8208;sensitive azobenzene are essential features to exert inhibitory activity towards human GCase and a system with the correct inhibition trend (IC50 of the light&#8208;activated form lower than IC50 of the dark form) was identified. Kinetic analyses showed that all compounds are non&#8208;competitive inhibitors (mixed or pure) of GCase and the enzyme allosteric site involved in the interaction was identified by means of MD simulations. A moderate activity enhancement of mutant GCase assessed in GD patients' fibroblasts (ex vivo experiments) carrying the most common mutation was recorded. This promising observation paves the way for further studies to improve the benefit of the light&#8208;to&#8208;dark thermal conversion for chaperoning activity.

         <title>Impact of Internal Charge Transfer on the Photophysical Properties of Pyridine&#8208;Fused Phosphorus&#8208;Nitrogen Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 19, April 3, 2023. </description>

The first linear donor&#8208;acceptor conjugation seen in the pyridine&#8208;phosphaquinolinone scaffold is reported in this work. The direct result this has on the photophysical properties of various derivatives in both the amidate and imidate forms are explored.







Abstract
The phosphaquinolinone scaffold has been previously studied as a modular core for a variety of fluorescent species where use of substituent effects has focused on increasing or decreasing electron density in the core rings. We now report the synthesis and analysis of several pyridine&#8208;containing phosphaquinolinone species exhibiting notable linear conjugation from the aryl&#8208;substituent to electron&#8208;withdrawing pyridyl nitrogen. Varying the nature of the aryl substituent from electron&#8208;withdrawing to electron&#8208;donating leads to the generation of an internal charge&#8208;transfer (ICT) band in the absorbance spectrum, which becomes the dominant absorbance in terms of intensity in the most electron&#8208;rich &#8208;NMe2 example. This heterocycle exhibits improved photophysical properties compared to others in the set including high quantum yield and considerably red&#8208;shifted emission. The enhanced ICT can be observed in the X&#8208;ray data where a rare example of molecule co&#8208;planarity is observed. Computational data show increased localization of negative charge on the pyridyl nitrogen as the electron&#8208;donating character of the aryl&#8208;substituent increases.

Base&#8208;controlled palladium&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular four kinds of five reactions of 5&#8208;benzyl&#8208;1&#8208;(2&#8208;halobenzyl)&#8208;2&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrazol&#8208;3(2H)&#8208;ones have been developed including C(sp3)&#8722;H arylation and subsequent isomerization, C(sp2)&#8722;H arylation, reductive Heck reaction, and domino Heck reaction/alkylation of aryl C(sp2)&#8722;H bonds.







Abstract
Achieving site&#8208;selectivity and chemoselectivity is enormously challenging for substrates with multi&#8208;reactive sites in organic reactions. One kind of model substrates, 5&#8208;benzyl&#8208;1&#8208;(2&#8208;halobenzyl)&#8208;2&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrazol&#8208;3(2H)&#8208;ones with six reactive sites were chosen as the examples to probe their intramolecular four kinds of five reactions including C(sp3)&#8722;H arylation, C(sp2)&#8722;H arylation, reductive Heck reaction, and domino Heck reaction/alkylation of aryl C(sp2)&#8722;H bonds through variation of the reaction conditions. Screening of the reaction conditions showed that the different bases controlled the palladium&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular site&#8208;selectivity and chemoselectivity of the substrates: (i) Cesium carbonate (Cs2CO3) promoted the benzyl C(sp3)&#8722;H arylation of the substrates providing dihydropyrazolo[1,5&#8208;b]isoquinolin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones at 100&#8201;&#176;C, and isomerization of the dihydropyrazolo[1,5&#8208;b]isoquinolin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones gave isoquinoline derivatives at a higher temperature (140&#8201;&#176;C); (ii) Sodium acetate (NaOAc) mediated the aryl C(sp2)&#8722;H arylation of the substrates affording seven&#8208;membered biphenyl N&#8208;heterocycles; (iii) Sodium dichloroacetate (Cl2HCCO2Na) facilitated occurrence of the reductive Heck reaction of the substrates affording 1H&#8208;pyrazolo[5,1&#8208;a]isoindol&#8208;2(8H)&#8208;ones; (iv) Sodium trifluoroacetate (F3CCO2Na) assisted performance of the domino Heck reaction/aryl C(sp2)&#8722;H alkylation of the substrates leading to the spiro heterocycles. The &#8216;one substrate &#8208; multiple reactions &#8208; multiple products&#8217; strategy greatly reduces cost, increases diversity of products, provides more opportunity for screening of pharmaceutical molecules, and enriches modern organic synthetic chemistry.

         <title>Selectivity in Cationic Cyclizations Involving Alkynes: A Computational Study on the Biomimetic Synthesis of Steroids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 19, April 3, 2023. </description>

Inside out: Computational analysis of electrophilic cyclization reactions involving terminal or internal alkynes and electrophilic centers (cations and Lewis&#8208;acid&#8208;activated epoxides) provide insights into the different interactions that determine the 6&#8208;endo&#8208;dig or 5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig regioselectivity of terminal and internal alkynes, respectively.







Abstract
Computational studies on the electrophilic cyclization between alkynes and transient carbocations or Lewis&#8208;acid&#8208;activated epoxides show that the regiochemistry of the reaction depends on the terminal or internal position of the triple bond. Reactants possessing terminal alkynyl groups lead to six&#8208;membered rings, whereas internal alkynes yield five&#8208;membered rings through 6&#8208;endo&#8208;dig and 5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig electrophilic cyclizations, respectively. The regiochemistry of the reaction is not determined by two&#8208;electron interactions, but by the minimization of Pauli repulsion. This scenario is preserved in related biomimetic reactions leading to steroid scaffolds. In this latter case, the stereochemistry of the cyclization reaction is oriented towards the formation of equatorial C&#8722;C bonds connecting the new six&#8208;six&#8208; and six&#8208;five&#8208;membered fused rings.

         <dc:description>
A portfolio of photochemical transformations found in a variety of areas can be rationalized through consideration of either gain of 4n&#960;&#8208;electron aromaticity or relief of (4n+2)&#8201;&#960;&#8208;electron antiaromaticity in excited states of &#960;&#960;* character. These back&#8208;of&#8208;an&#8208;envelope tools provided by Baird's rule serve as a compass for excursions in electronically excited states. More information can be found in the Review by H. Ottosson and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202203748).

         <dc:description>
Selective cyclization of cationic alkynes is a useful tool for the synthesis of biomolecules such as steroids. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202204028), A. de&#8197;C&#243;zar, A. Arrieta and F.&#8197;P. Coss&#237;o analyze computationally how the nature of the alkyne determines the size of the ring and why the conformation of the fused rings dictates the stereoselectivity of the cyclization process.

With amorphisation, a simple and effective approach, it is possible to introduce atomic defects and short&#8208;range ordering into catalyst materials. The abundance of defects and dangling bonds improves the intrinsic activity and photocatalytic stability. In their Perspective (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202203810), S.&#8208;I. In and co&#8208;workers discuss how amorphisation offers a novel and powerful method to avoid the slow kinetics of CO2 reduction in rigid crystalline catalysis, resulting in higher performance for CO2 photoreduction.

The reversal of aromaticity and antiaromaticity upon excitation to the lowest &#960;&#960;* state impacts on the photophysics and photoreactivity of various annulenes. This unifying principle can guide the rationalization of a plethora of excited&#8208;state reactions and has a strong predictive power in the design of new photochemical transformations. For more details, see the Review by H. Ottosson et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202203748)

         <dc:description>
The beauty of organic synthetic chemistry, including trifluoromethylative transformations, is that it arouses the curiosity of the researcher. It&#8242;s like a card game: the exact outcome of reactions is often unpredictable. Therefore, they are very interesting and challenging to deal with. The picture shows some pieces of the traditional Hungarian cards. More information .can be found in the Review article by K. Aradi and L. Kiss. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202203499)

         <title>Toward a Comprehensive Understanding of Amorphous Photocatalysts: Fundamental Hypotheses and Applications in CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 19, April 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Helping amorphous photocatalysts to take shape: Although developing an amorphous photocatalyst for CO2 photoreduction may be challenging, it can perform better than crystalline photocatalysts if specific properties are considered. These include light harvesting, charge kinetics, short&#8208;range active sites, and reaction mechanisms. EXAFS and machine learning could be powerful tools for gaining insights into amorphous photocatalysts.







Abstract
In principle, photocatalytic activity can be precisely controlled with crystalline catalysts. However, an amorphous photocatalyst could be a viable candidate for CO2 photoreduction to form value&#8208;added products. The amorphous phase is currently part of the crystalline material in several ongoing CO2 photoreduction studies. Additionally, no study indicates the amorphous material required for overall CO2 photoreduction. This perspective review article highlights fundamental assumptions that are necessary to gain insights and understand the effectiveness of amorphous photocatalysts for CO2 photoreduction. We start with basic ideas and theories about these materials, including light harvesting, variable coordination number, and the interaction of CO2 molecules with the amorphous catalytic surface. To understand the prospects of the amorphous photocatalyst, we explore machine learning with EXAFS. Furthermore, we discuss product selectivity and regeneration of photocatalysts in detail. Finally, we briefly review the work in progress on amorphous materials and compare it to that on crystalline ones.

Photo&#8208;assisted metal air battery: The diagram exhibits an integrated photo&#8208;assisted metal air battery with the typical two&#8208;electrode configuration. This minireview introduces the general photo&#8208;assisted strategies and summarizes the recent advances of various photo&#8208;assisted metal air battery systems including Li&#8722;O2 battery, Zn&#8722;O2 battery and other metal&#8208;air batteries and highlights the remaining challenges and future opportunities.







Abstract
To meet the need of high energy density, long durability, safe and cost&#8208;efficient energy conversion and storage devices, metal&#8208;air batteries like Li&#8722;O2 and Zn&#8722;O2 batteries have received enormous attention and were subject to exciting development in the past decade. Photo&#8208;assisted strategies that enable the effective combination of photo/electric energy conversion/storage render a new dimension for the conventional metal&#8208;air batteries techniques with mere electric energy utilization. Therefore, tremendous research is ongoing in search of more efficient and durable devices with photo&#8208;assisted strategies. This review provides an overview of photo&#8208;assisted Li&#8722;O2 batteries, Zn&#8722;O2 batteries, and batteries with various metal/air components. The working mechanism, the basic device architecture and practical performances of various photo&#8208;assisted systems are summarized and discussed. Furthermore, certain technical challenges and future opportunities for the photo&#8208;assisted metal air batteries are emphasized and discussed in the hope of stimulating further research.

One main method for the access of organofluorine compounds is the trifluoromethylative functionalization of an olefin bond, which simultaneously introduces a functional group and a trifluoromethyl element into an olefin framework. This review provides a concise overview of this powerful and versatile method.







Abstract
Organofluorine chemistry has become an expanding area of research in organic chemistry and drug design. The synthesis of fluorine&#8208;containing molecules has received high significance in synthetic chemistry. Trifluoromethylative difunctionalizations of carbon&#8208;carbon multiple bonds with the simultaneous introduction of a CF3 group and another function have considerable relevance. Because of the high importance of carbon&#8208;carbon bond&#8208;forming reactions in organic synthesis, carbotrifluoromethylations are considered to be a field of synthetic chemistry of increasing importance. Our current goal in this review is to summarize recent developments of various trifluoromethylation reactions (excluding aryl&#8208; and alkynyl&#8208;trifluoromethylations) taking into consideration several main approaches, such as alkenyltrifluoromethylation, alkyltrifluoromethylation, carbonyltrifluoromethylation, and cyanotrifluoromethylation reactions.

         <title>Photochemistry Driven by Excited&#8208;State Aromaticity Gain or Antiaromaticity Relief</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 19, April 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aromatic and antiaromatic molecules are light&#8208;switched yin&#8208;yang entities flipping aromaticity into antiaromaticity, and vice versa, upon excitation to the lowest &#960;&#960;* state. This key feature has an impact on the photoreactivity and photostability of molecules in a variety of areas, and can serve as a compass for excursions in electronically excited states.







Abstract
Gain of aromaticity or relief of antiaromaticity along a reaction path are important factors to consider in mechanism studies. Analysis of such changes along potential energy surfaces has historically focused on reactions in the electronic ground state (S0), but can also be used for excited states. In the lowest &#960;&#960;* states, the electron counts for aromaticity and antiaromaticity follow Baird's rule where 4n &#960;&#8208;electrons indicate aromaticity and 4n+2 &#960;&#8208;electrons antiaromaticity. Yet, there are also cases where H&#252;ckel's rule plays a role in the excited state. The electron count reversals of Baird's rule compared to H&#252;ckel's rule explain many altered physicochemical properties upon excitation of (hetero)annulene derivatives. Here we illustrate how the gain of excited&#8208;state aromaticity (ESA) and relief of excited&#8208;state antiaromaticity (ESAA) have an impact on photoreactivity and photostability. Emphasis is placed on recent findings supported by the results of quantum chemical calculations, and photoreactions in a wide variety of areas are covered.

         <dc:description>
A set of 16&#8201;chiral ruthenium complexes containing atropisomerically stable NHCs was synthesized in good yields with excellent enantiomeric purities (up &gt;99.75&#8201;:&#8201;0.25&#8197;er). The chiral BIAN&#8208;based Ru&#8208;complexes Ru&#8208;4&#8201;g was the most efficient to catalyse the AROCM of endo&#8208; and exo&#8208;norbornenes (up to 97&#8201;:&#8201;3&#8197;er). Successfully converted into its corresponding Z&#8208;selective catechodithiolate complex Z&#8208;Ru&#8208;5, the latter demonstrated high efficiency in Z&#8208;selective AROCM of exo&#8208;norbornenes affording valuable trans&#8208;cyclopentanes in &gt;98&#8201;% Z&#8208;selectivity and the highest enantioselectivities reported so far (up to 96.5&#8201;:&#8201;3.5&#8197;er).







Abstract
A set of 16 chiral ruthenium complexes containing atropisomerically stable N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene (NHC) ligands was synthesized from prochiral NHC precursors. After a rapid screening in asymmetric ring&#8208;opening&#8208;cross metathesis (AROCM), the most effective chiral atropBIAN&#8208;NHC Ru&#8208;catalyst (up to 97&#8201;:&#8201;3&#8197;er) was then converted to a Z&#8208;selective catechodithiolate complex. The latter proved to be highly efficient in Z&#8208;selective AROCM of exo&#8208;norbornenes affording valuable trans&#8208;cyclopentanes with excellent Z&#8208;selectivity (&gt;98&#8201;%) and high enantioselectivity (up to 96.5&#8201;:&#8201;3.5&#8197;er).

         <title>Correlation of Experimental and Calculated Reaction Enthalpies with Ligand Donor Strengths</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Calorimetric studies on the formation of [(YPhos)AuCl] complexes confirmed the high binding strength of these ligands. The reaction enthalpies are shown to be easily obtained by calculations and correlate with the phosphine donor properties thus representing an interesting problem&#8208;specific descriptor for ligands in gold catalysis.







Abstract
Ylide&#8208;functionalized phosphines (YPhos) have recently proven to be strongly donating ligands that enable high catalyst activities in gold(I)&#8208;mediated transformations. We now report on a calorimetric study dealing with the [Au(YPhos)Cl] system and assess YPhos&#8208;Au bond dissociation enthalpies (BDE). Comparison with other commonly used phosphines confirmed the high binding strengths of the YPhos ligands. Furthermore, the values of the reaction enthalpies were shown to correlate with the electronic properties of the ligands measured via the Tolman electronic parameter or the calculated molecular electrostatic potential at phosphorus. Notably, the reaction enthalpies can conveniently be derived by computational methods, thus making these easy&#8208;to&#8208;obtain descriptors for ligand donor property quantification.

         <title>Stereoselective Synthesis and Characterization of Indenone Azine&#8208;Based Electron&#8208;Accepting &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Be more accepting: Indenone azines, in which two indene units are cross&#8208;conjugated by an exocyclic azine (C=N&#8722;N=C) moiety, have been synthesized in a stereocontrolled manner. The azine moiety makes indenone azines planar structure and gives enhanced electron&#8208;accepting character, thus making them promising candidates as electron&#8208;accepting building blocks.







Abstract
Indenone azines, in which the exocyclic C=C bond in dibenzopentafulvalene is replaced by an azine moiety (C=N&#8722;N=C), have been synthesized as novel electron&#8208;accepting &#960;&#8208;conjugated scaffolds. Structural modulation at the 7,7&#8242;&#8208;positions of indenone azines enabled stereoselective syntheses of diastereomers in which the configurations of the two C=N bonds are E,E or Z,Z. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analyses revealed that all the indenone azines exhibit high coplanarity in contrast to the twisted frameworks of dibenzopentafulvalene derivatives, resulting in the formation of densely &#960;&#8208;stacked structures. Electrochemical measurements and quantum chemical calculations revealed the electron&#8208;accepting character of indenone azines comparable to isoindigo dyes. In particular, the intramolecular hydrogen bonds of 7,7&#8242;&#8208;dihydroxy&#8208;substituted derivatives impart enhanced electron&#8208;accepting character and significantly red&#8208;shifted photoabsorption. This study demonstrates that indenone azines represent a promising candidate as electron&#8208;accepting building blocks for optoelectronic materials.

         <title>Copper Activation Enabling Reversible Aqueous Cu&#8722;ZnS Battery Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aqueous Cu/ZnS batteries have been proposed: ZnS is gradually activated by copper to form CuS under electric field during cycling. The formed CuS undergoes a two&#8208;step conversion of CuS&#8594;Cu7S4&#8594;Cu2S for energy storage. The introduction of sphalerite activation in the field of mining and metallurgy provides an idea for the design of materials design for aqueous metal&#8208;sulfide batteries.







Abstract
The aqueous metal&#8208;sulfide batteries (AMSBs) have attracted research interest due to their high capacity, environmentally friendly qualities, and the accessibility of raw materials. However, the design strategies for metal&#8208;sulfide cathode have rarely been reported. Here, the copper&#8208;activated sphalerite in which Zn2+ is substituted by Cu2+ through ion exchange has been introduced for the first time as cathode for aqueous Cu/ZnS batteries. After sphalerite transformed to CuS, a two&#8208;step conversion of CuS&#8594;Cu7S4&#8594;Cu2S storage mechanism has been proposed. At 0.7&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 current density, the capacity can reach 532.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 100 cycles. When cycled once at a current density of 35&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1, the initial reversible capacity can reach 461&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 under 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. Furthermore, the assembled Zn//ZnS hybrid ion cell delivers an energy of up to 460&#8197;Wh kg&#8722;1, which is better than for many AMSBs.

         <title>Interface Regulation for Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells through Potassium Citrate Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The incorporation of potassium citrate (PC) passivates interface defects between perovskite and SnO2 layers via the interactions of functional groups (K+, &#8722;COO&#8722;) in PC with undersaturated Pb and I ions in perovskite and Sn4+ in SnO2, resulting in improved power conversion efficiency (PCE) and excellent long&#8208;term stability.







Abstract
Efficiency and stability are key factors determining the final cost of electricity that perovskite solar cells (PSCs) generate. To date, effective strategy to progress in achieving efficient and stable PSCs is still a difficult problem that researchers continue to explore. This study reports a useful way to improve the quality of SnO2 film by introducing potassium citrate (PC) into SnO2 nanoparticles solution. PC passivates interface defects between perovskite and SnO2 layers via the interactions of functional groups (K+, &#8722;COO&#8722;) in PC with undersaturated Pb and I ions in perovskite and Sn4+ in SnO2. The resultant photovoltaic (PV) device achieves a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 22.79&#8201;%. The introduction of PC interface also significantly suppress the degradation of PSCs, by which 87.6&#8201;% of initial PCE is maintained after 2850&#8197;h storage in ambient environment. Moreover, the devices retained 95.5&#8201;% of initial PCE under 1&#8208;sun continuous illumination for 1000&#8197;h.

         <title>Construction of Pd&#8208;Co&#8208;doped CdS heterojunctions as efficient platforms in photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, we present the structural, optical and photocatalytic properties of CdS semiconducting nanostructures, doped with palladium&#8208; and cobalt&#8208;based species. XRD analysis, corroborated by Raman and XPS, demonstrated the growth of CdS crystallites in the hexagonal structure, whereas solvothermal conversion of neat precursor metal salts resulted in the formation of metallic Pd and cobalt oxide, respectively. Scanning electron microscopy imaging certified the dendritic structure of hybrids, especially in the case where CdS was grown in the presence of either palladium&#8208; or cobalt&#8208;based nanoparticles. XPS surface analysis revealed that a major fraction of metallic Pd nanoparticles was converted to PdO during the in situ growth of CdS nanoparticles. The oxidation of Pd nanoparticles could be ascribed to chemisorption of oxygen phases onto the metal surface. The presence of cocatalyst nanoparticles resulted in an appreciable shift of the absorption edge of the ternary hybrids by about 50 nm. The optimized hybrid was found to photodegrade Orange G dye almost quantitatively within 2 h, by simulated solar light irradiation. Scavenging experiments revealed that hydroxy radicals were the main transient intermediate, leading to the oxidative degradation of the dye.</dc:description>

         <title>Deciphering the Differences in Ambident Reactivity between the Cyanate, Thiocyanate Ions, and their P&#8208; and As&#8208;Containing Analogues</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although the cyanate and thiocyanate anions belong to the most known textbook examples of ambident nucleophiles, the electronic factors that determine their markedly differing reactivities are still unclear. Their recently discovered P&#8208; and As&#8208;containing [PCX]&#8211; and [AsCX]&#8211;analogues (X: O, S, Se), whose ambident nature is practically unexplored, may serve as ideal basis for comparison to clarify these differences. Herein we present comprehensive theoretical investigations on the nucleophilic behaviours of the whole set of so far known [ECX]&#8211;(E: N, P, As, X: O, S, Se) anions, aiming for a systematic understanding of the reactivity patterns and deciphering the factors that govern the nucleophilic substitutions. Our results indicate that the SN2 reactions of the O&#8208;containing [ECO]&#8211; ions are thermodynamically preferred at the E pnictogen centres, while the kinetic contributions are only substantial for the N&#8208;containing [NCX]&#8211;anions. The ambident reactivities of the congeners that contain N or O significantly differ from those with P, As, S, or Se heteroatoms, in line with the inert s&#8208;orbital effect, characteristic for the heavier elements. By analysing the electronic structures and bonding patterns of the anions and relevant transition state structures, we offer clear explanations for the differing reactivities of the whole set of [ECX]&#8211;anions.</dc:description>

         <title>Resonance&#8208;Enhanced Emission Effects toward Dual&#8208;State Emissive Bright Red and Near&#8208;infrared Emitters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Resonance&#8208;enhanced emission effect (REE) was discovered and resulted in a novel dye family of hydrostyryl pyridinium derivatives in our recent work. Herein, REE effect was employed to design red and near&#8208;infrared dual&#8208;state emissive fluorophore family of SW&#8208;OH&#8208;NO2s which were further easily synthesized by couple an electron&#8208;withdrawing group (W) onto nitro(hydroxyl)styryl (S&#8208;OH&#8208;NO2) through a C=C double bond as &#960;&#8208;bridge. The deprotonation of phenolic hydroxyl group promoted by nitro group and the electron&#8208;withdrawing group (W) in the other side of &#960;&#8208;bridge triggered resonance and resulting in significantly red&#8208;shifted emission. All the resultant SW&#8208;OH&#8208;NO2s showed excellent dual&#8208;state emission behaviors. Remarkably, hydrostyryl quinolinium (SQ&#8208;OH&#8208;NO2) is one of the smallest NIR emitters molecular skeleton (&#955;em = 725 nm, MW&lt;400) and showed dual&#8208;state emission characteristics and obvious viscosity&#8208;depended fluorescent behaviors. In addition to constructing electron donor&#8208;accepter structure and prolonging &#960;&#8208;bridge, REE effected promised a reliable strategy toward novel fluorophores with small size, long emissive wavelength, and dual&#8208;emission characteristics, and importantly, feasible industrial manufactures and applications due to their easy and low&#8208;cost synthesis strategy.</dc:description>

         <title>Allosteric Tuning of Caspase&#8208;7: Establishing the Nexus of Structure and Catalytic Power</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Caspase&#8208;7 (C7), a cysteine protease involved in apoptosis, is a valuable drug target for its role in human diseases (e.g. Parkinson&#8217;s, Alzheimer&#8217;s, sepsis). The C7 allosteric site has great potential for small molecule targeting, but numerous drug discovery efforts have identified precious few allosteric inhibitors. Here we present the first selective, drug&#8208;like inhibitor of C7 along with several other improved inhibitors based on our previous fragment hit. We also provide a rational basis for the impact of allosteric binding on the C7 catalytic cycle using an integrated approach including X&#8208;ray crystallography, stopped&#8208;flow kinetics, and molecular dynamics simulations. Our findings suggest allosteric binding disrupts C7 pre&#8208;acylation via neutralization of the catalytic dyad, displacement of substrate from the oxyanion hole, and altered dynamics of substrate binding loops. This work advances drug targeting efforts and bolsters our understanding of allosteric structure activity relationships (ASARs).</dc:description>

         <title>BAr2&#8208;bridged Azafulvene Dimers with Tunable Energy Levels for Photostable Near&#8208;infrared Dyes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic dyes with strong absorption in the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region are potentially useful in medical applications such as tumor imaging and photothermal therapy. In this work, we synthesized new NIR dyes combining BAr2&#8208;bridged azafulvene dimer acceptors with diarylaminothienyl donors in a donor&#8722;acceptor&#8722;donor configuration. Surprisingly, we found that in these molecules the BAr2&#8208;bridged azafulvene acceptor adopts a 5&#8208;membered, rather than 6&#8208;membered ring structure. The influence of the aryl substituents on the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the dye compounds was assessed from electrochemical and optical measurements. Strong electron&#8208;withdrawing fluorinated substituents (Ar = C6F5, 3,5&#8208;(CF3)2C6H3) lowered the HOMO energy while preserving the small HOMO&#8211;LUMO energy gap, resulting in promising NIR dye molecules that combine strong absorption bands centered around 900 nm with good photostability.</dc:description>

         <title>Excited state processes in supramolecular complexes of cyclic dibenzopyrrolopyrroles isomers with C60 fullerene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An approach to modulating the properties of carbon nanorings by incorporating pyrrolo[3,2&#8208;b]pyrrole units is of particular interest due to the combined effect of heteroatom and antiaromatic character on electronic properties. The inclusion of units other than phenylene leads to the formation of stereoisomers. In this work, we computationally study how the spatial orientation of monomeric units in the ring affects the properties of cyclic dibenzopyrrolo[3,2&#8208;b]pyrroles and their complexes with C60 fullerene. For [4]PP and [4]DHPP, the most symmetrical AAAA isomer is the most stable and forms stronger interactions with fullerene than the isomers where one or two monomeric units are flipped, mostly due to less Pauli repulsion. p&#8208;Electron delocalization in the monomeric unit is crucial for directing the electron transfer (from or to nanoring). The energy of charge transfer excited states depends on the HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap, which varies from one stereoisomer to another only for [4]DHPP&#8835;C60 with aromatic 1,4&#8208;dihydropyrrolo[3,2&#8208;b]pyrrole units. The rates of electron transfer and charge recombination reactions are relatively weakly dependent of the spatial isomerism of nanorings.</dc:description>

         <title>Ionic Liquid&#8208;Mediated Approach for the Synthesis of Site&#8208;Specific Thioether Conjugates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bioconjugation methodologies have become a central part of therapeutic development. Conjugation of thiol&#8208;containing compounds is now simple with this ionic liquid&#8208;mediated reaction which is site&#8208;specific toward thiol and preserves the stereochemistry. Additionally, Cysteine&#8208;free peptides can be functionalized using the developed technique.







Abstract
Site&#8208;specific conjugation approaches are of great importance in drug discovery, notably for the synthesis of biochemical probes or molecular conjugates for targeted delivery. Herein, we report a mild ionic liquid (IL)&#8208;mediated thiolation technique that relies on the use of 1,3&#8208;ethyl&#8208;methyl imidazolium acetate, [C2mim][OAc] as a solvent and precursor to generate activated IL, as well as a solvent for the conjugation reaction. First, a focused library of active ILs was prepared for functionalizing/conjugating cysteine&#8208;containing small molecules and unprotected peptides. Interestingly, a bifunctional active IL could also be successfully employed as a linker for the conjugation of peptides lacking Cys. This study sets the ground for further investigation of the use of active ILs for modifying, labeling or conjugating larger and more complex therapeutic modalities such as proteins and antibodies.

Abstract
The molecular compound [BiDipp2(SbF6)], containing the bulky, donor&#8208;free bismuth cation [BiDipp2]+ has been synthesized and fully characterized (Dipp=2,6&#8208;iPr2&#8208;C6H3). Using its methyl analog [BiMe2(SbF6)] as a second reference point, the impact of steric bulk on bismuth&#8208;based Lewis acidity was investigated in a combined experimental (Gutmann&#8208;Beckett and modified Gutmann&#8208;Beckett methods) and theoretical approach (DFT calculations). Reactivity studies of the bismuth cations towards [PF6]&#8722; and neutral Lewis bases such as isocyanides C&#8801;NR&#8217; revealed facile fluoride ion abstraction and straightforward Lewis pair formation, respectively. The first examples of compounds featuring bismuth&#8208;bound isocyanides have been isolated and fully characterized.

         <title>Molecular Shape, Electronic Factors, and the Ferroelectric Nematic Phase: Investigating the Impact of Structural Modifications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular shape and its effects: The synthesis and characterisation of two series of low molar mass mesogens is reported comparing the effect of having a lateral alkoxy chain in the central phenyl ring versus the chain being attached to the methoxy&#8208;substituted terminal ring. Rather than the molecule being required to show a tapered shape, it is the role of the lateral chain in inhibiting anti&#8208;parallel associations that is key.







Abstract
The synthesis and characterisation of two series of low molar mass mesogens, the (4&#8208;nitrophenyl) 2&#8208;alkoxy&#8208;4&#8208;(4&#8208;methoxybenzoyl)oxybenzoates (NT3.m) and the (3&#8208;fluoro&#8208;4&#8208;nitrophenyl) 2&#8208;alkoxy&#8208;4&#8208;(4&#8208;methoxybenzoyl)oxybenzoates (NT3F.m), are reported in order to investigate the effect of changing the position of a lateral alkoxy chain from the methoxy&#8208;substituted terminal ring to the central phenyl ring in these two series of materials based on RM734. All members of the NT3.m series exhibited a conventional nematic phase, N, which preceded the ferroelectric nematic phase, NF, whereas all the members of the NT3F.m series exhibited direct NF&#8208;I transitions except for NT3F.1 which also exhibited an N phase. These materials cannot be described as wedge&#8208;shaped, yet their values of the ferroelectric nematic&#8208;nematic transition temperature, T
, exceed those of the corresponding materials with the lateral alkoxy chain located on the methoxy&#8208;substituted terminal ring. In part, this may be attributed to the effect that changing the position of the lateral alkoxy chain has on the electronic properties of these materials, specifically on the electron density associated with the methoxy&#8208;substituted terminal aromatic ring. The value of TNI decreased with the addition of a fluorine atom ortho to the nitro group in NT3F.1, however, the opposite behaviour was found when the transition temperatures of the NF phase were compared which are higher for the NT3F.m series. This may reflect a change in the polarity and polarizability of the NT3F.m series compared to the NT3.m series. Therefore, it is suggested that, rather than simply promoting a tapered shape, the role of the lateral chain in inhibiting anti&#8208;parallel associations and its effect on the electronic properties of the molecules are the key factors in driving the formation of the NF phase.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Molecular shape and its effects&lt;/b&gt;: The synthesis and characterisation of two series of low molar mass mesogens is reported comparing the effect of having a lateral alkoxy chain in the central phenyl ring versus the chain being attached to the methoxy-substituted terminal ring. Rather than the molecule being required to show a tapered shape, it is the role of the lateral chain in inhibiting anti-parallel associations that is key.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The synthesis and characterisation of two series of low molar mass mesogens, the (4-nitrophenyl) 2-alkoxy-4-(4-methoxybenzoyl)oxybenzoates (NT3.&lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;) and the (3-fluoro-4-nitrophenyl) 2-alkoxy-4-(4-methoxybenzoyl)oxybenzoates (NT3F.&lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;), are reported in order to investigate the effect of changing the position of a lateral alkoxy chain from the methoxy-substituted terminal ring to the central phenyl ring in these two series of materials based on RM734. All members of the NT3.&lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt; series exhibited a conventional nematic phase, N, which preceded the ferroelectric nematic phase, N&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;, whereas all the members of the NT3F.&lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt; series exhibited direct N&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;-I transitions except for NT3F.1 which also exhibited an N phase. These materials cannot be described as wedge-shaped, yet their values of the ferroelectric nematic-nematic transition temperature, &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
, exceed those of the corresponding materials with the lateral alkoxy chain located on the methoxy-substituted terminal ring. In part, this may be attributed to the effect that changing the position of the lateral alkoxy chain has on the electronic properties of these materials, specifically on the electron density associated with the methoxy-substituted terminal aromatic ring. The value of &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;NI&lt;/sub&gt; decreased with the addition of a fluorine atom &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt; to the nitro group in NT3F.1, however, the opposite behaviour was found when the transition temperatures of the N&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; phase were compared which are higher for the NT3F.&lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt; series. This may reflect a change in the polarity and polarizability of the NT3F.&lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt; series compared to the NT3.&lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt; series. Therefore, it is suggested that, rather than simply promoting a tapered shape, the role of the lateral chain in inhibiting anti-parallel associations and its effect on the electronic properties of the molecules are the key factors in driving the formation of the N&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; phase.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Fluorescence Detection of the Persistent Organic Pollutant Chlordecone in Water at Environmental Concentrations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorescent cages allow for the detection of the persistent organic pollutant chlordecone in water at environmental concentrations. The reported method is inexpensive, easy to carry out, and of general use for generating many measurements on contaminated water samples. This provides an affordable tool to tackle the major environmental and public health issues associated with chlordecone contamination.







Abstract
Chlordecone (CLD), a Persistent Organic Pollutant, is still present in water and food chain of the French West Indies (FWI), leading to dramatical public health problems. One of the major issues is the lack of an easy, non&#8208;expensive, sensitive and robust method for the detection of chlordecone to ensure chlordecone&#8208;free water and foods for the residents of the FWI. This study reports on the development of a fluorescent molecular cage that allows a simple and convenient detection of chlordecone in water at environmental concentration. The specific structural features of chlordecone prompted the choice of hemicryptophanes as receptor. First, the size, shape of the cavity, as well as the recognition units, were optimized to identify the most efficient non fluorescent host for CLD complexation. Then, this selected compound was equipped with fluorophores at different positions in order to find the most efficient system for CLD detection by fluorescence. Among the two most promising fluorescent cages, the newly synthesized hemicryptophane with biphenyl moieties allowed the development of a fast, easy, reproducible and cheap procedure to detect CLD in water. Based on its sensitivity and scalability, with modulation of hemicryptophane, concentration, CLD concentrations were estimated over five orders of magnitude (10&#8722;2&#8211;103&#8197;&#956;g/L) including the environmental levels of contamination and the permissible limit for drinking water in the FWI.

         <title>Highly Chemoselective Synthesis of Indole Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemoselective electrophilic activation of amides and enols/ketones has been achieved using either Hendrickson reagent in combination with triflic anhydride or triflic acid, which provides an efficient protocol for the divergent synthesis of polysubstituted indoles with flexible substituent patterns from &#945;&#8208;arylamino&#8208;&#946;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;enamides, &#945;&#8208;arylamino&#8208;&#946;&#8208;oxo&#8208;amides or their enol&#8208;keto tautomeric mixture.







Abstract
A facile and efficient synthesis of polysubstituted indoles from &#945;&#8208;arylamino&#8208;&#946;&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;enamides, &#945;&#8208;arylamino&#8208;&#946;&#8208;oxo&#8208;amides, or their tautomeric mixture via electrophilic activation strategy is described. The salient feature of this methodology is the use of either combined Hendrickson reagent and triflic anhydride (Tf2O) or triflic acid (TfOH) to control the chemoselectivity in the intramolecular cyclodehydration to provide a predictable approach to these valuable indoles with flexible substituent patterns. Moreover, the mild reaction conditions, simple execution, high chemoselectivity, excellent yields, and wide range of synthetic potential of products make this protocol much attractive for academic research and practical applications.

         <title>Light&#8208;Triggered Reversible Open&#8208;Close Motion of a Chiral Molecular Plier to Modulate Guest Binding</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Light triggered configuration change (azobenzene) of one end of a molecular plier induces an interlocking motion at the other end (porphyrin unit) of the plier accompanied by a pivotal motion around the BINOL axis. E to Z isomerization decreases the distance between two porphyrin units which could be used for selective binding of pyridine&#8208;appended guests. Guest complexation with the plier increases the isomerization efficiency of azobenzene and decreases the thermal back isomerization rate.







Abstract
A chiral molecular plier's design, synthesis, characterisation and operations are presented. The molecular plier encompasses three units: a BINOL unit which acts as a pivot as well as a chiral inducer, an azobenzene unit, which acts as a photo&#8208;switchable component and two zinc porphyrin, acting as a reporter. E to Z isomerisation persuaded by irradiating with 370&#8197;nm light alters the dihedral angle of the pivot BINOL unit, which adjusts the distance between two porphyrin units. The plier can be switched to its initial state by exposure to 456&#8197;nm light or heating at 50&#8201;&#176;C. NMR, CD and molecular modelling supported the reversible switching and change in dihedral angle and distance between reporter moiety, which was further exploited for binding with several ditopic guests. The longest guest was found to form the strongest complex, R,R&#8208;isomer formed a stronger complex than S,S&#8208;isomer, Z&#8208;isomer of the plier formed stronger complex than the E&#8208;isomer with the guest. Moreover, complexation also increased the E&#8208;to&#8208;Z switching efficiency and decreased the thermal back isomerisation of the azobenzene unit.

         <title>An Umpolung Approach to Acyclic 1,4&#8208;Dicarbonyl Amides via Photoredox&#8208;Generated Carbamoyl Radicals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoredox catalysis is used to generate carbamoyl radicals from oxamate salts. Addition to a range of electron&#8208;poor olefins gives the 1,4&#8208;amido&#8208;carbonyl products in good yields. The reaction proceeds under mild conditions, and a transition metal or organic photocatalyst can be employed.







Abstract
A method for the generation and reaction of carbamoyl radicals from oxamate salts, followed by reaction with electron&#8208;poor olefins, is described. The oxamate salt acts as a reductive quencher in the photoredox catalytic cycle, allowing mild and mass&#8208;efficient formation of 1,4&#8208;dicarbonyl products; a challenging transformation in the context of functionalized amide formation. Increased understanding has been obtained by the use of ab initio calculations, in support of experimental observations. Furthermore, steps have been taken towards an environmentally&#8208;friendly protocol, by utilizing sodium as a cheap and low mass counterion, and demonstrating successful reactions using a metal&#8208;free photocatalyst and a sustainable, non&#8208;toxic solvent system.

Aromatic endoperoxides were synthesized as O2 releasing agents in organic solvent upon irradiation of a photocatalyst in the presence of the precursors in mM concentration. Co&#8208;encapsulation of both reactants in a cyclodextrin polymer allowed to successfully perform the photocatalyzed oxygenation in homogeneous aqueous environment. Controlled release of O2 could be achieved upon thermolysis.







Abstract
In the quest for new therapies targeting hypoxia, aromatic endoperoxides have intriguing potential as oxygen releasing agents (ORAs) able to free O2 in tissues upon suitable trigger. Four aromatic substrates were synthesized and the formation of their corresponding endoperoxides was optimized in organic solvent upon selective irradiation of Methylene Blue, a low&#8208;cost photocatalyst, producing the reactive singlet oxygen species. Complexation of the hydrophobic substrates within a hydrophilic cyclodextrin (CyD) polymer allowed their photooxygenation in homogeneous aqueous environment using the same optimized protocol upon dissolution in water of the three readily accessible reagents. Notably, reaction rates were comparable in buffered D2O and organic solvent and, for the first time, the photooxygenation of highly hydrophobic substrates was achieved for millimolar solutions in non&#8208;deuterated water. Quantitative conversion of the substrates, straightforward isolation of the endoperoxides and recovery of the polymeric matrix were achieved. Cycloreversion of one ORA to the original aromatic substrate was observed upon thermolysis. These results hold great potential for the launch of CyD polymers both as reaction vessels for green, homogeneous photocatalysis and as carrier for the delivery of ORAs in tissues.

         <title>A Highly Active Cobalt Catalyst for the General and Selective Hydrogenation of Aromatic Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly active cobalt catalyst for the selective hydrogenation of aromatic N&#8208;, O&#8208;, and S&#8208;heterocycles was identified. The key is a simple three component catalyst synthesis permitting to optimize the ratio between N&#8208;doped carbon for embedding and the metal species to be embedded.







Abstract
Nanostructured earth abundant metal catalysts that mediate important chemical reactions with high efficiency and selectivity are of great interest. This study introduces a synthesis protocol for nanostructured earth abundant metal catalysts. Three components, an inexpensive metal precursor, an easy to synthesize N/C precursor, and a porous support material undergo pyrolysis to give the catalyst material in a simple, single synthesis step. By applying this catalyst synthesis, a highly active cobalt catalyst for the general and selective hydrogenation of aromatic heterocycles could be generated. The reaction is important with regard to organic synthesis and hydrogen storage. The mild reaction conditions observed for quinolines permit the selective hydrogenation of numerous classes of N&#8208;, O&#8208; and S&#8208;heterocyclic compounds such as: quinoxalines, pyridines, pyrroles, indoles, isoquinoline, aciridine amine, phenanthroline, benzofuranes, and benzothiophenes.

         <title>Tailoring Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding Strategy for Sequence&#8208;Dependent and Thermo/pH Dual&#8208;Responsive Clusteroluminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rational design of monomer sequence for desired properties is challenging. This study investigates the effect of monomer distribution of double hydrophilic copolymers (DHCs) with electron&#8208;rich units on cluster triggered emission (CTE) capacity. By means of combining latent monomer strategy, reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization and selective hydrolysis technology, the random, pseudo di&#8208;block and the gradient DHCs consisting of pH&#8208;responsive polyacrylic acid (PAA) segments and thermo&#8208;responsive poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) segments were successfully synthesized in a controlled manner. Moreover, the gradient DHCs showed a tremendously increased luminescent intensity due to the distinct hydrogen&#8208;bonding interaction compared to random and pseudo di&#8208;block DHCs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported the direct correlation between luminescent intensity and sequence structure of non&#8208;conjugated polymer. Meanwhile, thermo and pH dual&#8208;responsive clusteroluminescence could be easily performed. This work demonstrates a novel and facile method to tailor the hydrogen&#8208;bonding for the stimuli&#8208;responsive light&#8208;emitting polymers.</dc:description>

         <title>Boronic Acid Assisted Self&#8208;Assembly of Functional RNAs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Boronate esters formed by reaction of an oligonucleotide carrying a 5'&#8208;boronic acid moiety with the 3'&#8208;terminal cis&#8208;diol of another have been shown previously to assist assembly of fragmented DNAzymes. Here we demonstrate that boronate esters replacing the natural phosphodiester linkage at selected sites of two functional RNAs, the hairpin ribozyme and the Mango aptamer, allow assembly of functional structures. The hairpin ribozyme, a small naturally occurring RNA that supports the reversible cleavage of appropriate RNA substrates, is very sensitive to fragmentation. Splitting the ribozyme at four different sites led to a significant decrease or even loss of cleavage and ligation activity. Ribozymes assembled from fragments capable of boronate ester formation showed restoration of cleavage activity in some but not all cases, dependent on the split site. Ligation proved to be more challenging, no supportive effect of the boronate ester was observed. Split variants of the Mango aptamer also showed a dramatic loss of functionality, which however, was restored when 5'&#8208;boronic acid modified fragments were used for assembly. These studies show for the first time that boronate esters as internucleoside linkages can act as surrogates of natural phosphodiesters in functional RNA molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Stabilized Thiyl Radicals Design Inspired by Elemental Periodic Extension Notion for Ligand&#8208;based Alkene Addition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inspired by alkene addition to the Ru and Re tris(thiolate) complexes via carbon&#8208;sulfur bond formation/cleavage reactions along with a periodic extension catalysis notion, a comparative study of the electronic structures, mechanisms, and reactivities for ethylene addition to the Os and Tc tris(thiolate) complexes was performed by DFT and high&#8208;level ab initio quantum calculations. The oxidized Os and Tc complexes were revealed to exhibit sufficient radical characters on the ligands to support their reaction with ethylene, whereas neutral Tc complex featuring little thiyl radical character renders no reactivity toward ethylene. Differential reactivities of these tris(thiolate) complexes was deemed to derive from the synergy of the thiyl radical character, the electronegativity, the row, and the charge. Extending from Ru and Re tris(thiolate) complexes to their Os and Tc counterparts can help us to get insightful rationales that would promote further research on alkene addition to metal&#8208;stabilized thiyl radicals.</dc:description>

         <title>A Highly Selective and Quantitative Point&#8208;of&#8208;Care Diagnostic Method for Adrenaline</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Adrenaline, also known as epinephrine, is a neurotransmitter/hormone that is an important target in diagnostics. Development of&#160;an effective method for detecting it in the presence of other neurotransmitters is a challenging task. The electrochemical and fluorescent techniques commonly used have low selectivity in distinguishing among catecholamines. Herein, we report a small molecule organic probe with an activated furfural moiety to exploit the nucleophilicity of epinephrine to generate a bright&#8208;colored donor&#8208;acceptor Stenhouse adduct. Among nine common&#160;neurotransmitters or their&#160;analogues, only epinephrine was found to generate a unique&#160;colour change&#160;discernible with the naked eye, whereas the other ones remain unaffected. Under various in&#8208;field detection conditions, including solution, droplet, and paper strip&#8208;based detection, the&#160;colour change&#160;were also&#160;noticeable. The low detection limit of 1.37 nM and a limit of quantitation of 4.37 nM were achieved with simple UV&#8208;vis methods in addition to the sub&#8208;ppm level sensing under visual conditions with naked eyes. The probe could be used for practical colorimetric measurements as a point&#8208;of&#8208;care tool without any complex and expensive machinery, making this approach accessible to all. In addition, using a simple smartphone, the determination of epinephrine concentrations is possible using machine&#8208;learning techniques.</dc:description>

Preparation of spherical polymeric particles via surfactant&#8208;free RAFT emulsion polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (PISA) with reversible swelling behavior upon UV/Vis light irradiation is described.







Abstract
Responsive photonic crystals (RPCs) assembled by monodisperse colloidal particles have attracted enormous interest recently due to their tremendous applications in smart devices. Their structural colors can be determined by particle sizes. However, the lack of a reliable way to tune the sizes in&#8197;situ limits their development. Herein, we present an efficient route to solve this problem through the fabrication of spherical polymeric particles with light&#8208;triggered reversible swelling behavior via surfactant&#8208;free reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) emulsion polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (PISA). Amphiphilic macro&#8208;RAFT agents containing azobenzene groups were synthesized and subsequently employed to mediate the polymerization of methyl methacrylate. Uniform submicron spheres were obtained by modulating solid contents and other parameters. Benefiting from the photoisomerization of azobenzene moieties, the particle sizes expanded and contracted upon alternative ultraviolet/visible&#8208;light irradiation accordingly. This strategy will be a supplement to the emulsion PISA and especially give aid to the progress of the RPC materials.

         <title>Chemistry, Chemo&#8208;Ecology, and Biological Activities of Uncommon and Structurally Diverse Sesquiterpenoids from the Sanya Bay Nudibranch Hexabranchus sanguineus</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Investigation of the nudibranch Hexabranchus sanguineus from Sanya Bay afforded thirteen new sesquiterpenoids, of which sanyalactams A and B feature an unprecedented hexahydrospiro[indene&#8208;2,3&#8242;&#8208;pyrrolidine] core. A plausible biogenetic relationship between these sesquiterpenoids is proposed and discussed, and a chemo&#8208;ecological relationship of H. sanguineus and its possible sponge preys is analyzed.







Abstract
A detailed chemical investigation of the Sanya Bay nudibranch Hexabranchus sanguineus yielded thirteen new sesquiterpenoids, namely sanyagunins A&#8722;H, sanyalides A&#8722;C, and sanyalactams A and B, along with eleven known related ones. Sanyalactams A and B feature an unprecedented hexahydrospiro[indene&#8208;2,3&#8242;&#8208;pyrrolidine] core. The structures of new compounds were established by a combination of extensive spectroscopic data analysis, quantum mechanical&#8208;nuclear magnetic resonance methods, the modified Mosher's method, and X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. Based on analysis of NOESY correlations and the modified Mosher's method, the stereochemistry of two known furodysinane&#8208;type sesquiterpenoids were revised. A plausible biogenetic relationship between these sesquiterpenoids wasproposed and discussed, and a chemo&#8208;ecological relationship of the title animal and its possible sponge preys has been analyzed. In bioassays, sanyagunin B showed moderate antibacterial activity, whereas 4&#945;&#8208;formamidogorgon&#8208;11&#8208;ene exhibited potent cytotoxicity with IC50 values ranging from 0.87 to 1.95&#8197;&#956;M.

         <title>A Non Expected Alternative Ni(0) Species in the Ni&#8208;Catalytic Aldehyde and Alcohol Arylation Reactions Facilitated by a 1,5&#8208;Diaza&#8208;3,7&#8208;diphosphacyclooctane Ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
As in cross&#8208;coupling reactions, in the alcohol arylation reaction catalysed by a system combining nickel and a 1,5&#8208;diaza&#8208;3,7&#8208;diphosphacyclooctane ligand, the presence of a Ni(0) intermediate is under debate by Density Functional Theory calculations.







Abstract
For decades there were many attempts to dispense with stoichiometric amounts of metal reagents for the synthesis of secondary alcohols. In 2021, the synthetic results of Newman and collaborators pioneered a synthesis still with metals, but not as reactants. Instead, they serverd as catalytic engines. Here we present a description by means of Density Functional Theory calculations of how this process can occur, and an attempt is made to shed light on the mechanism that facilitates the attainment of secondary alcohols, emphasizing the eternal cross&#8208;coupling debate of whether the catalytically active species is Ni(0) or they are really taking shortcuts following the course of Ni(II). Effective Orbital analyses give a clear picture. Furthermore, this paper provides insight not only into the nature of the ligands of the metal catalyst but also the role of the base.

         <title>Control of Selectivity in Homogeneous Catalysis through Noncovalent Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The selectivity directing mission of noncovalent interactions (hydrogen, halogen, chalcogen, pnictogen and tetrel bonds, as well as agostic and &#960;&#8208;interactions) in homogeneous catalysis is highlighted. The origin of the selectivity in noncovalent catalysis has been investigated through experimental and computational methods.







Abstract
The regio&#8208;, site&#8208;, stereo&#8208; or chemoselective homogeneous catalytic transformations are extremely important for the growth/success of the current chemical industry. Based on empirical, theoretical or intuitive knowledge, several synthetic strategies, such as ligand design, transient directing group, metal node alternation, metal&#8208;ligand cooperation, pore decoration, biomimetic, have already been developed for the selective functionalization of organic substrates. In comparison to the other tactics, the use of noncovalent interactions for the control of selectivity in catalytic transformations of organic compounds may avoid multi&#8208;steps, reduce time of synthetic procedure, decrease cost of operation, and increase reactivity of catalyst. In fact, enzymes achieve a high selectivity through noncovalent interactions in biochemical processes in Nature. Guided by the impressive performance of enzymes in biosynthesis and biodegradation reactions, various types of synthetic metal complex or organocatalysts have already been developed, in which the catalyst&#8208;substrate noncovalent interactions have a pivotal impact on the distinctive stabilization of the transition states or intermediates, directing selectivity and improving efficiency of homogeneous catalytic reactions. Herein, we highlight several recent and relevant examples of selectivity directing/driving function of noncovalent interactions in the transformation of organic substrate(s) catalyzed by both organocatalysts and metal complex catalysts.

         <title>Progress in Predicting Ionic Cocrystal Formation: The Case of Ammonium Nitrate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cocrystal design strategies are rapidly evolving to enhance predictive capabilities and improve the efficiency of coformer screening. However, many of the molecular descriptors associated with successful cocrystallization are ambiguous for salts, complicating coformer selection when designing ionic cocrystals. Herein, a study of ammonium nitrate ionic cocrystals reveals packing coefficient as a promising indicator for coformer success.







Abstract
In contrast to the mature predictive frameworks applied to neutral cocrystals, ionic cocrystals, those including an ion pair, are difficult to design. Furthermore, they are generally excluded categorically from studies which correlate specific molecular properties to cocrystal formation, leaving the prospective ionic cocrystal engineer with few clear avenues to success. Herein ammonium nitrate, an energetic oxidizing salt, is targeted for cocrystallization in a potential coformer group selected based on likely interactions with the nitrate ion as revealed in the Cambridge Structural Database; six novel ionic cocrystals were discovered. Molecular descriptors previously identified as being related to neutral cocrystal formation were examined across the screening group but showed no relationship with ionic cocrystal formation. High packing coefficient is shown to be a constant among the successful coformers in the set and is utilized to directly target two more successful coformers, bypassing the need for a large screening group.

A fluorinated DSA derivative with two crystalline polymorphs and a nanocrystal were developed to explore the tricolor luminescence switching properties.

Abstract
A fluorinated distyrylanthracene (DSA) derivative, 9, 10&#8208;bis((E)&#8208;4&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)styryl)anthracene abbreviated as 4FDSA with two crystalline polymorphs (4FDSA&#8208;G (green emission) and 4FDSA&#8208;O (orange emission)), showing remarkable aggregation&#8208;induced enhanced emission and mechanofluorochromic characteristics, was developed. One of the polymorphs in its crystalline arrangement exhibits the hardly seen F&#8230;F interactions. It questions the conventional belief of the non&#8208;polarisable nature of fluorine atoms in forming the halogen bond. The twisted molecular conformation facilitated by the various supramolecular interactions resulted in the formation of another intensely emissive bluer nanocrystal (4FDSA&#8208;NC) at aggregating conditions. Even though, the both polymorphs show distinct tricolor luminescence switching on the action of mechanical force, fumigation of ground crystals with solvent vapor resulted in the formation of a more thermodynamically favorable 4FDSA&#8208;NC form. The work demonstrates the effect of supramolecular interactions assisted conformational changes in tuning the unique mechanofluorochromic characteristics of the polymorphic crystals.

         <title>Dioxygen Binding Is Controlled by the Protein Environment in Non&#8208;heme FeII and 2&#8208;Oxoglutarate Oxygenases: A Study on Histone Demethylase PHF8 and an Ethylene&#8208;Forming Enzyme</title>

         <dc:description>
The cover shows the oxygen diffusion channel in class&#8197;7 histone demethylase (PHF8) and ethylene&#8208;forming enzyme (EFE). PHF8 catalyzes the hydroxylation of its H3&#8197;K9me2 histone substrate, and EFE catalyzes two competing reactions of ethylene generation and substrate l&#8208;Arg hydroxylation. Although both enzymes initially have an off&#8208;line 2&#8208;oxoglutarate (2OG) conformation, upon oxygen binding, PHF8 forms an in&#8208;line superoxo complex, whereas EFE uses the off&#8208;line superoxo complex. More information can be found in the Research Article by C.&#8197;Z. Christov and co&#8208;workers. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202300138).

         <title>Bonding in Low&#8208;Coordinated Organoarsenic and Organoantimony Compounds: A Threshold Photoelectron Spectroscopic Investigation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Methyl and methylene compounds of arsenic and antimony are studied by photoelectron photoion coincidence spectroscopy to investigate their relative stability. While for As both HAs=CH2, As&#8208;CH3 and the methylene compound As=CH2 are identified in the spectrum, the only Sb compound observed is Sb&#8208;CH3. Thus, there is a step in the main group 15 between As and Sb, regarding the relative stability of the methyl compounds. Ionization energies, vibrational frequencies and spin&#8208;orbit splittings are determined for the methyl compound from photoion mass&#8208;selected photoelectron spectra. Although the spectroscopic results for organoantimony resemble those for the previously investigated bismuth compounds, EPR spectroscopic experiments indicate for Sb(CH3)3 a far lower tendency for methyl transfer compared to Bi(CH3)3. The present study concludes investigations on low&#8208;valent organopnictogen compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Electronic and Charge Transport Properties in Bridged versus Unbridged Nanohoops: The Role of the Nanohoop Size.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the field of p&#8208;conjugated nanohoops, the size of the macrocycle has a huge impact on its structural characteristics, which in turn affect its electronic properties. In this work, we report the first experimental investigations linking the size of a nanohoop to its charge transport properties, a key property in organic electronics. We describe the synthesis and the study of the first example of cyclocarbazole possessing five constituting building units, namely [5]&#8209;cyclo&#8208;N&#8208;butyl&#8208;2,7&#8208;carbazole [5]C&#8209;Bu&#8208;Cbz. By comparison with a shorter analogue, [4]&#8209;cyclo&#8208;N&#8208;butyl&#8208;2,7&#8208;carbazole [4]C&#8209;Bu&#8208;Cbz, we detail the photophysical, electrochemical, morphological and charge transport properties, highlighting the key role played by the hoop size. Particularly, we show that the saturated field effect mobility of [5]C&#8209;Bu&#8208;Cbz is four times higher than that of its smaller analogue [4]C&#8209;Bu&#8208;Cbz (4.22 &#215; 10&#8209;5vs 1.04 &#215; 10&#8209;5 cm&#178;.V&#8208;1.s&#8208;1). However, the study of the other OFET characteristics (threshold voltage VTH and subthreshold slope SS) suggest that a small nanohoop is beneficial for a good organization of the molecules in thin films whereas a large one increases the density of structural defects, and hence of traps for the charge carriers. The present findings are of interest for the further development of nanohoops in electronics.</dc:description>

         <title>Minimizing Product Inhibition in DNA Self&#8208;Replication: Insights for Prebiotic Replication from the Role of the Enzyme in Lesion&#8208;Induced DNA Amplification</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Self&#8208;replication of nucleic acids in the absence of enzymes represents an important and poorly understood step in the origin of life as such reported&#160;systems are strongly hindered by product inhibition. Studying one of the few successful examples of enzymatic DNA self&#8208;replication based on a simple ligation chain reaction, lesion&#8208;induced DNA amplification (LIDA), can shed light on how this fundamental process may have originally evolved. To identify the unknown factors that lead LIDA to overcome product inhibition&#160;we have employed isothermal titration calorimetry&#160;and global fitting of time&#8208;dependent ligation data to characterize the individual steps of the amplification process. We find that incorporating the abasic lesion into one of the four primers substantially decreases the stability difference between the product and intermediate complexes compared with complexes without the abasic group. In the presence of T4 DNA ligase this stability gap is further reduced by two orders of magnitude revealing that&#160;the ligase also helps overcome product inhibition. Kinetic simulations reveal&#160;that the intermediate complex stability and the magnitude of the ligation rate constant significantly impact the rate of self&#8208;replication, suggesting that catalysts that both facilitate ligation and stabilize the intermediate complex might be a route to efficient nonenzymatic replication.</dc:description>

         <title>Unique Tubular BiOBr/g&#8208;C3N4 Heterojunction with Efficient Separation of Charge Carriers for Photocatalytic Nitrogen Fixation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The industrial ammonia synthesis process consumes a lot of energy and causes serious environmental pollution. As a sustainable approach for ammonia synthesis, photocatalytic nitrogen reduction employing water as the reducing agent has a lot of potential. A simple surfactant&#8208;assisted solvothermal method is used to synthesize g&#8208;C3N4 nanotubes with flower&#8208;like spherical BiOBr grown inside and outside (BiOBr/g&#8208;C3N4, BC). The hollow tubular structure realizes the full use of visible light by the multi&#8208;scattering effect of light. Large surface areas and more active sites for N2 adsorption and activation are present in the distinctive spatially dispersed hierarchical structures. Particularly, the quick separation and transfer of electrons and holes are facilitated by the sandwich tubular heterojunctions and tight contact interface of BiOBr and g&#8208;C3N4. The maximal NH3 generation rate of the BiOBr/g&#8208;C3N4 composite catalysts can reach 255.04 &#956;mol&#183;g&#8208;1&#183;h&#8208;1, and it is 13.9 and 5.8 times that of pure BiOBr and g&#8208;C3N4. This work provides a novel method for designing and constructing unique heterojunctions for efficient photocatalytic nitrogen fixation.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;pot Synthesis of 2&#8208;Aminoindole through SET Oxidative Cyclization: Concise Synthesis of Tryptanthrin &amp; Phaitanthrin E</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An efficient domino approach for the synthesis of biologically important 2&#8208;aminoindole derivatives has been developed using CuBr2&#8208;mediated SET oxidative cyclization as a key step. This one&#8208;pot multicomponent strategy utilizes readily available ethyl propiolate, tosyl azide and substituted aryl amines as starting materials. The generality and scope of this mild method are demonstrated with a wide variety of substrates to furnish functionalized 2&#8208;aminoindoles in good yields. The synthetic power of this strategy is further exemplified in the concise synthesis of biologically important alkaloids, Phaitanthrin E and Tryptanthrin.</dc:description>

         <title>Negative Homotropic Cooperativity in Guest Binding of a Trisporphyrin Double Cleft</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The&#160;negative homotropic allostery of a triple&#8208;layered trisporphyrin cleft with two guest binding sites was confirmed. The X&#8208;ray crystal structures of the 1:2 host&#8208;guest complexes showed that the trisporphyrin accommodated two guest molecules within the cleft via &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking and donor&#8208;acceptor interactions. In solution,&#160;1H NMR and Job plots showed 1:2 host&#8208;guest complexes. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and UV/vis absorption spectroscopy were employed to evaluate the binding constants and cooperativities. The guest binding of the trisporphyrin showed negative cooperativity and noncooperativity depending on the structures of the guest molecules. The correlations between the interaction parameters (&#945;) and Hill constants were determined. ITC experiments showed that the host&#8208;guest complexation of trisporphyrin with electron&#8208;deficient guests incurred an enthalpy penalty in the successive guest binding process. DFT calculations revealed that the first guest binding reduced the electron density of the central porphyrin plane, which led to an energetic penalty that weakened the successive binding process.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoluminescent Properties and Mechanism of Novel Cyanine&#8208;Borondifluoride Curcuminoid Hybrids as Red&#8208;to&#8208;Near Infrared and Endoplasmic Reticulum&#8208;Targeting Dyes</title>

Seeing red: A series of cyanine&#8208;borondifluoride curcuminoid hybrids called Nanchang Red (NCR) dyes have been obtained as novel red&#8208;to&#8208;NIR fluorophores with ER self&#8208;targeting capability. Their photoluminescent properties and mechanism have been revealed.







Abstract
Synthesis&#8208;oriented design led us to the discovery of a series of novel cyanine&#8208;borondifluoride curcuminoid hybrids called Nanchang Red (NCR) dyes that overcome the intrinsic low synthetic yields of symmetrical cyanine&#8208;difluoroboronate (BF2)&#8208;hybridized NIR dyes. The hybridization endows NCR dyes with high molar extinction coefficients, efficient red&#8208;to&#8208;NIR emission, and enlarged Stokes shifts. Quantum chemical calculations revealed that the asymmetrical layout of the three key electron&#8208;withdrawing and electron&#8208;donating fragments results in a special pattern of partial charge separation and inconsistent degrees of charge delocalization on their &#960;&#8208;conjugated backbones. While the nature of the hemicyanine fragment exerts significant influence on the excitation modes of NCR dyes, the borondifluoride hemicurcuminoid fragment is the major contributor to the enlarged Stokes shifts. Cell imaging experiments illustrated that a subtle change in the N&#8208;heterocycle of the hemicyanine fragment has a remarkable effect on the subcellular localization of NCR dyes. Unlike other previously reported cyanine&#8208;BF2 hybridized dyes, which mainly target mitochondria, the benzothiazole and indole&#8208;based NCR dyes accumulate in both the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and lipid droplets of HeLa cells, whereas the benzoxazole and quinoline&#8208;based NCR dyes stain the ER specifically.

         <title>Assembling Artificial Photosynthetic Models in Water Using &#946;&#8208;Cyclodextrin&#8208;Conjugated Phthalocyanines as Building Blocks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two water&#8208;soluble zinc(II) phthalocyanines substituted with two or four permethylated &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin&#160;(&#946;&#8208;CD)&#160;moieties at the &#945; positions&#160;have been utilized as building blocks for the construction of artificial photosynthetic models in water. The hydrophilic and bulky &#946;&#8208;CD moieties not only can increase the water solubility of the phthalocyanine core and prevent its stacking in water but can also bind with a tetrasulfonated zinc(II) porphyrin (ZnTPPS) and/or sodium 2&#8208;anthraquinonesulfonate (AQ) in water through host&#8208;guest interactions. The binding interactions of these species have been studied spectroscopically, while the photoinduced processes of the resulting complexes have been investigated using&#160;steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved spectroscopic methods. In the ternary complexes,&#160;the ZnTPPS units serve as light&#8208;harvesting antennas to capture the light energy and transfer it to the&#160;phthalocyanine core via efficient excitation energy transfer.&#160;The excited phthalocyanine is&#160;subsequently&#160;quenched&#160;by the electron&#8208;deficient&#160;AQ&#160;units&#160;through electron transfer.&#160;Femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy provides clear evidence for the singlet&#8208;singlet energy transferfrom the photo&#8208;excited ZnTPPS to&#160;the&#160;phthalocyanine&#160;core with a rate constant (kENT)&#160;in the order of&#160;109&#160;s&#8208;1.&#160;Thepopulation of phthalocyanine radical cations indicates the occurrence of electron transfer from the excited phthalocyanine to the AQ moieties, forming a charge&#8208;separated state.</dc:description>

         <title>A Novel Electrocatalyst Pd(II)@Ni3(HITP)2 for Ultrasensitive Detection of Chloramphenicol: Experimental and Computational Investigation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel electrocatalyst Pd(II)@Ni3(HITP)2 was designed and synthesized for chloramphenicol (CAP) detection. An ultra&#8208;low limit of detection (LOD) of 0.2&#8197;nM was achieved by Pd(II)@Ni3(HITP)2 and its loading mechanism was investigated in theory and experiment.







Abstract
Ultrasensitive electrochemical detection on hazardous substances like antibiotics and pesticides is essential but still challenging in rapid test technology. Herein, the first electrode using highly conductive metal&#8211;organic frameworks (HCMOFs) for electrochemical detection of chloramphenicol is proposed. The design of electrocatalyst Pd(II)@Ni3(HITP)2 with ultra&#8208;sensitivity in detection of chloramphenicol is demonstrated by loading Pd onto HCMOFs. An ultra&#8208;low limit of detection (LOD) of 0.2&#8197;nM (64.6&#8197;pg/mL) was observed for these materials, which is 1&#8211;2 orders of magnitude lower than the other reported materials for chromatographic detection. Moreover, the proposed HCMOFs showed long&#8208;time stability over 24&#8197;h. The superior detection sensitivity can be attributed to the high conductivity of Ni3(HITP)2, and the large Pd loading. The experimental characterizations and computational investigation determined the Pd loading mechanism in Pd(II)@Ni3(HITP)2, revealing PdCl2 adsorption on the abundant adsorption sites of Ni3(HITP)2. The proposed electrochemical sensor design using HCMOFs was demonstrated to be both effective and efficient, showing that the adoption of HCMOFs decorated with other effective electrocatalysts, which combine high conductivity and high catalytic activity, is of great advantage for ultrasensitive detection.

         <title>BODIPY&#8208;Perylene Charge Transfer Compounds; Sensitizers for Triplet&#8208;Triplet Annihilation Up&#8208;conversion</title>

BODIPY heterochromophores, unsymmetrically substituted with perylene and/or iodine at the 2 and 6 positions are prepared and investigated as sensitizers for triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation up conversion (TTA&#8208;UC).







Abstract
BODIPY heterochromophores, asymmetrically substituted with perylene and/or iodine at the 2 and 6 positions were prepared and investigated as sensitizers for triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation up conversion (TTA&#8208;UC). Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallographic analyses show that the torsion angle between BODIPY and perylene units lie between 73.54 and 74.51, though they are not orthogonal. Both compounds show intense, charge transfer absorption and emission profiles, confirmed by resonance Raman spectroscopy and consistent with DFT calculations. The emission quantum yield was solvent dependent but the emission profile remained characteristic of CT transition across all solvents explored. Both BODIPY derivatives were found to be effective sensitizers of TTA&#8208;UC with perylene annihilator in dioxane and DMSO. Intense anti&#8208;Stokes emission was observed, and visible by eye from these solvents. Conversely, no TTA&#8208;UC was observed from the other solvents explored, including from non&#8208;polar solvents such as toluene and hexane that yielded brightest fluorescence from the BODIPY derivatives. In dioxane, the power density plots obtained were strongly consistent with TTA&#8208;UC and the power density threshold, the Ith value (the photon flux at which 50&#8201;% of &#934;TTAUC is achieved), for B2PI was observed to be 2.5x lower than of B2P under optimal conditions, an effect ascribed to the combined influence of spin&#8208;orbit charge transfer intersystem crossing (SOCT&#8208;ISC) and heavy metal on the triplet state formation for B2PI.

         <title>Mechanism and Origins of Site&#8208;Selectivity of Template&#8208;Directed C&#8722;H Insertion of Quinolines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Not so simple: Modern computational chemistry (DFT on reaction coordinates, extensive conformational searches, multiple means of treating entropy) has been used to probe the mechanism of a complex organometallic reaction &#8211; template&#8208;directed C&#8722;H insertion of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters into quinoline &#8211; providing a deep dive into the origins of site selectivity and demonstrating that previous simple models are not sufficient.







Abstract
The template&#8208;directed C&#8722;H insertion of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters into quinoline was interrogated by using computational quantum chemistry. An energetically viable mechanism for this complex multistep transformation was elucidated, with attention paid throughout to conformational flexibility and alternative ligand binding modes. The selectivity was found to correlate with distortion from a tetrahedral geometry for the carbon atom involved in C&#8722;H insertion, a parameter that can be applied to future template design.

         <title>Synthesis, Stepwise Bromination, and Functionalization of Picene Diimide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel MCI building block: picene diimide (PiDI) was successfully synthesized. The PiDI derivative PiDI&#8208;CN4 exhibited excellent OFET performance with optimal electron mobility of 0.073&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1.







Abstract
Materials Synthesis and Processing Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) diimides are indispensable candidates for n&#8208;type organic semiconductors in organic optoelectronic devices. Developing new PAH diimide building blocks are of remarkable significance for material diversity and further advance in organic semiconductors. In this contribution, 4,5,8,9&#8208;picene diimide (PiDI) was designed and synthesized. Controllable stepwise bromination of PiDI were accomplished to afford 13&#8208;monobromo&#8208;, 13,14&#8208;dibromo&#8208;, 2,13,14&#8208;tribromo&#8208; and 2,11,13,14&#8208;tetrabromo&#8208;PiDI. Moreover, cyanation of 2,11,13,14&#8208;tetrabromo&#8208;PiDI gave the corresponding tetracyanated PiDI, which can be utilized as n&#8208;type semiconductor with OFET electron mobility up 0.073&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1. This result demonstrates the potential of PiDI as a building block for constructing new high&#8208;performance electronic&#8208;transporting materials.

         <title>Reduction&#8208;triggered Disassembly of Organic Cationic Nanorods Produces a Cysteine Protease Mimic (Miravet et&#8197;al.)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The triggered disassembly of nanorods produces an effective enzyme mimic, a process related to complex biological systems as cyclic AMP&#8208;dependent protein kinase. An insoluble cysteine protease mimic precursor is incorporated into soluble cationic rods in the presence of cationic surfactants. Reduction of the disulfide unit provokes rod disassembly and generation of a cysteine protease mimic, producing an extraordinary acceleration of PNPA hydrolysis.







Abstract
The emergence of catalytic activity associated with a disassembly process is reported, reminiscent of complex biological systems. A cystine derivative with pendant imidazole groups self&#8208;assembles into cationic nanorods in the presence of the cationic surfactants cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC) or cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB). Disulfide reduction triggers nanorod disassembly and the generation of a simple cysteine protease mimic, which shows a dramatically improved catalytic efficiency in the hydrolysis of p&#8208;nitrophenyl acetate (PNPA).

         <title>An Intelligent Laser&#8208;Free Photodynamic Therapy Based on Endogenous miRNA&#8208;Amplified CRET Nanoplatform**</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Laser&#8208;free photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a promising noninvasive therapeutic modality for deep&#8208;seated tumor, yet is constrained by the low efficiency due to the limited stimulation strategies. Herein, a novel miRNA&#8208;responsive laser&#8208;free PDT was developed through metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs)&#8208;mediated chemiluminescence resonance energy transfer (CRET) nanoplatform. The photosensitizer chlorin e6 (Ce6)&#8208;loaded MOFs were functionalized with hairpin nucleic acids for sensitive responsiveness of tumor biomarker miRNA through catalytic hairpin assembly (CHA), which enabled the amplified assembly of horseradish peroxidase (HRP)&#8208;mimicking hemin/G&#8208;quadruplex DNAzyme on MOFs. Simultaneously, the on&#8208;MOF assembled DNAzymes efficiently catalyzed chemiluminescence reaction to stimulate adjacent Ce6 in the presence of luminol and H2O2, thus allowing the CRET&#8208;mediated Ce6 luminescence and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation for self&#8208;illuminating PDT. The CRET nanoplatform achieved significant malignant cell apoptosis and tumor inhibition effects without external laser irradiation. It is envisioned that the microRNA&#8208;amplified CRET nanoplatform might be a selective and highly efficient antitumor nanomedicine for precise theranostic.</dc:description>

         <title>Antimony Oxides&#8208;Based Anode Materials for Alkali Metal&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>With the increasing demand for renewable energy, alkali metal&#8208;ion (lithium/sodium/potassium&#8208;ion) batteries play more and more important roles in the field of static storage and electrical vehicle industry. Novel anode materials with high reversible capacity, safety and long&#8208;term cycling stability are desiderated to meet the ever&#8208;growing demand for alkali metal&#8208;ion batteries with high electrochemical performance.

         <title>Oxidized Bridged Carbenoids as Viable Intermediates in a Fe(III) Catalyzed C&#8211;H Insertion Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fe catalyzed carbene insertion reactions present an efficient route for direct C&#8211;H functionalization. The use of Fe(III) in place of the widely used Fe(II) presents several benefits. However, the mechanistic understanding of Fe(III) severely lags behind Fe(II) complexes. One of the major unsolved issues relates to the formation of bridged versus terminal metallocarbenes. Even though the oxidized bridged carbenoid complexes have been isolated and found to be thermodynamically more stable, they are generally considered a dead end for the catalytic cycle. In the current report, the formation and the subsequent reactions of the bridged carbenoid complexes for an Fe(TPP)Cl catalyzed C(sp2)&#8211;H insertion are investigated. Using DFT calculations, it is observed that both mono and bis oxidized bridged carbenoid complexes can participate in the catalytic cycle. Importantly, for the first time, a mechanistic pathway showing that these bridged species are not a dead end in Fe catalysis is presented. Their existence in other reactions might be more prevalent than what is currently believed. The current study will have important implications in utilizing Fe(III) complexes for other insertion reactions, especially for heme containing enzymes which necessarily need to be carried out under anaerobic/reducing conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Trumpet&#8208;like ZnS@C composite for&#160;high&#8208;performance potassium ion battery anode</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>ZnS&#160;has acquired increasing attention for high&#8208;performance PIBs anode because of its remarkable theoretical capacity, and redox reversibility for conversion reaction. However, the larger volume variation and delayed reaction kinetics for the ZnS&#160;in the discharge/charge&#160;processes lead to pulverization and severe capacity degradation.&#160;Herein, the trumpet&#8208;like ZnS@C composite was synthesized by template method using sodium citrate as carbon source followed by vulcanization process. As potassium ion batteries (PIB) anode, ZnS@C composite exhibits good rate performance and long life (stable reversible capacity of 107.8 mAh/g over 2000 charge&#8208;discharge cycles at 5 A/g and high reversible capacity of 310 mAh/g at 0.1 A/g). The outstanding electrochemical performance of the ZnS@C composite is ascribed to its unique structure, which can mitigate the volume expansion of ZnS in the charge discharge process, expand the contact area between the electrode and electrolyte, and improve the conductivity of electrode materials by the introduction of carbon layer. This method of synthesizing trumpet&#8208;like ZnS@C composite provides an important strategy for obtaining potassium ion batteries anode with long cycle.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Efficient Wavelength&#8208;Tunable Circularly Polarized Luminescence Film Constructed by Responsive Chiral Aggregation&#8208;induced Emission Luminophore</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Circularly polarized luminescent (CPL) materials with multitudinous inherent advantages shows extensive application. In this work, we prepare a kind of highly efficient wavelength&#8208;tunable CPL free&#8208;standing films by responsive chiral aggregation&#8208;induced emission mesogen. Firstly, the pyridine&#8208;functionalized tetraphenylethene monomer (MPy) is designed and synthesized. Then, the different ration of the monomer MPy mixed with the liquid crystal (LC) reactive monomer (LC242) to fabricate a free&#8208;standing film by photopolymerization. The obtained film presents efficient CPL with a constant luminescence asymmetry factor (glum) of +0.75, as well as sensitive wavelength tunability. Finally, this wavelength&#8208;tunable CPL film with both fluorescence and CPL modes is successfully applied in anti&#8208;counterfeiting and information encryption. This work provides a simple way to construct CPL apparatus with adjustable luminescence wavelength and high glum.</dc:description>

         <title>Bis[1]benzothieno[1,4]thiaborins as a Platform for BODIPY Singlet Oxygen Photosensitizers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A synthetic approach to two regioisomeric &#960;&#8208;electron extended [1,4]thiaborins anellated with two benzothiophene units was developed. Obtained boracycles exhibit different electronic properties of the central thiaborin ring reflected in their different aromatic characters, boron Lewis acidity and UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopic behavior. Thiaborins were converted to boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY) complexes. Their emission spectra exhibit two distinct bands resulting from 1LE and 1CT transitions. Strong near infrared phosphorescence in Zeonex thin films at 77 K indicates efficient intersystem crossing and formation of triplet states. Separation of HOMO and LUMO orbitals between boracyclic and BODIPY moieties facilitates the electron transfer to a 1CT state followed by a transition to the 3LE triplet state located on the ligand. These unique properties of spiro thiaborin&#8208;BODIPY complexes were explored for their application as singlet&#8208;oxygen photosensitizers. They show excellent photocatalytic performance with singlet oxygen quantum yields reaching 77% and full conversion of the model organic substrate achieved after 1.5 h with only 0.05% mol catalyst load.</dc:description>

         <title>(3+2)&#8208;Cyclization reactions of unsaturated phosphonites with aldehydes and thioketones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>By exploiting the unique reactivity of ethynyl&#8208;phosphonites we obtain novel P(V)&#8208;containing five&#8208;membered heterocycles via (3+2)&#8208;cyclization reactions with aldehydes or cycloaliphatic thioketones in satisfactory to excellent yields. Whereas reactions with thioketones to yield 1,3&#8208;thiaphospholes&#8208;3&#8208;oxides occur smoothly at room temperature with equimolar amounts of the starting materials in absence of any catalyst, the analogous conversions with aldehydes to generate 3&#8208;oxides of 1,3&#8208;oxaphospholes require addition of triethylamine as a base. We postulate a step&#8208;wise (3+2)&#8208;cyclization mechanism for the formation of the 1,3&#8208;thiaphosphole ring based on DFT quantum chemical calculations. With this study, we introduce new cyclization reactions originating from unsaturated phosphonites as central synthetic building blocks to yield previously inaccessible stable phosphorus&#8208;containing heterocycles with unexplored potential for the molecular sciences.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Regioselective di&#8208;functionalization of a cyclodextrin allows hydrophobic domains to be directed in a geometrically controlled manner. This controlled orientation ultimately gives access to an original hierarchical assembly in the solid state. This assembly spans over three levels of hierarchy which are governed by synergistic host&#8208;guest inclusions, directed hydrophobic effect and hydrogen bonding. This combination of interactions precisely positioned in space through regioselective functionalization of a cyclodextrin creates a porous organic architecture.</dc:description>

         <title>Redox reporter &#8211; ligand competition to support signaling in the cocaine&#8208;binding electrochemical aptamer&#8208;based biosensor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical aptamer&#8208;based (E&#8208;AB) biosensors have demonstrated capabilities in monitoring molecules directly in undiluted complex matrices and in the body with the hopes of addressing personalized medicine challenges. This sensing platform relies on an electrode&#8208;bound, redox&#8208;reporter&#8208;modified aptamer. The electrochemical signal is thought to originate from the aptamer undergoing a binding&#8208;induced conformational change capable of moving the redox reporter closer to the electrode surface. While this is the generally accepted mechanism, it is notable that there is limited evidence demonstrating conformational change or distance&#8208;dependent change in electron transfer rates in E&#8208;AB sensors. In response, we investigate here the signal transduction of the well&#8208;studied cocaine&#8208;binding aptamer with different analytical methods and found that this sensor relies on a redox&#8208;reporter &#8211; ligand competition mechanism rather than a ligand&#8208;induced structure formation mechanism. Our results show that the covalently bound redox reporter, methylene blue, binds at or near the ligand binding site on the aptamer resulting in a folded conformation of the cocaine&#8208;binding aptamer. Addition of ligand then competes with the redox reporter for binding, altering its electron transfer rate. While we show this for the cocaine&#8208;binding aptamer, given the prevalence of methylene blue in E&#8208;AB sensors, a similar competition&#8208;based may occur in other systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Rationalizing the Extent of the &#8220;Sergeants&#8208;and&#8208;Soldiers&#8221; Effect in Supramolecular Helical Catalysts: Effect of Copper Coordination</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lower optical purities of supramolecular helical catalysts embedding a low fraction of &#8220;sergeants&#8221; is due to the aggregation of single helices through copper crosslinks.[MR1]&#160;







Abstract
Aggregation of supramolecular helices, for example through interdigitation of their alkyl side chains or through more directional supramolecular interactions, leads to hierarchical architectures with original structural and chiroptical properties. However, when a chiral monomer (the &#8220;sergeant&#8221;) is introduced as a minor component in these assemblies composed of a majority of achiral monomers (the &#8220;soldiers&#8221;), it is not clear how the aggregation changes the ability of the sergeant to induce a preferential helicity to the polymer main chain (the so&#8208;called &#8220;sergeants&#8208;and&#8208;soldiers&#8221; effect). This study reports a detailed investigation of the influence of [Cu(OAc)2&#8901;H2O] coordination on the structure and chiroptical properties of helical hydrogen&#8208;bonded co&#8208;assemblies composed of a catalytically&#8208;active benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;tricarboxamide (BTA) monomer, acting as the &#8220;soldier&#8221;, and an enantiopure BTA monomer derived from cyclohexylalanine, playing the role of the &#8220;sergeant&#8221;. The copper actually significantly influences the extent of the &#8220;sergeants&#8208;and&#8208;soldiers&#8221; effect since it acts as a crosslink that induces some chiral defects in the supramolecular helices. These crosslinks appear to be preserved during the catalytic hydrosilylation of 4&#8208;nitroacetophenone. The aggregation of helices through the formation of copper crosslinks is reversible since homochiral single helices are exclusively formed in the case of sergeant&#8208;rich assemblies. The fact that both main chain and side chain aggregation affects the chiroptical properties of supramolecular helices must be considered in the design of elaborated chiral materials.

         <dc:description>
We have reported discovered pentafluorophenol to be an effective catalyst for the Pictet&#8208;Spengler reaction, which synthesizes to synthesize (spirocyclic) tetrahydro &#946; carbolines. This simple catalytic methodology uses features mild conditions to generate high yields of indole alkaloids to produce indole alkaloids in high yield with remarkable functional group tolerance, including late&#8208;stage modifications. This strategy demonstrates a practical approach for synthesizing to the synthesis of the natural alkaloid Komavine on a gram&#8208;scale, as well as the synthesis of the commercial drug Tadalafil.







Abstract
Herein, we have disclosed pentafluorophenol as an operative catalyst for synthesizing (spirocyclic) tetrahydro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;carbolines via the Pictet&#8208;Spengler reaction. This straightforward catalytic protocol works under mild conditions resulting indole alkaloids in excellent yield with remarkable functional group tolerance, including late&#8208;stage modifications. This transformation demonstrates a practical and adaptable approach to produce a highly effective gram&#8208;scale synthesis of the natural alkaloid Komavine and enables the synthesis of the commercial drug Tadalafil.

Color&#8208;tunable luminescence materials: Homonuclear EuP and TbP as well as chemically and physically mixed Eu/Tb phosphonates exhibit color&#8208;tunable luminescence even near white&#8208;light emission, among which TbP is further used for Fe3+ detection.







Abstract
Molecular lanthanide phosphonates [Ln2(H3tpmm)2(H2O)6]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;xH2O (Ln=Eu, EuP; Ln=Tb, TbP) were synthesized. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction confirmed that EuP has a sandwich&#8208;like dinuclear structure, in which the Eu(III) center adopts a {EuO8} distorted dodecahedral geometry. XRPD patterns prove that TbP and EuP are isomorphous and isostructural. EuP and TbP are highly thermally stable approaching 450&#8201;&#176;C and exhibit red&#8208; and green&#8208;light emissions from the characteristic 4&#8201;f&#8211;4&#8201;f transition of the Eu3+ and Tb3+, respectively. Interestingly, luminescence modulation is achieved for the chemically mixed Eu/Tb phosphonate analogues, c&#8208;EuxTb2&#8211;xP (x=1.5, 1, 0.5), and physically mixed Eu/Tb phosphonate materials, p&#8208;yEuP&#8201;:&#8201;zTbP (y&#8201;:&#8201;z=3&#8201;:&#8201;1, 1&#8201;:&#8201;1, 1&#8201;:&#8201;3), with varying the excitation wavelength. Of particular note, near&#8208;white&#8208;light emission is also achieved for c&#8208;EuTbP, p&#8208;EuP&#8201;:&#8201;TbP, and p&#8208;EuP&#8201;:&#8201;3TbP when excited at 365&#8197;nm. Therefore, these dinuclear molecular lanthanide phosphonates emitting excitation wavelength and Eu3+&#8201;:&#8201;Tb3+ ratio dependent luminescence might be potential candidates for color&#8208;tunable luminescence materials and white&#8208;light&#8208;emitting materials. On the other hand, the bright green&#8208;light emission makes TbP to be an excellent reusable luminescence sensor for selective detection of Fe3+ with Stern&#8208;Volmer quenching constant (KSV) of 9.66&#215;103&#8197;M&#8722;1 and detection limit (DL) of 0.42&#8197;&#956;M through absorption competition caused luminescence quenching effect.

         <title>Pro&#8208;aromaticity Enabled Dealkenylative Functionalizations via Photo&#8208;Excitation and Oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dealkenylative Giese&#8208;type addition, hydrazination, borylation, Minisci&#8208;type alkylation, copper&#8208;catalyzed NH alkylation, acylation, alkynylation, cyanation, and azidation, have been achieved on olefin&#8208;containing substrates in a one&#8208;pot and highly modular fashion.







Abstract
A general and practical approach for diverse dealkenylative functionalization of olefin&#8208;containing substrates has been developed through the one&#8208;pot formation and utilization of pro&#8208;aromatic 1,4&#8208;dihydropyridazines using tetrazine as the key cycloaddition reagent. Triggered by either excitation or oxidation, the targeted C&#8722;C bonds in the 1,4&#8208;dihydropyridazine intermediates could be readily cleaved to generate alkyl radicals for subsequent transformations. Diverse carbon&#8208;carbon and carbon&#8208;hetero bond forming protocols, including Giese&#8208;type addition, hydrazination, borylation, Minisci&#8208;type alkylation, copper&#8208;catalyzed NH alkylation, acylation, alkynylation, cyanation, and azidation, are achieved in a highly modular fashion.

         <title>Highly Stereospecific On&#8208;Surface Dimerization into Bishelicenes: Topochemical Ullmann Coupling of Bromohelicene on Au(111)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

Only same handedness please! On&#8208;surface Ullmann C&#8722;C coupling of bromohelicene enantiomers leads stereospecifically only to homochiral combinations into bis(helicene).







Abstract
The on&#8208;surface dimerization into bis(hexahelicene) on a gold(111) surface has been studied by means of scanning tunneling microscopy and time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary mass spectrometry. C&#8722;C Ullmann coupling of (rac)&#8208;2&#8208;bromo&#8208;hexahelicene leads to formation of the (M,M)&#8208; and (P,P)&#8208;diastereomers of 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bis(hexahelicene), whilst formation of the (M,P)&#8208;diastereomer is not observed. Upon cooling, the bis(hexahelicene) aggregates into an ordered two&#8208;dimensional lattice with partly randomly distributed enantiomers. The highly specific diastereomeric coupling is explained by the surface alignment of educt in combination with the strong steric overcrowding in a possible surface&#8208;confined (M,P)&#8208;product.

         <title>Azide&#8211;Enolate Cycloaddition&#8208;Rearrangement Enables Direct &#945;&#8208;Amination of Amides and Enelactam Synthesis from Esters
</title>

         <dc:description>
Diverse frameworks via cycloaddition&#8208;rearrangement: Azide&#8208;enolate cycloaddition&#8208;rearrangements were applied to the direct &#945;&#8208;amination of amides and lactams, and synthesis of ene&#8208;&#947;&#8208;lactams from esters. The outcome of the reaction varied by substrate, depending on the fate of triazoline intermediates generated in the cycloaddition. These processes form part of a wider cycloaddition&#8208;rearrangement reaction manifold providing concise access to diverse frameworks.







Abstract
Azide&#8208;enolate cycloaddition&#8208;rearrangements offer potential for rapid access to diverse molecular frameworks from simple precursors. We report here that investigations into the cycloadditions of ester or amide enolates with vinyl azides led to the identification of two reaction processes &#8211; direct &#945;&#8208;amination of amides and lactams, and the synthesis of ene&#8208;&#947;&#8208;lactams from esters. The outcomes of these reactions depended on the fate of key vinyl triazoline intermediates generated in the initial cycloaddition step. Isolation of reaction intermediates in the ene&#8208;&#947;&#8208;lactam synthesis revealed the unexpected addition of two enolate equivalents, one of which is later eliminated. Computational studies further suggested an unusual reaction pathway involving direct addition of an enolate to the terminal carbon of the N&#8208;vinyl triazoline. In contrast, the &#945;&#8208;amination of amides and lactams proceeded by rearrangement of the intermediate triazoline to give an imine, hydrolysis or reduction of which gave access to primary or secondary &#945;&#8208;amino amides or lactams.

         <title>Self&#8208;Supported Ru&#8208;Incorporated NiSe2 for Ampere&#8208;Level Current Density Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;supported Ru&#8208;incorporated NiSe2 (Ru&#8208;NiSe2) catalyst shows high hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity with a small overpotential of 180.8&#8197;mV to achieve 1000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and excellent long&#8208;term stability for large&#8208;current&#8208;density HER in alkaline medium. A great number of accessible catalytically active sites, and well&#8208;modified electronic structure of Ru&#8208;NiSe2 contribute to its high HER activity.







Abstract
To meet the requirements for industrial water splitting to generate hydrogen, it is urgent, but still quite challenging to develop highly active and stable electrocatalysts for large&#8208;current&#8208;density hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, Ru&#8208;incorporated NiSe2 (Ru&#8208;NiSe2) was designed and synthesized. The introduction of Ru results in the formation of hierarchically structured Ru&#8208;NiSe2 with large electrochemical active surface area, and well&#8208;modified electronic structure. As expected, the as&#8208;fabricated Ru&#8208;NiSe2 displays impressive HER activity in 1.0&#8197;M&#8201;KOH, with a low overpotential of 180.8&#8197;mV to reach the current density of 1000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. Ru&#8208;NiSe2 also presents outstanding long&#8208;term stability at high current densities, owing to its high intrinsic chemical stability, and strong catalyst&#8208;support interface. Notably, when performed at a certain current density of 1000&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, the overpotential increase after 90&#8197;h is only 13&#8197;mV. Such excellent HER performance of Ru&#8208;NiSe2 demonstrates its great potential for practical use in industrial water splitting.

By using benzylamines as the C4 source of 1,4&#8208;dihydropyridines (1,4&#8208;DHPs), a Cu&#8208;catalyzed oxidative [1+2+1+2] cascade cyclization of N,N&#8208;dimethyl enaminones and benzylamines for the synthesis of 1,4&#8208;DHPs was firstly developed.







Abstract
Using benzylamines as the C4 source of 1,4&#8208;dihydropyridines (1,4&#8208;DHPs), a Cu&#8208;catalyzed oxidative [1+2+1+2] cascade cyclization for the synthesis of 1,4&#8208;DHPs was firstly developed. A broad range of easily available N,N&#8208;dimethyl enaminones and benzylamines are employed smoothly to provide a diverse range of 1,4&#8208;DHPs with high efficiency. This method is performed by a one&#8208;pot cascade C(sp3)&#8722;H bond functionalization/C(sp3)&#8722;N cleavage/cyclization strategy to form simultaneously two C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp2) bonds, two C(sp2)&#8722;N bonds, and a 1,4&#8208;DHP ring.

         <title>Controlling Morphologies of Redox&#8208;responsive Polymeric Nanocarriers for a Smart Drug Delivery System</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Redox&#8208;responsive nanocarriers using disulfides or thiols have received considerable attention owing to the higher levels of glutathione (GSH) in cancer cells than those in extracellular fluids. Nevertheless, the normal&#8208;to&#8208;cancer&#8208;cell selectivity of these nanocarriers has not yet been clarified. Nanocarriers exhibit different cytotoxicities depending on the morphologies they adopt under the redox&#8208;active conditions typically existing in cancerous cells. Therefore, not only GSH levels but also reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and other complex cancerous cell conditions must be considered for the development of smart drug delivery systems. In this article, we describe the structural design of redox&#8208;responsive polymers that exhibit different morphological changes in environments akin to cancerous cells (e.g., GSH&#8208; and ROS&#8208;abundant conditions). In addition, we propose a molecular design for the spatiotemporal control of nanocarrier morphology depending on the levels of both GSH and ROS upon photoirradiation to increase the cytotoxicity difference between normal and cancer cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoluminescence Properties of Single&#8208;Walled Carbon Nanotubes Influenced by the Tether Length of Reagents with Two Reactive Sites</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The functionalization of single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) is an effective method for controlling a local band gap, resulting in photoluminescence (PL) in the near&#8208;infrared region. Herein, SWNTs were functionalized using a series of bromoalkanes and dibromoalkanes to evaluate the effects of their length on the nanotube PL properties. When bromoalkanes (CnH2n+1Br) or dibromoalkanes (CnH2nBr2) with tether lengths of six or more were utilized for six different semiconducting SWNTs, the obtained SWNT adducts exhibited two new PL peaks, whereas dibromoalkanes with tether lengths of 3&#8211;5 (CnH2nBr2: n = 3&#8211;5) produced single peaks. Combined with theoretical calculations, the results suggested that the tether length of reagents changes the formation mechanism of functionalized adducts, that is, CnH2nBr2&#160;(n = 3&#8211;5) tends to result in kinetic products.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Radiosensitive compounds can be useful for the detection of radiations and also as prodrugs that can be activated during a radiotherapy.

         <dc:description>Our quantum chemical analyses elucidate how the replacement of O in the amide bonds of benzene&#8208;1,3&#8208;5&#8208;tricarboxamides (OBTAs) for the larger chalcogens S and Se enhances the intermolecular interactions and thereby the stability of the obtained hydrogen&#8208;bonded supramolecular polymers by two unexpected mechanisms: i) the SBTA and SeBTA monomers have a better geometry for self&#8208;assembly and ii) induce stronger covalent (hydrogen&#8208;bond) interactions besides enhanced dispersion interactions. In addition, we show that the cooperativity in BTA self&#8208;assembly is caused by charge separation&#160;in the &#963;&#8208;electronic system following the covalency in the hydrogen bonds.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A flow electrochemical method towards the synthesis of&#160;N&#8208;nitroso compounds from secondary amines using cheap and readily available sodium nitrite was developed. Sodium nitrite dissolved in aqueous acetonitrile made additional electrolytes unnecessary. This mild and straightforward approach made the use of acids or other harsh and toxic chemicals redundant. This procedure was applied to an assortment of cyclic and acyclic secondary amines (27 examples) resulting in yields of&#160;N&#8208;nitrosamines as high as 99%. To demonstrate the practicality of the process, scale&#8208;up reactions were performed. Finally, selected products could be purified using an in&#8208;line acidic extraction.</dc:description>

         <title>Neutral, Heteroleptic [Cu(I)(PPh3)2(4H&#8208;imidazolato)] Complexes: Ligand Exchange Reactivity, Redox Properties, Excited&#8208;State Dynamics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hop on hop off: Typically, heteroleptic Cu(I)DiiminePPh3 complexes tend to form the homoleptic counterpart. But this is not observed when the diimine is an anionic 4H&#8208;imidazolate. Despite dynamic PPh3 ligand exchange in solution the deeply colored, photoredox&#8208;active Cu(I)4H&#8208;imidazolatoPPh3 complexes are stable.







Abstract
Cu(I) 4H&#8208;imidazolate complexes are rare examples of Cu(I) complexes with chelating anionic ligands and are potent photosensitizers with unique absorption and photoredox properties. In this contribution, five novel heteroleptic Cu(I) complexes with monodentate triphenylphosphine co&#8208;ligands are investigated. As a consequence of the anionic 4H&#8208;imidazolate ligand and in contrast to comparable complexes with neutral ligands, these complexes are more stable than their homoleptic bis(4H&#8208;imidazolato)Cu(I) congeners. Here, the ligand exchange reactivity was studied by 31P&#8208;,19F&#8208;, and variable temperature NMR and the ground state structural and electronic properties by X&#8208;ray diffraction, absorption spectroscopy, and cyclic voltammetry. The excited&#8208;state dynamics were investigated by femto&#8208; and nanosecond transient absorption spectroscopy. The observed differences, with respect to chelating bisphosphine bearing congeners, are often due to the increased geometric flexibility of the triphenylphosphines. These observations render the investigated complexes interesting candidates for photo(redox)reactions not accessible with chelating bisphosphine ligands.

Despite dynamic PPh&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ligand exchange in solution the deeply colored, photoredox-active Cu(I)4&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-imidazolatoPPh&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; complexes are stable.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cu(I) 4&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-imidazolate complexes are rare examples of Cu(I) complexes with chelating anionic ligands and are potent photosensitizers with unique absorption and photoredox properties. In this contribution, five novel heteroleptic Cu(I) complexes with monodentate triphenylphosphine co-ligands are investigated. As a consequence of the anionic 4&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-imidazolate ligand and in contrast to comparable complexes with neutral ligands, these complexes are more stable than their homoleptic bis(4&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-imidazolato)Cu(I) congeners. Here, the ligand exchange reactivity was studied by &lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt;P-,&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;F-, and variable temperature NMR and the ground state structural and electronic properties by X-ray diffraction, absorption spectroscopy, and cyclic voltammetry. The excited-state dynamics were investigated by femto- and nanosecond transient absorption spectroscopy. The observed differences, with respect to chelating bisphosphine bearing congeners, are often due to the increased geometric flexibility of the triphenylphosphines. These observations render the investigated complexes interesting candidates for photo(redox)reactions not accessible with chelating bisphosphine ligands.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chemo&#8208;Enzymatic Synthesis of Long&#8208;Chain Oligosaccharides for Studying Xylan&#8208;Modifying Enzymes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Xylan biosynthesis: Starting from dixylosides, chemo&#8208;enzymatic syntheses of xylan dodecasaccharides using glycosynthase&#8208;mediated coupling reactions between glycosyl fluoride donors and thioglycoside acceptors were performed. These long&#8208;chain xylan oligosaccharides were incubated with xylan&#8208;modifying enzymes from plants, i.&#8201;e., three glycosyltransferases and one acetyltransferase, and the reaction products were analyzed by MALDI&#8208;MS.







Abstract
Plant research is hampered in several aspects by a lack of pure oligosaccharide samples that closely represent structural features of cell wall glycans. An alternative to purely chemical synthesis to access these oligosaccharides is chemo&#8208;enzymatic synthesis using glycosynthases. These enzymes enable the ligation of oligosaccharide donors, when activated for example as &#945;&#8208;glycosyl fluorides, with suitable acceptor oligosaccharides. Herein, the synthesis of xylan oligosaccharides up to dodecasaccharides is reported, with glycosynthase&#8208;mediated coupling reactions as key steps. The xylo&#8208;oligosaccharide donors were protected at the non&#8208;reducing end with a 4&#8208;O&#8208;tetrahydropyranyl (THP) group to prevent polymerization. Installation of an unnatural 3&#8208;O&#8208;methylether substituent at the reducing end xylose of the oligosaccharides ensured good water solubility. Biochemical assays demonstrated enzymatic activity for the xylan acetyltransferase XOAT1 from Arabidopsis thaliana, xylan arabinofuranosyl&#8208;transferase XAT3 enzymes from rice and switchgrass, and the xylan glucuronosyltransferase GUX3 from Arabidopsis thaliana. In case of the glucuronosyltransferase GUX3, MALDI&#8208;MS/MS analysis of the reaction product suggested that a single glucuronosyl substituent was installed primarily at the central xylose residues of the dodecasaccharide acceptor, demonstrating the value of long&#8208;chain acceptors for assaying biosynthetic glycosyltransferases.

         <title>ACTIVE&#8208;BAPO &#8211; A Versatile Transfer Agent for Photoactive Bis(acyl)phosphane Oxide Units</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Active BAPO &#8208; An NHS ester substituted bis(acyl)phosphane oxide (BAPO) is synthesized by phospha&#8208;Michael addition and used as the first versatile transfer agent for the grafting of photoactive BAPO units. Amino acids, porcine skin, and poly(amido)amine (PAMAM) dendrimers were functionalized with the photoactive units and used for the synthesis of thermosets with a different degree of crosslinking.







Abstract
A N&#8208;hydroxy succinimide (NHS) ester substituted bis(acyl)phosphane oxide (ACTIVE&#8208;BAPO) was prepared by phospha&#8208;Michael addition and used for an easy one&#8208;step BAPO ligation with substrates containing primary amino groups, such as amino acids, proteins, and poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) dendrimers. Thereby, a range of new molecular and polymeric photoinitators was obtained. Real&#8208;time photo&#8208;rheology experiments demonstrated the outstanding efficiency of the PAMAM BAPOs as photoinitiators for free radical polymerization. Remarkably, it is found that PAMAM BAPOs also act as crosslinking agents to convert monofunctional methacrylate monomers into thermosetting networks without any further additives. Depending on the number of the attached BAPOs, thermosets with a different degree of crosslinking and swelling capability in water were obtained.

         <title>Combinatorial Coordination Self&#8208;Assembly for Organopalladium Cages with Fine&#8208;Tuned Structure and Function</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combinatorial coordination self&#8208;assembly is a powerful tool to create the lower&#8208;symmetric coordination cages with increasing structural complexities and advanced functions. In this concept article, we define and summarized the strategy for the combinatorial self&#8208;assembled PdII coordination cages. Emergent functions on some selected PdII coordination cages were also introduced with an aim of emphasizing the advantages of the heteroleptic cages.







Abstract
Discrete organopalladium coordination cages have shown great potential in applications ranging from molecular recognition and sensing, drug delivery to enzymatic catalysis. While many of the known organopalladium cages are homoleptic structures with regular polyhedral shapes and symmetric inner cavities, heteroleptic cages with complex architectures and new functions coming from their anisotropic cavities have received an increasing attention recently. In this concept article, we discuss a powerful combinatorial coordination self&#8208;assembly strategy toward the construction of a family of organopalladium cages, including both homoleptic and heteroleptic ones, from a given library of ligands. Within such a cage family, the heteroleptic cages often feature systematically fine&#8208;tuned structures and emergent properties, distinct from their parent homoleptic counterparts. We hope the concepts and examples provided in this article can offer some rational guidance for the design of new coordination cages toward advanced functions.

         <title>Molecular Hinges by Fusion of Pyrrole and Dithiin: Synthesis, Structure, Redox Chemistry and Host&#8211;Guest Complexation of Dipyrrolo&#8208;1,4&#8208;dithiins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of novel hinge&#8208;like molecules, namely dipyrrolo&#8208;1,4&#8208;dithiins, were prepared via fusion of pyrroles with 1,4&#8208;dithiin. Their hinged structure, excellent redox&#8208;activity, and adaptive host&#8211;guest chemistry have provided great potentials for developing redox&#8208;switchable host&#8211;guest systems and materials.







Abstract
A series of novel hinge&#8208;like molecules, namely dipyrrolo&#8208;1,4&#8208;dithiins (PDs), were prepared and fully characterized by NMR, UV/vis, cyclic voltammogram, ESR, and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) analysis. The lateral fusion of pyrroles with 1,4&#8208;dithiins has led to not only retained key features of a dithiin, but also enhanced redox&#8208;activity with increased susceptibility to radical cations via redox or chemical oxidation. Stabilization of their radicals are observed for the N,N&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl or N,N&#8208;triphenylmethyl PD as evidenced by ESR measurements. DFT calculations and SCXRD analysis revealed PDs are extremely flexible with adaptive molecular geometries that can be mechanically regulated via crystal packing or host&#8211;guest complexation. The excellent donor nature of PDs renders inclusion complexes with the cyclophane bluebox (cyclobis(paraquat&#8208;p&#8208;phenylene)), featuring association constants up to 104&#8197;M&#8722;1. Additionally, a planarized transition intermediate associated with inversion dynamics of a PD has been preserved in the pseudorotaxane structure with assistances of &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; and S&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions. The hinged structure, excellent redox&#8208;activity, and adaptive nature of PDs could further enable accesses to exotic redox switchable host&#8211;guest chemistry and functional materials.

         <title>Surface&#8208;Stabilized CsPbI3 Nanocrystals with Tailored Organic Polymer Ligand Binding</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stable black&#8208;phase &#947;&#8208;CsPbI3 nanocrystals capped with a new organic polymer ligand, HO&#8208;PS&#8208;N3, have been synthesized by hot&#8208;injection method with significantly improved resistance to moisture and light.







Abstract
Perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) exhibit attractive photophysical properties by combining the excellent optoelectronic properties of bulk perovskites with the strong quantum confinement effect at the nanoscale. However, CsPbI3 NCs easily transform into a non&#8208;perovskite phase because of the ionic lattice and dynamic ligand binding. Herein, stable black&#8208;phase CsPbI3 NCs capped with a new organic ligand, HO&#8208;PS&#8208;N3 (HOPS), which consists of a polystyrene segment with hydroxyl and azide end groups, are reported. This organic polymer ligand passivated the surface defects and enhanced the stability of CsPbI3 NCs by exposing the linking hydrophobic polystyrene segment. Consequently, the optimized CsPbI3 NCs exhibit significantly improved resistance to moisture or light and maintained 70&#8201;% of the original luminous intensity after immersion in water for two months. The theoretical results revealed that the binding energy of the HOPS ligand on the surface of the CsPbI3 NCs is higher than that of the commonly used oleic acid, alleviating the defects&#8208;induced degradation during purification. Thus, surface&#8208;stabilized CsPbI3 NCs are beneficial for a broad range of optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Progress of Azametallacyclopentadienes in the New Century</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Concept article summarizes the progress of azametallacyclopentadienes towards their generated methods, structural characterization, intrinsic reactivity, and application in the heterocyclic synthesis since the new century.







Abstract
As the key intermediates in metal&#8208;promoted/catalyzed C&#8722;C bond coupling reactions of nitriles and alkynes, azametallacyclopentadienes, M(N=CR1&#8722;CR2=CR3), are an important class of azametallacycles. Although the first authentic azametallacyclopentadienes were documented in 1986, their chemistry towards solid&#8208;state structures, intrinsic reactivity, and synthetic application was rarely investigated for a long time. At the beginning of this century, seminal works about the applications of azametallacyclopentadienes in the synthesis of heterocycles, including multi&#8208;substituted pyridines, isoquinolines, furans, and pyrroles were reported. Subsequently, a series of new complexes with this motif, namely the Group 4, aluminum, actinide, and rare&#8208;earth azametallacyclopentadienes were isolated and structurally characterized. Among them, the rare&#8208;earth azametallacyclopentadiene expresses high reactivity towards unsaturated molecules, such as nitriles, isocyanides, and Mo(CO)6 to provide novel fused metallacycles. In this Concept, we reviewed the advances in the preparation, reactivity, and synthetic application of azametallacyclopentadienes in the past twenty years.

         <title>Mitochondria&#8208;Targeted Gene Silencing Facilitated by Mito&#8208;CPDs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mitochondria&#8208;Targeted Gene Silencing: We report a mitochondria&#8208;targeted cell&#8208;penetrating poly(disulfide)s (Mito&#8208;CPDs), which is not only compatible with commercially available gene&#8208;silencing reagents without the need of chemical or genetic modifications, but also capable of transporting siRNA and ASO into mitochondria and thereby silencing mtDNA specifically.







Abstract
Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) plays an essential role in maintaining normal cellular activities. Its heteroplasmic mutations are known to cause various genetic diseases. Current genetic engineering strategies, such as those based on RNA interference (RNAi) and antisense technology, are difficult to genetically alter mtDNA, however, due to the inability of highly negatively charged oligonucleotides to translocate across the double&#8208;membrane mitochondria. We report herein a universal mitochondria&#8208;targeted gene&#8208;delivery approach by using cell&#8208;penetrating poly(disulfide)s (CPDs). Novel CPD&#8208;based mitochondrial transporters, named Mito&#8208;CPDs, were synthesized by using triphenylphosphonium (TPP)&#8208;fused propagating monomers containing either disulfide or diselenide backbones. Upon spontaneous complex formation with an oligonucleotide (single&#8208; or double&#8208;stranded), the resulting nanoscale Mito&#8208;CPD@Oligo exhibited excellent properties in common biological media. While the intracellular gene&#8208;delivery efficiency of these Mito&#8208;CPDs was comparable to that of commercial transfection agents, their unique mitochondria&#8208;localized properties enabled effective release of the loaded cargo inside these organelles. Subsequent mitochondrial delivery of siRNA and antisense oligonucleotides against suitable mtDNA&#8208;encoded proteins showed successful down&#8208;regulation of target protein expression, leading to profound effects on mitochondrial functions. Mito&#8208;CPDs thus provide a useful tool for future investigations of mitochondrial biology and treatment of mitochondria&#8208;related diseases.

         <title>Construction of a Diverse Range of Boron Heterocycles via Ring Expansion of a Carboranyl&#8208;Substituted 9&#8208;Borafluorene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ring expansion of a carboranyl&#8208;substituted 9&#8208;borafluorene with unsaturated substrates provides easy access to a range of boraheterocyclic products containing six&#8208;, seven&#8208;, and eight&#8208;membered rings. Compared to known aryl&#8208; and halogen&#8208;substituted borafluorene derivatives, the study shows that the electron&#8208;withdrawing carboranyl substituent leads to more facile and more selective insertion reactions.







Abstract
Direct insertion of unsaturated substrates into a five&#8208;membered borole ring is a useful method to obtain valuable heterocycles containing one or more three&#8208;coordinate boron atoms. A highly Lewis acidic 9&#8208;o&#8208;carboranyl&#8208;9&#8208;borafluorene, in which the o&#8208;carboranyl substituent is connected via one of the cluster carbon atoms to the boron atom of the 9&#8208;borafluorene unit, was found to react with a vast array of unsaturated molecules, such as alkynes, aldehydes and various organic azides, to form larger boraheterocyclic products. The ring expansion reactions of the central borole ring proceed rapidly at room temperature, cementing the role of the o&#8208;carboranyl substituent in enhancing the insertion reactivity of 9&#8208;borafluorenes.

         <title>Breaking the DFT Energy Bias Caused by Intramolecular Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding Interactions with MESSI, a Structural Elucidation Method Inspired by Wisdom of the Crowd Theory</title>

         <dc:description>The use of quantum&#8208;based NMR methods to complement and guide the connectivity and stereochemical assignment of natural and unnatural products has grown enormously. One of the unsolved problems is related to the improper calculation of the conformational landscape of flexible molecules that have functional groups capable of generating a complex network of intramolecular H&#8208;bonding (IHB) interactions. Here we present MESSI (Multi&#8208;Ensemble Strategy for Structural Identification), a method inspired by the wisdom of the crowd theory that breaks with the traditional mono&#8208;ensemble approach. By including independent mappings of selected artificially manipulated ensembles, MESSI greatly improves the sense of the assignment by neutralizing potential energy biases.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible Light&#8208;Mediated Photocatalytic Deracemization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Asymmetric catalysis has long been recognized as a powerful tool for the synthesis of enantioenriched molecules. In addition to precise enantiocontrol, high&#8208;atom economy has always been pursued by chemists in the development of methodologies, which is crucial for practicality. Consequently, deracemization, the direct conversion of a racemic compound to one of its enantiomers, and thus characterized by a 100% atom efficiency, has attracted increasing interest. Recently, visible light&#8208;driven photocatalysis has been demonstrated as a promising platform for the development of deracemization. Central to its success can be attributed to its ability to efficiently overcome the prevailing kinetic issues in chemical transformations and the intrinsic thermodynamic challenges, which typically require the use of additional stoichiometric reagents and thus undermine the original advantage. In this review, the advances in this attractive area are systematically summarized and discussed, with examples organized according to the different modalities of energy transfer and single&#8208;electron transfer in photocatalysis.</dc:description>

Consequently, deracemization, the direct conversion of a racemic compound to one of its enantiomers, and thus characterized by a 100% atom efficiency, has attracted increasing interest. Recently, visible light-driven photocatalysis has been demonstrated as a promising platform for the development of deracemization. Central to its success can be attributed to its ability to efficiently overcome the prevailing kinetic issues in chemical transformations and the intrinsic thermodynamic challenges, which typically require the use of additional stoichiometric reagents and thus undermine the original advantage. In this review, the advances in this attractive area are systematically summarized and discussed, with examples organized according to the different modalities of energy transfer and single-electron transfer in photocatalysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Gold&#8208;Catalyzed Cascade Reaction of Diynamides with Allylic Alcohols: A Versatile Platform to Allenamide, 2&#8208;Aminofuran and Bridged [2.2.2]Octadiene Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed divergent synthesis through alternation of the catalyst is appealing, as it provides an operationally simple way to access different valuable products, while using the same reactants as starting materials. Herein, a gold&#8208;catalyzed cascade reaction of conjugated diynamides with allylic alcohols is described. By variation of the catalysts, substituted allenes and furans could be obtained selectively. Mechanistic studies indicate that, after the addition of allylic alcohol to gold&#8208;activated diynamide, a [3,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement would take place and lead to the formation of a common reactive intermediate, which would further convert to the final products selectively. Further variation of the structure of diynamides has unveiled an additional reaction sequence involving intramolecular Himbert arene/allene Diels&#8722;Alder cycloaddition to afford a series of dearomatized products bearing bicyclo[2,2,2]octadiene core.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering the BASHY Dye Platform toward Architectures with Responsive Fluorescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A set of nine boronic&#8208;acid derived salicylidenehydrazone (BASHY) complexes was synthesized in good to very good chemical yields in a versatile three&#8208;component reaction. In extension to previous reports on this dye platform, the focus was put on the electronic modification of the &#8220;vertical&#8221; positions of the salicylidenehydrazone backbone. This enabled the observation of fluorescence quenching by photoinduced electron transfer (PeT), which can be reverted by the addition of acid in organic solvent (OFF&#8208;ON fluorescence switching). The resulting emission is observed in the green&#8208;to&#8208;orange spectral region (maxima at 520&#8211;590 nm). On the contrary, under physiological pH conditions in water the PeT process is inherently decativated, enabling the observation of fluorescence in the red&#8208;to&#8208;NIR region (maxima at 650&#8211;680 nm) with appreciable quantum yields and lifetimes. The latter characteristic supported the application of the dyes in fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) of live A549 cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Overcoming Energy Transfer for the Metallophotoredox Catalyzed Decarboxylative Alkenylation between Alkylcarboxylic Acids and Enol Triflates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we report on the decarboxylative alkenylation between alkyl carboxylic acids and enol triflates. The reaction is mediated by a dual catalytic nickel and iridium system, operating under visible light irradiation. Two competing catalytic pathways, from the excited state iridium photocatalyst, are identified. One is energy transfer from the excited state, resulting in formation of an undesired enol ester. The desired pathway involves electron transfer, resulting in decarboxylation to ultimately give the target product. The use of a highly oxidizing iridium photocatalyst is essential to control the reactivity. A diverse array of enol triflates and alkyl carboxylic acids are investigated, providing both scope and limitations of the presented methodology.</dc:description>

         <title>Composites of HKUST&#8208;1@Nanocellulose for gas&#8208;separation and dye&#8208;sorption applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, composites of HKUST&#8208;1 MOF with nanocellulose, HKUST&#8208;1@NCs, have been prepared and explored for CO2/N2 gas&#8208;separation and dye&#8208;sorption based applications. Our biopolymer&#8208;MOF composites are prepared via a copper ion pre&#8208;seeding method, in which, the HKUST&#8208;1 crystallites are grown in situ on the Cu&#8208;seeded and carboxylate anchored NC fibers for a better interfacial integration between the MOF and the polymer matrices. One of our HKUST&#8208;1@NC composites show ~300% enhancement in the CO2/N2 sorption selectivity. The same composite, C100, in the bulk powder form, shows a remarkable IAST sorption selectivity of 298 (CO2/N2) at 298 K and 1 bar for the CO2/N2 (15/85, v/v) gas mixture. The HKUST&#8208;1@NC composites have also been processed along with a polymeric cellulose acetate (CA) matrix as HKUST&#8208;1@NC@CA films to study them as free&#8208;standing mixed&#8208;matrix membranes. The CO2/N2 sorption selectivity, at 298 K and 1 bar is 600 for one such membrane, C&#8208;120@CA, as bulk sample studied by the static gas sorption. The composite, C120, exhibits a good uptake with an enhancement of 11% for alizarin and 70% for Congo red in comparison to the uptakes of the corresponding blank reference HKUST&#8208;1 sample, B120.</dc:description>

         <title>A Cytoplasm&#8208;Specific Fluorescent Ligand for Selective Imaging of RNA G&#8208;quadruplexes in Live Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of site&#8208;specific, target&#8208;selective and biocompatible small molecule ligands as a fluorescent tool for real&#8208;time study of cellular functions of RNA G&#8208;quadruplexes (G4s), which are associated with human cancers, is of significance in cancer biology. We report a fluorescent ligand that is a cytoplasm&#8208;specific and RNA G4&#8208;selective fluorescent biosensor in live HeLa cells. The in vitro results show that the ligand is highly selective targeting RNA G4s including VEGF, NRAS, BCL2 and TERRA. These G4s are recognized as human cancer hallmarks. Moreover, intracellular competition studies with BRACO19 and PDS, and the colocalization study with G4&#8208;specific antibody (BG4) in HeLa cells may support that the ligand is highly selective binding to G4s in cellulo. Furthermore, the ligand was demonstrated for the first time in the visualization and monitoring of dynamic resolving process of RNA G4s by the overexpressed RFP&#8208;tagged DHX36 helicase in live HeLa cells.</dc:description>

         <title>&#8220;Catch&#8208;Store&#8208;Release&#8221; Strategy for the Stabilization of 4,4&#8217;&#8208;Methylene Diphenyl Diisocyanate (4,4&#8217;&#8208;MDI)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>4,4&#8217;&#8208;Methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI) is an industrially crucial compound, being one of the most utilized linkers in the polyurethane industry. However, its long&#8208;term stability is limited due to dimerization to form insoluble uretdione. Herein we demonstrate an organometallic &#8220;catch&#8208;store&#8208;release&#8221; concept aiming at improving long&#8208;term chemical stability of MDI. Treatment of MDI with two equivalents of selected N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHC) forms stable MDI&#8208;NHC adducts. Treatment of the adducts with CuCl forms metastable di&#8208;Cu(I) complexes, which undergo decomposition to reform MDI (up to 85%), along with Cu&#8208;NHC complexes. The yield of reformed MDI can be improved (up to 95%) by the release of the NHC ligands in the form of thiourea, which prevents subsequent MDI dimerization/polymerization by the carbenes. Furthermore, the need to separate MDI from the reaction mixture can be eliminated by the direct reaction of MDI&#8208;NHC complexes with alcohols (as model for diols), which form dicarbamate (as model for polyurethane) quantitatively.</dc:description>

         <title>Design of Fluorescent Carbon Dots (CDs) for the Selective detection of Metal&#8208;Containing Ions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The pollution caused by heavy metals (HMs) may occur through both natural processes and anthropogenic activities and is found in complex media. The purpose of this review is to summarize the state&#8208;of&#8208;art of fluorescent CDs and the sensing applications in a systematic manner. This review intends to provide clues on the origin on the observed selectivity in chemiluminiscence sensors, which was until now a stated but unaddressed question, and still remains open for debate. Indeed, it is tempting to think that CDs possessing functional groups with soft bases at the surface are able to detect soft metal acids, while the opposite is to be suspected for hard acid&#8208;base pairs. However, the literature shows several examples where this trend does not hold. We found that such observation is explained by the involvement of dynamic quenching, which does not involve the formation of a non&#8208;fluorescent complex, as in the case of static quenching. We have provided an interpretation of published data that was not provided by the original authors and offer guidelines to enable the design of CDs to target ions in solution.</dc:description>

         <title>Ruthenium Complexes of Polyfluorocarbon Substituted Terpyridine and Mesoionic Carbene Ligands: An Interplay in CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In recent years terpyridines (tpy) and mesoionic carbenes (MIC) have been widely used in metal complexes. With the right combination with a metal center, both of these ligands are individually known to generate excellent catalysts for CO2 reduction. In this study, we combine the potentials of PFC (PFC = polyfluorocarbon) substituted tpy and MIC ligands within the same platform to obtain a new class of complexes, which we investigated with respect to their structural, electrochemical and UV/Vis/NIR spectroelectrochemical properties. We further show that the resulting metal complexes are potent electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction in which CO is exclusively formed with a faradaic efficiency of 92%. A preliminary mechanistic study, including the isolation and characterization of a key intermediate is also reported.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemical Synthesis of Alpha&#8208;Synuclein Proteins via Solid&#8208;Phase Peptide Synthesis and Native Chemical Ligation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alpha&#8208;Synuclein (&#945;&#8208;Synuclein) is a 140 amino acid protein implicated in neurodegenerative disorders known as synucleino&#8208;pathies, where it accumulates in proteinaceous inclusions in the brain. The normal physiological function of &#945;&#8208;Synuclein remains obscure, as it exists in several non&#8208;neuronal cells in which its function has not been studied. Given the tremendous interest in studying &#945;&#8208;Synuclein, and the existing limitations in the production of modified forms of the protein, we developed a method for the chemical synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Synuclein by combining peptide fragment synthesis via automated microwave&#8208;assisted solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis and ligation strategies. Our synthetic pathway enables the synthesis of protein variants of interest, carrying either mutations or posttranslational modifications, for further investigations of the effects on the structure and aggregation behavior of the protein. Ultimately, our study forms the foundation for future syntheses and studies of other custom&#8208;made &#945;&#8208;Synuclein variants with a single or several modifications, as necessary.</dc:description>

         <title>One, Two Three &#8211; Phosphaalkene Decoration Tailoring Solubility and Electronic Properties of Truxene&#8208;Based Electron Acceptors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the functionalization and deplanarization of truxenes using pnictaalkene fragments. Selective introduction of one, two, or three Mes*&#8208;Pn fragments provides up to three fully reversible reductions based on the Pn=C fragments. The incorporation of the unsaturated heteroelement fragment as well as the contortion of the truxene core result in significantly red&#8208;shifted absorption spectra and interesting opto&#8208;electronic properties which are studied by electrochemistry and spectro&#8208;electrochemistry. Incorporation of arsaalkene (As=C) motifs gives significantly milder reduction potentials and red&#8208;shifted absorption, while phosphaalkene decorated truxene P3 can be functionalized using Au(I)Cl coordination. Furthermore, solubility is markedly increased upon incorporation of the Pn&#8208;Mes* fragments which renders these materials suitable for solution processing.</dc:description>

         <title>Site&#8208;selective Hydrogenation/Deuteration of Benzylic Olefins Enabled by Electroreduction Using Water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We describe an operationally simple and user&#8208;friendly protocol that allows the site&#8209;selective hydrogenation and deuteration of di&#8208;, tri&#8208; and tetrasubstituted benzylic olefins by electroreduction while other groups prone to hydrogenation are present. The radical anionic intermediates react with the most inexpensive hydrogen/deuterium source H2O/D2O. Our method overcomes many limitations that arise from previously reported electro&#173;reductive hydrogenations. The applicability of this reaction is demonstrated by a broad substrate scope (&gt;50 examples) that focuses on functional group tolerance and sites that are affected by metal&#8208;catalyzed hydrogenation (alkenes, alkynes, protecting groups).</dc:description>

         <title>Exploring the Lewis Acidity and Reactivity of Neutral Pentacoordinate&#160;Dithienophospholes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of luminescent, neutral pentacoordinate dithieno[3,2&#8208;b:2&#8217;,3&#8217;&#8208;d]phosphole compounds was synthesized by [4+1] cycloaddition of o&#8208;quinones with the trivalent corresponding phospholes. The electronic and geometrical modification of the &#960;&#8208;conjugated scaffold implemented here impacts the aggregation behavior of the species in solution. It proved successful in generating species with improved Lewis acidity of the phosphorus center that was then leveraged for small&#8208;molecule activation. Hydride abstraction from an external substrate involving the hypervalent species is followed by an intriguing P&#8208;mediated umpolung from the hydride to a proton and supports the catalytic potential of this class of main&#8208;group Lewis acids for organic chemistry. This study is a comprehensive investigation into various methods, including electronic, chemical, geometric modifications (and sometimes combinations of these approaches) to systematically improve the Lewis acidity of neutral and stable main&#8208;group Lewis acids with practical value for a range of chemical transformations.</dc:description>
