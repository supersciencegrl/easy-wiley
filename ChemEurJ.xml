         <title>Diimidazolium Salt HBDIM: An Easily Available, Low&#8208;Cost CageCarbene Precursor with Broad Applications in Transition Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The preparation of diimidazolium salt HBDIM 1, a precursor for di&#8208;NHCs ligand, from cheap and easily available agent hexabenzylhexaazaisowurtzitane (HBIW) was reported. Under basic conditions, HBDIM underwent facile deprotonation to in situ generate CageCarbene which could efficiently coordinate to transition&#8208;metals such as Au, Cu or Pd to give the corresponding bimetallic complexes 2&#8208;4. These complexes were isolated and fully characterized including X&#8208;ray diffraction of their single crystals. It was found that the steric hinderance of CageCarbene is similar to that of SIMes but smaller than that of IPr, and electronically, CageCarbene is a strong &#963;&#8208;donator silimar to SIMs and a stronger &#963;&#8208;donator than IPr. Further studies showed that complexes 2&#8208;4 were highly reactive to catalyze up to 17 reactions. Control experiments utilizing N&#8208;benzyl&#8208;substituted monoimidazolium salt showed much low catalytic reactivity when it was bounded to Au or Cu, but exhibited similar reactivity for the Pd&#8208;complex. Kenetic studies showed that the low reactivity of the monodentate carbene&#8208;ligated Au or Cu complex was due to the low stability of the complex under the reaction condions.</dc:description>

Further studies showed that complexes 2-4 were highly reactive to catalyze up to 17 reactions. Control experiments utilizing N-benzyl-substituted monoimidazolium salt showed much low catalytic reactivity when it was bounded to Au or Cu, but exhibited similar reactivity for the Pd-complex.

         <title>Insight into the Effect of Stabilizers on Anticancer and Antibacterial Activity of AgBiS2 Nanomaterial</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The physicochemical interaction of nanoparticles with biological systems differs in the presence and absence of stabilizers (surfactant or polymer molecules) used during their synthesis. In this study, the AgBiS2 nanoparticles produced without stabilizing molecules demonstrated better anticancer activity than the polymer&#8208;coated nanoparticles. This work provides insight into the importance of the clean surface of nanoparticles in nanomedicine.







Abstract
The near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light&#8208;absorbing AgBiS2 nanoparticles can be excited by single&#8208;wavelength light, which is the primary characteristic of a photo responsive platform. Chemical synthesis of nanomaterials inevitably requires long&#8208;chain organic surfactants or polymers to stabilize them in the nano regime. These stabilizing molecules barricade the interaction of nanomaterials with biological cells. We have produced stabilizer&#8208;free (sf&#8208;AgBiS2) and polymer&#8208;coated (PEG&#8208;AgBiS2) nanoparticles; and assessed their NIR mediated anticancer and antibacterial activity to evaluate the effect of stabilizers. sf&#8208;AgBiS2 showed better antibacterial activity against Gram&#8208;positive Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and displayed excellent cytotoxicity against HeLa cells and live 3&#8208;D tumour spheroids compared to PEG&#8208;AgBiS2 both in presence and absence of NIR radiation. The photothermal therapy (PTT) results illustrated the tumour ablation ability of sf&#8208;AgBiS2, which converted light into heat effectively up to 53.3&#8201;&#176;C under NIR irradiation. This work demonstrates the importance of synthesizing stabilizer&#8208;free nanoparticles to produce safe and highly active PTT agents.

         <title>CO2 Activation on Cu/TiO2 Nanostructures: Importance of Dual Binding Site</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
CO2 adsorption and activation on Cu SAC and Cu10 nanoclusters supported on rutile(110) and anatase(101) TiO2 surfaces, both pristine and reduced, has been investigated. It was found that CO2 is activated only when the molecule can simultaneously bind to at least two active sites. The morphology of the support is essential.







Abstract
CO2 adsorption and activation on Cu single atom catalysts and Cu nanoclusters supported on the (110) surface of rutile and on the (101) surface of anatase TiO2 have been investigated by means of first principles electronic structure calculations. The role of oxide reduction associated to the presence of oxygen vacancies has been considered. Five main messages emerge from this study. (1) CO2 activation on Cu/TiO2 nanostructures is surface sensitive, as the rutile and anatase surfaces can exhibit different behaviors; (2) the surface morphology is essential since CO2 is activated only when the molecule can simultaneously bind to at least two active sites, such as a Cu atom on one side and an oxide ion on the other site; (3) Cu atoms on TiO2 are in the +I oxidation state and can bind and activate CO2 via charge transfer from the oxide; (4) on supported Cu clusters CO2 activation occurs mostly at the metal/oxide interface; (5) the presence of O vacancy sites facilitates the spontaneous dissociation of CO2 to CO, or increases the electron density of the metal catalyst, two effects that can influence the mechanism of CO2 reduction to methanol or other chemicals.

         <dc:description>This study identifies new acyl donors for manufacturing statin analogues through the acylation of monacolin J acid by the laboratory evolved acyltransferase LovD9. Vinyl and p&#8208;nitrophenyl esters have emerged as alternate substrates for LovD9 acylation mechanism.

         <title>Unimolecular reactivity of [Cu(R)(CF3)3]&#8722; complexes (R = organyl): stepwise vs. concerted mechanism in copper&#8208;mediated trifluoromethylation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The cuprate complexes [Cu(R)(CF3)3]&#8722; (R = organyl) offer an efficient synthetic access to valuable trifluoromethylation products RCF3. Here, we use electrospray&#8208;ionization mass spectrometry to analyze the formation of these intermediates in solution and probe their fragmentation pathways in the gas phase. Furthermore, we explore the potential energy surfaces of these systems by quantum chemical calculations. Upon collisional activation, the [Cu(R)(CF3)3]&#8722; complexes (R = Me, Et, Bu,  s Bu, allyl) afford the product ions [Cu(CF3)3]&#8226;&#8722; and [Cu(CF3)2]&#8722;. The former obviously results from an R&#8226; loss, whereas the latter originates either from the stepwise release of R&#8226; and CF3&#8226; radicals or a concerted reductive elimination of RCF3. The gas&#8208;phase fragmentation experiments as well as the quantum chemical calculations indicate that the preference for the stepwise reaction toward [Cu(CF3)2]&#8722; increases with the stability of the formed organyl radical R&#8226;. This finding suggests that the recombination of R&#8226; and CF3&#8226; radicals may possibly contribute to the formation of RCF3 from [Cu(R)(CF3)3]&#8722; in synthetic applications. In contrast, the [Cu(R)(CF3)3]&#8722; complexes (R = aryl) only yield [Cu(CF3)2]&#8722; when subjected to collision&#8208;induced dissociation. These species exclusively undergo a concerted reductive elimination because the competing stepwise pathway is disfavored by the low stability of aryl radicals.</dc:description>

         <title>On the Role of N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Salts in Alkyl Radical Generation from Alkyl Alcohols: A Computational Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Formation of carbon&#8208;carbon bonds through cross&#8208;coupling reactions using readily available substrates, like alcohols, is crucial for modern organic chemistry. Recently, direct alkyl alcohol functionalization has been achieved by the use of N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene (NHC) salts via in situ formation of an alcohol&#8208;NHC adduct and its activation by a photoredox catalysts to generate carbon&#8208;centered alkyl radicals. Experimentally, only electron deficient NHC activators work but the reasons of this behavior remains underexplored. Herein, DFT computational study of the mechanism of alcohol activation using up to seven NHC salts is performed to shed light into the influence of their electronic properties in the alkyl radical formation. This study demonstrated that four reaction steps are involved in the transformation and characterized how the electronic properties of the NHC salt affect each step. A fine balance of the NHC electron&#8208;richness is proved to be determinant for this transformation.</dc:description>

         <title>New Generation of Benzidine Wide&#8208;gap Conjugated Materials: Solution Processing a Classic Evaporated Scaffold</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbazole and fluorene&#8208;substituted benzidine blocks have been functionalized with two different solubilizing pendant groups, in order to enhance the material&#8217;s solubility in greener solvents. Preserving the optical and electrochemical properties, the aromatic function and substitution showed an important influence on the solvent affinity, achieving concentrations up to 150 mg/mL in o&#8208;xylenes for the glycol&#8208;containing materials and decent solubility in alcohols for the compounds functionalized with ionic chains. The latter solution proved to be ideal for the preparation of luminescence slot&#8208;die coating film on top of flexible&#8208;substrates up to 33 cm x 2 cm. As a proof of concept, the materials have been implemented in different organic electronic devices, highlighting the low turn&#8208;on voltage (4 V) presented by the OLEDs, which is comparable with vacuum&#8208;processed devices. A structure&#8208;solubility relationship and a synthetic strategy are disentangled in this manuscript to tailor organic semiconductors and adapt their solubility towards the desired solvent and application.</dc:description>

         <title>Ratiometric Fluorescence Assay for Pyrophosphate Based on Sulfur Nanodots Decorated Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ratiometric fluorescent probe was developed by decorating a porphyrin&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework (PCN&#8208;224) with sulfur nanodots (S&#8208;dots). The red&#8208;fluorescence of PCN&#8208;224 was enhanced through decorating with S&#8208;dots, which was quenched by adding Cu2+. PPi can trigger the recovery of red &#8211; fluorescence, through relieving above coordination reactions. S&#8208;dots provided stable blue emissive component for effective reference of fluorescence ratiometric assay.







Abstract
Selective and sensitive detection of inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi) are of great significance both for clinical applications and fundamental research. In this work, a ratiometric fluorescent probe was developed by decorating a porphyrin&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework (PCN&#8208;224) with sulfur nanodots (S&#8208;dots). The red&#8208;fluorescence of PCN&#8208;224 was significantly promoted (more than 6&#8208;fold) by S&#8208;dots through inhibiting molecular motion of porphyrin ligand, which also provided active sites for the detection of Cu2+ and PPi. Cu2+ could selectively quench the red&#8208;fluorescence of PCN&#8208;224 through coordination with porphyrin ligand, and the competition reaction between PPi and Cu2+ resulted in the decomposing of coordination and recovery of red&#8208;fluorescence. The blue&#8208;fluorescence from S&#8208;dots was deemed as effective reference, which provided a built&#8208;in correction in complex environments. Based on these photophysical properties, a ratiometric fluorescence assay was developed for the quantitative detection of Cu2+ and PPi, with a limit of detection of 0.11 and 2.66&#8197;&#956;M, respectively. The accuracy and practical applications of assays were also demonstrated by detection in tap water and human serum samples.

         <title>A Novel C Doped MoS2/CoP/MoO2 Ternary Heterostructure Nanoflower for Hydrogen Evolution Reaction at Wide pH Range and Efficient Overall Water Splitting in Alkaline Media</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The binary heterostructure Nanoflower MoS2/Co1.2MoO4.2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;1.2H2O supported on BC was prepared by hydrothermal reaction. C doped MoS2/CoP/MoO2 ternary heterostructure Nanoflower was synthesized in&#8197;situ by high&#8208;temperature phosphating technology.







Abstract
The development of low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;efficiency bifunctional catalysts is still a challenge for hydrogen production through overall water splitting. This paper reports the in&#8208;situ synthesis of C&#8208;doped MoS2/CoP/MoO2 using bacterial cellulose (BC) as the reducing agent and the source of C and using BC (MoS2/Co1.2MoO4.2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;1.2H2O/BC) as the template. Heterogeneous structure for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and alkaline water electrolysis in a wide pH range. Due to the large number of defect sites caused by C doping and the synergy between these three active components (MoS2, CoP and MoO2), the HER and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activities of the catalyst have been greatly improved. Therefore, during HER, a small initial overpotential (27&#8197;mV) was achieved in 1.0&#8197;M KOH. In 0.5&#8197;M H2SO4, 0.1&#8197;M PBS and 1.0&#8197;M KOH, the current density reached 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at overpotentials of 123.4, 150, and 139&#8197;mV, respectively. For OER, an overpotential of 268&#8197;mV was required to achieve 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2. The alkaline two&#8208;electrode device composed of C doped MoS2/CoP/MoO2 delivers 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at a low potential of 1.51&#8197;V and can be easily driven by a single AA battery. This work provides a new design strategy of C doped ternary heterostructures for electrocatalysis and related energy applications.

         <title>Cs2AgBiCl6: a Novel, High&#8208;Efficient and Stable Visible&#8208;Light Photocatalyst for Degradation of Organic Dyes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Let there be light: Cs2AgBiCl6 can rapidly degrade organic dyes under visible light, demonstrating an excellent photocatalytic activity, and has a good cycle stability, which indicate that Cs2AgBiCl6 may be a promising material to develop novel, high&#8208;efficient and stable visible&#8208;light photocatalyst.







Abstract
In the past decades, great efforts have been made to develop novel visible&#8208;light photocatalysts to achieve high photocatalytic efficiency by utilizing visible light, the largest proportion of solar energy. As a new type of photocatalyst materials, all&#8208;inorganic lead&#8208;free halide double perovskites have begun to attract widespread interest. Herein, double perovskite Cs2AgBiCl6 was developed into a visible&#8208;light photocatalyst for degrading organic dyes. Cs2AgBiCl6 was prepared by the hydrochloric acid precipitation and anti&#8208;solvent recrystallization methods, respectively, and was used to degrade organic dyes under visible light. Samples prepared by the anti&#8208;solvent recrystallization method are smaller than those prepared by the hydrochloric acid precipitation method, which can degrade 95.7&#8201;% of Sudan III in 10&#8197;min and show excellent photocatalytic activity. The cyclic experiments demonstrate that Cs2AgBiCl6 has a good cycle stability. Moreover, Cs2AgBiCl6&#8208;AS also exhibits good photocatalytic degradation ability for Methyl red and Malachite green. These distinctive results indicate that Cs2AgBiCl6 may be a promising material for developing novel, high&#8208;efficient and stable visible&#8208;light photocatalysts.

         <title>Electron&#8208;Rich MoIV3&#8208;Polyoxomolybdates Resembling the Paratungstic Archetype</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
[MoIV3MoV6MoVI4O32(OH)2py9](anti&#8208;1) from [MoIV3O2(O2CCH3)(H2O)3]2+ presents the first POMs built of MoIV3/MoV2/d1&#8208;MoV/MoVI and 11e&#8208;reduced Mo derivative of the paratungstic archetype. Anti&#8208;2&#8208;5 represents the first alkoxyl&#8208;bridged MoIV3&#8722;POMs. 6/7 comes from replacing {MoV=O}3+/MoVI in 1 by {CrIIIpy}3+/WVI. Complete substitution of MoVI of 1 with WVI affords diamagnetic syn&#8208;8 resulting from anti&#8594;syn conversion followed by MoV&#8208;MoV bonding. Spin distribution/interaction has been investigated both experimentally and theoretically. Hydrogen transfer catalysis is examined by Lewis catalysis field theory.







Abstract
The first polyoxometalates (POMs) composed of MoIV, MoV2, discrete d1&#8208;MoV and MoVI, [MoIV3MoV6MoVI4O32(&#956;2&#8208;OH)(&#956;3&#8208;OH)py9] (1), was prepared from the solvothermal partial oxidation of [MoIV3O2(O2CCH3)6(H2O)3]ZnCl4 in a mixture of pyridine and water. The MoV=O adduct&#8208;free unit [H2Mo12O33py9] presents the 11e&#8208;reduced Mo derivative of the paratungtic archetype. The use of methanol, ethanol, n&#8208;propyl alcohol and triglycol instead of water produced the isostructural [MoIV3MoV6MoVI4O32(&#956;3&#8208;OH)(&#956;2&#8208;OR)py9](R=CH3, 2; C2H5, 3; C3H7, 4; C2H4OH, 5), providing the first examples of MoIV3&#8722;POMs containing bridging alkoxyl groups. The addition of [CrIIIMo6O24]9&#8722; led to the substitution of {MoV=O}3+ with {CrIII&#8208;py}3+ in the allomer [MoIV3MoV5MoVI4CrIIIO32(&#956;&#8208;OH)2py10] (6). Using a mixture of Mo3 and MoW2 precursors afforded WVI&#8208;incorporated allomer [MoIV3MoV6MoVIWVI3O32(&#956;&#8208;OH)2py9] (7). The complete substitution of MoVI with WVI by using a mixture of the Mo2W, MoW2 and W3 precursors produced the diamagnetic [MoIV3MoV6WVI4O33(&#956;3&#8208;OH)py9]&#8722; (syn&#8208;8) resulting from the anti&#8594;syn conversion between the top and bottom M3 triads concomitant with MoV&#8208;MoV bonding. Both anti&#8208;1&#8208;7 and syn&#8208;8 have been characterized by X&#8208;ray single crystal structural analyses. The spin distribution and magnetic interactions have been investigated by temperature&#8208;dependent magnetic susceptibility and DFT theoretical calculations. Heterogeneous hydrogen transfer catalysis has been examined by the Lewis catalysis field (LCF) theory.

Overcoming Energy Transfer for the metallophotoredox catalyzed decarboxylative alkenylation between alkylcarboxylic acids and enol triflates.







Abstract
Herein we report on the decarboxylative alkenylation between alkyl carboxylic acids and enol triflates. The reaction is mediated by a dual catalytic nickel and iridium system, operating under visible light irradiation. Two competing catalytic pathways, from the excited state iridium photocatalyst, are identified. One is energy transfer from the excited state, resulting in formation of an undesired enol ester. The desired pathway involves electron transfer, resulting in decarboxylation to ultimately give the target product. The use of a highly oxidizing iridium photocatalyst is essential to control the reactivity. A diverse array of enol triflates and alkyl carboxylic acids are investigated, providing both scope and limitations of the presented methodology.

         <title>An Efficient Light&#8208;Mediated Protocol for the Direct Amide Bond Formation via a Novel Carboxylic Acid Photoactivation Mode by Pyridine&#8208;CBr4</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A UVA&#8208;light&#8208;mediated synthesis of amides from carboxylic acids and amines or amino acids is presented, taking advantage of a novel photoactivation mode using pyridine&#8208;CBr4. Mechanistic studies by DI&#8208;HRMS provide experimental evidence for the formation of various intermediates. Application in the synthesis of industrially interesting or bioactive compounds was demonstrated.







Abstract
The direct amide bond formation between a carboxylic acid and an amine still constitutes a challenging reaction for both academia and industry. We demonstrate herein that several pairs of amines (halogen bond acceptors) and organohalogen sources may be used for the photochemical amidation reaction under either UVA or sunlight irradiation. Our studies led to the identification of pyridine&#8208;CBr4 as an efficient agent to perform amide synthesis under LED 370&#8197;nm irradiation, avoiding super&#8208;stoichiometric quantities. An extended substrate scope was demonstrated, showing that the widely used amino and carboxyl protecting groups are compatible with this photochemical protocol, while a number of industrially interesting products and bioactive compounds were synthesized. Direct infusion&#8208;high resolution mass spectrometry studies suggest an unprecedented type of carboxylic acid activation mode upon irradiation, involving the generation of a symmetric anhydride, an active ester with pyridine N&#8208;oxide and a mixed anhydride with hypobromous acid.

         <title>Combining Enantioselective Rh&#8208;Catalyzed Conjugate Addition and Ir&#8208;Catalyzed Allylic Alkylation in Stereodivergent, Multicomponent Coupling Reactions to Form Three Stereocenters
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The stereodivergent three&#8208;component coupling of enones, aryl boron nucleophiles and allyl carbonates can be achieved with a combination of Rh&#8208; and Ir&#8208;based catalysts. Products containing three contiguous stereocenters can be prepared with &gt;95&#8201;%&#8201;ee and &gt;90&#8201;:&#8201;10&#8197;dr.







Abstract
Stereodivergent dual catalysis has emerged as a powerful tool to selectively prepare all four stereoisomers in molecules containing two chiral centers from common starting materials. Most processes involve the use of two substrates, and it remains challenging to use dual catalyst approaches to generate molecules having three newly formed stereocenters with high diastereo&#8208; and enantioselectivity. Here we report a multicomponent, stereodivergent method for the synthesis of targets containing three contiguous stereocenters by the combination of enantioselective Rh&#8208;catalyzed conjugate addition and Ir&#8208;catalyzed allylic alkylation methodologies. Both cyclic and acyclic &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated ketones undergo &#946;&#8208;arylation using aryl boron reagents to form an enolate nucleophile that can be subsequently allylated at the &#945;&#8208;position. The reactions proceed often with &gt;95&#8201;%&#8201;ee and with &gt;90&#8201;:&#8201;10&#8197;dr. Epimerization at the &#945;&#8208;carbonyl center enables the preparation of any of the eight possible stereoisomers from common starting materials, as demonstrated for cyclohexanone products.

         <dc:description>
Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free oxidation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) utilizing environmentally friendly vehicles such as a simple base, molecular oxygen, and green solvent are demonstrated.







Abstract
An environmentally friendly oxidation system has proposed for the practical and scalable production of value&#8208;added 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid from 1&#8197;kg of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural. The system is composed of a simple base, oxygen, and a green solvent, thereby providing a sustainable and economical approach to organic synthesis. To gain insight into the mechanism of this oxidation process, NMR spectroscopic analysis and kinetic study are used for the mechanistic investigation of this environmentally friendly oxidation process.

         <title>A Playground for Heavy Atom Tunnelling: Neutral Substitutional Defect Rearrangement from Diamondoids to Diamonds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomic impurities in small and large diamond&#8208;like clusters can be rearranged by heavy atom quantum tunnelling. Computations show how the rate of reaction depends on the nature of the atom, the temperature, and the size of the cage. Moreover, it can be artificially accelerated by external electric fields, an effect that might be exploited to create atomic memory devices.







Abstract
Many diamond properties are defined by substitutional defects (i.&#8201;e., a carbon atom replaced by another element), which may involve the formation of structural isomers that can interconvert. Herein, we analysed by computational means the structure, thermodynamics, and kinetics of substitutional nitrogen, boron, and oxygen from small diamondoids up to the diamond bulk, focusing on the possibility of heavy atom quantum tunnelling rearrangement between the isomers. The large range of threshold energies and bond lengths lead to a variety of intriguing behaviours, including cage size dependent thermally activated tunnelling of nitrogen, and quantum delocalization of boron. In addition, we predict that applying an external electric field makes it possible to control the rearrangement thermodynamics and kinetics through tunnelling, which lets us hypothesize that these systems can potentially be used as atomic memory devices.

         <title>&#960;&#8208;Extension of the Tribenzotriquinacene Framework: Efficient Vinylene and Arylene Bay Bridging Based on a New C3&#8208;Symmetric Key Derivative</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyaromatic compounds: The C3&#8208;symmetric tribromotribenzotriquinacene (TBTQ) derivative 6, easily prepared from readily available starting materials, serves as a key compound for the threefold 1,2&#8208;arylene as well as vinylene bay&#8208;bridging of the TBTQ core.







Abstract
1,5,9&#8208;Tribromo&#8208;2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexamethoxy&#8208;4b1&#8208;methyltribenzotriquinacene, a C3&#8208;symmetric TBTQ derivative, can be prepared conveniently and with high regioselectivity from readily available starting materials. It is a versatile key compound for the synthesis of other chiral 1,5,9&#8208;trifunctionalized TBTQ derivatives and &#960;&#8208;extended congeners in which the bays of the TBTQ skeleton are bridged by vinylene and 1,2&#8208;arylene units. X&#8208;ray crystal structure analysis and UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy show that vinylene bay&#8208;bridging enables better &#960;&#8208;conjugation with the arene rings of the TBTQ core than 1,2&#8208;arylene bay&#8208;bridging does.

         <title>DFT Mechanistic Investigation on Manganese Pincer Complex Catalysed Cross&#8208;Coupling of Methanol with Benzyl Alcohol to Afford Methyl Benzoate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A density functional theory (DFT) study unveils the nature of the cross&#8208;coupling of methanol with benzyl alcohol to afford methyl benzoate catalysed by Mn&#8208;PNN pincer complex. Three catalytic cycles of the dehydrogenation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde, the coupling of benzaldehyde with methanol to hemiacetal and the dehydrogenation of hemiacetal to methyl benzoate were investigated.







Abstract
In this paper the density functional theory (DFT) method was employed to investigate the cross&#8208;coupling of methanol with benzyl alcohol to afford methyl benzoate, catalysed by Mn&#8208;PNN pincer complex. The whole reaction process mainly includes three stages: the dehydrogenation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde, the coupling of benzaldehyde with methanol to hemiacetal and the dehydrogenation of hemiacetal to methyl benzoate. The calculated results indicated that two dehydrogenation processes are influenced by two competitive mechanisms of inner and outer spheres. Dehydrogenation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde is the rate&#8208;determining step of the whole reaction, with the energy barrier of 22.1&#8197;kcal/mol. In addition, the regeneration of catalyst is also extremely important. Compared with direct dehydrogenation, the dehydrogenation mode assisted by formic acid is more advantageous. This work might provide theoretical insights and shed light on the design of cheap transition&#8208;metal catalysts for the dehydrogenation reaction.

         <title>Breaking the DFT Energy Bias Caused by Intramolecular Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding Interactions with MESSI, A Structural Elucidation Method Inspired by Wisdom of Crowd Theory
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
One of the unsolved problems in NMR methods of stereochemical assignment is related to the improper calculation of the conformational landscape of flexible molecules that have functional groups capable of generating a complex network of intramolecular H&#8208;bonding (IHB) interactions. Here the authors present MESSI (Multi&#8208;Ensemble Strategy for Structural Identification), a method inspired by the wisdom of the crowd theory that breaks with the traditional mono&#8208;ensemble approach. By including independent mappings of selected artificially manipulated ensembles, MESSI greatly improves the sense of the assignment by neutralizing potential energy biases.







Abstract
The use of quantum&#8208;based NMR methods to complement and guide the connectivity and stereochemical assignment of natural and unnatural products has grown enormously. One of the unsolved problems is related to the improper calculation of the conformational landscape of flexible molecules that have functional groups capable of generating a complex network of intramolecular H&#8208;bonding (IHB) interactions. Here the authors present MESSI (Multi&#8208;Ensemble Strategy for Structural Identification), a method inspired by the wisdom of the crowd theory that breaks with the traditional mono&#8208;ensemble approach. By including independent mappings of selected artificially manipulated ensembles, MESSI greatly improves the sense of the assignment by neutralizing potential energy biases.

         <title>Symmetrically Functionalized Copper and Silver Corrole&#8208;Bis&#8208;Tetracyanobutadiene Push&#8208;Pull Conjugates: Efficient Population of Triplet States via Charge Transfer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Copper and silver tritolylcorroles (TTC) are symmetrically functionalized to carry two tetracyanobutadiene (TCBD) entities via [2+2] cycloaddition&#8208;retroeletrocyclization reaction involving functionalized corroles with an electron acceptor, tetracyanoethylene (TCNE) in excellent yields, as the first examples of corrole&#8208;TCBD push&#8208;pull systems. The strong push&#8208;pull effect resulted in charge polarization in the ground state resulting in a considerable hypsochromic shift, extending the absorption&#160;into the near&#8208;IR region. Electrochemical and computational studies revealed interactions between the TCBD entities via the corrole &#960;&#8208;system and the degree of such interactions was found to depend on the metal ion present in the corrole cavity. Energy considerations suggested charge transfer (CT) from the S2 or vibrationally hot S1 state but not the relaxed S1 state in the case of CuTTC(TCBD)2 while CT to occur from all these states in the case of AgTTC(TCBD)2. Additionally, the high&#8208;energy CT states populate the low&#8208;lying triplet states. Systematic femtosecond pump&#8208;probe studies provided the ultimate proof for the occurrence of excited CT as a function of excitation wavelength followed by the efficient population of the triplet states. The present study brings out the significance of charge transfer in efficiently populating the triplet states in rather unusual copper and silver corroles carrying two TCBD entities.</dc:description>

         <title>Pushing the boundary of covalency in lanthanoid&#8208;tellurium bonds: Insights from synthesis, molecular and electronic structures of low&#8208;coordinate, monomeric europium(II) and ytterbium(II) tellurolates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Owing to the strict hard/soft dichotomy between the lanthanoids and tellurium atoms, and the strong affinity of lanthanoid ions for high coordination numbers, low&#8208;coordinate, monomeric lanthanoid tellurolate complexes have remained elusive as compared to the lanthanoid complexes with lighter group 16 elements (O, S, and Se). This makes the development of suitable ligand systems for low&#8208;coordinate, monomeric lanthanoid tellurolate complexes an appealing endeavor. In a first report, a series of low&#8208;coordinate, monomeric lanthanoid (Yb, Eu) tellurolate complexes were synthesized by utilizing the secondary bonding interaction stabilized hybrid organotellurolate ligands. The reaction of bis[2&#8208;((dimethylamino)methyl)phenyl] ditelluride, 1 and 8,8'&#8208;diquinolinyl ditelluride, 2 with Ln0 metal (Ln = Eu, Yb) resulted in the formation of monomeric complexes [LnII(TeR)2(Solv)2] [R = C6H4(CH2NMe2)&#8208;2] [3: Ln = Eu, Solv = tetrahydrofuran; 4: Ln = Eu, Solv = acetonitrile; 5: Ln = Yb, Solv = tetrahydrofuran; 6: Ln = Yb, Solv = pyridine] and [EuII(TeNC9H6)2(Solv)n] (7: Solv = tetrahydrofuran, n = 3; 8: Solv = 1,2&#8208;dimethoxyethane, n = 2), respectively. Complexes 3&#8208;4 and 7&#8208;8 represent the first sets of examples of monomeric europium tellurolate complexes.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Owing to the strict hard/soft dichotomy between the lanthanoids and tellurium atoms, and the strong affinity of lanthanoid ions for high coordination numbers, low-coordinate, monomeric lanthanoid tellurolate complexes have remained elusive as compared to the lanthanoid complexes with lighter group 16 elements (O, S, and Se). This makes the development of suitable ligand systems for low-coordinate, monomeric lanthanoid tellurolate complexes an appealing endeavor. In a first report, a series of low-coordinate, monomeric lanthanoid (Yb, Eu) tellurolate complexes were synthesized by utilizing the secondary bonding interaction stabilized hybrid organotellurolate ligands. The reaction of bis[2-((dimethylamino)methyl)phenyl] ditelluride, 1 and 8,8'-diquinolinyl ditelluride, 2 with Ln0 metal (Ln = Eu, Yb) resulted in the formation of monomeric complexes [LnII(TeR)2(Solv)2] [R = C6H4(CH2NMe2)-2] [3: Ln = Eu, Solv = tetrahydrofuran; 4: Ln = Eu, Solv = acetonitrile; 5: Ln = Yb, Solv = tetrahydrofuran; 6: Ln = Yb, Solv = pyridine] and [EuII(TeNC9H6)2(Solv)n] (7: Solv = tetrahydrofuran, n = 3; 8: Solv = 1,2-dimethoxyethane, n = 2), respectively. Complexes 3-4 and 7-8 represent the first sets of examples of monomeric europium tellurolate complexes. The molecular structures of complexes 3-8 are validated by single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Generation and Characterization of a Tetraradical Embedded in a Curved Cyclic Paraphenylene Unit</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Unique spin&#8211;spin (magnetic) interactions, ring&#8208;size effects on ground&#8208;state spin multiplicity, and in&#8208;plane aromaticity has been found in localized 1,3&#8208;diradicals embedded in curved benzene structures such as cycloparaphenylene (CPP). In this study, we characterized the magnetic interactions in a tetraradical consisting of two localized 1,3&#8208;diradical units connected by p&#8208;quaterphenyl within a curved CPP skeleton by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy and quantum chemical calculations. Persistent triplet species with zero&#8208;field splitting parameters similar to those of a triplet 1,3&#8208;diphenylcyclopentane&#8208;1,3&#8208;diyl diradical were observed by continuous wave (CW) or pulsed X&#8208;band EPR measurements. The quintet state derived from the ferromagnetic interaction between the two triplet diradical moieties was not detected at 20 K under glassy matrix conditions. At the B3LYP/6&#8208;31G(d) level of theory, the singlet state was lower in energy than the triplet and quintet states. These findings will aid in the development of open&#8208;shell species for material science application.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of a Hybrid Composed of Anisotropic Niobate Layers Modified with MoC Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Layer cake: The in&#8197;situ deposition of MoC in liquid phase in the presence of the double&#8208;layered nanosheets led to the formation of the new hybrid composed of MoC nanoparticles on the nanosheets, which can be regarded as a stacking of the two layers with anisotropically modified nanoparticles.







Abstract
The hybrid composed of anisotropic niobate layers modified with MoC nanoparticles is synthesized by multistep reactions. The stepwise interlayer reactions for layered hexaniobate induce selective surface modification at the alternate interlayers, and the following ultrasonication leads to the formation of double&#8208;layered nanosheets. The further liquid phase MoC deposition with the double&#8208;layered nanosheets leads to the decoration of MoC nanoparticles on the surfaces of the double&#8208;layered nanosheets. The new hybrid can be regarded as a stacking of the two layers with anisotropically modified nanoparticles. The relatively high temperature in the MoC synthesis causes partial leaching of the grafted phosphonate groups. The exposed surface of the niobate nanosheets due to the partial leaching may interact with MoC to succeed in the hybridization. The hybrid after heating exhibits photocatalytic activity, indicating that this hybridization method can be useful for hybrid synthesis of semiconductor nanosheets and co&#8208;catalyst nanoparticles toward photocatalytic application.

         <title>Reactivity of Yellow Arsenic towards Cyclic (Alkyl)(Amino) Carbenes (CAACs)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbenes (CAACs) are reacted with yellow arsenic. Depending on the CAAC used, aggregation, fragmentation and/or rearrangement of yellow arsenic occur to form novel As2&#8208;, iso&#8208;As4&#8208; and As8&#8208;units substituted by CAAC units.







Abstract
Different cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbenes (CAACs) were reacted with yellow arsenic. Several products [(CAAC&#8208;n)2(&#956;,&#951;1:1&#8208;As2)] (n=1 (1), 4 (2)), [(CAAC&#8208;2)3(&#956;3,&#951;1:1:1&#8208;As4)] (3) and [(CAAC&#8208;3)4(&#956;4,&#951;1:1:1:1&#8208; As8)] (6) were isolated due to the differing steric properties of CAAC&#8208;1&#8208;4. The products contain As2, As4 or As8 units and represent the first examples of CAACs&#8208;substituted products of yellow arsenic. The reactivity of As4 was compared with the reactivities of P4 and the interpnictogen compound AsP3, which led to a series of phosphorus&#8208;containing derivatives such as ([(CAAC&#8208;3)3(&#956;3,&#951;1:1:1&#8208;P4)] (4) and [(CAAC&#8208;3)4(&#956;4,&#951;1:1:1:1&#8208;P8)] (7)) and [(CAAC&#8208;3)3(&#956;3,&#951;1:1:1&#8208;AsP3)] (5). The products were characterized by spectroscopic and crystallographic methods and DFT computations were performed to clarify their formation pathway.

         <title>Coordination versus Insertion: On the Interaction of 5&#8201;d&#8208;Transition Metal Carbonyl Clusters with Silver(I)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Feeding M&#8722;M bonds: The transition metal carbonyls Re2(CO)10 and Ir4(CO)12 form adducts with silver(I) cations, leading to the respective monocationic 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 cluster ions. Yet the structural motifs differ: insertion and bent&#8208;coordination for Re but edge&#8208;coordination for Ir. Both are discussed and further analyzed with computational methods.







Abstract
The title silver(I) complex salts [Ag{Re2(CO)10}{Re(CO)5}2]+[Al(ORF)4]&#8722; (AgRe4; ORF=&#8208;OC(CF3)3) and [Ag{Ir4(CO)12}2]+[Al(ORF)4]&#8722; (AgIr8) form upon reaction of Ag+[Al(ORF)4]&#8722; and the transition metal carbonyls (TMCs) Re2(CO)10 and Ir4(CO)12 respectively. The solid&#8208;state structure of the AgRe4 cluster shows an unexpected asymmetric coordination motif, wherein the silver(I) cation has inserted into the Re&#8722;Re bond of one Re2(CO)10 moiety, while the other dirhenium carbonyl coordinates only over one metal atom towards the silver(I) cation. The AgIr8 cluster is formed by the edge&#8208;on coordination of two Ir4 tetrahedra and the silver cation in a D2 symmetric fashion with a torsion angle of 46.5&#176;. QTAIM analysis shows bond paths between the silver atom and the nearby metal atoms in all cases, whereas only the non&#8208;inserted Re2(CO)10 moiety shows additional bond paths between the carbonyl ligands and the silver cation. In addition, the insertion of the Ag+ cation into the Re&#8722;Re bond in Re2(CO)10 removes the bond path between the two rhenium atoms. The EDA&#8208;NOCV analysis suggests an increase of the interaction energy between the silver(I) cation and the respective metal carbonyls from the metal centered transition metal carbonyl (TMC) donors W(CO)6&lt;Re2(CO)10&lt;Os3(CO)12&lt;Ir4(CO)12. In all cases, the dominating orbital interaction is &#963;&#8208;donation [TMC]&#8594;Ag+&#8592;[TMC].

The solid-state structure of the AgRe&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; cluster shows an unexpected asymmetric coordination motif, wherein the silver(I) cation has inserted into the Re&#8722;Re bond of one Re&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(CO)&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; moiety, while the other dirhenium carbonyl coordinates only over one metal atom towards the silver(I) cation. The AgIr&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; cluster is formed by the &lt;i&gt;edge-on&lt;/i&gt; coordination of two Ir&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; tetrahedra and the silver cation in a &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; symmetric fashion with a torsion angle of 46.5&#176;. QTAIM analysis shows bond paths between the silver atom and the nearby metal atoms in all cases, whereas only the non-inserted Re&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(CO)&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; moiety shows additional bond paths between the carbonyl ligands and the silver cation. In addition, the insertion of the Ag&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cation into the Re&#8722;Re bond in Re&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(CO)&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; removes the bond path between the two rhenium atoms. The EDA-NOCV analysis suggests an increase of the interaction energy between the silver(I) cation and the respective metal carbonyls from the metal centered transition metal carbonyl (TMC) donors W(CO)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;lt;Re&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(CO)&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;lt;Os&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(CO)&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;lt;Ir&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(CO)&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;. In all cases, the dominating orbital interaction is &#963;-donation [TMC]&#8594;Ag&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&#8592;[TMC].&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Four New Sb&#8208;based Orthophosphates: Cation Regulation to Investigate Diversified Structural Architecture</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two cases of Rb&#8208;containing Sb&#8208;based phosphates were discovered for the first time and the abundant coordination of Sb atoms can effectively regulate the skeleton to produce novel anionic groups, which can greatly enrich the structural chemistry and practical properties of phosphates.







Abstract
In the work, four new Sb&#8208;based phosphates, K4(SbO2)5(PO4)3, Rb(SbO2)2PO4, Rb3(SbO2)3(PO4)2 and Cs3(SbO2)3(PO4)2(H2O)1.32, were successfully synthesized by a high&#8208;temperature melt method. Among them, Rb(SbO2)2PO4 and Rb3(SbO2)3(PO4)2 are the first reported examples of Rb&#8208;containing alkali metal Sb&#8208;based phosphates. They show three&#8208;dimensional (3D) frameworks composed of [Sb8P4O30]&#8734; layer for K4(SbO2)5(PO4)3 and [Sb6P2O20]&#8734; layer for Rb(SbO2)2PO4, and 2D lamellar structure composed of [Sb3P2O10]&#8734; for Rb3(SbO2)3(PO4)2 and Cs3(SbO2)3(PO4)2(H2O)1.32. A detailed structural comparison shows that the structure dimensions for them transfer from 1D to complex 3D framework with the increase of (Sb+P)/O ratio, which affects performances of the compounds. Optical property and energy band structure calculations were also carried out based on the density functional theory (DFT). The present study enriches the diversity of Sb&#8208;based phosphates and paves the way for further explore their optical properties in the future.

         <title>TLC&#8208;Freeze SERS: A&#160;Powerful Tool for Monitoring Synthetic Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Thin layer chromatography (TLC) is widely used to confirm the formation of the target compound in chemical synthesis. The key issue in TLC is spot identification relying on retention factors. Coupling of TLC with surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS), which gives direct molecular information, is a possible choice, to overcome this challenge. However, interference from the stationary phase and impurities on the nanoparticles added for SERS measurements significantly degrades TLC&#8208;SERS efficiency. We have found that freezing effectively eliminates such interferences and dramatically improves the performance of TLC&#8208;SERS. This study shows that TLC&#8208;freeze SERS is a powerful tool for monitoring essential organic reactions. This method can identify the product and side&#8208;products of similar structures, detect compounds with high sensitivity, and provide information of quantities that allows the reliable determination of the reaction time based on kinetic analysis.</dc:description>

         <title>New Opportunities in Metal Organic Framework Catalysis: From Bifunctional to Frustrated Lewis Pairs Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This article highlights novel prospects for metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) in heterogeneous catalysis as having frustrated Lewis acid&#8208;base pairs (FLPs) or as bifunctional acid&#8208;base solid catalysts able to activate molecular hydrogen. Starting from the extensive application MOFs as Lewis acid and Lewis base catalysts, this article uses catalytic hydrogenation to briefly summarize the efforts made to heterogenize boron and amine in MOFs to mimic molecular FLP systems. The core of this concept is based on recent findings1 which demonstrate the ability of two commonly used MOFs, namely UiO&#8208;66 and MIL&#8208;101, to catalyze the selective hydrogenation of polar double X=Y bonds at moderate H2 pressures below 10 bar. The influence of electron&#8208;donating, the withdrawal of substituents on the linker, and the aniline poisoning effect highlight the significance of Lewis acid sites, while density&#8208;functional theory calculations indicate the heterolytic H&#8208;H bond cleavage at the MOF metal oxo clusters. It is expected that this new perspective on MOFs as solid FLP systems will spur further research to explore and define the potential of dual sites in the catalytic activation of small molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure&#8208;induced Intelligence of Liquid Crystal Elastomers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) are active soft matter&#8208;based materials with strong stimulus responsiveness and reversible, large&#8208;shape morphing capabilities. LCEs have demonstrated broad and growing applications in soft robotics, wearable devices, artificial muscles, and optical machines. The actuation intelligence and advanced functionality of LCEs depend on the smartness and properties of structures. In this review, we discuss recent advances in structure&#8208;induced intelligence of LCEs, specifically the integration of structural properties with the alignment and processing of LCEs. The structural design principles for three categories consisting of common structures (film, fiber, and tubule), smart structures (origami, kirigami, mechanical metamaterial, topology, and topography), and complex structures (monolithic and integrated) are presented. Various alignment controls of LCEs, including mechanical, surface, field&#8208;assisted, and shear alignment, are capable of inducing structural properties. The coupling and collaboration mechanisms of the LCE structures and the generated functions are discussed. The review concludes with perspectives on current challenges and emerging opportunities.</dc:description>

         <title>A DNA Based Dissipation System that Synchronizes Multiple Fuels</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Artificial dissipative networks have emerged as advanced bionic systems for the development of material technology and synthetic biology. Here, we demonstrate a DNA&#8208;based artificial dissipation system that synchronizes multiple energy&#8208;rich molecules (fuels) including oligonucleotide, dNTP, and ATP. The autonomous operation of the dissipation system relies on the integration of DNA reaction network including polymerase extension, kinase phosphorylation, and exonuclease digestion. The use of multiple fuels provides multiple transient states with different energy levels and fine&#8208;tuning dissipative kinetics. The lifetime of the transient state can be programmed to increase or decrease just by varying one of the fuel molecules unlike conventional DNA&#8208;based dissipative systems where the increase in the concentration of fuel molecule increases the lifetime. This design greatly expands the toolkits for establishing dissipative/dynamic DNA networks. The dissipation system is harnessed to dynamically regulate the assembly of DNA nanotubes allowing for controlling the assembly kinetics via multiple fuels. Owing to the multiple transient states in the dissipation system, two nanotubes can be regulated in parallel.

Here, we demonstrate a DNA-based artificial dissipation system that synchronizes multiple energy-rich molecules (fuels) including oligonucleotide, dNTP, and ATP. The autonomous operation of the dissipation system relies on the integration of DNA reaction network including polymerase extension, kinase phosphorylation, and exonuclease digestion. The use of multiple fuels provides multiple transient states with different energy levels and fine-tuning dissipative kinetics. The lifetime of the transient state can be programmed to increase or decrease just by varying one of the fuel molecules unlike conventional DNA-based dissipative systems where the increase in the concentration of fuel molecule increases the lifetime. This design greatly expands the toolkits for establishing dissipative/dynamic DNA networks. The dissipation system is harnessed to dynamically regulate the assembly of DNA nanotubes allowing for controlling the assembly kinetics via multiple fuels. Owing to the multiple transient states in the dissipation system, two nanotubes can be regulated in parallel. We envision that the system would find broad applications in responsive materials, soft robotics, biosensors, and on-demand drug delivery.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>The facile synthesis of stereo&#8208;defined and transformable functionality&#8208;enriched building blocks is of great importance in modern organic chemistry, which allows the rapid and divergent assembly of complex molecules. Reported herein is a halogen electrophile (N&#8208;bromosuccinimide and N&#8208;iodosuccinimide) initiated semipinacol rearrangement reaction of B(MIDA)&#8208;propargylic alcohols (MIDA = N&#8208;methyliminodiacetyl) via aryl migration towards the synthesis of amphoteric &#945;&#8208;haloalkenyl boronates in moderate to good yields with excellent stereoselectivities. The value of the products is evidenced by their ability to undergo divergent conversions to polysubstituted alkenes through manipulation of the C&#8208;B and C&#8208;X (X = Br, I) bonds and the carbonyl group.</dc:description>

         <title>A 2&#8208;Anilidomethylpyridine Ligand Framework Showcasing Hydride Storage and Transfer Abilities in Its Aluminum Chemistry.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dearomatized 1,4&#8208;dihydropyridyl motifs are significant in both chemistry and biology for their potential abilities to deliver the stored hydride, driven by rearomatization. Biological cofactors like nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) and organic &#8216;hydride sources&#8217; like Hantzsch esters are prime examples. An organoaluminum chemistry on a 2&#8208;anilidomethylpyridine framework is reported, where such hydride storage and transfer abilities are displayed by the ligand&#8217;s pyridyl unit. The pyridylmethylaniline proligand (NNLH) is simultaneously deprotonated and 1,4&#8208;hydroaluminated by AlH3(NMe2Et) to [(NNLde)AlH(NMe2Et)] (1; NNLde = hydride&#8208;inserted dearomatized version of NNL). A hydride abstraction by B(C6F5)3 rearomatizes the pyridyl moiety to give the cationic aluminum hydride [(NNL)AlH(NMe2Et)][HB(C6F5)3] (6). Notably, such chemical non&#8208;innocence is priorly unseen in this established ligand class. The hydroalumination mechanism is investigated by isolating the intermediate [(NNL)AlH2] (2) and by control experiments, and is also analyzed by DFT calculation. The results advocate an intriguing &#8216;self&#8208;promoting&#8217; pathway, which underlines alane&#8217;s Lewis acid/Br&#248;nsted base duality. NMe2Et carrying the alane also plays a crucial role. In contrast, the chemistry between NNLH and AlMe3 is much different, giving only [(NNL)AlMe2] (4) from the adduct [(NNLH)AlMe3] (3) by deprotonation but not a subsequent pyridyl dearomatization in the presence or absence of NMe2Et. This divergence is also justified by DFT analyses.</dc:description>

         <title>Flow Electrochemistry for the N&#8208;Nitrosation of Secondary Amines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Go with the flow: N&#8208;Nitroso compounds have been synthesised from secondary amines by using sodium nitrite in an electrochemical flow setup. A 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 mixture of acetonitrile and water was used for this reaction, making this a mild approach avoiding the use of additional supporting electrolytes. N&#8208;Nitrosamines could be obtained in yields up to 99&#8201;%, and several compounds could be purified with an in&#8208;line acidic extraction.







Abstract
A flow electrochemical method towards the synthesis of N&#8208;nitroso compounds from secondary amines using cheap and readily available sodium nitrite has been developed. Sodium nitrite dissolved in aqueous acetonitrile made additional electrolytes unnecessary. This mild and straightforward approach made the use of acids or other harsh and toxic chemicals redundant. This procedure was applied to an assortment of cyclic and acyclic secondary amines (27 examples) resulting in yields of N&#8208;nitrosamines as high as 99&#8201;%. To demonstrate the practicality of the process, scaled&#8208;up reactions were performed. Finally, selected products could be purified by using an in&#8208;line acidic extraction.

         <title>A Cytoplasm&#8208;Specific Fluorescent Ligand for Selective Imaging of RNA G&#8208;Quadruplexes in Live Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fluorescent ligand is designed as a cytoplasm&#8208;specific probe targeting RNA G4s including VEGF, NRAS and BCL2 in live cancer cells. The ligand is demonstrated for the first time in real&#8208;time visualization of RNA G4&#8208;resolving process with the overexpressed RFP&#8208;tagged DHX36 helicase in live HeLa cells and could be a nontoxic and highly selective fluorescent tool for the study of RNA G4s of cancer hallmarks at low concentration for their cancer biology in live human cells.







Abstract
The development of site&#8208;specific, target&#8208;selective and biocompatible small molecule ligands as a fluorescent tool for real&#8208;time study of cellular functions of RNA G&#8208;quadruplexes (G4s), which are associated with human cancers, is of significance in cancer biology. We report a fluorescent ligand that is a cytoplasm&#8208;specific and RNA G4&#8208;selective fluorescent biosensor in live HeLa cells. The in&#8197;vitro results show that the ligand is highly selective targeting RNA G4s including VEGF, NRAS, BCL2 and TERRA. These G4s are recognized as human cancer hallmarks. Moreover, intracellular competition studies with BRACO19 and PDS, and the colocalization study with G4&#8208;specific antibody (BG4) in HeLa cells may support that the ligand selectively binds to G4s in cellulo. Furthermore, the ligand was demonstrated for the first time in the visualization and monitoring of dynamic resolving process of RNA G4s by the overexpressed RFP&#8208;tagged DHX36 helicase in live HeLa cells.

         <title>Minimizing Product Inhibition in DNA Self&#8208;Replication: Insights for Prebiotic Replication from the Role of the Enzyme in Lesion&#8208;Induced DNA Amplification
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ligase chain reaction lesion&#8208;induced DNA amplification exhibits rapid self&#8208;replication avoiding the product inhibition problem of most nucleic acid systems. We find the abasic lesion destabilizes the product duplex more than the intermediate complex narrowing their stability gap. The selective stabilization of the intermediate complex by the enzyme also contributes to gap reduction, providing a new framework for overcoming product inhibition.







Abstract
Self&#8208;replication of nucleic acids in the absence of enzymes represents an important and poorly understood step in the origin of life as such reported systems are strongly hindered by product inhibition. Studying one of the few successful examples of enzymatic DNA self&#8208;replication based on a simple ligation chain reaction, lesion&#8208;induced DNA amplification (LIDA), can shed light on how this fundamental process may have originally evolved. To identify the unknown factors that lead LIDA to overcome product inhibition we have employed isothermal titration calorimetry and global fitting of time&#8208;dependent ligation data to characterize the individual steps of the amplification process. We find that incorporating the abasic lesion into one of the four primers substantially decreases the stability difference between the product and intermediate complexes compared with complexes without the abasic group. In the presence of T4 DNA ligase this stability gap is further reduced by two orders of magnitude revealing that the ligase also helps overcome product inhibition. Kinetic simulations reveal that the intermediate complex stability and the magnitude of the ligation rate constant significantly impact the rate of self&#8208;replication, suggesting that catalysts that both facilitate ligation and stabilize the intermediate complex might be a route to efficient nonenzymatic replication.

         <title>Chalcogen Atom Size Dictates Stability of Benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triamide Polymers: Overlooked Role of Geometrical Fit for Enhanced Hydrogen Bonding</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A matter of size! Quantum chemical analyses reveal that replacement of O in benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triamides with the larger chalcogens S or Se enhances the stability of the corresponding hydrogen&#8208;bonded polymers due to two unexpected reasons: i) the monomers have a better geometrical fit, and ii) can engage in stronger covalent and dispersion interactions.







Abstract
Our quantum chemical analyses elucidated how the replacement of O in the amide bonds of benzene&#8208;1,3&#8208;5&#8208;tricarboxamides (OBTAs) with the larger chalcogens S and Se enhances the intermolecular interactions and thereby the stability of the obtained hydrogen&#8208;bonded supramolecular polymers due to two unexpected reasons: i)&#8197;the SBTA and SeBTA monomers have a better geometry for self&#8208;assembly and ii)&#8197;induce stronger covalent (hydrogen&#8208;bond) interactions besides enhanced dispersion interactions. In addition, it is shown that the cooperativity in benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triamide (BTA) self&#8208;assembly is caused by charge separation in the &#963;&#8208;electronic system following the covalency in the hydrogen bonds.

         <title>Construction of Pd&#8208;Co&#8208;Doped CdS Heterojunctions as Efficient Platforms in Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient nanostructured heterojunctions: CdS/palladium/cobalt hybrids were readily prepared through a versatile hydrothermal process. The enhancement of photocatalytic activity towards the degradation of an organic dye originates from efficient carrier separation through either reductive as well as oxidative paths.







Abstract
In this work, we present the structural, optical and photocatalytic properties of CdS semiconducting nanostructures, doped with palladium&#8208; and cobalt&#8208;based species. XRD analysis, corroborated by Raman and XPS, demonstrated the growth of CdS crystallites in the hexagonal structure, whereas solvothermal conversion of neat precursor metal salts resulted in the formation of metallic Pd and cobalt oxide, respectively. Scanning electron microscopy imaging certified the dendritic structure of hybrids, especially in the case where CdS was grown in the presence of either palladium&#8208; or cobalt&#8208;based nanoparticles. XPS surface analysis revealed that a major fraction of metallic Pd nanoparticles was converted to PdO during the in&#8197;situ growth of CdS nanoparticles. The oxidation of Pd nanoparticles could be ascribed to chemisorption of oxygen phases onto the metal surface. The presence of cocatalyst nanoparticles resulted in an appreciable shift of the absorption edge of the ternary hybrids by about 50&#8197;nm. The optimized hybrid was found to photodegrade Orange G dye almost quantitatively within 2&#8197;h, by simulated solar light irradiation. Scavenging experiments revealed that hydroxy radicals were the main transient intermediate, leading to the oxidative degradation of the dye.

         <title>Resonance&#8208;Enhanced Emission Effects toward Dual&#8208;State Emissive Bright Red and Near&#8208;Infrared Emitters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Resonance&#8208;enhanced emission effect was successfully employed to design and synthesize red and NIR emitters with merits including dual&#8208;state emission, high brightness, large Stokes shift, and low cost.







Abstract
Resonance&#8208;enhanced emission (REE) effect was discovered and lead to a novel dye family of hydrostyryl pyridinium derivatives in our recent work. Herein, the REE effect was employed to design a red and near&#8208;infrared dual&#8208;state emissive fluorophore family of SW&#8722;OH&#8722;NO2 derivatives which were easily synthesized by coupling an electron&#8208;withdrawing group (W) onto nitro(hydroxyl)styryl (S&#8722;OH&#8722;NO2) through a C=C double bond as &#960;&#8208;bridge. The deprotonation of a phenolic hydroxyl group promoted by a nitro group and the electron&#8208;withdrawing group (W) on the other side of the &#960;&#8208;bridge triggered resonance, resulting in significantly red&#8208;shifted emission. All the resultant SW&#8722;OH&#8722;NO2 compounds showed excellent dual&#8208;state emission behavior. Remarkably, hydrostyryl quinolinium (SQ&#8722;OH&#8722;NO2) is one of the smallest NIR emitter molecular skeleton (&#955;em=725&#8197;nm, MW&lt;400) and showed dual&#8208;state emission characteristics and obvious viscosity&#8208;depended fluorescent behaviors. In addition to constructing electron donor&#8208;acceptor structures and prolonging &#960;&#8208;bridges, the REE effect promises a reliable strategy toward novel fluorophores with small size, long emissive wavelength, and dual&#8208;emission characteristics, and importantly, feasible industrial manufactures and applications due to their easy and low&#8208;cost synthesis strategy.

         <title>Integrating Tetrathiafulvalene and Nickel&#8208;Bis(dithiolene) Units into Donor&#8208;Acceptor Covalent Organic Frameworks for Stable and Efficient Photothermal Conversion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of tetrathiafulvalene and Ni&#8208;bis(dithiolene) units gives rise to a donor&#8208;acceptor covalent organic framework with high chemical/thermal stability and efficient near&#8208;infrared/solar photothermal conversion performance.







Abstract
Tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) and Ni&#8208;bis(dithiolene) are typical conductive units widely studied in electronics, optics, and photochemistry. However, their applications in near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photothermal conversion are often limited by insufficient NIR absorption and low chemical/thermal stability. Herein, we integrate TTF and Ni&#8208;bis(dithiolene) into a covalent organic framework (COF) with stable and efficient NIR and solar photothermal conversion performance. Two isostructural COFs, namely Ni&#8208;TTF and TTF&#8208;TTF, are successfully isolated which are composed of TTF and Ni&#8208;bis(dithiolene) units as donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8722;A) pairs or TTF units only. Both COFs show high BET surface areas and good chemical/thermal stability. Notably, compared with TTF&#8208;TTF, the periodic D&#8722;A arrangement in Ni&#8208;TTF significantly lowers the bandgap, leading to unprecedented NIR and solar photothermal conversion performance.

         <title>Synthesis and Crystallographic Characterization of Helical Hairpin Oligourea Foldamers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
United we stand: Oligomers designed to form helix&#8208;turn&#8208;helix super&#8208;secondary structures have been prepared by covalently bridging aliphatic oligourea foldamer helices with either rigid aromatic or more flexible aliphatic spacers. The relative helix orientation in these dimers was investigated by X&#8208;ray diffraction and in difficult cases using racemic crystallography. Most X&#8208;ray structures reveal well&#8208;defined parallel helical hairpin motifs, irrespective of primary sequence and chain length.

         <title>From Chemotherapy to Phototherapy &#8211; Changing the Therapeutic Action of a Metallo&#8208;Intercalating RuII&#8208;ReI Luminescent System by Switching its Sub&#8208;Cellular Location</title>

         <dc:description>
Chemotherapy: off; phototherapy: on. A small change in the structure of a STED&#8208;compatible RuII&#8208;ReI theranostic complex not only switches its intracellular localisation but also its mode of therapeutic action.







Abstract
The synthesis of a new heterodinuclear ReIRuII metallointercalator containing RuII(dppz) and ReI(dppn) moieties is reported. Cell&#8208;free studies reveal that the complex has similar photophysical properties to its homoleptic M(dppz) analogue and it also binds to DNA with a similar affinity. However, the newly reported complex has very different in&#8208;cell properties to its parent. In complete contrast to the homoleptic system, the RuII(dppz)/ReI(dppn) complex is not intrinsically cytotoxic but displays appreciable phototoxic, despite both complexes displaying very similar quantum yields for singlet oxygen sensitization. Optical microscopy suggests that the reason for these contrasting biological effects is that whereas the homoleptic complex localises in the nuclei of cells, the RuII(dppz)/ReI(dppn) complex preferentially accumulates in mitochondria. These observations illustrate how even small structural changes in metal based therapeutic leads can modulate their mechanism of action.

         <title>Electronically Robust Self&#8208;Assembled Supramolecular Gel as a Potential Material in Triboelectric Nanogenerators</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;assembly of gluconamide conjugated naphthalimide amphiphiles (GCNA) into gel rendered an increased electron density in naphthalimide moiety with overall change in energy of 15.33&#215;10&#8722;32&#8197;J via J&#8208;type aggregation. The enriched electron density in the aggregated GCNA via cooperative intermolecular interactions makes it as an effective electron donor in the fabrication of TENG, which is almost 2.4&#8197;times better in performance than the amorphous form.







Abstract
A series of self&#8208;assembling gluconamide conjugated naphthalimide amphiphiles (GCNA) was synthesized and the self&#8208;assembly of GCNA into gel rendered an increased electron density in naphthalimide moiety with an overall change in energy of 15.33&#215;10&#8722;32&#8197;J via J&#8208;type aggregation. SEM analysis and X&#8208;ray diffraction underpinning the nanofibrillar formation, and rheological measurements confirmed the processablity and material fabrication. The enriched electron density in the aggregated GCNA4 via cooperative intermolecular non&#8208;covalent interactions makes it as effective electron donor in the fabrication of triboelectric nanogenerators (TENG). The TENG based on GCNA4&#8208;polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) triboelectric pair generated an output voltage, current and power density of &#8764;250&#8197;V, 40&#8197;&#956;A and &#8764;622&#8197;mW/m2 respectively, which is almost 2.4&#8197;times better in performance than the amorphous GCNA4 based TENG. The fabricated TENG can power&#8208;up 240 LEDs, wrist watch, thermometer, calculator and hygrometer.

         <title>Flow Synthesis of Gigantic Porphyrinic Cages: Facile Synthesis of P12L24 and Discovery of Kinetic Product P9L18</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we report continuous flow synthesis of gigantic porphyrinic cages by microfluidic approach. The flow synthesis not only increases the yield of P12L24 but also significantly reduces the reaction times. Moreover, we discover a kinetic product P9L18 by varying reaction conditions.







Abstract
A continuous flow methodology for the facile and high&#8208;yielding synthesis of the porphyrin&#8208;based self&#8208;assembled organic cage, P12L24 is reported, along with the serendipitous discovery of a kinetic product, P9L18 cage, which has been characterized by MALDI&#8208;TOF MS, NMR, and AFM analysis. A theoretical study suggests a tricapped trigonal prismatic geometry for P9L18. Unlike P12L24, P9L18 is unstable and readily decomposes into monomers and small oligomers. While the batch synthesis produces only the thermodynamic product P12L24, the continuous flow process generates not only the thermodynamic product but also kinetic products, such as P9L18, illustrating the advantages of the continuous flow process for the synthesis of self&#8208;assembled cages and the exploration of new non&#8208;equilibrium assemblies.

         <title>Promoting Plasmonic Hot Hole Extraction and Photothermal Effect for the Oxygen Evolution Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Au nanoparticles generate photogenerated charge and hot charge of the LSPR effect after illumination, in which electrons are transported to Pt counter electrode for HER with water. Due to the property of NiCoOx that only transmits holes but prevents the transfer of electrons, the holes are transmitted to NiCoOx to react with OH&#8722; to form O2. Therefore, the separation of hot holes produced by the LSPR effect and its catalytic ability of OER are promoted.







Abstract
Boosting oxygen evolution reaction by local surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) provides breakthrough opportunities for the promotion of solar energy conversion; the potential of LSPR, however, has rarely been tapped and investigated. Here, we report the precise regulation of commercial Au nanoparticles plasmonic nanomaterial and OER electrocatalysts, viz., the NiCoOx electrocatalytic layer with hole transport ability and photothermal effect is prepared on the surface of Au nanoparticles by photoelectrodeposition. The NiCoOx layer not only increases the transmission distance of holes generated by plasmonic Au nanoparticles, but also reduce the agglomeration of plasmonic Au nanoparticles during long&#8208;time OER reaction, which greatly improves the OER catalytic ability. The current density of NiCoOx/Au anode achieves 16.58&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 2.0&#8197;V versus RHE, which is about 6.5&#8197;times of pristine NiCoOx anode (2.56&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and 47&#8197;times of pristine Au anode (0.35&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2). More importantly, with the LSPR and photothermal effect of plasmonic Au nanoparticles, the NiCoOx/Au anode provides additional current density of 7.01&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 after illumination, and maintains no attenuation for more than 2000&#8197;s. Benefiting from the solution of agglomeration problem of plasmonic Au nanoparticles in the long&#8208;time OER process and the effective utilization of generated holes of plasmonic Au nanoparticles, this design can provide guidance for the application of plasmonic materials in the field of electrocatalysis.

The composites exhibit enhanced dye&#8208;uptakes up to 70&#8201;% and CO2 separation property, with an IAST sorption selectivity of 298 for the CO2/N2 (15/85, v/v) gas mixture at 298&#8197;K and 1&#8197;bar.







Abstract
In this study, composites of HKUST&#8208;1 MOF with nanocellulose, HKUST&#8208;1@NCs, have been prepared and explored for CO2/N2 gas&#8208;separation and dye&#8208;sorption based applications. Our biopolymer&#8208;MOF composites are prepared via a copper ion pre&#8208;seeding method, in which, the HKUST&#8208;1 crystallites are grown in&#8197;situ on the Cu&#8208;seeded and carboxylate anchored NC fibers for a better interfacial integration between the MOF and the polymer matrices. Static gas sorption studies show the capability of one of our HKUST&#8208;1@NC composites to reach &#8764;300&#8201;% enhancement in the CO2/N2 sorption selectivity compared to the corresponding MOF alone &#8208; blank reference sample prepared at similar conditions. The same composite, C100, in the bulk powder form, shows a remarkable IAST sorption selectivity of 298 (CO2/N2) at 298&#8197;K and 1&#8197;bar for the CO2/N2 (15/85, v/v) gas mixture. The relative position of the C100, in the bound plot visualizations of the CO2/N2 separation trade&#8208;off factors indicate a significant potential. The HKUST&#8208;1@NC composites have also been processed along with a polymeric cellulose acetate (CA) matrix as HKUST&#8208;1@NC@CA films to study them as free&#8208;standing mixed&#8208;matrix membranes. The CO2/N2 sorption selectivity, at 298&#8197;K and 1&#8197;bar is 600 for one such membrane, C&#8208;120@CA, as bulk sample studied by the static gas sorption. The composite, C120, exhibits a good uptake with an enhancement of 11&#8201;% for alizarin and 70&#8201;% for Congo red in comparison to the uptakes of the corresponding blank reference HKUST&#8208;1 sample, B120.

The molecular design in our manuscript is metaphorically represented by curling, a winter sport played on ice. The red stone of a N&#8722;N component is striking a yellow stone that was originally located between the exocyclic C=C double bond of a cross&#8208;conjugated dibenzofulvalene, and replacing it.

         <title>One&#8208;pot Synthesis of 2&#8208;Aminoindole through SET Oxidative Cyclization: Concise Synthesis of Tryptanthrin and Phaitanthrin E</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild and efficient domino process has been developed to provide ready access to a library of functionalized 2&#8208;aminoindoles in good yields, via SET oxidative cyclization, using readily available ethyl propiolate, tosyl azide, and substituted aryl amine as starting materials. The synthetic power of this one&#8208;pot method has been further exemplified in the concise synthesis of biologically important alkaloids, Phaitanthrin E and Tryptanthrin.







Abstract
An efficient domino approach for the synthesis of biologically important 2&#8208;aminoindole derivatives has been developed using CuBr2&#8208;mediated SET oxidative cyclization as a key step. This one&#8208;pot multicomponent strategy utilizes readily available ethyl propiolate, tosyl azide, and substituted aryl amines as starting materials. The generality and scope of this mild method are demonstrated with a wide variety of substrates to furnish functionalized 2&#8208;aminoindoles in good yields. The synthetic power of this strategy is further exemplified in the concise synthesis of biologically important alkaloids, Phaitanthrin E and Tryptanthrin.

         <title>Reactivity of [Cp&#8242;&#8242;2Zr(&#951;1:1&#8722;E4)] (E=P, As) towards Nucleophiles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reactivity of [Cp&#8242;&#8242;2Zr(&#951;1:1&#8722;E4)] (E=P, As) towards main group nucleophiles is investigated to functionalize the polypnictogen unit. With tBuLi as nucleophile, a single organic group is attached to a bridgehead phosphorus atom. The framework can be extended by further reactions with the quenching reagents [Me3O][BF4] and Ph2PCl. Furthermore, a condensation of two initially formed molecules occurs and a complex bearing a P8 unit is obtained. In contrast, reactions with the nucleophiles LiNMe2 and LiCH2SiMe3 lead to an abstraction of one pnictogen atom and the formation of a substituted cyclo&#8208;E3 unit on a neutral Cp&#8242;&#8242;2Zr complex.







Abstract
The functionalization of the polypnictogen ligand complexes [Cp&#8242;&#8242;2Zr(&#951;1:1&#8208;E4)] (E=P (1&#8201;a), As (1&#8201;b); Cp&#8242;&#8242;=1,3&#8208;di&#8208;tertbutyl&#8208;cyclopentadienyl) is focused to modify the features of the polypnictogen unit to explore new synthetic pathways for further transformations. The reaction behavior of 1 towards main group nucleophiles is investigated. The reaction of 1&#8201;a with tBuLi leads to the ionic product Li[Cp&#8242;&#8242;2Zr(&#951;1:1&#8208;P4tBu)] (2) where an organic group is attached to a bridgehead phosphorus atom of the butterfly unit. Further reactions of 2 with quenching electrophilic reagents enable the introduction of other substituents. Moreover, a condensation of 2 to [(Cp&#8242;&#8242;2Zr)2(&#956;,&#951;1:1:1:1&#8208;P8tBu2)] (3), containing a novel P8&#8208;unit, has been observed. The reaction of 1 with LiNMe2 and LiCH2SiMe3 leads to a partial fragmentation of the E4 unit and the compounds [Cp&#8242;&#8242;2Zr(&#951;2&#8208;E3Nu)] (Nu=NMe2: E=P (6&#8201;a), As (6&#8201;b); Nu=CH2SiMe3: E=P (7&#8201;a), As (7&#8201;b)) are formed.

         <title>Enantioselective Organocatalysis and Superacid Activation: Challenges and Opportunities</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
If chiral phosphoric acid catalysts are very efficient for the selective activation of basic substrates, such as imines or carbonyl compounds, the functionalization of non&#8208;polarized C=C bonds, such as olefins or arenes, remained a stimulating goal for many years. This Concept article presents different smart strategies that have appeared throughout the years for the efficient functionalization of these challenging substrates.







Abstract
Since the pioneer reports of the groups of Akiyama and Terada on Br&#248;nsted acid organocatalysis, this field never stopped growing with the development of ingenious strategies for the activation of challenging poorly reactive substrates. The development of superacidic organocatalysts is an important way to selectively functionalize reluctant electrophiles and other approaches have also emerged such as the combination of Lewis and Br&#248;nsted acids as well as the consecutive organocatalysis and superacid activation. This Concept aims to highlight these different strategies and demonstrate their complementarity.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;If chiral phosphoric acid catalysts&lt;/b&gt; are very efficient for the selective activation of basic substrates, such as imines or carbonyl compounds, the functionalization of non-polarized C=C bonds, such as olefins or arenes, remained a stimulating goal for many years. This Concept article presents different smart strategies that have appeared throughout the years for the efficient functionalization of these challenging substrates.

         <title>Reversible Photooxygenation of Anthracene Carboxyimide for Singlet Oxygen Formation: Mechanistic Study and Efficient Nitrite Detection</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reversible photooxygenation of an anthracene carboxyimide was achieved by hindering its ability to undergo a competing [4+4] photodimerization reaction and surprisingly yielded chiral hydroperoxides rather than the expected endoperoxide. The racemates were isolated via chiral chromatography, and the mechanism of their photo&#8208; and thermolysis to form 1O2 was investigated. The carboxyimide also proved to be an effective nitrite fluorescence sensor.







Abstract
Polycyclic aromatic endoperoxides are important sources of singlet oxygen (1O2) and their formation from polyacenes is well established. Anthracene carboxyimides are of particular interest as they exhibit excellent antitumor activity and possess unique photochemical properties. However, the photooxygenation of the synthetically versatile anthracene carboxyimide moiety has not been reported due to its competing [4+4] photodimerization reaction. Herein, we describe the reversible photo&#8208;oxidation of an anthracene carboxyimide. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis surprisingly revealed the formation of a racemic mixture of chiral hydroperoxides, rather than the expected endoperoxide. The photoproduct undergoes both photo&#8208; and thermolysis to form 1O2. Activation parameters were derived for the thermolysis and the mechanisms of photooxygenation and thermolysis are discussed. The anthracene carboxyimide also showed high selectivity and sensitivity for nitrite anions in acidic aqueous media and possessed stimuli&#8208;responsive behaviour.

         <title>Non&#8208;Symmetrical Tetrafluoroalkadienes Synthesized by ROCM of 3,3,4,4&#8208;Tetrafluorocyclobutene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ring&#8208;opening cross metathesis of 3,3,4,4&#8208;tetrafluorocyclobutene with electronically rich alkenes as butyl vinyl ether or electron donor group substituted styrenes gave a library of non&#8208;symmetrically substituted tetrafluorodienes, which could be further transformed by cross metathesis with styrenes to fluorinated internal dienes or by oxidation and cyclization to tetrafluorohexopyranoses.







Abstract
As the first known example of ring&#8208;opening cross metathesis (ROCM) of polyfluorinated strained cyclobutenes, ROCM of 3,3,4,4&#8208;tetrafluorocyclobutene with electronically rich alkenes, catalyzed by Grubbs or Hoveyda&#8208;Grubbs 2nd generation precatalysts, gave a small library of non&#8208;symmetrical isolated dienes bearing a tetrafluoroethylene spacer between the double bonds. 1&#8208;Butoxy&#8208;3,3,4,4&#8208;tetrafluorohexa&#8208;1,5&#8208;diene thus formed underwent subsequent regioselective cross metathesis (CM) with a series of styrenes, catalyzed by Hoveyda&#8208;Grubbs 2nd generation precatalyst, leading to non&#8208;symmetrically substituted dienes. 6,6&#8208;Dibutoxy&#8208;3,3,4,4&#8208;tetrafluorohex&#8208;1&#8208;ene, formed by regioselective butoxylation of 1&#8208;butoxy&#8208;3,3,4,4&#8208;tetrafluorohexa&#8208;1,5&#8208;diene, was dihydroxylated and cyclized to the corresponding 3,3,4,4&#8208;tetrafluorohexopyranose.

         <title>A Common C2&#8208;Symmetric 2,2&#8217;&#8208;Biphenol Building Block and its Application in the Synthesis of (+)&#8208;di&#8208;epi&#8208;Gonytolide A</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An axially chiral biphenol with a common biaryl polyketide motif was investigated. The versatile building block was made accessible by a streamlined synthesis featuring an efficient coupling procedure as well as a DFT&#8208;rationalized starting material bromination and thermodynamically controlled deracemization process. An application was demonstrated in a concise and highly&#8208;diastereoselective synthesis of (+)&#8208;di&#8208;epi&#8208;gonytolide A.







Abstract
A variety of biaryl polyketides exhibit remarkable bioactivities. However, their synthetic accessibility is often challenging. Herein, the enantioselective preparation and synthetic application of an axially chiral 2,2&#8217;&#8208;biphenol building block is outlined that represents a common motif of these intriguing natural products. Based on the highly regioselective and scalable bromination of a phenol precursor, a coupling process by Lipshutz cuprate oxidation was developed. A copper&#8208;mediated deracemization strategy proved to be superior to derivatization or kinetic resolution approaches. Key steps in the overall building block synthesis were rationalized through DFT studies. Utilizing the 2,2&#8217;&#8208;biphenol, a highly diastereoselective five step synthesis of formerly unknown (+)&#8208;di&#8208;epi&#8208;gonytolide A was developed, thus showcasing the building block's general potential for the synthesis of natural products and their derivatives. En route, the first enantioselective construction of a chromone dimer intermediate was established.

         <title>Elucidating Conformational Dynamics and Thermostability of Designed Aromatic Clusters by Using Protein Cages</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aromatic residues introduced onto ferritin monomers can form aromatic clusters by self&#8208;assembling of a 24&#8208;mer protein cage. The interhelical aromatic interaction networks transform the T&#8208;shaped configuration into the &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking at high temperatures, which contributes to stabilization of the quaternary structures and enhancement of the melting temperature of the scaffold protein.







Abstract
Multiple aromatic residues assemble to form higher ordered structures known as &#8220;aromatic clusters&#8221; in proteins and play essential roles in biological systems. However, the stabilization mechanism and dynamic behavior of aromatic clusters remain unclear. This study describes designed aromatic interactions confined within a protein cage to reveal how aromatic clusters affect protein stability. The crystal structures and calorimetric measurements indicate that the formation of inter&#8208;subunit phenylalanine clusters enhance the interhelix interactions and increase the melting temperature. Theoretical calculations suggest that this is caused by the transformation of the T&#8208;shaped geometry into &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking at high temperatures, and the hydration entropic gain. Thus, the isolated nanoenvironment in a protein cage allows reconstruction and detailed analysis of multiple clustering residues for elucidating the mechanisms of various biomolecular interactions in nature which can be applied to design of bionanomaterials.

         <title>Oxymethylene Ether (OME) Fuel Catalyst Screening Using In Situ NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An online NMR monitoring setup was implemented. The new setup was utilized for the monitoring and kinetic investigation of the OME fuel synthesis based on dimethoxymethane and trioxane. As catalysts a solid, Amberlyst15, and a liquid, trifluoromethanesulfonic acid, catalyst were used and compared based on activation energy and order in catalyst.







Abstract
Online NMR measurements are introduced in the current study as a new analytical setup for investigation of the oxymethylene dimethyl ether (OME) synthesis. For the validation of the setup, the newly established method is compared with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art gas chromatographic analysis.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Online NMR measurements are introduced in the current study as a new analytical setup for investigation of the oxymethylene dimethyl ether (OME) synthesis. For the validation of the setup, the newly established method is compared with state-of-the-art gas chromatographic analysis. Afterwards, the influence of different parameters, such as temperature, catalyst concentration and catalyst type on the OME fuel formation based on trioxane and dimethoxymethane is investigated. As catalysts, Amberlyst&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; 15 (A15) and trifluoromethanesulfonic acid (TfOH) are utilized. A kinetic model is applied to describe the reaction in more detail. Based on these results, the activation energy (A15: 48.0&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and TfOH: 72.3&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and the order in catalyst (A15: 1.1 and TfOH: 1.3) are calculated and discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Crystalline Order Propagates Across Thick Layers of Water in Solutions of Supramolecular Nanotubes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular nanotubes in aqueous solutions show longitudinal interlock between the tubes and 3D crystalline order at concentrations as low as 6&#8197;wt%, across 10&#8197;nm thick layers of water.







Abstract
3D crystalline order with 1&#8197;nm resolution is observed in aqueous solutions of supramolecular nanotubes containing 94&#8201;% water, at concentrations as low as 6&#8197;wt%. 50 of star&#8208;like organic ions arrange into supramolecular rings which, in turn, stack on top of each other to form long hollow tubes with 15&#8197;nm outer diameter. Cryo&#8208;TEM and X&#8208;ray diffraction show that the parallel nanotubes arrange on a perfect hexagonal lattice. Unexpectedly, fiber diffraction on sheared solutions revealed numerous hkl Bragg reflections on several layer lines indicating longitudinal interlock between the tubes and 3D crystalline order with molecular&#8208;scale details transferred across 10&#8197;nm thick layers of water. The observed high 3D order is attributed to long&#8208;range attraction between like&#8208;charged tubes and amplified charge modulation by the extremely high intra&#8208;tube correlation length.

         <title>BAr2&#8208;Bridged Azafulvene Dimers with Tunable Energy Levels for Photostable Near&#8208;Infrared Dyes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Donor&#8211;acceptor&#8211;donor molecules with strong near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorption and good photostability were synthesized by using BAr2&#8208;bridged azafulvene dimers as the electron acceptor. The azafulvene dimers form five&#8208;membered ring structures. The HOMO and LUMO energies could be tuned by substituting different aryl groups (Ar=C6H5, C6F5, 3,5&#8208;(CF3)2C6H3) to the boron center.







Abstract
Organic dyes with strong absorption in the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region are potentially useful in medical applications, such as tumor imaging and photothermal therapy. In this work, new NIR dyes combining BAr2&#8208;bridged azafulvene dimer acceptors with diarylaminothienyl donors in a donor&#8211;acceptor&#8211;donor configuration were synthesized. Surprisingly, it was found that in these molecules the BAr2&#8208;bridged azafulvene acceptor adopts a 5&#8208;membered, rather than 6&#8208;membered ring structure. The influence of the aryl substituents on the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the dye compounds was assessed from electrochemical and optical measurements. Strong electron&#8208;withdrawing fluorinated substituents (Ar=C6F5, 3,5&#8208;(CF3)2C6H3) lowered the HOMO energy while preserving the small HOMO&#8211;LUMO energy gap, resulting in promising NIR dye molecules that combine strong absorption bands centered around 900&#8197;nm with good photostability.

         <title>Converging Stereodivergent Reactions: Highly Stereoselective Formal anti&#8208;Markovnikov Addition of H2O to Mixtures of Olefins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A formal, two&#8208;step anti&#8208;Markovnikov addition of H2O to diastereomeric mixtures of trisubstituted olefins towards enantio&#8208; and diastereomerically highly&#8208;enriched alcohols is demonstrated. This method relies on the syn&#8208;specific Shi&#8208;epoxidation, followed by a titanocene&#8208;catalyzed epoxide hydrosilylation featuring a directional&#8208;isomerization step to converge the diastereomeric mixtures of epoxides into a single stereoisomer.







Abstract
We describe a highly diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective two&#8208;step formal anti&#8208;Markovnikov addition of H2O to diastereomeric mixtures of trisubstituted olefins. Our approach overcomes the limits of classical stereospecific addition reactions to olefins for the generation of adjacent stereocenters. In these stereospecific reactions, separation of olefin diastereomers is essential. Our method circumvents the need for such difficult separations by simultaneously employing both diastereomeric olefins in the organocatalytic, highly enantioselective, syn&#8208;specific Shi&#8208;epoxidation to yield diastereomeric oxiranes. The stereochemical model proposes the smallest substituent on the olefin to be stereodefining resulting in an identical enantiotopic approach for both olefin isomers on the less substituted carbon. By employing a stereoconverging epoxide hydrosilylation the identically configured center is retained, while the differing one is converted to a planar radical center that is reduced by a syn&#8208;selective intramolecular hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) from a Ti&#8722;H bond. The observed converging behavior can be attributed to a HAT&#8208;preceding directional isomerization step, that interconverts the obtained rotameric radicals which ultimately leads to high to excellent enantiomeric ratios of the final secondary alcohols.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review focuses on the research progress of antimony oxide&#8208;based anode materials for alkali metal&#8208;ion storage, including electrochemical reaction mechanism and improvements in lithium/sodium/potassium&#8208;ion storage performance, as well as an outlook on the application prospects.







Abstract
With the increasing demand for renewable energy, alkali metal&#8208;ion (lithium/sodium/potassium&#8208;ion) batteries play more and more important roles in the field of static storage and electrical vehicle industry. Novel anode materials with high reversible capacity, safety and long&#8208;term cycling stability are desiderated to meet the ever&#8208;growing demand for alkali metal&#8208;ion batteries with high electrochemical performance. Antimony oxides (SbxOy) show electrochemical reaction activity with all of lithium, sodium and potassium, and are expected to be promising anode materials for alkali metal&#8208;ion storage due to their high theoretical capacities, appropriate operating potential and excellent safety properties. This review is devoted to overview the research progress on reaction mechanism and improvements in electrochemical performance of antimony oxides for alkali metal&#8208;ion storage, and look forward to their further prospects.

         <title>X&#8208;ray Study of Cembranoids with Flexible Rings from Boswellia papyrifera Resins Allowing Structural Revision of Misleading Structures from the Past 70 Years</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

Over the past seven decades several cembranoids have been reported, but uncertainty still exists about their structures. In this study, we isolated 38 macrocyclic cembranoids from B.&#8197;papyrifera. Our 25 single&#8208;crystal analysis uncovered misleading factors in the previously determined stereochemistries, and this led to six structures being revised. In addition, we propose a biosynthetic pathway and briefly discuss SARs.







Abstract
Thirty new, highly oxygenated and stereogenic 14&#8208;membered macrocyclic diterpenoids, papyrifuranols A&#8208;Z (1&#8211;26) and AA&#8208;AD (27&#8211;30), and eight known analogs have been isolated from Boswellia papyrifera resins. All the structures were characterized by detailed spectral analyses, quantum calculations, X&#8208;ray diffraction, and modified Mosher's methods. Notably, six previously reported structures were revised. Our study points out misleading factors of macrocyclic cembranoid (CB) representation in the past seven decades by analyzing of 25 X&#8208;ray structures, lending a hand for the innately challenging structure identification of such flexible macrocyclic CBs and avoiding following the tracks of an overturned cart during future structure characterization and total synthesis. Biosynthetic conversions of all the isolates are proposed, and wound healing bioassays reveal that papyrifuranols N&#8722;P could significantly stimulate the proliferation and differentiation of umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells.

         <title>Au Nanozyme Driven Cascading Catalysis in Tollens&#8242; Reaction: An Insight of Glucose Oxidase&#8208;Like Mechanism</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
[Ag(NH3)2]+ can be directly used as an electron acceptor for the oxidation of glucose by AuNPs to accelerate Tollens&#8242; reaction, The formed Ag nanoparticles continued to act as a cascading catalyst to accelerate the reaction and indicator, which provides a possibility for the rapid colorimetric glucose detection.







Abstract
Au nanoparticles (NPs) have been proven to be excellent glucose oxidase (GOx) mimics, which can catalyze the electrons transform pathway from glucose to oxygen. This study confirmed AuNPs can accelerate the reaction between [Ag(NH3)2]+ and glucose under alkaline conditions, which is also known as the Tollens&#8242; reaction, and the possible mechanism was proposed. Here, [Ag(NH3)2]+ instead of O2 acted directedly as an electron acceptor during glucose oxidation catalyzed by AuNPs, accompanied by hydrogen transfer. The as&#8208;synthesized Ag nanoparticles can also catalyze this process, similar to AuNPs, via a unique cascading catalysis mechanism in the Tollens&#8242; reaction. A simple and heatless glucose colorimetric assay can be established based on the plasmonic band of AgNPs with a liner range of 0.6&#8211;22.2&#8197;&#956;M, and the limit of detection is 0.32&#8197;&#956;M.

         <title>Bonding in Low&#8208;Coordinated Organoarsenic and Organoantimony Compounds: A Threshold Photoelectron Spectroscopic Investigation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methyl and methylene compounds of arsenic and antimony have been studied by photoelectron photoion coincidence spectroscopy to investigate their relative stability with the help of pyrolysis. While organoarsenic compounds show a variety of methyl and methylene compounds, like HAsCH2, antimony only shows Sb&#8722;CH3. In the condensed phase, the precursors E(CH3)3 (E=As, Sb) are relatively poor sources of methyl radicals.







Abstract
Methyl and methylene compounds of arsenic and antimony have been studied by photoelectron photoion coincidence spectroscopy to investigate their relative stability. While for As both HAs=CH2, As&#8722;CH3 and the methylene compound As=CH2 are identified in the spectrum, the only Sb compound observed is Sb&#8722;CH3. Thus, there is a step in the main group&#8197;15 between As and Sb, regarding the relative stability of the methyl compounds. Ionisation energies, vibrational frequencies and spin&#8208;orbit splittings were determined for the methyl compound from photoion mass&#8208;selected photoelectron spectra. Although the spectroscopic results for organoantimony resemble those for the previously investigated bismuth compounds, EPR spectroscopic experiments indicate a far lower tendency for methyl transfer for Sb(CH3)3 compared to Bi(CH3)3. This study concludes investigations on low&#8208;valent organopnictogen compounds.

         <title>Tailoring Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding Strategy for Sequence&#8208;Dependent and Thermo/pH Dual&#8208;Responsive Clusteroluminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2,5&#8208;Dimethylfuran&#8208;protected tert&#8208;butyl acrylate was used to achieve sequence regulation of copolymer consisting of pH&#8208;responsive PAA chains and thermo&#8208;responsive PNIPAM chains by the latent monomer strategy and hydrolysis strategy. These non&#8208;conjugated DHCs without traditional chromophores display many typical features of cluster triggered emission (CTE) materials. Notably, the fluorescence intensity of double hydrophilic copolymers was related to the distribution of acrylic acid in polymer chain. In contrast to random and pseudo di&#8208;block DHCs, the gradient DHCs show stronger luminescent intensity. Precisely tuning pH values and temperatures, thermo and pH results in dual&#8208;responsive clusteroluminescence.







Abstract
Rational design of monomer sequence for desired properties is challenging. This study investigates the effect of monomer distribution of double hydrophilic copolymers (DHCs) with electron&#8208;rich units on cluster triggered emission (CTE) capacity. By means of combining latent monomer strategy, reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization and selective hydrolysis technology, the random, pseudo di&#8208;block and the gradient DHCs consisting of pH&#8208;responsive polyacrylic acid (PAA) segments and thermo&#8208;responsive poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) segments were successfully synthesized in a controlled manner. Moreover, the gradient DHCs showed a tremendously increased luminescent intensity due to the distinct hydrogen&#8208;bonding interaction compared to random and pseudo di&#8208;block DHCs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported the direct correlation between luminescent intensity and sequence structure of non&#8208;conjugated polymer. Meanwhile, thermo and pH dual&#8208;responsive clusteroluminescence could be easily performed. This work demonstrates a novel and facile method to tailor the hydrogen&#8208;bonding for the stimuli&#8208;responsive light&#8208;emitting polymers.

         <title>Photocatalytic Ketyl Radical Initiated Cketyl&#8722;Csp2/Csp3 Coupling on ZnIn2S4</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ketyl radical initiated intramolecular cyclization and intermolecular cross&#8208;coupling reactions can be achieved on a ZnIn2S4 photocatalyst. In this way industrially important chemicals like chromanes and tertiary alcohols can be produced.







Abstract
Visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven C&#8722;C bond formation utilizing ketyl radical (Cketyl) species has attracted increasing attention recently, as it provides a direct route for the synthesis of complex molecules. However, the most&#8208;developed homogeneous photocatalytic systems for the generation and utilization of ketyl radicals usually entail noble metal&#8208;based (e.&#8201;g., Ru and Ir) photosensitizers, which suffer from not only high cost but also potential degradation and hence pose challenges in product separation and purification. In contrast, readily accessible, inexpensive, and recyclable semiconductors represent a class of attractive and alternative photocatalysts but remain much less explored for photocatalytic ketyl radical initiated C&#8722;C bond formation. This work demonstrates that a wide range of industrially important chemicals, including substituted chromanes and tertiary alcohols, can be produced on ZnIn2S4 under visible light irradiation through intramolecular cyclization (Cketyl&#8722;Csp2) and intermolecular cross&#8208;coupling (Cketyl&#8722;Csp3) reactions, respectively, using ketyl radicals. A suite of experimental studies aided by computational investigation were carried out to shed light on the mechanistic insights of these two types of ketyl radical initiated C&#8722;C coupling reactions on ZnIn2S4.

         <title>Styrene Oxide Isomerase&#8208;Catalyzed Meinwald Rearrangement in Cascade Biotransformations: Synthesis of Chiral and/or Natural Chemicals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 25, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cascade biotransformations involving styrene oxide isomerase (SOI)&#8208;catalyzed Meinwald rearrangement via a stereospecific and trans&#8208;selective 1,2&#8208;H or 1,2&#8208;methyl shift were developed for versatile and high&#8208;yielding chemical synthesis, including enantioselective synthesis of valuable chiral molecules from easily available alkenes or racemic epoxides and sustainable synthesis of useful natural products from bio&#8208;based substrates or renewable feedstock.







Abstract
Styrene oxide isomerase (SOI) catalyzes the Meinwald rearrangement of aryl epoxides to carbonyl compounds via a 1,2&#8208;trans&#8208;shift in a stereospecific manner. A number of cascade biotransformations with SOI&#8208;catalyzed epoxide isomerization as a key step have been developed to convert readily available substrates into valuable chiral chemicals. Cascade conversion of terminal or internal alkenes into chiral acids, alcohols or amines was achieved, which involved SOI&#8208;catalyzed enantio&#8208;retentive isomerization of terminal epoxides via 1,2&#8208;H shift, or internal epoxides via 1,2&#8208;methyl shift. SOI&#8208;involved cascades were also developed to convert racemic epoxides into chiral acids or amines via dynamic kinetic resolution. Additionally, combining SOI&#8208;catalyzed isomerization with enantioselective C&#8722;C bond forming enzymes enabled the synthesis of chiral amino acids or amino alcohols from racemic epoxides. Finally, integration of SOI&#8208;involved cascades with biosynthesis pathways allowed for the direct utilization of renewable substrates for the sustainable synthesis of high&#8208;value natural chemicals such as alcohols, acids, and esters.

         <title>Enhancing the Activity of an Alcohol Dehydrogenase by Using &#8220;Aromatic Residue Scanning&#8221; at Potential Plasticity Sites</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 25, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy, named &#8220;aromatic residue scanning&#8221;, was developed for enzyme engineering, and an alcohol dehydrogenase was engineered to exhibit higher activity and substrate tolerance based on the implementation of the strategy to randomly mutate five identified potential plasticity sites. By using the best variant, an efficient bioprocess for the synthesis of (S)&#8208;2&#8208;chloro&#8208;1&#8208;(3,4&#8208;difluorophenyl)ethanol was established.







Abstract
An alcohol dehydrogenase LkADH was successfully engineered to exhibit improved activity and substrate tolerance for the production of (S)&#8208;2&#8208;chloro&#8208;1&#8208;(3,4&#8208;difluorophenyl)ethanol, an important precursor of ticagrelor. Five potential hotspots were identified for enzyme mutagenesis by using natural residue abundance as an indicator to evaluate their potential plasticity. A semi&#8208;rational strategy named &#8220;aromatic residue scanning&#8221; was applied to randomly mutate these five sites simultaneously by using tyrosine, tryptophan, and phenylalanine as &#8220;exploratory residues&#8221; to introduce steric hindrance or potential &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions. The best variant Lk&#8208;S96Y/L199W identified with 17.2&#8208;fold improvement in catalytic efficiency could completely reduce up to 600&#8197;g/L (3.1&#8197;M) 2&#8208;chloro&#8208;1&#8208;(3,4&#8208;difluorophenyl)ethenone in 12&#8197;h with &gt;99.5&#8201;%&#8201;ee, giving the highest space&#8208;time yield ever reported. This study, therefore, offers a strategy for mutating alcohol dehydrogenase to reduce aromatic substrates and provides an efficient variant for the efficient synthesis of (S)&#8208;2&#8208;chloro&#8208;1&#8208;(3,4&#8208;difluorophenyl)ethanol.

Synthesis of 2&#8208;(4,5&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;1H&#8208;imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl) phenol using 10&#8208;CSA catalyst.

Abstract
We report the synthesis of 2&#8208;(4,5&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;1H&#8208;imidazole&#8208;2&#8208;yl)phenol (TPI&#8208;9) as an interesting fluorescent molecule displaying Excited&#8208;State Intramolecular&#8208;Proton&#8208;Transfer (ESIPT) with stokes shift of 120&#8197;nm. Phenolic compounds with the ability to form intramolecular hydrogen bonds and subsequent proton transfer are known as ESIPT fluorophores. Proton accepting ability can increase significantly by tailoring electron&#8208;donating groups. With the assistance of an environment&#8208;friendly organocatalyst, 10&#8208;camphor sulfonic acid (10&#8208;CSA), TPI&#8208;9 was synthesized to introduce substituents with electron&#8208;donating abilities to develop an efficient ESIPT mechanism. Factors influencing the emission, such as solvent, pH, and metal ions, are investigated. Quenching of fluorescence by Cu2+ through chelation enhancement quenching effect with a high selectivity allowed the establishment of a Cu2+ sensor with an LoD of 0.57&#8197;ppm and a ratiometric estimation with an LoD of 0.73&#8197;ppm. Metal binding (2&#8201;:&#8201;1) stoichiometry and quenching constant (0.0072&#8197;mol&#8722;1s&#8722;1) are calculated from Job's and Stern&#8208;Volmer plots. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations are in accordance with the experimental results. Competitive replacement of TPI&#8208;9 by amino acids restores ESIPT, consequently, the fluorescence. Thus, an &#8220;off&#8208;on&#8221; fluorescence sensor for amino acid estimation is developed under 1 minute incubation. A linear relationship between amino acid concentration and fluorescence intensity is in 0&#8208;20&#8197;&#956;g/mL range, and the LoD is less than 2.2&#8197;&#956;g/mL.

Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;modified carbon&#8208;silicon solid acid catalysts with excellent acidity, facile recovery, and good stability were synthesized and exploited for practical production of benzaldehyde glycol acetal.







Abstract
A series of transition metal (M)&#8208;promoted carbon&#8208;silicon (C&#8722;M&#8722;Si; M=Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Zr) solid acid catalysts with designated molar ratio of M/Si=1&#8201;:&#8201;8 were fabricated and exploited for acetalization of benzaldehyde (BzH) with ethylene glycol (EG). The physical and chemical properties of these C&#8722;M&#8722;Si catalysts prepared by sol&#8208;gel method were characterized by various techniques, namely, SEM, EDS, TGA&#8208;DTG, BET, XRD, FTIR, XPS, and NH3&#8208;TPD. Among various examined acidic C&#8722;M&#8722;Si catalysts, the C&#8722;Fe&#8722;Si catalyst exhibited the optimal catalytic activity with the benzaldehyde glycol acetal (BEGA) yield of 97.67&#8201;%, in excellent agreement with the value (97.88&#8201;%) predicted by the response surface methodology (RSM) based on a Box&#8208;Behnken design (BBD). C&#8722;Fe&#8722;Si catalyst with the high catalytic activities and excellent stability and reusability may be ascribed to the suitable acidity and uniform surface distribution of active sites requisite for the acid&#8208;catalyzed acetalization reaction.

         <title>Coumarin C&#8722;H Functionalization by Mn(I) Carbonyls: Mechanistic Insight by Ultra&#8208;Fast IR Spectroscopic Analysis</title>

Towards &#960;&#8208;extended hybrid coumarin&#8208;pyridinium compounds: We have developed a remarkable methodology for the synthesis of hybrid coumarin&#8208;pyridinium compounds using Mn(I) carbonyl chemistry. The system was found suitable for forensic examination of the key steps underpinning CO loss, alkyne coordination and insertion, and subsequent reductive elimination, which were quantifiable by time&#8208;resolved spectroscopic methods.







Abstract
Mn(I) C&#8722;H functionalization of coumarins provides a versatile and practical method for the rapid assembly of fused polycyclic pyridinium&#8208;containing coumarins in a regioselective manner. The synthetic strategy enables application of bench&#8208;stable organomanganese reagents in both photochemical&#8208; and thermal&#8208;promoted reactions. The cyclomanganated intermediates, and global reaction system, provide an ideal testing ground for structural characterization of the active Mn(I) carbonyl&#8208;containing species, including transient species observable by ultra&#8208;fast time&#8208;resolved spectroscopic methods. The thermodynamic reductive elimination product, solely encountered from reaction between alkynes and air&#8208;stable organometallic cyclomanganated coumarins, has enabled characterization of a critical seven&#8208;membered Mn(I) intermediate, detected by time&#8208;resolved infrared spectroscopy, enabling the elucidation of the temporal profile of key steps in the reductive elimination pathway. Quantitative data are provided. Manganated polycyclic products are readily decomplexed by AgBF4, opening&#8208;up an efficient route to the formation of &#960;&#8208;extended hybrid coumarin&#8208;pyridinium compounds.

         <title>Deciphering Electronic and Structural Effects in Copper Corrole/Graphene Hybrids

A computational study of copper corroles adsorbed onto graphene by DFT methods explored the stability, electronic structure, and magnetic properties of these complexes highlighting the augmented magnetic response accompanied with spin transfer toward graphene after adsorption.







Abstract
Non&#8208;covalent hybrid materials based on graphene and A3&#8208;type copper corrole complexes were computationally investigated. The corroles complexes contain strong electron&#8208;withdrawing fluorinated substituents at the meso positions. Our results show that the non&#8208;innocent character of corrole moiety modulates the structural, electronic, and magnetic properties once the hybrid systems are held. The graphene&#8208;corrole hybrids displayed outstanding stability via the interplay of dispersion and electrostatic driving forces, while graphene act as an electron reservoir. The hybrid structures exposed an intriguing magneto&#8208;chemical performance, compared to the isolated counterparts, that evidenced how structural and electronic effects contributed to the magnetic response for both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic cases. Directional spin polarization and spin transfer from the corrole to the graphene surface participate in the amplification. Finally, there are relations between the spin transfer, the magnetic response, and the copper distorted ligand field, offering exciting hints about modulating the magnetic response. Therefore, this work shows that copper corroles emerged as versatile building blocks for graphene hybrid materials, especially in applications requiring a magnetic response.

         <title>Neutral, Heteroleptic [Cu(I)(PPh3)2(4H&#8208;imidazolato)] Complexes: Ligand Exchange Reactivity, Redox Properties, Excited&#8208;State Dynamics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 25, May 2, 2023. </description>

Hop on hop off: Typically, heteroleptic Cu(I)DiiminePPh3 complexes tend to form the homoleptic counterpart. But this is not observed when the diimine is an anionic 4H&#8208;imidazolate. Despite dynamic PPh3 ligand exchange in solution the deeply colored, photoredox&#8208;active Cu(I)4H&#8208;imidazolatoPPh3 complexes are stable.







Abstract
Cu(I) 4H&#8208;imidazolate complexes are rare examples of Cu(I) complexes with chelating anionic ligands and are potent photosensitizers with unique absorption and photoredox properties. In this contribution, five novel heteroleptic Cu(I) complexes with monodentate triphenylphosphine co&#8208;ligands are investigated. As a consequence of the anionic 4H&#8208;imidazolate ligand and in contrast to comparable complexes with neutral ligands, these complexes are more stable than their homoleptic bis(4H&#8208;imidazolato)Cu(I) congeners. Here, the ligand exchange reactivity was studied by 31P&#8208;,19F&#8208;, and variable temperature NMR and the ground state structural and electronic properties by X&#8208;ray diffraction, absorption spectroscopy, and cyclic voltammetry. The excited&#8208;state dynamics were investigated by femto&#8208; and nanosecond transient absorption spectroscopy. The observed differences, with respect to chelating bisphosphine bearing congeners, are often due to the increased geometric flexibility of the triphenylphosphines. These observations render the investigated complexes interesting candidates for photo(redox)reactions not accessible with chelating bisphosphine ligands.

         <title>Redox Assisted Reversible Aromaticity Transition Between 30&#960; H&#252;ckel and 28&#960; M&#246;bius Dication of a Core&#8208;Modified Isophlorinoid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 25, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unwavering Aromaticity: Aromatic and redox property of an expanded isophlorinoid has been significantly modified by varying the heteroatoms in the core of a 30&#960; macrocycle. A reversible transition between H&#252;ckel and M&#246;bius topology without loss aromaticity has been accomplished by two&#8208;electron ring oxidation of a H&#252;ckel 30&#960; core&#8208;modified isophlorinoid. The stable 28&#960; dication represents a novel example of a charged M&#246;bius aromatic annulene.







Abstract
The electronic properties of a hexaphyrin was fine&#8208;tuned via core&#8208;modification leading to the formation of a H&#252;ckel aromatic 30&#960; hexaphyrin which incorporates two pyrrole and four furan rings in the &#960;&#8208;conjugated pathway. This H&#252;ckel aromatic hexaphyrin modified its conformation upon two&#8208;electron ring oxidation either with triflic acid or Meerwein salt [Et3O]+[SbCl6]&#8722; to yield 28&#960; M&#246;bius aromatic dication species. Reversible aromatic transition was established by spectroscopic techniques and further supported by quantum chemical calculations.

The compound with &#8220;ring&#8208;chain&#8208;ring&#8221; framework with detail beneficial modify scheme is summarized, which may improve the residence time of inhibitor in AChE. Based on dictamnine, three novel eligible derivatives are developed, which verifies the prediction. The present work provides a train of thought from static and dynamic view to modify or design appropriate inhibitor on the basis of specific binding and transportation features.







Abstract
Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is a key target for the current symptomatic treatment of Alzheimer's disease, and galantamine is a clinical anticholinesterase drug with transiently acting characteristic and good selectivity for AChE. The present theoretical&#8208;experimental work improves the drug&#8216;s residence time without reducing the inhibition effect, thus providing a crucial breakthrough for modifying the inhibitor of AChE with better kinetic behavior. The static binding and dynamic delivery properties acquired from atomic view reveal that the galantamine simply occupies a catalytic anionic site, and its release from AChE needs only &#8764;8.6&#8197;kcal/mol. Both of these may cause the short residence time of galantamine. The hotspots and most favorable transport mechanism are identified, and the hydrogen bond and aromatic stacking interactions are observed to play crucial roles for galantamine binding and release in AChE. The typical peripheral anionic site arisen at the delivery process would provide another key occupation to enhance the anti&#8208;release ability for inhibitors. The compound with &#8220;specific&#8208;ring&#8208;chain&#8208;ring&#8221; framework with detailed beneficial modification scheme is summarized, which may improve the residence time of the inhibitor in AChE. The thermodynamic and dynamic properties of galantamine derivatives are also studied. Based on dictamnine, a natural alkaloid, two novel eligible derivatives are designed, synthesized and evaluated, which verifies our prediction. Multiple computational approaches and experimental combinations probably provide a train of thought from both static and dynamic views to modify or design appropriate inhibitors on the basis of specific binding and transportation features.

         <title>Site&#8208;Specific Labeling of RNAs with Modified and 19F&#8208;Labeled Nucleotides by Chemo&#8208;Enzymatic Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 25, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A library of post&#8208;transcriptional modifications and synthetic modified nucleosides for the site&#8208;specific alteration of RNAs applying a chemo&#8208;enzymatic method is presented. This method overcomes the limitations of other established and well&#8208;known RNA synthesis techniques. The applicability of this approach to biological systems is demonstrated with the site&#8208;specific modification of a riboswitch with a fluorinated nucleoside for NMR based analyses.







Abstract
More than 170 post&#8208;transcriptional modifications of RNAs have currently been identified. Detailed biophysical investigations of these modifications have been limited since large RNAs containing these post&#8208;transcriptional modifications are difficult to produce. Further, adequate readout of spectroscopic fingerprints are important, necessitating additional labeling procedures beyond the naturally occurring RNA modifications. Here, we report the chemo&#8208;enzymatic synthesis of RNA modifications and several structurally similar fluorine&#8208;modified analogs further optimizing a recently developed methodology.[1] This chemo&#8208;enzymatic method allows synthesis of also large RNAs. We were able to incorporate 16 modified nucleotides and 6 19F&#8208;labeled nucleotides. To showcase the applicability of such modified large RNAs, we incorporated a 19F&#8208;labeled cytidine into the aptamer domain of the 2&#8217;dG sensing riboswitch (2&#8217;dG&#8208;sw) from Mesoplasma florum, enabling characterizing RNA fold, ligand binding and kinetics. Thanks to the large chemical shift dispersion of 19F, we can detect conformational heterogeneity in the apo state of the riboswitch.

         <title>A Bioactive Synthetic Outer&#8208;Core Oligosaccharide Derived from a Klebsiella pneumonia Lipopolysaccharide for Bacteria Recognition</title>

A chemical synthesised outer core tetra&#8208; and pentasaccharide derived from the lipopolysaccharide of K. pneumoniae conjugated to the carrier proteins CRM197 and BSA elicited in mice antibodies that recognized isolated LPS as well as various strains of K. pneumoniae demonstrating they can induce relevant antigenic responses.







Abstract
There is an urgent need for new treatment options for carbapenem&#8208;resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae), which is a common cause of life&#8208;threatening hospital&#8208; and community&#8208;acquired infections. Prophylactic or therapeutic vaccination may offer an approach to control these infections, however, none has yet been approved for human use. Here, we report the chemical synthesis of an outer core tetra&#8208; and pentasaccharide derived from the lipopolysaccharide of K. pneumoniae. The oligosaccharides were equipped with an aminopentyl linker, which facilitated conjugation to the carrier proteins CRM197 and BSA. Mice immunized with the glycoconjugate vaccine candidates elicited antibodies that recognized isolated LPS as well as various strains of K. pneumoniae. The successful preparation of the oligosaccharides relied on the selection of monosaccharide building blocks equipped with orthogonal hydroxyl and amino protecting groups. It allowed the differentiation of three types of amines of the target compounds and the installation of a crowded 4,5&#8208;branched Kdo moiety.

         <title>Controlling the Flexibility of Carbazole&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks by Substituent Effects</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 25, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Topological structures and properties of Cu&#8208;/Co&#8208;based MOFs with novel carbazole ligands are reported. The MOFs show high chemical stability, H2&#8208;adsorption performance, and CO2/N2 selectivity. The introduction of a strongly electron&#8208;donating substituent increases the structural robustness of the corresponding Cu&#8208;based MOFs. Thus, the flexibility of such MOFs can be controlled by the functional groups introduced at the periphery of the ligand backbone, which will serve as a new guideline for the design of advanced MOFs.







Abstract
We have developed highly porous Cu&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) using carbazole&#8208;type linkers. The novel topological structure of these MOFs was revealed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. Molecular adsorption/desorption experiments indicated that these MOFs are flexible and change their structure upon adsorption/desorption of organic solvents and gas molecules. These MOFs exhibit unprecedented properties that allow controlling their flexibility by adding a functional group onto the central benzene ring of the organic ligand. For example, the introduction of electron&#8208;donating substituents increases the robustness of the resulting MOFs. These MOFs also exhibit flexibility&#8208;dependent differences in gas&#8208;adsorption and &#8208;separation performance. Thus, this study represents the first example of controlling the flexibility of MOFs with the same topological structure via the substituent effect of functional groups introduced into the organic ligand.

         <title>Direct Construction of Corrole&#8208;Peptide Conjugates by Controllable Bilane Formation on Resin</title>

Solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis: An efficient and practical protocol is reported to functionalize peptides by corrole motifs without using prepared corrole building blocks. The synthesized corrole&#8208;peptide conjugates displayed their multifunctionality for metal chelating, aggregation, as well as targeted imaging.







Abstract
Corroles have attracted increasing research interests in recent decades owing to their unique properties over porphyrins. However, the relatively inefficient and tedious synthetic procedures of corrole building blocks with functional groups for bioconjugation hindered their bioapplications. Herein, we report a highly efficient protocol to synthesize corrole&#8208;peptide conjugates with good yields (up to 63&#8201;%) without using prepared corrole building blocks. By condensing two &#8722;COOH&#8208;bearing&#8208;dipyrromethane molecules onto an aldehyde group on resin&#8208;bound peptide chains in a controllable manner, a series of desired products with long (up to 25&#8197;residues) and bioactive peptide chains were obtained with at most one chromatographic purification. The synthesized compounds exhibited potential applications as chelators for metal ions for biomedical applications, as building blocks for supramolecular materials, as well as targeted fluorescent probes.

The synthesized compounds exhibited potential applications as chelators for metal ions for biomedical applications, as building blocks for supramolecular materials, as well as targeted fluorescent probes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

The molecular solar thermal (MOST) energy storage system 2&#8208;carbethoxy&#8208;3&#8208;phenyl&#8208;norbornadiene/quadricyclane was investigated on Pt(111) and Ni(111) by synchrotron radiation&#8208;based XPS measurements. The in&#8208;situ observation of the adsorption at &#8764;120&#8197;K allowed the distinction of both valence isomers. Temperature&#8208;programmed experiments gave insights into thermally induced reactions and stability boundaries.







Abstract
Novel energy&#8208;storage solutions are necessary for the transition from fossil to renewable energy sources. Auspicious candidates are so&#8208;called molecular solar thermal (MOST) systems. In our study, we investigate the surface chemistry of a derivatized norbornadiene/quadricyclane molecule pair. By using suitable push&#8211;pull substituents, a bathochromic shift of the absorption onset is achieved, allowing a greater overlap with the solar spectrum. Specifically, the adsorption and thermally induced reactions of 2&#8208;carbethoxy&#8208;3&#8208;phenyl&#8208;norbornadiene/quadricyclane are assessed on Pt(111) and Ni(111) as model catalyst surfaces by synchrotron radiation&#8208;based X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Comparison of the respective XP spectra enables the distinction of the energy&#8208;rich molecule from its energy&#8208;lean counterpart and allows qualitative information on the adsorption motifs to be derived. Monitoring the quantitative cycloreversion between 140 and 230&#8197;K spectroscopically demonstrates the release of the stored energy to be successfully triggered on Pt(111). Heating to above 300&#8197;K leads to fragmentation of the molecular framework. On Ni(111), no conversion of the energy&#8208;rich compound takes place. The individual decomposition pathways of the two isomers begin at 160 and 180&#8197;K, respectively. Pronounced desorption of almost the entire surface coverage only occurs for the energy&#8208;lean molecule on Ni(111) above 280&#8197;K; this suggests weakly bound species. The correlation between adsorption motif and desorption behavior is important for applications of MOST systems in heterogeneously catalyzed processes.

         <title>Construction of Y&#8208;Doped BiVO4 Photocatalysts for Efficient Two&#8208;Electron O2 Reduction to H2O2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 25, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Y doping induces the formation of monoclinic/tetragonal BiVO4 heterojunction and improves the O2 adsorption, which facilitates the two&#8208;electron reduction of O2. Compared with original BiVO4, the photocatalytic H2O2 production activity of Y&#8208;doped BiVO4 is significantly increased.







Abstract
Photocatalytic hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production on BiVO4 photocatalysts using water and oxygen as raw materials is a green and sustainable process. However, the photocatalytic efficiency of pristine BiVO4 is limited by severe charge recombination. In this work, rare earth element Yttrium (Y) doped BiVO4 photocatalysts were fabricated by the hydrothermal method. In the photocatalytic H2O2 production experiment, the optimized Y&#8208;doped BiVO4 photocatalyst produced 114&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 of H2O2 under simulated sunlight (AM1.5) irradiation, which is four times higher than production activity of pure BiVO4 (26&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1). Density functional theory (DFT) calculation revealed that Y doping can enhance oxygen adsorption on the BiVO4 photocatalyst surface. Mechanistic investigations suggest that the doping process induces the in situ formation of monoclinic/tetragonal BiVO4 heterojunction, which further promotes the photogenerated carriers separation efficiency.

Chemoenzymatic total synthesis of GM1 gangliosides: Combined process engineering and biocatalyst improvement strategies are developed for chemoenzymatic total synthesis of GM1 gangliosides from (S)&#8208;Garner's aldehyde. Two key glycosyltransferases are improved on their soluble expression in E. coli and enzyme stability. The multistep one&#8208;pot multienzyme (MSOPME) process with the addition of a detergent in the latter glycosylation steps have been found to be highly efficient for obtaining GM1 gangliosides containing different sialic acid forms.







Abstract
Large&#8208;scale synthesis of GM1, an important ganglioside in mammalian cells especially those in the nervous system, is needed to explore its therapeutic potential. Biocatalytic production is a promising platform for such a purpose. We report herein the development of process engineering and glycosyltransferase improvement strategies to advance chemoenzymatic total synthesis of GM1. Firstly, a new short route was developed for chemical synthesis of lactosylsphingosine from the commercially available Garner's aldehyde. Secondly, two glycosyltransferases including Campylobacter jejuni &#946;1&#8211;4GalNAcT (CjCgtA) and &#946;1&#8211;3&#8208;galactosyltransferase (CjCgtB) were improved on their soluble expression in E. coli and enzyme stability by fusing with an N&#8208;terminal maltose binding protein (MBP). Thirdly, the process for enzymatic synthesis of GM1 sphingosines from lactosylsphingosine was engineered by developing a multistep one&#8208;pot multienzyme (MSOPME) strategy without isolating intermediate glycosphingosines and by adding a detergent, sodium cholate, to the later enzymatic glycosylation steps. Installation of a desired fatty acyl chain to GM1 glycosphingosines led to the formation of target GM1 gangliosides. The combination of glycosyltransferase improvement with chemical and enzymatic process engineering represents a significant advance in obtaining GM1 gangliosides containing different sialic acid forms by total chemoenzymatic synthesis in a short route and with high efficiency.

         <title>Synthesis and Densification of Mo/Mg Co&#8208;Doped Apatite&#8208;type Lanthanum Silicate Electrolytes with Enhanced Ionic Conductivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 25, May 2, 2023. </description>

Introducing the Mo6+ and Mg2+ dopants into the lanthanum silicate structure can increase the amount of interstitial oxygen and improve the degree of densification at lower sintering temperatures and expand the migration channel of oxygen ions to improve the ionic conductivity.







Abstract
Apatite&#8208;type lanthanum silicate (LSO) electrolyte is one of the most promising candidates for developing intermediate&#8208;temperature solid oxide electrolysis cells and solid oxide full cells (IT&#8208;SOECs and SOFCs) due to its stability and low activation energy. However, the LSO electrolyte still suffers from unsatisfied ionic conductivity and low relative density. Herein, a new co&#8208;doped method is reported to prepare highly purified polycrystalline powders of Mg&#8722;Mo co&#8208;doped LSO (Mg/Mo&#8208;LSO) electrolytes with high excellent densification properties and improved ionic conductivity. Introducing the Mo6+ and Mg2+ ions into the LSO structure can increase the number of interstitial oxide ions and improve the degree of densification at lower sintering temperatures, more importantly, expand the migration channel of oxide ions to enhance the ionic conductivity. As a result, the relative density of the fabricated Mo/Mg&#8208;LSO electrolytes pellets could achieve more than 98&#8201;% of the theoretical density after sintering at 1500&#8201;&#176;C for 4&#8197;h with a grain size of about 1&#8211;3&#8197;&#956;m and the EIS results showed the ionic conductivity increased from 0.782&#8197;mS&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;1 for the pristine LSO to 33.94&#8197;mS&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&#8722;1 for the doped sample La9.5Si5.45Mg0.3Mo0.25O26+&#948; at 800&#8201;&#176;C. In addition, the effect of different Mo6+ doping contents was investigated systematically, in which La9.5Si5.45Mg0.3Mo0.25O26+&#948; possessed the highest ionic conductivity and relative density.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Introducing the Mo&lt;sup&gt;6+&lt;/sup&gt; and Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; dopants&lt;/b&gt; into the lanthanum silicate structure can increase the amount of interstitial oxygen and improve the degree of densification at lower sintering temperatures and expand the migration channel of oxygen ions to improve the ionic conductivity.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apatite-type lanthanum silicate (LSO) electrolyte is one of the most promising candidates for developing intermediate-temperature solid oxide electrolysis cells and solid oxide full cells (IT-SOECs and SOFCs) due to its stability and low activation energy. However, the LSO electrolyte still suffers from unsatisfied ionic conductivity and low relative density. Herein, a new co-doped method is reported to prepare highly purified polycrystalline powders of Mg&#8722;Mo co-doped LSO (Mg/Mo-LSO) electrolytes with high excellent densification properties and improved ionic conductivity. Introducing the Mo&lt;sup&gt;6+&lt;/sup&gt; and Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions into the LSO structure can increase the number of interstitial oxide ions and improve the degree of densification at lower sintering temperatures, more importantly, expand the migration channel of oxide ions to enhance the ionic conductivity. As a result, the relative density of the fabricated Mo/Mg-LSO electrolytes pellets could achieve more than 98&#8201;% of the theoretical density after sintering at 1500&#8201;&#176;C for 4&#8197;h with a grain size of about 1&#8211;3&#8197;&#956;m and the EIS results showed the ionic conductivity increased from 0.782&#8197;mS&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; for the pristine LSO to 33.94&#8197;mS&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; for the doped sample La&lt;sub&gt;9.5&lt;/sub&gt;Si&lt;sub&gt;5.45&lt;/sub&gt;Mg&lt;sub&gt;0.3&lt;/sub&gt;Mo&lt;sub&gt;0.25&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;26+&#948;&lt;/sub&gt; at 800&#8201;&#176;C. In addition, the effect of different Mo&lt;sup&gt;6+&lt;/sup&gt; doping contents was investigated systematically, in which La&lt;sub&gt;9.5&lt;/sub&gt;Si&lt;sub&gt;5.45&lt;/sub&gt;Mg&lt;sub&gt;0.3&lt;/sub&gt;Mo&lt;sub&gt;0.25&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;26+&#948;&lt;/sub&gt; possessed the highest ionic conductivity and relative density. The proposed Mo/Mg co-doped method in this work is one step forward in developing apatite-structured electrolytes offering excellent potential to address the common issues associated with the fabrication of dense, highly conductive, and thermochemically stable electrolytes for solid oxide electrolysers and fuel cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>White Light&#8208;Emitting Electrochemical Cells Employing Phosphor&#8208;Sensitized Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence to Approach All&#8208;Phosphorescent Device Efficiencies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 25, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
White light&#8208;emitting electrochemical cells (LECs) based on phosphor&#8208;sensitized thermally activated delayed fluorescence show a high external quantum efficiency of 9.6&#8201;%, which is comparable with that obtained from all&#8208;phosphorescent white LECs.







Abstract
Solid&#8208;state light&#8208;emitting electrochemical cells (LECs) show promising advantages of simple device architecture, low operation voltage, and insensitivity to the electrode work functions such that they have high potential in low&#8208;cost display and lighting applications. In this work, novel white LECs based on phosphor&#8208;sensitized thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) are proposed. The emissive layer of these white LECs is composed of a blue&#8208;green phosphorescent host doped with a deep&#8208;red TADF guest. Efficient singlet&#8208;to&#8208;triplet intersystem crossing (ISC) on the phosphorescent host and the subsequent F&#246;rster energy transfer from the host triplet excitons to guest singlet excitons can make use of both singlet and triplet excitons on the host. With the good spectral overlap between the host emission and the guest absorption, 0.075&#8197;wt.% guest doping is sufficient to cause substantial energy transfer efficiency (ca. 40&#8201;%). In addition, such a low guest concentration also reduces the self&#8208;quenching effect and a high photoluminescence quantum yield of up to 84&#8201;% ensures high device efficiency. The phosphor&#8208;sensitized TADF white LECs indeed show a high external quantum efficiency of 9.6&#8201;%, which is comparable with all&#8208;phosphorescent white LECs. By employing diffusive substrates to extract the light trapped in the substrate, the device efficiency can be further improved by ca. 50&#8201;%. In the meantime, the intrinsic EL spectrum and device lifetime of the white LECs recover since the microcavity effect is destroyed. This work successfully demonstrates that the phosphor&#8208;sensitized TADF white LECs are potential candidates for efficient white light&#8208;emitting devices.

         <title>The Role of the Transient Atropisomerism and Chirality of Flurbiprofen Unveiled by Laser&#8208;Ablation Rotational Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 25, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The two most stable conformers of flurbiprofen (FB) have been isolated. They only differ in the dihedral angle that defines the arrangement of the phenyl group revealing FB atropisomerism. Analysing the recognition of FB by COX isoforms, it comes out that only one of these atropisomers is specifically selected for each R&#8208; or S&#8208; enantiomer.







Abstract
The combination of atropisomerism and chirality in flurbiprofen is shown to be relevant concerning its pharmacological activity. The two most stable conformers of a total of eight theoretically predicted for each R&#8208; or S&#8208; flurbiprofen enantiomers have been isolated in the cooling conditions of a supersonic jet and structurally characterized by laser ablation Fourier transform microwave spectroscopy. The detected conformers, whose structure is mainly defined by three dihedral angles, only differ in the sign of the phenyl torsion angle giving rise to Sa and Ra atropisomers. A comparison with the structures available for the R&#8208; and S&#8208; enantiomers complexed to COX isoforms reveals that the enzymes select only the Sa atropisomers, resulting in a diastereoisomer&#8208;specific recognition. The most stable gas phase conformer is exclusively selected when using the S&#8208; enantiomer while the second is recognized only for the R&#8208; enantiomer. These experimental results highlight the importance of atropisomerism in drug design.

         <title>Wide&#8208;Temperature Flexible Supercapacitor from an Organohydrogel Electrolyte and Its Combined Electrode</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 25, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multipurpose gels: A flexible supercapacitor that integrates a wide application temperature range (&#8722;20&#8211;80&#8201;&#176;C), satisfactory electrochemical performance and mechanical properties has been fabricated by using ionic conductive, anti&#8208;freezing and anti&#8208;drying organohydrogels both as electrolyte and binder of the combined electrode.







Abstract
Hydrogel&#8208;based flexible supercapacitors possess the merits of highly ionic conductivity and superior power density, but the existence of water limits their application in extreme temperature scenarios. Noticeably, it is a challenge for people to design more extremely temperature adaptable systems for flexible supercapacitors based on hydrogels with a wide temperature region. In this work, a wide&#8208;temperature flexible supercapacitor that can operate at &#8722;20&#8211;80&#8201;&#176;C was fabricated by an organohydrogel electrolyte and its combined electrode (also known as an electrode/electrolyte composite). Upon introducing highly hydratable LiCl into an ethylene glycol (EG)/H2O binary solvent, owing to the ionic hydration effect of LiCl and the hydrogen bond interaction between EG and H2O molecules, the organohydrogel electrolyte exhibits satisfactory resistance to freezing (freezing point of &#8722;113.9&#8201;&#176;C), anti&#8208;drying capability (78.2&#8201;% of weight retention after vacuum drying at 60&#8201;&#176;C for 12&#8197;h) and excellent ionic conductivity both at room temperature (13.9&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1) and low temperature (6.5&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 after 31&#8197;days at &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C). By using organohydrogel electrolyte as binder, the prepared electrode/electrolyte composite effectively reduces interface impedance and enhances specific capacitance due to the uninterrupted ion transport channels and extended interface contact area. The assembled supercapacitor delivers a specific capacitance of 149&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1, a power density of 160&#8197;W&#8201;kg&#8722;1, and an energy density of 13.24&#8197;Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 at a current density of 0.2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. The initial 100&#8201;% capacitance can be maintained after 2000 cycles at 1.0&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. More importantly, the specific capacitances can be well maintained even at &#8722;20 and 80&#8201;&#176;C. With other advantages such as excellent mechanical property, the supercapacitor is an ideal power source suitable for various working conditions.

Efficient methods for the synthesis of two types of furan&#8208;fused tricyclic compounds were developed based on a regiodivergent intramolecular carbometalation strategy using 2&#8208;(2&#8217;&#8208;alkynylaryl)&#8208;3&#8208;iodofurans as a common substrate. The methods involving the 6&#8208;endo&#8208;anti carbocupration or the formal intramolecular 5&#8208;exo&#8208;anti carbopalladation provide new access to a wide range of well&#8208;organized polysubstituted naphtho[1,2&#8208;b]furans and indeno[1,2&#8208;b]furans that are otherwise difficult to access.







Abstract

The iodine&#8208;magnesium exchange/copper&#8208;mediated 6&#8208;endo&#8208;anti intramolecular carbometalation sequence followed by nucleophilic substitution or palladium&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling provided 2,3,4,5&#8208;tetrasubstituted naphtho[1,2&#8208;b]furans. On the other hand, the formal intramolecular 5&#8208;exo&#8208;anti carbopalladation/cross&#8208;coupling sequence afforded 2,3&#8208;disubstituted 4&#8208;alkylidene&#8208;4H&#8208;indeno[1,2&#8208;b]furans. The present methods provide new access to a wide range of well&#8208;organized polysubstituted naphtho[1,2&#8208;b]furans and indeno[1,2&#8208;b]furans in a positional selective manner that are otherwise difficult to access.

         <title>Rhodamine&#8208;Sensitized Two&#8208;Photon Activation of a Red Light&#8208;Absorbing BODIPY Photocage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 25, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Only very few rhodamine photocages exist and two&#8208;photon activation of BODIPY is not possible. A new rhodamine&#8208;BODIPY dyad combines the favorable properties of both chromophores and allows to liberate a target molecule by two&#8208;photon irradiation.







Abstract
Two&#8208;photon (2P) activatable probes are of high value in biological and medical chemistry since near infrared (NIR) light can penetrate deeply even in blood&#8208;perfused tissue and due to the intrinsic three&#8208;dimensional activation properties. Designing two&#8208;photon chromophores is challenging. However, the two&#8208;photon absorption qualities of a photocage can be improved with an intramolecular sensitizer, which transfers the absorbed light onto the cage. We herein present the synthesis and photophysical characterization of a 2P&#8208;sensitive uncaging dyad based on rhodamine 101 as donor fluorophore and a redshifted BODIPY as acceptor photocage. Liberation of p&#8208;nitroaniline (PNA) upon one&#8208;photon photolysis was confirmed by HPLC analysis. The photoreaction was found to be accompanied by a considerable change of the fluorescence properties of the chromophores. The possibility of a fluorescent read&#8208;out enabled the detection of two&#8208;photon induced uncaging by confocal fluorescence microscopy.

         <title>Morphological Evolution of Calcite Grown in Zwitterionic Hydrogels: Charge Effects Enhanced by Gel&#8208;Incorporation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 25, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
To investigate the significance of the charged biomacromolecule incorporation for mineralization control, gel&#8208;incorporated calcite crystals grown from different gelatin hydrogels are examined. The charged groups on gel networks play crucial roles in controlling the single&#8208;crystallinity and the crystal morphology. The gel&#8208;incorporation greatly enhances the charge effects because the gel networks force the charged groups to attach to the crystallization fronts.







Abstract
The incorporation of charged biomacromolecules is widely found in biomineralization. To investigate the significance of this biological strategy for mineralization control, gelatin&#8208;incorporated calcite crystals grown from gelatin hydrogels with different charge concentrations along the gel networks are examined. It is found that the bound charged groups on gelatin networks (amino cations, gelatin&#8208;NH3+ and carboxylic anions, gelatin&#8208;COO&#8722;) play crucial roles in controlling the single&#8208;crystallinity and the crystal morphology. And the charge effects are greatly enhanced by the gel&#8208;incorporation because the incorporated gel networks force the bound charged groups on them to attach to crystallization fronts. In contrast, ammonium ions (NH4+) and acetate ions (Ac&#8722;) dissolve in the crystallization media do not exhibit the similar charge effects because the balance of attachment/detachment make them more difficult to be incorporated. Employing the revealed charge effects, the calcite crystal composites with different morphologies can be flexibly prepared.

         <title>Neutral Monodentate and Hypervalent Chalcogen Bond Catalysis on the Intramolecular Rauhut&#8208;Currier Reaction of Bis(enones): A DFT Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 25, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chalcogen bond (ChB) catalysis has been applied to the intramolecular Rauhut&#8208;Currier (RC) reaction of bis(enones). This study mainly explores two modes: ChB catalyst act on the promoter or reactant in the RC reaction. And the path of ChB catalyst direct acting on the reactant is considered to be a relatively favorable channel of the reaction.







Abstract
Recently, the green and high efficient of chalcogen bond (ChB) catalysis has been aroused great interest. In this work, the ChB catalysis has been applied to the intramolecular Rauhut&#8208;Currier (RC) reaction of bis(enones). The mechanism was divided into four processes: the promoter addition process, the carbon&#8208;carbon bond coupling process, the hydrogen transfer process, and the promoter elimination process. This study shows that the ChB catalyst could act on the promoter and reactant in the RC reaction, respectively. And the path 2 of ChB catalyst direct acting on the reactant is considered to be a relatively favorable channel of the reaction due to a lower energy barrier. In addition, all six catalysts could achieve good catalytic effect. Analysis of the properties shows that the formation of chalcogen bond mainly promotes the charge transfer of LP(O)&#8722;BD*(C&#8722;Se) in the carbon&#8208;carbon bond formation (key step), so that the charge of C(4) atom become more positive, thereby accelerating the reaction.

         <title>A Plasmon Resonance Enhanced Photo&#8208;Electrode to Promote NH3 Yield in Sustainable N2 Conversion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 25, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy is proposed to address current NH3 yield challenge of NRR by achieving low H* coverages at appreciable current densities based on the unique SPR effect and established a correlation between H* coverage and NRR performance. The specifically designed ZnSe(Au) electrode achieves a high FE and NH3 yield rate of 27.3&#8201;% and 12.2&#8197;&#956;g cm&#8722;2 h&#8722;1, respectively.







Abstract
A key challenge for electrochemical nitrogen reduction reactions (NRR) is the difficulty for conventional catalysts to achieve high currents at low H* coverage to produce appreciable NH3. Herein, we specially designed an Au nanoparticle&#8208;embedded ZnSe photo&#8208;electrode to solve the problem. As&#8208;designed photo&#8208;electrode achieves excellent NRR performance with a high NH3 yield (12.2&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;cm&#8722;2 h&#8722;1) and Faradaic efficiency (27.3&#8201;%). Our work reveals that the unique plasmon resonance effect of embedded Au nanoparticles plays a key role in increasing catalytic current when the H* coverage is decreased. Moreover, we successfully established a correlation between H* coverage and NRR performance based on theoretical calculations and experimental observations. This work paves the path for the future design of catalytic materials to overcome the selectivity and yield challenge of sustainable NH3 production.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A strategy is proposed&lt;/b&gt; to address current NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; yield challenge of NRR by achieving low H* coverages at appreciable current densities based on the unique SPR effect and established a correlation between H* coverage and NRR performance. The specifically designed ZnSe(Au) electrode achieves a high FE and NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; yield rate of 27.3&#8201;% and 12.2&#8197;&#956;g cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A key challenge for electrochemical nitrogen reduction reactions (NRR) is the difficulty for conventional catalysts to achieve high currents at low H* coverage to produce appreciable NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. Herein, we specially designed an Au nanoparticle-embedded ZnSe photo-electrode to solve the problem. As-designed photo-electrode achieves excellent NRR performance with a high NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; yield (12.2&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and Faradaic efficiency (27.3&#8201;%). Our work reveals that the unique plasmon resonance effect of embedded Au nanoparticles plays a key role in increasing catalytic current when the H* coverage is decreased. Moreover, we successfully established a correlation between H* coverage and NRR performance based on theoretical calculations and experimental observations. This work paves the path for the future design of catalytic materials to overcome the selectivity and yield challenge of sustainable NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; production.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Atroposelective Nenitzescu Indole Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 25, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unprecedented enantioselective Nenitzescu: A simple Jacobsen&#8208;type chromium(III)&#8208;salen complex has been used as a chiral enantiopure Lewis acid catalyst for a highly atroposelective Nenitzescu indole synthesis. Its practicality should make C&#8722;N atroposelective synthesis more accessible.







Abstract
In the past decade, compounds bearing a stereogenic C&#8722;N axis have gained significant attention in fields ranging from ligand to drug design. Yet, the atroposelective synthesis of these molecules remains a considerable challenge. In contrast to recent methods using more advanced chiral catalysts, a very simply accessed Jacobsen&#8208;type chromium(III)&#8722;salen complex was used here as a chiral enantiopure Lewis acid catalyst for a highly atroposelective Nenitzescu indole synthesis. Mild reaction conditions afforded various 5&#8208;hydroxybenzo[g]indoles in up to 97&#8201;% yield. Moreover, through a simple work&#8208;up, very high enantiomeric excesses of up to 99&#8201;% could be obtained.

         <title>Coinage Metal Bis(amidinate) Complexes as Building Blocks for Self&#8208;Assembled One&#8208;Dimensional Coordination Polymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 25, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two different self&#8208;assembled one&#8208;dimensional heterobimetallic coordination polymer types were synthesized by combining newly designed metalloligands with [Zn(hfac)2] or [M(acac)2] (M=Ni/Co) as linker. These polymers show either a linear or zig zag structure in the solid state.







Abstract
The pyridyl functionalized amidinate [{PyC&#8801;CC(NDipp)2}Li(thf)2]n was used to synthesize a series of bis&#8208;amidinate complexes [{PyC&#8801;CC(NDipp)2}2M2] (M=Cu, Ag, Au) with fully supported metallophilic interactions. These metalloligands were then used as building blocks for the synthesis of one&#8208;dimensional heterobimetallic coordination polymers using Zn(hfac)2 (hfac=hexaflouroacetylacetonate) for self&#8208;assembly. Interestingly, the three coordination polymers [{PyC&#8801;CC(NDipp)2}2M2][Zn(hfac)2] (M=Cu, Ag, Au), exhibit a zig zag shape in the solid state. To achieve linear coordination geometry other connectors such as M&#8217;(acac) (M&#8217;=Ni, Co) (acac=acetylacetonate) were investigated. The thus obtained compounds [{PyC&#8801;CC(NDipp)2}2Cu2][M&#8217;(acac)2] (M&#8217;=Ni, Co) are indeed linear heterobimetallic coordination polymers featuring a metalloligand backbone with fully supported metallophilic interactions.

         <title>TBAI&#8208;Catalysed Formal [4+4]&#8208;Cycloaddition: Easy Access to Oxa&#8208;Bridged Eight&#8208;Membered Heterocycles</title>

         <dc:description>
A straightforward and atom&#8208;economical approach for the synthesis of oxa&#8208;bridged eight&#8208;membered heterocycles has been developed via TBAI&#8208;catalysed oxidative formal [4+4] cyclization of hydrazones with anthranils. This transformation involves the formation of two new C&#8722;N bonds and C&#8722;O bond in a one&#8208;pot manner, which breaks a limitation of anthranils in organic synthesis.







Abstract
TBAI&#8208;catalysed [4+4]&#8208;cyclization reaction of anthranils with hydrazones to deliver oxa&#8208;bridged eight&#8208;membered heterocycles in accepted yields was developed. Preliminary mechanistic studies indicated that the reaction involved the in&#8197;situ generation of vinyldiazenes from readily available hydrazones followed by an aza&#8208;Michael addition of the anthranil substrates onto the vinyldiazenes and subsequent annulation. This transformation involved the formation of two new C&#8722;N bonds and C&#8722;O bond in one pot, overcoming the synthetic limitations of anthranils in organic chemistry. This strategy benefits from high efficiency and atomic economy with mild reaction conditions.

         <title>Dual Chemiexcitation by a Unique Dioxetane Scaffold Gated by an OR Logic Set of Triggers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 25, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of a unique 1,2&#8208;dioxetane chemiluminescent scaffold with chemiexcitation gated by an OR logic set of triggering events is reported. The scaffold was applied to design a chemiluminescent probe that is activated by the enzymes &#946;&#8208;galactosidase and alkaline phosphatase. The ability of the probe to detect the two enzymatic activities in bacteria was successfully demonstrated.







Abstract
Chemiexcitation of phenoxy&#8208;1,2&#8208;dioxetane chemiluminescent luminophores is initiated by electron transfer from a meta&#8208;positioned phenolate ion to the peroxide&#8208;dioxetane bond. Here we report the development of a unique 1,2&#8208;dioxetane chemiluminescent scaffold with chemiexcitation gated by an OR logic dual&#8208;set of triggering events. This scaffold is composed of meta&#8208;dihydroxyphenyl&#8208;1,2&#8208;dioxetane&#8208;adamantyl molecules, equipped with acrylic acid and chlorine substituents, that chemiexcitation under physiological conditions. A dual&#8208;mode chemiluminescent probe, armed with two different triggering substrates designed for activation by the enzymes &#946;&#8208;galactosidase and alkaline phosphatase, was synthesized. The probe emitted intense light signals in the response to each enzyme, demonstrating its ability to serve as a single&#8208;component chemiluminescent sensor for dual&#8208;analyte detection. We also demonstrated the ability of the probe to detect &#946;&#8208;galactosidase and phosphatase activities in bacteria. This is the first 1,2&#8208;dioxetane scaffold capable of responding to two different chemiexcitation events from two different positions on the same dioxetane molecule. We anticipate that the OR&#8208;gated mode of chemiexcitation, described herein, will find utility in the preparation of chemiluminescent probes with a dual&#8208;analyte detection/imaging mode.

         <title>Front Cover: Atroposelective Nenitzescu Indole Synthesis (Chem. Eur. J. 25/2023)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 25, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the helix&#8208;shaped vines growing in the garden, as well as for many bioactive molecules and other three&#8208;dimensional objects, chirality is an essential and ubiquitous property. The synthetic control of atropoisomerism along C&#8722;N bonds is particularly rare and challenging, however. A simple CrIII&#8211;salen complex was nevertheless used as a chiral enantiopure catalyst for a highly atroposelective Nenitzescu indole synthesis. More information can be found in the Research Article by F.&#8197;W. Patureau and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202300279).

The energy storage cycle of the molecular solar thermal (MOST) system has been investigated. In particular, upon irradiation, the energy&#8208;lean 2&#8208;carbethoxy&#8208;3&#8208;phenyl&#8208;norbornadiene is converted into its energy&#8208;rich quadricyclane isomer. The energy&#8208;releasing back reaction can be triggered thermally by means of a suitable catalyst surface. The differences in the energy landscapes is visualized by sea level and mountains. More information can be found in the Research Article by C. Papp and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202203759). Cover design by F. Hemauer.

         <title>Cover Feature: Wide&#8208;Temperature Flexible Supercapacitor from an Organohydrogel Electrolyte and Its Combined Electrode (Chem. Eur. J. 25/2023)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 25, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A flexible supercapacitor that integrates a wide application temperature range, satisfactory electrochemical performance and mechanical properties was fabricated by using anti&#8208;freezing and anti&#8208;drying organohydrogels both as electrolyte and binder of the combined electrode. The H2O molecules in the organohydrogel are fixed in the 3D polyacrylamide network through the hydrogen bond interaction of ethylene glycol and ionic hydration of LiCl, thus greatly limiting their crystallization or evaporation at extreme temperatures. More information can be found in the Research Article by J. Hao and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202300123).

Plasmonic photocatalysis for CO2 reduction attracts increasing attention because it represents a promising strategy for effective CO2 storage and conversion, which holds great potential for real applications. In this review, the remarkable progresses on plasmonic photocatalytic CO2 reduction and the general design principles of efficient plasmonic photocatalysts are discussed.







Abstract
Plasmonic photocatalysis for CO2 reduction is attracting increasing attention due to appealing properties and great potential for real applications. In this review, the fundamentals of plasmonic photocatalysis and the most recent developments regarding its application in driving CO2 reduction are reported. Firstly, we present the review on the mechanism of plasmonic photocatalytic CO2 reduction, the energy transfer of plasmon, and the CO2 reduction process on the catalyst surface. Then, the modulation on the plasmonic nanostructures and also the semiconductor counterpart to regulate CO2 photoreduction is discussed. Next, the influence of the core&#8208;shell structure and the interface between the plasmonic metal and semiconductor on the CO2 photoreduction performance is also outlined. In addition, the latest progress on the emerging direction regarding the plasmonic photocatalysis for methane dry reforming with CO2 is especially emphasized. Finally, a summary on the challenges and prospects of this promising field are provided.

Next, the influence of the core-shell structure and the interface between the plasmonic metal and semiconductor on the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; photoreduction performance is also outlined. In addition, the latest progress on the emerging direction regarding the plasmonic photocatalysis for methane dry reforming with CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is especially emphasized. Finally, a summary on the challenges and prospects of this promising field are provided.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Crown Ether&#8208;Based Ion Transporters in Bilayer Membranes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 25, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent progress of crown ether&#8208;based transmembrane ion transporters is summarized in this Review. The molecular design principles, working mechanism, dynamic regulation and biomedical applications of the crown ether&#8208;derived ion transporters are systematically analyzed. Additionally, future opportunities and challenges facing this field are discussed.







Abstract
Bilayer membranes that enhance the stability of the cell are essential for cell survival, separating and protecting the interior of the cell from its external environment. Membrane&#8208;based channel proteins are crucial for sustaining cellular activities. However, dysfunction of these proteins would induce serial channelopathies, which could be substituted by artificial ion channel analogs. Crown ethers (CEs) are widely studied in the area of artificial ion channels owing to their intrinsic host&#8211;guest interaction with different kinds of organic and inorganic ions. Other advantages such as lower price, chemical stability, and easier modification also make CE a research hotspot in the field of synthetic transmembrane nanopores. And numerous CEs&#8208;based membrane&#8208;active synthetic ion channels were designed and fabricated in the past decades. Herein, the recent progress of CEs&#8208;based synthetic ion transporters has been comprehensively summarized in this review, including their design principles, functional mechanisms, controllable properties, and biomedical applications. Furthermore, this review has been concluded by discussing the future opportunities and challenges facing this research field. It is anticipated that this review could offer some inspiration for the future fabrication of novel CEs&#8208;derived ion transporters with more advanced structures, properties, and practical applications.

         <title>Atroposelective Nenitzescu Indole Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 25, May 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#8220;This study brings C&#8722;N atroposelectivity outside of the hands of a few methodology experts, and into the hands of general organic chemists, biochemists, medicinal chemists, etc.&#8221; This and more about the story behind the front cover can be found in the article at 10.1002/chem.202300279).







Abstract
Invited for the cover of this issue is the group of Frederic&#8197;W. Patureau at the RWTH Aachen University. The image depicts atropoisomerism, in particular through the helix&#8208;shaped vines in the forefront focus. This metaphorically illustrates the importance of atroposelectivity in biologically active molecules, such as in the 5&#8208;hydroxyindoles that were accessed through the first enantioselective Nenitzescu indole synthesis.

         <title>Thienyl&#8208;Substituted Diboranes(4): Electronic Stabilization of Radicals versus Increased Reactivity towards Bond Activation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Low&#8208;valent main&#8208;group chemistry involves a balancing act between steric and electronic stabilization of the electron&#8208;rich low&#8208;oxidation&#8208;state main&#8208;group centers and their desired reactivity. Herein we show that the combination of sterically&#8208;shielding mesityl and rotationally flexible 2&#8208;thienyl groups, the latter having the potential to be either electronically stabilizing or activating, at a diborane(4) provides&#160;both radical&#8208;anion stabilization and unusual bond activation and rearrangement reactions. The addition of a Lewis base to a 1,2&#8208;dimesityl&#8208;1,2&#8208;dithienyldiborane(4) (1) results in direct and unprecedented C&#8210;H borylation of one thienyl substituent with cleavage of the B&#8210;B bond. The facile one&#8208;electron reduction of 1 yields a stable diboron radical anion through delocalization of its unpaired electron over the entire planar 1,2&#8208;dithienyldiboron framework, as evidenced by EPR spectroscopy and DFT calculations. The two&#8208;electron reduction of 1 with magnesium&#8208;anthracene under more forcing conditions results in B&#8210;B&#8208;bond cleavage and replacement of one thienyl sulfur atom by a mesitylboron moiety, leading to the formation of a magnesium complex of an &#951;5&#8208;diborafulvene dianion. Salt metathesis of the latter with [(&#951;6&#8208;p&#8208;cymene)RuCl2] affords a mixed ruthenium sandwich complex of an &#951;5&#8208;borylborole dianion. Calculations highlight the structural and electronic changes in the boron&#8208;substituted heterocyclic C4B dianion upon switching coordination from magnesium (diborafulvene dianion) to ruthenium (borylborole dianion).</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This paper reports on two new Dion&#8208;Jacobson layered perovskite polymorphs of the known oxyfluoride compound KWO3F. A high&#8208;pressure modification was synthesized using a multianvil setup and subsequently transformed into a high&#8208;temperature phase at ~311 &#176;C. The crystal structures of both polymorphs were determined by use of single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and are described in detail herein. Differential thermal analyses and thermogravimetric analyses were carried out to further investigate the phase transition characteristics. Bond valence (BV) and charge distribution (CHARDI) calculations confirm the occupancy of mixed O|F anion positions, and Rietveld refinements as well as MAPLE calculations support the structure models.</dc:description>

         <title>Development of Bifunctional, Raman Active Diyne&#8208;Girder Stapled &#945;&#8208;Helical Peptides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stapled peptides are a unique class of cyclic &#945;&#8208;helical peptides that are conformationally constrained via their amino acid side&#8208;chains. They have been transformative to the field of chemical biology and peptide drug discovery through addressing many of the physicochemical limitations of linear peptides. However, there are several issues with current chemical strategies to produce stapled peptides. For example, two distinct unnatural amino acids are required to synthesise i, i + 7 alkene stapled peptides, leading to high production costs. Furthermore, low purified yields are obtained due to cis/trans isomers produced during ring&#8208;closing metathesis macrocyclisation. Here we report the development of a new i, i + 7 diyne&#8208;girder stapling strategy that addresses these issues. The asymmetric synthesis of nine unnatural Fmoc&#8208;protected alkyne&#8208;amino acids facilitated a systematic study to determine the optimal (S,S)&#8208;stereochemistry and 14&#8208;carbon diyne&#8208;girder bridge length. Diyne&#8208;girder stapled T&#8208;STAR peptide 29 was demonstrated to have excellent helicity, cell permeability and stability to protease degradation. Finally, we demonstrate that the diyne&#8208;girder constraint is a Raman chromophore with potential use in Raman cell microscopy. Development of this highly effective, bifunctional diyne&#8208;girder stapling strategy leads us to believe that it can be used to produce other stapled peptide probes and therapeutics.</dc:description>

         <title>Amino&#8208;Ene Click Reaction of Electron&#8208;Deficient &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Molecules with Negative Activation Enthalpies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An amino&#8208;ene click reaction is a type of aza&#8208;Michael addition reaction that is congruent with click chemistry in terms of its reaction efficiency and rate under mild conditions. The amino&#8208;ene click reaction is increasingly recognized as a prominent synthetic tool to form C&#8211;N bonds in the context of organic materials chemistry and polymer chemistry. Herein we report an unconventional amino&#8208;ene click reaction with negative activation enthalpies, where an electron&#8208;deficient &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecule such as a naphthalenediimide reacts with an amine faster at lower temperatures. The detailed study of the reaction mechanism reveals that the amino&#8208;ene click reaction proceeds via a pre&#8208;equilibrium reaction, the key to which is the formation of a stable reaction intermediate due to the solvation and charge delocalization on the &#960;&#8208;core. By optimizing the reaction conditions, we demonstrated that the amino&#8208;ene click reaction proceeded faster at 273 K than at 347 K, which was easily observed visually.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering Oxygen Vacancies on VO2 multilayered Structures for Efficient Zn2+ Storage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Vanadium dioxide (VO2(B)) is a proper cathode for aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) due to its shear structure and high theoretical capacity. However, the sluggish kinetics and structure instability derived from the strong electrostatic interaction between Zn2+ and the VO2 host hinder its further application. Defect engineering is a useful way to circumvent the limitations. Herein, oxygen&#8208;defect VO2 (O d &#8208;VO2) with tunable oxygen vacancy concentration are obtained via a facile one&#8208;step hydrothermal method by adjusting ascorbic acid addition. It&#8217;s proved that oxygen vacancies can provide extra active sites for Zn2+ storage and reduced electrostatic barrier for Zn2+ transportation, but excessive vacancy content would lead to a reverse effect. The O d &#8208;VO2 cathode with optimum oxygen vacancy concentration achieves an outstanding performance with a high capacity of 380 mAhg&#8208;1 at 0.2 A g&#8208;1, excellent cycle stability with 92.6% capacity retention after 2000 cycles at 3 A g&#8208;1 and a high energy density of 197 Wh kg&#8208;1 at the power density of 0.641 kW kg&#8208;1. Therefore, this defect engineering method for O d &#8208;VO2 provide an attractive way for high&#8208;performance aqueous ZIB cathodes.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Nsp2&#8208; and Csp2&#8208; photografting of Au&#8208;Surface by aryldiazonium salts and arylazo sulfonates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Arylazo sulfonates (Ar&#8208;N=N&#8208;SO3Na) were found to undergo photografting on gold surface through both Au&#8208;Nsp2&#8208; and Au&#8208;Csp2&#8208; bond formation. The functionalized materials have been fully characterized by Infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (IRRAS), Raman, XPS, DFT calculations and UV&#8208;Vis absorption spectroscopy. These methods permit to evidence aromatic substituents (IRRAS), the Au&#8208;N=N signature (Raman and XPS spectroscopy) and the Bond Dissociation Energy values of the two linkages (DFT calculation). The grafting proceeds through two competitive paths, namely a stepwise reaction involving an aryl radical (for the formation of the Au&#8208;Ar bonds) and a concerted reaction on the surface of gold (for Au&#8208;N=N&#8208;Ar bond formation). The occurrence of an aryl radical upon irradiation has been fully evidenced via EPR spectroscopy. Finally, E/Z photoisomerisation of the N=N bonds present on prepared few layers films was observed by means of UV&#8208;Vis absorption spectroscopy.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Narrowband emitters based on multiple resonance (MR) effect have shown great promises for applications in high&#8208;definition displays. Though most reported MR emitters adopt the boron&#8208; and nitrogen&#8208; doped triangulene&#8208;like skeleton following the design of the DABNA series, MR materials with the nitrogen&#8208;only indolocarbazole structures have recently emerged and demonstrated good color tunability from violet to deep red and impressive electroluminescence performances in terms of both efficiency and stability. Herein, we will summarize indolocarbazole&#8208;based MR materials in recent reports, with emphasis on their molecular design, synthesis, photophysical and electroluminescence properties as well as some future research directions to unlock the full potential of this fascinating class of materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry with collision induced dissociation of uranyl peroxide nanoclusters containing various uranyl bridging ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We utilized electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry with collision&#8208;induced dissociation (ESI&#8208;MS/MS) to study the gas phase fragmentation of uranyl peroxide nanoclusters with hydroxo, peroxo, oxalate, and pyrophosphate bridging ligands. These nanoclusters fragment into uranium monomers and dimers with mass&#8208;to&#8208;charge (m/z) ratios in the 280&#8211;380 region. The gas phase fragmentation of each cluster studied yields a distinct UO6&#8211; anion attributed to the cleavage of a uranyl ion bound to 2 peroxide groups, along with other anions that can be attributed to the initial composition of the nanoclusters.</dc:description>

         <title>Lead&#8208;free Double Perovskite Semiconductor with Rigid Spacer&#8208;Induced High&#8208;Tc Dielectric Switch Features</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Layered hybrid perovskites possess exceptional semiconductor features and structural versality, making them viable candidates for developing multifunctional dielectric phase&#8208;transition materials (PTMS).However, most PTMs based on layered hybrid perovskites still suffer from Pb toxicity and low operating temperature.The recently developed hybrid double perovskites provide a new routine to designed PTMs with desired working performance and environment&#8208;friendly chemical compositions. Herein, using rigid aromatic cations as templates, we have successfully synthesized a novel double perovskite (benzylammonium)4AgBiBr8(1), which consists of corner&#8208;sharing AgBr6 and BiBr6 layers and benzylammonium cations. Notably, 1 exhibits a high&#8208;temperature first&#8208;order reversible solid&#8208;state phase transition at 383/387 K(cooling/heating) and switchable dielectric performance around the temperature. Compared with the soft organic chain version of the compound, the phase transition temperature of 1 shows a large enhancement of 99 K, validating the correctness of the designing strategy. In addition, 1 also exhibits semiconductor characteristics with a calculated bandgap of 2.34 eV and an optical bandgap of 2.29 eV. Remarkably, the single crystal photodetector of 1 shows a low dark current(2.12&#215;10&#8208;13&#160;A), a high on/off ratio(1.77&#215;103), and a fast response(&#964;rise=125 &#956;s and &#964;decay=419 &#956;s). Such a lead&#8208;free phase transition material combined with semiconductor properties provides a new strategy to develop environmentally friendly multifunctional materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Modulating Energy Transfer and Light&#8208;Emitting Colors by Chiral Dye Exchange and Achiral&#8208;to&#8208;Chiral Dye Conversion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>New chiral and achiral dyes were synthesized by using clean, highly efficient Diels&#8208;Alder &#8216;click&#8217; reactions. We prepared pure endo&#8208; and exo&#8208; stereoisomers and blue&#8208;light&#8208;emitting single crystal of an exo&#8208;isomer. 1H NMR spectroscopy and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction reveal the precise spatial configurations of endo&#8208; and exo&#8208;dye stereoisomers. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction results reveal the dynamic nature of Diels&#8208;Alder covalent bonds. By reversible formation and cleavage of dynamic covalent bonds, an achiral dye was converted to a chiral dye, where achiral dansyl dye moiety was replaced by chiral moiety. Before achiral&#8208;to&#8208;chiral dye conversion, the dye system displayed dansyl acceptor green light&#8208;emitting color due to intramolecular fluorescence resonance energy transfer, where the blue emission of pyrene donor fluorophore was not observed. After achiral&#8208;to&#8208;chiral dye conversion, light&#8208;emitting colors of dye system change from green to blue, where the pyrene&#8208;to&#8208;dansyl fluorophore energy transfer was suppressed, and pyrene fluorophore blue emission was restored. Chiral transfer occurs in a chiral dye solid from non&#8208;chromophore alky chirality to pyrene chromophore. Thus, the chiral dye solid displayed chiral optical behaviors, i.e. circular dichroism and circularly polarized luminescence.</dc:description>

We prepared pure endo- and exo- stereoisomers and blue-light-emitting single crystal of an exo-isomer. 1H NMR spectroscopy and single-crystal X-ray diffraction reveal the precise spatial configurations of endo- and exo-dye stereoisomers. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction results reveal the dynamic nature of Diels-Alder covalent bonds. By reversible formation and cleavage of dynamic covalent bonds, an achiral dye was converted to a chiral dye, where achiral dansyl dye moiety was replaced by chiral moiety. Before achiral-to-chiral dye conversion, the dye system displayed dansyl acceptor green light-emitting color due to intramolecular fluorescence resonance energy transfer, where the blue emission of pyrene donor fluorophore was not observed. After achiral-to-chiral dye conversion, light-emitting colors of dye system change from green to blue, where the pyrene-to-dansyl fluorophore energy transfer was suppressed, and pyrene fluorophore blue emission was restored. Chiral transfer occurs in a chiral dye solid from non-chromophore alky chirality to pyrene chromophore. Thus, the chiral dye solid displayed chiral optical behaviors, i.e. circular dichroism and circularly polarized luminescence.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Trinuclear PdII Complexes Bearing a C3&#8208;Symmetric Triethynylbenzene&#8208;Based Tris&#8208;NHC Ligand: Catalytic Benefits</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel C3&#8208;symmetric tris&#8208;imidazolium tribromide salt 3, featuring 1,3,5&#8208;substituted triethynylbenzene, was used for the preparation of a trinuclear PdII PEPPSI (pyridine&#8208;enhanced precatalyst preparation stabilization and initiation) type complex by triple C2 deprotonation followed by the addition of PdCl2. Trinuclear PdII complex possessing a combination of NHC and PPh3 ligands has also been synthesized. The corresponding mononuclear palladium(II) complexes have also been synthesized for the comparison purpose. All these complexes have been characterized by using NMR spectroscopy and ESI mass spectrometry. The molecular structure of the trinuclear palladium(II) complex bearing mixed carbene and pyridine donor ligands has been established by using single crystal XRD. All the palladium(II) complexes have been used as pre&#8208;catalysts which gave good to excellent yields in intermolecular &#945;&#8208;arylation of 1&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxindole and Sonogashira coupling reaction. Catalytic studies indicate an enhanced activity of the trinuclear PdII complex in comparison to the corresponding mononuclear PdII complex for both catalytic transformations. The better performance of the trinuclear complex has also been further supported by preliminary electrochemical measurements. A negative mercury poison test was observed for both the aforementioned catalyses and therefore, it is likely that these organic transformations proceed homogeneously.</dc:description>

         <title>A Structural Perspective into the Interaction of an Oncogenesis&#8208;Relevant pre&#8208;miRNA G&#8208;Quadruplex Ligand Carrier with the Protein Nucleolin</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The structural determinants of the interaction of the G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) motif found in precursor miRNA 149 (rG4) with the acridine orange derivative C8, a G4 ligand stabilizer possessing anticancer activity, and the protein nucleolin (overexpressed in cancer cells) were investigated by NMR spectroscopy. For the rG4/C8 complex, the results revealed a strong stabilizing interaction between the aromatic core and the iodinated ring of the C8 ligand with the rG4 structure. The NMR study revealed also different interaction patterns between nucleolin and rG4 and nucleolin and rG4/C8 complex. In the absence of the ligand, rG4 establishes interactions with polar residues of the protein while for the rG4/C8 complex, these contacts are mainly established with amino acids that have hydrophobic side chains. However, nucleolin chemical shift perturbation studies in the presence of rG4 or rG4/C8 reveal the same location between domains 1 and 2 of the protein, which suggests that the rG4 and rG4/C8 complex bind in this region. This puzzling structural study opens a new framework to study rG4/ligand/nucleolin complexes that might impact the biogenesis of miRNA 149.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural Self&#8208;Assembly and Applications of Metal&#8208;Organic Molecular Containers with Flexible Backbones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular chemistry has become an interdisciplinary discipline of chemistry, physics, and biology. As a huge subunit of supramolecular compounds, the functional metal&#8208;organic supramolecular systems with well&#8208;defined cavities which are able to accommodate size&#8208;suitable guests via benign host&#8208;guest behavior, have been known as &#8220;metal&#8208;organic molecular containers&#8221; (MOMCs) and attracted much attentions for their rich chemical properties and wide potential applications in molecular recognition, catalysis, bio&#8208;medical and other fields. In particular, the MOMCs with flexible backbones exhibit a unique feature both in the aspect of structural construction and applications, due to the free rotation and self&#8208;adaptively of the specific functional groups in the skeletons. In this paper, we review several selected examples of the coordination&#8208;driven metal&#8208;organic supramolecular systems from the aspects of self&#8208;assembly construction to the various applications. The self&#8208;assembly strategies, especially the different choice of organic ligands with flexible backbones during the construction, leading to quite diverse configurations compared to the rigid ligands, have been also discussed to show a different perspective of metal&#8208;organic system construction.</dc:description>

         <title>A Transparent, Healable&#160;and Recyclable Alicyclic Poly(ether&#8208;b&#8208;amide) Multiblock Copolymer&#160;with Ultrahigh Toughness</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Self&#8208;healing polyamide multiblock copolymer with robust mechanical properties is highly desired. Here, an alicyclic diamine monomer, isophoronediamine (IPDA), with asymmetric structure and substantial steric hindrance was incorporated into the backbone of poly(ether&#8208;b&#8208;amide) multiblock copolymer. Based on the phase&#8208;lock effect, the mechanical properties and segmental mobility of copolymers can be modulated on a large scale via adjusting the molecular weight of hard segments. An extraordinary tensile strength of 32.0 MPa and an excellent elongation at break of 1881% were simultaneously achieved, which leaded to a record&#8208;high toughness of 328.9 MJ m&#8208;3 for self&#8208;healable polyamide elastomers. The synergism between the dynamic H&#8208;bonding networks and the diffusion of polymer chains contributed to a balance between the mechanical performance and self&#8208;healing efficiency of copolymers. Due to the adjustable mechanical performance, rapid scratch self&#8208;healing ability and superior impact resistance, the resultant copolymers showed great potential in the fields of protective coatings and soft electronics.</dc:description>

         <title>Lead&#8208;Free Perovskite Cs2SnBr6/rGO Composite for Photocatalytic Selective Oxidation of 5&#8208;Hydroxymethylfurfural to 2,5&#8208;Diformylfuran</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Severe poisonousness and prolonged instability existing in organic&#8208;inorganic lead&#8208;based perovskite are two matters seriously hindering its potential future application in photocatalysis. Therefore, it is particularly important to explore ecology&#8208;friendly, air&#8208;stable and highly active metal&#8208;halide perovskites. Herein, a novel and stable lead&#8208;free perovskite Cs2SnBr6 decorated with reduced graphene oxide (rGO), is synthesized and employed in the photocatalytic organic conversion. The as&#8208;prepared Cs2SnBr6&#173; is ultrastable, exhibiting no obvious changes after being placed in the air for six months. The Cs2SnBr6/rGO composite shows excellent photocatalytic activity in photo&#8208;driven&#8208;oxidation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to high value enclosed 2,5&#8208;diformylfuran (DFF), achieving &gt; 99.5% conversion of HMF and 88% DFF selectivity in the presence of green oxidant O2. Comprehensive characterizations disclose a multistep reaction mechanism, demonstrating that the molecular oxygen, photogenerated carriers, &#8226;O2&#8208; and 1O2 altogether synergistically participate in the effective photo&#8208;driven conversion of HMF to DFF. This work expands the material gallery towards selective organic conversion and environmentally friendly perovskite options for photocatalytic application.</dc:description>

         <title>Etheno&#8208;bridged Azaacene Spiro Dimers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present the synthesis of two sets of spiro&#8208;connected azaacene dimers. Their geometry and electronic coupling are critically determined by a secondary linker, i.e. an etheno&#8208; and an ethano&#8208;bridge. The core fragment of the etheno&#8208;bridged dimer corresponds to a conformationally locked cis&#8208;stilbene. Optoelectronic properties, single crystal X&#8208;ray structures and stability with respect to oxidation of the conjugated and non&#8208;conjugated dimers are reported and compared. The conjugated dimers exhibit smaller optical gaps and bathochromically shifted absorption maxima, but are prone to unexpected oxygen addition, dearomatizing one of the azaacene substituents.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heavier tetrylenes attract attention for their potential in synthesis, catalysis and small molecule activation. The coordination by N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) and cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbenes (CAACs) results in substantial structural and electronic differences although typically only one of these yields stable derivatives for one and the same tetrylene. We now report both NHC&#8208; and CAAC&#8208;coordination to a bridged bis(germylene) motif. The NHC&#8208;coordinated bis(germylene) exhibits pyramidal germanium centers with lone pairs of electrons, while with CAAC an unprecedented stable bis(germene) with two Ge=C bonds is isolated. Spectroscopic and crystallographic evidence as well as DFT calculations confirm the effects of &#963;,&#960;&#8208;conjugation between the two germanium centers in both cases. The coordination of NHC is reversible as the reaction with BPh3 liberates the transient bis(germylene) and thus provides an alternative low&#8208;temperature route towards polymers with Ge=Ge bonds.</dc:description>

         <title>(3+2)&#8208;Cyclization Reactions of Unsaturated Phosphonites with Aldehydes and Thioketones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unsaturated phosphonites are excellent substrates in new (3+2)&#8208;cyclization reactions with aldehydes or thioketones. The cyclisation reactions proceed smoothly at room temperature and lead to the fast formation of the previously inaccessible phosphorus heterocycles 1,3&#8208;oxa&#8208; and 1,3&#8208;thiaphosphole&#8208;3&#8208;oxides in good to excellent yields.







Abstract
By exploiting the unique reactivity of ethynyl&#8208;phosphonites we obtain novel P(V)&#8208;containing five&#8208;membered heterocycles via (3+2)&#8208;cyclization reactions with aldehydes or cycloaliphatic thioketones in satisfactory to excellent yields. Whereas reactions with thioketones to yield 1,3&#8208;thiaphospholes&#8208;3&#8208;oxides occur smoothly at room temperature with equimolar amounts of the starting materials in absence of any catalyst, the analogous conversions with aldehydes to generate 3&#8208;oxides of 1,3&#8208;oxaphospholes require addition of triethylamine as a base. We postulate a step&#8208;wise (3+2)&#8208;cyclization mechanism for the formation of the 1,3&#8208;thiaphosphole ring based on DFT quantum chemical calculations. With this study, we introduce new cyclization reactions originating from unsaturated phosphonites as central synthetic building blocks to yield previously inaccessible stable phosphorus&#8208;containing heterocycles with unexplored potential for the molecular sciences.

         <title>Chemical Synthesis of Alpha&#8208;Synuclein Proteins via Solid&#8208;Phase Peptide Synthesis and Native Chemical Ligation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The aggregation of alpha&#8208;Synuclein, a protein associated with several neurodegenerative diseases, can be altered by mutations and by posttranslational modifications, but the precise effects of these alterations are still elusive. Here, we devised a strategy for the chemical synthesis of the protein combining solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis and native chemical ligation. This enables the synthesis of custom&#8208;made protein variants to determine their aggregation behavior.







Abstract
Alpha&#8208;Synuclein (&#945;&#8208;Synuclein) is a 140 amino acid protein implicated in neurodegenerative disorders known as synucleinopathies, where it accumulates in proteinaceous inclusions in the brain. The normal physiological function of &#945;&#8208;Synuclein remains obscure, as it exists in several non&#8208;neuronal cells in which its function has not been studied. Given the tremendous interest in studying &#945;&#8208;Synuclein, and the existing limitations in the production of modified forms of the protein, we developed a method for the chemical synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Synuclein by combining peptide fragment synthesis via automated microwave&#8208;assisted solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis and ligation strategies. Our synthetic pathway enables the synthesis of protein variants of interest, carrying either mutations or posttranslational modifications, for further investigations of the effects on the structure and aggregation behavior of the protein. Ultimately, our study forms the foundation for future syntheses and studies of other custom&#8208;made &#945;&#8208;Synuclein variants with a single or several modifications, as necessary.

         <title>Eletrocarboxylation Reactions Using CO2 Both as Promoter and Carboxylative Reagent</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrocarboxylation reaction employs CO2 as a carboxylative reagent to prepare value&#8208;added carboxylic acid via organic electrosynthesis. In some cases, CO2 also acts as a promoter to facilitate the desired reaction. This Concept mainly highlights recent CO2&#8208;promoted electrocarboxylation reactions via CO2&#8901;&#8722; intermediate or transiently protective carboxylation of active intermediate with CO2.







Abstract
Electrocarboxylation reaction, which employs organic electrosynthesis to achieve the utilization of CO2 as a carboxylative reagent, provides a powerful and efficient tool for the preparation of organic carboxylic acid. In some electrocarboxylation reactions, CO2 also acts as a promoter to facilitate the desired reaction. This concept mainly highlights recent CO2&#8208;promoted electrocarboxylation reactions via CO2&#8901;&#8722; intermediate or transiently protective carboxylation of active intermediate with CO2.

         <title>Redox Convergent Synthesis and Reactivity of a Cobalt(III)&#8208;Pentasulfido Compound</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new Co(III)&#8208;pentasulfido compound has been synthesized by a unique redox convergent reaction between two new cobalt(II)&#8208;thiolate compounds and elemental sulfur. Detailed reactivity of the Co(III)&#8208;pentasulfido compound towards reducing agents, phosphines, and proton, and transfer of the coordinated pentasulfido chain to selected organic compounds for the generation of organopolysulfide compounds have been demonstrated.







Abstract
A new mononuclear cobalt(III)&#8208;pentasulfido compound, [(L)Co(S5)] (3) has been synthesized by using a convergent redox reaction between elemental sulfur and two new cobalt(II)&#8208;thiolato compounds, [(L)Co(SR)] (R=Ph, 2&#8201;a; 2,6&#8208;Me2&#8208;C6H4, 2&#8201;b), which in turn were synthesized from a dimeric cobalt(II) complex, [(L)2Co2]2+ (1). Compound 3 features a low&#8208;spin, diamagnetic, Co(III) center with a coordinated pentasulfido (S52&#8722;) chain and has no precedence in the literature. Compound 3 is highly stable towards reduction with a potential of &#8722;1.36&#8197;V (vs. Cp2Fe+/Cp2Fe) and gives back 1 upon chemical/electrochemical reduction. Reaction of 3 with phosphines yields back 1 and phosphine sulfides, while protonation of the coordinated S52&#8722; chain in 3 leads to the formation of 1, elemental sulfur and H2S. Finally, transfer of the coordinated S52&#8722; chain in 3 to selected organic compounds, such as MeI, PhCH2Br and PhCOCl, for the generation of organopolysulfido compounds has been demonstrated.

&lt;p&gt;A new Co(III)-pentasulfido compound has been synthesized by a unique redox convergent reaction between two new cobalt(II)-thiolate compounds and elemental sulfur. Detailed reactivity of the Co(III)-pentasulfido compound towards reducing agents, phosphines, and proton, and transfer of the coordinated pentasulfido chain to selected organic compounds for the generation of organopolysulfide compounds have been demonstrated.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new mononuclear cobalt(III)-pentasulfido compound, [(L)Co(S&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)] (&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;) has been synthesized by using a convergent redox reaction between elemental sulfur and two new cobalt(II)-thiolato compounds, [(L)Co(SR)] (R=Ph, &lt;b&gt;2&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt;; 2,6-Me&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;b&gt;2&#8201;b&lt;/b&gt;), which in turn were synthesized from a dimeric cobalt(II) complex, [(L)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;).

         <title>Nanoscale Probing of the Supramolecular Assembly in a Two&#8208;Component Gel by Near&#8208;Field Infrared Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Understanding the nanoscale interactions: The determination of the secondary structure of supramolecular gels usually refers to the macroscopic material. It is shown that the secondary structure and non&#8208;covalent interactions driving the self&#8208;assembly vary at the nanoscale depending on the configuration of the fibrous network.







Abstract
The design of soft biomaterials requires a deep understanding of molecular self&#8208;assembly. Here a nanoscale infrared (IR) spectroscopy study of a two&#8208;component supramolecular gel is introduced to assess the system's heterogeneity and supramolecular assembly. In contrast to far&#8208;field IR spectroscopy, near&#8208;field IR spectroscopy revealed differences in the secondary structures of the gelator molecules and non&#8208;covalent interactions at three distinct nano&#8208;locations of the gel network. A &#946;&#8208;sheet arrangement is dominant in single and parallel fibres with a small proportion of an &#945;&#8208;helix present, while the molecular assembly derives from strong hydrogen bonding. However, at the crossing point of two fibres, only the &#946;&#8208;sheet motif is observed, with an intense &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking contribution. Near&#8208;field nanospectroscopy can become a powerful tool for the nanoscale distinction of non&#8208;covalent interactions, while it is expected to advance the existing spectroscopic assessments of supramolecular gels.

Regiopure 1,6/7 perylenediimide (PDI) precursors are prepared at the gram scale for the first time, offering the possibility to systematically study the regioisomerism&#8208;dependant optoelectronic properties of PDI&#8208;based materials.







Abstract
The use of perylenediimide (PDI) building blocks in materials for organic electronic is of considerable interest. This popular n&#8208;type organic semiconductor is tuned by introducing peripheral groups in their ortho and bay positions. Such modifications radically alter their optoelectronic properties. In this article, we describe an efficient method to afford regioisomerically pure 1,6/7&#8208;(NO2)2&#8208; and (NH2)2&#8208;PDIs employing two key steps: the selective crystallization of 1,6&#8208;(NO2)2&#8208;perylene&#8208;3,4,9,10&#8208;tetracarboxy tetrabutylester and the nitration of regiopure 1,7&#8208;Br2&#8208;PDI with silver nitrite. The optoelectronic properties of the resulting regioisomerically pure dinitro, diamino&#8208;PDIs and bisazacoronenediimides (BACDs) are reported and demonstrate the need to separate both regioisomers of such n&#8208;type organic semiconductors for their inclusion in advanced optoelectronic devices. For the first time, the two regioisomers of the same PDI starting material are available on the multigram scale, which will stimulate the exploration of regioisomerism/properties relationship for this family of dyes.

         <title>Structural and Synthetic Insights on Oxidative Homocouplings of Alkynes Mediated by Alkali&#8208;Metal Manganates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alkali&#8208;metal manganates can efficiently promote homocoupling of terminal alkynes affording 1,3&#8208;diynes using dry air as terminal oxidant. Reactivity studies including the trapping of key organometallic intermediates have revealed that Na/Mn(II) is the most efficient bimetallic partnership to promote these reactions under stoichiometric regimes.







Abstract
Exploiting bimetallic cooperation alkali&#8208;metal manganate (II) complexes can efficiently promote oxidative homocoupling of terminal alkynes furnishing an array of conjugated 1,3&#8208;diynes. The influence of the alkali&#8208;metal on these C&#8722;C bond forming processes has been studied by preparing and structurally characterizing the alkali&#8208;metal tetra(alkyl) manganates [(TMEDA)2Na2Mn(CH2SiMe3)4] and [(PMDETA)2K2Mn(CH2SiMe3)4]. Reactivity studies using phenylacetylene as a model substrate have revealed that for the homocoupling to take place initial metalation of the alkyne is required. In this regard, the lack of basicity of neutral Mn(CH2SiMe3)2 precludes the formation of the diyne. Contrastingly, the tetra(alkyl) alkali&#8208;metal manganates behave as polybasic reagents, being able to easily deprotonate phenylacetylene yielding [{(THF)4Na2Mn(C&#8801;CPh)4}&#8734;] and [(THF)4Li2Mn(C&#8801;CPh)4]. Controlled exposure of [{(THF)4Na2Mn(C&#8801;CPh)4}&#8734;] and [(THF)4Li2Mn(C&#8801;CPh)4] to dry air confirmed their intermediary in formation of 1,4&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;butadiyne in excellent yields. While the Na/Mn(II) partnership proved to be the most efficient in stoichiometric transformations, under catalytic regimes, the combination of MC&#8801;CAr (M= Li, Na) and MnCl2 (6&#8197;mol&#8201;%) only works for lithium, most likely due to the degradation of alkynylsodiums under the aerobic reaction conditions.

         <title>Esterase Specific Fluorescent Probe: Mechanistic Understanding Using QM/MM Calculation and Cell States Discrimination</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An esterase&#8208;specific ratiometric fluorescent probe, PM&#8208;OAc, can distinguish live and dead cells based on esterase enzyme activity. The action of the esterase enzyme and active site for binding with the probe is demonstrated by MD simulation and QM/MM calculations.







Abstract
Esterases enzymes regulate the body's homeostasis by catalyzing the hydrolysis of various esters. These are also involved in protein metabolism, detoxification, and signal transmission. Most importantly, esterase plays a significant role in cell viability and cytotoxicity assays. Hence, developing an efficient chemical probe is essential for monitoring the esterase activity. Several fluorescent probes for esterase have also been reported targeting cytosol and lysosomes. However, the ability to create efficient probes is constrained due to a lack of understanding of the esterase&#8216;s active site for hydrolyzing the substrate. In addition, the fluorescent turn&#8208;on may limit efficient monitoring. Herein, we have developed a unique fluorescent probe, PM&#8208;OAc, to monitor mitochondrial esterase enzyme activity ratiometrically. This probe exhibited a bathochromic wavelength shift with esterase enzyme in alkaline pH (pH&#8764;8.0) due to an intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) process. The phenomenon is well supported by TD&#8208;DFT calculation. Moreover, the substrate (PM&#8208;OAc) binding at the active site of esterase and its catalytic mechanism to hydrolyze the ester bond are elucidated by molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and QM/MM (Quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics) calculations, respectively. Fluorescent image&#8208;based analysis of the cellular environment reveals that our probe can distinguish between live and dead cells based on esterase enzyme activity.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;An esterase-specific ratiometric fluorescent probe&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;PM-OAc&lt;/b&gt;, can distinguish live and dead cells based on esterase enzyme activity. The action of the esterase enzyme and active site for binding with the probe is demonstrated by MD simulation and QM/MM calculations.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Esterases enzymes regulate the body's homeostasis by catalyzing the hydrolysis of various esters. These are also involved in protein metabolism, detoxification, and signal transmission. Most importantly, esterase plays a significant role in cell viability and cytotoxicity assays. Hence, developing an efficient chemical probe is essential for monitoring the esterase activity. Several fluorescent probes for esterase have also been reported targeting cytosol and lysosomes. However, the ability to create efficient probes is constrained due to a lack of understanding of the esterase&#8216;s active site for hydrolyzing the substrate. In addition, the fluorescent turn-on may limit efficient monitoring. Herein, we have developed a unique fluorescent probe, &lt;b&gt;PM-OAc&lt;/b&gt;, to monitor mitochondrial esterase enzyme activity ratiometrically. This probe exhibited a bathochromic wavelength shift with esterase enzyme in alkaline pH (pH&#8764;8.0) due to an intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) process. The phenomenon is well supported by TD-DFT calculation. Moreover, the substrate (&lt;b&gt;PM-OAc)&lt;/b&gt; binding at the active site of esterase and its catalytic mechanism to hydrolyze the ester bond are elucidated by molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and QM/MM (Quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics) calculations, respectively. Fluorescent image-based analysis of the cellular environment reveals that our probe can distinguish between live and dead cells based on esterase enzyme activity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Polymeric Unimolecular CO Dehydrogenase Mimic with both Inner and Outer Spheres for Enhanced Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction in Aqueous Solution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inspired by carbon monoxide dehydrogenase (CODH), mimicking its inner and outer spheres is a promising strategy in CO2 reduction catalyst design. However, artificial&#160;CODH&#8208;like catalysts are generally limited to the inner sphere effect and only applicable in organic solvents or for electrocatalysis. Herein, we report an aqueous CODH mimic with both inner and outer spheres for photocatalysis. In this polymeric unimolecular catalyst, the inner sphere is composed of cobalt porphyrin with four appended amido groups and the outer sphere consists of four poly(2(dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate) (PDMAEMA) arms. Upon visible light irradiation (&#955; &gt; 420 nm), the as&#8208;prepared photocatalyst exhibits a high turnover number (TONCO = 1731.2) in the reduction of CO2 into CO, which is superior to most reported molecular photocatalysts in aqueous solution. The mechanism studies indicate that, in this water&#8208;dispersible and structurally well&#8208;defined CODH mimic, the cobalt porphyrin core serves as the catalysis center, amido groups function as hydrogen&#8208;bonding pillars helping to stabilize the CO2 adduct intermediate, while PDMAEMA shell renders both the water solubility and a CO2 reservoir through reversibly capturing of CO2. The present work has clarified the significance of inner and outer coordination sphere effects for improving the aqueous photocatalytic CO2 reduction performance of CODH mimics.</dc:description>

         <title>Antitumor Activity and Reductive Stress by Platinum(II) N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes based on Guanosine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Platinum(II) complexes bearing N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes based guanosine and caffeine have been synthesized by unassisted C&#8208;H oxidative addition, leading to the corresponding trans&#8208;hydride complexes. Platinum guanosine derivatives bearing triflate as counterion or bromide instead of hydride as co&#8208;ligand were also synthesized to facilitate correlation between structure and activity. The hydride compounds show high antiproliferative activity against all cell lines (TC&#8208;71, MV&#8208;4&#8208;11, U&#8208;937 and A&#8208;172). Methyl Guanosine complex 3, bearing a hydride ligand, is up to 30 times more active than compound 4, with a bromide in the same position. Changing the counterion has no significant effect in antiproliferative activity. Increasing bulkiness at N7, with an isopropyl group (compound 6), allows to maintain the antiproliferative activity while decreasing toxicity for non&#8208;cancer cells. Compound 6 leads to an increase in endoplasmic reticulum and autophagy markers on TC71 and MV&#8208;4&#8208;11 cancer cells, induces reductive stress and increases glutathione levels in cancer cells but not in non&#8208;cancer cell line HEK&#8208;293.</dc:description>

         <title>Dinuclear iron(II) triple helicates exhibiting room temperature spin transition behaviour in solid and solution phase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, three dinuclear iron (II) helicates (complexes 1&#8208;3 ) have been synthesized using imidazole and pyridine&#8208;imine&#8208;based ligands having fluorene moiety in the backbone. A change in the ligand field strength by terminal modulation led to a change in the spin transition behaviour from incomplete, multi&#8208;step to complete, around room temperature in the solid state. Spin transition behaviour has also been observed in the solution phase characterized using variable temperature 1 H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (Evans method) and correlated using UV&#8208;visible spectroscopy. Fitting the NMR data using the ideal solution model provided the transition temperature in the order T&#189; ( 1 ) &lt; T&#189; ( 2 ) &lt; T&#189; ( 3 ), which indicates an increase in the ligand field strength from complexes 1 to 3 . This study accentuates the interplay between the ligand field strength, crystal packing, and supramolecular interactions in fine&#8208;tuning the spin transition behavior effectively.</dc:description>

         <title>18F&#8208;Labeling Chemistry in Aqueous Media</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>18F&#8208;Labeled molecular tracers and subsequent positron emission tomography are indispensable molecular imaging tools in medical diagnosis and research. In the preparation of 18F&#8208;labeled molecular tracers, the 18F&#8208;labeling reaction, attendant working&#8208;up and 18F&#8208;product purification are critical steps that are governed by 18F&#8208;labeling chemistry. Since direct incorporation of 18F in aqueous media exhibits many advantages in practice, this review summarizes the existing 18F&#8208;labeling methods in aqueous media, which are sorted by atoms forming chemical covalent bonds with F. We focused on the respective reaction mechanism, the water effect and the applications of these methods for the development of 18F&#8208;radiopharmaceuticals. The research progress on aqueous nucleophilic labeling methods using [18F]F&#8211; as the 18F source has been mainly discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Enabling Ultrahigh Surface Area of Covalently&#8208;linked Organic Framework for Boosted CO2 Capture: An Air Liquid Interfacial Plasma as Post&#8208;furnishing Protocol</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The cognitive intent of a highly ordered and robust adsorbent is extremely sensible and, in this context, Covalent Organic Framework (COF) materials have significantly burgeoned their scope in diverse applications. Herein, we present a simple time&#8208;competent hydrothermal procedure to construct a covalent framework with an ultrahigh surface area of 1428 m2/g that shows active adsorption of carbon dioxide (CO2) at variable temperature ranges. Moreover, we substantiate a facile scalably controlled post&#8208;synthetic air&#8208;liquid interfacial plasma (ALIP) induced protocol that explicitly amplifies the surface area of the pristine framework even to a higher value of 2051 m2/g. The post&#8208;synthetic plasma approach presented here led to the rapid enhancement of the surface area of the pristine COF by 43%, which concurrently advances the CO2 uptake up to 67%. Hence, the current study may open up a new frontier in the design as well as fine&#8208;tune the properties of the covalent framework that unfolds the advanced outlook in addressing the challenges of CO2 capture.</dc:description>

         <title>Cu2P7&#8208;CoP Heterostructure Nanosheets Enable High&#8208;Performance of 5&#8208;Hydroxymethylfurfural Electrooxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrooxidation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfural (HMF) into 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylicacid (FDCA) has been regarded as a promising sustainable approach to achieve value&#8208;added chemicals. However, it is still impeded by the unsatisfactory performance of electrocatalysts. Here, Cu2P7&#8208;CoP heterostructure nanosheets were reported to enable powerful HMF electrooxidation. The Cu2P7&#8208;CoP heterostructure nanosheets were fabricated by microwave&#8208;assisted deep eutectic solvent (DES) approach, along with subsequent phosphiding. The Cu2P7&#8208;CoP heterostructure nanosheets enabled a superb 100% HMF conversion at 1.43 V (vs. RHE) with 98.8% FDCA yield and 98% Faradaic efficiency (FE), demonstrating its promising application in HMF electrooxidation. X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis, open&#8208;circuit potential (OCP) approach and density functional theory (DFT) calculation uncovered that the electron transfer and redistribution between Cu2P7 and CoP improved the adsorption capacity of HMF and modulated the catalytic performance. This study not only offered a powerful electrocatalyst for HMF electrooxidation, but also provided a conceptually new strategy for the heterostructure catalyst design.</dc:description>

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis, open-circuit potential (OCP) approach and density functional theory (DFT) calculation uncovered that the electron transfer and redistribution between Cu2P7 and CoP improved the adsorption capacity of HMF and modulated the catalytic performance. This study not only offered a powerful electrocatalyst for HMF electrooxidation, but also provided a conceptually new strategy for the heterostructure catalyst design.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Toughening Hydrogels by forming Robust Hydrazide&#8208;transition Metal Coordination Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Energy dissipation based on dynamic fracture of metal ligands is one of effective means to toughen hydrogel materials for specific applications in biomedical and engineering fields. Exploration of new kinds of metal&#8208;ligand coordinates with robust bonding strength is crucial for the facile synthesis of tough gels. Reported here is a hydrogel toughening strategy based on the formation of robust coordination complexes between the hydrazide ligands and zinc ions. The resultant hydrogels exhibit high strength and toughness at room temperature. Their mechanical properties show temperature dependence due to the dynamic nature of coordination bonds. In addition, the amine group of hydrazides in the gel matrix provides reactive site for Schiff&#8217;s base reaction, enabling surface modification without influence on overall mechanical performances of the gel. The hydrazide ligands are easy&#8208;synthesis and can form robust coordination with several transition metals. Such metal&#8208;ligand coordinates should be suitable to other systems to develop tough soft materials with versatile applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Intramolecular Hiyama Coupling: Synthesis of 1,8,13&#8208;Trisubstituted Chiral Triptycenes with Three Different Substituents by Intramolecular Substituent Transfer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we describe Hiyama coupling via intramolecular substituent transfer from silicon on one blade of triptycenes to another to yield 1,8,13&#8208;trisubstituted chiral triptycenes. This reaction is attributed to the proximity effect of substituents on triptycene, which plays an important role in not only the formation of the oxy&#8208;palladacycle but also the activation of the silyl group to facilitate s&#8208;bond metathesis. After bromination and nucleophilic ring opening, the second intramolecular Hiyama coupling provided various 1,8,13&#8208;trisubstituted chiral triptycenes. The optical resolution of 1,8,13&#8208;triptycene afforded an optically active form for the first time.</dc:description>

         <title>Clusterization&#8208;triggered Room Temperature Phosphorescence Supramolecular Assembly with Extraordinary Stimulus&#8208;responsive Features from Nonaromatic Amino Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Achieving stimulus&#8208;responsive performance in room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials especially systems without classic conjugated groups is attractive and important but remains a great challenge. Herein we propose a universal approach to construct colors&#8208;tunable RTP supramolecular co&#8208;assemblies (AC@amino acid) with excitation wavelength&#8208;dependent properties through co&#8208;assembly of functional aminoclay (AC) and nonconjugated amino acid using environmentally friendly strategy. Experimental and theoretical results successfully disclose that the RTP feature is attributable to space conjugation through effective space electronic communications among different &#960; and n (lone pair) electrons of amino acid molecules and the effective stabilization of their triplet state by AC. Meanwhile, their colors&#8208;tunable performances are mainly owing to the co&#8208;existence of clusters with different aggregates degree through recrystallization of amino acid taking AC as a template. Importantly, AC@amino acid exhibit sensitive stimulus response features towards water, yet their RTP performance can be maintained in other solvents, such as ethanol (EtOH). By virtue of this unique feature, multilevel information encryption application were demonstrated. This work provides a unique insight and more deep understanding on designing novel RTP systems without classic conjugated groups. Importantly, their extraordinary stimulus&#8208;responsive performances endow these RTP systems with a highly promising potential for intelligent information encryption applications.</dc:description>

         <title>A Blueprint for Transforming Indigos to Photoresponsive Molecular Tools</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Indigo, one of the most ancient and abundant dyes in human history, has recently emerged as a potential functional motif due to its intriguing photochemical properties. This review aims to provide insights into both the preparation of these molecules and their utilization in molecular systems. First, the synthesis of the indigo core as well as available methods to derivatize indigo are described to outline synthetic strategies to build the desired molecular structures. Then, the photochemical behavior of indigos is discussed, with particular focus on E&#8208;Z photoisomerization and photoinduced electron transfer. Connections between the molecular structures and their photochemical properties are highlighted and serve as guiding principles for designing indigos to be applied as photoresponsive tools.</dc:description>

         <title>N&#8208;Protonation as a Switch of the Twisted Excited States with &#960;&#960;* or n&#960;* Character and Correlation with the &#960;&#8208;electrons Characteristic of Rotatable Bonds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>N&#8208;protonation for numerous fluorophores is widely known as an efficient switch for the fluorescence turn&#8208;on/off in acidic conditions, which has been applied in various scenarios that involve pH monitoring. Yet the universal mechanism for fluorescence regulation through N&#8208;protonation is still elusive. Herein, we systematically investigated the excited state deactivation processes for a series of nitrogen&#8208;containing fluorescent probes through theoretical approaches. We concluded two types of mechanisms for the complex fluorescent phenomena by N&#8208;protonation: one is through the regulation for the transition to a &#960;&#960;* twisted intramolecular charge transfer (TICT) state; the other one applies for the case when nonradiative decay pathway is predominant by a dark n&#960;* state, which is also accompanied by an evident structural twisting and can be regarded as another kind of TICT state. More generally, we found that the formation of the TICT state is closely related to the conjugated &#960;&#8208;electrons on the single bond that links the acceptor and donor part of fluorophores, which provides a simple strategy for evaluating the occurrence of the TICT process. We anticipate that the current contributions can bring novel insights for the rational design of functional fluorophores that involve TICT process in the excited states.</dc:description>

         <title>Helical Anatase Titanium Nanotubes through a Protected Crystallization Strategy for Enhanced Photocatalytic Performance</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Helical structure in catalysts has attached attention and been recently investigated for various catalytic reactions. However, helical transition metal oxides suffer from uncontrollable crystallization processes at high temperatures when being transformed from an amorphous phase into the crystalline structure. Herein, we report a helical anatase TiO2 nanotube for the first time, which has been prepared using a protected crystallization strategy in the confined space of silica. &#160;A single chirality of helical TiO2 has been used to track the ordering of the twisted structure. The twisted structure in helical anatase TiO2 nanotube is maintained after a vigorous crystallization process. Helical anatase TiO2 nanotube possesses more accessible active sites and abundant defects of oxygen vacancy and Ti3+ species owing to the twisted structure.&#160;The obtained helical anatase TiO2 nanotube exhibits superior photocatalytic activity for hydrogen production without adding any co&#8208;catalysts. This work provides new insights into the role of helical structure in transition metal&#8208;based catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Superoxide Dismutase&#8208;like Activity of Zeolitic Imidazolate Framework Nanoparticles Comprising Biomimetic Imidazolato&#8208;bridged CuZn Units</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanoparticles exhibiting enzymatic functions have garnered considerable attention due to their structural robustness and the profusion of active sites that can be introduced to a single nanosized particle. Here we report that nanosized mix&#8208;metal zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) show a superoxide dismutase (SOD)&#8208;like catalytic activity. We chose a ZIF composed of copper and zinc ions and 2&#8208;methylimidazole, CuZn&#8208;ZIF&#8208;8, in which the Cu and Zn ions are bridged by an imidazolato ligand. This coordination geometry closely mimics the active site of CuZn superoxide dismutase (CuZnSOD). The CuZn&#8208;ZIF&#8208;8 nanoparticles exhibit potent SOD&#8208;like activity, attributed to their porous nature and numerous copper active sites, and also possess exceptional recyclability.</dc:description>

         <title>New Hypothesis Insight of Structural Properties on Four Tau Peptide Fragments in Alzheimer's Disease: Origin from the Histidine Behaviors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>During protein folding and misfolding, structural properties and aggregation tendency can be significantly influenced by histidine behaviors (tautomeric behaviors and protonation behaviors). The original reasons were derived from the net charge changes and the various N/N&#8208;H orientation on imidazole rings. In the current study, total 18 independent REMD simulations were performed to investigate the histidine behaviors on four Tau peptide fragments (MBD, including R1, R2, R3, and R4 fragments). We found that, compared to R1, R2, R3 except (&#949;&#948;), and R4 systems with flexible structural features, only R3(&#949;&#948;) has dominating conformational structure (possibility of 81.3%) with three &#946;&#8208;strand structures in parallel &#946;&#8208;sheet structures at I4&#8208;K6&#160;and I24&#8208;H26, as well as antiparallel &#946;&#8208;sheet structure at G19&#8208;L21. Importantly, the H25 and H26 residues (in R3(&#949;&#948;) system) are directly involved in the sheet structure formations and strong H&#8208;bonded interactions (possibility range of 31.3%&#8208;44.7%). Furthermore, the donors and acceptors analysis confirmed that only R3(&#949;&#948;) shows faraway amino acids interaction features in both H25 and H26 residues, and such cooperation effects of two histidine residues contribute to current structural features. The current study will be helpful to further enrichment of the histidine behavior hypothesis, it provides new insight for understanding protein folding and misfolding.</dc:description>

         <title>A Dormant Reagent Reaction&#8208;Diffusion Method for the Generation of Co&#8208;Fe Prussian Blue Analogue Periodic Precipitate Particle Libraries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Liesegang patterns that develop&#160;as a result of reaction&#8208;diffusion can simultaneously form products with slightly different sizes spatially separated in a single medium. We show here a reaction&#8208;diffusion method using a dormant reagent (citrate) for developing Liesegang patterns of cobalt hexacyanoferrate Prussian Blue analog (PBA) particle libraries. This method slows the precipitation reaction and produces different&#8208;sized particles in a gel medium at different locations. The gel&#8208;embedded particles are still catalytically active. The applicability of the new method to other PBAs and 2D systems is presented. The method proves promising for obtaining similar inorganic framework libraries with catalytic abilities.</dc:description>

         <title>A Blue Light and Two&#8208;Photon Activatable Rhodamine Fluorophore</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoactivatable fluorophores (PAFs) are powerful tools for biological imaging applications because they provide spatiotemporal control of fluorescence distribution. Many of the existing PAFs can only be activated by UV irradiation. In our study, we present a blue light (1P) and NIR light (2P) activatable rhodamine fluorophore. Next to the description of the synthesis and the investigation of the photoreaction, we demonstrate the use of our PAF in the context of laser scanning microscopy. By immobilization of our PAF in a hydrogel, we were able to write and read spatially resolved illumination patterns with excellent contrast after both one&#8208;photon and two&#8208;photon excitation.</dc:description>

         <title>Wettability&#8208;Regulated Synthesis of Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Array with Subnanochannels Enables Efficient Separation of Mono&#8208;/Multi&#8208;valent Metal Ions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The efficient separation of mono&#8208;/multi&#8208;valent metal ions is essential in various fields but is still a great challenge. In this work, we present a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) array with subnanochannels for sieving of mono&#8208;/multi&#8208;valent metal ion with high selectivity and ion permeability. The MOF (i.e., HKUST&#8208;1) array inside the micrometer through&#8208;pores of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) membrane was synthesized by confined interfacial reaction at room temperature, through which the location of the oil/water interface was adjusted by regulating the surface wettability of the PET membrane. By taking advantage of size sieving effect of the subnanochannels of HKUST&#8208;1 crystals, mono&#8208;valent metal ions can be effectively separated from multi&#8208;valent metal ions with selectivity up to 3930 (e.g., Li+/Zr4+). The fluxes of Li+ ions can be up to 1.97 mol h&#8208;1 m&#8208;2. The MOF array&#8208;based membrane with subnanochannels developed in this work has promising applications in wastewater treatment, lithium extraction from salt&#8208;lake brines, and other related aspects.</dc:description>

Allyl 2&#8208;alkynylphenyl sulfides were transformed into dihydrobenzothiepines in 30&#8208;90% yield, and 2&#8208;alkynylaryl 2&#8208;tolyl sulfides were converted into dibenzo[b,f]thiepines in 57&#8208;95% yield along with double bond isomerization. In both reactions, the combination of Ir catalyst and sulfide moiety was a key to the facile cyclization.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural Interconversion Based on Intramolecular Boroxine Formation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel structural interconversion unit based on intramolecular boroxine formation is developed. A macrocyclic triboronic acid consisting of three phenylboronic acid units linked via covalent linkers preferentially underwent intramolecular boroxine formation rather than intermolecular boroxine formation, resulting in a quantitative formation of tricyclic boroxine. This structural transformation was accompanied with changes in the polarity, flexibility, and size of the molecule. Dynamic interconversion between the macrocyclic triboronic acid and the tricyclic boroxine was achieved via simple heating/cooling, while no boroxine formation occurred upon heating when three boronic acid units were not connected via linkers. Thermodynamic analysis revealed that the entropic advantage of the intramolecular boroxine formation process resulted in these unique features. The entropically stabilized tricyclic boroxine also shows high stability with respect to hydrolysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Racemic Benzenesulfonohydrazide Enantioconvergent Tertiary C(sp3)&#8211;H Amination Catalyzed by Copper and Chiral Phosphoric Acid: Mechanistic Insights and Computational Prediction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Density functional theory computations reveal mechanistic insights into Cu and chiral phosphoric acid (CPA) catalyzed enantioconvergent amination of racemic benzenesulfonohydrazide. The O&#8211;O bond homolysis of tert&#8208;butyl 4&#8208;phenylbutaneperoxoate was found to be the turnover&#8208;limiting step with a total free energy barrier of 19.1 kcal/mol. The enantioconvergent amination is realized to obtain the same intermediate through prochiral carbon atom. The order and mode of hydrogen atom transferred by CPA and tert&#8208;butyloxy have a significant influence on the enantioselectivity and energy barriers. The olefinic side product generated by &#946;&#8208;hydride elimination is 9.9 kcal/mol thermodynamically less favourable. A series of phosphoric acids are predicted as promising co&#8208;catalysts with lower barriers for O&#8211;O bond homolysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Protocell self&#8208;assembly driven by sodium trimetaphosphate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The co&#8208;evolution of peptide formation and membrane self&#8208;assembly is considered an essential step in the origin of life. In this study, we systematically investigated the sodium trimetaphosphate (P3m)&#8208;activated peptide formation reaction of Phe in an alkaline decanoic acid&#8208;decanol vesicle system. The experimental results showed that the peptide formation could competitively occur with N&#8208;acyl amino acid (NAA) formation. NAA formation did not follow the traditional P3m&#8208;activated peptide formation reaction involving the intermediate cyclic acylphosphoramidate (CAPA), but a phosphoric acid&#8208; decanoic acid mixed anhydride intermediate. NAA can form vesicles independently and reduce the critical vesicle concentration of the fatty&#8208;acid vesicles. 11 other representative amino acids, namely Ala, Asp, Glu, Gly, Ile, Leu, Pro, Ser, Thr, Val, and Arg, were selected for investigation. All of them reacted with decanoic acid to form NAA via the activation effect of P3m. Our experimental results indicate that the P3m activation effect can provide diversified raw membrane materials to form and stabilize protocell membranes; moreover, the small peptides, such as Phe&#8208;Leu, formed in the same reaction system can induce the amplification of primitive cells. This implies that synergistic symbiosis between membrane and peptide can be realized via the P3m activation effect.</dc:description>

         <title>In Vitro Selection and Characterization of a DNAzyme Probe for Diverse Pathogenic Strains of Clostridium difficile</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Clostridium difficile frequently causes an infectious disease known as Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) and there are urgent needs for the development of more effective rapid diagnostic tests for CDI. Previously we have developed an RNA&#8208;cleaving fluorogenic DNAzyme (RFD) probe named RFD&#8208;CD1, which is capable of detecting a specific strain of C. difficile but is too specific to recognize other pathogenic C. difficile strains. To overcome this issue, herein we report RFD&#8208;CD2, another RFD that is not only highly specific to C. difficile but also capable of recognizing diverse pathogenic C. difficile strains. Extensive sequence and structure characterization establishes a pseudoknot structure and a significantly minimized sequence for RFD&#8208;CD2. As a fluorescence sensor, RFD&#8208;CD2 can detect C. difficile at a concentration as low as 100 CFU/mL, making this DNAzyme an attractive molecular probe for rapid diagnosis of CDI caused by diverse strains of C. difficile.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Assembly and Gelating Behavior of (L)&#8208;Alanine Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study, we designed and synthesized a low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight organogelator derived&#160;from (l)&#8208;amino acids. We performed gelation assays using (l)&#8208;amino acid derivatives to confirm the gelation ability, which was found to be high in several compounds. The (l)&#8208;alanine derivatives were determined to be excellent gelators, forming good gels even when smaller amounts were added. These results led to a library of amino acid&#8208;derived organogelators. In addition, the thermal properties of the (l)&#8208;alanine&#160;derivatives with high gelation performance were measured. Differential scanning calorimetry measurements revealed that the thermal stability of the gels could be controlled by changing the gelator concentration. The surface states of the obtained gels were observed by field&#8208;emission scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy measurements, which confirmed the structure of the self&#8208;molecular aggregates. Self&#8208;molecular aggregates were observed to be helical or sheet&#8208;like, and the gels were constructed by forming aggregates via self&#8208;molecular recognition.</dc:description>

         <title>Harnessing Clickable Acylated Glycerol Probes as Chemical Tools for Tracking Glycerolipid Metabolism</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the use of clickable monoacylglycerol (MAG) analogs as probes for the general labeling of glycerolipids during lipid metabolism. Incorporation of azide tags onto the glycerol region was pursued to develop probes that would generally label glycerolipids, in which the click tag would not be removed through processes including acyl chain and headgroup remodeling. Analysis of clickable MAG probes containing acyl chains of different length resulted in widely variable cell imaging and cytotoxicity profiles.&#160; Based on these results, we focused on a probe bearing a short acyl chain (C4&#8208;MAG&#8208;N3) that was found to infiltrate natural lipid biosynthetic pathways to produce click&#8208;tagged versions of both neutral and phospholipid products. Alternatively, strategic blocking of the glycerol sn&#8208;3 position in probe C4&#8208;MEG&#8208;N3 served to deactivate phospholipid tagging and focus labeling on neutral lipids. This work shows that lipid metabolic labeling profiles can be tuned based on probe structures and provides valuable tools for evaluating alterations to general lipid metabolism in cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Entangled, Hofmeister effect&#8208;enhanced macromolecular adhesives for effective bonding in dynamic seawater</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Deployment of adhesives in natural seawater to in situ bond is urgently needed in engineering fields. However, stable adhesion in natural seawater remains a challenge due to the dynamic environment and high ion concentration. Herein, we reported an entangled, Hofmeister effect&#8208;enhanced macromolecular underwater adhesive (EHUA) for practical application in dynamic seawater. EHUA was synthesized via a facile one&#8208;step copolymerization. After transferred into seawater, the solvent of EHUA was exchanged to seawater, and thereby hydrogen bonds inside the adhesive were activated and enhanced by Hofmeister effect. We demonstrated EHUA can adhere on the surface in dynamic seawater, and the adhesive strength could reach 1.691 MPa. In addition, the adhesives also exhibited long&#8208;term storage stability and convenient recyclability. These fascinating properties enable adhesives to seal leaky pipelines, repair damaged ship and construct buildings in dynamic seawater. This work may open an avenue for the design of adhesives for natural seawater environment.</dc:description>
