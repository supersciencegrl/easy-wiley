         <title>A Rapid, Highly Sensitive and Selective Phosgene Sensor Based on 5,6&#8208;Pinenepyridine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The toxicity of phosgene (COCl  2  ) combined with its extensive use as a reactant and building block in the chemical industry make its fast and accurate detection a prerequisite. We have developed a carboxylic derivative of 5,6&#8208;pinenepyridine which is able to act as colorimetric and fluorimetric sensor for phosgene in air and solution. For the first time, the formation of a pyrido&#8208;[2,1&#8208;  a  ]isoindolone was used for this purpose. In solution, the sensing reaction is extremely fast (under 5 s), selective and highly sensitive, with a limit of detection (LOD) of 9.7 nM / 0.8 ppb. When fixed on a solid support, the sensor is able to detect the presence of gaseous phosgene down to concentrations of 0.1 ppm, one of the lowest values reported to date.</dc:description>

         <title>Spectroscopic, Crystallographic, and Electrochemical Study of Different Manganese(II)&#8208;Substituted Keggin&#8208;Type Phosphomolybdates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Adjusting the RedOx activity of polyoxometalate catalysts is a key challenge for the catalysis of selective oxidation reactions. For this purpose, we have investigated the possibility of influencing the RedOx potential by the introduction of an additional RedOx&#8208;active element. Thereby, we created Keggin&#8208;type POMs with up to three different elements in the metal framework. We present an advanced and reproducible synthetic procedure to incorporate Mn(II) and additionally V(V) into Keggin&#8208;type heteropolyacids alongside comprehensive characterization of the new molecules. The success of our syntheses was confirmed by vibrational spectroscopy (IR and Raman) and elemental analysis. Furthermore, the new compounds were analyzed with NMR&#8208;spectroscopy to investigate the characteristics of the polyoxometalates in solution. The structures of successfully crystalized compounds were determined by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Moreover, all synthesized compounds were characterized using UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy and electrochemical analysis to get further insights into the electronic transfer processes and redox potentials.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemoselective Acylation of Nucleosides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Acylated nucleoside analogs play an important role in medicinal chemistry and are extremely useful precursors to various other nucleoside analogs. However, chemoselective acylation of nucleosides usually requires several protection and deprotection steps due to the competing nucleophilicity of hydroxy and amino groups. In contrast, direct, protecting group free chemoselective acylation of nucleosides is a preferred strategy due to lower cost and fewer overall synthetic steps. Herein, we report a simple and efficient chemoselective acylation of nucleosides and nucleotides under mild reaction conditions, giving either O &#8208; or N &#8208;acylated products respectively with excellent chemoselectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>On the Fundamental Polymer Chemistry of Inverse Vulcanization for Statistical and Segmented Copolymers from Elemental Sulfur</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 35, June 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The detailed discussion of the fundamental and polymerization mechanism for sulfur copolymers is described from ring&#8208;opening polymerization, inverse vulcanization, dynamic covalent polymerization. In this article, we highlight the segmented sulfur polyurethane with flame retardancy through post&#8208;polymerization of sulfur copolymers. And we give the prospects for various applications of sulfur derived polymers.







Abstract
In this concept review, the fundamental and polymerization chemistry of inverse vulcanization for the preparation of statistical and segmented sulfur copolymers, which have been actively developed and advanced in various applications over the past decade is discussed. This concept review delves into a discussion of step&#8208;growth polymerization constructs to describe the inverse vulcanization process and discuss prepolymer approaches for the synthesis of segmented sulfur polyurethanes. Furthermore, this concept review discusses the advantages of inverse vulcanization in conjunction with dynamic covalent polymerization and post&#8208;polymerization modifications to prepare segmented block copolymers with enhanced thermomechanical and flame retardant properties of these materials.

         <title>Impact of N&#8208;Aryl&#8208; and NHC Core&#8208;Substituents on the Coupling of Alkylzinc Nucleophiles: Is Bigger always Better?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 35, June 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
For almost two decades bulkier Pd&#8208;NHC catalysts, in particular those chlorinated on the NHC backbone, led to vastly improved reactivity in a wide cross&#8208;section of cross&#8208;coupling applications. In the case of alkyl&#8208;alkyl Negishi coupling, that this trend was found to be strikingly reversed. Moreover, bulkier catalysts always led to reduced BHE of secondary organozincs with aryl oxidative addition partners &#8211; another trend that is reversed.







Abstract
Bulky Pd&#8722;N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalysts (e.&#8201;g., N&#8208;(di&#8208;2,6&#8208;(3&#8208;pentyl)phenyl), IPent) have been shown to have significantly higher reactivity in a wide variety of cross&#8208;coupling applications (i.&#8201;e., C&#8722;C, C&#8722;S, C&#8722;N) than less hindered variants (e.&#8201;g., N&#8208;(di&#8208;2,6&#8208;(isopropyl)phenyl), IPr). Further, chlorinating the backbone of the NHC ring sees an even greater increase in reactivity. In the cross&#8208;coupling of (hetero)aryl electrophiles to secondary alkyl nucleophiles, making the N&#8208;aryl groups larger reduces the amount of &#946;&#8208;hydride elimination leading to alkene byproducts and chlorinating the NHC core had an even greater effect, all but eliminating alkene formation. In the present study involving the cross&#8208;coupling of primary alkyl electrophiles and nucleophiles, a sharp and surprising reversal of all of the above trends was observed. Bulkier catalysts had generally slower rate of reaction and &#946;&#8208;hydride elimination worsened leading to extensive amounts of alkene byproducts.

         <title>Reactivity of Diphenylberyllium as a Br&#248;nsted Base and Its Synthetic Application</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 35, June 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Br&#248;nsted basic properties of diphenylberyllium have been used to cleanly produce a range of important benchmark compounds. The long&#8208;suspected structure of [Be3(OtBu)6] is finally verified, and shown to be static in solution; the NHC&#8208;stabilised beryllium Grignard is the first of its kind. The stark differences between Be&#8722;N and Be&#8722;P interactions are also evidenced here.







Abstract
Diphenylberyllium [Be3Ph6] is shown here to react cleanly as a Br&#248;nsted base with a vast variety of protic compounds. Through the addition of the simple molecules tBuOH, HNPh2 and HPPh2, as well as the more complex 1,3&#8208;bis&#8208;(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazolinium chloride, one or two phenyl groups in diphenylberyllium were protonated. As a result, the long&#8208;postulated structures of [Be3(OtBu)6] and [Be(&#956;&#8208;NPh2)Ph]2 have finally been verified and shown to be static in solution. Additionally [Be(&#956;&#8208;PPh2)(HPPh2)Ph]2 was generated, which is only the second beryllium&#8208;phospanide to be prepared; the stark differences between its behaviour and that of the analogous amide were also examined. The first crystalline example of a beryllium Grignard reagent with a non&#8208;bulky aryl group has also been prepared; it is stabilised with an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Br&#248;nsted basic&lt;/b&gt; properties of diphenylberyllium have been used to cleanly produce a range of important benchmark compounds. The long-suspected structure of [Be&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(O&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;Bu)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;] is finally verified, and shown to be static in solution; the NHC-stabilised beryllium Grignard is the first of its kind. The stark differences between Be&#8722;N and Be&#8722;P interactions are also evidenced here.

         <title>Isomorphic Fluorescent Nucleosides Facilitate Real&#8208;Time Monitoring of RNA Depurination by Ribosome Inactivating Proteins</title>

A real&#8208;time monitoring assay for RIP&#8208;mediated depurination: Ribosome&#8208;inactivating proteins (RIPs) interfere with protein synthesis by depurinating a specific adenosine residue within &#945;&#8208;sarcin/ricin loop. By strategically modifying a key position with responsive fluorescent nucleosides such as tzG, depurination by RIPs can be monitored in real time by fluorescence. The method provides insight into the RNA folding as well as RIPs&#8217; recognition features.







Abstract
Ribosome&#8208;inactivating proteins, a family of highly cytotoxic proteins, interfere with protein synthesis by depurinating a specific adenosine residue within the conserved &#945;&#8208;sarcin/ricin loop of eukaryotic ribosomal RNA. Besides being biological warfare agents, certain RIPs have been promoted as potential therapeutic tools. Monitoring their deglycosylation activity and their inhibition in real time have remained, however, elusive. Herein, we describe the enzymatic preparation and utility of consensus RIP hairpin substrates in which specific G residues, next to the depurination site, are surgically replaced with tzG and thG, fluorescent G analogs. By strategically modifying key positions with responsive fluorescent surrogate nucleotides, RIP&#8208;mediated depurination can be monitored in real time by steady&#8208;state fluorescence spectroscopy. Subtle differences observed in preferential depurination sites provide insight into the RNA folding as well as RIPs&#8217; substrate recognition features.

         <title>Investigations on the Synthesis, Reactivity, and Properties of Perfluoro&#8208;&#945;&#8208;Benzo&#8208;Fused BOPHY Fluorophores</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 35, June 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorinated BOPHY derivatives were synthesized and investigated as imaging and sensing probes. One such BOPHY displays a significantly red&#8208;shifted absorption/emission as a consequence of its planar geometry due to intramolecular hydrogen bond interactions. Another BOPHY derivative undergoes a reversible color change and fluorescence quenching in the presence of bases. Thiols, including cysteine and thioglucose, react efficiently with BOPHYs via regioselective aromatic fluorine substitution.







Abstract
The synthesis and reactivity of 3,8&#8208;dibromo&#8208;dodecafluoro&#8208;benzo&#8208;fused BOPHY 2 are reported, via SNAr with O&#8208;, N&#8208; S&#8208; and C&#8208;nucleophiles, and in Pd(0)&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions (Suzuki and Stille). The resulting perfluoro&#8208;BOPHY derivatives were investigated for their reactivity in the presence of various nucleophiles. BOPHY 3 displays reversible color change and fluorescence quenching in the presence of bases (Et3N, DBU), whereas BOPHY 7 reacts preferentially at the &#945;&#8208;pyrrolic positions, and BOPHY 8 undergoes regioselective fluorine substitution in the presence of thiols. The structural and electronic features of the fluorinated BOPHYs were studied by TD&#8208;DFT computations. In addition, their spectroscopic and cellular properties were investigated; BOPHY 10 shows the most red&#8208;shifted absorption/emission (&#955;max 659/699&#8197;nm) and 7 the highest fluorescence (&#934;f=0.95), while all compounds studied showed low cytotoxicity toward human HEp2 cells and were efficiently internalized.

         <title>A Single Bioinspired Hexameric Nickel Catechol&#8211;Alloxazine Catalyst Combines Metal and Radical Mechanisms for Alkene Hydrosilylation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 35, June 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual metal and radical reactivity is enabled by a polymetallic nickel complex merging alloxazine and catechol redox&#8208;active subunits. This is the first catalytic application of an alloxazine 3d metal complex and this complex promotes silyl radical generation and chain walking of internal alkenes.







Abstract
Mechanisms combining organic radicals and metallic intermediates hold strong potential in homogeneous catalysis. Such activation modes require careful optimization of two interconnected processes: one for the generation of radicals and one for their productive integration towards the final product. We report that a bioinspired polymetallic nickel complex can combine ligand&#8208; and metal&#8208;centered reactivities to perform fast hydrosilylation of alkenes under mild conditions through an unusual dual radical&#8208; and metal&#8208;based mechanism. This earth&#8208;abundant polymetallic complex incorporating a catechol&#8208;alloxazine motif as redox&#8208;active ligand operates at low catalyst loading (0.25&#8197;mol%) and generates silyl radicals and a nickel&#8208;hydride intermediate through a hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) step. Evidence of an isomerization sequence enabling terminal hydrosilylation of internal alkenes points towards the involvement of the nickel&#8208;hydride species in chain walking. This single catalyst promotes a hybrid pathway by combining synergistically ligand and metal participation in both inner&#8208; and outer&#8208; sphere processes.

Photodetectors: By incorporating diamine into the 3D CsPbBr3 motif, the first quasi&#8208;2D trilayered CsPbBr3&#8208;based Dion&#8208;Jacobson hybrid perovskite (4&#8208;AMP)Cs2Pb3Br10 (1, where 4&#8208;AMP2+=4&#8208;(aminomethyl)piperidinium), is acquired. Photodetectors based on 1 exhibit excellent photoresponse, superior to its monolayered and bilayered counterparts. Our results may widen the range of the potential material of photodetection and will be helpful to design hybrid perovskites for other advanced optoelectronic devices.







Abstract
Quasi&#8208;two&#8208;dimensional (Q&#8208;2D) Dion&#8208;Jacobson (DJ) organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid perovskites based on CsPbBr3 are promising candidates for photodetection. Previous studies have predicted that the photoresponse of such materials with high inorganic&#8208;layer numbers (n) will be more protruding in this portfolio. However, until now, only bilayered (n=2) CsPbBr3&#8208;based DJ&#8208;type hybrid perovskites are obtained and the higher number of layers (n&gt;2) remain completely unexplored, owing to the relatively high formation energies. Here, by incorporating diamine into the 3D CsPbBr3 motif, a new Q&#8208;2D trilayered CsPbBr3&#8208;based DJ&#8208;type hybrid perovskite that contains organic cation and inorganic Cs metal, namely (4&#8208;AMP)Cs2Pb3Br10 (1, 4&#8208;AMP2+=4&#8208;(aminomethyl)piperidinium, n=3), is obtained. Excitingly, 1 exhibits excellent photoresponse, superior to its single&#8208;layered and bilayered counterparts. The resulting photodetectors thus exhibit a large on/off ratio (&gt;103), high photodetectivity (6.5&#215;1010&#8197;Jones) and fast response speed (193&#8197;&#956;s). As far as we know, 1 is the first Q&#8208;2D CsPbBr3&#8208;based DJ&#8208;type hybrid perovskites with high n numbers. Our results may widen the range of the potential material in application of photodetection and will be helpful to design hybrid perovskites for other advanced optoelectronic devices.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Photodetectors&lt;/b&gt;: By incorporating diamine into the 3D CsPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; motif, the first quasi-2D trilayered CsPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-based Dion-Jacobson hybrid perovskite (4-AMP)Cs&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Pb&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Br&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;, where 4-AMP&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;=4-(aminomethyl)piperidinium), is acquired. Photodetectors based on &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; exhibit excellent photoresponse, superior to its monolayered and bilayered counterparts.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quasi-two-dimensional (Q-2D) Dion-Jacobson (DJ) organic-inorganic hybrid perovskites based on CsPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; are promising candidates for photodetection. Previous studies have predicted that the photoresponse of such materials with high inorganic-layer numbers (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;) will be more protruding in this portfolio. However, until now, only bilayered (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;=2) CsPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-based DJ-type hybrid perovskites are obtained and the higher number of layers (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;&amp;gt;2) remain completely unexplored, owing to the relatively high formation energies. Here, by incorporating diamine into the 3D CsPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; motif, a new Q-2D trilayered CsPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-based DJ-type hybrid perovskite that contains organic cation and inorganic Cs metal, namely (4-AMP)Cs&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Pb&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Br&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;, 4-AMP&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;=4-(aminomethyl)piperidinium, n=3), is obtained. Excitingly, &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; exhibits excellent photoresponse, superior to its single-layered and bilayered counterparts. The resulting photodetectors thus exhibit a large on/off ratio (&amp;gt;10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;), high photodetectivity (6.5&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;Jones) and fast response speed (193&#8197;&#956;s). As far as we know, &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; is the first Q-2D CsPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-based DJ-type hybrid perovskites with high &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; numbers. Our results may widen the range of the potential material in application of photodetection and will be helpful to design hybrid perovskites for other advanced optoelectronic devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Inactivation of Competitive Decay Channels Leads to Enhanced Coumarin Photochemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 35, June 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
To date, there is only little information on how to rationally optimize the uncaging efficiency of photocages. However, there are many studies that successfully optimized the performance of fluorophores. This study demonstrates that structural modifications inspired by the fluorophore ATTO 390 can lead to a one order of magnitude increase in the uncaging cross section of new coumarin photocages.







Abstract
In the development of photolabile protecting groups, it is of high interest to selectively modify photochemical properties with structural changes as simple as possible. In this work, knowledge of fluorophore optimization was adopted and used to design new coumarin&#8208; based photocages. Photolysis efficiency was selectively modulated by inactivating competitive decay channels, such as twisted intramolecular charge transfer (TICT) or hydrogen&#8208;bonding, and the photolytic release of the neurotransmitter serotonin was demonstrated. Structural modifications inspired by the fluorophore ATTO 390 led to a significant increase in the uncaging cross section that can be further improved by the simple addition of a double bond. Ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy gave insights into the underlying solvent&#8208;dependent photophysical dynamics. The chromophores presented here are excellently suited as new photocages in the visible wavelength range due to their simple synthesis and their superior photochemical properties.

         <title>Lipid A Mimetics Based on Unnatural Disaccharide Scaffold as Potent TLR4 Agonists for Prospective Immunotherapeutics and Adjuvants</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 35, June 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
TLR4 activating lipid A mimetics with picomolar affinity were assembled on the basis of an unnatural synthetic &#946;,&#946;&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;linked diglucosamine scaffold. Excellent stereoselectivity in a challenging &#946;,&#946;&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;glycosylation was achieved by tuning the reactivities of donor and acceptor molecules using protective group manipulation strategy. Specific 3D&#8208;molecular shape of &#946;GlcN(1&#8596;1&#8242;)&#946;GlcN disaccharide was decisive for induction of pro&#8208;inflammatory signaling by disaccharide lipid A mimetics (&#946;&#946;&#8208;DLAMs) based thereof. Potent immunostimulating potential was confirmed in human and murine immune cells rendering &#946;&#946;&#8208;DLAMs promising vaccine adjuvant candidates.







Abstract
TLR4 is a key pattern recognition receptor that can sense pathogen&#8208; and danger&#8208; associated molecular patterns to activate the downstream signaling pathways which results in the upregulation of transcription factors and expression of interferons and cytokines to mediate protective pro&#8208;inflammatory responses involved in immune defense. Bacterial lipid A is the primary TLR4 ligand with very complex, species&#8208;specific, and barely predictable structure&#8208;activity relationships. Given that therapeutic targeting of TLR4 is an emerging tool for management of a variety of human diseases, the development of novel TLR4 activating biomolecules other than lipid A is of vast importance. We report on design, chemical synthesis and immunobiology of novel glycan&#8208;based lipid A&#8208;mimicking molecules that can activate human and murine TLR4&#8208;mediated signaling with picomolar affinity. Exploiting crystal structure &#8208; based design we have created novel disaccharide lipid A mimetics (DLAMs) where the inherently flexible &#946;(1&#8594;6)&#8208;linked diglucosamine backbone of lipid A is exchanged with a conformationally restrained non&#8208;reducing &#946;GlcN(1&#8596;1&#8242;)&#946;GlcN scaffold. Excellent stereoselectivity in a challenging &#946;,&#946;&#8208;1,1&#8242; glycosylation was achieved by tuning the reactivities of donor and acceptor molecules using protective group manipulation strategy. Divergent streamlined synthesis of &#946;,&#946;&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;linked diglucosamine&#8208;derived glycolipids entailing multiple long&#8208;chain (R)&#8208;3&#8208; acyloxyacyl residues and up two three phosphate groups was developed. Specific 3D&#8208;molecular shape and conformational rigidity of unnatural &#946;,&#946;&#8208;1,1&#8242;&#8208;linked diglucosamine combined with carefully optimized phosphorylation and acylation pattern ensured efficient induction of the TLR4&#8208;mediated signaling in a species&#8208;independent manner.

         <title>Photoactivatable V&#8208;Shaped Bifunctional Quinone Methide Precursors as a New Class of Selective G&#8208;quadruplex Alkylating Agents</title>

G4 ligand Quinone Methide precursors. A new family of G&#8208;quadruplex alkylating compounds able to generate quinone methides (QM) through photochemical activation has been designed and synthesized. In the presence of the human telomeric sequence, ammonium salt precursors showed the ability to generate mono&#8208; and crosslinking products identified both by gel and MALDI&#8208;ToF mass spectrometry analysis.







Abstract
Combining the selectivity of G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) ligands with the spatial and temporal control of photochemistry is an emerging strategy to elucidate the biological relevance of these structures. In this work, we developed six novel V&#8208;shaped G4 ligands that can, upon irradiation, form stable covalent adducts with G4 structures via the reactive intermediate, quinone methide (QM). We thoroughly investigated the photochemical properties of the ligands and their ability to generate QMs. Subsequently, we analyzed their specificity for various topologies of G4 and discovered a preferential binding towards the human telomeric sequence. Finally, we tested the ligand ability to act as photochemical alkylating agents, identifying the covalent adducts with G4 structures. This work introduces a novel molecular tool in the chemical biology toolkit for G4s.

         <title>The Aryl Sulfide Synthesis via Sulfide Transfer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 35, June 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An eco&#8208;friendly sulfide transfer protocol is explored under a reductive Pd&#8208;catalyzed, Ni&#8208;mediated condition. Both experimental and theoretical results support the sulfide transfer over the aryl transfer. Late&#8208;functionalization of drugs and semiconducting materials highlight the importance of the method.







Abstract
Aryl sulfides are in great demands in drugs and materials sciences. To avoid using nucleophilic and noxious thiols, many efforts have been focused on exploring novel sulfide resources. Herein, a reductive Pd&#8208;catalyzed, Ni&#8208;mediated method to synthesize aryl sulfides via a sulfide transfer reaction is developed. The utility and scope of this reaction is exemplified by various aryl electrophiles and aryl sulfides. Mechanistic studies reveal two competing catalytic cycles of sulfide transfer and aryl transfer in this reaction, where the former one is favored over the later one because of the large energy barrier difference during the transmetalation. Moreover, two important chemicals are late&#8208;stage functionalized by this method, exhibiting the potential applications in drugs and materials science.

Herein, a reductive Pd-catalyzed, Ni-mediated method to synthesize aryl sulfides via a sulfide transfer reaction is developed. The utility and scope of this reaction is exemplified by various aryl electrophiles and aryl sulfides. Mechanistic studies reveal two competing catalytic cycles of sulfide transfer and aryl transfer in this reaction, where the former one is favored over the later one because of the large energy barrier difference during the transmetalation. Moreover, two important chemicals are late-stage functionalized by this method, exhibiting the potential applications in drugs and materials science.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Stereocontrolled Total Synthesis of Lipoxin B4 and its Biological Activity as a Pro&#8208;Resolving Lipid Mediator of Neuroinflammation</title>

Two stereocontrolled, efficient, and modular syntheses of eicosanoid lipoxin B4 (LXB4) are reported along with full spectral characterization of the natural product for the first time. Synthetic LXB4 exhibited significant neuroprotection in a cellular model of retinal ganglion cell survival assay. Our synthetic routes enable syntheses of new analogs and chemical probes for receptor and pathway identification.







Abstract
Two stereocontrolled, efficient, and modular syntheses of eicosanoid lipoxin B4 (LXB4) are reported. One features a stereoselective reduction followed by an asymmetric epoxidation sequence to set the vicinal diol stereocentres. The dienyne was installed via a one&#8208;pot Wittig olefination and base&#8208;mediated epoxide ring opening cascade. The other approach installed the diol through an asymmetric dihydroxylation reaction followed by a Horner&#8208;Wadsworth&#8208;Emmons olefination to afford the common dienyne intermediate. Finally, a Sonogashira coupling and an alkyne hydrosilylation/proto&#8208;desilylation protocol furnished LXB4 in 25&#8201;% overall yield in just 10&#8197;steps. For the first time, LXB4 has been fully characterized spectroscopically with its structure confirmed as previously reported. We have demonstrated that the synthesized LXB4 showed similar biological activity to commercial sources in a cellular neuroprotection model. This synthetic route can be employed to synthesize large quantities of LXB4, enable synthesis of new analogs, and chemical probes for receptor and pathway characterization.

         <title>Direct Synthesis of An Aluminosilicate POS Zeolite with Intersecting 12&#215;11&#215;11&#8208;Member&#8208;Ring Pore Channels by Using a Designed Organic Structure&#8208;Directing Agent</title>

Pure silica and aluminosilicate zeolites NUD&#8208;14 are directly synthesized by using a designed cation 1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;4&#8208;phenylpyridinium as an organic structure&#8208;directing agent, which show excellent acid and hydrothermal stabilities superior to their counterpart germanosilicate POS zeolite. The incorporation of Al into the zeolite framework makes the Al&#8208;NUD&#8208;14 zeolite possess medium and strong acidities, providing a platform for exploring its size&#8208; and shape&#8208;selective catalytic applications.







Abstract
Large and extra&#8208;large pore zeolites have been widely applied in industrial areas as catalysts, adsorbents, etc. Among them, silica and/or aluminosilicate zeolites have been attracted great attention due to their excellent hydrothermal stability and strong acidity. However, a great deal of zeolite structures are still not available in the form of silica and/or aluminosilicate. Herein, we report the synthesis of pure silica and aluminosilicate large&#8208;pore zeolites, denoted as NUD&#8208;14 and Al&#8208;NUD&#8208;14, respectively, by using a designed cation 1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;4&#8208;phenylpyridinium as an organic structure&#8208;directing agent (OSDA). NUD&#8208;14 has an intersecting 12&#215;11&#215;11&#8208;member ring pore system, which is isostructural to the germanosilicate PUK&#8208;16 zeolite with a POS topology. The OSDAs can be completely removed from the framework by calcination. NUD&#8208;14 and Al&#8208;NUD&#8208;14 possess excellent acid and hydrothermal stabilities, superior to the germanosilicate POS zeolite. The incorporation of Al into the zeolite framework makes the Al&#8208;NUD&#8208;14 zeolite possess medium and strong acidities. The successful synthesis of NUD&#8208;14 consisting of a rare odd&#8208;member ring pore structure may provide a platform for interesting size&#8208; and shape&#8208;selective catalytic applications.

         <title>Controllable Zeolite AST Crystallization: Between Classical and Reversed Crystal Growth</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 35, June 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A truly reversed crystal growth mode in which the crystallization starts at the surface of a spherically amorphous aggregate and then proceeds towards its center is described. The fundamental function of the structure&#8208;directing agent (SDA) controlling the crystallization pathway is uncovered. Thus, the crystallization pathway can be &#8220;switched&#8221; between classical and reversed crystal growth by tuning the concentration of the SDA.







Abstract
Crystal growth mechanisms govern a wide range of properties of crystalline materials. Reversed crystal growth is one of the nonclassical mechanisms observed in many materials. However, the reversed crystallization starting from amorphous aggregates and the key factors driving this growth remain elusive. Here, we describe a characteristic model of reversed crystal growth representing the inner structure and crystallinity development of aggregates studied by microscopy and nano X&#8208;ray computed tomography. By adjusting the synthesis conditions, the fundamental function of the structure&#8208;directing agent, which determines the crystallization pathway, was revealed. As a result, the crystal growth mode can be &#8220;switched&#8221; from the classical route at a low ratio of SDA/framework elements to reversed growth at a high ratio. Our findings provide further insights into crystal growth control, which is crucial for improving synthesis protocols and designing various forms of crystalline materials.

         <title>Biomimetic Peptide Catalytic Bond&#8208;Forming Utilizing a Mild Br&#248;nsted Acid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 35, June 21, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Liquid phase biomimetic catalytic peptide synthesis utilizing mild Br&#248;nsted acid without microwave irradiation was successfully applied under mild conditions. This paper introduces two methods for the 2&#8211;4 mer oligopeptides bond formation for batch reaction and flow synthesis at room temperature using organic solvents with boiling points below 100&#8201;&#176;C. This flow production process proposes this new production method to overcome the limited scale&#8208;up production by reaction device scale.







Abstract
Since the global peptide drug market demand has been predicted to increase, highly efficient and inexpensive mass scale peptides are required. However, the production process raises questions about the cost of energy input, scale&#8208;up production, raw materials, and solvents treatment. This paper introduces 2 methods for the 2&#8211;4 mer oligopeptides bond formation for batch reaction utilizing 50&#8211;100&#8197;mol% of a mild Br&#248;nsted acid under the mild condition. One of the methods has been capably adapted to flow synthesis at room temperature using organic solvents with boiling points below 100&#8201;&#176;C. The method applies the tert&#8208;butoxycarbonyl amino methoxy group, forming the desired dipeptide without solvent at mild temperatures. Furthermore, the conversion of the carboxylic acid leaving the group to phenyl ester promotes peptide bond formation, and the reaction were applied to di, tri, and tetrapeptide bond formation in excellent yield without notable racemization at ambient temperature (up to &gt;99&#8201;% yield and 99&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr). Finally, this study proposes this new production method to overcome the limited scale&#8208;up production by reaction device scale: liquid phase biomimetic catalytic peptide flow synthesis utilizing a mild Br&#248;nsted acid.

Hitting the bottleneck: For light&#8208;driven catalysis, either the first or second electron transfer or the actual catalytic turnover is the bottleneck, of which the second process is rarely studied. Here, the charge&#8208;transfer dynamics in photoexcited intermediates of a molecular photocatalyst are investigated by spectro&#8208;electrochemistry to understand the overall process and to identify deactivation channels determining the photocatalysts fate.







Abstract
To optimize light&#8208;driven catalytic processes, light&#8208;mediated multi&#8208;electron transfer dynamics in molecular dyads need to be studied and correlated with structural changes focusing on the catalytically active metastable intermediates. Here, spectro&#8208;electrochemistry has been employed to investigate the structure&#8208;dependent photoelectron transfer kinetics in catalytically active intermediates of two Ru&#8722;Rh catalysts for light&#8208;driven NAD+ reduction. The excited&#8208;state reactivity of short&#8208;lived intermediates was studied along different photoreaction pathways by resonance Raman and time&#8208;resolved transient absorption spectro&#8208;electrochemistry with sub&#8208;picosecond time resolution under operando conditions. The results demonstrate, for the first time, how the bridging ligand serves as a (multi&#8208;)electron storage structure, mediates the strength of the electronic coupling of catalytic and photocenter and impacts the targeted electron transfer as well as parasitic electron&#8208;transfer kinetics.

A truly reversed crystal growth mode in which the crystallization starts at the surface of a spherically amorphous aggregate and then proceeds towards its center is described. The fundamental function of the structure&#8208;directing agent (SDA) controlling the crystallization pathway has been uncovered. The crystallization pathway can be &#8220;switched&#8221; between classical and reversed crystal growth by tuning the concentration of the SDA. It follows the classical mechanism at a low ratio of SDA/framework elements, but turns to the reversed crystal growth at a high ratio. More information can be found in the Research Article by Q. Yue, M. Opanasenko and co&#8208;workers. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202200590).

Two dinuclear, electrochemically twofold&#8208;reduced RuRh complexes differing only in the linker chemistry between the two metal spheres are compared. Whereas the alkyne linker offers a simple trail in a flat region between the metal centers for both electrons and protons, the triazole linker, represented by a large mountain, blocks the passage of electrons between Ru and Rh. However, even in case of the mountainous triazole trail, the holes find their way between Ru and Rh. More information can be found in the Research Article by B. Dietzek&#8208;Ivan&#353;i&#263; and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202200490).

A two&#8208;component design strategy, in which a second component modulates the excited&#8208;state property of the first component, has emerged as an important method for the fabrication of high&#8208;performance organic afterglow materials under ambient conditions. Recent achievements in organic afterglow efficiency, emission lifetimes and brightness by a two&#8208;component design strategy are reviewed.







Abstract
The past several years have witnessed the tremendous development of novel chemical structures, new design strategies and intriguing applications in the field of room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) and organic afterglow materials. This Review article focuses on recent advancements of high&#8208;performance organic afterglow materials obtained by two&#8208;component design strategies such as a dopant&#8208;matrix, donor&#8211;acceptor, sensitization, and energy&#8208;transfer strategies. Based on some cutting&#8208;edge studies, organic afterglow efficiency has been largely improved, exceeding 90&#8201;% in several cases. Organic afterglow durations reach tens of seconds in phosphorescence systems and hours in donor&#8211;acceptor systems. Organic afterglow brightness outcompetes some inorganic afterglow materials in the first several seconds after ceasing excitation source. Organic afterglow colors cover the whole visible regions and extend to near&#8208;infrared regions with respectful afterglow efficiency.

     alt="Manipulation of Triplet Excited States in Two-Component Systems for High-Performance Organic Afterglow Materials"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A two-component design strategy&lt;/b&gt;, in which a second component modulates the excited-state property of the first component, has emerged as an important method for the fabrication of high-performance organic afterglow materials under ambient conditions. Recent achievements in organic afterglow efficiency, emission lifetimes and brightness by a two-component design strategy are reviewed.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The past several years have witnessed the tremendous development of novel chemical structures, new design strategies and intriguing applications in the field of room-temperature phosphorescence (RTP) and organic afterglow materials. This Review article focuses on recent advancements of high-performance organic afterglow materials obtained by two-component design strategies such as a dopant-matrix, donor&#8211;acceptor, sensitization, and energy-transfer strategies. Based on some cutting-edge studies, organic afterglow efficiency has been largely improved, exceeding 90&#8201;% in several cases. Organic afterglow durations reach tens of seconds in phosphorescence systems and hours in donor&#8211;acceptor systems. Organic afterglow brightness outcompetes some inorganic afterglow materials in the first several seconds after ceasing excitation source. Organic afterglow colors cover the whole visible regions and extend to near-infrared regions with respectful afterglow efficiency. On the basis of these achievements, researchers demonstrate promising applications of organic afterglow materials in diverse fields, which has also been reviewed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Rapid discrimination of bacterial drug resistivity by array based cross&#8208;validation using 2D&#8208;MoS2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The precise discrimination of microbes based on family, class and drug resistivity is quintessential for the early diagnosis of infectious diseases. Information about the type and strength of drug resistivity can help the analyst to prescribe the suitable antibiotic in proper dosage to completely eradicate microbes without giving them a chance to gain further resistance. Herein, we propose a sensor array based on the use of cationic two&#8208;dimensional MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;s and green fluorescence protein (GFP) as building blocks. Cationic surfaces of receptors with various functionality were suitable for tunable interaction with anionic surfaces of microbes. The array successfully discriminates six different bacteria strains. The versatile ability of the receptors to bind with the wild type as well as their corresponding ampicillin resistant strain contributed significantly towards the rapid detection with high sensitivity. The optimized array was able to classify five different types and three different extent of drug resistant variants of &lt;italic&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/italic&gt; (EC) by using bacteria cells and lysates. Finally, we have introduced the cross identification method using both bacteria cells and lysates and we found a great enhancement of detection in sensitivity and accuracy. This is the first time we are reporting this approach which can be extended to many other methods for better accuracy in array based detection.</dc:description>

         <title>A Happy Get&#8208;Together &#8211; Probing Electrochemical Interfaces by Non&#8208;Linear Vibrational Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical interfaces are key structures in energy storage and catalysis. Hence, a molecular understanding of the active sites at these interfaces, their solvation, the structure of adsorbates, and the formation of solid&#8208;electrolyte interfaces, is crucial for an in&#8208;depth mechanistic understanding of their function. Vibrational sum&#8208;frequency generation (VSFG) spectroscopy has emerged as an operando spectroscopic technique to monitor complex electrochemical interfaces due to its intrinsic interface sensitivity and chemical specificity. Thus, this review discusses the happy get&#8208;together between VSFG spectroscopy and electrochemical interfaces. Methodological approaches are discussed for answering core issues associated with the behavior of adsorbates on electrodes, the structure of solvent adlayers, the transient formation of reaction intermediates, and the emergence of solid electrolyte interphase in battery. Thereby, this review provides a critical inventory of what we believe is a highly promising avenue to bring optical spectroscopy to use in modern material research in energy conversion and storage.</dc:description>

         <title>In&#8208;situ preparation of CsPbBr3@CsPb2Br5 composite assisted with water as a highly efficient and stable catalyst for photothermal CO2 hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lead halide perovskite has triggered a lot of research due to its superior optical properties. However, halide perovskite materials have poor environmental stabilities and are easily affected by external factors such as water and heat, resulting in structural decomposion and performance failure. Contrary to this commonplace concept, here we find that CsPbBr  3  (CPB) can convert to CsPb  2  Br  5  (CP2B5) partially when meeting a small amount of water, and the CsPbBr  3  @CsPb  2  Br  5  (CPB@CP2B5) composite is synthesized by an in&#8208;situ method accordingly. The CPB@CP2B5 composite shows an enhanced catalytic performance compared with pure CPB, as well as a dramatically synergistic effect of photo and thermal for catalytic CO  2  hydrogenation. The CO production rate of CPB@CP2B5 is determined as 69 &#181;mol g  &#8208;1  h  &#8208;1  under light irradiation at 200 &#176;C, which is 156.8 and 43.4 times higher than that under pure photo (0.44 &#181;mol g  &#8208;1  h  &#8208;1  ) and pure thermal (1.59 &#181;mol g  &#8208;1  h  &#8208;1  ) condition, respectively. Meanwhile, the CPB@CP2B5 sample is also stable, which shows no significant decline in the catalytic activity during 5 cycles of repeated experiments. The probable mechanism is explored by utilizing a series of in&#8208;situ characterizations.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct C&#8208;H trifluoromethylation of (hetero)arenes in water enabled by organic photoredox&#8208;active amphiphilic nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoredox&#8208;catalyzed chemical conversions are predominantly operated in organic media to ensure good compatibility between substrates and catalysts. Yet, when conducted in aqueous media, they are an attractive, mild, and green way to introduce functional groups into organic molecules. We here show that trifluoromethyl groups can be readily installed into a broad range of organic compounds using water as the reaction medium and light as the energy source. To bypass solubility obstacles, we developed robust water&#8208;soluble polymeric nanoparticles that accommodate reagents and photocatalysts within their hydrophobic interior under high local concentrations. By taking advantage of the high excited state reduction potential of  N  &#8208;phenylphenothiazine (PTH) through UV light illumination, the direct C&#8208;H trifluoromethylation of a wide array of small organic molecules is achieved selectively with high substrate conversion. Key to our approach is slowing down the production of CF  3  radicals during the chemical process by reducing the catalyst loading as well as the light intensity, thereby improving effectiveness and selectivity of this aqueous photocatalytic method. Furthermore, the catalyst system shows excellent recyclability and can be fueled by sunlight. The method we propose here is versatile, widely applicable, energy efficient, and attractive for late&#8208;stage introduction of trifluoromethyl groups into biologically active molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Isolation of Elusive Phosphinidene&#8208;Chloroterylenes: The Heavier Cyanogen Chloride Analogues</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The elusive phosphinidene&#8208;chlorotetrylenes, [PGeCl] and [PSiCl] have been stabilized by the hetero&#8208;bileptic cyclic alkyl(amino) carbene (cAAC), N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands, and isolated in the solid state at room temperature as the first neutral monomeric species of this class with the general formulae (L)P&#8722;ECl(L&#8242;) (E = Ge,  3a  &#8208;  3c  ; E = Si,  6  ; L = cAAC; L&#8242; = NHC). Compounds  3a  &#8208;  3c  have been synthesized by the reaction of cAAC&#8208;supported potassium phosphinidenides [cAAC=PK(THF)  x  ]  n  (  1a  &#8208;  1c  ) with the adduct NHC:&#8594;GeCl  2  (  2  ). Similarly, compound  6  has been synthesized via reaction of  1a  with NHC:&#8594;SiCl  2  adduct  4  . Compounds  3a  &#8208;  3c  , and  6  have been structurally characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometric analysis. DFT calculations revealed that the heteroatom P in  3  bears two lone pairs; the non&#8208;bonding pair with 67.8% of s&#8208; and 32% of p character, whereas, the other lone pair is involved in &#960; backdonation to the C  cAAC  &#8722;N &#960;* of cAAC. The Ge atom in  3  contains a lone pair with 80% of s character and slightly involved in the &#960; backdonation to C  NHC  . EDA&#8208;NOCV analyses showed that two charged doublet fragments {(cAAC)(NHC)}  +  , and {PGeCl}  &#8722;  prefer to form one covalent electron&#8208;sharing &#963; bond, one dative &#963; bond, one dative &#960; bond, and a charge polarized weak &#960; bond. The covalent electron&#8208;sharing &#963; bond contributes to the major stabilization energy to the total orbital interaction energy of  3  , enabling the first successful isolations of this class of compounds (  3  ,  6  ) in the laboratory.</dc:description>

         <title>Targeting pathogenic DNA and RNA repeats: a conceptual therapeutic way for repeat expansion diseases</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Expansions of short tandem repeats (STRs) in the human genome cause nearly 50 neurodegenerative diseases, which are mostly inheritable, nonpreventable and incurable, posing as a huge threat to human health. Non&#8208;B DNAs formed by STRs are thought to be structural intermediates that can cause repeat expansions. The subsequent transcripts harbouring expanded RNA repeats can further induce cellular toxicity through forming specific structures. Direct targeting of these pathogenic DNA and RNA repeats has emerged as a new potential therapeutic strategy to cure repeat expansion diseases. In this conceptual review, we first introduce the roles of DNA and RNA structures in the genetic instabilities and pathomechanisms of repeat expansion diseases, then describe structural features of DNA and RNA repeats with a focus on the tertiary structures determined by X&#8208;ray crystallography and solution nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and finally discuss recent progress and perspectives of developing chemical tools that target pathogenic DNA and RNA repeats for curing repeat expansion diseases.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Inorganic metal halides play important roles in wide range of areas including fluorescence, X&#8208;ray detection, and nonlinear&#8208;optics. Herein, two new mixed alkali metal tantalum fluorides, CsKTaF  7  and CsNaTaF  7  , have been obtained based on the strategy of cations regulation in A  2  MF  7  (A represents monovalent cations and M is d  0  transition&#8208;metal cation) system by a conventional hydrothermal route. CsKTaF  7  crystallizes in the centric  Pnma  space group, while CsNaTaF  7  crystallizes in the polar  Cmc  2  1  space group and exhibits moderate and phase&#8208;matchable NLO activity. Both halides possess large optical band gaps above 5.0 eV. The crystal structure evolution, optical properties, and detailed theory calculations of these two halides were elucidated in this work.</dc:description>

         <title>Triplet&#8208;triplet Annihilation Dynamics of Naphthalene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation (TTA) of naphthalene has been investigated by using multi&#8208;reference methods along with quantum dynamics simulations. The study involves obtaining the mechanistic details of the process and understand the time evolution of nuclear wavepacket on the computed potential energy surfaces. The results suggest that the TTA is mediated by conical intersections (CIs). It is also demonstrated that the strong light&#8208;matter interaction increases the efficiency of TTA based photon upconversion.







Abstract
Triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation (TTA) is a spin&#8208;allowed conversion of two triplet states into one singlet excited state, which provides an efficient route to generate a photon of higher frequency than the incident light. Multiple energy transfer steps between absorbing (sensitizer) and emitting (annihilator) molecular species are involved in the TTA based photon upconversion process. TTA compounds have recently been studied for solar energy applications, even though the maximum upconversion efficiency of 50&#8201;% is yet to be achieved. With the aid of quantum calculations and based on a few key requirements, several design principles have been established to develop the well&#8208;functioning annihilators. However, a complete molecular level understanding of triplet fusion dynamics is still missing. In this work, we have employed multi&#8208;reference electronic structure methods along with quantum dynamics to obtain a detailed and fundamental understanding of TTA mechanism in naphthalene. Our results suggest that the TTA process in naphthalene is mediated by conical intersections. In addition, we have explored the triplet fusion dynamics under the influence of strong light&#8208;matter coupling and found an increase of the TTA based upconversion efficiency.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Triplet-triplet annihilation&lt;/b&gt; (TTA) of naphthalene has been investigated by using multi-reference methods along with quantum dynamics simulations. The study involves obtaining the mechanistic details of the process and understand the time evolution of nuclear wavepacket on the computed potential energy surfaces. The results suggest that the TTA is mediated by conical intersections (CIs). It is also demonstrated that the strong light-matter interaction increases the efficiency of TTA based photon upconversion.

         <title>Lewis Acid Assisted Br&#248;nsted Acid Catalysed Decarbonylation of Isocyanates: A Combined DFT and Experimental Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient and mild reaction protocol for the decarbonylation of isocyanates using catalytic amounts of Lewis acidic boranes is described. The electronic nature and the position of the substituents (ortho/meta/para) bound to isocyanate controls the chain length and composition of the products.







Abstract
An efficient and mild reaction protocol for the decarbonylation of isocyanates has been developed using catalytic amounts of Lewis acidic boranes. The electronic nature (electron withdrawing, electron neutral, and electron donating) and the position of the substituents (ortho/meta/para) bound to isocyanate controls the chain length and composition of the products formed in the reaction. Detailed DFT studies were undertaken to account for the formation of the mono/di&#8208;carboxamidation products and benzoxazolone compounds.

         <title>Positive Cooperativity Induced by Interstrand Interactions in Silver(I) Complexes with &#945;,&#945;&#8242;&#8208;Diimine Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Big softie: AgI ([Kr]4d10) possesses similar electronic structure to CuI ([Ar]3d10), but a larger ionic radius and increased covalency when bound to soft &#945;,&#945;&#8242;&#8208;diimine ligands. Consequently, the thermodynamic formation of unsaturated [AgI(&#945;,&#945;&#8242;&#8208;diimine)]+ complexes is favored in organic solvents. Moreover, the addition of a second bidentate ligand to give saturated pseudo&#8208;tetrahedral [AgI(&#945;,&#945;&#8242;&#8208;diimine)2]+ building blocks is driven by positive allosteric cooperativity when the ligands are decorated with terminal methyl groups.







Abstract
The allosteric positive cooperativity accompanying the formation of compact [CuI(&#945;,&#945;&#8242;&#8208;diimine)2]+ building blocks contributed to the historically efficient synthesis of metal&#8208;containing catenates and knotted assemblies. However, its limited magnitude can easily be overcome by the negative chelate cooperativity that controls the overall formation of related polymetallic multistranded helicates and grids. Despite the more abundant use of analogous dioxygen&#8208;resistant [AgI(&#945;,&#945;&#8242;&#8208;diimine)2]+ units in modern entangled metallo&#8208;supramolecular assemblies, a related thermodynamic justification was absent. Solid&#8208;state structural characterizations show the successive formation of [AgI(&#945;,&#945;&#8242;&#8208;diimine)(CH3CN)][X] and [AgI(&#945;,&#945;&#8242;&#8208;diimine)2][X] upon the stepwise reactions of &#945;,&#945;&#8242;&#8208;diimine=2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine (bpy) or 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline (phen) derivatives with AgX (X=BF4&#8722;, ClO4&#8722;, PF6&#8722;). In room&#8208;temperature, 5&#8211;10&#8197;mM acetonitrile solutions, these cationic complexes exist as mixtures in fast exchange on the NMR timescale. Spectrophotometric titrations using the unsubstituted bpy and phen ligands point to the statistical (=non&#8208;cooperative) binding of two successive bidentate ligands around AgI, a mechanism probably driven by the formation of hydrophobic belts, that overcomes the unfavorable decrease in the positive charge borne by the metallic cation. Surprisingly, the addition of methyl groups adjacent to the nitrogen donors (6,6&#8242; positions in dmbpy; 2,9 positions in dmphen) induces positive cooperativity for the formation of [Ag(dmbpy)2]+ and [Ag(dmphen)2]+, a trend assigned to additional stabilizing interligand interactions. Adding rigid and polarizable phenyl side arms in [Ag(Brdmbpy)2]+ further reinforces the positively cooperative process, while limiting the overall decrease in metal&#8211;ligand affinity.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Long Lived Luminescent Triplet Excited States in Cyclic (Alkyl)(amino)carbene Complexes of Zn(II) Halides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zinc(II) halide cAAC dimers undergo photochemically induced rearrangements in the triplet excited state, one of which involves rotation of one of the cAAC ligands giving an asymmetric dimeric structure at 77&#8197;K. Consequently, transformation of 3XCT/LE to purely 3LE states localized at the carbene lead to ultra&#8208;long lived phosphorescence (millisecond regime). At room temperature, further rearrangements are observed. Similar photoreactions occur in monomeric [ZnX2(cAAC)(MeCN)] complexes.







Abstract
The high element abundance and d10 electron configuration make ZnII&#8208;based compounds attractive candidates for the development of novel photoactive molecules. Although a large library of purely fluorescent compounds exists, emission involving triplet excited states is a rare phenomenon for zinc complexes. We have investigated the photophysical and &#8208;chemical properties of a series of dimeric and monomeric ZnII halide complexes bearing a cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene (cAAC) as chromophore unit. Specifically, [(cAAC)XZn(&#956;&#8208;X)2ZnX(cAAC)] (X=Cl (1), Br (2), I (3)) and [ZnX2(cAAC)(NCMe)] (X=Br (4), I (5)) were isolated and fully characterized, showing intense visible light photoluminescence under UV irradiation at 297&#8197;K and fast photo&#8208;induced transformation. At 77&#8197;K, the compounds exhibit improved stability allowing to record ultra&#8208;long lifetimes in the millisecond regime. DFT/MRCI calculations confirm that the emission stems from 3XCT/LEcAAC states and indicate the phototransformation to be related to asymmetric distortion of the complexes by cAAC ligand rotation. This study enhances our understanding of the excited state properties for future development and application of new classes of ZnII phosphorescent complexes.

         <title>A High&#8208;Valent Ru&#8208;PCP Pincer Catalyst for Hydrogenation of Carbonyl and Carboxyl Compounds under Molecular Hydrogen</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient hydrogenation of carbonyl and carboxyl compounds under molecular hydrogen catalyzed by a structurally well&#8208;defined high&#8208;valent RuIV catalyst is described. The catalyst exhibits better reactivity toward molecular hydrogen than the low&#8208;valent analog and allows hydrogen activation even at room temperature.







Abstract
Low&#8208;valent metals traditionally dominate the domain of catalytic hydrogenation.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Efficient hydrogenation&lt;/b&gt; of carbonyl and carboxyl compounds under molecular hydrogen catalyzed by a structurally well-defined high-valent Ru&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt; catalyst is described.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Low-valent metals traditionally dominate the domain of catalytic hydrogenation. However, metal-ligand cooperating (MLC) catalytic systems, operating through heterolytic H&#8722;H bond splitting by a Lewis acidic metal and a basic ligand site, do not require an electron-rich metal. On the contrary, high-valent metals that induce weaker back donation facilitate heterolytic bond activation. Here we report, for the first time, the efficient hydrogenation of carbonyl and carboxyl compounds under molecular hydrogen catalyzed by a structurally well-defined Ru&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt; catalyst bearing a bifunctional PCP pincer ligand. The catalyst exhibits reactivity toward molecular hydrogen superior to that of the low-valent analog and allows hydrogen activation even at room temperature.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Circularly Polarized Luminescence and Circular Dichroism of Bichromophoric Difluoroboron&#8208;&#946;&#8208;diketonates: Inversion and Enhanced Chirality Based on Spatial Arrangements and Self&#8208;Assembly</title>

         <dc:description>
Two bichromophoric difluoroboron &#946;&#8208;diketonates (DFBs) with different connections to a chiral cyclohexanediamine bridge display inversion of chirality. When using different solvent systems, para Cy&#8208;DFB shows self&#8208;assembly in spherical aggregates with enhanced chiroptical properties as compared with solution state. Ultrasonication and heating induces the formation of supramolecular assembled nanowires with higher g value of 0.015.







Abstract
We synthesized two bichromophoric difluoroboron&#8208;&#946;&#8208;diketonates (DFB) connected in para and meta positions by using cyclohexane diamine as a chiral bridge (para and meta (R/S)&#8208;CyDFB). TD&#8208;DFT calculations revealed that the variation in connectivity of the DFB units leads to different spatial arrangements and a chirality inversion of the bichromophoric DFB. Higher gabs values were obtained in (R/S)&#8208;CyDFB connected in para as compared to meta position. Aggregation of para (R/S)&#8208;CyDFB in mixture of solvents increase the glum values as compared to its monomeric form. Ultrasonication and heating induced the formation of highly ordered nano&#8208;helical wires of para (R/S)&#8208;CyDFB that increased the glum values to 0.015. On the other hand, meta (R/S)&#8208;CyDFB failed to form highly ordered self&#8208;assembled wires due to hindered H&#8208;binding sites. These observations indicate that the chiroptical properties of DFB bi&#8208;chromophore system can be modulated with self&#8208;assembly and spatial arrangement of the chromophores.

         <title>How Ionization Catalyzes Diels&#8211;Alder Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ionization of the dienophile is an effective method to enhance the Diels&#8211;Alder reaction between buta&#8208;1,3&#8208;diene and acrylaldehyde. The origin of this ionization catalysis is both a reduction in steric Pauli repulsion and simultaneous enhancement of the orbital interactions between the reactants. Our work demonstrates the similarities and differences between radical&#8211;cation and Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed Diels&#8211;Alder reactions. More information can be found in the Research Article by T.&#8197;A. Hamlin, F.&#8197;M. Bickelhaupt, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202200987).

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the efficient synthesis of a family of organoplatinum&#160;complexes, featuring a (2&#8208;([2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridin]&#8208;6&#8208;yl)phenyl)&#160;ligand, that incorporates peripheral side&#8208;chains aiming at enhancing and diversifying its interaction capabilities. These include a di&#8208;isopropyl carbamoyl amide, a morpholine ethylenamide, 2 enantiomeric proline imides and an oxazole. The binding affinities of the Pt&#8208;complexes were evaluated via UV&#8208;vis and fluorescence titrations, against 5 topologically&#8208;distinct DNA structures, including c&#8208;myc G&#8208;quadruplex, two telomeric&#160;G&#8208;quadruplexes, a duplex&#160;and a single&#8208;stranded&#160;DNA. All compounds exhibited binding selectivity in favor of c&#8208;myc, with association constants&#160;in the range of 105  M  &#8208;1  , lower affinity for both folds of 22AG and for ds26 and negligible affinity for polyT. Up to 200&#8208;fold&#160;emission enhancements upon addition of excess c&#8208;myc&#160;were demonstrated, providing a basis for optical selectivity, since optical response to other tested DNAs was low. A c&#8208;myc DNA&#8208;melting experiment showed significant stabilizing abilities, with the most potent binder&#160;exhibiting&#160;&#916;T  m  &gt;30  o  C, at 1:5 DNA&#8208;to&#8208;ligand molar ratio. This&#160;study implied contributions of the diverse side&#8208;chains to helix stabilization. To gain direct evidence of the nature of the interactions, mixtures of c&#8208;myc with the 4&#160;most promising compounds were studied via UVRR&#160;spectroscopy, which revealed end&#8208;stacking binding mode, combined with interactions of side&#8208;chains with loop nucleobases. Docking simulations provided&#160;insights into the binding modes for the Pt&#8208;compounds, suggesting that the binding preference for 2 alternative orientations of the G4&#160;thymine &#8216;cap&#8217; (&#8216;open&#8217; vs. &#8216;closed&#8217;), as well as the relative contributions to affinity from end&#8208;stacking and H&#8208;bonding, are highly dependent on the nature of the interacting side&#8208;chain.</dc:description>

         <title>Understanding of Photo&#8208;induced Reversible Rearrangement from Borepin to Borirane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first reversible photoisomerization between a borepin and a borirane was reported in the photo&#8208;induced reactions of B(npy)Ar  2  (npy=2&#8208;(naphthalen&#8208;1&#8208;yl) pyridine, Ar=phenyl or electron rich aryl). (S. Wang, et al.  Angew. Chem. Int. Ed.  2019  ,  58  , 66836687). In this work, the detailed mechanisms of the unprecedented reversible photoisomerization between the borepin (compound  a  ) and the borirane (compound  b  ) of B(npy)Ph  2  in the first excited singlet (S  1  ) state and the ground (S  0  ) state were studied by carrying out calculations with the complete active space self&#8208;consistent field (CASSCF) and its second&#8208;order perturbation (CASPT2) methods combined with time&#8208;dependent density functional theory (TD&#8208;DFT). The calculation results show that photoexcitation of  a  &#8208;S  0  at 365 nm and  b  &#8208;S  0  at 450 nm populate their S  1  state with evident charge transfer characteristics. The photoisomerization is triggered in S  1  state and ends in S  0  state, where the intersection points in a (S  1  /S  0  )  x  intersection seam participate in and promote phenyl migration and ring closure processes. Furthermore, we reveal that the not large energy difference (less than 0.6 eV) and similar conjugation properties of &#960; electrons between  a  &#8208;S  0  and  b  &#8208;S  0  are responsible for their unique photo&#8208;reversible reactivity, compared with those of the isomers of the thermally reversible compound B(ppy)Mes  2  . Our results contribute to understand the excited&#8208;state reactivity of organoboron compounds and will be useful to support the design of new boron&#8208;based photoresponsive materials.</dc:description>

         <title>On the evolutionary history of the twenty encoded amino acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract:
a&#8208;Amino acids are essential molecular constituents of life, twenty of which are privileged because they are encoded by the ribosomal machinery. The question remains open as to why this number and why this 20 in particular, an almost philosophical question that cannot be conclusively resolved. They are closely related to the evolution of the genetic code and whether nucleic acids, amino acids, and peptides appeared simultaneously and were available under prebiotic conditions when the first self&#8208;sufficient complex molecular system emerged on Earth. This report focuses on prebiotic and metabolic aspects of amino acids and proteins starting with meteorites, followed by their formation, including peptides, under plausible prebiotic conditions, and the major biosynthetic pathways in the various kingdoms of life.
Coenzymes play a key role in the present analysis in that amino acid metabolism is linked to glycolysis and different variants of the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA, rTCA, and the incomplete horseshoe version) as well as the biosynthesis of the most important coenzymes. Thus, the report opens additional perspectives and facets on the molecular evolution of primary metabolism.</dc:description>

         <title>Calibrating catalytic DNA nanostructures for site&#8208;selective protein modification</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Many biomedical fields rely on proteins that are selectively modified. These can be attached using reactive or catalytic moieties, but the position where these moieties are attached is often poorly controlled. We assessed how catalyst position affects the efficiency and selectivity of protein modification. For this, we anchored a template DNA strand to three different proteins, which were subsequently hybridized to DNA strands that contained catalysts at different positions. We found a strong correlation between the catalyst&#8208;to&#8208;protein distance and the efficiency of protein modification for acyl transfer catalysts, which operate via a covalently bound reactant intermediate. Additionally, we found that the catalyst&#8217;s distance and orientation with respect to the protein surface, also influences its site&#8208;selectivity. A catalyst operating with unbound reactant intermediates showed only enhanced efficiency. Our results are rationalized using computational simulations, showing that one&#8208;point anchoring of the DNA construct leads to notable differences in the site of modification.</dc:description>

         <title>Regulating Extra&#8208;Framework Cations in Faujasite Zeolites for Capture of Trace Carbon Dioxide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of cost&#8208;effective sorbents for direct capture of trace CO  2  (&lt;1%) from the atmosphere is an important and challenging task. Natural or commercial zeolites are promising sorbents, but their performance in adsorption of trace CO  2  has been poorly explored to date.  Herein, we report a systematic study on capture of trace CO  2  by commercial faujasite zeolites, where we found that the extra&#8208;framework cations played a key role on their performance.  Under dry conditions, Ba&#8208;X displays high dynamic uptake of 1.79 and 0.69 mmol g  &#8208;1  at CO  2  concentrations of 10000 and 1000 ppm, respectively, and shows excellent recyclability in the temperature&#8208;swing adsorption processes. K&#8208;X exhibits perfect moisture resistance, and &gt;95 % dry CO  2  uptake can be preserved under relative humidity of 74%.&#160;  In situ  solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy, synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction and neutron diffraction reveal two binding sites for CO  2  in these zeolites, namely the basic framework oxygen atoms and the divalent alkaline earth metal ions. This study unlocks the potential of low&#8208;cost natural zeolites for applications in direct air capture.</dc:description>

         <title>Single&#8208;step N&#8208;terminal modification of proteins via a bio&#8208;inspired copper(II)&#8208;mediated aldol reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The chemical modification of proteins is an effective technique for manipulating the properties and functions of proteins, and for creating protein&#8208;based materials. The N&#8208;terminus is a promising target for single&#8208;site modification that provides modified proteins with uniform structures and properties. In this paper, we propose a copper(II)&#8208;mediated aldol reaction with 2&#8208;pyridinecarboxaldehyde (2&#8208;PC) derivatives as an operationally simple method to selectively modify the N&#8208;terminus of peptides and proteins at room temperature and physiological pH. The copper(II) ion activates the N&#8208;terminal amino acids by complexation with an imine of the N&#8208;terminal amino acid and 2&#8208;PCs, realizing the selective formation of the nucleophilic intermediate at the N&#8208;terminus. This results in a stable carbon&#8208;carbon bond between the 2&#8208;PCs and the &#945;&#8208;carbon of various N&#8208;terminal amino acids.&#12288;The reaction is applied to four different proteins, including biopharmaceuticals such as filgrastim and trastuzumab. The modified trastuzumab retains the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 recognition activity.</dc:description>

The power of carboxylates: Simple carboxylate salts can rival strong amidine bases, such as DBU, in their catalytic power to isomerize &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated thioesters to corresponding conjugated &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated thioesters. The mechanism involves a rate&#8208;determining protonation step!







Abstract
We demonstrate herein the capacity of simple carboxylate salts &#8211; tetrametylammonium and tetramethylguanidinium pivalate &#8211; to act as catalysts in the isomerization of &#946;,&#947;&#8208;unsaturated thioesters to &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated thioesters. The carboxylate catalysts gave reaction rates comparable to those obtained with DBU, but with fewer side reactions. The reaction exhibits a normal secondary kinetic isotope effect (k1H/k1D=1.065&#177;0.026) with a &#946;,&#947;&#8208;deuterated substrate. Computational analysis of the mechanism provides a similar value (k1H/k1D=1.05) with a mechanism where &#947;&#8208;reprotonation of the enolate intermediate is rate determining.

         <title>Opening of the Diamondoid Cage upon Ionization Probed by Infrared Spectra of the Amantadine Cation Solvated by Ar, N2, and H2O</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cage&#8208;opening upon ionization: Three isomers of Ama+ (1&#8208;aminoadamantane) are identified by IR spectroscopy &#8208; the cage isomer (I) generated by vertical ionization and separated by substantial barriers from two bicyclic distonic iminium ions generated by cage opening (primary radical II) and subsequent 1,2 H shift (tertiary radical III). The potential energy profile for this reaction depends strongly on solvation and H&#8594;NH2 substitution.







Abstract
Radical cations of diamondoids, a fundamental class of very stable cyclic hydrocarbon molecules, play an important role in their functionalization reactions and the chemistry of the interstellar medium. Herein, we characterize the structure, energy, and intermolecular interaction of clusters of the amantadine radical cation (Ama+, 1&#8208;aminoadamantane) with solvent molecules of different interaction strength by infrared photodissociation (IRPD) spectroscopy of mass&#8208;selected Ama+Ln clusters, with L=Ar (n&#8804;3) and L=N2 and H2O (n=1), and dispersion&#8208;corrected density functional theory calculations (B3LYP&#8722;D3/cc&#8208;pVTZ). Three isomers of Ama+ generated by electron ionization are identified by the vibrational properties of their rather different NH2 groups. The ligands bind preferentially to the acidic NH2 protons, and the strength of the NH&#8230;L ionic H&#8208;bonds are probed by the solvation&#8208;induced red&#8208;shifts in the NH stretch modes. The three Ama+ isomers include the most abundant canonical cage isomer (I) produced by vertical ionization, which is separated by appreciable barriers from two bicyclic distonic iminium ions obtained from cage&#8208;opening (primary radical II) and subsequent 1,2 H&#8208;shift (tertiary radical III), the latter of which is the global minimum on the Ama+ potential energy surface. The effect of solvation on the energetics of the potential energy profile revealed by the calculations is consistent with the observed relative abundance of the three isomers.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cage-opening upon ionization&lt;/b&gt;: Three isomers of Ama&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (1-aminoadamantane) are identified by IR spectroscopy - the cage isomer (&lt;b&gt;I&lt;/b&gt;) generated by vertical ionization and separated by substantial barriers from two bicyclic distonic iminium ions generated by cage opening (primary radical &lt;b&gt;II&lt;/b&gt;) and subsequent 1,2 H shift (tertiary radical &lt;b&gt;III&lt;/b&gt;). The potential energy profile for this reaction depends strongly on solvation and H&#8594;NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; substitution.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Radical cations of diamondoids, a fundamental class of very stable cyclic hydrocarbon molecules, play an important role in their functionalization reactions and the chemistry of the interstellar medium. Herein, we characterize the structure, energy, and intermolecular interaction of clusters of the amantadine radical cation (Ama&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, 1-aminoadamantane) with solvent molecules of different interaction strength by infrared photodissociation (IRPD) spectroscopy of mass-selected Ama&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;L&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; clusters, with L=Ar (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;&#8804;3) and L=N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;=1), and dispersion-corrected density functional theory calculations (B3LYP&#8722;D3/cc-pVTZ). Three isomers of Ama&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; generated by electron ionization are identified by the vibrational properties of their rather different NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; groups. The ligands bind preferentially to the acidic NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; protons, and the strength of the NH&#8230;L ionic H-bonds are probed by the solvation-induced red-shifts in the NH stretch modes. The three Ama&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; isomers include the most abundant canonical cage isomer (&lt;b&gt;I&lt;/b&gt;) produced by vertical ionization, which is separated by appreciable barriers from two bicyclic distonic iminium ions obtained from cage-opening (primary radical &lt;b&gt;II&lt;/b&gt;) and subsequent 1,2 H-shift (tertiary radical &lt;b&gt;III&lt;/b&gt;), the latter of which is the global minimum on the Ama&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; potential energy surface. The effect of solvation on the energetics of the potential energy profile revealed by the calculations is consistent with the observed relative abundance of the three isomers. Comparison to the adamantane cation indicates that substitution of H by the electron-donating NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; group substantially lowers the barriers for the isomerization reaction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Azole&#8208;Directed Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Hydrogenation of Alkenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By the assisting promotion effect of the azolyl group itself, an efficient Co&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation of azolyl&#8208;substituted alkenes has been successfully developed for the convenient introduction of chirality near the azole ring. It was the first utilization of an azole as the directing group in Co&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation. Chiral azoles were obtained in high yields and with excellent enantioselectivities under mild conditions and the gram&#8208;scale experiment went smoothly at up to 2000 substrate/catalyst.







Abstract
The azole&#8208;directed cobalt&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation of alkenes has been developed with high efficiency. With this approach, chiral pyrazole compounds were obtained in quantitative yields and excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99&#8201;% ee) under mild conditions, and the hydrogenation was conducted on a gram scale with up to 2000 TON. Several useful applications were demonstrated including the convenient introduction of &#946;&#8208;chirality to a drug intermediate containing an azole ring.

         <title>Donor Acceptor Complexes between the Chalcogen Fluorides SF2, SeF2, SeF4 and TeF4 and an N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Donor&#8208;acceptor complexes between the carbene 1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene (IPr) and EF2 (E=S, Se) or EF4 (E=Se, Te) were conveniently synthesized. The compounds were structurally investigated by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and a suite of density functional theory (DFT) methods were employed in order to elucidate fine electronic details of the chemical environment around the central chalcogen atoms.







Abstract
The majority of binary chalcogen fluorides are fiercely reactive and extremely difficult to handle. Here, we show that access to crystalline donor&#8208;acceptor complexes between chalcogen difluorides (sulfur, selenium) and tetrafluorides (selenium, tellurium) with the N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) 1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene (IPr) is possible conveniently and safely without the need to generate the highly unstable EF2 (E=S, Se) or the very toxic and corrosive SeF4.

         <title>Pyrimidoquinazolinophenanthroline opens next chapter in design of bridging ligands for artificial photosynthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis and detailed characterization of a new Ru polypyridine complex containing a heteroditopic bridging ligand with previously unexplored metal&#8208;metal distances is presented. Due to the twisted geometry of the novel ligand, the resultant division of the ligand in two distinct subunits leads to steady state as well as excited state properties of the corresponding mononuclear Ru(II) polypyridine complex resembling those of prototype [Ru(bpy)  3  ]  2+  (bpy&#160;=&#160;2,2&#180;&#8208;bipyridine). The localization of the initially optically excited and the nature of the long&#8208;lived excited states on the Ru&#8208;facing ligand spheres is evaluated by resonance Raman and fs&#8208;TA spectroscopy, respectively, and supported by DFT and TDDFT calculations. Coordination of a second metal (Zn or Rh) to the available bis&#8208;pyrimidyl&#8208;like coordination sphere strongly influences the frontier orbitals, apparent by,  e.g.  , luminescence quenching. Thus, the new bridging ligand motif offers electronic properties which can be adjusted by the nature of the second metal center. Using the heterodinuclear Ru&#8208;Rh complex, visible light&#8208;driven reduction of NAD  +  to NADH was achieved, highlighting the potential of this system for photocatalytic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular magnetic materials based on {CoIII(Tp*)(CN)3}&#8208; cyanidometallate: combined magnetic, structural and 59Co NMR study.</title>

         <dc:description>The cyanidocobaltate of formula  fac  &#8208;PPh4[CoIII(Me2Tp)(CN)  3  ]&#183;CH  3CN (  1  ) has been used as a metalloligand to prepare polynuclear magnetic complexes (  Me2  Tp=hydrotris(3,5&#8208;dimethylpyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)borate). The association of  1  with  in situ  prepared [Fe  II  (bik)  2  (MeCN)  2  ](OTf)  2  (bik=bis(1&#8208;methylimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)ketone) leads to a molecular square of formula {[CoIII{(Me2Tp)(CN)3]2[FeII(bik)2]2}(OTf)2&#183;4MeCN&#183;2H2O (  2  ), whereas the self&#8208;assembly of  1  with preformed cluster [CoII2(OH2)(piv)4(Hpiv)4] in MeCN leads the two&#8208;dimensional network of formula {[CoII2(piv)3]2[CoIII(Me2Tp)(CN)3]2&#183;2CH3CN}  &#8734; (3). These compounds were structurally characterized via single crystal X&#8208;ray analysis and their spectroscopic (FTIR, UV&#8208;Vis and  59Co NMR) properties and magnetic behaviours were investigated. Bulk magnetic susceptibility measurements reveal that  1  is diamagnetic and  3  is paramagnetic throughout the explored temperature range, whereas  2  showcases thermally driven spin&#8208;crossover behaviour. In contrast  2  exhibits sharp spin transition centered at  ca.  292 K . Compound  2  also exhibits photomagnetic effects at low temperature, selective light irradiations allowing to promote reversibly and repeatedly low&#8208;spin &#8660; high&#8208;spin conversion. Besides, the diamagnetic nature of the Co(III) building block allows us studying these compounds by means of  59  Co NMR spectroscopy. Here  59  Co chemical shift has been used as a magnetic probe to corroborate experimental magnetic data obtained from bulk magnetic susceptibility measurements. An influence of the magnetic state of the neighbouring atoms is observed on the  59  Co NMR signals. Moreover, for the very first time,  59  Co NMR technique has been successfully introduced to investigate molecular materials with distinct magnetic properties.</dc:description>

Several transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free dehalogenative, dehydrogenative borylation, cyclization and alkyne activation approaches for the formation of highly valuable heterocyclic carbon&#8208;boron bond are reviewd.







Abstract
Heteroaryl boronic acids and esters are extremely important and valuable intermediates because of their wide application in the synthesis of marketed drugs and bioactive compounds. Over the last couple of decades, the construction of highly important heteroaryl carbon&#8208;boron bonds has created huge attention. The transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free protocols are more green, less sensitive to air and moisture, and also economically advantageous over the transition&#8208;metal&#8208;based protocols. The transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free C&#8722;H borylation of heteroarenes and C&#8722;X (X=halogen) borylation of heteroaryl halides represents an excellent approach for their synthesis. Also, various cyclization and alkyne activation protocols have been recently established for their synthesis. The goal of this review article is to summarize the existing literature and the current state of the art for transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free synthesis of heteroaryl boronic acid and esters.

         <title>[2.2]&#8208; and [3.3]Paracyclophane as Bridging Units in Organic Dyads for Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Dye&#8208;Sensitized Hydrogen Production</title>

Through&#8208;space type photocatalyst: Novel donor&#8208;acceptor dyads containing [2.2]&#8208; and [3.3]paracyclophane as the bridging moiety were synthesized and used to effectively fabricate dye&#8208;sensitized hydrogen production systems. The optimal turnover number hydrogen production showed as high as 28.2. The through&#8208;space type photoinduced dye&#8208;sensitized hydrogen production systems using PCP skeleton was examined for the first time.







Abstract
Novel donor&#8211;acceptor dyads containing [2.2]&#8208; and [3.3]paracyclophane (PCP) as the bridging moiety were synthesized and used to effectively fabricate dye&#8208;sensitized hydrogen production systems. All the prepared compounds had a phenothiazine and a cyanoacrylic acid/pyridinyl acrylonitrile moiety acting as an electron donor and acceptor, respectively. Although cyclic voltammetry measurements showed similar electron&#8208;donating properties among all the synthesized dyads, the lowest absorption energy of the [2.2]PCP moiety was lower than that of the [3.3]PCP one; this was due to its shorter distance between benzene rings, which could effectively drive the charge transfer between the donor and acceptor chromophores. Under visible light (&gt;395&#8197;nm), a dyad&#8208;loaded photocatalyst in a 0.5&#8197;M aqueous glycerol solution generated detectable hydrogen gases. The optimal turnover number and photocurrent order exhibited the same trend as the hydrogen production rate since the suggested number of excited photons played a critical role in hydrogen production.

         <title>Advances towards Cell&#8208;Specific Gene Transfection: A Small&#8208;Molecule Approach Allows Order&#8208;of&#8208;Magnitude Selectivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

Picky for cancer cells: A small&#8208;molecule transfection vector containing a strong DNA binder and a targeting moiety shows low toxicity and a tenfold selectivity for cell lines expressing biotin receptors (BR). The binder contains the tailor&#8208;made guanidinocarbonypyrrol (GCP) motif. A tetrapeptide of only four GCP&#8208;modified lysine residues is usually sufficient to achieve transfection. Addition of an appropriate linker deactivates the vector. Further attachment of a biotin label allowed BR&#8208;rich cancer cell lines to be targeted.







Abstract
A transfection vector that can home in on tumors is reported. Whereas previous vectors that allow moderately cell selective gene transfection used larger systems, this small&#8208;molecule approach paved the way for precise structure&#8208;activity relationship optimization. For this, biotin, which mediates cell selectivity, was combined with the potent DNA&#8208;binding motif tetralysine&#8208;guanidinocarbonypyrrol via a hydrophilic linker, thus enabling SAR&#8208;based optimization. The new vector mediated biotin receptor (BR)&#8208;selective transfection of cell lines with different BR expression levels. Computer&#8208;based analyses of microscopy images revealed a preference of one order of magnitude for the BR&#8208;positive cell lines over the BR&#8208;negative controls.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Carbonylative Cross&#8208;Coupling of Alkyl Iodides and Amines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general copper&#8208;catalyzed carbonylative cross&#8208;coupling between amines and alkyl iodides based on a simple combination of catalytic CuCl and PMDETA in the presence of NaOH is reported. Primary, secondary and tertiary alkyl iodides and primary, cyclic and acyclic secondary amines as well as anilines were all shown to be suitable reaction partners, affording the corresponding amides in good to excellent yields. Mechanistic studies demonstrated that a radical pathway is operative and the key role of carbon monoxide.







Abstract
A general copper&#8208;catalyzed carbonylative cross&#8208;coupling between amines and alkyl iodides is reported. Using a simple combination of catalytic amounts of copper(I) chloride and N,N,N&#8217;,N&#8221;,N&#8221;&#8208;pentamethyldiethylenetriamine in the presence of sodium hydroxide under carbon monoxide pressure, a broad range of alkyl iodides and amines can be efficiently coupled to the corresponding amides that are obtained in good to excellent yields. Notable features of this process &#8211; the first one relying on a base metal catalyst &#8211; include the availability and low cost of the catalytic system, its successful use with primary, secondary, tertiary alkyl iodides and all classes of amines &#8211; with no or limited competing nucleophilic substitution without CO incorporation &#8211; as well as its efficiency with complex alkyl iodides and amines. Mechanistic studies demonstrated that a radical pathway is operative and the key role of CO.

         <title>An Expedient Method for the Umpolung Coupling of Enols with Heteronucleophiles
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A useful strategy: Herein, we report an umpolung strategy mediated by a hypervalent iodine(III) reagent for the functionalization of enol derivatives with different heteronucleophiles including carboxylic acids, thiols, alcohols, primary and secondary amines, azides and carbamates generated from CO2. Relevant examples for the derivatization of natural products and pharmaceutical compounds are also presented. The mechanism of the reaction was investigated by DFT calculations and experimental studies.







Abstract
In this paper, we present an unprecedented and general umpolung protocol that allows the functionalization of silyl enol ethers and of 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds with a large range of heteroatom nucleophiles, including carboxylic acids, alcohols, primary and secondary amines, azide, thiols, and also anionic carbamates derived from CO2. The scope of the reaction also extends to carbon&#8208;based nucleophiles. The reaction relies on the use of 1&#8208;bromo&#8208;3,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1&#955;3[d][1,2]iodaoxole, which provides a key &#945;&#8208;brominated carbonyl intermediate. The reaction mechanism has been studied experimentally and by DFT, and we propose formation of an unusual enolonium intermediate with a halogen&#8208;bonded bromide.

         <title>Redox&#8208;Induced Structural Change in Artificial Heterometallic&#8208;Oxide Cluster Mimicking the Photosynthetic Oxygen&#8208;Evolving Center</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The oxygen&#8208;evolving center (OEC) in photosynthesis is a unique Mn  4  CaO  5  &#8208;cluster that catalyzes the water&#8208;splitting reaction in nature. Understanding its catalytic mechanism for the O=O bond formation is of great challenge and long&#8208;standing issue, which is severely restricted by the lack of precise structure and mechanism mimics of this heterometallic&#8208;oxide cluster. Herein, we report two synthetic (Mn  3  XO  4  )  2  O&#8208;clusters (X = Sr  2+  , La  3+  ) that closely mimic the heterometallic&#8208;oxide Mn  3  XO  4  cubane and three different types of &#956;&#8208;oxide bridges (  &#956;  2  &#8208;O  2  &#8208;  ,  &#956;  3  &#8208;O  2  &#8208;  , and  &#956;  4  &#8208;O  2  &#8208;  ) simultaneously as seen in the OEC. By resolving the crystal structures of both oxidized and reduced forms of the cluster, we have identified significant redox&#8208;induced structural changes that take place on the &#956;  2  &#8208;oxide bridge, rather than the  &#956;  4  &#8208;oxide or  &#956;  3  &#8208;oxide bridges. Our results provide chemical insights into understanding the reactivity of three different types of oxide bridges in the biological Mn  4  CaO  5  &#8208;cluster in PSII.</dc:description>

         <title>Surface Engineering of Conjugated Polybenzothiadiazoles and Integration with Cobalt Oxides for Photocatalytic Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Conjugated polymers feature promising structure and properties for photocatalytic water splitting. Herein, a hydrolysis strategy was demonstrated to rationally modulate the surface hydrophilicity and band structures of conjugated polybenzothiadiazoles. High hydrophilicity not only enhances the dispersions of polymeric solids in an aqueous solution but also reduces the absorption energy of water molecules. Besides, both theoretical and experimental results reveal that a more positive valence band potential is generated, which contributes to enhancing the photocatalytic water oxidation performance. Accordingly, the surface&#8208;modified conjugated polymers show largely promoted photocatalytic water oxidation activities by deposition of cobalt oxides as cocatalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Online reaction monitoring with fast and flow&#8208;compatible diffusion NMR spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Online monitoring by flow NMR spectroscopy is a powerful approach to study chemical reactions and processes, which can provide mechanistic understanding, and drive optimisations. However, some of the most useful methods for mixture analysis and reaction monitoring are not directly applicable in flow conditions. This is the case of classic diffusion&#8208;ordered NMR spectroscopy (DOSY) methods, which can be used to separate the spectral information for mixture&#8217;s components. We describe a fast and flow compatible diffusion NMR experiment, that makes it possible to collect accurate diffusion data for samples flowing at up to 3 mL/min. We use it to monitor the synthesis of a Schiff base with a flow&#8208;tube with a time resolution of approximately 2 minutes. The one&#8208;shot flow&#8208;compatible diffusion NMR described here open many avenues for reaction monitoring applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Geometrically Mismatched Hydrogen&#8208;bonded Framework Composed of Tetratopic Carboxylic Acid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Porous organic frameworks possessing interactive free sites in the pore have attracted much attention due to their potential to show the site&#8208;originated specific functionalities. Herein, we demonstrate that such a framework could be constructed using a concept of geometrically mismatched frameworks composed of phenanthroline&#8208;based tetratopic carboxylic acid  CP&#8208;Phen  . Simple recrystallization of  CP&#8208;Phen  yielded a solvent included porous framework  CP&#8208;Phen&#8208;1  , in which three of four carboxy groups form hydrogen&#8208;bonded dimer to form a ladder&#8208;shaped framework, while the remained one does not participate in framework formation due to geometrical mismatch and interacts with solvent molecules through weak hydrogen&#8208;bonding. This result implies that our proposed strategy is effective to provide free interactive sites in porous frameworks. Although  CP&#8208;Phen&#8208;1  undergoes two&#8208;step structural transformation accompanied by hydrogen&#8208;bond rearrangements upon loss of solvent molecules, the activate framework shows good thermal stability up to 360 &#176;C and selective CO  2  adsorption.</dc:description>

         <title>Four&#8208;Step Spin Crossover in a New Cyano&#8208;Bridged Iron&#8208;Silver Coordination Polymer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new guest&#8208;free Hofmann clathrate analogue Fe(2&#8208;ethoxypyrazine)2{Ag(CN)2}2 which undergoes a four&#8208;step spin crossover during the transition from the low&#8208;spin to the high&#8208;spin state is reported. At the first step 1/3 of centers become high spin, at the second step another 1/3 of centres become high spin, at the third step spin mixed crystallographic centres are observed, and after the fourth step all centers are high spin.







Abstract
Spin&#8208;crossover complexes with multistep transitions attract much attention due to their potential applications as multi&#8208;switches and for data storage. A four&#8208;step spin crossover is observed in the new iron(II)&#8208;based cyanometallic guest&#8208;free framework compound Fe(2&#8208;ethoxypyrazine)2{Ag(CN)2}2 during the transition from the low&#8208;spin to the high&#8208;spin state. A reverse process occurs in three steps. Crystallographic studies reveal an associated stepwise evolution of the crystal structures. Multiple transitions in the reported complex originate from distinct FeII sites which exist due to the packing of the ligand with a bulky substituent.

         <title>Recent Advances in the Synthesis and Biological Applications of Peptidoglycan Fragments</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Peptidoglycan, the material comprising the cell wall of bacteria, remains an attractive but complex synthetic target for enzymologists and immunologists. This review encompasses the various modern synthetic organic and chemoenzymatic routes for the formation of molecular peptidoglycan and the derivatives thereof: muramyl dipeptides, Park nucleotides, peptidoglycan lipids, and peptidoglycan fragments.







Abstract
The biosynthesis, breakdown, and modification of peptidoglycan (PG) play vital roles in both bacterial viability and in the response of human physiology to bacterial infection. Studies on PG biochemistry are hampered by the fact that PG is an inhomogeneous insoluble macromolecule. Chemical synthesis is therefore an important means to obtain PG fragments that may serve as enzyme substrates and elicitors of the human immune response. This review outlines the recent advances in the synthesis and biochemical studies of PG fragments, PG biosynthetic intermediates (such as Park's nucleotides and PG lipids), and PG breakdown products (such as muramyl dipeptides and anhydro&#8208;muramic acid&#8208;containing fragments). A rich variety of synthetic approaches has been applied to preparing such compounds since carbohydrate, peptide, and phospholipid chemical methodologies must all be applied.

         <title>A Catalyst and Solvent Free Route for the Synthesis of N&#8208;Substituted Pyrrolidones from Levulinic Acid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work offers a simple methodolgy to avoid solvents and added catalysts for the synthesis of different kinds of N&#8208;substituted pyrrolidones. Different aniline derivatives with varying steric and electronic demands, aliphatic amines and benzyl amines were responsive to this methodology. The method was also modified for the synthesis of industrially important &#947;&#8208;valerolactone. Control experiments and DFT studies have also been carried out to find out the possible mechanistic pathway.







Abstract
An efficient, metal&#8208;free, catalyst&#8208;free and solvent&#8208;free methodology for the reductive amination of levulinic acid with different anilines has been developed using HBpin as the reducing reagent. This protocol offers an excellent method to avoid solvents and added catalysts on the synthesis of different kinds of N&#8208;substituted pyrrolidones under metal free conditions. It is also the first report for the synthesis of different pyrrolidones by solvent&#8208;free as well as catalyst&#8208;free methods. The proposed mechanism for the formation of pyrrolidone has been supported by DFT calculations and control experiments.

         <title>Dihydroxy&#8208;Acid Dehydratases From Pathogenic Bacteria: Emerging Drug Targets to Combat Antibiotic Resistance</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The FeS cluster&#8208;dependent dihydroxy&#8208;acid dehydratases (DHADs) from Staphylococcus aureus and Campylobacter jejuni (SaDHAD and CjDHAD) are emerging targets for biocides.

There is an urgent global need for the development of novel therapeutics to combat the rise of various antibiotic&#8208;resistant superbugs. Enzymes of the branched&#8208;chain amino acid (BCAA) biosynthesis pathway are an attractive target for novel anti&#8208;microbial drug development. Dihydroxy&#8208;acid dehydratase (DHAD) is the third enzyme in the BCAA biosynthesis pathway. It relies on an Fe&#8722;S cluster for catalytic activity and has recently also gained attention as a catalyst in cell&#8208;free enzyme cascades. Two types of Fe&#8722;S clusters have been identified in DHADs, i.e. [2Fe&#8722;2S] and [4Fe&#8722;4S], with the latter being more prone to degradation in the presence of oxygen. Here, we characterise two DHADs from bacterial human pathogens, Staphylococcus aureus and Campylobacter jejuni (SaDHAD and CjDHAD). Purified SaDHAD and CjDHAD are virtually inactive, but activity could be reversibly reconstituted in vitro (up to &#8764;19,000&#8208;fold increase with kcat as high as &#8764;6.7&#8197;s&#8722;1). Inductively&#8208;coupled plasma&#8208;optical emission spectroscopy (ICP&#8208;OES) measurements are consistent with the presence of [4Fe&#8722;4S] clusters in both enzymes. N&#8208;isopropyloxalyl hydroxamate (IpOHA) and aspterric acid are both potent inhibitors for both SaDHAD (Ki=7.8 and 51.6&#8197;&#956;M, respectively) and CjDHAD (Ki=32.9 and 35.1&#8197;&#956;M, respectively). These compounds thus present suitable starting points for the development of novel anti&#8208;microbial chemotherapeutics.

         <title>C&#8722;X Bond Activation by Palladium: Steric Shielding versus Steric Attraction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bulk up! Our computational study shows how increasing steric bulk at the C&#8722;X bond systematically decreases the bond strength along the series C(0&#176;)&#8722;X to C(1&#176;)&#8722;X to C(2&#176;)&#8722;X to C(3&#176;)&#8722;X. These weaker C&#8722;H and C&#8722;C bonds are not always more reactive in oxidative addition reactions with palladium catalysts. Instead, we illustrate the interplay between steric repulsion across the C&#8722;X bond versus that of the catalyst and substrate.







Abstract
The C&#8722;X bond activation (X = H, C) of a series of substituted C(n&#176;)&#8722;H and C(n&#176;)&#8722;C(m&#176;) bonds with C(n&#176;) and C(m&#176;) = H3C&#8722; (methyl, 0&#176;), CH3H2C&#8722; (primary, 1&#176;), (CH3)2HC&#8722; (secondary, 2&#176;), (CH3)3C&#8722; (tertiary, 3&#176;) by palladium were investigated using relativistic dispersion&#8208;corrected density functional theory at ZORA&#8208;BLYP&#8208;D3(BJ)/TZ2P. The effect of the stepwise introduction of substituents was pinpointed at the C&#8722;X bond on the bond activation process. The C(n&#176;)&#8722;X bonds become substantially weaker going from C(0&#176;)&#8722;X, to C(1&#176;)&#8722;X, to C(2&#176;)&#8722;X, to C(3&#176;)&#8722;X because of the increasing steric repulsion between the C(n&#176;)&#8208; and X&#8208;group. Interestingly, this often does not lead to a lower barrier for the C(n&#176;)&#8722;X bond activation. The C&#8722;H activation barrier, for example, decreases from C(0&#176;)&#8722;X, to C(1&#176;)&#8722;X, to C(2&#176;)&#8722;X and then increases again for the very crowded C(3&#176;)&#8722;X bond. For the more congested C&#8722;C bond, in contrast, the activation barrier always increases as the degree of substitution is increased. Our activation strain and matching energy decomposition analyses reveal that these differences in C&#8722;H and C&#8722;C bond activation can be traced back to the opposing interplay between steric repulsion across the C&#8722;X bond versus that between the catalyst and substrate.

         <title>Dibenzophenazine&#8208;Based TADF Emitters as Dual Electrochromic and Electroluminescence Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The change of donors in CT&#8208;based molecules significantly influences the charge carrier generation and follow&#8208;up reactions that affect the TADF emitter&#8216;s stability. The TADF emitters can be easily electropolymerised, forming stable conjugated polymers. Electrochemically active TADF emitters possess significant electrochromic properties and can be used as both electrochromic and electroluminescence materials. The dual behaviour of the TADF emitters allows use in both OLED and Electrochromic Windows applications.







Abstract
Previous work has reported the synthesis of donor&#8211;acceptor&#8211;donor molecules based on dibenzophenazine acceptor group, presenting thermally activated delayed fluorescent (TADF) properties and their application in the assembly of highly efficient electroluminescent devices. Herein, we focus on the characterisation of charge carrier species through UV&#8208;Vis&#8208;NIR spectroelectrochemical and potentiostatic EPR techniques, in addition to the investigation of electropolymerisation properties of some compounds depicted in this study. The promising electrochromic features of both small molecules and conjugated polymers led to the assembly and investigation of electrochromic devices, evidencing the materials&#8217; versatility, applied in such different approaches as electrochromic windows and electroluminescent devices. Furthermore, the assembled OLEDs provided high efficiencies, with small roll&#8208;off, EQEs up to 20.5&#8201;% and luminance values up to 85 000 cd/m2.

         <title>Electrochemical Behaviour and Chemical Species of Sm(II) in AlCl3&#8208;NaCl with Different Lewis Acidity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sm(II) diffuses faster with the increase of Lewis acidity of AlCl3&#8208;NaCl, which is due to the different coordination circumstance of Sm(II). With the Lewis acidity increase, the anions involved in Sm(II) complexation gradually range from Cl&#8722; to AlCl4&#8722; and Al2Cl7&#8722;. The difference of complex structure is also reflected in the in&#8197;situ UV&#8208;Vis absorption spectrum.







Abstract
AlCl3&#8208;NaCl was utilized as an electrolyte in this work due to its low melting point and Lewis acidity, in which samarium exists in two oxidation states, Sm(III) and Sm(II), resulting in unique electrochemical behaviours. Sm metal dissolves in AlCl3&#8208;NaCl melt to form SmCl2, which is verified by electrochemical and spectroscopic techniques. As the Lewis acidity of the melt increases, the diffusion coefficient of Sm(II) gradually increases, and the activation energy of diffusion decreases. Moreover, an additional co&#8208;reduction peak of Sm3+ and AlCl4&#8722; is observed to be more positive than that of Al(0)/Al(III) in Lewis basic melt, which may be tightly correlated with the variation of Sm(II) coordination in AlCl3&#8208;NaCl melt and ligand variation from Cl&#8722; to AlCl4&#8722; and Al2Cl7&#8722; as the Lewis acidity of the AlCl3&#8208;NaCl melt increases, according to the in&#8197;situ electronic absorption spectra of Sm in this melt.

         <title>Rh(III)&#8208;Catalyzed One&#8208;Step Synthesis of ortho&#8208;Alkynylated Perylene Imide Dyes: Optical and Electrochemical Properties of New Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports the first one&#8208;step synthesis of alkynylated perylene diimides, monoimides and alkynylated naphthalene monoimides through a Rh&#8208;catalyzed site&#8208;selective ortho&#8208;C&#8722;H alkynylation. This not only increases the step economy of the ortho&#8208;functionalization on these dyes but also provides a quick access route towards highly functionalized dyes that have potential optoelectronic applications. Additionally, we have also explored optical properties of ortho&#8208;functionalized perylene diimide (PDI) and perylene monoimide (PMI) and compared the results obtained from the steady&#8208;state, time&#8208;resolved and circular voltammetry in both solution and solid&#8208;state. We also estimated the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of PDI, PMI and their derivatives using cyclic voltammetry and UV&#8208;onset, respectively. The highly electron&#8208;deficient character (lower LUMO energy level) along with their significant quantum yield in the solid&#8208;state, make these PDI and PMI derivatives very strong and potential candidates for applications in optoelectronic devices like solar cells.







Abstract
A one&#8208;step Rh&#8208;catalyzed site&#8208;selective ortho&#8208;C&#8722;H alkynylation of perylene as well as naphthalene mono&#8208; and diimides is reported. A single step regioselective access to ortho&#8208;C&#8722;H alkynylated derivatives of these ryleneimides not only increases the step economy of the ortho&#8208;functionalization on these dyes but also provides a quick access route towards highly functionalized dyes that have potential optoelectronic applications. Increased solubility of tetra(triisopropylsilyl)acetylenyl PDIs in organic solvents greatly enhances their utility for further derivatization.

         <title>Design Concepts of Transition Metal Dichalcogenides for High&#8208;Performance Aqueous Zn&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are widely investigated as cathodes for aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) due to their facile 2D Zn&#8208;ion transport channels and weak electrostatic interactions with Zn2+. This concept article discusses the latest design strategies of TMDs cathodes for high&#8208;performance AZIBs from the aspects of Zn&#8208;storage mechanism optimization, interlayer expansion, phase transition, and structure defects creation.







Abstract
Aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) are considered as promising large&#8208;scale energy storage devices due to their high safety and low cost. Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) as the potential aqueous Zn&#8208;storage cathode materials are under the research spotlight because of their facile 2D ion&#8208;transport channels and weak electrostatic interactions with Zn2+. In this concept article, we summarize the intrinsic structural features and aqueous Zn&#8208;storage mechanisms of the TMDs&#8208;based electrodes. More significantly, the latest design concepts of TMDs materials for high&#8208;performance AZIBs are discussed in detail from three aspects of interlayer expansion engineering, phase transition engineering, and structure defects engineering. Finally, the current challenges facing TMDs cathodes and possible remedies are outlined for future developments towards efficient, rapid, and stable aqueous Zn&#8208;ion storage.

         <title>Redox&#8208;Switchable Complexes Based on Nanographene&#8208;NHCs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanographene&#8208;functionalized NHC ligand was prepared and coordinated to rhodium an iridium. The presence of a perylene&#8208;diimide moiety in the ligand allows that the resulting complexes show redox&#8208;switching properties in the [3+2] cycloaddition of diphenylcyclopropenone and methylphenylacetylene.







Abstract
A series of rhodium and iridium complexes with a N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligand decorated with a perylene&#8208;diimide&#8208;pyrene moiety are described. Electrochemical studies reveal that the complexes can undergo two successive one&#8208;electron reduction events, associated to the reduction of the PDI moiety attached to the NHC ligand. The reduction of the ligand produces a significant increase on its electron&#8208;donating character, as observed from the infrared spectroelectrochemical studies. The rhodium complex was tested in the [3+2] cycloaddition of diphenylcyclopropenone and methylphenylacetylene, where it displayed a redox&#8208;switchable behavior. The neutral complex showed moderate activity, which was suppressed when the catalyst was reduced.

         <title>Single&#8208;Molecule Sensing of Acidic Catecholamine Metabolites Using a Programmable Nanopore</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three acidic catecholamine metabolites, including 3,4&#8208;dihydroxymandelic acid (DHMA), 3&#8208;methoxy&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxymandetic acid (VMA) and 3,4&#8208;dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) were investigated by PNRSS. DHMA, which contains an &#945;&#8208;hydroxycarboxylate moiety (red shade, marked as 1) and an adjacent cis&#8208;hydroxyl groups on the benzene ring (blue shade, marked as 2), reports two binding modes (PBA&#8208;1 and PBA&#8208;2) simultaneously resolvable by PNRSS, demonstrating a high resolution of PNRSS. A custom machine learning algorithm was also developed to achieve automatic event classification.







Abstract
Acidic catecholamine metabolites, which could serve as diagnostic markers for many diseases, demonstrate an importance of accurate sensing. However, they share a highly similar chemical structure, which is a challenge in the design of sensing strategies. A nanopore may be engineered to sense these metabolites in a single molecule manner. To achieve this, a recently developed programmable nano&#8208;reactor for stochastic sensing (PNRSS) technique adapted with a phenylboronic acid (PBA) adaptor was applied. Three acidic catecholamine metabolites, including 3,4&#8208;dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), 3,4&#8208;dihydroxymandelic acid (DHMA) and 3&#8208;methoxy&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxymandetic acid (VMA) were investigated by PNRSS. Specifically, DHMA, which contains an &#945;&#8208;hydroxycarboxylate moiety and an adjacent cis&#8208;hydroxyl groups on its benzene ring, reports two binding modes simultaneously resolvable by PNRSS. Assisted with the high resolution of PNRSS, direct regulation of these two binding modes by pH can also be observed. A custom machine learning algorithm was also developed to achieve automatic event classification.

         <title>Layered Uranyl Phosphonates Encapsulating Co(II)/Mn(II)/Zn(II) Ions: Exfoliation into Nanosheets and Its Impact on Magnetic and Luminescent Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Layered heterometallic uranyl phosphonates [(UO2)3M(2&#8208;pmbH)4(H2O)4]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H2O [MU, M=Co(II), CoU; Mn(II), MnU; Zn(II), ZnU] can be exfoliated into nanosheets with single/two&#8208;layer thickness (MU&#8208;ns). Comparing to the bulk crystalline samples, the aggregates of nanosheets exhibited significant differences in magnetic dynamics (for CoU) and photoluminescence (for ZnU).







Abstract
Layered heterometallic 5f&#8211;3d uranyl phosphonates can exhibit unique luminescent and/or magnetic properties, but the fabrication and properties of their 2D counterparts have not been investigated. Herein we report three heterobimetallic uranyl phosphonates, namely, [(UO2)3M(2&#8208;pmbH)4(H2O)4]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H2O [MU, M=Co(II), CoU; Mn(II), MnU; Zn(II), ZnU; 2&#8208;pmbH3=2&#8208;(phosphonomethyl)benzoic acid]. They are isostructural and display two&#8208;dimensional layered structures where the M(II) centers are encapsulated inside the windows generated by the diamagnetic uranyl phosphonate layer. Each M(II) has an octahedral geometry filled with four water molecules in the equatorial positions and two phosphonate oxygen atoms in the axial positions. The uranium atoms adopt UO7 pentagonal bipyramidal and UO6 square bipyramidal geometries. The lattice and coordination water molecules can be released by thermal treatment and reabsorbed in a reversible manner, accompanied with changes of magnetic dynamics. Interestingly, the bulk samples of MU can be exfoliated in acetone via freezing and thawing processes forming nanosheets with single&#8208;layer or two&#8208;layer thickness (MU&#8208;ns). Magnetic studies revealed that the CoU and MnU systems exhibited field&#8208;induced slow magnetization relaxation at low temperature. Compared with crystalline CoU, the magnetic relaxation of the CoU&#8208;ns aggregates is significantly accelerated. Moreover, photoluminescence measured at 77&#8197;K showed slight red&#8208;shift of the five characteristic uranyl emission bands for ZnU&#8208;ns in comparison with those of the crystalline ZnU. This work gives the first examples of 2D materials based on 5f&#8211;3d heterometallic uranyl phosphonates and illustrates the impact of dimension reduction on their magnetic/optical properties.

&lt;p&gt;Layered heterometallic uranyl phosphonates [(UO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;M(2-pmbH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O [&lt;b&gt;MU&lt;/b&gt;, M=Co(II), &lt;b&gt;CoU&lt;/b&gt;; Mn(II), &lt;b&gt;MnU&lt;/b&gt;; Zn(II), &lt;b&gt;ZnU&lt;/b&gt;] can be exfoliated into nanosheets with single/two-layer thickness (&lt;b&gt;MU-ns&lt;/b&gt;). Comparing to the bulk crystalline samples, the aggregates of nanosheets exhibited significant differences in magnetic dynamics (for &lt;b&gt;CoU&lt;/b&gt;) and photoluminescence (for &lt;b&gt;ZnU&lt;/b&gt;).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Layered heterometallic 5f&#8211;3d uranyl phosphonates can exhibit unique luminescent and/or magnetic properties, but the fabrication and properties of their 2D counterparts have not been investigated. Herein we report three heterobimetallic uranyl phosphonates, namely, [(UO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;M(2-pmbH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O [&lt;b&gt;MU&lt;/b&gt;, M=Co(II), &lt;b&gt;CoU&lt;/b&gt;; Mn(II), &lt;b&gt;MnU&lt;/b&gt;; Zn(II), &lt;b&gt;ZnU&lt;/b&gt;; 2-pmbH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;=2-(phosphonomethyl)benzoic acid]. They are isostructural and display two-dimensional layered structures where the M(II) centers are encapsulated inside the windows generated by the diamagnetic uranyl phosphonate layer. Each M(II) has an octahedral geometry filled with four water molecules in the equatorial positions and two phosphonate oxygen atoms in the axial positions. The uranium atoms adopt UO&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; pentagonal bipyramidal and UO&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; square bipyramidal geometries. The lattice and coordination water molecules can be released by thermal treatment and reabsorbed in a reversible manner, accompanied with changes of magnetic dynamics. Interestingly, the bulk samples of &lt;b&gt;MU&lt;/b&gt; can be exfoliated in acetone via freezing and thawing processes forming nanosheets with single-layer or two-layer thickness (&lt;b&gt;MU-ns&lt;/b&gt;). Magnetic studies revealed that the &lt;b&gt;CoU&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;MnU&lt;/b&gt; systems exhibited field-induced slow magnetization relaxation at low temperature. Compared with crystalline &lt;b&gt;CoU&lt;/b&gt;, the magnetic relaxation of the &lt;b&gt;CoU-ns&lt;/b&gt; aggregates is significantly accelerated. Moreover, photoluminescence measured at 77&#8197;K showed slight red-shift of the five characteristic uranyl emission bands for &lt;b&gt;ZnU-ns&lt;/b&gt; in comparison with those of the crystalline &lt;b&gt;ZnU&lt;/b&gt;. This work gives the first examples of 2D materials based on 5f&#8211;3d heterometallic uranyl phosphonates and illustrates the impact of dimension reduction on their magnetic/optical properties.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Improvement of Visible&#8208;Light H2 Evolution Activity of Pb2Ti2O5.4F1.2 Photocatalyst by Coloading of Rh and Pd Cocatalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced H2 evolution activity of a Pb2Ti2O5.4F1.2 photocatalyst was found to be sensitive to the loaded metal cocatalyst. Although Rh was the most effective single&#8208;metal cocatalyst among the tested metals, the activity of Rh/Pb2Ti2O5.4F1.2 was further improved by coloading of Pd because it reinforced the ability of Rh to capture photogenerated electrons from Pb2Ti2O5.4F1.2.







Abstract
Pb2Ti2O5.4F1.2 modified with various metal cocatalysts was studied as a photocatalyst for visible&#8208;light H2 evolution. Although unmodified Pb2Ti2O5.4F1.2 showed negligible activity, modification of its surface with Rh led to the best observed promotional effect among the Pb2Ti2O5.4F1.2 samples modified with a single metal cocatalyst. The H2 evolution activity was further enhanced by coloading with Pd; the Rh&#8722;Pd/Pb2Ti2O5.4F1.2 photocatalyst showed 3.2 times greater activity than the previously reported Pt/Pb2Ti2O5.4F1.2. X&#8208;ray absorption fine&#8208;structure spectroscopy, photoelectrochemical, and transient absorption spectroscopy measurements indicated that the coloaded Rh and Pd species, which were partially alloyed on the Pb2Ti2O5.4F1.2 surface, improved the electron&#8208;capturing ability, thereby explaining the high activity of the coloaded Rh&#8722;Pd/Pb2Ti2O5.4F1.2 catalyst toward H2 evolution.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single atom catalysts (SACs) have emerged as a new frontier in catalysis area such as electrocatalysis, photocatalysis, and enzymatic catalysis. Aided by recent advances in synthetic methodologies of nanomaterials, atomic characterization technologies, and theoretical calculation modeling, various of SACs have been prepared for a variety of catalytic reactions. To meet the requirements of SACs with distinctive performance and appreciable selectivity, many researches have been carried out to adjust the coordination configuration and electronic properties of SACs. This concept summarizes the latest advances in the experimental and computational efforts aimed at tuning the axial coordination of the SACs. Series of atoms, functional groups or even macrocycle molecules are oriented introduced into the atomic metal center, and how this affects the electrocatalytic performance are also reviewed. Finally, this concept presents perspectives for further precise design, preparation and in situ detection of axial coordinated SACs.</dc:description>

         <title>Tetrathienyl corannulene compounds with highly sensitive photochromism</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We designed and synthesized photochromic tetrathienyl corannulene compounds, 1,2,7,8&#8208;tetrakis(2&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;5&#8208;phenylthiophen&#8208;3&#8208;yl)corannulene (  1  ) and 1,2,7,8&#8208;tetrakis(2,4&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;5&#8208;phenylthiophen&#8208;3&#8208;yl)corannulene (  2  ), by fusing two units of photochromic terarylene with a curved aromatic corannulene with a promising antenna effect. The compound  1  exhibited highly sensitive photoreactivity with a large molar absorption coefficient of 8.2 &#215; 10  4  M  &#8211;1  cm  &#8211;1  and practically photon&#8208;quantitative photocyclization. On the other hands, terarylene derivatives with a planar aromatic phenanthrene, 9,10&#8208;bis(2,4&#8208;methyl&#8208;5&#8208;phenylthiophen&#8208;3&#8208;yl)phenanthrene (  4  ) showed no photoreactivity. The reason for such a difference was attributed to the predominance of the photoreactive atropisomers amplified with energy migration and the shortened distance between reactive carbons induced by curved structure.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective oxidations using a cytochrome P450 enzyme variant driven with surrogate oxygen donors and light</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cytochrome P450 monooxygenase enzymes are versatile catalysts which have been adapted for multiple applications in chemical synthesis. Mutation of a highly conserved active site threonine to a glutamate can convert these enzymes into peroxygenases that utilise hydrogen peroxide (H  2  O  2  ). Here we use the T252E&#8208;CYP199A4 variant to study peroxide driven oxidation activity using H  2  O  2  and urea&#8208;hydrogen peroxide (UHP). We demonstrate that the T252E variant has a higher stability to H  2  O  2  in the presence of substrate that can undergo carbon&#8208;hydrogen abstraction. This peroxygenase variant could efficiently catalyse  O  &#8208;demethylation and an enantioselective epoxidation reaction (94% e.e.). Neither the monooxygenase nor peroxygenase pathways of the P450 demonstrated a significant kinetic isotope effect (KIE) for the oxidation of deuterated substrates. These new peroxygenase variants offer the possibility of simpler cytochrome P450 systems for selective oxidations. To demonstrate this, a light driven H  2  O  2  generating system was used to support efficient product formation with this peroxygenase enzyme.</dc:description>

         <title>When Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission Meets Perovskites: Efficient Defect&#8208;Passivation and Charge&#8208;Transfer for Ambient Fabrication of Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, incorporating donor&#8208;acceptor structured AIE molecule (TPE&#8208;TCF) into the perovskite precursor solution can improve the morphology of perovskite film and suppress nonradiative carrier recombination, leading to perovskite solar cells with reduced trap density and negligible hysteresis. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of TPE&#8208;TCF&#8208;treated PSCs achieved a remarkably enhanced from 15.63 to 19.66&#8201;% with high charge transport and defects passivation under air condition without a glovebox.







Abstract
The intrinsic defects in perovskite film can serve as non&#8208;radiative recombination center to limit the performance and stability of metal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The additive engineering in perovskite film is always applied to produce high&#8208;efficiency PSCs in recent years. Here, a typical donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8722;A) structured aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) molecule tetraphenylethene&#8208;2&#8208;dicyano&#8208;methylene&#8208;3&#8208;cyano&#8208;4,5,5&#8208;trimethyl&#8208;2,5&#8208;dihydrofuran (TPE&#8208;TCF) was introduced into perovskite film. The D&#8722;A structure of TPE&#8208;TCF molecule provided additional charge transfer channels, contributing to transporting electron of TPE&#8208;TCF&#8208;based device. The cyano (C&#8801;N) of TPE&#8208;TCF can interact with the uncoordinated Pb to from a relatively stable intermediate, PbI2&#8901;TPE&#8208;TCF, resulting in the slower crystal growth, reduced the defects at the grain boundaries and suppressed carrier recombination. As a consequence, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of TPE&#8208;TCF&#8208;modified PSCs achieved a remarkably enhanced from 15.63 to 19.66&#8201;% with negligible hysteresis, which was prominent in methylammonium lead iodide&#8208;based devices fabricated under ambient condition. Furthermore, the PSCs modified by AIE molecule possessed an outstanding stability and maintain about 86&#8201;% of the initial PCE after 300&#8197;h storage in air at 25&#8211;35&#8201;&#176;C with a high relative humidity (RH) of &#8776;85&#8201;%. This work suggests that incorporating AIE molecule into perovskite is a promising strategy for facilitating high&#8208;performance PSCs commercialization in ambient environment without glovebox.

         <title>Layered Oxide Cathodes Promoted by Crystal Regulation Strategies for Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Layered oxide cathodes have demonstrated great potential for potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs) on account of high reversible capacity, appropriate diffusion paths, and low cost. However, their electrochemical performance in PIBs is generally worse than that in lithium&#8208;ion batteries due to large structural changes and deformations during charging and discharging. To improve their potassium storage performance, a series of strategies have been developed in recent studies. In this review, we summarize the latest advancements in layered oxide cathodes for PIBs through different crystal regulation strategies, including transition metal layer doping, potassium content optimization, oxygen partial substitution, functional morphology construction and air stability improvement. Meanwhile, the relationship between the electrochemical properties and structural evolution of these modified cathodes is also investigated. In addition, the challenges and prospects of these layered oxide cathodes in PIBs are analyzed in detail, providing constructive insights for future applications of PIBs.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks: Functionalized Construction Strategy by Nitrogen&#8208;Containing Functional Group</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strategies and applications of nitrogen&#8208;containing functional groups to construct hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF) materials: selectivity of pore modification effects of nitrogen&#8208;containing functional groups in gas adsorption separation and guest recognition applications, nitrogen&#8208;modification of framework to promote HOFs for sensing applications in optics, and biocompatibility of nitrogen&#8208;containing functional groups to advance the biomedical field of HOF materials.







Abstract
The construction of hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework materials by intermolecular hydrogen bonding forces has been rapidly developed in the last decade, among which, the strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding and functional binding sites exhibited by nitrogen&#8208;containing functional groups have made them favorites for designing organic components to customize functionalized porous materials. This review systematically introduces the types of nitrogen&#8208;containing monomers used to prepare porous hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic backbones and the principles of their construction, summarizes the design advantages of crystalline materials from an elemental perspective, and presents the applications of such HOFs in the fields of gas adsorption/separation, molecular recognition, plasmonic conductivity, biomedical, and luminescent materials, etc. Finally, the prospects for the development of such materials are discussed and potential directions for future work are analyzed.

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Detergent Expansion Strategy for Membrane Protein Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
T&#8208;PADs for membrane proteins: A library of 1,2,3&#8208;triazole preassembled detergents (T&#8208;PADs) was constructed two&#8208;dimensionally by click chemistry, exhibiting high diversity with systematic tuning of properties for accommodating distinct membrane proteins. High throughput screening of this detergent library was carried out to explore best matches between detergents and membrane proteins. Among them, structurally unique and unprecedented detergents 14M8G and 14M9G were identified for the EM and NMR study of individual membrane proteins, respectively.







Abstract
Detergents are the most frequently applied reagents in membrane protein (MP) studies. The limited diversity of one&#8208;head&#8208;one&#8208;tailed traditional detergents, however, is far from sufficient for structurally distinct MPs. Expansion of detergent repertoire has a continuous momentum. In line with the speculation that detergent pre&#8208;assembly exerts superiority, herein we report for the first time cross&#8208;conjugation of two series of monomeric detergents for constructing a two&#8208;dimensional library of dimeric detergents. Optimum detergents stood out with unique preferences in the systematic evaluation of individual MPs. Furthermore, unprecedented hybrid detergents 14M8G and 14M9G enabled high&#8208;quality EM study of transporter MsbA and NMR study of G protein&#8208;coupled receptor A2AAR, respectively. Given the abundance of cross&#8208;coupling chemistries, comprehensive diversity could be readily covered that would facilitate the finding of new detergents for the manipulation of thorny MPs and innovation of the functional and structural study in future.

         <title>Reductive Elimination at Pb(II) Center of an (Amino)plumbylene&#8208;Substituted Phosphaketene: New Pathway for Phosphinidene Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stable (amino)plumbylene&#8208;substituted phosphaketene was synthesized by the successive reactions of PbCl2 with two anionic reagents (lithium amidophosphine and NaPCO). Of particular interest, its thermal evolution, initiated at 80&#8201;&#176;C, starts with reductive elimination at the PbII center to form a new N&#8722;P bond and leads to the generation of a transient (amino)phosphaketene, which is the precursor of a new cyclic (amino)phosphanylidene phosphorane. This result provides a new synthetic route to phosphinidenes, extending and facilitating further their access.







Abstract
A stable (amino)plumbylene&#8208;substituted phosphaketene 3 was synthesized by the successive reactions of PbCl2 with two anionic reagents (lithium amidophosphine and NaPCO). Of particular interest, the thermal evolution of 3, at 80&#8201;&#176;C, leads to the transient formation of corresponding amino&#8208; and phosphanylidene&#8208;phosphaketenes (6 and 7), via a reductive elimination at the PbII center forming new N&#8722;P and P&#8722;P bonds. Further evolution of 6 gives a new cyclic (amino)phosphanylidene phosphorane 4, which shows a unique reactivity as a phosphinidene. This result provides a new synthetic route to phosphinidenes, extending and facilitating further their access.

         <title>Color&#8208;Tunable Multifunctional Excited&#8208;State Intramolecular Proton Transfer Emitter: Stimulated Emission of a Single Dye</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single 2&#8208;(2&#8217;&#8208;hydroxyphenyl)benzothiazole derivative is capable of precisely tunable triple&#8208;emission, covering the whole visible spectrum (red&#8208;green&#8208;blue). Excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) phenomenon was utilized to fabricate multifunctional active material for lasing action both in solutions and in thin polymeric films. For the first time, light amplification in deprotonated ESIPT species was observed, enabling real&#8208;time shifting of the stimulated emission by almost 100&#8197;nm (from orange to green).







Abstract
The excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer chromophores were regarded as good materials for laser action generation due to their inherent four&#8208;level photocycle. The excitation&#8208;dependent properties of these compounds enable light amplification from two distinct forms: both enol and keto, making it possible to obtain dual fluorescence emission. Herein, we report that a third option is possible for the first time stimulated emission was realized with a deprotonated ESIPT molecule based on a novel rigidified 2&#8208;(2&#8217;&#8208;hydroxyphenyl)benzothiazole derivative, triggering the possibility to fabricate real&#8208;time tunable active material. Through the rational engineering of the ratio of each emissive species, a red&#8208;green&#8208;blue device was fabricated with the possibility of white light generation. The degenerated two&#8208;wave mixing setup was applied to construct a continuously tunable distributed feedback laser.

         <title>Tailoring the NIR&#8208;II Photoluminescence of Single Thiolated Au25 Nanoclusters by Selective Binding to Proteins
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sometimes what glisters is gold: We have succeeded in incorporating a single atomically precise gold nanocluster (Au25) inside bovine serum albumin (BSA) protein. A striking increase in Au25&#8208;BSA NIR&#8208;II photoluminescence is observed compared to that from Au25. The results reveal an intricate role of protein rigidification and the involvement of the surface state in the generation of NIR&#8208;II emissions.







Abstract
Atomically precise gold nanoclusters are a fascinating class of nanomaterials that exhibit molecule&#8208;like properties and have outstanding photoluminescence (PL). Their ultrasmall size, molecular chemistry, and biocompatibility make them extremely appealing for selective biomolecule labeling in investigations of biological mechanisms at the cellular and anatomical levels. In this work, we report a simple route to incorporate a preformed Au25 nanocluster into a model bovine serum albumin (BSA) protein. A new approach combining small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering and molecular modeling provides a clear localization of a single Au25 within the protein to a cysteine residue on the gold nanocluster surface. Attaching Au25 to BSA strikingly modifies the PL properties with enhancement and a redshift in the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) window. This study paves the way to conrol the design of selective sensitive probes in biomolecules through a ligand&#8208;based strategy to enable the optical detection of biomolecules in a cellular environment by live imaging.

You can&#8242;t separate this couple: One of the azo&#8208;substituted tripycenes synthesized in this work is highlighted in front of its UV&#8208;Vis absorption spectrum. Even though the azobenzenes are separated by a sp3 center, they experience excitonic coupling, as illustrated by the lightning. More information can be found in the Research Article by H.&#8197;A. Wegner and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202200972). Design by Felix Bernt.

         <title>Cucurbit[7]uril Inhibits Islet Amyloid Polypeptide Aggregation by Targeting N&#8197;Terminus Hot Segments and Attenuates Cytotoxicity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) self&#8208;assembly is responsible for the decline of pancreatic &#946;&#8208;cells, which is implicated in type II diabetes. The macrocyclic host, cucurbit[7]uril (CB[7]), effectively inhibits IAPP aggregation through ion&#8211;dipole and hydrophobic interactions with different residues of the monomeric peptide in its primary random&#8208;coil conformation. Most importantly, CB[7] rescues rat insulinoma cells (a robust pancreatic &#946;&#8208;cell model) from IAPP&#8208;assembly&#8208;associated cytotoxicity. More information can be found in the Research Article by D. Maity, A.&#8197;D. Hamilton, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202200456).

         <title>Striking Size and Doping Effects of Ti&#8208;Si&#8208;O Clusters on Methane Conversion Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The size and doping effects in methane activation by Ti&#8208;Si&#8208;O clusters have been explored by using a combination of gas&#8208;phase experiments and quantum chemical calculations. All      [Ti  m  Si  n  O  2(m+n)  ]  &#8226;+    (m + n = 2, 3, 8, 10, 12, 14)   clusters can extract a hydrogen from methane. The associated energies and structures have been revealed in detail. Moreover, the doping and size effects have been discussed involving Generalized Kohn&#8208;Sham energy decomposition analysis, Natural Population Analysis, Wiberg bond indexes (WBI), molecular polarity index (MPI) and ionization potential (IP). It suggested that Ti&#8208;Si&#8208;O clusters with a low Ti:Si ratio is beneficial to adsorbing methane and inclination to the Hydrogen Atom Transfer (HAT) process, while the clusters with a high Ti:Si ratio favors the generation of a terminal oxygen radical and results in high reactivity and turnover frequency. On the other hand, a cluster size of m + n= 12 is recommended considering both the ionization potential and the turnover frequency of the reaction. Hopefully, these finding will be instructive for the design of high&#8208;performance Ti&#8208;Si&#8208;O catalyst toward methane conversion.</dc:description>

         <title>The key role of a&#8208;top CO on terrace sites of metallic Pd clusters for CO oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pd&#8208;based catalysts are the most widely used for CO oxidation because of their outstanding catalytic activity and thermal stability. However, the fundamental understanding of the detailed catalytic processes on Pd&#8208;based catalysts under realistic conditions is still not fully understood. In this study, we investigated CO oxidation on metallic Pd clusters supported on Al  2  O  3  and SiO  2  . High&#8208;angle annular dark&#8208;field scanning transmission electron microscopy revealed a similar average size of Pd clusters on Al  2  O  3  and SiO  2  . In contrast, CO chemisorption exhibits gradual changes in dispersion (0.79 to 0.2) on Pd/Al  2  O  3  and a marginal change in dispersion (0.4 to 0.24) for Pd/SiO  2  as the Pd loading increases from 0.27 to 5.5 wt%, which is attributed to the difference in the metal&#8208;support interaction. Diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier&#8208;transform spectroscopy experiments revealed that Pd supported on Al  2  O  3  exhibited a relatively lower a&#8208;top CO than Pd supported on SiO  2  , which is related to the morphological differences in metallic Pd clusters between these two supports. Despite the different dispersion profiles and surface characteristics of Pd, O  2  titration on CO&#8208;saturated Pd on Al  2  O  3  and SiO  2  demonstrated that linearly bound CO at 2090 cm  &#8208;1  reacted first with oxygen, which suggests that this a&#8208;top CO on terrace site plays an important role in CO oxidation. This experimental observation was elucidated by periodic density functional calculations, which confirmed that CO oxidation is most plausible both kinetically and thermodynamically on terrace (111) sites compared to edge or corner sites. We believe the finding in this work will helps the fundamental understanding of the effect of Pd on CO oxidation under the reaction conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Bistriazoles connected through a B&#8208;B bridge, synthesized by highly Selective Dipolar Cycloaddition Reactions of a Diazido&#8208;diborane(4)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work we report the first cycloaddition reactions between a diazido diborane(4) and terminal alkynes, providing unique access to bis&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazoles connected by a B&#8208;B bridge. The catalyst&#8208;free reactions are highly selective, yielding exclusively the thermodynamically disfavored bis&#8208;1,4&#8208;triazoles. The reactions are enabled by the high thermal stability of the diazido&#8208;diborane [B(hpp)(N  3  )]  2  (hpp = 1,3,4,6,7,8&#8209;hexahydro&#8208;2  H  &#8208;pyrimido[1,2&#8208;&#945;]pyrimidinate). Due to the tetra&#8208;coordinate boron atoms in this reagent, the reactions are tolerant with respect to the introduction of Lewis&#8208;basic groups at the alkyne. The scope and limitations of the new reactions are discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic Activation of Imines by Chalcogen Bond Donors in a&#160;Povarov [4+2] Cycloaddition Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently, chalcogen bonding has been investigated in more detail in organocatalysis and the scope of activated functionalities continues to increase. Herein, the activation of imines in a Povarov [4+2] cycloaddition reaction with bidentate cationic chalcogen bond donors is presented. Tellurium&#8208;based Lewis acids show superior properties compared to selenium&#8208;based catalysts and inactive sulfur&#8208;based analogues. The catalytic activity of the chalcogen bonding donors increases with weaker binding anions. Triflate, however, is not suitable due to its participation in the catalytic pathway. A solvent screening revealed a more efficient activation in less polar solvents and a pronounced effect of solvent (and catalyst) on  endo:exo  diastereomeric ratio. Finally, new chiral chalcogen bonding catalysts were applied but provided only racemic mixtures of the product.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanistic and Kinetic Investigations of ON/OFF (photo)switchable Binding of Carbon Monoxide by Chromium(0), Molybdenum(0) and Tungsten(0) Carbonyl Complexes with a Pyridyl&#8208;Mesoionic Carbene Ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This work tackles the photochemistry of a series of mononuclear Cr(0), Mo(0) and W(0) carbonyl complexes containing a bidentate mesoionic carbene ligand of the 1,2,3&#8208;triazol&#8208;5&#8208;ylidene type. FTIR spectroscopy, combined with density functional theory calculations, reveals a clean photo&#8208;induced reaction in organic solvents (acetonitrile, pyridine, valeronitrile) to mainly one photoproduct with monosubstitution of a carbonyl ligand for a solvent molecule. The highest photodissociation quantum yields are reached for the Cr(0) complex under UV irradiation (266 nm). Based on previous investigations, the kinetics of the dark reverse reactions are now determined, with reaction times of up to several hours in pyridine. Photochemical studies in solid state (KBr matrix, frozen solution) also show light&#8208;induced reactivity with stabilization of the metastable intermediate with a free coordination site at very low temperature. The identified reactive species emphasizes a mechanism without ligand&#8208;sphere reorganization.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, a SnCl4 &#8208;catalyzed intramolecular, interrupted homo&#8208;Nazarov cascade biscyclization to access angular (hetero)aryl&#8208;fused polycycles is reported. Subsequent decarboxylation of the readily enolizable products afforded the angular products in up to 71% yield over two steps, with the trans&#8208;diastereomers as the major products. The cyclopropyl homo&#8208;Nazarov cyclization precursors were formed using a scalable and modular synthetic route that, ultimately, offers access to 6,6,6&#8208;, 6,6,5&#8208;, 6,5,6&#8208;, 6,6,5,6&#8208;, and 6,6,6,5&#8208;fused angular polycyclic products.

         <title>General Designing Strategy of Anti&#8208;aromatic Porphyrinoids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A systematic investigation to arrange the typical anti&#8208;aromatic porphyrinoids in sequence was performed. Based on density functional theory calculations, six rules are summarized to obtain the high&#8208;performance anti&#8208;aromatic porphyrinoids: (1) when two atoms are deleted/added on the 18p electron current ring flowing pipe, we will immediately obtain a 16p/20p electron anti&#8208;aromatic system; (2) it is a good idea to increase the number of pyrrol/thiophen/furan units on the p electron current ring flowing pipe; (3) the hetroatom selecting order is &#8208;O&#8208; (optimal choice), &#8208;NH&#8208; (second choice), and &#8208;S&#8208; (last choice); (4) it is worth noting that the C&#8208;C=C&#8208;C unit is not beneficial for the anti&#8208;aromatic properties; (5) it is very significant to avoid the crowded environment in the core space of an anti&#8208;aromatic molecule. In this view, &#8208;O&#8208; is much better than &#8208;S&#8208; and &#8208;NH&#8208;; (6) the &#8220;circular&#8221; skeleton is much better than an &#8220;ellipse&#8208;like&#8221;, &#8220;rectangular&#8221;, or &#8220;parallelogram&#8208;like&#8221; one.</dc:description>

         <title>Cyclic Disulfide Liposomes for Membrane Functionalization and Cellular Delivery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Liposomes are effective therapeutic delivery nanocarriers due to their ability to encapsulate and enhance the pharmacokinetic properties of wide&#8208;ranging therapeutics. Two primary areas in which improvement is needed for liposomal drug delivery is to enhance the ability to infiltrate cells and to easily functionalize the liposome surface. Herein, we report a liposome platform incorporating a cyclic disulfide lipid (CDL) for the dual purpose of enhancing cell entry and functionalizing the liposome membrane through thiol&#8208;disulfide exchange. In order to accomplish this,  CDL&#8208;1  and  CDL&#8208;2  , composed of lipoic acid (LA) or asparagusic acid (AA) appended to a lipid scaffold, were designed and synthesized. A fluorescence&#8208;based microplate immobilization assay was implemented to show that these compounds enable convenient membrane decoration through reaction with thiol&#8208;functionalized small molecules. Additionally, fluorescence microscopy experiments indicated dramatic enhancements in cellular delivery when CDLs were incorporated within liposomes. These results demonstrate that multifunctional CDLs serve as an exciting liposome system for surface decoration and enhanced cellular delivery.</dc:description>

         <title>Impact of Fluoroalkyl Substituents on Physicochemical Properties of Saturated Heterocyclic Amines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Profiling of the physicochemical properties (p  K  a  ,  log  P  , and aqueous solubility) of fluoroalkyl&#8208;substituted heterocyclic amines was done to facilitate their rational application in medicinal chemistry research. The corresponding features of fluorine&#8208;containing compounds were compared to the parent non&#8208;fluorinated hetero&#173;cycles and the corresponding fluorinated  n  &#8208;alkylamines. Amine basicity was observed to change in a monotonic fashion depending on the fluorination pattern. Although the introduction of fluoroalkyl groups had complex effects on lipophilicity and aqueous solubility of the compounds, possible contributions of the fluorination pattern, ring size, and conformational fixation of the substituent in the ring were addressed for a series of derivatives. The summarized data provides a useful guideline for application of fluorinated motifs for fine&#8208;tuning the compound&#8217;s properties related to drug discovery.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Perfluoroalkylation of C&#8722;H Bonds in (Hetero)arenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Perfluoroalkylated (hetero)arenes represent an extremely important family of molecules. Among all methods available for their preparation, the direct perfluoroalkylation of C(sp2)&#8722;H bonds in (hetero)arenes is the most attractive and straightforward one, provided that it proceeds with high levels of regioselectivity. In this review article, a comprehensive overview of advances in this field is presented, with a special focus on the reaction mechanisms involved in these transformations and their regioselectivity.







Abstract
Perfluoroalkylated (hetero)arenes represent an extremely important family of molecules commonly utilized in many areas such as medicinal chemistry, agrochemistry and material sciences. Due to their unique properties, they have attracted significant interest from synthetic chemists and various methods have been developed for their synthesis. Among them, the direct perfluoroalkylation of C(sp2)&#8722;H bonds in (hetero)arenes is one of the most attractive and straightforward ones, provided that it proceeds with high levels of regioselectivity. In this review article, a comprehensive overview of advances in this field is presented, with a special focus on the reaction mechanisms involved in these transformations and their regioselectivity. All methods available have been classified according to the nature of the perfluoroalkyl chain introduced, trifluoromethylation reactions being overviewed in a separate section, and to the nature of the reagents/catalysts required.

         <title>Halogenation and Nucleophilic Quenching: Two Routes to E&#8722;X Bond Formation in Cobalt Triple&#8208;Decker Complexes (E=As, P; X=F, Cl, Br, I)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rooting out new routes: Halogenation of the neutral compound [(Cp&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;Co)2(&#956;,&#951;2&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;2&#8208;As2)2] leads to cationic species containing a cyclic As4X ligand (X=I, Br, Cl). The same cation can be obtained when a nucleophilic halide source such as KI is used to &#8221;quench&#8220; the Lewis acidity of an oxidised starting material, the dication [(Cp&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;Co)2(&#956;,&#951;4&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;4&#8208;As4)]2+. Extended to Pn ligand complexes, this new approach allows the formation of products containing P&#8722;F bonds without the use of stronger fluorinating reagents such as XeF2.







Abstract
The oxidation of [(Cp&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;Co)2(&#956;,&#951;2&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;2&#8208;E2)2] (E=As (1), P (2); Cp&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;=1,2,4&#8208;tri(tert&#8208;butyl)cyclopentadienyl) with halogens or halogen sources (I2, PBr5, PCl5) was investigated. For the arsenic derivative, the ionic compounds [(Cp&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;Co)2(&#956;,&#951;4&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;4&#8722;As4X)][Y] (X=I, Y=[As6I8]0.5 (3&#8201;a), Y=[Co2Cl6&#8208;nIn]0.5 (n=0, 2, 4; 3&#8201;b); X=Br, Y=[Co2Br6]0.5 (4); X=Cl, Y=[Co2Cl6]0.5 (5)) were isolated. The oxidation of the phosphorus analogue 2 with bromine and chlorine sources yielded the ionic complexes [(Cp&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;Co)2(&#956;&#8208;PBr2)2(&#956;&#8208;Br)][Co2Br6]0.5 (6&#8201;a), [(Cp&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;Co)2(&#956;&#8208;PCl2)2(&#956;&#8208;Cl)][Co2Cl6]0.5 (6&#8201;b) and the neutral species [(Cp&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;Co)2(&#956;&#8208;PCl2)(&#956;&#8208;PCl)(&#956;,&#951;1&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;1&#8208;P2Cl3] (7), respectively. As an alternative approach, quenching of the dications [(Cp&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;Co)2(&#956;,&#951;4&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;4&#8208;E4)][TEF]2 (TEF=[Al{OC(CF3)3}4]&#8722;, E=As (8), P (9)) with KI yielded [(Cp&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;Co)2(&#956;,&#951;4&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;4&#8208;As4I)][I] (10), representing the homologue of 3, and the neutral complex [(Cp&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;Co)(Cp&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;CoI2)(&#956;,&#951;4&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;1&#8208;P4)] (11), respectively. The use of [(CH3)4N]F instead of KI leads to the formation of [(Cp&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;Co)2(&#956;&#8208;PF2)(&#956;,&#951;2&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;1&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;1&#8208;P3F2)] (12) and 2, thereby revealing synthetic access to polyphosphorus compounds bearing P&#8722;F groups and avoiding the use of very strong fluorinating reagents, such as XeF2, that are difficult to control.

         <dc:description>
Asymmetric 1,2&#8208;carbamoyl rearrangement of chiral 2&#8208;alkenyl oxazolidine carbamates were investigated. These rearrangements provided &#945;&#8208;hydroxy amide derivatives with excellent diastereoselectivity and in good to excellent isolated yields. The substrate scope of the reaction was examined with a variety of 2&#8208;alkenyl and benzyl oxazolidine carbamates. The observed high degree of diastereoselectivity was rationalized using a stereochemical model.







Abstract
Asymmetric 1,2&#8208;carbamoyl rearrangement of lithiated 2&#8208;alkenyl carbamates has been investigated. Deprotonation of chiral 2&#8208;alkenyl oxazolidine carbamates with sec&#8208;butyllithium in ether at &#8722;78&#8201;&#176;C followed by warming of the resulting 1&#8208;lithio&#8208;2&#8208;alkenyl derivatives to room temperature resulted in 1,2&#8208;carbamoyl rearrangement to provide &#945;&#8208;hydroxy amides. The rearrangement proceeded with excellent diastereoselectivity and in good to excellent isolated yield of the &#945;&#8208;hydroxy amide derivatives. The substrate scope of the reaction was investigated with a variety of 2&#8208;alkenyl and benzyl oxazolidine carbamates. A stereochemical model is provided to explain the stereochemical outcome associated with the rearrangement. Acid&#8208;catalyzed removal of the chiral oxazolidine afforded &#945;&#8208;hydroxy acid in high optical purity.

         <title>Pressure Effects on 3dn (n=4, 9) Insulating Compounds: Long Axis Switch in Na3MnF6 not Due to the Jahn&#8208;Teller Effect</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By means of first principles calculations, this work shows that the usual explanation for the long axis switch induced by pressure in low symmetry compounds containing 3dn (n=4, 9) ions, i.&#8201;e., the Jahn&#8208;Teller effect, cannot be considered since in the parent phase the symmetry constraints are not fulfilled. However, the reported results for Na3MnF6 reveal that the pressure&#8208;induced switch arises from the anisotropic response of the low symmetry lattice to hydrostatic pressure, leading to a change of the electronic wavefunction.







Abstract
The pressure&#8208;induced switch of the long axis of MnF63&#8722; units in the monoclinic Na3MnF6 compound and Mn3+&#8208;doped Na3FeF6 is explored with the help of first principles calculations. Although the switch phenomenon is usually related to the Jahn&#8208;Teller effect, we show that, due to symmetry reasons, it cannot take place in 3dn (n=4, 9) systems displaying a static Jahn&#8208;Teller effect. By contrast, we prove that in Na3MnF6 the switch arises from the anisotropic response of the low symmetry lattice to hydrostatic pressure. Indeed, while the long axis of a MnF63&#8722; unit at ambient pressure corresponds to the Mn3+&#8722;F3&#8722; direction, close to the crystal c axis, at 2.79&#8197;GPa the c axis is reduced by 0.29&#8197;&#197; while b is unmodified. This fact is shown to force a change of the HOMO wavefunction favoring that the long axis becomes the Mn3+&#8722;F2&#8722; direction, not far from crystal b axis, after the subsequent relaxation process. The origin of the different d&#8208;d transitions observed for Na3MnF6 and CrF2 at ambient pressure is also discussed together with changes induced by pressure in Na3MnF6. The present work opens a window for understanding the pressure effects upon low symmetry insulating compounds containing d4 or d9 ions.

         <title>Muon Spin Rotation/Resonance (&#181;SR) for Studying Radical Reactivity of Unsaturated Organophosphorus Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The positive muon (  &#181;  +  ) can be regarded as a light isotope of proton and has been an important tool to study radical reactions of organic compounds. Recently, muons have been applied to produce short&#8208;lived paramagnetic species from the heavier unsaturated organic molecules including the p&#8208;block elements. This article overviews recent muon spin resonance/rotation (&#181;SR) studies on the phosphorus analogs of alkenes, anthracenes, and cyclobutane&#8208;1,3&#8208;diyls together with the fundamentals of &#181;SR. The acyclic phosphaalkene of P=C and phosphasilenes of P=Si can accept muonium (Mu = [  &#181;  +  e  &#8211;  ]) at the heavier double bonds, and the corresponding radicals have been characterized. The phosphorus atom in 9&#8208;phosphaanthracene, whose P=C double bond is stabilized by the  peri  &#8208;substituted CF  3  groups, predominantly captures muonium to provide the corresponding paramagnetic fused heterocyclic system. The  peri&#8208;  trifluoromethyl groups are functional to promote the unprecedented light isotope effect of muon providing the planar three&#8208;cyclic molecular structure to consume the increased zero&#8208;point energy. The formally open&#8208;shell singlet 1,3&#8208;diphosphacyclobutane&#8208;2,4&#8208;diyl unit can accept muonium at the (ylidic) phosphorus or the skeletal radicalic carbon, and the corresponding paramagnetic phosphorus heterocycles can be characterized by &#181;SR. The findings on these muoniation processes to the unsaturated phosphorus&#8208;containing compounds will contribute not only to development of novel paramagnetic functional species but also to progress on muon science.</dc:description>

         <title>[2+3] Amide Cages by Oxidation of [2+3] Imine Cages &#8208; Revisiting Molecular Hosts for Highly Efficient Nitrate Binding</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The pollution of groundwater with nitrate is a serious issue because nitrate can cause several diseases such as methemoglobinemia or cancer. Therefore, selective removal of nitrate by efficient binding to supramolecular hosts is highly desired. Here we describe how to make [2+3] amide cages in very high to quantitative yields by applying an optimized Pinnick oxidation protocol for the conversion of corresponding imine cages. By NMR titration experiments of the eight different [2+3] amide cages with nitrate, chloride and hydrogen sulfate we identified one cage with an unprecedented high selectivity towards nitrate binding vs chloride (  S  = 705) or hydrogensulfate (  S  &gt;13500) in CD  2  Cl  2  /CH  3  CN (1:3). NMR experiments as well as single&#8208;crystal structure comparison of host&#8208;guest complexes give insight into structure&#8208;property&#8208;relationships.</dc:description>

         <title>Entropy&#8208;Induced Selectivity Switch in Gold Catalysis: Fast Access to Indolo[1,2&#8208;a]quinolines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>New N &#8208;heterocyclic compounds for organic functional materials and their efficient syntheses are highly demanded. A surprising entropy&#8208;induced selectivity switch in the gold&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular hydroarylation of 2&#8208;ethynyl N &#8208;aryl indoles was found and its exploitation led to straightforward syntheses of indolo[1,2&#8208; a ]quinolines. Experimental and computational mechanistic investigations gave insight into this uncommon selectivity phenomenon and into the special reactivity of the indolo[1,2&#8208; a ]quinolines. The high functional group tolerance of this methodology enabled access to a diverse scope in high yields. In addition, bidirectional approaches, post&#8208;functionalizations, and &#960;&#8208;extension of the core structure were feasible. An in&#8208;depth study of the photophysical properties explored the structure&#8208;effect relationship for different derivatives and revealed a high potential of these compounds for future applications as functional materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective Iron Catalyzed Synthesis of N&#8208;alkylated Indolines and Indoles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Whereas iron catalysts usually promote catalyzed C3&#8208;alkylation of indole derivatives  via  borrowing&#8208;hydrogen methodology using alcohols as the electrophilic partners, this contribution shows how to switch the selectivity towards N&#8208;alkylation. Thus starting from indoline derivatives, N&#8208;alkylation was efficiently performed using a tricarbonyl(cyclopentadienone) iron complex as the catalyst in trifluoroethanol in the presence of alcohols leading to the corresponding N&#8208;alkylated indoline derivatives in 31&#8208;99% yields (28 examples). It is then shown a one&#8208;pot, two&#8208;step strategy, for the selective N&#8208;alkylation of indolines then their oxidations, leading to the corresponding N&#8208;alkylated indoles in 31&#8208;90% yields (15 examples). This unprecedented oxidation methodology involves an iron salt catalyst associated to TEMPO and a stoichiometric amount of  t&#8208;  BuOOH at RT.</dc:description>

         <title>Late&#8208;Stage Functionalization of Peptides on the Solid Phase by an Iodination&#8208;Substitution Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The functionalization of peptides at the late synthesis stage holds great potential, for example for the synthesis of peptide pharmaceutica, fluorescent biosensors or peptidomimetics among others. Here we describe an on&#8208;resin iodination&#8208;substitution reaction sequence on homoserine that is also suitable for peptide modification in a combinatorial format. The reaction sequence is accessible to a wide range of sulfur nucleophiles with various functional groups including boronic acids, hydroxyl groups or aromatic amines. In this way, methionine&#8208;like thioethers or thioesters and thiosulfonates are accessible. Next to sulfur nucleophiles, selenols, pyridines and carboxylic acids were successfully used as nucleophiles, whereas phenols did not react. The late&#8208;stage iodination&#8208;substitution approach is not only applicable to short peptides but also to the more complex 34 amino acid WW domains. We applied this strategy to introduce 7&#8208;mercapto&#8208;4&#8208;methylcoumarin into a switchable Zn(II) responsive WW domain to design an iFRETbased Zn(II) sensor.</dc:description>

         <title>Determining the reaction mechanisms of photo&#8208;thermo synergetic processes by kinetic investigations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photo&#8208;thermo catalysis utilizing light has been a promising strategy to improve the conventional thermal catalytic activity and attracts great attention nowadays. However, how heat works in synergy with light radiation is still unclear. This  &#8220;concept&#8221;  is  trying to clarify the specific contents via summarizing the kinetic studies including (  &#8560;) proposing elementary steps through pressure dependence studies, (&#8561;) estimating reaction barriers through measuring the apparent activation energies and (&#8562;) assigning the kinetically relevant step(s) with kinetic isotope effects (KIE) as well as (&#8563;) exploring the relationship of the reaction rate with the light excitation wavelength and light intensity. The challenges in kinetic studies such as describing the light&#8208;induced carrier transfer process, the surface temperature under light illumination as well as reaction intermediates were discussed at the same time. Finally, an outlook about kinetic studies in clarifying the photo&#8208;thermo catalysis reaction mechanism was proposed.</dc:description>

         <title>Bench&#8208;Stable Dinuclear Mn(I) Catalysts in E&#8208;Selective Alkyne Semihydrogenation: A Mechanistic Investigation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dinuclear manganese hydride complexes of the form [Mn 2 (CO) 8 ( &#181; &#8208;H)( &#181; &#8208;PR 2 )] (R = Ph, 1 ; R = i Pr, 2 ) were used in E &#8208;selective alkyne semi&#8208;hydrogenation ( E &#8208;SASH) catalysis. Catalyst speciation studies revealed rich coordination chemistry and the complexes thus formed were isolated and in turn tested as catalysts; the results underscoring the importance of dinuclearity in engendering the observed E &#8208;selectivity and provide insights into the nature of the active catalyst. The insertion product obtained from treating 2 with (cyclopropylethynyl)benzene contains a cis &#8208;alkenyl bridging ligand with cyclopropyl ring intact. Treatment of this complex with H 2 affords exclusively trans &#8208;(2&#8208;cyclopropylvinyl)benzene. These results, in addition to other control experiments, indicate a non&#8208;radical mechanism for E &#8208;SASH, which is highly unusual for Mn&#8211;H catalysts. The catalytically actives species are virtually inactive towards cis to trans alkene isomerization indicating that the E &#8208;selective process is intrinsic and dinuclear complexes play a critical role. A reaction mechanism is proposed accounting for the observed reactivity which is fully consistent with a kinetic analysis of the rate limiting step and is further supported by DFT computations.</dc:description>

         <title>Graphene Enabled Electric&#8208;Field Regulation and Ionic Redistribution Around Lithiophilic Aurum Nanoparticles Toward a Dendrite&#8208;Free and 2000&#8208;Cycle&#8208;Life Lithium Metal Battery</title>

         <dc:description>Lithium metal batteries (LMBs) have attracted extensive attention owing to their high theoretical capacity. However, the uncontrolled volume changes and serious Li dendrites growth of Li metal anode have hindered their commercialization. Herein, a three&#8208;dimensional Cu foam decorated with Au nanoparticles and conformal graphene layer was designed to tune the Li plating/stripping behaviors by electroless deposition and chemical vapor deposition. The 3D&#8208;Cu conductive hosts anchored by lithiophilic Au nanoparticles can effectively alleviate the volume expansion caused by the continuous plating/stripping of Li and reduce the nucleation energy barrier. Notably, the conductive graphene not only facilitates the transfer of electrons, but also acts as an ionic rectifier, thereby avoiding the aggregation of local current density and Li  +  ions around Au nanoparticles and enabling the uniform Li  +  flux. As a result, the G&#8208;Au@3D&#8208;Cu/Li anode ensures the non&#8208;dendritic and homogeneous Li  +  plating/stripping. Electrochemical results show that the symmetric G&#8208;Au@3D&#8208;Cu/Li cell delivers a low voltage hysteresis of 110 mV after 1000 h at 1 mA cm  &#8722;2  . Matched with a layered LiNi  0.6  Co  0.2  Mn  0.2  O  2  cathode, the NCM622&#9553;G&#8208;Au@3D&#8208;Cu/Li full cell exhibits a long cycle life of 2000 cycles and an ultra&#8208;low capacity decay rate (0.01% per cycle).</dc:description>

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Borylation of Acyl Chlorides with an Alkoxy Diboron Reagent: A Facile Route to Acylboron Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Copper&#8208;catalyzed borylation of acyl chlorides with B2pin2 in the presence of LiOt&#8208;Bu at room temperature provides a convenient synthetic approach to various acylboron compounds with good functional group tolerance. The synthetic utility is demonstrated by the late&#8208;stage derivatization of drug molecules and the ease of scale&#8208;up. A catalytic mechanism is proposed based on in&#8197;situ reaction monitoring and the structural characterization of a key acylboronate intermediate and a novel Cu complex byproduct.







Abstract
Herein, the copper&#8208;catalyzed borylation of readily available acyl chlorides with bis(pinacolato)diboron, (B2pin2) or bis(neopentane glycolato)diboron (B2neop2) is reported, which provides stable potassium acyltrifluoroborates (KATs) in good yields from the acylboronate esters. A variety of functional groups are tolerated under the mild reaction conditions (room temperature) and substrates containing different carbon&#8208;skeletons, such as aryl, heteroaryl and primary, secondary, tertiary alkyl are applicable. Acyl N&#8208;methyliminodiacetic acid (MIDA) boronates can also been accessed by modification of the workup procedures. This process is scalable and also amenable to the late&#8208;stage conversion of carboxylic acid&#8208;containing drugs into their acylboron analogues, which have been challenging to prepare previously. A catalytic mechanism is proposed based on in&#8197;situ monitoring of the reaction between p&#8208;toluoyl chloride and an NHC&#8208;copper(I) boryl complex as well as the isolation of an unusual lithium acylBpinOBpin compound as a key intermediate.

         <title>Neutron Diffraction Study of Indole Solvation in Deep Eutectic Systems of Choline Chloride, Malic Acid, and Water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The solvation of indole in choline chloride:malic acid deep eutectic solvents is shown by neutron diffraction with isotopic substitution and atomistic modelling to vary with water content. Latent water does little, whereas adding 2&#8197;mole of equivalents of water causes interactions, not with the &#960;&#8208;system of indole, but via hydrophobic hydration and H&#8208;bonding in&#8208;plane with the heterocyclic rings. These results may therefore explain trends in heterocycle reactivity and selectivity.







Abstract
Deep eutectic systems are currently under intense investigation to replace traditional organic solvents in a range of syntheses. Here, indole in choline chloride&#8208;malic acid deep eutectic solvent (DES) was studied as a function of water content, to identify solute interactions with the DES which affect heterocycle reactivity and selectivity, and as a proxy for biomolecule solvation. Empirical Potential Structure Refinement models of neutron diffraction data showed [Cholinium]+ cations associate strongly with the indole &#960;&#8208;system due to electrostatics, whereas malic acid is only weakly associated. Trace water is sequestered into the DES and does not interact strongly with indole. When water is added to the DES, it does not interact with the indole &#960;&#8208;system but is exclusively in&#8208;plane with the heterocyclic rings, forming strong H&#8208;bonds with the &#8208;NH group, and also weak H&#8208;bonds and thus prominent hydrophobic hydration of the indole aromatic region, which could direct selectivity in reactions.

A gem of a reaction: The first examples of stepwise (Pd) or direct (Ni) metal&#8208;promoted double geminal activation of C
&#8722;H bonds leading to imidazole&#8208;type N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene metal pincer complexes under mild conditions are presented.







Abstract
We report the first examples of metal&#8208;promoted double geminal activation of C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds of the N&#8722;CH2&#8722;N moiety in an imidazole&#8208;type heterocycle, leading to nickel and palladium N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene complexes under mild conditions. Reaction of the new electron&#8208;rich diphosphine 1,3&#8208;bis((di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphosphaneyl)methyl)&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1H&#8208;benzo[d]imidazole (1) with [PdCl2(cod)] occurred in a stepwise fashion, first by single C&#8722;H bond activation yielding the alkyl pincer complex [PdCl(PC
HP)] (3) with two trans phosphane donors and a covalent Pd&#8722;C
 bond. Activation of the C&#8722;H bond of the resulting &#945;&#8208;methine C
H&#8722;M group occurred subsequently when 3 was treated with HCl to yield the NHC pincer complex [PdCl(PCNHCP)]Cl (2). Treatment of 1 with [NiBr2(dme)] also afforded a NHC pincer complex, [NiBr(PCNHCP)]Br (6), but the reactions leading to the double geminal C&#8722;H bond activation of the N&#8722;CH2&#8722;N group were too fast to allow identification or isolation of an intermediate analogous to 3. The determination of six crystal structures, the isolation of reaction intermediates and DFT calculations provided the basis for suggesting the mechanism of the stepwise transformation of a N&#8722;CH2&#8722;N moiety in the N&#8722;CNHC&#8722;N unit of NHC pincer complexes and explain the key differences observed between the Pd and Ni chemistries.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Induced Halogen&#8208;Atom Transfer: Generation of Halide Radicals for Selective Hydrohalogenation Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first photo&#8208;mediated process enabling the generation of halide radicals by halogen&#8208;atom transfer (XAT) is described. This novel reactivity pattern relies on the use of 1,2&#8208;dihaloethanes for the generation of unstable carbon radicals by XAT, which after &#946;&#8208;scission, release halide radicals that have been used in selective hydrohalogenations of unsaturated hydrocarbons.







Abstract
The first photo&#8208;mediated process enabling the generation of halide radicals by Halogen&#8208;Atom Transfer (XAT) is described. Contrary to radical transformations involving XAT reactivity, which exploit stable carbon radicals, this unique approach uses 1,2&#8208;dihaloethanes for the generation of unstable carbon radicals by XAT. These transient radicals then undergo &#946;&#8208;scission with release of ethylene and formation of more stable halide radicals which have been used in selective hydrohalogenations of a large number of unsaturated hydrocarbons, including Michael acceptors, unactivated alkenes and alkynes.

     alt="Photo-Induced Halogen-Atom Transfer: Generation of Halide Radicals for Selective Hydrohalogenation Reactions"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The first photo-mediated process&lt;/b&gt; enabling the generation of halide radicals by halogen-atom transfer (XAT) is described. This novel reactivity pattern relies on the use of 1,2-dihaloethanes for the generation of unstable carbon radicals by XAT, which after &#946;-scission, release halide radicals that have been used in selective hydrohalogenations of unsaturated hydrocarbons.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first photo-mediated process enabling the generation of halide radicals by Halogen-Atom Transfer (XAT) is described. Contrary to radical transformations involving XAT reactivity, which exploit stable carbon radicals, this unique approach uses 1,2-dihaloethanes for the generation of unstable carbon radicals by XAT. These transient radicals then undergo &#946;-scission with release of ethylene and formation of more stable halide radicals which have been used in selective hydrohalogenations of a large number of unsaturated hydrocarbons, including Michael acceptors, unactivated alkenes and alkynes. This hydrohalogenation is tolerant of a broad range of functionalities and is believed to proceed through a radical-chain manifold that propagates by the use of silane derivatives.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Intense Photoinduced Intervalence Charge Transfer in High&#8208;Valent Iron Mixed Phenolate/Carbene Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The usefulness of high&#8208;valent iron(NHC) chromophores is based on long&#8208;lived, ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer (LMCT) states. However, short&#8208;lived, metal&#8208;centered states may be populated if the ligands are not strong enough donors. We show that, thanks to metal&#8208;ligand covalency, iron ions can bridge ligand&#8211;ligand electronic communication, promoting ligand&#8208;based photoinduced intervalence charge transfer (PIIVCT) bands: spectroscopic markers in the usually silent NIR region that allow the interconversion between LMCT&#8208; and metal&#8208;centered states to be monitored.







Abstract
We report high&#8208;valent iron complexes supported by N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;anchored, bis&#8208;phenolate pincer ligands that undergo ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer (LMCT) upon photoexcitation. The resulting excited states &#8211; with a lifetime in the picosecond range &#8211; feature a ligand&#8208;based, mixed&#8208;valence system and intense intervalence charge transfer bands in the near&#8208;infrared region. Upon oxidation of the complex, corresponding intervalence charge transfer absorptions are also observed in the ground state. We suggest that the spectroscopic hallmarks of such LMCT states provide useful tools to decipher excited&#8208;state decay mechanisms in high&#8208;valent NHC complexes. Our observations further indicate that NHC&#8208;anchored, bis&#8208;phenolate pincer ligands are not sufficiently strong donors to prevent the population of excited metal&#8208;centered states in high&#8208;valent iron complexes.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light Augmented Lithium Storage Capacity in a Ruthenium(II) Photosensitizer Conjugated with a Dione&#8208;Catechol Redox Couple</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New strategies to address climate change are more urgent than ever. A molecular metallo&#8208;organic bifunctional material with covalently attached photo&#8208;active and redox units led to synchronous light harvesting and energy storage functions. As cathode material in a two&#8208;electrode Li photo&#8208;battery configuration, the storage capacity increased by 100&#8201;%, under 470&#8197;nm illumination with output power of 4.0&#8197;mW/cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
Controlling redox activity of judiciously appended redox units on a photo&#8208;sensitive molecular core is an effective strategy for visible light energy harvesting and storage. The first example of a photosensitizer &#8208; electron donor coordination compound in which the photoinduced electron transfer step is used for light to electrical energy conversion and storage is reported. A photo&#8208;responsive Ru&#8208;diimine module conjugated with redox&#8208;active catechol groups in [Ru(II)(phenanthroline&#8208;5,6&#8208;diolate)3]4&#8722; photosensitizer can mediate photoinduced catechol to dione oxidation in the presence of a sacrificial electron acceptor or at the surface of an electrode. Under potentiostatic condition, visible light triggered current density enhancement confirmed the light harvesting ability of this photosensitizer. Upon implementation in galvanostatic charge&#8208;discharge of a Li battery configuration, the storage capacity was found to be increased by 100&#8201;%, under 470&#8197;nm illumination with output power of 4.0&#8197;mW/cm&#8722;2. This proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept molecular system marks an important milestone towards a new generation of molecular photo&#8208;rechargeable materials.

         <title>Intramolecular (4+3) Cycloadditions of Oxidopyridinium Ions: Towards Daphnicyclidin A</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
No strain, no gain: Studies of the intramolecular (4+3) cycloaddition reaction of oxidopyridinium ions led to the idea that the reaction might be applicable to daphnicyclidin A and related alkaloids. It was demonstrated that despite an increase in strain relative to cycloadducts we had been studying, the ABC ring system of daphnicyclidin A, including a quaternary center, could be synthesized in 6 steps in 36.5&#8201;% overall yield from commercially available 4&#8208;hydroxybutanone.







Abstract
N&#8208;alkylation of 5&#8208;hydroxynicotinic acid esters with electrophiles containing diene functionality produces salts that undergo intramolecular (4+3) cycloaddition reactions upon heating in the presence of base. Initial studies used a three&#8208;carbon tether to join the pyridinium ion and diene, revealing some aspects of the inherent selectivity of the reaction with such substrates. Much more challenging was the synthesis of related species possessing only a two&#8208;carbon tether. Nevertheless, the cycloaddition of such compounds was successful, leading directly to the ABC ring system of the alkaloid daphnicyclidin A.

         <title>Sequential Nucleophilic Substitution of Phosphorus Trichloride with Alcohols in a Continuous&#8208;Flow Reactor and Consideration of a Mechanism for Reduced Over&#8208;reaction through the Addition of Imidazole</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sequential nucleophilic substitution of phosphorus trichloride with alcohols has been achieved. Over&#8208;reaction was suppressed by rapid mixing through micro&#8208;flow technology, and asymmetric phosphotriesters containing acid&#8208; and/or base&#8208;labile functional groups were synthesized in good to high yields. Moreover, a mechanistic study by using DFT calculations suggested interesting reaction pathways. More information can be found in the Research Article by S. Fuse and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202200932).

         <title>Phosphorescence Induction by Host&#8208;Guest Complexation with Cyclodextrins &#8211; The Role of Regioisomerism and Affinity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present an in&#8208;depth investigation of cyclodextrin complexes with guest compounds featuring complexation&#8208;induced room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) in aqueous solution. Very interestingly, only the complexed regioisomers bearing lateral substituents on meta&#8208;position are showing RTP, whereas the stronger host&#8208;guest systems with para&#8208;substituted dyes show no RTP features. The reported systems were investigated regarding their complexation behavior in water using isothermal titration calorimetry and mass spectrometry. In the case of &#947;&#8208;CD very strong 1:1 inclusion complexes (K  a  up to 5.13 x 10  5  M  &#8208;1  ) were unexpectedly observed. It was found that not only a strong binding to the cyclodextrin cavity is needed to restrict motion, inducing the emission, but also the conformation inside the cavity plays a pivotal role &#8211; as supported by an extensive NMR study and MD simulations.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Comparison of Subvalent, Polycationic Group 13 Cluster Compounds: Lessons learned on Isoelectronic DMPE Substituted Gallium and Indium Tetracation Salts&#8224;</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The tetracationic, univalent cluster compounds [{M(dmpe)}  4  ]  4+  (M = Ga, In; dmpe =  bis  (dimethyl&#8208;phosphino)ethane) were synthesized as their  pf  salts ([  pf  ]  &#8722;  = [Al(OR  F  )  4  ]  &#8722;  ; R  F  = C(CF  3  )  3  ). The four&#8208;membered ring in [{M(dmpe)}  4  ]  4+  is slightly puckered for M = Ga and almost square planar for M = In. Yet, although structurally similar, only the gallium cluster is prevalent in solution, while the indium cluster forms temperature dependent equilibria that include even the monomeric cation [In(dmpe)]  +  . This system is the first report of one and the same ligand inducing formation of isoelectronic and isostructural gallium / indium cluster cations. The system allows to study systematically analogies and differences with thermodynamic considerations and bonding analyses, but also to outline perspectives for bond activation using cationic, subvalent group 13 clusters.</dc:description>

         <title>Design, Synthesis and Characterization of a New Visible Light&#8208;Sensitive Molecular Switch and its PEGylation Towards a Self&#8208;Assembling Molecule</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>HBDI&#8208;like chromophores represent a novel set of biomimetic switches mimicking the fluophore of the green fluorescent protein that are currently studied with the hope to expand the molecular switch/motor toolbox. However, until now members capable of absorbing visible light in their neutral (i.e. non&#8208;anionic) form have not been reported. In this contribution we report the preparation of a HBDI&#8208;like chromophore based on a 3&#8208;phenyl benzofulvene scaffold capable to absorb blue light and photoisomerize in the picosecond time scale. More specifically, we show that double bond photoisomerization occurs in both the E&#8208;to&#8208;Z and Z&#8208;to&#8208;E directions and that these can be controlled by irradiating with blue&#8208;light and UV light respectively. Finally, as a preliminary applicative result, we report the incorporation of the chromophore in an amphiphilic molecule and demonstrate the formation of a visible light&#8208;sensitive nanoaggregated state in water.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemically laminated 2D bis(terpyridine)metal polymer films: Formation mechanism at the liquid&#8208;liquid interface and redox rectification</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recent studies on molecular 2D materials with high tunability of structures and functions have focused mostly on discovery of new precursors. Here, we demonstrate a facile one&#8208;pot synthesis of laminated 2D coordination polymer films comprising bis(terpyridine)&#8208;iron and &#8208;cobalt at a water/dichloromethane interface. Cross&#8208;sectional elemental mapping unveils a stratum&#8208;like structure of the film and reveals that the second layer grows to the dichloromethane side below the first layer. A cyclic voltammogram clarifies that the bottom layer mediates charge transfer between the top layer and the substrate in a narrow potential region of mixed&#8208;valence states. Furthermore, the bilayer film sandwiched by electrodes in a dry condition shows stable rectification character and the barrier voltage corresponds to the redox potential difference of the two layers. The present study introduces a new strategy of polymer design to explore material science of molecular 2D materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Cephem&#8208;Pyrazinoic Acid Conjugates: Circumventing Resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tuberculosis (TB) is a leading source of infectious disease mortality globally. Antibiotic&#8208;resistant strains comprise an estimated 10% of new TB cases and present an urgent need for novel therapeutics. &#946;&#8208;lactam antibiotics have traditionally been ineffective against M. tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative agent of TB, due to the organism&#8217;s inherent expression of &#946;&#8208;lactamases that destroy the electrophilic &#946;&#8208;lactam warhead. We have developed novel &#946;&#8208;lactam conjugates, which exploit this inherent &#946;&#8208;lactamase activity to achieve selective release of pyrazinoic acid (POA), the active form of a first&#8208;line TB drug. These conjugates are selectively active against M. tuberculosis and related mycobacteria, and activity is retained or even potentiated in multiple resistant strains and models. Preliminary mechanistic investigations suggest that both the POA &#8220;warhead&#8221; as well as the &#946;&#8208;lactam &#8220;promoiety&#8221; contribute to the observed activity, demonstrating a codrug strategy with important implications for future TB therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Superacid&#8208;Mediated Late&#8208;Stage Aromatic Polydeuteration of Pharmaceuticals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The field of medicinal chemistry is currently witnessing a  deuterium rush  owing to the remarkable properties of this element as bioisoster of hydrogen atom. Aromatic hydrogen isotope exchange (HIE) is one of the most studied strategies nowadays as it promises to access deuterium&#8208;modified drugs directly from their non&#8208;labeled parents. While most of the recent studies focus on metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8211;H activation strategy, the use of superacidic conditions has been largely overlooked. Here, we show that the use of TfOD as reaction medium allows the late&#8208;stage polydeuteration of a broad library of pharmaceuticals bearing a wide array of functional groups, complementing existing procedures.</dc:description>

         <title>Facet Engineering on WO3 Mono&#8208;Particle&#8208;Layer Electrode for Photoelectrochemical Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoelectrochemical (PEC) performance of WO3 photoanode for water splitting is heavily influenced by the orientation of crystal facets. In this work, mono&#8208;particle&#8208;layer electrodes, assembled by particulate WO3 square plates with highly uniform alignment along (002) facet, improved PEC water oxidation kinetics and stability. Photo&#8208;deposition of Au along the cracks formed on the surface of the plates, which are the edges of {110} facets, was found to further enhance electron collection efficiency. Combination of these two strategies allowed the facet engineered WO3 electrode to produce significantly higher efficiencies in charge separation and transfer than the electrode prepared without facet orientation. This work has provided a facile route for fabricating structurally designed WO3 photoelectrode, which is also applicable to other regularly&#8208;shaped semiconductor photocatalysts with anisotropic charge migration.</dc:description>

         <title>Time and Atom Economical Regio&#8208; and Chemoselective Radical Cyclization of Unactivated 1,6&#8208;Enynes Under Metal&#8208; and Oxidant&#8208;Free Conditions</title>

Chemical economics! Highly substituted five&#8208;membered heterocyclic compounds were synthesized from unactivated 1,6&#8208;enynes and sulfonyl halides under metal, additive&#8208;free reaction conditions. These transformations can minimize chemical waste, save time, and simplify practical aspects compared to exiting protocols.







Abstract
We developed time&#8208;atom economic regio&#8208; and chemoselective sulfonyl radical triggered 5&#8208;exo&#8208;dig cyclization of unactivated 1,6&#8208;enynes with sulfonyl halides under metal, additive&#8208;free reaction conditions to achieve highly substituted five&#8208;membered heterocyclic compounds. This transformation creates three new bonds, such as C&#8722;SO2, C&#8722;C, and active C&#8722;I/Br bonds. Importantly, one&#8208;pot protocols produce desired products directly from sodium sulfinates and have an additional advantage such as minimising chemical waste, saving time, and simplifying practical aspects compared to existing protocols.

         <title>Significant Effect of the Flexibility of Bridging Alkyl Chains on the Proximity of Stacked Porphyrin and Phthalocyanine Conjugated with a Fourfold Rotaxane Linkage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The flexibility of the bridging alkyl chains is important for proximity in the stacking of porphyrin and phthalocyanine conjugated through a fourfold rotaxane linkage. This picture shows a chochin, a Japanese lantern made with paper and thin strips of bamboo that can be expanded and contracted flexibly. This foldability recalls the induced molecular interaction in the flexible molecular conjugate. More information can be found in the Research Article by K. Tanaka et&#8197;al.

         <title>Mapping Catalyst&#8211;Solvent Interplay in Competing Carboamination/Cyclopropanation Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
What will my product be? Selectivity and activity maps can be used to predict and rationalize reaction outcomes based on catalyst and solvent choice. Here, there utility is demonstrated by examining competing carboamination/cyclopropanation reactions catalyzed by Group 9 catalysts featuring cyclopentadienyl ligands, which reveals an interesting energetic interplay involving the role of the solvent and of the catalyst.







Abstract
Group 9 metals, in particular RhIII complexes with cyclopentadienyl ligands, are competent C&#8722;H activation catalysts. Recently, a Cp*RhIII&#8208;catalyzed reaction of alkenes with N&#8208;enoxyphthalimides showed divergent outcome based on the solvent, with carboamination favored in methanol and cyclopropanation in 2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethanol (TFE). Here, we create selectivity and activity maps capable of unravelling the catalyst&#8208;solvent interplay on the outcome of these competing reactions by analyzing 42 cyclopentadienyl metal catalysts, CpXMIII (M=Co, Rh, Ir). These maps not only can be used to rationalize previously reported experimental results, but also capably predict the behavior of untested catalyst/solvent combinations as well as aid in identifying experimental protocols that simultaneously optimize both catalytic activity and selectivity (solutions in the Pareto front). In this regard, we demonstrate how and why the experimentally employed Cp*RhIII catalyst represents an ideal choice to invoke a solvent&#8208;induced change in reactivity. Additionally, the maps reveal the degree to which even perceived minor changes in the solvent (e.&#8201;g., replacing methanol with ethanol) influence the ratio of carboamination and cyclopropanation products. Overall, the selectivity and activity maps presented here provide a generalizable tool to create global pictures of anticipated reaction outcome that can be used to develop new experimental protocols spanning metal, ligand, and solvent space.

         <title>Chemically Modified Poly(A) Analogs Targeting PABP: Structure Activity Relationship and Translation Inhibitory Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oligonucleotide mRNA poly(A) tail analogs containing various nucleotide modifications were evaluated as binders for poly(A) binding protein (PABP) using a microscale thermophoresis&#8208;based assay. Their susceptibility to specific degradation by CNOT7 deadenylase was also examined in order to identify best stabilizing modifications. Analogs exhibiting highest affinity and stability were tested in rabbit reticulocyte lysate system and proved to act as efficient translational inhibitors with potential applications in mRNA&#8208;related research.







Abstract
Poly(A)&#8208;binding protein (PABP) is an essential element of cellular translational machinery. Recent studies have revealed that poly(A) tail modifications can modulate mRNA stability and translational potential, and that oligoadenylate&#8208;derived PABP ligands can act as effective translational inhibitors with potential applications in pain management. Although extensive research has focused on protein&#8208;RNA and protein&#8208;protein interactions involving PABPs, further studies are required to examine the ligand specificity of PABP. In this study, we developed a microscale thermophoresis&#8208;based assay to probe the interactions between PABP and oligoadenylate analogs containing different chemical modifications. Using this method, we evaluated oligoadenylate analogs modified with nucleobase, ribose, and phosphate moieties to identify modification hotspots. In addition, we determined the susceptibility of the modified oligos to CNOT7 to identify those with the potential for increased cellular stability. Consequently, we selected two enzymatically stable oligoadenylate analogs that inhibit translation in rabbit reticulocyte lysates with a higher potency than a previously reported PABP ligand. We believe that the results presented in this study and the implemented methodology can be capitalized upon in the future development of RNA&#8208;based biological tools.

Tuning by timing: The photo&#8208;initiation of Sonogashira cross&#8208;coupling was achieved using a simple white LED combined with a triphenylphosphine ruthenium&#8211;arene complex bearing an azobenzene ligand. The strategy developed in this work involves the photo&#8208;controlled release of metal catalyst activator (PPh3) through Z&#8208;to&#8208;E azobenzene isomerization, thus generating competent Pd0 active species, and allows fine tuning of reaction kinetics according to irradiation time.







Abstract
Photo&#8208;release of triphenylphosphine from a sulfonamide azobenzene ruthenium&#8211;arene complex was exploited to activate PdIICl2 into Pd0 catalyst, for the photo&#8208;initiation of Sonogashira cross&#8208;coupling. The transformation was initiated on demand &#8211; by using simple white LED strip lights &#8211; with a high temporal response and the ability to control reaction rate by changing the irradiation time. Various substrates were successfully applied to this photo&#8208;initiated cross&#8208;coupling, thus illustrating the wide functional&#8208;group tolerance of our photo&#8208;caged catalyst activator, without any need for sophisticated photochemistry apparatus.

         <dc:description>
Investigating the formation process of zeolitic octahedral metal oxides (ZOMOs) shows that controlling Ni content, reducing agent, and synthesis time &#1013;&#8208;Keggin nickel molybdate&#8208;based ZOMOs or molecules. The zeolitic nickel molybdates are effective for C2 hydrocarbon separation.







Abstract
Zeolitic octahedral metal oxides are inorganic crystalline microporous materials with adsorption and redox properties. New &#1013;&#8208;Keggin nickel molybdate&#8211;based zeolitic octahedral metal oxides have been synthesized. 31P NMR spectroscopy shows that reduction of MoVI&#8208;based molybdates forms an &#1013;&#8208;Keggin polyoxometalate that immediately transfers to the solid phase. Investigation of the formation process indicates that a low Ni concentration, insoluble reducing agent, and long synthesis time are the critical factors for obtaining the zeolite octahedral metal oxides rather than the &#1013;&#8208;Keggin polyoxometalate molecule. The synthesized zeolitic nickel molybdate with Na+ is used as the adsorbent, which effectively separates C2 hydrocarbon mixtures.

         <title>The Significant Role of the Atomic Surface Structure of Support in Strong Metal&#8208;Support Interaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
General strategies for tailoring SMSI, including classical SMSI, oxidative SMSI, and various SMSIs after complex treatments are summarized in this concept. Moreover, a new proposal, considering both the exposed facets of support and the interaction with gas, is presented to alter the property of the support to tune SMSI. With this strategy, the same support can vary its property to reducible, oxidative, or other complex properties.







Abstract
Supported metal catalysts are important in many industrial reactions. It is reported that support materials are not always inert, and in some cases could even interact with metal nanoparticles (NPs) actively via various ways. In particular, the strong metal&#8208;support interaction (SMSI), referring to metal NPs covered by support materials, affects catalysis at the active sites on the metal NP surface, which can serve as a very effective method in tuning and improving catalytic performance. By tailoring the support materials or controlling the treatment processes, different kinds of SMSI, such as classical SMSI, oxidative SMSI, wet&#8208;chemistry SMSI, and adsorbate&#8208;mediated SMSI, can be achieved. This concept summarizes the general strategies to tune SMSI and discusses the key results. Moreover, a new proposal is presented to tailor SMSI by combining both the exposed facets of the support materials and external environments. Furthermore, the challenges faced at present are discussed and useful insights for future research concerning this topic are provided.

         <title>Ultrathin Two&#8208;Dimensional Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Nanosheets Based on a Halogen&#8208;Substituted Porphyrin Ligand: Synthesis and Catalytic Application in CO2 Reductive Amination</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of ultrathin porphyrinic metal&#8211;organic framework (X&#8208;PMOF, X=F, Cl, Br) nanosheets with a thickness of down to 4.5&#8197;nm was prepared from the self&#8208;assembly of unsymmetrical halogen&#8208;based porphyrin ligands and ZrCl4. With the introduction of iridium(III) atoms into the porphyrin rings, the resultant Br&#8208;PMOF(Ir) nanosheets were efficient for CO2 reduction and aminolysis, giving rise to formamides in high yields under room temperature and atmospheric pressure.







Abstract
Ultrathin two&#8208;dimensional metal&#8211;organic framework nanosheets have emerged as a promising kind of heterogeneous catalysts. Herein, we report a series of 2D porphyrinic metal&#8211;organic framework nanosheets (X&#8208;PMOF, X=F, Cl, Br), which was prepared from the self&#8208;assembly of a halogen&#8208;based porphyrin ligand X&#8208;TCPP (X&#8208;TCPP=5&#8208;(4&#8208;halogenatedphenyl)&#8208;10,15,20&#8208;tris(4&#8208;carboxyphenyl)&#8208;porphyrin) and ZrCl4 in the presence of trifluoroacetic acid as the modulating reagent. The framework of X&#8208;PMOF possessed the ftw topology as in MOF&#8208;525. The lamellar X&#8208;PMOF nanosheets with the thickness of down to 4.5&#8197;nm were assembled and aggregated into a flower&#8208;like morphology. With the introduction of iridium(III) atoms into the porphyrin rings, the resultant X&#8208;PMOF(Ir) nanosheets were prepared by a similar method. Catalytic results show that Br&#8208;PMOF(Ir) nanosheets were efficient for CO2 reduction and aminolysis, giving rise to formamides in high yields under room temperature and atmospheric pressure, and can be recycled and reused for 3 runs. The total turnover number of Br&#8208;PMOF(Ir) after 3 runs was 1644 based on Ir. Mechanistic studies disclose that the high efficiency of Br&#8208;PMOF(Ir) nanosheets was ascribed to three factors, including the superior activation capability of iridium(III) porphyrin for Si&#8722;H bonds, more active sites on the external surfaces of Br&#8208;PMOF(Ir) nanosheets, and the defects caused by unsymmetrical porphyrin ligand that increased the framework's affinity towards CO2.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synthesis of fluorescent P&#8208;hydroxybinaphtylphosphole&#8208;oxide or &#8208;sulfide was achieved by trapping a binaphtyl dianion with methyl dichlorophosphite or P&#8208;(N,N&#8208;diethylamino)dichlorophosphine, followed by oxidation or sulfuration of the P&#8208;center. After saponification or acid hydrolysis, the P&#8208;hydroxyphospholes were coupled to peptides using the coupling agent BOP, under the conditions required for the synthesis in solution or on a solid support. This new method was illustrated by the labeling of the JMV2959, a potent antagonist of the Growth Hormone Secretagogue Receptor type 1a (GHS&#8208;R1a). The labeled conjugates were used to characterize GHSR ligands by competition assays, based on Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET). Such P&#8208;hydroxyphosphole&#8208;oxide or &#8208;sulfide constitutes a promising new class of compact fluorophores with large Stokes shift, for labeling biomolecules by grafting through the phosphorus atom.</dc:description>

         <title>Different Enzyme Conformations Induce Different Mechanistic Traits on HIV&#8208;1 Protease</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The influence of the dynamical flexibility of enzymes in reaction mechanisms is a cornerstone in biological sciences. In this study we aim to: (1) study the convergence of the activation free energy, using the first step of the reaction catalysed by HIV&#8208;1 protease as a case study; and (2) provide further evidence for a mechanistic divergence in this enzyme, as two different reaction pathways were observed to contribute to this step. Here we used quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics molecular dynamics simulations, on four different initial conformations, which led to different barriers in a previous study. Despite the sampling, the four activation free energies still spanned a range of 5.0 kcal&#183;mol  &#8208;1  . Furthermore, the present simulations did confirm the occurrence of an unusual mechanistic divergence, with two different mechanistic pathways displaying equivalent barriers. An active site water molecule was proposed to influence the mechanistic pathway.</dc:description>

         <title>Resolving atomic&#8208;scale defects in conjugated polymers on&#8208;surfaces</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Atomic scale defects significantly affect the mechanical, electronic, and optical properties of &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymers. Here we deliberately introduce isolated atomic&#8208;scale defects into a prototypical anthracene&#8208;ethynylene &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymer and carefully examine its local density of states on the atomic scale to show how individual defects modify the inherent electronic and magnetic properties of this one&#8208;dimensional systems. Our scanning tunneling and atomic force microscopy experiments, supplemented with density functional theory calculations, reveal the existence of a sharp electronic resonance at the Fermi energy around certain defects, which is associated with the formation of a local magnetic moment accompanied by substantial mitigation of the mobility of charge carriers. While defects in traditionally synthesized polymers lead to arbitrary conformations, our results clearly reflect the preferential formation of low dimensional defects at specific polymer sites, which may introduce the possibility of engineering macroscopic defects in surface&#8208;synthesized conjugated polymers.</dc:description>

         <title>Adamantyl Side&#8208;Chains as Anti&#8208;aggregating Moieties in Dyes for Dye&#8208;Sensitized Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Designing and evaluating novel dye concepts is crucial for the development of the field of dye&#8208;sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). In our recent report, the novel concept of tethering the anti&#8208;aggregation additive chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) to dyes for DSSC was introduced. Based on the performance improvements seen for this modification, the aim of this study is to see if a simplified anti&#8208;aggregation unit could achieve similar results. The following study reports the synthesis and photovoltaic characterization of two novel dyes decorated with the steric ethyladamantyl moiety on the &#960;&#8208;spacer, and on the triarylamine donor. This modification is demonstrated to be successful in increasing the photovoltages in devices employing copper&#8208;based electrolytes compared to the non&#8208;modified reference dye. The best photovoltaic performance is achieved by a device prepared with the adamantyl decorated donor dye and CDCA, this device achieves a power conversion efficiency of 6.1% (Short&#8208;circuit current = 8.3 mA cm&#8208;2, Open&#8208;circuit voltage = 1054 mV, Fill factor = 0.69). The improved photovoltaic performance seen for the adamantyl decorated donor demonstrate the potential of ethyladamantyl side chains as a tool to ensure surface protection of TiO2.</dc:description>

         <title>In&#8208;situ Grignard Metalation Method, Part I: Synthesis of Hauser Bases</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The  in&#8208;situ Grignard  Metalation Method (  i  GMM) is a straightforward one&#8208;pot procedure to quickly produce multigram amounts of  Hauser  bases R  2  N&#8208;MgBr which are valuable and vastly used metalation reagents and novel electrolytes for magnesium batteries. During addition of bromoethane to a suspension of Mg metal and secondary amine at room temperature in an ethereal solvent, a smooth reaction yields R  2  N&#8208;MgBr under evolution of ethane within a few hours. A  Schlenk  equilibrium is operative, interconverting the  Hauser  bases into their solvated homoleptic congeners Mg(NR  2  )  2  and MgBr  2  depending on the solvent. Scope and preconditions are studied, and side reactions limiting the yield have been investigated. DOSY&#8208;NMR experiments and X&#8208;ray crystal structures of characteristic examples clarify aggregation in solution and the solid state.</dc:description>

         <title>Photothermal Catalytic Oxidation of Cinnamyl Alcohol with Hydrogen Peroxide by Gold Nanoparticle/Antimony&#8208;Doped Tin Oxide Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Gold nanoparticles with different mean sizes were formed on antimony&#8208;doped tin oxide nanocrystals by the temperature&#8208;varied deposition&#8208;precipitation method (Au/ATO NCs). Au/ATO NCs possess strong absorption of ATO NCs in the near&#8208;infrared region due to the Drude excitation in addition to the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of Au NPs around 530 nm. Au/ATO NCs show thermally activated catalytic activity for the oxidation of cinnamyl alcohol to cinnamaldehyde by hydrogen peroxide. The catalytic activity increases with a decrease in the mean Au particle size (  d  Au  ) at 5.3 nm &#8804;  d  Au  &#8804; 8.2 nm. Light irradiation (  l  ex  &gt; 660 nm, ~0.5 sun) of Au/ATO NCs gives rise to an increase in the rate of reaction more than two times with ~95% selectivity. Kinetic analyses indicated that the striking enhancement of the reaction stems from the rise in the temperature near the catalyst surface of ~ 30 K due to the photothermal effect of the ATO NCs.</dc:description>
