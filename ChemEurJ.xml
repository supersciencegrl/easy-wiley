         <title>Triplet Exciton Up&#8208;Converting Blue Exciplex Host for Deep Blue Phosphors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) type exciplex host employing a novel electron transport type (n&#8208;type) host managing positive polarons and stabilizing excitons was developed to elongate the device lifetime of deep blue phosphorescent organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (PhOLEDs). The bipolar n&#8208;type host was designed to prevent hole leakage and secure hole stability while being stabilized under excitons by introducing a CN modified carbazole moiety as a weak donor. The TADF type exciplex host based blue PhOLEDs showed high quantum efficiency above 20% with a deep blue color coordinate of (0.14, 0.16) and elongated device lifetime. The device operational lifetime of the blue PhOLEDs bearing the TADF type exciplex host was extended by more than twice compared to that of the exciplex free unipolar host. This work suggested a design concept of the n&#8208;type host to develop the TADF type exciplex host for deep blue phosphors to reach long lifespan in the deep blue PhOLEDs.</dc:description>

         <title>Proton&#8208;Coupled Electron Transfer (PCET) with 1,4&#8208;Bisguanidino&#8208;Benzene Derivatives: Comparative Study and Use in Acid&#8208;Initiated C&#8208;H Activation</title>

         <dc:description>
1,4&#8208;Bisguanidino&#8208;benzenes are versatile reagents in proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) reactions. In this work the effect of guanidino group modification on the PCET reactivity is evaluated (X=H or OMe) and the best performing two compounds applied in intra&#8208; and inter&#8208;molecular aryl&#8208;aryl coupling and oxidative lactonization test reactions. In difference to related reactions with high&#8208;potential benzoquinones, only a small amount of acid is required to inititiate efficient reactions under mild conditions.







Abstract
Proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) is of key importance in modern synthetic chemistry. Redox&#8208;active guanidines were established by our group as valuable alternatives to toxic high&#8208;potential benzoquinones in a variety of different PCET reactions. In this work, the PCET reactivity of a series of 1,4&#8208;bisguanidino&#8208;benzenes varying in their redox potentials and proton affinities is evaluated. The relevant redox and protonation states are fully characterized, and the compounds sorted with respect to their PCET reactivity by comparative PCET experiments supplemented by quantum&#8208;chemical calculations. Depending on the studied reactions, the driving force is either electron transfer or proton transfer; thereby the influence of both processes on the overall reactivity could be assessed. Then, two of the PCET reagents are applied in representative oxidative aryl&#8208;aryl coupling reactions, namely the intramolecular coupling of 3,3&#8217;&#8217;&#8208;4,4&#8217;&#8217;&#8208;tetramethoxy&#8208;o&#8208;terphenyl to give the corresponding triphenylene, the intermolecular coupling of N&#8208;ethylcarbazole to give N,N&#8217;&#8208;diethyl&#8208;3,3&#8217;&#8208;bicarbazole, and in the oxidative lactonization of 2&#8208;[(4&#8208;methoxyphenyl)methyl]&#8208;benzoic acid. Under mild conditions, the reactions proceed fast and efficient. Only small amounts of acid are needed, in clear contrast to the corresponding coupling reactions with traditional high&#8208;potential benzoquinones such as DDQ or chloranil requiring a large excess of a strong acid.

This post&#8208;functionalization gives a straightforward access to modified complexes in only one manipulation and allows to introduce thermally sensitive functional groups such as trifluoromethyl, nitrile, benzoyl or ester. The X&#8208;ray crystallography, photophysical, and electrochemical properties of the diarylated complexes were investigated.

         <title>Local Light&#8208;controlled Generation of Calcium Carbonate and Barium Carbonate Biomorphs via Photochemical Stimulation.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photochemical activation is proposed as a general method for controlling the crystallization of sparingly soluble carbonates in space and time. The photogeneration of carbonate in an alkaline environment is achieved upon photo&#8208;decarboxylation of an organic precursor using a conventional 365 nm UV LED. Local irradiation was conducted focusing the LED light on a 300 mm radius spot on a closed glass crystallization cell. The precursor solution was optimized to avoid the precipitation of the photoreaction organic byproducts and prevent photoinduced pH changes to achieve the formation of calcium carbonate only in the corresponding irradiated area. The crystallization was monitored in real&#8208;time by time&#8208;lapse imaging. The method is also shown to work in gels. Similarly, it was also shown to photo&#8208;activate locally the formation of barium carbonate biomorphs. In the last case, the morphology of these biomimetic structures was tuned by changing the irradiation intensity.</dc:description>

Breaking the rules: Thanks to their broad responsiveness, epoxide&#8208;opening ether cyclizations are identified as ideal for the direct comparison of supramolecular catalysts. The results suggest that &#960;&#8208;basic supramolecular capsule catalysts are as outstanding as pnictogen&#8208;bonding catalysts in breaking the Baldwin rules with high diastereoselectivity, particularly in cyclization cascades leading to bicyclic products. In clear contrast, chemo&#8208; and diastereoselective co&#8208; and autocatalysis is confirmed to be unique for anion&#8208;&#960; interactions.







Abstract
While the integration of supramolecular principles in catalysis attracts increasing attention, a direct comparative assessment of the resulting systems catalysts to work out distinct characteristics is often difficult. Herein is reported how the broad responsiveness of ether cyclizations to diverse inputs promises to fill this gap. Cyclizations in the confined, &#960;&#8208;basic and Br&#248;nsted acidic interior of supramolecular capsules, for instance, are found to excel with speed (exceeding general Br&#248;nsted acid and hydrogen&#8208;bonding catalysts by far) and selective violations of the Baldwin rules (as extreme as the so far unique pnictogen&#8208;bonding catalysts). The complementary cyclization on &#960;&#8208;acidic aromatic surfaces remains unique with regard to autocatalysis, which is shown to be chemo&#8208; and diastereoselective with regard to product&#8208;like co&#8208;catalysts but, so far, not enantioselective.

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of 2&#8208;Arylindolines and 2,2&#8208;Disubstituted Indolines by Kinetic Resolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Asymmetric synthesis of 2&#8208;arylindolines was achieved by kinetic resolution with n&#8208;butyllithium and the chiral ligand sparteine followed by electrophilic quench. The recovered starting materials and the 2,2&#8208;disubstituted products were isolated with high enantiomer ratios. Variable temperature NMR spectroscopy and DFT studies were used to determine the rate of Boc rotation.







Abstract
Kinetic resolution of 2&#8208;arylindolines (2,3&#8208;dihydroindoles) was achieved by treatment of their N&#8208;tert&#8208;butoxycarbonyl (Boc) derivatives with n&#8208;butyllithium and sparteine in toluene at &#8722;78&#8201;&#176;C followed by electrophilic quench. The unreacted starting materials together with the 2,2&#8208;disubstituted products could be isolated with high enantiomer ratios. Variable temperature NMR spectroscopy showed that the rate of Boc rotation was fast (&#916;G&#8800;&#8776;57&#8197;kJ/mol at 195&#8197;K). This was corroborated by DFT studies and by in&#8197;situ ReactIR spectroscopy. The enantioenriched N&#8208;Boc&#8208;2&#8208;arylindolines were converted to 2,2&#8208;disubstituted products without significant loss in enantiopurity. Hence, either enantiomer of the 2,2&#8208;disubstituted products could be obtained with high selectivity from the same enantiomer of the chiral ligand sparteine (one from the kinetic resolution and the other from subsequent lithiation&#8208;trapping of the recovered starting material). Secondary amine products were prepared by removing the Boc group with acid to provide a way to access highly enantioenriched 2&#8208;aryl and 2,2&#8208;disubstituted indolines.

         <title>Bipyridinium and Phenanthrolinium Dications for Metal&#8208;Free Hydrodefluorination: Distinctive Carbon&#8208;Based Reactivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of novel organic dications as carbon&#8208;based Lewis acids is reported. The Hydride Ion Affinity (HIA) of these bipyridinium and phenanthrolinium salts is exploited to initiate hydrodefluorination catalysis. Further, the participation of these species enables deuterodefluorination. Experimental and DFT analysis support the role of the dications in the initiation of silylium&#8208;mediated catalysis.







Abstract
The development of novel Lewis acids derived from bipyridinium and phenanthrolinium dications is reported. Calculations of Hydride Ion Affinity (HIA) values indicate high carbon&#8208;based Lewis acidity at the ortho and para positions. This arises in part from extensive LUMO delocalization across the aromatic backbones. Species [C10H6R2N2CH2CH2]2+ (R=H [1&#8201;a]2+, Me [1&#8201;f]2+, tBu [1&#8201;g]2+), and [C12H4R4N2CH2CH2]2+ (R=H [2&#8201;a]2+, Me [2&#8201;b]2+) were prepared and evaluated for use in the initiation of hydrodefluorination (HDF) catalysis. Compound [2&#8201;a]2+ proved highly effective towards generating catalytically active silylium cations via Lewis acid&#8208;mediated hydride abstraction from silane. This enabled the HDF of a range of aryl&#8208; and alkyl&#8208; substituted sp3(C&#8722;F) bonds under mild conditions. The protocol was also adapted to effect the deuterodefluorination of cis&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;(CF3)3C6H9. The dications are shown to act as hydride acceptors with the isolation of neutral species C16H14N2 (3&#8201;a) and C16H10Me4N2 (3&#8201;b) and monocationic species [C14H13N2]+ ([4&#8201;a]+) and [C18H21N2]+ ([4&#8201;b]+). Experimental and computational data provide further support that the dications are initiators in the generation of silylium cations.

The use of Pd@PS, oxalic acid as CO source, and aryl halides was explored first time for aryl ester of 5&#8208;HMF synthesis.

         <dc:description>The development of NIR emitters based on earth&#8208;abundant elements is an important goal in contemporary science. We present here Cr(0), Mo(0) and W(0) carbonyl complexes with a pyridyl&#8208;mesoionic carbene (MIC) based ligand. A detailed photophysical investigation shows that all the complexes exhibit dual emissions in the VIS and in the NIR region. The emissive excited states are assigned to two distinct triplet states by time&#8208;resolved emission and step&#8208;scan FTIR spectroscopy at variable temperature, supported by density functional theory. In particular, the NIR emissive triplet state exhibits unprecedented lifetimes of up to 600 &#177; 10 ns and quantum yields reaching 1.7 &#8729; 10&#8722;4 at room temperature. These are the first examples of Cr(0), Mo(0) and W(0) complexes that emit in the NIR II region.</dc:description>

         <title>Bonding in Barium Boryloxides, Siloxides, Phenoxides and Silazides: A Comparison with the Lighter Alkaline Earths</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Barium and related alkaline&#8208;earth complexes bearing combinations of boryloxides, siloxides, phenoxides and amides have been structurally authenticated. Their structural patterns and bonding properties have been thoroughly investigated by DFT calculations.







Abstract
Barium complexes ligated by bulky boryloxides [OBR2]&#8722; (where R=CH(SiMe3)2, 2,4,6&#8208;iPr3&#8208;C6H2 or 2,4,6&#8208;(CF3)3&#8208;C6H2), siloxide [OSi(SiMe3)3]&#8722;, and/or phenoxide [O&#8208;2,6&#8208;Ph2&#8208;C6H3]&#8722;, have been prepared. A diversity of coordination patterns is observed in the solid state for both homoleptic and heteroleptic complexes, with coordination numbers ranging between 2 and 4. The identity of the bridging ligand in heteroleptic dimers [Ba(&#956;2&#8208;X1)(X2)]2 depends largely on the given pair of ligands X1 and X2. Experimentally, the propensity to fill the bridging position increases according to [OB{CH(SiMe3)2}2)]&#8722;&lt;[N(SiMe3)2]&#8722;&lt;[OSi(SiMe3)3]&#8722;&lt;[O(2,6&#8208;Ph2&#8208;C6H3)]&#8722;&lt;[OB(2,4,6&#8208;iPr3&#8208;C6H2)2]&#8722;. This trend is the overall expression of 3 properties: steric constraints, electronic density and &#963;&#8208; and &#960;&#8208;donating capability of the negatively charged atom, and ability to generate Ba&#8201;&#8901;&#8197;&#8901;&#8197;&#8901;&#8201;F, Ba&#8201;&#8901;&#8197;&#8901;&#8197;&#8901;&#8201;C(&#960;) or Ba&#8201;&#8901;&#8197;&#8901;&#8197;&#8901;&#8201;H&#8722;C secondary interactions.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Barium and related&lt;/b&gt; alkaline-earth complexes bearing combinations of boryloxides, siloxides, phenoxides and amides have been structurally authenticated. Their structural patterns and bonding properties have been thoroughly investigated by DFT calculations.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barium complexes ligated by bulky boryloxides [OBR&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; (where R=CH(SiMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, 2,4,6-&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;Pr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or 2,4,6-(CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), siloxide [OSi(SiMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, and/or phenoxide [O-2,6-Ph&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, have been prepared. A diversity of coordination patterns is observed in the solid state for both homoleptic and heteroleptic complexes, with coordination numbers ranging between 2 and 4. The identity of the bridging ligand in heteroleptic dimers [Ba(&#956;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-X&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)(X&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; depends largely on the given pair of ligands X&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and X&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Experimentally, the propensity to fill the bridging position increases according to [OB{CH(SiMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;lt;[N(SiMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;lt;[OSi(SiMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;lt;[O(2,6-Ph&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;lt;[OB(2,4,6-&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;Pr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;. This trend is the overall expression of 3 properties: steric constraints, electronic density and &#963;- and &#960;-donating capability of the negatively charged atom, and ability to generate Ba&#8201;&#8901;&#8197;&#8901;&#8197;&#8901;&#8201;F, Ba&#8201;&#8901;&#8197;&#8901;&#8197;&#8901;&#8201;C(&#960;) or Ba&#8201;&#8901;&#8197;&#8901;&#8197;&#8901;&#8201;H&#8722;C secondary interactions. The comparison of the structural motifs in the complexes [Ae{&#956;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-N(SiMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}(OB{CH(SiMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (Ae = Mg, Ca, Sr and Ba) suggest that these observations may be extended to all alkaline earths.

         <title>Subphthalocyaninato Boron(III) Hydride: Synthesis, Structure and Reactivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the first time subphthalocyanine&#8208;hydride derivatives that exhibit high reactivity as hydroboration reagents of aldehydes have been prepared. This transformation has proven to be a useful alternative method for the axial functionalisation of dodecafluoro&#8208;subphthalocyanines using electrophiles. Considering the increasing interest in SubPcs as electron&#8208;acceptor semiconductors to replace fullerene in organic photovoltaic devices, it is of the utmost importance to develop new synthetic methodologies for their axial functionalisation.







Abstract
Subphthalocyanine (SubPc) chemistry has been limited so far by their high sensitivity toward strong nucleophiles. In particular, the substitution of the axial chlorine atom by a nucleophilic group in the case of less&#8208;reactive SubPcs, such as those bearing electron&#8208;withdrawing peripheral substituents, presents some limitations and requires harsh conditions. By taking advantage of the electrophilic character of DIBAL&#8208;H, it has been possible to prepare for the first time SubPc&#8208;hydride derivatives that exhibit high reactivity as hydroboration reagents of aldehydes. This hydride transfer requires using a typical carbonyl activator (trimethylsilyl triflate) and only one equivalent of aldehyde, affording SubPcs with an axial benzyloxy group in good yield. This transformation has proven to be a useful alternative method for the axial functionalisation of dodecafluoroSubPc, a paradigmatic SubPc derivative, by using electrophiles for the first time. Considering the increasing interest in SubPcs as electron&#8208;acceptor semiconductors with remarkable absorption in the visible range to replace fullerene in organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices, it is of the utmost importance to develop new synthetic methodologies for their axial functionalisation.

         <title>Chiral Perylene Bisimide Dyes by Interlocked Arene Substituents in the Bay Area</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interlocked &#960;&#8208;&#960;&#8208;stacking motif of bay&#8208;tetraarylated perylene bisimides endows these molecules with chirality and rich conformational isomerism. These structural features are elucidated by X&#8208;ray crystallography and NMR. Optical spectroscopy including CD and CPL provide insights into their functional properties.







Abstract
A series of perylene bisimide (PBI) dyes bearing various aryl substituents in 1,6,7,12 bay positions has been synthesized by Suzuki cross&#8208;coupling reaction. These molecules exhibit an exceptionally large and conformationally fixed twist angle of the PBI &#960;&#8208;core due to the high steric congestion imparted by the aryl substituents in bay positions. Single crystal X&#8208;ray analyses of phenyl&#8208;, naphthyl&#8208; and pyrenyl&#8208;functionalized PBIs reveal interlocked &#960;&#8208;&#960;&#8208;stacking motifs, leading to conformational chirality and the possibility for the isolation of enantiopure atropoisomers by semipreparative HPLC. The interlocked arrangement endows these molecules with substantial racemization barriers of about 120&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1 for the tetraphenyl&#8208; and tetra&#8208;2&#8208;naphthyl&#8208;substituted derivatives, which is among the highest racemization barriers for axially chiral PBIs. Variable temperature NMR studies reveal the presence of a multitude of up to fourteen conformational isomers in solution that are interconverted via smaller activation barriers of about 65&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1. The redox and optical properties of these core&#8208;twisted PBIs have been characterized by cyclic voltammetry, UV/Vis/NIR and fluorescence spectroscopy and their respective atropo&#8208;enantiomers were further characterized by circular dichroism (CD) and circular polarized luminescence (CPL) spectroscopy.

         <title>The Binding Pocket at the Interface of Multimeric Telomere G&#8208;quadruplexes: Myth or Reality?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Binding of naphthalenediimide (NDI) dyads at the interface of contiguous telomeric G&#8208;quadruplexes (G4) in hTel45 is revealed by synergically combining time&#8208;resolved fluorescence, induced circular dichroism and isothermal titration calorimetry and further rationalized with modeling data. In the absence of NMR and crystallographic data the approach used afforded new information that can help to rationalize the biological behavior of these ligands.







Abstract
Human telomeric DNA with hundreds of repeats of the 5&#8217;&#8208;TTAGGG&#8208;3&#8217; motif plays a crucial role in several biological processes. It folds into G&#8208;quadruplex (G4) structures and features a pocket at the interface of two contiguous G4 blocks. Up to now no structural NMR and crystallographic data are available for ligands interacting with contiguous G4s. Naphthalene diimide monomers and dyads were investigated as ligands of a dimeric G4 of human telomeric DNA comparing the results with those of the model monomeric G4. Time&#8208;resolved fluorescence, circular dichroism, isothermal titration calorimetry and molecular modeling were used to elucidate binding features. Ligand fluorescence lifetime and induced circular dichroism unveiled occupancy of the binding site at the interface. Thermodynamic parameters confirmed the hypothesis as they remarkably change for the dyad complexes of the monomeric and dimeric telomeric G4. The bi&#8208;functional ligand structure of the dyads is a fundamental requisite for binding at the G4 interface as only the dyads engage in complexes with 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 stoichiometry, lodging in the pocket at the interface and establishing multiple interactions with the DNA skeleton. In the absence of NMR and crystallographic data, our study affords important proofs of binding at the interface pocket and clues on the role played by the ligand structure.

         <title>Non&#8208;conventional Behavior of a 2,1&#8208;Benzazaphosphole: Heterodiene or Hidden Phosphinidene?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dualistic behavior of the titled 2,1&#8208;benzazaphosphole, behaving as a heterodiene versus a hidden phosphinidene, has been theoretically predicted based on an NTR analysis. This spectacular feature has been proven chemically as well. Thus, it is able to participate in hetero&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reactions forming expected heterocycles, but it also serves as a 4e ligand, using two phosphorus electron lone pairs, bridging two transition metals (Au, Ag and Co).







Abstract
The titled 2,1&#8208;benzazaphosphole (1) (i.&#8201;e. ArP, where Ar=2&#8208;(DippN=CH)C6H4, Dipp=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3) showed a spectacular reactivity behaving both as a reactive heterodiene in hetero&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder (DA) reactions or as a hidden phosphinidene in the coordination toward selected transition metals (TMs). Thus, 1 reacts with electron&#8208;deficient alkynes RC&#8801;CR (R=CO2Me, C5F4N) giving 1&#8208;phospha&#8208;1,4&#8208;dihydro&#8208;iminonaphthalenes 2 and 3, that undergo hydrogen migration producing 1&#8208;phosphanaphthalenes 4 and 5. Compound 1 is also able to activate the C=C double bond in selected N&#8208;alkyl/aryl&#8208;maleimides RN(C(O)CH)2 (R=Me, tBu, Ph) resulting in the addition products 7&#8211;9 with bridged bicyclic [2.2.1] structures. The binding of the maleimides to 1 is semi&#8208;reversible upon heating. By contrast, when 1 was treated with selected TM complexes, it serves as a 4e donor bridging two TMs thus producing complexes [&#956;&#8208;ArP(AuCl)2] (10), [(&#956;&#8208;ArP)4Ag4][X]4 (X=BF4 (11), OTf (12)) and [&#956;&#8208;ArP(Co2(CO)6)] (13). The structure and electron distribution of the starting material 1 as well as of other compounds were also studied from the theoretical point of view.

     alt="Non-conventional Behavior of a 2,1-Benzazaphosphole: Heterodiene or Hidden Phosphinidene?"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The dualistic behavior of the titled 2,1-benzazaphosphole&lt;/b&gt;, behaving as a heterodiene versus a hidden phosphinidene, has been theoretically predicted based on an NTR analysis. This spectacular feature has been proven chemically as well. Thus, it is able to participate in hetero-Diels-Alder reactions forming expected heterocycles, but it also serves as a 4&lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt; ligand, using two phosphorus electron lone pairs, bridging two transition metals (Au, Ag and Co).

         <title>Evolution of a Strategy for the Total Synthesis of (+)&#8208;Cornexistin</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cycle tricks: The evolution of the first total synthesis of (+)&#8208;cornexistin is reported. Highlights of the successful chiral&#8208;pool strategy are an intermolecular Nozaki&#8211;Hiyama&#8211;Kishi coupling to install the Z alkene, a syn&#8208;Evans&#8208;aldol reaction to construct the C2/C3 stereocenters, an intramolecular allylic alkylation to close the nine&#8208;membered carbocycle and the stepwise hydrolysis of a &#946;&#8208;keto nitrile, which furnished the maleic anhydride.







Abstract
Herein is given a full account of the evolution of the first total synthesis of (+)&#8208;cornexistin. Initial efforts were based on masking the reactive maleic anhydride moiety as a 3,4&#8208;substituted furan and on forming the nine&#8208;membered carbocycle in an intramolecular Conia&#8208;ene or Nozaki&#8211;Hiyama&#8211;Kishi (NHK) reaction. Those strategies suffered from low yields and were jeopardized by a late&#8208;stage installation of the Z&#8208;alkene, as well as the stereocenters along the eastern periphery. These issues were addressed by employing a chiral&#8208;pool strategy that involved construction of the crucial stereocenters at C2, C3 and C8 at an early stage with installation of the maleic anhydride as late as possible. The successful approach featured an intermolecular NHK coupling to install the Z&#8208;alkene, a syn&#8208;Evans&#8208;aldol reaction to forge the stereocenters along the eastern periphery, an intramolecular allylic alkylation to close the nine&#8208;membered carbocycle, and a challenging stepwise hydrolysis of a &#946;&#8208;keto nitrile to furnish the maleic anhydride.

         <title>Acylhydrazone Subunits as a Proton Cargo Delivery System in 7&#8208;Hydroxyquinoline</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dropping your H&#8242;s: Two structurally different acylhydrazones containing imine (1&#8201;a) and ketimine (2&#8201;a) functions have been evaluated as proton cargo delivery subunits in the 7&#8208;hydroxyquinoline platform. The tautomeric OH proton was delivered to the quinoline nitrogen by covalent (1&#8201;a) and hydrogen (2&#8201;a) bonding. The system is characterized by long stability in the switched state, thus enabling control of the bidirectional proton motion under different light energy.







Abstract
The reimagined concept of long&#8208;range tautomeric proton transfer using crane subunits is shown by designing and synthesising two new acylhydrazones containing a 7&#8208;hydroxyquinoline (7&#8208;OHQ) platform. The acylhydrazone subunits attached to the 7&#8208;OHQ at the 8th position act as crane arms for delivering proton cargo to the quinoline nitrogen. Light&#8208;induced tautomerization to their keto forms leads to Z/E isomerization of the C=C axle bond, followed by proton delivery to the quinoline nitrogen by the formation of covalent or hydrogen bonds. The axle&#8216;s being either an imine or ketimine bond is the structural difference between the studied compounds. The &#8722;CH3 group in the latter provides steric strain, resulting in different proton transport pathways. Both compounds show long thermal stability in the switched state, which creates a tuneable action of bidirectional proton cargo transport by using different wavelengths of irradiation. Upon the addition of acid, the quinoline nitrogen is protonated; this results in E/Z configuration switching of the acylhydrazone subunits. This was proven by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structure analysis and NMR spectroscopy.

         <title>The Deuterated &#8220;Magic Methyl&#8221; Group: A Guide to Site&#8208;Selective Trideuteromethyl Incorporation and Labeling by Using CD3 Reagents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#8220;3 D&#8221; drug development: The deuterated &#8220;magic methyl&#8221; group is attracting increased interest in pharmaceutical industry. In this review, we discuss the currently available methods for C&#8722;CD3 bond forming reactions and classify them according to the trideuteromethylation reagent. The mechanisms, scope and limitations of each method are considered in order to provide a guide for targeted trideutermethylation.







Abstract
In the field of medicinal chemistry, the precise installation of a trideuteromethyl group is gaining ever&#8208;increasing attention. Site&#8208;selective incorporation of the deuterated &#8220;magic methyl&#8221; group can provide profound pharmacological benefits and can be considered an important tool for drug optimization and development. This review provides a structured overview, according to trideuteromethylation reagent, of currently established methods for site&#8208;selective trideuteromethylation of carbon atoms. In addition to CD3, the selective introduction of CD2H and CDH2 groups is also considered. For all methods, the corresponding mechanism and scope are discussed whenever reported. As such, this review can be a starting point for synthetic chemists to further advance trideuteromethylation methodologies. At the same time, this review aims to be a guide for medicinal chemists, offering them the available C&#8722;CD3 formation strategies for the preparation of new or modified drugs.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&#8220;3 D&#8221; drug development&lt;/b&gt;: The deuterated &#8220;magic methyl&#8221; group is attracting increased interest in pharmaceutical industry. In this review, we discuss the currently available methods for C&#8722;CD&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; bond forming reactions and classify them according to the trideuteromethylation reagent. The mechanisms, scope and limitations of each method are considered in order to provide a guide for targeted trideutermethylation.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the field of medicinal chemistry, the precise installation of a trideuteromethyl group is gaining ever-increasing attention. Site-selective incorporation of the deuterated &#8220;magic methyl&#8221; group can provide profound pharmacological benefits and can be considered an important tool for drug optimization and development. This review provides a structured overview, according to trideuteromethylation reagent, of currently established methods for site-selective trideuteromethylation of carbon atoms. In addition to CD&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, the selective introduction of CD&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H and CDH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; groups is also considered. For all methods, the corresponding mechanism and scope are discussed whenever reported. As such, this review can be a starting point for synthetic chemists to further advance trideuteromethylation methodologies. At the same time, this review aims to be a guide for medicinal chemists, offering them the available C&#8722;CD&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; formation strategies for the preparation of new or modified drugs.&lt;/p&gt;

The application of mechanical force to a material can lead to the generation of electric charge; piezoelectricity. For the first time, this effect has been harnessed and applied to radical reactions under ball&#8208;milling conditions, this Concept briefly describes the first appearances of this ground&#8208;breaking technique in the literature.







Abstract
Recent research endeavors have established that the mechanochemical activation of piezoelectric materials can open new avenues in redox chemistry. Impact forces, such as those imparted by a ball mill, have been shown to transform piezoelectric materials such as barium titanate (BaTiO3) into a highly polarized state, which can then donate an electron to a suitable oxidant and receive an electron from a suitable reductant, mimicking established photoredox catalytic cycles. Proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept studies have elucidated that mechanoredox chemistry holds great potential in sustainable and efficient radical&#8208;based synthesis.

Gold catalysis and a one&#8208;pot process gives glowing parasite killers. A gold&#8208;catalyzed cycloisomerization with concomitant 1,2&#8208;silyl shift forms 6&#8208;(trimethylsilyl)indolo[3,2&#8208;a]phenazines, which furnish 6&#8208;aryl&#8208;indolo[3,2&#8208;a]phenazines in a concise one&#8208;pot ipso&#8208;iodination&#8208;Suzuki coupling sequence. Structure&#8208;property relationships reveal a novel class of tunable luminophores, which also efficiently kill the parasite T.&#8197;gondii.







Abstract
A gold&#8208;catalyzed cycloisomerization of 2&#8208;indolyl&#8208;3&#8208;[(trimethylsilyl)ethynyl)]quinoxalines with concomitant 1,2&#8208;silyl shift forms 6&#8208;(trimethylsilyl)indolo[3,2&#8208;a]phenazines in moderate to excellent yield. These silylated heterocycles are readily transformed into 6&#8208;aryl&#8208;indolo[3,2&#8208;a]phenazines in moderate to good yield by one&#8208;pot ipso&#8208;iodination Suzuki coupling. The title compounds represent a novel type of tunable luminophore. Structure&#8208;property relationships for 6&#8208;aryl&#8208;indolo[3,2&#8208;a]phenazines obtained from Hammett correlations with &#963;p+ substituent parameters indicate that emission maxima, Stokes shifts, and fluorescence quantum yields can be fine&#8208;tuned by the remote para&#8208;aryl substituent. Furthermore, indolo[3,2&#8208;a]phenazines were found to exhibit interesting activities against medically relevant pathogens such as the Apicomplexa parasite Toxoplasma gondii with an IC50 of up to 0.67&#177;0.13&#8197;&#956;M. Thus, these compounds are promising candidates for novel anti&#8208;parasitic therapies.

         <title>Confinement inside a Crystalline Sponge Induces Pyrrole To Form N&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; Bonded Tetramers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 38, Page 9814-9819, July 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An external driving force from the confined space of a crystalline sponge resulted in a reorientation of the N&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interaction among pyrrole molecules. Such a confinement effect led to the formation of pyrrole dimers and also unprecedented clusters of cyclic tetramers. These results were verified by both single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography and computational methods.







Abstract
Based on the DFT&#8208;level&#8208;calculated molecular volume (Vmol) of pyrrole and its liquid density, pyrrole manifests the highest liquid density coefficient LDc (defined as [Vmol&#215;density &#215;0.6023]/FW) value of 0.7. Normal liquids have LDc &lt;0.63. This very high LDc is due to the strong N&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions in solution, and hence pyrrole can be considered to be a pseudo&#8208;crystalline liquid. When trapped inside the confined space of a crystalline sponge, a reorientation of the N&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interaction is observed leading to specific cyclic N&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; tetramers and N&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; dimers, as verified by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallographic and computational methods. These tetramers are of the same size as four pyrrole molecules in the solid&#8208;state of pyrrole, yet the cyclic N&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; intermolecular interactions are circularly oriented instead of being in the linear zigzag structure found in the X&#8208;ray structure of a solid pyrrole. The confinement thus acts as an external driving force for tetramer formation.

New route: Investigation of the phosphanide addition to alkynes revealed that the ring size can be controlled during the cyclization step leading either to phospholes or phosphetes starting from the same reactants.







Abstract
A transition metal free route to phosphetes featuring an exocyclic alkene unit is presented. In this approach phosphanides are added to a variety of diynes generating phosphaallylic intermediates which depending on the reaction conditions transform either to phosphetes or the corresponding phospholes. Investigation of the reaction mechanism by combined quantum chemical and experimental means identifies phosphole formation as thermodynamically controlled reaction path, whereas kinetic control furnishes the corresponding phosphetes. Structural and luminescence properties of the rare class of phosphetes are explored, as well as for selected key intermediates.

         <title>Ruthenium&#8208;Catalyzed Deuteration of Aromatic Carbonyl Compounds with a Catalytic Transient Directing Group</title>

Everything is transient: The combination of a ruthenium catalyst with amines enables the C&#8722;H activation and deuteration of aromatic carbonyl compounds in a general manner. Using D2O as a convenient source of deuterium, high deuteration levels were achieved and the application of this methodology for the preparation of deuterated pharmaceuticals was demonstrated.







Abstract
A novel ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H activation methodology for hydrogen isotope exchange of aromatic carbonyl compounds is presented. In the presence of catalytic amounts of specific amine additives, a transient directing group is formed in&#8197;situ, which directs selective deuteration. A high degree of deuteration is achieved for &#945;&#8208;carbonyl and aromatic ortho&#8208;positions. In addition, appropriate choice of conditions allows for exclusive labeling of the &#945;&#8208;carbonyl position while a procedure for the preparation of merely ortho&#8208;deuterated compounds is also reported. This methodology proceeds with good functional group tolerance and can be also applied for deuteration of pharmaceutical drugs. Mechanistic studies reveal a kinetic isotope effect of 2.2, showing that the C&#8722;H activation is likely the rate&#8208;determining step of the catalytic cycle. Using deuterium oxide as a cheap and convenient source of deuterium, the methodology presents a cost&#8208;efficient alternative to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art iridium&#8208;catalyzed procedures.

         <title>Fundamental Characterization, Photophysics and Photocatalysis of a Base Metal Iron(II)&#8208;Cobalt(III) Dyad</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 38, Page 9905-9918, July 7, 2021. </description>

Keeping it simple: A new dyad that is active in photocatalytic proton reduction employing only base metals has been achieved. It connects a tetra&#8208;NHC&#8208;FeII photosensitizer with a CoIII cobaloxime catalyst. The photocatalytic activity is explained by comparison to the equivalent two&#8208;component system and thorough ground&#8208; and excited&#8208;state characterization.







Abstract
A new base metal iron&#8208;cobalt dyad has been obtained by connection between a heteroleptic tetra&#8208;NHC iron(II) photosensitizer combining a 2,6&#8208;bis[3&#8208;(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene]pyridine with 2,6&#8208;bis(3&#8208;methyl&#8208;imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene)&#8208;4,4&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine ligand, and a cobaloxime catalyst. This novel iron(II)&#8208;cobalt(III) assembly has been extensively characterized by ground&#8208; and excited&#8208;state methods like X&#8208;ray crystallography, X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, (spectro&#8208;)electrochemistry, and steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved optical absorption spectroscopy, with a particular focus on the stability of the molecular assembly in solution and determination of the excited&#8208;state landscape. NMR and UV/Vis spectroscopy reveal dissociation of the dyad in acetonitrile at concentrations below 1&#8197;mM and high photostability. Transient absorption spectroscopy after excitation into the metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer absorption band suggests a relaxation cascade originating from hot singlet and triplet MLCT states, leading to the population of the 3MLCT state that exhibits the longest lifetime. Finally, decay into the ground state involves a 3MC state. Attachment of cobaloxime to the iron photosensitizer increases the 3MLCT lifetime at the iron centre. Together with the directing effect of the linker, this potentially makes the dyad more active in photocatalytic proton reduction experiments than the analogous two&#8208;component system, consisting of the iron photosensitizer and Co(dmgH)2(py)Cl. This work thus sheds new light on the functionality of base metal dyads, which are important for more efficient and sustainable future proton reduction systems.

         <title>Self&#8208;supporting Atmosphere&#8208;Assisted Synthesis of 1D Mo2C&#8208;based Catalyst for Efficient Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 38, Page 9866-9875, July 7, 2021. </description>

A very fine catalyst: A 1D catalyst consisting of ultrafine Mo2C nanoparticles and nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon has been fabricated for the hydrogen evolution reaction. Self&#8208;supporting gases play a vital role in building the 1D and porous structure of the materials, which facilitates charge and mass transfer during the catalytic process. The optimized catalyst exhibits a superior overpotential and Tafel slope.







Abstract
One&#8208;dimensional materials exhibit fascinating properties in electrocatalytic applications but their fabrication faces the challenge of tedious and complicated operations. We have developed a bottom&#8208;up strategy to construct a 1D metal carbide catalyst (Mo2C@NC) consisting of ultrafine Mo2C nanoparticles embedded within nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon layers by simply calcining a mixture of ammonium molybdate, urea and melamine. Experimental results and thermodynamic calculations demonstrate that the retainable pyrolysis&#8208;generated self&#8208;supporting atmosphere plays a crucial role in the crystalline phase and morphology of materials. When functioned as an electrocatalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), the achieved Mo2C@NC presents an excellent catalytic activity as well as outstanding stability. This work could shed fresh light onto the facile synthesis of effective HER catalysts with 1D nanostructure.

         <title>Quantitative Structure&#8208;Property Relationship Modelling for the Prediction of Singlet Oxygen Generation by Heavy&#8208;Atom&#8208;Free BODIPY Photosensitizers**
</title>

         <dc:description>
Data on singlet oxygen generation for a library of heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free BODIPYs undergoing spin&#8208;orbit charge transfer intersystem crossing (SOCT&#8208;ISC) were used to build quantitative structure&#8208;property relationship (QSPR) predictive models. These models estimate quantum yields of singlet oxygen (1O2) generation for a given photosensitizer structure in nonpolar, moderately polar and highly polar solvent. This allows for virtual screening of environment&#8208;activatable BODIPY photosensitizers and hence speeding up the development of new lead compounds for photomedicine.







Abstract
Heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free sensitizers forming long&#8208;living triplet excited states via the spin&#8208;orbit charge transfer intersystem crossing (SOCT&#8208;ISC) process have recently attracted attention due to their potential to replace costly transition metal complexes in photonic applications. The efficiency of SOCT&#8208;ISC in BODIPY donor&#8208;acceptor dyads, so far the most thoroughly investigated class of such sensitizers, can be finely tuned by structural modification. However, predicting the triplet state yields and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation quantum yields for such compounds in a particular solvent is still very challenging due to a lack of established quantitative structure&#8208;property relationship (QSPR) models. In this work, the available data on singlet oxygen generation quantum yields (&#934;&#916;) for a dataset containing &gt;70 heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free BODIPY in three different solvents (toluene, acetonitrile, and tetrahydrofuran) were analyzed. In order to build reliable QSPR model, a series of new BODIPYs were synthesized that bear different electron donating aryl groups in the meso position, their optical and structural properties were studied along with the solvent dependence of singlet oxygen generation, which confirmed the formation of triplet states via the SOCT&#8208;ISC mechanism. For the combined dataset of BODIPY structures, a total of more than 5000 quantum&#8208;chemical descriptors was calculated including quantum&#8208;chemical descriptors using density functional theory (DFT), namely M06&#8208;2X functional. QSPR models predicting &#934;&#916; values were developed using multiple linear regression (MLR), which perform significantly better than other machine learning methods and show sufficient statistical parameters (R=0.88&#8211;0.91 and q2=0.62&#8211;0.69) for all three solvents. A small root mean squared error of 8.2&#8201;% was obtained for &#934;&#916; values predicted using MLR model in toluene. As a result, we proved that QSPR and machine learning techniques can be useful for predicting &#934;&#916; values in different media and virtual screening of new heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free BODIPYs with improved photosensitizing ability.

         <title>Copper(II) Pyridyl Aminophenolates: Hypoxia&#8208;Selective, Nucleus&#8208;Targeting Cytotoxins, and Magnetic Resonance Probes</title>

Fluorine&#8208;labelled CuII complexes have been developed as hypoxia&#8208;targeting chemotherapeutics and MRI agents. Tuning the electronic properties identified a nitro&#8208;substituted complex as having hypoxia&#8208;selective cytotoxicity driven by nuclear accumulation and DNA cleavage. 19F magnetic resonance experiments discriminate between CuII and reduced complexes, thus demonstrating a bifunctional role for CuII complexes as both hypoxia probes and chemotherapeutic agents.







Abstract
Targeting the low&#8208;oxygen (hypoxic) environments found in many tumours by using redox&#8208;active metal complexes is a strategy that can enhance efficacy and reduce the side effects of chemotherapies. We have developed a series of CuII complexes with tridentate pyridine aminophenolate&#8208;based ligands for preferential activation in the reduction window provided by hypoxic tissues. Furthermore, ligand functionalization with a pendant CF3 group provides a 19F spectroscopic handle for magnetic&#8208;resonance studies of redox processes at the metal centre and behaviour in cellular environments. The phenol group in the ligand backbone was substituted at the para position with H, Cl, and NO2 to modulate the reduction potential of the CuII centre, giving a range of values below the window expected for hypoxic tissues. The NO2&#8208;substituted complex, which has the highest reduction potential, showed enhanced cytotoxic selectivity towards HeLa cells grown under hypoxic conditions. Cell death occurs by apoptosis, as determined by analysis of the cell morphology. A combination of 19F NMR and ICP&#8208;OES indicates localization of the NO2 complex in HeLa cell nuclei and increased cellular accumulation under hypoxia. This correlates with DNA nuclease activity being the likely origin of cytotoxic activity, as demonstrated by cleavage of DNA plasmids in the presence of the CuII nitro complex and a reducing agent. Selective detection of the paramagnetic CuII complexes and their diamagnetic ligands by 19F MRI suggests hypoxia&#8208;targeting theranostic applications by redox activation.

         <title>A Rapid and Mild Sulfation Strategy Reveals Conformational Preferences in Therapeutically Relevant Sulfated Xylooligosaccharides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 38, Page 9830-9838, July 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Preparation of the largest homogeneous persulfated xylooligomers reported to date is facilitated by a rapid and quantitative one&#8208;pot sulfation protocol based on the in&#8197;situ generation of SO3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;DMF. The synthesized oligosaccharide standards afforded unique structural insights into persulfated xylooligomers, including a 1C4 conformational preference for all associated non&#8208;reducing pyranosyl residues. Application of the method to the synthesis of a sulfated pyridyl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;xylotriose also enabled identification of a pyridinium contaminant in a commercial sample of pentosan polysulfate, a widely&#8208;deployed sulfated xylooligosaccharide&#8208;based therapy.







Abstract
Although sulfated xylooligosaccharides are promising therapeutic leads for a multitude of afflictions, the structural complexity and heterogeneity of commercially deployed forms (e.&#8201;g. Pentosan polysulfate 1) complicates their path to further clinical development. We describe herein the synthesis of the largest homogeneous persulfated xylooligomers prepared to date, comprising up to eight xylose residues, as standards for biological studies. Near quantitative sulfation was accomplished using a remarkably mild and operationally simple protocol which avoids the need for high temperatures and a large excess of the sulfating reagent. Moreover, the sulfated xylooligomer standards so obtained enabled definitive identification of a pyridinium contaminant in a sample of a commercially prepared Pentosan drug and provided significant insights into the conformational preferences of the constituent persulfated monosaccharide residues. As the spatial distribution of sulfates is a key determinant of the binding of sulfated oligosaccharides to endogenous targets, these findings have broad implications for the advancement of Pentosan&#8208;based treatments.

         <title>Selective Production of Linear Aldehydes and Alcohols from Alkenes using Formic Acid as Syngas Surrogate</title>

Effective methods for producing linear aldehydes or alcohols selectively with formic acid as both carbon monoxide and hydrogen source have been described. Linear&#8208;selective hydroformylation of alkenes proceeds smoothly in the presence of a single Rh catalyst, strikingly, the dual Rh/Ru catalysts accomplish efficient and regioselective hydroxymethylation in one pot. Both protocols operate simply and avoid using flammable and toxic syngas, which represents a sustainable approach for the preparation of value&#8208;added compounds.







Abstract
Performing carbonylation without the use of carbon monoxide for high&#8208;value&#8208;added products is an attractive yet challenging topic in sustainable chemistry. Herein, effective methods for producing linear aldehydes or alcohols selectively with formic acid as both carbon monoxide and hydrogen source have been described. Linear&#8208;selective hydroformylation of alkenes proceeds smoothly with up to 88&#8201;% yield and &gt;30 regioselectivity in the presence of single Rh catalyst. Strikingly, introducing Ru into the system, the dual Rh/Ru catalysts accomplish efficient and regioselective hydroxymethylation in one pot. The present processes utilizing formic acid as syngas surrogate operate simply under mild condition, which opens a sustainable way for production of linear aldehydes and alcohols without the need for gas cylinders and autoclaves. As formic acid can be readily produced via CO2 hydrogenation, the protocols represent indirect approaches for chemical valorization of CO2.

         <title>Multifunctional Heterometallic IrIII&#8722;AuI Probes as Promising Anticancer and Antiangiogenic Agents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 38, Page 9885-9897, July 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A golden opportunity: Cytotoxic and green&#8208;emissive orthometallated IrIII&#8208;AuI complexes have been synthesised. For some of the complexes, trafficking between the lysosomes and mitochondria in A549 cells can be suggested. Disruption of the mitochondrial membrane potential was observed as well as an apoptotic cell death mechanism. Angiogenic assays reveal that the complexes have good prospects as antimetastatic agents.







Abstract
A new class of emissive cyclometallated IrIII&#8722;AuI complexes with a bis(diphenylphosphino) methanide bridging ligand was successfully synthesised from the diphosphino complex [Ir(N^C)2(dppm)]+ (1). The different gold ancillary ligand, a triphenylphosphine (2), a chloride (3) or a thiocytosine (4) did not reveal any significant effect on the photophysical properties, which are mainly due to metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge&#8208;transfer (3MLCT) transitions based on IrIII. However, the AuI fragment, along with the ancillary ligand, seemed crucial for the bioactivity in A549 lung carcinoma cells versus endothelial cells. Both cell types display variable sensitivities to the complexes (IC50=0.6&#8211;3.5&#8197;&#956;M). The apoptotic pathway is activated in all cases, and paraptotic cell death seems to take place at initial stages in A549 cells. Species 2&#8211;4 showed at least dual lysosomal and mitochondrial biodistribution in A549 cells, with an initial lysosomal localisation and a possible trafficking process between both organelles with time. The bimetallic IrIII&#8722;AuI complexes disrupted the mitochondrial transmembrane potential in A549 cells and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) inhibition in comparison with that displayed by the monometallic complex 1. Angiogenic activity assays performed in endothelial cells revealed the promising antimetastatic potential of 1, 2 and 4.

         <title>Coexistence of Two Different Distorted Octahedral [MnF6]3&#8722; Sites in K3[MnF6]: Manifestation in Spectroscopy and Magnetism</title>

Distorted octahedra: Using a high&#8208;temperature/high&#8208;pressure synthesis, K3[MnF6] with two different kinds of distorted [MnF6]3&#8722; octahedra &#8211; a pseudo&#8208;rhombic and an pseudo&#8208;tetragonally elongated distorted octahedron &#8211; was structurally, magnetically and spectroscopically characterized. A theoretical interpretation of the electronic structure and molecular geometry is given.







Abstract
As a consequence of the static Jahn&#8208;Teller effect of the 5E ground state of MnIII in cubic structures with octahedral parent geometries, their octahedral coordination spheres become distorted. In the case of six fluorido ligands, [MnF6]3&#8722; anions with two longer and four shorter Mn&#8722;F bonds making elongated octahedra are usually observed. Herein, we report the synthesis of the compound K3[MnF6] through a high&#8208;temperature approach and its crystallization by a high&#8208;pressure/high&#8208;temperature route. The main structural motifs are two quasi&#8208;isolated, octahedron&#8208;like [MnF6]3&#8722; anions of quite different nature compared to that met in ideal octahedral MnIII Jahn&#8208;Teller systems. Owing to the internal electric field of Ci symmetry dominated by the next&#8208;neighbour K+ ions acting on the MnIII sites, both sites, the pseudo&#8208;rhombic (site 1) and the pseudo&#8208;tetragonally elongated (site 2) [MnF6]3&#8722; anions are present in K3[MnF6]. The compound was characterized by single&#8208;crystal and powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, and magnetometry as well as by FTIR, Raman, and ligand field spectroscopy. A theoretical interpretation of the electronic structure and molecular geometry of the two Mn sites in the lattice is given by using a vibronic coupling model with parameters adjusted from multireference ab&#8208;initio cluster calculations.

         <title>Rapidly Adaptive All&#8208;covalent Nanoparticle Surface Engineering</title>

Acetal&#8208;terminated surface ligands stabilize idealized colloidal nanoparticle building blocks. On&#8208;demand activation of the masked aldehyde functionality occurs rapidly under mild conditions with precise stoichiometric control, revealing a versatile platform for all&#8208;covalent post&#8208;synthesis surface engineering. On&#8208;surface dynamic covalent transformations lead to diverse structural and functional modifications including rapidly adaptive environment&#8208;responsive nanomaterials.







Abstract
Emerging nanotechnologies demand the manipulation of nanoscale components with the same predictability and programmability as is taken for granted in molecular synthetic methodologies. Yet installing appropriately reactive chemical functionality on nanomaterial surfaces has previously entailed compromises in terms of reactivity scope, functionalization density, or both. Here, we introduce an idealized dynamic covalent nanoparticle building block for divergent and adaptive post&#8208;synthesis modification of colloidal nanomaterials. Acetal&#8208;protected monolayer&#8208;stabilized gold nanoparticles are prepared via operationally simple protocols and are stable to long&#8208;term storage. Tunable surface densities of reactive aldehyde functionalities are revealed on&#8208;demand, leading to a wide range of adaptive surface engineering options from one nanoscale synthon. Analytically tractable with molecular precision, interfacial reaction kinetics and dynamic surface constitutions can be probed in&#8197;situ at the ensemble level. High functionalization densities combined with rapid equilibration kinetics enable environmentally adaptive surface constitutions and rapid nanoparticle property switching in response to simple chemical effectors.

         <title>Vacant Manganese&#8208;Based Perovskite Fluorides@Reduced Graphene Oxides for Na&#8208;Ion Storage with Pseudocapacitive Conversion/Insertion Dual Mechanisms</title>

Some like it hot or cold: A novel dual&#8208;vacancy manganese&#8208;based perovskite fluoride@reduced graphene oxide (rGO) was synthesized in one&#8208;pot, and its structure&#8208;activity relationship was analyzed by physical characterization and electrochemical methods. Ex&#8208;situ techniques were used to analyze the pseudo&#8208;capacitance conversion/intercalation dual Na&#8208;ion energy storage mechanisms. Finally, assembled Na&#8208;ion capacitors and Na&#8208;based dual&#8208;ion batteries showed good electrochemical performance at high (40&#8201;&#176;C) or low (&#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C) temperature.







Abstract
Na&#8208;ion capacitors (NICs) and Na&#8208;based dual&#8208;ion batteries (Na&#8208;DIBs) have been considered to be promising alternatives to traditional lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) because of the abundance and low cost of the Na&#8208;ion, but their energy density, power density and life cycle are limited. Herein, dual&#8208;vacancy (including K+ and F&#8722; vacancies) perovskite fluoride K0.86MnF2.69@reduced graphene oxide (rGO; recorded as Mn&#8722;G) as anode for NICs and Na&#8208;DIBs has been developed. The special conversion/intercalation dual Na&#8208;ion energy storage mechanism and pseudocapacitive dynamics are analyzed in detail. The Mn&#8722;G//AC NICs and Mn&#8722;G//KS6 Na&#8208;DIBs delivered a maximum energy density of 92.7 and 187.6&#8197;W&#8201;h&#8201;kg&#8722;1, a maximum power density of 20.2 and 21.12&#8197;kW&#8201;kg&#8722;1, and long cycle performance of 61.3 and 68.4&#8201;% after 1000&#8197;cycles at 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, respectively. Moreover, Mn&#8722;G//AC NICs and Mn&#8722;G//KS6 Na&#8208;DIBs can work well over a wide range of temperatures (&#8722;20 to 40&#8201;&#176;C). These results make it competitive in Na&#8208;ion storage applications with high energy/power density over a wide temperature range.

Shutting off shuttling: An N, O, P&#8208;doped HPC has been synthesized from PBPP to generate effective polysulfide&#8208;trapping interlayers in lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries. Together with conductive agents, the HPC provides chemisorption and physical confinement, suppressing the shuttle effect and protecting lithium anodes. The resulting lithium&#8208;sulfur battery exhibits significantly enhanced electrochemical performance including capacity, cycle stability and rate capability.







Abstract
The shuttling of polysulfides is the most detrimental contribution to degrading the capacity and cycle stability of lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) batteries. Adding a carbon interlayer to prevent the polysulfides from migrating is feasible, and a rational design of the structures and surface properties of the carbon layer is essential to increasing its effectiveness. Herein, we report a hierarchical porous carbon (HPC) created by carbonization of bis(phenoxy)phosphazene and in&#8208;situ doping of triple heteroatoms into the carbon lattice to fabricate an effective polysulfide&#8208;trapping interlayer. The generated carbon integrates the advantages of a hierarchical porous structure, a high specific area and rich dopants (N, O and P), to yield chemisorption and physical confinement for polysulfides and fast ion&#8208;transport synergistically. The HPC interlayer significantly improves the electrochemical performance of Li&#8722;S batteries, including an exceptional discharge capacity of 1509&#8197;mA h/g at 0.06&#8197;C and a high capacity retention of 83.7&#8201;% after 250&#8197;cycles at 0.3&#8197;C. This work thus proposes a facile in&#8208;situ synthesis of heteroatom&#8208;doped carbon with rational porous structures for suppressing the shuttle effect.

The HPC interlayer significantly improves the electrochemical performance of Li&#8722;S batteries, including an exceptional discharge capacity of 1509&#8197;mA h/g at 0.06&#8197;C and a high capacity retention of 83.7&#8201;% after 250&#8197;cycles at 0.3&#8197;C. This work thus proposes a facile in-situ synthesis of heteroatom-doped carbon with rational porous structures for suppressing the shuttle effect.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>The Versatile Electronic, Magnetic and Photo&#8208;Electro Catalytic Activity of a New 2D MA2Z4 Family**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 38, Page 9925-9933, July 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Theoretical explorations of the MA2Z4 family (M is Ti, Zr, Hf, V, Nb, Ta, Cr, Mo, W, A refers to Si or Ge, and Z is N, P or As) indicate that they exhibit diverse electronic properties that varies from non&#8208;magnetic, anti&#8208;ferromagnetic, to ferromagnetic semiconductors, metals and half&#8208;metals, as well as interesting catalytic potential for electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution and photocatalytic water splitting. These fascinating properties will intrigue the interest of experimental synthesis.







Abstract
The recent successful growth of MoSi2N4 and WSi2N4 monolayers led to the discovery of a new class of the two&#8208;dimensional (2D) MA2Z4 materials with no known 3D layered allotropes, which renders great possibilities to integrate diverse properties by proper design of sandwiched &#8220;MZ2&#8221; building blocks and &#8220;A&#8722;Z&#8221; passivation layers. In this work, the dynamic stability, electronic properties, and surface reactivity of the new MA2Z4 family, in which M is Ti, Zr, Hf, V, Nb, Ta, Cr, Mo, W, A refers to Si or Ge, and Z is N, P or As, is theoretically probed. Among the proposed 54 possible combinations, about 42 compositions are dynamically stable, which vary from non&#8208;magnetic, anti&#8208;ferromagnetic, to ferromagnetic semiconductors, metals and half&#8208;metals. In particular, the VB (V, Nb, Ta) MA2Z4 possesses robust intrinsic ferromagnetism that is essential for spintronics applications. In regard to surface activity, most MA2Z4, particularly N&#8208; or P&#8208;terminated IVB and VB MA2Z4, have high catalytic potential for hydrogen evolution, and the &#9653;GH of non&#8208;magnetic MA2Z4 is highly correlated to the highest occupied p electronic states of the surface Z atoms. The photocatalytic activity is also evaluated. MoSi2N4 and WSi2N4 within 4&#8201;% tensile strain are capable of photocatalytic overall water splitting. The findings indicate the new 2D MA2Z4 family has fascinating properties and possesses strong potential for applications but not limited to electronics, spintronics and catalysts, which will stimulate the interests of experimental synthesis.

         <title>CoS2/N&#8208;Doped Hollow Spheres as an Anode Material for High&#8208;Performance Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

Good cycle stability: CoS2/S@N&#8208;HCS, prepared by sulfuration on polyacrylic acid spheres, exhibits high capacity and long life when used as an anode material for sodium&#8208;ion batteries. CoS2/S@N&#8208;HCS&#8242;s capacity undergoes a decreasing&#8208;increasing&#8208;stabilizing process related to the dissolution of sulfur during charge and discharge. The sodium storage mechanism and reaction kinetics of the material were measured by EIS, XRD, and GITT.







Abstract
In this work, we first synthesized polyacrylic acid (PAA) spheres and then used PAA as a template to load Co(OH)2 particles onto its surface. The product of CoS2 nanoparticles dispersed in N&#8208;doped hollow spheres (N&#8208;HCS) was prepared through sulfurization treatment (CoS2/S@N&#8208;HCS). During the sulfuration process, sulfur penetrates into the PAA, embedding into the graphite layer along with the carbonization process. It was found that during the charging and discharging process, the sulfur in the carbon layer will gradually dissolve out, thereby forming new ion diffusion channels in the carbon spheres and exposing more CoS2 active sites. The CoS2/S@N&#8208;HCS composite exhibits a specific capacity of 729.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 500&#8197;cycles at a current density of 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. The sodium&#8208;storage mechanism and reaction kinetics of the materials were further measured by in&#8208;situ electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, ex&#8208;situ X&#8208;ray diffraction, capacitance performance evaluation, and galvanostatic intermittent titration technique. The excellent cycling performance and rate capability demonstrated that the CoS2/S@N&#8208;HCS is a potential and prospective anode material for sodium&#8208;ion batteries.

The ternary metal oxide semiconducting multilayer structure of composition [In2O3//SnO2//Al2O3] is accessible by an atomic layer deposition (ALD) approach. Oxygen deficiency in these ALD derived thin films can be effectively manipulated and controlled by adding a distinct number of alumina monolayers. Besides its semiconducting behavior, the incorporation of the alumina monolayers alters the light stability of the semiconducting multilayer thin film in a thin film transistor device under illumination in the radiation range between 300&#8211;600&#8197;nm.







Abstract
Multilayered heterostructures comprising of In2O3, SnO2, and Al2O3 were studied for their application in thin&#8208;film transistors (TFT). The compositional influence of tin oxide on the properties of the thin&#8208;film, as well as on the TFT characteristics is investigated. The heterostructures are fabricated by atomic layer deposition (ALD) at 200&#8201;&#176;C, employing trimethylindium (TMI), tetrakis(dimethylamino)tin (TDMASn), trimethylaluminum (TMA), and water as precursors. After post&#8208;deposition annealing at 400&#8201;&#176;C the thin&#8208;films are found to be amorphous, however, they show a discrete layer structure of the individual oxides of uniform film thickness and high optical transparency in the visible region. Incorporation of only two monolayers of Al2O3 in the active semiconducting layer the formation of oxygen vacancies can be effectively suppressed, resulting in an improved semiconducting and switching behavior. The heterostacks comprising of In2O3/SnO2/Al2O3 are incorporated into TFT devices, exhibiting a saturation field&#8208;effect mobility (&#956;sat) of 2.0&#8197;cm2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, a threshold&#8208;voltage (Vth) of 8.6&#8197;V, a high current on/off ratio (IOn/IOff) of 1.0&#215;107, and a subthreshold swing (SS) of 485&#8197;mV&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;dec&#8722;1. The stability of the TFT under illumination is also altered to a significant extent. A change in the transfer characteristic towards conductive behavior is evident when illuminated with light of an energy of 3.1&#8197;eV (400&#8197;nm).

         <title>One&#8208;Step Template/Solvent&#8208;Free Pyrolysis for In Situ Immobilization of CoP Nanoparticles onto N and P Co&#8208;Doped Carbon Porous Nanosheets towards High&#8208;efficiency Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>

         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;step scalable template/solvent&#8208;free pyrolysis strategy for in&#8197;situ immobiliziation of CoP nanoparticles with high uniformity and dispersity onto N and P co&#8208;doped carbon porous nanosheets, is demonstrated. Thanks to the compositional and structural advantages, the prepared CoP@N,P&#8208;CNSs sample exhibits outstanding electrocatalytic HER performance and extraordinary long&#8208;term stability in alkaline medium.







Abstract
The search for economical, active and stable electrocatalysts towards the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is highly imperative for the progression of water electrolysis technology and related sustainable energy conversion technologies. The delicate optimization of chemical composition and architectural configuration is paramount to design high&#8208;efficiency non&#8208;precious metal HER electrocatalysts. Herein, we report a one&#8208;step scalable template/solvent&#8208;free pyrolysis approach for in&#8197;situ immobilizing uniform CoP nanoparticles onto N and P co&#8208;doped carbon porous nanosheets (denoted as CoP@N,P&#8208;CNSs hereafter). The simultaneous consideration of architectural design and nanocarbon hybridization renders the formed CoP@N,P&#8208;CNSs with plentiful well&#8208;dispersed anchored active sites, shortened pathway for mass diffusion, enhanced electric conductivity, and reinforced mechanical stability. As a consequence, the optimized CoP@N,P&#8208;CNSs exhibit an overpotential of 115&#8197;mV to afford a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, small Tafel slope of 74.2&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1, high Faradaic efficiency of nearly 100&#8201;%, and superb long&#8208;term durability in an alkaline medium. Given the fabrication feasibility, mass production potential and outstanding HER performance, the CoP@N,P&#8208;CNSs may hold great promise for large&#8208;scale electrochemical water splitting. More importantly, the explored one&#8208;step template/solvent&#8208;free pyrolysis methodology offers a feasible and versatile route to fabricate carbon nanosheet&#8208;based nanocomposites for diverse energy conversation&#8208;related applications.

         <title>Axial Ligand Coordination Tuning of the Electrocatalytic Activity of Iron Porphyrin Electrografted onto Carbon Nanotubes for the Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 38, Page 9898-9904, July 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A time&#8208;saving electrografting method (within a couple of minutes) for the covalent functionalization of carbon nanotube surfaces with an imidazole or thiophene ligand that is axially coordinated with iron porphyrin as electrocatalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) has been demonstrated. The N&#8208;imidazole&#8208;coordinated catalyst, MWCNT&#8208;Im&#8208;FeF20TPP, exhibited the highest ORR activity followed by the S&#8208;thiophene and O&#8208;carboxylate axially coordinated catalysts.







Abstract
The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is essential in many life processes and energy conversion systems. It is desirable to design transition metal molecular catalysts inspired by enzymatic oxygen activation/reduction processes as an alternative to noble&#8208;metal&#8208;Pt&#8208;based ORR electrocatalysts, especially in view point of fuel cell commercialization. We have fabricated bio&#8208;inspired molecular catalysts electrografted onto multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) in which 5,10,15,20&#8208;tetra(pentafluorophenyl) iron porphyrin (iron porphyrin FeF20TPP) is coordinated with covalently electrografted axial ligands varying from thiophene to imidazole on the MWCNTs&#8217; surface. The catalysts&#8217; electrocatalytic activity varied with the axial coordination environment (i.&#8201;e., S&#8208;thiophene, N&#8208;imidazole, and O&#8208;carboxylate); the imidazole&#8208;coordinated catalyst MWCNTs&#8208;Im&#8208;FeF20TPP exhibited the highest ORR activity among the prepared catalysts. When MWCNT&#8208;Im&#8208;FeF20TPP was loaded onto the cathode of a zinc&#8722;air battery, an open&#8208;cell voltage (OCV) of 1.35&#8197;V and a maximum power density (Pmax) of 110&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 were achieved; this was higher than those of MWCNTs&#8208;Thi&#8208;FeF20TPP (OCV=1.30&#8197;V, Pmax=100&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and MWCNTs&#8208;Ox&#8208;FeF20TPP (OCV=1.28&#8197;V, Pmax=86&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and comparable with a commercial Pt/C catalyst (OCV=1.45&#8197;V, Pmax=120&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2) under similar experimental conditions. This study provides a time&#8208;saving method to prepare covalently immobilized molecular electrocatalysts on carbon&#8208;based materials with structure&#8211;performance correlation that is also applicable to the design of other electrografted catalysts for energy conversion.

Bis(4&#8208;benzhydryl&#8208;benzoxazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)methane (4&#8722;BzhH2BoxCH2) provides a versatile platform for monomeric ligands in [M(4&#8208;BzhH2BoxCH)] (M=Na, K) and dimeric [{M(4&#8208;BzhH2BoxCH)}2] (M=K, Rb, Cs) alkali metal complexes. Even more remarkable the reaction of 4&#8722;BzhH2BoxCH2 with three equivalents KH and two equivalents 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 yields polymeric [{(THF)2K@(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)}{K@(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)K(4&#8208;BzhH2BoxCH)}]n (n&#8594;&#8734;), containing a trianionic ligand. While the monoanions only provide N,N&#8208;chelation like NacNac the latter trianion potentially provides C,N,N,C&#8208;chelation and should be another promising ligand platform.







Abstract
A novel sterically demanding bis(4&#8208;benzhydryl&#8208;benzoxazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)methane ligand 6 (4&#8722;BzhH2BoxCH2) was gained in a straightforward six&#8208;step synthesis. Starting from this ligand monomeric [M(4&#8208;BzhH2BoxCH)] (M=Na (7), K (81)) and dimeric [{M(4&#8208;BzhH2BoxCH)}2] (M=K (82), Rb (9), Cs (10)) alkali metal complexes were synthesised by deprotonation. Abstraction of the potassium ion of 8 by reaction with 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 resulted in the solvent separated ion pair [{(THF)2K@(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)}{bis(4&#8208;benzhydryl&#8208;benzoxazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)methanide}] (11), including the energetically favoured monoanionic (E,E)&#8208;(4&#8208;BzhH2BoxCH) ligand. Further reaction of 4&#8722;BzhH2BoxCH2 with three equivalents KH and two equivalents 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 yielded polymeric [{(THF)2K@(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)}{K@(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)K(4&#8208;BzhBoxCH)}]n (n&#8594;&#8734;) (12) containing a trianionic ligand. The neutral ligand and herein reported alkali complexes were characterised by single X&#8208;ray analyses identifying the latter as a promising precursor for low&#8208;valent main group complexes.

         <title>Frontispiece: Synthetic Approaches for 15N&#8208;Labeled Hyperpolarized Heterocyclic Molecular Imaging Agents for 15N NMR Signal Amplification by Reversible Exchange in Microtesla Magnetic Fields</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 38, July 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Signal amplification by reversible exchange enables efficient nitrogen&#8208;15 hyperpolarization of a wide range of bio&#8208;compatible substrates by using microtesla magnetic fields. This process is enabled by simulatenous exchange of parahydrogen (the source of polarization) and the N&#8208;containing biocompatible molecule to be hyperpolarized. Selected advances in the 15N enrichment of pyridine and imidazole derivatives that can potentially be employed as novel molecular contrast agents are summarized in the Minireview by N.&#8194;V. Chukanov, E.&#8197;Y. Chekmenev et&#8197;al. on page&#8197;9727&#8197;ff.

         <dc:description>
Recent research endeavors have established that the mechanochemical activation of piezoelectric materials can open new avenues in redox chemistry. The application of mechanical force to a material can lead to the generation of electric charge; piezoelectricity. For the first time, this effect has been harnessed and applied to radical reactions under ball&#8208;milling conditions. For more information, see the Concept article by J.&#8197;A. Leitch and D.&#8197;L. Browne on page&#8197;9721.

         <title>Front Cover: Ruthenium&#8208;Catalyzed Deuteration of Aromatic Carbonyl Compounds with a Catalytic Transient Directing Group (Chem. Eur. J. 38/2021)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 38, Page 9716-9716, July 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
In a joint endeavor, a ruthenium catalyst and a catalytic amine enable the deuteration of aromatic aldehydes and ketones using cheap and convenient D2O as deuterium source. The amine serves as a transient directing group, forming imines in situ and thus facilitating coordination of the ruthenium catalyst to the substrates. The practical applicability of this novel methodology is demonstrated by the successful deuteration of a range of (hetero)aromatic carbonyl compounds as well as pharmaceuticals. More information can be found in the Full Paper by H. Neumann, M. Beller, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202100468).

New superheroes in town: Fluorescent Indolo[3,2&#8208;a]phenazines fight against T. gondii. Indolo[3,2&#8208;a]phenazines are a novel type of multifunctional heterocycle. They are tunable luminophores and highly biologically active. Furthermore, their photophysical characteristics correlate with Hammett &#963;p+ substituent parameters allowing finetuning of excited state properties such as emission maxima, Stokes shifts, and fluorescence quantum yields, by the remote para&#8208;aryl substitution. Best of all, they are highly active at low concentration against medically relevant pathogens such as the Apicomplexa parasite Toxoplasma gondii with IC50 up to 0.67&#177;0.13&#956;M. Therefore, these heterocyclic superheroes are promising bug fighters in novel anti&#8208;parasitic therapies. More information can be found in the Full Paper by T.&#8197;J.&#8197;J. M&#252;ller et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101391).

Lesser is better: Multilayered heterostructures comprising of In2O3, SnO2, and one or two atomic layers of Al2O3 were studied for their application in thin&#8208;film transistors (TFT). The cover image centers around the fabrication of a multilayer thin film oxide aggregate which works as semiconductor in a transistor device. It is composed of different layers of SnO2, In2O3 and Al2O3 fabricated using atomic layer deposition (ALD) technique which employs the reaction of suitable organometallic precursors with water, all of which originate from the gas phase from an individual molecular source (left upper side). The rainbow reflects the stability of the material against illumination. The background depicts the universal binary 0/1 code representing the every&#8208;day use of transistors in our modern society. More information can be found in the Full Paper by J.&#8197;J.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lesser is better&lt;/b&gt;: Multilayered heterostructures comprising of In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and one or two atomic layers of Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; were studied for their application in thin-film transistors (TFT). The cover image centers around the fabrication of a multilayer thin film oxide aggregate which works as semiconductor in a transistor device. It is composed of different layers of SnO2, In2O3 and Al2O3 fabricated using atomic layer deposition (ALD) technique which employs the reaction of suitable organometallic precursors with water, all of which originate from the gas phase from an individual molecular source (left upper side). The rainbow reflects the stability of the material against illumination. The background depicts the universal binary 0/1 code representing the every-day use of transistors in our modern society.

         <title>Synthetic Approaches for 15N&#8208;Labeled Hyperpolarized Heterocyclic Molecular Imaging Agents for 15N NMR Signal Amplification by Reversible Exchange in Microtesla Magnetic Fields</title>

Getting hyper: This minireview provides a selective overview of 15N&#8208;labeling approaches for the preparation of contrast agents hyperpolarized by using the SABRE&#8208;SHEATH technique. This technique employs parahydrogen as a fast and inexpensive means to produce hyperpolarized biocompatible contrast agents for molecular imaging applications.







Abstract
NMR hyperpolarization techniques enhance nuclear spin polarization by several orders of magnitude resulting in corresponding sensitivity gains. This enormous sensitivity gain enables new applications ranging from studies of small molecules by using high&#8208;resolution NMR spectroscopy to real&#8208;time metabolic imaging in&#8197;vivo. Several hyperpolarization techniques exist for hyperpolarization of a large repertoire of nuclear spins, although the 13C and 15N sites of biocompatible agents are the key targets due to their widespread use in biochemical pathways. Moreover, their long T1 allows hyperpolarized states to be retained for up to tens of minutes. Signal amplification by reversible exchange (SABRE) is a low&#8208;cost and ultrafast hyperpolarization technique that has been shown to be versatile for the hyperpolarization of 15N nuclei. Although large sensitivity gains are enabled by hyperpolarization, 15N natural abundance is only &#8764;0.4&#8201;%, so isotopic labeling of the molecules to be hyperpolarized is required in order to take full advantage of the hyperpolarized state. Herein, we describe selected advances in the preparation of 15N&#8208;labeled compounds with the primary emphasis on using these compounds for SABRE polarization in microtesla magnetic fields through spontaneous polarization transfer from parahydrogen. Also, these principles can certainly be applied for hyperpolarization of these emerging contrast agents using dynamic nuclear polarization and other techniques.

         <title>Versatile Coordination of AgI and CuI Ions towards cyclo&#8208;As5 Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 38, Page 9742-9747, July 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first homoleptic AgI and CuI coordination compounds of the cyclo&#8208;As5 complex [(Cp*Fe(&#951;5&#8208;As5)] (B) are obtained from its reaction with the M[FAl{OC6F10(C6F5)}3] (M(FAl); M=Ag, Cu) salts. Varying the ratio of the starting materials is reflected in a diversity of the isolated supramolecular assemblies (1, 3, 4) as products. The coordination mode of the cyclo&#8208;As5 units in each of 1, 3 and 4 is different revealing the pronounced adaptive coordination of B towards AgI ions.







Abstract
The reactions of the cyclo&#8208;As5 complex [Cp*Fe(&#951;5&#8208;As5)] (B) with the AgI and CuI salts of the weakly coordinating anion (WCA) [FAl{OC6F10(C6F5)}3]&#8722; ([FAl]&#8722;) are studied. These reactions allow the synthesis of the mononuclear complexes [M(&#951;5&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;2&#8208;B)2][FAl] (M=Ag (1), Cu (2)) when a ratio of B/M(FAl) 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 is used. Compound 1 shows an unusual disorder of the central AgI cation between two &#960;&#8208;coordinating cyclo&#8208;As5 ligands, which is absent in 2 pointing to a weak interaction of the Ag center towards the cyclo&#8208;As5 ligands in B. When the ratio of B/Ag(FAl) is changed to 3&#8201;:&#8201;1 or 1&#8201;:&#8201;1, the respective coordination compounds [Ag(&#951;2&#8208;B)3][FAl] (3) and [Ag2(&#951;2&#8201;:&#8201;&#951;2&#8208;B)2][FAl]2 (4) are accessible. The coordination modes of the cyclo&#8208;As5 units in 1, 3 and 4 are all different, reflecting the adaptive coordination behavior of B towards AgI ions. The optimized geometries in the gas phase of 1&#8211;4 are determined by DFT calculations to support the bonding situation observed in their solid&#8208;state structures.

A systematic exploration of the reachable chemical space for guaianes is provided by DFT calculations that show that 1,3&#8208;hydride migrations are exceptional events in guaiane biosynthesis. They are only possible for stereochemically distinct skeletons and open the way to unusual guaianes. The relevance of a 1,3&#8208;hydride shift for guai&#8208;4(15)&#8208;en&#8208;11&#8208;ol synthase from poplar was shown experimentally by isotopic labeling.







Abstract
A systematic computational study addressing the entire chemical space of guaianes in conjunction with an analysis of all known compounds shows that 1,3&#8208;hydride shifts are rare events in guaiane biosynthesis. As demonstrated here, 1,3&#8208;hydride shifts towards guaianes can only be realized for two stereochemically well defined out of numerous possible stereoisomeric skeletons. One example is given by the mechanism of guaia&#8208;4(15)&#8208;en&#8208;11&#8208;ol synthase from California poplar, an enzyme that yields guaianes with unusual stereochemical properties. The general results from DFT calculations were experimentally verified through isotopic&#8208;labeling experiments with guaia&#8208;4(15)&#8208;en&#8208;11&#8208;ol synthase.

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Aerobic Oxidative Cleavage of Alkyl Aldehydes: Synthesis of Ketones, Esters, Amides, and &#945;&#8208;Ketoamides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 38, Page 9737-9741, July 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A widely applicable approach was developed to synthesize synthesis of ketones, esters, amides via oxidative C&#8722;C bond cleavage of alkyl aldehydes. Green and abundant molecular oxygen (O2) was used as the oxidant, and base metals (cobalt and copper) were used as the catalysts. In addition, the same strategy can be extended to the one&#8208;pot synthesis of ketones from primary alcohols and &#945;&#8208;ketoamides from aldehydes.

A widely applicable approach was developed to synthesize ketones, esters, amides via the oxidative C&#8722;C bond cleavage of readily available alkyl aldehydes. Green and abundant molecular oxygen (O2) was used as the oxidant, and base metals (cobalt and copper) were used as the catalysts. This strategy can be extended to the one&#8208;pot synthesis of ketones from primary alcohols and &#945;&#8208;ketoamides from aldehydes.

         <title>Organophotocatalytic Aerobic Oxygenation of Phenols in a Visible&#8208;Light Continuous&#8208;Flow Photoreactor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 38, Page 9748-9752, July 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The design of a customized continuous&#8208;flow photoreactor enabled a highly efficient aerobic oxygenation of phenols to provide benzoquinones and p&#8208;quinols. By using pressurized air as oxidant, ecologically benign solvents and low amounts of methylene blue as organophotocatalyst in combination with hyper red LEDs, excellent selectivity values and yields were obtained. The method is expected to improve sustainability for the production of a variety of crucial products and intermediates.







Abstract
A mild photocatalytic phenol oxygenation enabled by a continuous&#8208;flow photoreactor using visible light and pressurized air is described herein. Products for wide&#8208;ranging applications, including the synthesis of vitamins, were obtained in high yields by precisely controlling principal process parameters. The reactor design permits low organophotocatalyst loadings to generate singlet oxygen. It is anticipated that the efficient aerobic phenol oxygenation to benzoquinones and p&#8208;quinols contributes to sustainable synthesis.

         <title>Structural, Magnetic and Catalytic Properties of a New Vacancy Ordered Perovskite Type Barium Cobaltate BaCoO2.67</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 38, Page 9763-9767, July 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new charge ordered oxygen deficient perovskite in barium cobaltate system is reported with bifunctional catalytic activity for oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution comparable to that to that benchmark perovskite catalyst BSCF.







Abstract
A new vacancy ordered, anion deficient perovskite modification with composition of BaCoO2.67 (Ba3Co3O8&#9633;1) has been prepared via a two&#8208;step heating process. Combined Rietveld analysis of neutron and X&#8208;ray powder diffraction data shows a novel ordering of oxygen vacancies not known before for barium cobaltates. A combination of neutron powder diffraction, magnetic measurements, and density functional theory (DFT) studies confirms G&#8208;type antiferromagnetic ordering. From impedance measurements, the electronic conductivity of the order of 10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 is determined. Remarkably, the bifunctional catalytic activity for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is found to be comparable to that of Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3&#8211;y, confirming that charge&#8208;ordered anion deficient non&#8208;cubic perovskites can be highly efficient catalysts.

         <title>Cs4B4O3F10: First Fluorooxoborate with [BF4] Involving Heteroanionic Units and Extremely Low Melting Point</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 38, Page 9753-9757, July 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new congruently melting borate Cs4B4O3F10 has been synthesized as the first fluorooxoborate with [BF4] involving heteroanionic units, which possesses two highly fluorinated anionic clusters and therefore its formula can be expressed as Cs3(B3O3F6)&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;Cs(BF4). More importantly, Cs4B4O3F10 shows the lowest melting point among all the available borates and thus sets a new record for such system.







Abstract
Herein, a new congruently melting mixed&#8208;anion compound Cs4B4O3F10 has been characterized as the first fluorooxoborate with [BF4] involving heteroanionic units. Compound Cs4B4O3F10 possesses two highly fluorinated anionic clusters and therefore its formula can be expressed as Cs3(B3O3F6)&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;Cs(BF4). The influence of [BF4] units on micro&#8208;symmetry and structural evolution was discussed based on the parent compound. More importantly, Cs4B4O3F10 shows the lowest melting point among all the available borates and thus sets a new record for such system. This work is of great significance to enrich and tailor the structure of borates using perfluorinated [BF4] units.

         <title>ChemBead Enabled High&#8208;Throughput Cross&#8208;Electrophile Coupling Reveals a New, Complementary Ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;throughput experimentation (HTE) methods are central to modern medicinal chemistry. While many HTE approaches to C&#8208;N and Csp  2  &#8208;Csp  2  &#160;bonds are available, options for Csp  2  &#8208;Csp  3  &#160;bonds are limited. We report here how the adaptation of nickel&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;electrophile coupling of aryl bromides with alkyl halides to HTE is enabled by AbbVie ChemBeads technology. Using this approach, we were able to quickly map out the reactivity space at a global level using a challenging array of 3 &#215; 222 micromolar reactions. The observed hit rate (56%) is competitive with other often&#8208;used HTE reactions and the results are scalable. A key to this level of success was the finding that bipyridine 6&#8208;carboxamidine (BpyCam), a ligand that had not previously been shown to be optimal in any reaction, is as general as the best&#8208;known ligands with complementary reactivity. Such &#8220;cryptic&#8221; catalysts may be common and modern HTE methods should facilitate the process of finding these catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorescent Molecular Logic Gates Driven by Temperature and by Protons in Solution and on Solid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Temperature&#8208;driven fluorescent NOT logic is demonstrated by exploiting predissociation in a 1,3,5&#8208;trisubstituted &#916;  2  &#8208;pyrazoline on its own and when grafted onto silica microparticles. Related &#916;  2  &#8208;pyrazolines become proton&#8208;driven YES and NOT logic gates on the basis of fluorescent PET (photoinduced electron transfer) switches. Additional PASS 1 and YES + PASS 1 logic gates on silica are also demonstrated within the same family. Beside these small&#8208;molecule systems, a polymeric molecular thermometer based on a benzofurazan&#8208;derivatized N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide copolymer is attached to silica to produce temperature&#8208;driven fluorescent YES logic.</dc:description>

         <title>Variations in Complementary Hydrogen Bonds Direct Assembly Patterns of Isosteric Polyheteroaromatics at Surfaces</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Intermolecular interactions guide self&#8208;assembly on the surface. Precise control over these interactions by rational design of the molecule should allow fine control over the self&#8208;assembly patterns. Functional groups installed for electronic modulation often induce significant changes in the molecular dimensions, thereby disrupting the original assembly pattern. To overcome this challenge, we have employed a family of isosteric phenazine derivatives,  DHP  ,  DAP  , and  DBQD  , to investigate the impacts of hydrogen bonding on two&#8208;dimensional molecular self&#8208;assembly. While these molecules are similar in size and chemical composition, the strength and directionality of hydrogen bonding differ significantly depending on the chemical structure of donor&#8211;acceptor pairs and prototropic tautomerization from positional isomerism. Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) characterization of the assembled structures on Ag(111), Au(111), and Cu(100) surfaces revealed that minimal changes in molecular structure have a profound impact on the self&#8208;assembly patterns. While  DHP  exhibits highly ordered and robust assemblies,  DAP  and  DBQD  show either spatially confined or ill&#8208;defined assemblies. In conjunction with hydrogen bonding, prototropic tautomerism is a potent strategy to modulate molecular 2D lattices on surfaces.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly sensitive fluorescent pH microsensors based on HPTS molecules immobilized on silica microparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>HPTS is a remarkably interesting pH sensitive dye that has been used for plenty of applications. Its high quantum yield and extremely sensitive ratiometric fluorescence against pH change makes it a very favorable for pH sensing applications and development of pH nano/microsensors. However, its strong negative charge and lack of easily modifiable functional groups makes it difficult to be used with charged substrates such as silica. This study reports a noncovalent HPTS immobilization methodology on silica microparticles that considers the retention of pH sensitivity as well as long term stability of the pH microsensors. The study emphasizes on importance of surface charge for governing the sensitivity of the immobilized HPTS dye molecules on silica microparticles. Importance of methodology of immobilization that preserves the sensitivity as well as stability of the microsensors is also assessed.</dc:description>

         <title>Multi&#8208;Level Chirality Transferring from Amino Acid Derivatives to CPL&#8208;Active Nanoparticles in Aqueous Medium</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chirality at different levels is widely observed in nature, but the clue to connect them together, and the way how the chirality transfers among different levels are still obscure. Herein, we constructed a L&#8208;/D&#8208;lysine&#8208;based self&#8208;assembly system, in which two&#8208;step chirality transferring among three different levels was observed in aqueous solution. The chirality was originated from the point chirality of amino acid derivatives L&#8208;/D&#8208;PyLys hydrochlorides, and transferred to the planar conformational chirality of water&#8208;soluble pillar[5]arene pR&#8208;/pS&#8208;WP5. Then, with the aid of pR&#8208;/pS&#8208;WP5, nanoparticles were formed that exhibited L&#8208;/R&#8208;handed circularly polarized luminescence with a dissymmetry factor up to &#177;0.001, arising from pyrene excimers arranged in the chiral manner. This multi&#8208;level chirality transferring not only provides a perspective to trace potential clue, and to pursue certain way by which the chirality transfers, but also offers a strategy to arise the controllable CPL emission in aqueous medium.</dc:description>

         <title>Syntheses, Structures, Reactivities, and Basicities of Quinolinyl and Isoquinolinyl Complexes of an Electron Rich Chiral Rhenium Fragment and Their Electrophilic Addition Products</title>

         <dc:description>Reactions of Li+&#160;[(&#951;5&#8208;C5H5)Re(NO)(PPh3)]&#8211;&#160;with 2&#8208; and 4&#8208;chloroquinoline or 1&#8208;chlo&#173;roisoquinoline give the corresponding &#963;&#160;quinolinyl and isoquinolinyl complexes  3,  6, and  8. With  3  and  8  there is further protonation to yield HCl adducts, but additions of KH give the free bases. Treatment of  3  with HBF4&#183;OEt2  or H(OEt2)2+  BArf&#8211;  gives the quinolinium salts [(&#951;5  &#8208;C5H5)Re(NO)(PPh3)(C(NH)C(CH)4C(CH)(CH))]+  X&#8211;  &#160;(3&#8208;H+&#160;X&#8211;; X&#8211; = BF4&#8211;/BArf&#8211;, 94&#8208;98%). Ad&#173;dition of CF3SO3CH3&#160;to  3,  6, or  8  affords the corresponding  N  &#8208;methyl quinolinium salts. In the case of [(&#951;5&#8208;C5H5)Re(NO)(PPh3)(C(NCH3)C(CH)4C(CH)(CH))]+&#160;CF3SO3&#8211;&#160;(3&#8208;CH3+&#160;CF3S&#173;O3&#8211;), addition of CH3Li gives the dihydroquinolinium complex (SReRC,RReSC)&#8208;[(&#951;5&#8208;C5H5)Re&#173;(NO)(PPh3)(C(NCH3)C(CH)4C(CHCH3)(CH2))]+&#160;CF3SO3&#8211;&#160;((SReRC,RReSC)&#8208;5+&#160;CF3SO3&#8211;, 76%) in diastereomerically pure form. Crystal structures of  3&#8208;H+&#160;BArf&#8211;,  3&#8208;CH3+&#160;CF3SO3&#8211;, (SReRC,RReSC)&#8208;5+&#160;Cl&#8211;, and  6&#8208;CH3+&#160;CF3SO3&#8211;&#160;show that the quinolinium ligands adopt Re&#8230;C conforma&#173;tions that maximize overlap of their acceptor orbitals with the rhenium fragment HOMO, minim&#173;ize steric interactions with the bulky PPh3&#160;ligand, and promote various&#160;&#960;&#160;interactions. NMR ex&#173;periments establish the Br&#248;nsted basicity order  3  &gt;  8  &gt;  6, with&#160;Ka(BH+) values &gt;10 orders of magnitude greater than the parent heterocycles, although they remain less active nucleophilic ca&#173;talysts in the reactions tested. DFT calculations provide additional insights regarding Re&#8230;C bonding and conformations, basicities, and the stereochemistry of CH3Li addition.</dc:description>

In the case of [(&#951;5-C5H5)Re(NO)(PPh3)(C(NCH3)C(CH)4C(CH)(CH))]+&#160;CF3SO3&#8211;&#160;(3-CH3+&#160;CF3S&#173;O3&#8211;), addition of CH3Li gives the dihydroquinolinium complex (SReRC,RReSC)-[(&#951;5-C5H5)Re&#173;(NO)(PPh3)(C(NCH3)C(CH)4C(CHCH3)(CH2))]+&#160;CF3SO3&#8211;&#160;((SReRC,RReSC)-5+&#160;CF3SO3&#8211;, 76%) in diastereomerically pure form. Crystal structures of  3-H+&#160;BArf&#8211;,  3-CH3+&#160;CF3SO3&#8211;, (SReRC,RReSC)-5+&#160;Cl&#8211;, and  6-CH3+&#160;CF3SO3&#8211;&#160;show that the quinolinium ligands adopt Re&#8230;C conforma&#173;tions that maximize overlap of their acceptor orbitals with the rhenium fragment HOMO, minim&#173;ize steric interactions with the bulky PPh3&#160;ligand, and promote various&#160;&#960;&#160;interactions. NMR ex&#173;periments establish the Br&#248;nsted basicity order  3  &amp;gt;  8  &amp;gt;  6, with&#160;Ka(BH+) values &amp;gt;10 orders of magnitude greater than the parent heterocycles, although they remain less active nucleophilic ca&#173;talysts in the reactions tested. DFT calculations provide additional insights regarding Re&#8230;C bonding and conformations, basicities, and the stereochemistry of CH3Li addition.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cell&#8208;Penetrating Mitochondrion&#8208;Targeting Ligands for the Universal Delivery of Small Molecules, Proteins and Nanomaterials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Paving the way for future targeted therapy with a variety of biological agents. Cell&#8208;penetrating mitochondrion&#8208;targeting ligands are capable of universal mitochondrial delivery of small molecules, proteins and nanomaterials. Upon successful cellular delivery and rapid endosome escape, the released native cargos were found to be predominantly localized inside mitochondria. The successful delivery of doxorubicin (a well&#8208;known anticancer drug) showed that the released drug possessed potent cell cytotoxicity, disrupted mitochondrial membrane potential and finally led to apoptosis.







Abstract
Mitochondria are key organelles that perform vital cellular functions such as those related to cell survival and death. The targeted delivery of different types of cargos to mitochondria is a well&#8208;established strategy to study mitochondrial biology and diseases. Of the various existing mitochondrion&#8208;transporting vehicles, most suffer from poor cytosolic entry, low delivery efficiency, limited cargo types, and cumbersome preparation protocols, and none was known to be universally applicable for mitochondrial delivery of different types of cargos (small molecules, proteins, and nanomaterials). Herein, two new cell&#8208;penetrating, mitochondrion&#8208;targeting ligands (named MitoLigand) that are capable of effectively &#8220;tagging&#8221; small&#8208;molecule drugs, native proteins and nanomaterials are disclosed, as well as their corresponding chemoselective conjugation chemistry. Upon successful cellular delivery and rapid endosome escape, the released native cargos were found to be predominantly localized inside mitochondria. Finally, by successfully delivering doxorubicin, a well&#8208;known anticancer drug, to the mitochondria of HeLa cells, we showed that the released drug possessed potent cell cytotoxicity, disrupted the mitochondrial membrane potential and finally led to apoptosis. Our strategy thus paves the way for future mitochondrion&#8208;targeted therapy with a variety of biologically active agents.

The synthesis of sterically hindered persistent sila&#8208; and germacyclopentadienyl radicals adds magnetic properties to these heterocyclic ring systems and sparks the idea of their possible application as building blocks for molecular magnets (pictured as red&#8208;blueish northern light). Support comes from the analysis of the EPR spectroscopic parameters and of their computed spin density &#8208; shown here for the silicon species &#8208; that indicate localization of the unpaired electron at the heteroatom.

         <title>Molecular Gears: From Solution to Surfaces</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Moving up a gear: Molecular gears have been explored since the early 1980s, but only in solution, which is intrinsically limited to intramolecular gearing motions. To propagate mechanical power from one molecule to the next, it is necessary to immobilize cogwheels in a dedicated spatial arrangement, such as in a train of gears on a surface. In the last years, some impressive progress has been made, leading to the correlated rotation of up to three molecules.







Abstract
This review highlights the major efforts devoted to the development of molecular gears over the past 40&#8197;years, from pioneering covalent bis&#8208;triptycyl systems undergoing intramolecular correlated rotation in solution, to the most recent examples of gearing systems anchored on a surface, which allow intermolecular transmission of mechanical power. Emphasis is laid on the different strategies devised progressively to control the architectures of molecular bevel and spur gears, as intramolecular systems in solution or intermolecular systems on surfaces, while aiming at increased efficiency, complexity and functionality.

         <title>Contributions of Internal Atoms of Atomically Precise Metal Nanoclusters to Catalytic Performances</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Analyzing the sum of the parts: It is challenging to determine explicitly which atom(s) contribute most to overall catalytic performance because the observed performance reflects an ensemble average from all the atoms in the catalyst. This review provides a new perspective on understanding the crucial roles of internal atoms of atomically precise metal nanocluster catalysts in tuning the catalytic properties.







Abstract
Every atom of a heterogeneous catalyst can play a direct or indirect role in its overall catalytic properties. However, it is extremely challenging to determine explicitly which atom(s) of a catalyst can contribute most to its catalytic performance because the observed performance usually reflects an average of all the atoms in the catalyst. The emergence of atomically precise metal nanoclusters brings unprecedented opportunities to address these central issues, as the crystal structures of such nanoclusters have been solved, and hence very fundamental understanding of nanocatalysis can be attained at an atomic level. This minireview focuses on recent efforts to reveal the contributions of the internal atoms or vacancies of nanocluster catalysts to the catalytic processes, including how the catalytic activity can be dramatically changed by the central doping of a foreign atom, how catalytic activation and inactivation can be reversibly switched by shuttling the central atom into and out of nanoclusters, and how evolution in catalytic activity can be driven by structural periodicity in the inner kernels of the nanoclusters. We anticipate that progress in this research area could represent a novel conceptual framework for understanding the crucial roles of internal atoms of the catalysts in tuning the catalytic properties.

         <title>Porous Anionic Co(II) Metal&#8208;Organic Framework, with a High Density of Amino Groups, as a Superior Luminescent Sensor for Turn&#8208;on Al(III) Detection</title>

Al3+ sensor: A 3D porous anionic MOF displays superior turn&#8208;on sensing for Al(III) ions with ultralow sensitivity resulted from stronger interactions with free amines by employing strategic design principle. The detection approach is simple, fast, portable and economic as demonstrated by MOF filter paper tests for naked eye observation.







Abstract
Accumulation of high concentrations of Al(III) in body has a direct impact on health and therefore, the trace detection of Al(III) has been a matter for substantial concern. An anionic metal organic framework ({[Me2NH2]0.5[Co(DATRz)0.5(NH2BDC)]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;xG}n; 1; HDATRz=3,5&#8208;diamino&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazole, H2NH2&#8208;BDC=2&#8208;amino&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzenedicarboxylic acid, G=guest molecule) composed of two types of secondary building units (SBU) and channels of varying sizes was synthesized by employing a rational design mixed ligand synthesis approach. Free &#8722;NH2 groups on both the ligands are immobilized onto the pore surface of the MOF which acts as a superior luminescent sensor for turn&#8208;on Al(III) detection. Furthermore, the large channels could allow the counter&#8208;ions to pass through and get exchanged to selectively detect Al(III) in presence of other seventeen metal ions with magnificent luminescence enhancement. The observed limit of detection is as low as 17.5&#8197;ppb, which is the lowest among the MOF&#8208;based sensors achieved so far. To make this detection approach simple, portable and economic, we demonstrate MOF filter paper test for real time naked eye observation.

Free &#8722;NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; groups on both the ligands are immobilized onto the pore surface of the MOF which acts as a superior luminescent sensor for turn-on Al(III) detection. Furthermore, the large channels could allow the counter-ions to pass through and get exchanged to selectively detect Al(III) in presence of other seventeen metal ions with magnificent luminescence enhancement. The observed limit of detection is as low as 17.5&#8197;ppb, which is the lowest among the MOF-based sensors achieved so far. To make this detection approach simple, portable and economic, we demonstrate MOF filter paper test for real time naked eye observation.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Triangular Rhodamine Triads and Their Intrinsic Photophysics Revealed from Gas&#8208;Phase Ion Fluorescence Experiments</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The LUminescence iNstrument in Aarhus (LUNA), which is depicted in the cover image, was used for gas&#8208;phase ion fluorescence experiments on triangular rhodamine triads where each rhodamine dye carries a positive charge. Efficient energy transfer from rhodamine 575 to rhodamine 640 was clearly revealed. More information can be found in the Full Paper by L. Chen, S. Br&#248;ndsted&#8197;Nielsen, et&#8197;al.

         <title>Dihydroazulene&#8208;Azobenzene&#8208;Dihydroazulene Triad Photoswitches</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The importance of connections: The photoactivity of dihydroazulene&#8208;azobenzene&#8208;dihydroazulene (DHA&#8208;AZB&#8208;DHA) triad photoswitches depends strongly on the para/meta connectivity at the central azobenzene unit. The synthesis and switching properties of two triad systems are presented here. The meta connectivity allowed reversible photo&#8208;/thermoswitching between DHA&#8208;trans&#8208;AZB&#8208;DHA and VHF&#8208;cis&#8208;AZB&#8208;VHF where VHF is the vinylheptafulvene photoisomer of DHA. Ultrafast spectroscopy revealed the DHA&#8208;to&#8208;VHF photoisomerization to be faster than the trans&#8208;to&#8208;cis AZB photoisomerization.







Abstract
Photoswitch triads comprising two dihydroazulene (DHA) units in conjugation with a central trans&#8208;azobenzene (AZB) unit were prepared in stepwise protocols starting from meta&#8208; and para&#8208;disubstituted azobenzenes. The para&#8208;connected triad had significantly altered optical properties and lacked the photoactivity of the separate photochromes. In contrast, for the meta&#8208;connected triad, all three photochromes could be photoisomerized to generate an isomer with two vinylheptafulvene (VHF) units and a cis&#8208;azobenzene unit. Ultrafast spectroscopy of the photoisomerizations revealed a fast DHA&#8208;to&#8208;VHF photoisomerization and a slower trans&#8208;to&#8208;cis AZB photoisomerization. This meta triad underwent thermal VHF&#8208;to&#8208;DHA back&#8208;conversion with a similar rate of all VHFs, independent of the identity of the neighboring units, and in parallel thermal cis&#8208;to&#8208;trans AZB conversion. The experimental observations were supported by computation (excitation spectra and orbital analysis of the transitions).

         <title>Structure Elucidation and Spectroscopic Analysis of Chromophores Produced by Oxidative Psilocin Dimerization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;made color frenzy: Psilocin oxidation causes the iconic blueing of Psilocybe &#8220;magic&#8221; mushrooms. To prevent oligomerization, but allow for dimerization, 5&#8208; and 7&#8208;methylated psilocin monomers were synthesized. Chemical oxidation enabled spectroscopic chromophore investigation of the dimeric gateway compounds and comparison to computationally derived absorption spectra. The 7,7&#8217;&#8208;coupled quinoid psilocyl dimer was identified as major initial blue product, while the 5,5&#8217;&#8208;coupled dimer contributes a greenish tint.







Abstract
Psilocin (1) is the dephosphorylated and psychotropic metabolite of the mushroom natural product psilocybin. Oxidation of the phenolic hydroxy group at the C&#8208;4 position of 1 results in formation of oligomeric indoloquinoid chromophores responsible for the iconic blueing of bruised psilocybin&#8208;producing mushrooms. Based on previous NMR experiments, the hypothesis included that the 5,5&#8217;&#8208;coupled quinone dimer of 1 was the primary product responsible for the blue color. To test this hypothesis, ring&#8208;methylated 1 derivatives were synthesized to provide stable analogs of 1 dimers that could be completely characterized. The chemically oxidized derivatives were spectroscopically analyzed and compared to computationally derived absorbance spectra. Experimental evidence did not support the original hypothesis. Rather, the blue color was shown to stem from the quinoid 7,7&#8217;&#8208;coupled dimer of 1.

The tris(pentafluoroethyl)silanol, Si(C2F5)3OH, flashes out of the shadows of silanol derivatives in the cover image, paving the way to its disiloxane and disilanolate. Oxidation of tris(pentafluoroethyl)silane, Si(C2F5)3H, with NO2 provides Si(C2F5)3OH, which readily condenses to disiloxane (C2F5)3SiOSi(C2F5)3. Deprotonation of in situ generated Si(C2F5)3OH yields disilanolate [{Si(C2F5)3O}2]2&#8722; underlining the formally Lewis amphoteric character of the monomeric tris(pentafluoroethyl)silanolate, [Si(C2F5)3O]&#8722;.

         <title>Quadruple Role of Pd Catalyst in Domino Reaction Involving Aryl to Alkyl 1,5&#8208;Pd Migration to Access 1,9&#8208;Bridged Triptycenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Pd&#8208;catalyzed domino reaction of 1,8,13&#8208;tribromo&#8208;9&#8208;methoxytriptycenes is reported. Under conventional Suzuki coupling conditions, the triptycenes underwent multiple transformations to give 1,9&#8208;bridged triptycenes.

Abstract
A Pd&#8208;catalyzed domino reaction of 1,8,13&#8208;tribromo&#8208;9&#8208;methoxytriptycenes is reported. Under conventional Suzuki coupling conditions, the triptycenes underwent multiple transformations to give 1,9&#8208;bridged triptycenes. Based on mechanistic investigations, a single Pd catalyst functions as Pd0, PdII and PdIV species to catalyze four distinct processes: (1) aryl to alkyl 1,5&#8208;Pd migration, (2) intramolecular arylation, (3) homocoupling of phenylboronic acid and (4) Suzuki coupling. DFT calculations revealed that 1,5&#8208;Pd migration likely proceeds via both concerted PdII and stepwise PdIV routes. Asymmetric synthesis of the chiral triptycenes, as well as optical resolution, and further transformation are also reported.

         <title>Conductive Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks: Electronic Structure and Electrochemical Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ever increasing energy demand warrant smarter and minimized electronic devices which insist advanced materials. This review is to delineate the journey of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) from their dawn to commercialization for smarter world, blended with structure&#8208;property relationships and theoretical investigation.







Abstract
Smarter and minimization of devices are consistently substantial to shape the energy landscape. Significant amounts of endeavours have come forward as promising steps to surmount this formidable challenge. It is undeniable that material scientists were contemplating smarter material beyond purely inorganic or organic materials. To our delight, metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), an inorganic&#8208;organic hybrid scaffold with unprecedented tunability and smart functionalities, have recently started their journey as an alternative. In this review, we focus on such propitious potential of MOFs that was untapped over a long time. We cover the synthetic strategies and (or) post&#8208;synthetic modifications towards the formation of conductive MOFs and their underlying concepts of charge transfer with structural aspects. We addressed theoretical calculations with the experimental outcomes and spectroelectrochemistry, which will trigger vigorous impetus about intrinsic electronic behaviour of the conductive frameworks. Finally, we discussed electrocatalysts and energy storage devices stemming from conductive MOFs to meet energy demand in the near future.

         <title>Controlling Antibacterial Activity Exclusively with Visible Light: Introducing a Tetra&#8208;ortho&#8208;Chloro&#8208;Azobenzene Amino Acid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The introduction of a novel tetra&#8208; ortho &#8208;chloroazobenzene amino acid (CEBA) has enabled photoswitching of the antimicrobial activity of tyrocidine A analogues using exclusively visible light, granting spatiotemporal control under benign conditions. Compounds bearing this photoswitchable amino acid become active upon irradiation with red light, but quickly turn&#8208;off upon exposure to other visible light wavelengths. Critically, sunlight quickly triggers isomerisation of the red light&#8208;activated compounds into their original trans form, offering an ideal platform for self&#8208;deactivation upon release into the environment. Linear analogues of tyrocidine A were found to provide the best photocontrol of their antimicrobial activity, leading to compounds active against Acinetobacter baumannii upon isomerisation. Exploration of their N &#8208; and C &#8208;termini has provided insights into key elements of their structure and has allowed obtaining new antimicrobials displaying excellent strain selectivity and photocontrol.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Phase&#8208;pure spinel&#8208;type magnetic nickel ferrite (NiFe  2  O  4  ) nanocrystals in the size range of 4 to 11 nm were successfully synthesized by a fast and energy saving microwave&#8208;assisted approach. Size and accessible surface areas can be tuned precisely by the reaction parameters. Our results highlight the correlation between size, inversion degree, and magnetic characteristics of NiFe  2  O  4  nanoparticles, which enables fine&#8208;tuning of these parameters for a particular application without changing the elemental composition. Moreover, the application potential of the synthesized powders for the electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction in alkaline media was demonstrated, showing that a low degree of inversion is beneficial for the overall performance.

         <title>Switching from Metal&#8208; to Ligand&#8208;Based Oxidation in Cobalt Complexes with Redox&#8208;Active Bisguanidine Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The substitution of the methyl groups of acetylacetonato (acac) co&#8208;ligands in a cobalt(II) complex with a redox&#8208;active bisguanidine ligand by trifluoromethyl groups (hfacac co&#8208;ligands) changes the redox properties. One&#8208;electron oxidation of the complexes with acac co&#8208;ligands is metal centered (Co(II)&#8594;Co(III)). By contrast, a radical monocationic bisguanidine ligand is formed upon one&#8208;electron oxidation of the complexes with hfacac co&#8208;ligands. The changes are accompanied by distinct changes in the magnetic and optical properties.







Abstract
The control of the redox reactivity, magnetic and optical properties of the different redox states of complexes with redox&#8208;active ligands permits their rational use in catalysis and materials science. The redox&#8208;chemistry of octahedrally coordinated high&#8208;spin CoII complexes (three unpaired electrons) with one redox&#8208;active bisguanidine ligand and two acetylacetonato (acac) co&#8208;ligands is completely changed by replacing the acac by hexafluoro&#8208;acetylacetonato (hfacac) co&#8208;ligands. The first one&#8208;electron oxidation is metal&#8208;centered in the case of the complexes with acac co&#8208;ligands, giving diamagnetic CoIII complexes. By contrast, in the case of the less Lewis&#8208;basic hfacac co&#8208;ligands, the first one&#8208;electron oxidation becomes ligand&#8208;centered, leading to high&#8208;spin CoII complexes with a radical monocationic guanidine ligand unit (four unpaired electrons). Ferromagnetic coupling between the spins on the metal and the organic radical in solution is evidenced by temperature&#8208;dependent paramagnetic NMR studies, allowing to estimate the isotropic exchange coupling constant in solution. Second one&#8208;electron oxidation leads to high&#8208;spin CoII complexes with dicationic guanidine ligand units (three unpaired electrons) in the presence of hfacac co&#8208;ligands, but to low&#8208;spin CoIII complexes with radical monocationic, peralkylated guanidine ligand (one unpaired electron) in the presence of acac co&#8208;ligands. The analysis of the electronic structures is complemented by quantum&#8208;chemical calculations on the spin density distributions and relative energies of the possible redox isomers.

By contrast, in the case of the less Lewis-basic hfacac co-ligands, the first one-electron oxidation becomes ligand-centered, leading to high-spin Co&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; complexes with a radical monocationic guanidine ligand unit (four unpaired electrons). Ferromagnetic coupling between the spins on the metal and the organic radical in solution is evidenced by temperature-dependent paramagnetic NMR studies, allowing to estimate the isotropic exchange coupling constant in solution. Second one-electron oxidation leads to high-spin Co&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; complexes with dicationic guanidine ligand units (three unpaired electrons) in the presence of hfacac co-ligands, but to low-spin Co&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; complexes with radical monocationic, peralkylated guanidine ligand (one unpaired electron) in the presence of acac co-ligands. The analysis of the electronic structures is complemented by quantum-chemical calculations on the spin density distributions and relative energies of the possible redox isomers.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>A Novel Reactivity of Phosphanylalumane (&gt;P&#8722;Al&lt;): Reversible Addition of a Saturated Interelement Bond to Olefins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Keen on alkenes: Phosphanylalumane (P&#8722;Al single&#8208;bond compound) was treated with relatively small terminal olefins (ethylene, propylene, and hex&#8208;1&#8208;ene) at room temperature. Heating of propylene&#8208; and hex&#8208;1&#8208;ene adducts regenerated the P&#8722;Al bond with liberation of the corresponding olefins. An unprecedented reactivity of the ethylene adduct with the release of ethylene was demonstrated, in sharp contrast to the conventional P/B system.







Abstract
The reversible addition of olefins to a phosphanylalumane, P&#8722;Al single&#8208;bond species, was investigated. The P&#8722;Al bond added to ethylene and relatively small terminal alkenes (propylene and hex&#8208;1&#8208;ene) at room temperature to give the corresponding alkene adducts. Heating the terminal alkene adducts released the corresponding alkenes and regenerated the P&#8722;Al bond, but no release of ethylene was observed even under vacuum conditions. The reactivity of ethylene adduct as a new saturated C2 vicinal P/Al&#8208;based FLP was also investigated. The ethylene adduct was found to undergo complexation with nitriles to give the corresponding nitrile adducts to the Al center, which retained the ethylene tether as in the case of the corresponding P/B&#8208;based FLP. However, the reactivity of ethylene toward CO2 and benzaldehyde differed from that of the P/B system giving the corresponding adducts.

Fluorine effect in olefin polymerization: Fluorine substituents at various positions (ortho&#8208;, meta&#8208;, and para&#8208;) and with different numbers (n=0, 1, 2, 3, and 5) have been systematically studied for the first time in the nickel &#945;&#8208;diimine promoted ethylene polymerization and copolymerization with polar monomer, which show great influence on catalytic activity, polymer molecular weight, branching density, and incorporation of polar monomer.







Abstract
Fluorine substituents in transition metal catalysts are of great importance in olefin polymerization catalysis; however, the comprehensive effect of fluorine substituents is elusive in seminal late transition metal &#945;&#8208;diimine catalytic system. In this contribution, fluorine substituents at various positions (ortho&#8208;, meta&#8208;, and para&#8208;F) and with different numbers (Fn; n=0, 1, 2, 3, 5) were installed into the well&#8208;defined N&#8208;terphenyl amine and thus were studied for the first time in the nickel &#945;&#8208;diimine promoted ethylene polymerization and copolymerization with polar monomers. The position of the fluorine substituent was particularly crucial in these polymerization reactions in terms of catalytic activity, polymer molecular weight, branching density, and incorporation of polar monomer, and thus a picture on the fluorine effect was given. As a notable result, the ortho&#8208;F substituted &#945;&#8208;diimine nickel catalyst produced highly linear polyethylenes with an extremely high molecular weight (Mw=8703&#8197;kDa) and a significantly low degree of branching of 1.4/1000&#8197;C; however, the meta&#8208;F and/or para&#8208;F substituted &#945;&#8208;diimine nickel catalysts generated highly branched (up to 80.2/1000&#8197;C) polyethylenes with significantly low molecular weights (Mw=20&#8208;50&#8197;kDa).

         <title>RNA Ligation for Mono and Dually Labeled RNAs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Labeling of long RNAs, protein&#8208;coding RNAs in particular, still poses a challenge. We developed new adenosine 3&#8217;,5&#8217;&#8208;bisphophate analogues as reagents for RNA 3&#8217;&#8208;end labeling by T4 RNA ligase. The compounds were efficient T4 substrates yielding 3&#8217;&#8208;mono&#8208;labeled RNAs with various 5&#8217;&#8208;ends (triphosphate, NAD). Combination of 3&#8217;&#8208; and 5&#8217;&#8208;end labeling yielded dually labeled m7G&#8208;capped RNAs that enabled quantitative analysis of decapping and were translationally active. The proposed method enables the creation of versatile probes for investigation of RNA function and localization.







Abstract
Labeled RNAs are invaluable probes for investigation of RNA function and localization. However, mRNA labeling remains challenging. Here, we developed an improved method for 3&#8242;&#8208;end labeling of in&#8197;vitro transcribed RNAs. We synthesized novel adenosine 3&#8242;,5&#8242;&#8208;bisphosphate analogues modified at the N6 or C2 position of adenosine with an azide&#8208;containing linker, fluorescent label, or biotin and assessed these constructs as substrates for RNA labeling directly by T4 ligase or via postenzymatic strain&#8208;promoted alkyne&#8208;azide cycloaddition (SPAAC). All analogues were substrates for T4 RNA ligase. Analogues containing bulky fluorescent labels or biotin showed better overall labeling yields than postenzymatic SPAAC. We successfully labeled uncapped RNAs, NAD&#8208;capped RNAs, and 5&#8242;&#8208;fluorescently labeled m7Gp3Am&#8208;capped mRNAs. The obtained highly homogenous dually labeled mRNA was translationally active and enabled fluorescence&#8208;based monitoring of decapping. This method will facilitate the use of various functionalized mRNA&#8208;based probes.

         <title>Competitive Coordination of Chloride and Fluoride Anions Towards Trivalent Lanthanide Cations (La3+ and Nd3+) in Molten Salts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chemical speciation of trivalent lanthanide Ln(III) in different molten salts is studied in this work. In molten LiCl&#8208;KCl&#8208;LnCl3, six chloride anions (Cl&#8722;, green ball) are coordinated with the trivalent lanthanide cation (Ln3+, orange ball) and form the [LnCl6]3&#8722; species (left). After the addition of LiF, the maximum number of fluoride anion (F&#8722;, purple ball) involved in the first coordination shell of Ln(III) is three, and the possible complexes are [LnCl5F]3&#8722;, [LnCl4F2]3&#8722;, and [LnCl4F3]4&#8722; (right).







Abstract
Molten salt electrolysis is a vital technique to produce high&#8208;purity lanthanide metals and alloys. However, the coordination environments of lanthanides in molten salts, which heavily affect the related redox potential and electrochemical properties, have not been well elucidated. Here, the competitive coordination of chloride and fluoride anions towards lanthanide cations (La3+ and Nd3+) is explored in molten LiCl&#8208;KCl&#8208;LiF&#8208;LnCl3 salts using electrochemical, spectroscopic, and computational approaches. Electrochemical analyses show that significant negative shifts in the reduction potential of Ln3+ occur when F&#8722; concentration increases, indicating that the F&#8722; anions interact with Ln3+ via substituting the coordinated Cl&#8722; anions, and confirm [LnClxFy]3&#8722;x&#8722;y (ymax=3) complexes are prevailing in molten salts. Spectroscopic and computational results on solution structures further reveal the competition between Cl&#8722; and F&#8722; anions, which leads to the formation of four distinct Ln(III) species: [LnCl6]3&#8722;, [LnCl5F]3&#8722;, [LnCl4F2]3&#8722; and [LnCl4F3]4&#8722;. Among them, the seven&#8208;coordinated [LnCl4F3]4&#8722; complex possesses a low&#8208;symmetry structure evidenced by the pattern change of Raman spectra. After comparing the polarizing power (Z/r) among different metal cations, it was concluded that Ln&#8722;F interaction is weaker than that between transition metal and F&#8722; ions.

         <title>Pathways of the Extremely Reactive Iron(IV)&#8208;oxido complexes with Tetradentate Bispidine Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The nonheme iron(IV)&#8208;oxido complex trans&#8208;N3&#8208;[(L1)FeIV=O(Cl)]+ is an extremely reactive oxidant for OAT and HAA processes and is the most reactive nonheme iron model system known so far and of similar reactivity as nonheme iron enzymes. Discussed are spectroscopic and kinetic data, supported by a DFT&#8208;based theoretical analysis. In bulk reactions cyclohexane is selectively oxidized to chlorocyclohexane.







Abstract
The nonheme iron(IV)&#8208;oxido complex trans&#8208;N3&#8208;[(L1)FeIV=O(Cl)]+, where L1 is a derivative of the tetradentate bispidine 2,4&#8208;di(pyridine&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;3,7&#8208;diazabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane&#8208;1&#8208;one, is known to have an S=1 electronic ground state and to be an extremely reactive oxidant for oxygen atom transfer (OAT) and hydrogen atom abstraction (HAA) processes. Here we show that, in spite of this ferryl oxidant having the &#8220;wrong&#8221; spin ground state, it is the most reactive nonheme iron model system known so far and of a similar order of reactivity as nonheme iron enzymes (C&#8722;H abstraction of cyclohexane, &#8722;90&#8201;&#176;C (propionitrile), t1/2=3.5&#8197;sec). Discussed are spectroscopic and kinetic data, supported by a DFT&#8208;based theoretical analysis, which indicate that substrate oxidation is significantly faster than self&#8208;decay processes due to an intramolecular demethylation pathway and formation of an oxido&#8208;bridged diiron(III) intermediate. It is also shown that the iron(III)&#8208;chlorido&#8208;hydroxido/cyclohexyl radical intermediate, resulting from C&#8722;H abstraction, selectively produces chlorocyclohexane in a rebound process. However, the life&#8208;time of the intermediate is so long that other reaction channels (known as cage escape) become important, and much of the C&#8722;H abstraction therefore is unproductive. In bulk reactions at ambient temperature and at longer time scales, there is formation of significant amounts of oxidation product &#8211; selectively of chlorocyclohexane &#8211; and it is shown that this originates from oxidation of the oxido&#8208;bridged diiron(III) resting state.

         <title>Practical Enzymatic Production of Carbocycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent years have witnessed a rapid growth of biocatalytic methods in organic synthesis. This Minireview summarizes the developments in the current state of the art for practical enzyme&#8208;mediated assembly of carbocycles, drawing special attention to case studies that have been performed on preparative scale.







Abstract
The Pd&#8208;catalyzed carbon&#8208;carbon bond formation pioneered by Heck in 1969 has dominated medicinal chemistry development for the ensuing fifty years. As the demand for more complex three&#8208;dimensional active pharmaceuticals continues to increase, preparative enzyme&#8208;mediated assembly, by virtue of its exquisite selectivity and sustainable nature, is poised to provide a practical and affordable alternative for accessing such compounds. In this minireview, we summarize recent state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art developments in practical enzyme&#8208;mediated assembly of carbocycles. When appropriate, background information on the enzymatic transformation is provided and challenges and/or limitations are also highlighted.

         <title>Electrochemical Evaluation of Diketopyrrolopyrrole Derivatives for Nonaqueous Redox Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Blown out of the water: TDPP&#8208;Hex&#8208;CN4, a diketopyrrolopyrrole derivative, was used as anolyte in an all&#8208;organic nonaqueous redox flow battery. Flow cells were assembled with unisol blue and DBBB as catholytes. Both were stable for up to 100 cycles, retaining above &#8764;70&#8201;% capacity. Symmetric flow&#8208;cell and UV&#8208;visible spectroscopy studies of anolyte and both catholytes suggest that TDPP&#8208;Hex&#8208;CN4 is a stable anolyte, and the observed loss in capacity can be attributed to the unstable nature the of catholytes.







Abstract
Redox flow batteries (RFBs) employing nonaqueous electrolytes could potentially operate at much higher cell voltages, and therefore afford higher energy and power densities, than RFBs employing aqueous electrolytes. The development of such high&#8208;voltage nonaqueous RFBs requires anolytes that are electrochemically stable, especially in the presence of traces of oxygen and/or moisture. The inherent atmospheric reactivity of anolytes mandates judicious molecular design with high electron affinity and electrochemical stability. In this study, diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP)&#8208;based TDPP&#8208;Hex&#8208;CN4 is proposed as a stable redox&#8208;active molecule for anolytes in nonaqueous organic RFBs. We demonstrate organic RFBs using TDPP&#8208;Hex&#8208;CN4 as anolyte with unisol blue (UB) 1,4&#8208;bis(isopropylamino)anthraquinone and 1,4&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;2,5&#8208;bis(2&#8208;methoxyethoxy)benzene (DBBB) as catholytes. Cyclic voltammetry measurements with scans repeated over 200 cycles were performed to establish the electrochemical stability of the redox pairs. Symmetric flow&#8208;cell studies show that TDPP&#8208;Hex&#8208;CN4 exhibits stable capacity up to 700 cycles. Redox flow cells employing TDPP&#8208;Hex&#8208;CN4 /UB and TDPP&#8208;Hex&#8208;CN4/DBBB as redox pairs demonstrate that DPP derivatives are propitious materials for anolytes in all organic nonaqueous RFBs.

         <title>Molten&#8208;Salt&#8208;Assisted Annealing for Making Colloidal ZnGa2O4:Cr Nanocrystals with High Persistent Luminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new concept in molten salt confinement to thermally anneal as&#8208;synthesized sub&#8208;10&#8197;nm ZnGa2O4:Cr3+ colloidal nanocrystals in a molten salt medium at 650&#8201;&#176;C is presented. This improves their persistent luminescence intensity and lifetime without any loss of their nanostructural characteristics, water dispersibility or biocompatibility.







Abstract
Persistent luminescent nanocrystals (PLNCs) in the sub&#8208;10&#8197;nm domain are considered to be the most fascinating inventions in lighting technology owing to their excellent performance in anti&#8208;counterfeiting, luminous paints, bioimaging, security applications, etc. Further improvement of persistent luminescence (PersL) intensity and lifetime is needed to achieve the desired success of PLNCs while keeping the uniform sub&#8208;10&#8197;nm size. In this work, the concept of molten salt confinement to thermally anneal as&#8208;synthesized ZnGa2O4:Cr3+ (ZGOC) colloidal NCs (CNCs) in a molten salt medium at 650&#8201;&#176;C is introduced. This method led to significantly monodispersed and few agglomerated NCs with a much improved photoluminescence (PL) and PersL intensity without much growth in the size of the pristine CNCs. Other strategies such as i) thermal annealing, ii) overcoating, and iii) the core&#8211;shell strategy have also been tried to improve PL and PersL but did not improve them simultaneously. Moreover, directly annealing the CNCs in air without the assistance of molten salt could significantly improve both PL and PersL but led to particle heterogeneity and aggregation, which are highly unsuitable for in&#8197;vivo imaging. We believe this work provides a novel strategy to design PLNCs with high PL intensity and long PersL duration without losing their nanostructural characteristics, water dispersibility and biocompatibility.

         <title>Promoted NIR&#8208;II Fluorescent Brightness&#8220;Ring&#8208;fusion&#8221; for Detection of Intestinal Inflammation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorophores with emission in the second near&#8208;infrared window (NIR&#8208;II) have displayed salient advantages for biomedical applications. However, to achieve red&#8208;shifted wavelengths, the common strategy by reducing the energy bandgap of fluorophores always leads to compromised fluorescent brightness. Herein, we propose a molecular design concept by &#8220;ring&#8208;fusion&#8221; to modify the acceptor of AIEgen, which can extend the luminous wavelength from NIR&#8208;I to NIR&#8208;II. The yielded fluorophore (TTQP) with fused acceptor has shown enhanced absorption coefficient with a higher brightness in the nanoparticle formation, as compared to its NIR&#8208;I emissive counterpart (TTQ&#8208;DP) with the non&#8208;fused acceptor. Theoretical calculation further confirms that the ring&#8208;fusion action can efficiently promote the rigidity and planarity of the electron&#8208;deficient core, leading to a lower reorganization energy and nonradiative decay. The yielded TTQP NPs thus allow sensitive NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging of vasculature and intestinal inflammation in mice models. Therefore, we anticipate that our work will provide a promising molecular engineering strategy to enrich the library and broaden the application scope of NIR&#8208;II fluorophores.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Vitamin D receptor ligands have potential for the treatment of hyperproliferative diseases and disorders related to the immune system. However hypercalcemic effects limit their therapeutical uses and call for the development of tissue&#8208;selective new analogs. We have designed and synthesized the first examples of 1&#945;,25&#8208; dihydroxyvitamin D 3&#160; analogs bearing an allenic unit attached to the D ring to restrict the side&#8208;chain conformational mobility. The triene system was constructed by a Pd 0 &#8208;mediated cyclization/Suzuki&#8208; Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling process in the presence of an allenic side chain. The allenic moiety was built through an orthoester&#8208;Claisen rearrangement of a propargylic alcohol. The biological activity and structure of (22 S )&#8208;1 a ,25&#8208;dihydroxy&#8208;17,20&#8208;dien&#8208;24&#8208;homo&#8208;21&#8208;nor&#8208; vitamin D 3&#160; bound to binding domain of the vitamin D receptor, provide information concerning side&#8208;chain conformational requirements for biological activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Cationic Polypeptide Supramolecular Nanogels for Intracellular DNA Delivery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Wrapped in a peptide box: Supramolecular nanogels self&#8208;assembled from poly&#8208;L&#8208;lysine (PLL) modified with host and guest units can entrap molecular cargo such as DNA and deliver it into cells for transfection. The PLL is made by N&#8208;carboxyanhydride polymerization and equipped with cyclodextrin and adamantane groups. The size of the nanogel can be tuned by the length of the PLL and smaller nanogels are better transfection agents.







Abstract
Supramolecular nanogels are an emerging class of polymer nanocarriers for intracellular delivery, due to their straightforward preparation, biocompatibility, and capability to spontaneously encapsulate biologically active components such as DNA. A completely biodegradable three&#8208;component cationic supramolecular nanogel was designed exploiting the multivalent host&#8208;guest interaction of cyclodextrin and adamantane attached to a polypeptide backbone. While cyclodextrin was conjugated to linear poly&#8208;L&#8208;lysine, adamantane was grafted to linear as well as star shaped poly&#8208;L&#8208;lysine. Size control of nanogels was obtained with the increase in the length of the host and guest polymer. Moreover, smaller nanogels were obtained using the star shaped polymers because of the compact nature of star polymers compared to linear polymers. Nanogels were loaded with anionic model cargoes, pyranine and carboxyfluorescein, and their enzyme responsive release was studied using protease trypsin. Confocal microscopy revealed successful transfection of mammalian HeLa cells and intracellular release of pyranine and plasmid DNA, as quantified using a luciferase assay, showing that supramolecular polypeptide nanogels have significant potential in gene therapy applications.

         <title>Tracking the Electrocatalytic Activity of a Single Palladium Nanoparticle for the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stochastic collision model: A carbon ultramicroelectrode (C&#8208;UME) is used to obtain a 2&#8211;5 orders magnitude enhancement of maximum turnover frequency (kcat) by stochastic collision electrochemistry compared with the ensemble electrochemistry. The electrocatalytic activity of nanoparticle&#8208;based electrocatalysts is directly related to their working conditions, and the electrocatalytic heterogeneity among palladium nanoparticles (Pd NPs) could be displayed by stochastic collision electrochemistry.







Abstract
The nanoparticle&#8208;based electrocatalysts&#8217; performance is directly related to their working conditions. In general, a number of nanoparticles are uncontrollably fixed on a millimetre&#8208;sized electrode for electrochemical measurements. However, it is hard to reveal the maximum electrocatalytic activity owing to the aggregation and detachment of nanoparticles on the electrode surface. To solve this problem, here, we take the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalyzed by palladium nanoparticles (Pd NPs) as a model system to track the electrocatalytic activity of single Pd NPs by stochastic collision electrochemistry and ensemble electrochemistry, respectively. Compared with the nanoparticle fixed working condition, Pd NPs in the nanoparticle diffused working condition results in a 2&#8211;5 orders magnitude enhancement of electrocatalytic activity for HER at various bias potential. Stochastic collision electrochemistry with high temporal resolution gives further insights into the accurate study of NPs&#8217; electrocatalytic performance, enabling to dramatically enhance electrocatalytic efficiency.

         <title>Selectively Deoxyfluorinated N&#8208;Acetyllactosamine Analogues as 19F NMR Probes to Study Carbohydrate&#8208;Galectin Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Galectins are widely expressed galactose&#8208;binding lectins implied, for example, in immune regulation, metastatic spreading, and pathogen recognition.  N&#8208;Acetyllactosamine (Gal&#946;1&#8208;4GlcNAc, LacNAc) and its oligomeric or glycosylated forms are natural ligands of galectins. To probe substrate specificity and binding mode of galectins, we synthesized a complete series of six mono&#8208;deoxyfluorinated analogues of LacNAc, in which each hydroxyl has been selectively replaced by fluorine while the anomeric position has been protected as methyl &#946;&#8208;glycoside. Initial evaluation of their binding to human galectin&#8208;1 and &#8208;3 by ELISA and  19F NMR  T2  &#8208;filter revealed that deoxyfluorination at C3, C4&#8242; and C6&#8242; completely abolished binding to galectin&#8208;1 but very weak binding to galectin&#8208;3 was still detectable. Moreover, deoxyfluorination of C2&#8242; caused an approximately 8&#8208;fold increase in the&#160;binding affinity towards galectin&#8208;1, whereas binding to galectin&#8208;3 was essentially not affected. Lipophilicity measurement revealed that deoxyfluorination at the Gal moiety affects log  P  very differently compared to deoxyfluorination at the GlcNAc moiety.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Zeolitic vanadotungstates with tunable microporosity have potential interests in gas separation. The pore openings of the materials are in between the diameters of normal butane and isobutane, which causes the materials only adsorb normal butane. The breakthrough experiments show that the materials effectively separate normal butane from the normal butane and isobutane mixture even at high temperatures. The robust materials can be reused without loss of the separation performance.</dc:description>

         <title>NHC Effects on Reduction Dynamics in Iron&#8208;catalyzed Organic Transformations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The high abundance, low toxicity and rich redox chemistry of iron has resulted in a surge of iron catalyzed organic transformations over the last two decades. Within this area, N &#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands have been widely utilized to achieve high yields across reactions including cross&#8208;coupling and C&#8208;H alkylation, amongst others. Central to the development of iron&#8208;NHC catalytic methods is the understanding of iron speciation and the propensity of these species to undergo reduction events, as low&#8208;valent iron species can be advantageous or undesirable from one system to the next. This study highlights the importance of the identity of the NHC on iron speciation upon reaction with EtMgBr, where reactions with SIMes and IMes NHCs were shown to undergo &#946; &#8208;hydride elimination more readily than those with SIPr and IPr NHCs. This insight is vital to developing new iron&#8208;NHC catalyzed transformations as understanding how to control this reduction by simply changing the NHC is central to improving the reactivity in iron&#8208;NHC catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>A photo&#8208; and redox&#8208;driven two&#8208;directional terthiazole&#8208;based switch: a combined experimental and computational investigation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Terthiazoles with redox&#8208;active substituents like N&#8208;methyl pyridinium group and ferrocene have been synthesized and their photo&#8208; and electro&#8208;chromic behaviors investigated. The presence of two lateral N&#8208;methyl pyridinium substituents in the structure of terthiazole proved to be effective in inducing not only the reductive ring&#8208;closure of the terthiazole core but also its oxidative ring&#8208;opening reaction, leading to the first terarylene&#8208;based switch able to fully operate both photochemically and electrochemically. Moreover, the large increase in the redox potential between its open and closed form (700 mV) means that a part of the photon energy necessary to trigger the cyclization is stored in the form of chemical potential available for other works. Introduction of a second redox&#8208;active unit such as ferrocene onto the central thiazolyl moiety is found to inhibit the photochromism of the switch but not its redox switchability which, instead, got improved for the ring&#8208;opening reaction via the redox properties of the ferrocenyl unit. The optical and redox properties of the switch in its different oxidation states are analyzed with the aid of DFT calculations in order to rationalize different switching processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Iminosugar C&#8208;Glycosides Work as Pharmacological Chaperones of NAGLU, a Glycosidase Involved in MPS IIIB Rare Disease**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Capitalizing on the X&#8208;ray structure of two NAGLU&#8208;homoiminosugar complexes, the synthesis and evaluation as glycosidase inhibitors of a library of rationally designed iminosugar C&#8208;glycosides led to the discovery of several selective NAGLU inhibitors and allowed the identification of a pharmacological chaperone candidate to treat mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIB, a rare and devastating disease.







Abstract
Mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIB is a devastating neurological disease caused by a lack of the lysosomal enzyme, &#945;&#8208;N&#8208;acetylglucosaminidase (NAGLU), leading to a toxic accumulation of heparan sulfate. Herein we explored a pharmacological chaperone approach to enhance the residual activity of NAGLU in patient fibroblasts. Capitalizing on the three&#8208;dimensional structures of two modest homoiminosugar&#8208;based NAGLU inhibitors in complex with bacterial homolog of NAGLU, CpGH89, we have synthesized a library of 17 iminosugar C&#8208;glycosides mimicking N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;D&#8208;glucosamine and bearing various pseudo&#8208;anomeric substituents of both &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;configuration. Elaboration of the aglycon moiety results in low micromolar selective inhibitors of human recombinant NAGLU, but surprisingly it is the non&#8208;functionalized and wrongly configured &#946;&#8208;homoiminosugar that was proved to act as the most promising pharmacological chaperone, promoting a 2.4 fold activity enhancement of mutant NAGLU at its optimal concentration.

         <title>Rb[Li5Si2O7] &#8211; A Latecomer in the Family of Alkali Lithosilicates Hiding a Green&#8208;Emitting Lithosilicate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
After the rediscovery of alkali lithosilicates as phosphor materials, a new representative has been found. The novel compound with the sum formula Rb[Li5Si2O7] crystallizes in the orthorhombic space group Pbcm (no. 57), exhibiting a new structure type. Eu2+&#8208;doped Rb[Li5Si2O7] feigns an intense green luminescence, in reality co&#8208;crystallizing as a matrix around a tiny core of the known narrow&#8208;band green phosphor RbLi[Li3SiO4]2:Eu2+.







Abstract
In order to expand the field of alkali lithosilicates, a new representative of the substance class with a previously unknown structure type was found based on solid&#8208;state synthesis. The novel compound with the sum formula Rb[Li5Si2O7] crystallizes in the orthorhombic space group Pbcm (no. 57) with a=7.6269(3), b=9.5415(4), and c=9.4095(3)&#8197;&#197; by means of single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The structure consists of a highly condensed lithosilicate framework, built up of corner&#8208; and edge&#8208;linked [LiO4]&#8208;tetrahedra and [Si2O7]&#8208;units, and the rubidium ions aligned in channels. Suitable crystals of the material were obtained using sealed tantalum ampoules as reaction tube at a temperature of 750&#8201;&#176;C. The new compound was further characterized via powder diffraction, Rietveld analysis, and EDX measurements. At first glance, Eu2+&#8208;doped Rb[Li5Si2O7] reveals an intense green luminescence. In&#8208;depth crystal analysis shows that a core&#8208;shell formation is present even for apparently high quality single&#8208;crystals. As a minority phase, the known green phosphor RbLi[Li3SiO4]2:Eu2+ is the origin of the luminescence, representing a tiny core inside of the particles surrounded by a large matrix of transparent Rb[Li5Si2O7] dominating the single&#8208;crystal diffraction pattern.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to expand the field of alkali lithosilicates, a new representative of the substance class with a previously unknown structure type was found based on solid-state synthesis. The novel compound with the sum formula Rb[Li&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;Si&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;] crystallizes in the orthorhombic space group &lt;i&gt;Pbcm&lt;/i&gt; (no. 57) with &lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;=7.6269(3), &lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;=9.5415(4), and &lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;=9.4095(3)&#8197;&#197; by means of single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The structure consists of a highly condensed lithosilicate framework, built up of corner- and edge-linked [LiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]-tetrahedra and [Si&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;]-units, and the rubidium ions aligned in channels. Suitable crystals of the material were obtained using sealed tantalum ampoules as reaction tube at a temperature of 750&#8201;&#176;C. The new compound was further characterized via powder diffraction, Rietveld analysis, and EDX measurements. At first glance, Eu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-doped Rb[Li&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;Si&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;] reveals an intense green luminescence. In-depth crystal analysis shows that a core-shell formation is present even for apparently high quality single-crystals. As a minority phase, the known green phosphor RbLi[Li&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;:Eu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; is the origin of the luminescence, representing a tiny core inside of the particles surrounded by a large matrix of transparent Rb[Li&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;Si&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;] dominating the single-crystal diffraction pattern.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Midkine Interaction with Chondroitin Sulfate&#160;Model Synthetic Tetrasaccharides and Their Mimetics: The Role of Aromatic Interactions.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Midkine (MK) is a neurotrophic factor that participates in the embryonic central nervous system (CNS) development and neural stem cell regulation, interacting with sulphated glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). Chondroitin sulphate (CS) is the natural ligand in the CNS. In this work, we describe the interactions between a library of synthetic models of CS&#8208;types and mimics. We did a structural study of this library by NMR and MD (Molecular Dynamics), concluding that the basic shape is controlled by similar geometry of the glycosidic linkages. Their 3D structures are a helix with four residues per turn, almost linear. We have studied the tetrasaccharide&#8208;midkine complexes by ligand observed NMR techniques and concluded that the shape of the ligands does not change upon binding. The ligand orientation into the complex is very variable. It is placed inside the central cavity of MK formed by the two structured beta&#8208;sheets domains linked by an intrinsically disordered region (IDR). Docking analysis confirmed the participation of aromatics residues from MK completed with electrostatic interactions. Finally, we test the biological activity by increasing the MK expression using CS tetrasaccharides and their capacity in enhancing the growth stimulation effect of MK in NIH3T3 cells</dc:description>

         <title>Bifunctional Polyene Cyclizations: Synthetic Studies on Pimarane Natural Products</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polyene cyclizations generate molecular complexity from a linear polyene in a single step. While methods to initiate these cyclizations have been continuously expanded and improved over the years, the majority of polyene substrates are still limited to simple alkyl&#8208;substituted alkenes. In this study, we took advantage of the unique reactivity of higher&#8208;functionalized bifunctional alkenes. The realization of a polyene tetracyclization of a dual nucleophilic aryl enol ether involving a transannular  endo  &#8208;termination step enabled the total synthesis of the tricyclic diterpenoid pimara&#8208;15&#8208;en&#8208;3  &#945;  &#8208;8  &#945;  &#8208;diol. The highly flexible and modular route allowed for the preparation of a diverse library of cyclization precursors specifically designed for the total synthesis of the tetracyclic  nor  &#8208;diterpenoid norflickinflimiod C. The tetracyclization of three diversely substituted allenes enabled access to complex pentacyclic products and provided a detailed insight into the underlying reaction pathways.</dc:description>

         <title>Cation ordering and exsolution in copper&#8208;containing forms of the flexible zeolite Rho (Cu,M&#8208;Rho; M = H, Na) and their consequences for CO2 adsorption</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The flexibility of the zeolite Rho framework offers great potential for tunable molecular sieving. The fully copper&#8208;exchanged form of Rho and mixed Cu,H&#8208; and Cu,Na&#8208;forms have been prepared. EPR spectroscopy reveals Cu  2+  cations are present in the dehydrated forms and Rietveld refinement shows these prefer S6R sites, away from the  d8r  windows that control diffusion. Fully exchanged Cu&#8208;Rho remains in an open form upon dehydration, the  d8r  windows remain nearly circular and the occupancy of window sites is low, so that it adsorbs CO  2  rapidly at room temperature. Breakthrough tests with 10% CO  2  /40% CH  4  mixtures show that Cu  4.9  &#8208;Rho is able to produce pure methane, albeit with a relatively low capacity at this p  CO2  due to the weak interaction of CO  2  with Cu cations. This is in strong contrast with Na&#8208;Rho, where cations in narrow elliptical window sites enable CO  2  to be adsorbed with high selectivity and uptake but too slowly to enable the production of pure methane in similar breakthrough experiments. A series of Cu,Na&#8208;Rho materials was prepared to improve uptake and selectivity compared to Cu&#8208;Rho, and kinetics compared to Na&#8208;Rho. Remarkably, Cu,Na&#8208;Rho with &gt;2 Cu cations per unit cell exhibited exsolution, due to the preference of Na cations for narrow S8R sites in distorted Rho and of Cu cations for S6R sites in the centric, open form of Rho. The exsolved Cu,Na&#8208;Rho showed improved performance in CO  2  /CH  4  breakthrough tests, producing pure CH  4  with improved uptake and CO  2  /CH  4  selectivity compared to that of Cu  4.9  &#8208;Rho.</dc:description>

         <title>Rigid and Compact Binuclear Bis&#8208;hydrated Gd&#8208;complexes as High Relaxivity MRI Agents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two novel binuclear PCTA2 and AAZTA2 ligands were synthesized with a multistep process. Their GdIII&#8208;complexes results in molecular relaxivities at 1.5&#8197;T and 298&#8197;K of ca. 24&#8211;25&#8197;mM&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 thanks to the rigidity and compactness of the ligands. These values are remarkably higher that those found for the corresponding mononuclear complexes.







Abstract
The first binuclear Gd&#8208;complex of the 12&#8208;membered pyridine&#8208;based polyaminocarboxylate macrocyclic ligand PCTA was synthesized by C&#8722;C connection of the pyridine units through two different synthetic procedures. A dimeric AAZTA&#8208;ligand was also synthesized with the aim to compare the relaxometric results or the two ditopic Gd&#8208;complexes. Thus, the 1H relaxometric study on [Gd2PCTA2(H2O)4] and on [Gd2AAZTA2(H2O)4]2&#8722; highlighted the remarkable rigidity and compactness of the two binuclear complexes, which results in molar relaxivities (per Gd), at 1.5&#8197;T and 298&#8197;K of ca. 12&#8211;12.6&#8197;mM&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 with an increase of ca. 80&#8201;% at 1.5&#8197;T and 298&#8197;K (+70&#8201;% at 310&#8197;K) with respect to the corresponding mononuclear complexes.

         <title>A Redox&#8208;Active Tetrazine&#8208;Based Pincer Ligand for the Reduction of N&#8208;Oxyanions Using a Redox&#8208;Inert Metal</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
With or without zinc: A redox&#8208;active ligand is shown to be active towards nitrite reduction to nitric oxide, with and without the presence of a coordinated electrophile, zinc. The pre&#8208;reduced ligand stores four protons and four electrons in two reduced tetrazine arms, all of which are used in reactivity with silver nitrite.







Abstract
The reaction chemistry of the bis&#8208;tetrazinyl pyridine ligand (btzp) towards nitrogen oxyanions coordinated to zinc is studied in order to explore the reduction of the NOx&#8722; substrates with a redox&#8208;active ligand in the absence of redox activity at the metal. Following syntheses and characterization of (btzp)ZnX2 for X=Cl, NO3 and NO2, featuring O&#8722;Zn linkage of both nitrogen oxyanions, it is shown that a silylating agent selectively delivers silyl substituents to tetrazine nitrogens, without reductive deoxygenation of NOx&#8722;1. A new synthesis of the highly hydrogenated H4btzp, containing two dihydrotetrazine reductants is described as is the synthesis and characterization of (H4btzp)ZnX2 for X=Cl and NO3, both of which show considerable hydrogen bonding potential of the dihydrotetrazine ring NH groups. The (H4btzp)ZnCl2 complex does not bind zinc in the pincer pocket, but instead H4btzp becomes a bridge between neighboring atoms through tetrazine nitrogen atoms, forming a polymeric chain. The reaction of AgNO2 with (H4btzp)ZnCl2 is shown to proceed with fast nitrite deoxygenation, yielding water and free NO. Half of the H4btzp reducing equivalents form Ag0 and thus the chloride ligand remains coordinated to the zinc metal center to yield (btzp)ZnCl2. To compare with AgNO2, experiments of (H4btzp)ZnCl2 with NaNO2 result in salt metathesis between chloride and nitrite, highlighting the importance of a redox&#8208;active cation in the reduction of nitrite to NO.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;With or without zinc&lt;/b&gt;: A redox-active ligand is shown to be active towards nitrite reduction to nitric oxide, with and without the presence of a coordinated electrophile, zinc. The pre-reduced ligand stores four protons and four electrons in two reduced tetrazine arms, all of which are used in reactivity with silver nitrite.

&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Tuning the &#960;&#8208;Accepting Properties of Mesoionic Carbenes: A Combined Computational and Experimental Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In silico screening and experimental verification: A mesoionic imidazolylidene ligand with a diphenyltriazinyl substituent in C2 position (Dpt&#8208;MIC) was found to be a better &#960;&#8208;acceptor when compared to the standard N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene IDipp or to a mesoionic carbene with a phenyl group in C2 position (Ph&#8208;MIC). The utility of the new carbene Dpt&#8208;MIC was evidenced by the synthesis of a low&#8208;valent paramagnetic tin compound.







Abstract
Mesoionic imidazolylidenes are recognized as excellent electron&#8208;donating ligands in organometallic and main group chemistry. However, these carbene ligands typically show poor &#960;&#8208;accepting properties. A computational analysis of 71 mesoionic imidazolylidenes that bear different aryl or heteroaryl substituents in C2 position was performed. The study has revealed that a diphenyltriazinyl (Dpt) substituent renders the corresponding carbene particularly &#960;&#8208;acidic. The computational results could be corroborated experimentally. A mesoionic imidazolylidene with a Dpt substituent was found to be a better &#963;&#8208;donor and a better &#960;&#8208;acceptor compared to an Arduengo&#8208;type N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene. To demonstrate the utility of the new carbene, the ligand was used to stabilize a low&#8208;valent paramagnetic tin compound.

         <title>Radical C&#8722;H Trifluoromethoxylation of (Hetero)arenes with Bis(trifluoromethyl)peroxide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bis(trifluoromethyl)peroxide (BTMP) is introduced as a new reagent for the C&#8722;H trifluoromethoxylation of arenes and heteroarenes. Readily accessed from inexpensive bulk chemicals, BTMP serves as a practical source of .OCF3 radicals upon activation through either visible light photoredox or TEMPO catalysis. Both methods deliver valuable fluorine&#8208;containing building blocks in a single step from (hetero)aromatic feedstocks.







Abstract
Trifluoromethoxylated (hetero)arenes are of great interest for several disciplines, especially in agro&#8208; and medicinal chemistry. Radical C&#8722;H trifluoromethoxylation of (hetero)arenes represents an attractive approach to prepare such compounds, but the high cost and low atom economy of existing .OCF3 radical sources make them unsuitable for the large&#8208;scale synthesis of trifluoromethoxylated building blocks. Herein, we introduce bis(trifluoromethyl)peroxide (BTMP, CF3OOCF3) as a practical and efficient trifluoromethoxylating reagent that is easily accessible from inexpensive bulk chemicals. Using either visible light photoredox or TEMPO catalysis, trifluoromethoxylated arenes could be prepared in good yields under mild conditions directly from unactivated aromatics. Moreover, TEMPO catalysis allowed for the one&#8208;step synthesis of valuable pyridine derivatives, which have been previously prepared via multi&#8208;step approaches.

         <title>Supramolecular Regulation of Catalytic Activity for an Amphiphilic Pyrene&#8208;Ruthenium Complex in Water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Off and on again: A supramolecular approach was employed to regulate the catalytic activity of an amphiphilic metal complex pyrene&#8722;ruthenium (Py&#8722;Ru). The self&#8208;assembly of Py&#8722;Ru exhibited an enhanced catalytic efficiency in the transfer hydrogenation of NAD+ to NADH, which could be decreased by forming inclusion complex with cucurbituril. Through competitive replacement with amantadine, the activity of Py&#8722;Ru can be recovered. This supramolecular strategy provides an efficient and flexible method for constructing switchable catalysts.







Abstract
A switchable catalytic system has been designed and constructed with a host&#8722;guest interaction between cucurbituril (CB) and an amphiphilic metal complex pyrene&#8722;ruthenium (Py&#8722;Ru). Py&#8722;Ru can self&#8208;assemble into positively charged nanoparticles in water, and exhibits an enhanced catalytic efficiency in the transfer hydrogenation of NAD+ to NADH. After forming an inclusion complex with CB, Py&#8722;Ru aggregates are broken, leading to a decrease in catalytic efficiency, which can be recovered by competitive replacement with amantadine. This supramolecular strategy provides an efficient and flexible method for constructing reversible catalytic system, which also extends the application scope of the host&#8722;guest interaction.

         <dc:description>
&#8220;The selective trapping of multiple transient azolyllithiums in a &#8216;halogen dance&#8217; was realized in a batch reactor, by choosing an appropriate zinc halide diamine complex as the transmetalating agent. The concept that the selectivity is switched by the diamine ligand is unprecedented, in contrast to flow chemistry which controls the reaction time precisely. The reaction is operationally simple and can be performed at 0&#8197;&#176;C with high reproducibility on a multi&#8208;gram scale.&#8221; Read more about the story behind the cover in the Cover Profile and about the research itself on page&#8197;&#9642;&#9642;&#8197;ff.

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of Multi&#8208;Substituted Tetrahydrofurans via Palladium/Rhodium Synergistic Catalyzed [3+2] Decarboxylative Cycloaddition of Vinylethylene Carbonates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Unlike the comprehensive development of tandem multi&#8208;metallic catalysis, bimetallic synergistic catalysis has been challenging to achieve high stereoselectivity with the generation of multi&#8208;stereogenic centres. Herein, an efficient synergistic catalysis for the diastereo&#8208; and enantio&#8208;selective synthesis of multi&#8208;substituted tetrahydrofuran derivatives has been developed. Under mild reaction conditions, a series of target molecules with three consecutive stereocenters were synthesized by a palladium(0)/rhodium(III) bimetal&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric decarboxylative [3+2]&#8208;cycloaddition of vinylethylene carbonates with &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds. The corresponding adducts were obtained with moderate to high yields (67% ~ 98%) and excellent stereoselectivities (&gt; 20:1 dr, up to 99% ee).</dc:description>

         <title>Size Controlled Hapticity Switching in [Ln(C9H9)(C8H8)] Sandwiches</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sandwich complexes of lanthanide have recently attracted a considerable amount of interest due to their applications as single molecule magnet (SMM). Herein, a comprehensive series of heteroleptic lanthanide sandwich complexes ligated by the cyclononatetraenyl (Cnt) and the cyclooctatetraenyl (Cot) ligand [Ln(Cot)(Cnt)] (Ln = Tb, Dy, Er, Ho, Yb, and Lu) is reported. The coordination behavior of the Cnt ligand has been investigated along the series and shows different coordination patterns in the solid&#8208;state depending on the size of the corresponding lanthanide ion without altering its overall anisotropy. Besides the characterization in the solid state by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and in solution by  1  H NMR, static magnetic studies and ab initio computational studies were performed.</dc:description>

         <title>(NH4)2V7O16 Micro&#8208;bricks as a Novel Anode for Aqueous Lithium&#8208;ion Battery with Good&#160;Cyclability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Searching novel anode materials to address the issues of poor cycle stability in the aqueous lithium&#8208;ion battery system is highly desirable. In this work, ammonium vanadium bronze (NH  4  )  2  V  7  O  16  with brick&#8208;like morphology has been investigated as an anode material for aqueous lithium&#8208;ion batteries and Li  +  /Na  +  hybrid ion batteries. The two novel full cell systems, (NH  4  )  2  V  7  O  16  // Li  2  SO  4  // LiMn  2  O  4  and (NH  4  )  2  V  7  O  16  // Na  2  SO  4  // LiMn  2  O  4  , both demonstrate good rate capability and excellent cycling performance. The capacity retention of 78.61% after 500 cycles at 300 mA g  &#8208;1  has been demonstrated in the (NH  4  )  2  V  7  O  16  // Li  2  SO  4  // LiMn  2  O  4  system while no capacity attenuation is observed in the (NH  4  )  2  V  7  O  16  // Na  2  SO  4  // LiMn  2  O  4  system. The reaction mechanisms of the (NH  4  )  2  V  7  O  16  electrode and impedance variation of the two full cells have also been researched. The excellent cycling stability suggests that the layered (NH  4  )  2  V  7  O  16  can be a promising anode material for aqueous rechargeable lithium&#8208;ion batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemodynamic Therapy Combined with Multifunctional Nanomaterials and Their Applications in Tumor Treatment</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>During the past few decades, radiotherapy and chemotherapy have once been the standard approaches for tumor treatments. However, the potential toxic effect and side effects of both radiotherapy and chemotherapy on the human body still cannot be neglected. Given this, the Fenton reaction has become one of the most effective treatment strategies to combat tumor cells. This review aims to comprehensively and systematically summarize the recent advances in chemodynamic therapy (CDT) via the Fenton reaction. In addition, a host of the advanced nano&#8208;multifunctional materials and engineering bacteria used in the Fenton reaction were also summarized. This paper would be helpful to provide guidance and lay firm foundations for future tumor treatment.</dc:description>

         <title>Ionic Liquids [M3+][A&#8211;]3 with Three&#8208;Valent Cations and Their Possible Use to Easily Separate Rare Earth Metals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We introduce a simple way to liquify rare earth metals (REM) by incorporating the corresponding cations, in particular Eu  3+  , La  3+  , and Y  3+  , into polyvalent Ionic Liquids. In contrast to conventional methods, this is achieved not by transforming them into anionic complexes, but by keeping them as bare cations and combining them with convenient, cheap and commercially available anions (A) in the form [REM  3+  ][A  &#8211;  ]  3  . To do so, we follow the COncept of Melting Point Lowering due to EThoxylation (COMPLET) with alkyl polyethylene oxide carboxylates as anions. We provide basic properties, such as glass transition temperatures, viscosities, electrical conductivities, as well as water&#8208;octanol partition constants  P  and show that these ILs have remarkably different properties, despite the similarity of their cations. In addition, we show that the ionic liquids possess interesting luminescent properties as non&#8208;conventional fluorophores.</dc:description>

         <title>Copper&#8208;Photocatalyzed Hydrosilylation of Alkynes and Alkenes under Continuous Flow</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Go with the flow: The photocatalytic hydrosilylation of alkynes and alkenes under continuous&#8208;flow conditions using the [Cu(dmp)(XantphosTEPD)]PF6 catalyst under blue LEDs irradiation is reported. A large panel of alkenes and alkynes was functionalized in good to excellent yields with a large functional group tolerance.







Abstract
Herein, the photocatalytic hydrosilylation of alkynes and alkenes under continuous flow conditions is described. By using 0.2&#8197;mol&#8201;% of the developed [Cu(dmp)(XantphosTEPD)]PF6 under blue LEDs irradiation, a large panel of alkenes and alkynes was hydrosilylated in good to excellent yields with a large functional group tolerance. The mechanism of the reaction was studied, and a plausible scenario was suggested.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Channel Optical Device for Solar&#8208;Driven Bacterial Inactivation under Real&#8208;Time Temperature Feedback</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solar&#8208;driven photothermal antibacterial device was designed with multilayers based on IrO2 nanoaggregates&#8208;based photothermal and temperature sensor channels. The device can efficiently inactivate bacteria by monitoring the temperature accurately during the photothermal process. This study could provide valuable insight for development of solar&#8208;driven and self&#8208;feedback device for photothermal antibacterial materials.







Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven photothermal antibacterial devices have attracted a lot of interest due to the fact that solar energy is one of the cleanest sources of energy in the world. However, conventional materials have a narrow absorbance band, resulting in deficient solar harvesting. In addition, lack of knowledge on temperature change in these devices during the photothermal process has also led to a waste of energy. Here, we presented an elegant multi&#8208;channel optical device with a multilayer structure to simultaneously address the above&#8208;mentioned issues in solar&#8208;driven antibacterial devices. In the photothermal channel, semiconductor IrO2&#8208;nanoaggregates exhibited higher solar absorbance and photothermal conversion efficiency compared with nanoparticles. In the luminescence channel, thermal&#8208;sensitive Er&#8208;doped upconversion nanoparticles were utilized to reflect the microscale temperature in real&#8208;time. The bacteria were successfully inactivated during the photothermal effect under solar irradiation with temperature monitoring. This study could provide valuable insight for the development of smart photothermal devices for solar&#8208;driven photothermal bacterial inactivation in the future.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Solar-driven photothermal&lt;/b&gt; antibacterial device was designed with multilayers based on IrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanoaggregates-based photothermal and temperature sensor channels.

         <title>Enantioselective Recognition of Racemic Amino Alcohols in Aqueous Solution by Chiral Metal&#8208;Oxide Keplerate {Mo132}&#8208;cluster Capsules</title>

         <dc:description>Determining the relative configuration or enantiomeric excess of a substance may be achieved using NMR spectroscopy by employing chiral shift reagents (CSRs). Such reagents non&#8208;covalently interact with the chiral solute, resulting in each chiral form experiencing different magnetic anisotropy, which is reflected in their NMR spectra. The Keplerate polyoxometalate (POM) is a molybdenum&#8208;based, water&#8208;soluble, discrete inorganic structure with a pore&#8208;accessible inner cavity, decorated by differentiable ligands. Through ligand exchange from the self&#8208;assembled nanostructure we have synthesized a set of chiral Keplerate host molecules. By exploiting interactions of analyte molecules at the surface pores we establish the relative configuration of chiral amino alcohol guests (phenylalaninol and 2&#8208;amino&#8208;1&#8208;phenylethanol) in aqueous solvent and determine their enantiomeric excess by  1  H NMR. The use of POMs as chiral shift reagents represents an application of the class that is yet to be well established and opens avenues into aqueous host&#8208;guest chemistry with self&#8208;assembled recognition agents.</dc:description>

         <title>Through Bridge Spin Coupling in Homo&#8208; and Heterobimetallic Porphyrin Dimers upon Stepwise Oxidations: A Spectroscopic and Theoretical Investigation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Homo&#8208; and heterobimetallic porphyrin dimers have been synthesized, which, upon 2e&#8208;oxidation, produce stable dication diradical species as shown. Through the bridge, both porphyrin rings exhibited notable conjugation resulting in effective coupling between metal and porphyrin radical spins of both rings while the coupling model dependent on the nature of metal ion used. Mulliken spin density distributions display the Cu(II) porphyrin center as charge donor while Fe(III)/Mn(III) porphyrin center as charge acceptor.







Abstract
We have described copper(II)&#8208;iron(III) and copper(II)&#8208;manganese(III) heterobimetallic porphyrin dimers and compared them with the corresponding homobimetallic analogs. UV&#8208;visible spectra are very distinct in the heterometallic species while electrochemical studies demonstrate that these species, as compared to the homobimetallic analog, are much easier to oxidize. Combined M&#246;ssbauer, EPR, NMR, magnetic and UV&#8208;visible spectroscopic studies show that upon 2e&#8208;oxidation of the heterobimetallic complexes only ring&#8208;centered oxidation occurs. The energy differences between HOMO and LUMO are linearly dependent with the low&#8208;energy NIR band obtained for the 2e&#8208;oxidized complexes. Also, strong electronic communication between two porphyrin rings through the bridge facilitates coupling between various unpaired spins present while the coupling model depends on the nature of metal ions used. While unpaired spins of Fe(III) and the porphyrin &#960;&#8208;cation radical are strongly antiferromagnetically coupled, such coupling is rather weak between Mn(III) and a porphyrin &#960;&#8208;cation radical. Moreover, the coupling between two &#960;&#8208;cation radicals are much stronger in the 2e&#8208;oxidized complexes of dimanganese(III) and copper(II)&#8208;manganese(III) porphyrin dimers as compared to their diiron(III) and copper(II)&#8208;iron(III) analogs. Furthermore, coupling between the unpaired spins of a &#960;&#8208;cation radical and copper(II) is much stronger in the 2e&#8208;oxidized complex of copper(II)&#8208;iron(III) porphyrin dimer as compared to its copper(II)&#8208;manganese(III) analog. The Mulliken spin density distributions in 2e&#8208;oxidized homo&#8208; and heterobimetallic complexes show symmetric and asymmetric spread between the two macrocycles, respectively. In both the 2e&#8208;oxidized heterobimetallic complexes, the Cu(II) porphyrin center acts as a charge donor while Fe(III)/Mn(III) porphyrin center act as a charge acceptor. The experimental observations are also strongly supported by DFT calculations.

         <title>Synthesis of Three&#8208;Dimensional (Di)Azatricyclododecene Scaffold and Its Application to Peptidomimetics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three&#8208;dimensional (3D) scaffolds have the potential to provide unique bioactivity, which cannot be achieved by conventional flat aromatic ring&#8208;based compounds. (Di)Azatricyclododecene scaffold with a bridged tricyclic system was developed and applied to design peptidomimetics with a 3D scaffold. The designed peptidomimetics showed inhibition of HIF transcription activity and antiviral activity toward rabies virus, both of which &#945;&#8208;helix peptide mediated interaction play a pivotal role.







Abstract
A novel sp3 carbon&#8208;rich tricyclic 3D scaffold&#8208;based peptide mimetic compound library was constructed to target protein&#8208;protein interactions. Tricyclic framework 7 was synthesized from 9&#8208;azabicyclo[3,3,1]nonan&#8208;3&#8208;one (11) via a gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed Conia&#8208;ene reaction. The electron&#8208;donating group on the pendant alkyne of cyclization precursor 12&#8201;b&#8211;e was the key to forming 6&#8208;endo&#8208;dig cyclized product 7 with complete regioselectivity. Using the synthetic strategy for regioselective construction of bridged tricyclic framework 7, a diazatricyclododecene 3D&#8208;scaffold 8&#8201;a, which enables the introduction of substituents into the scaffold to mimic amino acid side chains, was designed and synthesized. The peptide mimetics 21&#8201;a&#8211;u were synthesized via step&#8208;by&#8208;step installation of three substituents on diazatricyclododecene scaffold 8&#8201;a. Compounds 21&#8201;a&#8211;h were synthesized as &#945;&#8208;helix peptide mimics of hydrophobic ZZxxZ and ZxxZZ sequences (Z=Leu or Phe) and subjected to cell&#8208;based assays: antiproliferative activity, HIF&#8208;1 transcriptional activity which is considered to affect cancer malignancy, and antiviral activity against rabies virus. Compound 21&#8201;a showed the strongest inhibitory activity of HIF&#8208;1 transcriptional activity (IC50=4.1&#177;0.8&#8197;&#956;M), whereas compounds 21&#8201;a&#8211;g showed antiviral activity with IC50 values of 4.2&#8211;12.4&#8197;&#956;M, suggesting that the 3D&#8208;scaffold 8&#8201;a has potential as a versatile peptide mimic skeleton.

     alt="Synthesis of Three-Dimensional (Di)Azatricyclododecene Scaffold and Its Application to Peptidomimetics"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Three-dimensional&lt;/b&gt; (3D) scaffolds have the potential to provide unique bioactivity, which cannot be achieved by conventional flat aromatic ring-based compounds. (Di)Azatricyclododecene scaffold with a bridged tricyclic system was developed and applied to design peptidomimetics with a 3D scaffold. The designed peptidomimetics showed inhibition of HIF transcription activity and antiviral activity toward rabies virus, both of which &#945;-helix peptide mediated interaction play a pivotal role.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A novel sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; carbon-rich tricyclic 3D scaffold-based peptide mimetic compound library was constructed to target protein-protein interactions. Tricyclic framework &lt;b&gt;7&lt;/b&gt; was synthesized from 9-azabicyclo[3,3,1]nonan-3-one (&lt;b&gt;11)&lt;/b&gt; via a gold(I)-catalyzed Conia-ene reaction. The electron-donating group on the pendant alkyne of cyclization precursor &lt;b&gt;12&#8201;b&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;e&lt;/b&gt; was the key to forming 6-&lt;i&gt;endo&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;dig&lt;/i&gt; cyclized product &lt;b&gt;7&lt;/b&gt; with complete regioselectivity. Using the synthetic strategy for regioselective construction of bridged tricyclic framework &lt;b&gt;7&lt;/b&gt;, a diazatricyclododecene 3D-scaffold &lt;b&gt;8&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt;, which enables the introduction of substituents into the scaffold to mimic amino acid side chains, was designed and synthesized. The peptide mimetics &lt;b&gt;21&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;u&lt;/b&gt; were synthesized via step-by-step installation of three substituents on diazatricyclododecene scaffold &lt;b&gt;8&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt;. Compounds &lt;b&gt;21&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;h&lt;/b&gt; were synthesized as &#945;-helix peptide mimics of hydrophobic ZZxxZ and ZxxZZ sequences (Z=Leu or Phe) and subjected to cell-based assays: antiproliferative activity, HIF-1 transcriptional activity which is considered to affect cancer malignancy, and antiviral activity against rabies virus. Compound &lt;b&gt;21&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt; showed the strongest inhibitory activity of HIF-1 transcriptional activity (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;=4.1&#177;0.8&#8197;&#956;M), whereas compounds &lt;b&gt;21&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;g&lt;/b&gt; showed antiviral activity with IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values of 4.2&#8211;12.4&#8197;&#956;M, suggesting that the 3D-scaffold &lt;b&gt;8&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt; has potential as a versatile peptide mimic skeleton.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Nucleophilicities and Nucleofugalities of Thio&#8208; and Selenoethers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strong nucleophiles and weak Lewis bases: Kinetic studies by laser flash photolytic methods reveal that dialkyl sulfides and selenides are strong nucleophiles, comparable to pyridine and N&#8208;methylimidazole. Because of their low Lewis basicity (6 to 7 orders of magnitude lower than that of pyridine with respect to C&#8208;centred Lewis acids) they are also good nucleofuges, which makes them useful group&#8208;transfer reagents. Low Marcus intrinsic barriers account for the different ranking of dialkyl chalcogenides in nucleophilicity and Lewis basicity scales.







Abstract
Rate constants for the reactions of dialkyl chalcogenides with laser flash photolytically generated benzhydrylium ions have been measured photometrically to integrate them into the comprehensive benzhydrylium&#8208;based nucleophilicity scale. Combining these rate constants with the previously reported equilibrium constants for the same reactions provided the corresponding Marcus intrinsic barriers and made it possible to quantify the leaving group abilities (nucleofugalities) of dialkyl sulfides and dimethyl selenide. Due to the low intrinsic barriers, dialkyl chalcogenides are fairly strong nucleophiles (comparable to pyridine and N&#8208;methylimidazole) as well as good nucleofuges; this makes them useful group&#8208;transfer reagents.

         <title>Highly Enantioselective Synthesis of Phosphorus&#8208;Containing &#1013;&#8208;Benzosultams by Bifunctional Phosphonium Salt&#8208;Promoted Hydrophosphonylation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The crucial ingredients: The first highly enantioselective hydrophosphonylation of seven&#8208;membered cyclic N&#8208;sulfonyl imines by bifunctional phosphonium salt catalysis has been developed, and a broad range of optically pure phosphorus&#8208;containing &#1013;&#8208;benzosultam compounds was readily prepared under mild conditions with very low catalyst loading, easy purification and high yields. The practicality and utility of this protocol were demonstrated by scaled&#8208;up reactions and facile synthetic elaborations. The mechanistic results suggested that the ion&#8208;pair and H&#8208;bonding interactions were crucial in asymmetric induction.







Abstract
&#1013;&#8208;Benzosultam derivatives are potential drug candidates with diverse biological activities. A series of chiral &#1013;&#8208;benzosultams bearing phosphorus functionalities was synthesized by catalytic asymmetric hydrophosphonylation in the presence of a bifunctional phosphonium salt catalyst. The desired hydrophosphonylation products were obtained in good yields with high enantioselectivities, and scale&#8208;up reactions and further derivations were successfully accomplished. Some control experiments were also conducted to elucidate the plausible reaction mechanism of this chemical transformation.

         <title>Experimental and Computational Models for Side Chain Discrimination in Peptide&#8211;Protein Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A model system to study interactions between aromatic cavities and non&#8208;polar side chains was developed and studied by different NMR methods, where a weak but evident side&#8208;chain discrimination was observed. The experimental quantitative and qualitative data was used to evaluate different computational methods, with the conclusion that, for this system, molecular mechanics gave more accurate results than density functional theory calculations.

         <dc:description>
Functional nanomaterials are indispensable to modern technologies and their low&#8208;temperature synthesis is a key&#8208;step to their incorporation in technologically advanced areas. In our pursuit to identify the reagents that are reactive at low temperature, we exploit here the inherent facile decomposition mechanism in the di&#8208;tertiary&#8208;butyl sulfide ligand as a strategy to obtain molecular complexes with ultra&#8208;low decomposition temperature and explore their application as facile precursors to highly crystalline metal sulfide or metallic nanoparticles.

         <title>What is the Catalytic Mechanism of Enzymatic Histone N&#8208;Methyl Arginine Demethylation and Can It be Influenced by an External Electric Field?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methylation of arginine residues in histones is an important mechanism of epigenetic regulation, and its dysregulation results in human diseases such as cancer and brain disorders. This study reveals the catalytic mechanism of the demethylation of methylated arginine R3 in H4 histone by a non&#8208;heme Fe(II) and 2&#8208;Oxoglutarate&#8208;Dependent Histone demethylase 4E (KDM4E). Applying QM/MM and MD, we explored both C&#8211;H and N&#8211;H activations pathways. Importantly, the study revealed that by applying external electric fields (EEFs), we can modulate the C&#8211;H and N&#8211;H selectivities. More information can be found in the Full Paper by C.&#8197;Z. Christov et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101174).

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Photoredox&#8208;Catalyzed Hydrodefluorination of Fluoroarenes Utilizing Amide Solvent as Reductant</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A metal&#8208;free photoredox&#8208;catalyzed hydrodefluorination of fluoroarenes was achieved using  N,N,N&#8217;,N&#8217;  &#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;  para  &#8208;phenylenediamine  (1  ) as a strong photoreduction catalyst. This reaction was applicable not only to electron&#8208;rich monofluoroarenes but also to polyfluoroarenes to afford non&#8208;fluorinated arenes. The experimental mechanistic studies indicated that the amide solvent NMP plays an important role for regeneration of the photocatalyst, enabling additive&#8208;free photoreduction catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Graphene oxide assisted covalent triazine framework for boosting photocatalytic H2 evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs) with two&#8208;dimensional structures have exhibited promising visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced H2 evolution performance. However, it is still a challenge to improve its activity. Herein, we report &#960;&#8208;conjugation&#8208;linked CTF&#8208;1/GO for boosting photocatalytic H2 evolution. The CTF&#8208;1/GO hybrid material was obtained by a facile low&#8208;temperature condensation of 1,4&#8208;Dicyanobenzene in the presence of GO. The results of photocatalytic H2 evolution indicate that the optimum hybrid, CTF&#8208;1/GO&#8208;3.0, exhibited an H2 evolution rate of 2262.4 &#956;mol&#183;g&#8208;1&#183;h&#8208;1 under visible light irradiation, which was 9 times that of pure CTF&#8208;1. The enhanced photocatalytic performance could be attributed to the GO in CTF&#8208;1/GO hybrids not only acts as an electron collector and transporter like a &#8220;bridge&#8221; to facilitate the separation and transfer of photogenerated charges but also shortens the electron migration path due to its thin sheet layer uniformly distribution over CTF&#8208;1. This work could help future development of novel conjugated CTF&#8208;based composite materials as high&#8208;efficiency photocatalyst for photocatalysis.</dc:description>

Structural characterisation of nine of these compounds show they exhibit unusual  trans  [H&#8208;Ni&#8208;PR  2  ] or novel  trans  [R  2  P&#8208;Ni&#8208;PR  2  ] geometries. The bis&#8208;phosphido complexes are more accessible when smaller NHCs (IMe  4  &gt; IEt  2  Me  2  &gt; I  i  Pr) and phosphines are employed. P&#8208;P activation of the diphosphines R  2  P&#8208;PR  2  (R  2  = Ph  2  , PhMe) provides an alternative route to some of the [Ni(NHC)  2  (PR  2  )  2  ] complexes. DFT calculations capture these trends with P&#8208;H bond activation proceeding from unconventional phosphine adducts in which the H substituent bridges the Ni&#8208;P bond. P&#8208;P bond activation from [Ni(NHC)  2  (Ph  2  P&#8208;PPh  2  )] adducts proceeds with computed barriers below 10 kcal/mol. The ability of the [Ni(NHC)  2  ] moiety to afford isolable terminal phosphido products reflects the stability of the Ni&#8208;NHC bond that prevents ligand dissociation and onward reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Stability of AgIII towards Halides in Organosilver(III) Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The involvement of silver in two&#8208;electron processes Ag(I/III) is currently emerging. However, the range of stability of the required and uncommon Ag(III) species is virtually unknown. Here, the stability of Ag(III) towards the whole set of halide ligands in the organosilver(III) complex frame [(CF&#8323;)&#8323;AgX]&#8315; is theoretically analyzed (X = F to At). Even the softest and least electronegative halides (I and At) are found to form reasonably stable Ag(III)&#8211;X bonds. Our estimates were confirmed by experiment. In fact, the whole series of non&#8208;radiative halide complexes [PPh&#8324;][(CF&#8323;)&#8323;AgX] (X = F to I) has been experimentally prepared and isolated in pure form. The pseudohalides [PPh&#8324;][(CF&#8323;)&#8323;AgCN] and [PPh4][(CF&#8323;)&#8323;AgN&#8323;] have also been isolated, the latter being the first silver(III) azido&#8208;complex. Except for the iodo&#8208;compound, the crystal structures have been established by X&#8208;ray diffraction methods. The decomposition paths of the [(CF&#8323;)&#8323;AgX]&#8315; entities at the unimolecular level have been examined in the gas phase by multistage mass spectrometry (MSn). The experimental detection of the two series of mixed complexes [CF&#8323;AgX]&#8315; and [FAgX]&#8315; arising from the corresponding parent species [(CF&#8323;)&#8323;AgX]&#8315; demonstrates that the Ag&#8211;X bond is particularly robust. Our experimental observations are rationalized with the aid of theoretical methods. Smooth variation with the electronegativity of X is also observed in the thermolyses of bulk samples. The experimentally established compatibility of Ag(III) with the heaviest halides is of particular relevance to silver&#8208;mediated or &#8208;catalyzed processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Ni(II) Precatalysts Enable Thioetherification of (Hetero)aryl Halides and Tosylates and Tandem C&#8208;S/C&#8208;N Couplings</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ni&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;S cross&#8208;coupling reactions have received less attention compared with other C&#8208;heteroatom couplings. Most reported examples comprise the thioetherification of most reactive aryl iodides with aromatic thiols. The use of C&#8208;O electrophiles in this context is almost uncharted. Here we describe that preformed Ni(II) precatalysts of the type NiCl(allyl)(PMe  2  Ar&#8217;) (Ar&#8217; = terphenyl group) efficiently couple a wide range of (hetero)aryl halides, including challenging aryl chlorides, with a variety of aromatic and aliphatic thiols. Aryl and alkenyl tosylates are also well tolerated demonstrating, for the first time, to be competent electrophilic partners in Ni&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;S bond formation. The chemoselective functionalization of the C&#8208;I bond in the presence of C&#8208;Cl bond allows for designing site&#8208;selective tandem C&#8208;S/C&#8208;N couplings. The formation of the two C&#8208;heteroatom bonds takes place in a single operation and represents a rare example of dual electrophile/nucleophile chemoselective process.</dc:description>

         <title>Sodium Butylated Hydroxytoluene: A Functional Group Tolerant, Eco&#8208;Friendly Base for Solvent&#8208;Free, Pd&#8208;Catalysed Amination</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>NaBHT, a strong, but hindered and lipophilic base, has been effectively paired with similarly lipophilic, high&#8208;reactivity Pd&#8208;NHC (N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene) catalysts to produce an ideal combination for performing solvent&#8208;free (melt) cross&#8208;coupling amination.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;NaBHT, a strong, but hindered and lipophilic base, has been effectively paired with similarly lipophilic, high-reactivity Pd-NHC (N-heterocyclic carbene) catalysts to produce an ideal combination for performing solvent-free (melt) cross-coupling amination. The mild nucleophilicity of NaBHT, coupled with the anti-oxidant properties of its conjugate acid byproduct, BHT means the process seems to have no functional group incompatibilities. Highly effective coupling of base-sensitive and redox-active functional groups was observed in all cases with only 0.1-0.2 mol percent catalyst. Comparisons using the standard base for this reaction, KOtBu, led to poor couplings or complete degradation in most applications &#8211; only NaBHT works.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bidentate Disilicate Framework for Bis&#8208;Grafted Surface Species</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recent advances in surface organometallic chemistry have enabled the detailed characterization of the surface species in single&#8208;site heterogeneous catalysts. However, the selective formation of bis&#8208;grafted surface species remains challenging because of the heterogeneity of the supporting surface. Herein, we introduce a metal complex bearing bidentate disilicate ligands, &#8211;OSi(O  t  Bu)  2  OSi(O  t  Bu)  2  O&#8211;, as a molecular precursor, which has a silicate framework adjacent to the metal (Pt) center. The grafting of the precursors on silica supports (MCM&#8208;41 and CARiACT Q10) proceeded through a substitution reaction on the silicon atoms of the disilicate ligand, which was verified by the detection of isobutene and  t  BuOH as the elimination products, to selectively yield bis&#8208;grafted surface species. The chemical structure of the surface species was characterized by solid&#8208;state NMR, and the chemical shift values of the ancillary ligands and  195  Pt nuclei suggested that the bidentate coordination sphere was maintained following grafting.</dc:description>

         <title>A Fluorescence Sensor Array Based on Zinc(II)&#8208;Carboxyamidoquinolines: Toward Quantitative Detection of ATP**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorescent carboxyamidoquinoline&#8208;zinc(II) assemblies were investigated as sensors for biologically relevant phosphate anions in water at low concentrations (micromolar). Analyte&#8208;specific changes in fluorescence allow for differentiation of inorganic phosphate, pyrophosphate, ADP, and ATP from eight other anionic analytes in a HEPES buffer. A fluorescence based array enabled quantitative analysis of ATP in the concentration range of 5&#8211;100&#8197;&#956;M.







Abstract
The newly prepared fluorescent carboxyamidoquinolines (1&#8211;3) and their Zn(II) complexes (Zn@1&#8208;Zn@3) were used to bind and sense various phosphate anions utilizing a relay mechanism, in which the Zn(II) ion migrates from the Zn@1&#8208;Zn@3 complexes to the phosphate, namely adenosine 5&#8217;&#8208;triphosphate (ATP) and pyrophosphate (PPi), a process accompanied by a dramatic change in fluorescence. Zn@1&#8208;Zn@3 assemblies interact with adenine nucleotide phosphates while displaying an analyte&#8208;specific response. This process was investigated using UV&#8208;vis, fluorescence, and NMR spectroscopy. It is shown that the different binding selectivity and the corresponding fluorescence response enable differentiation of adenosine 5&#8217;&#8208;triphosphate (ATP), adenosine 5&#8217;&#8208;diphosphate (ADP), pyrophosphate (PPi), and phosphate (Pi). The cross&#8208;reactive nature of the carboxyamidoquinolines&#8208;Zn(II) sensors in conjunction with linear discriminant analysis (LDA) was utilized in a simple fluorescence chemosensor array that allows for the identification of ATP, ADP, PPi, and Pi from 8 other anions including adenosine 5&#8217;&#8208;monophosphate (AMP) with 100&#8201;% correct classification. Furthermore, the support vector machine algorithm, a machine learning method, allowed for highly accurate quantitation of ATP in the range of 5&#8211;100&#8197;&#956;M concentration in unknown samples with error &lt;2.5&#8201;%.

         <title>Non&#8208;Covalent Interactions in the Biphenyl Crystal: Is the Planar Conformer a Transition State?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Planar biphenyl is a stable minimum on the quantum mechanical potential energy surface of the crystal. The lack of thermal disorder in the phase I at 100&#8197;K and the properties of the experimental and theoretical electron densities support this conclusion. The crystal packing is mostly determined by intra and intermolecular hydrogen&#8208;hydrogen bonding, non&#8208;covalent 
 interactions and internal rotation of the biphenyl molecule.







Abstract
A combined experimental and theoretical study of the biphenyl (BP) crystal is presented. The X&#8208;ray diffraction data collected at 100&#8197;K were subjected to Hirshfeld atom and multipole refinements of the electron density, &#961;(r). A theoretical exploration of the potential energy surface (PES) of the crystal was also carried out. This investigation challenges the common assumption that the planar structure of BP in the phase I crystal is an average of two twisted configurations in a double&#8208;well potential. The theoretical computations provide compelling evidence that this structure corresponds to a minimum on the PES hence to a stable molecular arrangement. Consistently, the experiment showed no evidence of positional or dynamic disorder. The intramolecular hydrogen&#8208;hydrogen bonds detected are not repulsive. The topological analysis of the experimental and theoretical &#961;(r) reveals that both the intra&#8208; and intermolecular H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H and the C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; contacts stabilize the BP crystal.

Abstract
The separation of ethane/ethylene mixture by using metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) as adsorbents is strongly associated with the pore size&#8208;sieving effect and the adsorbent&#8208;adsorbate interaction. Herein, solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy is utilized to explore the host&#8208;guest interaction and ethane/ethylene separation mechanism on zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs). Preferential access to the ZIF&#8208;8 and ZIF&#8208;8&#8208;90 frameworks by ethane compared to ethylene is directly visualized from two&#8208;dimensional 1H&#8208;1H spin diffusion MAS NMR spectroscopy and further verified by computational density distributions. The 1H MAS NMR spectroscopy provides an alternative for straightforwardly extracting the adsorption selectivity of ethane/ethylene mixture at 1.1&#8764;9.6&#8197;bar in ZIFs, which is consistent with the IAST predictions.

         <title>Unveiling Polymerization Mechanism in pH&#8208;regulated Supramolecular Fibers in Aqueous Media</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis and self&#8208;assembly in aqueous media of an amine functionalized C3&#8208;symmetric benzotrithiophene is reported. A dramatic change in the polymerization mechanism and size of the supramolecular fibers is observed upon modifying the pH, which is further employed to finely control the one&#8208;dimensional supramolecular polymerization and copolymerization processes.







Abstract
An amine functionalized C3&#8208;symmetric benzotrithiophene (BTT) monomer has been designed and synthetized in order to form pH responsive one&#8208;dimensional supramolecular polymers in aqueous media. While most of the reported studies looked at the effect of pH on the size of the aggregates, herein, a detailed mechanistic study is reported, carried out upon modifying the pH to trigger the formation of positively charged ammonium groups. A dramatic and reversible change in the polymerization mechanism and size of the supramolecular fibers is observed and ascribed to the combination of Coulombic repulsive forces and higher monomer solubility. Furthermore, the induced frustrated growth of the fibers is further employed to finely control the one&#8208;dimensional supramolecular polymerisation and copolymerization processes.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An amine functionalized C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-symmetric benzotrithiophene (BTT) monomer has been designed and synthetized in order to form pH responsive one-dimensional supramolecular polymers in aqueous media. While most of the reported studies looked at the effect of pH on the size of the aggregates, herein, a detailed mechanistic study is reported, carried out upon modifying the pH to trigger the formation of positively charged ammonium groups. A dramatic and reversible change in the polymerization mechanism and size of the supramolecular fibers is observed and ascribed to the combination of Coulombic repulsive forces and higher monomer solubility. Furthermore, the induced frustrated growth of the fibers is further employed to finely control the one-dimensional supramolecular polymerisation and copolymerization processes.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Synthesis of Cu&#8208;Modified Nickel Oxide Nanocrystals and Their Applications as Hole&#8208;Injection layers for Quantum&#8208;Dot Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>

A simple post&#8208;synthetic surface&#8208;modification strategy to anchor Cu species onto the surfaces of as&#8208;prepared NiOx nanocrystals, leading to Cu&#8208;modified NiOx (NiOx&#8208;Cu) nanocrystals was developed. The low&#8208;temperature&#8208;processed (135&#8201;&#176;C) films based on the NiOx&#8208;Cu nanocrystals show enhanced conductance, which is beneficial for use as hole&#8208;injection layers for quantum&#8208;dot light&#8208;emitting diodes.







Abstract
Solution&#8208;processed NiOx thin films have been applied as hole&#8208;injection layers (HILs) in quantum&#8208;dot light&#8208;emitting diodes (QLEDs). The commonly used NiOx HILs are prepared by the precursor&#8208;based route, which requires high annealing temperatures of over 275&#8201;&#176;C to in&#8197;situ convert the precursors into oxide films. Such high processing temperatures of NiOx HILs hinder their applications in flexible devices. Herein, we report a low&#8208;temperature approach based on Cu&#8208;modified NiOx (NiOx&#8208;Cu) nanocrystals to prepare HILs. A simple post&#8208;synthetic surface&#8208;modification step, which anchors the copper agents onto the surfaces of oxide nanocrystals, is developed to improve the electrical conductivity of the low&#8208;temperature&#8208;processed (135&#8201;&#176;C) oxide&#8208;nanocrystal thin films. In consequence, QLEDs based on the NiOx&#8208;Cu HILs exhibit an external quantum efficiency of 17.5&#8201;% and a T95 operational lifetime of &#8764;2,800&#8197;h at an initial brightness of 1,000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2, meeting the commercialization requirements for display applications. The results shed light on the potential of using NiOx&#8208;Cu HILs for realizing high&#8208;performance flexible QLEDs.

         <title>Molecular Recognition of Nerve Agents and Their Organophosphorus Surrogates:&#160;Toward Supramolecular Scavengers and Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nerve agents are tetrahedral organophosphorus compounds (OPs) that were developed in the last century to irreversibly inhibit acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and therefore impede neurological signaling in living organisms. Exposure to OPs leads to a rapid development of symptoms from excessive salivation, nasal congestion and chest pain to convulsion and asphyxiation which if left untreated may lead to death. These potent toxins are prepared on a large scale from inexpensive staring materials, making it feasible for terrorist groups or states to use them against military and civilians. The existing antidotes provide limited protection and are difficult to apply to a large number of affected individuals. While new prophylactics are currently being developed, there is still need for therapeutics capable of both preventing and reversing the effects of OP poisoning. In this review, we describe how the science of molecular recognition can expand the pallet of tools for rapid and safe sequestration of nerve agents.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A novel electrochemical protocol for the oxidative cleavage of indoles has been developed, which o&#64256;ers a simple way to access synthetically useful anthranilic acid derivatives. In undivided cells, a wide variety of indoles and alcohol compounds are examined to a&#64256;ord amide ester aromatics without using extra oxidants and stoichiometric metal catalysts, which avoids the formation of undesired by&#8208;products and exhibits high atom economy. The products we described in this perspective represent synthetic intermediate in numerous drug molecules and industrial chemical reagents and remarkably shows potential application in future.</dc:description>

         <title>Factors Controlling the Aluminium(I)&#8208;meta&#8208;selective C&#8722;H Activation in Arenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The so far poorly understood factors controlling the complete meta&#8208;selectivity observed in the C&#8722;H activation reactions of alkylarenes promoted by aluminyl anions have been explored in detail by means of Density Functional Theory calculations. To this end, a combination of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art computational methods, namely the activation strain model of reactivity and energy decomposition analysis, has been applied to quantitatively unveil the origin of the selectivity of the transformation as well as the influence of the associated potassium cation. It is found that the selectivity takes place during the initial nucleophilic addition step where the key LP(Al)&#8594;&#960;*(C=C) molecular orbital interaction is more stabilizing for the meta&#8208;pathway, which results in a stronger interaction between the reactants along the entire transformation.</dc:description>

         <title>Calcination&#8208;Free Synthesis of Well&#8208;Dispersed and Sub&#8208;10 nm Spinel Ferrite Nanoparticles as High&#8208;Performance Anode Materials for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries: A Case Study of CoFe2O4</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Spinel ferrites are promising anode materials for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) owing to their high theoretical specific capacities. However, their practical application is impeded by inherent low conductivity and severe volume expansion, which can be surpassed by increasing surface&#8208;to&#8208;volume ratio of nanoparticles. Currently, most methods produce spinel ferrite nanoparticles with large size and severe aggregation, degrading their electrochemical performance. In this study, a low temperature aminolytic route was designed to synthesize sub&#8208;10 nm CoFe  2  O  4  nanoparticles with good dispersion through carefully exploiting the reaction of acetates and oleylamine. The performance of CoFe  2  O  4  nanoparticles obtained by traditional co&#8208;precipitation method was also investigated for comparison. This work demonstrates that CoFe  2  O  4  nanoparticles synthesized by the aminolytic route are promising as anode materials for LIBs. Besides, this method can be extended to design other spinel ferrites for energy storage devices with superior performance by simply changing the starting material, such as MnFe  2  O  4  , MgFe  2  O  4  , ZnFe  2  O  4  , and so on.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Efficient Trityl&#8208;nitroxide Biradicals for Biomolecular High&#8208;field Dynamic Nuclear Polarization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) is a powerful method to enhance the sensitivity of solid&#8208;state magnetic nuclear resonance (ssNMR) spectroscopy. However, its biomolecular applications at high magnetic fields (preferably &gt; 14 T) have so far been limited by the intrinsically low efficiency of polarizing agents and sample preparation aspects. Herein, we report a new class of trityl&#8208;nitroxide biradicals, dubbed SNAPols that combine high DNP efficiency with greatly enhanced hydrophilicity. SNAPol&#8208;1, the best compound in the series, shows DNP enhancement factors at 18.8 T of more than 100 in small molecules and globular proteins and also exhibits strong DNP enhancements in membrane proteins and cellular preparations. By integrating optimal sensitivity and high resolution, we expect widespread applications of this new polarizing agent in high&#8208;field DNP/ssNMR spectroscopy, especially for complex biomolecules.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The synthesis of 2,9&#8208;diaza&#8208;1,3,8,10&#8208;tetratriflato&#8208;dibenzoperylene (DDP 3a) and corresponding 2,9&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1,3,8,10&#8208;tetratriflato&#8208;dibenzoperylene (DBP 3b) has been developed at multigram scale via reduction of one of the industrially most important high&#8208;performance dyes, perylene&#8208;3,4,9,10&#8208;tetracarboxylic diimide (PTCDI), and of corresponding dihydroxy peropyrenequinone precursor. The focus of this paper is on the reactivity pattern of 3a as key intermediate towards highly functionalized 2,9&#8208;diazadibenzopyrelenes (DDPs) obtained via catalytic substitution of four triflate by aryl, heteroaryl, alkynyl, aminyl, and O&#8208;phosphanyl substituents. The influence of electron&#8208;donating substituents (&#8208;OSiMe3, &#8208;OPtBu2, &#8208;N&#8208;piperidinyl), electron&#8208;withdrawing (OTf, 3,5&#8208;bis&#8208;trifluoromethyl&#8208;phenyl) and of electron&#8208;rich &#960;&#8208;conjugated (2&#8208;thienyl, 4&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphenyl, trimethylsilyl&#8208;ethynyl) substituents on optoelectronic and structural properties of these functionalized DDPs has been investigated via XRD analyses, UV&#8208;Vis, PL spectroscopy, and by electroanalytical CV. These results were correlated to results of DFT and TD&#8208;DFT calculations. Thus, functionalized DPPs with easily tunable HOMO and LUMO energies and gap became available via a new and reliable synthetic strategy starting from readily available PTCDI.</dc:description>

         <title>Polymer Nanodiscs and their Bioanalytical Potential</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Membrane proteins (MPs) play a pivotal role in cellular function and are therefore predominant pharmaceutical targets. Although detailed understanding of MP structure and mechanistic activity is invaluable for rational drug design, challenges are associated with the purification and study of MPs. This review delves into historical developments preluding the currently available membrane mimetic technologies before shining a spotlight on polymer nanodiscs. These are soluble nanosized particles capable of encompassing MPs embedded in a phospholipid annular. The expanding range of reported amphipathic polymer nanodisc materials are presented and discussed in terms of their tolerance to different solution conditions and their nanodisc properties. Finally, the analytical scope of polymer nanodiscs is considered in both the demonstration of basic nanodisc parameters as well as in the elucidation of structures, lipid&#8208;protein interactions, and functional mechanisms of reconstituted membrane proteins. The final emphasis is given to the unique benefits and applications demonstrated for native nanodiscs accessed through a detergent free process.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Graphdiyne  (g&#8208;C  n  H  2n&#8208;2  ), as a novel two&#8208;dimension carbon allotrope material composed of sp&#8208; and sp  2  &#8208;hybrid carbon network, has been widely explored since it was synthesized for the first time by Li&#8217;s group in 2010. A series distinct and excellent properties bestow graphdiyne excellent performance in many fields  . Here, an innovative progress for preparing graphdiyne by using Cu  +  contained material as catalyst is reported and the composite CuI&#8208;GD is coupled with flower&#8208;like  NiAl&#8208;LDH  to produce H  2  from photocatalytic water splitting. The results of FTIR and Raman together reveal that graphdiyne nanosheets are synthesized successfully by employing cross&#8208;coupling method. Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance shows that the hydrogen production activity of  CuI&#8208;GD/NiAl&#8208;LDH  has a 15&#8208; and 216&#8208;fold enhancement compared with CuI&#8208;GD and NiAl&#8208;LDH, respectively. A series of characterizations are carried out to expound the underlying reasons in the enhancement of photocatalytic hydrogen production performance of CuI&#8208;GD/NiAl&#8208;LDH.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The separation of alkanes, particularly monobranched and dibranched isomers, is of paramount importance in petrochemical industry for optimizing the feedstock of ethylene production as well as for upgrading the octane number of gasoline. Here we report the full separation of linear/monobranched alkanes from their dibranched isomers by a robust and easily scalable metal&#8208;organic framework material, Co3(HCOO)6. The compound completely excludes dibranched alkanes but adsorbs their linear and monobranched isomers, as evidenced by single&#8208;component and multicomponent adsorption measurements. More importantly, the material exhibits excellent performance in separating naphtha and is capable of providing high quality feedstock for the production of ethylene and gasoline components with high octane number, making it a promising candidate for naphtha separation in petrochemical industry.</dc:description>

         <title>Low concentration C2H6 capture enabled by size matching in the ultramicropore</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Low concentration ethane capture is crucial for environmental protection and natural gas purification. The ideal physisorbent with strong C 2 H 6 interaction and large C 2 H 6 uptake at low&#8208;concentration level has rarely been reported, due to the large p K a value and small quadrupole moment of C 2 H 6 . Herein, we demonstrate the perfectly size matching between the ultramicropore (pore size of 4.6 &#197;) and ethane (kinetic diameter of 4.4 &#197;) in a nickel pyridine&#8208;4&#8208;carboxylate metal&#8208;organic framework ( PC&#8208;4&#8208;Ni ), which enables the record&#8208;breaking performance for low concentration C 2 H 6 capture. PC&#8208;4&#8208;Ni exhibits the large C 2 H 6 adsorption enthalpy of 56.7 kJ/mol, and record&#8208;high C 2 H 6 uptake at low pressure of 0.01&#8208;0.1 bar and 298 K (1.8 mmol/g at 0.01 bar). Molecule simulations and C 2 H 6 &#8208;loading crystal structure analysis revealed that the maximized interaction sites in PC&#8208;4&#8208;Ni with ethane molecule originates the strong C 2 H 6 adsorption. The dynamic breakthrough experiments for gas mixtures of C 2 H 6 /N 2 (1/999, v / v ) and C 2 H 6 /CH 4 (5/95, v / v ) proved the excellent low&#8208;concentration C 2 H 6 capture performance.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Low concentration ethane capture is crucial for environmental protection and natural gas purification. The ideal physisorbent with strong C 2 H 6 interaction and large C 2 H 6 uptake at low-concentration level has rarely been reported, due to the large p K a value and small quadrupole moment of C 2 H 6 . Herein, we demonstrate the perfectly size matching between the ultramicropore (pore size of 4.6 &#197;) and ethane (kinetic diameter of 4.4 &#197;) in a nickel pyridine-4-carboxylate metal-organic framework ( PC-4-Ni ), which enables the record-breaking performance for low concentration C 2 H 6 capture. PC-4-Ni exhibits the large C 2 H 6 adsorption enthalpy of 56.7 kJ/mol, and record-high C 2 H 6 uptake at low pressure of 0.01-0.1 bar and 298 K (1.8 mmol/g at 0.01 bar). Molecule simulations and C 2 H 6 -loading crystal structure analysis revealed that the maximized interaction sites in PC-4-Ni with ethane molecule originates the strong C 2 H 6 adsorption. The dynamic breakthrough experiments for gas mixtures of C 2 H 6 /N 2 (1/999, v / v ) and C 2 H 6 /CH 4 (5/95, v / v ) proved the excellent low-concentration C 2 H 6 capture performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Varying both chromophores enables different communication pathways between the chromophores, exploiting aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) and energy transfer (ET) properties, and thus, furnishing aggregation&#8208;based fluorescence switches.

         <title>Controlling Site&#8208;Directed RNA Editing by Chemically Induced Dimerization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Various RNA&#8208;targeting approaches have been engineered to modify specific sites on endogenous transcripts, breaking new ground for a variety of basic research tools and promising clinical applications in the future. Here, we combine site&#8208;directed adenosine&#8208;to&#8208;inosine RNA editing with chemically induced dimerization. Specifically, we achieve tight and dose&#8208;dependent control of the editing reaction with gibberellic acid, and obtain editing yields up to 20 % and 44 % in the endogenous STAT1 and GAPDH transcript in cell culture. Furthermore, the disease&#8208;relevant MECP2 R106Q mutation was repaired with editing yields up to 42 %. The introduced principle will enable new applications where temporal or spatiotemporal control of an RNA&#8208;targeting mechanism is desired.</dc:description>

         <title>Germyliumylidene: A Versatile Low Valent Group 14 Catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bis&#8208;NHC stabilized germyliumylidenes [RGe(NHC)2]+ are typically Lewis basic (LB) in nature, owing to their lone pair and coordination of two NHCs to the vacant p&#8208;orbitals of the germanium atom. However, they can also show Lewis acidity (LA) via Ge&#8208;CNHC&#963;* orbital. Utilizing this unique electronic feature, we report the first example of bis&#8208;NHC&#8208;stabilized germyliumylidene [MesTerGe(NHC)2]Cl (1), (MesTer= 2,6&#8208;(2,4,6&#8208;Me3C6H2)2C6H3; NHC= IMe4 = 1,3,4,5&#8208;tetramethylimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) catalyzed reduction of CO2 with amines and silane, which proceeds via its Lewis basic nature. In contrast, the Lewis acid nature of 1 is utilized in the catalyzed hydroboration and cyanosilylation of carbonyls. Thus, highlighting the versatile ambiphilic nature of bis&#8208;NHC stabilized germyliumylidenes.</dc:description>

         <title>Modulating by molecular design the enantiodiscrimination features of inherently chiral selectors: a HPLC and voltammetry study case with atropisomeric 2,2&#8217;&#8208; biindole based monomers and oligomer films</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new family of inherently chiral electroactive selectors based on the 2,2&#8217;&#8208;biindole atropisomeric scaffold, of easy synthesis and modulable functional properties, is introduced and studied in cascade in two enantioselection contests. They are at first investigated as probes in enantioselective HPLC, studying molecular structure and temperature effects, and achieving very efficient semipreparative enantioseparation. The enantiomers thus obtained, of remarkable chiroptical features (optical rotation as well as circular dichroism), are successfully applied as selectors in chiral voltammetry in different media for discrimination of the enantiomers of chiral electroactive probes, either by conversion into enantiopure electroactive electrode surfaces by electrooligomerization on glassy carbon substrate (the two monomers with shorter alkyl chains), or as chiral additive in achiral ionic liquid (the monomer with longest alkyl chains). Discrimination is conveniently and reproducibly achieved in terms of significant potential differences for the two enantiomers, specularly inverting either probe or selector configuration. In one case successful discrimination is also observed with the two probe enantiomers concurrently present, either as racemate or with enantiomeric excesses, neatly accounted for by the peak current ratios.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral Resolution of Spin&#8208;Crossover Active Iron(II) [2x2] Grid Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral magnetic materials are proposed for applications in second&#8208;order non&#8208;linear optics, magneto&#8208;chiral dichroism, among others. Recently, we have reported a set of tetra&#8208;nuclear Fe(II) grid complex conformers with general formula C/S&#8208;[Fe  4  L  4  ]  8+  (L: 2,6&#8208;bis(6&#8208;(pyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;1,5&#8208;dihydrobenzo[1,2&#8208;d:4,5&#8208;d']diimidazole). In the grid complexes, isomerism emerges from tautomerism and conformational isomerism of the ligand L, and the S&#8208;type grid complex is chiral, which originates from different non&#8208;centrosymmetric spatial organization of the trans type ligand around the Fe(II) center. However, the selective preparation of an enantiomerically pure grid complex in a controlled manner is difficult due to spontaneous self&#8208;assembly. To achieve the pre&#8208;synthesis programmable resolution of Fe(II) grid complexes, we designed and synthesized two novel intrinsically chiral ligands by appending chiral moieties to the parent ligand. The complexation of these chiral ligands with Fe(II) salt resulted in the formation of enantiomerically pure Fe(II) grid complexes, as unambiguously elucidated by CD and XRD studies. The enantiomeric complexes exhibited similar gradual and half&#8208;complete thermal and photo&#8208;induced SCO characteristics. The good agreement between the experimentally obtained and calculated CD spectra further supports the enantiomeric purity of the complexes and even the magnetic studies. The chiral resolution of Fe(II)&#8208; [2x2] grid complexes reported in this study, for the first time, might enable the fabrication of magneto&#8208;chiral molecular devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Promotion of Proton Conductivity by Encapsulation Metal&#8208;Organic Polyhedra in Metal&#8722;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A Zr&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic polyhedra (MOP) was self&#8208;assembled in a porous MOF host, DUT&#8208;68, successively to synthesize MOP&#8208;1@DUT&#8208;68. The MOP guest (MOP&#8208;1) has the size of  ca.  20 &#197; (diameter), lager than that of the square windows (pore sizes of &#8764;14 &#197;) of DUT&#8208;68 but smaller than that of the rhombicuboctahedral cage (27.7 &#197;), which makes that the migration and leaching of MOP&#8208;1 could be effectively prohibited if MOP&#8208;1 is encapsulated in the MOFs&#8217; cavities.

         <dc:description>Rechargeable magnesium battery attracts lots of attention because of its high safety and low cost compared to lithium battery, and it is needed to develop more efficient electrode materials. Although MgMn  2  O  4  is a promising material for the positive electrode in Mg rechargeable batteries, it usually exhibits poor cyclability. To improve the electrochemical behavior, we have prepared nanoparticles of MgMn  2&#8208;y  Fe  y  O  4  . The XRD results have confirmed that when Mn  3+  (Jahn&#8208;Teller ion) ions are replaced by Fe  3+  (non Jahn&#8208;Teller ion), the resulting MgMn  2&#8208;y  Fe  y  O  4  is a cubic phase. The structure and theoretical voltage are theoretically calculated by using the DFT method. The obtained samples have been chemically treated in acid solution for partial demagnesiation, and it is observed that the presence of iron inhibits the deinsertion of Mg through disproportionation and favors the exchange reaction. The electrochemical behavior in non&#8208;aqueous magnesium cells has been explored.</dc:description>

         <title>Remodeling of the Fibrillation Pathway of &#945;&#8208;Synuclein by Interaction with Antimicrobial Peptide LL&#8208;III</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS) has emerged as a key mechanism for intracellular organization, and many recent studies have provided important insights into the role of LLPS in cell biology. There is also evidence that LLPS is associated with a variety of medical conditions, including neurodegenerative disorders. Pathological aggregation of &#945;&#8208;synuclein, which is causally linked to Parkinson&#8217;s disease, can proceed via droplet condensation, which then gradually transitions to the amyloid state. We show that the antimicrobial peptide LL&#8208;III is able to interact with both monomers and condensates of a&#8208;synuclein, leading to stabilization of the droplet and preventing conversion to the fibrillar state. The anti&#8208;aggregation activity of LL&#8208;III was also confirmed in a cellular model. We anticipate that studying the interaction of antimicrobial&#8208;type peptides with liquid condensates such as a&#8208;synuclein will contribute to the understanding of disease mechanisms (that arise in such condensates) and may also open up exciting new avenues for intervention.</dc:description>

         <title>Application of the Redox&#8208;Transmetallation Procedure to Access Divalent Lanthanide and Alkaline&#8208;Earth NHC Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Divalent lanthanide and alkaline&#8208;earth complexes supported by  N  &#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands have been accessed by redox&#8208;transmetallation between air&#8208;stable NHC&#8211;AgI complexes and the corresponding metals. Using the small ligand 1,3&#8208;dimethylimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene (IMe), two series of isostructural complexes were obtained: the tetra&#8208;NHC complexes [LnI  2  (IMe)  4  ] (Ln = Eu and Sm) and the bis&#8208;NHC complexes [MI  2  (IMe)  2  (THF)  2  ] (M = Yb, Ca and Sr). In the former, distortions in NHC coordination were found to originate from intermolecular repulsions in the solid state. Application of the redox&#8208;transmetallation strategy with the bulkier 1,3&#8208;dimesitylimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene (IMes) ligand yielded [SrI  2  (IMes)(THF)  3  ] while using a similar procedure with Ca metal led to [CaI  2  (THF)  4  ] and uncoordinated IMes. DFT calculations were performed to rationalise the selective formation of the bis&#8208;NHC adduct in [SrI  2  (IMe)  2  (THF)  2  ] and the tetra&#8208;NHC adduct in [SmI  2  (IMe)  4  ]. Since the results in the gas phase point towards preferential formation of the tetra&#8208;NHC complexes for both metal centres, the differences between both complexes are a result of solid&#8208;state effects such as slightly different packing forces.</dc:description>

         <title>Infrared Responsive Choline Phosphate Lipids for Cancer Synergistic Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Choline phosphate lipids have been designed and developed as new generation zwitterionic nanocarriers with excellent biocompatibility and bioorthogonality to provide more programmable performance for cancer therapy. However, there is a lack of spatiotemporal and reversible control for drug release at target tumor cells, which may lead to severe adverse effects to normal tissue and discounted treatment outcome. Here, we developed a light&#8208;inducible Lip&#8208;cRGDfk/ICG/Dox liposomes for synergistic cancer therapy. ICG can effectively convert light energy into achieve selective heating in a local environment upon laser irradiation, thus to induce the thermal ablation of tumor cells, and further reversibly trigger the spatiotemporal release of anticancer drugs (Dox) at tumor cells due to the conformation transformation of CP lipids to synergistically kill tumor cells. We also demonstrate the Lip&#8208;cRGDfk/ICG/Dox exhibited significant improvement for breast cancer therapy in vitro and in vivo, which can serve as an efficient platform to noninvasively and spatiotemporally control cytotoxicity activation at tumor cells for precision cancer therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Bulky Barbiturates as Non&#8208;toxic Ionic Dye Insulators for Enhanced Emission in Polymeric Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bulky hydrophobic counterions (weakly coordinating anions) can insulate ionic dyes against aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) and enable preparation of highly fluorescent dye&#8208;loaded nanoparticles (NPs) for bioimaging, biosensing and light harvesting. Here, we introduce a family of hydrophobic anions based on fluorinated C &#8208;acyl barbiturates with delocalized negative charge and bulky non&#8208;polar groups. Similarly to fluorinated tetraphenylborates, these barbiturates prevent ACQ of cationic dye alkyl rhodamine B inside polymer NPs made of biodegradable poly(lactic&#8208;co&#8208;glycolic acid) (PLGA). Their efficiency to prevent ACQ increases for analogues with higher acidity and bulkiness. Their structure controls dye&#8208;dye communication, yielding bright NPs with on/off switching or stable emission. They enhance dye encapsulation inside NPs, allowing intracellular imaging without dye leakage. Compared to fluorinated tetraphenylborates known as cytotoxic transmembrane ion transporters, the barbiturates display a significantly lower cytotoxicity. These chemically available and versatile barbiturate derivatives are promising counterion scaffolds for preparation of bright non&#8208;toxic fluorescent nanomaterials.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Redox Neutral Direct C&#8208;H Amination of Glycine Derivatives and Peptides with N&#8208;Acyloxyphthalimides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract: Abstract

A room temperature, visible-light-promoted and redox neutral direct C-H amination of glycine and peptides has been firstly accomplished by using  N  -acyloxyphthalimide or -succinimide as nitrogen-radical precursor. The present strategy provides ways to introduce functionalities such as  N  -acyloxyphthalimide or -succinimide specifically to terminal glycine segment of peptides. Herein, mild conditions and high functional-group tolerance allow the preparation of non-natural &#945;-amino acids and modification of corresponding peptides in this way.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
