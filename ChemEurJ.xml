      <title>Efficient Deep Blue Platinum Acetylide Phosphors with Acyclic Diaminocarbene Ligands</title>
      <dc:description>Here we report five blue&#8208;phosphorescent platinum bis&#8208;phenylacetylide complexes with an investigation of their photophysical and electrochemical attributes. Three of the complexes (  1  &#8211;  3  ) are of the general formula  cis  &#8208;Pt(CNR)  2  (C&#8801;CPh)  2  , where CNR is a variably substituted isocyanide and C&#8801;CPh is phenylacetylide. These isocyanide complexes serve as precursors for complexes of the general formula  cis  &#8208;Pt(CNR)(ADC)(C&#8801;CPh)  2  (  4  and  5  ), where ADC is an acyclic diaminocarbene installed by amine nucleophilic addition to one of the isocyanides. All of the complexes exhibit deep blue phosphorescence with &#955;  max  ~430 nm in poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) thin films. Whereas isocyanide complexes  1  &#8211;  3  exhibit modest photoluminescence quantum yields (  &#934;  PL  ), incorporation of one acyclic diaminocarbene ligand results in a three&#8208;fold to 16&#8208;fold increase in  &#934;  PL  while still maintaining an identical deep blue color profile.</dc:description>

      <title>Ru/CdS quantum dots templated on clay nanotubes as visible light active photocatalysts: optimization of S/Cd ratio and Ru content</title>
      <dc:description>Nanoarchitectual approach based on in situ quantum dots formation within/outside clay nanotubes was developed. The efficient and stable photocatalysts active under visible light were achieved with ruthenium doped cadmium sulfide quantum dots templated on the surface of azine modified halloysite nanotubes. The catalytic activity was tested in hydrogen evolution reaction from water solution of electrolytes under visible light. Ru doping enhanced the photocatalytic activity of CdS quantum dots thanks to better light adsorption and electron&#8208;hole pair separation due to formation of metal&#8208;semiconductor heterojunction. We found that sulfur to cadmium ratio (S/Cd) was the major factor for stable nanoparticles formation on the surface of the azine modified clay. The quantum yield of 9.3% was reached using Ru/CdS/Halloysite containing 5.2 wt. % of Cd doped with 0.1 wt. % of Ru and S/Cd ratio equaling one. CdS/Halloysite hybrid in vivo and in vitro studies demonstrated an absence of toxic effect in eukaryotic cells and nematodes in short term tests, thus providing promising photosensitive materials for multiple applications.</dc:description>

      <title>N&#8208;aryl amides as chemical exchange saturation transfer magnetic resonance imaging contrast agents</title>
      <dc:description>Chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) MRI has recently emerged as a versatile molecular imaging approach in which diamagnetic compounds can be utilized to generate MRI signal. To expand the scope of CEST MRI applications, herein, we systematically investigated the CEST properties of N&#8208;aryl amides with different N&#8208;aromatic substitution, revealing their chemical shifts (4.6&#8208;5.8 ppm) and exchange rates (up to thousands s  &#8208;1  ) are favorable to be used as CEST agents as compared to alkyl amide. As the first proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study, we used CEST MRI to detect the enzymatic metabolism of the drug acebutolol directly by its intrinsic CEST signal without any chemical labeling. Our study implies that N&#8208;acryl amides may enable the label&#8208;free CEST MRI detection of the metabolism of many N&#8208;aryl amide&#8208;containing drugs and a variety of enzymes that act on N&#8208;aryl amide, greatly expanding the scope of CEST MR molecular imaging.</dc:description>

      <title>New Organometallic Ruthenium(II) Compounds Synergistically Show Cytotoxic, Antimetastatic and Antiangiogenic Activities for the Treatment of Metastatic Cancer</title>
      <dc:description>In this study, we newly designed and synthesized a small library of ten structurally related C,N&#8208;cyclometalated ruthenium(II) complexes containing various pyridine&#8208;functionalized NHC ligand and chelating bipyridyl ligands (e.g., 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine, 5,5&#8217;&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine, and 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline (phen)). The complexes were well characterized by NMR, electrospray ionization&#8208;mass spectrometry, and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structure analyses. Among the new ruthenium(II) derivatives, we identified that the complex  Ru8  bearing bulky moieties (i.e., phen and pentamethyl benzene) had the most potent cytotoxicity against all tested cancer cell lines, generating dose&#8208; and cell line&#8208;dependent IC  50  values at the range of 3.3&#8208;15.0 &#956;M. More significantly,  Ru8  not only efficiently inhibited the antimetastasis process against invasion and migration of tumor cells but also exhibited potent antivascular effects by suppressing HUVEC cells migration and tube formation  in vitro  and blocking vessel generation  in vivo  (chicken chorioallantoic membrane model). In a metastatic A2780 tumor xenograft&#8208;bearing mouse model, administration of  Ru8  outperformed antimetastatic agent NAMI&#8208;A and clinically approved cisplatin in terms of antitumor efficacy and inhibition of metastases to other organs. Overall, these data provided compelling evidence that the new cyclometalated ruthenium complex  Ru  8  is an attractive agent because of synergistically suppressing bulky tumors and metastasized tumor nudes. Therefore, the complex  Ru  8  deserves further investigations.</dc:description>

      <title>What is best strategy for water soluble fluorescence dyes? &#8211; A case study using long fluorescence lifetime DAOTA dyes</title>
      <dc:description>The lipophilic nature of organic dyes complicates their effectiveness in aqueous solutions. In this work we investigate three different strategies for achieving water&#8208;solubility of the diazaoxatriangulenium (DAOTA  +  ) chromophore: hydrophilic counter ions, aromatic sulfonation of the chromophore, and attachment of charged side chains. The long fluorescence lifetime (FLT, &#964;  f  = 20 ns) of DAOTA  +  makes it a sensitive probe to analyze solvation and aggregation effects. Direct sulfonation of the chromophore was found to increase solubility drastically, but at the cost of greatly reduced quantum yields (QYs) due to enhanced non&#8208;radiative deactivation processes. The introduction of either cationic (4) or zwitterionic side chains (5), however, brings the FLT (&#964;  f  = 18 ns) and QY (&#966;  f  = 0.56) of the dye to the same level as the parent chromophore in acetonitrile. Time&#8208;resolved fluorescence spectroscopy also reveals a high resistance to aggregation and non&#8208;specific binding in a high loading of bovine serum albumin (BSA). The results clearly show that addition of charged flexible side chains is preferable to direct sulfonation of the chromophore core.</dc:description>

      <title>Assembly of a Ternary Metallopeptide Complex at Specific DNA Sites Mediated by an AT&#8208;Hook Adaptor</title>
      <dc:description>
The selective recognition of specific DNA sequences is demonstrated by a supramolecular peptide assembly involving three peptide units. Metal coordination plays a dual role, bringing together the peptides as well as nucleating the DNA&#8208;binding &#945;&#8208;helices.







Abstract
The nickel(II)&#8208;mediated self&#8208;assembly of a multimeric DNA binder is described. The binder is composed of two metal&#8208;chelating peptides derived from a bZIP transcription factor (brHis2) and one short AT&#8208;hook domain equipped with two bipyridine ligands (HkBpy2). These peptides reversibly assemble in the presence of NiII ions at selected DNA sequences of 13 base pairs.

      <title>Aggregation&#8208;Induced Synergism by Hydrophobic&#8208;Driven Self&#8208;Assembly of Amphiphilic Oligonucleotides</title>
      <dc:description>
Supersensitive! Herein, an efficient aggregation&#8208;induced synergism through the hydrophobic&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly of amphiphilic oligonucleotides to generate high local concentration whereas retaining high reaction efficiency through hydrophobic&#8208;based aggregation is proposed, which is important for constructing efficient DNA nanomachines for ultrasensitive bioanalysis and clinical diagnosis.







Abstract
The evident contradiction between high local&#8208;concentration&#8208;based substrate reactivity and free&#8208;diffusion&#8208;based high reaction efficiency remains one of the important challenges in chemistry. Herein, we propose an efficient aggregation&#8208;induced synergism through the hydrophobic&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly of amphiphilic oligonucleotides to generate high local concentration whereas retaining high reaction efficiency through hydrophobic&#8208;based aggregation, which is important for constructing efficient DNA nanomachines for ultrasensitive applications. MicroRNA&#8208;155, used as a model, triggered strand displacement amplification of the DNA monomers on the periphery of the 3D DNA nanomachine and generated an amplified fluorescent response for its sensitive assay. The local concentration of substrates was increased by a factor of at least 9.0&#215;105 through hydrophobic&#8208;interaction&#8208;based self&#8208;assembly in comparison with the traditional homogeneous reaction system, achieving high local&#8208;concentration&#8208;based reactivity and free&#8208;diffusion&#8208;based enhanced reaction efficiency. As expected, the aggregation&#8208;induced synergism by hydrophobic&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly of amphiphilic oligonucleotides created excellent properties to generate a 3D DNA nanomachine with potential as an assay for microRNA&#8208;155 in cells. Most importantly, this approach can be easily expanded for the bioassay of various biomarkers, such as nucleotides, proteins, and cells, offering a new avenue for simple and efficient applications in bioanalysis and clinical diagnosis.

Herein, an efficient aggregation&#8208;induced synergism through the hydrophobic&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly of amphiphilic oligonucleotides to generate high local concentration whereas retaining high reaction efficiency through hydrophobic&#8208;based aggregation is proposed, which is important for constructing efficient DNA nanomachines for ultrasensitive bioanalysis and clinical diagnosis.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The evident contradiction between high local&#8208;concentration&#8208;based substrate reactivity and free&#8208;diffusion&#8208;based high reaction efficiency remains one of the important challenges in chemistry. Herein, we propose an efficient aggregation&#8208;induced synergism through the hydrophobic&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly of amphiphilic oligonucleotides to generate high local concentration whereas retaining high reaction efficiency through hydrophobic&#8208;based aggregation, which is important for constructing efficient DNA nanomachines for ultrasensitive applications. MicroRNA&#8208;155, used as a model, triggered strand displacement amplification of the DNA monomers on the periphery of the 3D DNA nanomachine and generated an amplified fluorescent response for its sensitive assay. The local concentration of substrates was increased by a factor of at least 9.0&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; through hydrophobic&#8208;interaction&#8208;based self&#8208;assembly in comparison with the traditional homogeneous reaction system, achieving high local&#8208;concentration&#8208;based reactivity and free&#8208;diffusion&#8208;based enhanced reaction efficiency. As expected, the aggregation&#8208;induced synergism by hydrophobic&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly of amphiphilic oligonucleotides created excellent properties to generate a 3D DNA nanomachine with potential as an assay for microRNA&#8208;155 in cells. Most importantly, this approach can be easily expanded for the bioassay of various biomarkers, such as nucleotides, proteins, and cells, offering a new avenue for simple and efficient applications in bioanalysis and clinical diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Re&#8208;Evaluation of a Fulvene&#8208;Based Self&#8208;Replicating Diels&#8211;Alder Reaction System</title>
      <dc:description>
Analytical analysis: The previous claim of high diastereoselectivity for the endo isomers of a self&#8208;replicating Diels&#8211;Alder reaction has to be redrawn. We show that the claim is erroneous due to an incorrect assignment of NMR signals. We ask for a re&#8208;evaluation of computational studies that supported the claim (see figure).







Abstract
We re&#8208;evaluate our claim of a high diastereoselectivity in the self&#8208;relicating Diels&#8211;Alder reaction between maleimide 1 and fulvene 3. It was shown that the system has a diastereoselectivity of 1.8:1 for NN&#8208;4:NX&#8208;4, which is contrary to the 16:1 ratio claimed by Dieckmann et&#8197;al. The analysis of 1H&#8197;NMR monitoring of the reaction revealed that both replicators show sigmoidal growth which is typical for auto&#8208;catalytic systems.

Insulin is a fascinating small protein that is accessible to synthetic organic chemistry. It is amenable to a wide range of chemical reactions, such as acylations, reductive alkylations, reduction, and binding of different metal ions, which can modify it properties. Insulin is also a very important biopharmaceutical and chemically modified insulin derivatives have provided diabetes patients with new treatment options. The approaches to chemical modification of insulin described here may serve as an inspiration for chemistry on other proteins. Read more in the Review by K.&#8197;J.

      <title>Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura Cross&#8208;Coupling of Bromotryptophan Derivatives at Ambient Temperature</title>
      <dc:description>Mild reaction conditions are highly desirable for bio&#8208;orthogonal side chain derivatizations of amino acids, peptides or proteins due to the sensitivity of these substrates. Transition metal catalyzed cross&#8208;couplings such as Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura reactions are highly versatile, but usually require unfavourable reaction conditions, in particular, when applied with aryl bromides. Ligand&#8208;free solvent&#8208;stabilized Pd&#8208;nanoparticles represent an efficient and sustainable alternative to conventional phosphine&#8208;based catalysts, because the cross&#8208;coupling can be performed at considerably lower temperature. We report on the application of such a highly reactive heterogeneous catalyst for the Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling of brominated tryptophan derivatives. The solvent&#8208;stabilized Pd&#8208;nanoparticles are even more efficient than the literature&#8208;known ADHP&#8208;Pd precatalyst. Interestingly, the latter also leads to the formation of quasi&#8208;homogeneous Pd&#8208;nanoparticles as the catalytic species. One advantage of our approach is the compatibility with aqueous and aerobic conditions at near&#8208;ambient temperatures and short reaction times of only 2 hours. The influence of different N &#945; &#8208;protecting groups, boronic acids as well as the impact of different amino acid side chains in bromotryptophan&#8208;containing peptides has been studied.

      <title>Bioorthogonal Turn&#8208;On BODIPY&#8208;Peptide Photosensitizers for&#160;Tailored Photodynamic Therapy</title>
      <dc:description>Photodynamic therapy (PDT) leads to cancer remission viathe production of cytotoxic species under photosensitizer (PS)irradiation. However, concomitant damage and dark toxicity can bothhinder its use. With this in mind, we have implemented a versatilepeptide&#8208;based platform of bioorthogonally activatable BODIPYtetrazinePSs. Confocal microscopy and phototoxicity studiesdemonstrated that the incorporation of the PS, as a bifunctionalmodule, into a peptide enabled spatial and conditional control ofsinglet oxygen (1O2) generation. Comparing subcellular distribution,PS confined in the cytoplasmic membrane achieved the highesttoxicities (IC50 = 0.096 &#197;} 0.003 &#956;M) after activation and withoutapparent dark toxicity. Our tunable approach will inspire novel probestowards smart PDT.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Photodynamic therapy (PDT) leads to cancer remission viathe production of cytotoxic species under photosensitizer (PS)irradiation. However, concomitant damage and dark toxicity can bothhinder its use. With this in mind, we have implemented a versatilepeptide&#8208;based platform of bioorthogonally activatable BODIPYtetrazinePSs. Confocal microscopy and phototoxicity studiesdemonstrated that the incorporation of the PS, as a bifunctionalmodule, into a peptide enabled spatial and conditional control ofsinglet oxygen (1O2) generation. Comparing subcellular distribution,PS confined in the cytoplasmic membrane achieved the highesttoxicities (IC50 = 0.096 &#197;} 0.003 &#956;M) after activation and withoutapparent dark toxicity. Our tunable approach will inspire novel probestowards smart PDT.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Theoretical Study on Photoisomerization Mechanisms of Diphenyl Substituted N,C&#8208;chelate Organoboron Compounds</title>
      <dc:description>N, C&#8208;chelate organoboron compounds are widely employed as photo&#8208;responsive and optoelectronic materials due to their efficient photochromic reactivity. It was found in experiments that two diphenyl substituted organoboron compounds, B(ppy)Ph  2  (ppy=2&#8208;phenylpyridyl) and B(iba)Ph  2  (iba=N&#8208;isopropyl&#8208;benzylidene&#8208;amine), display distinct photochemical reactivity. B(ppy)Ph  2  is inert upon irradiation while B(iba)Ph  2  undergoes photo&#8208;induced transformations, yielding BN&#8208;cyclohepta&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triene via a borirane intermediate. In this work, the complete active space self&#8208;consistent field and its second&#8208;order perturbation (CASPT2//CASSCF) methods were used to investigate the photo&#8208;induced reaction mechanisms of B(ppy)Ph  2  and B(iba)Ph  2  . Our calculations showed that the two compounds isomerize to borirane in the same way bypassing a transition state in S  1  state and a conical intersection between S  1  state and S  0  state. The energy barriers in S  1  state are 0.54 eV and 0.26 eV for B(ppy)Ph  2  and B(iba)Ph  2  , which were explained by analyzing the charge distributions of minima in S  0  and S  1  states.

To evaluate the PT derivatives as chemosensors of the artificial tongue, qualitative and quantitative analyses were performed with four types of wine components (  i.e.  sweet, sour, bitter, and astringent tastes) in combination with pattern recognition models.

      <title>Steering Site&#8208;Selectivity in Transition Metal&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;H Bond Functionalization: the Challenge of Benzanilides</title>
      <dc:description>
Full control of the site&#8208;selectivity in C&#8722;H bond functionalization is as desirable as challenging in transition&#8208;metal catalysis. This is especially true for benzanilide derivatives, which are one of the most important building blocks in organic synthesis. The developments of these methodologies are discussed emphasizing the action mode that the transition metal&#8208;based catalysts display in order to reach a given site&#8208;selectivity.







Abstract
Selective C&#8722;H bond functionalization catalyzed by metal complexes have completely revolutionized the way in which chemical synthesis is conceived nowadays. Typically, the reactivity of a transition metal catalyst is the key to control the site&#8208;, regio&#8208; and/or stereo&#8208;selectivity of a C&#8722;H bond functionalization. Of particular interests are molecules that contain multiple C&#8722;H bonds prone to undergo C&#8722;H bond activations with very similar bond dissociation energies at different positions. This is the case of benzanilides, relevant chemical motifs that are found in many useful fine chemicals, in which two C&#8722;H sites are present in chemically different aromatic fragments. In the last years, it has been found that depending on the metal catalyst and the reaction conditions, the amide motif might behave as a directing group towards the metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H bond activation in the benzamide site or in the anilide site. The impact and the consequences of such subtle control of site&#8208;selectivity are herein reviewed with important applications in carbon&#8208;carbon and carbon&#8208;heteroatom bond forming processes. The mechanisms unraveling these unique transformations are discussed in order to provide a better understanding for future developments in the field of site&#8208;selective C&#8722;H bond functionalization with transition metal catalysts.

&lt;p&gt;Selective C&#8722;H bond functionalization catalyzed by metal complexes have completely revolutionized the way in which chemical synthesis is conceived nowadays. Typically, the reactivity of a transition metal catalyst is the key to control the site&#8208;, regio&#8208; and/or stereo&#8208;selectivity of a C&#8722;H bond functionalization. Of particular interests are molecules that contain multiple C&#8722;H bonds prone to undergo C&#8722;H bond activations with very similar bond dissociation energies at different positions. This is the case of benzanilides, relevant chemical motifs that are found in many useful fine chemicals, in which two C&#8722;H sites are present in chemically different aromatic fragments. In the last years, it has been found that depending on the metal catalyst and the reaction conditions, the amide motif might behave as a directing group towards the metal&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H bond activation in the benzamide site or in the anilide site. The impact and the consequences of such subtle control of site&#8208;selectivity are herein reviewed with important applications in carbon&#8208;carbon and carbon&#8208;heteroatom bond forming processes. The mechanisms unraveling these unique transformations are discussed in order to provide a better understanding for future developments in the field of site&#8208;selective C&#8722;H bond functionalization with transition metal catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Synthetic Chlorophyll Dimer Appending Fullerene: Effect of Chlorophyll Pairing on (Photo)redox Properties</title>
      <dc:description>
P700, consisting of a pair of chlorophylls a/a&#8217;, is known to act as the primary electron donor in the reaction center of Photosystem&#8197;I. The cover artwork highlights the molecular structure of a synthetic chlorophyll dimer possessing a fullerene moiety used in this work, which is reminiscent of a flying bird grabbing a football. Studying the intramolecular charge separation between fullerene and chlorophyll dimer made it possible to capture the features of the reaction center and discuss why nature utilizes the dimer motif as a part of charge&#8208;separation machinery. More information can be found in the Full Paper by H. Tamiaki et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202000614).

      <dc:description>
Thrust engines: Enzymes provide various artificial active structures with a thrust for their self&#8208;propulsion in different media. Current enzyme&#8208;powered micro&#8208; and nanomotors are considered progressive tools in targeted drug delivery, biosensing, and water remediation. Rapidly growing research in this field promises the advanced design of multifunctional superstructures created by self&#8208;assembling properly selected enzymes and support materials.







Abstract
Enzyme&#8208;powered micro&#8208; and nanomotors are tiny devices inspired by nature that utilize enzyme&#8208;triggered chemical conversion to release energy stored in the chemical bonds of a substrate (fuel) to actuate it into active motion. Compared with conventional chemical micro&#8208;/nanomotors, these devices are particularly attractive because they self&#8208;propel by utilizing biocompatible fuels, such as glucose, urea, glycerides, and peptides. They have been designed with functional material constituents to efficiently perform tasks related to active targeting, drug delivery and release, biosensing, water remediation, and environmental monitoring. Because only a small number of enzymes have been exploited as bioengines to date, a new generation of multifunctional, enzyme&#8208;powered nanorobots will emerge in the near future to selectively search for and utilize water contaminants or disease&#8208;related metabolites as fuels. This Minireview highlights recent progress in enzyme&#8208;powered micro&#8208; and nanomachines.

      <title>Effect of Site&#8208;specific O&#8208;Glycosylation on the Structural Behavior of NOTCH1 Receptor Extracellular EGF&#8208;like Domains 11 and 10</title>
      <dc:description>Human NOTCH1 receptor contains 36 epidermal growth factor (EGF)&#8208;like repeating domains, in which O&#8208;glycosylation status of EGF12 domain regulates the interaction with Notch ligands. Our interest is focused on the effect of specific O&#8208;glycosylation states on the structural behavior of EGF11 and EGF10, because they appeared to affect molecular mechanism in receptor&#8208;ligand interactions by inducing some conformational alterations in these domains and/or the regions connecting two domains. To understand the structural impact of various O&#8208;glycosylation patterns on the pivotal EGF&#8208;like repeats 10, 11, and 12, we performed chemical synthesis and NMR studies of site&#8208;specifically O&#8208;glycosylated EGF11 and EGF10. Our strategy enabled to synthesize four EGF11 and five EGF10 modules. The specific O&#8208;glycosylation states affected in vitro folding of EGF10 more than EGF11, while calcium ion had a larger effect on EGF11 folding. Comprehensive NMR studies shed light on the new type &#8220;sugar bridges&#8221; crosslinking Thr&#8208;O&#8208;GlcNAc in the consensus sequence C5&#8208;X&#8208;X&#8208;G&#8208;X&#8208;(T/S)&#8208;G&#8208;X&#8208;X&#8208;C6 and an amino acid in the hinge region between the domains, 445Thr&#8208;O&#8208;GlcNAc&#8208;&#8208;&#8208;IIe451 in domain 11 and 405Thr&#8208;O&#8208;GlcNAc&#8208;&#8208;&#8208;Gln411 in domain 10, respectively.</dc:description>

      <title>In situ growth of ultrafine Pt nanoparticles onto hierarchical Co3O4 nanosheet&#8208;assembled microflowers for efficient electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution</title>
      <dc:description>The development of Pt&#8208;based electrocatalysts with high Pt utilization efficiency toward the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is of great significance for the future sustainable hydrogen economy. For rational design of high&#8208;performance HER electrocatalyst, the simultaneous consideration of both thermodynamic and kinetic aspects remains greatly challenging. Herein, a simple template&#8208;derived strategy is demonstrated for the in&#8208;situ growth of ultrafine Pt nanoparticles onto Co3O4 nanosheet&#8208;assembled microflowers (abbreviated as Pt/Co3O4 microflowers hereafter) by using the pre&#8208;fabricated PtCo&#8208;based Hofmann coordination polymer as reactive templates. The elaborate preparation of such intriguing hierarchical architecture with well&#8208;dispersed tiny Pt nanoparticles, abundant metal/oxide heterointerfaces and open configuration endows the formed Pt/Co3O4 microflowers with high Pt utilization efficiency, rich active sites, lowered energy barrier for water dissociation and expedited reaction kinetics. Consequently, the Pt/Co3O4 microflowers exhibit superior HER activity with a relatively low overpotential of 34 mV to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm&#8208;2, small Tafel slope (34 mV dec&#8208;1) and outstanding electrochemical stability, representing an attractive electrocatalyst for practical water splitting. What&#8217;s more, our concept of in&#8208;situ construction of metal/oxide heterointerfaces may provide a new opportunity to design high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts for a variety of applications.</dc:description>

      <title>Symmetry Effects in Photoinduced Electron Transfer in Chlorin&#8208;Quinone Dyads: Adiabatic Suppression in the Marcus Inverted Region</title>
      <dc:description>In donor acceptor dyads undergoing photoinduced electron transfer (PET), a direction or pathway for electron movement is usually dictated by the redox properties and the separation distance between the donor and acceptor subunits, while the effect of symmetry is less recognized. We have designed and synthesized two isomeric donor&#8208;acceptor assemblies in which electronic coupling between donor and acceptor is switched on/off by the orbital symmetry control with the reorganization energy and charge transfer exothermicity being kept unchanged. Analysis of the optical absorption and luminescence spectra, supported by the DFT and TD&#8208;DFT calculations, showed that PET in these assemblies corresponds to the Marcus inverted region (MIR) and has larger rate for isomer with weaker electronic coupling. This surprising observation provides the first experimental evidence for theoretically predicted adiabatic suppression of PET in MIR.</dc:description>

      <title>Highlights on the binding of cobalta&#8208;bis&#8208;(dicarbollide) with glucose units</title>
      <dc:description>Metalla&#8208;bis&#8208;dicarbollides, such as the COSAN anion [Co(C 2  B 9  H 11  ) 2  ] &#8208;  , have attracted much attention in biology but there is a lack of understanding of their interactions with cell&#8208;components. For this purpose, we studied the interactions of COSAN with carbohydrate moieties that are ubiquitous in biological processes in bulk media and at interfaces. Octyl&#8208;glucopyranoside surfactant (C8G1) has been chosen as a sugar based model that self&#8208;assembles into micelles creating a glucose covered interface with water. COSAN was found to adsorb onto C8G1 micelles at low COSAN contents and to disrupt C8G1 micelles into mixed COSAN&#8208;C8G1 aggregates at high COSAN contents. COSAN interact mainly through (i) the hydrophobic effect with C8G1 monomers and (ii) the superchaotropic effect, i.e. with a thermodynamically favorable dehydration of the sugar moieties and of the COSAN, with sugars in a collective manner at the micellar surface and with linear&#8208;oligosaccharides with possible di&#8208;hydrogen bond formation.</dc:description>

      <title>Engineering Boron Hot Spots for the Site&#8208;Selective Installation of Iminoboronates on Peptide Chains</title>
      <dc:description>Boronic acids (BAs) are a promising bioconjugation function to design dynamic materials as they can establish reversible covalent bonds with oxygen/nitrogen nucleophiles that respond to different pH, ROS, carbohydrates and glutathione levels. However, the dynamic nature of these bonds also limits the control over the stability and site&#8208;selectivity of the bioconjugation, which ultimately leads to heterogeneous conjugates with poor stability under physiological conditions. Here we disclose a new strategy to install BAs on peptide chains. In this study, a &#8220;Boron Hot Spot&#8221; based on the 3&#8208;hydroxyquinolin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;one scaffold was developed and upon installation on a peptide N&#8208;terminal cysteine, enables the site&#8208;selective formation of iminoboronates with 2&#8208;formyl&#8208;phenyl boronic acids (Ka of 58128 &#177; 2 M&#8208;1). The reaction is selective in the presence of competing lysine &#949;&#8208;amino groups, and the resulting iminoboronates, displayed improved stability in buffers solutions and a cleavable profile in the presence of glutathione. Once developed, the methodology was used to prepare cleavable fluorescent conjugates with a laminin fragment, which enabled the validation of the 67LR receptor as a target to deliver cargo to cancer HT29 cells.</dc:description>

      <title>Carnoquinolines Target Copper Dyshomeostasis, Aberrant Protein&#8208;Protein Interactions, and Oxidative Stress</title>
      <dc:description>Metal dysregulation, oxidative stress, protein modification, and aggregation are factors strictly interrelated and associated with neurodegenerative pathologies. As such, all these aspects represent valid targets to counteract neurodegeneration and, therefore, the development of metal&#8208;binding compounds with other properties to combat multifactorial disorders is definitely on the rise. Here, we report the synthesis and in&#8208;depth analysis of the first hybrids of carnosine and 8&#8208;hydroxyquinoline, Carnoquinolines (CarHQs), that combine the properties of the dipeptide with those of 8&#8208;hydroxyquinoline. CarHQs and their copper complexes were characterized through several techniques such as ESI&#8208;MS, NMR, UV&#8208;vis, and CD spectroscopy. CarHQs can modulate self&#8208; and copper&#8208;induced amyloid&#8208;&#946; aggregation. These hybrids combine the antioxidant activity of their parent compounds. Therefore, they can simultaneously scavenge free radicals and reactive carbonyl species thanks to the phenolic group and imidazole ring. These results indicate that CarHQs are promising multifunctional candidates for neurodegenerative disorders and, they are worthy of further studies.</dc:description>

In 6PP and  7D  6PP, the Ag  I  ion can coordinate to the nucleobase via the endocyclic N1 nitrogen atom, i.e. via the Watson&#8208;Crick edge. In contrast, this nitrogen atom is not available in  1D  6PP and  1,7D  6PP, so that in  1D  6PP an Ag  I  coordination is only possible via the Hoogsteen edge (N7). Reference duplexes with either adenine:adenine mispairs or canonical adenine:thymine base pairs were used to investigate the impact of the pyrazolyl moiety on the Ag  I  &#8208;binding properties. To determine the thermal and structural duplex stabilities in the absence or presence of Ag  I  , all duplexes were examined by UV and circular dichroism spectroscopic studies. These investigations shed light on the question of whether N1&#8208; or N7&#8208;coordination is preferred in purine&#8208;based metal&#8208;mediated base pairs.</dc:description>

      <title>Ancillary Ligand Effects on Heteroleptic Ir(III) Dye in Dye&#8208;Sensitized Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction: Photoaccumulation of Charges on Arylated Bipyridine Ligand and Its Control on Catalytic Performance</title>
      <dc:description>Herein, we report the synthesis, and photochemical and &#8208;physical properties, as well as the catalytic performance, of a series of heteroleptic Ir(III) photosensitizers (IrPSs), [Ir(C^N)  2  (N^N  Aryl  )]  +  , possessing ancillary ligands that are varied with aryl&#8208;substituents on bipyridyl unit [C^N = (2&#8208;pyridyl)benzo[  b  ]thiophen&#8208;3&#8208;yl (btp); N^N  Aryl  = 4,4&#8242;&#8208;Y  2  &#8208;bpy (Y = &#8208;Ph or &#8208;PhSi(Ph)  3  ]. We found that the  &#960;  &#8210;extension of bipyridyl ligand by aryl&#8210;substitution put bipyridyl ligand in use as an electron relay unit that performed charge accumulation before delivering to the catalytic center, greatly improving the overall CO  2  &#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion activities. In a typical run, the aryl&#8210;substituted IrPS (  t  Bu  IrP&#8208;Ph  Si  )&#8208;sensitized homogeneous systems (IrPS + Re(I) catalyst) gave a turnover number of 1340 (&#934;  CO  = 24.2%) at the early stage of photolysis (&lt;5 h). This study demonstrates that the  &#960;  &#8210;character modulation on the ancillary bipyridyl ligand is critical for forthcoming catalytic performance.</dc:description>

      <title>Nanoparticulate Conjugated Microporous Polymer with Post&#8208;Modified Benzils for Enhanced Pseudocapacitor Performance</title>
      <dc:description>Conjugated microporous polymer (CMP)&#8208;based energy storage materials were developed for pseudocapacitors. Nanoparticulate CMP (N&#8208;CMP) with an average diameter of 41 &#177; 4 nm was prepared through kinetic growth control in the Sonogashira coupling of 1,3,5&#8208;triethynylbenzene with 1,4&#8208;diiodobzene. The N&#8208;CMP is rich in a diphenylacetylene moiety in its chemical structure. Through the FeCl3&#8208;catalyzed oxidation of diphenylacetylene moieties, N&#8208;CMP with benzil moieties (N&#8208;CMP&#8208;BZ) was prepared and showed enhanced electrochemical performance as an electrode material of pseudocapacitors, compared with CMP, CMP&#8208;BZ, and N&#8208;CMP&#8208;BZ. In model studies, the benzil was redox active and showed two&#8208;electron reduction behavior. The excellent electrochemical performance of N&#8208;CMP&#8208;BZ is attributable to the enhanced utilization of functional sites by a nanosize effect and the additional redox contribution of benzil moieties.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>To gain mechanistic insights, natural systems with biochemical relevance are inspiring for the creation of novel biomimetics with unique properties and functions. Despite progress in rational design and protein engineering, folding and intramolecular organization of individual components into supramolecular structures remains challenging and requires controlled methods.

The pre&#8208;organization of the&#160;b3&#8208;peptides leads these Janus molecule pairs into a hexameric arrangement and a defined rosette nanotube by stacking.

      <title>A Six&#8208;coordinate Silicon Dihydride Embedded in a Porphyrin: Enhanced Hydride&#8208;donor Properties and the Catalyst&#8208;free Hydrosilylation of CO2</title>
      <dc:description>The catalyst&#8208;free hydrosilylation of CO  2  under mild conditions remains limited.

Combining the hydrosilylation with subsequent transformation furnishes formic acid from CO  2  . Computational studies indicate that the hydride&#8208;donor properties of  1  are exceptionally high for a neutral silicon hydride, and that the direct hydride transfer from silicon to carbon is a pivotal step in the hydrosilylation of CO  2  with  1  .</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Charge&#8208;separated metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are a unique class of MOFs that can possess added properties originating from the exposed ionic species. We report a new charge&#8208;separated MOF, namely UNM&#8208;6, synthesized from a tetrahedral borate ligand and Co 2+ cation. UNM&#8208;6 crystalizes into the highly symmetric P&#8208;43n space group with four&#8208;fold interpenetration, despite the stoichiometric imbalance between the B and Co atoms, which also leads to loosely bound NO 3 &#8722; anions within the crystal structure. These NO 3 &#8722; ions can be quantitatively exchanged with various other anions, leading to Lewis acid (Co 2+ ) and Lewis base (anions) pairs within the pores and potentially cooperative catalytic activities. For example, UNM&#8208;6&#8208;Br, the MOF after anion exchange with Br &#8722; anions, displays high catalytic activity and stability in reactions of CO 2 chemical fixation into cyclic carbonates.</dc:description>

      <title>Long&#8208;range LMCT coupling in Eu(III) coordination polymers for an effective molecular luminescent thermometer</title>
      <dc:description>A design for an effective molecular luminescent thermometer based on long&#8208;range electronic coupling in lanthanide coordination polymers is proposed. The coordination polymers are composed of lanthanide ions Eu(III) and Gd(III), three anionic ligands (hexafluoroacetylacetonate), and a chrysene&#8208;based phosphine oxide bridges (6,12&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphoryl)chrysene). The zig&#8208;zag orientation of the single polymer chains induces the formation of packed coordination structures containing multiple sites for CH&#8208;F intermolecular interactions, resulting in thermal stability above 350 &#730;C. The electronic coupling is controlled by changing the concentration of the Gd(III) ion in the Eu(III)&#8208;Gd(III) polymer. The emission quantum yield and the maximum relative temperature sensitivity (  S  m  ) of emission lifetimes for the Eu(III)&#8208;Gd(III) polymer (Eu:Gd = 1:1,  &#934;  tot  = 52%,  S  m  = 3.73% K  &#8208;1  ) were higher than those for the pure Eu(III) coordination polymer (  &#934;  tot  = 36%,  S  m  = 2.70% K  &#8208;1  ), respectively. Enhanced temperature sensing properties are caused by control of long&#8208;range electronic coupling based on phosphine oxide with chrysene framework.</dc:description>

      <title>PESIN&#8208;Homodimers Combined with Multimodal Molecular Imaging Probes for Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and Optical Imaging (OI): Suited for Tracking of GRPR&#8208;Positive Malignant Tissue.</title>
      <dc:description>We describe multimodal imaging probes for gastrin&#8208;releasing peptide receptor (GRPR)&#8208;specific targeting suited for positron emission tomography and optical imaging (PET/OI), consisting of PESIN (PEG3&#8208;BBN7&#8208;14) dimers connected to multimodal imaging subunits. These multimodal agents comprise a fluorescent dye for OI and the chelator NODA&#8208;GA for PET radiometal isotope labeling. Special focus was put on the influence of the used dyes on the properties of the whole bioconjugates. For this, several compounds with different fluorescent dyes and non&#8208;dye carrying subunits were synthesized and investigated. As fluorescent dyes, Dansyl, NBD, derivatives of fluorescein, coumarin and rhodamine as well as three pyrilium&#8208;based dyes were employed. Considerable influence of the charge of the colored unit on hydrophilicity as well as in vitro target receptor binding was observed and classified. High radiochemical yields and purities were found during radiolabeling of the multimodal imaging subunits as well as their GRPR&#8208;specific bioconjugates with 68Ga. Examinations of the photophysical properties of both molecule species displayed no loss or alteration of fluorescence characteristics.</dc:description>

      <title>New reactivity patterns in 3H&#8208;phosphaallene chemistry [Aryl&#8208;P=C=C(H)&#8208;tBu] &#8211; hydroboration of the C=C bond, deprotonation and trimerisation</title>
      <dc:description>3H&#8208;Phosphaallenes, R&#8208;P=C=C(H)&#8208;R&#8217; (  3  ), are accessible in a multigram scale on a new and facile route and show a fascinating chemical reactivity. BH  3  (SMe  2  ) and  3a  (R = Mes*, R&#8217; =  t  Bu) afforded by hydroboration of the C=C bonds of two phosphaallene molecules an unprecedented borane (  7  ) with the B atom bound to two P=C double bonds. This compound represents a new FLP based on a B and two P atoms. The increased Lewis acidity of the B atom led to a different reaction course upon treatment of  3a  with H  2  B&#8208;C  6  F  5  (SMe  2  ). Hydroboration of a C=C bound of a first phosphaallene is followed in a typical FLP reaction by the coordination of a second phosphaallene molecule via B&#8208;C and P&#8208;B bond formation to yield a BP  2  C  2  heterocycle (  8  ). Its B&#8208;P bond is short and the B bound P atom has a planar surrounding. Treatment of  3a  with  t  BuLi resulted in deprotonation of the &#946;&#8208;C atom of the phosphaallene (  9  ). The Li atom is bound to the P atom as demonstrated by crystal structure determination, quantum chemical calculations and reactions with HCl, Cl&#8208;SiMe  3  or Cl&#8208;P  t  Bu  2  . The thermally unstable phosphaallene Ph&#8208;P=C=C(H)&#8208;  t  Bu gave a unique trimeric secondary product by P&#8208;P, P&#8208;C and C&#8208;C bond formation. It contains a P  2  C  4  heterocycle and was isolated as a W(CO)  4  complex with two P atoms coordinated to W (  15  ).</dc:description>

      <title>Hexayne Amphiphiles and Bolaamphiphiles</title>
      <dc:description>
Surfactants worth the sacrifice: Amphiphilic and bolaamphiphilic functional hexaynes were synthesized using the Egliton&#8211;Galbraith reaction and a sacrificial monomer. The novel carbon&#8208;rich surfactants form aggregates in water, monolayers on surfaces, and stabilize the liquid&#8211;liquid interface.







Abstract
Oligoynes with two or more conjugated carbon&#8211;carbon triple bonds are useful precursors for carbon&#8208;rich nanomaterials. However, their range of applications has so far been severely limited by the challenging syntheses, particularly in the case of oligoynes with functional groups. Here, we report a universal synthetic approach towards both symmetric and unsymmetric, functionalized hexaynes through the use of a modified Eglinton&#8211;Galbraith coupling and a sacrificial building block. We demonstrate the versatility of this approach by preparing hexaynes functionalized with phosphonic acid, carboxylic acid, ammonium, or thiol head groups, which serve as neutral, cationogenic, or anionogenic interfacially active groups. We show that these hexaynes are carbon&#8208;rich amphiphiles or bolaamphiphiles that self&#8208;assemble at liquid&#8211;liquid interfaces, on solid surfaces, as well as in aqueous media.

We show that these hexaynes are carbon&#8208;rich amphiphiles or bolaamphiphiles that self&#8208;assemble at liquid&#8211;liquid interfaces, on solid surfaces, as well as in aqueous media.&lt;/p&gt;

      <dc:description>The formation mechanism of ferrihydrite is the key to understand its treatment of pollutants in waste water and purification of surface water and groundwater. Although emerging evidence suggests that formation of the ferrihydrite occurs through the aggregation of prenucleation clusters, rather than classical atom&#8208;by&#8208;atom growth, its formation mechanism remains unclear.

Upon dissolution in a mixed solution of isopropanol and water, the lacunary &#946; &#8208;Keggin&#8208;Fe 13 cluster can transform into an &#945; &#8208;Keggin&#8208;Fe 13 cluster, distinctly demonstrating that the Keggin&#8208;Fe 13 cluster rotational isomerization can be realized through the vacant Keggin&#8208;Fe 13 cluster.</dc:description>

      <title>S&#8208;shaped para&#8208;Quinodimethane Embedded Double [6]Helicene and Its Charged Species Showing Open&#8208;shell Diradical Character</title>
      <dc:description>Helicenes and extended helical &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules have been widely studied, but most of the systems contain aromatic benzene or heterocyclic rings only, showing local aromatic character. Herein, we report a new S&#8208;shaped double [6]helicene molecule 1 which possesses two embedded para&#8208;quinodimethane (p&#8208;QDM) units. Due to the existence of proaromatic quinoidal substructure, the molecule exhibits unique open&#8208;shell diradical character. Its model compound, a C&#8208;shaped single [6]helicene 2 containing one p&#8208;QDM unit, was also synthesized and compared. Their ground&#8208;state structures and electronic properties were systematically studied by a combination of various experimental methods assisted by theoretical calculations. Compound 1 has a double helical structure in crystal, with the two terminal [6]helicene units bent to opposite directions (i.e., anti&#8208; form). However, an anti&#8208;/syn&#8208; isomerization process was observed on NMR time scale, with a moderate interconversion energy barrier. Compound 1 shows amphoteric redox behaviour. It also exhibits open&#8208;shell diradical character (y0 = 12.1%) and a small singlet&#8208;triplet gap. On the other hand, compound 2 displays typical closed&#8208;shell nature.&#160; The dication and dianion of 1 also show open&#8208;shell diradical character. The dianion of 2 and the tetranion of 1 exhibit similar electronic structures to their respective isoelectronic structures, the [6]helicene and a double [6]helicene. This work provides some insights into the design and synthesis of stable helical &#960;&#8208;systems with unique open&#8208;shell diradical character and magnetic activity.</dc:description>

      <title>Light Runs Across Iron Catalysts in Organic Transformations</title>
      <dc:description>Over the past decades, organometallic complexes with precious elements, such as ruthenium and iridium, were widely used as visible&#8208;light photoredox catalysts. Recently, more and more complexes based on earth&#8208;abundant and inexpensive elements have been used as sensitizers in photochemistry. Although the photoexcited state lifetimes of iron complexes are typically shorter than those of traditional photosensitizers, the utilization of iron catalysts in photochemistry has sprung up due to their abundance, low price, nontoxicity and novel properties, including exhibiting ligand to metal charge transfer states.

      <title>Polymer&#8208;assisted electrophoretic synthesis of N&#8208;doped graphene&#8208;polypyrrole demonstrating oxygen reduction reaction with excellent methanol crossover impact and durability</title>
      <dc:description>The design and synthesis of the metal&#8208;free catalysts having superior electrocatalytic activity, high durability, low cost and under mild conditions is extremely desirable but remains challenging. To address this problem, we report a polymer assisted electrochemical exfoliation technique of graphite in the presence of aqueous acidic medium. This simple, cost&#8208;effective and mass scale production approach could open a possibility for the synthesis of high&#8208;quality nitrogen doped graphene&#8208;polypyrrole (NG&#8208;PPy). The NG&#8208;PPy catalyst displays an improved half wave potential (E1/2 = 0.77 V) in alkaline medium than G&#8208;PPy (E1/2 = 0.66 V). Most importantly, this catalyst demonstrating excellent stability with high methanol tolerance, which is outperforming the commercial Pt/C catalyst and few other previously reported metal&#8208;free catalysts. The content of graphitic nitrogen atoms is the key factor for the enhancement of electrocatalytic activity towards oxygen reduction reactions (ORR). Interestingly, the NG&#8208;PPy catalyst is used as a cathode material in a zinc&#8722;air battery, which demonstrates a higher peak power density (59 mW cm&#8722;2) than G&#8208;PPy (36.6 mW cm&#8722;2), which is broadcasting the importance of the low&#8208;cost material synthesis approach towards the development of metal&#8208;free efficient ORR catalysts for fuel cell and metal air battery applications. Remarkably, the polymer assisted electrophoretic exfoliation of graphite with high yield (~88 wt %) of few layers of graphene flakes could pave the path towards mass production of high&#8208;quality graphene for a variety of applications</dc:description>

Interestingly, the NG&#8208;PPy catalyst is used as a cathode material in a zinc&#8722;air battery, which demonstrates a higher peak power density (59 mW cm&#8722;2) than G&#8208;PPy (36.6 mW cm&#8722;2), which is broadcasting the importance of the low&#8208;cost material synthesis approach towards the development of metal&#8208;free efficient ORR catalysts for fuel cell and metal air battery applications. Remarkably, the polymer assisted electrophoretic exfoliation of graphite with high yield (~88 wt %) of few layers of graphene flakes could pave the path towards mass production of high&#8208;quality graphene for a variety of applications&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <dc:description>Constructing potential electrode materials with a wide temperature property for high energy density second batteries has attracted huge interests in recent years. Herein, a hybrid electrode, consisting of nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon/&#945;&#8208;MnS/flake graphite composite (&#945;&#8208;MnS@N&#8208;C/FG), was prepared via a post&#8208;sulfurization route.

As&#8208;obtained &#945;&#8208;MnS@N&#8208;C/FG shows excellent lithium/sodium storage performance, with a specific capacity of 712 mAh g&#8208;1 in the 700th cycle at 1.0 A g&#8208;1 or 186.4 mAh g&#8208;1 in the 100th cycle at 100 mA g&#8208;1 using lithium or sodium foil as the counter electrode, respectively.

This exceptional electrochemical response is endorsed to the synergetic effect of the smart design of a hybrid nanofoam structure, in which the FG skeleton and N&#8208;C coating layer can significantly enhance the conductivity of the whole electrode from bottom to up.

      <dc:description>The interest for ratiometric luminescent probes that detect and quantify a specific analyte is growing. Due to their special luminescence properties, lanthanide(III) cations offer attractive opportunities for the design of dual&#8208;color ratiometric probes.

Using a screening approach, anthracene was identified for the sensitization of the luminescence of two near infrared&#8208;emitting lanthanides, Yb3+ and Nd3+.

      <title>Azatruxene&#8208;Based, Dumbbell&#8208;Shaped, Donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;Bridge&#8208;Donor Hole&#8208;Transporting Materials for Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
      <dc:description>Three novel donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;bridge&#8208;donor (D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;D) hole&#8208;transporting materials (HTMs) featuring triazatruxene electron&#8208;donating units bridged by different 3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) &#960;&#8208;conjugated linkers have been synthesized, characterized, and implemented in mesoporous perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The opto&#8208;electronic properties of the new dumbbell&#8208;shaped derivatives (DTTXs) are highly influenced by the chemical structure of the EDOT&#8208;based linker. Red&#8208;shifted absorption and emission and a stronger donor ability were observed in passing from DTTX&#8208;1 to DTTX&#8208;2 due to the extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation. DTTX&#8208;3 featured an intramolecular charge transfer between the external triazatruxene units and the azomethine&#8208;EDOT central scaffold, resulting in a more pronounced red shift. The three new derivatives have been tested in combination with the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art triple&#8208;cation perovskite [(FAPbI3)0.87(MAPbBr3)0.13]0.92[CsPbI3]0.08 in standard mesoporous PSCs. Remarkable power conversion efficiencies of 17.48% and 18.30% were measured for DTTX&#8208;1 and DTTX&#8208;2, respectively, close to that measured for the benchmarking HTM spiro&#8208;OMeTAD (18.92%). PSCs with DTTX&#8208;3 reached a PCE value of 12.68%, which is attributed to the poorer film&#8208;formation in comparison to DTTX&#8208;1 and DTTX&#8208;2. These PCE values are in perfect agreement with the conductivity and hole mobility values determined for the new compounds and spiro&#8208;OMeTAD. Steady&#8208;state photoluminescence further confirm the potential of DTTX&#8208;1 and DTTX&#8208;2 for hole&#8208;transport applications as an alternative to spiro&#8208;OMeTAD.</dc:description>

Red&#8208;shifted absorption and emission and a stronger donor ability were observed in passing from DTTX&#8208;1 to DTTX&#8208;2 due to the extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation. DTTX&#8208;3 featured an intramolecular charge transfer between the external triazatruxene units and the azomethine&#8208;EDOT central scaffold, resulting in a more pronounced red shift. The three new derivatives have been tested in combination with the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art triple&#8208;cation perovskite [(FAPbI3)0.87(MAPbBr3)0.13]0.92[CsPbI3]0.08 in standard mesoporous PSCs. Remarkable power conversion efficiencies of 17.48% and 18.30% were measured for DTTX&#8208;1 and DTTX&#8208;2, respectively, close to that measured for the benchmarking HTM spiro&#8208;OMeTAD (18.92%). PSCs with DTTX&#8208;3 reached a PCE value of 12.68%, which is attributed to the poorer film&#8208;formation in comparison to DTTX&#8208;1 and DTTX&#8208;2. These PCE values are in perfect agreement with the conductivity and hole mobility values determined for the new compounds and spiro&#8208;OMeTAD. Steady&#8208;state photoluminescence further confirm the potential of DTTX&#8208;1 and DTTX&#8208;2 for hole&#8208;transport applications as an alternative to spiro&#8208;OMeTAD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Chemists around the world, take your part in the circular economy!</title>
      <dc:description>Based on recent examples and initiatives reported in the literature, this concept article discusses how chemistry can contribute to the circular economy approach in order to improve our current and future economical, societal and environmental system. Through five proposed levels of contribution, chemists can take a significant part in this global approach via the consideration of green chemistry principles, the simplification of syntheses, the limitation of complex products preparation, the efficient utilization of resources but also the novel ways of waste valorization. A more systematic and generalized environmental and economic assessment from the lab&#8208;scale is also recommended. At last, chemists have to work even more collaboratively and in a multidisciplinary way, within chemistry and beyond.</dc:description>

      <title>Mechanism of Iodine(III)&#8208;Promoted Oxidative Dearomatizing Hydroxylation of Phenols: Evidence for Radical&#8208;Chain Pathway</title>
      <dc:description>The oxidative dearomatization of phenols with the addition of nucleophiles to the aromatic ring induced by hypervalent iodine(III) reagents and catalysts has emerged as a highly useful synthetic approach. However, experimental mechanistic studies of this important process have been extremely scarce. In this report, we describe systematic investigations of the dearomatizing hydroxylation of phenols using an array of experimental techniques. Kinetics, EPR spectroscopy, and reactions with radical probes demonstrate that the transformation proceeds via a radical&#8208;chain mechanism, with a phenoxyl radical being the key chain&#8208;carrying intermediate. Moreover, UV and NMR spectroscopy, high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry, and cyclic voltammetry show that before reacting with the phenoxyl radical, water molecule becomes activated by the interaction with the iodine(III) center, causing the  Umpolung  of this formally nucleophilic substrate. The radical&#8208;chain mechanism allows to rationalize all existing observations regarding the iodine(III)&#8208;promoted oxidative dearomatization of phenols.</dc:description>
