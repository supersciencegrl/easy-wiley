         <title>Selective and Stepwise Functionalization of the Pyridazine Scaffold by Using Thio&#8208;Substituted Pyridazine Building Blocks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We described a regioselective tri&#8208; and tetra&#8208;functionalization of the pyridazine scaffold using two readily available building blocks: 3&#8208;(butylthio)&#8208;6&#8208;chloropyridazine and 3,4&#8208;bis(methylthio)&#8208;6&#8208;chloropyridazine by performing selective metalations with TMPMgCl&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;LiCl and catalyst&#8208;tuned cross&#8208;coupling reactions with arylzinc halides. Several of the resulting pyridazines were converted into more elaborated N&#8208;heterocycles such as thieno[2,3&#8208;c]pyridazines and 1H&#8208;pyrazolo[3,4&#8208;c]pyridazines.

         <title>&#956;2&#8208;&#951;1:&#951;1&#8208;N2 Bridged Bimetallic Dinitrogen Complexes: Geometry of the First Excited State in Connection to N2 &#960;&#8208;Photoactivation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Geometry of the first excited S1 state has been obtained for the bimetallic end&#8208;on &#956;2&#8208;&#951;1:&#951;1&#8208;N2 bridging dinitrogen complexes that possess characteristic N&#8722;N &#960;* based LUMO (&#960;*&#8208;&#960;*&#8208;&#960;*) centered on their M&#8722;N&#8722;N&#8722;M core. The elongated N&#8722;N bond in the S1 state and thermodynamically feasible N&#8722;N protonation free energies hold great promise for N2 &#960;&#8208;photoactivation and protonation.







Abstract
Bimetallic end&#8208;on &#956;2&#8208;&#951;1:&#951;1&#8208;N2 bridging dinitrogen complexes have served as the platform for photochemical N2 activation, mainly for the N&#8722;N cleavage. However, the alternate N&#8722;N &#960;&#8208;photoactivation route has remained largely unexplored. This study strengthens the notion of weakening the N&#8722;N bond through the population of &#960;* orbital upon electronic excitation from the ground to the first excited state using four prototypical complexes based on Fe (1), Mo (2), and Ru (3,4). The complexes 1&#8211;4 possess characteristic N&#8722;N &#960;* based LUMO (&#960;*&#8208;&#960;*&#8208;&#960;*) centered on their M&#8722;N&#8722;N&#8722;M core, which was earlier postulated to play a central role in the N2 photoactivation. Vertical electronic excitation of the highest oscillator strength involves transitions to the N&#8722;N &#960;*&#8208;based acceptor orbital (&#960;*&#8208;&#960;*&#8208;&#960;*) in complexes 1&#8211;4. This induces geometry relaxation of the first excited metal&#8208;to&#8208;nitrogen (&#960;*) charge transfer (1MNCT) state leading to a &#8220;zigzag&#8221; M&#8722;N&#8722;N&#8722;M core in the equilibrium structure. Obtaining the equilibrium geometry in the first excited state with the full&#8208;sized complexes widens the scope of N&#8722;N &#960;&#8208;photoactivation with &#956;2&#8208;&#951;1:&#951;1&#8208;N2 bridging dinitrogen complexes. Promisingly, the elongated N&#8722;N bond and bent &#8736;MNN angle in the photoexcited S1 state of 1&#8211;4 resemble their radical&#8208; and di&#8208;anion forms, which lead toward thermodynamically feasible N&#8722;N protonation in the S1 excited state.

         <title>Synthesis and VCD Spectroscopic Characterization of a Series of Azacryptands from a Chiral Valine&#8208;Based Derivative of Tris(2&#8208;aminoethyl)amine (TREN)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We introduce three C3&#8208;symmetric azacryptands with chiral valine&#8208;based TREN headgroups. Their VCD spectroscopic characterization reveals that the computed lowest energy conformers of all three azacryptands are not favored in solution phase and that they prefer a collapsed conformation.







Abstract
Utilizing experimental and computational vibrational circular dichroism (VCD) spectroscopy, we explored the conformational preferences of a series of chiral C3&#8208;symmetric octaazacryptands with tris(2&#8208;aminoethyl)&#8208;amine head groups derived from valine. While the spectra of the smallest azacryptand with p&#8208;phenyl linkers and its elongated derivative with p&#8208;biphenyls linker were found to match well with the computed spectra, the computed conformational preferences of the m&#8208;biphenyl&#8208;based azacryptand did not seem to reflect the conformations dominating in chloroform solution. A detailed analysis revealed that structural changes resulting in a collapsed cage structure gave a notably better match with the experiment. It could subsequently be concluded from the VCD analysis, that the octaazacryptands prefer a collapsed structure, which is not predicted by density functional theory (DFT) calculations as the global minimum structures. These findings are expected to have consequences also for future studies on inclusion complexes of such azacryptands.

         <title>Tuning the optical properties through hydrogen bond&#8208;assisted H&#8208;aggregate formation: The ODIN case</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The current work focuses on the investigation of two functionalized naphthyridine derivatives, namely ODIN&#8208;EtPh and ODIN&#8208;But, to gain insights into the hydrogen bond&#8208;assisted H&#8208;aggregate formation and its impact on the optical properties of ODIN molecules. By employing a combination of X&#8208;ray and electron crystallography, Absorption and Emission spectroscopy, time resolved fluorescence and ultrafast pump&#8208;probe spectroscopy (visible and infrared) we unravel the correlation between the structure and light&#8208;matter response, with a particular emphasis on the influence of the polarity of the surrounding environment. Our experimental results and simulations confirm that in polar and good hydrogen&#8208;bond acceptor solvents (DMSO), the formation of dimers for ODIN derivatives is strongly inhibited. The presence of a phenyl group linked to the ureidic unit favors the folding of ODIN derivatives (forming an intramolecular hydrogen bond) leading to the stabilization of a charge&#8208;transfer excited state which almost completely quenches its fluorescence emission. In solvents with a poor aptitude for forming hydrogen bonds, the formation of dimers is favored which give rise to H aggregates, with a consequent considerable reduction in the fluorescence emission. The urea&#8208;bound phenyl group furtherly stabilize the dimers in chloroform.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogen Bonded Dimer of an Alcohol with the Derived Carboxylic Acid Triggering their Sorption by Nanoporous&#8208;crystalline PPO Films</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 55, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Poly(2,6&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;phenylene) oxide (PPO) films do not absorb benzyl alcohol (BAL) and benzoic acid (BA) separately from dilute aqueous solutions while exhibiting selective uptake of a BAL/BA equimolar compound, if BA is obtained by oxidizing BAL. Quantitative FTIR evaluations and structural information indicate uptake of a BAL/BA hydrogen&#8208;bonded dimer in PPO intrahelical crystalline channels.







Abstract
Films exhibiting nanoporous&#8208;crystalline (NC) phases of poly(2,6&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;phenylene) oxide (PPO), which are highly effective to absorb apolar organic guest molecules, are also able to absorb polar molecules (like alcohols and carboxylic acids) but only from concentrated organic solutions. NC PPO films, which do not absorb alcohols and carboxylic acids from diluted aqueous solutions, exhibits a huge uptake (even above 30&#8197;wt&#8201;%) of benzyl alcohol (BAL) and benzoic acid (BA), if BA is obtained by spontaneous room temperature oxidation of BAL in aqueous solution. This phenomenon is rationalized by an easy uptake, mainly by the PPO intrahelical crystalline empty channels, of a BAL/BA 1/1 hydrogen&#8208;bonded dimer. This huge uptake of BAL/BA dimer by NC PPO films, which is also fast for films exhibiting the orientation of the crystalline helices perpendicular to the film plane (c&#8869; orientation), can be exploited for purification of water from BAL, when present in traces. High and fast sorption of a hydrogen bonded dimer and negligible sorption of the two separate compounds is possibly unprecedented for absorbent materials.

         <title>Mechanistic Aspects of the Crabtree&#8208;Pfaltz Hydrogenation of Olefins &#8208; An Interplay of Experimentation and Quantum Chemical Computation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 55, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalytic hydrogenation of unfunctionalized, highly substituted olefins once was a difficult task that was solved by Crabtree with his iridium catalyst that was further improved by Pfaltz and others. Mechanistic aspects of this type of reactions have been elucidated by an interplay of experiment and quantum chemical calculations; nevertheless, open questions exist, which require further effort particularly by theoretical chemists.







Abstract
Introduction of Crabtree's iridium&#8208;based hydrogenation catalyst in 1977 marked a paradigm shift both with respect to the role of iridium in homogeneous catalysis as well as catalytic hydrogenation of olefins. In 1998, Pfaltz introduced an improved catalyst, by use of BARF&#8722; as anion, and established the first chiral variant of the Crabtree catalyst. This led to numerous practical highly enantioselective syntheses. Elucidation of mechanistic details posed great problems because of instability of the crucial intermediates. A remarkable breakthrough was achieved by Brandt, Andersson et&#8197;al. in 2003, based on dft calculations. These authors replaced a previously assumed IrI/IrIII catalytic cycle by a novel IrIII/IrV cycle. The proposal was experimentally verified by Pfaltz in 2014 and corroborated by advanced quantum chemical calculations. This essay is an attempt to describe a fascinating interplay of experiments and quantum chemical calculations for an important synthetic method.

         <title>Interaction Between the Transferrin Protein and Plutonium (and Thorium), What's New?</title>

Metalloprotein: With a toolbox of X&#8208;ray spectroscopy and molecular dynamics, this work sheds light on the binding interaction of plutonium and thorium (early actinides at oxidation state +IV) with iron transport transferrin protein and its tertiary structure.







Abstract
Transferrin (Tf) is a glycoprotein that transports iron from the serum to the various organs. Several studies have highlighted that Tf can interact with metals other than Fe(III), including actinides that are chemical and radiological toxics. We propose here to report on the behavior of Th(IV) and Pu(IV) in comparison with Fe(III) upon Tf complexation. We considered UV&#8208;Vis and IR data of the M2Tf complex (M=Fe, Th, Pu) and combined experimental EXAFS data with MD models. EXAFS data of the first M&#8722;O coordination sphere are consistent with the MD model considering 1 synergistic carbonate. Further EXAFS data analysis strongly suggests that contamination by Th/Pu colloids seems to occur upon Tf complexation, but it seems limited. SAXS data have also been recorded for all complexes and also after the addition of Deferoxamine&#8208;B (DFOB) in the medium. The Rg values are very close for apoTf, ThTf and PuTf, but slightly larger than for holoTf. Data suggest that the structure of the protein is more ellipsoidal than spherical, with a flattened oblate form. From this data, the following order of conformation size might be considered:holoTf&lt;M2Tf (M=Th, Pu)&lt;apoTf&lt;M2Tf&#8208;DFOB (M=Fe, Th, Pu).

         <title>Modified Peptide Molecules As Potential Modulators of Shelterin Protein Functions; TRF1</title>

In silico designed N&#8208;modified tripeptide PEP1 (yellow) imitating TIN2 peptide (green) can modulate interaction of TIN2 with TRF1 telomeric shelterin protein (gray) as shown in the figure and in consequence cause biological effects in cancer cells leading to senescence.







Abstract
In this work, we present studies on relatively new and still not well&#8208;explored potential anticancer targets which are shelterin proteins, in particular the TRF1 protein can be blocked by in silico designed &#8220;peptidomimetic&#8221; molecules. TRF1 interacts directly with the TIN2 protein, and this protein&#8208;protein interaction is crucial for the proper functioning of telomere, which could be blocked by our novel modified peptide molecules. Our chemotherapeutic approach is based on assumption that modulation of TRF1&#8208;TIN2 interaction may be more harmful for cancer cells as cancer telomeres are more fragile than in normal cells. We have shown in&#8197;vitro within SPR experiments that our modified peptide PEP1 molecule interacts with TRF1, presumably at the site originally occupied by the TIN2 protein. Disturbance of the shelterin complex by studied molecule may not in short term lead to cytotoxic effects, however blocking TRF1&#8208;TIN2 resulted in cellular senescence in cellular breast cancer lines used as a cancer model. Thus, our compounds appeared useful as starting model compounds for precise blockage of TRF proteins.

         <title>Highly Electrophilic Mononuclear Cationic Aluminium Alkoxide Complexes: Syntheses, Reactivity and Catalytic Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 55, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
New cationic aluminium complexes with terminal alkoxy substituents (&#8722;OMe and &#8722;OtBu) are reported; these showed markedly higher Lewis acidity than the known hydride and methyl analogues, as evident from their Gutmann&#8208;Beckett test, NBO analysis and hydride ion affinity calculations. These complexes activate triethylsilane and are good catalysts for the hydrosilylation of ethers, carbonyls, and alkene.







Abstract
Herein, we report the synthesis of &#946;&#8208;diketiminate&#8208;supported aluminium complexes bearing terminal alkoxide and mono&#8208;thiol functional groups: LAlOMe(Et) (2), LAlOtBu(Et) (3), and LAlSH(Et) (4), (L=[HC{C(Me)N&#8208;(2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3)}2]). Complexes 2 and 3 are further used as synthons to generate the fascinating cationic aluminium alkoxide complexes, [LAlOMe(&#956;&#8208;OMe)&#8208;Al(Et)L][EtB(C6F5)3] (5), [LAlOMe(OEt2)][EtB(C6F5)3] (6), and [LAlOtBu(OEt2)][EtB(C6F5)3] (8). These electrophilic cationic species are well characterized by spectroscopic and crystallographic techniques. The assessment of Lewis acidity by the Gutmann&#8208;Beckett method revealed superior Lewis acidity of the cations substituted with electron&#8208;demanding alkoxy groups in comparison to the known methyl analogue [LAlMe][B(C6F5)4]. This has been further endorsed by computational calculations to determine the NBO charges and hydride ion affinity for complexes 6 and 8. These complexes are also capable of activating triethylsilane in stoichiometric reactions. The applicability of these complexes has been realized in the hydrosilylation of ethers, carbonyls, and olefines. Additionally, the solid&#8208;state structure of a new THF stabilized aluminium halide cation [LAlCl(THF)][B(C6F5)4] (11) has also been reported.

         <title>Synthesis of Black Phosphorene Quantum Dots from Red Phosphorus
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 55, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Black phosphorene quantum dots can now be made at remarkably low cost in a simple two step process. Ball milling cheap abundant red phosphorus creates quantu dots trapped in bulk, which can then be freed by etching the surrounding amorphous phosphorus with lithium electride solution.







Abstract
Black phosphorene quantum dots (BPQDs) are most commonly derived from high&#8208;cost black phosphorus, while previous syntheses from the low&#8208;cost red phosphorus (Pred) allotrope are highly oxidised. Herein, we present an intrinsically scalable method to produce high quality BPQDs, by first ball&#8208;milling Pred to create nanocrystalline Pblack and subsequent reductive etching using lithium electride solvated in liquid ammonia. The resultant ~25&#8197;nm BPQDs are crystalline with low oxygen content, and spontaneously soluble as individualized monolayers in tertiary amide solvents, as directly imaged by liquid&#8208;phase transmission electron microscopy. This new method presents a scalable route to producing quantities of high quality BPQDs for academic and industrial applications.

         <title>5,10,15,20&#8208;Tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)porphyrin as a Functional Platform for Peptide Stapling and Multicyclisation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 55, October 2, 2023. </description>

We introduce 5,10,15,20&#8208;tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)porphyrin as a widely applicable scaffold for the stapling and multicyclisation of cysteine&#8208;containing peptides. A robust and peptide&#8208;compatible Nucleophilic Aromatic Substitution between aromatic fluorides and cysteine thiols was performed with a library of peptides, leading to different cyclic species &#8211; one of which was biologically tested &#8211; and offering relevant synthetic insights.







Abstract
Polyfluorinated aromatic reagents readily react with thiolates via nucleophilic aromatic substitution (SNAr) and provide excellent scaffolds for peptide cyclisation. Here we report a robust and versatile platform for peptide stapling and multicyclisation templated by 5,10,15,20&#8208;tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)porphyrin, opening the door to the next generation of functional scaffolds for 3D peptide architectures. We demonstrate that stapling and multicyclisation occurs with a range of non&#8208;protected peptides under peptide&#8208;compatible conditions, exhibiting chemoselectivity and wide&#8208;applicability. Peptides containing two cysteine residues are readily stapled, and the remaining perfluoroaryl groups permit the introduction of a second peptide in a modular fashion to access bicyclic peptides. Similarly, peptides with more than two cysteine residues can afford multicyclic products containing up to three peptide &#8216;loops&#8217;. Finally, we demonstrate that a porphyrin&#8208;templated stapled peptide containing the Skin Penetrating and Cell Entering (SPACE) peptide affords a skin cell penetrating conjugate with intrinsic fluorescence.

         <title>EPR Sensing of a Cation Species by Aza&#8208;Crown Ethers Incorporating a Persistent Nitroxidic Radical Unit</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 55, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis and the use of aza&#8208;crown ethers containing a stable nitroxide acting as selective sensor of inorganic and organic cations is described. The radical is deeply involved in the coordination complex generating peculiar EPR spectral pattern also depending on non&#8208;zero nuclear spin of the metal cation. The wheel was employed also in the preparation of a rotaxane structure.







Abstract
New nitroxides based on aza&#8208;crown ethers were prepared and employed as selective sensors for the detection of inorganic and organic cations by EPR analysis of the corresponding host&#8211;guest complexes. The nitroxide unit behaves as a sensitive probe for a number of alkali and alkaline earth metal cations affording EPR spectra differing in the value of nitrogen hyperfine constants and in the appearance of splitted signals due to the non&#8208;zero nuclear spin of some metal cation upon complexation. Owing to the remarkable EPR spectral differences between the host and the corresponding cation complex the new macrocycles are likely to act as multitasking tools to recognize several cationic species. EPR behaviour of the larger nitroxide azacrown 1&#8901; when acting as a wheel in a radical synthetic bistable [2]rotaxane containing both secondary dialkylammonium and 1,2&#8208;bis(pyridinium) molecular stations, was also investigated. Reversible movements of the macrocycle between the two recognition sites in the rotaxane were promptly revealed by EPR, which shows significant changes either in nitrogen coupling constant values (aN) or in the spectral shape in the two rotaxane co&#8208;conformations.

How COVID&#8208;19 damage DNA: Severe oxidative damage to various biomolecules in COVID&#8208;19&#8208;infected lungs has been reported. Our study shows that SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike protein fragments coordinate Cu(II) ions, forming three&#8208;nitrogen complexes in the lung environment. Using various methods, we demonstrated that these complexes generate ROS, leading to single&#8208; and double&#8208;strand DNA breaks.







Abstract
The COVID&#8208;19 pandemic has had a devastating impact on global health, highlighting the need to understand how the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 virus damages the lungs in order to develop effective treatments. Recent research has shown that patients with COVID&#8208;19 experience severe oxidative damage to various biomolecules. We propose that the overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 infection involves an interaction between copper ions and the virus&#8216;s spike protein. We tested two peptide fragments, Ac&#8208;ELDKYFKNH&#8208;NH2 (L1) and Ac&#8208;WSHPQFEK&#8208;NH2 (L2), derived from the spike protein of the Wuhan strain and the &#946; variant, respectively, and found that they bind Cu(II) ions and form a three&#8208;nitrogen complexes at lung pH. Our research demonstrates that these complexes trigger the overproduction of ROS, which can break both DNA strands and transform DNA into its linear form. Using A549&#8197;cells, we demonstrated that ROS overproduction occurs in the mitochondria, not in the cytoplasm. Our findings highlight the importance of the interaction between copper ions and the virus&#8216;s spike protein in the development of lung damage and may aid in the development of therapeutic procedures.

         <title>Antimalarial Agents Derived from Metal&#8208;Amodiaquine Complexes with Activity in Multiple Stages of the Plasmodium Life Cycle</title>

Metal conjugation has the potential to improve the speciation and cellular distribution of quinolines and subsequently broadening their spectrum of action as antimalarial drugs for multiple stages of the Plasmodium life cycle. Here, we provide an in&#8208;depth investigation of the chemistry and pharmacology of metal&#8208;quinoline complexes.







Abstract
Malaria is the one of the deadliest infectious diseases worldwide. Chemically, quinolines are excellent ligands for metal coordination and are deployed as drugs for malaria treatment. There is a growing body of evidence indicating that metal complexes can be conjugated with antimalarial quinolines to be used as chemical tools to overcome the disadvantages of quinolines, improving their bioactive speciation, cellular distribution, and subsequently broadening the spectrum of activity to multiple stages of the complex Plasmodium life cycle. In this study, four novel complexes of ruthenium(II)&#8208; and gold(I)&#8208;containing amodiaquine (AQ) were synthesized, and a careful chemical characterization revealed the precise coordination site of AQ to the metals. Their speciation in solution was investigated, demonstrating the stability of the quinoline&#8208;metal bond. RuII&#8208; and AuI&#8208;AQ complexes were demonstrated to be potent and efficacious in inhibiting parasite growth in multiple stages of the Plasmodium life cycle as assayed in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo. These properties could be attributed to the ability of the metal&#8208;AQ complexes to reproduce the suppression of heme detoxification induced by AQ, while also inhibiting other processes in the parasite life cycle; this can be attributed to the action of the metallic species. Altogether, these findings indicate that metal coordination with antimalarial quinolines is a potential chemical tool for drug design and discovery in malaria and other infectious diseases susceptible to quinoline treatment.

         <title>Straightforward Synthesis of Halopyridine Aldehydes via Diaminomethylation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 55, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pyridines featuring two or more halogen atoms react with silylformamidine via insertion into the most acidic C&#8722;H bond either at the &#947; or &#946;&#8208;positions affording the corresponding aminals. Their hydrolysis gave aldehydes. The reaction proceeds via H&#8208;abstraction from pyridines by the strong base&#8208;carbenic form of silylformamidine followed by formation of C&#8722;C bond between the formamidinium cation and the pyridine anion.







Abstract
A novel two&#8208;step method for formylation of fluoropyridines with silylformamidine Me3SiC(=NMe)NMe2 (1) under catalyst&#8208;free conditions was developed. A series of all possible 18&#8197;fluoropyridines featuring one to four fluorine atoms were subjected to the reaction with 1 existing in equilibrium with its carbenic form Me2NC(:)N(Me)SiMe3 (1&#8242;). Among them, 12&#8197;fluoropyridines were shown to react via C&#8722;H insertion. The reaction proceeded either at &#946;&#8208; or &#947;&#8208;positions affording the corresponding aminals. The more fluorine atoms in pyridines, the easier the reaction proceeded. We also hypothesized that the pyridines in which the fluorine was substituted by other halogens would react in a similar manner. To test the hypothesis, a set of 3,5&#8208;disubstituted pyridines with various combination of halogen atoms was prepared. 3,5&#8208;Difluoropyridine was taken as a compound for comparison. All the pyridines in the series also reacted likewise. In most cases, hydrolysis of the aminals afforded the corresponding aldehydes. As DFT calculations indicate, the reaction mechanism includes deprotonation of pyridine by 1&#8242; as a strong base and the following rearrangement of the formed tight ionic pair to the final product. An alternative reaction pathway involving addition of 1&#8242; to the pyridine carbon with the following hydrogen transfer via a three&#8208;membered transition state structure required much higher activation energy.

         <title>Robust Biosensor Based on Carbon Nanotubes/Protein Hybrid Electrolyte Gated Transistors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 55, October 2, 2023. </description>

A robust sensor: A robust methodology for the fabrication of electrolyte&#8208;gated transistor biosensors is presented. Single walled carbon nanotubes are hybridized with bovine serum albumin allowing the transistor fabrication from aqueous solution. The sensor functionality is demonstrated for the detection of cortisol in solution after immobilization of antibodies on the gate surface. Analysis of the signal allows the extraction of binding parameters.







Abstract
Semiconducting single walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) are promising materials for biosensing applications with electrolyte&#8208;gated transistors (EGT). However, to be employed in EGT devices, SWCNTs often require lengthy solution&#8208;processing fabrication techniques. Here, we introduce a simple solution&#8208;based method that allows fabricating EGT devices from stable dispersions of SWCNTs/bovine serum albumin (BSA) hybrids in water. The dispersion is then deposited on a substrate allowing the formation of a SWCNTs random network as the semiconducting channel. We demonstrate that this methodology allows the fabrication of EGT devices with electric performances that allow their use in biosensing applications. We demonstrate their application for the detection of cortisol in solution, upon gate electrode functionalization with anti&#8208;cortisol antibodies. This is a robust and cost&#8208;effective methodology that sets the ground for a SWCNT/BSA&#8208;based biosensing platform that allows overcoming many limitations of standard SWCNTs biosensor fabrications.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A robust sensor&lt;/b&gt;: A robust methodology for the fabrication of electrolyte-gated transistor biosensors is presented. Single walled carbon nanotubes are hybridized with bovine serum albumin allowing the transistor fabrication from aqueous solution. The sensor functionality is demonstrated for the detection of cortisol in solution after immobilization of antibodies on the gate surface. Analysis of the signal allows the extraction of binding parameters.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Semiconducting single walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) are promising materials for biosensing applications with electrolyte-gated transistors (EGT). However, to be employed in EGT devices, SWCNTs often require lengthy solution-processing fabrication techniques. Here, we introduce a simple solution-based method that allows fabricating EGT devices from stable dispersions of SWCNTs/bovine serum albumin (BSA) hybrids in water. The dispersion is then deposited on a substrate allowing the formation of a SWCNTs random network as the semiconducting channel. We demonstrate that this methodology allows the fabrication of EGT devices with electric performances that allow their use in biosensing applications. We demonstrate their application for the detection of cortisol in solution, upon gate electrode functionalization with anti-cortisol antibodies. This is a robust and cost-effective methodology that sets the ground for a SWCNT/BSA-based biosensing platform that allows overcoming many limitations of standard SWCNTs biosensor fabrications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Graphitic Carbon Nitride as Photocatalyst for the Direct Formylation of Anilines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 55, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new metal&#8208;free photocatalytic approach for the direct conversion of N,N&#8208;difunctionalized anilines into formamides derivatives (up to 89&#8201;% yield) under mild operative conditions is described herein. In this reaction, graphitic carbon nitride (g&#8208;CN) acts as a robust and fully recyclable visible&#8208;light photocatalyst that was easily recovered and reused up to five times without any significant drop in yield.







Abstract
The use of graphitic carbon nitride (g&#8208;CN) for the photocatalytic radical formylation of anilines, which represents a more sustainable and attractive alternative to the currently used approaches, is reported herein. Our operationally simple method occurs under mild conditions, employing air as an oxidant. In particular, the chemistry is driven by the ability of g&#8208;CN to reach an electronically excited state upon visible&#8208;light absorption, which has a suitable potential energy to trigger the formation of reactive &#945;&#8208;amino radical species from anilines. Mechanistic investigations also proved the key role of the g&#8208;CN to form reactive superoxide radicals from O2 via single electron transfer. Importantly, this photocatalytic transformation provides a variety of functionalized formamides (15 examples, up to 89&#8201;% yield).

         <title>The Structure of Maneb, An Important Manganese&#8208;Containing Bis(dithiocarbamate) Fungicide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 55, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular structure of Maneb determined: Over 70&#8197;years after patent publication, the mystery of the structure of the surprisingly stable manganese(II)&#8208;containing ethylene bis(dithiocarbamate) fungicide, which is extensively used in agriculture, has finally been solved.







Abstract
Maneb is a manganese(II)&#8208;containing fungicide with a multi&#8208;site effect and no resistance, therefore it is widely applied in many parts of the world. There is, however, mounting evidence for neurotoxic effects with Parkinson&#8208;like symptoms (manganism) related to usage of Maneb. Due to its insolubility in most solvents and its paramagnetism, structural elucidation is not trivial, and thus its exact molecular structure remains unknown. We report herein a synthesis procedure to prepare Maneb reproducibly in pure form and the use of various analytical techniques including X&#8208;ray diffraction, X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and electron diffraction to determine the molecular structure of Maneb in the solid state and also in solution.

         <title>Acid&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Amide Supramolecular Synthon for Tuning Amino Acid&#8208;Based Hydrogels&#8217; Properties</title>

The self&#8208;assembly of the well&#8208;known efficient gelator N&#8208;Fmoc&#8208;l&#8208;pentafluoro&#8208;phenylalanine, in the presence of a strong hydrogen bond&#8208;forming non&#8208;gelator, like benzamide, is driven by the same supramolecular interactions both in the crystal and hydrogel phase. This matching could open the way to a crystal engineering&#8208;based approach for the design of multicomponent amino acid hydrogels with tunable strength and properties.







Abstract
Supramolecular hydrogels formed by the self&#8208;assembly of N&#8208;Fmoc&#8208;l&#8208;phenylalanine derivatives are gaining relevance for several applications in the materials and biomedical fields. In the challenging attempt to predict or tune their properties, we selected Fmoc&#8208;pentafluorophenylalanine (1) as a model efficient gelator, and studied its self&#8208;assembly in the presence of benzamide (2), a non&#8208;gelator able to form strong hydrogen bonds with the amino acid carboxylic group. Equimolar mixtures of 1 and 2 in organic solvents afforded a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 co&#8208;crystal thanks to the formation of an acid&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;amide heterodimeric supramolecular synthon. The same synthon occurred in the transparent gels formed by mixing the two components in 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 ratio in aqueous media, as revealed by structural, spectroscopic, and thermal characterizations performed on both the co&#8208;crystal powder and the lyophilized hydrogel. These findings revealed the possibility of modulating the properties of amino acid&#8208;based hydrogels by involving the gelator in the formation of a co&#8208;crystal. Such a crystal engineering&#8208;based approach is shown also to be useful for the time&#8208;delayed release of suitable bioactive molecules, when involved as hydrogel coformers.

The straightforward, operationally simple, and regioselectivity of this methodology, complementing to the classical RuAAC catalyzed synthesis of 1,5&#8208;disubstituted 1,2,3&#8208;triazoles. In the presence of catalytic amount of Schreiner thiourea organocatalyst, organic azides react with a broad array of nitroolefins producing a series of diverse 1,5&#8208;disubstituted 1,2,3&#8208; triazoles in good yields with excellent regioselectivity.

         <title>Sheltering Mono&#8208;P&#8208;Ligated Metal Complexes in Porous Polystyrene Monolith: Effect of Aryl Pendant Stabilizers on Catalytic Durability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 55, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mono&#8208;ligated phosphine&#8208;metal complexes on porous polystyrene monoliths exhibited high catalytic durabilities by screening the electronic properties of aryl pendant groups. The quantitative analyses of interactions between aryl pendant groups and metal center revealed the importance of moderate stabilization for long&#8208;term catalysis in continuous&#8208;flow cross&#8208;couplings.







Abstract
Metal centers that can generate coordinatively unsaturated metals in accessible and stable states have been developed using synthetic polymers with sophisticated ligand and scaffold designs, which required synthetic efforts. Herein, we report a simple and direct strategy for producing polymer&#8208;supported phosphine&#8208;metal complexes, which stabilizes mono&#8208;P&#8208;ligated metals by modulating the electronic properties of the aryl pendant groups in the polymer platform. A three&#8208;fold vinylated PPh3 was copolymerized with a styrene derivative and a cross&#8208;linker to produce a porous polystyrene&#8208;phosphine hybrid monolith. Based on the Hammett substituent constants, the electronic properties of styrene derivatives were modulated and incorporated into the polystyrene backbone to stabilize the mono&#8208;P&#8208;ligated Pd complex via Pd&#8208;arene interactions. Through NMR, TEM, and comparative catalytic studies, the polystyrene&#8208;phosphine hybrid, which induces selective mono&#8208;P&#8208;ligation and moderate Pd&#8208;arene interactions, demonstrated high catalytic durability for the cross&#8208;coupling of chloroarenes under continuous&#8208;flow conditions.

         <title>Heterocyclic Merging of Stereochemically Diverse Chiral Piperazines and Morpholines with Indazoles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 55, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The present study accomplishes the heterocyclic merging of piperazines and morpholines with indazoles, successfully produced 20 distinct regio and stereochemically diverse indazolo&#8208;piperazine and indazolo&#8208;morpholine derivatives. This process could possibly be expanded to provide an efficient synthetic route that allows stereochemical and regiochemical variation in the assembly. We hypothesize that merging will afford compounds with biological activities that are unique from those of the simpler scaffolds that make up their merged structure.&gt;







Abstract
We report a heterocyclic merging approach to construct novel indazolo&#8208;piperazines and indazolo&#8208;morpholines. Starting from chiral diamines and amino alcohols, novel regiochemically (1,3 and 1,4) and stereochemically diverse (relative and absolute) cohorts of indazolo&#8208;piperazines and indazolo&#8208;morpholines were obtained within six or seven steps. The key transformations involved are a Smiles rearrangement to generate the indazole core structure and a late&#8208;stage Michael addition to build the piperazine and morpholine heterocycles. We further explored additional vector diversity by incorporating substitutions on the indazole aromatic ring, generating a total of 20 unique, enantiomerically pure heterocyclic scaffolds.

         <title>Highly Efficient Electrochemiluminescence from Imidazole&#8208;Based Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 55, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of imidazole&#8208;based thermally activated delayed fluorescent emitters have been synthesized and characterized. The electrochemiluminescence efficiency of such compounds is dictated by the presence of electrochemical reversible redox processes rather than by their photophysical properties in terms of photoluminescence quantum yields and excited&#8208;state lifetimes. Moreover, the imidazole moiety can be alkylated enabling the insertion of a derivatizable group.







Abstract
A family of novel thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters has been synthesized by a straightforward and metal&#8208;free synthesis, and structurally characterized. In this work we kept the acceptor moiety, 4&#8208;(1H&#8208;imidazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)benzonitrile, fixed and systemically tested different donors to correlate their photophysical and electrochemical properties with their performance in electrochemiluminescence using both benzoyl peroxide as co&#8208;reactant and co&#8208;reactant free (annihilation) conditions. Some compounds exceeded the efficiency of the standard [Ru(bpy)3]Cl2 by up to 28&#8197;times with benzoyl peroxide and 38&#8197;times in annihilation. Interestingly, we found that the efficiency is mainly dictated by the electrochemical reversibility of the redox processes rather than by the photophysical properties in terms of photoluminescence quantum yields or excited&#8208;state lifetime. In addition, the annihilation electrochemiluminescence efficiency strongly depends on the pulse sequence. The imidazole moiety can be conveniently alkylated, thus allowing the insertion of functional groups, such a carboxylic acid, and enabling practical applications.

Li8+xP3O10&#8722;xN1+x is a lithium oxonitridophosphate double salt synthesized from P3N5 and Li2O in ampoule synthesis. The structure consists of phosphate and diphosphate motifs and exhibits a severe disorder in the diphosphate unit. NMR and vibrational spectroscopy methods give additional information concerning the composition of oxygen and nitrogen. Li8+xP3O10&#8722;xN1+x is a Li+ ion conductor with a total ionic conductivity of 1.2&#215;10&#8722;7&#8197;S cm&#8722;1.







Abstract
The crystalline lithium oxonitridophosphate Li8+xP3O10&#8722;xN1+x, was obtained in an ampoule synthesis from P3N5 and Li2O. The compound crystallizes in the triclinic space group P
 with a=5.125(2), b=9.888(5), c=10.217(5) &#197;, &#945;=70.30(2), &#946;=76.65(2), &#947;=77.89(2)&#176;. Li8+xP3O10&#8722;xN1+x is a double salt, the structure of which contains distinctive complex anion species, namely non&#8208;condensed P(O,N)4 tetrahedra, and P(O,N)7 double tetrahedra connected by one N atom. Additionally, there is mixed occupation of O/N positions, which enables further anionic species by variation of O/N occupancies. To characterize these motifs in detail, complementary analytical methods were applied. The double tetrahedron exhibits significant disorder in single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Furthermore, the title compound is a Li+ ion conductor with a total ionic conductivity of 1.2&#215;10&#8722;7&#8197;S cm&#8722;1 at 25&#8201;&#176;C, and a corresponding total activation energy of 0.47(2) eV.

A membrane&#8208;free decoupled alkaline water electrolyzer was constructed using a graphite felt supported nickel&#8208;cobalt phosphate material as the tri&#8208;functional electrode, which significantly improves the flexibility of water splitting.







Abstract
Water electrolysis has been considered a promising technology for the conversion of renewables to hydrogen. However, preventing mixing of products (H2 and O2) and exploring cost&#8208;efficient electrolysis components remains challenging for conventional water electrolyzers. Herein, we designed a membrane&#8208;free decoupled water electrolysis system by using graphite felt supported nickel&#8208;cobalt phosphate (GF@NixCoy&#8208;P) material as a tri&#8208;functional (redox mediator, hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER)) electrode. The versatile GF@Ni1Co1&#8208;P electrode obtained by a one&#8208;step electrodeposition not only exhibits high specific capacity (176&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1) and long cycle life (80&#8201;% capacity retention after 3000 cycles) as a redox mediator, but also has relatively outstanding catalytic activities for HER and OER. The excellent properties of the GF@NixCoy&#8208;P electrode endow this decoupled system with more flexibility for H2 production by fluctuating renewable energies. This work provides guidance for multifunctional applications of transition metal compounds between energy storage and electrocatalysis.

         <title>In silico Investigation of the Thermochemistry and Photoactivity of Pyruvic Acid in an Aqueous Solution of NaCl</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 55, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ab&#8197;initio study of the hydrated and non&#8208;hydrated forms of pyruvate in NaCl aqueous solution emphasizes the influence of sodium on the chemical equilibrium of hydration and photoactivity of the anion.







Abstract
The photochemistry of oxocarboxylic acids contributes significantly to the complex chemistry occurring in the atmosphere. In this regard, pyruvic acid undergoes photoreactions that lead to many diverse products. The presence of sodium cation near pyruvic acid in an aqueous solution, or its conjugate base in non&#8208;acidic conditions, influences the hydration equilibrium and the photosensitivity to UV&#8208;visible light of the oxocarboxylic acid. We performed an ab&#8197;initio metadynamics simulation which serves two purposes: first, it unveils the mechanisms of the reversible hydration reaction between the keto and the diol forms, with a free&#8208;energy difference of only 2&#8197;kJ/mol at 300&#8197;K, which shows the influence of sodium on the keto/diol ratio; second, it provides solvent&#8208;shared ion pairing (SSIP) and contact ion pairing (CIP) structures, including Na+ coordinated to carbonyl, for the calculations of the electronic transition energies to an antibonding &#960;* orbital, which sheds light on the photoactivity of these two forms in the actinic region.

         <title>Regiocontrol via Electronics: Insights into a Ru&#8208;Catalyzed, Cu&#8208;Mediated Site&#8208;Selective Alkylation of Isoquinolones via a C&#8722;C Bond Activation of Cyclopropanols</title>

A Ru&#8208;catalyzed, Cu&#8208;mediated site&#8208;selective, C3/C4&#8208;alkylation of N&#8208;pyridylisoquinolones is achieved. The reaction pathway is characterized by open&#8208;shell singlet and triplet energy pathways arising from the bimetallic complex. Regioselectivity arises from the energies of the two states. While the electron&#8208;donating groups primarily afford the unprecedented C(4)&#8208;isomer, electron&#8208;withdrawing groups show an inclination towards the C(3)&#8208;product.







Abstract
A site&#8208;selective C(3)/C(4)&#8208;alkylation of N&#8208;pyridylisoquinolones is achieved by employing C&#8722;C bond activation of cyclopropanols under Ru(II)&#8208;catalyzed/Cu(II)&#8208;mediated conditions. The regioisomeric ratios of the products follow directly from the electronic nature of the cyclopropanols and isoquinolones used, with electron&#8208;withdrawing groups yielding predominantly the C(3)&#8208;alkylated products, whereas the electron&#8208;donating groups primarily generate the C(4)&#8208;alkylated isomers. Density functional theory calculations and detailed mechanistic investigations suggest the simultaneous existence of the singlet and triplet pathways for the C(3)&#8208; and C(4)&#8208;product formation. Further transformations of the products evolve the utility of the methodology thereby yielding scaffolds of synthetic relevance.

A new family of &#946;&#8208;diketiminate&#8208;stabilized highly electrophilic monomeric aluminium cations with alkoxy substituents have been introduced. The Guttman&#8211;Beckett method and hydride ion affinity calculations affirm that alkoxy groups enhance the electrophilicity of these cations. We also illustrate their catalytic application for reactions such as ether activation, hydrosilylation of alkene and carbonyls. More information can be found in the Research Article by S. Singh and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202301229). Manu Adhikari&#8216;s background image is gratefully acknowledged.

Meet to defeat: A strategic round&#8208;table meeting has been convened between inorganic chemistry and pharmacology to tackle malaria, one of the deadliest infectious diseases worldwide. As a result, metals have been deliberately conjugated with the antimalarial quinoline Amodiaquine. These metal&#8211;amodiaquine complexes have overcome the limitations of metal&#8208;free quinolines, and light has been shed on their potential as a chemical tool for designing new drugs against malaria and other infectious diseases susceptible to quinoline treatment.

The hydrogen&#8208;bond synthon between COOH and CONH2 drives the co&#8208;crystallization between N&#8208;Fmoc&#8208;pentafluorophenylalanine and benzamide. In water, the two molecules self&#8208;assemble to form a hydrogel with well&#8208;defined fibers having the same structure observed in the crystal state.

         <title>Emerging Electrocatalysts in Urea Production</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 55, October 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Urea synthesis via an electrocatalytic technique from CO2 and N&#8208;containing feedstocks is a clean and sustainable approach to replace the Haber&#8208;Meiser process, in which the rational design of highly efficient electrocatalysts is vital to improve the activity and selectivity of urea production.







Abstract
Urea synthesis from abundant CO2 and N&#8208;feedstocks via renewable electricity has attracted increasing interests, offering a promising alternative to the industrial&#8208;applied Haber&#8208;Meiser process. However, the studies toward electrochemical urea production remain scarce and appeal for more research. Herein, in this perspective, an up&#8208;to&#8208;date overview on the urea electrosynthesis is highlighted and summarized. Firstly, the reaction pathways of urea formation through various feedstocks are comprehensively discussed. Then, we focus on the strategies of materials design to improve C&#8722;N coupling efficiency by identifying the descriptor and understanding the reaction mechanism. Finally, the current challenges and disadvantages in this field are reviewed and some future development directions of electrocatalytic urea synthesis are also prospected. This Minireview aims to promote future investigations of the electrochemical urea synthesis.

         <title>Pinacol Cross&#8208;Coupling Promoted by an Aluminyl Anion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A simple sequential addition protocol for the reductive coupling of ketones and aldehydes by a potassium aluminyl grants access to unsymmetrical pinacolate derivatives. Isolation of an aluminium ketyl complex presents evidence for the accessibility of radical species. Product release from the aluminium centre was achieved using an iodosilane, forming the disilylated 1,2&#8208;diol and a neutral aluminium iodide, thereby demonstrating the steps required to generate a closed synthetic cycle for pinacol (cross) coupling at an aluminyl anion.</dc:description>

         <title>Reductive Coupling of a Diazoalkane Derivative Promoted by a Potassium Aluminyl and Elimination of Dinitrogen to Generate a Reactive Aluminium Ketimide</title>

         <dc:description>The reaction of 9&#8208;diazo&#8208;9H&#8208;fluorene (fluN2) with the potassium aluminyl K[Al(NON)] ([NON]2&#8211; = [O(SiMe2NDipp)2]2&#8211;, Dipp = 2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3) affords K[Al(NON)(&#954;N1,N3&#8208;{(fluN2)2})] (1). Structural
analysis shows a near planar 1,4&#8208;di(9H&#8208;fluoren&#8208;9ylidene)tetraazadiide ligand that chelates to the aluminium. The thermally induced elimination of dinitrogen from 1 affords the neutral aluminium ketimide complex, Al(NON)(N=flu)(THF) (2) and the 1,2di(9H&#8208;fluoren&#8208;9&#8208;yl)diazene dianion as the potassium salt, [K2(THF)3][fluN=Nflu] (3). The reaction of 2 with N,N'diisopropylcarbodiimide (iPrN=C=NiPr) affords the aluminium guanidinate complex, Al(NON){N(iPr)C(N=CMe2)N(CHflu)} (4), showing a rare example of reactivity at a metal ketimide ligand. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations have been used to examine the bonding in the newly formed [(fluN2)2]2&#8211; ligand in 1 and the ketimide bonding in 2. The mechanism leading to the formation of 4 has also been studied using this technique.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The functionalisation of carbon nanotubes has been instrumental in broadening its application field, allowing especially its use in biological studies. Although numerous covalent and non&#8208;covalent functionalisation methods have been described, the characterisation of the final materials has always been an added challenge. Among the various techniques available, Raman spectroscopy is one of the most widely used to determine the covalent functionalisation of these species. However, Raman spectroscopy is not a quantitative technique, and no studies are reported comparing its performance when the same number of functional groups are added but using completely different reactions. In this work, we have experimentally and theoretically studied the functionalisation of carbon nanotubes using two of the most commonly used reactions: 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition of azomethylene ylides and diazonium&#8208;based radical addition. The number of groups introduced onto the tubes by these reactions has been determined by different characterisation techniques. The results of this study support the idea that data obtained by Raman spectra are only helpful for comparing functionalisations produced using the same type of reaction. However, they should be carefully analysed when comparing functionalisations produced using different reaction types.</dc:description>

         <title>Antibactericidal Ir(III) and Ru(II) Complexes with Phosphine&#8208;Alkaloid Conjugate and Their Interactions with Biomolecules: A Case of N&#8208;Methylphenethylamine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The phosphine derived from natural alkaloid N&#8208;methylphenethylamine was used to synthesize half&#8208;sandwich iridium(III) and ruthenium(II) complexes. It turned out that they are selective towards Gram&#8208;positive bacteria, whereas the Ir(III) complex was more bactericidal. The potential action mode was proposed, based on the interactions with various biomolecules (ctDNA, plasmid DNA, 9&#8208;ethylguanine, and 9&#8208;methyladenine, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, glutathione, and ascorbic acid).







Abstract
The phosphine ligand (Ph2PCH2N(CH3)(CH2)2Ph, PNMPEA) obtained by the reaction of the (hydroxymethyl)diphenylphosphine with naturally occurring alkaloid N&#8208;methylphenethylamine, was used to synthesize the half&#8208;sandwich iridium(III) (Ir(&#951;5&#8208;Cp*)Cl2Ph2PCH2N(CH3)(CH2)2Ph, IrPNMPEA) and ruthenium(II) (Ru(&#951;6&#8208;p&#8208;cymene)Cl2Ph2PCH2N(CH3)(CH2)2Ph, RuPNMPEA) complexes. They were characterized using a vast array of methods, including 1D and 2D NMR, ESI(+)MS spectrometry, elemental analysis, cyclic voltammetry (CV), electron spectroscopy in the UV&#8208;Vis range (absorption, fluorescence) and density functional theory (DFT). The initial antimicrobial activity in&#8197;vitro toward Gram&#8208;positive and Gram&#8208;negative bacterial strains was examined, indicating that both complexes are selective towards Gram&#8208;positive bacteria, e.&#8201;g., Staphylococcus aureus, where the IrPNMPEA has been more bactericidal compared to RuPNMPEA. Additionally, the interactions of these compounds with various biomolecules, such as DNA (ctDNA, plasmid DNA, 9&#8208;ethylguanine (9&#8208;EtG), and 9&#8208;methyladenine (9&#8208;MeA)), nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH), glutathione (GSH), and ascorbic acid (Asc) were described. The results showed that both Ir(III) and Ru(II) complexes accelerate the oxidation process of NADH, GSH and Asc that appeared to occur by an electron transfer mechanism. Interestingly, only IrPNMPEA leads to the formation of various biomolecule adducts, which can explain its higher activity. Furthermore, RuPNMPEA and IrPNMPEA have been interacting with the DNA through weak noncovalent interactions.

         <title>Amino&#8208;Acid&#8208;Assisted Synthesis of Hollow Hierarchical FER Zeolite with Improved Catalytic Performance</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hollow hierarchical FER zeolite is synthesized through an amino&#8208;acid&#8208;assisted approach without the use of mesoporogens, and exhibits improved catalytic performance in the skeletal isomerization of 1&#8208;butene to isobutene.







Abstract
Hierarchical zeolites are highly&#8208;desired catalysts in the petrochemical industry due to their shorter diffusion length, faster diffusion rate, and better accessibility to active acid sites compared with conventional zeolites. Herein, we report a simple amino&#8208;acid&#8208;assisted method to synthesize urchin&#8208;like hollow hierarchical FER zeolites with abundant mesopores and macroporous inner cavities. An amino acid (i.&#8201;e. L&#8208;lysine) is used to facilitate the agglomeration of primary gel nanoparticles. The preferential nucleation and crystal growth at the external surfaces together with the lagged crystallization of the inner core of the agglomerates results in the formation of hollow inner cavities after the exhaustion of interior materials. Thanks to the unique hierarchical structure and more accessible acid sites, the hollow hierarchical FER zeolite exhibits improved catalytic performance over the conventional one in the skeletal isomerization of 1&#8208;butene to isobutene.

         <title>Chiral Dual Core Chromophores Based on Binaphthyl Acrylonitrile Motif with Tunable Dual Emission Bands and Anti&#8208;counterfeiting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The prepared chiral dual core chromophores based on binaphthyl acrylonitrile were shown to have the excellent dual state emissions and tunable dual wavelength emissions. A range of colors could be observed by solvatochromic and mechanochromic effects, and the anti&#8208;counterfeiting application with small color migration was also achieved.







Abstract
Small organic molecules which can emit fluorescence with tunable dual emission bands are significant for fundamental research and broad applications. In this work, two binaphthyl based arylacrylonitrile derivatives with pyrene and triphenylamine unit (BiNp&#8208;Py and BiNp&#8208;TPA) were designed and synthesized, respectively, featuring chiral backbone and dual AIE&#8208;active cyanostyrene&#8208;linked chromophores. Excellent fluorescence emissions in a range of solution and solid states were observed with high quantum yields, indicative of the solvatochromism and mechanochromism. More interestingly, dual emission bands were found and tunable by the water fraction in THF, and speculatively attributed to the balancing of intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) and locally excited (LE) emission in solution and aggregate states. Furthermore, the potential application in anti&#8208;counterfeiting ink was also explored, indicating the very low concentration (5&#8197;ppm) for sufficient distinguishable vision and small colour migration (28&#8197;nm) for printing on the filter. The present work provides a new strategy to design organic luminescent structure having widely fluorescent emissions in dual states and a valuable reference for the study of chiral optical materials.

         <title>Switchable Selectivity in the Annulation of o&#8208;Trifluoroacetylanilines and Activated Terminal Alkynes Based on Transition Metal and Phosphine Catalysis</title>

Based on Cu ang Ag catalysis as well as phosphine catalysis, we have developed efficient methods for the synthesis of three different types of CF3&#8208;substituted compounds (quinoline&#8208;3&#8208;carboxylates, quinoline&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylates, and indolines) from the same starting materials such as o&#8208;trifluoroacetylanilines and propiolates.







Abstract
In this work, we have developed selective methods for the synthesis of quinoline&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylates and quinoline&#8208;3&#8208;carboxylates as well as (indolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene)acetates through copper&#8208;, silver&#8208;, or phosphine&#8208;catalyzed reaction of propiolates with 2&#8242;&#8208;amino&#8208;2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroacetophenones. The approaches proposed ensure synthesis of substituted quinoline carboxylates and (indolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene)acetates in good yields. Introduction of alkynones into the reaction with 2&#8242;&#8208;amino&#8208;2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroacetophenones gives acyl substituted derivatives in good yields.

         <title>Post&#8208;Synthetic Nucleobase Modification of Oligodeoxynucleotides by Sonogashira Coupling and Influence of Alkynyl Modifications on the Duplex&#8208;Forming Ability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A post&#8208;synthetic nucleobase modification method for oligonucleotides via Sonogashira coupling is developed. This method enables efficient synthesis of various types of alkynyl&#8208;modified oligonucleotides and evaluation of the stability of the duplex formed by the synthesized alkynyl&#8208;modified oligonucleotides. Interestingly, alkynyl&#8208;modification on pyrimidine is less tolerated than on purine in duplex stability.







Abstract
Recently, it was reported that the alkynyl modification of nucleobases mitigates the toxicity of antisense oligonucleotides (ASO) while maintaining the efficacy. However, the general effect of alkynyl modifications on the duplex&#8208;forming ability of oligonucleotides (ONs) is unclear. In this study, post&#8208;synthetic nucleobase modification by Sonogashira coupling in aqueous medium was carried out to efficiently evaluate the physiological properties of various ONs with alkynyl&#8208;modified nucleobases. Although several undesired reactions, including nucleobase cyclization, were observed, various types of alkynyl&#8208;modified ONs were successfully obtained via Sonogashira coupling of ONs containing iodinated nucleobases. Evaluation of the stability of the duplex formed by the synthesized alkynyl&#8208;modified ONs showed that the alkynyl modification of pyrimidine was less tolerated than that of purine, although both the modifications occurred in the major groove of the duplex. These results can be attributed to the bond angle of the alkyne on the pyrimidine and the close proximity of the alkynyl substituents to the phosphodiester backbone. The synthetic method developed in this study may contribute to the screening of the optimal chemical modification of ASO because various alkynyl&#8208;modified ONs that are effective in reducing the toxicity of ASO can be easily synthesized by this method.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A post-synthetic nucleobase modification&lt;/b&gt; method for oligonucleotides via Sonogashira coupling is developed. This method enables efficient synthesis of various types of alkynyl-modified oligonucleotides and evaluation of the stability of the duplex formed by the synthesized alkynyl-modified oligonucleotides. Interestingly, alkynyl-modification on pyrimidine is less tolerated than on purine in duplex stability.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, it was reported that the alkynyl modification of nucleobases mitigates the toxicity of antisense oligonucleotides (ASO) while maintaining the efficacy. However, the general effect of alkynyl modifications on the duplex-forming ability of oligonucleotides (ONs) is unclear. In this study, post-synthetic nucleobase modification by Sonogashira coupling in aqueous medium was carried out to efficiently evaluate the physiological properties of various ONs with alkynyl-modified nucleobases. Although several undesired reactions, including nucleobase cyclization, were observed, various types of alkynyl-modified ONs were successfully obtained via Sonogashira coupling of ONs containing iodinated nucleobases. Evaluation of the stability of the duplex formed by the synthesized alkynyl-modified ONs showed that the alkynyl modification of pyrimidine was less tolerated than that of purine, although both the modifications occurred in the major groove of the duplex. These results can be attributed to the bond angle of the alkyne on the pyrimidine and the close proximity of the alkynyl substituents to the phosphodiester backbone. The synthetic method developed in this study may contribute to the screening of the optimal chemical modification of ASO because various alkynyl-modified ONs that are effective in reducing the toxicity of ASO can be easily synthesized by this method.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mechanistic Characterisation of Collinodiene Synthase, a Diterpene Synthase from Streptomyces collinus</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two homologs of the diterpene synthase CotB2 for cyclooctat&#8208;9&#8208;en&#8208;7&#8208;ol from Streptomyces collinus and S. iakyrus were investigated. The enzyme from S. collinus produces the new compound collinodiene besides cyclooctat&#8208;9&#8208;en&#8208;7&#8208;ol and other side products. Isotopic labelling experiments were performed to enlighten the cyclisation mechanism.







Abstract
Two homologs of the diterpene synthase CotB2 from Streptomyces collinus (ScCotB2) and Streptomyces iakyrus (SiCotB2) were investigated for their products by in&#8197;vitro incubations of the recombinant enzymes with geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate, followed by compound isolation and structure elucidation by NMR. ScCotB2 produced the new compound collinodiene, besides the canonical CotB2 product cyclooctat&#8208;9&#8208;en&#8208;7&#8208;ol, dolabella&#8208;3,7,18&#8208;triene and dolabella&#8208;3,7,12&#8208;triene, while SiCotB2 gave mainly cyclooctat&#8208;9&#8208;en&#8208;7&#8208;ol and only traces of dolabella&#8208;3,7,18&#8208;triene. The cyclisation mechanism towards the ScCotB2 products and their absolute configurations were investigated through isotopic labelling experiments.

         <title>Double&#8208;Walled Covalent Organic Frameworks with High Stability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two covalent organic frameworks with double&#8208;walled linkages were successfully synthesized and exhibited excellent stability when treated with boiling water and basic solutions. Moreover, these double&#8208;walled COFs exhibited remarkable IAST selectivity for favored adsorption of CO2 over N2.







Abstract
Double&#8208;walled covalent organic frameworks, consisting of two same building blocks parallel to each other forming ladder&#8208;shape linkers, could enhance the stability of the frameworks and increase the density of functional sites, thus making them suitable for various applications. In this study, two double&#8208;walled covalent organic frameworks, namely DW&#8208;COF&#8208;1 and DW&#8208;COF&#8208;2, were successfully synthesized via imine condensation. The resulting DW&#8208;COFs exhibited a honeycomb topology, high crystallinity and stability. Particularly, DW&#8208;COF&#8208;2 showed excellent resistance toward boiling water, strong acid, and strong base, due to its double&#8208;walled structure, which limits the exposure of labile imine bonds to external chemical environments. The DW&#8208;COFs showed high porosity near 900&#8197;m2/g, making them suitable for gas storage/separation. The selective gas adsorption experiments showed that at 273&#8197;K and 1&#8197;atm pressure, DW&#8208;COF&#8208;1 and DW&#8208;COF&#8208;2 exhibited a good IAST selectivity towards CO2/N2 (15/85) adsorption, with selectivity values of 121.3 and 56.4 for CO2 over N2, respectively.

         <title>Improved Triplex&#8208;Forming Isoorotamide PNA Nucleobases for A&#8722;U Recognition of RNA Duplexes
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Four isoorotamide nucleobases (Io5&#8722;Io8) are reported for incorporation into peptide nucleic acids aimed at RNA triple&#8208;helix formation. These extended nucleobases require only two hydrogen bonds across the Hoogsteen face of the A&#8722;U base pair for strong and selective binding, unlike previously reported extended nucleobases. Molecular dynamics simulations provide further insight into triple helical binding affinity and selectivity.







Abstract
Four new isoorotamide (Io)&#8208;containing PNA nucleobases have been designed for A&#8722;U recognition of double helical RNA. New PNA monomers were prepared efficiently and incorporated into PNA nonamers for binding A&#8722;U in a PNA:RNA2 triplex. Isothermal titration calorimetry and UV thermal melting experiments revealed slightly improved binding affinity for singly modified PNA compared to known A&#8208;binding nucleobases. Molecular dynamics simulations provided further insights into binding of Io bases in the triple helix. Together, the data revealed interesting insights into binding modes including the notion that three Hoogsteen hydrogen bonds are unnecessary for strong selective binding of an extended nucleobase. Cationic monomer Io8 additionally gave the highest affinity observed for an A&#8208;binding nucleobase to date. These results will help inform future nucleobase design toward the goal of recognizing any sequence of double helical RNA.

         <title>Structural Variations in Carboxylated Bispidine Ligands: Influence of Positional Isomerism and Rigidity on the Conformation, Stability, Inertness and Relaxivity of their Mn2+ Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mn(II) complexes with acetate&#8208;substituted bispidine ligands can adopt different conformations depending on the N3 substituent. Complexes in chair&#8208;chair conformation display high relaxivity and strong kinetic inertness, both very important for their potential use as MRI contrast agents. In contrast, the boat&#8208;chair conformers undergo fast dissociation and do no retain good relaxivity.







Abstract
Mn2+ complexes of 2,4&#8208;pyridyl&#8208;disubstituted bispidine ligands have emerged as more biocompatible alternatives to Gd3+&#8208;based MRI probes. They display relaxivities comparable to that of commercial contrast agents and high kinetic inertness, unprecedented for Mn2+ complexes. The chemical structure, in particular the substituents on the two macrocyclic nitrogens N3 and N7, are decisive for the conformation of the Mn2+ complexes, and this will in turn determine their thermodynamic, kinetic and relaxation properties. We describe the synthesis of four ligands with acetate substituents in positions N3, N7 or both. We evidence that the bispidine conformation is dependent on N3 substitution, with direct impact on the thermodynamic stability, kinetic inertness, hydration state and relaxivity of the Mn2+ complexes. These results unambiguously show that (i) solely a chair&#8208;chair conformation allows for favorable inertness and relaxivity, and (ii) in this family such chair&#8208;chair conformation is accessible only for ligands without N3&#8208;appended carboxylates.

         <title>Redox Activity of IrIII Complexes with Multidentate Ligands Based on Dipyrido&#8208;Annulated N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes: Access to High Valent and High Spin State with Carbon Donors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tetradentate carbon&#8208;based ligand allowed isolation and characterization of a formally +V tricationic iridium complex with a triplet ground state. Being both &#963; and &#960; donating, the figure &#8220;8&#8221; bis(dpaAr2&#8208;NHC) ligand are redox active, stabilizing the triplet state through one &#960;&#8208;conjugated framework. The similar electronegativities between Ir and C atoms allows a highly effective metal&#8208;ligand conjugation.







Abstract
Synthetic strategies to access high&#8208;valent iridium complexes usually require use of &#960; donating ligands bearing electronegative atoms (e.&#8201;g. amide or oxide) or &#963; donating electropositive atoms (e.&#8201;g. boryl or hydride). Besides the &#951;5&#8208;(methyl)cyclopentadienyl derivatives, high&#8208;valent &#951;1 carbon&#8208;ligated iridium complexes are challenging to synthesize. To meet this challenge, this work reports the oxidation behavior of an all&#8208;carbon&#8208;ligated anionic bis(CCC&#8208;pincer) IrIII complex. Being both &#963; and &#960; donating, the diaryl dipyrido&#8208;annulated N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (dpa&#8208;NHC) IrIII complex allowed a stepwise 4e&#8722; oxidation sequence. The first 2e&#8722; oxidation led to an oxidative coupling of two adjacent aryl groups, resulting in formation of a cationic chiral IrIII complex bearing a CCCC&#8208;tetradentate ligand. A further 2e&#8722; oxidation allowed isolation of a high&#8208;valent tricationic complex with a triplet ground state. These results close a synthetic gap for carbon&#8208;ligated iridium complexes and demonstrate the electronic tuning potential of organic &#960; ligands for unusual electronic properties.

         <title>Thermally Activated Geometrical Regioselective E&#8594;Z Isomerization&#8208;Enabled Cascade Sequences of Conjugated Dienals: Experimental and DFT Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermal isomerization&#8208;enabled cascade: Conjugated dienals undergo regioselective 2E,4E&#8594;2Z,4E alkene isomerization in a mixture of toluene&#8208;alcohol (2&#8201;:&#8201;1) or only with alcohol at 60&#8211;70&#8201;&#176;C, which enables subsequent cascade sequences to furnish &#947;&#8208;alkoxybutenolides. Density functional theory (DFT) studies have been employed to shed light on the feasibility of geometrical alkene isomerization and alcohol&#8208;assisted relay proton transfer mechanism for forming a hemiacetal intermediate prior to lactonization.







Abstract
The geometrical regioselective E&#8594;Z isomerization of a conjugated alkene under thermal activation pose a challenge due to microscopic reversibility. Herein we report that such reversibility issues can be circumvented by integrating E&#8594;Z isomerization with subsequent cyclization cascade, particularly in the absence of commonly employed light, acids, or metal&#8208;catalysts. Thus, linearly conjugated dienals in a mixture of toluene&#8208;alcohol (2&#8201;:&#8201;1) solvents or only with alcohol at 60&#8211;70&#8201;&#176;C can be converted to &#947;&#8208;alkoxybutenolides in moderate to good yields. The intermediary 2Z,4E&#8208;isomer can be isolated, which includes the first example of isolating the regioselective isomerization product under thermal conditions. Density functional theory (DFT) studies have been employed to shed light on the feasibility of geometrical alkene isomerization and ensuing cascade sequences. It has been observed that the regioselective 2E,4E&#8594;2Z,4E isomerization of dienal is a thermodynamically facile (&#916;G &lt;0) process. Structural elucidation further reveals that the presence of a certain charge transfer and a non&#8208;covalent interaction may be the primary reasons for the enhanced stability of the 2Z,4E&#8208;isomer. The thermodynamic plausibility of the subsequent cascade reaction from the Z&#8208;isomer to the anticipated product in the presence of a polar protic solvent (here MeOH) is also explicated. Out of the two probable pathways, the &#8220;hemiacetal pathway&#8221; involving a relay proton transfer is kinetically more feasible due to the diminished activation barrier than the &#8220;conjugate addition pathway&#8221;.

         <title>Multi&#8208;responsive Electropolymer Surface Coatings Based on Azo Molecular Switches and Carbazoles: Light, pH, and Electrochemical Control of Z&#8594;E Isomerization in Thin Films</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxidative electropolymerization of bis&#8208;carbazole containing azo monomers is a facile approach for preparing light&#8208;responsive azo&#8208;based surface coatings. The formed stable films retain the photochemical properties and pH sensitivity of the azo molecular switches and demonstrate electrocatalytic control over Z&#8594;E azo bond isomerization.







Abstract
Light&#8208;responsive surfaces are attracting increasing interest, not least because their physicochemical properties can be selectively and temporally controlled by a non&#8208;invasive stimulus. Most existing immobilization strategies involve the chemical attachment of light&#8208;responsive moieties to the surface, although this approach often suffers from a low surface concentration of active species or a high inhomogeneity of applied coatings. Herein, electropolymerization of carbazoles as a facile and rapid approach for preparing light&#8208;responsive azo&#8208;based surface coatings is presented. The electrochemical oxidative polymerization of bis&#8208;carbazole containing azo&#8208;monomers yields stable films, in which the photochemical properties and specific pH sensitivity of azo molecular switches are retained. Moreover, the molecular design enables electrocatalytic control over Z&#8594;E azo double bond isomerization facilitated by the conductive polycarbazole backbone. Ultimately, the high degree of control over macromolecular properties yields conductive surface coatings responsive to a range of stimuli, showing great promise as a strategy for versatile application in organic electronics.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Precise modifications of cyclic titanium&#8208;oxo cluster: We report an efficient thiol&#8208;Michael addition approach for the precise modifications of cyclic titanium&#8208;oxo cluster (CTOC). This approach can afford high yields of fully functionalized CTOCs, which provides a powerful platform for achieving versatile functionalization of precise transition metal clusters and further applications.







Abstract
In expanding our research activities of superlattice engineering, designing new giant molecules is the necessary first step. One attempt is to use inorganic transition metal clusters as building blocks. Efficient functionalization of chemically precise transition metal clusters, however, remains a great challenge to material scientists. Herein, we report an efficient thiol&#8208;Michael addition approach for the modifications of cyclic titanium&#8208;oxo cluster (CTOC). Several advantages, including high efficiency, mild reaction condition, capability of complete addition, high atom economy, as well as high functional group tolerance were demonstrated. This approach can afford high yields of fully functionalized CTOCs, which provides a powerful platform for achieving versatile functionalization of precise transition metal clusters and further applications.

         <title>A multi&#8208;pyridine&#8208;anchored and &#8208;linked bilayer photocathode for water reduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of efficient photocathodes is of critical importance for the constructions of promising tandem photoelectrochemical cells. Most known dye&#8208;sensitized photocathodes are prepared with the conventional carboxylic or phosphonic acid anchors and requires the presence of other terminal linking groups to connect catalysts, suffering from high synthetic difficulty and low adsorption stability in aqueous media. Herein, a compact bilayer photocathode is prepared by using a pyrene&#8208;based photosensitizer with multiple terminal pyridine moieties as both the anchoring and linking groups to connect a Co hydrogen&#8208;evolution catalyst to the NiO substrate. The catalyst and dye molecule are assembled in a layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer manner on NiO through the metal&#8208;pyridine coordination.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The development of efficient photocathodes is of critical importance for the constructions of promising tandem photoelectrochemical cells. Most known dye-sensitized photocathodes are prepared with the conventional carboxylic or phosphonic acid anchors and requires the presence of other terminal linking groups to connect catalysts, suffering from high synthetic difficulty and low adsorption stability in aqueous media. Herein, a compact bilayer photocathode is prepared by using a pyrene-based photosensitizer with multiple terminal pyridine moieties as both the anchoring and linking groups to connect a Co hydrogen-evolution catalyst to the NiO substrate. The catalyst and dye molecule are assembled in a layer-by-layer manner on NiO through the metal-pyridine coordination. This photocathode exhibits good dye adsorption stability in aqueous media. A stable cathodic photocurrent of 70 &#956;A/cm2 has been achieved with H2 being generated at the photocathode under the visible-light irradiation. The Faraday efficiency of H2 evolution was estimated to be 9.1%. Transient absorption spectral studies suggest that the interfacial hole transfer occurs within a few of picoseconds.

         <title>Chiral 4&#8208;MeO&#8208;Pyridine (MOPY) Catalyst for Enantioselective Cyclopropanation: Attenuation of Lewis Basicity Leads to Improved Catalytic Efficiency</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The design of pyridine&#8208;derived organocatalysts aims at the increase of their Lewis basicity, however such an approach is not always efficient. For example, strongly Lewis basic DMAP is completely inefficient as catalyst in the cyclopropanation reaction. Herein we disclose an alternative approach that relies on attenuation of DMAP Lewis basicity. Specifically, the replacement of 4&#8208;dimethylamino substituent in DMAP for 4&#8208;MeO group delivered a highly efficient catalyst for cyclopropanation of electron&#8208;deficient olefins with &#945;&#8208;bromoketones. Kinetic studies provide compelling evidence that the superior catalytic efficiency of 4&#8208;MeO pyridine (MOPY) is to be attributed to the favorable balance between Lewis basicity and leaving group ability. The use of chiral, enantiomerically pure MOPY catalyst has helped to achieve high enantioselectivities (up to 91:9 er) in the previously unreported pyridine&#8208;catalyzed cyclopropanation reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Azotriptycenes: Photoswitchable Molecular Brakes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The control of molecular motions is a central topic of molecular machine research. Molecular brakes are fundamental building blocks towards such goal as they allow deliberately decelerating specific motions after an outside stimulus is applied. Here we present azotriptycenes as structural framework for light&#8208;controlled molecular brakes. The intrinsic kinetics and their changes upon azotriptycene isomerization are scrutinized comprehensively by a mixed theoretical and variable temperature NMR approach. With azotriptycenes C&#8208;N bond rotation rates can be decelerated or accelerated reversibly by up to five orders of magnitude. Rate change effects are highly localized and are strongest for the C&#8208;N bond connecting a triptycene rotor fragment to the central diazo group. The detailed mechanistic insights provide a solid basis for further conscious design and applications in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>Simple Synthesis of 1,2&#8208;Dideoxy&#8208;2&#8208;Vinyl Carbohydrates by Tin&#8208;Free Radical Reactions of Xanthates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Vinyl&#8208;substituted carbohydrates have been synthesized from glycals derived from hexoses and pentoses. Key step is the radical reaction of xanthates in the presence of triethylborane, a nontoxic reagent. The mechanism has been investigated by isolation of various side products, which speak for a reversibility of the cyclopropylmethyl radical ring&#8208;opening. Compared to reactions with tributyltin hydride, higher regioselectivities in favor of the 2&#8208;vinylsubstituted sugars have been obtained. Yields are slightly lower with triethylborane, but all products have been isolated in analytically pure form. The new reaction is applicable to benzyl&#8208; and silyl&#8208;protected carbohydrates, which makes free sugars accessible as well. Overall, more than 15 1,2&#8208;dideoxy&#8208;2&#8208;vinyl carbohydrates have been synthesized from simple precursors in only few steps.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Azecine fragments are frequently presented in natural products and bioactive compounds. However, minor efforts have been devoted to these 10&#8208;membered N&#8208;heterocycless, and their synthesis is still challenging.

Abstract
A general and concise synthetic pathway for the preparation of four different 5,8&#8217;&#8208;coupled naphthylisoquinoline alkaloids, employing a specially developed nickel/N,N&#8208;ligand&#8208;catalyzed atroposelective Negishi coupling is reported. In the first reported direct atroposelective coupling of the fully substituted precursors, the naturally occurring cross&#8208;coupled products were generally obtained directly in reasonable yields and high enantiomeric purities. For the synthesis of the cross&#8208;coupling precursors, we employed a modification of Bringmann's known approach to the dihydroisoquinoline compounds and a newly developed route for the naphthalene building blocks. For the latter 1,8&#8208;dioxynaphthalene precursors, our strategy utilized Hartwig's borylation/methylation approach and included the efficient installation of orthogonal protecting groups.

         <title>Function&#8208;Led Design of Covalent&#8208;Organic&#8208;Framework Membranes for Precise Ion Separation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with their customizable architectures and tunable pore functionalities present a significant potential to revolutionize membrane&#8208;based ion&#8208;separation processes. The focus of this Review is to offer a succinct, yet comprehensive discussion of how the unique features of COF membranes can be exploited in a range of ion&#8208;separation applications.







Abstract
Insufficient access to clean water and resources has emerged as one of the most pressing issues affecting people globally. Membrane&#8208;based ion separation has become a focal point of research for the generation of fresh water and the extraction of energy elements. This Review encapsulates recent advancements in the selective ion transport of covalent organic framework (COF) membranes, accomplished by strategically pairing diverse monomers to create membranes with various pore sizes and environments for specific purposes. We first discuss the merits of using COF materials as a basis for fabricating membranes for ion separation. We then explore the development of COF membranes in areas such as desalination, acid recovery, and energy element extraction, with a particular emphasis on the fundamental principles of membrane design. Lastly, we address both theoretical and practical challenges, as well as potential opportunities in the targeted design of ion&#8208;selective membranes. The goal of this Review is to stimulate future investigative efforts in this field, which is of significant scientific and strategic importance.

         <title>Vapor&#8208;Induced Assembly of a Platinum(II) Complex Loaded on Layered Double Hydroxide Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anionic PtII complex molecules were electrostatically loaded onto cationic nanosheets of layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanoparticles. Although the PtII complexes were loaded discretely onto the nanoparticles in the dry state, when water vapor was adsorbed, the PtII complexes assembled on the nanoparticles owing to the increased mobility the adsorption of water caused in the interstitial space of the LDH aggregates.







Abstract
Controlled self&#8208;assembly of PtII complexes is key to the development of optical and stimuli&#8208;responsive materials, but designing and precisely controlling them is still difficult owing to weak intermolecular interactions. Herein, we report the successful water&#8208;vapor&#8208;induced assembly of an anionic PtII complex [Pt(CN)2(ppy)]&#8722; (Hppy=2&#8208;phenylpyridine) electrostatically loaded onto cationically charged layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanoparticles consisting of Mg2+ and Al3+ ions. When the PtII complexes were densely loaded onto the LDH nanoparticles, the assembly was maintained, even in dilute aqueous media. In the case of sparse loading, the PtII complexes were loaded discretely in the dry state; however, when water vapor was adsorbed, the increased mobility of the PtII complexes led to their assembly on the LDH nanoparticles. The presence of water vapor led to a drastic change in luminescence from green to orange.

         <title>Catalytic Inhibition of Base&#8208;Mediated Reactivity by a Self&#8208;Assembled Metal&#8208;Ligand Host</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cationic Fe4L6 tetrahedral cages with suitably sized cavities can bind the conjugate acids of basic catalysts, favoring their protonation by exogenous water in the system. This allows the catalytic inhibition of base&#8208;mediated reactions in the presence of as little as 5&#8201;% added cage, such as conjugate addition and Knoevenagel reactions.







Abstract
Spacious M4L6 tetrahedra can act as catalytic inhibitors for base&#8208;mediated reactions. Upon adding only 5&#8201;% of a self&#8208;assembled Fe4L6 cage complex, the conversion of the conjugate addition between ethylcyanoacetate and &#946;&#8208;nitrostyrene catalyzed by proton sponge can be reduced from 83&#8201;% after 75 mins at ambient temperature to &lt;1&#8201;% under identical conditions. The mechanism of the catalytic inhibition is unusual: the octacationic Fe4L6 cage increases the acidity of exogenous water in the acetonitrile reaction solvent by favorably binding the conjugate acid of the basic catalyst. The inhibition only occurs for Fe4L6 hosts with spacious internal cavities: minimal inhibition is seen with smaller tetrahedra or Fe2L3 helicates. The surprising tendency of the cationic cage to preferentially bind protonated, cationic ammonium guests is quantified via the comprehensive modeling of spectrophotometric titration datasets.

         <title>Anion&#8208;Dependent Hydrogen&#8208;Bond Polarity Switching in Ethylene&#8208;bridged Urea Oligomers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reversible coordination of various anions to a binding site at one terminus of a urea oligomer leads to a global switch in polarity of a linear chain of hydrogen&#8208;bonded ureas. The fluorescence response of a hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;responsive dithiomaleimide fluorophore at the opposite terminus reveals a relayed change in local hydrogen bonding directionality.







Abstract
The reversible coordination of anions to an N,N&#8217;&#8208;disubstituted 3,5&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)phenylurea located at a terminus of a linear chain of ethylene&#8208;bridged hydrogen&#8208;bonded ureas triggers a cascade of conformational changes. A series of hydrogen&#8208;bond polarity reversals propagates along the oligomer, leading to a global switch of its hydrogen&#8208;bond directionality. The induced polarity switch, transmitted through four reversible urea groups, results in a change in emission and excitation wavelengths of a fluorophore located at the opposite terminus of the oligomer. The molecule thus behaves as a chemical sensor with a relayed remote spectroscopic response to variations in anion concentration. The polarity switch induced by anion concentration constitutes an artificial communication mechanism for conveying information through oligomeric structures.

         <title>Isonitrile&#8208;Proline &#8208; A Versatile Handle for the Chemoselective Derivatization of Collagen Peptides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Isonitrileproline (Inp) is introduced as the first isonitrile&#8208;containing amino acid for solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis. The conformation directing properties of the isonitrile group and its effect on the collagen triple helix were elucidated. The value of Inp for peptide derivatization was showcased by a chemoselective ligation with a functional chlorooxime.







Abstract
Functional groups that allow for chemoselective and bioorthogonal derivatization are valuable tools for the labelling of peptides and proteins. The isonitrile is such a group but synthetic methods for its incorporation into peptides by solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis are not known. Here, we introduce (4S)&#8208; and (4R)&#8208;isonitrileproline (Inp) as building blocks for solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis. Conformational studies of (4S)&#8208; and (4R)&#8208;Inp and thermal stability analysis of Inp&#8208;containing collagen triple helices revealed that the isonitrile group exerts a stereoelectronic gauche effect. We showcase the value of Inp for bioorthogonal labelling by derivatization of Inp&#8208;containing collagen model peptides (CMPs). Dual labelling with a pair of bioorthogonal reactions of a CMP containing Inp and azidoproline residues further highlights the versatility of the new isonitrile&#8208;containing amino acids.

A green way towards COF: In this review, we highlight the research advances in the preparation of COFs based on facile, less dangerous, and greener methods like performing the reaction at ambient temperature or employing aqueous solvents, ionic liquids, and a mixture of organic solvents/water.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), as a new class of crystalline, well&#8208;ordered, and porous materials with intermittent constructions, are formed via organic structural parts connected through covalent bonds. These materials have been employed in several fields comprising pollutant adsorption and separation, catalysis, electrical conductivity, gas storage, etc. The preparation of COFs is mainly applied in tubes with high temperatures and degassing treatment. Furthermore, the reaction medium is involved in toxic organic solvents like toluene, dioxane, mesitylene, acetonitrile, and so on. Hence, discovering clean medium and green approaches has attracted wide attention. Recently, facile, less dangerous, and greener methods have been developed for COFs synthesis in diverse applications like performing the reaction at ambient temperature or employing aqueous solvents, ionic liquids, and a mixture of organic solvents/water. This review article summarizes the eco&#8208;friendly production approaches of COFs for diverse applications.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Irradiated Multicomponent Reactions of Aliphatic Amines, Propiolate Acid Esters, and CF3SO2Na for Accessing &#946;&#8208;CF3 Enamines</title>

A novel visible&#8208;light driven two&#8208;step one&#8208;pot multicomponent reactions of aliphatic amines and propiolate acid esters for preparation of &#946;&#8208;CF3 enamines has been reported.







Abstract
A novel one&#8208;pot two&#8208;step multicomponent reaction has been achieved for the preparation of &#946;&#8208;CF3 enamines by using different aliphatic amines, propiolates, and CF3SO2Na as starting material. In this protocol, various aliphatic amines including primary amines, cyclic or acyclic secondary amines were demonstrated to be good coupling partners, and different &#946;&#8208;CF3 enamines were obtained in moderate to good yields. Among them, the primary aliphatic amines only gave pure (E)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CF3 enamines as products. The synthetic utility of the MCRs strategy was further demonstrated by mild conditions, gram&#8208;scale synthesis and natural sunlight&#8208;induced protocol. Preliminary mechanistic studies suggest that this trifluoromethylation of C(sp2)&#8722;H involves radical process.

The cover feature shows an industrial environment highlighting the production line conveyor belts on which substrates are inserted into a &#8220;blue light box&#8221; and are converted to the desired products. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202301934), F. Penteado, E.&#8197;J. Lenard&#227;o and co&#8208;workers report a sophisticated application of triselenium dicyanide (TSD) in a light&#8208;mediated transformation triggered by the generation of Se&#8208;centered radical species. By exploiting this activation strategy, a library of &#945;&#8208;carbonyl selenocyanates and 2&#8208;phenylimidazo[1,2&#8208;a]pyridine derivatives was satisfactorily prepared under mild reaction conditions.

A jewelry rack represents the square&#8208;lattice of a metal&#8211;organic framework. This is exemplified by a MOF being visible when the jewelry rack is reflected in the table mirror. The earrings on the rack are attached with S&#8722;S hooks that mimic the disulfide bonds used to append functional groups to MOFs in this work. The earrings lacking the S&#8208;hook are left resting on the table, unable to attach to the rack. More information can be found in the Research Article by D.&#8197;T. Genna and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202302144). Artwork: Kyla Nichol, BFA YSU 2024.

         <title>Functional Molecular Crystals from the Arylation of a Halogenoplatinum Complex: Stimuli Responsiveness, Comproportionation, and &#960;&#8208;Bridged Dimerization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By converting the halogen moiety of a metal complex into a &#960;&#8208;conjugated system, unique properties such as &#960;&#8208;bridged dimerization and comproportionation can be realized. To illustrate the unique bridging style of the dimer, a diagram of the arrangement of artificial satellites is depicted. The comproportionation is represented by the convergence of two rays, transforming into one ray with both characteristics. More information can be found in the Research Article by T. Seki and D. Korenaga (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202302333).

         <dc:description>The reactivity of sydnones and sydnonimines toward terminal alkynes under copper catalysis has been explored using High&#8208;Throughput&#8208;Experimentation. A large panel of ligands and reaction conditions have been tested to optimize the copper&#8208;catalyzed sydnone click reaction discovered by our group ten years ago. This screening approach led to the identification of new ligands, which boosted the catalytic properties of copper and allowed the discovery of a new copper&#8208;catalyzed click&#8208;and&#8208;release reaction involving sydnonimines. This reaction allowed chemoselective ligation of terminal alkynes with sydnonimines and, simultaneously, the release of an isocyanate fragment molecule that can be used for further transformations.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorination Influences the Bioisostery of Myo&#8208;Inositol Pyrophosphate Analogs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inositol pyrophosphates (PP&#8208;IPs) are densely phosphorylated messenger molecules involved in numerous biological processes. PP&#8208;IPs contain one or two pyrophosphate group(s) attached to a phosphorylated myo&#8208;inositol ring. 5PP&#8208;IP5 is the most abundant PP&#8208;IP in human cells. To investigate the function and regulation by PP&#8208;IPs in biological contexts, metabolically stable analogs have been developed. Here, we report the synthesis of a new fluorinated phosphoramidite reagent and its application for the synthesis of a difluoromethylene bisphosphonate analog of 5PP&#8208;IP5. Subsequently, the properties of all currently reported analogs were benchmarked using a number of biophysical and biochemical methods, including co&#8208;crystallization, ITC, kinase activity assays and chromatography. Together, the results showcase how small structural alterations of the analogs can have notable effects on their properties in a biochemical setting and will guide in the choice of the most suitable analog(s) for future investigations.</dc:description>

         <title>Naphthalene&#8208;Embedded Multi&#8208;Resonance Emitters Enabling Efficient Narrow Emissive Blue OLEDs

Naphthalene&#8208;embedded multi&#8208;resonance blue emitters based on N&#8722;B&#8722;O frameworks with different structural variation for finely tuning the photophysical properties, which enables effcient narrowband emissive organic light emitting diodes have been designed and investigated.







Abstract
Great achievements have been made in the development of organic light&#8208;emitting diodes in recent decades. However, achieving high color purity for blue emitters remains a challenge. In this study, we have designed and synthesized three naphthalene (NA)&#8208;embedded multi&#8208;resonance (MR) emitters, named SNA, SNB and SNB1, based on N&#8722;B&#8722;O frameworks with isomer variations for finely adjusting the photophysical properties. These emitters show tunable blue emission with emission peaks of 450&#8211;470&#8197;nm. Small full width of half maximum (FWHM) of 25&#8211;29&#8197;nm are achieved in these emitters, indicating the well maintaining of molecular rigidity and MR effect with NA extension. Such design also ensures a fast radiative decay. However, no obvious delayed fluorescence is observed in all three emitters due to the relatively large energy differences between the first singlet and triplet excited states. Both SNA and SNB enable high electroluminescent (EL) performance in doped devices with external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 7.2 and 7.9&#8201;%, respectively. When applying the sensitized strategy, devices based on SNA and SNB show huge improvement with EQE of 29.3 and 29.1&#8201;%. More importantly, SNB with twist geometry enables stable EL spectra with almost unchanged FWHM under different doping concentrations. This work demonstrates the potential of NA extension design in constructing narrowband emissive blue emitters.

         <title>Synthesis of 4&#8208;Deoxy&#8208;4&#8208;Fluoro&#8208;d&#8208;Sedoheptulose: A Promising New Sugar to Apply the Principle of Metabolic Trapping</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis of 4&#8208;deoxy&#8208;4&#8208;fluorosedoheptulose (4DFS) and 3&#8208;deoxy&#8208;3&#8208;fluorosedoheptulose (3DFS) as well as of suitable precursors for the synthesis of their [18F]&#8208;analogues is described. First biochemical investigations show that 4DFS is taken up by human fibroblasts and phosphorylated (giving 4DFS7P) but not further metabolized by transaldolase or transketolase. Thus, 4DFS has a high potential as new pentose phosphate pathway imaging probe.







Abstract
Fluorinated carbohydrates are important tools for understanding the deregulation of metabolic fluxes and pathways. Fluorinating specific positions within the sugar scaffold can lead to enhanced metabolic stability and subsequent metabolic trapping in cells. This principle has, however, never been applied to study the metabolism of the rare sugars of the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). In this study, two fluorinated derivatives of d&#8208;sedoheptulose were designed and synthesized: 4&#8208;deoxy&#8208;4&#8208;fluoro&#8208;d&#8208;sedoheptulose (4DFS) and 3&#8208;deoxy&#8208;3&#8208;fluoro&#8208;d&#8208;sedoheptulose (3DFS). Both sugars are taken up by human fibroblasts but only 4DFS is phosphorylated. Fluorination of d&#8208;sedoheptulose at C&#8208;4 effectively halts the enzymatic degradation by transaldolase and transketolase. 4DFS thus has a high potential as a new PPP imaging probe based on the principle of metabolic trapping. Therefore, the synthesis of potential radiolabeling precursors for 4DFS for future radiofluorinations with fluorine&#8208;18 is presented.

         <title>Ring Strain Energy of Diheteropnictogeniranes El2Pn (Pn=N, P, As, Sb)&#8211; Accurate versus Additive Approaches</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Accurate ring strain energies (RSE) were computed for a wide set of (dielementa)pnictogeniranes (El2Pn). Together with other reported rings, an additive methodology was developed by least squares regression using either atom&#8208; or bond&#8208;strain parameters, achieving a very acceptable accuracy. Factors affecting RSE were analyzed, including aromaticity and its differentiation from atom&#8208;centred diatropic currents.







Abstract
Accurate ring strain energy (RSE) values for sixty&#8208;six parent pnictogeniranes having two other identical p&#8208;block elements, El2Pn, have been reported. A decrease in RSE was observed to correlate with an increase in the p character of the AO used in endocyclic bonds, which is particularly remarkable on descending the groups 15 and 16. The latter also parallels higher &#8208;NICS(1) values, which seems not to be related with an increase in aromaticity, as pointed out by other NICS&#8208;related criteria, but to atom&#8208;centred diatropic currents mostly arising from the presence of lone pairs. Only in case of pnictogenaditrieliranes Tr2Pn (Tr=B, Al, Ga), the decrease of &#8208;NICS(1) is related to a lower H&#252;ckel&#8208;type 2&#960;&#8208;electron aromaticity on descending group 13. The use of an additive methodology based on atom&#8208;strain contributions enables estimation of RSEs for a large majority of all possible three&#8208;membered rings containing group 13&#8211;16 elements with modest accuracy (RMSE=4.371&#8197;kcal/mol), that could be remarkably improved by using bond&#8208;strain contributions (RMSE=1.183&#8197;kcal/mol) instead.

Abstract
A mechanochemistry&#8208;driven practical and efficient synthetic protocol for accessing diverse series of biologically relevant poly&#8208;functionalized 5&#8208;(arylselanyl)&#8208;1H&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazoles through copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed click reaction between aryl/heteroaryl acetylenes, diaryl diselenides, benzyl bromides, and sodium azide has been accomplished under high&#8208;speed ball&#8208;milling. Advantages of this method include operational simplicity, avoidance of using solvent and external heating, one&#8208;pot synthesis, short reaction time in minutes, good to excellent yields, broad substrate scope, and gram&#8208;scale applications. Furthermore, synthesized organoselenium compounds were synthetically diversified to biologically promising selenones.

         <title>Mechanochemical Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Carbon&#8208;Sulfur Bond Formation between Aryl Iodides and Aromatic Sulfur Surrogates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A green and mild carbon&#8208;sulfur coupling was realized by nickel catalysis under ball&#8208;milling conditions. The desired thioether products were generated from aryl iodides and aromatic thiol/disulfides with broad substrate scope. The Ni(i)/Ni(III) catalytic cycle was facilitated by the mechanochemistry process, thus providing an eco&#8208;friendly and time&#8208;saving strategy for the construction of the C&#8722;S bond in practical synthetic chemistry.







Abstract
The formation of aromatic thioethers from C&#8722;S coupling is of great importance in synthetic chemistry. Traditional solution strategies through transition&#8208;metal catalysis generally require bulk solution, heat, and longer reaction time. Herein, a mechano&#8208;promoted sulfenylation of aryl iodides with nickel catalysis is described. The active aromatic sulfide agents are in&#8208;situ generated from aromatic thiol or disulfide and subsequently adapted in the nickel catalytic cycle, with a tolerance of broad substituted groups under optimized conditions. In addition to the gram&#8208;scale synthesis that reveals the application potential of the method, the radical trapping and competitive experiments are also conducted for the mechanistic study, thus providing a plausible mechanism rationally. Furthermore, the proposed methodology is certificated as being versatile and following the green principles with ideal calculated values of green chemistry metrics, and the comparison with other approaches for C&#8722;S bond formation is also demonstrated.

         <title>Dual Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Nitrogen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ammonia is vital for fertilizer production, hydrogen storage, and alternative fuels. The conventional Haber&#8208;Bosch process for ammonia production is energy&#8208;intensive and environmentally harmful. Designing environmentally friendly and low&#8208;energy consumption strategies for electrocatalytic N2 reduction reaction (ENRR) in mild conditions is meaningful. Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) have been studied extensively for NRR due to their high atomic utilization and unique electronic structure but are limited by their poor faradic efficiency and low ammonia formation yield. Dual single&#8208;atom catalysts (DSACs) have recently emerged as a promising solution for the effective activation of molecular N2, providing diverse active sites and synergistic interactions between adjacent atoms. In this review, we summarize the latest advances in metal DSACs for electrochemical ENRR based on both theoretical calculations and experimental studies, including aspects such as their variety, coordination, support, N2 adsorption and activity mechanisms, the characterization of NRR and electrochemical cell Configuration. We also address challenges and prospects in this rapidly evolving field, providing a comprehensive overview of DSACs for ENRR.</dc:description>

         <title>A 3D Covalent Organic Framework with In&#8208;situ Formed Pd Nanoparticles for Efficient Electrochemical Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An effective catalyst for oxygen reduction reaction was prepared by in&#8197;situ formation of palladium nanoparticle (Pd NPs) within a three&#8208;dimensional covalent organic framework (COF) and carbonization. Due to the homogeneous dispersion and uniform size of Pd NPs, the catalyst reached a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.906&#8197;V, providing a new idea for cathode catalysts of fuel cells and zinc&#8208;air batteries.







Abstract
Non&#8208;platinum noble metals are highly desirable for the development of highly active, stable oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalysts for fuel cells and metal&#8208;air batteries. However, how to improve the utilization of non&#8208;platinum noble metals is an urgent issue. Herein, a highly efficient catalyst for ORR was prepared through homogeneous loading of Pd precursors by a domain&#8208;limited method in a three&#8208;dimensional covalent organic framework (COF) followed by pyrolysis. The morphology of the Pd nanoparticles (Pd NPs) was well maintained after carbonization, which was attributed to the rigid structure of the 3D COF. Thanks to the uniform distribution of Pd NPs in the carbon, the catalyst exhibited a remarkable half&#8208;wave potential of 0.906&#8197;V and a Tafel slope of 70&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1 in 0.1&#8197;M KOH, surpassing the commercial Pt/C catalyst (0.863&#8197;V and 75&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1). Furthermore, a maximum power density of 144.0&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 was achieved at 252&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, which was significantly higher than the control battery (105.1&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2). This work not only provides a simple strategy for in&#8208;situ preparation of highly dispersible metal catalysts in COFs, but also offers new insights into the ORR electrocatalysis.

         <title>Elucidating the Excited State Behavior of Pyridyl Pyridinium Systems via Computational and Transient Absorption Studies of Tetrahedral Multichromophoric Arrays and their Model Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A set of tetrameric molecules with four identical subunits bearing pyridyl pyridinium or bipyridinium moieties has been investigated by means of steady&#8208;state and time resolved spectroscopy and the results are corroborated by computational studies. The behavior of the tetrameric molecules, when compared with that of the corresponding model compounds (one of the four identical arms), highlights a remarkable electronic interaction between the subunits in the array.







Abstract
The tetrahedral shape&#8208;persistent molecule 14+, containing four identical pyridyl pyridinium units connected via a sp3 hybridized carbon atom, has been investigated in detail by means of steady&#8208;state and time resolved spectroscopy. Remarkable photophysical properties are observed, particularly in comparison with protonated and methylated analogues (1H48+, 1Me48+), which exhibit substantially shorter excited state lifetimes and lower emission quantum yields. Theoretical studies have rationalized the behavior of the tetrameric molecules relative to the monomers, with DFT and TD&#8208;DFT calculations corroborating steady&#8208;state (absorption and emission) and transient absorption spectra. The behavior of the monomeric compounds (each consisting in one of the four identical subunits of the tetramers, i.&#8201;e., 2+, 2H2+ and 2Me2+) considerably differs from that of the tetramers, indicating a strong electronic interaction between the subunits in the tetrameric species, likely promoted by the homoconjugation through the connecting sp3&#8197;C atom. 2+ is characterized by a peculiar S1&#8208;S2 excited state inversion, whereas the short&#8208;lived emitting S1 state of 2H2+ and 2Me2+ exhibits a partial charge&#8208;transfer character, as substantiated by spectro&#8208;electrochemical studies. Among the six investigated systems, only 14+ is a sizeable luminophore (&#934;em=0.15), which is related to the peculiar features of its singlet state.

         <title>Direct Solution&#8208;Phase Synthesis and Functionalization of 2D WSe2 for Ambient Stability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Simultaneous exfoliation and noncovalent functionalization of 2D WSe2 by commercial surfactants containing varying hydrophobic chain length and hydroxyl and mercapto head groups, which contribute to its long&#8208;term stability in aqueous suspension, is described.







Abstract
2H phase tungsten diselenide (WSe2) is a p&#8208;type 2D semiconductor from the transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) family with unique optoelectrical properties. Solution phase production of atomically thin WSe2 is challenging due to its instability under ambient conditions. We present a highly efficient and scalable solution method for simultaneously exfoliating and functionalizing WSe2 by leveraging the non&#8208;covalent interaction between mercapto&#8208;group and bulk WSe2. Single and few&#8208;layer 2H phase pure WSe2 sheets of lateral size up to 5&#8197;&#956;m with minimal basal plane defects, as revealed by XPS, Raman and FTIR spectroscopy, are produced in a water&#8208;ethanol mixture. Remarkably, WSe2 dispersion remains stable even at high concentrations (10&#8197;mg/mL) and exhibited high colloidal stability with a shelf&#8208;life exceeding a year. The findings from our study suggest that through precise manipulation of intercalation chemistry, mass production of solution&#8208;processable phase&#8208;sensitive 2D materials such as WSe2 can be achieved. This advancement holds great potential for facilitating their practical utilization in various real&#8208;world applications.

Remarkably, WSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; dispersion remains stable even at high concentrations (10&#8197;mg/mL) and exhibited high colloidal stability with a shelf-life exceeding a year. The findings from our study suggest that through precise manipulation of intercalation chemistry, mass production of solution-processable phase-sensitive 2D materials such as WSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; can be achieved. This advancement holds great potential for facilitating their practical utilization in various real-world applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electrosynthesis of Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Films with Well&#8208;Defined Facets</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we report a facile anodic electrochemical synthesis method for the in&#8208;situ preparation of metal&#8211;organic framework films with well&#8208;defined facets by precisely regulating the supersaturation of the growth units. This method provides a powerful toolbox for various applications that require precise control of crystal facets in MOF films.







Abstract
The deposition of metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) films with defined exposed facets is important to enhance the performance of these films for, for example, catalysis or separations. In this work, MOF films with specific exposed facets are electrodeposited anodically on various substrates (e.&#8201;g. on copper&#8208;sputtered Si wafers, copper meshes, copper foams, and polypropylene membranes). The influence of the deposition parameters, including the pH of the solution, current density, concentration of linker, and solvent, on the exposed facets of the deposited MOFs was investigated. The results suggest that precise control over the supersaturation during anodic deposition is a possible strategy for synthesizing MOF crystals with well&#8208;defined exposed facets. This approach provides a powerful toolbox for various applications requiring crystal facet control of MOF films.

         <title>Tunable Chromic Properties of Viologen&#8208;Metal Polymers Modulated by Coordination Modes for Inkless Erasable Printing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
With the help of theoretical calculations, we predicted that tunable chromic properties of viologen&#8208;metal polymers could be achieved through modulating coordination modes. Two ZnII&#8208;viologen model polymers were successfully synthesized and comparative experimental vigorously confirm bilateral coordination model exhibit quicker stimuli response, stronger color contrast, longer radical lifetime, which also has shown excellent inkless&#8208;erasable&#8208;printing performance.







Abstract
Inkless and erasable printing (IEP) based on chromic materials holds great promise to alleviate environmental and sustainable problems. Metal&#8211;organic polymers (MOPs) are bright platforms for constructing IEP materials. However, it is still challenging to design target MOPs with excellent specific functions rationally due to the intricate component&#8208;structure&#8208;property relationships. Herein, an effective strategy was proposed for the rational design IEP&#8208;MOP materials. The stimuli&#8208;responsive viologen moiety was introduced into the construction of MOPs to give it potential chromic behaviors and two different coordination models (i.&#8201;e. bilateral coordination model, M1; unilateral coordinated model, M2) based on the same viologen ligand were designed. Aided by theoretical calculations, model M1 was recommended secondarily as a more suitable system for IEP materials. Along this line, two representative viologen&#8208;ZnII MOPs 1 and 2 with models M1 and M2 were synthesized successfully. Experiments exhibit that 1 does have quicker stimuli response, stronger color contrast and longer radical lifetime compared to 2. Significantly, the obtained 1&#8208;IEP media brightly inherits the excellent chromic characteristics of 1 and the flexibility of the paper at the same time, which achieves most daily printing requirements, as well as enough resolution and durability to be used in identification by smart device.

         <title>Probing Interactions between Chiral Plasmonic Nanoparticles and Biomolecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Detecting interactions: This review of the interactions between chiral plasmonic nanoparticle systems and biomolecules focuses on the application of circular dichroism spectroscopy to probe such interactions, toward biosensing applications.







Abstract
Chiral plasmonic nanoparticles (and their assemblies) interact with biomolecules in a variety of different ways, resulting in distinct optical signatures when probed by circular dichroism spectroscopy. These systems show promise for biosensing applications and offer several advantages over achiral plasmonic systems. Arguably the most notable advantage is that chiral nanoparticles can differentiate between molecular enantiomers and can, therefore, act as sensors for enantiomeric purity. Furthermore, chiral nanoparticles can couple more effectively to chiral biomolecules in biological systems if they have a matching handedness, improving their effectiveness as biomedical agents. In this article, we review the different types of interactions that occur between chiral plasmonic nanoparticle systems and biomolecules, and discuss how circular dichroism spectroscopy can probe these interactions and inform how to optimize systems for biosensing and biomedical applications.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of Polycyclic 4,5&#8208;Dihydropyridazine&#8208;3(2H)&#8208;ones by Inverse Electron&#8208;Demand Diels&#8211;Alder (IEDDA) Reactions from Alkenes</title>

         <dc:description>
A new practical catalyst&#8208;free method for one&#8208;pot synthesis of polycyclic 4,5&#8208;pyridazine&#8208;3(2H)&#8208;ones from alkenes was developed. 4,5&#8208;Pyridazine&#8208;3(2H)&#8208;ones were obtained in high yields in the presence of water by Inverse Electron&#8208;Demand Diels&#8211;Alder (IEDDA) reactions between norbornene and barrelene&#8208;derived polycyclic alkenes, and s&#8208;tetrazines with leaving groups at the 3,6&#8208;positions. This method also worked successfully in monocyclic alkene cyclopentene and linear alkene styrene.







Abstract
In the classical Inverse Electron&#8208;Demand Diels&#8211;Alder (IEDDA) reactions between alkenes and tetrazines, 4,5&#8208;dihydropyridazines are formed. 4,5&#8208;Dihydropyridazines are rapidly converted to the more energetically stable 1,4&#8208;dihydropyridazines by 1,3&#8208;prototropic isomerization. In this study, instead of 1,4&#8208;dihydropyridazines, 4,5&#8208;dihydropyridazine&#8208;3(2H)&#8208;ones were obtained as a result of IEDDA reactions between tetrazines with leaving groups at the 3,6&#8208;positions, and norbornene and barrelene&#8208;derived polycyclic alkenes in the presence of moisture in air or solvent. To show that this new method works not only on strained polycyclic alkenes but also on monocyclic and linear alkenes, the corresponding 4,5&#8208;dihydropyridazine&#8208;3(2H)&#8208;ones were obtained in high yields from the reactions performed with styrene and cyclopentene as well. The chemical structures of the polycyclic 4,5&#8208;dihydropyridazine&#8208;3(2H)&#8208;ones were determined by NMR and HRMS analyses. In addition, the exact structures of the polycyclic 4,5&#8208;dihydropyridazine&#8208;3(2H)&#8208;ones were also experimentally proven by converting them to pyridazine&#8208;3(2H)&#8208;ones known in the literature.

         <title>The Effect of Intramolecular Hydrogen Bonds on the Rotational Barriers of the Biaryl C&#8722;C Axis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we show that the transition state of atropisomerization of tri&#8208;ortho&#8208;substituted biaryl was stabilized by intramolecular hydrogen bonds, resulting in a significant reduction in the steric repulsion around C&#8722;C axes and a decrease in the energy barrier of atropisomerization (&#916;&#916;G&#8800;(10&#8208;9)=46.7&#8197;kJ/mol).







Abstract
Axially chiral compounds are attracting more attention recently. Although hydrogen bonds are reported as a vital weak force that influences the properties of compounds, the effect of intramolecular hydrogen bonds on the atropisomerization of the Caryl&#8722;Caryl single bonds has not yet been well quantitatively investigated. Here, a series of axially chiral biaryl compounds were synthesized to study the effect of hydrogen bonds on the rotational barriers of the biaryl C&#8722;C axis. Experimental studies demonstrated that the rotational barrier of hydrogen bonding biaryl 9 was significantly lower (46.7&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1) than biaryl 10 without hydrogen bonds. Furthermore, theoretical studies revealed that the intramolecular hydrogen bond stabilized the transition state (TS) of tri&#8208;ortho&#8208;substituted biaryl 9, relieving the steric repulsion in the TS. We believe that this study will provide chemists with a deeper understanding of the atropisomerization process of axially chiral biaryl compounds.

&lt;p&gt;Here, we show that the transition state of atropisomerization of tri-ortho-substituted biaryl was stabilized by intramolecular hydrogen bonds, resulting in a significant reduction in the steric repulsion around C&#8722;C axes and a decrease in the energy barrier of atropisomerization (&#916;&#916;G&lt;sup&gt;&#8800;&lt;/sup&gt;

         <title>Synthesis, Structure, and Redox and Optical Properties of 5,10,15,20&#8208;Tetraaryl&#8208;5&#8208;azaporphyrinium Salts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;templated annulation method is established for the synthesis of 5,10,15,20&#8208;tetraaryl&#8208;5&#8208;monoazaporphyrinium (TAMAP) salts, which exhibit characteristic redox and optical properties reflecting the electronic effects of the meso&#8208;nitrogen atom. The zinc complex of TAMAP salt generated singlet oxygen in quantum yield of 0.77 under irradiation with visible light.







Abstract
The fundamental properties of azaporphyrins can be modulated over a wide range by changing the number of meso&#8208;nitrogen atoms. Reported herein are the first examples of 5,10,15,20&#8208;tetraaryl&#8208;5&#8208;azaporphyrinium (MTAMAP) salts, which were prepared via metal&#8208;templated cyclization of the corresponding zinc(II) and copper(II) complexes of 10&#8208;aryl&#8208;1&#8208;chloro&#8208;19&#8208;benzoyl&#8208;5,15&#8208;dimesityl&#8208;10&#8208;azabiladiene&#8208;ac. The inclusion of one meso&#8208;nitrogen atom in the 5,10,15,20&#8208;tetraarylporphyrin skeleton considerably changes the redox and optical properties as well as the degree of aromaticity of the porphyrin ring. The present findings suggest that MTAMAP salts would be promising scaffolds for the development of new azaporphyrin&#8208;based ionic fluorophores and photosensitizers.

         <title>Application of Machine Learning Algorithms to Metadynamics for the Elucidation of the Binding Modes and Free Energy Landscape of Drug/Target Interactions: a Case Study</title>

Machine Learning&#8208;powered metadynamics enabling the unbiased selection of collective variables to describe the binding free energy of a non&#8208;covalent metallodrug/DNA G&#8208;quadruplex adduct and the effects of water solvation.







Abstract
In the context of drug discovery, computational methods were able to accelerate the challenging process of designing and optimizing a new drug candidate. Amongst the possible atomistic simulation approaches, metadynamics (metaD) has proven very powerful. However, the choice of collective variables (CVs) is not trivial for complex systems. To automate the process of CVs identification, two different machine learning algorithms were applied in this study, namely DeepLDA and Autoencoder, to the metaD simulation of a well&#8208;researched drug/target complex, consisting in a pharmacologically relevant non&#8208;canonical DNA secondary structure (G&#8208;quadruplex) and a metallodrug acting as its stabilizer, as well as solvent molecules.

         <title>Surface Modification of ITO with N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Precursors Results in Electron Selective Contacts in Organic Photovoltaic Devices</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modify ITO: Bench stable IPr&#8208;CO2 adduct is employed for the modification of ITO electrodes by spin coating method which develops surface dipoles with dipole moments pointing away from the ITO layer. As a result, the work function of the modified ITO electrodes has reduced significantly which provides a potentially high electron selectivity contact in corresponding OPV devices and a high VOC performance in organic solar cells.







Abstract
Surface modification of indium tin oxide (ITO) electrodes with organic molecules is known to tune their work function which results in higher charge carrier selectivity in corresponding organic electronic devices and hence influences the performance of organic solar cells. In recent years, N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) have also been proven to be capable to modify the work function of metals and semimetals compared to the unfunctionalized surface via the formation of strong covalent bonds. In this report, we have designed and performed the modification of the ITO surface with NHC by using the zwitterionic bench stable IPr&#8208;CO2 as the NHC precursor, applied via spin coating. Upon modification, the work function of ITO electrodes was reduced significantly which resulted in electron selective contacts in corresponding organic photovoltaic devices. In addition, various characterization techniques and analytical methods are used to elucidate the nature of the bound species and the corresponding binding mechanism of the material to the ITO surface.

         <title>Gold&#8208;Catalyzed Cyclization of Yndiamides with Isoxazoles via &#945;&#8208;Imino Gold Fischer Carbenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Gold catalysis is an important method for alkyne functionalization. Here we report the gold&#8208;catalyzed formal [3+2] aminative cyclization of yndiamides and isoxazoles in a direct synthesis of polysubstituted diaminopyrroles, which are important motifs in drug discovery. Key to this process is the formation, and subsequent cyclization, of an &#945;&#8208;imino gold Fischer carbene, which represents a new type of gold carbene intermediate. The reaction proceeds rapidly under mild conditions, with high regioselectivity being achieved by introducing a subtle steric bias between the nitrogen substituents on the yndiamide. DFT calculations revealed that the key to this regioselectivity was the interconversion of isomeric gold keteniminiun ions via a low&#8208;barrier &#960;&#8208;complex transition state, which establishes a Curtin&#8208;Hammett scenario for isoxazole addition. By using benzisoxazoles as substrates, the reaction outcome could be switched to a formal [5+2] cyclization, leading to 1,4&#8208;oxazepines.</dc:description>

         <title>Isolation, Characterization and Reactivity of Key Intermediates Relevant to Reductive (Electro)catalysis with Cp*Rh Complexes containing Pyridyl&#8208;MIC (MIC = Mesoionic Carbene) Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In recent years, metal complexes of pyridyl&#8208;mesoionic carbene (MIC) ligands have been reported as excellent homogeneous and molecular electrocatalysts. In combination with group 9 metals, such ligands form highly active catalysts for hydrogenation/transfer hydrogenation/hydrosilylation catalysis and electrocatalysts for dihydrogen production. Despite such progress, very little is known about the structural/electrochemical/spectroscopic properties of crucial intermediates for such catalytic reactions with these ligands: solvato complexes, reduced complexes and hydridic species. We present here a comprehensive study involving the isolation, crystallographic characterization, electrochemical/spectroelectrochemical/theoretical investigations, and in&#8208;situ reactivity studies of all the aforementioned crucial intermediates involving Cp*Rh and pyridyl&#8208;MIC ligands. A detailed mechanistic study of the precatalytic activation of [RhCp*] complexes with pyridyl&#8208;MIC ligands is presented. Intriguingly, amphiphilicity of the [RhCp*]&#8208;hydride complexes was observed, displaying the substrate dependent transfer of H+, H&#8729; or H&#8722;. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first of its kind targeting intermediates and reactive species involving metal complexes of pyridyl&#8208;MIC ligands and investigating the interconversion amongst them.</dc:description>

         <title>Transformation of Highly Hydrophobic Triarylphosphines into Amphiphiles via Staudinger Reaction with Hydrophilic Trichlorophenyl Azide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Owing to its hydrophobic properties and reactivity, triarylphosphines (PAr3) are promising precursors for the development of new amphiphiles. However, an efficient and reliable synthetic method for amphiphiles based on highly hydrophobic PAr3 is still required. Herein, we report a straightforward transformation of highly hydrophobic PAr3 into amphiphiles via the Staudinger reaction. By simply mixing PAr3 and a hydrophilic trichlorophenyl azide containing two hydrophilic chains, amphiphiles bearing a N=P bond (i.e., an azaylide moiety) were quantitatively formed. The obtained azaylide&#8208;based amphiphiles were remarkably water&#8208;soluble, enabling their spontaneous self&#8208;assembly into 2 nm&#8208;sized micelles composed of 4&#8211;5 molecules in water with a low critical micelle concentration (up to 0.05 mM or less) due to the effective intermolecular interactions among the hydrophobic surfaces. Although the azaylide moiety is easily hydrolyzed in the presence of water, the azaylide in the amphiphiles displayed notable stability in water even at 60 h, which stems from the LUMO modulation induced by the presence of three electron&#8208;withdrawing chloro groups and two twisted alkoxycarbonyl groups, according to DFT calculations. An amphiphile having a large hydrophobic surface solubilized various hydrophobic organic dyes through efficient intermolecular interactions, resulting in the dyes exhibiting either monomer or excimer emissions in water.</dc:description>

         <title>Reduced Graphene Oxide Modulated FeSe/C Anode Materials for High&#8208;Stable and Long&#8208;Life Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reduced graphene oxide (rGO) has been demonstrated to effectively enhance the potassium storage performance of transition metal selenides due to its robust mechanical properties and high conductivity.  However, the impact of rGO on the electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface, a crucial factor in the electrochemical performance of potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs), requires further exploration. In this study, we synthesized a seamless architecture of rGO on FeSe/C nanocrystals (FeSe/C@rGO). Comparative analysis between FeSe/C and FeSe/C@rGO reveals that the rGO layer exhibits robust adsorption energies towards EC and DEC, inducing the formation of organic&#8208;rich solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) without damage to the structural integrity. Furthermore, incorporating rGO triggers K+&#8208;ions into the double electrode layer (EDL), markedly improving the transport of K+&#8208;ions. As a PIB anode, FeSe/C@rGO exhibits a reversible capacity of 332 mAh g&#8208;1 at 200 mA g&#8208;1 after 300 cycles, along with excellent long&#8208;term cycling stability, showcasing an ultralow decay rate of only 0.086% per cycle after 1900 cycles at 1000 mA g&#8208;1.</dc:description>

N&#8208;alkylation of diazo compounds: Value&#8208;added to industry waste diazo compounds using feedstock alcohols under earth&#8208;abundant manganese catalysis.alcoholdehydrogenative couplingdrug intermediateshydrogenkinetic studiesmanganese







Abstract
Sustainable chemical production requires fundamentally new types of catalysts and catalytic technologies. The development of coherent and robust catalytic systems based on earth&#8208;abundant transition metals is essential, but highly challenging. Herein, we systematically explored a general hydrogenative cleavage/N&#8208;alkylation tandem of cyclic and acyclic diazo (N=N) compounds to value&#8208;added amines under manganese catalysis. The reaction is catalyzed by a single&#8208;site molecular manganese complex and proceeds via tandem dehydrogenation, transfer hydrogenation, and borrowing hydrogenation strategies. Interestingly, the reaction involves abundantly available renewable feedstocks, such as alcohols, that can act as (transfer)hydrogenating and alkylating agents. The synthetic application of our approach in large&#8208;scale pharmaceutical synthesis and easy access to highly demanding N&#8208;CH3/CD3 derivatives are also demonstrated. Kinetic studies show that the reaction rate depends on the concentration of alcohol and Mn&#8208;catalyst and follows fractional orders. Several selective bond activation/formation reactions occur sequentially via amine&#8211;amide metal&#8208;ligand cooperation.

         <title>Chiroptical Recognition of Carboxylates with Charge&#8208;Neutral Double&#8208;Stranded Zinc(II) Helicates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Isomer truel &#8208; The guest calls out the winner. The dynamic interconversion of a neutral metal&#8208;based container&#8208;like helicate enables chiroptical recognition of chiral mono&#8208; and dicarboxylates by CD spectroscopy. Efficient guest recognition paired with an optimal chiral information transfer resulting from a coordinative binding mode allows the usage of the receptor for chirality analysis.







Abstract
Chirality analysis of small molecules for the determination of their enantiopurity is nowadays ruled by streamlined chromatographic methods which utilize chiral stationary phases. Chiroptical probes which rely on host&#8211;guest interactions are so far overshadowed by the latter but have the benefit of depending only on common spectroscopic techniques such as CD spectroscopy to distinguish enantiomers and to quantify their ratio. Interest into this receptor&#8208;based approach is constantly rising because non&#8208;invasive high&#8208;throughput screenings with a minimal waste production can be performed. In this study we investigate the possibility to utilize metal&#8208;based containers in form of charge&#8208;neutral helicates able to recognize anions for this purpose. Key building block of the helicates are triazole units which show rotational freedom and give rise to either a meso&#8208;structure or a racemic mixture of the right&#8208; and left&#8208;handed complex. A chiroptical response of the probe is observed upon recognition of chiral mono&#8208; or dicarboxylates and chirality analysis of tartrate is conducted by CD spectroscopy.

         <title>Continuous&#8208;Flow Synthesis of Cycloparaphenylene Building Blocks on a Large Scale</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cycloparaphenylenes ([n]CPPs) and similar nanohoops are accessible by combining building blocks. Herein, we report a continuous&#8208;flow synthesis of key CPP building blocks by using self&#8208;built reactors on up&#8208;to kilogram scale. This fast and large&#8208;scale access opens new possibilities for further research in the field of curved aromatic compounds.







Abstract
The synthesis of [n]cycloparaphenylenes ([n]CPPs) and similar nanohoops is usually based on combining building blocks to a macrocyclic precursor, which is then aromatized in the final step. Access to those building blocks in large amounts will simplify the synthesis and studies of CPPs as novel functional materials for applications. Herein, we report a continuous&#8208;flow synthesis of key CPP building blocks by using versatile synthesis techniques such as electrochemical oxidation, lithiations and Suzuki cross&#8208;couplings in self&#8208;built reactors on up&#8208;to kilogram scale.

         <title>Gated Photochromism of Dithienylethene&#8208;Embedded Expanded Calixphyrins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DTE&#8208;embedded expanded calixphyrins exhibit reversible photochromism. The closed forms of these porphyrinoids are oxidized with DDQ to lock the recorded information by converting to photochemically inactive expanded porphyrins, which can be reduced with NaBH4 to restore the photochromism activity. This gated photochromic behavior was demonstrated in PMMA film.







Abstract
Dithienylethene (DTE)&#8208;embedded expanded porphyrins were synthesized and confirmed to be photochemically inactive due to the lowest excited state of the expanded porphyrins. On the other hand, DTE&#8208;embedded expanded calixphyrins exhibited reversible photochromism upon UV&#8208;irradiation to form colored closed forms, which reverted to colorless open forms upon red&#8208;light irradiation. The closed forms were oxidized with DDQ or the air to lock the recorded information by converting to photochemically inactive expanded porphyrins. This was unlocked by reduction with NaBH4 to restore expanded calixphyrins with photochromism activity. These gated photochromic behaviors were demonstrated in PMMA (polymethyl methacrylate) film.

         <title>Diverse Reactions of Formazanate/Formazan with Tetrylenes: Reduction, C&#8722;H Bond Activation, Substitution and Addition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The diverse redox chemistry of formazanate/formazan with low&#8208;valent group&#8197;14 compounds is inverstigated. Both formazanate potassium salt and neutral formazan ligands were subjected to reactions with tetrylenes. In the former case, the anticipated salt metathesis reactions occurred, accompanied by unexpected reduction/insertion and C&#8722;H activation. The latter reactions displayed substitution and addition reaction patterns.







Abstract
The reactivity of the formazanate potassium salt [LtBuK(thf)] (LtBu=PhNNC(4&#8208;tBuPh)NNPh) with the group&#8197;14 chlorotetrylenes [{PhC(tBuN)2}ECl] (E=Si, Ge, Sn) was investigated. Three corresponding compounds with unique configurations were formed, demonstrating the diverse reactivity of the system. In addition to the anticipated salt metathesis reactions of the potassium salt with the chlorine function of tetrylenes, unexpected reduction/insertion steps into the N=N bond of the formazanate (Si, Ge) and subsequent C&#8722;H activation (Ge) were also observed. Furthermore, when the neutral formazan ligand [LtBuH] was exposed to silylenes [{PhC(tBuN)2}SiCl] and [LPhSiNMePy], substitution and addition reactions occurred. These discoveries significantly enrich the diversity of formazanate/formazan redox chemistry, opening up new avenues for exploration in this field.

Mono&#8208;boryl complexes: The synthesis of the first terminal mono&#8208;boryl complexes of nickel, which are not stabilized by a pincer ligand, is reported.







Abstract
The synthesis of the first terminal mono&#8208;boryl complexes of nickel, which are not stabilized by a pincer ligand, is reported. The reaction of the nickel bis&#8208;boryl complex cis&#8208;[Ni(iPr2ImMe)2(Bcat)2] 1 (cat=1,2&#8208;O2C6H4) with the small donor ligand PMe3 led to a complete ligand exchange at nickel with reductive elimination of B2cat2 and formation of the bis&#8208;NHC adduct [B2cat2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;(iPr2ImMe)2] 3 and [Ni(PMe3)4] 2 as the metal&#8208;containing species. Electrophilic attack of MeI on complex 1 or ligand dismutation of 1 with trans&#8208;[Ni(iPr2ImMe)2Br2] led to loss of only one boryl ligand of 1 and afforded the nickel mono&#8208;boryl complexes trans&#8208;[Ni(iPr2ImMe)2(Bcat)Br] 4&#8201;a and trans&#8208;[Ni(iPr2ImMe)2(Bcat)I] 4&#8201;b.

         <title>A Preference for Heterolepticity &#8208; Schlenk Type Equilibria in Organometallic Beryllium Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reaction of homoleptic beryllium halide with diphenyl beryllium complexes leads to the clean formation of heteroleptic beryllium Grignard compounds [(L)1&#8208;2BePhX]1&#8208;2 (X=Cl, Br, I; L=C&#8208;, N&#8208;, O&#8208;donor ligand). The influence of ligands and solvent on these compounds, their formation and exchange equilibria in solution were investigated, together with the factors determining the complex constitution.

         <title>Multifunctional Roles of Clathrate Hydrate Nanoreactors for CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Clathrate hydrates act hydrogen&#8208;bonded nanoreactors that possess multifunctional properties, facilitating CO2 reduction such as confinement, tethering, H&#8208;bond catalysis, and proton pumping.







Abstract
In this study, we explore a possible platform for the CO2 reduction (CO2R) in one of water's solid phases, namely clathrate hydrates (CHs), by ab initio molecular dynamics and well&#8208;tempered metadynamics simulations with periodic boundary conditions. We found that the stacked H2O nanocages in CHs help to initialize CO2R by increasing the electron&#8208;binding ability of CO2. The substantial CO2R processes are further influenced by the hydrogen bond networks in CHs. The first intermediate CO2&#8722; in this process can be stabilized through cage structure reorganization into the H&#8208;bonded [CO2&#8722;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#8722;OHcage] complex. Further cooperative structural dynamics enables the complex to convert into a vital transient [CO22&#8722;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#8722;OHcage] intermediate in a low&#8208;barrier disproportionation&#8208;like process. Such a highly reactive intermediate spontaneously triggers subsequent double proton transfer along its tethering H&#8208;bonds, finally converting it into HCOOH. These hydrogen&#8208;bonded nanoreactors feature multiple functions in facilitating CO2R such as confining, tethering, H&#8208;bond catalyzing and proton pumping. Our findings have a general interest and extend the knowledge of CO2R into porous aqueous systems.

         <title>Re&#8208;Thinking Dimer Design Principles with Indolonaphthyridine Intramolecular Singlet Fission</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intramolecular singlet fission (i&#8208;SF) mechanism of INDT dimers linked via para&#8208;phenyl, meta&#8208;phenyl and fluorene bridging groups is investigated. Using ultra&#8208;fast spectroscopy the highest rate of singlet fission is found in the para&#8208;phenyl linked dimer. The mechanistic picture of polarisable singlet fission materials, such as INDT, extends beyond the traditional mechanistic landscape.







Abstract
Singlet fission is a phenomenon that could significantly improve the efficiency of photovoltaic devices. Indolonaphthyridine thiophene (INDT) is a photostable singlet fission material that could potentially be utilised in singlet fission&#8208;based photovoltaic devices. This study investigates the intramolecular singlet fission (i&#8208;SF) mechanism of INDT dimers linked via para&#8208;phenyl, meta&#8208;phenyl and fluorene bridging groups. Using ultra&#8208;fast spectroscopy the highest rate of singlet fission is found in the para&#8208;phenyl linked dimer. Quantum calculations show the para&#8208;phenyl linker encourages enhanced monomer electronic coupling. Increased rates of singlet fission were also observed in the higher polarity o&#8208;dichlorobenzene, relative to toluene, indicating that charge&#8208;transfer states have a role in mediating the process. The mechanistic picture of polarisable singlet fission materials, such as INDT, extends beyond the traditional mechanistic landscape.

         <title>DFT Study of Imine&#8208;Exchange Reactions in Iron(II)&#8208;Coordinated Pincers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

Proton shuttle: A DFT study on condensation and transimination reactions of an Fe2+&#8208;coordinated diimine pyridine pincer was conducted. Titration experiments confirmed the use of Fe2+ as a model metal ion, after which the reactions were investigated computationally using traditional four&#8208;membered ring transition states for proton transfer. When those displayed unrealistic high energy barriers, two ethylamines were added to function as proton shuttles, which lowered the activation energies to realistic values.







Abstract
The imine bond is among the most applied motifs in dynamic covalent chemistry. Although its uses are varied and often involve coordination to a transition metal for stability, mechanistic studies on imine exchange reactions so far have not included metal coordination. Herein, we investigated the condensation and transimination reactions of an Fe2+&#8208;coordinated diimine pyridine pincer, employing wB97XD/6&#8208;311G(2d,2p) DFT calculations in acetonitrile. We first experimentally confirmed that Fe2+ is strongly coordinated by these pincers, and is thus a justified model ion. When considering a four&#8208;membered ring&#8208;shaped transition state for proton transfers, the required activation energies for condensation and transimination reaction exceeded the values expected for reactions known to be spontaneous at room temperature. The nature of the incoming and exiting amines and the substituents on the para&#8208;position of the pincer had no effect on this. Replacing Fe2+ with Zn2+ or removing it altogether did not reduce it either. However, the addition of two ethylamine molecules lowered the energy barriers to be compatible with experiment (19.4 and 23.2&#8197;kcal/mol for condensation and transimination, respectively). Lastly, the energy barrier of condensation of a non&#8208;coordinated pincer was significantly higher than found for Fe2+&#8208;coordinating pincers, underlining the catalyzing effect of metal coordination on imine exchange reactions.

         <title>Erythronium Bonds: Noncovalent Interactions Involving Group&#8197;5 Elements as Electron&#8208;Density Acceptors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vanadium(V) derivatives, and to a lesser extent analogous compounds of niobium and tantalum, form attractive interactions with electron&#8208;rich atoms (neutral or anionic). This bonding, given also by vanadate units in bromoperoxidase enzymes, is markedly different from the coordination bonds formed by the same elements, and possesses the distinctive features of &#963;&#8208;hole interactions. The term &#8220;erythronium bond&#8221; is proposed to denote this kind bonding to honor Andr&#232;s Manuel del R&#237;o, who discovered vanadium. More information can be found in the Research Article by A. Frontera, G. Resnati, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202302176).

         <title>Iminoboranes With Parent B=NH Entity: Imino Group Metathesis, Nucleophilic Reactivity and N&#8722;N Coupling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Imine or not Imine? We present a rare example of a parent iminoborane with the unfunctionalized B=NH entity. The reactivity of this rare compound class shows remarkable differences to boron's neighbor element carbon as found in organic imines.







Abstract
While R2C=N&#8722;R double bonds in organic imines are well established, the related iminoboranes R&#8208;B=N&#8722;R are either prone to oligomerization or can only be stabilized at sufficient steric congestion. In particular, the examples of unsubstituted parent B=N&#8208;H entity are rare. We demonstrate that the amino imidazoline&#8208;2&#8208;imine ligand system (HAmIm) not only gives rise to the isolation of a parent (AmIm)B=N&#8722;H iminoborane, but also to species of type (AmIm)B=N&#8208;SiMe3 with concomitant stabilization by lithium bromide. The double bond character in these systems is unambiguously corroborated by DFT calculations. The steric accessibility of the (AmIm)B=NH unit allows facile reactivity including metathesis reactions with C=O and C=S bonds, nucleophilic addition toward organic and organometallic carbonyl compounds, but also oxidative N&#8722;N coupling within a dimeric unit. Thus, the chemical behavior of the (AmIm)B=N&#8722;H and (AmIm)B=N&#8208;SiMe3 is distinctly different from that of organic imines.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Catalytic Hydrogenolysis of Chlorosilanes into Hydrosilanes with &#8220;Inverse&#8221; Frustrated Lewis Pairs
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrosilanes can be synthesized from chlorosilanes and H2, thanks to a combination of a superbase and a borane catalyst, forming an inverse FLP. A mechanistic study demonstrates that the key intermediate species is a highly reactive borohydride, arising from H2 heterolytic splitting.







Abstract
The challenging metal&#8208;free catalytic hydrogenolysis of silyl chlorides to hydrosilanes is unlocked by using an inverse frustrated Lewis pair (FLP), combining a mild Lewis acid (Cy2BCl) and a strong phosphazene base (BTPP) in mild conditions (10&#8197;bar of H2, r.&#8201;t.). In the presence of a stoichiometric amount of the base, the hydrosilanes R3SiH (R=Me, Et, Ph) are generated in moderate to high yields (up to 95&#8201;%) from their chlorinated counterparts. A selective formation of the valuable difunctional monohydride Me2SiHCl is also obtained from Me2SiCl2. A mechanism is proposed based on stoichiometric experiments and DFT calculations; it highlights the critical role of borohydride species generated by the heterolytic splitting of H2.

         <dc:description>New developments in the field of Lewis acidity are highlighted, with the focus of novel Lewis acids and Lewis superacids of group 2, 13, 14, and 15 elements. Several important basics, illustrated by modern examples (classification of Donor&#8208;Acceptor (DA) complexes, amphoteric nature of any compound in terms of DA interactions, reorganization energies of main group Lewis acids and the role of the energies of frontier orbitals) are presented and discussed. It is emphasized that the Lewis acidity phenomena are general and play vital role in different areas of chemistry: from weak &#8220;atomophilic&#8221; interactions to the complexes of Lewis superacids.</dc:description>

         <title>Collective Synthesis of Sarpagine and Macroline Alkaloid&#8208;Inspired Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Design strategies that can access natural product&#8208;like chemical space in an efficient manner may facilitate the discovery of biologically relevant compounds. We have employed a divergent intermediate strategy to construct an indole&#8208;alkaloid inspired compound collection derived from two different molecular design principles, i.e. biology&#8208;oriented synthesis and pseudo&#8208;natural products. The divergent intermediate was subjected to acid&#8208;catalyzed or newly discovered Sn&#8208;mediated conditions to selectively promote intramolecular C&#8208; or N&#8208;acylation, respectively. After further derivatization, a collection totalling 84 compounds representing four classes was obtained. Morphological profiling via the cell painting assay coupled with a subprofile analysis showed that compounds derived from different design principles have different bioactivity profiles. The subprofile analysis suggested that a pseudo&#8208;natural product class is enriched in modulators of tubulin, and subsequent assays led to the identification of compounds that supress in vitro tubulin polymerization and mitotic progression.</dc:description>

         <title>Gas&#8208;Phase Alkali&#8208;Metal Cation Affinities of Stabilized Enolates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The chemistry of alkali&#8208;metal enolates is dominated by ion pairing. To improve our understanding of the intrinsic interactions between the alkali&#8208;metal cations and the enolate anions, we have applied Cooks&#8217; kinetic method to determine relative M+ (M = Li, Na, K) affinities of the stabilized enolates derived from acetylacetone, ethyl acetoacetate, diethyl malonate, ethyl cyanoacetate, 2&#8209;cyanoacetamide, and methyl malonate monoamide in the gas phase. Quantum chemical calculations support the experimental results and moreover afford insight into the structures of the alkali&#8208;metal enolate complexes. The affinities decrease with increasing size of the alkali&#8208;metal cations, reflecting weaker electrostatic interactions and lower charge densities of the free M+ ions. For the different enolates, a comparison of their coordinating abilities is complicated by the fact that some of the free anions undergo conformational changes resulting in stabilizing intramolecular interactions. If these complicating effects are disregarded, the M+ affinities correlate with the electron density of the chelating functionalities, i.e., the carbonyl and/or the nitrile groups of the enolates. A comparison with the known association constants of the corresponding alkali&#8208;metal enolates in solution points to the importance of solvation effects for these systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Differentiating between Label and Protein Conformers in Pulsed Dipolar EPR Spectroscopy with the dHis&#8208;Cu2+(NTA) Motif</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pulsed Dipolar EPR Spectroscopy (PDS) in combination with site&#8208;directed spin labeling is a powerful tool in structural biology. However, the commonly used spin labels are conjugated to biomolecules via&#160;flexible linkers, which hampers the translation of distance distributions into biomolecular conformations. In contrast, the spin label (nitrilotriacetic acid)copper(II) [Cu2+(NTA)] bound to two histidines (dHis) is rigid and can be more easily translated into biomolecular conformations. Here, we use this label on the 71 kDa Yersinia outer protein O (YopO) to decipher whether a previously experimentally observed bimodal distance distribution is due to two conformations of the biomolecule or of the flexible spin labels. Two different PDS experiments, i.e., Pulsed Electron&#8208;Electron Double Resonance (PELDOR aka DEER) and Relaxation Induced Dipolar Modulation Enhancement (RIDME), yield unimodal distance distribution with the dHis&#8208;Cu2+(NTA) motif, suggesting that the&#160;&#945;&#8208;helical backbone of YopO adopts a single conformation in frozen solution. In addition, we show that the Cu2+(NTA)&#8208;label preferentially binds to the target double Histidine (dHis) sites even in the presence of 22 competing native histidine residues. This suggests that the generation of a His&#8208;null background is not required for this spin labeling methodology. Together these results highlight the value of the dHis&#8208;Cu2+(NTA) motif in PDS experiments.</dc:description>

         <title>Prediction of strong solvatochromism in a molecular photocatalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Based on quantum chemical calculations, we predict strong solvatochromism in a light&#8208;driven molecular photocatalyst for hydrogen generation, i.e., we show that the electronic and optical properties of the photocatalyst strongly depend on the solvent it is dissolved in. Our calculations in particular indicate a solvent dependent relocation of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO). Ground&#8208;state density functional theory and linear response time dependent density functional theory calculations are applied in order to investigate the influence of implicit solvents on the structural, electronic and optical properties of a molecular photocatalyst. Only at high dielectric constants of the solvent, the HOMO is located at the metal center of the photosensitizer, whereas at low dielectric constants the HOMO is centered at the metal atom of the catalytically active complex. We elucidate the electronic origins of this strong solvatochromic effect and sketch the consequences of these insights for the use of photocatalysts in different environments.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorogen&#8208;Functionalized Mesoporous Silica Hybrid Sensing Materials: Applications in Cu2+ Detection</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Since Cu2+ ions play a pivotal role in both ecosystems and human health, the development of a rapid and sensitive method for Cu2+ detection holds significant importance. Fluorescent mesoporous silica materials (FMSMs) have garnered considerable attention in the realm of chemical sensing, biosensing, and bioimaging due to their distinctive structure and easily functionalized surfaces. As a result, numerous Cu2+ sensors based on FMSMs have been devised and extensively applied in environmental and biological Cu2+ detection over the past few decades. This review centers on the recent advancements in the methodologies for preparing FMSMs, the mechanisms underlying sensing, and the applications of FMSMs&#8208;based sensors for Cu2+ detection. Lastly, we present and elucidate pertinent perspectives concerning FMSMs&#8208;based Cu2+ sensors.</dc:description>

         <title>Nitrene C&#8211;H Bond Insertion Approach to Carbazolones and Indolones, and a Reactivity Departure for 7&#8208;Membered Analogues.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A modular platform for facile access to 1,2,3,9&#8208;tetrahydro&#8208;4H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;4&#8208;ones (H4&#8208;carbazolones) and&#160;3,4&#8208;dihydrocyclopenta[b]indol&#8208;1(2H)&#8208;ones (H2&#8208;indolones)&#160;is described. The requisite 6&#8208; and 5&#8208;membered 2&#8208;arylcycloalkane&#8208;1,3&#8208;dione precursors were readily obtained through a Cu&#8208;catalyzed arylation of 1,3&#8208;cyclohexanediones or by a ring expansion of aryl succinoin derivatives. Enolization of one carbonyl group in the diones, conversion to a leaving group, and subsequent azidation gave 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;3&#8208;azidocycloalk&#8208;2&#8208;en&#8208;1&#8208;ones. This two&#8208;step, one&#8208;pot azidation is highly regioselective with unsymmetrically substituted 2&#8208;arylcyclohexane&#8208;1,3&#8208;diones.&#160;&#160;The regioselectivity, which is important for access to single isomers of 3,3&#8208;disubstituted carbazolones, was analyzed mechanistically and computationally. Finally, a Rh&#8208;catalyzed nitrene/nitrenoid insertion into the&#160;ortho&#160;C&#8211;H bond of the aryl moiety gave the H&#173;4&#8208;carbazolones and H2&#8208;indolones. One carbazolone was elaborated to an intermediate reported in the total synthesis of&#160;N&#8208;decarbomethoxychanofruticosinate, (&#8211;)&#8208;aspidospermidine, (+)&#8208;kopsihainanine A. With 2&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;cycloheptanedione, prepared from cyclohexanone and benzaldehyde, the azidation reaction was readily accomplished. However, the Rh&#8208;catalyzed reaction unexpectedly led to a labile but characterizable azirine rather than the indole derivative. Computations were performed to understand the differences in reactivities of the 5&#8208; and 6&#8208;membered 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;3&#8208;azidocycloalk&#8208;2&#8208;en&#8208;1&#8208;ones in comparison to the 7&#8208;membered analogue, and to support the structural assignment of the azirine.</dc:description>

         <title>Underwater Adhesives from Redox&#8208;responsive Polyplexes of Thiolated Polyamide Polyelectrolytes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the fabrication of optically clear underwater adhesives using polyplexes of oppositely charged partially&#8208;thiolated polyamide polyelectrolytes (TPEs). The thiol content of the constituent PEs was varied to assess its influence on the adhesive properties of the resulting glues. These catechol&#8208;free, redox&#8208;responsive TPE&#8208;adhesives were formulated in aquo and exhibited high optical transparency and strong adhesion even on submerged or moist surfaces of diverse polar substrates such as glass, aluminium, wood, and bone pieces. The adhesives could be cured under water through oxidative disulphide crosslinking of the constituent TPEs. The polyamide backbone provided multi&#8208;site H&#8208;bonding interactions with the substrates while the disulphide crosslinking provided the cohesive strength to the glue. Strong adhesion of mammalian bones (load bearing capacity upto 7 kg/cm2) was achieved using the adhesive containing 30 mol% thiol residues. Higher pH and use of oxidants such as povidone&#8208;iodine solution enhanced the curing rate of the adhesives, and so did the use of Tris buffer instead of Phosphate buffer.&#160;The porous architecture of the adhesive and its progressive degradation in aqueous medium over the course of three weeks bode well for diverse biomedical applications where temporary adhesion of tissues is required.</dc:description>

         <title>A Three&#8208;Dimensional (3D) Framework of Freestanding Vanadium Nitride Nanowires&#160;for Dendrite&#8208;Free&#160;and Long Life&#8208;span Lithium Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium (Li) metal is a promising anode candidate for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries owing to its high theoretical capacity and&#160;low&#160;electrochemical potential. However, uneven Li nucleation, uncontrollable&#160;dendritic growth, infinite voltage change&#160;and even safety issues hinder its commercial application. Herein, a&#160;three&#8208;dimensional&#160;(3D) framework of freestanding vanadium nitride nanowires (VN NWs) is established as Li host for dendrite&#8208;free Li metal anode. A lithiophilic Li3N interlayer&#160;which&#160;in&#8208;situ&#160;formed by the surface reaction between molten Li and VN NWs is utilized to guide&#160;a uniform Li nucleation and deposition within the skeleton, as well as avoid the dendrite formation.&#160;Meanwhile, VN NWs can&#160;decrease&#160;local current density, homogenize Li&#8208;ion &#64258;ux&#160;and accommodate volume fluctuations of the anode&#160;due to its 3D structure with high electron conductivity. Thus, the corresponding composite Li metal anode&#160;delivers&#160;a long&#8208;life span of 500 cycles (1000 hrs) at a current density of 0.5 mA cm&#8208;2, and exhibits lower nucleation&#160;over&#8208;potential&#160;and voltage hysteresis&#160;at&#160;different current densities from 0.5~5 mA cm&#8208;2&#160;in carbonate electrolyte.&#160;In conclusion, this work provides a new type&#160;of&#160;scaffold with both high electronic conductivity and excellent lithiophilicity for stable Li anodes.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Lithium (Li) metal is a promising anode candidate for high-energy-density batteries owing to its high theoretical capacity and&#160;low&#160;electrochemical potential. However, uneven Li nucleation, uncontrollable&#160;dendritic growth, infinite voltage change&#160;and even safety issues hinder its commercial application. Herein, a&#160;three-dimensional&#160;(3D) framework of freestanding vanadium nitride nanowires (VN NWs) is established as Li host for dendrite-free Li metal anode. A lithiophilic Li3N interlayer&#160;which&#160;in-situ&#160;formed by the surface reaction between molten Li and VN NWs is utilized to guide&#160;a uniform Li nucleation and deposition within the skeleton, as well as avoid the dendrite formation.&#160;Meanwhile, VN NWs can&#160;decrease&#160;local current density, homogenize Li-ion &#64258;ux&#160;and accommodate volume fluctuations of the anode&#160;due to its 3D structure with high electron conductivity. Thus, the corresponding composite Li metal anode&#160;delivers&#160;a long-life span of 500 cycles (1000 hrs) at a current density of 0.5 mA cm-2, and exhibits lower nucleation&#160;over-potential&#160;and voltage hysteresis&#160;at&#160;different current densities from 0.5~5 mA cm-2&#160;in carbonate electrolyte.&#160;In conclusion, this work provides a new type&#160;of&#160;scaffold with both high electronic conductivity and excellent lithiophilicity for stable Li anodes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Reactive Reductive Species Participating Photodynamic Therapy for Cancer Treatment</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although the development of oxidative photodynamic therapy (O&#8208;PDT) based on reactive oxygen species (ROS) has made great progress for cancer treatment, tumor hypoxia, cellular adaptation and intrinsic antioxidant defenses are still obstacles at this stage. Fortunately, with the discovery and development of reactive reductive species (RRS) in the PDT process, reductive PDT (R&#8208;PDT) receives increasing research interests. The R&#8208;PDT featuring oxygen&#8208;independence is effective by reduction therapy, which promises that it still has excellent therapeutic efficacy in extremely hypoxic or even anaerobic environment. In the concept, we introduce representative strategies to boost the Type I photosensitizing pathway, and then focus on the most recent R&#8208;PDT involving hydrogen radical (H&#8226;) and single electron transfer (SET) process.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Photochromic Properties of Diaryl [5]Helicene Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoinduced tuning of aromaticity and correlative molecular properties has attracted enormous interest in recent years for both modulating photochromism properties and designing novel photochromic materials. Here, we report on the synthesis and photochemical characterizations investigation of diaryl[5]helicene based diarylethene molecular switches. 3,4&#8208;Bis(2,4&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;5&#8208;phenylthiophen&#8208;3&#8208;yl)dibenzo[c,g]phenanthrene derivative 1a showed no photochromic reaction, while 3,4&#8208;bis(2&#8208;methyl&#8208;5&#8208;phenylthiophen&#8208;3&#8208;yl)dibenzo[c,g]phenanthrene derivative 2a and 3,4&#8208;bis(5&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;phenylthiazol&#8208;4&#8208;yl)dibenzo[c,g]phenanthrene derivative 3a exhibited reversible photochromism in different aprotic solvents with specific light irradiation. Meanwhile, the diarylethene compounds 2a and 3a underwent turn&#8208;off mode fluorescence photoswitchings together with the photoisomerization reaction upon light irradiation. Remarkably, the photoinduced changes in aromaticity of [5]helicene as a central ethene bridge along with the relative smaller activation energy and higher frequency factor facilitated the thermal bleaching rates of diarylethene switches 2 and 3 in solution. This research provides a new insight for designing aromatic diarylethene photoswitches for reversible fluorescence switching behaviour, photoinduced changes in aromaticity and further fast thermal back reaction.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Hierarchical combinations involving metal&#8210;ligand interactions and host&#8210;guest interactions can consolidate building blocks with unique functions into material properties. Herein, we reported the construction and hierarchical self&#8208;assembly of multifunctional trinuclear AuI tricarbene complex containing three crown ether units and three ferrocene units. In addition, we investigated the host&#8210;guest interactions between multifunctional trinuclear AuI tricarbene complex and organic ammonium salts, revealing crown ether&#8208;based host&#8210;guest interactions can effectively regulate the electrochemical properties of the complex.

         <title>Fluorescence Enhancement of Adamantane&#8208;Modified Dyes in Aqueous Solution via Supramolecular Interaction with Methyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin and Their Application in Cell Imaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The fluorescence of functional dyes was generally quenched in aqueous solution, which hindered their application in water&#8208;bearing detections. In this work, a novel strategy based on host&#8208;guest interaction was provided for the purpose of fluorescence enhancement in aqueous solution and cell imaging. Three adamantane&#8208;modified fluorescent dyes (Coum&#8208;Ad, NP&#8208;Ad, NR&#8208;Ad) with coumarin, 1,8&#8208;naphthalimide and Nile Red as fluorophores were initially designed and prepared. The ((adamantan&#8208;1&#8208;yl)methyl)amino group, as the auxochrome of these dyes, complexed with methylated &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (M&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CD) via supramolecular interaction, and then fluorescent supramolecular nanoparticles (FSNPs) were formed by self&#8208;assembly in water. The inclusion equilibrium constant (K) could be as high as 3.94&#215;104 M&#8208;1. With the addition of M&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CD, fluorescence quantum yields of these dyes were separately improved to 69.8%, 32.9% and 41.3%. Inspired by the above satisfactory results, six adamantane&#8208;modified probes organelle&#8208;NPAds with organelle&#8208;targeting capability were further obtained. As the formation of hydrogen bonds between organelle&#8208;NPAd2 and M&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CD verified by theoretical calculation, K of organelle&#8208;NPAd2 (5.13&#215;104 M&#8208;1 ~ 4.53&#215;105 M&#8208;1) with M&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CD was higher than that of organelle&#8208;NPAd1 (1.15&#215;104 M&#8208;1 ~ 3.66&#215;104 M&#8208;1) and their fluorescence quantum yields increased to 32.8% ~ 83.6% in aqueous solution. In addition, fluorescence enhancement was realized in cell imaging with the addition of M&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CD.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In recent years, understanding the mechanism of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) has become the primary choice for designing high&#8208;efficiency, low&#8208;cost, metal&#8208;free organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs). Herein, we propose a strategically designed chalcone based donor&#8208;acceptor system, where intensification of delayed fluorescence with decrease in temperature (300K to 100K) is observed; the theoretical investigations of electronic states and orbital characters uncovered a new cold rISC pathway in donor&#8208;acceptor system, where rISC occurs through the down&#8208;conversation of higher triplet exciton (from T3) to lowest singlet state (S1), having negative energy splitting, thus no thermal energy is required. The comprehensive research described herein might open&#8208;up new avenues in donor&#8208;acceptor system over the conventional up&#8208;convention of triplet exciton and demonstrates that not necessarily all delayed fluorescence are thermally activated (TADF).</dc:description>

         <title>Neutral Silylyne Complex of Molybdenum: Synthesis, Properties, and Access to Silaiminoacyl Complexes via [2+3] Cycloaddition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A neutral silylyne complex of molybdenum was synthesized by the stepwise dehydrogenation method and its properties were compared with those of the tungsten analog. The complex takes a dimeric form as crystals but afford a monomer&#8208;dimer equilibrium in solution.

         <title>Chasing Turns and Twists: Unraveling the One&#8208;Step Synthesis, Intricate Pathways, and Structural Revelations of N&#8208;Aryl Aza&#8208;quasi[8]circulenes</title>

         <dc:description>We report the efficient one&#8208;step synthesis of N&#8208;Aryl aza&#8208;quasi[8]circulenes starting from bis(biaryl)carbazoles. The intermediacy of N&#8208;aryl aza[7]helicene is investigated, and the Scholl oxidative cyclization route is invoked here to overcome the large strain during the formation of N&#8208;aryl aza&#8208;quasi[8]circulenes from N&#8208;aryl aza[7]helicene. Notably, this transformation occurs without the need for directing groups and proceeds from a more helical to a less helical pathway. Both the N&#8208;aryl aza[7]helicene and N&#8208;aryl aza&#8208;quasi[8]circulene are confirmed by single crystal X&#8208;ray structural analysis. The enantiomers of N&#8208;aryl aza[7]helicene are separated by chiral HPLC and analyzed by circular dichroism spectroscopy to investigate their chiroptical properties. However, N&#8208;aryl aza&#8208;quasi[8]circulene racemizes rapidly. The radical cations generated from aza&#8208;quasi[8]circulene through chemical oxidation exhibit broad absorption in the near&#8208;IR region and air stability up to 24 h. Optical and electrochemical studies with helicene and quasicirculene derivatives highlight their potential in organic electronic devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Chalcogen Bond Catalysis with Telluronium Cations for Bromination Reaction: Importance of Electrostatic and Polarization Effects</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently, chalcogen bond catalysts&#160;with telluronium cations have garnered considerable attention in organic reactions. In this work, chalcogen bond catalysis on the bromination reaction of anisole with N&#8208;bromosuccinimide (NBS) with the telluronium cationic catalysts has been explored with density functional theory (DFT). The catalytic reaction is divided into two stages: the bromine transfer step and the proton transfer step. Based on the computational results, one can find the rate&#8208;determining step is the bromine transfer step. Moreover, the present study elucidates that a stronger chalcogen bond (ChB) between catalysts and NBS will give better catalytic performance. Additionally, this work also clarified the importance of the electrostatic and polarization effects in the chalcogen bond between the oxygen atom of NBS and the Te atom of the catalyst in this bromination reaction. The electrostatic and polarization effects are significantly influenced by the electron&#8208;withdrawing ability of the substitution groups on the catalysts. Moreover, the structure&#8208;property relationship between the strength of ChB bond, electrostatic effect, polarization effect and catalytic performance are established for the designation of more efficient chalcogen bond catalysts.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Development of general and simple designs of catalytic electrodes for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is critical.&#160; The present work demonstrates the multiple roles played by a hydrogel polymer in the fabrication and activity enhancement of the nanoelectrocatalyst.&#160; A nanocomposite thin film of Pd with the insulating hydrogel, poly(2&#8208;hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (PHEMA), is fabricated through a facile in situ process, the polymer itself functioning as the reducing/stabilizing agent in the formation of Pd nanoparticles.&#160; Pd&#8208;PHEMA on Ni foam enables efficient HER in alkaline medium with a low overpotential; the polymer enables the electrocatalysis by its swelling and confinement of the electrolyte.&#160; Most significantly, when the electrode is subjected to an optimized cycling protocol, the overpotential decreases steadily, reaching an impressively low value of 36 mV (@10 mA cm&#8208;2).&#160; A low Tafel slope (68 mV dec&#8208;1), high exchange current density, Faradaic efficiency and TOF (3.27 mA cm&#8208;2, 99%, 122.7 h&#8208;1), and extended stability are achieved.&#160; Detailed investigations reveal the active role of the polymer in the evolution of the nanocatalyst, itself undergoing favorable morphological changes.&#160; The study illustrates the widened scope for developing efficient and stable catalytic electrodes with hydrogel polymers and unique features that promote the generation of green hydrogen.</dc:description>

Intersystem crossing: FRET (40.4&#8197;ps) and CS (1.55&#8197;ns) were observed, upper 3BDP* was populated by charge recombination, followed by the slow intramolecular TTET (14.5&#8197;&#956;s), which generates 3PBI* state, the triplet state formed via the RP ISC shows an unusual ESP phase pattern of (e, e, e, e, e, e), which is a rare example of S&#8208;T+1/T0 states mixing in the RP ISC mechanism.







Abstract
Bodipy (BDP)&#8208;perylenebisimide (PBI) donor&#8211;acceptor dyads/triad were prepared to study the spin&#8211;orbit charge&#8208;transfer intersystem crossing (SOCT&#8208;ISC). For BDP&#8208;PBI&#8208;3, in which BDP was attached at the imide position of PBI, higher singlet oxygen quantum yield (&#934;&#916;=85&#8201;%) was observed than the bay&#8208;substituted derivative BDP&#8208;PBI&#8208;1 (&#934;&#916;=30&#8201;%). Femtosecond transient absorption spectra indicate slow F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET; 40.4&#8197;ps) and charge separation (CS; 1.55&#8197;ns) in BDP&#8208;PBI&#8208;3, while for BDP&#8208;PBI&#8208;1, CS takes 2.8&#8197;ps. For triad BDP&#8208;PBI&#8208;2, ultrafast FRET (149&#8197;fs) and CS (4.7&#8197;ps) process were observed, the subsequent charge recombination (CR) takes 5.8&#8197;ns and long&#8208;lived 3PBI* (179.8&#8197;&#956;s) state is populated. Nanosecond transient absorption spectra of BDP&#8208;PBI&#8208;3 show that the CR gives upper triplet excited state (3BDP*) and subsequently, via a slow intramolecular triplet energy transfer (14.5&#8197;&#956;s), the 3PBI* state is finally populated, indicating that upper triplet state is involved in SOCT&#8208;ISC. Time&#8208;resolved electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy revealed that both radical pair ISC (RP ISC) and SOCT&#8208;ISC contribute to the ISC. A rare electron spin polarization of (e, e, e, e, e, e) was observed for the triplet state formed via the RP ISC mechanism, due to the S&#8722;T+1/T0 states mixing.

         <title>Spatially Resolved Chiroptical Spectroscopies Emphasizing Recent Applications to Thin Films of Chiral Organic Dyes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A critical and up&#8208;to&#8208;date overview is given on spatially resolved chiroptical spectroscopies, which represent a promising tool for mapping and disentangling local supramolecular structures in thin films of chiral organic dyes.







Abstract
Instrumental techniques able to identify and structurally characterize the aggregation states in thin films of chiral organic &#960;&#8208;conjugated materials, from the first&#8208;order supramolecular arrangement up to the microscopic and mesoscopic scale, are very helpful for clarifying structure&#8208;property relationships. Chiroptical imaging is currently gaining a central role, for its ability of mapping local supramolecular structures in thin films. The present review gives an overview of electronic circular dichroism imaging (ECDi), circularly polarized luminescence imaging (CPLi), and vibrational circular dichroism imaging (VCDi), with a focus on their applications on thin films of chiral organic dyes as case studies.

     alt="Spatially Resolved Chiroptical Spectroscopies Emphasizing Recent Applications to Thin Films of Chiral Organic Dyes"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A critical and up-to-date overview&lt;/b&gt; is given on spatially resolved chiroptical spectroscopies, which represent a promising tool for mapping and disentangling local supramolecular structures in thin films of chiral organic dyes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instrumental techniques able to identify and structurally characterize the aggregation states in thin films of chiral organic &#960;-conjugated materials, from the first-order supramolecular arrangement up to the microscopic and mesoscopic scale, are very helpful for clarifying structure-property relationships. Chiroptical imaging is currently gaining a central role, for its ability of mapping local supramolecular structures in thin films. The present review gives an overview of electronic circular dichroism imaging (ECD&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;), circularly polarized luminescence imaging (CPL&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;), and vibrational circular dichroism imaging (VCD&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;), with a focus on their applications on thin films of chiral organic dyes as case studies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chalcogen Bonding Catalysis: Tellurium, the Last Frontier?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>: Chalcogen bonding (ChB) is the non&#8208;covalent interaction occurring between chalcogen atoms as Lewis acid sites and atoms or groups of atoms able to behave as Lewis bases through their lone pair or p electrons. Analogously to its sister halogen bonding, the high directionality of this interaction was implemented for the precise structural organization in the solid state and in solution. Regarding catalysis, ChB is now accepted as a new mode of activation as demonstrated by the increased number of examples in the last five years. In the family of ChB catalysts, those based on tellurium rapidly appeared to overcome their lighter sulfur and selenium counterparts. In this review, we highlight the Lewis acid properties of tellurium&#8208;based derivatives in solution and summarize the start&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art of their applications in catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Binding properties of small electrophilic anions [B6X5]&#8722; and [B10X9]&#8722; (X = Cl, Br, I): Activation of small molecules based on &#960;&#8208;backbonding</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Superelectrophilic anions constitute a special class of molecular anions, which show strong binding of weak nucleophiles despite their negative charge. In this study, the binding characteristics of smaller gaseous electrophilic anions of the types [B6X5]&#8722; and [B10X9]&#8722; (with X = Cl, Br, I) are computationally and experimentally investigated and compared to those of the larger analogues [B12X11]&#8722;. The positive charge of vacant boron increases from [B6X5]&#8722; via [B10X9]&#8722; to [B12X11]&#8722;, as evidenced by increasing attachment enthalpies towards typical &#963;&#8208;donor molecules (noble gases, H2O). However, this behavior is reversed for &#963;&#8208;donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor molecules. [B6Cl5]&#8722; binds strongest to N2 and CO, even stronger than to H2O. Energy decomposition analysis confirms that the orbital interaction is responsible for this opposite trend. The extended transition state&#8208;natural orbitals for chemical valence method shows that the &#960;&#8208;backdonation order is [B6X5]&#8722; &gt; [B10X9]&#8722; &gt; [B12X11]&#8722;. This predicted order explains the experimentally observed red shifts of the CO and N2 stretching fundamentals compared to those of the unbound molecules measured by infrared photodissociation spectroscopy. The strongest red shift is observed for [B6Cl5N2]&#8722;: 222 cm&#8208;1. Therefore, strong activation of unreactive &#963;&#8208;donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor molecules (commonly observed for cationic transition metal complexes) is achieved with metal&#8208;free molecular anions.</dc:description>

         <title>Formation and Growth of Atomic Scale Seeds of Au Nanoparticle in the Nanospace of an Organic Cage Molecule</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Seed&#8208;mediated growth has been widely used to synthesize noble metal nanoparticles with controlled size and shape. Although it is becoming possible to directly observe the nucleation process of metal atoms at the single atom level by using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), it is challenging to control the formation and growth of seeds with only a few metal atoms in homogeneous solution systems. Herein, we report site&#8208;selective formation and growth of atomic scale seeds of the Au nanoparticle in a nanospace of an organic cage molecule. We synthesized a cage molecule with amines and phenols, which were found to both capture and reduce Au(III) ions to spontaneously form the atomic scale seeds containing Au(0) in the nanospace. The growth reaction of the atomic scale seeds afforded Au nanoparticles with an average diameter of 2.0 &#177; 0.2 nm, which is in good agreement with the inner diameter of the cage molecule.</dc:description>

         <title>Single&#8208;Step Synthesis of NiI from NiII with H2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemists have long sought to regulate the reactivity of H2, to yield hydride ions, hydrogen atoms, or electrons on demand. One source of inspiration for achieving this control is [NiFe]hydrogenase ([NiFe]H2ase), which reacts with H2 to form various hydrogen active species such as NiIII hydride species, NiII hydride species, and NiI low&#8208;valent species. Chemists have attempted to synthesize these hydrogen active species not only as models for the active species of [NiFe]H2ase, but also as electron transfer catalysts. However, the synthesis of NiI complex directly from H2 has not been reported. This paper reports the first example of a single&#8208;step synthesis of a NiI complex, via reaction of a NiII complex with H2, stable for over 3 months at room temperature and we further demonstrate a reductive coupling of acridinium ions as part of a reaction cycle.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Fluorine&#8208;18 (18F) is the most favorable positron emitter for radiolabeling Positron Emission Tomography (PET) probes. However, conventional 18F labeling through covalent C&#8208;F bond formation is challenging, involving multiple steps and stringent conditions unsuitable for sensitive biomolecular probes whose integrity may be altered. Over the past decade, an elegant new approach has been developed involving the coordination of an aluminum fluoride {Al18F} species in aqueous media at a late&#8208;stage of the synthetic process. The objective of this study was to implement this method and to optimize radiolabeling efficiency using a Design of Experiments (DoE). To assess the impact of various experimental parameters on {Al18F} incorporation, a pentadentate chelating agent NODA&#8208;MP&#8208;C4 was prepared as a model compound. This model carried a thiourea function present in the final conjugates resulting from the grafting of the chelating agent onto the probe. The formation of the radioactive complex Al18F&#8208;NODA&#8208;MP&#8208;C4 was studied to achieve the highest radiochemical conversion. A complementary "cold" series study using the natural isotope 19F was also conducted to guide the radiochemical operating conditions. Ultimately, Al18F&#8208;NODA&#8208;MP&#8208;C4 was obtained with a reproducible and satisfactory radiochemical conversion of 79 &#177; 3.5% (n = 5).</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Bioluminescence of &#8216;V&#8217;&#8208;Shaped Firefly Luciferin Analogues Based on A Novel Benzobisthiazole Core.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The design of p&#8208;extended conjugation &#8216;V&#8216;&#8208;shaped red shifted bioluminescent D&#8208;luciferin analogues based on a novel benzobisthiazole core is described. The divergent synthetic route allowed access to a range of amine donor substituents through an SNAr reaction. In spectroscopic studies, the &#8216;V&#8216;&#8208;shaped luciferins exhibited narrower optical band gaps, more red&#8208;shifted absorption and emission spectra than D&#8208;luciferin. Their bioluminescence characteristics were recorded against four different luciferases (PpyLuc, FlucRed, CBR2 and PLR3). With native luciferase PpyLuc, the &#8216;V&#8216;&#8208;shaped luciferins demonstrated more red&#8208;shifted emissions than D&#8208;luciferin (&#955;bl = 561 nm) by 60 to 80 nm. In addition, the benzobisthiazole luciferins showed a wide range of bioluminescence spectra from the visible light region (&#955;bl = 500 nm) to the nIR window (&gt; 650 nm). The computational results validate the design concept which can be used as a guide for further novel D&#8208;luciferin analogues based upon other &#8216;V&#8216;&#8208;shaped heterocyclic cores.</dc:description>

         <title>Halogen Bonding in Brominated BODIPY Crystals: a Crystallographic and Computational Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The study of halogen bonds (XBs) has been a subject of great interest in recent years due to its clear application in catalysis, liquid crystals, and crystal engineering. In this study we analyzed the intermolecular interactions, in particular halogen bonds in BODIPYs with increasing number of bromine atoms. The computational study included analyses through three different methods: the first approach of close contacts provided by Mercury, then the expanded approach of the electron density partition of the molecules in the crystals provided by the analysis of Hirshfeld surfaces, and finally, the approach of the Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules (QT&#8208;AIM) to characterize the non&#8208;covalent interactions through finding electron density critical points between atoms and between neighboring molecules. The use of different computational methods allowed to gain insight on the interactions directing the crystal packing as the number of bromine atoms increase in the BODIPY moiety. Monocoordinated and bifurcated halogen bonds involving halide/halide were found. The penta&#8208;brominated BODIPY showed four&#8208;center cyclic nodes where each node is linked via XBs. This kind of motifs can be useful in supramolecular chemistry and self&#8208;assembly.</dc:description>

         <title>Charge transfer in Be&#8211;Ru compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>During the investigation of the binary system Be&#8211;Ru two new phases &#8208; Be7Ru4 and Be12Ru7 &#8208; with similar compositions (63.6 at. % Be and 63.2 at. % Be, respectively), are discovered. They both represent new structural prototypes. The phases are located between Be2Ru (Fe2P&#8208;type structure) and Be3Ru2 (U3Si2&#8208;type structure) in the phase diagram. This explains why their crystal structures, solved and refined from single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction data, are described as 2D intergrowth of Fe2P and U3Si2 motives. The calculated electronic density of stats (DOS) reveals pronounced minima in the vicinity of the Fermi level for both compounds. Position&#8208;space analysis of chemical bonding exhibits the formation of three&#8208; and four&#8208;atomic polar bonds, involving both, Ru and Be, atoms, and a strong charge transfer from Be to the more electronegative Ru.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbon nanostructures (CNSs) are attractive components to attain nanocomposites, yet their hydrophobic nature and strong tendency to aggregate often limit their use in aqueous conditions and negatively impact their properties. In this work, carbon nanohorns (CNHs), multi&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), and graphene (G) are first oxidized, and then reacted to covalently anchor the self&#8208;assembling tripeptide L&#8208;Leu&#8208;D&#8208;Phe&#8208;D&#8208;Phe to improve their dispersibility in phosphate buffer, and favor the formation of hydrogels formed by the self&#8208;organizing L&#8208;Leu&#8208;D&#8208;Phe&#8208;D&#8208;Phe present in solution. The obtained nanocomposites are then characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), oscillatory rheology, and conductivity measurements to gain useful insights as to the key factors that determine self&#8208;healing ability for the future design of this type of nanocomposites.</dc:description>

         <title>Intramolecular Electron Transfer in Multi&#8208;Redox Systems Based on Cyclic [3]Spirobifluorenylene Compound</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyclic [3]spirobifluorenylene with bulky alkyl groups at the ends (1) was designed and synthesized to investigate the electron transfer phenomena in a &#960;&#8208;conjugated system including orthogonal &#960;&#8208;conjugated chains. The three bifluorenyl units in 1 are conjugated to each other via spiro&#8208;conjugation, resulting in the splitting of the HOMO levels to a small extent. Therefore, the SOMO&#8211;HOMO gap of the radical cation species is small, which is considered to allow the facile intramolecular electron transfer. In the TD&#8208;DFT calculations for the radical cation species of 1, the geometry&#8208;featured interchain electronic transitions were visualized by NTO calculations. The radical cation species of 1 generated by chemical oxidation with SbCl5 exhibited a broadened and lower&#8208;energy shifted NIR absorption band compared to those of its partial structures. Considering the results of the TD&#8208;DFT calculations, the NIR band of the radical cation of 1 was attributed to the intramolecular electron transfer processes among the bifluorenyl units in the macrocycle. ESR experiments also indicated the delocalization of a spin of 1&#183;+ in the whole molecule via hole hopping in the ESR time scale at room temperature. This work demonstrates the usefulness of spiro&#8208;conjugation as a bridging unit in molecular wires to facilitate smooth electron transfer.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Photolyses of trans&#8208;Fe(CO)3(P((CH2)n)3P) (n = 10 (a), 12 (b), 14 (c), 16 (d), 18 (e)) in the presence of PMe3&#160;provide the first economical and scalable route to macrobicyclic dibridgehead diphosphines P((CH2)n)3P (1). These are isolated as mixtures of in,in/out,out isomers that equilib&#173;rate with degenerate in,out/out,in isomers at 150 &#176;C via pyramidal inversion at phosphorus. For the entire series, VT 31P NMR data establish or bound Keq, rates, and activation parameters for a variety of phenomena, many of which involve homeomorphic isomerizations, topological process&#173;es by which certain molecules can turn themselves inside out (e.g., in,in &#8652; out,out). This provides the first detailed mapping of such trends in homologous series of aliphatic bicyclic compounds XE((CH2)n)3EX with any type of bridgehead. Isomeric diborane adducts 1a,d&#183;2BH3&#160;are also char&#173;acterized. Crystal structures of out,out&#8208;1a and in,in&#8208;1a&#183;2BH3&#160;aid isomer assignments and reveal unusual cage conformations.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Electrophilic Intermediates in the Bypass Mechanism of Glutathione Peroxidase: Synthesis, Reactivity, and Structures of Selenocysteine&#8208;Derived Cyclic Selenenyl Amides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Selenocysteine (Sec)&#8208;derived cyclic selenenyl amides, formed by the intramolecular cyclization of Sec selenenic acids (Sec&#8211;SeOHs), have been postulated to function as protective forms in the bypass mechanism of glutathione peroxidase (GPx). However, their chemical properties have not been experimentally elucidated in proteins or small&#8208;molecule systems. Recently, we reported the first nuclear magnetic resonance observation of Sec&#8211;SeOHs and their cyclization to the corresponding cyclic selenenyl amides using selenopeptide model systems incorporated in a molecular cradle. Herein, we elucidate the structures and reactivities of Sec&#8208;derived cyclic selenenyl amides. The crystal structures and reactions toward a cysteine thiol or a 1,3&#8208;diketone&#8208;type chemical probe indicated the highly electrophilic character of cyclic selenenyl amides. This suggests that they can serve not only as protective forms to suppress the&#160;inactivation&#160;of Sec&#8211;SeOHs in GPx&#160;but also&#160;as highly electrophilic intermediates in the reactions of selenoproteins.</dc:description>

         <title>DNA Chimeras as Electrochemical Biosensors for Host&#8208;Guest Measurements in Blood</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Few sensing platforms have become ubiquitous to enable rapid and convenient measurements at the point&#8208;of&#8208;care. Those, however, are &#8220;one&#8208;off&#8221; technologies, meaning that they can only detect a single target and are hardly adaptable. In response, we plan to develop a sensing platform that can be extended to detect other classes of molecules and that affords rapid, convenient, continuous measurements directly in undiluted complex matrices. For this, we decided to rely on a host molecule that presents reversible interactions toward specific guest molecules to develop a new class of sensors that we coined &#8220;Electrochemical DNA&#8208;host chimeras&#8221;. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept for our sensor, we decided to use cyclobis(paraquat&#8208;p&#8208;phenylene) (&#8220;blue box&#8221;) that we attached on an electrode&#8208;bound DNA to allow measurements of electron&#8208;rich guests such as dopamine and aspirin. Doing so allows to promote host&#8208;guest complex that could be quantified using blue box&#8217;s electrochemistry. Because of this unique sensor architecture, we achieve, to our knowledge, the first reagentless, continuous and rapid (&lt; 5 min) host&#8208;guest measurements in undiluted whole blood. We envision that given the library of electroactive host molecules that this will allow the development of a sensing platform for measurements of several classes of molecules in complex matrices at the point&#8208;of&#8208;care.</dc:description>

         <title>Control and transferability of magnetic interactions in supramolecular structures: trimers of {Cr7Ni}&#160;antiferromagnetic rings.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We demonstrate here a synthetic strategy to prepare two distinct trimers of antiferromagnetically coupled {Cr7Ni} rings, substantially varying the magnetic interactions between the spin centres. The interactions were studied using multi&#8208;frequency cw EPR: in a trimer linked via non&#8208;covalent H&#8208;bonding interactions no measurable interaction between rings was seen, while in a trimer linked via iso&#8208;nicotinate groups isotropic and anisotropic exchange interactions of +0.42 and &#8208;0.8 GHz, respectively, were observed. The latter are the same as those for a simpler hetero&#8208;dimer system, showing how the spin&#8208;spin interactions can be built in a predictable and modular manner in these systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Regiodivergent C&#8208;H Olefination of Imidazo[1,2a]Pyridine Carboxamide and Unactivated Alkenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite remarkable successes in linear and branched vinyl (hetero) arene synthesis, regiodivergent C&#8208;H olefination with a single catalytic system has remained underdeveloped. Overcoming this limitation, herein, we report Pd/MPAA mediated regiodivergent olefination protocol of imidazo[1,2a] pyridine carboxamide and unactivated alkenes to generate branched and linear olefinated products depending upon the electronic nature of alkenes. Moreover, this protocol can be applied for C&#8208;H deuteriation of the corresponding heteroarenes with D2O as deuterium source. Preliminary experimental studies combined with computational investigations (DFT studies) suggest that regiodivergent olefination can be controlled by olefin insertion and b&#8208;hydride elimination steps.</dc:description>

         <title>Modern Potentiometric Biosensing Based on Non&#8208;equilibrium Measurement Techniques</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Modern potentiometric sensors based on polymeric membrane ion&#8208;selective electrodes (ISEs) have achieved new breakthroughs in sensitivity, selectivity, and stability and extended applications in environmental surveillance, medical diagnostics, and industrial analysis. Moreover, nonclassical potentiometry shows promise for many applications and opens up new opportunities for potentiometric biosensing. Here, we aim to provide a concept to summarize advances over the past decade in the development of potentiometric biosensors with polymeric membrane ISEs. This concept articulates sensing mechanisms based on non&#8208;equilibrium measurement techniques. In particular, we emphasize new trends in potentiometric biosensing based on attractive dynamic approaches. Representative examples are selected to illustrate key applications under zero&#8208;current conditions and stimulus&#8208;controlled modes. More importantly, fruitful information obtained from non&#8208;equilibrium measurements with dynamic responses can be useful for artificial intelligence (AI). The combination of ISEs with advanced AI techniques for effective data processing is also discussed. We hope that the concept will illustrate the great possibilities offered by non&#8208;equilibrium measurement techniques and AI in potentiometric biosensing and encourage further innovations in this exciting field.</dc:description>

         <title>Harnessing the Peterson Reaction for the Stereospecific Synthesis of Z&#8208;Vinyl Ethers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Vinyl ethers are valuable synthetic intermediates which are also found as natural products, including aflatoxins, rifamycins and plasmalogens. The latter are ubiquitous phospholipids in human cells and contain a vinyl ether moiety with specifically Z configuration. Although numerous methods are available for synthesis of vinyl ethers, there is a lack of methods for obtaining Z isomers of molecules of the type RCH=CHOR&#8217; that are applicable to plasmalogens. A variant of the Peterson reaction is described that generates such molecules with very high stereoselectivity (Z/E ratio: 99:1). (R,R)/(S,S)&#8208;1&#8208;alkoxy&#8208;2&#8208;hydroxyalkylsilanes were synthesised from 1&#8208;trimethylsilylalkynes by a sequence of reduction with di&#8208;isobutylaluminium hydride to a (Z)&#8208;1&#8208;trimethylsilylalkene, epoxidation of the alkene to a 2&#8208;trimethylsilyl&#8208;3&#8208;substituted epoxide and regioselective, boron&#8208;trifluoride catalysed ring opening of the epoxide by reaction with an alcohol. Conversion of the (R,R)/(S,S)&#8208;1&#8208;alkoxy&#8208;2&#8208;hydroxyalkylsilanes to vinyl ethers (RCH=CHOR&#8217;) was achieved under basic conditions as in a standard Peterson reaction. However, near exclusive formation of a Z vinyl ether was only achieved when the reaction was performed using potassium hydride in the non&#8208;polar solvent &#945;,&#945;,&#945;&#8208;trifluorotoluene, more polar solvents giving increasing amounts of the E isomer. The sequence described embraces a variety of substituents and precursors, proceeds in overall high yield and is readily scaleable.</dc:description>

         <title>A Guanidine&#8208;Supported &#960;&#8208;Complex of Germanium Amenable to Intramolecular C&#8208;C Cleavage in Arene and Ge Atom Transfer</title>

         <dc:description>The germylone dimNHCGe (dimNHC = diimino N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene) reacts with azides N3R (R = SiMe3 or p&#8208;tolyl) to furnish the first examples of germanium &#960;&#8208;complexes, i.e. guanidine&#8208;ligated compounds (dimNHI&#8208;SiMe3)Ge (NHI= N&#8208;heterocyclic imine, R= SiMe3) and (dimNHI&#8208;Tol)Ge (R= p&#8208;tolyl). DFT calculations suggest that these species are formed by a Staudinger type replacement of dinitrogen in the azide by a nucleophilic germylone, leading to a transient carbene adduct of iminogermylidene. Heating a solution of compound (dimNHI&#8208;SiMe3)Ge to 70 &#176;C results in extrusion of the iminogermylidene that further aggregates to produce the known [Me3SiNGe]4 tetramer, whereas the imidazolylidene fragment transforms into an unusual heptatriene species that can be considered as a product of carbene insertion into the C&#8208;C bond of a pendant Ar substituent at the imidazolylidene nitrogen of the dimNHC. Reaction of (dimNHI&#8208;SiMe3)Ge with tetrachloro&#8208;o&#8208;benzoquinone results in the net transfer of a germanium atom and formation of the free diimino&#8208;guanidine ligand. This ligand also forms when (dimNHI&#8208;SiMe3)Ge is treated with azide N3(p&#8208;Tol), with the germanium product being [(p&#8208;Tol)NGe]n.</dc:description>

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Electrocatalyzed Synthesis of Bifuran&#8208;Based Monomers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bifuran motifs can be accessed with nickel&#8208;bipyridine electrocatalyzed homocouplings of bromine&#8208;substituted methyl furancarboxylates, which, in turn, can be prepared from hemicellulose&#8208;derived furfural. The described protocol uses sustainable carbon&#8208;based graphite electrodes in the simplest setup &#8211; an undivided cell with constant current electrolysis. The reported method avoids using a sacrificial anode by employing triethanolamine as an electron donor.</dc:description>
