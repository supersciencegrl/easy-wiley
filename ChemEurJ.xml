         <dc:description>Development efficient strategy for fabrication of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) metal organic framework (MOF) nanosheets with high yield and high stability is desirable. Herein, we demonstrate for the first time that large&#8208;size and single&#8208;layer 2D Ni&#8208;BDC MOF nanosheets have been fabricated with the assistance of supercritical carbon dioxide (SC CO2 ) in pure aqueous system. Detailed experimental evidences reveal that the SC CO2 molecule can exchange with the lattice coordinated H2O molecules and side&#8208;on coordinate with the metal Ni1 sites on nickel&#8208;benzene dicarboxylate (Ni&#8208;BDC) surface, and finally break the interlayer hydrogen bond to exfoliate the bulk Ni&#8208;BDC into 2D MOF. More importantly, a thin SC CO2 layer building at the water&#8208;Ni&#8208;BDC interfaces can transform the pristine hydrophilic interface to super&#8208;hydrophobic one. The formed super&#8208;hydrophobic layer at the water&#8211;MOF interface can effectively prevent the dissociation reaction, thus promoting the stability of Ni&#8208;BDC in aqueous system.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of metal chalcogenide semiconductors by thermal decomposition of organosulfur and organoselenium compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal chalcogenides &#8211; because of their excellent optical and electrical properties &#8211; are important semiconductor materials for optical devices, such as solar cells, sensors, and photocatalysts. The challenges associated with metal chalcogenides are the complexity of the conventional synthesis methods and the stringent synthesis conditions. In this study, we simplified the synthesis conditions using a solvent&#8208;free synthesis method using cadmium precursor, thiourea and selenium to synthesize metal chalcogenides, such as CdS and CdSe, which have particularly suitable band gaps for the optical devices. CdS  x  Se  1&#8208;x  solid solution was successfully synthesized under molten thiourea as the reactive reaction medium at relatively low temperatures, even at 180&#176;C, with residual melamine derivatives in the solid phase. The luminescence properties of CdS  x  Se  1&#8208;x  and the products in the gas and solid phases were investigated. Optimization of the synthesis conditions for solid solutions of CdS  x  Se  1&#8208;x  and the role of organic compounds in the formation of metal chalcogenides are discussed.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Rhodium&#8208;catalyzed acrylate synthesis from carbon dioxide&#160;and ethylene was accomplished by using a guanidine&#8208;based NCN pincer ligand. The repulsion between p&#960;&#8208;electron of guanidine sidearms and occupied d&#960; orbital of rhodium center raised the level of d&#8208;electrons close to those of formerly known d8&#8208;ruthenium catalyst, thereby promoting the metallalactone formation from carbon dioxide and ethylene. This work fills the absence of group&#8208;9 metal based catalyst for the acrylate synthesis and provides a designing approach for pincer&#8208;ligated d8&#8208;metal catalysts to utilize p&#960;&#8208;d&#960; interaction for promoting desirable redox processes.</dc:description>

         <title>A Macrocyclic Furan with Accessible Oxidation States: Switching Between Aromatic and Antiaromatic Global Ring Currents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Macrocyclic furans are predicted to switch between global aromaticity and antiaromaticity, depending on their oxidation states. However, the macrocyclic furans reported to date are stabilized by electron withdrawing groups, which result in inaccessible oxidation states. To circumvent this problem, a post&#8208;macrocyclization approach was applied to introduce methylene&#8208;substituted macrocyclic furans, which display an extremely low oxidation potential of &#8208;0.23  vs  . Fc/Fc  +  , and are partially oxidized in ambient conditions. Additional oxidation to the dication results in aromaticity switching to a global 30&#960;e  &#8208;  aromatic state, as indicated by the formation of a strong diatropic current observed in the  1  H&#8208;NMR spectrum. NICS and ACID calculations support this trend and provide evidence for a different pathway for the global current in the neutral and dicationic states. According to these findings, macrocyclic furans can be rendered as promising  p  &#8208;type materials with stable oxidation states.</dc:description>

         <title>Quantification of the Electrophilicities of Diazoalkanes: Kinetics and Mechanism of Azo Couplings with Enamines and Sulfonium Ylides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enamines and sulfonium ylides attack the terminal nitrogen of diazoalkanes with rate&#8208;determining formation of zwitterions. The measured second&#8208;order rate constants were used to determine the one&#8208;bond electrophilicities E of the diazoalkanes. Pyrazolines obtained from the reactions of diazoalkanes with enamines are not formed by 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloadditions, but by cyclization of hydrazonoenamines initially formed by proton shifts in the intermediate zwitterions.







Abstract
Kinetics and mechanism of the reactions of methyl diazoacetate, dimethyl diazomalonate, 4&#8208;nitrophenyldiazomethane, and diphenyldiazomethane with sulfonium ylides and enamines were investigated by UV&#8208;Vis and NMR spectroscopy. Ordinary alkenes undergo 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloadditions with these diazo compounds. In contrast, sulfonium ylides and enamines attack at the terminal nitrogen of the diazo alkanes to give zwitterions, which undergo various subsequent reactions. As only one new bond is formed in the rate&#8208;determining step of these reactions, the correlation lg&#8201;k2(20&#8201;&#176;C)=sN(N+E) could be used to determine the one&#8208;bond electrophilicities E of the diazo compounds from the measured second&#8208;order rate constants and the known reactivity indices N and sN of the sulfonium ylides and enamines. The resulting electrophilicity parameters (&#8722;21&lt;E&lt;&#8722;18), which are 11&#8211;14 orders of magnitude smaller than that of the benzenediazonium ion, are used to define the scope of one&#8208;bond nucleophiles which may react with these diazoalkanes.

         <title>Between Two Chairs: Combination of Theory and Experiment for the Determination of the Conformational Dynamics of Xylosides</title>

The combination of experimental and computed data allows to disentangle and quantify complex dynamic conformational mixtures of xylosides. Computed spin&#8208;spin coupling constants bridge the gap between experimental NMR data and the conformer distribution.







Abstract
The conformational properties of monosaccharides constitute fundamental features of oligosaccharides. While the energy landscape of monosaccharides can be altered by a specific biochemical environment or by chemical modifications, the analysis of resulting dynamic conformational equilibria is not feasible by experimental means alone. In this work, a series of &#946;&#8208;d&#8208;xylopyranosides is used to outline how a combination of experimental NMR parameters and computed molecular properties can be used to determine conformers and quantify the composition of conformational equilibria. We demonstrate that identifying the most stable conformers using energy calculations is challenging and computing of NMR shieldings is typically not sensitive enough. On the other hand, computed spin&#8208;spin coupling constants for the xyloside ring can be used to unambiguously assign experimental NMR data of dynamic conformational equilibria and quantify the ratio of different conformers in the mixture. As a proof of principle, this procedure allowed to analyze a hitherto unknown dynamic equilibrium of a diamino&#8208;xyloside as a precursor of a molecular switch.

         <title>Cost&#8208;Effective 2D Ultrathin Metal&#8208;Organic Layers with Bis&#8208;Metallic Catalytic Sites for Visible Light&#8208;Driven Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work 2D ultrathin metal&#8208;organic layers (MOLs) with bis&#8208;metallic catalytic sites were developed to negate the blemish of low&#8208;density catalytic sites and low electron transmission efficiency on the surface of 3D MOFs, thus resulting in efficient and selective visible light&#8208;driven CO2 reduction by earth&#8208;abundant metal catalysis.







Abstract
As novel generated 2D materials, metal&#8208;organic layers (MOLs) have recently emerged as a potential platform for photocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (PCO2RR). Such 2D structures negate the blemish of low&#8208;density catalytic sites and low electron transmission efficiency on the surface of metal organic frameworks (MOFs), while retaining the advantage of low expenditure when using earth&#8208;abundant metal nodes and meritorious applicability in the PCO2RR. Herein, it is reported that the 2D ultrathin layer material with bis&#8208;metallic catalytic sites (Ni&#8722;O metal node and the Ni&#8722;N metal site) from bidentate ligand 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine&#8208;5,5&#8217;&#8208;dicarboxylate (H2bpydc) and nickel(II) remarkably boosts the visible light&#8208;driven PCO2RR performance with a CO yield of 2400&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1 for 18&#8197;h and a selectivity up to 99&#8201;%. Consequently, the effects of morphology, catalytic sites and intrinsic properties on PCO2RR efficiency have been investigated in detail. In this context, the ultrathin layer structure has been elucidated as the key point to facilitate electron transfer efficiency. Notably, the bis&#8208;metallic catalytic sites with reasonable distance between two adjacent metals presumably induce synergistic effect and offer a guiding ideology for further designing high performance photocatalysts.

         <title>Acene Size&#8208;Dependent Transition of The Radical Centers From the Metal to The Acene Parts In Monocationic Dinuclear (Diethynylacene)diyl Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Charge&#8208;delocalization of various monocationic diruthenium (p&#8208;diethynylacene)diyl complexes was investigated. The distribution of the radical centers is dependent on the acene moieties; namely, the radical centers are shifted from the metal moiety (benzene) to the bridging dinuclear part (anthracene) and then to the acene part (pentacene).







Abstract
Controlling radical localization/delocalization is important for functional materials. The present paper describes synthesis and results of electrochemical, spectroscopic, and theoretical studies of diruthenium (p&#8208;diethynylacene)diyl complexes, Me3Si&#8208;(C&#8801;C)2&#8208;Ru(dppe)2&#8208;C&#8801;C&#8722;Ar&#8208;C&#8801;C&#8722;Ru(dppe)2&#8208;(C&#8801;C)2&#8208;SiMe3 (1&#8211;6) (dppe: 1,2&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)ethane), and their monocationic radical species ([1]+&#8211;[6]+). The HOMO&#8208;LUMO energy gaps can be finely tuned by the acene rings in the bridging ligands installed, as indicated by the absorption maxima of the electronic spectra of 1&#8211;6 ranging from the UV region even to the NIR region. The cationic species [1]+&#8211;[6]+ show two characteristic NIR bands, which are ascribed to the charge resonance (CR) and &#960;&#8208;&#960;* transition bands, as revealed by spectroelectrochemistry. Expansion of the acene rings in [1]+&#8211;[6]+ causes (1) blue shifts of the CR bands and red shifts of the &#960;&#8208;&#960;* transition bands and (2) charge localization on the acene parts as evidenced by the ESR, DFT and TD&#8208;DFT analyses. Notably, the monocationic complexes of the larger acene derivatives are characterized as the non&#8208;classical acene&#8208;localized radicals.

         <title>Opening of the Diamondoid Cage upon Ionization Probed by Infrared Spectra of the Amantadine Cation Solvated by Ar, N2, and H2O</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 44, August 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cage&#8208;opening upon ionization: Three isomers of Ama+ (1&#8208;aminoadamantane) are identified by IR spectroscopy &#8208; the cage isomer (I) generated by vertical ionization and separated by substantial barriers from two bicyclic distonic iminium ions generated by cage opening (primary radical II) and subsequent 1,2 H shift (tertiary radical III). The potential energy profile for this reaction depends strongly on solvation and H&#8594;NH2 substitution.







Abstract
Radical cations of diamondoids, a fundamental class of very stable cyclic hydrocarbon molecules, play an important role in their functionalization reactions and the chemistry of the interstellar medium. Herein, we characterize the structure, energy, and intermolecular interaction of clusters of the amantadine radical cation (Ama+, 1&#8208;aminoadamantane) with solvent molecules of different interaction strength by infrared photodissociation (IRPD) spectroscopy of mass&#8208;selected Ama+Ln clusters, with L=Ar (n&#8804;3) and L=N2 and H2O (n=1), and dispersion&#8208;corrected density functional theory calculations (B3LYP&#8722;D3/cc&#8208;pVTZ). Three isomers of Ama+ generated by electron ionization are identified by the vibrational properties of their rather different NH2 groups. The ligands bind preferentially to the acidic NH2 protons, and the strength of the NH&#8230;L ionic H&#8208;bonds are probed by the solvation&#8208;induced red&#8208;shifts in the NH stretch modes. The three Ama+ isomers include the most abundant canonical cage isomer (I) produced by vertical ionization, which is separated by appreciable barriers from two bicyclic distonic iminium ions obtained from cage&#8208;opening (primary radical II) and subsequent 1,2 H&#8208;shift (tertiary radical III), the latter of which is the global minimum on the Ama+ potential energy surface. The effect of solvation on the energetics of the potential energy profile revealed by the calculations is consistent with the observed relative abundance of the three isomers. Comparison to the adamantane cation indicates that substitution of H by the electron&#8208;donating NH2 group substantially lowers the barriers for the isomerization reaction.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cage-opening upon ionization&lt;/b&gt;: Three isomers of Ama&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (1-aminoadamantane) are identified by IR spectroscopy - the cage isomer (&lt;b&gt;I&lt;/b&gt;) generated by vertical ionization and separated by substantial barriers from two bicyclic distonic iminium ions generated by cage opening (primary radical &lt;b&gt;II&lt;/b&gt;) and subsequent 1,2 H shift (tertiary radical &lt;b&gt;III&lt;/b&gt;). The potential energy profile for this reaction depends strongly on solvation and H&#8594;NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; substitution.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Radical cations of diamondoids, a fundamental class of very stable cyclic hydrocarbon molecules, play an important role in their functionalization reactions and the chemistry of the interstellar medium. Herein, we characterize the structure, energy, and intermolecular interaction of clusters of the amantadine radical cation (Ama&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, 1-aminoadamantane) with solvent molecules of different interaction strength by infrared photodissociation (IRPD) spectroscopy of mass-selected Ama&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;L&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; clusters, with L=Ar (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;&#8804;3) and L=N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;=1), and dispersion-corrected density functional theory calculations (B3LYP&#8722;D3/cc-pVTZ). Three isomers of Ama&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; generated by electron ionization are identified by the vibrational properties of their rather different NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; groups. The ligands bind preferentially to the acidic NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; protons, and the strength of the NH&#8230;L ionic H-bonds are probed by the solvation-induced red-shifts in the NH stretch modes. The three Ama&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; isomers include the most abundant canonical cage isomer (&lt;b&gt;I&lt;/b&gt;) produced by vertical ionization, which is separated by appreciable barriers from two bicyclic distonic iminium ions obtained from cage-opening (primary radical &lt;b&gt;II&lt;/b&gt;) and subsequent 1,2 H-shift (tertiary radical &lt;b&gt;III&lt;/b&gt;), the latter of which is the global minimum on the Ama&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; potential energy surface. The effect of solvation on the energetics of the potential energy profile revealed by the calculations is consistent with the observed relative abundance of the three isomers. Comparison to the adamantane cation indicates that substitution of H by the electron-donating NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; group substantially lowers the barriers for the isomerization reaction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Color&#8208;Tunable Multifunctional Excited&#8208;State Intramolecular Proton Transfer Emitter: Stimulated Emission of a Single Dye</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 44, August 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single 2&#8208;(2&#8217;&#8208;hydroxyphenyl)benzothiazole derivative is capable of precisely tunable triple&#8208;emission, covering the whole visible spectrum (red&#8208;green&#8208;blue). Excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) phenomenon was utilized to fabricate multifunctional active material for lasing action both in solutions and in thin polymeric films. For the first time, light amplification in deprotonated ESIPT species was observed, enabling real&#8208;time shifting of the stimulated emission by almost 100&#8197;nm (from orange to green).







Abstract
The excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer chromophores were regarded as good materials for laser action generation due to their inherent four&#8208;level photocycle. The excitation&#8208;dependent properties of these compounds enable light amplification from two distinct forms: both enol and keto, making it possible to obtain dual fluorescence emission. Herein, we report that a third option is possible for the first time stimulated emission was realized with a deprotonated ESIPT molecule based on a novel rigidified 2&#8208;(2&#8217;&#8208;hydroxyphenyl)benzothiazole derivative, triggering the possibility to fabricate real&#8208;time tunable active material. Through the rational engineering of the ratio of each emissive species, a red&#8208;green&#8208;blue device was fabricated with the possibility of white light generation. The degenerated two&#8208;wave mixing setup was applied to construct a continuously tunable distributed feedback laser.

         <title>Chemically Laminated 2D Bis(terpyridine)metal Polymer Films: Formation Mechanism at the Liquid&#8211;Liquid Interface and Redox Rectification</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 44, August 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Redox rectifiers: Heterolaminated 2D coordination polymer films were synthesized at a liquid&#8208;liquid interface, and the mechanism of film growth was revealed. The bilayer films show unique redox behavior based on the electron transfer mediation in an electrolyte solution and stable rectification characteristics when the film is sandwiched by electrodes in a dry state.







Abstract
Recent studies on molecular 2D materials with high tunability of structure and function have focused mostly on the discovery of new precursors. Here, we demonstrate a facile one&#8208;pot synthesis of laminated 2D coordination polymer films comprising bis(terpyridine)iron and cobalt at a water/dichloromethane interface. Cross&#8208;sectional elemental mapping unveiled the stratum&#8208;like structure of the film and revealed that the second layer grows to the dichloromethane side below the first layer. Cyclic voltammetry clarified that the bottom layer mediates charge transfer between the top layer and the substrate in a narrow potential region of mixed&#8208;valence states. Furthermore, the bilayer film sandwiched by electrodes in a dry condition shows stable rectification character, and the barrier voltage corresponds to the redox potential difference between the two layers. This study introduces a new strategy for polymer design to explore the materials science of molecular 2D materials.

Two bichromophoric difluoroboron &#946;&#8208;diketonates (DFBs) with different connections to a chiral cyclohexanediamine bridge display inversion of chirality. When using different solvent systems, para Cy&#8208;DFB shows self&#8208;assembly in spherical aggregates with enhanced chiroptical properties as compared with solution state. Ultrasonication and heating induces the formation of supramolecular assembled nanowires with higher g value of 0.015.







Abstract
We synthesized two bichromophoric difluoroboron&#8208;&#946;&#8208;diketonates (DFB) connected in para and meta positions by using cyclohexane diamine as a chiral bridge (para and meta (R/S)&#8208;CyDFB). TD&#8208;DFT calculations revealed that the variation in connectivity of the DFB units leads to different spatial arrangements and a chirality inversion of the bichromophoric DFB. Higher gabs values were obtained in (R/S)&#8208;CyDFB connected in para as compared to meta position. Aggregation of para (R/S)&#8208;CyDFB in mixture of solvents increase the glum values as compared to its monomeric form. Ultrasonication and heating induced the formation of highly ordered nano&#8208;helical wires of para (R/S)&#8208;CyDFB that increased the glum values to 0.015. On the other hand, meta (R/S)&#8208;CyDFB failed to form highly ordered self&#8208;assembled wires due to hindered H&#8208;binding sites. These observations indicate that the chiroptical properties of DFB bi&#8208;chromophore system can be modulated with self&#8208;assembly and spatial arrangement of the chromophores.

         <dc:description>
A general copper&#8208;catalyzed carbonylative cross&#8208;coupling between amines and alkyl iodides based on a simple combination of catalytic CuCl and PMDETA in the presence of NaOH is reported. Primary, secondary and tertiary alkyl iodides and primary, cyclic and acyclic secondary amines as well as anilines were all shown to be suitable reaction partners, affording the corresponding amides in good to excellent yields. Mechanistic studies demonstrated that a radical pathway is operative and the key role of carbon monoxide.







Abstract
A general copper&#8208;catalyzed carbonylative cross&#8208;coupling between amines and alkyl iodides is reported. Using a simple combination of catalytic amounts of copper(I) chloride and N,N,N&#8217;,N&#8221;,N&#8221;&#8208;pentamethyldiethylenetriamine in the presence of sodium hydroxide under carbon monoxide pressure, a broad range of alkyl iodides and amines can be efficiently coupled to the corresponding amides that are obtained in good to excellent yields. Notable features of this process &#8211; the first one relying on a base metal catalyst &#8211; include the availability and low cost of the catalytic system, its successful use with primary, secondary, tertiary alkyl iodides and all classes of amines &#8211; with no or limited competing nucleophilic substitution without CO incorporation &#8211; as well as its efficiency with complex alkyl iodides and amines. Mechanistic studies demonstrated that a radical pathway is operative and the key role of CO.

Mechanistic studies demonstrated that a radical pathway is operative and the key role of CO.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Detergent Expansion Strategy for Membrane Protein Studies</title>

T&#8208;PADs for membrane proteins: A library of 1,2,3&#8208;triazole preassembled detergents (T&#8208;PADs) was constructed two&#8208;dimensionally by click chemistry, exhibiting high diversity with systematic tuning of properties for accommodating distinct membrane proteins. High throughput screening of this detergent library was carried out to explore best matches between detergents and membrane proteins. Among them, structurally unique and unprecedented detergents 14M8G and 14M9G were identified for the EM and NMR study of individual membrane proteins, respectively.







Abstract
Detergents are the most frequently applied reagents in membrane protein (MP) studies. The limited diversity of one&#8208;head&#8208;one&#8208;tailed traditional detergents, however, is far from sufficient for structurally distinct MPs. Expansion of detergent repertoire has a continuous momentum. In line with the speculation that detergent pre&#8208;assembly exerts superiority, herein we report for the first time cross&#8208;conjugation of two series of monomeric detergents for constructing a two&#8208;dimensional library of dimeric detergents. Optimum detergents stood out with unique preferences in the systematic evaluation of individual MPs. Furthermore, unprecedented hybrid detergents 14M8G and 14M9G enabled high&#8208;quality EM study of transporter MsbA and NMR study of G protein&#8208;coupled receptor A2AAR, respectively. Given the abundance of cross&#8208;coupling chemistries, comprehensive diversity could be readily covered that would facilitate the finding of new detergents for the manipulation of thorny MPs and innovation of the functional and structural study in future.

         <title>The Use of Bridging Ligand Substituents to Bias the Population of Localized and Delocalized Mixed&#8208;Valence Conformers in Solution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 44, August 4, 2022. </description>

Mixed&#8208;valence complexes [{Cp*(dppe)Ru}(&#956;&#8208;C&#8801;CArC&#8801;C){Ru(dppe)Cp*]+ are known to exist as a mixture of conformations, with electronic character varying between the localized and delocalized limits in response to the particular mutual orientations of the metal and bridge fragments. Electronic structure calculations using the hybrid density functional BLYP35&#8208;D3 and a continuum solvent model in combination with spectroelectrochemical studies have demonstrated that the conformational population, and hence the dominant electronic structure, can be biased through the steric and electronic properties of the diethynylarylene (Ar) moiety.







Abstract
The electronic structure and associated spectroscopic properties of ligand&#8208;bridged, bimetallic &#8216;mixed&#8208;valence&#8217; complexes of the general form {M}(&#956;&#8208;B){M+} are dictated by the electronic couplings, and hence orbital overlaps, between the metal centers mediated by the bridge. In the case of complexes such as [{Cp*(dppe)Ru}(&#956;&#8208;C&#8801;CC6H4C&#8801;C){Ru(dppe)Cp*}]+, the low barrier to rotation of the half&#8208;sandwich metal fragments and the arylene bridge around the acetylene moieties results in population of many energy minima across the conformational energy landscape. Since orbital overlap is also sensitive to the particular mutual orientations of the metal fragment(s) and arylene bridge through a Karplus&#8208;like relationship, the different members of the population range exemplify electronic structures ranging from strongly localized (weakly coupled Robin&#8208;Day Class II) to completely delocalized (Robin&#8208;Day Class III). Here, we use electronic structure calculations with the hybrid density functional BLYP35&#8208;D3 and a continuum solvent model in combination with UV&#8208;vis&#8208;NIR and IR spectroelectrochemical studies to show that the conformational population in complexes [{Cp*(dppe)Ru}(&#956;&#8208;C&#8801;CArC&#8801;C){Ru(dppe)Cp*]+, and hence the dominant electronic structure, can be biased through the steric and electronic properties of the diethynylarylene (Ar) moiety (Ar=1,4&#8208;C6H4, 1,4&#8208;C6F4, 1,4&#8208;C6H2&#8208;2,5&#8208;Me2, 1,4&#8208;C6H2&#8208;2,5&#8208;(CF3)2, 1,4&#8208;C6H2&#8208;2,5&#8208;iPr2).

         <title>Dihydroxy&#8208;Acid Dehydratases From Pathogenic Bacteria: Emerging Drug Targets to Combat Antibiotic Resistance</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 44, August 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The FeS cluster&#8208;dependent dihydroxy&#8208;acid dehydratases (DHADs) from Staphylococcus aureus and Campylobacter jejuni (SaDHAD and CjDHAD) are emerging targets for biocides. They are virtually inactive after extraction, but a functional [4Fe&#8722;4S] cluster can be reconstituted in vitro boosting the activity up to &#8764;19,000&#8208;fold.







Abstract
There is an urgent global need for the development of novel therapeutics to combat the rise of various antibiotic&#8208;resistant superbugs. Enzymes of the branched&#8208;chain amino acid (BCAA) biosynthesis pathway are an attractive target for novel anti&#8208;microbial drug development. Dihydroxy&#8208;acid dehydratase (DHAD) is the third enzyme in the BCAA biosynthesis pathway. It relies on an Fe&#8722;S cluster for catalytic activity and has recently also gained attention as a catalyst in cell&#8208;free enzyme cascades. Two types of Fe&#8722;S clusters have been identified in DHADs, i.e. [2Fe&#8722;2S] and [4Fe&#8722;4S], with the latter being more prone to degradation in the presence of oxygen. Here, we characterise two DHADs from bacterial human pathogens, Staphylococcus aureus and Campylobacter jejuni (SaDHAD and CjDHAD). Purified SaDHAD and CjDHAD are virtually inactive, but activity could be reversibly reconstituted in vitro (up to &#8764;19,000&#8208;fold increase with kcat as high as &#8764;6.7&#8197;s&#8722;1). Inductively&#8208;coupled plasma&#8208;optical emission spectroscopy (ICP&#8208;OES) measurements are consistent with the presence of [4Fe&#8722;4S] clusters in both enzymes. N&#8208;isopropyloxalyl hydroxamate (IpOHA) and aspterric acid are both potent inhibitors for both SaDHAD (Ki=7.8 and 51.6&#8197;&#956;M, respectively) and CjDHAD (Ki=32.9 and 35.1&#8197;&#956;M, respectively). These compounds thus present suitable starting points for the development of novel anti&#8208;microbial chemotherapeutics.

         <title>Reductive Elimination at Pb(II) Center of an (Amino)plumbylene&#8208;Substituted Phosphaketene: New Pathway for Phosphinidene Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 44, August 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stable (amino)plumbylene&#8208;substituted phosphaketene was synthesized by the successive reactions of PbCl2 with two anionic reagents (lithium amidophosphine and NaPCO). Of particular interest, its thermal evolution, initiated at 80&#8201;&#176;C, starts with reductive elimination at the PbII center to form a new N&#8722;P bond and leads to the generation of a transient (amino)phosphaketene, which is the precursor of a new cyclic (amino)phosphanylidene phosphorane. This result provides a new synthetic route to phosphinidenes, extending and facilitating further their access.







Abstract
A stable (amino)plumbylene&#8208;substituted phosphaketene 3 was synthesized by the successive reactions of PbCl2 with two anionic reagents (lithium amidophosphine and NaPCO). Of particular interest, the thermal evolution of 3, at 80&#8201;&#176;C, leads to the transient formation of corresponding amino&#8208; and phosphanylidene&#8208;phosphaketenes (6 and 7), via a reductive elimination at the PbII center forming new N&#8722;P and P&#8722;P bonds. Further evolution of 6 gives a new cyclic (amino)phosphanylidene phosphorane 4, which shows a unique reactivity as a phosphinidene. This result provides a new synthetic route to phosphinidenes, extending and facilitating further their access.

Pt/Zn and Pt/Ca dimethyl complexes feature various degrees of metal&#8208;metal and metal&#8208;Me interactions and show Pt/Zn cooperative activation of H2, B&#8722;H and Si&#8722;H bonds, observed only when Zn is in close proximity to Pt, as well as facile protonolysis by water, MeOH and C&#8722;H bond of terminal acetylene.







Abstract
We report a series of heterobimetallic Pt/Zn and Pt/Ca complexes to study the effect of proximity of a dicationic base metal on the organometallic Pt species. Varying degrees of Pt&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Zn and Zn interaction with the bridging Me group are achieved, showcasing snapshots of a hypothetical process of retrotransmetalation from Pt to Zn. In contrast, only weak interactions were observed for Ca with a Pt&#8208;bound Me group. Activation of H2, B&#8722;H and Si&#8722;H bonds leads to the formation of hydride&#8208;bridged Pt&#8722;H&#8722;Zn complexes, which is not observed in the absence of Zn, pointing out the importance of metal&#8208;metal cooperation. Reactivity of PtMe2/M2+ with terminal acetylene, water and methanol is also studied, leading to facile protonation of one of the Me groups at the Pt center only when Zn is present. This study sheds light on various ways in which the presence of a 2+ metal cation significantly affects the reactivity of a common organoplatinum complex.

         <title>Four&#8208;Step Spin Crossover in a New Cyano&#8208;Bridged Iron&#8208;Silver Coordination Polymer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 44, August 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new guest&#8208;free Hofmann clathrate analogue Fe(2&#8208;ethoxypyrazine)2{Ag(CN)2}2 which undergoes a four&#8208;step spin crossover during the transition from the low&#8208;spin to the high&#8208;spin state is reported. At the first step 1/3 of centers become high spin, at the second step another 1/3 of centres become high spin, at the third step spin mixed crystallographic centres are observed, and after the fourth step all centers are high spin.







Abstract
Spin&#8208;crossover complexes with multistep transitions attract much attention due to their potential applications as multi&#8208;switches and for data storage. A four&#8208;step spin crossover is observed in the new iron(II)&#8208;based cyanometallic guest&#8208;free framework compound Fe(2&#8208;ethoxypyrazine)2{Ag(CN)2}2 during the transition from the low&#8208;spin to the high&#8208;spin state. A reverse process occurs in three steps. Crystallographic studies reveal an associated stepwise evolution of the crystal structures. Multiple transitions in the reported complex originate from distinct FeII sites which exist due to the packing of the ligand with a bulky substituent.

         <dc:description>
By the assisting promotion effect of the azolyl group itself, an efficient Co&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation of azolyl&#8208;substituted alkenes has been successfully developed for the convenient introduction of chirality near the azole ring. It was the first utilization of an azole as the directing group in Co&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation. Chiral azoles were obtained in high yields and with excellent enantioselectivities under mild conditions and the gram&#8208;scale experiment went smoothly at up to 2000 substrate/catalyst.







Abstract
The azole&#8208;directed cobalt&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation of alkenes has been developed with high efficiency. With this approach, chiral pyrazole compounds were obtained in quantitative yields and excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99&#8201;% ee) under mild conditions, and the hydrogenation was conducted on a gram scale with up to 2000 TON. Several useful applications were demonstrated including the convenient introduction of &#946;&#8208;chirality to a drug intermediate containing an azole ring.

         <title>An Expedient Method for the Umpolung Coupling of Enols with Heteronucleophiles

A useful strategy: Herein, we report an umpolung strategy mediated by a hypervalent iodine(III) reagent for the functionalization of enol derivatives with different heteronucleophiles including carboxylic acids, thiols, alcohols, primary and secondary amines, azides and carbamates generated from CO2. Relevant examples for the derivatization of natural products and pharmaceutical compounds are also presented. The mechanism of the reaction was investigated by DFT calculations and experimental studies.







Abstract
In this paper, we present an unprecedented and general umpolung protocol that allows the functionalization of silyl enol ethers and of 1,3&#8208;dicarbonyl compounds with a large range of heteroatom nucleophiles, including carboxylic acids, alcohols, primary and secondary amines, azide, thiols, and also anionic carbamates derived from CO2. The scope of the reaction also extends to carbon&#8208;based nucleophiles. The reaction relies on the use of 1&#8208;bromo&#8208;3,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1&#955;3[d][1,2]iodaoxole, which provides a key &#945;&#8208;brominated carbonyl intermediate. The reaction mechanism has been studied experimentally and by DFT, and we propose formation of an unusual enolonium intermediate with a halogen&#8208;bonded bromide.

         <title>Single&#8208;Molecule Sensing of Acidic Catecholamine Metabolites Using a Programmable Nanopore</title>

Three acidic catecholamine metabolites, including 3,4&#8208;dihydroxymandelic acid (DHMA), 3&#8208;methoxy&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxymandetic acid (VMA) and 3,4&#8208;dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) were investigated by PNRSS. DHMA, which contains an &#945;&#8208;hydroxycarboxylate moiety (red shade, marked as 1) and an adjacent cis&#8208;hydroxyl groups on the benzene ring (blue shade, marked as 2), reports two binding modes (PBA&#8208;1 and PBA&#8208;2) simultaneously resolvable by PNRSS, demonstrating a high resolution of PNRSS. A custom machine learning algorithm was also developed to achieve automatic event classification.







Abstract
Acidic catecholamine metabolites, which could serve as diagnostic markers for many diseases, demonstrate an importance of accurate sensing. However, they share a highly similar chemical structure, which is a challenge in the design of sensing strategies. A nanopore may be engineered to sense these metabolites in a single molecule manner. To achieve this, a recently developed programmable nano&#8208;reactor for stochastic sensing (PNRSS) technique adapted with a phenylboronic acid (PBA) adaptor was applied. Three acidic catecholamine metabolites, including 3,4&#8208;dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), 3,4&#8208;dihydroxymandelic acid (DHMA) and 3&#8208;methoxy&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxymandetic acid (VMA) were investigated by PNRSS. Specifically, DHMA, which contains an &#945;&#8208;hydroxycarboxylate moiety and an adjacent cis&#8208;hydroxyl groups on its benzene ring, reports two binding modes simultaneously resolvable by PNRSS. Assisted with the high resolution of PNRSS, direct regulation of these two binding modes by pH can also be observed. A custom machine learning algorithm was also developed to achieve automatic event classification.

         <title>Redox&#8208;Switchable Complexes Based on Nanographene&#8208;NHCs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 44, August 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanographene&#8208;functionalized NHC ligand was prepared and coordinated to rhodium an iridium. The presence of a perylene&#8208;diimide moiety in the ligand allows that the resulting complexes show redox&#8208;switching properties in the [3+2] cycloaddition of diphenylcyclopropenone and methylphenylacetylene.







Abstract
A series of rhodium and iridium complexes with a N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligand decorated with a perylene&#8208;diimide&#8208;pyrene moiety are described. Electrochemical studies reveal that the complexes can undergo two successive one&#8208;electron reduction events, associated to the reduction of the PDI moiety attached to the NHC ligand. The reduction of the ligand produces a significant increase on its electron&#8208;donating character, as observed from the infrared spectroelectrochemical studies. The rhodium complex was tested in the [3+2] cycloaddition of diphenylcyclopropenone and methylphenylacetylene, where it displayed a redox&#8208;switchable behavior. The neutral complex showed moderate activity, which was suppressed when the catalyst was reduced.

         <title>C&#8722;X Bond Activation by Palladium: Steric Shielding versus Steric Attraction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 44, August 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bulk up! Our computational study shows how increasing steric bulk at the C&#8722;X bond systematically decreases the bond strength along the series C(0&#176;)&#8722;X to C(1&#176;)&#8722;X to C(2&#176;)&#8722;X to C(3&#176;)&#8722;X. These weaker C&#8722;H and C&#8722;C bonds are not always more reactive in oxidative addition reactions with palladium catalysts. Instead, we illustrate the interplay between steric repulsion across the C&#8722;X bond versus that of the catalyst and substrate.







Abstract
The C&#8722;X bond activation (X = H, C) of a series of substituted C(n&#176;)&#8722;H and C(n&#176;)&#8722;C(m&#176;) bonds with C(n&#176;) and C(m&#176;) = H3C&#8722; (methyl, 0&#176;), CH3H2C&#8722; (primary, 1&#176;), (CH3)2HC&#8722; (secondary, 2&#176;), (CH3)3C&#8722; (tertiary, 3&#176;) by palladium were investigated using relativistic dispersion&#8208;corrected density functional theory at ZORA&#8208;BLYP&#8208;D3(BJ)/TZ2P. The effect of the stepwise introduction of substituents was pinpointed at the C&#8722;X bond on the bond activation process. The C(n&#176;)&#8722;X bonds become substantially weaker going from C(0&#176;)&#8722;X, to C(1&#176;)&#8722;X, to C(2&#176;)&#8722;X, to C(3&#176;)&#8722;X because of the increasing steric repulsion between the C(n&#176;)&#8208; and X&#8208;group. Interestingly, this often does not lead to a lower barrier for the C(n&#176;)&#8722;X bond activation. The C&#8722;H activation barrier, for example, decreases from C(0&#176;)&#8722;X, to C(1&#176;)&#8722;X, to C(2&#176;)&#8722;X and then increases again for the very crowded C(3&#176;)&#8722;X bond. For the more congested C&#8722;C bond, in contrast, the activation barrier always increases as the degree of substitution is increased. Our activation strain and matching energy decomposition analyses reveal that these differences in C&#8722;H and C&#8722;C bond activation can be traced back to the opposing interplay between steric repulsion across the C&#8722;X bond versus that between the catalyst and substrate.

         <title>Front Cover: Chemically Laminated 2D Bis(terpyridine)metal Polymer Films: Formation Mechanism at the Liquid&#8211;Liquid Interface and Redox Rectification (Chem. Eur. J. 44/2022)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 44, August 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heterolaminated bis(terpyridine)metal films have been prepared by sequential coordination at the H2O/CH2Cl2 interface. In the reaction, metal ions permeate the grown films from the aqueous phase to react with the terpyridine ligand on the organic&#8208;phase side. The heterolaminated films show unique redox behavior based on electron transfer mediation, and a stable rectification character owing to the difference in electron transfer kinetics between the two layers. More information can be found in the Research Article by H. Nishihara and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202201316).

Bimetallic duet: The reactivity of a classical organometallic Pt complex, represented by a professional cello player, is enhanced by combined performance with an abundant and inexpensive metal like Zn, represented as a street musician on the left, leading to facile activation of H&#8722;H, B&#8722;H, and Si&#8722;H bonds, which does not occur during a solo performance by Pt alone. More about the bimetallic duet can be found in the Research Article by J.&#8197;R. Khusnutdinova and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202201639). Kaori Serakaki is thanked for designing the image.

With his hand holding the sail and his feet on the sailboard, the position of the windsurfer mimics the key strategy of this work: the activation of hydrogenated substrates by chelating coordination with cobalt. The surfer is the cobalt catalyst holding the sail to coordinate parazole, and with his foot on the hydrogenated substrate board to coordinate the vinyl group. Bubbles in the seawater represent the main reagent of the reaction, hydrogen, the dolphin represents the hydrogenated product of this reaction, and the wind represents the bisphosphine ligand that promotes the catalytic activity. Overall, the picture shows that the reaction we developed is powerful like the sport of surfing. More information can be found in the Research Article by Z. Zhang, W. Zhang, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202201517).

Several transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free dehalogenative, dehydrogenative borylation, cyclization and alkyne activation approaches for the formation of highly valuable heterocyclic carbon&#8208;boron bond are reviewd.







Abstract
Heteroaryl boronic acids and esters are extremely important and valuable intermediates because of their wide application in the synthesis of marketed drugs and bioactive compounds. Over the last couple of decades, the construction of highly important heteroaryl carbon&#8208;boron bonds has created huge attention. The transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free protocols are more green, less sensitive to air and moisture, and also economically advantageous over the transition&#8208;metal&#8208;based protocols. The transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free C&#8722;H borylation of heteroarenes and C&#8722;X (X=halogen) borylation of heteroaryl halides represents an excellent approach for their synthesis. Also, various cyclization and alkyne activation protocols have been recently established for their synthesis. The goal of this review article is to summarize the existing literature and the current state of the art for transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free synthesis of heteroaryl boronic acid and esters.

Abstract
In an interview with Benjamin List, winner of the 2021 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, members of the Young Chemists&#8217; Network (JCF) of the German Chemical Society (GDCh) asked him about his science, his career, and the academic system. Benjamin List, Director at the Max&#8208;Planck&#8208;Institut f&#252;r Kohlenforschung in Germany, was awarded the Nobel Prize together with David W. C.

         <title>Modulation of the sorption characteristics for an H&#8208;bonded porous architecture by varying the chemical functionalization of the channel walls</title>

         <dc:description>Five isostructural microporous supramolecular architectures prepared by H&#8208;bonded assembly between the hexa&#8208;anionic complex [Zr  2  (Ox)  7  ]  6&#8208;  (Ox = oxalate, (C  2  O  4  )  2&#8208;  ) and tripodal cations (H  3  &#8208;TripCH  2  &#8208;R)  3+  with R = H, CH  3  , OH and OBn (Bn = CH  2  Ph) are reported. The possibility to obtain the same structure using a mixture of tripodal cations with different R group (R = OH and R = CH  3  ) has also been successfully explored, providing a unique example of three&#8208;component H&#8208;bonded porous framework. The resulting SPA&#8208;1(R) materials feature 1D pores decorated by R groups, with apparent pore diameters ranging from 3.0 to 8.5 &#197;. Influence of R groups on the sorption properties of these materials is evidenced through CO  2  and H  2  O vapor sorption/desorption experiments, as well as with I  2  capture/release experiments in liquid media. This study is one of the first to demonstrate the possibility of tuning the porosity and exerting precise control over the chemical functionalization of the pores in a given H&#8208;bonded structure, without modifying the topology of the reference structure, and thus finely adjusting the sorption characteristics of the material.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecularly Imprinted Nanozymes with Free Substrate Access for Catalyzing the Ligation of ssDNA Sequences</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanozymes have attracted wide attention for the unique advantages of low cost, high stability and designability. Molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) have demonstrated great potential as a new type of nanozymes due to their excellent specificity and high affinity. However, effective approaches for creating molecularly imprinted nanozymes still remain limited. Herein, we report a new approach called reverse microemulsion template docking surface imprinting (RMTD&#8208;SI) for the rational design and engineering of nanozymes with free substrate access for the ligation of ssDNA sequences. As a proof of the principle, octa&#8208;deoxyribonucleotide&#8208;imprinted nanoparticles were successfully prepared. Using tetradeoxyribonucleotides and octa&#8208;deoxyribonucleotide as substrates, the properties, catalytic activity and behaviors of the imprinted nanoparticles were thoroughly investigated. The imprinted nanozyme exhibited an enhanced reaction speed (by up to 41&#8208;fold) and good sequence selectivity towards substrate tetra&#8208;deoxyribonucleotides. More interestingly, due to the open substrate access, the imprinted nanozyme also allowed for catalyzing the ligation of a ssDNA that is fully complementary to the imprinted cavity to form longer sequences, but at the price of scarified substrate selectivity. Thus, this study provided not only a new avenue to the rational design and synthesis of molecularly imprinted nanozymes but also new insights of their catalytic behaviours.</dc:description>

         <title>Colloidal Stability of TiO2 Nanoparticles: The Roles of Phosphonate Ligand Length and Solution Temperature</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Don't go to any length: The hydrodynamic diameter was observed. In contrast to classical colloid theory, the dodecylphosphonate ligand provided better colloidal stability than the longer or shorter n&#8208;alkylphosphonate ligands. The proposed method is applicable to a wide range of colloidal nanoparticle systems.







Abstract
Surface ligands are essential tools for the stabilization of colloidal nanoparticles (NPs) in solvents. However, knowledge regarding the effects of the ligand shell, especially the ligand length, is insufficient and controversial. Here we demonstrate solution&#8208;based experiments on n&#8208;alkylphosphonate&#8208;capped TiO2 NPs to investigate the effects of ligand length and solution temperature on colloidal stability. A robust ligand&#8208;exchange process is achieved that draws free ligands and impurities away from the colloidal solution. In the case of 8&#8197;nm anatase NPs in toluene, the dodecylphosphonate ligand provided better colloidal stability than all the other n&#8208;alkylphosphonate ligands. In addition, relaxation studies suggested there is kinetic hysteresis in the dispersion/agglomeration transition. The proposed method is applicable to a wide range of surface ligands designed to maximize the colloidal stability of NPs.

In the case of 8&#8197;nm anatase NPs in toluene, the dodecylphosphonate ligand provided better colloidal stability than all the other &lt;i&gt;n-&lt;/i&gt;alkylphosphonate ligands. In addition, relaxation studies suggested there is kinetic hysteresis in the dispersion/agglomeration transition. The proposed method is applicable to a wide range of surface ligands designed to maximize the colloidal stability of NPs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we present the first atroposelective aminocatalytic methodology for the construction of C&#8211;N atropisomers. The synthesis of this class of axially chiral molecules typically encompasses substrates in which the C&#8211;N bond is pre&#8208;formed. In contrast, this work presents the direct coupling of indole&#8208;2&#8208;carboxaldehydes and ortho&#8208;quinones, to form the stereogenic C&#8211;N axis in an atroposelective way. Application of typical aminocatalysts furnished the desired product, however, in low yields and as a complex mixture arising from poor regiocontrol among the C3&#8208; and N1&#8208;sites of the indole core. A new aminocatalyst was designed and synthesized with increased outer&#8208;sphere steric bulk to address these challenges&#8212;providing good levels of regio&#8208; and enantioselectivity. A novel library of functionalized and enantioenriched C&#8211;N atropisomers was obtained and their synthetic utility was demonstrated by various transformations.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>
An unprecedented Ru&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H bond hydroarylation of the in&#8197;situ generated 3,3,3&#8208;trifluoropropyne from the inexpensive 2&#8208;bromo&#8208;3,3,3&#8208;trifluoropropene was developed to access &#946;&#8208;trifluoromethylstyrenes. A wide range of (hetero)arenes was functionalized leading selectively to the E&#8208;isomers. Detailed mechanistic studies and DFT calculations supported the involvement of an arene&#8208;free cyclometallated Ru(II) species and a bis&#8208;cyclometallated Ru complex as key intermediate.







Abstract
In this study, a practical and straightforward synthesis of &#946;&#8208;(E)&#8208;trifluoromethylstyrenes by ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H bond activation was developed. The readily available and inexpensive 2&#8208;bromo&#8208;3,3,3&#8208;trifluoropropene (BTP), a non&#8208;ozone depleting reagent, was used as a reservoir of 3,3,3&#8208;trifluoropropyne. With this approach, the monofunctionalization of a panel of heteroarenes was possible in a safe and scalable manner (23 examples, up to 87&#8201;% yield). Mechanistic investigations and density functional theory (DFT) calculations were also conducted to get a better understanding of the mechanism of this transformation. These studies suggested that 1) a cyclometallated ruthenium complex enabled the transformation, 2) this complex exhibited high efficiency in this transformation compared to the commercially available [RuCl2(p&#8208;cymene)]2 and 3) the mechanism proceeded through a bis&#8208;cyclometallated ruthenium intermediate for the carboruthenation step.

         <title>Infrared Spectroscopy Elucidates the Inhibitor Binding Sites in a Metal&#8208;Dependent Formate Dehydrogenase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8208;dependent formate dehydrogenases (FDH) are capable of oxidizing formate to CO2 reversibly. Here, we compared IR spectroscopic data with DFT calculations and inhibition kinetics to study the putative binding mode of CO2/formate at the bis&#8208;MGD cofactor with the help of isoelectronic and charged product analogues. Experimental and theoretical data exclude a direct binding of the inhibitor molecules to the bis&#8208;MGD.







Abstract
Biological carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction is an important step by which organisms form valuable energy&#8208;richer molecules required for further metabolic processes. The Mo&#8208;dependent formate dehydrogenase (FDH) from Rhodobacter capsulatus catalyzes reversible formate oxidation to CO2 at a bis&#8208;molybdopterin guanine dinucleotide (bis&#8208;MGD) cofactor. To elucidate potential substrate binding sites relevant for the mechanism, we studied herein the interaction with the inhibitory molecules azide and cyanate, which are isoelectronic to CO2 and charged as formate. We employed infrared (IR) spectroscopy in combination with density functional theory (DFT) and inhibition kinetics. One distinct inhibitory molecule was found to bind to either a non&#8208;competitive or a competitive binding site in the secondary coordination sphere of the active site. Site&#8208;directed mutagenesis of key amino acid residues in the vicinity of the bis&#8208;MGD cofactor revealed changes in both non&#8208;competitive and competitive binding, whereby the inhibitor is in case of the latter interaction presumably bound between the cofactor and the adjacent Arg587.

         <title>Intense Molar Circular Dichroism in Fully Conjugated All&#8208;Carbon Macrocyclic 1,3&#8208;Butadiyne Linked pseudo&#8208;meta [2.2]Paracyclophanes

         <dc:description>
Enantiopure trimeric, tetrameric, pentameric, and hexameric macrocyclic 1,3&#8208;butadiyne linked pseudo&#8208;meta [2.2]paracyclophanes were synthesized by a homocoupling reaction in high yields and their photophysical properties were analyzed. Investigating the chiroptical properties revealed unrivalled molar circular dichroism values for all&#8208;carbon macrocycles and efficient through&#8208;space conjugation to reach astounding polymer&#8208;like conjugation lengths.







Abstract
The synthetic access to macrocyclic molecular topologies with interesting photophysical properties has greatly improved thanks to the successful implementation of organic and inorganic corner units. Based on recent reports, we realized that pseudo&#8208;meta [2.2]paracyclophanes (PCPs) might serve as optimal corner units for constructing 3D functional materials, owing to their efficient electronic communication, angled substituents and planar chirality. Herein, we report the synthesis, characterization and optical properties of four novel all&#8208;carbon enantiopure macrocycles bearing three to six pseudo&#8208;meta PCPs linked by 1,3&#8208;butadiyne units. The macrocycles were obtained by a single step from enantiopure, literature&#8208;known dialkyne pseudo&#8208;meta PCP and were unambiguously identified and characterized by state of the art spectroscopic methods and in part even by x&#8208;ray crystallography. By comparing the optical properties to relevant reference compounds, it is shown that the pseudo&#8208;meta PCP subunit effectively elongates the conjugated system throughout the macrocyclic backbone, such that already the smallest macrocycle consisting of only three subunits reaches a polymer&#8208;like conjugation length. Additionally, it is shown that the chiral pseudo&#8208;meta PCPs induce a remarkable chiroptical response in the respective macrocycles, reaching unprecedented high molar circular dichroism values for all&#8208;carbon macrocycles of up to 1307&#8197;L&#8201;mol&#8722;1&#8197;cm&#8722;1.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fibers are ideal carriers for AIEgens towards realizing sophisticated optical functions. On the single fiber level, the integration of a multiple functional components into a fiber provides adjustable microenvironments to manipulate the aggregate state of AIEgens. On the multiple&#8208;fiber level, the assembly of multiple fiber offers entangled network to produce large&#8208;scale fabrics to endow AIEgens with amplified functions and practical values.







Abstract
Mesoscopic aggregate is important to transfer or even amplify the molecular information in macroscopic materials. As an important branch of aggregate science, aggregation&#8208;induced emissive luminogens (AIEgens) often show slight or even no emission in solutions but exhibit bright emission when they aggregate, which open a new avenue for the practical applications. Due to the flexible and rotor structure of AIEgens, the aggregate structure of AIEgens is highly sensitive to the surrounding microenvironment, resulting in adjustable optical properties. Fibers integrated of a multiplicity of functional components are ideal carriers to control the aggregation processes, further assembly of fibers produces large&#8208;scale fabrics with amplified functions and practical values. In this Concept article, we focus on the latest advances on the synergy between &#8220;AIE+Fiber&#8221; for the boosted performance that beyond AIE, and their applications are presented and abstracted out to stimulate new ideas for developing &#8220;AIE+Fiber&#8221; systems.

         <title>Stereoselective Activation of Small Molecules by a Stable Chiral Silene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel cyclic and chiral silene was synthesized and fully characterized. The chiral (S)&#8208;BINOL scaffold in the silene enabled unprecedented complete control over the diastereoselectivity in the reactions with different small molecules, S8, CO2 and HCl.







Abstract
The reaction of the dilithium salt of the enantiopure (S)&#8208;BINOL (1,1&#8217;&#8208;bi&#8208;2&#8208;naphthol) with two equivalents of the amidinate&#8208;stabilized chlorosilylene [LPhSiCl] (LPh=PhC(NtBu)2) led to the formation of the first example of a chiral cyclic silene species comprising an (S)&#8208;BINOL ligand. The reactivity of the Si=C bond was investigated by reaction with elemental sulfur, CO2 and HCl. The reaction with S8 led to a Si=C bond cleavage and concomitantly to a ring&#8208;opened product with imine and silanethione functional groups. The reaction with CO2 resulted in the cleavage of the CO2 molecule into a carbonyl group and an isolated O atom, while a new stereocenter is formed in a highly selective manner. According to DFT calculations, the [2+2] cycloaddition product is the key intermediate. Further reactivity studies of the chiral cyclic silene with HCl resulted in a stereoselective addition to the Si=C bond, while the fully selective formation of two stereocenters was achieved. The quantitative stereoselective addition of CO2 and HCl to a Si=C bond is unprecedented.

         <title>Sterically Controlled Late&#8208;Stage Functionalization of Bulky Phosphines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Due to the high affinity of phosphines for transition metals, C&#8722;H functionalization of aryl phosphines is dominated by phosphorous&#8208;directed reactions. Here we pair a sterically controlled borylation reaction of unprotected phosphines with phosphine self&#8208;assisted Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura reactions to grant ready access to libraries of functionalized phosphines with a positional selectivity that complements existing methods. More information can be found in the Research Article by C.&#8197;N. Neumann et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202202074).

         <title>C&#8722;H and Si&#8722;H Activation Reactions at Ru/Ga Complexes: A Combined Experimental and Theoretical Case Study on the Ru&#8722;Ga Bond</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ru/Ga compounds activate Si&#8722;H and C&#8722;H bonds. Triethylsilane and toluene are activated by the intermediate [Ru(GaCp*)3H2] and form the respective seven&#8208;fold coordinated Ru/Ga species. The bonding situation of the intermediate, the products, and their respective phosphine analogues are analyzed on the DFT level of theory, and the Ru&#8722;Ga and Ru&#8722;P bond are contrasted.







Abstract
Treatment of [Ru(COD)(MeAllyl)2] and [Ru(COD)(COT)] with GaCp* under hydrogenolytic conditions leads to reactive intermediates which activate Si&#8722;H or C&#8722;H bonds, respectively. The product complexes [Ru(GaCp*)3(SiEt3)H3] (1) and [Ru(GaCp*)3(C7H7)H3] (2) are formed with HSiEt3 or with toluene as the solvent, respectively. While 1 was isolated and fully characterized by NMR, MS, IR and SC&#8208;XRD, 2 was too labile to be isolated and was observed and characterized in&#8197;situ by using mass spectrometry, including labelling experiments for the unambiguous assignment of the elemental composition. The structural assignment was confirmed by DFT calculations. The relative energies of the four isomers possible upon toluene activation at the ortho&#8208;, meta&#8208;, para&#8208; and CH3&#8208;positions have been determined and point to aromatic C&#8722;H activation. The Ru&#8722;Ga bond was analyzed by EDA and QTAIM and compared to the Ru&#8722;P bond in the analogue phosphine compound. Bonding analyses indicate that the Ru&#8208;GaCp* bond is weaker than the Ru&#8208;PR3 bond.

         <title>Improved Reversible Zinc Storage Achieved in a Constitutionally Crystalline&#8208;Stable Mn(VO3)2 Nanobelts Cathode</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The crystalline&#8208;stable Mn(VO3)2 nanobelts cathode presents the specific capacity of 350&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 and maintain a capacity retention rate of 92&#8201;% for 10,000 cycles at a current density of 2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. It also rendered good rate performance and obtained a reversible capacity of up to 200&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 600&#8197;cycles at 0.2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 even under &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C. Benefiting from the unique tunnel type nanobelts structure, the Mn(VO3)2 nanobelts show high Zn2+ migration kinetics and stable framework for reversible ions de&#8208;/insertion.







Abstract
Rechargeable zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) are potential for grid&#8208;scale applications owing to their safety, low price, and available sources. The development of ZIBs cathode with high specific capacity, wide operating voltage window and stable cyclability is urgently needed in next&#8208;generation commercial batteries. Herein, we report a structurally crystalline&#8208;stable Mn(VO3)2 nanobelts cathode for ZIBs prepared via a facile hydrothermal method. The as&#8208;synthesized Mn(VO3)2 exhibited high specific capacity of 350&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, and maintained a capacity retention of 92&#8201;% after 10,000 cycles at 2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. It also showed good rate performance and obtained a reversible capacity of up to 200&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 600 cycles at 0.2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 under &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C. The electrochemical tests suggest that Mn(VO3)2 nanobelts impart fast Zn2+ ions migration, and the introduction of manganese atoms help make the structures more indestructible, leading to a good rate performance and prolonged cycle lifespan.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rechargeable zinc-ion batteries (ZIBs) are potential for grid-scale applications owing to their safety, low price, and available sources. The development of ZIBs cathode with high specific capacity, wide operating voltage window and stable cyclability is urgently needed in next-generation commercial batteries. Herein, we report a structurally crystalline-stable Mn(VO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanobelts cathode for ZIBs prepared via a facile hydrothermal method. The as-synthesized Mn(VO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; exhibited high specific capacity of 350&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.1&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, and maintained a capacity retention of 92&#8201;% after 10,000 cycles at 2&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. It also showed good rate performance and obtained a reversible capacity of up to 200&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; after 600 cycles at 0.2&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; under &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C. The electrochemical tests suggest that Mn(VO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanobelts impart fast Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions migration, and the introduction of manganese atoms help make the structures more indestructible, leading to a good rate performance and prolonged cycle lifespan.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Heterolytic O&#8722;O Bond Cleavage Upon Single Electron Transfer to a Nonheme Fe(III)&#8722;OOH Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The one&#8208;electron reduction of a nonheme FeIII(OOH) intermediate results in the release of the FeII(OH) complex and O2, following a bimolecular reaction consistent with the disproportionation of the hydroperoxo ligand in a putative FeII(OOH) species. One plausible mechanistic scenario is that this disproportionation reaction follows an O&#8722;O heterolytic cleavage pathway via a FeIV&#8208;oxo species.







Abstract
The one&#8208;electron reduction of the nonheme iron(III)&#8208;hydroperoxo complex, [FeIII(OOH)(L52)]2+ (L52=N&#8208;methyl&#8208;N,N&#8217;,N&#8217;&#8208;tris(2&#8208;pyridylmethyl)ethane&#8208;1,2&#8208;diamine), carried out at &#8722;70&#8201;&#176;C results in the release of dioxygen and in the formation of [FeII(OH)(L52)]+ following a bimolecular process. This reaction can be performed either with cobaltocene as chemical reductant, or electrochemically. These experimental observations are consistent with the disproportionation of the hydroperoxo group in the putative FeII(OOH) intermediate generated upon reduction of the FeIII(OOH) starting complex. One plausible mechanistic scenario is that this disproportionation reaction follows an O&#8722;O heterolytic cleavage pathway via a FeIV&#8208;oxo species.

         <title>Optical Modulation of Antibiotic Resistance by Photoswitchable Cystobactamids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cystobactamids, natural products with potent antibiotic properties, have been equipped with mono&#8208; or double&#8208;photoswitches. Antibiotic and gyrase inhibition properties, but also the sensitivity towards the two resistance factors AlbD and and AlbA was light&#8208;dependent.







Abstract
The rise of antibiotic resistance causes a serious health care problem, and its counterfeit demands novel, innovative concepts. The combination of photopharmacology, enabling a light&#8208;controlled reversible modulation of drug activity, with antibiotic drug design has led to first photoswitchable antibiotic compounds derived from established scaffolds. In this study, we converted cystobactamids, gyrase&#8208;inhibiting natural products with an oligoaryl scaffold and highly potent antibacterial activities, into photoswitchable agents by inserting azobenzene in the N&#8208;terminal part and/or an acylhydrazone moiety near the C&#8208;terminus, yielding twenty analogs that contain mono&#8208; as well as double&#8208;switches. Antibiotic and gyrase inhibition properties could be modulated 3.4&#8208;fold and 5&#8208;fold by light, respectively. Notably, the sensitivity of photoswitchable cystobactamids towards two known resistance factors, the peptidase AlbD and the scavenger protein AlbA, was light&#8208;dependent. While irradiation of an analog with an N&#8208;terminal azobenzene with 365&#8197;nm light led to less degradation by AlbD, the AlbA&#8208;mediated inactivation was induced. This provides a proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle that resistance towards photoswitchable antibiotics can be optically controlled.

         <title>Molybdenum(VI) Bis(imido) Complexes: From Frustrated Lewis Pairs to Weakly Coordinating Cations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Demonstration of how to teach well&#8208;known molybdenum bis(imido) complexes new and unexpected reactivities. These frustrated Lewis pairs (FLP) perform heterolytic dihydrogen splitting under ion pair formation consisting of molybdenum amido cations and hydroborates. They prove to be effective catalysts in the hydrosilylation of aldehydes. The molybdenum cations influence the outcome pointing towards their behaviour as weakly coordinating cations (WCCs).







Abstract
Molybdenum(VI) bis(imido) complexes [Mo(NtBu)2(LR)2] (R=H 1&#8201;a; R=CF3 1&#8201;b) combined with B(C6F5)3 (1&#8201;a/B(C6F5)3, 1&#8201;b/B(C6F5)3) exhibit a frustrated Lewis pair (FLP) character that can heterolytically split H&#8722;H, Si&#8722;H and O&#8722;H bonds. Cleavage of H2 and Et3SiH affords ion pairs [Mo(NtBu)(NHtBu)(LR)2][HB(C6F5)3] (R=H 2&#8201;a; R=CF3 2&#8201;b) composed of a Mo(VI) amido imido cation and a hydridoborate anion, while reaction with H2O leads to [Mo(NtBu)(NHtBu)(LR)2][(HO)B(C6F5)3] (R=H 3&#8201;a; R=CF3 3&#8201;b). Ion pairs 2&#8201;a and 2&#8201;b are catalysts for the hydrosilylation of aldehydes with triethylsilane, with 2&#8201;b being more active than 2&#8201;a. Mechanistic elucidation revealed insertion of the aldehyde into the B&#8722;H bond of [HB(C6F5)3]&#8722;. We were able to isolate and fully characterize, including by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis, the inserted products Mo(NtBu)(NHtBu)(LR)2][{PhCH2O}B(C6F5)3] (R=H 4&#8201;a; R=CF3 4&#8201;b). Catalysis occurs at [HB(C6F5)3]&#8722; while [Mo(NtBu)(NHtBu)(LR)2]+ (R=H or CF3) act as the cationic counterions. However, the striking difference in reactivity gives ample evidence that molybdenum cations behave as weakly coordinating cations (WCC).

         <title>Chiral Motifs in Highly Interpenetrated Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks Formed from Achiral Tetrahedral Ligands
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tetrahydral achiral ligands and copper ions assemble into a record number of interpenetrating diamondoid networks. The networks intertwine akin to strands of a molecular rope to shape the chiral channels. The design of the ligand &#8220;arms&#8221; allows modulating their degree of interpenetration and the channel properties. The concurrent presence of such numerous interpenetrated networks and porosity is unprecedented for metal&#8211;organic frameworks.







Abstract
Formation of highly interpenetrated frameworks is demonstrated. An interesting observation is the presence of very large adamantane&#8208;shaped cages in a single network, making these crystals new entries in the collection of diamondoid&#8208;type metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs). The frameworks were constructed by assembling tetrahedral pyridine ligands and copper dichloride. Currently, the networks&#8217; degree of interpenetration is among the highest reported and increases when the size of the ligand is increased. Highly interpenetrated frameworks typically have low surface contact areas. In contrast, in our systems, the voids take up to 63&#8201;% of the unit cell volume. The MOFs have chiral features but are formed from achiral components. The chirality is manifested by the coordination chemistry around the metal center, the structure of the helicoidal channels, and the motifs of the individual networks. Channels of both handednesses are present within the unit cells. This phenomenon shapes the walls of the channels, which are composed of 10, 16, or 32 chains correlated with the degree of interpenetration 10&#8208;, 16&#8208;, and 32&#8208;fold, respectively. By changing the distance between the center of the ligand and the coordination moieties, we succeeded in tuning the diameter of the channels. Relatively large channels were formed, having diameters up to 31.0&#8197;&#197;&#215;14.8&#8197;&#197;.

         <title>Synchrotron X&#8208;ray Electron Density Analysis of Chemical Bonding in the Graphitic Carbon Nitride Precursor Melamine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Odd one out: Melamine is the precursor for the polycondensation reaction to graphitic carbon nitride materials with a range of important applications. It is found that one amine group in melamine is significantly different from the others, and based on extensive analysis of the experimental and theoretical electron density this particular amine group is suggested to be the origin of the condensation process.







Abstract
Melamine is a precursor and building block for graphitic carbon nitride (g&#8208;CN) materials, a group of layered materials showing great promise for catalytic applications. The synthetic pathway to g&#8208;CN includes a polycondensation reaction of melamine by evaporation of ammonia. Melamine molecules in the crystal organize into wave&#8208;like planes with an interlayer distance of 3.3&#8197;&#197; similar to that of g&#8208;CN. Here we present an extensive investigation of the experimental electron density of melamine obtained from modelling of synchrotron radiation X&#8208;ray single&#8208;crystal diffraction data measured at 25&#8197;K with special focus on the molecular geometry and intermolecular interactions. Both intra&#8208; and interlayer structures are dominated by hydrogen bonding and &#960;&#8208;interactions. Theoretical gas&#8208;phase optimizations of the experimental molecular geometry show that bond lengths and angles for atoms in the same chemical environment (C&#8722;N bonds in the ring, amine groups) differ significantly more for the experimental geometry than for the gas&#8208;phase&#8208;optimized geometries, indicating that intermolecular interactions in the crystal affects the molecular geometry. In the experimental crystal geometry, one amine group has significantly more sp3&#8208;like character than the others, hinting at a possible formation mechanism of g&#8208;CN. Topological analysis and energy frameworks show that the nitrogen atom in this amine group participates in weak intralayer hydrogen bonding. We hypothesize that melamine condenses to g&#8208;CN within the layers and that the unique amine group plays a key role in the condensation process.

Abstract
Extension of the medicinal chemistry toolbox is in the vital interest of drug designers. However, the diffusion of an innovation can be a lengthy process. Along these lines, it took almost 70&#8197;years before the use of the sulfoximine group reached a critical mass in medicinal chemistry. Even though interest in this versatile functional group has increased exponentially in recent years, there is ample room for further innovative applications. This Review highlights emerging trends and opportunities for drug designers for the utilization of the sulfoximine group in medicinal chemistry, such as in the construction of complex molecules, proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs), antibody&#8208;drug conjugates (ADCs) and novel warheads for covalent inhibition.

         <title>Development of an Allenyne&#8208;Alkyne [4+2] Cycloaddition and its Application to Total Synthesis of Selaginpulvilin A</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Complex character of a strained molecule. the &#945;,3&#8208;dehydrotoluene generated via the [4+2] cycloaddition of allenyne&#8208;alkyne can be trapped with a hydrogen atom donor or nucleophiles with two opposite regioselectivity; oxygen nucleophiles are incorporated at the benzylic position whereas amine nucleophiles are incorporated onto the aromatic core. This unique reactivity and selectivity is exploited for selaginpuvilin synthesis.







Abstract
A new [4+2] cycloaddition of allenyne&#8208;alkyne is developed. The reaction is believed to proceed with forming an &#945;,3&#8208;dehydrotoluene intermediate. This species behaves as a &#963;&#960;&#8208;diradical to react with a hydrogen atom donor, whereas it displays a zwitterionic reactivity toward weak nucleophiles. The efficiency of trapping &#945;,3&#8208;dehydrotoluene depends not only on its substituents but also the trapping agents. Notable features of the reaction are the activating role of the extra alkyne of the 1,3&#8208;diyne that reacts with the allenyne moiety and the opposite mode of trapping with oxygen and nitrogen nucleophiles. Oxygen nucleophiles result in the oxygen&#8208;end incorporation at the benzylic position of the &#945;,3&#8208;dehydrotoluene, whereas with amine nucleophiles the nitrogen&#8208;end is incorporated into the aromatic core. Relying on the allenyne&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition as an enabling strategy, a concise total synthesis of phosphodiesterase&#8208;4 inhibitory selaginpulvilin A is realized.

         <title>From CsKTaF7 to CsNaTaF7: Alkali Metal Cations Regulation to Generate SHG Activity
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two new mixed&#8208;alkali metal tantalum fluorides CsATaF7 (A=K, Na) were synthesized by hydrothermal reactions based on the parent compounds A2MF7 (A=monovalent cations and M&#8208;d0 transition&#8208;metal cation). Interesting structure transformation for &#946;&#8208;K2TaF7, CsKTaF7, and CsNaTaF7 are induced via alkali metal cation regulations. Among them, CsNaTaF7 crystallizes in polar structure and own moderate SHG effect.







Abstract
Inorganic metal halides play important roles in wide range of areas including fluorescence, X&#8208;ray detection, and nonlinear&#8208;optics. Herein, two new mixed alkali metal tantalum fluorides, CsKTaF7 and CsNaTaF7, have been obtained based on the strategy of cations regulation in A2MF7 (A represents monovalent cations and M is d0 transition&#8208;metal cation) system by a conventional hydrothermal route. CsKTaF7 crystallizes in the centric Pnma space group, while CsNaTaF7 crystallizes in the polar Cmc21 space group and exhibits moderate and phase&#8208;matchable NLO activity. Both halides possess large optical band gaps above 5.0&#8197;eV. The crystal structure evolution, optical properties, and detailed theory calculations of these two halides were elucidated in this work.

&lt;p&gt;Inorganic metal halides play important roles in wide range of areas including fluorescence, X-ray detection, and nonlinear-optics. Herein, two new mixed alkali metal tantalum fluorides, CsKTaF&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; and CsNaTaF&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;, have been obtained based on the strategy of cations regulation in A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;MF&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; (A represents monovalent cations and M is d&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; transition-metal cation) system by a conventional hydrothermal route. CsKTaF&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; crystallizes in the centric &lt;i&gt;Pnma&lt;/i&gt; space group, while CsNaTaF&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; crystallizes in the polar &lt;i&gt;Cmc&lt;/i&gt;2&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; space group and exhibits moderate and phase-matchable NLO activity. Both halides possess large optical band gaps above 5.0&#8197;eV. The crystal structure evolution, optical properties, and detailed theory calculations of these two halides were elucidated in this work.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Heavy Alkali Metal Manganate Complexes: Synthesis, Structures and Solvent&#8208;Induced Dissociation Effects</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heavy alkali metal alkyls can form ate compounds with manganese bis(amides) when donor solvents are absent but introducing the common donors TMEDA or PMDETA leads to breakdown of the ates together with ligand exchange, which results in the formation of new solvated heavier alkali metal amides and alkylmanganese amides.







Abstract
Rare examples of heavier alkali metal manganates [{(AM)Mn(CH2SiMe3)(N&#8216;Ar)2}&#8734;] (AM=K, Rb, or Cs) [N&#8216;Ar=N(SiMe3)(Dipp), where Dipp=2,6&#8208;iPr2&#8208;C6H3] have been synthesised with the Rb and Cs examples crystallographically characterised. These heaviest manganates crystallise as polymeric zig&#8208;zag chains propagated by AM&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960;&#8208;arene interactions. Key to their preparation is to avoid Lewis base donor solvents. In contrast, using multidentate nitrogen donors encourages ligand scrambling leading to redistribution of these bimetallic manganate compounds into their corresponding homometallic species as witnessed for the complete Li &#8208; Cs series. Adding to the few known crystallographically characterised unsolvated and solvated rubidium and caesium s&#8208;block metal amides, six new derivatives ([{AM(N&#8216;Ar)}&#8734;], [{AM(N&#8216;Ar)&#8901;TMEDA}&#8734;], and [{AM(N&#8216;Ar)&#8901;PMDETA}&#8734;] where AM=Rb or Cs) have been structurally authenticated. Utilising monodentate diethyl ether as a donor, it was also possible to isolate and crystallographically characterise sodium manganate [(Et2O)2Na(nBu)Mn[(N&#8216;Ar)2], a monomeric, dinuclear structure prevented from aggregating by two blocking ether ligands bound to sodium.

         <title>Spectroscopic Signature of Dynamical Instability of the Aqueous Complex in the Brown&#8208;Ring Nitrate Test
</title>

Dynamical instabilities in the brown&#8208;ring test: Hydration dynamics around the iron nitrosyl moiety leads to an equilibrium between two complexes, with very different UV&#8208;vis spectra. Ab&#8208;initio molecular dynamics simulations and ab&#8208;initio multi&#8208;reference methods predict that classically established pseudo&#8208;octahedral [Fe(H2O)5(NO)]2+ complex is present along with a square&#8208;pyramidal [Fe(H2O)4(NO)]2+ complex in aqueous solution. The features of the experimental UV&#8208;vis spectrum can be theoretically reproduced only by accounting these two species and not the [Fe(H2O)5(NO)]2+ complex alone.







Abstract
The chemistry of the brown&#8208;ring test has been investigated for nearly a century. Though recent studies have focused on solid state structure determination and measurement of spectra, mechanistic details and kinetics, the aspects of solution structure and dynamics remain unknown. We have studied structural fluctuations of the brown&#8208;ring complex in aqueous solution with ab&#8208;initio molecular dynamics simulations, from which we identified that the classically established pseudo&#8208;octahedral [Fe(H2O)5(NO)]2+ complex is present along with a square&#8208;pyramidal [Fe(H2O)4(NO)]2+ complex. Based on the inability in multi&#8208;reference calculations to reproduce the experimental UV&#8208;vis spectra in aqueous solution by inclusion of thermal fluctuations of the [Fe(H2O)5(NO)]2+ complex alone, we propose the existence of an equilibrium between pseudo&#8208;octahedral and square&#8208;pyramidal complexes. Despite challenges in constructing models reproducing the solid&#8208;state UV&#8208;vis spectrum, the advanced spectrum simulation tool motivates us to challenge the established picture of a sole pseudo&#8208;octahedral complex in solution.

         <title>A Supramolecular Strategy for the Synthesis of Cyclic Oligomers and Polymers by Ring Expansion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The addition of a thiourea derivative (the guest) to an unstrained, olefin&#8208;containing macrocycle (the monomer), in the presence of a Grubbs catalyst, initiates a rapid ring&#8208;expansion reaction. The role of the guest is to inhibit a ring&#8208;closing reaction back to the monomer and this leads to the selective formation of cyclic oligomers with molecular weights up to 6700&#8197;Da.







Abstract
Ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) of strained macrocycles is a key method to prepare diverse polymers. However, lack of ring strain in most macrocycles is an impediment to polymerization. In this paper, the polymerization/oligomerization of unstrained macrocycles was achieved using a supramolecular approach, leading selectively to cyclic products. Diphenyl thiourea and other guest molecules were used as additives to the ROMP reaction of unstrained macrocycles. An intermediate host&#8208;guest complex leads to the stabilization of the open form of the macrocycle after treatment with Grubbs catalysts, thereby favoring polymerization by inhibiting the ring&#8208;closing reaction back to the monomer. This proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept enables ring&#8208;expansion polymerization of unstrained macrocycles leading to cyclic polymers with molecular weights up to 6700&#8197;Da.

Herein, we firstly present an intramolecular photocatalyst integrating a perylene&#8208;based light&#8208;harvesting moiety and a catalytic rhodium center (  Rh  III  phenPer  ). The excited&#8208;state dynamics were investigated by means of steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved absorption and emission spectroscopy. The studies reveal that photoexcitation of  Rh  III  phenPer  yields the formation of a charge&#8208;separated intermediate, namely  Rh  II  phenPer  &#9679;+  , that results in a catalytically active species in the presence of protons.</dc:description>

         <title>&#960;&#8208;Extended Pleiadienes by [5+2] Annulation of 1&#8208;Boraphenalenes and ortho&#8208;Dihaloarenes</title>

         <dc:description>Palladium&#8208;catalyzed [5+2] annulation of 1&#8208;bora&#173;phenalenes with  ortho  &#8208;dihaloarenes afforded negatively curved &#960;&#8208;extended pleiadienes. Two benzo[1,2&#8208;  i  :4,5&#8208;  i  &#8217;]&#173;di&#173;pleiadienes (BDPs) featuring a seven&#8211;six&#8211;seven&#8208;membered ring arrangement were synthesized and investigated. Their crystal structure revealed a unique packing arrangement and theoretical calculations were employed to shed light onto the dynamic behavior of the BDP moiety and its aromaticity. Further, a naphthalene&#8208;fused pleiadiene was stitched together by oxidative cyclo&#173;dehydrogenation to yield an additional five&#8208;membered ring. This formal azulene moiety leads to distinct changes in optical and redox properties and increased perturbation of the aromatic system.</dc:description>

         <title>Bimetallic Ruthenium Nitrosyl Complexes with Enhanced Two&#8208;Photon Absorption Properties for Nitric Oxide Delivery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>One monometallic and three bimetallic ruthenium nitrosyl (RuNO) complexes are presented and fully characterized in reference to a parent monometallic complex of formula [FTRu(bpy)(NO)]  3+  , where FT is a fluorenyl&#8208;substituted terpyridine ligand, and bpy the 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine. These new complexes are built with the new ligands FFT, TFT, TFFT, and TF&#8208;CC&#8208;TF (where an alkyne C&#8801;C group is inserted between two fluorenes). The crystal structures of the bis&#8208;RuNO  2  and bis&#8208;RuNO complexes built from the TFT ligand are presented. The evolution of the spectroscopic features (intensities and energies) along the series, at one&#8208;photon absorption (OPA) correlates well with the TD&#8208;DFT computations. A spectacular effect is observed at two&#8208;photon absorption (TPA) with a large enhancement of the molecular cross&#8208;section (&#963;  TPA  ), in the bimetallic species. In the best case, &#963;  TPA  is equal to 1523 &#177; 98 GM at 700 nm, in the therapeutic window of transparency of biological tissues. All compounds are capable of releasing NO  &#8226;  under irradiation, which leads to promising applications in TPA&#8208;based drug delivery.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Tetraiodotetraazapentacene  I  4  TAP  , the last missing derivative in the series of halogenated silylated tetraazapentacenes, was synthesized via condensation chemistry from a TIPS&#8208;ethynylated diaminobenzothiadiazol in three steps. Single and double reduction furnished its air&#8208;stable monoanion and relatively air&#8208;stable dianion, both of which were characterized by crystallography. All three species are structurally and spectroscopically compared to non&#8208;halogenated  TAP  and  Br  4  TAP.

         <title>Fabrication of highly luminescent and thermally stable phosphors through in&#8208;situ formation of BaSO4 on sulfur nanodots</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Producing high performance phosphors using abundant and non&#8208;toxic precursors yet straightforward methods are promising but still a challenging task.  Herein, highly luminescent and thermally stable phosphors were fabricated through an in&#8208;situ precipitation synthesis strategy. Sulfur nanodots (S&#8208;dots) act as the precursors for precipitation reactions and also provide the luminescent centers. Structural and optical characterization investigations suggest that S&#8208;dots are incorporated in the matrix of BaSO  4  , and BaSO  4  provides passivation effect for the surface ligands or traps of S&#8208;dots. This results in the promotion of photoluminescence quantum yield from 23% to 58%, and the BaSO  4  matrix also leads to the obvious promotion of thermal stability. These merits endow the construction of phosphor&#8208;based light&#8208;emitting diodes by utilizing the S&#8208;dots@BaSO  4  hybrid phosphors as a color conversion layer. These research results are significant for developing sulfur&#8208;based luminescent materials, and also provide a solid and universal theory to produce high quality phosphors.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dinitrogen heterocycles are among&#160;the most important molecular structures, and the synthesis of these types of structures through intermolecular 1,2&#8208;diamination of olefins is a direct and efficient method. However, the types of nitrogen sources are mostly derived from ureas or arylamines, and nitrogen sources from aliphatic amines are still limited due to their distinct electronic and steric effects. Herein, we report a palladium&#8208;catalyzed aerobic intermolecular 1,2&#8208;diamination of conjugated dienes, using ethanediamine and  &#945;&#8208;amino amide derivatives as nitrogen sources respectively, for the synthesis of piperazines and 2&#8208;piperazinones in good yields (up to 95%)&#160;and with high regio&#8208; and chemoselectivities.</dc:description>

         <title>Elastin&#8208;Hyaluronan Bioconjugate as Bioactive Component in Electrospun Scaffolds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hyaluronic acid or hyaluronan (HA) and elastin&#8208;inspired peptides (EL) have been widely recognized as bioinspired materials useful in biomedical applications. The aim of the present work is the production of electrospun scaffolds as wound dressing materials which would benefit from synergic action of the bioactivity of elastin peptides and the regenerative properties of hyaluronic acid. Taking advantage of thiol&#8208;ene chemistry, a bioactive elastin peptide was successfully conjugated to methacrylated hyaluronic acid (MAHA) and electrospun together with poly&#8208;D,L&#8208;lactide (PDLLA). To the best of our knowledge, limited reports on peptide&#8208;conjugated hyaluronic acid were described in literature, and none of these was employed for the production of electrospun scaffolds. The conformational studies carried out by Circular Dichroism (CD) on the bio&#8208;conjugated compound confirmed the preservation of secondary structure of the peptide after conjugation while Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) revealed the supramolecular structure of the electrospun scaffolds. Overall, the study demonstrates that the bioconjugation of hyaluronic acid with the elastin peptide improved the electrospinning processability with improved characteristics in terms of morphology of the final scaffolds</dc:description>

         <title>Terminal N2&#8208;Dissociation in [(PNN)Fe(N2)]2(&#956;&#8208;N2) Leads to Local Spin&#8208;State Changes and Augmented Bridging N2 Activation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nitrogen fixation at iron centres is a fundamental catalytic step for N 2 utilisation, relevant to biological (nitrogenase) and industrial (Haber&#8208;Bosch) processes. This step is coupled with important electronic structure changes which are currently poorly understood. We show here for the first time that terminal dinitrogen dissociation from iron complexes that coordinate N 2 in a terminal and bridging fashion leaves the Fe&#8208;N 2 &#8208;Fe unit intact but significantly enhances the degree of N 2 activation (&#916;&#957; &#8776; 180 cm &#8208;1 , Raman spectroscopy) through charge redistribution. The transformation proceeds with local spin state change at the iron centre (S=&#8543; 2 &#8594; S= 3 &#8725; 2 ). Further dissociation of the bridging N 2 can be induced under thermolytic conditions, triggering a disproportionation reaction, from which the tetrahedral (PNN) 2 Fe could be isolated. This work shows that dinitrogen activation can be induced in the absence of external chemical stimuli such as reducing agents or Lewis acids.</dc:description>

The reaction proceeds with excellent selectivity for boron addition to the external carbon of the 1,3&#8208;diyne framework as unambiguously established by NMR and X&#8208;ray crystallography studies. The reaction displays a broad substrate scope including unsymmetrical diynes to generate products in high yield (up to 95%). Experimental and theoretical studies suggest that phosphine attack on the alkyne is key in the catalytic cycle.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Alkylation of Cyclic Ketones with Dehydroalanine via H&#8208;Bond&#8208;Directing Enamine Catalysis: Straightforward Access to Enantiopure Unnatural &#945;&#8208;Amino Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The growing importance of structurally diverse and functionalized enantiomerically pure unnatural amino acids in the design of drugs, including peptides, has stimulated the development of new synthetic methods. Herein, we report the challenging direct asymmetric alkylation of cyclic ketones with dehydroalanine derivatives via a conjugate addition reaction for the synthesis of enantiopure ketone&#8208;based &#945;&#8208;unnatural amino acids. The key to success was the design of a bifunctional primary amine&#8208;thiourea catalyst that combines H&#8208;bond&#8208;directing activation and enamine catalysis. The simultaneous dual activation of the two relatively unreactive partners, confirmed by mass spectrometry studies, results in high reactivity while securing high levels of stereocontrol. A broad substrate scope is accompanied by versatile downstream chemical modifications. The mild reaction conditions and consistently excellent enantioselectivities (&gt;95% ee in most cases) render this protocol highly practical for the rapid construction of valuable noncanonical enantiopure &#945;&#8208;amino&#8208;acid building blocks.</dc:description>

         <title>Branched Tertiary Amines from&#160; &#945;&#8208;Olefins by Combined Multiphase Tandem Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present the transformation of olefins to branched amines by combining a hydroformylation/aldol condensation tandem reaction with the reductive amination in a combined multiphase system that can be recycled 9 times. The products are branched amines that are precursors for surfactants. Since the multiphase hydroformylation/aldol condensation system has already been studied, the first step was to develop the partial hydrogenation of unsaturated aldehydes together with a subsequent reductive amination. The rhodium/phosphine catalyst is immobilized in a polar polyethylene phase which separates from the product phase after the reaction. Reaction and catalyst recycling are demonstrated by the conversion of the C14&#8208;aldehyde 2&#8208;pentylnonenal with the dimethylamine surrogate dimethylammonium dimethyl&#173;carbamate to the corresponding tertiary amine with yields up to 88% and an average rhodium leaching of less than 0.1% per recycling run. Furthermore, the positive influence of a Bronsted acid and carbon monoxide on the selectivity are discussed. Finally, the two PEG based systems have been merged in one recycling approach, by using the product phase of the hydroformylation aldol condensation reaction for the reductive amination reaction. The yields are stable during a nine recycling runs and the leaching low with 0.09% over the two recycling stages.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Herein we report a photo&#8208;mediated formal addition of carboxylic acids to activated alkenes catalyzed by a pyrimidopteridine photoredox catalyst. The decarboxylation of aliphatic carboxylic acids upon single&#8208;electron oxidation is countered in the presence of electron&#8208;rich alkenes and a hydroacetoxylation is observed. Mechanistic proposals have been made based on CV measurements, competitive Stern&#8208;Volmer quenching and EPR experiments. Evidence that tetra&#8208;  N  &#8208;substituted pyrimidopteridines function as dual photoredox and hydrogen atom transfer catalyst was supported by spectroscopic means.</dc:description>

         <title>Impact of Fluoroalkyl Substituents on the Physicochemical Properties of Saturated Heterocyclic Amines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The replacement of azetidine, pyrrolidine, and piperidine with their fluoroalkyl&#8208;substituted analogs was shown to modulate basicity, lipophilicity and aqueous solubility. Comprehensive analysis of the obtained physicochemical data was carried out to guide rational fine&#8208;tuning of compounds&#8217; properties related to drug optimization.







Abstract
The physicochemical properties (pKa(H), log&#8201;P, and aqueous solubility) of fluoroalkyl&#8208;substituted heterocyclic amines were profiled to facilitate the amines&#8217; rational application in medicinal chemistry research. The features of fluorine&#8208;containing compounds were compared to those of the corresponding parent non&#8208;fluorinated heterocycles and the corresponding fluorinated n&#8208;alkylamines. Amine basicity was observed to change in a monotonic fashion depending on the fluorination pattern. Although the introduction of fluoroalkyl groups had complex effects on the lipophilicity and aqueous solubility of the compounds, possible contributions of the fluorination pattern, ring size, and conformation of the substituent in the ring were addressed for a series of derivatives. The summarized data provide a useful guideline for the application of fluorinated motifs for fine&#8208;tuning a compound's properties related to drug discovery.

         <title>Reversible Photoinduced Conversion of Unprecedented Norbornadiene&#8208;Based Photoswitches with Redox&#8208;Active Naphthalene Diimide Functionalities</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of new photoswitches based on functional NBD&#8208;NDI&#8208;hybrid structures were synthesized and were reversibly switched between their two isomeric states. The photo&#8208;induced conversion, enabled by the redox&#8208;active NDI building block, was investigated in dependency of spacer length and concentration. The experimental results and proposed mechanistic pathway were supported by the conducted DFT calculations.







Abstract
An unprecedented compound class of functional organic hybrids consisting of a photoswitchable norbornadiene building block and a redoxactive chromophore, namely naphthalene diimide, were designed and synthesized. Within these structures the capability of rylene chromophores to function as a redox active catalyst upon their photoexcitation was utilized to initiate the oxidative back&#8208;conversion of the in&#8197;situ formed quadricyclane unit to its norbornadiene analogue. In this way successive photoexcitation at two different wavelengths enabled a controlled photoswitching between the two isomerical states of the hybrids. Beyond this prove of concept, the dependency of the reaction rate to the intramolecular distance of the two functional molecular building blocks as well as the concentration of the photoexcited sample was monitored. The experimental findings and interpretations were furthermore supported by quantum chemical investigations.

         <title>Entropy&#8208;Induced Selectivity Switch in Gold Catalysis: Fast Access to Indolo[1,2&#8208;a]quinolines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An entropy&#8208;induced selectivity switch in the gold&#8208;catalyzed hydroarylation of 2&#8208;ethynyl N&#8208;aryl indoles was discovered, and the investigation by experimental and computational mechanistic studies led to a full explanation of the observed temperature&#8208;dependent selectivity. The in this context introduced methodology allows versatile access to indolo[1,2&#8208;a]quinolines, which are highly fluorescent dyes with appealing photophysical properties making them promising candidates for OLED applications.







Abstract
New N&#8208;heterocyclic compounds for organic functional materials and their efficient syntheses are highly demanded. A surprising entropy&#8208;induced selectivity switch in the gold&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular hydroarylation of 2&#8208;ethynyl N&#8208;aryl indoles was found and its exploitation led to straightforward syntheses of indolo[1,2&#8208;a]quinolines. Experimental and computational mechanistic investigations gave insight into this uncommon selectivity phenomenon and into the special reactivity of the indolo[1,2&#8208;a]quinolines. The high functional group tolerance of this methodology enabled access to a diverse scope with high yields. In addition, bidirectional approaches, post&#8208;functionalization reactions, and &#960;&#8208;extension of the core structure were feasible. An in&#8208;depth study of the photophysical properties explored the structure&#8208;effect relationship for different derivatives and revealed a high potential of these compounds for future applications as functional materials.

Hooked on c&#8208;myc: A series of organoplatinum(II) compounds with diverse amino&#8208;acid&#8208;inspired side&#8208;chains exhibit high affinity and binding selectivity for the c&#8208;myc G&#8208;quadruplex, along with significant emission enhancement and optical selectivity for this target vs. other DNA topologies. The compounds behave as efficient c&#8208;myc G&#8208;quadruplex stabilizers. Insights on the nature of their interaction with c&#8208;myc were gained via resonance Raman investigation and docking simulation studies, highlighting the importance of the side&#8208;chains for the interaction.







Abstract
Organometallic molecules offer some of the most promising scaffolds for interaction with G&#8208;quadruplex nucleic acids. We report the efficient synthesis of a family of organoplatinum(II) complexes, featuring a 2&#8208;([2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridin]&#8208;6&#8208;yl)phenyl tridentate (N&#8743;N&#8743;C) ligand, that incorporates peripheral side&#8208;chains aiming at enhancing and diversifying its interaction capabilities. These include a di&#8208;isopropyl carbamoyl amide, a morpholine ethylenamide, two enantiomeric proline imides and an oxazole. The binding affinities of the Pt&#8208;complexes were evaluated via UV&#8208;vis and fluorescence titrations, against 5 topologically&#8208;distinct DNA structures, including c&#8208;myc G&#8208;quadruplex, two telomeric (22AG) G&#8208;quadruplexes, a duplex (ds26) and a single&#8208;stranded (polyT) DNA. All compounds exhibited binding selectivity in favour of c&#8208;myc, with association constants (Ka) in the range of 2&#8211;5&#215;105&#8197;M&#8722;1, lower affinity for both folds of 22AG and for ds26 and negligible affinity for polyT. Remarkable emission enhancements (up to 200&#8208;fold) upon addition of excess DNA were demonstrated by a subset of the compounds with c&#8208;myc, providing a basis for optical selectivity, since optical response to all other tested DNAs was low. A c&#8208;myc DNA&#8208;melting experiment showed significant stabilizing abilities for all compounds, with the most potent binder, the morpholine&#8208;Pt&#8208;complex, exhibiting a &#916;Tm&gt;30&#8201;&#176;C, at 1&#8201;:&#8201;5 DNA&#8208;to&#8208;ligand molar ratio. The same study implied contributions of the diverse side&#8208;chains to helix stabilization. To gain direct evidence of the nature of the interactions, mixtures of c&#8208;myc with the four most promising compounds were studied via UV Resonance Raman (UVRR) spectroscopy, which revealed end&#8208;stacking binding mode, combined with interactions of side&#8208;chains with loop nucleobase residues. Docking simulations were conducted to provide insights into the binding modes for the same four Pt&#8208;compounds, suggesting that the binding preference for two alternative orientations of the c&#8208;myc G&#8208;quadruplex thymine &#8216;cap&#8217; (&#8216;open&#8217; vs. &#8216;closed&#8217;), as well as the relative contributions to affinity from end&#8208;stacking and H&#8208;bonding, are highly dependent on the nature of the interacting Pt&#8208;complex side&#8208;chain.

We report the efficient synthesis of a family of organoplatinum(II) complexes, featuring a 2-([2,2&#8242;-bipyridin]-6-yl)phenyl tridentate (N&lt;sup&gt;&#8743;&lt;/sup&gt;N&lt;sup&gt;&#8743;&lt;/sup&gt;C) ligand, that incorporates peripheral side-chains aiming at enhancing and diversifying its interaction capabilities. These include a di-isopropyl carbamoyl amide, a morpholine ethylenamide, two enantiomeric proline imides and an oxazole. The binding affinities of the Pt-complexes were evaluated via UV-vis and fluorescence titrations, against 5 topologically-distinct DNA structures, including c-myc G-quadruplex, two telomeric (22AG) G-quadruplexes, a duplex (ds26) and a single-stranded (polyT) DNA. All compounds exhibited binding selectivity in favour of c-myc, with association constants (K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;) in the range of 2&#8211;5&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;M&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, lower affinity for both folds of 22AG and for ds26 and negligible affinity for polyT. Remarkable emission enhancements (up to 200-fold) upon addition of excess DNA were demonstrated by a subset of the compounds with c-myc, providing a basis for optical selectivity, since optical response to all other tested DNAs was low. A c-myc DNA-melting experiment showed significant stabilizing abilities for all compounds, with the most potent binder, the morpholine-Pt-complex, exhibiting a &#916;T&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;gt;30&#8201;&#176;C, at 1&#8201;:&#8201;5 DNA-to-ligand molar ratio. The same study implied contributions of the diverse side-chains to helix stabilization. To gain direct evidence of the nature of the interactions, mixtures of c-myc with the four most promising compounds were studied via UV Resonance Raman (UVRR) spectroscopy, which revealed end-stacking binding mode, combined with interactions of side-chains with loop nucleobase residues. Docking simulations were conducted to provide insights into the binding modes for the same four Pt-compounds, suggesting that the binding preference for two alternative orientations of the c-myc G-quadruplex thymine &#8216;cap&#8217; (&#8216;open&#8217; vs. &#8216;closed&#8217;), as well as the relative contributions to affinity from end-stacking and H-bonding, are highly dependent on the nature of the interacting Pt-complex side-chain.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Sterically Controlled Late&#8208;Stage Functionalization of Bulky Phosphines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Due to the high affinity of phosphines for transition metals, C&#8722;H functionalization of aryl phosphines is dominated by phosphorus&#8208;directed reactions. Here, we pair a sterically controlled borylation reaction of unprotected phosphines with phosphine self&#8208;assisted Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura reactions to grant ready access to libraries of functionalized phosphines with a positional selectivity that complements existing methods.







Abstract
The fine&#8208;tuning of metal&#8208;phosphine&#8208;catalyzed reactions relies largely on accessing ever more precisely tuned phosphine ligands by de&#8208;novo synthesis. Late&#8208;stage C&#8722;H functionalization and diversification of commercial phosphines offers rapid access to entire libraries of derivatives based on privileged scaffolds. But existing routes, relying on phosphorus&#8208;directed transformations, only yield functionalization of C
&#8722;H bonds in a specific position relative to phosphorus. In contrast to phosphorus&#8208;directed strategies, herein we disclose an orthogonal functionalization strategy capable of introducing a range of substituents into previously inaccessible positions on arylphosphines. The strongly coordinating phosphine group acts solely as a bystander in the sterically controlled borylation of bulky phosphines, and the resulting borylated phosphines serve as the supporting ligands for palladium during diversification through phosphine self&#8208;assisted Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura reactions.

         <title>Artificial Antiferromagnets Possessing Extended Zero&#8208;, One&#8208;, Two&#8208;, and Three&#8208;Dimensional Structures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Antiferromagnetic coupling of ferro&#8208; or ferrimagnetically ordered isolated ions (0D), extended chain (1D), layer (2D), or 3D&#8208;network structures can lead to antiferromagnetically ordered materials, which are referred to as artificial (or synthetic) antiferromagnets.







Abstract
Layered (2D) artificial (or synthetic) antiferromagnets are fabricated by atom deposition techniques and possess very thin, nanometer&#8208;scale, magnetically ordered layers separated by a very thin nonmagnetic layer that antiferromagnetically couples the magnetic layers. Artificial antiferromagnets were crucial in the discovery of the giant magnetic effect (GMR), which had an incredible impact on the evolution of computer memory and its applications, and nucleated the dawn of spintronics (magnetoelectrics). The fundamental structural motif has been more recently achieved by using synthetic chemical methods that led to insulating artificial antiferromagnets. Examples of magnetically ordered layers that are antiferromagnetic coupled to form artificial antiferromagnets have been extended to isolated ions (0D) as well as extended chain (1D) and extended network 3D structures, and new phenomena and applications are anticipated as insulating antiferromagnets are more effective at propagating spin currents with respect to dielectric materials.

         <title>Ultralow&#8208;Loading and High&#8208;Performing Ionic Liquid&#8208;Immobilizing Rhodium Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Hydroformylation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A keggin polyoxometalate (POM)&#8208;based ionic liquid immobilizing rhodium single&#8208;atom Rh catalyst exhibits an outstanding catalytic activity for styrene hydroformylation; both the conversion and the yield of aldehyde can reach almost 99&#8201;%, and a TOF was obtained as high as 9000&#8197;h&#8722;1 without using any phosphine ligand in the reaction process.







Abstract
We have developed a Keggin polyoxometalate (POM)&#8208;based ionic&#8208;liquid (IL)&#8208;immobilizing rhodium single&#8208;atom Rh catalyst (MTOA)5[SiW11O39Rh] (MOTA=methyltrioctylammonium cation) that can afford exceptionally high catalytic activity for the hydroformylation of alkenes to produce aldehydes at an ultralow loading of Rh (ca. 3&#8197;ppm). For styrene hydroformylation, both the conversion and the yield of the aldehyde can reach almost 99&#8201;%, and a TOF as high as 9000&#8197;h&#8722;1 was obtained without using any phosphine ligand in the reaction process. Further characterization by FTIR, ICP and ESI&#8208;MS analysis revealed that the single Rh atom was incorporated in the lacunary POM anions. In particular, the bulky IL cation can play an additional role in stabilizing Rh species and thus prevent aggregation and leaching of Rh species. The IL catalyst was miscible with n&#8208;hexane at temperatures; this contributed to exceptionally high activity for hydroformylation even at ultra&#8208;low loading of IL catalyst.

         <title>A Rapid, Highly Sensitive and Selective Phosgene Sensor Based on 5,6&#8208;Pinenepyridine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A phosgene sensor based on 5,6&#8208;pinenepyridine was developed. This sensor shows remarkable selectivity and sensitivity down to 9.7&#8197;nM/0.8&#8197;ppb in solution, with a response time of under 5&#8197;seconds. When fixed on a solid support, gaseous phosgene is detected down to concentrations of 0.1&#8197;ppm.







Abstract
The toxicity of phosgene (COCl2) combined with its extensive use as a reactant and building block in the chemical industry make its fast and accurate detection a prerequisite. We have developed a carboxylic derivative of 5,6&#8208;pinenepyridine which is able to act as colorimetric and fluorimetric sensor for phosgene in air and solution. For the first time, the formation of a pyrido&#8208;[2,1&#8208;a]isoindolone was used for this purpose. In solution, the sensing reaction is extremely fast (under 5&#8197;s), selective and highly sensitive, with a limit of detection (LOD) of 9.7&#8197;nM/0.8&#8197;ppb. When fixed on a solid support, the sensor is able to detect the presence of gaseous phosgene down to concentrations of 0.1&#8197;ppm, one of the lowest values reported to date.

Tunnel vision: The (trans)formation of three&#8208;membered rings is identified as a motif present in the majority of computationally and experimentally studied examples of heavy&#8208;atom tunneling. The reasons for this phenomenon are analyzed through a survey of different types of ring transformations throughout the tunneling literature.







Abstract
Quantum mechanical tunneling has long been recognized as an important phenomenon when considering transformations dominated by a lightweight hydrogen atom. Tunneling of heavier atoms like carbon, initially dismissed as negligible, has seen a quickly increasing number of computationally predicted and/or experimentally confirmed examples over the last decade, thus highlighting its importance for a wide variety of reactions. However, no common structural motif has been pointed out within these seemingly unconnected examples, strongly limiting the predictability of the impact of heavy&#8208;atom tunneling on a given reaction. This Concept article will provide this perspective and showcase how the recognition of the formation and cleavage of three&#8208;membered rings as common motif can inform the prediction of and research into heavy&#8208;atom tunneling reactions.

         <title>Efficient and Sustainable in&#8197;situ Photo&#8208;Fenton Reaction to Remove Phenolic Pollutants by NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;101(Fe)/Ti3C2Tx Schottky&#8208;Heterojunctions</title>

The built&#8208;in electric field formed in NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;101(Fe)/Ti3C2Tx Schottky&#8208;heterojunction hybrids coupled with in&#8197;situ photo&#8208;Fenton&#8208;like reactions to remove phenolic pollution under the visible light irradiation is described.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) with abundant active sites, a class of materials composed of metal nodes and organic ligands, is widely used for photocatalytic degradation of pollutants. However, the rapid recombination of photoinduced carriers of MOFs limits its photocatalytic degradation performance. Herein, Ti3C2Tx nanosheets&#8208;based NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;101(Fe) hybrids with Schottky&#8208;heterojunctions were fabricated by in&#8197;situ hydrothermal assembly for improved photocatalytic activity. The photodegradation efficiencies of the NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;101(Fe)/Ti3C2Tx (N&#8208;M/T) hybrids for phenol and chlorophenol were 96.36&#8201;% and 99.83&#8201;% within 60&#8197;minutes, respectively. The N&#8208;M/T Schottky&#8208;heterojunction duly transferred electrons to the Ti3C2Tx nanosheets surface via built&#8208;in electric fields, effectively suppressing the recombination of photogenerated carriers, thereby improving the photocatalytic performance of NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;101(Fe). Moreover, the Fe&#8208;mixed&#8208;valence in the N&#8208;M/T led to improvement in the efficiency of the in&#8197;situ generated photo&#8208;Fenton reactions, further enhancing the photocatalytic activity with more generated reactive oxygen species (ROS). The study proposes a highly effective removal of phenolic pollutants in wastewater.

Antibacterial artificial sugar&#8208;based material: Synthesis of three types of mannosylerythritol lipid (MEL)&#8208;D analogues with decanoyl groups, &#946;&#8208;GlcEL&#8208;D, &#946;&#8208;GlcEL&#8208;D, and &#945;&#8208;MEL&#8208;D, was accomplished. Their self&#8208;assembling properties, recovery effects on damaged skin cells, and antibacterial activity were evaluated. The results indicated &#945;&#8208;MEL&#8208;D is a promising artificial sugar&#8208;based material candidate for enhancing the barrier function of the stratum corneum with possessing antibacterial activity.







Abstract
Synthesis of three types of purpose&#8208;designed mannosylerythritol lipid (MEL)&#8208;D analogues with decanoyl groups, &#946;&#8208;GlcEL&#8208;D, &#945;&#8208;GlcEL&#8208;D, and &#945;&#8208;MEL&#8208;D, was accomplished utilizing our boron&#8208;mediated aglycon delivery (BMAD) methods. Their self&#8208;assembling properties, recovery effects on damaged skin cells, and antibacterial activity were evaluated. It was revealed, for the first time, that &#945;&#8208;GlcEL&#8208;D and &#945;&#8208;MEL&#8208;D only generated giant vesicles, indicating that slight differences in the steric configuration of an erythritol moiety and fatty acyl chains affect the ability to form vesicles. Analogue &#945;&#8208;MEL&#8208;D exhibited significant recovery effects on damaged skin cells. Furthermore, &#945;&#8208;MEL&#8208;D exhibited antibacterial activity as high as that for MEL&#8208;D, indicating that &#945;&#8208;MEL&#8208;D is a promising artificial sugar&#8208;based material candidate for enhancing the barrier function of the stratum corneum, superior to a known cosmetic ingredient, and possesses antibacterial activity.

Abstract
We synthesized a high&#8208;nuclear isopolymolybdate cluster (n&#8208;Bu4N)6H2[{Mo24O48(OMe)32}{Mo24O52(OMe)28}2]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;25H2O&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;6CH3CN (1) by using [Mo6O19]2&#8722; as the base precursor. Crystallographic characterization shows the cluster is composed of an anionic [{Mo24O48(OMe)32}]8&#8722; cage and two charge&#8208;neutral [{Mo24O52(OMe)28}] cages.

         <title>Macroscopic Polarization Change of Mononuclear Valence Tautomeric Cobalt Complexes Through the Use of Enantiopure Ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The crystallization of a complex having electron transfer properties in a polar space group can induce the polarization switching of a crystal in a specific direction, which is attractive for the development of sensors, memory devices, and capacitors. Unfortunately, the probability of crystallization in a polar space group is usually low.&#160;   Noticing that enantiopure compounds crystallize in Sohncke space groups, this paper reports a strategy for the molecular design of non&#8208;ferroelectric polarization switching crystals   based on the use of intramolecular electron transfer and chirality. In addition, this paper describes the synthesis of a mononuclear valence tautomeric (VT) cobalt complex bearing an enantiopure ligand. The introduction of enantiomer enables the crystallization of the complex in the polar space group (P2  1  ).&#160;  The polarization of the crystals along the b&#8208;axis direction is not canceled out and the VT transition is accompanied by a change in the macroscopic polarization of the polar crystal. Polarization switching via electron transfer is realized at around room temperature.</dc:description>

         <title>The Dowd&#8208;Beckwith Reaction: History, Strategies, and Synthetic Potential</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ring&#8208;expansion strategies are valuable synthetic tools that take benefit of existing ring structures and evade the unfavorable enthalpic&#8208;and entropic effects that arise with end&#8208;to&#8208;end cyclizations. One potentially important class of such reactions is the Dowd&#8208;Beckwith reaction, the ring&#8208;expansion of ketones via alkoxy radicals. The exciting advancement in this research area is starting to show its potential, as demonstrated by applying this methodology in strategy&#8208;level bond formation to synthesize complex natural products. This review aims to provide the first comprehensive survey of the development of the Dowd&#8208;Beckwith reaction spanning three decades from the initial report to the present day, thus providing the readers with great detail about the contributions of this reaction to organic synthesis. We hope that this review will further disclose the salient features of the Dowd&#8208;Beckwith reaction for synthetic applications and encourage the development of new, more advanced applications.</dc:description>

         <title>The alkynylative difunctionalization of alkenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Given alkynyl group is an important functional unit, a variety of efficient methods have been developed to construct alkynyl&#8208;containing compounds. Among them, the alkynylative difunctionalization of alkenes is one of the most straightforward and efficient strategies for preparing these compounds and so has made great progress in recent years, including the catalytic asymmetric manner. However, there is no comprehensive review to summarize these studies. This review is aimed at comprehensively summarizing the alkynylative difunctionalization of alkenes, which is presented in terms of alkynylation&#8208;initiated and alkynylation&#8208;terminated difunctionalization of alkenes. We hope that this review will help to encourage more researchers to further explore in this field.</dc:description>

         <title>Thioxanthylium Cations: Highly Reversible Hydrochromic Materials with Tunable Color and Moisture Sensitivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrochromic materials, which change color in response to moisture, are highly sought&#8208;after due to some unique applications such as moisture detection, humidity monitoring, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, and sweat&#8208;pore mapping. We herein report a new thioxanthene&#8208;9&#8208;ols/thioxanthylium cations hydrochromic system. The hydrochromic thioxanthylium cations can be generated/regenerated by exposing a chemically stable thioxanthene&#8208;9&#8208;ol to trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). The intensely colored thioxanthylium cations can be chemically reverted to the colorless thioxanthene&#8208;9&#8208;ol. Interestingly, the conversion between thioxanthene&#8208;9&#8208;ol and its cation species was found to be highly reversible in most cases (up to 50 activation&#8208;deactivation cycles). The color and moisture&#8208;sensitivity of thioxanthylium cations were also validated to be tunable via functionalization of the thioxanthene core with different aliphatic and aromatic groups at its 9 or 2,7&#8208;positions. Finally, paper probes were prepared using solution&#8208;immersion and inkjet&#8208;printing techniques to demonstrate the system&#8217;s potential applications in humidity sensing and anti&#8208;counterfeiting.</dc:description>

         <title>In&#8208;situ Grignard Metalation Method, Part II: Scope of the One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of Organocalcium Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The  in&#8208;situ Grignard  Metalation Method (  i  GMM) is a straightforward one&#8208;pot strategy to synthesize alkaline&#8208;earth metal amides in multi&#8208;gram scale with high yields via addition of bromoethane to an ethereal suspension of a primary or secondary amine and magnesium (Part I) or calcium (Part II). This method is highly advantageous because no activation of calcium is required prior to the reaction. Contrary to the magnesium&#8208;based  i  GMM, there are some limitations, the most conspicuous one is the large influence of steric factors. The preparation of Ca(hmds)  2  succeeds smoothly within a few hours with excellent yields opening the opportunity to prepare large amounts of this reagent. Side reactions and transfer of the  i  GMM to substituted anilines and  N  &#8208;heterocycles as well as other H&#8208;acidic substrates such as cyclopentadienes are studied. Bulky amidines cannot be converted directly to calcium amidinates via the  i  GMM but stoichiometric calciation with Ca(hmds)  2  enables their preparation.</dc:description>

         <title>Tetrathienyl Corannulene Compounds with Highly Sensitive Photochromism</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tetrathienyl corannulene compounds showed highly sensitive photochromism with a large molar absorption coefficient and photocyclization quantum yield close to 1, although dithienyl phenanthrene compounds showed no photoreactivity. Such a high photoreactivity was rationalized by the predominance of the photoreactive atropisomers amplified by energy migration, and the curvature&#8208;induced short distance between photoreactive carbons. More information can be found in the Research Article by M. Yamada, T. Kawai, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202201286).

         <title>Peri&#8208;Decoration of a Tetraazaperylene with Urea Units: Chiral Octaazaperopyrenedioxides (OAPPDOs) and Their Optical and Chiroptical Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Decorating tetraazaperylene. A new class of highly fluorescent polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, octaazaperopyrenedioxides (OAPPDOs) is described along with their electrochemical, photophysical and chiroptical properties. They contain a tetraazaperylene core with a urea&#8208;derived periphery that is complementary to the dicarboximido termini in perylene tetracarboxydiimides.







Abstract
Octaazaperopyrenedioxides (OAPPDOs) are a new class of fluorescent polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons based on a tetraazaperylene core that is formally condensed with N&#8208;substituted urea units in the two opposite peri positions.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Decorating tetraazaperylene&lt;/b&gt;. A new class of highly fluorescent polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, octaazaperopyrenedioxides (OAPPDOs) is described along with their electrochemical, photophysical and chiroptical properties. They contain a tetraazaperylene core with a urea-derived periphery that is complementary to the dicarboximido termini in perylene tetracarboxydiimides.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Octaazaperopyrenedioxides (OAPPDOs) are a new class of fluorescent polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons based on a tetraazaperylene core that is formally condensed with N-substituted urea units in the two opposite &lt;i&gt;peri&lt;/i&gt; positions. Here, we report the synthesis of series of substituted OAPPDO derivatives with different N-substitution patterns (H, alkyl, benzyl) in the &lt;i&gt;peri&lt;/i&gt; positions, including bay-chlorinated OAPPDOs. Starting from the latter, a series of bay-arylated OAPPDOs was synthesized by Suzuki cross coupling, which resulted in the formation of helically chiral OAPPDO derivatives. The electrochemical and photophysical properties were investigated by UV/Vis and fluorescence spectroscopy as well as cyclic voltammetry. The &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt; enantiomers of a phenylated OAPPDO were separated by semipreparative HPLC and further analyzed by CD spectroscopy. The frontier orbital energies, the mechanism of the isomerization, the electronic excitation and the CD spectrum (TD-DFT) were computed and compared to the experimental data. The reversible 1e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; oxidation of the OAPPDOs generates the corresponding radical cations, one of which was characterized by EPR spectroscopy. The reversible oxidation process was also systematically investigated by spectro-electrochemistry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>Cross&#8208;coupling reactions are essential tools in target molecule synthesis. However, the use of highly reactive organometallic reagents limits their applicability. Here we present mechanochemical Pd&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reaction between aryl halides and organozinc pivalates that can be carried out under ambient temperature and atmosphere. This operationally simple procedure affords a wide range of biaryl and aryl&#8208;heteroaryl derivatives in high yields and short times. The reaction tolerates various functional groups and can be realized on a synthetically useful scale. Its practical value was demonstrated in the short synthesis of the pharmaceutical diflunisal.</dc:description>

         <title>Spin&#8208;Labeled Riboswitch Synthesized from a Protected TPA Phosphoramidite Building Block</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The nitroxide TPA (2,2,5,5&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;pyrrolin&#8208;1&#8208;oxyl&#8208;3&#8208;acetylene) is an excellent spin label for EPR studies of RNA. Previous synthetic methods, however, are complicated and require special equipment. Here we describe a uridine derived phosphoramidite with a photocaged TPA unit attached. The light sensitive 2&#8208;nitrobenzyloxymethyl group can be removed in high yield by short irradiation at 365 nm. Based on this approach, a doubly spin&#8208;labeled 27mer neomycin sensing riboswitch was synthesized and studied by PELDOR. The overall thermal stability of the fold is not much reduced by TPA. In&#8208;line probing nevertheless detected changes in local mobility.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of 13C and 2H Labeled Vinyl Pyruvate   and Hyperpolarization of Pyruvate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The hyperpolarization of nuclear spins has enabled unique applications in chemistry, biophysics, and particularly in metabolic imaging. Parahydrogen&#8208;induced polarization (PHIP) offers a fast and cost&#8208;efficient way of hyperpolarization. Nevertheless, PHIP lags behind dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP), which is already being evaluated in clinical studies. This shortcoming is mainly due to problems in the synthesis of the corresponding PHIP precursor molecules. The most widely used DNP tracer in clinical studies, particularly for the detection of prostate cancer, is 1&#8208;  13  C&#8208;pyruvate. The ideal derivative for PHIP is the deuterated vinyl ester because the spin physics allows for 100% polarization. Unfortunately, there is no efficient synthesis for vinyl esters of &#946;&#8208;ketocarboxylic acids in general and pyruvate in particular. Here, we present an efficient new method for the preparation of vinyl esters, including  13  C labeled, fully deuterated vinyl pyruvate using a palladium catalyzed procedure. Using 50 % enriched parahydrogen and mild reaction conditions, a  13  C polarization of 12% was readily achieved; 36% are expected with 100% pH  2  . Higher polarization values can be potentially achieved with optimized reaction conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct C&#8722;H Trifluoromethylation of (Hetero)Arenes in Water Enabled by Organic Photoredox&#8208;Active Amphiphilic Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoredox&#8208;catalyzed trifluoromethylations of a variety of small organic molecules were studied in water with the aid of amphiphilic polymeric nanoparticles. Excellent recyclability of the nanoparticles, high efficacy and selectivity, and the use of low intensity LED or sunlight render this method versatile and environmentally friendly.







Abstract
Photoredox&#8208;catalyzed chemical conversions are predominantly operated in organic media to ensure good compatibility between substrates and catalysts. Yet, when conducted in aqueous media, they are an attractive, mild, and green way to introduce functional groups into organic molecules. We here show that trifluoromethyl groups can be readily installed into a broad range of organic compounds by using water as the reaction medium and light as the energy source. To bypass solubility obstacles, we developed robust water&#8208;soluble polymeric nanoparticles that accommodate reagents and photocatalysts within their hydrophobic interior under high local concentrations. By taking advantage of the high excited state reduction potential of N&#8208;phenylphenothiazine (PTH) through UV light illumination, the direct C&#8722;H trifluoromethylation of a wide array of small organic molecules is achieved selectively with high substrate conversion. Key to our approach is slowing down the production of CF3 radicals during the chemical process by reducing the catalyst loading as well as the light intensity, thereby improving effectiveness and selectivity of this aqueous photocatalytic method. Furthermore, the catalyst system shows excellent recyclability and can be fueled by sunlight. The method we propose here is versatile, widely applicable, energy efficient, and attractive for late&#8208;stage introduction of trifluoromethyl groups into biologically active molecules.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Photoredox-catalyzed&lt;/b&gt; trifluoromethylations of a variety of small organic molecules were studied in water with the aid of amphiphilic polymeric nanoparticles. Excellent recyclability of the nanoparticles, high efficacy and selectivity, and the use of low intensity LED or sunlight render this method versatile and environmentally friendly.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photoredox-catalyzed chemical conversions are predominantly operated in organic media to ensure good compatibility between substrates and catalysts. Yet, when conducted in aqueous media, they are an attractive, mild, and green way to introduce functional groups into organic molecules. We here show that trifluoromethyl groups can be readily installed into a broad range of organic compounds by using water as the reaction medium and light as the energy source. To bypass solubility obstacles, we developed robust water-soluble polymeric nanoparticles that accommodate reagents and photocatalysts within their hydrophobic interior under high local concentrations. By taking advantage of the high excited state reduction potential of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-phenylphenothiazine (PTH) through UV light illumination, the direct C&#8722;H trifluoromethylation of a wide array of small organic molecules is achieved selectively with high substrate conversion. Key to our approach is slowing down the production of CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; radicals during the chemical process by reducing the catalyst loading as well as the light intensity, thereby improving effectiveness and selectivity of this aqueous photocatalytic method. Furthermore, the catalyst system shows excellent recyclability and can be fueled by sunlight. The method we propose here is versatile, widely applicable, energy efficient, and attractive for late-stage introduction of trifluoromethyl groups into biologically active molecules.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Flexible Alkylene Bridges as a Tool To Engineer Crystal Distyrylbenzene Structures Enabling Highly Fluorescent Monomeric Emission</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Introducing flexible alkylene bridges to distyrylbenzene can realize monomeric emission in the solid state without any requirement for bulky substituents and has many potential applications, diversifying crystal structure design and fabrication strategies.







Abstract
To design ultrabright fluorescent solid dyes, a crystal engineering strategy that enables monomeric emission by blocking intermolecular electronic interactions is required. We introduced propylene moieties to distyrylbenzene (DSB) as bridges between the phenyl rings either side of its C=C bonds. The bridged DSB derivatives formed compact crystals that emit colors similar to those of the same molecules in dilute solution, with high quantum yields. The introduction of flexible seven&#8208;membered rings to the DSB core produced moderate distortion and steric hindrance in the DSB &#960;&#8208;plane. However, owing to this strategy, it was possible to control the molecular arrangement with almost no decrease in the crystal density, and intermolecular electronic interactions were suppressed. The bridged DSB crystal structure differs from other DSB derivative structures; thus, bridging affords access to novel crystalline systems. This design strategy has important implications in many fields and is more effective than the conventional photofunctional molecular crystal design strategies.

         <title>On the Evolutionary History of the Twenty Encoded Amino Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amino acids and proteins! &#8220;Unde venistis&#8221;? The answer to the question of where these (macro)molecules come from is told as a journey that starts with meteorites and ends with the origin of the genetic code. On this journey, which incorporates the citric acid cycle and glycolysis, molecular companions and fellow travelers appear on the scene, in particular coenzymes and cofactors.







Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Amino acids are essential molecular constituents of life, twenty of which are privileged because they are encoded by the ribosomal machinery. The question remains open as to why this number and why this 20 in particular, an almost philosophical question that cannot be conclusively resolved. They are closely related to the evolution of the genetic code and whether nucleic acids, amino acids, and peptides appeared simultaneously and were available under prebiotic conditions when the first self&#8208;sufficient complex molecular system emerged on Earth. This report focuses on prebiotic and metabolic aspects of amino acids and proteins starting with meteorites, followed by their formation, including peptides, under plausible prebiotic conditions, and the major biosynthetic pathways in the various kingdoms of life. Coenzymes play a key role in the present analysis in that amino acid metabolism is linked to glycolysis and different variants of the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA, rTCA, and the incomplete horseshoe version) as well as the biosynthesis of the most important coenzymes. Thus, the report opens additional perspectives and facets on the molecular evolution of primary metabolism.

         <title>A Coordination Network Featuring Two Distinct Copper(II) Coordination Environments for Highly Selective Acetylene Adsorption</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 2D coordination network was synthesised from commercial reagents and displays two distinct coordination environments of copper to carboxylate and salicylaldehydato moieties of the ligand. Solvent exchange of the synthesized network shows retention of framework connectivity coupled with unanticipated framework flexibility to accommodate tetrahydrofuran. The activated framework selectively adsorbs CO2 and C2Hn hydrocarbons over CH4.







Abstract
Single crystals of 2D coordination network {Cu2L2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;(DMF)3(H2O)3}n (1&#8208;DMF) were prepared by reaction of commercial reagents 3&#8208;formyl&#8208;4&#8208;hydroxybenzoic acid (H2L) and Cu(NO3)2 in dimethylformamide (DMF). The single&#8208;crystal structure shows two distinct Cu(II) coordination environments arising from the separate coordination of Cu(II) cations to the carboxylate and salicylaldehydato moieties on the linker, with 1D channels running through the structure. Flexibility is exhibited on solvent exchange with ethanol and tetrahydrofuran, while porosity and the unique overall connectivity of the structure are retained. The activated material exhibits type I gas sorption behaviour and a BET surface area of 950&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1 (N2, 77&#8197;K). Notably, the framework adsorbs negligible quantities of CH4 compared with CO2 and the C2Hn hydrocarbons. It exhibits exceptional selectivity for C2H2/CH4 and C2H2/C2Hn, which has applicability in separation technologies for the isolation of C2H2.

         <title>Direct Comparison of Subvalent, Polycationic Group 13 Cluster Compounds: Lessons learned on Isoelectronic DMPE Substituted Gallium and Indium Tetracation Salts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Four members only. Two novel tetracationic, subvalent clusters [{M(dmpe)}4][Al(ORF)4]4 (M=Ga and In; dmpe=bisdimethylphosphinoethane; RF=C(CF3)3) are presented. In both clusters, the metal ions form a tetragon, with every M atom being four&#8208;coordinated by two M atoms and two donor P atoms. The respective bonding situation and dissociation behavior in solution were thoroughly investigated.







Abstract
The tetracationic, univalent cluster compounds [{M(dmpe)}4]4+ (M=Ga, In; dmpe=bis(dimethylphosphino)ethane) were synthesized as their pf salts ([pf]&#8722;=[Al(ORF)4]&#8722;; RF=C(CF3)3). The four&#8208;membered ring in [{M(dmpe)}4]4+ is slightly puckered for M=Ga and almost square planar for M=In. Yet, although structurally similar, only the gallium cluster is prevalent in solution, while the indium cluster forms temperature dependent equilibria that include even the monomeric cation [In(dmpe)]+. This system is the first report of one and the same ligand inducing formation of isoelectronic and isostructural gallium/indium cluster cations. The system allows to study systematically analogies and differences with thermodynamic considerations and bonding analyses, but also to outline perspectives for bond activation using cationic, subvalent group 13 clusters.

         <title>Online Reaction Monitoring with Fast and Flow&#8208;Compatible Diffusion NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We describe a fast and flow compatible diffusion NMR experiment, that makes it possible to collect accurate diffusion data for samples flowing at up to 3&#8197;mL/min. We use it to monitor the synthesis of a Schiff base with a flow&#8208;tube with a time resolution of approximately 2&#8197;minutes. The one&#8208;shot flow&#8208;compatible diffusion NMR described here open many avenues for reaction monitoring applications.







Abstract
Online monitoring by flow NMR spectroscopy is a powerful approach to study chemical reactions and processes, which can provide mechanistic understanding, and drive optimisations. However, some of the most useful methods for mixture analysis and reaction monitoring are not directly applicable in flow conditions. This is the case of classic diffusion&#8208;ordered NMR spectroscopy (DOSY) methods, which can be used to separate the spectral information for mixture's components. We describe a fast and flow&#8208;compatible diffusion NMR experiment that makes it possible to collect accurate diffusion data for samples flowing at up to 3&#8197;mL/min. We use it to monitor the synthesis of a Schiff base with a flow&#8208;tube with a time resolution of approximately 2&#8197;minutes. The one&#8208;shot flow&#8208;compatible diffusion NMR described here open many avenues for reaction monitoring applications.

         <title>Asymmetric Core&#8208;Expanded BOPYOs: Facile Synthesis and Optical Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A BF3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;OEt2&#8208;induced self&#8208;condensation and coordination method from a single starting material has been developed, which has been studied by experiment and calculation. This gave a parent borondifluoride di(1H&#8208;pyrrolyl)butenone, the &#960;&#8208;conjugated derivatives of which were constructed as a new type of NIR chromophore with favorable photophysical properties based on the intramolecular charge transfer effect.







Abstract
N,O&#8208;bidentate BF2 complexes with five&#8208; and six&#8208;membered core rings have been thoroughly investigated. However, the development of seven&#8208;membered N,O&#8208;boron complexes is still an area to be explored. We have developed BF3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;OEt2&#8208;induced self&#8208;condensation and coordination reactions based on a single starting material, which had been elucidated by experiment and calculation. This parent asymmetric core&#8208;expanded borondifluoride&#8208;(Z)&#8208;1,3&#8208;di(1H&#8208;pyrrol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)but&#8208;2&#8208;en&#8208;1&#8208;one (BOPYO) showed reactivity with a wide range of aldehydes, thus providing a series of conjugation BOPYOs. Moreover, a BOPYO derivative with a dimethylamino group was developed as a new NIR dye that responds to acid with favorable photophysical properties based on intramolecular charge transfer effect.

         <title>Mechanistic Insight into the Photoinduced Damage of an Unnatural Base Pair</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Four photodamage products of dTPT3 have been isolated and identified, which has provided insight into the photodamage mechanism with a Type II photosensitized oxidation. The antioxidant ascorbate was discovered to effectively inhibit the formation of these photodamage products with no new byproducts generated, suggesting that a reductive environment might protect DNA dTPT3 against UVA oxidation and ameliorate its adverse biological effects.







Abstract
Chemical&#8208; and photostability of unnatural base pairs (UBPs) are important to maintain the genetic code integrity, and critical for developing healthy semisynthetic organisms. As reported, dTPT3 was less stable upon irradiation, and thus might act as a pervasive photosensitizer to induce oxidative damage within DNA, causing harm to living semi&#8208;synthetic organisms when exposed to UVA radiation. However, there was no knowledge about molecular&#8208;level understanding of this damage process. In this paper, we not only identified four photoproducts of dTPT3, including desulfur&#8208;dTPT3 (dTPT3H), TPT3 sulphinate (TPT3SO2), TPT3 sulphonate (TPT3SO3) and TPT3&#8208;thioTPT3 (TPT3STPT3), but also established a Type II photosensitized oxidation mechanism. In addition, the antioxidant (sodium ascorbate) was able to effectively inhibit the photoproducts formation of dTPT3 and dTPT3 in DNA, suggesting that a reductive environment might protect DNA bearing dTPT3 against UVA oxidation and ameliorate its adverse biological effects. The comprehensive understanding of TPT3&#8217; photochemical stability will give researchers helpful guidance to design more photostable UBPs and construct healthier semisynthetic organisms.

         <title>Fe&#8208;Catalyzed Amidation of Allylic Alcohols via Borrowing Hydrogen Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Allylic amines are useful building blocks in organic synthesis. The development of green and efficient methods for the preparation of allylic amines are of great importance. An Fe&#8208;catalyzed amidation of allylic alcohols with chiral  tert  &#8208;butysulfinamide via a borrowing hydrogen pathway has been developed. With water as the only by&#8208;product, a range of synthetically useful chiral sulfinamide olefin derivatives (30 examples) were obtained under mild reaction conditions. The reaction can be performed at gram&#8208;scale and the products could serve as chiral ligands for asymmetric catalysis. Mechanistic studies suggest that the reaction proceeds via an Fe&#8208;catalyzed borrowing hydrogen process, which is different from most of the reported allylic amination reactions.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Negishi cross&#8208;coupling reaction of organozinc compounds as nucleophiles with aryl halides has drawn immense focus for C&#8208;C bond formation reactions.

Complexes  1&#8208;4  have been characterized by spectroscopic techniques and their solid&#8208;state structures were also confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallography. Furthermore, complexes  1  &#8208;  4  have been applied in a direct and convenient method to catalyze the Negishi cross&#8208;coupling reaction of various aryl halides with 2,6&#8208;difluorophenylzinc bromide or phenylzinc bromide as the coupling partner in the presence of 3 mol % catalyst.

         <title>Efficient water cleaning by self&#8208;standing carbon nitride films derived from supramolecular hydrogels</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The design of efficient self&#8208;standing hybrid systems for water purification that combines good adsorption properties with high photodegradation ability is highly challenging owing to the difficulty in simultaneously controlling the band structure and porosity of a semiconductor while maintaining its self&#8208;standing nature. Here, we report the synthesis of carbon&#8208;rich carbon nitride self&#8208;standing filters from supramolecular hydrogels composed of melamine and cyanobenzoic acid. The influence of the chemical structure on the properties of the hydrogels and the final films was studied by tuning parameters such as monomer nature, molar ratio, and pyrolysis temperature. Thanks to their ability to combine the adsorption and photodegradation of organic pollutants, the prepared self&#8208;standing films showed remarkable activity and stability in flow conditions (&gt;95% efficiency after 10 consecutive cycles). Additionally, the photocatalytic activity of the films was assessed in the powder form for the hydrogen evolution reaction and photocurrent generation in a photoelectrochemical cell. The reported work opens opportunities for the controlled synthesis of multifunctional filters for water purification and other energy&#8208;related and sustainable technologies.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The ambiguous bonding situation of &#963;&#8208;E&#8722;H (E = Si, B) complexes in transition metal compounds has been rationalized by means of Density Functional Theory calculations. To this end, the combination of the Energy Decomposition Analysis (EDA) method and its Natural Orbital for Chemical Valance (NOCV) extension has been applied to representative complexes described in the literature where the possible &#951;  1  vs &#951;  2  coordination mode is not unambiguously defined. Our quantitative analyses, which complement previous data based on the application of the Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules (QTAIM) approach, indicate that there exists a continuum between genuine &#951;  1  and &#951;  2  modes depending mainly on the strength of the backdonation. Finally, we also applied this EDA&#8208;NOCV approach to related main&#8208;group species where the backdonation is minimal.</dc:description>

         <title>Bench&#8208;Stable Dinuclear Mn(I) Catalysts in E&#8208;Selective Alkyne Semihydrogenation: A Mechanistic Investigation
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bench&#8208;stable dinuclear Mn hydrides (single&#8208;step &amp; gram&#8208;scale from commercially available materials) have utility in alkyne semihydrogenation where the trans&#8208;alkene is the kinetic product. This selectivity mechanism contrasts typical tandem hydrogenation then isomerization systems.







Abstract
Dinuclear manganese hydride complexes of the form [Mn2(CO)8(&#956;&#8208;H)(&#956;&#8208;PR2)] (R=Ph, 1; R=iPr, 2) were used in E&#8208;selective alkyne semi&#8208;hydrogenation (E&#8208;SASH) catalysis. Catalyst speciation studies revealed rich coordination chemistry and the complexes thus formed were isolated and in turn tested as catalysts; the results underscore the importance of dinuclearity in engendering the observed E&#8208;selectivity and provide insights into the nature of the active catalyst. The insertion product obtained from treating 2 with (cyclopropylethynyl)benzene contains a cis&#8208;alkenyl bridging ligand with the cyclopropyl ring being intact. Treatment of this complex with H2 affords exclusively trans&#8208;(2&#8208;cyclopropylvinyl)benzene. These results, in addition to other control experiments, indicate a non&#8208;radical mechanism for E&#8208;SASH, which is highly unusual for Mn&#8722;H catalysts. The catalytically actives species are virtually inactive towards cis to trans alkene isomerization indicating that the E&#8208;selective process is intrinsic and dinuclear complexes play a critical role. A reaction mechanism is proposed accounting for the observed reactivity which is fully consistent with a kinetic analysis of the rate limiting step and is further supported by DFT computations.

         <title>Enhanced Metal&#8208;Semiconductor Interaction for Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The selective immobilization of noble metals right at the place where photogenerated electrons migrate to via the photodeposition approach is a unique strategy to load cocatalysts on semiconductors for solar hydrogen production. However, a poor metal&#8208;semiconductor interaction is often formed, which not only hinders the interfacial charge transfer, but also results in the easy aggregation and shedding of cocatalysts during photocatalytic reactions. Herein, we demonstrate that the photodeposited ultrafine metals such as nanosized Au can be well stabilized on TiO  2  nanocrystallines without sintering by employing a sacrificial carbon coating annealing strategy to strengthen the metal&#8208;support interaction. Benefiting from the improved interfacial contact between Au and TiO  2  for fast charge transfer and the well&#8208;preserved size&#8208;dependent catalytic behavior of Au nanoparticles toward hydrogen evolution reaction, the annealed Au/TiO  2  exhibits a significant enhanced activity toward photocatalytic H  2  production with good durability.</dc:description>

         <title>Cephem&#8208;Pyrazinoic Acid Conjugates: Circumventing Resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cephem&#8208;pyrazinoic acid (POA) conjugates were synthesized as novel agents for drug&#8208;resistant Tuberculosis (TB). Our strategy circumvents pncA&#8208;linked resistance mutations, which threaten continued use of the first&#8208;line antitubercular pyrazinamide (PZA), and also demonstrates promising activity against other resistant strains and models, achieving a codrug affect through combined action of the dual therapeutic modalities.







Abstract
Tuberculosis (TB) is a leading source of infectious disease mortality globally. Antibiotic&#8208;resistant strains comprise an estimated 10&#8201;% of new TB cases and present an urgent need for novel therapeutics. &#946;&#8208;lactam antibiotics have traditionally been ineffective against M. tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative agent of TB, due to the organism's inherent expression of &#946;&#8208;lactamases that destroy the electrophilic &#946;&#8208;lactam warhead. We have developed novel &#946;&#8208;lactam conjugates, which exploit this inherent &#946;&#8208;lactamase activity to achieve selective release of pyrazinoic acid (POA), the active form of a first&#8208;line TB drug. These conjugates are selectively active against M. tuberculosis and related mycobacteria, and activity is retained or even potentiated in multiple resistant strains and models. Preliminary mechanistic investigations suggest that both the POA &#8220;warhead&#8221; as well as the &#946;&#8208;lactam &#8220;promoiety&#8221; contribute to the observed activity, demonstrating a codrug strategy with important implications for future TB therapy.

         <title>Reactions of Diethylazo&#8208;Dicarboxylate with Frustrated Lewis Pairs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reactions of phosphines and B(C6F5)3 or BPh3 with diethyl azodicarboxylate (DEAD) afforded products with either P&#8722;N/B&#8722;O lor P&#8722;N/B&#8722;N linkages. In all cases, the isomers obtained were computed to be both higher in energy and were readily distinguishable by 31P and 11B&#8197;NMR parameters. Steric demands and electronics are shown to impact the nature of these FLP addition products.







Abstract
Reactions of PAr3/B(C6F5)3 (Ar=o&#8208;Tol, Mes, Ph) FLPs with diethyl azodicarboxylate (DEAD) afford the corresponding FLP addition products 1&#8211;3 in which P&#8722;N and B&#8722;O linkages are formed. In contrast, the reaction of BPh3, PPh3 and DEAD gave product 4 where P&#8722;N and N&#8722;B linkages were confirmed. In all cases, other binding modes were computed to be both higher in energy and readily distinguishable by 31P and 11B&#8197;NMR parameters. These data illustrate the influence of steric demands and electronic structures on the nature of the products of FLP reactions with DEAD.

         <title>Direct Synthesis of Adipic Esters and Adiponitrile via Photoassisted Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Alkene Hydrodimerization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work disclosed a visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced cobalt&#8208;catalyzed tail&#8208;to&#8208;tail hydrodimerization of activated alkenes to 1,4&#8208;difunctional butanes, providing a general route to important industrial intermediates to nylon&#8197;6,6. This protocol is highly efficient for various activated alkenes at ambient temperature utilizing hantzsch ester as a recyclable two&#8208;electron and two&#8208;proton donor with assistant of catalytic amount of base as the proton shuttle.







Abstract
The direct hydrodimerization of acrylates and acrylonitrile offers a general streamlined access to industrially important intermediates to nylon&#8197;6,6. However, a practical catalytic method for this process has thus far underdeveloped owing to the challenges in regioselectivity and environmental compatibility of applied reagents. Here, we report a cobalt&#8208;catalyzed tail&#8208;to&#8208;tail hydrodimerization of activated alkenes driven by a visible&#8208;light photoredox catalysis at ambient temperature, which is applicable to both adipates and adiponitrile synthesis from potentially renewable feedstocks. This protocol utilizes half equivalent of hantzsch ester as a recyclable two&#8208;electron and two&#8208;proton donor with the assistance of catalytic amount of base as a proton shuttle, and has been shown to be highly regioselective and efficient for hydrodimerizing various activated alkenes to 1,4&#8208;difunctionalized butane derivatives.

         <title>Modeling Heme Peroxidase: Heme Saddling Facilitates Reactions with Hyperperoxides To Form High&#8208;Valent FeIV&#8208;Oxo Species</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The saddling structure of the porphyrin ring can not only promote the coordination of the ROOH to the iron center but also give a significant push effect to facilitate the homolysis of the O&#8722;O bond of FeIII&#8208;OOR complexes into high&#8208;valent iron(IV)oxo compounds. The deformation&#8208;induced electronic effect provides heme&#8208;containing peroxidases with another potential mechanism for the O&#8722;O bond cleavage of FeIIIOOH to form high&#8208;valent iron(IV)&#8208;oxo species.







Abstract
Saddle&#8208;shaped hemes have been discovered in the structures of most peroxidases. How such a macrocycle deformation affects the reaction of FeIII hemes with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to form high&#8208;valent Fe&#8208;oxo species remains uncertain. Through examination of the ESI&#8208;MS spectra, absorption changes and 1H NMR chemical shifts, we investigated the reactions of two FeIII porphyrins with different degrees of saddling deformation, namely FeIII(OETPP)ClO4 (1OE) and FeIII(OMTPP)ClO4 (1OM), with tert&#8208;butyl hydroperoxide (tBuOOH) in CH2Cl2 at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C, which quickly resulted in O&#8722;O bond homolysis from a highly unstable FeIII&#8208;alkylperoxo intermediate, FeIII&#8208;O(H)OR (2) into FeIV&#8208;oxo porphyrins (3). Insight into the reaction mechanism was obtained from [tBuOOH]&#8208;dependent kinetics. At &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C, the reaction of 1OE with tBuOOH exhibited an equilibrium constant (Ka=362.3&#8197;M&#8722;1) and rate constant (k=1.87&#215;10&#8722;2&#8197;sM&#8722;&gt;1) for the homolytic cleavage of the 2 O&#8722;O bond that were 2.1 and 1.4 times higher, respectively, than those exhibited by 1OM (Ka=171.8&#8197;M&#8722;1 and k=1.36&#215;10&#8722;2&#8201;&#8201;s&#8722;1). DFT calculations indicated that an FeIII porphyrin with greater saddling deformation can achieve a higher HOMO ([Fe(d
,d
)&#8208;porphyrin(a2u)]) to strengthen the orbital interaction with the LUMO (O&#8722;O bond &#963;*) to facilitate O&#8722;O cleavage.

&lt;/b&gt;), with &lt;i&gt;tert&lt;/i&gt;-butyl hydroperoxide (&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;BuOOH) in CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C, which quickly resulted in O&#8722;O bond homolysis from a highly unstable Fe&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;-alkylperoxo intermediate, Fe&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;-O(H)OR (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;) into Fe&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt;-oxo porphyrins (&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;). Insight into the reaction mechanism was obtained from [&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;BuOOH]-dependent kinetics. At &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C, the reaction of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;sup&gt;OE&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; with &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;BuOOH exhibited an equilibrium constant (&lt;i&gt;K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;=362.3&#8197;M&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and rate constant (&lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;=1.87&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;s&lt;sup&gt;M&#8722;&amp;gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;) for the homolytic cleavage of the &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; O&#8722;O bond that were 2.1 and 1.4 times higher, respectively, than those exhibited by &lt;b&gt;1&lt;sup&gt;OM&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; (&lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;=171.8&#8197;M&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;=1.36&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;&#8201;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). DFT calculations indicated that an Fe&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; porphyrin with greater saddling deformation can achieve a higher HOMO ([Fe(d
,d
)-porphyrin(a&lt;sub&gt;2u&lt;/sub&gt;)]) to strengthen the orbital interaction with the LUMO (O&#8722;O bond &#963;*) to facilitate O&#8722;O cleavage.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Understanding of Photo&#8208;Induced Reversible Rearrangement from Borepin to Borirane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multi&#8208;reference calculations with the CASPT2//CASSCF method have established detailed mechanisms for the photo&#8208;induced reversible isomerization between a borepin and a borirane, in which the (S1/S0)x intersection seam plays crucial roles.







Abstract
The first reversible photoisomerization between a borepin and a borirane was reported in the photo&#8208;induced reactions of B(npy)Ar2 (npy=2&#8208;(naphthalen&#8208;1&#8208;yl) pyridine, Ar=phenyl or electron rich aryl; S. Wang, et&#8197;al. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2019, 58, 6683&#8211;6687). In this work, the detailed mechanisms of the unprecedented reversible photoisomerization between the borepin (compound a) and the borirane (compound b) of B(npy)Ph2 in the first excited singlet (S1) state and the ground (S0) state were studied by carrying out calculations with the complete active space self&#8208;consistent field (CASSCF) and its second&#8208;order perturbation (CASPT2) methods combined with time&#8208;dependent density functional theory (TD&#8208;DFT). The calculation results show that photoexcitation of a&#8208;S0 at 365&#8197;nm and b&#8208;S0 at 450&#8197;nm populate their S1 state with evident charge transfer characteristics. The photoisomerization is triggered in the S1 state and ends in the S0 state, at which the intersection points in a (S1/S0)x intersection seam participate in and promote phenyl migration and ring&#8208;closure processes. Furthermore, we reveal that the not large energy difference (less than 0.6&#8197;eV) and similar conjugation properties of &#960; electrons between a&#8208;S0 and b&#8208;S0 are responsible for their unique photo&#8208;reversible reactivity, compared with those of the isomers of the thermally reversible compound B(ppy)Mes2. Our results contribute to an understanding of the excited&#8208;state reactivity of organoboron compounds and will be useful to support the design of new boron&#8208;based photo&#8208;responsive materials.

         <dc:description>The field of molecular transition metal complexes with redox&#8208;active ligands is dominated by compounds with one or two units of the same redox&#8208;active ligand; complexes in which different redox&#8208;active ligands are bound to the same metal are uncommon.

         <title>Rational Tuning of the Reactivity of Three&#8208;Membered Heterocycle Ring&#8208;Openings via SN2 Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of small molecule covalent inhibitors and probes continuously pushes the rapidly evolving field of chemical biology forward. A key element in these molecular tool compounds is the &#8220;electrophilic trap&#8221; that allows for a covalent linkage with the target enzyme. The reactivity of this entity needs to be well balanced to effectively trap the desired enzyme, while not being attacked by off&#8208;target nucleophiles. We here investigate the intrinsic reactivity of substrates containing a class of widely used electrophilic traps, the three&#8208;membered heterocycles with an N&#8208; (aziridine), P&#8208; (phosphirane), O&#8208; (epoxide) and S&#8208;atom (thiirane) as heteroatom. Using quantum chemical approaches, we studied the conformational flexibility and nucleophilic ring&#8208;opening reaction of a series of model substrates, in which these electrophilic traps are mounted on a cyclohexene scaffold (C6H10Y with Y = NH, PH, O, S). It is revealed that the activation energy of the ring&#8208;opening reaction does not necessarily follow the trend that is expected from C&#8211;Y leaving&#8208;group bond strength, but steeply decreases from NH, to PH, to O, to S. We illustrate that the HOMONu&#8211;LUMOSubstrate interaction is an all&#8208;important factor for the observed reactivity. In addition, we show that the activation energy of aziridines and phosphiranes can be tuned far below that of the corresponding epoxides and thiiranes by the addition of proper electron&#8208;withdrawing ring substituents. Our results provide mechanistic insights to rationally tune the reactivity of this class of popular electrophilic traps and can guide the experimental design of covalent inhibitors and probes for enzymatic activity.</dc:description>

Selective for selenate: An enzyme&#8208;based selenate reductase sensor has been developed for the detection of selenate. Under optimum conditions, the calibration curve was linear up to 3900.0&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;L&#8722;1 with a detection limit of 4.97&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;L&#8722;1. The recovery of selenate in real water samples was analyzed and the sensor's reliability was confirmed.

Abstract
An enzymatic biosensor has been developed for the determination of selenate (SeO42&#8722;), in which selenate reductase (SeR) is chemically attached to a gold disk electrode by lipoic acid N&#8208;hydroxysuccinimide ester as linker, allowing the catalytic reduction of the SeO42&#8722; to SeO32&#8722;. Modification of the gold electrode was characterized by X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary ion mass spectroscopy (ToF&#8208;SIMS), and electrochemistry. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) measurements were performed in different buffers for selenate determination. Under optimum conditions, the calibration curve was linear over the range 7.0&#8211;3900.0&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;L&#8722;1 with limits of detection and quantification of 4.97 and 15.56&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;L&#8722;1, respectively. The possible interference of the relevant oxyanions SO42&#8722;, NO3&#8722;, NO2&#8722;, PO43&#8722; and AsO43&#8722; in the determination of SeO42&#8722; was studied. Finally, the proposed biosensor was used to determine SeO42&#8722; with recovery between 95.2 and 102.4&#8201;% in different real water samples.

&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;), in which selenate reductase (SeR) is chemically attached to a gold disk electrode by lipoic acid &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-hydroxysuccinimide ester as linker, allowing the catalytic reduction of the SeO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; to SeO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;. Modification of the gold electrode was characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectroscopy (ToF-SIMS), and electrochemistry. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) measurements were performed in different buffers for selenate determination. Under optimum conditions, the calibration curve was linear over the range 7.0&#8211;3900.0&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;L&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; with limits of detection and quantification of 4.97 and 15.56&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;L&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively. The possible interference of the relevant oxyanions SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and AsO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; in the determination of SeO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; was studied. Finally, the proposed biosensor was used to determine SeO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; with recovery between 95.2 and 102.4&#8201;% in different real water samples.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>General Design Strategy of Anti&#8208;aromatic Porphyrinoids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We summarized six strategies to construct a high anti&#8208;aromatic porphyrinoid: 1)&#8197;Constructing a (4n) &#960;&#8208;electron anti&#8208;aromatic system; 2)&#8197;Increasing the number of pyrrole/thiophene/furan units on the &#960;&#8208;electron current ring flowing pipe; 3)&#8197;The heteroatom selecting order is &#8722;O&#8722; (optimal choice), &#8722;NH&#8722; (second choice), and &#8722;S&#8722; (last choice); 4)&#8197;The C&#8722;C=C&#8722;C unit is not beneficial for the anti&#8208;aromatic properties; 5)&#8197;Avoiding the crowded groups in the core space of an anti&#8208;aromatic macrocycle; 6)&#8197;The &#8220;circular&#8221; macrocycle is the best skeleton.







Abstract
A systematic investigation to arrange the typical anti&#8208;aromatic porphyrinoids in sequence was performed. Based on density functional theory calculations, six rules are summarized to obtain the high&#8208;performance anti&#8208;aromatic porphyrinoids: (1)&#8197;when two atoms are deleted/added on the 18&#960; electron current ring flowing pipe, we will immediately obtain a 16&#960;/20&#960; electron anti&#8208;aromatic system; (2)&#8197;it is a good idea to increase the number of pyrrole/thiophen/furan units on the &#960;&#8208;electron current ring flowing pipe; (3)&#8197;the heteroatom selecting order is &#8722;O&#8722; (optimal choice), &#8722;NH&#8722; (second choice), and &#8722;S&#8722; (last choice); (4)&#8197;it is worth noting that the C&#8722;C=C&#8722;C unit is not beneficial for the anti&#8208;aromatic properties; (5)&#8197;it is very significant to avoid the crowded environment in the core space of an anti&#8208;aromatic molecule. In this view, &#8722;O&#8722; is much better than &#8722;S&#8722; and &#8722;NH&#8722;; (6)&#8197;the &#8220;circular&#8221; skeleton is much better than an &#8220;ellipse&#8208;like&#8221;, &#8220;rectangular&#8221;, or &#8220;parallelogram&#8208;like&#8221; one.

         <title>From Nanoparticle Ensembles to Single Nanoparticles: Techniques for the Investigation of Plasmon Enhanced Electrochemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The progress of plasmon enhanced electrochemistry (PEEC) in terms of three types of electrochemical methods (macroscopic PEEC measurements, PEEC based on scanning electrochemical microscope, and PEEC based on nano&#8208;impact electrochemistry) is discussed in this Concept article.







Abstract
Plasmon enhanced electrochemistry (PEEC), where specific electrochemical reactions are promoted due to the reduced energy barrier of the reaction processes by the light excited &#8220;hot carriers&#8221; of the plasmonic nanoparticles, has aroused tremendous interest in recent years. A deep understanding of the PEEC process becomes a key issue for facilitating PEEC catalyst design and improving PEEC performance. This concept article begins with a brief discussion of the macroscopic electrochemical method of PEEC study of the plasmonic nanoparticle ensembles. Following that, we highlight two electrochemical techniques that may possess single nanoparticle sensitivity, i.&#8201;e., scanning electrochemical microscope and nano&#8208;impact electrochemistry. The pros and cons of each technique are discussed and an outlook is given. We hope to provide the readers with the current status of PEEC to evoke reflections regarding the reaction mechanisms, performance improvement, and the utilizations to important systems.

         <title>Proton Conduction at High Temperature in High&#8208;Symmetry Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Molecular Crystals of RuIII Complexes with Six Imidazole&#8208;Imidazolate Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new H&#8208;bonded crystal of [RuIII(Him)3(Im)3](1) with six HIm (imidazole) was prepared so as to obtain a high&#8208;temperature proton conductor. The crystal is constructed through N&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N&#8722;H&#8208;bonds between the inter&#8208;RuIII complexes and has a rare Icy&#8208;c* cubic net without crystal anisotropy. The proton conductivity is due not only to rotations and hopping motions of HIm, but also induced by isotropic whole&#8208;molecule rotation of 1.







Abstract
A new H&#8208;bonded crystal [RuIII(Him)3(Im)3] with three imidazole (Him) and three imidazolate (Im&#8722;) groups was prepared to obtain a higher&#8208;temperature proton conductor than a Nafion membrane with water driving. The crystal is constructed by complementary N&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N H&#8208;bonds between the RuIII complexes and has a rare Icy&#8208;c* cubic network topology with a twofold interpenetration without crystal anisotropy. The crystals show a proton conductivity of 3.08&#215;10&#8722;5&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 450&#8197;K and a faster conductivity than those formed by only HIms. The high proton conductivity is attributed to not only molecular rotations and hopping motions of HIm frameworks that are activated at &#8764;113&#8197;K, but also isotropic whole&#8208;molecule rotation of [RuIII(Him)3(Im)3] at temperatures greater than 420&#8197;K. The latter rotation was confirmed by solid&#8208;state 2H&#8197;NMR spectroscopy; probable proton conduction routes were predicted and theoretically considered.

         <title>Chemoselective Acylation of Nucleosides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemoselective functionalization of oxygen atoms versus nitrogen atoms in bifunctional and polyfunctional molecules is a long&#8208;standing challenge in both fundamental chemistry and in complex molecule synthesis. Different conditions that allow high selectivity in the derivatization of complex nucleosides that contain both O&#8208; and N&#8208;based functionalities are described. Particularly intriguing cases are also presented, in which the reactivity of the O&#8208; and N&#8208;based functionalities is quite context dependent, exhibiting reactivity that blurs conventional considerations, yet where selectivity may also be observed.







Abstract
Acylated nucleoside analogues play an important role in medicinal chemistry and are extremely useful precursors to various other nucleoside analogues. However, chemoselective acylation of nucleosides usually requires several protection and deprotection steps due to the competing nucleophilicity of hydroxy and amino groups. In contrast, direct protecting&#8208;group&#8208;free chemoselective acylation of nucleosides is a preferred strategy due to lower cost and fewer overall synthetic steps. Herein, a simple and efficient chemoselective acylation of nucleosides and nucleotides under mild reaction conditions, giving either O&#8208; or N&#8208;acylated products respectively with excellent chemoselectivity is reported.

In contrast, direct protecting-group-free chemoselective acylation of nucleosides is a preferred strategy due to lower cost and fewer overall synthetic steps. Herein, a simple and efficient chemoselective acylation of nucleosides and nucleotides under mild reaction conditions, giving either &lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;- or &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-acylated products respectively with excellent chemoselectivity is reported.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Coordination adaptable networks: zirconium(IV) carboxylates.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Vitrimers are 3D &#8220;covalent adaptable networks&#8221; (CANs) with flow properties thanks to thermally activated associative exchange reactions. The present contribution introduces coordination adaptable networks, or CooANs, that are topologically related to metal&#8208;organic frameworks with octahedral Zr  6  clusters as secondary building units in a carboxylic acid&#8208;functionalized acrylate&#8208;methacrylate copolymer matrix. A series of  Zr&#8208;CooAN&#8208;x  materials (x = percent of Zr  6  loading relative to maximum capacity) was synthesized with x = 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 50 and 100. The mechanical and rheological investigations demonstrate vitrimer&#8208;like properties for x up to 50, the crosslink migration being ensured by carboxylate ligand exchange, with relaxation becoming slower as the Zr  6  content is increased. The flow activation energy of  Zr&#8208;CooAN&#8208;10  is 92.9 &#177; 3.6 kJ mol  &#8208;1  . Rapid (30 min) hot&#8208;press reshaping occurs at temperatures in the 50&#8208;100 &#176;C range under a 3&#8208;ton pressure and does not significantly alter the material properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanistic Studies for the Rational Design of Multivalent Glycodendrimers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have synthesized B&#8208;antigen&#8208;displaying dendrimers (16&#8208;mers) with different sizes and evaluated their affinity to their IgM antibody in order to investigate which design features lead to effective multivalency. Unexpectedly, the smallest dendrimer, which cannot chelate the multiple binding sites of IgM, clearly exhibited multivalency, together with an affinity similar to or higher than those of the larger dendrimers. These results indicate that the statistical rebinding model, which involves the rapid exchange of clustered glycans, significantly contributes to the multivalency of glycodendrimers. Namely, in the design of glycodendrimers, high&#8208;density glycan presentation to enhance statistical rebinding should be considered in addition to the ability to chelate multiple binding sites. This notion stands in contrast to the currently prevailing scientific consensus, which prioritizes the chelation model. This study thus provides new and important guidelines for molecular design of glycodendrimers.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlling the Emissive, Chiroptical, and Electrochemical Properties of Double [7]Helicenes through Embedded Aromatic Rings</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present here the synthesis and in&#8208;depth physicochemical characterization of a double hetero[7]helicene fused with four triazole rings at both helical ends. The comparison of this triazole&#8208;fused double helicene with the previously reported all&#8208;carbon and thiadiazole&#8208;fused analogs revealed the huge impact of the embedded aromatic rings on the photophysical features. The small structural variation of the terminal rings from thiadiazole to triazole caused a dramatic change of the photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) from &lt;1% to 96%, while the replacement of the terminal benzene rings with triazole rings induced a tenfold enhancement of the circularly polarized luminescence dissymmetry factor. These observations were well corroborated with transient absorption analysis and/or theoretic calculations. In addition, the triazole&#8208;fused double helicene exhibited ambipolar redox behavior, enabling the generation of radical cation and anion species by electrochemical and chemical methods and showing its potential for spin&#8208;related applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Cage&#8208;Shaped Borates Bearing Pyrenylmethyl Groups: Efficient Lewis Acid Catalyst for Photoactivated Glycosylations Driven by Intramolecular Excimer Formation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We describe the synthesis and characterization of a photoactivated boron&#8208;based Lewis acid catalyst based on a cage&#8208;shaped triphenolic ligand with three pyrenylmethyl moieties. The obtained cage&#8208;shaped borate functioned as a photoactivated Lewis acid catalyst thanks to the flexible three pyrenylmethyl moieties. The deformation of the cage&#8208;shaped scaffold driven by intramolecular excimer formations of the pyrenes is a critical factor in realizing the photoactivation. Mannich&#8208;type reactions and glycosylations significantly were accelerated under 370 nm light irradiations. It is noteworthy that various glycosyl fluorides, which are not easily activated in photocatalytic systems due to their high C&#8210;F bond stability, are activated by the photoimproved catalytic activity of the catalyst.</dc:description>

         <title>Two Paths to Oxidative C&#8722;H Amination Under Basic Conditions: A Theoretical Case Study Reveals Hidden Opportunities Provided by Electron Upconversion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Traditionally, cross&#8208;dehydrogenative coupling (CDC) leads to C&#8722;N bond formation under basic and oxidative conditions and is proposed to proceed via a two&#8208;electron bond formation mediated by carbenium ions. However, the formation of such high&#8208;energy intermediates is only possible in the presence of strong oxidants, which may lead to undesired side reactions and poor functional group tolerance. In this work, we explore if oxidation under basic conditions allows the formation of three&#8208;electron bonds (resulting in &#8220;upconverted&#8221; highly reducing radical&#8208;anions). The benefit of this &#8220;upconversion&#8221; process is in the ability to use milder oxidants (e.g., O  2  ) and to avoid high&#8208;energy intermediates. Comparison of the two&#8208; and three&#8208;electron pathways using quantum mechanical calculations reveals that not only does the absence of a strong oxidant shut down two&#8208;electron pathways in favor of a three&#8208;electron path but, paradoxically, weaker oxidants react faster with the upconverted reductants by avoiding the Marcus inverted region for electron transfer.</dc:description>

         <title>A Chemically Fuelled Molecular Automaton Displaying Programmed Migration of Zn2+ Between Alternative Binding Sites</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A molecular system comprising a cationic zinc complex and an amino acid&#8208;derived ambident ligand having phosphate and carboxylate binding sites undergoes a series of rearrangements in which the metal cation migrates autonomously from one site to another. The location of the metal is identified by the circular dichroism spectrum of a ligated bis(2&#8208;quinolylmethyl)&#8208;(2&#8208;pyridylmethyl)amine (BQPA) chromophore, which takes a characteristic shape at each binding site. Migration is fuelled by the decomposition of trichloroacetic acid to CO2 and CHCl3 , which progressively neutralises the acidity of the system as a function of time, revealing in sequence binding sites of increasing basicity. The migration rate responds to control by variation of the temperature, water content and triethylamine concentration, while an excess of fuel controls the duration of an induction period before the migration event.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure of Zinc and Nickel Histidine Complexes in Solution Revealed by Molecular Dynamics and Raman Optical Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The histidine residue has an exceptional affinity for metals, but solution structure of its complexes are difficult to study. For zinc and nickel, we used Raman and Raman optical activity (ROA) spectroscopies to investigate the link between spectral shapes and the geometry. The spectra were measured and interpreted on the basis of ionic equilibria, molecular dynamics, ab initio molecular dynamics, and density functional theory. For zwitterionic histidine the dominant tautomer was determined by the decomposition of experimental spectra into calculated subspectra. An octahedral structure was found to prevail for the ZnHis  2  complex in solution, in contrast to a tetrahedral arrangement in the crystal phase. The solution geometry of NiHis  2  is more similar to the octahedral structure found by x&#8208;ray. The Raman and ROA structural determinations of metal complexes are dependent on extensive computations, but reveal unique information about the studied systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Coassembly of Chiral Amines and a Four&#8208;Armed Cyano&#8208;Substituted Luminophore through Hydrogen bonds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chirality transfer from chiral molecules to assemblies is of vital importance to the design of functional chiral materials. In this work, we report the selective co&#8208;assembly behaviors between chiral molecules and an achiral luminophore, potentially driven by the intermolecular salt&#8208;bridge type hydrogen bonds. Cyano&#8208;substituted tetrakis(arylthio)benzene carboxylic acid (  TA  ) served as the luminophore and hydrogen bond donors, which underwent co&#8208;assembly with different chiral amines. It was found that structures of chiral amines affect the chirality transfer and the properties of coassemblies due to effects on hydrogen bonds and stacking pattern. Only in specific co&#8208;assemblies, the chiroptical properties occurred at both ground state and excited states based on the emerged Cotton effects and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) signals, revealing the chirality successfully transferred from molecular level to supramolecular level. In addition, accurate quantitative examination of chiral amines was realized by circular dichroism (CD) spectra. This work demonstrates the characteristic chirality response and transfer  via  co&#8208;assembly, providing a potential method to develop smart chiroptical materials.</dc:description>

         <title>An encapsulated neutral ruthenium catalyst for substrateselective oxidation of alcohols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The neutral complex dichloro&#8208;{diethyl[(5&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1,3,4oxadiazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylamino)&#8208;(4&#8208;trifluoro&#8208;methylphenyl)methyl]phosphonate} ( p &#8208;cymene)&#8208;ruthenium(II) was encapsulated inside a self&#8208;assembled hexameric host obtained upon reaction of 2,8,14,20&#8208;tetra&#8208;undecylresorcin[4]arene with water. The formation of an inclusion complex was inferred from a combination of spectral measurements (MS, UVvisible spectroscopy, 1 H and DOSY NMR). The 31 P and 19 F NMR spectra are consistent with motions of the ruthenium complex inside the self&#8208;assembled capsule. Molecular dynamics simulations carried out on the inclusion complex confirmed these intra&#8208;cavity movements and highlighted possible supramolecular interactions between the ruthenium first coordination sphere ligands and the inner&#8208;part (aromatic rings) of the capsule. The embedded ruthenium complex was assessed in the catalytic oxidation (using NaIO 4 as oxidant) of mixtures of three arylmethyl alcohols into the corresponding aldehydes. The reaction kinetics were shown to vary as a function of the substrates' size, with the oxidation rate varying in the order benzylalcohol &gt; 4&#8208;phenyl&#8208;benzylalcohol &gt; 9&#8208;anthracenemethanol. Control experiments realized in the absence of hexameric capsule did not allow any discrimination between the substrates.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The mechanism of oxy&#8208;arylation/vinylation of alkenes catalyzed by the (MeDalphos)AuCl complex  was comprehensively investigated by DFT. (P,N)Au(Ph)  2+  and (P,N)Au(vinyl)  2+  are key intermediates accounting for the activation of the alkenols and for their cyclization by outer&#8208;sphere nucleophilic attack of oxygen. The 5&#8208;  exo  and 6&#8208;  endo  paths have been computed and compared, reproducing the peculiar regioselectivity difference observed experimentally between  4&#8208;penten&#8208;1&#8208;ol, (  E  ) and (  Z  )&#8208;4&#8208;hexen&#8208;1&#8208;ols. Examining the way the alkenol coordinates to gold (more  h  2  or  h  1  ) can offer, in some cases, a simple way to predict the favoured path of cyclization.</dc:description>

Formally, the &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems of the pristine azaborole helicenes were enlarged with a phenanthrene unit leading to compounds with large Stokes shifts, significantly enhanced luminescence quantum yields (&#1060;) and dissymmetry factors (  g  lum  ).

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) organic absorbers, named FNs and FPs, have been obtained with absorption maxima from 870 nm to 1100 nm and thus falling into the attractive second near&#8208;infrared region (NIR&#8208;II). The synthesis of their extended aromatic cores utilized an initial aryl&#8208;amination between 4&#8208;aminonaphthalene&#8208;1,8&#8208;dicarboximide (NMI&#8208;NH2) or 9&#8208;aminoperylene&#8208;3,4&#8208;dicarboximide (PMI&#8208;NH2) with chloro&#8208;substituted 9,10&#8208;anthraquinones followed by a novel base&#8208;induced cyclodehydrogenation. A NIR&#8208;II pigment, compound FPP, was obtained through de&#8208;alkylation of a soluble precursor. The synthesis of this photostable pigment is high&#8208;yielding and avoids column chromatographic purification which is important for many applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular design of silicon&#8208;containing diazenes: absorbance of E and Z isomers in near&#8208;infrared region</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The effective use of photochromic systems based on azo compounds in a number of applications, especially biomedical and pharmacological ones, is impeded by the unresolved problem of their  E  &#8646;  Z  isomerization in the near&#8208;IR region, NIR (780&#8208;1400 nm). We have demonstrated at the TD&#8208;DFT, STEOM&#8208;DLPNO&#8208;CCSD and CASSCF&#8208;NEVPT2 levels of theory that the presence of a silylated diazene core &#8208;Si&#8208;N=N&#8208;Si&#8208; with three&#8208;, tetra&#8208; or five&#8208;coordinated silicon atoms practically guarantees the absorption of the  E  and  Z  forms of such derivatives in NIR and the amazing (185&#8208;400 nm) separation of their first absorption bands. In particular, the maximum  &#955;  1  of the first n&#8594;&#960;* band of the  E  isomer of azosilabenzene  ASiB  is at ~1030 nm, while for the  Z  isomer  &#955;  1  &#8773; 1340 nm. Based on the found bistable azo compounds (  ASiB  , bis(silyl)&#8208;  SiD  and bis(silatranyl)&#8208;  SaD  diazenes) and their derivatives with  E  and  Z  absorption in NIR, unique photoswitches can be created for a number of applications, in particular, for photothermal therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Cross&#8208;Coupling of Thioesters and Organomanganese Reagents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a Fukuyama&#8208;type coupling of thioesters with aliphatic organomanganese reagents utilizing a cheap and easily available iron(III) precatalyst. The reactions exhibit a wide tolerance of solvents and functional groups, allowing for the conversion of thioesters derived from natural products and pharmaceutical compounds. A strong steric impact from each reaction component (carboxylic moiety, thiol substituent and manganese reagent) was displayed, which enabled regioselective transformation of dithioesters. Mechanistic investigations showed that the released thiolate does not act as a mere spectator ligand, but rather positively influences the stability of intermediate alkyl(II)ferrates.</dc:description>

         <title>Construction of Photo&#8208;Responsive Pd2L4 Type Nanocage based on Feringa&#8217;s Second&#8208;Generation Motor and Its Guest Binding Ability for C60</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present the construction of a M  2  L  4  type metal&#8208;organic nanocage featuring four endohedral Feringa&#8217;s motor motifs and its adaptive encapsulation towards C  60  guest molecule. The structure of the cage, though complicated on the  1  H NMR spectrum due to the adoption of mixed ligands, was unambiguously characterized with a combination of ESI&#8208;MS, 2D DOSY,  13  C NMR and particularly the SAXS technique. The molecular motor within the cage demonstrated similar photophysical properties to the uncoordinated one, indicating the motor&#8217;s function was not compromised when it was anchored in such a confined nanospace. Furthermore, the nanocage showed good guest encapsulation ability towards C  60  , and a guest induced&#8208;fit behavior of the cage was revealed based on the extensive SAXS analysis and molecular dynamics simulation. The adaptive motorized nanocage reported here represents one of the very few examples of integrating individual motors into a discrete nanoconfined system and offers prospects to achieve its non&#8208;equilibrium functions.</dc:description>

         <title>Discovery of Complex Binding and Reaction Mechanisms from Ternary Gases in Rare Earth Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Understanding the selectivity of metal organic frameworks (MOFs) to complex acid gas streams will enable their use in industrial applications. Herein, ab initio molecular dynamic simulations (AIMD) were used to simulate ternary gas mixtures (H  2  O&#8208;NO  2  &#8208;SO  2  )&#160;in rare earth 2,5&#8208;dihydroxyterephthalic acid (RE&#8208;DOBDC) MOFs. Stronger H  2  O gas&#8208;metal binding arose from thermal vibrations in the MOF sterically hindering access of SO  2  and NO  2  molecules to the metal sites. Gas&#8208;gas and gas&#8208;linker interactions within the MOF framework resulted in the formation of multiple secondary gas species including HONO, HNO  2  , NOSO, and HNO  3  &#8208;  . Four gas adsorption sites were identified along with a new de&#8208;protonation reaction mechanism not observable through experiment. This study not only provides valuable information on competitive gas binding energies in the MOF, it also provides important chemical insights into transient chemical reactions and mechanisms.</dc:description>

         <title>Switching Chirophilic Self&#8208;assembly: From meso&#8208;structures to Conglomerates in Liquid and Liquid Crystalline Network Phases of Achiral Polycatenar Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Spontaneous generation of chirality from achiral molecules is a contemporary research topic with numerous implications for technological applications and for the understanding of the development of homogeneous chirality in biosystems. Herein, a series of azobenzene based rod&#8208;like molecules with an 3,4,5&#8208;trialkylated end and a single  n&#8208;  alkyl chain involving 5 to 20 aliphatic carbons at the opposite end is reported. Depending on the chain length and temperature these achiral molecules self&#8208;assemble into a series of liquid and liquid crystalline (LC) helical network phases. A chiral isotropic liquid (Iso  1  [  *  ]  ) and a cubic triple network phase with chiral  I  23 lattice were found for the short chain compounds, whereas non&#8208;cubic and achiral cubic phases dominate for the long chain compounds. Among them a mesoscale conglomerate with  I  23 lattice, a tetragonal phase (Tet  bi  ) containing one chirality synchronized and one non&#8208;synchronized achiral network, an achiral double network  meso&#8208;  structure with  Ia  d  space group and an achiral percolated isotropic liquid mesophase (Iso  1  ) were found. This sequence is attributed to an increasing strength of chirality synchronization between the networks, combined with a change of the preferred mode of chirophilic self&#8208;assembly between the networks, switching from enantiophilic to enantiophobic with decreasing chain length and lowering temperature. These nanostructured and mirror symmetry broken LC phases exist over wide temperature ranges which is of interest for potential applications in chiral and photosensitive functional materials derived from achiral compounds.</dc:description>
