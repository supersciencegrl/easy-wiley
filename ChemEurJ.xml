         <title>D&#8722;&#960;&#8722;A Type [7]Helicene&#8208;like Imide Derivatives with Tunable Photophysical Properties and Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Helicenes and their derivatives show great application prospects as circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) materials, but their fluorescence quantum yields (&#934;FLs) need a breakthrough urgently. Herein, we reported a series of D&#8722;&#960;&#8722;A type helical luminescent emitters by combining the [7]helicene&#8208;like imide acceptor with five different donors. The obtained five emitters display blue&#8208;to&#8208;orange luminescence and markedly enhanced &#934;FL. Notably, TPA&#8208;NiBTI exhibits the maximum &#934;FL in solution, while TPE&#8208;NiBTI achieves a maximum &#934;FL in the solid state. Their two pairs of enantiomers, (P/M)&#8208;TPA&#8208;NiBTI and (P/M)&#8208;TPE&#8208;NiBTI, exhibit remarkable CPL activities, and their doped PS film both displayed doubled &#934;FLs. Among them, [(P/M)&#8208;TPE&#8208;NiBTI]&#8208;doped PS film exhibits the maximum luminescence dissymmetry factor (|glum|) value of 9.0&#215;10&#8722;4 and the maximum &#934;FL of 22%. This molecular design strategy presents a promising approach to improving the &#934;FL of helicene derivatives, thereby facilitating their potential application into chiral optoelectronic devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlling Chemoselectivity in Ruthenium(II)&#8208;Induced Cyclization of Aniline&#8208;Functionalized Alkynes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The cyclization of heteroatom&#8208;functionalized alkynes induced by d6&#8208;transition&#8208;metal centers has traditionally been associated with the vinylidene pathway. However, recent evidence suggests that d6&#8208;transition&#8208;metal centers can also activate alkynes through non&#8208;vinylidene pathways. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive experimental and theoretical investigation into the reactions between the Ru(II) complex [Ru([9]aneS3)(bpy)(OH2)]2+ and 2&#8208;alkynylanilines. Our study revealed that the selectivity between the vinylidene and non&#8208;vinylidene pathways can be tuned by reaction temperature, substrate, and solvent polarity. This strategic control allows for the preferential formation of either C2&#8208; or C3&#8208;metalated indole zwitterion complexes. Additionally, we identified a rare decyclization mechanism that enables the conversion of C2&#8208;metalated indoles to C3&#8208;metalated indoles, underscoring the significance of product stability in these pathways. Overall, this work demonstrates practical approaches to control the preference between vinylidene and non&#8208;vinylidene pathways, which is crucial for the design of new catalysts and metalated heterocyclic complexes.</dc:description>

         <title>Innovative On&#8208;Resin and in Solution Peptidomimetics Synthesis via Metal&#8208;Free Photocatalytic Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nowadays, peptidomimetics are widely studied, being useful tools in drug discovery and medicinal chemistry. The coupling between a carboxylic acid with an amine to form a peptide bond is the most common reaction to obtain peptides/peptidomimetics. In this work, we have investigated an innovative metal&#8208;free photoredox&#8208;catalyzed carbamoylation to form peptidomimetics thanks to the reaction between dihydropyridines functionalized with amino acids (or peptide sequences) and differently functionalized imines. As the organic photocatalyst, we used 4CzIPN, a donor&#8208;acceptor cyanoarene vastly used in photoredox catalysis. By easily modulating the amino acid (or peptide sequence), which is directly attached to the dihydropyridine, we proposed this key&#8208;reaction as new valuable method to obtain peptidomimetics, in situ building the not&#8208;natural portion of the sequence. Moreover, we successfully employed this methodology in solid phase peptide synthesis, both inserting the new photoredox&#8208;generated amino acid at the end or in the middle of the sequence. Peptides with different lengths and secondary structures were prepared, proving the success of this approach, even in sterically hindered environment. Herein, to the best of our knowledge, we describe the first photocatalytic protocol which allows the building of the peptide backbone, with the possibility of simultaneously inserting a non&#8208;coded amino acid in the sequence.</dc:description>

         <title>Versatile Metal&#8208;Free Arylation of BODIPY and Bis(BF2) Chromophores by Using Arylazosulfones in a Sunflow System</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Given the importance of BODIPYs and BIS(BF2)&#8208;based chromophores for biological applications and the limited related synthetic strategies toward functionalization, we report an environmentally friendly and practical protocol to promote their direct arylation under sunlight with arylazosulfones as aryl radical surrogates. In total, twenty&#8208;two arylated compounds were obtained under the established conditions including the chromophores BODIPY and BOPPY.







Abstract
BODIPYs have a well&#8208;established role in biological sciences as chemosensors and versatile biological markers due to their chemical reactivity, which allows for fine&#8208;tuning of their photophysical characteristics. In this work, we combined the unique reactivity of arylazo sulfones with the advantages of a &#8220;sunflow&#8221; reactor to develop a fast, efficient, and versatile method for the photochemical arylation of BODIPYs and other chromophores. This approach resulted in red&#8208;shifted emitting fluorophores due to extended electronic delocalization at the 3&#8208; and 5&#8208;positions of the BODIPY core. This method represents an advantageous approach for BODIPY functionalization compared to existing strategies.

         <title>Review on Catalytic Meinwald Rearrangement of Epoxides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This comprehensive review encapsulates the applications of Meinwald rearrangement and the rearranged products as precursors of carbonyl compounds for the further transformations. It is expected that this review can inspire chemists to continuously contribute to this field and further promote the development of Meinwald rearrangement, and provide efficient access to high&#8208;value molecules.







Abstract
The past few decades have witnessed tremendous development within epoxides. Among the many known reactions involving epoxide, Meinwald rearrangements represent one of the most important and attractive approaches, which can transform epoxides into versatile carbonyl compounds. Given the high efficiency of this protocol, substantial efforts have been made by researchers by utilizing multiple catalyst systems. This review provides an overview of recent advances in the Meinwald rearrangement (from 2014 onward), along with detailed discussions on mechanistic insights. This review aims to highlight the importance and value of these methodologies, thereby promoting further investigation and application.

         <title>Facile Access to Terminal Nitroalkanes via Anti&#8208;Markovnikov Hydronitration and Hydronitroalkylation of Alkenes Using Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The evolution of catalysis and functional group transfer reagents play a significant role in the development of anti&#8208;Markovnikov alkene hydrofunctionalization reactions, facilitating the access to value&#8208;added molecules. We herein report the first rational design of a modular intermolecular anti&#8208;Markovnikov hydronitration of alkenes, enabling the direct synthesis of terminal nitroalkanes under visible light&#8208;mediated photoredox catalysis. By employing the redox&#8208;active organic nitrating reagent N&#8208;nitrosuccinimide, the produced nitryl radicals, in the presence of an olefin and a hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) mediator, lead to an anti&#8208;Markovnikov addition with complete regioselectivity. Furthermore, we present results demonstrating the use of this catalytic system for chain expansion via anti&#8208;Markovnikov addition, utilizing substituted bromonitroalkanes as commercially available reagents.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The evolution of catalysis and functional group transfer reagents play a significant role in the development of anti-Markovnikov alkene hydrofunctionalization reactions, facilitating the access to value-added molecules. We herein report the first rational design of a modular intermolecular anti-Markovnikov hydronitration of alkenes, enabling the direct synthesis of terminal nitroalkanes under visible light-mediated photoredox catalysis.

         <title>Resolving the Structure of a Guanine Quadruplex in TMPRSS2 Messenger RNA by Circular Dichroism and Molecular Modeling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The presence of a guanine quadruplex in the opening reading frame of the messenger RNA coding for the transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) may pave the way to original anticancer and host&#8208;oriented antiviral strategy. Indeed, TMPRSS2 in addition to being overexpressed in different cancer types, is also related to the infection of respiratory viruses, including SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2, by promoting the cellular and viral membrane fusion through its proteolytic activity. The design of selective ligands targeting TMPRSS2 messenger RNA requires a detailed knowledge, at atomic level, of its structure. Therefore, we have used an original experimental&#8208;computational protocol to predict the first resolved structure of the parallel guanine quadruplex secondary structure in the RNA of TMPRSS2, which shows a rigid core flanked by a flexible loop. This represents the first atomic scale structure of the guanine quadruplex structure present in TMPRSS2 messenger RNA.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Enantioselective Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Cross&#8208;Coupling of Aldehydes with Aryl Iodides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The preparation of enantioenriched diarylmethanol derivatives is described using nickel&#8208;catalyzed electrochemical cross&#8208;couplings between various alkyl/aryl aldehydes and aryl iodides. Performed in an electrochemical cell equipped with an iron anode and a nickel cathode, this electrocatalytic variant led to the scalemic targeted products in the presence of 2,2&#8208;bis((4R,5S)&#8208;4,5&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;4,5&#8208;dihydrooxazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)acetonitrile (L2), as enantiopure cyano&#8208;bis(oxazoline) ligand. X&#8208;ray structure analysis of a pre&#8208;catalyst, for instance the [Ni(II)(L2)2] complex, with L2 as an anionic bisoxazolinate ligand, confirms the chemical formulation of one nickel surrounded by two ligands. The redox behavior of the new Ni complexes generated in situ was first assessed by cyclic voltammetry showing a redox wave at ca. &#8208;1.5 V that can be assigned to the two&#8208;electron reduction of the Ni(II) center to the Ni(0) state. Oxidative addition between the electrogenerated Ni(0) complex and aryl iodide was evidenced. An intense current was observed in presence of a mixture of the two substrates pertaining an electrocatalytic process. Interestingly, we found that the sacrificial iron anode plays a crucial role in the catalytic mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Synergistic Nanoscale Mn3O4&#8208;CoO&#8208;Co Heterojunctions for Boosting the Selectivity in Hydrogenation of Nitrostyrenes and Nitroarenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8211;metal oxide interface catalysts are in high demand for advanced catalytic applications due to their multi&#8208;component active sites, which facilitate synergistic cooperation where a single component alone cannot effectively promote the desired reaction. Demonstrated herein graphene oxide&#8208;supported nanoscale Mn3O4&#8208;CoO&#8208;Co as highly efficient catalysts for hydrogenation of nitro styrenes/nitro arenes to amino styrenes/arenes under mild reaction conditions (0.5 MPa and 100 &#176;C in 1:1 THF/water). Charge relocalization at the Co&#8208;CoO&#8208;Mn3O4 heterojunction interfaces, primarily driven by Mn3O4, significantly improves reaction selectivity. Replacing Mn3O4 with MnO or using other supported bimetallic CoMnOx catalysts decreases selectivity, leading to the formation of a mixture of products. The catalyst demonstrated remarkable selectivity in converting nitro groups to amines, even in the presence of highly reactive functional groups such as C=C, O&#8208;C=O, C=O, C&#8801;N, chalcones, and halides. It also exhibited high yields, multiple reusability, and a broad substrate scope. This study demonstrates how Mn3O4, in synergy with CoO&#8208;Co, fine&#8208;tunes selectivity, paving the way for the development of advanced metal&#8208;metal oxide interface catalysts to enhance both selectivity and efficiency in organic transformations.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of dissolving metal electrodes for the direct electrochemical synthesis of metal complexes has been used widely in the last decade. A major benefit of the electrochemical approach is the minimal by&#8208;products resulting from the synthesis. As such, metal complexes can be produced on&#8208;demand and used directly in catalysis without the need for purification. Furthermore, the electrochemical method enables the production of metal complexes that cannot be synthesized using other methods, including those with base&#8208;sensitive ligands. General principles of the electrochemical method and recent advances in the field are discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Organic&#8211;Inorganic Hybrid Silica Film with a TGBA* Structure</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Twisted grain boundary (TGB) phases exhibit highly frustrated and complex liquid crystal structures, and have attracted enormous interest because of their unique internal structure, textures and properties. However, among the few real concerns related to these interesting structures, applying them to prepare polymer&#8208;stabilized colored liquid crystal films has been challenging. Herein, the organic&#8722;inorganic hybrid silica (OIHS) films with a TGBA* structure were prepared using two organosilanes and one chiral additive under an acidic condition. The structural color of the films can be adjusted by varying the polycondensation temperature and the concentration of the chiral additive. A structurally colored pattern was prepared by the inject printing, which was suitably applied for decoration and anti&#8208;counterfeiting.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorination or Not in Small Molecule Solar Cells: Achieving a Higher Efficiency with Halogen&#8208;free End Group</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorination is an efficient strategy for improving organic solar cells (OSCs) efficiency, particularly by fluorinating the end group of emerging nonfullerene acceptors. Here, the fluorination effect was investigated by using small molecule donors with fluorine&#8208;free (SBz) and fluorinated (SBz&#8208;F) end groups, paired with the emerging nonfullerene acceptor Y6. Interestingly and unexpectedly, fluorination of the end group negatively affects OSCs efficiency, with fluorine&#8208;free SBz:Y6 OSCs achieving a higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 11.05% compared to the fluorine&#8208;containing SBz&#8208;F:Y6 blends (PCE = 9.61%). Analysis of space&#8208;charge limited currents reveals lower and unbalanced hole/electron mobility in SBz&#8208;F:Y6 compared to the SBz:Y6 blends. These findings are further supported by charge recombination dynamics and donor&#8208;acceptor miscibility analyses.</dc:description>

         <title>Targeted Photoactivatable Green&#8208;Emitting BODIPY Based on Directed Photooxidation&#8208;Induced Activation and its Application to Live Dynamic Super&#8208;Resolution Microscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoactivatable fluorescent probes are valuable tools in bioimaging for tracking cells down to single molecules and for single molecule localization microscopy. For the latter application, green emitting dyes are in demand. We herein developed an efficient green&#8208;emitting photoactivatable furanyl&#8208;BODIPY (PFB) and we established a new mechanism of photoactivation called Directed Photooxidation Induced Activation (DPIA) where the furan is photo&#8208;oxidized in a directed manner by the singlet oxygen produced by the probe. The efficient photoconverter (93&#8208;fold fluorescence enhancement at 510 nm, 49% yield conversion) is functionalizable and allowed targeting of several subcellular structures and organelles, which were photoactivated in live cells. Finally, we demonstrated the potential of PFB in super&#8208;resolution imaging by performing PhotoActivated Localization Microscopy (PALM) in live cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Low&#8208;Temperature Reduction of NOx by NH3 with Unity Conversion on Nanofilament MnO2/Activated Semi&#8208;Coke Catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique nanofilament MnO2 grown on activated semi&#8208;coke demonstrates a marked 100&#8201;% conversion rate of NO at low temperatures down to 70&#8211;90&#8201;&#176;C in NH3, resulting from the promoted interaction of NO with NH3 on the catalytic sites.







Abstract
Selective catalytic reduction of nitrogen oxides with NH3 at low temperatures remains a crucial goal for industrial applications. However, effective catalysts operating at 70&#8211;90&#8201;&#176;C are rarely reported, limiting SCR scenarios to high&#8208;temperature conditions. Herein, we report a unique MnO2 nanofilament catalyst grown on activated semi&#8208;coke synthesized via a one&#8208;step in&#8197;situ hydrothermal approach, which exhibits a stable and marked 100&#8201;% conversion rate of NO to N2 with 100&#8201;% selectivity at 90&#8201;&#176;C, superior to the other prepared structures (nanowires, nanorods, and nanotubes). Temperature&#8208;programmed desorption shows a large number of acid sites on MnO2(NFs)/ASC, benefiting the formation of NH4+ ions. Meanwhile, diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy reveals the activation of NO with O2 to form bidentate nitrate/bridging nitrate NO2 intermediates via bidentate nitrate species, triggering the Fast SCR with NH3 at low temperatures. Such an effective, easy&#8208;to&#8208;prepare, and low&#8208;cost catalyst paves a new pathway for low&#8208;temperature SCR for a wide range of application scenarios.

         <title>Ficini Reaction with Acrylates for the Stereoselective Synthesis of Aminocyclobutanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We describe herein the first catalytic Ficini reaction between ynamides and acrylates. This approach enables the formation of stable tri&#8208;substituted cyclobutenes and subsequent selective synthesis of aminocyclobutanes with unique stereochemical patterns.







Abstract
The first Ficini reaction between ynamides and acrylates is reported herein. The reaction is catalyzed by B(C6F5)3 acting as a Lewis acid and is giving access to stable tri&#8208;substituted aminocyclobutenes in high yield. The resulting products can be hydrogenated and epimerized under basic conditions or in presence of a Lewis acid, providing two distinct trans&#8208; aminocyclobutane monoester stereoisomers in high yield and diastereoisomeric ratio (up to quantitative yield and &gt;99&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr).

         <title>Functionalized Metal&#8208;Organic Framework for NADH Regeneration by Hydrogen in a Redox Flow Bioreactor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work explores enhancing NADH regeneration for industrial chemical production by immobilizing [Rh(Cp*)(bpy)Cl]+ onto a 3D metal&#8208;organic framework (NU&#8208;1000) on graphite felt and utilizing a gas diffusion electrode to efficiently oxidize H2, enabling effective NADH regeneration and highly efficient enzymatic synthesis of L&#8208;lactate in a flow bioreactor. This method achieves significant turnover numbers (TTN) and turnover frequencies (TOF), providing valuable insights for building efficient enzymatic electrosynthesis systems in industrial production.







Abstract
The electrochemical regeneration of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) using [Rh(Cp*)(bpy)Cl]+ holds significant promise for the industrial synthesis of chiral chemicals. However, challenges persist due to the high consumption of NADH and the limited efficiency of its cyclic regeneration, which currently hinder widespread application. To address these obstacles, based on in&#8208;situ growth of 3D ordered metal&#8208;organic framework (NU&#8208;1000) on the surface of graphite felt, [Rh(Cp*)(bpy)Cl]+ were immobilized on the Zr6 nodes of NU&#8208;1000 by solvent&#8208;assisted ligand incorporation (SALI), and applied in a flow bioreactor. Moreover, we employ a gas diffusion electrode (GDE) to oxidize H2, providing a clean proton source for the electrochemical regeneration of NADH. Consequently, highly efficient enzymatic electrocatalytic synthesis of L&#8208;lactate was achieved when coupled with L&#8208;lactate dehydrogenases (LDH) as a model reaction, and the total turnover number (TTN) reached 19600 and 1750 for [Rh(Cp*)(bpy)Cl]+ and NAD+ after 48&#8197;h, corresponding to a high turnover frequency (TOF) of 2350&#8197;h&#8722;1 and 210&#8197;h&#8722;1 for [Rh(Cp*)(bpy)Cl]+ and NAD+, respectively. This work provides new insights for the construction of efficient enzymatic electrosynthesis systems in industrial production.

         <title>Binary and Ternary Deep Eutectic Solvents for Methylene Green Electropolymerization on Multiwalled Carbon Nanotubes: Optimization, Characterization and Application</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new ternary deep eutectic solvent is used for the electropolymerization of methylene green on carbon nanotube modified glassy carbon electrodes. Modified electrode characterization is by cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and morphology by scanning electron microscopy. It is successfully used as a sensor for simultaneous determination of 5&#8208;aminosalicylic acid and acetaminophen in pharmaceutical samples by differential pulse voltammetry.







Abstract
Choline chloride (ChCl) based binary and ternary deep eutectic solvents (DES) were evaluated for methylene green electropolymerization with oxalic acid (OA) and ethylene glycol (EG) as hydrogen bond donors. Binary DES ChCl&#8201;:&#8201;OA in molar ratios 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 and 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 and ChCl&#8201;:&#8201;EG 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 and ternary DES (tDES) in different molar ratios and percentages of water were evaluated. The highest polymer growth was in ChCl&#8201;:&#8201;OA&#8201;:&#8201;EG&#8208;tDES with 13% added water, that had a lower viscosity and higher ionic conductivity when associated with HCl as dopant. This enhanced the formation of more cation radicals and, consequently, more polymer formation. The PMG/MWCNT/GCE&#8208;tDES sensor was successfully applied to the simultaneous determination of 5&#8208;aminosalicylic acid (5&#8208;ASA) and acetaminophen (APAP) by differential pulse voltammetry in the concentration range 1&#8197;&#956;M&#8211;200&#8197;&#956;M, with detection limits of 0.37&#8197;&#956;M and 0.49&#8197;&#956;M for 5&#8208;ASA and APAP, respectively. The sensor demonstrated good repeatability, reproducibility and stability, and was successfully applied in pharmaceutical formulations.

         <title>The Solid&#8208;State Multi&#8208;Color Fluorescence Switching from a [2.2]Paracyclophane&#8208;Based Triarylborane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fluorescence of a [2.2]paracyclophane&#8208;based triarylborane, which is modified by an electron&#8208;donating dimethylamino (NMe2) and an electron&#8208;accepting [(2&#8208;dimesityllboryl)phenyl]ethynyl at the pseudo&#8208;gem position of [2.2]paracyclophane skeleton, can be switched among four bright fluorescent colors in the solid state (&#934;F=0.31&#8211;0.87) by combination of the tricolor mechanochromic fluorescence and acidochromic fluorescence.







Abstract
The fluorophores, the fluorescence of which can be switched between multi bright colors in the solid state, show promising applications not only in the sophisticated multicolor display but also in the advanced encryption and anti&#8208;counterfeiting systems. However, it is very challenging to obtain such fluorophores. Herein, we disclose such an example, g&#8208;BPhANMe2&#8208;Cp, which contains an electron&#8208;donating dimethylamino (NMe2) and an electron&#8208;accepting [(2&#8208;dimesitylboryl)phenyl]acetyl at the pseudo&#8208;gem position of [2.2]paracyclophane skeleton. This molecule can display tricolor mechanochromic luminescence (MCL) due to the different responses of the mechanically ground amorphous state to heating and solvent&#8208;fuming. Owing to the absence of intermolecular &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions in the solid state, the fluorescence efficiency is very high irrespective of its morphological state (&#934;F=0.60&#8211;0.87). Moreover, this molecule also displays reversible acidochromic luminescence (ACL) by protonation and deprotonation of NMe2 with trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and triethylamine (TEA), respectively. The protonated sample fluoresces (&#934;F=0.31) at much shorter wavelength due to the interruption of intramolecular charge transfer process. Therefore, with the combination of tricolor MCL and ACL properties, the solid&#8208;state emission of g&#8208;BPhANMe2&#8208;Cp can be switched among four bright fluorescence colors of yellow, green, cyan and blue via treatment with appropriate stimulus.

         <title>Dual Aliovalent Dopants Cu, Mn Engineered Eco&#8208;Friendly QDs for Ultra&#8208;Stable Anti&#8208;Counterfeiting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Doping eco&#8208;friendly ZnInSe2/ZnSe core/shell quantum dots (QDs) with Cu and Mn tailors their optical properties for anti&#8208;counterfeiting. The engineered QDs exhibit bright orange photoluminescence at 606&#8197;nm with improved color purity and stability. Integrated into PMMA, they create durable luminescent inks suitable for complex encryption and anti&#8208;counterfeiting.







Abstract
Doping in semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) using optically active dopants tailors their optical, electronic, and magnetic properties beyond what is achieved by controlling size, shape, and composition. Herein, we synergistically modulated the optical properties of eco&#8208;friendly ZnInSe2/ZnSe core/shell QDs by incorporating Cu&#8208;doping and Mn&#8208;alloying into their core and shell to investigate their use in anti&#8208;counterfeiting and information encryption. The engineered &#8220;Cu:ZnInSe2/Mn:ZnSe&#8221; core/shell QDs exhibit an intense bright orange photoluminescence (PL) emission centered at 606&#8197;nm, with better color purity than the undoped and individually doped core/shell QDs. The average PL lifetime is significantly extended to 201&#8197;ns, making it relevant for complex encryption and anti&#8208;counterfeiting. PL studies reveal that in Cu:ZnInSe2/Mn:ZnSe, the photophysical emission arises from the Cu state via radiative transition from the Mn 4T1 state. Integration of Cu:ZnInSe2/Mn:ZnSe core/shell QDs into poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) serves as versatile smart concealed luminescent inks for both writing and printing patterns. The features of these printed patterns using Cu:ZnInSe2/Mn:ZnSe core/shell QDs persisted after 10&#8197;weeks of water&#8208;soaking and retained 70&#8201;% of PL emission intensity at 170&#8201;&#176;C, demonstrating excellent thermal stability. This work provides an efficient approach to enhance both the emission and the stability of eco&#8208;friendly QDs via dopant engineering for fluorescence anti&#8208;counterfeiting applications.

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Regulated Formation of Metal/Metal&#8208;Oxo Nodes in Two Indium Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks: Syntheses, Structures, Selective Gas Adsorption and Fluorescence Sensor Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mononuclear and multinuclear indium&#8208;based MOFs with water stability were synthesized by using DMA and DMF/DMSO/H2O mixed solvent, respectively. Two MOFs both exhibit good sensing properties for acetone and Fe3+ ions. Meanwhile, the multinuclear indium&#8208;based MOF also demonstrates exceptional CO2 adsorption capacity and selectivity.







Abstract
Two water&#8208;stable indium metal&#8208;organic frameworks, (NH2Me2)3[In3(BTB)4]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;12DMA&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;4.5H2O (In&#8208;MOF&#8208;1) and (NH2Me2)9[In9O6(BTB)8(H2O)4(DMSO)4]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;27DMSO&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;21H2O (In&#8208;MOF&#8208;2) (BTB=4,4&#8242;,4&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;tribenzoate) with 3D interpenetrated structure has been constructed by regulating solvents. Structure analysis revealed that In&#8208;MOF&#8208;1 has a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) structure with a single metal core, while In&#8208;MOF&#8208;2 features an octahedron cage constructed by three kinds of metal clusters to further form a 3D structure. The fluorescence investigations showed that In&#8208;MOF&#8208;1 and In&#8208;MOF&#8208;2 are potential MOF&#8208;based fluorescent sensors to detect acetone and Fe3+ ions in EtOH or water with high sensitivity, excellent selectivity, recyclability and a low limit of detection. Moreover, the fluorescence mechanisms of In&#8208;MOF&#8208;1 and In&#8208;MOF&#8208;2 toward acetone and Fe3+ ions were further explained. In addition, In&#8208;MOF&#8208;2 has higher thermal and framework stability than In&#8208;MOF&#8208;1. The activated In&#8208;MOF&#8208;2 presents a high BET surface area of 998.82&#8197;m2g&#8722;1 and a pore size distribution of 8 to 16&#8197;&#197;. At the same time, In&#8208;MOF&#8208;2 exhibits high selective CO2 adsorption for CO2/CH4 and CO2/N2, respectively. Furthermore, the adsorption sites and adsorption isotherms were predicted using grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations, and the adsorption energy of the lowest&#8208;energy adsorption configuration was calculated using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations.

         <title>Highly Active Immobilized Catalyst for Ethylene Polymerization: Neutral Single Site Y(III) Complex Bearing Bulky Silylallyl Ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Designing of a highly active neutral yttrium supported catalyst for ethylene polymerization can be achieved by electronic and steric tuning of the ligand attached to the yttrium metal. This catalyst was implemented at a pre&#8208;industrial scale, demonstrating unprecedented activity and the desired high&#8208;density polyethylenes (HDPE) with a broad molar mass distribution, which is advantageous for resin processing.







Abstract
Exploring the surface organometallic chemistry on silica of highly electrophilic yttrium complexes is a relatively uncommon endeavor, particularly when focusing on tris&#8208;alkyl complexes characterized by Y&#8722;C &#963;&#8208;alkyl bonds. A drawback with this class of complexes once grafted on silica, is the frequent occurrence of alkyl transfer by ring opening of siloxane groups, resulting in a mixture of species. Herein, we employed a more stable homoleptic yttrium allyl complex bearing bulky &#951;3&#8208;1,3&#8208;bis(trimethylsilyl)allyl ligand to limit this transfer reaction. This strategy has been validated by comparing the reactivity between [Y{ &#951;3&#8208;1,3&#8208;C3H3(SiMe3)2}3] and [Y(o&#8208;CH2PhNMe2)3] with SiO2&#8211;700, where the undesired alkyl transfer reaction occurred for [Y(o&#8208;CH2PhNMe2)3] leading to a bipodal [(&#8801;SiO)2Y(o&#8208;CH2PhNMe2)] as major surface species, 2, while [Y{ &#951; 3&#8208;1,3&#8208;C3H3(SiMe3)2}3] resulted selectively in a monopodal species, [(&#8801;SiO)Y{&#951;3&#8208;1,3&#8208;C3H3(SiMe3)2}2], 1. The materials obtained were characterized by DRIFT, solid state NMR, mass balance analysis and EXAFS. Catalyst 1 showed high activity compared to 2 in ethylene polymerization. The catalytic performance of this neutral catalyst 1 was extended to pre&#8208;industrial scale in the presence of hydrogen and 1&#8208;hexene. An unprecedented activity, up to 7400&#8197;gPE&#8201;gcat&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 was obtained even with very low concentration of scavenger AliBu3 (TIBA/Y=1.2).

     alt="Highly Active Immobilized Catalyst for Ethylene Polymerization: Neutral Single Site Y(III) Complex Bearing Bulky Silylallyl Ligand"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Designing of a highly active neutral yttrium supported catalyst for ethylene polymerization can be achieved by electronic and steric tuning of the ligand attached to the yttrium metal. This catalyst was implemented at a pre-industrial scale, demonstrating unprecedented activity and the desired high-density polyethylenes (HDPE) with a broad molar mass distribution, which is advantageous for resin processing.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exploring the surface organometallic chemistry on silica of highly electrophilic yttrium complexes is a relatively uncommon endeavor, particularly when focusing on tris-alkyl complexes characterized by Y&#8722;C &#963;-alkyl bonds. A drawback with this class of complexes once grafted on silica, is the frequent occurrence of alkyl transfer by ring opening of siloxane groups, resulting in a mixture of species. Herein, we employed a more stable homoleptic yttrium allyl complex bearing bulky &#951;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;-1,3-bis(trimethylsilyl)allyl ligand to limit this transfer reaction. This strategy has been validated by comparing the reactivity between [Y{ &#951;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;-1,3-C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(SiMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;] and [Y(o-CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PhNMe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;] with SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&#8211;700&lt;/sub&gt;, where the undesired alkyl transfer reaction occurred for [Y(o-CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PhNMe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;] leading to a bipodal [(&#8801;SiO)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Y(o-CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PhNMe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)] as major surface species, &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;, while [Y{ &#951; &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;-1,3-C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(SiMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;] resulted selectively in a monopodal species, [(&#8801;SiO)Y{&#951;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;-1,3-C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(SiMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;], &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;. The materials obtained were characterized by DRIFT, solid state NMR, mass balance analysis and EXAFS. Catalyst &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; showed high activity compared to &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; in ethylene polymerization. The catalytic performance of this neutral catalyst &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; was extended to pre-industrial scale in the presence of hydrogen and 1-hexene. An unprecedented activity, up to 7400&#8197;g&lt;sub&gt;PE&lt;/sub&gt;&#8201;g&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; was obtained even with very low concentration of scavenger Al&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;Bu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (TIBA/Y=1.2). The obtained HDPE exhibited desired spherical particle morphology with broad molar mass distribution.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Effects of Ring Functionalization in Anthracene&#8208;Based Cyclophanes on the Binding Properties Toward Nucleotides and DNA</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclophanes with different substitution patterns were prepared and studied for binding of nucleoside triphosphates and double&#8208;stranded DNA. While the ortho&#8208;phenyl derivative showed high affinity for nucleoside triphosphates, the meta&#8208;derivative demonstrated GC&#8208;selectivity and an intercalation binding mode with DNA.







Abstract
Supramolecular recognition of nucleobases and short sequences is an emerging research field focusing on possible applications to treat many diseases. Controlling the affinity and selectivity of synthetic receptors to target desired nucleotides or short sequences is a highly challenging task. Herein, we elucidate the effect of substituents in the phenyl ring of the anthracene&#8208;benzene azacyclophane on the recognition of nucleoside triphosphates (NTPs) and double&#8208;stranded DNA. We show that introducing phenyl rings increases the affinity for NTPs 10&#8208;fold and implements groove and intercalation binding modes with double&#8208;stranded DNA. NMR studies and molecular modeling calculations support the ability of cyclophanes to encapsulate nucleobases as part of nucleotides.

         <title>Tetradentate Pt(II) Complexes Based on Xylenylamino Linked Dual Pyrazolate Chelates for Organic Light Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Functional tetradentate chelates composed of two pyrazolate chelates and one xylenylamino linker were employed in preparation of Pt(II) complexes showing efficient ligand&#8208;centered &#960;&#960;* transition characteristics. Upon fabrication of OLED devices, Pt4N2 and Pt4N3 based devices delivered efficient cyan and green emission, with an EQEmax of 15.2&#8201;% and 11.2&#8201;%, respectively, affirming the successfulness of the tetradentate chelating strategy.







Abstract
In this work, we report the syntheses of three Pt(II) emitters, namely, Pt4N1, Pt4N2, and Pt4N3, to which their tetradentate chelates were assembled by linking two pyrazolate chelates with a single xylenylamino entity. Functionalization of Pt4N1 was achieved upon the addition of electronegative CF3 substituent on pyridinyl groups and switching to more electron&#8208;deficient pyrazinyl groups in giving Pt4N2 and Pt4N3, respectively. The vertically arranged xylenylamino entity has effectively suppressed the inter&#8208;molecular &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking and Pt&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Pt interaction, as shown by the single crystal X&#8208;ray structural analyses.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Aromatization&#8208;Driven Ring&#8208;Opening Amination and Oxygenation of Spiro Dihydroquinazolinones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The available spiro dihydroquinazolinones can undergo deconstructive amination under the copper/ROOR catalytic system, the active alkyl radicals can be generated via a sequential HAT and &#946;&#8208;scission process, which are further captured by the in&#8197;situ generated R1R2NCu(II) complex to form the C&#8722;N bond. This protocol provides an efficient and green approach to the indazole&#8208;containing quinazolin&#8208;4(3H)&#8208;ones in good yields ring&#8208;opening oxygenation of spiro dihydroquinazolinones also occurred under the copper/air system, providing the carbonyl&#8208;containing quinazolin&#8208;4(3H)&#8208;ones in good yields.







Abstract
Mild and inexpensive copper&#8208;catalyzed aromatization&#8208;driven ring&#8208;opening amination and oxygenation of spiro dihydroquinazolinones are presented, respectively. These protocols provide facile and atom&#8208;economical access to the aminated and the carbonyl&#8208;containing quinazolin&#8208;4(3H)&#8208;ones in good yields with good functional group compatibility, which are difficult to obtain by conventional methods. Remarkably, a telescoped procedure involving the condensation and the ring&#8208;opening/functionalization for simple cycloalkanone was found to be accessible. Mechanistic studies suggest a radical pathway for this transformation.

         <title>Modification of an AIE Fluorescent Probe for Monitoring the Polarity of Lipid Droplets Based on a Series of Synthesized Aryl Naphthalizes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of fluorescent probes were designed based on the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) mechanism to target LDs and detected cell polarity. The probes were modified using oligo&#8208;oligomeric PEG to increase biocompatibility, and the triphenylamine moiety enabled the probes to exhibit aggregation&#8208;induced luminescence (AIE) properties. The Nap&#8208;TPA&#8208;PEG3 probe exhibited a high degree of sensitivity to polarity.







Abstract
Lipid droplets (LDs) are subcellular organelles that are dynamic and play a central role in energy homeostasis and lipid metabolism. They also contribute to the transport and maturation of cellular proteins and are closely associated with several diseases. The important role of the cellular microenvironment in maintaining cellular homeostasis. Changes in cell polarity, particularly in organelles, have been found to be strongly linked to inflammation, Alzheimer's disease, cancer, and other illnesses. It is essential to check the polarity of the LDs. A series of arylated naphthalimide derivatives were synthesized using the Suzuki reaction. Modification of synthesized aryl naphthalimides using oligomeric PEG based on intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) mechanism. A series of fluorescent probes were designed to target LDs and detect their polarity. Nap&#8208;TPA&#8208;PEG3 probe exhibited high sensitivity to polarity. The addition of oligomeric polyethylene glycol (PEG) to the probe not only significantly improved its solubility in water, but also effectively reduced its cytotoxicity. In addition, the probe exhibited excellent aggregation&#8208;induced luminescence (AIE) properties and solvent discolouration effects. Nap&#8208;TPA&#8208;PEG3 probe exhibited high Pearson correlation coefficient (0.957163) in lipid droplet co&#8208;localization in cells. Nap&#8208;TPA&#8208;PEG3 could be used as an effective hand tool to monitor cell polarity.

         <title>Fabrication of a Multi&#8208;Functional Separator Incorporating Crown ether&#8208; Polyoxometalate Supramolecular Compound for Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The KPW&#8208;CR6/GO/PP separator demonstrated the ability to synergistically capture and expedite the rapid conversion of lithium Polysulfides (LiPSs) during electrochemical processes. Moreover, the Crown ether&#8208;POM supramolecular complex, through its crown ether array, has shown a notable degree of success in preventing POM catalyst leaching. This augmentation markedly enhances the performance of lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries. As a result, the capacity remained significant even after 160 cycles at 0.5&#8197;C at a high sulfur loading density of 3.2&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2, decreasing from 543.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8211;487.9&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1, with a capacity decay rate of merely 0.006&#8201;% per cycle.







Abstract
Recently, research on polyoxometalates (POMs) has gained significant momentum. Owing to their properties as electronic sponges, POMs catalyst harbor substantial potential in lithium&#8208;sulfur battery research. However, POMs undergo a transformation into reduced heteropoly blue (HPB) during electrochemical reactions, which then dissolve into the electrolyte, resulting in catalyst loss. In this research, we amalgamated 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 (CR6) with K3PW12O40, (KPW), synthesized a novel POM&#8208;based supramolecular compound, and integrated it with graphene oxide (GO) to fabricate a multi&#8208;functional composite polypropylene (PP) separator KPW&#8208;CR6/GO/PP. The crown ether array was employed to immobilize POM and construct ion transport channels, thereby enhancing the Li+ migration rate and capturing polysulfides. Subsequently, leveraging the stable structure and redox properties of POM, the polysulfide is catalyzed to transform and inhibit the shuttle effect, thereby protecting the Li anode. The lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries with the Crown ether&#8208;POM supramolecular compound separators, exhibit enhanced capacity and stability (1073.3&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1.0&#8197;C, and 81.5&#8201;% retention rate after 250 cycles). The battery (S loading: 3.2&#8197;mg&#8201;cm&#8722;2) presents an initial specific discharge capacity of 543.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.5&#8197;C, with 89.8&#8201;% of the capacity retained after 160 cycles. This underlines the practical application potential of Crown ether&#8208;POM supramolecular materials in Li&#8722;S batteries.

         <title>Multilevel Dynamic System as Molecular Morning&#8208;After Timer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Systems chemistry aims to develop molecular systems that display emerging properties arising from their network and absent in their individual constituents. Employing reversible chemistry under thermodynamic control represents a valuable tool for generating dynamic combinatorial libraries of interconverting molecules, which may exhibit intriguing collective behaviour. A simple dynamic combinatorial library was prepared using dithioacetal / thiol / disulfide exchanges. Because of the relative reactivities of these reversible reactions, the library constitutes a two&#8208;layer dynamic system with one layer active in an acid medium (thiol/dithioacetal exchange) and one layer active in a basic medium (thiol/disulfide exchange). This property enables the system to respond to momentary changes in acidity of the medium by activating different network regions, channeling some building blocks from one layer to another through shared thiol reagents (nodes). This momentaneous change in wiring affects the final steady state composition of the library, measured the next day, even though the event that caused it vanishes without leaving any residue. Therefore, the final composition of this dynamic system provides information about this transient past perturbation in the environment such as: when it occurred, how long it was, or how intense it was.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;Step Carbonization Synthesis of N, S Co&#8208;Doped Carbon Materials Derived from Agricultural Waste Peanut Shells for High&#8208;Performance Symmetric Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biomass carbon has the advantages of wide source, low cost and environmental protection, and has been widely used in the field of electrochemical energy storage. In this work, N and S co&#8208;doped carbon materials were prepared by using peanut shell as carbon source and thiourea as activator. When the peanut shell and activator were 2 g and 4 g, respectively, the prepared NSPC&#8208;4 had the largest specific surface area and special pore structure. Elemental analysis showed that the activator introduced more N, S and O atoms to the carbon material, and more heteroatoms helped to improve the surface structure of the carbon material and provide additional pseudocapacitance. In addition, NSPC&#8208;4 contains a short&#8208;range ordered graphite structure, which can provide excellent electrical conductivity. The electrochemical test results show that NSPC&#8208;4 has the largest specific capacitance. When the mass of the activator is higher than or below 4 g, the electrochemical performance of the carbon material will be reduced. The symmetric supercapacitor (SSC) assembled by NSPC&#8208;4 has an energy density of 8.3 Wh kg&#8208;1 when the power density is 350 W kg&#8208;1. The synthesis method is not only simple, green and economical, but also has important application value.</dc:description>

         <title>Ammonothermal Synthesis of Luminescent Imidonitridophosphate Ba4P4N8(NH)2:Eu2+</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The structural variability of a compound class is an important criterion for the research into phosphor host lattices for phosphor&#8208;converted light&#8208;emitting diodes (pc&#8208;LEDs). Especially, nitridophosphates and the related class of imidonitridophosphates are promising candidates. Recently, the ammonothermal approach has opened a systematic access to this substance class with larger sample quantities. We present the successful ammonothermal synthesis of the imidonitridophosphate Ba4P4N8(NH)2:Eu2+. Its crystal structure is solved by X&#8208;ray diffraction and it crystallizes in space group Cc (no.&#160;9) with lattice parameters a&#160;=&#160;12.5250(3), b&#160;=&#160;12.5566(4), c&#160;=&#160;7.3882(2)&#160;&#197; and &#946;&#160;=&#160;102.9793(10)&#176;. For the first time, adamantane&#8208;type (imido)nitridophosphate anions [P4N8(NH)2]8&#8722; are observed next to metal ions other than alkali metals in a compound. The presence of imide groups in the structure and the identification of preferred positions for the hydrogen atoms are performed using a combination of quantum chemical calculations, Fourier&#8208;transform infrared, and solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy. Eu2+ doped samples exhibit cyan emission (&#955;max&#160;=&#160;498&#160;nm, fwhm&#160;=&#160;50&#160;nm/1981&#160;cm&#8722;1) when excited with ultraviolet light with an impressive internal quantum efficiency (IQE) of 41&#160;%, which represents the first benchmark for imidonitridophosphates and is promising for potential industrial application of this compound class.</dc:description>

         <title>Nanoenabled self&#8208;assembled metal&#8208;organic algaecides generated photosynthetic inhibition and oxidative stress for sustainable food security</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Achieving food sustainability is one of the biggest challenges in the new millennium. Plant factory cultivation systems provide an alternative for food sustainability, while they often suffer from algal blooms. The overuse of conventional algaecides has caused significant environmental pollution and concerns about food security. Here, we design a nanoenabled metal&#8208;organic algaecide that is self&#8208;assembled from natural polyphenols and two functional metal ions for providing shading effects and delivering active ingredients synergistically to suppress algal blooms. Black wattle tannin (BWT) and Fe3+ ions are utilized to develop self&#8208;assembled FeBWT nanoalgaecides with significant shading effects for decreasing light transmission (up to 97%) and effectively inhibiting algal photosynthesis. Further, the FeBWT is functionalized with Cu2+ ions (bimetallic Cu/FeBWT) to target the algal cells and release Cu2+ ions via phenolic&#8208;mediated cell surface interactions, thus enhancing the inhibition efficiency. Importantly, the biosafety of Cu/FeBWT is demonstrated through toxicity tests on zebrafish and NIH3T3 cells. In our real&#8208;world field test, the Cu/FeBWT demonstrates high algal inhibition performance (&gt; 95%, over 30 days), and enhances the accumulation of food nutrients in model plant lettuces. Collectively, the supramolecular metal&#8208;organic nanoalgaecide provides a promise for nanoagrochemical application and promoting food sustainability and security.</dc:description>

Collectively, the supramolecular metal-organic nanoalgaecide provides a promise for nanoagrochemical application and promoting food sustainability and security.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Size&#8208;dependent Copper Nanoparticles Supported on Carbon Nanotubes with Balanced Cu+ and Cu0 Dual Sites for the Selective Hydrogenation of Ethylene Carbonate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyclic carbonate hydrogenation offers an alternative for the efficient indirect CO2 utilization. In this study, a series of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) supported xCu/CNTs catalysts with different Cu loadings were fabricated using a convenient impregnation method, and exhibited excellent catalytic activity for the hydrogenation of ethylene carbonate to methanol and ethylene glycol. The structural and physicochemical properties revealed that acid treatment of CNTs resulted in plentiful oxygen&#8208;containing functional groups, providing sufficient anchoring sites for copper species. The calcination process conducted under an inert atmosphere resulted in the formation of ternary CuO, Cu2O, and Cu composites, enhancing the metal&#8208;support interaction and facilitating the formation of balanced Cu0 and Cu+ dual sites as well as high active surface area after reduction. Contributed to the synergetic effect of balanced Cu+ and Cu0 species proved by density functional theory calculation and the electron&#8208;rich CNTs surface, the 40Cu/CNTs catalyst achieved strengthened catalytic performance with methanol yield of 83%, ethylene glycol yield of 99% at ethylene carbonate conversion of &gt;99%, and 150 h of long&#8208;term running stability. Consequently, CNTs supported Cu serve as efficient non&#8208;silica based catalyst for ester hydrogenation.</dc:description>

         <title>Simultaneous Photocatalytic CO 2 &#160;Reduction and&#160;H 2 O Oxidation&#160;under Non&#8208;sacrificial Ambient Conditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The utilization of&#160;CO2,&#160;H2O,&#160;and solar energy is regarded as a sustainable route for converting CO2&#160;into chemical feedstocks,&#160;paving the way for carbon neutrality and reclamation. However, the simultaneous photocatalytic CO2&#160;reduction and&#160;H2O oxidation&#160;under non&#8208;sacrificial ambient conditions is&#160;still&#160;a&#160;significant challenge. Researchers have carried out extensive exploration and achieved dramatic&#160;developments&#160;in this area. In this review, we first&#160;primarily elucidate the principles of&#160;two half&#8208;reactions&#160;in&#160;the photocatalytic conversion of CO2&#160;with H2O, i.e., CO2&#160;reduction&#160;by the photo&#8208;generated electrons and protons, and&#160;H2O oxidation&#160;by the photo&#8208;generated holes&#160;without sacrificial agents. Subsequently,&#160;the strategies to promote two half&#8208;reactions are summarized, including the vacancy/facet/morphology&#160;design, adjacent redox site&#160;construction, and Z&#8208;scheme heterojunction&#160;development. Finally, we present the advanced&#160;in situ characterizations and future perspectives in&#160;this field. This review aims&#160;to provide&#160;fresh insights into&#160;effectively&#160;simultaneous photocatalytic CO2&#160;reduction and&#160;H2O oxidation under non&#8208;sacrificial ambient conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Preferential Formation of Three&#8208;layered Host&#8211;Guest Complexes of a Planar Dinuclear Metallohost with Alkali Metal Ions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We synthesized a planar macrocyclic dinuclear nickel(II) metallohost from the corresponding macrocyclic imine ligand containing two N2O2&#160;chelate coordination sites and an O6&#160;cation binding site like 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 as well as peripheral hexyl groups. Due to the lipophilic nature of the hexyl groups, the metallohost was soluble in less polar media where its interaction with alkali metal ions was enhanced. The binding studies by NMR spectroscopy clearly showed its strong tendency to form multi&#8208;layered structures. The metallohost formed 2:1 and 1:1 (host/guest) complexes with Na+&#160;with the two&#8208;step binding constants of logK1&#160;= 6.6 and logK2&#160;= 3.0. In contrast, its complexation with larger alkali metal ions (K+, Rb+, Cs+) preferentially gave 3:2 (host/guest) complexes when 2/3 equiv of the guest was present. The three&#8208;layered structures of these 3:2 complexes were well characterized by mass spectrometry and 2D COSY/ROESY experiments as well as DFT calculations, elucidating their unique structural feature with three chemically different environments due to the oppositely curved two [Ni(saloph)] moieties of the metallohost. Therefore, the three&#8208;layered structures were preferentially formed when larger alkali metal ions (K+, Rb+, Cs+) were complexed with the metallohost.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning the Reactivity of Copper(II)&#8211;Nitrite Core Towards Nitric Oxide Generation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Insights into the molecular mechanism and factors affecting nitrite&#8208;to&#8208;NO transformation at transition metal sites are essential for developing sustainable technologies relevant to NO&#8208;based therapeutics, waste water treatment, and agriculture. A set of copper(II)&#8211;nitrite complexes&#160;1&#8211;4&#160;have been isolated employing tridentate pincer&#8208;type ligands (quL,&#160;pyL,&#160;ClArOL&#8211;,&#160;PhOL&#8211;) featuring systematically varied donors. Although the X&#8208;ray crystal structures of the copper(II)&#8211;nitrite cores in&#160;1&#8211;4&#160;are comparable, electrochemical studies on complexes&#160;1&#8211;4&#160;reveal that redox properties of these complexes differ due to the changes in the&#160;s&#8208;donor abilities of the&#160;phenolate / N&#8208;heterocycle based donor sites. Reactivity of these nitrite complexes with oxygen&#8208;atom&#8208;transfer (OAT) reagent (e.g. triphenyl phosphine Ph3P) and H+/e&#8211;&#160;donor reagent (e.g. substituted phenols ArOH) show the reduction of nitrite to NO gas. Detailed kinetic investigations including kinetic isotope effect (KIE), Eyring analyses for determining the activation parameters unfold that reduction of nitrite at copper(II) by Ph3P or ArOH are influenced by the CuII/CuI&#160;redox potential. Finally, this study allows mechanism driven development of catalytic nitrite reduction by ArOH in the presence of 10 mol% copper complex (1).</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new paramagnetic ligand, 4&#8208;(2&#697;&#8208;4&#8208;(2&#697;&#697;&#8208;furyl)&#8208;pyrimidyl)&#8208;1,2,3,5&#8208;dithiadiazolyl (furylpymDTDA) and three transition metal coordination complexes, M(hfac)2(furylpymDTDA) M = Mn, Co, Ni; hfac = 1,1,1,5,5,5&#8208;hexafluoroacetylacetonato&#8208;), are reported. The solid&#8208;state structures are influenced by the geometry of the coordination sphere of the M(II) centers: trigonal (Mn) vs. octahedral (Co and Ni). While the hs&#8208;Mn(II) complex exhibits pairwise multi&#8208;centre 2&#8208;electron bonds (i.e., pancake bonds) between the planar &#960; radical DTDA moieties, the hs&#8208;Co(II) and Ni(II) complexes crystallize with close contacts between coordinated furylpymDTDA radical ligands that define linear 1D arrays of molecular units. The magnetic data for the hs&#8208;Co(II) and Ni(II) complexes indicate ferromagnetic (FM) interactions between molecular units, apparently mediated by radical&#8208;radical contacts along the supramolecular chains. Computational analysis suggests proximity between regions of large &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;spin density on neighbouring molecular sites enabling FM exchange, in accordance with the McConnell I mechanism. The magnetic data for the Ni(II) complex are consistent with a Heisenberg spin chain, whereas the hs&#8208;Co(II) complex exhibits Ising&#8208;like spin chain behaviour and a magnetic phase transition to an FM ordered state at 4.6 K.</dc:description>

         <title>Streamlining Thionyl Tetrafluoride (SOF4) and Pentafluorooxosulfate [OSF5]&#8211; Anions Syntheses</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A one pot room temperature synthesis of thionyl tetrafluoride (SOF4) from elemental fluorine (F2) and thionyl fluoride (SOF2) is reported. The selective decagram scale process (100 mmol) allows a quantitative preparation of SOF4 with high purity. The solid&#8208;state structure has also been elucidated and compared with the reported gas&#8208;phase one. The use of this reagent for the formation of the emerging pentafluorooxosulfate [cat][OSF5] anions led to the preparation of multiple ion&#8208;pairs (cat = Ag, NEt3Me, PPN, PPh4) in different organic solvents. The SuFEx reservoir ability of this anion was studied and by tuning the solvent system, the reactivity of pure thionyl tetrafluoride was observed using Ag[OSF5] in THF and acetone.</dc:description>

         <title>Surface Modification of Gold Nanorods: Multifunctional Strategies and Application Prospects</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Gold nanorods (AuNRs), as an important type of gold nanomaterials, have attracted much attention in the nano field. Compared with gold nanoparticls, AuNRs have broader application potential due to their tunable localized surface plasmon resonance properties and anisotropic shapes. Yet, conventional synthesis methods using surfactants have limited the use of AuNRs in a variety of fields such as biomedical applications, plasma&#8208;enhanced fluorescence, optics and optoelectronic devices. To solve this problem and improve the stability and biocompatibility of AuNRs, researchers in recent years have used surface modification and functionalization to modify AuNRs, among which the introduction of organic ligands to prepare organic/gold hybrid nanorods has become an effective strategy. Organic materials have better toughness and easy processing, and by introducing organic ligands into the surface of AuNRs, the molecular&#8208;level composite of organic and inorganic materials can be realized, thus obtaining hybrid nanorods with excellent properties. This paper reviews the research progress of hybrid nanocomposites, and introduces the synthesis methods of AuNRs and the development of surface ligand modification, then summaries the applications of a wide variety of ligands. Also, the advantages and disadvantages of different ligands and their roles in further self&#8208;assembly processes are discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Perylene Bisimide&#8208;Functionalized Triphenylmethyl Radicals Showing High Stability and Reversible Electrochemical Redox Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study presents a series of triphenylmethyl monoradicals incorporating varying numbers of peripheral perylene bisimide (PBI) substituents (1PBI&#8208;TTM&#183;, 2PBI&#8208;TTM&#183; and 3PBI&#8208;TTM&#183;). The incorporation of electron&#8208;withdrawing PBI substituents significantly enhances the stability of these carbon radicals, enabling them to display exceptional electrochemical redox reversibility. Notably, the electronic interplay between the PBI substituents and the central triphenylmethyl core facilitates unique and reversible multi&#8208;step redox reactions. Among the reported redicals, the tris&#8208;PBI functionalized radical (3PBI&#8208;TTM&#183;) demonstrates the remarkable ability to accommodate up to seven electrons under negative potentials, forming high valence anions. This research pioneers the development of highly stable carbon radicals with superior electrochemical oxidation&#8208;reduction processes, presenting promising avenues for the advancement of electric energy storage technologies.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced Electrochemical Performance of NiMn Layered Double Hydroxides/Graphene Oxide Composites Synthesized by One&#8208;Step Hydrothermal Method for Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 55, October 1, 2024. </description>

This study investigates the enhanced electrochemical performance of supercapacitors by optimizing electrode materials through the synthesis of NiMn layered double hydroxides combined with graphene oxide using a one&#8208;step hydrothermal method.







Abstract
This study aims to enhance the performance of supercapacitors, focusing particularly on optimizing electrode materials. While pure NiMn layered double hydroxides (LDHs) exhibit excellent electrochemical properties, they have limitations in achieving high specific capacitance. Therefore, this paper successfully synthesized composite materials of NiMn LDHs with varying loadings of graphene oxide (GO) using a hydrothermal method. Systematic physicochemical characterization of the synthesized materials, such as powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD), X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), field&#8208;emission scanning electron microscopy (FE&#8208;SEM), and Raman spectroscopy, revealed the influence of GO doping on the microstructure and electrochemical performance of NiMn LDHs. Electrochemical tests demonstrated that the NiMn LDHs/GO electrode material exhibited optimal electrochemical performance with a specific capacitance of 2096&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 current density and 1471&#8197;F&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, when GO doping level was 0.45&#8197;wt&#8201;%. Furthermore, after 1000 cycles of stability testing, the material retained 53.3&#8201;% capacitance at 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, indicating good cyclic stability. This study not only provides new directions for research on supercapacitor electrode materials but also offers new strategies for developing low&#8208;cost and efficient electrode materials.

Valence isomers of benzene have long attracted both synthetic and theoretical chemists due to their unique bonding and chemical reactivity. What new chemistry can be unlocked by introducing isosteric boron and nitrogen atoms in these structures? This concept paper highlights the recent development of boron(B)&#8208;nitrogen(N)&#8208;containing benzene valence isomers, specifically, BN&#8208;Dewar benzene and BN&#8208;benzvalene.







Abstract
Benzene is one of the most ubiquitous structural motifs in chemistry. The valence isomers of benzene have also attracted synthetic chemists&#8217; attention due to their unique structures, bonding, and reactivity. We have been investigating boron&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;containing benzene valence isomers via photoisomerization of 1,2&#8208;azaborines. In this contribution, we summarize recent developments of these highly strained BN&#8208;heterocyclic compounds including their synthesis, characterization, proposed mechanism of formation, and their potential applications.

         <title>Phosphorous and Nitrogen Dual&#8208;Doped Carbon as a Highly Efficient Electrocatalyst for Sodium&#8208;Oxygen Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 55, October 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The P, N co&#8208;doped carbon has been used as cathode materials in Na&#8208;O2 batteries. The high battery performance is ascribed to the high adsorption energy toward NaO2 of this advanced cathode materials. The high adsorption energy of NaO2 can prevent NaO2 from decomposing into hard&#8208;to&#8208;decompose Na2O2 during discharging and thus increase the battery efficiency during the cycles.







Abstract
Sodium&#8208;oxygen batteries have been regarded as promising energy storage devices due to their low overpotential and high energy density. Its applications, however, still face formidable challenges due to the lack of understanding about the influence of electrocatalysts on the discharge products. Here, a phosphorous and nitrogen dual&#8208;doped carbon (PNDC) based cathode is synthesized to increase the electrocatalytic activity and to stabilize the NaO2 superoxide nanoparticle discharge products, leading to enhanced cycling stability when compared to the nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon (NDC). The PNDC air cathode exhibits a low overpotential (0.36&#8197;V) and long cycling stability (120 cycles). The reversible formation/decomposition and stabilization of the NaO2 discharge products are clearly proven by in&#8208;situ synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction and ex&#8208;situ X&#8208;ray diffraction. Based on the density functional theory calculation, the PNDC has much stronger adsorption (&#8722;2.85&#8197;eV) for NaO2 than that of NDC (&#8722;1.80&#8197;eV), which could efficiently stabilize the NaO2 discharge products.

Based on the density functional theory calculation, the PNDC has much stronger adsorption (&#8722;2.85&#8197;eV) for NaO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; than that of NDC (&#8722;1.80&#8197;eV), which could efficiently stabilize the NaO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; discharge products.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Graphene&#8208;Molecule Hybridization at a Ferromagnetic Interface</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 55, October 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using angle&#8208;resolved photoemission and density functional theory, we show that introducing graphene as a buffer layer between a molecular layer and a ferromagnetic substrate nearly isolates the molecule electronically, yet hybridization persists. In particular, FePc/Gr/Co and F16FePc/Gr/Co reveal a &#960; hybrid state due to vertical interaction between graphene's pz state and the molecular &#960; core.







Abstract
The introduction of a graphene (Gr) buffer layer between a ferromagnetic substrate and a metallorganic molecule is known to mediate the magnetic coupling between them, an effect attributed to a weak hybridization between graphene and molecule. In this paper, we present experimental evidence of this effect through a detailed investigation of the frontier electronic properties of iron phthalocyanine deposited on cobalt&#8208;supported graphene. Despite being physisorbed, the molecular adsorption on Gr/Co induces a sizeable charge transfer from graphene to the molecular macrocycle leading to the partial occupation of the LUMO and the appearance of an energetically localized hybrid state, which can be attributed to the overlap between the graphene pz state and the molecular macrocycle. Graphene is not inert either; the adsorption of the molecule induces doping and alters the Fermi velocity of both the hybrid minicone state and the Dirac cone. Similar effects are observed when the molecular periphery is decorated with fluorine atoms, known for their electron&#8208;withdrawing properties, with minimal changes in the energy alignment.

         <title>Suppressing Protodeboronation in Cu&#8208;Mediated 19F/18F&#8208;Fluorination of Arylboronic Acids: A Mechanistically Guided Approach Towards Optimized PET Probe Development</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 55, October 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method was rationally optimized to minimize deleterious protodeboronation side&#8208;product in Cu&#8208;mediated 19F&#8208; and 18F&#8208;fluorination of arylboronic acids. Fluoride anion is activated through a hydrogen bond donor (HBD) effect under ligandless conditions featuring a new copper salt, Cu(ONf)2. This mild protocol occurs at lower temperature and demonstrates improved generality with good yields and radiochemical conversions and minimal protodeboronation.







Abstract
Fluorinated arenes play a crucial role in drug discovery, specialty materials, and medical imaging. Although several variants for Cu&#8208;mediated nucleophilic fluorination of arylboronic acids and derivatives have been developed, these protocols rarely address the occurrence and control of protodeboronation, which greatly complicates product separation and can compromise the effectiveness of a radiotracer for in&#8197;vivo imaging. Consequently, simpler and more efficient procedures are needed to allow rapid 18F/19F&#8208;fluorination of both arylboronic acids and esters while minimizing protodeboronation. Mechanistic controls revealed that in addition to a high temperature, strong donor ligands such as acetonitrile and pyridine accentuate a Cu&#8208;mediated protodeboronation. This observation guided the optimization of a ligandless procedure, with t&#8208;BuOH as solvent, to activate fluoride under milder conditions at lower temperatures minimizing protodeboronation. Additionally, a new copper salt, Cu(ONf)2 was employed to further improve the fluorination efficiency. A large range of functional groups are tolerated under the new procedure, which is complete within 30&#8197;minutes at a temperature of 60&#8201;&#176;C, and affords fluorinated arenes and heteroarenes in 39&#8201;% to 84&#8201;% yield. With minimal modifications, the protocol can also be applied in 18F&#8208;radiofluorination, affording radiochemical conversions (RCCs) between 17 and 54&#8201;% with minimal protodeboronation compared to previously established protocols.

         <title>Unexpectedly Regioselective Diels&#8208;Alder Reactions of New Unsymmetrical Benzoquinones: A Convenient Synthetic Entry to Uniquely Substituted Decalins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 55, October 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report flexible synthesis of new unsymmetrically 2,6&#8208;disubstituted benzoquinones (33 examples) and their Diels&#8208;Alder reactions proceeding with high (and rather unpredictable) regioselectivity. These experimental findings were rationalized by DFT calculations and exploited in the convenient preparation of uniquely substituted and stereochemically defined decalins, and a novel forskolin analog with ethyl group at the fusion of the rings B and C.







Abstract
We report flexible synthesis of new unsymmetrically 2,6&#8208;disubstituted benzoquinones (33 examples) and a systematic study of their reactivity in the Diels&#8208;Alder reaction. The Diels&#8208;Alder reactions of selected unsymmetrical benzoquinones with seemingly similar substituents were found to proceed with high regioselectivity and the formation of selected experimentally observed main products was rationalized by theoretical (DFT) calculations. The findings can be exploited in the convenient preparation of densely substituted and stereochemically defined decalins with unique angular substituents at ring fusion. We also demonstrate the usefulness of this methodology in complex molecule synthesis through the total synthesis of a novel forskolin analog possessing an ethyl group at the fusion of the rings B and C.

         <dc:description>
A series of biocompatible fluorescent carbazole&#8208;coumarins with robust photoluminescence quantum yields and thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) properties have been meticulously designed and synthesized. The TADF characteristics of these compounds were methodically investigated both in solution and in the solid state. Furthermore, the study showcased the promising practical applications of these compounds by integrating them into a Cmr&#8208;PMMA&#8208;based sensor for molecular oxygen detection.







Abstract
A series of fluorescent carbazole&#8208;coumarins exhibiting good photoluminescence quantum yields and thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) properties have been designed and synthetized using computer&#8208;aided density functional theory calculations. The TADF characteristics of the carbazole&#8208;coumarins were systematically explored both in solution and in the solid state, utilizing poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) as a matrix. The study revealed that the introduction of carbazole units onto the coumarin benzene ring led to compounds with thermally induced reverse intersystem crossing and delayed fluorescence. The study further demonstrated the potential utility of these compounds in practical applications by incorporating them into a Cmr&#8208;PMMA&#8208;based sensor for molecular oxygen detection. The resulting sensor exhibited promising performance, highlighting the adaptability and efficacy of the synthesized TADF&#8208;carbazole&#8208;coumarin compounds for reversible molecular oxygen sensing.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 55, October 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A family of new push&#8211;pull functionalized norbornadiene/quadricyclane (NBD/QC) couples was generated and investigated. For the first time the para&#8208;tolylsulfone moiety was chosen as electron&#8208;withdrawing group. The library was comprehensively examined regarding their interconversion capability and photophysical properties.







Abstract
We report the synthesis and characterization of library of new 2,3&#8211;disubstituted norbornadiene/quadricyclane couples. For the first time, the para&#8211;tolylsulfone moiety was employed as electron&#8211;withdrawing substituent in combination with a variety of different electron donors as counterparts. Comprehensive characterization was conducted for every interconversion couple. By comparison with structurally related molecules published before we established the tosyl moiety as suitable alternative to previously investigated ester functionalities by providing similar photophysical properties. The photo&#8211;induced interconversion behavior was investigated via UV/Vis&#8208; and NMR&#8211;spectroscopy. The UV/Vis experiments were carried out exclusively in acetonitrile, whereas several solvents were investigated in the NMR studies. A detailed description and comparison of the isomerization behavior is provided, while examining relevant optical properties like &#955;max and &#955;onset. Thereby, an enhanced red&#8208;shift up to &#955;max=394&#8197;nm combined with an &#955;onset value of 469&#8197;nm could be generated which is necessary for potential applications.

         <title>Chiral Sulfoximine Mediated Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed Atropselective C&#8722;H Annulation of Ynamides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 55, October 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Cp*Co(III)&#8208;catalyzed stereoselective annulation of arenes with ynamides has led to the synthesis of axially chiral five&#8208;membered 2&#8208;amidoindenones. The chiral sulfoximine directing group plays crucial; the sulfoximine moiety is cleaved and reused. DFT studies shed insights in understanding the origin of asymmetric induction.







Abstract
An achiral Cp*Co(III)&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective C&#8722;H activation/annulation of chiral sulfoximine&#8208;enabled thioamides with ynamides is presented herein. This method successfully synthesizes axially chiral five&#8208;membered 2&#8208;amidoindenones with good enantiocontrol. Interestingly, the annulation with chiral oxazolidone&#8208;containing ynamides could provide a separable mixture of diastereomers (up to ~10&#8201;:&#8201;1 dr). Moreover, enantiopure sulfoximines could be recovered with ~99&#8201;% purity, making this method practical. DFT studies show valuable insight into the mechanism and origin of asymmetric induction.

         <title>Protein&#8208;Protein Stabilization in VIVO/8&#8208;Hydroxyquinoline&#8211;Lysozyme Adducts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 55, October 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interaction of potential drug [VIVO(8&#8208;HQ)2], with 8&#8208;HQ = 8&#8208;hydroxyquinolinato, with lysozyme results in the formation of a non&#8208;covalent adduct with [VIVO(8&#8208;HQ)2(H2O)] and covalent with [VIVO(8&#8208;HQ)(H2O)]+ upon the binding to Asp119. Covalent binding is favored by a &#960;&#8208;&#960; contact with Trp62 of another protein molecule, unveiling the role of protein&#8208;protein interaction in the stabilization of metal&#8208;protein adducts.







Abstract
The binding of the potential drug [VIVO(8&#8208;HQ)2], where 8&#8208;HQ is 8&#8208;hydroxyquinolinato, with hen egg white lysozyme (HEWL) was evaluated through spectroscopic (electron paramagnetic resonance, EPR, and UV&#8208;visible), spectrometric (electrospray ionization&#8208;mass spectrometry, ESI&#8208;MS), crystallographic (X&#8208;ray diffraction, XRD), and computational (DFT and docking) studies. ESI&#8208;MS indicates the interaction of [VIVO(8&#8208;HQ)(H2O)]+ and [VIVO(8&#8208;HQ)2(H2O)] species with HEWL. Room temperature EPR spectra suggest both covalent and non&#8208;covalent binding of the two different V&#8208;containing fragments. XRD analyses confirm these findings, showing that [VIVO(8&#8208;HQ)(H2O)]+ interacts covalently with the solvent exposed Asp119, while cis&#8208;[VIVO(8&#8208;HQ)2(H2O)] non&#8208;covalently with Arg128 and Lys96 from a symmetry mate. The covalent binding of [VIVO(8&#8208;HQ)(H2O)]+ to Asp119 is favored by a &#960;&#8208;&#960; contact with Trp62 and a H&#8208;bond with Asn103 of a symmetry&#8208;related molecule. Additionally, the covalent binding of VVO2+ to Asp48 and non&#8208;covalent binding of other V&#8208;containing fragments to Arg5, Cys6, and Glu7 are revealed. Molecular docking indicates that, in the absence of the interactions occurring at the protein&#8208;protein interface close to Asp119, the covalent binding to Glu35 or Asp52 should be preferred. Such a protein&#8208;protein stabilization could be more common than what believed up today, at least in the solid state, and should be considered in the characterization of metal&#8208;protein adducts.

         <title>Stacking Transformation&#8208;Triggered Circularly Polarized Luminescence Reversion in &#947;&#8208;Cyclodextrins&#8208;Pyrene Co&#8208;Assembly</title>

CPL signal direction of cyclodextrins&#8208;pyrene co&#8208;assembly can be regulated through host&#8208;guest interaction&#8208;induced stacking transformation, demonstrating that (+)&#8208; and (&#8722;)&#8208;CPL of pyrene&#8208;pyrene excimer is originated from right&#8208; and left&#8208;handed stacking conformation in &#947;&#8208;cyclodextrins, respectively.







Abstract
Considerable attention has been directed towards cyclodextrins (CDs) in the creation of co&#8208;assembled CPL&#8208;active materials, owing to their intrinsic chiral host cavities and synergistic host&#8208;guest interactions. However, achieving reversed CPL emission regulation with single&#8208;handedness CDs moiety poses a significant challenge. In this study, we have devised a series of &#947;&#8208;CD&#8208;based host&#8208;guest complexes comprising dual pyrene imidazolium derivatives with multiple linkers, which exhibit reversed circularly polarized emission. We have uncovered that the transformation of excimer stacking within &#947;&#8208;CD/pyrene complexes contributes to the inverted CPL emissions originating from a single&#8208;handed chiral host. This research elucidates the phenomenon of (+)&#8208; and (&#8722;)&#8208;circularly polarized excimer emission (CPEE) within &#947;&#8208;CD, arising from right&#8208; and left&#8208;handed stacking conformations, respectively.

A convertible cyanine/hemicyanine PA dye platform Cy&#8208;HCy with optimized NIR ratiometric PA properties and tunable tumor&#8208;targeting capabilities for PA probe development and precise colorectal liver metastasis diagnosis.







Abstract
Photoacoustic (PA) tomography is an emerging biomedical imaging technology for precision cancer medicine. Conventional small&#8208;molecule PA probes usually exhibit a single PA signal and poor tumor targeting that lack the imaging reliability. Here, we introduce a series of cyanine/hemicyanine interconversion dyes (denoted Cy&#8208;HCy) for PA/fluorescent dual&#8208;mode probe development that features optimized ratiometric PA imaging and tunable tumor&#8208;targeting ability for precise diagnosis and resection of colorectal cancer (CRC). Importantly, Cy&#8208;HCy can be presented in cyanine (inherent tumor targeting and long NIR PA wavelength) and hemicyanine (poor tumor targeting and short NIR PA wavelength) by fine&#8208;tuning torsion angle and the ingenious transformation between cyanine and hemicyanine through regulation optically tunable group endows the NIR ratiometric PA and tunable tumor&#8208;targeting properties. To demonstrate the applicability of Cy&#8208;HCy dyes, we designed the first small&#8208;molecule tumor&#8208;targeting and NIR ratiometric PA probe Cy&#8208;HCy&#8208;H2S for precise CRC liver metastasis diagnosis, activated by H2S (a CRC biomarker). Using this probe, we not only visualized the subcutaneous tumor and liver metastatic cancers in CRC mouse models but also realized PA and fluorescence image&#8208;guided tumor excision. We expect that Cy&#8208;HCy will be generalized for creating a wide variety of inherently tumor&#8208;targeting NIR ratiometric PA probes in oncological research and practice.

         <title>The Effect of Reactive Oxygen Species on Respiratory Complex I Activity in Liposomes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 55, October 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Respiratory complex I (R&#8208;CI) is a major contributor to reactive oxygen species (ROS) in mitochondria. By reconstituting R&#8208;CI into artificial membrane vesicles and in conjunction with EPR spectroscopy, the effects of ROS are investigated. The activity of R&#8208;CI is reduced because of ROS, not only by damaging the enzyme but also by making the membrane more polar and protic.







Abstract
Respiratory complex I (R&#8208;CI) is an essential enzyme in the mitochondrial electron transport chain but also a major source of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are implicated in neurodegenerative diseases and ageing. While the mechanism of ROS production by R&#8208;CI is well&#8208;established, the feedback of ROS on R&#8208;CI activity is poorly understood. Here, we perform EPR spectroscopy on R&#8208;CI incorporated in artificial membrane vesicles to reveal that ROS (particularly hydroxyl radicals) reduce R&#8208;CI activity by making the membrane more polar and by increasing its hydrogen bonding capability. Moreover, the mechanism that we have uncovered reveals that the feedback of ROS on R&#8208;CI activity via the membrane is transient and not permanent; lipid peroxidation is negligible for the levels of ROS generated under these conditions. Our successful use of modular proteoliposome systems in conjunction with EPR spectroscopy and other biophysical techniques is a powerful approach for investigating ROS effects on other membrane proteins.

         <title>Green Synthesis of the Triazine Derivatives and their Application for the Benign Electrocatalytic Reaction of Nitrate Reduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 55, October 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The paper studies the process of eco&#8208;friendly microwave assisted synthesis of a material based on triazine compounds and the possibility of its use as part of a hybrid catalyst for the electrochemical synthesis of ammonia under mild conditions by the NO3RR reaction.







Abstract
This work uses green sustainable reactions twice. Firstly, it is microwave synthesis: 2,4,6&#8208;tribiphenyl&#8208;4&#8208;yl&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine and similar compounds were prepared in a closed microwave reactor in n&#8208;octane by the Friedel&#8208;Crafts reaction. Second, a hybrid electrocatalyst for the highly demanded electrochemical reaction of nitrate reduction to ammonia (NO3RR) was prepared based on this material. This reaction has great potential to replace the energy&#8208;intensive Haber&#8208;Bosch process, and in addition, has independent value for the elimination of nitrate contamination of water resources. As shown in the work, microwave synthesis is an eco&#8208;friendly method for the synthesis of complex organic compounds; fast, selective and with a high yield of the target product. The electrocatalyst deposited on the graphite electrode consisted of a layer of 2,4&#8208;bis([1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl]&#8208;4&#8208;yl)&#8208;6&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine and related compounds coated with cobalt oxide. The hybrid catalyst was firmly retained on the graphite electrode during NO3RR and the material showed impressive stability with almost no decrease in catalytic activity even after the fifth cycle. Both 2,4&#8208;bis([1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl]&#8208;4&#8208;yl)&#8208;6&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine and the catalyst based on this substance were characterized by SEM, XPS, XRD, UV&#8208;vis spectra, cyclic (and linear) voltammetry, and chronoamperometry. This work can serve as a starting point for the development of stable and durable electrocatalysts for NO3RR using triazine derivatives.

         <title>Advancing Optoglycomics: Two Orthogonal Azobenzene Glycoside Antennas in One Glycocluster&#8211;Synthesis, Switching Cycles, Kinetics and Molecular Dynamics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 55, October 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new tool for the glycosciences: A heterobivalent glycocluster combines two photoswitchable azobenzene glycoside antennas with different photochromic properties. Hence, wavelength&#8208;selective E/Z isomerization of the glycoantennas is enabled and a switching cycle comprising three major isomers (EE, EZ, ZZ). Kinetic analysis explains the relaxation mechanism and MD simulations illustrate the relationship between isomeric state and distance between the sugar ligands.







Abstract
Carbohydrate recognition is essential for numerous biological processes and is governed by various factors within the supramolecular environment of the cell. Photoswitchable glycoconjugates have proven as valuable tools for the investigation and modulation of carbohydrate recognition as they allow to control the relative orientation of sugar ligands by light. In order to advance the possibilities of such an &#8220;optoglycomics&#8221; approach for the glycosciences, we have synthesized a biantennary glycocluster in which two glycoazobenzene antennas are conjugated to the 3&#8208; and 6&#8208;position of a scaffold glycoside. Orthogonal isomerization of the photoswitchable units was made possible by the different conjugation of the azobenzene moieties via an oxygen and a sulfur atom, respectively, and the ortho&#8208;fluorination of one of the azobenzene units. This design enabled a switching cycle comprising the EE, EZ and the ZZ isomer. This is the first example of an orthogonally photoswitchable glycocluster. The full analysis of its photochromic properties included the investigation of the isolated glycoazobenzene antennas allowing the comparison of the intra&#8208; versus the intermolecular orthogonal photoswitching. The kinetics of the thermal relaxation were analyzed in detail. A molecular dynamics study shows that indeed, the relative orientation of the glycoantennas and the distances between the terminal sugar ligands significantly vary depending on the isomeric state, as intended.

         <title>Theoretical Insight into Complexation Between Cyclocarbons and C60 Fullerene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 55, October 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The binding energy between cyclocarbons and C60 fullerene is significantly stronger than that between two C18 or two C60 fullerenes. As the ring size increases, the angle between the cyclocarbons of the 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 trimers formed by two cyclocarbons and C60 fullerene gradually decreases. The research results on the 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 trimers formed by cyclocarbon and two C60 fullerenes showed when the cyclocarbon is not quite large, the trimers exhibit an ideal dumbbell&#8208;like structure.







Abstract
This work conducts a comprehensive theoretical study on the non&#8208;covalent complexation between cyclocarbons and C60 fullerene for the first time. The binding energy between cyclocarbons and C60 fullerene is significantly stronger than that between two C18 or two C60 fullerenes, indicating a particularly strong affinity. The cyclocarbons and C60 fullerene can spontaneously assemble into complexes in the gas phase at room temperature, and the hydrophobic effect caused by the solvent environment can promote this binding. The binding strength with C60 fullerene increases almost linearly with the increase of cyclocarbon size, and the C34@C60 dimer exhibits a perfect nano&#8208;Saturn structure. As the ring size increases, the angle between the two cyclocarbons of the 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 trimers formed by cyclocarbons and C60 fullerene gradually decreases. In C60@2&#8197;C34 trimer, the fullerene is symmetrically surrounded by two cyclocarbons. The results on the trimers formed by cyclocarbon and C60 fullerenes in a 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 ratio showed when the cyclocarbon sandwiched between two fullerenes is not quite large, the trimers exhibit an ideal dumbbell&#8208;like structure, and the presence of the first fullerene has a significant synergistic effect on the binding of the second one. The cyclocarbon greatly promotes the dimerization of fullerenes, which acted as a &#8220;molecular glue&#8221;.

&lt;p&gt;The binding energy between cyclocarbons and C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; fullerene is significantly stronger than that between two C&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt; or two C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; fullerenes.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work conducts a comprehensive theoretical study on the non-covalent complexation between cyclocarbons and C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; fullerene for the first time. The binding energy between cyclocarbons and C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; fullerene is significantly stronger than that between two C&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt; or two C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; fullerenes, indicating a particularly strong affinity. The cyclocarbons and C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; fullerene can spontaneously assemble into complexes in the gas phase at room temperature, and the hydrophobic effect caused by the solvent environment can promote this binding. The binding strength with C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; fullerene increases almost linearly with the increase of cyclocarbon size, and the C&lt;sub&gt;34&lt;/sub&gt;@C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; dimer exhibits a perfect nano-Saturn structure. As the ring size increases, the angle between the two cyclocarbons of the 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 trimers formed by cyclocarbons and C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; fullerene gradually decreases. In C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;@2&#8197;C&lt;sub&gt;34&lt;/sub&gt; trimer, the fullerene is symmetrically surrounded by two cyclocarbons. The results on the trimers formed by cyclocarbon and C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; fullerenes in a 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 ratio showed when the cyclocarbon sandwiched between two fullerenes is not quite large, the trimers exhibit an ideal dumbbell-like structure, and the presence of the first fullerene has a significant synergistic effect on the binding of the second one. The cyclocarbon greatly promotes the dimerization of fullerenes, which acted as a &#8220;molecular glue&#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Superior Tumor Cell Uptake by Mono&#8208; and Tri&#8208;Nuclear Rhodamine&#8208;Gadolinium(III) Agents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 55, October 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Superior cell uptake and tumor cell selectivity at low incubation concentrations by new mono&#8208; and tri&#8208;nuclear rhodamine&#8208;gadolinium(III) agents are reported, offering potential dual MRI/fluorescent probes for advanced theranostic applications.







Abstract
The synthesis and characterization of a novel trinuclear rhodamine&#8208;Gd(III) complex, along with two analogous mononuclear rhodamine&#8208;Gd(III) complexes, are reported. All complexes displayed good selectivity in a human glioma cell line (T98G) when compared to a glial cell line (SVG p12), with low cytotoxicities. Superior tumor cell uptake for these Gd(III) complexes was observed at lower incubation concentrations compared to previously&#8208;reported delocalized lipophilic cations such as a rhodamine&#8208;lanthanoid(III) probe and Gd(III)&#8208;arylphosphonium complexes, with ca. 150&#8201;% and 250&#8201;% increases in Gd uptake, respectively.

         <title>The Conformational Behaviour of Fluorinated Tetrahydrothiopyran</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 55, October 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrostatic interactions played a significant role in stabilizing the axial fluorine orientation of fluorinated tetrahydrothiopyran, occasionally supported by stereoelectronic interactions. These combined forces were observed to stabilize less polar conformers of fluorinated tetrahydrothiopyrans even in polar solutions. Both experimental and computational investigations were thoroughly conducted on a variety of fluorinated tetrahydrothiopyran derivatives.







Abstract
We present a comprehensive study on the conformational behavior of diversely substituted 4&#8208;fluorotetrahydrothiopyran derivatives. Through quantum chemical simulations including DFT as well as NBO and NPA analysis, we elucidate the pivotal role of electrostatic interactions, occasionally complemented by hyperconjugative interactions, in stabilizing axial fluorine conformers. Less polar conformers were occasionally obtained, attributed to the interplay of electrostatic and hyperconjugative interactions. Experimental validation through NMR spectroscopy aligns with the computational analysis, thus providing a coherent understanding of the structural dynamics of these compounds.

         <title>Modular Synthesis of High Performance Energetic Biocidal Bicyclic Compounds Derivated from Iodopyrazoles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 55, October 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modular synthesis for energetic biocidal materials was represented. Iodopyrazole precursors 1&#8211;2 were synthesized for the first time as biocidal modules, and then C&#8722;N coupling reactions were carried out with two energetic modules respectively to obtain bicyclic molecules 3&#8211;6 in one&#8208;step facile method. 5 and 6 exhibited highest gas production (V) of 212.85&#8197;L&#8201;mol&#8722;1, 217.66&#8197;L&#8201;mol&#8722;1, respectively so far.







Abstract
Modular synthesis can combine different functional modules to flexibly regulate comprehensive properties and study the diversity of compounds. This study established a modular bicyclic synthesis strategy of combining polynitro energetic module with iodine&#8208;containing biocidal module. Compounds 1&#8211;6 with high iodine content (48.72&#8211;69.56&#8201;%) and high thermal stability (Td: 172&#8211;304&#8201;&#176;C) were synthesized and exhaustively identified. By modular synthesis, the detonation properties and gas&#8208;production of 3&#8211;6 improved greatly expanding their biocidal efficacy and maintained the iodine atomic utilization of iodine&#8208;containing module. Notably, 4,5&#8208;diiodo&#8208;3,4&#8217;,5&#8217;&#8208;trinitro&#8208;1,3&#8217;&#8208;bipyrazole (5) and 3,5&#8208;diiodo&#8208;4,4&#8217;,5&#8217;&#8208;trinitro&#8208;1,3&#8217;&#8208;bipyrazole (6) exhibit high detonation velocities (D: 5903&#8197;m&#8201;s&#8722;1, 5769&#8197;m&#8201;s&#8722;1, respectively) and highest gas production of 212.85&#8197;L&#8201;mol&#8722;1 and 217.66&#8197;L&#8201;mol&#8722;1 after decomposition. This study diversifies polyiodio&#8208;nitro compounds, and also inspire the implementation of similar synthesis strategies to provide family&#8208;level synthetic solutions to energetic biocidal materials.

         <title>Cooperative NHC and Photoredox Catalyzed Radical Aminoacylation of Alkenes to Tetrahydropyridazines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 55, October 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) radical organocatalysis offers a powerful platform to construct valuable molecules. Herein, we report the synthesis of 1,4,5,6&#8208;tetrahydropyridazines through cooperative NHC/photoredox catalysis. The aminoacylation reaction involves a 6&#8208;endo&#8208;trig cyclization of N&#8208;centered radicals, followed by radical&#8208;radical coupling of the resulting benzylic radicals with ketyl radicals, which are generated via single&#8208;electron reduction of in&#8197;situ formed acyl azolium ions.







Abstract
Tetrahydropyridazines constitute an important structural motif found in numerous natural products and pharmaceutical compounds. Herein, we report an aminoacylation reaction of alkenes that enables the synthesis of 1,4,5,6&#8208;tetrahydropyridazines through cooperative N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) and photoredox catalysis. This approach involves the 6&#8208;endo&#8208;trig cyclization of N&#8208;centered hydrazonyl radicals, generated via single&#8208;electron oxidation of hydrazones, followed by a radical&#8211;radical coupling step. The mild process tolerates a wide range of common functional groups and affords a variety of tetrahydropyridazines in moderate to high yields. Preliminary investigations using chiral NHC catalysts demonstrate the potential of this protocol for asymmetric radical reactions.

         <title>Switchable Deep Eutectic Solvents for Sustainable Sulfonamide Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 55, October 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sustainable and scalable synthesis of sulfonamides, from amines and sulfonyl chlorides, is achieved under aerobic conditions, at ambient temperature, in reusable choline chloride&#8208;based deep eutectic solvents. The interplay of electronic effects and the solubility characteristics of the starting materials in the selected DESs drives the sulfonamide synthesis over the hydrolysis of sulfonyl chlorides.







Abstract
A sustainable and scalable protocol for synthesizing variously functionalized sulfonamides, from amines and sulfonyl chlorides, has been developed using environmentally responsible and reusable choline chloride (ChCl)&#8208;based deep eutectic solvents (DESs). In ChCl/glycerol (1&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8197;mol&#8201;mol&#8722;1) and ChCl/urea (1&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8197;mol&#8201;mol&#8722;1), these reactions yield up to 97&#8201;% under aerobic conditions at ambient temperature within 2&#8211;12&#8197;h. The practicality of the method is exemplified by the sustainable synthesis of an FFA4 agonist and a key building block en route to anti&#8208;Alzheimer drug BMS&#8208;299897. A subtle interplay of electronic effects and the solubility characteristics of the starting materials in the aforementioned DESs seem to be responsible for driving the reaction successfully over the hydrolysis of sulfonyl chlorides. The procedure's eco&#8208;friendliness is validated by quantitative metrics like the E&#8208;factor and the EcoScale, with products isolated by extraction or filtration after decantation.

         <title>On&#8208;Surface Stepwise Double Dehydrogenation for the Formation of a para&#8208;Quinodimethane&#8208;Containing Undecacene Isomer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 55, October 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of an undecacene isomer with unique structural features, including two cyclobutadiene and two para&#8208;quinodimethane (p&#8208;QDM) moieties within the 1D polycyclic system, was achieved via a novel on&#8208;surface dehydrogenation reaction induced by voltage pulses. This work broadens the arsenal of on&#8208;surface synthesis methods and provides new insights into modifying the electronic properties of acene analogs through the incorporation of nonbenzenoid rings.







Abstract
The on&#8208;surface synthesis of an isomer of undecacene, bearing two four&#8208;membered rings and two para&#8208;quinodimethane moieties, starting from a tetramethyl&#8208;substituted diepoxy precursor, is presented. The transformation implies a thermal double deoxygenation followed by a stepwise double dehydrogenation reaction on the Au(111) surface, locally induced by inelastic tunneling electrons. This results in the transformation of para&#8208;dimethylbenzene moieties into non&#8208;aromatic para&#8208;quinodimethanes. The structures and electronic properties of the intermediate and final products are investigated at the single molecule level with high spatial resolution, using both scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy and non&#8208;contact atomic force microscopy. The experimental results are supported by density functional theory calculations.

         <title>Insight from Electrochemical Analysis in the Radical Cation State of a Monopyrrolotetrathiafulvalene&#8208;Based [2]Rotaxane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 55, October 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical studies on a bistable [2]rotaxane incorporating a monopyrrolotetrathiafulvalene (MPTTF) unit (green) and an oxyphenylene (OP) moiety (red) in the dumbbell component and encircled by the cyclobis(paraquat&#8208;p&#8208;phenylene) (CBPQT4+) ring (blue) was used to profile the energy landscapes when the CBPQT4+ ring moves across the MPTTF unit in all of its three accessible redox states (0, +1, and +2).







Abstract
Mechanically interlocked molecules are a class of compounds used for controlling directional movement when barriers can be raised and lowered using external stimuli. Applied voltages can turn on redox states to alter electrostatic barriers but their use for directing motion requires knowledge of their impact on the kinetics. Herein, we make the first measurements on the movement of cyclobis(paraquat&#8208;p&#8208;phenylene) (CBPQT4+) across the radical&#8208;cation state of monopyrrolotetrathiafulvalene (MPTTF) in a [2]rotaxane using variable scan&#8208;rate electrochemistry. The [2]rotaxane is designed in a way that directs CBPQT4+ to a high&#8208;energy co&#8208;conformation upon oxidation of MPTTF to either the radical cation (MPTTF&#8901;+) or the dication (MPTTF2+). 1H&#160;NMR spectroscopic investigations carried out in acetonitrile at 298&#8197;K showed direct interconversion to the thermodynamically more stable ground&#8208;state co&#8208;conformation with CBPQT4+ moving across the oxidized MPTTF2+ electrostatic barrier. The electrochemical studies revealed that interconversion takes place by movement of CBPQT4+ across both the MPTTF&#8226;+ (19.3&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1) and MPTTF2+ (18.7&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1) barriers. The outcome of our studies shows that MPTTF has three accessible redox states that can be used to kinetically control the movement of the ring component in mechanically interlocked molecules.

Gearing up double&#8208;decker complexes. A prototype of a molecular gear has been synthesized in 12 steps, using a helical naphthalocyanine ligand as rotating cogwheels and a thioether octa&#8208;functionalized phthalocyanine as anchoring stator.







Abstract
This paper describes the synthesis of a cerium(IV)&#8208;based molecular gear composed of a thioether functionalized phthalocyanine anchoring ligand, and a helical naphthalocyanine rotating cogwheel functionalized with four carbazoles. The naphthalocyanine ligand 9 was obtained after eleven steps (overall yield of 0.2&#8201;%) as a mixture of three geometrical isomers, two of which are chiral and exhibit high levels of steric hindrance, as shown by DFT calculations. Their attributions have been made using 1H&#8208;NMR based on their different symmetry groups. The ratio of isomers was also determined and the prochiral C4h naphthalocyanine shown to be the major compound (55&#8201;%). Its heteroleptic complexation with cerium (IV) and the anchoring phthalocyanine ligand 10 gave the targeted molecular gear in a 16&#8201;% yield.

         <title>Benzoic Acid Serves as Precursor of Catalytic HAT Reagent in a Two&#8208;Molecule Photoredox System</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 55, October 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aryl carboxy radicals generated from benzoic acids in a two&#8208;molecule photoredox system can function as catalytic HAT reagents. Various acetals, ethers, alcohols, and alkenes can be employed in the photoreaction to provide both high yields of adducts and high recoveries of benzoic acids.







Abstract
The photoinduced regioselective HAT reactions of acetals, ethers, and alcohols using benzoic acids in a two&#8208;molecule photoredox system led to the formation of new C&#8722;C bonds with alkenes under mild conditions. Aryl carboxy radicals generated from benzoic acids in a two&#8208;molecule photoredox system can function as catalytic HAT reagents, even though an excess amount of a hydrogen donor substrate is required. Various acetals, ethers, alcohols, and alkenes can be employed in the photoreaction to provide both high yields of adducts and high recoveries of benzoic acids.

A 3D adaptation of the simplified isomerization cycle between norbornadiene (NBD) and quadricyclane (QC) species is depicted. The NBD scaffold on the left is colored in metallic blue and the respective QC isomer in red. The orientation of both species is identical to highlight the structural change. Both substituents of the push&#8211;pull system, including the newly investigated para&#8208;tolylsulfone moiety are colored matte black to keep the focus on NBD/QC interconversion. More information can be found in the Research Article by D. Krappmann and A. Hirsch (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202401391).

Benzoic acid can work as a precursor of the catalytic HAT reagent in a two&#8208;molecule photoredox system. This image shows the moment of hydrogen abstraction from the acetal by the aryl carboxy radical generated from 4&#8208;tert&#8208;butylbenzoic acid in the two&#8208;molecule photoredox system using biphenyl and 9,10&#8208;dicyanoanthracene. More information can be found in the Research Article by Y. Yoshimi and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202402285).

         <title>Cover Feature: The Effect of Reactive Oxygen Species on Respiratory Complex I Activity in Liposomes (Chem. Eur. J. 55/2024)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 55, October 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The enzyme respiratory complex&#8197;I is a major contributor to reactive oxygen species (ROS) in mitochondria. How complex&#8197;I produces ROS has been investigated extensively. However, it has been difficult to understand the downstream effect of these ROS. Here, researchers put complex&#8197;I into artificial membrane vesicles doped with spin&#8208;labelled lipids to &#8220;spy&#8221; on the ROS by using EPR spectroscopy. They show that reversible changes in the membrane, caused by ROS, decrease complex&#8197;I activity. More information can be found in the Research Article by M.&#8197;M. Roessler and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202402035).

         <title>Computer&#8208;Aided Synthesis Planning (CASP) and Machine Learning: Optimizing Chemical Reaction Conditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 55, October 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper reviews the topic of the Computer Aided Synthesis Project (CASP) and gives a detailed overview of the methods of machine learning to predict chemical reaction conditions, including the problem of data and descriptor selection, the indicators for the evaluation of results and the current research progress of various algorithms. The future research trends and possible challenges in chemical condition prediction are prospected.







Abstract
Computer&#8208;aided synthesis planning (CASP) has garnered increasing attention in light of recent advancements in machine learning models. While the focus is on reverse synthesis or forward outcome prediction, optimizing reaction conditions remains a significant challenge. For datasets with multiple variables, the choice of descriptors and models is pivotal. This selection dictates the effective extraction of conditional features and the achievement of higher prediction accuracy. This review delineates the origins of data in conditional optimization, the criteria for descriptor selection, the response models, and the metrics for outcome evaluation, aiming to acquaint readers with the latest research trends and facilitate more informed research in this domain.

         <title>Electrolytes for Aluminum&#8208;Ion Batteries: Progress and Outlook</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 55, October 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review presents an overview of recent advances in electrolytes in aluminum&#8208;ion batteries (AIBs). AIB electrolytes mainly include liquid and solid electrolytes. The main research directions in liquid electrolytes for AIBs mainly include electrolyte solutes, &#8220;water&#8208;in&#8208;salt&#8221; (WIS) electrolytes, and electrolyte additives







Abstract
Aluminum&#8208;ion batteries (AIBs) are promising electrochemical energy storage sources because of their high theoretical specific capacity, light weight, zero pollution, safety, inexpensiveness, and abundant resources. These theoretical advantages have recently made AIBs a research hotspot. However, electrolyte&#8208;related issues significantly limit their commercialization. The electrolyte choices for AIBs are significantly limited, and most of the available options do not facilitate the Al3+/Al three&#8208;electron transfer reaction. Thus, this review presents an overview of recent advances in electrolytes and modification strategies for AIBs to clarify the limitations of existing AIB electrolytes and offer guidance for improving their performance. Furthermore, herein, the advantages, limitations and possible solutions for each electrolyte are discussed, after which the future of AIB electrolytes is envisioned.

         <title>Preparation of Large Perphenylbiaryls: Can Intermolecular Coupling Compete with Intramolecular Cyclization of Precursors?</title>

         <title>Electrochemical oxidation of UV filters: A first&#8208;principles molecular dynamics study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A theoretical model is proposed to study the oxidation mechanisms of the organic UV filters BP3 and BP4 during electrochemical water treatment utilizing Car&#8208;Parrinello molecular dynamics. Factors such as the amount of solvent to be included and how to design the system with the least possible intervention are discussed. The stages of the proposed model consist of the optimization of the geometries by density functional theory methods, the equilibration of the structure immersed in a water box, the inclusion of the reactive species, and the analysis of the reaction energies of each reaction pathway. The ab&#8208;initio molecular dynamics simulations lead to several products, and some trends can be identified, in accordance with the well&#8208;known reactivity rules of organic chemistry. The products proposed in this work are intermediates in longer oxidative pathways.</dc:description>

         <title>The Changing Phases of Bromopentafluorobenzene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As part of a much larger study on non&#8208;covalent interactions in binary adducts, we have explored the solid&#8208;state structures of bromopentafluorobenzene (C6F5Br) using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), variable&#8208;temperature powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (VT&#8208;PXRD), and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SXD). DSC data initially indicated a single solid&#8208;state phase below the freezing point, but revealed additional weak transitions upon heating. The crystal structures of three solid&#8208;state phases have been solved. The SXD data showed that phases I and IV are centrosymmetric, whilst phase II is polar. However, the structure of phase III remains elusive due to the changing phase behaviour of C6F5Br that is determined as much as by kinetics as thermodynamics. The results underline the need for multiple analytical techniques to study non&#8208;covalent interactions and offer valuable data for refining computational models in crystal structure prediction and machine learning. A comparison with the iodinated counterpart is also made.</dc:description>

         <title>3D Covalent Organic Framework Membranes for Molecular Separations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Membrane separation has become an indispensable separation technology in social production, playing an important role in drug production, water purification, etc. The key core of membranes lies in achieving efficient and precise sieving between substances. As a result, a typical trade&#8208;off arises: highly permeable membranes usually sacrifice selectivity and vice versa. To address this dilemma, long&#8208;term research has focused on comprehensive understanding and modelling of synthetic membranes at various scales. A significant advancement in this arena is the advent of three&#8208;dimensional covalent organic framework (3D COF) membranes, a novel category of long&#8208;range ordered porous organic polymer materials. Characterized by an abundance of interconnected channels, diverse pore wall properties, tunable structures, and robust thermal and chemical resilience, 3D COF membranes offer a promising approach for efficient substance separation. This review undertakes a meticulous investigation of the synthesis and physicochemical properties of 3D COF membranes, accentuating the underlying design principles, fabrication methods, and application attempts. A comprehensive assessment of their research trajectory and current standing in the field of membrane processes is provided. The review culminates in a forward&#8208;looking outlook, summarizing future research directions and highlighting the substantial potential of this innovative work to shape the future of efficient membrane separation processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanistic Insights into the Effect of Sodium Iodide on Copper&#8208;Mediated Iododeboronation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The copper&#8208;catalyzed Chan&#8208;Evans&#8208;Lam&#160;(CEL) coupling reaction advances carbon&#8211;heteroatom cross&#8208;coupling and has facilitated the development of radiohalogenation methodologies in radiochemistry. This study investigated the mechanisms and side reactions of CEL iodination under conditions relevant to radiosynthesis and typical organic synthesis, focusing on the effects of sodium iodide. The concentrations of copper and iodide, as well as the copper&#8208;to&#8208;iodide ratio, were identified as significant factors for successful copper&#8208;mediated CEL iodination, influencing the reaction mechanisms and side reactions. Excess iodide relative to the copper salt led to the formation of poorly soluble iodinated copper(I) complexes that competed with that of the desired aryl iodide. Additionally, the predominant copper complex involved in the catalytic cycle differed between the early and late stages of the reaction, depending on the copper&#8208;to&#8208;iodide ratio. The results of this study indicate that the specialized radiosynthesis conditions meet the requirements for efficient CEL iodination. In particular, an extremely low concentration of iodide is optimal for CEL iodination. These in&#8208;depth mechanistic insights not only provide a detailed comparison of CEL iodination across radiochemistry and synthetic organic chemistry but can also inspire the development of novel (radio)iodination methods.</dc:description>

         <title>A New Mechanism for Formation of Glycine from Glyoxylic acid: the Aza&#8208;Cannizzaro Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glyoxylic acid and glycine are widely considered to have been important prebiotic building blocks. Several mechanistic routes have been previously examined for conversion of glyoxylic acid to glycine. Here we provide evidence for a new mechanistic path. Glycine is spontaneously formed from glyoxylic acid in ammonium&#8208;rich aqueous solutions at neutral pH; oxamic acid is generated as well. Hydride transfer from the glyoxylate&#8208;derived hemiaminal to the corresponding iminium ion appears to underlie this transformation. This proposed mechanism parallels the well&#8208;known Cannizzaro reaction mechanism, which leads us to suggest the designation &#8220;aza&#8208;Cannizzaro reaction.&#8221; This discovery offers a new perspective on prebiotic nitrogen incorporation because glycine can be a source of nitrogen for more complex molecules, including other &#945;&#8208;amino acids</dc:description>

         <title>A Reusable Polystyrene Support for Sustainable yet Cost&#8208;Effective Octreotide Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of peptide drugs has become facile with the use of supports that enable easy separation of the growing peptide. Peptide synthesis on insoluble supports typically employs excess reagents to enhance reaction efficiency and faces challenges during intramolecular cyclization. A non&#8208;crosslinked soluble polystyrene support is reported herein that improves cyclization efficiency on the support by using spacers. The support efficiency is illustrated by synthesizing octreotide drug in a scalable manner by on&#8208;support cyclization. The methodology drastically reduces the reagent waste, raw&#8208;material cost, and solvent requirement. The support can also be recovered and re&#8208;used up to 3 times making this a very sustainable method.</dc:description>

         <title>Role of Solvent and Noncovalent Interactions in Alkaline Reactivity of Strained and Strain&#8208;Free Macrocyclic Disulfides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study employs ab initio&#160;molecular dynamics simulations to investigate&#160;
the impact of solvent and non&#8208;bonded interactions on the structure&#8208;reactivity relationship
of both strain&#8208;free and strained macrocyclic disulfides. Our findings reveal that interactions&#160;
with water as a solvent significantly influence the minimum energy geometry structures&#160;
of both conformers of the studied macrocycle.&#160;
In particular, our simulations identify short contacts, specifically S&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960;&#8208;aromatic interactions,&#160;
which suppress reactivity for the strained isomer by obstructing the reaction cone at the minimum free energy.
&#160;
Surprisingly, the
free energy barriers for the disulfide reaction with a simple nucleophile (OH&#8208;&#160;anion) remain very similar,&#160;
despite one conformer having a markedly more strained disulfide bond than the other.
Enhanced molecular dynamics simulations in explicit solution&#160;
elucidate this apparent contradiction by revealing different solvent exposures
of the two sulfur atoms in the macrocycles.</dc:description>

         <title>Microwave&#8208;Assisted One&#8208;Step Synthesis of Palladium&#8208;Encapsulated Covalent Organic Frameworks for Heterogeneous Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;encapsulated covalent organic framework (metal/COF) represents an emerging paradigm in heterogeneous catalysis. However, the time&#8208;intensive (usually 4 or more days) and tedious multi&#8208;step synthesis of metal/COFs remains a significant stumbling block for their broad application. To address this challenge, we introduce a facile microwave&#8208;assisted in situ metal encapsulation strategy to cooperatively combine COF formation and in situ palladium(II) encapsulation in one step. With this unprecedented approach, we synthesize a diverse range of palladium(II)&#8208;encapsulated COFs (termed Mw&#8208;Pd/COF) in the air within just an hour. Notably, this strategy is scalable for large&#8208;scale production (~0.5 g). Leveraging the high crystallinity, porosity, and structural stability, one representative Mw&#8208;Pd/COF exhibits remarkable activity, functional group tolerance, and recyclability for the Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling reaction at room temperature, surpassing most previously reported Pd(II)/COF catalysts with respect to catalytic performance, preparation time, and synthetic ease. This microwave&#8208;assisted in situ metal encapsulation strategy opens a facile and rapid avenue to construct metal/COF hybrids, which hold enormous potential in a multitude of applications including heterogeneous catalysis, sensing, and energy storage.</dc:description>

         <title>200 Years of The Haloform Reaction: Methods and Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Discovered in 1822, the haloform reaction is one of the oldest synthetic organic reactions. The haloform reaction enables the synthesis of carboxylic acids, esters or amides from methyl ketones. The reaction proceeds via exhaustive a&#8208;halogenation and then substitution by a nucleophile to liberate a haloform. The methyl group therefore behaves as a masked leaving group. The reaction methodology has undergone several important developments in the last 200 years, transitioning from a diagnostic test of methyl ketones to a synthetically useful tool for accessing complex esters and amides. The success of the general approach has been exhibited through the use of the reaction in the synthesis of many different complex molecules in fields ranging from natural product synthesis, pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, fragrants and flavouring. The reaction has not been extensively reviewed since 1934. Therefore, herein we provide details of the history and mechanism of the haloform reaction, as well as an overview of the developments in the methodology and a survey of examples, particularly in natural product synthesis, in which the haloform reaction has been used.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancing the Reactivity of an Aromatic cyclo&#8208;P5 Ligand via Electrophilic Activation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrophilic activation of the aromatic cyclo&#8208;P5 ligand in [Cp*Fe(h5&#8208;P5)] is demonstrated to drastically enhance its reactivity towards weak nucleophiles. Unprecedented functionalized, contracted as well as complexly aggregated polyphosphorus compounds are accessed utilizing [Cp*Fe(h5&#8208;P5Me)][OTf] (A), highlighting the great potential of this underexplored mode of reactivity. Addition of carbenes to A affords novel 1,2&#8208; or 1,1&#8208;difunctionalized cyclo&#8208;P5 complexes [Cp*Fe(h4&#8208;P5(1&#8208;L)(2&#8208;Me)][OTf] (L&#160;=&#160;IDipp (1), EtCAAC (2), IiPr (3b)) and [Cp*Fe(h4&#8208;P5(1&#8208;IiPr)(1&#8208;Me)][OTf] (3a). For the first time, the much smaller IMe4 leads to the contraction of the cyclo&#8208;P5 ligand and formation of [Cp*Fe(h4&#8208;P4(1&#8208;IMe)(4&#8208;Me)] (4). DFT calculations shed light on the delicate mechanism of this type of reaction, which is reinforced by the experimental identification of key intermediates. Even the comparably weak nucleophile IDippCH2 reacts with A to form [Cp*Fe(h4&#8208;P5(1&#8208;IDippCH2)(1/2&#8208;Me)][OTf] (6a/b), highlighting its explicitly more reactive nature. Moreover, exposure of A to IDippEH (E = N, P) leads to a unique aggregation reaction affording [{Cp*Fe}2{m2,h4:3:1&#8209;P10Me2(IDippN)}][OTf] (8) and [{Cp*Fe}2{m2,h4:1:1:1&#8209;P11Me2(IDipp)}][OTf] (9), respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>Modelling and Numerical Evaluation of Photovoltaic Parameters of a Highly Efficient Perovskite Solar Cell Based on Methylammonium Tin Iodide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Designing a high performance solar cell structure requires the understanding of material innovation, device engineering, charge behavior, operation characteristics and efficient photoconversion of light to generate electricity. This study offers a detailed numerical evaluation of the device physics in a highly efficient methylammonium&#8208;based perovskite solar cell (PSC) of the configuration, FTO/WO3/CH&#8323;NH&#8323;SnI&#8323;/GO/Fe. Utilizing the SCAPS&#8208;1D device simulator, an impressive open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.3184 V, short&#8208;circuit current density (Jsc) of 35.10 mA/cm&#178;, Fill factor (FF) of 78.38%, and power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 36.24% were achieved. The model cell exhibits a robust photon capture of 100% quantum efficiency between 360 and 750 nm.&#160; The study also presents temperature&#8208;dependent band alignment diagram which posted a built&#8208;in potential (Vbi) of 0.62 eV. The Vbi at 400 K was found to be 0.58 eV indicating that the model cell exhibits a decent temperature tolerance, and can retain approximately 93% of its power at 400 K. Through Mott&#8208;Schottky capacitance analysis, deeper insights into the space&#8208;charge region are inferred, while recombination&#8208;generation investigations emphasize the significance of electronic properties in optimizing device performance. This paper, therefore, lays the foundation for future studies, offering clear pathways for device optimization and identifying key areas that require further investigation.</dc:description>

         <title>CO2 Dynamics in a Flexible Metal&#8208;Organic Framework with Gate&#8208;Opening Phenomenon</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As a promising porous material for CO2&#160;adsorption and storage, elastic layer&#8208;structured metal&#8208;organic framework&#8208;11 (ELM&#8208;11) has attracted significant attention owing to its distinct gate&#8208;opening phenomenon. There is a sharp increase in CO2&#160;uptake once reaching the gate&#8208;opening threshold pressure. To better understand this gate&#8208;opening mechanism, we investigated its transition process from the perspective of CO2&#160;dynamics and its interaction with the framework via variable&#8208;temperature&#160;13C solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.&#160;Our findings revealed that during the gate&#8208;opening process, CO2&#160;is initially strongly adsorbed at one site when the gate only slightly opens,&#160;while two distinct types of CO2&#160;molecules exist when the gate fully opens.&#160;11B,&#160;13C, and&#160;19F magic&#8208;angle spinning NMR, in conjunction with in&#8208;situ XANES experiments, were also conducted to probe&#160;the location of adsorption sites.</dc:description>

         <title>Total Synthesis of Tosyl&#8208;Samroiyotmycin A and Its Biological Profiling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A total synthesis of the enantiopure syn,syn&#8208;tosyl&#8208;samroiyotmycin A, a C2&#8208;symmetric 20&#8208;membered antimalarial macrodiolide with syn,syn&#8208;configuration of the 8,24&#8208;dihydroxy&#8208;9,25&#8208;dimethyl units and it&#8217;s enantiopure anti,anti&#8208;derivative is described. The synthesis was accomplished utilizing a linear approach in 7 steps and 3 % overall yield via a sequence of diastereoselective methylation of SuperQuat oxazolidinone auxiliary, cross metathesis and Yamaguchi macrolactonization of fully functionalized seco&#8208;acids. By a similar approach we gained access to several samroiyotmycin analogues and precursors. Antimalarial activity was tested on multi&#8208;resistant (K1) and sensitive (Nf54) P. falciparum strains providing insight into structure activity relationships. Both tosyl&#8208;oxazol unit as well as the syn&#8208;configuration of the two contiguous stereogenic centers turned out to be beneficial for antiplasmodial activity. For instance, syn,syn&#8208;tosyl&#8208;samroiyotmycin A showed 3.4 times higher activities than the &#8220;tosyl&#8208;free&#8221; natural product.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoinduced On&#160;and Off&#160;Polymeric Room Temperature Phosphorescence Based On Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon Isomers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As family members of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, compound anthracene (Ant) and phenanthrene (Phe) as isomers are widely used in organic optical materials and electronic materials. But their photochemical and physical properties are very different. In this work, the room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) properties of PVA&#8208;B&#8208;Ant and PVA&#8208;B&#8208;Phe are discussed carefully which are prepared by B&#8208;O click reaction through polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) with 9&#8208;anthraceneboronic acid (B&#8208;Ant) and 9&#8208;phenanthrenylboronic acid (B&#8208;Phe), respectively. PVA&#8208;B&#8208;Phe 1%&#160;film exhibits excellent fluorescence (FL) emission at 374 nm and RTP emission at 523 nm with green afterglow and around 1.9 s phosphorescence lifetime. However, PVA&#8208;B&#8208;Ant 1% film only shows strong blue FL emission at 414 nm, and the emission intensity decreases seriously with the extension of irradiation time. Experimental and theoretical calculations results suggest that the photodimer of Ant which is formed in PVA matrix under the UV light irradiation would be competitive with the process of RTP emission. This work demonstrates&#160;that the RTP properties of organic molecules might be probably affected by the photostability of the organic phosphor under UV irradiation.</dc:description>

         <title>Electron Donor&#8208;Acceptor Complex&#8208;Assisted Photochemical Conversion of O&#8208;2&#8208;Nitrobenzyl Protected Hydroxamates to Amides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The hydroxamic acid functionality is present in various medicinal agents and has attracted special interest for synthetic transformations in both organic and medicinal chemistry. The N&#8208;O bond cleavage of hydroxamic acid derivatives provides an interesting transformation for the generation of various products. We demonstrate, herein, that O&#8208;benzyl&#8208;type protected hydroxamic acids may undergo photochemical N&#8211;O bond cleavage, in the presence or&#160;absence of a catalyst, leading to amides. Although some O&#8208;benzyl protected aromatic hydroxamates may be photochemically converted to amides in the presence of a base and anthracene as the catalyst, employing O&#8208;2&#8208;nitrobenzyl group allowed the smooth conversion of both aliphatic and aromatic hydroxamates to primary or secondary amides in good to excellent yields in the presence of an amine, bypassing the need of a catalyst. DFT and UV&#8208;Vis studies supported the effective generation of an electron donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complex between O&#8208;2&#8208;nitrobenzyl hydroxamates and amines, which enabled the successful product formation under these photochemical conditions. An extensive substrate scope was demonstrated, showcasing that both aliphatic or aromatic hydroxamates are compatible with this protocol, affording a wide variety of primary and secondary amides.</dc:description>

         <title>In Situ Built ZnS/MXene Heterostructure by a Mild Method for Inhibiting Polysulfide Shuttle in Li&#8208;S Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>With high specific surface area, excellent polysulfide conversion activity, and fast electron/ion transfer at the interface, MXene&#8208;derived heterostructures can be employed as catalysts for lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries to accelerate sulfur redox kinetics and suppress shuttle effect. However, the preparation of MXene&#8208;derived heterostructures often requires high&#8208;temperature reactions, which can easily lead to the oxidation of MXene and sacrifice the electrical conductivity. Herein, a catalytic two&#8208;dimensional heterostructure (ZnS/MXene) was successfully synthesized via a mild method. The MXene skeleton retains the original nanosheet structure without oxidation. The in situ&#8208;grown ZnS nanospheres prevent the restacking of MXene nanosheets, which not only increases the active sites, but also guarantees channels for the fast passage of lithium ions. The interfacial built&#8208;in electric field further promotes electron/ion migration, thereby expediting the polysulfide conversion and suppressing the shuttle effect. Consequently, the batteries using ZnS/MXene modified separators exhibit a high initial discharge capacity of 1230 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.1 C and a low decaying rate of 0.082% per cycle after 500 cycles at 0.5 C. This work offers a reference for the fabrication of MXene&#8208;based heterostructure in Li&#8208;S batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Twisted Amide&#8208;Mediated Peptide Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A robust, practical, and sustainable isomerization&#8208;suppressed peptide bond formation via acyl sulfonamide, a twisted amide, is disclosed. Tosyl isocyanate and pentafluorobenzyl bromide were applied in combination to activate the peptide C&#8208;terminus, which then reacted with an amine to yield an elongated peptide with high stereochemical purity. Careful analysis of NMR spectra of the active intermediate revealed the presence of an intramolecular hydrogen bond, suggesting that the hydrogen bond suppressed C&#945;&#8208;epimerization during amidation. The isomerization suppression by the intramolecular hydrogen bond is expected to be effective even under high dilution conditions, making the present method a powerful tool for the synthesis of complex macrocyclic peptides. In addition to peptide synthesis, the developed synthetic entry to twisted amides can be applied to the investigation of transition metal&#8208;catalyzed N&#8211;C bond activation. Moreover, the application to the N&#8211;C bond activation returned insight into peptide synthesis, leading to the use of sulfonamide as a protecting group of carboxylic acid that can be orthogonally removed in the presence of other conventional protecting groups.</dc:description>

         <title>Insoluble Acyclic Cucurbit[n]uril&#8208;Type Receptors Capture Iodine from the Vapor Phase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nuclear energy makes large contributions toward meeting global energy needs, but societal concerns remain high given the impacts of the intended release of radioactive materials including 129I and 131I. In this paper we explore the use of a homologous series of acyclic CB[n] type hosts (H1 &#8211; H4) as adsorbents of iodine from the vapor phase. We find that H2 &#8211; H4, but not H1 &#8211; perform well in this application with uptake capacities of 2.2 g g&#8208;1, 1.5&#160;g g&#8208;1, and 1.9&#160;g g&#8208;1, respectively. The chemisorptive uptake process involves partial oxidation of catechol walled H2 to quinone walled host and capture of I3&#8208; and I5&#8208;. Solid H2 can be regenerated by treatment with Na2S2O4 and reused at least five times. The x&#8208;ray crystal structure of H2 is also reported.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral Pd(II) Nanofiber Promoting Electron Transfer of g&#8208;C3N4 for Efficient Photocatalytic Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The rapid transfer and separation of photogenerated electrons is very important for the improvement of photocatalytic efficiency. Here, chiral induced spin selectivity effect (CISS effect) was developed to accelerate electron transfer for efficient photocatalytic hydrogen production. A chiral and achiral racemic supramolecular Pd(II) complex nanofiber was fabricated via supramolecular self&#8208;assembly of chiral L&#8208;Py or its racemes with Pd(II) and used to modify carbon nitride (g&#8208;C3N4). The obtained chiral photocatalyst L&#8208;Py&#8208;Pd/g&#8208;C3N4&#8208;4 and achiral photocatalyst Rac&#8208;Pd/g&#8208;C3N4&#8208;4, show enhanced photocatalytic activities with hydrogen evolution rates of 2476 and 1339 &#956;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, respectively, while that of pure g&#8208;C3N4 is 30.5 &#956;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1. Chiral photocatalyst has 85% higher activity than achiral one and is 82.5&#8208;fold of pure g&#8208;C3N4, due to better suppression of the recombination of photogenerated electron&#8208;hole pairs in the interface of g&#8208;C3N4 contact with chiral molecule. Spectral tests and photoelectrochemical tests proved that the chiral supramolecular Pd(II) complex can act both as an electron spin filter and hydrogen reduction catalytic center to enhance photocatalytic efficiency. This work offers a new route to facilitate electron transfer by the CISS effect for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution.</dc:description>

         <title>Development of low&#8208;toxicity antimicrobial polycarbonates bearing lysine residues</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Antibiotic resistance has been threatening public health for a long period, while the COVID pandemic aggravated the scenario. To combat antibiotic resistance strains, host defense peptides (HDPs) mimicking molecules have attracted considerable attention. Herein, we reported a series of polycarbonates bearing cationic lysine amino acid residues that could mimic the mechanism of action of HDPs and possess broad&#8208;spectrum antimicrobial activity. Moreover, those polymers had negligible toxicity toward red blood cells and mammalian cells. The membrane&#8208;disruption mechanism endows the lysine&#8208;containing polycarbonates with low possibility of resistance development and the fast killing kinetics, making them promising candidates for antimicrobial development.</dc:description>

         <title>The many facets of RuII(dppe)2 acetylide compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this contribution, we describe the various research domains in which RuII alkynyl derivatives are involved. Their peculiar molecular properties stem from a strong and intimate overlap between the metal centered d orbitals and the p system of the acetylide ligands, resulting in plethora of fascinating properties such as strong and tunable visible light absorption with a strong MLCT character&#160; essential for sensing, photovoltaics, light&#8208;harvesting applications or non&#8208;linear optical properties. Likewise, the d/p mixing results in tunable redox properties at low potential due to the raising of the HOMO level, and making those compounds particularly suited to achieve redox switching of various properties associated to the acetylide conjugated ligand, such as photochromism, luminescence or magnetism, for charge transport at the molecular level and in field effect transistor devices, or charge storage for memory devices. Altogether, we show in this review the potential of RuII acetylide compounds, insisting on the molecular design and suggesting further research developments for this class of organometallic dyes, including supramolecular chemistry.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The enantioselective synthesis of chiral compounds containing multiple stereogenic elements via a single catalytic step is a challenging process. In the presence of &#945;&#8208;chloronitrostyrenes and a chiral squaramide catalyst, C&#8211;C or C&#8211;N pro&#8208;axially chiral 2&#8208;naphthol substrates, featuring low barriers to enantiomerization, underwent a remote diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective domino Michael/O&#8208;alkylation. It provided the desired benzodihydrofurans bearing two stereogenic carbon atoms and a configurationally stable C&#8211;C or a C&#8211;N bond, thanks to a high increase of the barrier to rotation upon dihydrofurannulation.</dc:description>

         <title>Platinum&#8208;Centered Oligoynes Capped by Boron Difluoride Formazanate Dyes and Their Thin&#8208;Film Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Since the Nobel prize winning discovery that polyacetylene could act as a semiconductor, there has been tremendous efforts dedicated to understanding and harnessing the unusual properties of &#120587;&#8208;conjugated polymers. Much of this research has focused on the preparation of oligoynes and polyynes with well&#8208;defined numbers of repeating alkyne units as models for carbyne. These studies are usually hampered by a structure&#8208;property relationship where the stability of the resulting materials decrease with the incorporation of additional alkyne units. Here, we describe a series of oligoynes, with up to 12 alkyne units, where electron&#8208;rich [Pt(PBu3)2]2+ units are incorporated into the center of oligoyne backbones which are capped by electron&#8208;poor BF2 formazanate dyes. These compounds exhibit excellent stability and solubility, panchromatic absorption, and redox activity characteristic of their structural components. These traits facilitated thin&#8208;film studies of extended oligoyne materials, where it is shown that incorporating [Pt(PBu3)2]2+ units leads to smoother films, decreased conductivity on the microscale, and increased conductivity on the nanoscale when compared to metal&#8208;free analogs. Remarkably, our oligoynes have superior conductivity compared to the ubiquitous poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene) semiconductor.</dc:description>

         <title>Bifunctional Hexadentate Pyclen&#8208;based Chelating Agent for Mild Radiofluorination in Aqueous Solution at Room Temperature with a Ga&#8208;18F Ternary Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is used in oncology for tumor diagnosis, commonly relying on fluorine&#8208;18 (18F) emission detection. The conventional method of 18F incorporation on to probes by covalent bonding is harsh for sensitive biomolecules, which are nonetheless compounds of choice for the development of targeted probes. This study explores gallium&#8208;18F (Ga18F) coordination, a milder alternative method occurring in aqueous media at the final stage of radiosyntheses. Pyclen&#8208;based chelating agents were proposed to capture (GaF) species at room temperature and pH &#8805; 5 making the radiofluorination process compatible with heat&#8208; and acid&#8208;sensitive biomolecules. Highly promising results were obtained with the PC2A&#8208;based chelating agent LH2 derived from the new bifunctional PC2A&#8208;OAE&#8208;NCS compound. The solid&#8208;state structure of GaF(L) was elucidated by X&#8208;ray diffraction and revealed an unconventional heptacoordination of Ga(III). A high radiochemical conversion (RCC) of 86% was achieved at room temperature, in water at pH 5 within 20 minutes. Stability studies showed the robustness of the GaF(L) complex in aqueous media for at least one day and at least one hour for the radiolabeled analog Ga18F(L). These findings demonstrated that PC2A&#8208;based compounds are chelating agents of choice for (Ga18F) species, suggesting a real technological breakthrough for PET imaging and precision medicine.</dc:description>

This study explores gallium-18F (Ga18F) coordination, a milder alternative method occurring in aqueous media at the final stage of radiosyntheses. Pyclen-based chelating agents were proposed to capture (GaF) species at room temperature and pH &#8805; 5 making the radiofluorination process compatible with heat- and acid-sensitive biomolecules. Highly promising results were obtained with the PC2A-based chelating agent LH2 derived from the new bifunctional PC2A-OAE-NCS compound. The solid-state structure of GaF(L) was elucidated by X-ray diffraction and revealed an unconventional heptacoordination of Ga(III). A high radiochemical conversion (RCC) of 86% was achieved at room temperature, in water at pH 5 within 20 minutes. Stability studies showed the robustness of the GaF(L) complex in aqueous media for at least one day and at least one hour for the radiolabeled analog Ga18F(L). These findings demonstrated that PC2A-based compounds are chelating agents of choice for (Ga18F) species, suggesting a real technological breakthrough for PET imaging and precision medicine.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Detection of Guanine Quadruplexes by Raman Optical Activity and Quantum&#8208;Chemical Interpretation of the Spectra</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Quadruplexes formed by guanine derivatives or guanine&#8208;rich nucleic acids are involved in metabolism and genetic storage of many living organisms, they are used in DNA nanotechnologies or as biosensors. Since many quadruplex geometries are possible the determination of their structures in aqueous solutions is difficult. Raman optical activity (ROA) can make it easier: For guanosine monophosphate (GMP), we observed a distinct change of the spectra upon its condensation and quadruplex formation. The vibrational bands become more numerous, stronger, and narrower. In particular, a huge ROA signal appears below 200 cm&#8208;1. The aggregation can be induced by high concentration, low temperature, or by a metal ion. We focused on well&#8208;defined quadruplexes stabilized by potassium, where using molecular dynamics and density functional theory the spectra and particular features related to GMP geometric parameters could be understood. The simulations explain the main experimental trends and confirm that the ROA spectroscopy is sensitive to fine structural details, including guanine base twist in the quadruplex helix.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamic Luminescence Vapochromism of Pyridinium&#8208;Based Organic Salts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic vapochromic materials which undergo a drastic change in their photophysical properties upon exposure to vapors or gases are attracting growing scientific attention because of their low price and wide range of possible applications. In this work, luminescence vapochromism of carbazole&#8208;pyridinium&#8208;based organic salts with a general structure of (CzPy)X (CzPy+ = 2,3&#8208;di(9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)pyridinium ion; X = Cl, Br or I) is reported. It was found that (CzPy)X compounds form J&#8208;aggregates, which rearranged back to monomeric form upon exposure to methanol, ethanol, acetone, and water vapors. In contrast, acetonitrile was found to promote the J&#8208;aggregation in (CzPy)X compounds by occupying the voids in their crystal lattice and pushing cations closer together. It was further demonstrated that the efficiency of J&#8208;aggregation in (CzPy)X compounds depends on the size of the anion, which was employed to realize dynamic luminescence vapochromism, with vapochromic response times ranging from a couple of minutes in (CzPy)Cl to more than an hour in (CzPy)I. In addition, (CzPy)X compounds exhibited high melting points of about 250 &#176;C and excellent thermal stability. (CzPy)Cl and (CzPy)Br have also shown good photoluminescence quantum yields at room temperature in a solid state.</dc:description>

         <title>Comparative Study of PtM (M=Cu, Zn, Ga, Mn, Fe, In, Ce) Bimetals on Zincosilicate for Propane Dehydrogenation Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Silicoaluminate zeolites have relatively strong Br&#246;nsted (B) acid properties that can easily lead to deep cracking reactions, making them less favourable as carriers for propane dehydrogenation. Here, we utilise zincosilicate zeolite with less B&#8208;acid produced by the introduction of the heteroatom Zn into the framework as a carrier, followed by simultaneous ion exchange (IE) of M monometallic or PtM bimetallic (M = Cu, Zn and Ga, etc.). The optimized PtZn/Zn&#8208;4 exhibits a superior propane dehydrogenation performance over PtCu/Zn&#8208;4 and PtGa/Zn&#8208;4, which can achieve a propane conversion of about 30% in a pure propane atmosphere at 550 &#176;C and can be operated for at least 168 h without significant deactivation. Characterization techniques such as spherical aberration corrected transmission electron microscopy, in situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and in situ diffuse reflectance infrared fourier transform spectroscopy with different gas adsorptions are used to investigate these PtM@zeolite catalysts in order to deepen the understanding of acid site identification, promoter effect and catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Amination and hydrodefluorination of aryl fluorides promoted by solvated electrons.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cross&#8208;coupling reactions for constructing C&#8208;N bonds represent a pivotal advancement in chemical science. Traditional methodologies, including nucleophilic aromatic substitution (SNAr) and transition metal&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;couplings, have limitations concerning aryl scope, reliance on toxic and costly transition&#8208;metal catalysts, and issues related to atom economy and waste generation from ligands and additives. In this work, we introduce a novel method for aminating neutral, electron&#8208;rich, and electron&#8208;deficient aryl halides, eliminating the need for transition metals. Our approach involves the activation of aryl halides using solvated electrons generated from granulated lithium and sonication. This serves as a sustainable source of reducing power, facilitating the efficient formation of C&#8208;N bonds under near ambient conditions. Competitive selectivity studies between halide and ester functionalities were explored. Reaction scope and conducted mechanistic studies support the proposed radical&#8208;nucleophilic substitution (SRN1) mechanism for the reaction. Notably, the developed reaction has a highly competitive reductive dehalogenation pathway during the C&#8208;N coupling reaction, and this mechanistic divergency was thoroughly explored. This work not only broadens the scope of C&#8208;N coupling reactions which typically employs aryl bromides and iodides and rarely aryl fluorides which is also equally abundant, but also introduces a new way to do C&#8208;N coupling reactions using solvated electrons.</dc:description>

         <title>Nanocomposite Hydrogels from Nanodiamonds and a Self&#8208;Assembling Tripeptide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the successful assembly of a tripeptide in the presence of nanodiamonds (NDs) into nanocomposite hydrogels. The presence of NDs does not hinder peptide self&#8208;assembly and gelation, whilst improving the viscoelastic properties of the hydrogels. Gelation kinetics are not affected by NDs, while the elastic moduli of the peptide hydrogels are significantly increased by the NDs. Increased resistance of the gels against applied stress can also be attained depending on the amount of NDs loaded in the nanocomposite. Raman micro&#8208;spectroscopy and TEM confirmed the presence of NDs on the surface, and not in the interior, of peptide nanofibers. Peptide&#8208;ND non&#8208;covalent interactions are also probed by Raman and Fourier&#8208;transformed infrared spectroscopies. Overall, this work enables the embedding of NDs into nanocomposite hydrogels formed through the self&#8208;assembly of a simple tripeptide at physiological pH, and it provides key insights to open the way for their future applications in biomaterials, for instance exploiting their luminescence and near&#8208;infrared responsiveness.</dc:description>

Raman micro-spectroscopy and TEM confirmed the presence of NDs on the surface, and not in the interior, of peptide nanofibers. Peptide-ND non-covalent interactions are also probed by Raman and Fourier-transformed infrared spectroscopies. Overall, this work enables the embedding of NDs into nanocomposite hydrogels formed through the self-assembly of a simple tripeptide at physiological pH, and it provides key insights to open the way for their future applications in biomaterials, for instance exploiting their luminescence and near-infrared responsiveness.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Aromaticity in Isoelectronic Analogues of Benzene, Carborazine and Borazine, from Electronic Structure and Magnetic Property</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carborazine (B2C2N2H6) and borazine (B3N3H6) are isoelectronic analogues of benzene (C6H6). The aromatic character of borazine have basically reached a consensus after a long period of controversy, but the related properties of carborazine are even rarely reported. In this work, we systematically investigated the geometric structure, charge distribution, frontier molecular orbital characteristics, bonding, electronic delocalization, magnetic shielding effect, and induced ring current of carborazine and borazine, and compared the studied characteristics with those of benzene to determine the aromatic character of the two analogues. The combination of multiple properties shows that although they are isoelectronic, carborazine is evidently aromatic, while borazine only exhibits rather weak aromaticity. The C atom acting as a connecting bridge between B and N atoms in carborazine reduces the electronegativity difference on the molecular backbone and enhances the electronic delocalization over the conjugated path, which is the essence of the distinct disparity of aromaticity between carborazine and borazine.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted reduction of nitrobenzenes using formate salts as the reductant was developed. A wide range of nitrobenzenes can be converted into aniline products in a transition metal free fashion. Mechanistic studies revealed that radical species (carbon dioxide radical anion and thiol radical) are key intermediates for the transformation. We anticipate that this method will provide a valuable and green strategy for the reduction of nitrobenzenes.</dc:description>

         <title>Gene Editing with Artificial DNA Scissors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Artificial metallonucleases (AMNs) are small molecule DNA cleavage agents, also known as molecular scissors, and represent an important class of chemotherapeutic agent. This review introduces concepts core to this area such as DNA structure, AMN design, and cleavage mechanisms. We also describe hybrid molecules where AMNs are covalently attached to directing groups that provide sequence specific DNA damaging capabilities.







Abstract
Artificial metallo&#8208;nucleases (AMNs) are small molecule DNA cleavage agents, also known as DNA molecular scissors, and represent an important class of chemotherapeutic with high clinical potential. This review provides a primary level of exploration on the concepts key to this area including an introduction to DNA structure, function, recognition, along with damage and repair mechanisms. Building on this foundation, we describe hybrid molecules where AMNs are covalently attached to directing groups that provide molecular scissors with enhanced or sequence specific DNA damaging capabilities. As this research field continues to evolve, understanding the applications of AMNs along with synthetic conjugation strategies can provide the basis for future innovations, particularly for designing new artificial gene editing systems.

         <title>Applications of Electrophotocatalysis in C&#8722;H Functionalization of Organic Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemistry and photochemistry join forces in the booming field of electrophotocatalysis. Electrophotocatalytic activation is suitable to engage even previously inaccessible compounds in C&#8722;H functionalization reactions. Herin we provide an overview of recent developments in this field.







Abstract
Electrophotocatalysis (EPC) has evolved as a new scientific discipline around the boundary of highly active fields: electrochemistry and photocatalysis. EPC allows us to combine the energy of light and electric potential to activate previously inaccessible compounds via single&#8208;electron transfer (SET). Herein, we review the most essential applications of EPC to the C&#8722;H functionalization of molecules. This work discusses mechanisms that can be encountered when designing such processes and analyzes technical aspects of performing EPC reactions in the laboratory.

         <title>A Cycloparaphenylene Acetylene as Potential Precursor for an Armchair Carbon Nanotube</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The bottom&#8208;up synthesis of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) is a long&#8208;standing goal in synthetic chemists. Producing CNTs with defined lengths and diameters would render these materials and thus their fascinating properties accessible in a controlled way. Inspired by a recently reported synthesis of armchair graphene sheets that relied on a benzannulation and Scholl oxidation of a poly(p&#8208;phenylene ethynylene), the same strategy is applied on a cyclic substrate with a short, but well defined CNT as target structure. Herein we report the synthesis of a derivatized [12]cyclo&#173;para&#173;phenylene acetylene ([12]CPPA) that was accessible employing a Sonogashira macro&#173;cyclization. The obtained macrocycle is the largest [n]CPPA reported to date and displays bright turquoise fluorescence with a large quantum yield of 77%. The [12]CPPA can be transformed by a 12&#8208;fold benzannulation that converts each alkyne to a naphthalene and therefore allows formation of an armchair [12,12] CNT precursor. The final 72&#8208;fold Scholl oxidation to the [12,12] CNT turned out to be challenging and its optimization requires an improved synthetic strategy to produce large quantities of the final precursor. The developed approach poses a potential break through strategy for the production of CNTs and certainly incentivizes synthetic chemists to apply the same methodology for various conjugated macrocycles.</dc:description>

         <title>Toward Molecular Textiles: Synthesis and Characterization of Molecular Patches</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This works describes a new step into the assembly of molecular textiles by the use of covalent templating. To establish a well&#8208;founded base and to tackle pre&#8208;mature obstacles, expected during the fabrication of the desired 2D&#8208;material, we opted to investigate the in&#8208;solution synthesis of molecular patches e.g. cut&#8208;outs of a textile. A bi&#8208;functional cross&#8208;shaped monomer was designed, synthesized and was in&#8208;detail characterized by means of 1H&#8208;NMR and chiro&#8208;optical spectroscopy. In addition, x&#8208;ray structure crystallography was used to assess the absolute configuration. The monomer was used in an in&#8208;solution oligomerization to assemble the molecular patches via imine condensation, which revealed the formation of predominately dimeric patches. &#160;The imine&#8208;oligomer mixtures were further analyzed by reduction and cleaved to investigate the conditions required post mono&#8208;layer assembly. All reaction stages were followed by FT&#8208;IR and 1H&#8208;NMR analysis. Finally, we address the adsorption of the cross&#8208;shaped monomer onto a Au(111) surface, via high vacuum electrospray deposition. The subsequent annealing of the interface induced the on&#8208;surface imine condensation reaction, leading to unidimensional oligomers co&#8208;adsorbed with clusters of cyclic&#8208;dimers. Nc&#8208;AFM analysis revealed the tridimensional molecular structures, and together with electrospray deposition technique showed to be a promising pathway to investigate potential monomer candidates.</dc:description>

         <title>Ca/Li Synergetic&#8208;Doped Na0.67Ni0.33Mn0.67O2 to Realize P2&#8208;O2 Phase Transition Suppression for High&#8208;Performance Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>P2&#8208;type layered transition metal oxide Na0.67Ni0.33Mn0.67O2 is considered as a promising cathode for advanced sodium&#8208;ion batteries due to its high theoretical specific capacity. However, the P2&#8208;type cathode suffers severe P2&#8208;O2 phase transition during cycling process, resulting unsatisfactory cyclic stability and rate capability. Herein, a Ca/Li co&#8208;doped P2&#8208;type Na0.62Ca0.05Ni0.33Mn0.57Li0.10O2 (NCNMLO) cathode material was synthesized through a simple sol&#8208;gel method. With the synergistic effect of Ca&#8208;doping at Na sites and Li substitution at transition metal (TM) sites, the cathode achieves an excellent electrochemical performance due to the inhibited P2&#8208;O2 phase transition and improved ion diffusion with Na+/vacancy disordering arrangement. The NCNMLO cathode exhibits a good cyclic stability with 70.8% of capacity retention at 1 C after 200 cycles and excellent rate capability with 40.1 mAh g&#8722;1 at 20 C. The dual sites doping strategy provides an effective and simple approach for designing high&#8208;performance layered oxide cathode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Liquid Crystalline Tetraphenylethylene&#8208;Surfactant Complex with Chiral Supramolecular Structure and Tunable Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A room&#8208;temperature liquid crystal with a helical structure and tunable CPL was fabricated by a synergistic strategy of ionic self&#8208;assembly and chiral solvation. This material exhibits aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) properties and a helical structure without inherent chirality. Chiral solvation imparts TPE&#8208;DHAB with a preferred handedness, enabling tunable circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) when using a chiral solvent.







Abstract
A novel room&#8208;temperature liquid crystal of tetraphenylethylene derivative (TPE&#8208;DHAB) was synthesized using an ionic self&#8208;assembly strategy. The TPE&#8208;DHAB complex exhibits typical aggregation&#8208;induced emission properties and a unique helical supramolecular structure. Moreover, the generation and handedness inversion of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) can be achieved through further chiral solvation, providing a facile approach to fabricate room&#8208;temperature liquid crystalline materials with controllable supramolecular structures and tunable CPL properties through a synergistic strategy of ionic self&#8208;assembly and chiral solvation process.

         <title>Inhibition of Lysosomal Cathepsin A and Neuraminidase 1 Interaction by Anti&#8208;Obesity Cyclic Peptide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stylissatin A and its analogs are shown to inhibit the interaction between mature protective protein cathepsin A and neuraminidase 1 in lysosomes, which caused irregular proteolysis of perilipin 1 around lipid droplets and inhibited fat accumulation in adipocytes. This PPI&#8208;modulating effect is promising to develop anti&#8208;inflammatory and anti&#8208;obesity drug leads.







Abstract
Chronic inflammation in adipose tissue is associated with metabolic disorders such as obesity and type 2 diabetes. Novel small molecules targeting adipocyte differentiation and fat accumulation offer potential for new anti&#8208;inflammatory and anti&#8208;obesity drugs. Here we show that the marine cyclic heptapeptide stylissatin A and its analogs (SAs) inhibit membranous neuraminidase 1 (Neu1) function by interacting with lysosomal protective protein cathepsin A (PPCA). Neu1 has been less explored as a therapeutic target due to the genetic defects leading to neurodegenerative disorders. However, unlike traditional neuraminidase inhibitors, SAs don't directly bind to Neu1 but modulate the molecular chaperone activity of PPCA. SAs caused degradation of perilipin 1 around lipid droplets and inhibited fat accumulation, along with decrease in membranous Neu1. Molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations revealed that SAs interacted with activated PPCA at the Neu1 binding site. Focusing on this newfound protein&#8211;protein interaction inhibition mechanism could lead to the development of pharmaceuticals with fewer side effects.

         <title>Stereo&#8208;Active Lone Pairs Induced Second Harmonic Generation Responses and Electrocatalytic Activity in Hybrid Material</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel Ge&#8208;based multifunctional hybrid material, (MeHDabco)2[GeBr3]4&#8901;H2O was successfully synthesized. Both theoretical analysis and experimental data have confirmed the crucial role of the 4s lone pair electrons of the Ge atom in inducing SHG response and electrocatalytic activity.







Abstract
The lone pair electrons in the electronic structure of molecules have been a prominent research focus in chemistry for more than a century. Stable s2 lone pair electrons significantly influence material properties, including thermoelectric properties, nonlinear optical properties, ferroelectricity, and electro(photo)catalysis. While major advances have been achieved in understanding the influence of lone pair electrons on material characteristics, research on this effect in organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid materials is in its initial stage. In this work, we successfully obtained a novel organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid multifunctional material incorporating Ge with 4s2 lone pair electrons, (MeHDabco)2[GeBr3]4&#8208;H2O (MeHDabco=N&#8208;methyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane) (1). Driven by the stereochemically active lone pair electrons on the Ge2+, 1 crystallizes in the noncentrosymmetric space group P21 at room temperature and exhibits good second harmonic generation (SHG) responses. Interestingly, 1 also shows electrocatalytic activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) due to the existence of lone pair electrons on Ge2+ cations. The electrochemical experiment combined with the density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the lone pair electrons act as both an active site for proton adsorption and facilitate the ionization of water. This work not only emphasizes the important role of lone pair electrons in material properties and functions but also provides new insight for designing novel Ge&#8208;based multifunctional hybrid materials.

         <title>Structure&#8208;Activity Relationship of Fluorinated Benzenesulfonamides as Inhibitors of Amyloid&#8208;&#946; Aggregation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of fluorinated benzenesulfonamides were synthesized and characterized by their anti&#8208;amyloid potential. We investigated compound structure relationship for inhibiting amyloid&#8208;beta (A&#946;) aggregation, which is considered to be the onset of Alzheimer's disease. The synthesized molecules were effective at slowing down the A&#946; aggregation by extending its nucleation phase and reduced aggregate toxicity to SHSY&#8208;5Y cells.







Abstract
Amyloid&#8208;beta aggregation is considered one of the factors influencing the onset of the Alzheimer's disease. Early prevention of such aggregation should alleviate disease condition by applying small molecule compounds that shift the aggregation equilibrium toward the soluble form of the peptide or slow down the process. We have discovered that fluorinated benzenesulfonamides of particular structure slowed the amyloid&#8208;beta peptide aggregation process by more than three&#8208;fold. We synthesized a series of ortho&#8208;para and meta&#8208;para double&#8208;substituted fluorinated benzenesulfonamides that inhibited the aggregation process to a variable extent yielding a detailed picture of the structure&#8208;activity relationship. Analysis of compound chemical structure effect on aggregation in artificial cerebrospinal fluid showed the necessity to arrange the benzenesulfonamide, hydrophobic substituent, and benzoic acid in a particular way. The amyloid beta peptide aggregate fibril structures varied in cross&#8208;sectional height depending on the applied inhibitor indicating the formation of a complex with the compound. Application of selected inhibitors increased the survivability of cells affected by the amyloid beta peptide. Such compounds may be developed as drugs against Alzheimer's disease.

         <title>Structural Deformations in Cucurbit[n]urils: Analysis, Host&#8208;Guest Dependence, and Automated Ellipticity Measurements Using ElliptiCB[n]</title>

We report development and use of ElliptiCB[n], which provides automated measurements of cucurbituril ellipticities. We also include a detailed analysis of all prior crystallographically characterized CB[5,6,7,8,10] hosts







Abstract
Cucurbit[n]urils (CB[n]s) are cyclic macrocycles with rich host&#8208;guest chemistry. In many cases, guest binding in CB[n]s results in host structural deformations. Unfortunately, measuring such deformations remains a major challenge, with only a handful of manual estimations reported in the literature. To address this challenge, we have developed the public program ElliptiCB[n], which is available on GitHub, that provides a robust and automated method for measuring the elliptical deformations in CB[n] hosts. We outline the development and validation of this approach, apply ElliptiCB[n] to measure the ellipticity of the 1113 available CB[n] structures from the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD), and directly investigate the structural deformations of CB[5], CB[6], CB[7], CB[8], and CB[10] hosts. We also report the general landscape of accessible CB[n] elliptical deformations and compare ellipticity distributions across CB[n] hosts and host&#8208;guest complexes. We found that in almost all cases guest binding significantly impacts the distribution of host ellipticity distributions and that these distributions are dissimilar across host&#8208;guest complexes of differently sized CB[n]s. We anticipate that this work will provide a useful approach for understanding of the flexibility of CB[n] hosts and will also enable future measurement and standardization of ellipticity measurements of CB[n]s.

         <title>N&#8208;Halosuccinimide&#8208;CeCl3 Transient Charge&#8208;Transfer Complexes as Semi Heterogeneous Photocatalyst in Cyclization of N&#8208;Propargylamides</title>

In this work, photoinert anhydrous cerium(III) chloride formed a transient charge&#8208;transfer complex with NXS (X=Br, I) in acetonitrile, acting as a semi&#8208;heterogeneous photocatalyst. This facilitated Ce(III) ion light absorption, creating halide radicals that converted N&#8208;propargylamides to oxazole aldehydes. Experiments confirmed a single electron transfer pathway. The CeCl3 was reusable with minimal decomposition.







Abstract
In this work, we used photoinert anhydrous cerium(III) chloride, to form a transient charge&#8208;transfer (CT) complex with NXS (N&#8208;bromosuccinimide or NBS and N&#8208;iodosuccinimide or NIS) in acetonitrile. These transient CT complexes acted as a semi&#8208;heterogeneous photocatalyst. These complexes allowed the Ce(III) ions to absorb light, turning them into strong electron donors that transferred electrons to NXS. This created halide radicals from NXS radical anions, helping to turn N&#8208;propargylamides into oxazole aldehydes. Experiments with DMPO and spin&#8208;trapping showed that a radical&#8208;based mechanism followed a single electron transfer (SET) pathway. Notably, CeCl3 was reused after the reaction without much decomposition, as it was regenerated and separated through simple filtration.

         <title>Magnetic Chitosan/ZrO2 Composites for Vanadium(V) Adsorption while Concurrently being Transformed to a Dual Functional Catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A magnetic chitosan/ZrO2 composite material (MZT) adsorbent for V(V) adsorption. The spent MZT as a catalyst was used to synthesize 2&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1H&#8208;benzo[d]imidazole and enhanced natural photocatalytic degradation Rhodamine B. The study proposes a resourceful, effective method for repurposing waste via natural photocatalytic reactions leveraging clean energy, potentially contributing to environmental preservation and presenting innovative avenues for spent adsorbent recovery.







Abstract
Spent adsorbents for recycling as catalysts have drawn considerable attention due to their environmentally benign chemistry properties. However, traditional thermocatalytic strategies limit their applications. Here, we developed an enhanced photocatalytic strategy to expand the range of their applications. A magnetic chitosan/ZrO2 composites (MZT) for V(V) adsorption, which were prepared using chitosan, ZrO2 and Fe3O4 by one&#8208;pot synthesis. The spent MZT as a catalyst was used to synthesize 2&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1H&#8208;benzo[d]imidazole, yielding up to 89.7&#8201;%. It also was implemented to photocatalysis reactions for recycle. The discolored rates of rhodamine B (RhB) were 72.3&#8201;% and 97.4&#8201;% by new and spent MZT, respectively. The new and spent MZT showed the forbidden bands were 251&#8197;nm and 561&#8197;nm, respectively. The result displayed spent MZT red shifted to the cyan light region. The mechanism of catalysis also has been studied in detail.

         <title>Synthesis, Characterization and Photophysical Properties of a New Family of Rare&#8208;Earth Cluster&#8208;Based Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The graphic depicts RE&#8208;CU&#8208;45, a rare&#8208;earth metal&#8208;organic framework, which features 1,3,5&#8208;benzenetricarboxylic acid linkers and hexanuclear RE(III) clusters (RE(III)=Eu(III), Gd(III), Tb(III), Dy(III), Ho(III), Er(III), Tm(III), Yb(III), Lu(III), and Y(III)). The MOF linker can be excited at 290&#8197;nm and, through the antenna effect, promote energy transfer to the RE(III) ions, leading to emission in the visible and/or near&#8208;infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum.







Abstract
In this work, nine new rare&#8208;earth metal&#8211;organic frameworks (RE&#8208;MOFs, where RE=Lu(III), Yb(III), Tm(III), Er(III), Ho(III), Dy(III), Tb(III), Gd(III), and Eu(III)) isostructural to Zr&#8208;MOF&#8208;808 are synthesized, characterized, and studied regarding their photophysical properties. Materials with high crystallinity and surface area are obtained from a reproducible synthetic procedure that involves the use of two fluorinated modulators. At the same time, these new RE&#8208;MOFs display tunable photoluminescent properties due to efficient linker&#8208;to&#8208;metal energy transfer promoted by the antenna effect, resulting in a series of RE&#8208;MOFs displaying lanthanoid&#8208;based emissions spanning the visible and near&#8208;infrared regions of the electromagnetic spectrum.

         <title>Boosting the Efficiency of Red Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence via Conjugation Enhancement in Push&#8208;Pull Naphthalimide Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, we synthesize new push&#8211;pull compounds characterized by naphthalimide as electron acceptor and by different electron donors such as tetraphenylethylene, triphenylamine and phenothiazine. Our time&#8211;resolved spectroscopic results show that TADF is occurring in the yellow and orange&#8211;red ranges of the visible. Fluorescence quantum yields are surprisingly large, triggered by the conjugation enhancement achieved through the synthetic effort.







Abstract
In this work, we synthesize a series of push&#8211;pull compounds bearing naphthalimide as the electron acceptor and tetraphenylethylene (TPE)/triphenylamine (TPA)/phenothiazine (PTZ) as the electron rich/electron donor units. These moieties are arranged in highly conjugated quadrupolar structures. The structure&#8211;property relationships are investigated through a joint experimental time&#8211;resolved spectroscopic and computational TD&#8211;DFT study. The femtosecond transient absorption and fluorescence up&#8211;conversion experiments reveal ultrafast photoinduced intramolecular charge transfer. This is likely the key factor leading to efficient spin&#8211;orbit CT&#8211;induced intersystem crossing for the TPA&#8211; and PTZ&#8211;derivatives as well as to small singlet&#8211;to&#8211;triplet energy gap. Consequently, evidence for a delayed fluorescence component is found together with the main prompt emission in the fluorescence kinetics both in solution and in thin film. The weight of the Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence (TADF) is greatly enhanced when these fluorophores are used as guests in solid&#8211;state host matrices. TADF is interestingly revealed in the orange&#8211;red region of the visible. Such long wavelength emission is here observed with surprisingly large fluorescence quantum yields, thanks to the conjugation enhancement achieved in these newly synthesized structures relative to previous studies. Our findings may be thus promising for the future development of efficient third generation TADF&#8211;based OLEDs.

Our findings may be thus promising for the future development of efficient third generation TADF&#8211;based OLEDs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mechanochemical Diversity in Block Copolymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structural parameters are known to govern covalent polymer mechanochemistry, but the complexity increases when chemically different chains are linked by covalent bonds, as in block copolymers (BCPs). This review highlights studies trying to define structure&#8208;activity relationship in the mechanochemistry of BCPs in various states, with an emphasis on the influence of their morphologies.







Abstract
Covalent polymer chains are known to undergo mechanochemical events when subjected to mechanical forces. Such force&#8208;coupled reactions, like C&#8722;C bond scission in homopolymers, typically occur in a non&#8208;selective manner but with a higher probability at the mid&#8208;chain. In contrast, block copolymers (BCPs), composed of two or more chemically distinct chains linked by covalent bonds, have recently been shown to exhibit significantly different mechanochemical reactivities and selectivities. These differences may be attributable to the atypical conformations adopted by their chains, compared to the regular random coil. Beyond individual molecules, when BCPs self&#8208;assemble into ordered aggregates in solution, the non&#8208;covalent interactions between the chains lead to meaningful acceleration in the activation of embedded force&#8208;sensitive motifs. Furthermore, the microphase segregation of BCPs in bulk creates periodically dispersed polydomains, locking the blocks in specific conformations which have also been shown to affect their mechanochemical reactivity, with different morphologies influencing reactivity to varying extents. This review summarizes the studies of mechanochemistry in BCPs over the past two decades, from the molecular level to assemblies, and up to bulk materials.

A mild and facile visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted multi&#8208;component nitrooxylation reaction of &#945;&#8208;diazoesters, cyclic ethers, and tert&#8208;butyl nitrite leading to organic nitrate esters has been developed at room temperature in air. This multi&#8208;component reaction proceeds smoothly to afford the corresponding organic nitrate esters in moderate to good yields using air the green oxidant.







Abstract
A simple and efficient strategy has been developed for the synthesis of organic nitrate esters via visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced multi&#8208;component nitrooxylation reactions of &#945;&#8208;diazoesters, cyclic ethers, and tert&#8208;butyl nitrite under open air atmosphere. This transformation could be conducted under mild and metal&#8208;free conditions to provide a number of organic nitrate esters in moderate to good yields using air as the green oxidant.

(&#947;,&#947;&#8217;,&#947;&#8217;&#8217;&#8208;Trifluoro)neopentyl (TFNP) aryl ethers are prepared as a new motif from tosylate 3. The motif has a preferred &#8216;propellar&#8217; conformation which can adopt left or right handed twists. LogP's are lower than tert&#8208;butyl analogues. Interactions between TFNP groups in the solid state are shown to also anchor supramolecular architectures.







Abstract
A route is developed to (&#947;,&#947;&#8217;,&#947;&#8217;&#8217;&#8217;&#8208;trifluoro)neopentyl (TFNP) aryl ethers to extend the methods for the introduction of the tert&#8208;butyl group, carrying a fluorine on each of the methyl substituents. The route combines neopentyltosylate 3 with phenols and thiophenols to give efficient substitution reactions to the corresponding TFNP aryl ethers. The three C&#8722;F bonds adopt a helical propeller conformation as revealed by computation and single crystal X&#8208;ray structure analysis. The LogPs of TFNP ethers are lower (more hydrophilic) than their neopentyl analogues. The metabolism of selected TFNP ethers was explored in the fungus Cunninghamella elegans.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Mediated Synthesis of N&#8208;Aryl&#8208;Oxamic Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Cu&#8208;catalyzed Ullmann&#8208;Goldberg cross&#8208;coupling of aryl iodides and oxamates yields N&#8208;aryloxamates in moderate to excellent yields, especially when oxamates bear bulky tertiary alkyl groups. These oxamates are hydrolyzed to oxamic acids, then converted into urethanes using PIDA or a visible&#8208;light Fe&#8208;LMCT process.







Abstract
The Cu&#8208;catalyzed Ullmann&#8208;Goldberg cross&#8208;coupling between aryl iodides and oxamates is shown to afford the corresponding N&#8208;aryloxamates with yields ranging from moderate to excellent, when the oxamate precursor incorporates a bulky tertiary alkyl group effectively preventing product degradation under the strongly basic reaction conditions. The final oxamic acids are then generated through the acid hydrolysis of the oxamate in high yields. These acids were then converted into urethanes using PIDA under thermal conditions or a visible&#8208;light Fe&#8208;LMCT process. While electron&#8208;deficient N&#8208;aryl oxamic acids provide urethanes with high efficiencies, electron&#8208;rich counterparts led to diminished yields due to aryl group over&#8208;oxidation induced by PIDA.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of Chemically Programmed Amphiphiles into Aqueous Nanotubes with a Lipophilic Lumen</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel nanotubes of ca. 4&#8197;nm in diameter self&#8208;assembled in water from custom&#8208;tailored amphiphiles are able to selectively encapsulate apolar molecules within their lipophilic lumen.







Abstract
The creation of complex hollow nanostructures with precise control over size and shape represents a great challenge in supramolecular soft materials. Here, we have further developed a bioinspired methodology for the formation of aqueous nanotubes of well&#8208;defined dimensions and pore coating through the self&#8208;assembly of amphiphiles that are chemically programmed with complementary nucleobases. These nanotubes are endowed with a hydrophobic lumen, whose diameter can be expanded as a function of the monomer length, in which apolar dyes can be efficiently encapsulated.

         <title>The Journey for the Synthesis of Large Acenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Since the synthesis of heptacene in 2006, the race to obtain and study the properties of largest acenes resulted in the development of innovative synthetic strategies, from solid&#8208;state chemistry to on&#8208;surface chemistry. This review presents the different methodologies employed for the synthesis of large acenes, up to tridecacene, highlighting the newest studies.







Abstract
Acenes, the group of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with linearly fused benzene rings, possess distinctive electronic properties with potential applicability in material science. Hexacene was the largest acene obtained and characterized in the last century, followed by heptacene in 2006. Since then, a race for obtaining the largest acene resulted in the development of several members of this family as well as diverse innovative synthetic strategies, from solid&#8208;state chemistry to the promising on&#8208;surface chemistry. This last technique allows the obtention of large acenes, up to tridecacene, the largest acene so far. This review presents the different methodologies employed for the synthesis of acenes, highlighting the newest studies, to provide a much more thorough understanding of the essence of the electronic structure of this captivating group of organic compounds.

         <title>Tetrel Bond Affects the Self&#8208;Assembly of Acetylcholine and its Analogues and is an Ancillary Interaction in Protein Binding</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Experimental and theoretical findings show that the C atoms of the &#8722;N+(CH3)3 moiety of acetylcholine and some analogues form tetrel bonds that are robust enough to assemble cations into supramolecular infinite chains; similar tetrel bonds are present also in substrate/protein adducts, specifically they act as ancillary interactions in the binding of these &#8722;N+(CH3)3 containing compounds to proteins.







Abstract
The &#8722;N+(CH3)3 residue is present in acetylcholine (ACh) and in many of its analogues which are used as selective ACh agonist or antagonists for human therapy. The X&#8208;ray structures of four ACh derivatives show the presence of short and linear contacts between the C atoms of &#8722;N+(CH3)3 groups and lone pair possessing atoms. These contacts can be rationalized as tetrel bonds (TtBs) thanks to their geometric features. Interrogation of the Protein Data Bank suggests that similar &#8722;N+&#8722;C&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;nucleophile contacts affect the details of the binding of ACh and its derivatives to proteins. Quantum theory of atoms in molecules, noncovalent interaction plot, and natural bond orbital analyses consistently confirm that the &#8722;N+&#8722;C&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;nucleophile contacts observed in small molecule crystals and in substrate/protein complexes are attractive in nature and can be rationalized as TtBs. TtBs involving methyl groups of the &#8722;N+(CH3)3 moiety can be proposed as a new item in the palette of interactions allowing the compounds containing this pharmacophoric unit to bind to their target protein and/or to express their biological/pharmacological properties.

         <title>Synthesis and Development of Inverse&#8208;Type Nucleoside Diarylethene Photoswitches</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The core structure of nucleosidic diarylethenes was modified in three different ways by varying the connection between nucleoside and thiophene subunit with the aim of shifting the absorption wavelength of open (&#955;max,UV) and closed forms (&#955;max,Vis). A 5&#8208;uridine&#8208;2&#8208;thiophene connection (semi&#8208;inverse thiophenes) resulted in a red shift of &#955;max,UV and blue shift of &#955;max,Vis. Resulting switches showed remarkable reversibility and fatigue resistance.







Abstract
Nucleosidic diarylethenes (DAEs) have evolved from an emerging class of photochromes into a well&#8208;established option for integrating photochromic functionalities into biological systems. However, a comprehensive understanding of how chemical structure influences their photochromic properties remains essential. While structural features, such as an inverse connection between the aryl residues and the ethene bridge, are well&#8208;documented for classical DAEs, their application to nucleosidic DAEs has been underexplored. In this study, we address this gap by developing three distinct types of inverse nucleosidic DAEs&#8211;semi&#8208;inverse thiophenes, semi&#8208;inverse uridines and inverse uridines. We successfully synthesized these compounds and conducted comprehensive analyses of their photostationary states, thermal stability, reversibility, and reaction quantum yields. Additionally, we conducted an in&#8208;depth comparison of their photochromic properties with those of their normal&#8208;type counterparts. Among the synthesized compounds, seven semi&#8208;inverse thiophenes exhibited the most promising characteristics. Notably, these compounds demonstrated excellent fatigue resistance, with up to 96&#8201;% retention of photochromic activity over 40 switching cycles, surpassing the performance of all comparable nucleosidic DAEs reported to date. These findings hold significant promise for future applications in various fields.

It turned out that the construction of functional Lewis acidic sites based on neutral bismuthanes requires substituents with a high ionic character and electronegativity, and at the same time they should not contain atoms in &#945;&#8208;position or lone pairs that are capable of undergoing effective negative hyperconjugation.







Abstract
Aiming at intramolecular frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) based on soft Lewis acidic bismuth centers, a phosphine function was combined with a dichloridobismuthane unit on a phenylene backbone utilizing a scrambling approach. The reaction between two equivalents of BiCl3 and (o&#8208;(Ph2P)C6H4)3Bi yielded (o&#8208;(Ph2P)C6H4)BiCl2(THF), the structure of which indicated Bi&#8230;P interactions and thus a pronounced Lewis acidity at the bismuth center that was confirmed by the Gutmann&#8208;Beckett method. However, the system turned out to be insufficient to be utilized for FLP reactivity. Hence, the chloride ligands were exchanged by iodide and C2F5 substituents, respectively. Despite a lower electronegativity the iodide compound exhibits a shorter Bi&#8230;P contact, while the C2F5 substituents led to a further decrease of the Lewis acidity, despite their high group electronegativity. DFT calculations rationalized this by a quenching of the Lewis acidity inherent to the &#963;*(Bi&#8722;C) orbital by negative hyperconjugation from occupied p&#8208;orbitals at the F atoms. Furthermore, it turned out that the strength of the covalent Bi&#8722;X &#963;&#8208;bond is a more important factor than the charge at Bi in determining the energetic accessibility and thus Lewis acidity of the antibonding &#963;*(Bi&#8722;C) orbital.

         <title>Why Are Some Pnictogen(III) Pincer Complexes Planar and Others Pyramidal?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple model to explain the preferred geometry for tricoordinate pnictogen pincer complexes is proposed based on competing &#960; and &#963; effects to make sense of the variable structures reported in the literature. This model is supported by density functional theory calculations of more than 1300 structures, determining the energy of 64 compounds spanning geometries from planar to pyramidal.







Abstract
Geometrically&#8208;constrained pnictogen pincer complexes have emerged in recent years as platforms for unique stoichiometric and catalytic chemical transformations. These complexes feature dynamic conformations ranging from fully planar at the pnictogen centre to distorted&#8208;pyramidal geometries, as well as variation between phases. Although the valued reactivity of pnictogen pincer complexes is ascribed to their geometries, there is no unified model to explain the observed conformational outcomes across different ligands and pnictogen centres. Here we propose such a model through computational analysis of more than 1300 structures across 64 complexes (16 ligands and 4 heavy pnictogens), explaining the experimental observations and making new predictions. By looking at signatures of bond stability (bond lengths, Wiberg bond indices) and delocalization (NPA charges, Hirshfeld charges), our framework posits a pnictogen&#8208;based &#963;&#8208;bonding effect that favours pyramidalization and exists in competition with a ligand&#8208;based &#960;&#8208;bonding effect that favours planarity. Variations in structure as a function of pnictogen identity, ligand tethering, electronics, and aromaticity can be reconciled with reference to a balance between these two opposing forces. Careful consideration of the &#963;/&#960;&#8208;bonding effects may aid in the rational design of future pnictogen pincer complexes with predictable geometries and reactivities.

         <title>Bisphosphonium Benzene Diimides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phosphonium incorporation onto already electron&#8208;deficient benzene diimides is demonstrated here. In the solid state, these compounds engage in interesting anion&#8211;&#960; interactions and H&#8722;bonding patterns. Injection of electrons is facile (ca. &#8722;0.5&#8197;V vs Fc/Fc+) and results in species with NIR absorption maxima (&#955;max up to 821&#8197;nm).







Abstract
The incorporation of cationic groups onto electron&#8208;poor compounds is a viable strategy for achieving potent electron acceptors, as evidenced by reports of air&#8208;stable radical forms of large aromatic diimides such as naphthalene and perylene diimides. These ions have also been observed to exhibit anion&#8211;&#960; interaction tendencies of interest in molecular recognition applications. The benefits of phosphonium incorporation, however, have not yet been extended to the smallest benzene diimides. Here, we report that dibrominated pyromellitic diimide and mellophanic diimide both readily undergo substitution reactions with phosphine sources to yield bisphosphonium compounds. In the single crystalline form, these dications display anion&#8208;&#960; interactions and, in the case of mellophanic diimide, the stabilization of a bromide&#8211;water H&#8722;bonding ring pattern. The reaction of these dications with chemical reductants readily provides the singly and doubly reduced redox states, which were characterized by UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy and found to exhibit intense absorptions extending into the near&#8208;IR region. Taken together, this work demonstrates that phosphonium incorporation onto congested aromatic diimide scaffolds is synthetically viable and produces unusual electron&#8208;poor compounds.

         <dc:description>
A novel series of vinylene bridged heteroaryls is presented and studied by computational methods. Calculated structural and optoelectronic properties are discussed in order to identify viable molecular designs. Notably, one candidate exhibits a narrow band gap, longer absorption wavelengths, low BLA and reorganization energy. These findings suggest its potential use as a precursor of advanced conjugated materials for organic electronics.







Abstract
Optoelectronic properties of linear &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymers/oligomers are of great importance for the fabrication of organic photonic and electronic devices. To this end, the &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymers/oligomers need to meet both optoelectronic and key structural properties in order to fulfill their implementation as active components. In particular, they need to possess low bandgap and high thermal, conformational, and photochemical stabilities. So far, several strategies have been developed to attain such requirements including the covalent and non&#8208;covalent rigidification concepts of the &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems. On the basis of these findings, we describe herein the theoretical studies of novel series of covalently bridged derivatives demonstrating the benefits of the strategy. Comparison of these derivatives with compounds previously described in the literature highlights enhanced optoelectronic properties and behaviors that would be beneficial for the construction and development of new linear &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymers.

         <title>Bifunctional Ligands: Evaluating the Role of Acidic Protons in the Secondary Coordination Sphere</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ancillary NH groups contained within ligands can participate in reactions through metal&#8208;ligand cooperation. Substitution of the NH moiety by NMe or O can be used in the evaluation of its role. This study investigates how such substitutions also affect the electronics and the binding strengths of the ligand.







Abstract
To evaluate bifunctional ligand reactivity involving NH acidic sites in the secondary coordination sphere, complexes where the proton has been substituted with a methyl group (NMe) are often investigated. An alternative strategy involves substitution of the NH group for an O. This contribution considers and compares the merits of these approaches; the synthesis and characterization of cationic square&#8208;planar Rh carbonyl complexes bearing diprotic bispyrazole pyridine ligand L1, and the bis&#8208;methylated pyrazole pyridine ligand L1Me are described. The syntheses and characterization of the novel monoprotic pyrazole isoxazole pyridine ligand L2 and aprotic bisisoxazole pyridine ligand L3, and their corresponding Rh carbonyl complexes are also described. Comparison of the CO stretching frequencies of the four Rh complexes suggest that substitutions of NH with NMe, as well as with O, lead to significant electronic differences. These electronic differences result in different reactivities with respect to ligand addition/substitution of the Rh carbonyl complexes. Overall, the data suggest that electronic differences arising due to the NH substitutions can be significant and should be considered when the NH group is substituted in investigations of the participation of the NH proton in a reaction.

         <title>Merging of a Supramolecular Ligand with a Switchable Luminophore &#8211; Light&#8208;Responsiveness, Photophysics and Bioimaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of novel luminophores with aggregation&#8208;induced emission is reported. The design concept is based on merging of cyanostilbenes with guanidiniocarbonyl&#8208;pyrroles yielding hybrid luminophores, capable to undergo photoisomerization and are able to be used in biomedical imaging.







Abstract
In this contribution we report on a novel approach towards luminescent light&#8208;responsive ligands. To this end, cyanostilbene&#8208; guanidiniocarbonyl&#8208;pyrrole hybrids were designed and investigated. Merging of a luminophore with a supramolecular bioactive ligand bears numerous advantages by overcoming the typical drawbacks of drug&#8208;labelling, influencing the overall performance of the active species by attachment of a large luminophore. Here we were able to establish a simple and easily accessible synthesis route to different cyanostyryl&#8208;guanidininiocarbonyl&#8208;pyrrole (CGCP) derivatives. These compounds were investigated regarding their light&#8208;responsive double bond isomerisation, their molecular structures in single crystals by means of X&#8208;ray diffractometry, their emission properties by state of the art photophysical characterisation as well as bioimaging and assessment of cell toxicity.

         <title>Assessing Solid Catalysts with Ionic Liquid Layers (SCILL) from Molecular Dynamics Simulations: On the Role of Local Charge Polarization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular simulation models unravel the local charge profile of substrate&#8208;supported nanoparticles in contact to ionic liquid molecules &#8211; thus providing structural and electronic insights to nanosystems used in (electro&#8722;)catalyses. While quantum approaches are limited to comparably small systems, we demonstrate the application of the QEq method for bridging time and length scales significantly. This enables molecular simulation studies for exploring the self&#8208;organization of ionic liquid and reactant molecules on supported nanoparticle models.







Abstract
Recent developments in molecular mechanics modelling of metal catalyst surfaces with interfaces to complex ad&#8208;layers or bulk liquids enable the study of 10&#8197;nm scale systems by molecular dynamics simulations of up to microseconds. Therein, electronic polarization as otherwise benchmarked by quantum calculations is mimicked via atom&#8208;centered partial charges that are adjusted dynamically to account for changes in local environment. Apart from thermal fluctuations, this encompasses molecule association and dissociation processes as well as externally applied voltage. Here, we elaborate the concept of employing the charge equilibration method to the molecular dynamics simulation of solid catalysts, namely metal surfaces and substrate&#8208;supported metal nanoparticles. This showcases the association of reactants and their interplay with local charge polarization upon co&#8208;adsorption of ionic liquids or application of external voltage &#8211; thus paving the way to understanding complex interfaces in (electro&#8722;)catalysis from molecular dynamics simulation.

         <title>Advanced Synthesis, Structural Characterization, and Functional Applications of Precision Polymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By synthesizing precision polymers using four methods &#8211; solid&#8208;phase synthesis, liquid&#8208;phase synthesis, DNA&#8208;template synthesis, and controlled polymerization &#8211; precision polymers with special properties in thermodynamics and crystalline performance have been achieved. These polymers play important roles in fields such as self&#8208;assembly, catalysis, data storage and encryption, imaging, and therapy, among others.







Abstract
In the realm of biological macromolecules, entities such as nucleic acids and proteins are distinguished by their homochirality, consistently defined chain lengths, and integral sequence&#8208;dependent functionalities. Historically, these refined attributes have eluded traditional synthetic polymers, which often exhibit wide variabilities in chain lengths, limited batch&#8208;to&#8208;batch reproducibility, and stochastic monomer arrangements. Bridging this divide represents a pivotal challenge within the domain of polymer science &#8211; a challenge that the burgeoning discipline of precision polymer chemistry is poised to address. Recent advancements have yielded precision polymers that boast prescribed monomer sequences and narrow molecular weight distributions, heralding a new era for developing model systems to decipher structure&#8208;property correlations within functional polymers, analogous to those within biological matrices. This review discusses the innovative liquid&#8208;phase and solid&#8208;phase synthesis techniques for creating precision polymers and the advanced characterization tools essential for dissecting their structure and properties. We highlight potential applications in self&#8208;assembly, catalysis, data storage, imaging, and therapy, and provide insights into the future challenges and directions of precision polymers.

         <title>Sulfonamide&#8208;Sulfonimide Copolymers as Novel, Fluorine&#8208;Lean Type of Proton Exchange Membranes for Fuel Cell Application</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the ongoing search for a cheap and fluorine&#8208;free alternative for perfluorinated sulfonic acid&#8208;polymers (PFSAs), we investigate a set of novel copolymers combining sulfonamide and sulfonimide functionalities. The materials show outstanding conductivities of up to 283&#8197;mS&#8201;c&#8722;1, high thermal stability over 250&#8201;&#176;C and easy manufacturing. On top they contain many possibilities for variation, giving them promising prospects as a new class of ionomers.







Abstract
In this work, a novel type of fluorine&#8208;lean proton exchange membranes is presented, using sulfonamide&#8208;sulfonimide functional groups for ion conduction. These groups are constructed on a polystyrene backbone for simple and cost&#8208;efficient usage as well as rapid scalability. The polymer is further tailored by adjusting the sulfonamide functionality with various end&#8208;groups, namely pentafluorophenyl, 4&#8208;fluorophenyl, butyl and octyl groups. These groups affect the pKa, leading to pKa values of 5.7 for the pentafluorophenyl substitution and pKa 10.5 for the alkyl chain. The glass transition temperature of the sulfonamide homopolymers can be reduced from Tg=151&#8201;&#176;C (Pentafluorophenyl) to 49&#8201;&#176;C (Octyl), making the ionomer more flexible at room temperature. The combination of the non&#8208;swelling sulfonamide further mitigates the high water uptake of the sulfonimide while maintaining the nominal ion exchange capacity. This combination leads to extremely high proton conductivities with up to &#963;=283&#8197;mS&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at room temperature, which is clearly outperforming Nafion and approaches values for acid doped systems. This approach can pave the way to a novel type of ion conducting class in proton exchange membrane fuel cells.

         <title>In situ Reconstructured Alloy Nanosheets Heterojunction for Highly Selective Electrochemical CO2 Reduction to Formate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in&#8208;situ reconstruction process fabricates the Cu2O@Cu6Sn5 heterojunction while preserving the two&#8208;dimensional morphology. The synergistic effect of Cu and Sn active sites stabilizes the *OCHO intermediate, thereby facilitating efficient electrocatalytic formate production. The designed Cu2O@Cu6Sn5 heterojunction demonstrates outstanding CO2RR performance, showcasing its potential for practical applications in sustainable energy conversion and storage.







Abstract
Tin (Sn)&#8208;based materials are expected to realize efficient CO2 electroreduction into formate. Herein, we constructed a heterojunction by depositing Cu on Cu&#8208;doped SnS2 nanosheets. During the electrochemical reaction, this heterojunction evolves to a highly active phase of Cu2O@Cu6Sn5 while maintaining its two&#8208;dimensional morphology. Specifically, a partial current density of 35&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with an impressive faradaic efficiency of 93&#8201;% for formate production was achieved over the evolved heterojunction. In situ and ex situ experiments elucidated the formation mechanism of the Cu&#8322;O@Cu&#8326;Sn&#8325; heterojunction. Cu&#8326;Sn&#8325; nanosheets were formed via a stepwise desulfurization process, while Cu&#8322;O was generated through its reaction with hydroxyl radicals. This evolved heterojunction with a high electrochemically active surface area synergistically stabilized the *OCHO intermediate, thereby significantly enhancing the selectivity and activity. Our findings provide insight into the structural evolution process and guide the development of selective electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction.

         <title>An Effective Strategy on Synthesizing a Stable SiOx&#8208;Based Anode for High Density Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lithium fluoride (LiF) serves as a modified additive, which can enhance the electrochemical performance in SiOx anode material in lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Here, we demonstrate a simple way to prepare a series of SiOx materials with LiF modified. The addition of LiF can stabilize the solid electrolyte interphase layer, reduce the volume expansion, and enhance the Li+ diffusion coefficient.







Abstract
Silicon oxides (SiOx) have received extensive attention as a promising anode candidate for next&#8208;generation lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). However, their commercial applications have been seriously hindered by low conductivity, large volume expansion, and unstable solid&#8208;electrolyte interface (SEI) layer, which result in low initial coulombic efficiency, poor rate performance, and short cycling lifespan. In this work, we demonstrated a simple way to prepare a series of SiOx materials with lithium fluoride (LiF) modified. When the mass ratio of SiOx and LiF equaled 1&#8201;:&#8201;0.15, the long&#8208;term cycling capacity retention could be greatly improved from 30.1&#8201;% to 76.5&#8201;% after 300 cycles. The result was primarily because of the enhancement of electrons and Li+&#8208;ions transport and the stability of the SEI layer due to LiF addition. However, excess LiF addition could hinder the diffusion of Li+&#8208;ions. This study presented the great potential of LiF modified on SiOx anode materials for LIBs.

         <title>Bipyramidal Nanocrystals of Noble Metals: From Synthesis to Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review covers bipyramidal nanocrystals of noble metals, with a focus on the roles played by reduction, etching, and capping in their nucleation and growth. It also discusses how to control the exposed facets, size, aspect ratio, and corner truncation, as well as their effects on plasmonic properties and catalytic applications.







Abstract
Shape control has been a major theme of nanocrystal research in terms of synthesis, property tailoring, and optimization of performance in a variety of applications. Among the possible shapes, bipyramids are unique owing to their symmetry, planar defects, and exposed facets. In this article, we focus on the colloidal synthesis of noble&#8208;metal nanocrystals featuring a triangular bipyramidal shape, together with highlights of their properties and applications. We start with a brief discussion of the general classification and requirements for the nucleation and growth of bipyramidal nanocrystals, followed by specific aspects regarding the synthetic methods with a focus on the roles of reduction, etching, and capping, as well as controls of facet, size, aspect ratio, and corner truncation. In the end, we illustrate how these aspects affect the properties of bipyramidal nanocrystals for plasmonic and catalytic applications, together with future perspectives.

         <title>Benzodifuranone Crystals with Solid&#8208;State Emission Arising from the Introduction of Bulky Substituents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We achieved benzodifuranone crystals with unprecedented solid&#8208;state emission achieved through the introduction of bulky aromatic groups. In addition to the unprecedented solid&#8208;state emission, the compound showed luminescent mechanochromism and thermosalient effect.







Abstract
Benzodifuranone derivatives, structural analogues of widely studied diketopyrrolopyrrole, have been reported to show photoluminescence exclusively in solution states. Here, upon introducing bulky aromatic groups into benzodifuranone dyes, crystals with unprecedented solid&#8208;state emission were obtained. A crystallographic analysis revealed that the emissive properties should most likely be attributed to the absence of stacking between the dye scaffolds. In addition to the solid&#8208;state emission, the compound showed responsivity to external stimuli, i.&#8201;e., luminescent mechanochromism and thermosalient effect.

         <title>Phosphonium SF5&#8722; Salts Derived from Sulfur Hexafluoride as Deoxyfluorination Reagents</title>

Sulfur hexafluoride valorization with phosphines affords crystalline phosphonium SF5&#8722; salts that are used as deoxyfluorination reagents.







Abstract
Sulfur based deoxyfluorination reagents are usually derived from the corrosive gas SF4. Herein, we report the synthesis and properties of an easily accessible phosphonium salt [(tmg)3PF]+SF5&#8722; (1) which was obtained from the reaction of sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) with tris(tetramethylguanidinyl)phosphine. The performance of this crystalline SF5&#8722; salt as a reagent in deoxyfluorination reactions was investigated together with a second SF5&#8722; salt [(R1)3PF]+SF5&#8722; (2) containing bulky substituents (R1=1,3&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylimidazolidin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidenamino). Both reagents proved to be effective for the deoxyfluorination of various functional groups including alcohols, anhydrides, and amides.

         <title>Surface Plasmon Resonance Allows to Correlate Molecular Properties With Diffusion Coefficients of Linear Chain Alcohols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a new model to describe and fit the behavior of diffusion coefficients (D) as a function of molecular structure and thermodynamic parameters in binary solutions of linear chain organic molecules. The model is validated using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) experiments and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for a series of n&#8208;alcohols, revealing a strong dependence of D on molecular shape and solute&#8208;solvent interactions.

&#8208;alcohols through a novel surface plasmon resonance method and molecular dynamics simulations. This allows to propose a kind of combined analysis to explain the dependence of

 on various thermodynamic and structural parameters. The results suggest that for small linear systems in the range from 0 to 200&#8197;g&#8201;mol&#8722;1 and under the assumption that the diffusive activation energy is a linear function of mass,

 is strictly dependent on the molecular shape and on the relative strength of the solute&#8208;solvent intermolecular forces represented by a parameter named R.

         <title>Tracking Microenvironmental Response on Self&#8208;Assembled Phthalocyanine Systems &#8211; Adaptive and Non&#8208;Adaptive Antibacterial Photosensitization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study using steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved fluorescence measurements, we investigate how self&#8208;assembled photosensitizers respond to changes in molecular crowding and presence of different bacteria. We observed that certain systems exhibit adaptive behavior and alter their photoinduced activity, while others do not, highlighting the impact of confined environments and intermolecular interactions on the relaxation pathways of excited states in photoactive molecules.







Abstract
Self&#8208;assembly has proven to be one of the effective methods for the formation of nanoscale therapeutics without the need to use nanodelivery systems. Such minimal models of supramolecular systems formed from amphiphilic photosensitizers (PS) have recently emerged as a new class of photoactive systems, providing unique and in some cases superior activities. Although the mechanism of photogenerated reactive oxygen species (ROS) in such systems is studied and to a certain extent understood, there are very limited studies investigating the influence of intricate environmental factors, including those occurring in the cellular environment, on the self&#8208;assembly and thus the activity of the system. Understanding the optimal conditions for the formation of active PS aggregates is an important area of research in the field of photodynamic therapy (PDT), as it is directly linked to the optimal treatment dose. In this study, we describe the synthesis, self&#8208;assembly properties, photophysical characterization, and photobiological efficacy of structurally closely related low&#8208;symmetry phthalocyanine derivatives. Studying the decay behavior of the PS fluorescence lifetime in the presence of molecular crowders and different bacterial strains, we found that certain derivatives exhibited adaptive behavior and change in activity, while others demonstrated non&#8208;adaptive characteristics.

         <title>Improved Electrochemical Peptide Synthesis Enabled by Electron&#8208;Rich Triaryl Phosphines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tris(4&#8208;methoxyphenyl) phosphine enable the electrochemical synthesis of peptides which are difficult with the previously reported method using triphenyl phosphine. In addition, this phosphine has a potential to be a recyclable coupling reagent. This study also presents that substituents on phosphines influence the reactivity of phosphine (radical) cation and have an important role in avoiding side reactions.







Abstract
While remarkable progress has been made in the development of peptide medicines, many problems related to peptide synthesis remain unresolved. Previously, we reported electrochemical peptide synthesis using a phosphine as a potentially recyclable coupling reagent. However, there was room for improvement from the point of view of reaction efficiency, especially in the carboxylic acid activation step and the peptide bond formation step. To overcome these challenges, we searched for the optimal phosphine. Among phosphines with various electronic properties, we found that electron&#8208;rich triaryl phosphines improved the reaction efficiency. Consequently, we successfully performed electrochemical peptide synthesis on sterically hindered and valuable amino acids. We also synthesized oligopeptides that were challenging with our previous method. Finally, we examined the effect of substituents on the phosphine cations, and gained some insights into reactivity, which will aid researchers designing reactions involving phosphine cations.

         <title>Cobalt Nanoparticles Catalyzed N&#8208;Heterocycles Synthesis via Acceptorless Dehydrogenative Coupling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient Co&#8722;Si/CN catalyst derived from MOFs/SiO2 composite was prepared using a one&#8208;step assembly process involving pyrolysis and etching. This catalyst exhibited outstanding catalytic activity in the synthesis of quinoline and pyridine derivatives through acceptorless dehydrogenative coupling of 2&#8208;aminoalcohols with secondary alcohols.







Abstract
The acceptorless dehydrogenation reaction is a sustainable and atom&#8208;economical methodology in organic synthesis, resulting in the byproducts of only hydrogen or water. Herein, a robust Co&#8722;Si/CN catalyst (derived from ZIF@SiO2 composite) has been synthesized through a one&#8208;step assembly process via pyrolysis and etching. This catalyst has been employed for the acceptorless dehydrogenative coupling of 2&#8208;aminoalcohols with secondary alcohols, enabling efficient conversion of various substrates into desired quinoline or pyridine derivatives with a yield of up to 94&#8201;%.

         <title>One&#8208;pot Functionalization for the Preparation of Cobaltocene&#8208;Modified Redox&#8208;Responsive Porous Microparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The convenient modification of microparticles with cobaltocenium moieties is described by taking advantage of a hydroamination reaction with a metal&#8208;containing acetylene derivative. The high accuracy of this technique opens the way to tailored stimuli&#8208;responsive spheres showing reversible redox&#8208;addressability over high cycling numbers. The herein&#8208;presented metallopolymer&#8208;based particles can also be converted to porous ceramics.







Abstract
Porous organic cobaltocenium&#8208;containing particles are scarce in literature but highly interesting for their electrochemical properties and reusability in, for example, catalysis or magnetic systems. In this work, we present a scalable one&#8208;pot strategy to introduce tailorable amounts of cobaltocenium on a porous substrate, adjusting the electrochemical switching capability. For this purpose, 3&#8208;(triethoxysilyl)propan&#8208;1&#8208;amine (APTES) and ethynyl cobaltocenium hexafluorophosphate is used as functionalization agents for in&#8208;situ catalyst&#8208;free hydroamination, followed by silane condensation at the particles&#8217; surface. Functionalized particles are characterized by attenuated total reflection infrared spectroscopy (ATR&#8208;IR), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy (EDS), inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP&#8208;MS), powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (PXRD) and cyclic voltammetry (CV) showing excellent control over the degree of functionalization, i.&#8201;e., the added cobaltocenium reagents. The electrochemical stability and good addressability while preserving the porous structure are shown. By utilizing higher amounts of APTES, the overall cobaltocenium amount can be reduced in favor of additional amine groups, strongly affecting the electrochemical behavior, making this functionalization strategy a good platform for metallopolymer immobilization and tailored functionalization. Additionally, thermal treatment of the synthesized metallopolymer microparticles paves the way to magnetic properties with tailorable microporous architectures for end&#8208;of&#8208;life and upcycling aspects.

         <title>Neptunyl Pyrrophen Complexes: Exploring Schiff Base Chemistry with Multidentate Acyclic Ligands and Transuranics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present the first two neptunyl&#8208;pyrrophen compounds. Formerly synthesized with uranyl, these unique hexadentate ligands readily coordinate equatorially with neptunyl ions. The crystal structure is determined, and diffuse reflectance and FTIR spectra are measured. Scrutiny is placed on the NpO2L1 compound which is determined to exist as a mixed valence species of Np(V/VI).







Abstract
We report the synthesis, structure, and characterization of two novel neptunyl complexes (NpO2L1 and NpO2L2) constructed from phenylene&#8208;substituted benzyl ester bis(pyrrole)phenylenediamine (named &#8220;pyrrophen&#8221;) ligands. In both cases, the neptunium center exists in the +6 oxidation state,. As our specific interest is in exploring the chemistry of neptunium compounds containing the linear neptunyl ion (NpO22+) through equatorially coordinating the metal by multidentate organic ligands, we have identified the differences that are likely to cause discrepancy between the two complexes by examining the ions and their coordinative environments through single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography, diffuse reflectance, and Raman spectroscopy. This is the first time pyrrophen has been utilized in Np chemistry and demonstrates a new platform to study 5&#8201;f electron participation and coordination.

         <title>Recent Toolboxes for Chemoselective Dual Modifications of Proteins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The capacity to synthesize complex protein conjugates functionalized with two or more distinct moieties has revolutionized the field of chemical biology. This review summarizes contemporary chemical biology tools for protein dual chemical modifications, along with the discussion of their respective advantages, limitations, and potential future directions within this rapidly evolving area.







Abstract
Site&#8208;selective chemical modifications of proteins have emerged as a potent technology in chemical biology, materials science, and medicine, facilitating precise manipulation of proteins with tailored functionalities for basic biology research and developing innovative therapeutics. Compared to traditional recombinant expression methods, one of the prominent advantages of chemical protein modification lies in its capacity to decorate proteins with a wide range of functional moieties, including non&#8208;genetically encoded ones, enabling the generation of novel protein conjugates with enhanced or previously unexplored properties. Among these, approaches for dual or multiple modifications of proteins are increasingly garnering attention, as it has been found that single modification of proteins is inadequate to meet current demands. Therefore, in light of the rapid developments in this field, this review provides a timely and comprehensive overview of the latest advancements in chemical and biological approaches for dual functionalization of proteins. It further discusses their advantages, limitations, and potential future directions in this relatively nascent area.

         <title>Electrocatalytic Dinitrogen Reduction to Ammonia Using Easily Reducible N&#8208;Fused Cobalt Porphyrins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New single&#8208;site molecular electrocatalysts, based on easily reducible N&#8208;fused cobalt porphyrins, have been developed for dinitrogen reduction to ammonia. Faradic efficiencies have been achieved in the 6&#8211;7.5&#8201;% range with ammonia yield rates of 300&#8211;340&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 at room temperature and neutral pH conditions. Mild reaction conditions for dinitrogen electro&#8208;reduction are accomplished.







Abstract
Single&#8208;site molecular electrocatalysts, especially those that perform catalytic conversion of N2 to NH3 under mild conditions, are highly desirable to derive fundamental structure&#8208;activity relations and as potential alternatives to the current energy&#8208;consuming Haber&#8208;Bosch ammonia production process. Combining theoretical calculations with experimental evidence, it has been shown that easily reducible cobalt porphyrins catalyze the six&#8208;electron, six&#8208;proton reduction of dinitrogen to NH3 at neutral pH and under ambient conditions. Two easily reducible N&#8208;fused cobalt porphyrins &#8211; CoNHF and CoNHF(Br)2 &#8211; reveal NRR activity with Faradic efficiencies between 6&#8211;7.5&#8201;% with ammonia yield rates of 300&#8211;340&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1. Contrary to this, much harder&#8208;to&#8208;reduce N&#8208;fused porphyrins &#8211; CoNHF(Ph)2 and CoNHF(PE)2 &#8211; reveal no NRR activity. The present study highlights the significance of tuning the redox and structural properties of single&#8208;site NRR electrocatalysts for improved NRR activity under mild conditions.

         <title>Neutral and Anion Species of Quinoidal Thienothiophene Diketopyrrolopyrroles Display a Common Aggregation Mode</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diketopyrrolopyrrol quinoidal oligomers aggregate in a very similar way in the neutral state and in the dimer dianion states due to an uniform distribution of the electron charge excess between the two molecules in the dimer dianion.







Abstract
A comprehensive investigation of two new molecular triads incorporating the diketopyrrolopyrrole unit into a quinoidized thienothiophene skeleton, which is further end&#8208;capped with dicyanomethylene (DPP&#8208;TT&#8208;CN) or phenoxyl groups (DPP&#8208;TT&#8208;PhO), has been carried out. A combination of UV&#8208;Vis&#8208;NIR and infrared spectroelectrochemical techniques and cryogenic UV&#8208;Vis&#8208;NIR absorption spectroscopy supported by theoretical calculations has been used. The main result is the formation of similar H&#8208;aggregates in the dimerization process of the neutral molecules and of the charged anionic species. The experimental absorption spectra of the aggregated species are accurately reproduced by quantum chemical calculations using the Spano's model, including excitonic coupling for the dimeric forms and full vibronic resolution of the absorption bands. The strong excitonic coupling taking place is key to understand the electronic structure of the dimeric species and has been instrumental to disentangle the type of H&#8208;aggregation. This study is of relevance to get a better understanding of the molecular aggregation of organic &#960;&#8208;conjugated chromophores and is useful as a guideline for the refinement of the engineering of molecular materials for which supramolecular design is required.
