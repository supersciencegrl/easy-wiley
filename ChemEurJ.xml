      <title>The Cascade Reactions of Indigo with Propargyl Substrates for Heterocyclic and Photophysical Diversity</title>
      <dc:description>The synthesis of structurally diverse heterocycles for chemical space exploration was achieved  via  the cascade reactions of indigo with propargylic electrophiles. New pyrazinodiindolodione, naphthyridinedione, azepinodiindolone, oxazinoindolone and pyrrolodione products were prepared in one pot reactions by varying the leaving group (&#8208;Cl, &#8208;Br, &#8208;OMs, &#8208;OTs) or propargyl terminal functionality (&#8208;H, &#8208;Me, &#8208;Ph, &#8208;Ar). Mechanistic and density functional theory studies revealed that the unsaturated propargyl moiety can behave as an electrophile when aromatic terminal substitutions are made, and therefore competes with leaving group substitution for new outcomes. Selected products from the cascade reactions were investigated for their absorption and fluorescence properties, including transient absorption spectroscopy. This revealed polarity dependent excited state relaxation pathways, fluorescence, and triplet formation, thus highlighting these reactions as a means to access diverse functional materials rapidly.</dc:description>

      <title>Synthesis of Oligonucleotides containing the cis&#8208;Interstrand Crosslink Produced by Mitomycins in their Reaction with DNA</title>
      <dc:description>
Mitomycins are important anti&#8208;cancer drugs. Treatment of cancer cells with mitomycins generates stereoisomeric (trans and cis) DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICLs), which prevent these highly proliferating cells from replicating. trans&#8208;Crosslinks are formed exclusively at CpG sequences, while cis&#8208;crosslinks are formed only at GpC sequences. This work describes a synthetic methodology to generate oligonucleotides containing the cis&#8208;ICL (green ICL in the picture). Structural proof of the crosslinked oligonucleotide was obtained, and a virtual model of the duplex was created. More information can be found in the Full Paper by E. Champeil et&#8197;al.

      <dc:description>
The design of proton&#8208;responsive ligands and their use in the field of homogeneous electrocatalytic proton reduction is reported in this work. The cobalt complex, [Co(HBMIMPh2)2]2+ comprises two bis(1&#8208;methyl&#8208;4,5&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;1H&#8208;imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)methane (HBMIMPh2) ligands that contain an acidic methylene moiety in their backbone. The reported results represent the joint involvement of a base metal&#8208;hydride and a C&#8722;H bond in electrocatalytic proton reduction and are of interest to the development of responsive ligands for molecular (base)metal (electro)catalysis.

      <title>Alkaline Earth Metals Activate N2 and CO in Cubic Complexes Just Like Transition Metals: A Conceptual Density Functional Theory and Energy Decomposition Analysis Study</title>
      <dc:description>
Alkaline earth metals activate the fixation of N2 because of the &#960;&#8208;backdonation from the metal to the ligand; a phenomenon often considered exclusive to transition metals. Conceptual DFT descriptors reveal an increased soft character of the outer N&#8208;atom in cubic and octahedral group II, IV, and VI complexes, compared to isolated N2. Quantitative EDA studies confirm increased proton affinities due to stronger (soft) orbital interactions between the N2&#8208;ligand and H+. More information can be found in the Full Paper by G. Frenking, P. Geerlings, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202001585).

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Alkaline earth metals activate the fixation of N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; because of the &#960;&#8208;backdonation from the metal to the ligand; a phenomenon often considered exclusive to transition metals. Conceptual DFT descriptors reveal an increased soft character of the outer N&#8208;atom in cubic and octahedral group II, IV, and VI complexes, compared to isolated N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Quantitative EDA studies confirm increased proton affinities due to stronger (soft) orbital interactions between the N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;ligand and H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;.

      <title>Origin of Ferromagnetism and Magnetic Anisotropy in a Family of Copper(II) Triangles</title>
      <dc:description>
Single&#8208;crystal electron paramagnetic resonance studies of a ferromagnetic copper(II) triangle were combined with ab initio calculations, and analyzed through a detailed multispin Hamiltonian to explain the origins of the ground state ferromagnetism and anisotropy. This combined analysis demonstrated that the symmetry of the magnetic orbitals is responsible for the observed ferromagnetism, and highlighted the role of dipolar interactions and anisotropic exchange in inducing magnetic anisotropy.

      <title>Heterogeneous Parahydrogen&#8208;Induced Polarization of Diethyl Ether for Magnetic Resonance Imaging Applications</title>
      <dc:description>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with the use of hyperpolarized gases as contrast agents provides valuable information on lungs structure and function. While the technology of  129  Xe hyperpolarization for clinical MRI research is well developed, it requires the expensive equipment for production and detection of hyperpolarized  129  Xe. Herein we present the  1  H hyperpolarization of diethyl ether vapor that can be imaged on any clinical MRI scanner.  1  H nuclear spin polarization of up to 1.3% was achieved using heterogeneous hydrogenation of ethyl vinyl ether with parahydrogen over Rh/TiO  2  catalyst. Liquefaction of diethyl ether vapor proceeds with partial preservation of hyperpolarization and prolongs its lifetime by ~10 times. The proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle 2D  1  H MRI of hyperpolarized diethyl ether was demonstrated with 0.1&#215;1.1 mm  2  spatial and 120 ms temporal resolution. The long history of use of diethyl ether for anesthesia is expected to facilitate the clinical translation of the presented approach.</dc:description>

      <title>Growth of ZIF&#8208;8 MOF Films with Tunable Porosity by using Poly (1&#8208;vinylimidazole) Brushes as 3D Primers</title>
      <dc:description>
ZIF&#8208;8 (based on Zn and 2&#8208;methylimidazole) MOF film growth can be controlled by using SI&#8208;ATRP&#8208;synthesized polymeric brushes as 3D primers. This strategy relies on the inclusion of chemical moieties in the brush, which are compatible with MOF chemical structure. According to such criteria, Poly(1&#8208;vinylimidazole) brushes with increasingly higher grafting densities were selected. Aside from the inherently hydrophobic microporosity arising from ZIF&#8208;8 structure, our approach renders control over the proportion of constructional mesoporosity, which allow differential adsorption. More information can be found in the Full Paper by O. Azzaroni, M. Rafti, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202002493).

      <title>Core Charge Density Dominated Size&#8208;Conversion from Au6P8 to Au8P8Cl2</title>
      <dc:description>
The kinetic profiles for the size&#8208;conversion from [Au6(DPPP)4]2+ (carp) to [Au8(DPPP)4Cl2]2+ (dragon) has been elucidated by density functional theory calculations. The [Au7(DPPP)4]3+ (door) formed by AuI growth on Au6 is the key intermediate, and its Au&#8722;P dissociation is the rate&#8208;limiting step. The easiness for dissociating different Au&#8722;P bonds is regulated by core charge density of the cluster precursors. More information can be found in the Full Paper by H. Yu et&#8197;al.

      <title>The deposition of the spin crossover Fe(II)&#8208;pyrazolylborate complex on Au(111) surface at molecular level</title>

Our results show that the adsorption on the metallic surface enhances the transition energy, increasing the relative stability of the low spin (LS) state. The interaction indeed is spin&#8208;dependent, stronger for the low spin than the high spin (HS) state. The different strength of the Fe ligand field at low and high temperature manifests on the nature, spatial extension and relative energy of the states close to the Fermi level, with a larger metal&#8208;ligand hybridization in the LS state. This feature is of relevance for the differential adsorption of the LS and HS molecules, the spin&#8208;dependent conductance, and for the differences found in the corresponding STM images, correctly reproduced from the density of states provided by the rPBE calculations. It is expected that this spin dependence will be a general feature of the SCO molecule&#8208;substrate interaction, since it is rooted in the different ligand field of Fe site at low and high temperatures, a common hallmark of the Fe(II) SCO complexes. Finally, the states involved in the LIESST phenomenon has been identify through NEVPT2 calculations on a model reaction path. A tentative pathway for the photoinduced LS [[EQUATION]] HS transition is proposed, that does not involve the intermediate triplet states, and nicely reproduces both the blue laser wavelength required for the activation, and the wavelength of the reverse HS [[EQUATION]] LS transition.</dc:description>

      <title>A Water&#8208;Soluble Peptoid that Can Extract Cu2+ from Metallothionein via Selective Recognition</title>
      <dc:description>Selective binding of Cu  2+  in water medium by a synthetic chelator is a promising therapeutic approach towards the treatment of various diseases including cancer. Chelation of Cu  2+  is well exercised, however water&#8208;soluble synthetic chelators that can selectively bind Cu  2+  from a pool of competing metal ions at very high excess and/or can extract Cu  2+  from a protein are hardly reported. Herein we describe the design and synthesis of an acetylated peptoid &#8211; N&#8208;substituted glycine trimer &#8211; that incorporates a picolyl group at the N&#8208;terminal, a non&#8208;coordinating but structurally directing bulky chiral phenylethyl group at the  C  &#8208;terminus and a modified 2,2'&#8208;bipyridine group (  PCA&#8208;Nspe  ), which selectively binds Cu  2+  to form a water&#8208;soluble complex. We further demonstrate that the selectivity of  PCA&#8208;Nspe  to Cu  2+  is thermodynamically driven, leading to specific binding of Cu  2+  in an aqueous solution containing up to 60 folds excess of other biologically relevant metal ions such as Zn  2+  , Co  2+  , Mn  2+  , Ca  2+  , Mg  2+  , K  +  and Na  +  . Based on spectroscopic data and DFT calculations of  PCA&#8208;Nspe  as well as of a control peptoid having an achiral benzyl group instead of the phenylethyl side chain, we could suggest that the chiral and bulkier phenylethyl group at the  C  &#8208;terminus controls the preorganization of the two ligands and this might play a role in the selectivity of  PCA&#8208;Nspe  . Significantly, we show that  PCA&#8208;Nspe  can extract Cu  2+  from the natural copper binding protein metallothionein.</dc:description>

      <title>Cyclic peptides as drugs for intracellular targets: the next frontier in peptide therapeutic development</title>
      <dc:description>Developing macrocyclic peptides that can reach intracellular targets is a significant challenge. This review discusses the most recent strategies used to develop cell permeable cyclic peptides that maintain binding to their biological target inside the cell.&#160; Macrocyclic peptides are unique from small molecules because traditional calculated physical properties are unsuccessful for predicting cell membrane permeability. Peptide synthesis and experimental membrane permeability is the only strategy that effectively differentiates between cell permeable and cell impermeable molecules. Discussed are chemical strategies, including backbone N&#8208;methylation and stereochemical changes, which have produced molecular scaffolds with improved cell permeability. However, these improvements often come at the expense of biological activity as chemical modifications alter the peptide conformation, frequently impacting the compound&#8217;s ability to bind to the target. Highlighted is the most promising approach, which involves side chain alterations that improve cell permeability without impact binding events.</dc:description>

Highlighted is the most promising approach, which involves side chain alterations that improve cell permeability without impact binding events.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Structural Expansion of Chalcogenido Tetrelates in Ionic Liquids by Incorporation of Sulfido Antimonate Units</title>
      <dc:description>Multinary chalcogenido metalate salts exhibit finely tunable optical properties based on the combination of metal and chalcogenide ions in their polyanionic substructure. Here, we present the structural expansion of chalcogenido germanate(IV) or stannate(IV) architectures with Sb(III), which clearly affects the vibrational and optical absorption properties of the solid compounds. For the synthesis of the title compounds, [K4(H2O)4][Ge4S10] or [K4(H2O)4][SnS4] were reacted with SbCl3 under ionothermal conditions in imidazolium based ionic liquids. Salt metathesis at relatively low temperatures (120&#176;C) enabled the incorporation of (formally) Sb3+ ions into the anionic substructure of the precursors, and their modification to form (Cat)16[Ge2Sb2S7]6[GeS4] (1) and (Cat)6[Sn10O4S20][Sb3S4]2 (2a and 2b), wherein Cat = (C4C1C1Im)+ (1 and 2a) or (C4C1C2Im)+ (2b). In 1, germanium and antimony atoms are combined to form a rare noradamantane&#8208;type ternary molecular anion, six of which surround a [GeS4] unit in a highly symmetric secondary structure, and finally crystallize in a diamond&#8208;like superstructure. In 2, supertetrahedral oxo&#8208;sulfido stannate clusters are generated, as known from the ionothermal treatment of the stannate precursor alone, yet, linked here into unprecedented one&#8208;dimensional strands with {Sb3S4} units as linkers. We discuss the single&#8208;crystal structures of these uncommon salts of ternary and quaternary chalcogenido metalate anions, as well as their Raman and UV&#8208;visible spectra.</dc:description>

      <title>Isoselective Polymerization of rac&#8208;Lactide by Highly Active Sequential {ONNN} Magnesium Complexes</title>
      <dc:description>The coordination chemistry and the activities in the ring&#8208;opening polymerization catalysis of racemic lactide of magnesium complexes of a series of {ONNN}&#8208;type sequential monoanionic ligands are described. All ligands include pyridyl and substituted&#8208;phenolate as peripheral groups. The ligands bearing either chiral&#8208; or  meso  &#8208;bipyrrolidine cores led to single diastereomeric complexes, whereas the ligands bearing a diaminoethane core led to diastereomer mixtures. All {ONNN}Mg&#8208;X complexes (X = Cl, HMDS) led to highly active and isoselective catalysts. The complexes bearing the chiral bipyrrolidine core exhibited the highest activities &#8211; full consumption of 5000 equiv of  rac  &#8208;LA at RT within 5 min, and highest isoselectivities &#8211;  P  m  = 0.91, as well as a living character. The complexes of the  meso  &#8208;bipyrrolidine based ligands were almost as active and slightly less stereoselective, while those of the diaminoethane based ligands exhibited reduced activities and isoselectivities.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The coordination chemistry and the activities in the ring&#8208;opening polymerization catalysis of racemic lactide of magnesium complexes of a series of {ONNN}&#8208;type sequential monoanionic ligands are described. All ligands include pyridyl and substituted&#8208;phenolate as peripheral groups. The ligands bearing either chiral&#8208; or  meso  &#8208;bipyrrolidine cores led to single diastereomeric complexes, whereas the ligands bearing a diaminoethane core led to diastereomer mixtures. All {ONNN}Mg&#8208;X complexes (X = Cl, HMDS) led to highly active and isoselective catalysts. The complexes bearing the chiral bipyrrolidine core exhibited the highest activities &#8211; full consumption of 5000 equiv of  rac  &#8208;LA at RT within 5 min, and highest isoselectivities &#8211;  P  m  = 0.91, as well as a living character. The complexes of the  meso  &#8208;bipyrrolidine based ligands were almost as active and slightly less stereoselective, while those of the diaminoethane based ligands exhibited reduced activities and isoselectivities.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <dc:description>
Metal&#8211;metal cooperation plays a crucial role in synergistic catalysis including C&#8722;C bond coupling. This work reports dynamic Pd/Cu assemblies as models to study individual steps of Sonogashira coupling. This study reveals the importance of rearrangements of the highly dynamic multimetallic assemblies (represented as constellations in this cover image) at the various steps of alkyne activation and transmetalation.

      <dc:description>
&#8220;Jumpy&#8221; five&#8208;membered carbocycles in carbaporphyrinoids: Dicarba[26]hexachlorins(1.1.1.1.1.1.) with built&#8208;in cyclopentenyl and cyclopentadienyl moieties can adopt two essential conformations: dumbbell&#8208;shaped and rectangular convoluted respectively with regular and doubly inverted carbocyclic rings. The transformation between conformers has been controlled by an external factor including protonation.

      <title>Probing the Origin of Adaptive Aromaticity in 16&#8208;Valence&#8208;Electron Metallapentalenes</title>
      <dc:description>
16&#8208;Valence&#8208;electron metallapentalenes are among the few adaptive aromatic compounds, which are aromatic in both the S0 and T1 states. The origin of adaptive aromaticity had been elusive to our knowledge. Herein, we propose a competent rationalization of how adaptive aromaticity is achieved. The studied candidates have been supplemented to include not only the first&#8208;reported osmapentalene but also isoelectronic ruthenapentalenes and iridapentalenes, with an extended scope of ligands. Strong &#960;&#8208; or &#963;&#8208;donor ligands can promote the formation of adaptive aromaticity. More information can be found in the Full Paper by J.&#8197;Zhu, M.&#8197;Sol&#224;, et&#8197;al.

A conical porphyrin fully embedded in a carbon nanosheet was prepared by collision&#8208;induced dissociation of saddle&#8208;shaped tetraaryltetrabenzoporphyrins, by means of hydrogen fluoride elimination in the mass spectrometer. Supported by density functional theory calculations, mechanistic insights were gained by variation of central metal atoms and fluorophenyl substituents.

      <title>Stepwise Assembly of an Electroactive Framework from a Co6S8 Superatomic Metalloligand and Cuprous Iodide Building Units</title>
      <dc:description>
A double&#8208;cluster framework comprising octahedral Co6S8 superatoms, tetrahedral Cu4I4 clusters, and 1,3,5&#8208;triaza&#8208;7&#8208;phosphaadamantane (PTA) bifunctional linkers was prepared using a stepwise approach. The synthesis relies on the use of a stable, pre&#8208;formed Co6S8(PTA)6 superatomic&#8208;metalloligand, which can undergo further coordination&#8208;driven assembly in the presence of CuI. The resulting three&#8208;dimensional coordination polymer exhibits reversible redox behavior in the solid state. The artwork portrays a pair of star clusters known as the Double Cluster, which resides in the northern part of the constellation Perseus. The star clusters are 7500 light years from Earth and each contain 300 to 400 stars that can be viewed using a pair of binoculars. Illustration by Frank A. Martinez.

      <title>Selective Activation of Aromatic Aldehydes Promoted by Dispersion Interactions: Steric and Electronic Factors of a &#960;&#8208;Pocket within Cage&#8208;Shaped Borates for Molecular Recognition</title>
      <dc:description>Selective bond formations are one of the most important reactions in organic synthesis. In the Lewis acid&#8211;mediated electrophile reactions of carbonyls, the selective formation of a carbonyl&#8211;acid complex has played a critical role in determining selectivity, which is based on the difference in the coordinative interaction between the carbonyl and Lewis acid center. Although this strategy has attained progress in selective bond formations, the discrimination between similarly sized aromatic and aliphatic carbonyls that have no functional anchors to strongly interact with the metal center still remains a challenging issue. In this manuscript, we alternatively focus on the molecular recognition driven by dispersion forces within some aromatic moieties. We designed a Lewis acid catalyst with a&#160;&#960; &#8208;space cavity, which was referred to as a&#160; &#960;  &#8208;pocket  , as the recognition site for aromatic carbonyls. The cage&#8208;shaped borates&#160;  1  B with various&#160; &#960; &#8208;pockets demonstrated significant chemoselectivity for aromatic aldehydes&#160;  3b  &#8211;  f  &#160;over the aliphatic&#160;  3a  &#160;in the competitive hetero Diels&#8208;Alder reactions. The effectiveness of our catalysts was also evidenced by intramolecular recognition of the aromatic carbonyl within a dicarbonyl substrate. The mechanistic and theoretical studies demonstrated that the selective activation of aromatic substrates is driven by the preorganized step with a larger dispersion force rather than the rate&#8208;determining step of the C&#8211;C bond formation, and this likely contributes to the preferred activation of aromatic substrates over aliphatic ones.</dc:description>

      <title>Naphthoquinone&#8208;Dopamine hybrids inhibit&#160;&#945;&#8208;synuclein aggregation, disrupt preformed fibrils and attenuate aggregate&#8208;induced toxicity</title>
      <dc:description>Accumulation and aggregation of the intrinsically disordered protein &#945;&#8208;synuclein (&#945;&#8208;Syn) into amyloid fibrils are hallmarks of a series of heterogeneous neurodegenerative disorders, known as synucleinopathies and most notably Parkinson&#8217;s disease (PD). The crucial role of &#945;&#8208;Syn aggregation in PD makes it an attractive target for the development of disease&#8208;modifying therapeutics that would inhibit &#945;&#8208;Syn aggregation or disrupt its preformed fibrillar assemblies. To that end, we have designed and synthesized two naphthoquinone&#8208;dopamine&#8208;based hybrid small molecules, NQDA and Cl&#8208;NQDA, and demonstrated their ability to inhibit in vitro amyloid formation by &#945;&#8208;Syn using ThT assay, CD, TEM, and Congo red birefringence. Moreover, these hybrid molecules efficiently disassembled preformed fibrils of &#945;&#8208;Syn into non&#8208;toxic species, as evident from LUV leakage assay. NQDA and Cl&#8208;NQDA were found to have low cytotoxicity and they attenuated the toxicity induced by &#945;&#8208;Syn towards SH&#8208;SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. NQDA was found to efficiently cross an in vitro human blood&#8208;brain barrier model. These naphthoquinone&#8208;dopamine based derivatives can be an attractive scaffold for therapeutic design towards PD.</dc:description>

To that end, we have designed and synthesized two naphthoquinone&#8208;dopamine&#8208;based hybrid small molecules, NQDA and Cl&#8208;NQDA, and demonstrated their ability to inhibit in vitro amyloid formation by &#945;&#8208;Syn using ThT assay, CD, TEM, and Congo red birefringence. Moreover, these hybrid molecules efficiently disassembled preformed fibrils of &#945;&#8208;Syn into non&#8208;toxic species, as evident from LUV leakage assay. NQDA and Cl&#8208;NQDA were found to have low cytotoxicity and they attenuated the toxicity induced by &#945;&#8208;Syn towards SH&#8208;SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. NQDA was found to efficiently cross an in vitro human blood&#8208;brain barrier model. These naphthoquinone&#8208;dopamine based derivatives can be an attractive scaffold for therapeutic design towards PD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <dc:description>
Visible&#8208;light&#8208;photocatalyzed methods employed in synthetic transformations present attractive properties, such as environmentally friendly, safety, availability and excellent functional group tolerance. Research on the visible&#8208;light photocatalytic incorporation of the trifluoromethyl moiety into organic substrates has contributed to a clear evolution of the field of photocatalysis. Although this particular area is constantly evolving and has been reviewed, a number of seminal and significant photocatalytic trifluoromethylation examples have been reported in the last five years. These recent advances are here presented and discussed. For more details see the Review by A. Postigo et&#8197;al. on page&#8197;11065&#8197;ff.

      <title>Insights in LiAlH4 Catalysed Imine Hydrogenation</title>
      <dc:description>Commercial LiAlH4 can be used in catalytic quantities in the hydrogenation of imines to amines with H2. Combined experimental and theoretical investigations give deeper insight in the mechanism and identifies the most likely catalytic cycle. Activity is lost when Li in LiAlH4 is exchanged for Na or K. Exchanging Al for B or Ga also led to dramatically reduced activities. This indicates a heterobimetallic mechanism in which cooperation between Li and Al is crucial. Potential intermediates on the catalytic pathway have been isolated from reactions of MAlH4 (M = Li, Na, K) and different imines. Depending on the imine, double, triple or quadruple imine insertion has been observed. Prolonged reaction of LiAlH4 with PhC(H)=NtBu led to a side&#8208;reaction and gave the double insertion product LiAlH2[N]2 ([N] = N(tBu)CH2Ph) which at higher temperature reacts further by ortho&#8208;metallation of the Ph ring. A DFT study led to a number of conclusions. The most likely catalyst for hydrogenation of PhC(H)=NtBu with LiAlH4 is LiAlH2[N]2. Insertion of a third imine via a heterobimetallic transition state has a barrier of +23.2 kcal/mol (DH). The rate&#8208;determining step is hydrogenolysis of LiAlH[N]3 with H2 with a barrier of +29.2 kcal/mol. In agreement with experiment, replacing Li for Na (or K) and Al for B (or Ga) led to higher calculated barriers. Also, the AlH4&#713; anion showed very high barriers. Calculations support the experimentally observed effects of the imine substituents at C and N: the lowest barriers are calculated for imines with aryl&#8208;substituents at C and alkyl&#8208;substituents at N.</dc:description>

In preparation process, SiO  x  nanosphere is used as a hard template. Etch time of SiO  x  yolk affects the morphology and electrochemical performance of SiO  x  @TiO  2  @C. With the increase in etch time, the yolk/double&#8208;shelled SiO  x  @TiO  2  @C with 15 and 30 nm voids and the TiO  2  @C hollow nanospheres are obtained. The yolk/double&#8208;shelled SiO  x  @TiO  2  @C nanospheres exhibit a remarkable lithium&#8211;ion batteries&#8217; performance as anodes, including high lithium storage capacity, outstanding rate capability, good reversibility, and stable long&#8208;term cycle life. The unique structure can accommodate the large volume change of the SiO  x  yolk, provide a unique buffering space for the discharge/charge processes, improve the structural stability of the electrode material during repeated Li  +  intercalation/deintercalation processes, and enhance the cycling stability. The SiO  x  @TiO  2  @C with 30 nm void space exhibits a high discharge specific capacity of ~1195.4 mA h g  &#8722;1  at the current density of 0.1 A g  &#8722;1  after 300 cycles and ~701.1 mA h g  &#8722;1  at 1 A g  &#8722;1  for over 800&#160;cycles. &#160; These results suggest that the proposed particle architecture is promising and may have potential applications in improving various high performance anode materials.</dc:description>

      <title>Luminescent Bimetallic IrIII/AuI Peptide Bioconjugates as Potential Theranostic Agents</title>
      <dc:description>
Iridium/gold bimetallic peptide bioconjugates are presented as a new source of theranostic agents. This work provides crucial insight into the factors that contribute to anti&#8208;proliferative activity of generally toxic metal fragments in bioconjugates. While chemical tools and reactions exist to link metal fragments to selected sites in peptides almost at will, the exact choice of linker and the resulting coordination environment crucially contribute to the overall activity of the conjugate. More information can be found in the Full Paper by V.&#8197;Fern&#225;ndez&#8208;Moreira, N.&#8197;Metzler&#8208;Nolte, M.&#8197;C.&#8197;Gimeno, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202002067).

      <title>Electron&#8208;Rich Phenothiazine Congeners and Beyond: Synthesis and Electronic Properties of Isomeric Dithieno[1,4]thiazines</title>
      <dc:description>
Structure&#8211;property relationships: Four isomeric dithieno[1,4]thiazines, thieno congeners of phenothiazines, are synthesized by inter&#8208;intra&#8208;molecular Buchwald&#8211;Hartwig coupling. Their electronic properties open new avenues as donor systems for molecular electronics.







Abstract
A series of isomeric dithieno[1,4]thiazines is accessible through an intermolecular&#8211;intramolecular Buchwald&#8211;Hartwig amination starting from dihalodithienyl sulfides. The electronic properties of dithieno[1,4]thiazine isomers differ conspicuously over a broad range depending on the thiophene&#8211;thiazine anellation: a large cathodic (340&#8197;mV) or an anodic shift (130&#8197;mV) of the redox potentials relative to corresponding phenothiazines is possible. Structure&#8211;property relationships of the dithieno[1,4]thiazine constitution derived from DFT calculations and cyclic voltammetry not only reveal increased electron density but also different delocalization of the radical cations that determines the electrochemical properties significantly. In addition, photophysical properties (absorption and emission) qualify dithieno[1,4]thiazines as promising substitutes of phenothiazine and beyond due to increased tunable electron richness.

      <title>A Novel Peptide Stapling Strategy with Built&#8208;in Fluorescence via Direct Late&#8208;stage C(sp2)&#8208;H Olefination of Tryptophan</title>
      <dc:description>Fluorescent stapled peptides are important chemical tools for detecting intracellular distribution, protein/protein interactions and localization of target proteins. These peptides are usually labelled with bulky&#8208;sized fluorophores through reactive functional groups, which may alter the physical properties and biological activities of peptides.

This method displays good regioselectivity and high efficiency. Furthermore, as a proof of concept for its biological applications, stapled peptides without additional fluorophore 9a and 9b were constructed for cell imaging study. These peptides displayed strong binding affinity toward integrin &#945;v&#946;3 in A549 cells by cell imaging experiments.

      <title>Metal&#8208;free Twofold Electrochemical C&#8208;H Amination of Activated Arenes: Application to Medicinally Relevant Precursor Synthesis</title>
      <dc:description>The efficient production of many medicinally or synthetically important starting materials suffers from wasteful or toxic precursors for the synthesis. In particular, the aromatic non&#8208;protected primary amine function represents a versatile synthetic precursor, but its synthesis typically requires toxic oxidizing agents and transition metal catalysts. The twofold electrochemical amination of activated benzene derivatives via Zincke intermediates provides an alternative sustainable strategy for the formation of new C&#8211;N bonds of high synthetic value. As a proof of concept, we use our approach to generate a benzoxazinone scaffold that gained attention as a starting structure against castrate&#8208;resistance prostate cancer. Further improvement of the structure led to significantly increased cancer cell line toxicity. Thus, exploiting environmentally benign electrooxidation, we present a new versatile and powerful method based on direct C&#8211;H activation that is applicable for e.g. the production of medicinally relevant compounds.</dc:description>

Thus, exploiting environmentally benign electrooxidation, we present a new versatile and powerful method based on direct C&#8211;H activation that is applicable for e.g. the production of medicinally relevant compounds.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>A Unified Framework for Understanding Nucleophilicity and Protophilicity in the SN2/E2 Competition</title>
      <dc:description>The concepts of nucleophilicity and protophilicity are fundamental and ubiquitous in chemistry. A case in point is bimolecular nucleophilic substitution (SN2) and base&#8208;induced elimination (E2). A Lewis base acting as a strong nucleophile is needed for SN2 reactions, while Lewis base acting as a strong protophile (i.e.&#160;base) is required for E2 reactions. A complicating factor is, however, the fact that a good nucleophile is often a strong protophile. Nevertheless, a sound, physical model that explains, in a transparent manner, when an electron&#8208;rich Lewis base acts as a protophile or a nucleophile, that is not just phenomenological, is currently lacking in the literature. To address this fundamental question, we have explored the potential energy surfaces of the SN2 and E2 reactions of X&#8211;&#160;+ C2H5Y model systems with X, Y = F, Cl, Br, I, and At, using relativistic density functional theory at ZORA&#8208;OLYP/TZ2P. These explorations have yielded a consistent overview of reactivity trends over a wide range in reactivity and pathways. Activation strain analyses of these reactions reveal the factors that determine the shape of the potential energy surfaces and hence govern the propensity of the Lewis base to act as a nucleophile or protophile. We introduce the concepts of "characteristic distortivity" and "transition state acidity" of a reaction, which have the potential to enable chemists to better understand and design reactions for&#160;synthesis.</dc:description>

      <title>EBC&#8208;232 and 323: A Structural Conundrum Necessitating Unification of Five In Silico Prediction and Elucidation Methods
</title>
      <dc:description>
Solve me if you can: Structurally unique halimanes EBC&#8208;232 and 323 invoked deployment of no less than 4 in silico NMR elucidation and prediction methods to arrive at two structures that also met chemical observations of interconversion.







Abstract
Structurally unique halimanes EBC&#8208;232 and EBC&#8208;323, isolated from the Australian rainforest plant Croton insularis, proved considerably difficult to elucidate. The two diastereomers, which consist an unusual oxo&#8208;6,7&#8208;spiro ring system fused to a dihydrofuran, were solved by unification and consultation of five in silico NMR elucidation and prediction methods [i.e., ACDLabs, olefin strain energy (OSE), DP4, DU8+ and TD DFT CD]. Structure elucidation challenges of this nature are prime test case examples for empowering future AI learning in structure elucidation.

      <title>Three&#8208;dimensional Cubic and Dice&#8208;like Microstructures of Higher Fullerene C78 with Enhanced Photoelectrochemical and Photoluminescence Properties</title>
      <dc:description>The single&#8208;crystal micro/nanostructures of fullerene species, namely C  60  and C  70  , have been previously studied, but studies on the morphology and properties of higher fullerenes have rarely been reported due to the limited amount of samples and their ellipsoidal isomeric structures. Herein, we report the formation of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) micro&#8208;cubes and micro&#8208;dice of a higher fullerene (C  78  ) via a facile liquid&#8208;liquid interfacial precipitation (LLIP) method. The micro&#8208;cubes were prepared by regulating the concentration of C  78  in trimethylbenzene (TMB) and the volume ratio of TMB and isopropanol. A simple handshaking process transformed the micro&#8208;cubes into micro&#8208;dice with an open&#8208;hole on each crystal face. X&#8208;ray diffraction and Fourier&#8208;transform infrared spectroscopic studies revealed a simple cubic unit cell with a lattice constant of 10.6 &#197; and intercalated TMB molecules in both crystals. The C  78  cubic and dice&#8208;like microstructures exhibited enhanced photoelectrochemical and photoluminescence properties compared with pristine C  78  powder, indicating their potential applications as photodetectors and photoelectric devices.</dc:description>

      <title>Hierarchical carbon nanowires/Ni@MnO2 nanocomposites for high&#8208;performance asymmetric supercapacitors</title>
      <dc:description>In this work, a rational 3D hierarchical carbon cloth/nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon nanowires/Ni@MnO  2  (CC/N&#8208;CNWs/Ni@MnO  2  ) nanocomposite electrode is successfully designed and prepared by electrodeposition. The   N&#8208;C nanowire  s derived from polypyrrole (PPy) nanowires on the carbon cloth possess open framework structure, which greatly increases the contact area between the electrode and electrolyte and provides short diffusion paths. The incorporation of the Ni layer between the N&#8208;CNWs and MnO  2  is beneficial for significantly enhancing the electrical conductivity and boosting the fast charge transfer as well as improving the charge&#8208;collection capacity. Thus, the as&#8208;prepared 3D hierarchical CC/N&#8208;CNWs/Ni@MnO  2  electrode exhibits a higher specific capacitance of 571.4 F g  &#8208;1  compared with those of CC/N&#8208;CNWs@MnO  2  (311  F g  &#8208;1  ), CC/Ni@MnO  2  (196.6 F g  &#8208;1  ) and CC@MnO  2  (186.1 F g  &#8208;1  ) at 1 A g  &#8208;1  and remarkable rate capability (367.5 F g  &#8208;1  at 10 A g  &#8208;1  ). Moreover, the asymmetric supercapacitors constructed using CC/N&#8208;CNWs/Ni@MnO  2  as a cathode material and activated carbon (AC) as an anode material deliver an impressive energy density of 36.4 Wh kg  &#8208;1  at the power density of 900 W kg  &#8208;1  and a good cycling life (72.8% capacitance retention after 3500 cycles). This study paves a low&#8208;cost and simple way to design a hierarchical nanocomposite electrode with large surface area and superior electrical conductivity, which holds a wide application prospect in high&#8208;performance supercapacitors.</dc:description>

      <title>From Distinct Metallopeptoids to Self&#8208;Assembled Supramolecular Architectures</title>
      <dc:description>The construction of synthetic protein mimics is a central goal in chemistry, that can be addressed by the self&#8208;assembly of synthetic biomimetic sequences into supramolecular structures. Obtaining different 3D structures via a simple sequence modification, however, is still challenging. Herein we present the design and synthesis of biomimetic architectures ,  via  the self&#8208;assembly of distinct copper&#8208;peptoid duplexes. We demonstrate that changing only one non&#8208;coordinating side&#8208;chain within peptoids &#8211; sequence&#8208;specific N&#8208;substituted glycine oligomers &#8211; leads to different supramolecular structures. Four peptoid trimers incorporating 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine and pyridine ligands, and a non&#8208;coordinating, but rather a structure&#8208;directed bulky group were synthesized, and their solutions were treated with Cu  2+  in a 1:1 ratio. Single crystal X&#8208;ray analysis of the products revealed the self&#8208;assembly of each peptoid into a metallopeptoid duplex, followed by the self&#8208;assembly of multiple duplexes and their packing into a three&#8208;dimensional supramolecular architecture  via  hydrogen bonding and p &#8208; p interactions . Tuning the non&#8208;coordinating side&#8208;chain enables to regulate both the final structure being either a tightly packed helical rod or a nano&#8208;channel , and the pore width of the nano&#8208;channels. Importantly, all the metallopeptoids structures are stable in aqueous solution as verified by Cryo&#8208;TEM measurements and supported by UV&#8208;Vis and EPR spectroscopies and by ESI&#8208;MS analysis.

      <title>May Trifluoromethylation and Polymerization of Styrene Occur from a Perfluorinated Persistent Radical (PPFR)?</title>
      <dc:description>The radical polymerization of styrene (St) initiated by a trifluoromethyl radical generated from a perfluorinated highly branched persistent radical (PPFR) is presented with an isolated yield above 70%. The release of &#8226; CF3 radical occurred from temperature above 85 &#176;C. Deeper 1H and 19F nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopies of the resulting fluorinated polystyrenes (CF3&#8208;PSts) evidenced the presence of both CF3 end&#8208;group of the PSt chain and the trifluoromethylation of the phenyl ring (in meta position mainly). [PPFR]0/[St]0 initial molar ratios of 3/1, 3/10 and 3/100 led to various molar masses ranging from 1750 to 5400 g.mol&#8208;1 in 70&#8208;86% yields. MALDI&#8208;TOF spectrometry of such CF3&#8208;PSts highlighted polymeric distributions which evidenced differences between m/z fragments of 104 and 172 corresponding to styrene and trifluoromethyl styrene units, respectively. Such CF3&#8208;PSt polymers were also compared to conventional PSts produced from the radical polymerization of St initiated by a peroxydicarbonate initiator. A mechanism of the polymerization is presented showing the formation of a trifluoromethyl styrene first, followed by its radical (co)polymerization with styrene. The thermal properties (thermal stability and glass transition temperature, Tg) of these polymers were also compared and revealed a much better thermal stability of the CF3&#8208;PSt (10% weight loss at 356&#8208;376 &#176;C) and a Tg of around 70 &#176;C.</dc:description>

Deeper 1H and 19F nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopies of the resulting fluorinated polystyrenes (CF3&#8208;PSts) evidenced the presence of both CF3 end&#8208;group of the PSt chain and the trifluoromethylation of the phenyl ring (in meta position mainly). [PPFR]0/[St]0 initial molar ratios of 3/1, 3/10 and 3/100 led to various molar masses ranging from 1750 to 5400 g.mol&#8208;1 in 70&#8208;86% yields. MALDI&#8208;TOF spectrometry of such CF3&#8208;PSts highlighted polymeric distributions which evidenced differences between m/z fragments of 104 and 172 corresponding to styrene and trifluoromethyl styrene units, respectively. Such CF3&#8208;PSt polymers were also compared to conventional PSts produced from the radical polymerization of St initiated by a peroxydicarbonate initiator. A mechanism of the polymerization is presented showing the formation of a trifluoromethyl styrene first, followed by its radical (co)polymerization with styrene. The thermal properties (thermal stability and glass transition temperature, Tg) of these polymers were also compared and revealed a much better thermal stability of the CF3&#8208;PSt (10% weight loss at 356&#8208;376 &#176;C) and a Tg of around 70 &#176;C.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Supramolecular Paradigm for Capture and Co&#8208;Precipitation of Gold(III) Coordination Complexes</title>
      <dc:description>A new supramolecular paradigm is presented for reliable capture and co&#8208;precipitation of haloauric acids (HAuX  4  ) from organic solvents or water. Two classes of acyclic organic compounds act as complementary receptors (tectons) by forming two sets of directional non&#8208;covalent interactions, (a) hydrogen bonding between amide (or amidinium) NH residues and the electronegative X ligands on the AuX  4  &#8208;  , and (b) electrostatic stacking of the electron deficient Au center against the face of an aromatic surface. X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis of four co&#8208;crystal structures reveals the additional common feature of proton bridged carbonyls as a new and predictable supramolecular design element that creates one&#8208;dimensional polymers linked by very short hydrogen bonds (CO&#183;&#183;&#183;OC distance &lt; 2.5 &#197;). Two other co&#8208;crystal structures show that the amidinium&#8208;&#960;&#183;&#183;&#183;XAu interaction will reliably engage AuX  4  &#8208;  with high directionality. These acyclic compounds are very attractive as co&#8208;precipitation agents within new &#8220;green&#8221; gold recovery processes. They also have high potential as tectons for controlled self&#8208;assembly or co&#8208;crystal engineering of haloaurate composites.

      <title>Methylene Bridging Effect on the Structures, Lewis Acidities and Optical Properties of Semi&#8208;Planar Triarylboranes</title>
      <dc:description>Two straightforward synthetic methods towards semi&#8208;planar triarylboranes with two aryl rings connected by a methylene bridge have been developed. The fine&#8208;tuning of their stereoelectronic properties and Lewis acidities was achieved by introducing fluorine, methyl or methoxy groups either at their exocyclic or their bridged aryl rings.

Though the methylene bridge between the ortho&#8208;positions of two aryl rings of triarylboranes decreased the Gibbs free energies of complexation with small Lewis bases by less than 5 kJ mol&#8208;1  relative to the classical Lewis acid BAr3, the steric shielding of the CH2  bridge is sufficient to avoid the formation of Lewis adducts with larger Lewis bases such as triarylphosphines. A newly synthesized spirocyclic amino&#8208;borane with a long intramolecular B&#8208;N bond that could be dissociated under thermal process, UV&#8208;irradiation, or acidic conditions might be a potential candidate in Lewis pairs catalysis.</dc:description>

      <title>Divergent Synthesis of Bioactive Dithiodiketopiperazine Natural Products Based on a Double C(sp3)&#8211;H Activation Strategy</title>
      <dc:description>This article provides a detailed report of our efforts to synthesize the dithiodiketopiperazine (DTP) natural products (&#8211;)&#8208;epicoccin G and (&#8211;)&#8208;rostratin A using a double C(sp  3  )&#8211;H activation strategy. The strategy&#8217;s viability was first established on a model system lacking the C8/C8&#8217; alcohols. Then, an efficient stereoselective route including an organocatalytic epoxidation was secured to access a key bis&#8208;triflate substrate. This bis&#8208;triflate served as the functional handles for the key transformation of the synthesis: a double C(sp  3  )&#8211;H activation. The successful double activation opened access to a common intermediate for both natural products in high overall yield and on a multigram scale. After several unsuccessful attempts, this intermediate was efficiently converted to (&#8211;)&#8208;epicoccin G and to the more challenging (&#8211;)&#8208;rostratin A via suitable oxidation/reduction and protecting group sequences, and via a final sulfuration that occurred in good yield and high diastereoselectivity. These efforts culminated in the synthesis of (&#8211;)&#8208;epicoccin G and (&#8211;)&#8208;rostratin A in high overall yields (19.6% over 14 steps and 12.7% over 17 steps, respectively), with the latter being obtained on a 500 mg scale. Toxicity assessments of these natural products and several analogues (including the newly synthesized epicoccin K) in the leukemia cell line K562 confirmed the importance of the disulfide bridge for activity and identified dianhydrorostratin A as a 20x more potent analogue.</dc:description>

      <title>A simple method for synthesizing highly active amorphous iridium oxide for water&#8208;oxidation under acidic conditions</title>
      <dc:description>Water splitting for hydrogen production has been recognized as a promising approach to store sustainable energy. The performance of this method is limited by oxygen&#8208;evolution reaction. Herein, an approach for synthesizing a highly active oxygen&#8208;evolving catalyst with a one&#8208;step, low&#8208;cost, environmentally friendly, and easy&#8208;to&#8208;prepare method is presented, which works by operating metallic iridium as the anode electrode at a relatively high potential. The obtained  IrO  x  /Ir  interface showed an overpotential of 250 mV at 10 mA.cm  &#8208;2  in 0.1 M HClO  4  and remained stable under electrochemical conditions. The IrO  x  that was mechanically separated from the surface of metallic IrO  x  /Ir after the operation showed a threefold increase in the activity compared to the currently benchmarked IrO  2  catalyst. Various characterization analyses were used to identify the structure and morphology of the catalyst, which suggested a nanosized, porous, and amorphous IrO  x  on the surface of metallic Ir . The synthetic approach can inspire a variety of opportunities to design and synthesize the efficient metal oxide&#8208;based electrocatalysts for sustainable energy conversion and utilization.</dc:description>

      <title>Multidisciplinary Preclinical Investigations on Three Oxamniquine Analogues as Novel Drug Candidates for Schistosomiasis</title>
      <dc:description>Schistosomiasis is a disease of poverty affecting millions of people. Praziquantel (PZQ), with its strengths and weaknesses, is the only treatment available. We previously reported findings on 3 lead compounds derived from oxamniquine (OXA), an old antischistosomal drug: ferrocene&#8208;containing (Fc&#8208;CH  2  &#8208;OXA), ruthenocene&#8208;containing (Rc&#8208;CH  2  &#8208;OXA) and benzene&#8208;containing (Ph&#8208;CH  2  &#8208;OXA) OXA derivatives. These derivatives showed excellent  in vitro  activity against both  Schistosoma mansoni  larvae and adult worms and  S. haematobium  adult worms, and  in vivo  activity against  S. mansoni  . Encouraged by these promising results, we conducted additional in&#8208;depth preclinical studies and report in this investigation on metabolic stability studies,  in vivo  studies on  S. haematobium  and juvenile  S. mansoni  , computational simulations, and formulation development. Molecular dynamics simulations supported the  in vitro  results on the target protein. Though all three compounds were poorly stable within an acidic environment, they were only slightly cleared in the  in vitro  liver model. This is likely the reason as to why the promising  in vitro  activity did not translate to  in vivo  activity on  S. haematobium  . This limitation could not be saved by the formulation of lipid nanocapsules as an intent to improve the  in vivo  activity. Further studies should focus on increasing the compound&#8217;s bioavailability, in order to reach an active concentration in the parasite&#8217;s microenvironment.</dc:description>

      <title>Solid&#8208;state properties of hexaazatriphenylenehexacarbonitrile HAT(CN)6&#183;&#8722; radical anions in crystalline salts containing cryptand(M+) and crystal violet cations.</title>

The solid&#8208;state molecular structure as well as the optical and magnetic properties of HAT(CN)6&#183;&#8722;  are studied. The formation of HAT(CN)6&#183;&#8722;  in  1&#8211;4  leads to the appearance of new bands in the visible range&#160;at 694 and 740 nm. The HAT(CN)6&#183;&#8722;  radical anions have spin state  S  = 1/2 and are packed in one&#8208;dimensional stacks containing the {HAT(CN)6&#183;&#8722;}2  dimers alternated with weaker interacting pairs of HAT(CN)6&#183;&#8722;  in  1  and nearly isolated &#160;{HAT(CN)  6&#183;&#8722;}2  dimers in  2. The {HAT(CN)  6&#183;&#8722;}2  dimers are diamagnetic in  1&#160;but they effectively mediate one&#8208;dimensional antiferromagnetic coupling of spins within the stacks with median exchange interaction of  J/kB  = &#8722;80\K. The&#160;behavior of salt  2  is described by a singlet&#8211;triplet model for the {HAT(CN)6&#183;&#8722;}2  dimers with an energy gap of 434&#177;7 K.&#160; Salts  3  and  4  contain isolated stacks of alternated HAT(CN)6&#183;&#8722;  and CV+  ions, and in this case, nearly paramagnetic behaviour is observed with Weiss temperatures of &#8722;1 and &#8722;7K. Narrow Lorentzian EPR signals with  g=2.0033&#8211;2.0039 were found for HAT(CN)6&#183;&#8722;&#160;but&#160;g  &#8208;factor shifts to 1.9964 in solution. The electronic structure of HAT(CN)6&#183;&#8722;  is analyzed, showing a Jahn&#8211;Teller distortion of the radical anion that reduces the symmetry from  D3h  to  Cs  and splits the initially degenerated LUMOs.</dc:description>

      <title>Electrochemical Reduction of CO2 at Coinage Metal Nanodendrites in Aqueous Ethanolamine</title>
      <dc:description>Electrocatalytic reduction of CO  2  into usable chemicals is a promising path to address climate change and energy challenges. Herein, we demonstrate to synthesize of unique coinage metal (Cu, Ag and Au) nanodendrites (NDs) via a facile galvanic replacement reaction (GRR) process as the effective electrocatalysts for the reduction of CO  2  in the ethanolamine (EA) solution. Each metal ND surface was directly grown on glassy carbon (GC) substrates from the mixture of Zn dust and the respective precursor solution. The electrocatalytic activities of the synthesized ND surfaces&#160; were optimized for CO  2  reduction in the EA solution by varying their composition. It was determined that a 0.05 mole fraction of EA exhibited the highest catalytic activity for all of the metal NDs. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) techniques showed that metal NDs electrodes possessed higher current densities, low onset potentials and low charge&#8208;transfer resistances for CO  2  reduction as compared to their smooth polycrystalline electrode counterparts, indicating improved&#160; CO  2  reduction catalytic activity.. It was determined, using FTIR and NMR spectroscopy, that formate was produced as a result of the CO2 reduction.</dc:description>

      <title>Phosphorescent trinuclear Pt&#8208;Ir&#8208;Pt complexes: Insight into photophysical, electrochemical properties and interaction with guanine nucleobase</title>
      <dc:description>In this work, we focus on the comparative photophysical and electrochemical properties of two isomeric heterotrinuclear platinum(II)&#8208;iridium(III)&#8208;platinum(II) complexes (3, 6) and&#160; four intermediate isomeric homonuclear cyclometalated iridium(III) complexes (1 &#8208; 2, 4 &#8208; 5). The isomerisation originates from the positional change of aldehyde moiety, CH  2  &#8208;di&#8208;2&#8208;picolylamine and Pt&#8208;di&#8208;2&#8208;picolylamine unit that remain appended at cyclometalated or ancillary ligand end. The interaction with 5&#8242;&#8208;GMP with trinuclear complexes 3 and 6 shows that platinum centres appended with cyclometalated ligand in 3 facilitates the binding of two 5&#8242;&#8208;GMP unit/Pt(II) centre in preference to single unit/Pt(II) centre in 6. The 1:2 vs. 1:1 (Pt(II):5&#8217;&#8208;GMP) binding is probably due to the convenient disposal of Pt&#8208;di&#8208;2&#8208;picolylamine unit towards different planes in 3.</dc:description>

      <title>Synthesis and optimization of zeolitic imidazolate frameworks for oxygen evolution reaction</title>
      <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic frameworks/Zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (MOFs/ZIFs) and their post&#8208;synthesis modified nanostructures, such as oxides, hydroxides and carbons have generated significant interest for electrocatalytic reactions. In this work, we report a high and durable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance from bimetallic Zn100&#8208;xCox&#8208;ZIF samples directly, without carrying out high&#8208;temperature calcination and/or carbonization. ZIFs can be reproducibly and readily synthesized in large scale at ambient conditions. The bimetallic ZIFs show a systematic and gradually improved OER activity with increasing cobalt concentration. A further increase in OER activity is evidenced in ZIF&#8208;67 polyhedrons with controlled particle size of &lt;200 nm among samples of different sizes between 50 nm and 2 &#181;m. Building on this, a significantly enhanced, &gt;50%, OER activity is obtained in ZIF&#8208;67/carbon black, which shows a low&#8208;overpotential of ~320 mV in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte. Such activity is comparable or better to numerous MOFs/ZIFs derived electrocatalysts. The optimized ZIF&#8208;67 sample also exhibits increased activity and durability over 24 h, which is attributed to in&#8208;situ developed active cobalt&#8208;oxide/oxyhydroxide related nanophase.</dc:description>

      <title>High Energy Proton Beam&#8208;Induced Polymerization/Oxygenation of Hydroxynaphthalenes on Meteorites and Nitrogen Transfer from Urea: Modeling Insoluble Organic Matter?</title>
      <dc:description>Formation and structural modification of oxygenated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (oxyPAHs) by UV irradiation on minerals have recently been proposed as a possible channel of PAH transformation in astrochemical and prebiotic scenarios of possible relevance for the origin of life. Herein, we demonstrate that high energy proton beam irradiation in the presence of various meteorites, including stony iron, achondrite, and chondrite type, promotes the conversion of two representative oxyPAH compounds, 1&#8208;naphthol (1&#8208;HN) and 1,8&#8208;dihydroxynaphthalene (1,8&#8208;DHN), into complex mixtures of oxygenated and oligomeric derivatives. Main identified products include polyhydroxy derivatives, isomeric dimers encompassing benzofuran and benzopyran scaffolds, and, notably, a range of quinones and perylene derivatives. Addition of urea, a prebiotically&#8208;relevant chemical precursor, expanded the range of identified species to include, among others, quinone diimines. Proton beam irradiation of oxyPAH, as modulated by nitrogen containing compound like urea, is proposed as a possible contributory mechanism for the formation and processing of insoluble organic matter (IOM) in meteorites and in prebiotic processes</dc:description>

      <title>Allosteric control of naphthalene diimide encapsulation and electron transfer in porphyrin containers: photophysical studies and molecular dynamics simulation</title>
      <dc:description>The complexation processes of N,N&#8217;&#8208;dibutyl&#8208;1,4,5,8&#8208;naphthalene diimide (NDI) into two types of &#960;&#8208;electron&#8208;rich molecular containers consisting of two Zn(II)&#8208;porphyrins connected by four flexible linkers of two different lengths, were characterized by means of absorption and emission spectroscopies and molecular dynamics simulation. Noteworthy, the addition of NDI leads to a strong quenching of the fluorescence of both cages only when they are in an open conformation suitable for guest encapsulation, a situation triggered by silver(I) ions binding to the lateral triazoles. Molecular dynamics simulations confirm the fast binding of NDI, likely assisted by NDI&#8208;silver(I) interactions. Upon NDI complexation, the two porphyrin macrocycles get closer, with an optimized face to face orientation, suggesting an induced&#8208;fit mechanism through &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions with the NDI aromatic cycle. Ultrafast transient absorption experiments allowed to identify the process of quenching of the Zn&#8208;porphyrin fluorescence as an efficient photoinduced electron transfer reaction between the cage porphyrin and the included NDI guest. The process occurs on fast and ultrafast time scales in the two complexes (1.5 ps and &#8804; 300 fs) leading to a short&#8208;lived charge separated state (charge recombination lifetimes in the order of 30&#8208;40 ps). The combined computational and experimental approach used here is able to furnish a reliable model of the NDI&#8208;cage complexation mechanism and of the corresponding electron transfer reaction, attesting the allosteric control of both processes by the silver(I) ions.</dc:description>

      <title>Enhanced Macroanion Recognition of Superchaotropic Keggin Clusters Achieved by Synergy of Anion&#8208;&#960; Interaction and Anion&#8208;Cation Interaction</title>
      <dc:description>Keggin clusters are the most widely used polyoxomatales building blocks for construction advanced materials, while effective methods of precisely recognizing the isostructural analogues of Keggins are still limited. Here we applied zwitterionic molecule 4,4'&#8208;dipyridyl&#8208;N,N'&#8208;dioxide (dpdo) as a recognition receptor to specifically bind with the three Keggin analogues, PW12O403&#8208;, PMo12O403&#8208; and SiW12O404&#8208;, which co&#8208;assembled into three groups of spherical charged colloids with different sizes, separately. The recognition phenomena were further confirmed by electrochemistry study and crystallization behaviors. Compared with sole anion&#8208;cation interaction driven systems, the synergism from anion&#8208;&#960; adsorption between the superchaotropic Keggins and the electro&#8208;deficient pyridine rings is believed to enhance the recognition phenomenon. The observation is intriguing as the long&#8208;range solution assembly of Keggins is mainly driven by the short&#8208;range anion&#8208;&#960; interaction. Our results show that the little&#8208;noticed hydration shell of Keggins was significantly influenced by the superchaotropic effect, leading to differentiated binding affinity to the receptors and more obvious recognition phenomena between W/Mo Keggin analogues.</dc:description>

      <title>Controlling the number of branches and surface facets of Pd&#8208;core Ru&#8208;branched nanoparticles to make highly active oxygen evolution reaction electrocatalysts</title>
      <dc:description>Producing stable but active materials is one of the enduring challenges in electrocatalysis and other types of catalysis. Producing branched nanoparticles is one potential solution. Controlling the number of branches and branch size of faceted branched nanoparticles is one of the major synthetic challenges to achieve highly active and stable nanocatalysts. Herein, we use cubic&#8208;core hexagonal&#8208;branch mechanism to synthesize branched Ru nanoparticles with control over the size and number of branches. This structural control is the key to achieving high exposure of active {10&#8208;11} facets and optimum number of Ru branches that enables improved catalytic activity for oxygen evolution reaction while maintaining high stability.</dc:description>

Herein, we use cubic&#8208;core hexagonal&#8208;branch mechanism to synthesize branched Ru nanoparticles with control over the size and number of branches. This structural control is the key to achieving high exposure of active {10&#8208;11} facets and optimum number of Ru branches that enables improved catalytic activity for oxygen evolution reaction while maintaining high stability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional NiIr@N&#8208;Doped Carbon Nanocomposites Supported on Ni Foam for Electrocatalytic Overall Water Splitting</title>

Highly efficient electrocatalysts toward hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are extremely important for the practical application of water splitting technology. Here we report a one&#8208;step annealing strategy for the fabrication of a metal&#8208;organic framework&#8208;derived bifunctional self&#8208;supported electrocatalyst, which is composed of two&#8208;dimensional N&#8208;doped carbon&#8208;wrapped Ir&#8208;doped Ni nanoparticle composites supported on Ni foam (NiIr@N&#8208;C/NF). The resultant NiIr@N&#8208;C/NF displays excellent electrocatalytic performance in 1.0 M KOH, with low overpotentials of 32 mV at 10 mA cm  &#8208;2  for HER and 329 mV at 50 mA cm  &#8208;2  for OER. Particularly, the HER&#8208;OER bifunctional NiIr@N&#8208;C/NF needs only 1.50 V to yield 10 mA cm  &#8208;2  for overall water splitting.</dc:description>

      <title>Sequence Decoding of 1D to 2D Self&#8208;Assembling Cyclic Peptides</title>
      <dc:description>The inherent ability of peptides to self&#8208;assemble with directional and rationally predictable interactions has fostered a plethora of synthetic two&#8208;dimensional (2D) supramolecular biomaterials. However, the design of peptides with hierarchical assembly in different dimensions across mesoscopic lengths remains a challenging task. We here describe the structural exploration of a D/L&#8208;alternating cyclic octapeptide capable of assembling one&#8208;dimensional (1D) nanotubes in water, which subsequently pack laterally to form giant 2D nanosheets up to 500 &#181;m long with a constant 3.2 nm thickness. Specific amino acid mutations allowed the mapping of structure&#8208;assembly relationships that determine 2D self&#8208;assembly. Nine peptide modifications were studied, revealing key features in the peptide sequence that nanosheets tolerated, while a total of three peptide variants included modifications that compromised their 2D arrangement. These lessons will serve as guide and inspiration for new 2D supramolecular peptide designs.</dc:description>
