         <title>Supramolecular Sequential Light&#8208;Harvesting Systems for Constructing White LED Device and Latent Fingerprint Imaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The fabrication of supramolecular light&#8208;harvesting systems (LHS) with sequential energy transfer is of significance in utilizing light energy. In this study, we report the non&#8208;covalent self&#8208;assembly of a sequential LHS by pillar[5]arene&#8208;based host&#8208;guest interaction in water and its applications in white light&#8208;emitting diode (LED) device and latent fingerprint imaging. The host&#8208;guest complex WP5&#11815;G self&#8208;assembles into nanoparticles in water and shows enhanced aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) effect. The nanoparticles can be further used to construct sequential LHS with fluorescent dyes 4,7&#8208;di(2&#8208;thienyl)&#8208;benzo[2,1,3]thiadiazole (DBT) and sulforhodamine 101 (SR101). Impressively, the system shows white&#8208;light emission when the molar ratio of WP5&#11815;G/DBT/SR101 is 1100/2/16. The material can be coated on a LED bulb to achieve white&#8208;light emission. In addition, the sequential LHS exhibit color&#8208;tunable fluorescence including red emission, which have been successfully applied to high&#8208;resolution imaging of latent fingerprints. Therefore, we demonstrated a general strategy for the construction of sequential LHS in water based on macrocyclic host&#8208;guest interaction and explored its multi&#8208;functional applications in white&#8208;light LED device and imaging of latent fingerprints, which will promote future development and application of supramolecular LHSs.</dc:description>

         <title>A Novel Approach of Electrocatalytic Deamination from Aromatic Amide to Diarylimide on Ni&#8208;PTFE Modified Electrode</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A hydrophobic Ni&#8208;PTFE modified electrode has been prepared by constant current and cathodic electroplating with a nickel sheet as substrate in a PTFE suspension. Then the Ni&#8208;PTFE modified electrode was used for electroreduction from aromatic amide to diarylimide. The electrochemical characterizations such as cyclic voltammogram, EIS, polarization curves, and electrode stability have been carried out by electrochemical workstation. The structure of the electroreduction product diarylimide was characterized by 1HNMR, FT&#8208;IR, MS(Mass Spectrum), and EA(Elemental Analyzer). Based on the hydrophobicity of the electrode, an approach suggested that the phenyl ketone radical may be formed by electroreductive deamination at the cathode. With the construction of C&#8208;N bond by the radical coupling, the electrocatalytic reduction may be comprised of a one&#8208;electron process including an ECC (Electrochemical&#8208;Chemical&#8208;Chemical) process. The electroreduction of aromatic amide to diarylimide may be controlled by both charge migration and concentration polarization. Electrocatalytic reduction of aromatic amides on Ni&#8208;PTFE&#8208;modified electrodes is all well conversion ratio.</dc:description>

         <title>Cleaving Folded RNA by Multifunctional DNAzyme Nanomachines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Both tight and specific binding of folded biological mRNA is required for gene silencing by oligonucleotide gene therapy agents. However, this is fundamentally impossible using the conventional oligonucleotide probes according to the affinity/specificity dilemma. This study addresses this problem by using multicomponent agents (dubbed &#8216;DNA nanomachine&#8217; or DNM) for RNA binding. DNMs bind RNA by four short RNA binding arms, which ensures tight and highly selective RNA binding. Along with the improved affinity, DNM maintained the high sequence selectivity of the conventional DNAzymes. DNM enabled up to 3&#8208;fold improvement in DNAzymes catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) by facilitating both RNA substrate binding and product release steps of the catalytic cycle. This study demonstrates that multicomponent probes organized in sophisticated structures can help to achieve the balance between affinity and selectivity in recognizing folded RNA and thus creates a foundation for applying complex DNA nanostructures in gene therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Backbone Modification in a Protein Hydrophobic Core</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Targeted protein backbone modification can recreate tertiary structures reminiscent of folds found in nature on artificial scaffolds with improved biostability. Incorporation of altered monomers in such entities is typically limited to sites distant from the hydrophobic core to avoid potential disruptions to folding. This is limiting, as it is advantageous in some applications to incorporate artificial connectivity at buried sites. Here, we report an examination of protein backbone modification targeted specifically to hydrophobic core positions and its impacts on tertiary folded structure and fold stability. Different artificial monomer types are placed at core, core&#8208;flanking, or solvent&#8208;exposed positions in a compact three&#8208;helix protein. Effects on structure and folding energetics are assessed by NMR spectroscopy and biophysical methods. Results show that artificial residues can be well accommodated in the hydrophobic core of a defined tertiary fold, with effects on stability only modestly larger than identical changes at solvent&#8208;exposed sites. Collectively, these results provide new insights into folding behavior of protein&#8208;like artificial chains as well as strategies for the design of such molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Rational Design of Coumarin&#8208;Based Hybridized Local and Charge&#8208;Transfer Blue Emitters for Solution&#8208;Processed Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hybridized local and charge&#8208;transfer (HLCT) with the utilization of both singlet and triplet excitons through the "hot excitons" channel have great application potential in highly efficient blue organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). The proportion of charge&#8208;transfer (CT) and locally excited (LE) components in the relevant singlet and triplet states makes a big difference for the high&#8208;lying reverse intersystem crossing process. Herein, three novel donor (D)&#8208;acceptor (A) type HLCT materials, 7&#8208;([1,1'&#8208;biphenyl]&#8208;4&#8208;yl(9,9&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;9H&#8208;fluoren&#8208;2&#8208;yl)amino)&#8208;3&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1H&#8208;isochromen&#8208;1&#8208;one (pPh&#8208;7P), 7&#8208;([1,1'&#8208;biphenyl]&#8208;4&#8208;yl(9,9&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;9H&#8208;fluoren&#8208;2&#8208;yl)amino)&#8208;3&#8208;methyl&#8208;1H&#8208;isochromen&#8208;1&#8208;one (pPh&#8208;7M), and 6&#8208;([1,1'&#8208;biphenyl]&#8208;4&#8208;yl(9,9&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;9H&#8208;fluoren&#8208;2&#8208;yl)amino)&#8208;3&#8208;methyl&#8208;1H&#8208;isochromen&#8208;1&#8208;one (pPh&#8208;6M), were rationally designed and synthesized with diphenylamine derivative as donor and oxygen heterocyclic coumarin moiety as acceptors. The proportions of CT and LE components were fine controlled by changing the connection site of diphenylamine derivative at C6/C7&#8208;position and the substituent at C3&#8208;position of coumarin moiety. The HLCT characteristics of pPh&#8208;7P, pPh&#8208;7M, and pPh&#8208;6M were systematically demonstrated through photophysical properties and density functional theory calculations. The solution&#8208;processed doped OLEDs based on pPh&#8208;6M exhibited deep&#8208;blue electroluminescence with the maximum emission wavelength of 446 nm, maximum luminance of 8755 cd m&#8208;2, maximum current efficiency of 5.83 cd A&#8208;1, and maximum external quantum efficiency of 6.54%. The results reveal that pPh&#8208;6M with dominant 1LE and 3CT components has better OLED performance.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Hybridized local and charge-transfer (HLCT) with the utilization of both singlet and triplet excitons through the "hot excitons" channel have great application potential in highly efficient blue organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs). The proportion of charge-transfer (CT) and locally excited (LE) components in the relevant singlet and triplet states makes a big difference for the high-lying reverse intersystem crossing process. Herein, three novel donor (D)-acceptor (A) type HLCT materials, 7-([1,1'-biphenyl]-4-yl(9,9-dimethyl-9H-fluoren-2-yl)amino)-3-phenyl-1H-isochromen-1-one (pPh-7P), 7-([1,1'-biphenyl]-4-yl(9,9-dimethyl-9H-fluoren-2-yl)amino)-3-methyl-1H-isochromen-1-one (pPh-7M), and 6-([1,1'-biphenyl]-4-yl(9,9-dimethyl-9H-fluoren-2-yl)amino)-3-methyl-1H-isochromen-1-one (pPh-6M), were rationally designed and synthesized with diphenylamine derivative as donor and oxygen heterocyclic coumarin moiety as acceptors. The proportions of CT and LE components were fine controlled by changing the connection site of diphenylamine derivative at C6/C7-position and the substituent at C3-position of coumarin moiety. The HLCT characteristics of pPh-7P, pPh-7M, and pPh-6M were systematically demonstrated through photophysical properties and density functional theory calculations. The solution-processed doped OLEDs based on pPh-6M exhibited deep-blue electroluminescence with the maximum emission wavelength of 446 nm, maximum luminance of 8755 cd m-2, maximum current efficiency of 5.83 cd A-1, and maximum external quantum efficiency of 6.54%. The results reveal that pPh-6M with dominant 1LE and 3CT components has better OLED performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enhanced Low&#8208;Temperature Resistance of Lithium&#8208;metal Rechargeable Batteries Based on Electrolyte Including Ethyl Acetate and LiDFOB Additives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To meet the demand for higher energy density in lithium&#8208;ion batteries and expand their application range, coupling lithium metal anodes with high&#8208;voltage cathodes is an ideal solution. However, the compatibility between lithium metal batteries and electrolytes affects their applicability. In this study, proposes a locally concentrated electrolyte based on ethyl acetate (EA) as the solvent, lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) as the lithium salt, and lithium difluorooxoborate (LiDFOB) as a sacrificial agent to enhance the low&#8208;temperature and high&#8208;voltage endurance of Li//Lithium cobalt oxide (LCO) batteries. The Li//LCO battery can operate within the voltage range of 3 to 4.5 V, with an initial discharge specific capacity of 174.5 mAh g&#8208;1 at 20 oC. At &#8208;40 oC, after 200 cycles, the capacity retention rate is 87.7%. It can operate under extreme conditions of &#8208;70 oC, with a discharge specific capacity of 112.6 mAh g&#8208;1. Additionally, LCO//HC batteries using this electrolyte demonstrate excellent performance. Present work provides a new perspective for the optimization of electrolytes for low&#8208;temperature lithium&#8208;ion batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Rationalization of a Streptavidin Based Enantioselective Artificial Suzukiase: An Integrative Computational Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An Artificial Metalloenzyme (ArM) built employing the streptavidin&#8208;biotin technology has been used for the enantioselective synthesis of binaphthyls by means of asymmetric Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reactions. Despite its success, it remains a challenge to understand how the length of the biotin cofactors or the introduction of mutations to streptavidin leads the preferential synthesis of one atropisomer over the other. In this study, we apply an integrated computational modeling approach, including DFT calculations, protein&#8208;ligand dockings and molecular dynamics to rationalize the impact of mutations and length of the biotion cofactor on the enantioselectivities of the biaryl product. The results unravel that the enantiomeric differences found experimentally can be rationalized by the disposition of the first intermediate, coming from the oxidative addition step, and the entrance of the second substrate. The work also showcases the difficulties facing to control the enantioselection when engineering ArM to catalyze enantioselective Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura couplings and how the combination of DFT calculations, molecular dockings and MD simulations can be used to rationalize artificial metalloenzymes.</dc:description>

         <title>Nature Products Chlorophyll Derivatives for NIR&#8208;II Fluorescence Bioimaging and Plant&#8208;imaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The second near&#8208;infrared window (NIR&#8208;II, 1000 &#8208; 1700 nm) fluorescence imaging has attracted significant attention in research fields because of its unique advantages compared with conventional optical windows (400 &#8211; 900 nm). A variety of NIR&#8208;II fluorophores have been actively studied because they serve as a key component of fluorescence imaging. Among them, organic small molecule NIR&#8208;II fluorophores display outstanding imaging performance and many advantages, but types of small molecule NIR&#8208;II fluorophores with high biocompatibility are still quite limited. Novel molecular scaffolds based NIR&#8208;II dyes are highly desired. Herein, we hypothesized that chlorophyll is a new promising molecular platform for discovery NIR&#8208;II fluorophores. Thus, seven derivatives of derivatives were selected to characterize their optical properties. Interestingly, six chlorophyll derivatives displayed NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging capability. This characteristic allowed the successful NIR&#8208;II imaging of green leaves of various plants. Furthermore, most of these fluorophores showed capacity to monitor viscosity change because of their sensitive for viscosity. For demonstration of its biomedical applications, these probes were successfully used for NIR&#8208;II fluorescence&#8208;guided surgical resection of lymph nodes. In summary, chlorophylls are novel valuable tool molecules for NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging and have potential to expand their applications in biomedical field and plant science.</dc:description>

         <title>Polydentate Amidinato&#8208;Silylenes, &#8208;Germylenes and &#8208;Stannylenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review article classifies the title compounds into families that differ in the position(s) of the donor group(s) D on the corresponding amidinatotetrylene moiety (E=Si, Ge, Sn), schematically presents the structures of the members of each family, and describes the synthetic approaches utilized for their preparation and their use as ligands in transition metal&#8208;catalysed reactions.







Abstract
This review article focuses on amidinatotetrylenes that potentially can (or have already shown to) behave as bi&#8208; or tridentate ligands because they contain at least one amidinatotetrylene moiety (silylene, germylene or stannylene) and one (or more) additional coordinable fragment(s). Currently, they are being widely used as ligands in coordination chemistry, small molecule activation and catalysis. This review classifies those that have been isolated as transition metal&#8208;free compounds into five families that differ in the position(s) of the donor group(s) (D) on the amidinatotetrylene moiety, namely: ED{R1NC(R2)NR1}, EX{DNC(R2)NR1}, EX{R1NC(D)NR1}, EX{DNC(R2)ND} and E{R1NC(R2)ND}2 (E=Si, Ge or Sn). Those that do not exist as transition metal&#8208;free compounds but have been observed as ligands in transition metal complexes are cyclometallated and ring&#8208;opened amidinatotetrylene ligands. This article presents schematic descriptions of their structures, the approaches used for their syntheses and a quick overview of their involvement (as ligands) in transition metal&#8208;catalysed reactions. The literature is covered up to the end of 2023.

         <title>Elucidating the Binding Mode of Sulfur&#8208; and Selenium&#8208;Based Cationic Chalcogen&#8208;Bond Donors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The noncovalent interaction modes of 2&#8208;chalcogeno&#8208;imidazolium salts have been studied in the solid state, in solution by DOSY, NMR titration and activation experiments, as well as in silico. A combined anion&#8208;&#960; /chalcogen bonding interaction mode prevails for most compounds. For the tellurium derivatives, the pure chalcogen bonding gains in importance, while hydrogen bonding becomes more relevant for the sulfur analogs.







Abstract
For a comparison of the interaction modes of various chalcogen&#8208;bond donors, 2&#8208;chalcogeno&#8208;imidazolium salts have been designed, synthesized, and studied by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, solution NMR and DFT as well as for their ability to act as activators in an SN1&#8208;type substitution reaction. Their interaction modes in solution were elucidated based on NMR diffusion and chemical shift perturbation experiments, which were supported by DFT&#8208;calculations. Our finding is that going from lighter to the heavier chalcogens, hydrogen bonding plays a less, while chalcogen bonding an increasingly important role for the coordination of anions. Anion&#8208;&#960; interactions also show importance, especially for the sulfur and selenium derivatives.

         <title>Selective B(3)&#8208;H Activation Affording Multinuclear Ir(III) Complexes with (o&#8208;Carboranyl)dithioester Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Linkage of two or three o&#8208;carborane moieties was achieved to form a series of carboranyldithioester bridging ligands. Direct B(3)&#8208;H activation on these ligands without the assistance of Ag(I) and alkali was realized with half&#8208;sandwich [Cp*IrCl2]2 and confirmed by single crystal structure analysis. Their SnCl2&#8208;inserted derivatives further confirm the selective B(3)&#8208;H activation.







Abstract
A method was developed to link two or three o&#8208;carborane moieties to form a series of carboranyl dithioester bridging ligands via in&#8197;situ substitution of haloalkanes by tetraphenylphosphonium carboranyldithiocarboxylates. Based on these ligands, direct B&#8722;H activation without the assistance of Ag(I) and alkali was successfully achieved with half&#8208;sandwich Ir(III) substrate [Cp*IrCl2]2 to yield corresponding bimetallic or trimetallic complexes. Single crystal structure analyses of the B&#8722;H activated complexes and corresponding SnCl2&#8208;inserted derivatives confirm the selective B(3)&#8208;H activation in these complexes.

         <title>Smartphone&#8208;Based Sensing of Cortisol by Functionalized Rhodamine Probes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cortisol detection by optical Strip Test, based on fluorescent rhodamine probes properly functionalized to interact by non&#8208;covalent interactions with cortisol, is here described. Furthermore, we used a smartphone as detector, obtaining a prototype for the monitoring cortisol levels in real life.







Abstract
During a stress condition, the human body synthesizes catecholamine neurotransmitters and specific hormones (called &#8220;stress hormones&#8221;), the most important of which is cortisol. The monitoring of cortisol levels should be extremely important to control the stress levels, and for this reason, it shows important medical applications. The common analytical methods (HPLC, GC&#8208;MS) cannot be used in real life, due to the bulky size of the instruments and the necessity of specialized personnel. Molecular probes solve these problems due to their fast and easy use. The synthesis of new fluorescent rhodamine probes, able to interact by non&#8208;covalent interactions with cortisol, the recognition properties in solution as well as in solid state by Strip Test, using a smartphone as detector, are here reported. DFT calculations and FT&#8208;IR measurements suggest the formation of supramolecular complexes through hydrogen bonds as main non&#8208;covalent interaction. The present study represents one of the first sensor, based on synthetical chemical receptors, able to detect cortisol in a linear range from 1&#8197;mM to 1&#8197;pM, based on non&#8208;covalent molecular recognition and paves the way to the realization of practical point&#8208;of&#8208;care device for the monitoring of cortisol in real live.

         <title>Kinetic Trapping of an Out&#8208;of&#8208;Equilibrium Dynamic Library of Imines by Changing Solvent</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
When an Activated Carboxylic Acid (ACA) is employed to perturb a dynamic library of imines, the nature of the solvent has a crucial role in defining the non&#8208;equilibrium state of such library. A dissipative dynamic library in CD2Cl2, fully coupled with the decarboxylation of the ACA, or a kinetically trapped out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium dynamic library in CD3CN can be generated.







Abstract
A well&#8208;behaved dynamic library composed of two imines and corresponding amines was subjected to the action of an activated carboxylic acid (ACA), whose decarboxylation is known to be base promoted, in different solvents, namely CD2Cl2, CD3CN, and mixtures of them. Two non&#8208;equilibrium systems are consequently obtained: i)&#8197;a dissipative (CD2Cl2) and ii)&#8197;an out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium (CD3CN) dynamic library whose composition goes back to equilibrium after a given time. In the former case, the library is fully coupled with the decarboxylation of the ACA, while in the latter, an energy ratchet operates. In the mixed solvents, the library exhibits a mediated behavior. Interestingly, in the presence of an excess of added ACA, the different behavior of the imine library in the two solvents is expected to manifest only when the excess acid is consumed.

         <title>Real&#8208;time LSPR&#8208;based study of metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) growth</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>MOFs are known for their absorption properties and widely used for accumulation, filtering, sensorics, photothermal, catalytical and other applications. Their combination with plasmonic metal nanoparticles leads to hybrid structures that profit from the stabilizing effect and high porosity of the MOF as well as the optical and electronic properties of the nanoparticles. The growth of MOFs on plasmonic nanoparticles can be monitored in&#8208;situ using LSPR spectroscopy, simultaneously applying microfluidic reaction conditions for the fabrication of NP@MOF structures. Here, a systematic study is conducted using LSPR spectroscopy for the monitoring of the Layer&#8208;by&#8208;Layer deposition of twelve different MOFs, determining the suitability of LSPR spectroscopy for this purpose. In addition to some well&#8208;investigated materials like HKUST&#8208;1, other MOFs such as MIL&#8208;53, MIL&#8208;88A and Cu&#8208;BDC are deposited successfully. For some MOFs such as Zn&#8208;Fum, the LSPR experiment indicates that no deposition had taken place. The results are confirmed with AFM, SEM and XPS measurements. This work shows that LSPR spectroscopy is suitable for the in&#8208;situ monitoring of LbL MOF growth and the microfluidic setup is a promising method for the controlled manufacturing of NP@MOF hybrid structures. Further studies may include optimization of the synthesis process or transfer to other materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Ni Single Atom Decorated Porous Hollow Carbon Nanosphere&#8208;Based Electrodes for High Performance Symmetric Solid&#8208;State Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ni single atom containing hollow carbon nanospheres with nitrogen doping has been synthesized by carbonization of Ni(NO3)2/phloroglucinol&#8208;formaldehyde polymer/silica composite. The samples have been characterized by powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, nitrogen adsorption/desorption, electron microscopic, Raman and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopic studies.

Abstract
Understanding diversity is the foundation for progress on inclusion. Diversity covers a wide range of characteristics, not just gender. Does the training meet the current needs of the workplace? What role does gender discrimination play in the chemical workforce? To what extent are partners treated equally when caring for a family member? Three Employment Surveys for European Chemists (ESEC1 &#8211; ESEC3) were conducted between 2013 and 2020. The online questionnaires were open to chemists from all countries. 9747 responses were collected for all three surveys together. The reports for ESEC1 and ESEC2 are freely available.[1,2] The questionnaires from ESEC1 to ESEC3 were continuously adapted to reflect the latest discussions in our societies, for example diversity, which was specifically addressed in ESEC3. The results are reported here. The Royal Society of Chemistry asked similar questions.[3] Graduates from the last 15&#8197;years are particularly important for two reasons. They are the largest group of ESEC participants, with 59&#8201;% of the responses, and they represent the labour market with the greatest future prospects. Their situation is of particular importance for real decisions about the chemistry labour market. For this reason, the current report focuses exclusively on graduates of the last 15&#8197;years.

Abstract
What are the country&#8208;specific differences in the education of chemistry students across the EU? How do students&#8217; preferred careers change with the level of their qualifications? Do students have sufficient information to make good career choices? Which media are now considered most effective for job searches? What do students currently consider to be a successful career?
Three Employment Surveys for European Chemists (ESEC1&#8722;ESEC3) were conducted between 2013 and 2020. The web&#8208;based questionnaires were open to chemists from all countries. A total of 9747 responses were received. The reports for ESEC1 and ESEC2 are freely available.[1,2] Subsequent questionnaires have been continuously adapted to reflect the latest discussions in our societies. In particular, ESEC3 focused on students&#8217; careers. The results are reported here. Where results from earlier surveys are included, this is explicitly stated.
Graduates of the last 15&#8197;years are particularly important for two reasons. They represent the largest group of ESEC participants, with 59&#8201;% of the responses, and they represent the labour market with the greatest future prospects. Their situation is of particular importance for real decisions about the chemistry labour market. For this reason, this report focuses exclusively on graduates of the last 15&#8197;years.

         <dc:description>Tunable photoluminescence (PL) is one of the hot topics in current materials science, and research performed on the molecular phases is at the forefront of this field. We present the new (Et4N)2[PtII(bph)(CN)2]&#183;rez3&#183;1/3H2O (Pt2rez3) (bph = biphenyl&#8208;2,2&#8217;&#8208;diyl; rez3 = 3,3&#8221;,5,5&#8221;&#8208;tetrahydroxy&#8208;1,1&#8217;:4&#8217;,1&#8221;&#8208;terphenyl,&#160;phenylene&#8208;1,4&#8208;diresorcinol coformer, a linear quaternary hydrogen bond donor) co&#8208;crystal salt based on the recently appointed promising [PtII(bph)(CN)2]2&#8211; luminophore. Within the extended hydrogen&#8208;bonded subnetwork [PtII(bph)(CN)2]2&#8211; complexes and rez3 coformer molecules form two types of contacts: the&#160; rez3O&#8208;H&#183;&#183;&#183;Ncomplex ones in the equatorial plane of the complex and non&#8208;typical rez3O&#8208;H&#183;&#183;&#183;Pt ones along its axial direction. The combined structural, PL, and DFT approach distinguished the rez3O&#8208;H&#183;&#183;&#183;Pt synthons to promote the noticeable uniform redshift of bph ligand centered (LC) emission compared to the LC emission of (Et4N)2[PtII(bph)(CN)2]&#183;H2O (Pt2) precursor owing to the direct interference of the phenol group into the PtII&#8208;bph orbital system via altering the CT processes. The high&#8208;resolution emission spectra for Pt2 and Pt2rez3 were successfully reproduced at 77 K by using the Franck&#8208;Cordon expressions. The possibility to tune PL properties along the plausible continuum of rez3O&#8208;H&#183;&#183;&#183;Pt synthons is indicated, considering various scenarios of molecular occupation of the space above and below the complex plane.</dc:description>

         <title>Unusually short H&#183;&#183;&#183;H contacts in intramolecularly cyclized helically fused anthracenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The intramolecular coupling of dichloro&#8208;substituted helically fused anthracenes using the Yamamoto coupling yielded cyclized products with sterically congested molecular structures. The X&#8208;ray analysis and DFT calculations showed that the aromatic framework adopted a nonplanar structure with a twisted conformation about the newly formed single bond, which acts as a chiral axis. Interestingly, the X&#8208;ray structure obtained through the Hirshfeld atom refinement revealed short interatomic distances between the inner hydrogen atoms (1.648&#8211;1.692 &#197;), much shorter than the sum of their van der Waals radii. Owing to these unusually short contacts, the 1H NMR spectrum exhibited a significant deshielding (12.5 ppm) and a large nuclear Overhauser effect (44%). Additionally, the IR spectrum displayed a high&#8208;frequency shift of the C&#8211;H stretching vibration. These observations, along with the noncovalent interaction plot indicative of a characteristic steric environment, strongly support the presence of steric hindrance. Moreover, dynamic NMR measurement of the mesityl&#8208;substituted derivative yielded a barrier to helical inversion of 84 kJ mol&#8722;1. The optical properties and crystal packing of the cyclized products are also reported.</dc:description>

         <title>Low&#8208;lying LUMO Boosts Conductance in Antiaromatic Dibenzopentalene Versus Aromatic Analogues</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Antiaromaticity is a fundamental concept in chemistry, but the study of molecular wires incorporating antiaromatic units is limited. Despite initial predictions, very few studies show that antiaromaticity has a beneficial effect on electron transport. Dibenzo[a,e]pentalene (DBP) is a stable structure that displays appreciable antiaromaticity within the five&#8208;membered rings of the pentalene core. We have investigated derivatives of DBP furnished with pyridyl (Py) and F4&#8208;pyridyl (PyF4) anchor groups, and compared the conductance with purely aromatic phenyl and anthracene analogues. We find that the low&#8208;bias conductance of DBP&#8208;Py is approximately 60% larger than that of the anthracene analogue Anth&#8208;Py and 250% larger compared to the phenyl derivative Ph&#8208;Py. This is due to a better alignment of the LUMO with the gold Fermi level, which we confirm by conductance&#8208;voltage spectroscopy where the conductance of DBP&#8208;Py shows the greatest voltage&#8208;dependence. The F4&#8208;pyridyl compounds, which have lower LUMO energies compared to the pyridyl analogues, did not, however, form detectable molecular junctions. The strongly electron&#8208;withdrawing fluorine atoms reduce the donor capability of the nitrogen lone&#8208;pair to the point where stable N&#8208;Au bonds no longer form</dc:description>

         <title>The Mechanism of Guerbet Reaction by Metal Ligand Cooperation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Guerbet reaction is important for the synthesis of longer&#8208;chain monoalcohols like isobutanol through catalytic transfer hydrogenation from short&#8208;chain methanol and ethanol. However, the mechanism becomes complicated, especially considering the variations in the different metal&#8208;ligand cooperation (MLC) catalysts used. In order to further understand the Guerbet reaction, DFT studies were performed to figure out the detailed mechanism initiated by the unique Mn&#8208;PCP MLC Catalyst. Our results suggest that even with the assistance of the carbanion site of the PCP ligand, the direct substitution mechanism is less favored than the condensation&#8208;reduction mechanism. The key step of the reaction is the final reduction of the carbonyl, in which the 1,4&#8208;reduction of the unsaturated aldehyde is prior to the 3,4&#8208;reduction or 1,2&#8208;reduction due to the stronger interaction between the catalyst and the substrate. It is found that the production of isobutanol is preferred over n&#8208;butanol because of the lower total free energy barrier and lower relative free energy of the product. Finally, by changing the electronic effect of the carbanion site of the catalyst, we found that the relation between the electronic effect and the highest free energy span was not monotonous and a point with optimal electronic effect exists numerically.</dc:description>

         <title>Photo&#8208;triggered Phase Transition of Crystals and Photoactuation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photo&#8208;triggered phase transition is a new type of phase transition in which a photochromic crystal with a thermal phase transition transforms into an identical high&#8208;temperature phase in a temperature region lower than the thermal phase transition temperature upon light irradiation. Here, we report a second crystal that exhibits a photo&#8208;triggered phase transition, thereby demonstrating that the photo&#8208;triggered phase transition is a general phenomenon that occurs in crystals. When the chiral salicylidenephenylethylamine crystal was irradiated with ultraviolet (UV) light, the photo&#8208;triggered phase transition occurred in the temperature range &#8211;30 to &#8211;10&#176;C. The photo&#8208;triggered phase transition is induced by local stress due to trans&#8208;keto molecules produced by photoisomerization near the irradiated surface. Crystal cantilevers exhibited stepwise bending by the combination of the photo&#8208;triggered phase transition and photoisomerization. Alternate irradiation with UV and visible light achieved locomotion of single crystals driven by repeated stepwise bending. Finally, a detailed comparison of photo&#8208;triggered and non&#8208;photo&#8208;triggered phase transition crystals revealed that a sufficient molecular conformation change in affordable crystal voids, smooth photoisomerization, and most likely a chiral molecular arrangement are required for inducing the photo&#8208;triggered phase transition.</dc:description>

         <title>Linkage&#8208;Mediated Electronic Structure Modulation in Multicomponent Covalent Organic Frameworks for Dramatically Promoted Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Linkage chemistry is an essential aspect to covalent organic framework (COF) applications; it is highly desirable to precisely modulate electronic structure mediated directly by linkage for efficient COF&#8208;based photocatalytic hydrogen evolution, which however, remains substantially challenging. Herein, as a proof of concept, a collection of robust multicomponent pyrene&#8208;based COFs with abundant donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) interactions has been judiciously designed and synthesized through molecularly engineering linkage for photogeneration of hydrogen. Controlled locking and conversion of linkage critically contribute to continuously regulating COFs&#8217; electronic structures further to optimize photocatalytic activities. Remarkably, the well&#8208;modulated optoelectronic properties turn on the average hydrogen evolution rate from zero to 15.67&#160;mmol g&#8208;1&#160;h&#8208;1&#160;by the protonated quinoline&#8208;linked COF decorated with the trifluoromethyl group (TT&#8208;PQCOF&#8208;CF3). Using diversified spectroscopy and theoretical calculations, we show that&#160;multiple modifications toward linkage&#160;synergistically lead to the redistribution of charge on COFs with extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation and reinforced D&#8208;A effect, making TT&#8208;PQCOF&#8208;CF3&#160;a promising material with significantly boosted carrier separation and migration.&#160;This study provides important guidance for the design of high&#8208;performance COF photocatalysts based on the strategy of linkage&#8208;mediated electronic structure modulation&#160;in COFs.</dc:description>

         <title>Crystalline CdS/amorphous Cd(OH)2 Composite for Electrochemical CO2 Reduction to CO in a Wide Potential Window</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical CO2 reduction is a promising method for converting atmospheric CO2 into valuable low&#8208;carbon chemicals. In this study, a crystalline cadmium sulfide/amorphous cadmium hydroxide composite was successfully deposited on the carbon paper substrate surface by in&#8208;situ chemical bath deposition (named as c&#8208;CdS/a&#8208;Cd(OH)2/CP electrodes) for the efficient electrochemical CO2 reduction to produce CO. The c&#8208;CdS/a&#8208;Cd(OH)2/CP electrode exhibited high CO Faradaic efficiencies (&gt;90%) under a wide potential window of 1.0 V, with the highest value reaching ~100% at the applied potential ranging from &#8722;2.16 V to &#8722;2.46 V vs. ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+), superior to the crystalline counterpart c&#8208;CdS/CP and c&#8208;CdS/c&#8208;Cd(OH)2@CP electrodes. Meanwhile, the CO partial current density reached up to 154.7 mA cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;2.76 V vs. Fc/Fc+ on the c&#8208;CdS/a&#8208;Cd(OH)2/CP electrode. The excellent performance of this electrode was mainly ascribed to its special three&#8208;dimensional structure and the introduction of a&#8208;Cd(OH)2. These structures could provide more active sites, accelerate the charge transfer, and enhance adsorption of *COOH intermediates, thereby improving the CO selectivity. Moreover, the electrolytes consisting of 1&#8208;butyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate and acetonitrile also enhanced the reaction kinetics of electrochemical CO2 reduction to CO.</dc:description>

         <title>Classical versus Collective Interactions in Asymmetric Trigonal Bipyramidal Alkaline Metal&#8211;Boron Halide Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
C3v&#8208;M2BX3 complexes (M=Li, Na, and K; X=F, Cl, and Br) may form in reduction of BX3 via alkali metals. In M2BX3 species a collective and a normal bond form simultaneously. Bond dissociation energies prove that the collective bond is more stable than the normal bond. Here, isodensity surface of Laplacian of electron density shows electron concentration regions in K2BBr3.







Abstract
Collective interactions are a novel type of chemical bond formed between metals and electron&#8208;rich substituents around an electron&#8208;poor central atom. So far only a limited number of candidates for having collective interactions are reported. In this work, we extend the newly introduced concept of collective bonding to a series of neutral boron complexes with the general formula M2BX3 (M=Li, Na, and K; X=F, Cl, and Br). Our state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art ab initio computations suggest that these complexes form trigonal bipyramidal structures with a D3h to C3v distortion along the C3 axis of symmetry. The BX3 unit in the complexes distorts from planar to pyramidal akin to a sp3 hybridized atom. Interestingly, the interaction of the metals with the pyramidal side of BX3, where the lone pair in a hypothetical [BX3]2&#8722; should be located, is weaker than the interactions of metals with the inverted side, i.&#8201;e., the middle of three halogen atoms. The origin of this stronger interaction can be explained by the formation of collective interactions between metals and halogen atoms as we explored via energy decomposition within the context of the theory of interacting quantum atoms, IQA.

&lt;/sub&gt; axis of symmetry. The BX&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; unit in the complexes distorts from planar to pyramidal akin to a sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; hybridized atom. Interestingly, the interaction of the metals with the pyramidal side of BX&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, where the lone pair in a hypothetical [BX&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; should be located, is weaker than the interactions of metals with the inverted side, i.&#8201;e., the middle of three halogen atoms. The origin of this stronger interaction can be explained by the formation of collective interactions between metals and halogen atoms as we explored via energy decomposition within the context of the theory of interacting quantum atoms, IQA.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Total Chemical Synthesis of Aggregation&#8208;Prone Disulfide&#8208;Rich Starfish Peptides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a comprehensive synthetic strategy for creating relaxin&#8208;like peptides characterized by a two&#8208;chain structure linked by three disulfide bonds. Utilizing Fmoc solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis, the A&#8208; and B&#8208;chains are independently assembled with orthogonal cysteine protecting groups (tBu, Acm, Trt) to facilitate the controlled formation of disulfide bonds. The synthesis proceeds through four key steps: (i.) Oxidation of the A&#8208;chain to establish the intramolecular disulfide bond; (ii.) Conversion of Cys(tBu) to a more reactive Cys(SPyr) derivative; (iii.) Thiolysis&#8208;driven combination of A&#8208; and B&#8208;chain to form the first inter&#8208;chain disulfide bond; and (iv.) Final disulfide bond formation via iodine oxidation, culminating in the production of the fully assembled peptide.







Abstract
A relaxin&#8208;like gonad&#8208;stimulating peptide (RGP), Aso&#8208;RGP, featuring six cysteine residues, was identified in the Crown&#8208;of&#8208;Thorns Starfish (COTS, Acanthaster cf. solaris) and initially produced through recombinant yeast expression. This method yielded a single&#8208;chain peptide with an uncleaved C&#8208;peptide (His Tag) and suboptimal purity. Our objective was to chemically synthesize Aso&#8208;RGP in its mature form, comprising two chains (A and B) and three disulfide bridges, omitting the C&#8208;peptide. Furthermore, we aimed to synthesize a newly identified relaxin&#8208;like peptide, Aso&#8208;RLP2, from COTS, which had not been previously synthesized. This paper reports the first total chemical synthesis of Aso&#8208;RGP and Aso&#8208;RLP2. Aso&#8208;RGP synthesis proceeded without major issues, whereas the A&#8208;chain of Aso&#8208;RLP2, in its reduced and unfolded state with two free thiols, presented considerable challenges. These were initially marked by &#8220;messy&#8221; RP&#8208;HPLC profiles, typically indicative of synthesis failure. Surprisingly, oxidizing the A&#8208;chain significantly improved the RP&#8208;HPLC profile, revealing the main issue was not synthesis failure but the peptide's aggregation tendency, which initially obscured analysis. This discovery highlights the critical need to account for aggregation in peptide synthesis and analysis. Ultimately, our efforts led to the successful synthesis of both peptides with purities exceeding 95&#8201;%.

         <title>Heterocycle&#8208; and Amine&#8208;Free Electrochromic and Electrofluorochromic Molecules for Energy&#8208;Saving See&#8208;Through Smart Windows and Displays</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochromic (EC) smart windows are an elegant alternative to dusty curtains, blinds, and traditional dimming devices. The EC energy storage smart windows and displays received remarkable attention in the optoelectronic industry as they hold promise for high energy efficiency, low power consumption, reversibility, and swift response to stimuli. However, achieving these properties remains challenging. Moreover, most EC molecules do not exhibit electrofluorochromism, which is highly essential for smart displays because its EC property can modulate the solar heat entering the building, and its electrofluorochromic (EFC) aspects can create lighting during the night. In this work, a structure&#8208;property relationship is utilized to develop new electrochromes that can store the injected charge, and these molecules indeed exhibit electrofluorochromism. The compounds are synthesized from tetrabenzofluorene with two aromatic acceptor units, and avoids the use of widely studied heterocycles and amine derivatives. The electrochromes switches from yellow to dark hue in solution, solid, and gel state. The compounds display exceptional electrochemical stability and reversibility in 1000 cycles and capacity retention of 93&#8208;100% in 300 charging&#8208;discharging cycles. The proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept device fabrication of the self&#8208;dimming EC smart window presented here demonstrates that it can furnish visual comfort, modulate transmitted light and glare, and reduce energy usage.</dc:description>

         <title>A Mechanistic Spectrum of O&#8208;H Bond Cleavage Observed for Reactions of Phenols with a Manganese Superoxo Complex</title>

Intriguingly, the reactions of 1 with 4&#8208;chlorophenol and 4&#8208;methoxyphenol follow two routes of CPET and sequential proton and electron transfer to furnish complex 2 in the end.

         <title>Chiral Diselenophosphoric Acids for Ion Pair Catalysis: A Novel Approach to Enhance Both Proton Donating and Proton Accepting Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The activation of poorly reactive substrates via strong chiral acids is a central topic in asymmetric ion pair catalysis these days. Despite highly successful scaffolds such as N&#8208;triflylphosphoramides, these catalysts either lack C2&#8208;symmetry or provide multiple H&#8208;bond acceptor sites, leading to lower ee values for certain reactions. We present BINOL&#8208;based diselenophosphoric acids (DSA) as an extremely promising alternative. Using an intertwined approach of synthesis and NMR studies, we developed a synthetic approach to DSA with up to 98% NMR yield. The obtained acids provide both very high proton donor and proton acceptor properties, a bifunctionality, which is key to catalytic applications. Indeed, first reactivity test proved the much higher acidity of DSA and its ability to initiate Mukaiyama&#8211;Mannich reaction and protodesilylation of silyl ethers. Together with their C2&#8208;symmetry, the single donor and single acceptor situation, the decreased tendency of self&#8208;association, and the straightforward synthesis with potential 3,3&#8217;&#8208;substitution, the DSA provide all features ideal for the further development of ion pair catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced Near&#8208;infrared Phosphorescent Emission Modulated by Clipping of Metallotweezers in Aqueous Media</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Near&#8208;infrared phosphorescent materials have received significant attention due to their potential applications in bioimaging and diagnostics. Although, many types of organic phosphors with near&#8208;infrared emission have been developed, the low phosphorescence efficiency in aqueous solution hampers their practical applications in biological systems. Hence, there is an urgent need to develop near&#8208;infrared phosphorescent materials with high emission efficiency in aqueous media. Metallotweezers, based on d8 transition metal complexes, emerge as the potential candidates for realizing this objective. Specifically, metallotweezers, featuring two positively charged platinum(II) terpyridine and neutral gold(III) diphenylpyridine pincers on diphenylpyridine spacer, have been designed and synthesized, respectively. The pre&#8208;organization effect, rendered by the rigid spacer, enables the resulting metallotweezers to complex with each other, resulting in the formation of clipping complex. The synergistic rigidifying and shielding effects of clipping structure results in enhanced phosphorescent emission intensity. Concurrently, due to phase segregation between the clipping units and the polyethylene glycol tail, the clipping complex undergoes self&#8208;assembly in aqueous solution, resulting in phosphorescent emission in the near&#8208;infrared region. Overall, non&#8208;covalent clipping of metallotweezers illustrated in this study presents a new and effective approach toward near&#8208;infrared phosphorescent materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Thixotropic Composite Hydrogel Electrode Composed of a Polymer Hydrogelator and Water&#8208;Dispersive Tungsten Oxide Flat Microparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here, we introduce an organic/inorganic composite hydrogel as a versatile gel electrode material. This composite hydrogel was formed by simply mixing an aqueous solution of flat microparticles of tungsten oxide, exhibiting superior water dispersibility, with a hydrogel composed of a water&#8208;soluble polyaramide&#8208;based polymer hydrogelator. The resulting composite hydrogel exhibited uniform dispersion of tungsten oxide flat particles throughout the hydrogel matrix, supplementing the structure formed by the polymer hydrogelator. It maintained the gel&#8208;forming capability and thixotropic behavior inherent to the polymer hydrogelator while showcasing the electrochemical characteristics of tungsten oxide. With its spreadability and applicability to various electrode shapes, a composite hydrogel is presented as a potential spreadable gel electrode material.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanical Bond Induced Enhancement and Purification of Pyrene Emission in the Solid State</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To address key concerns on solid&#8208;state pyrene&#8208;based luminescent materials, we propose a novel and efficient mechanical bond strategy. This strategy results in a transformation from aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) to aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) effect and a remarkable enhancement of pyrene emission in the solid state. More importantly, an unusual purification of emission is also achieved. Through computational calculation and experimental characterization, finally determined by X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis, we prove that the excellent emissions result from the refined molecular arrangements, including reduced &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking, well&#8208;ordered packing and enhanced structural stability. This work demonstrates the potential of mechanical bond in the field of organic luminescent molecules, providing a new avenue for developing high&#8208;performance organic luminescent materials and beyond.</dc:description>

         <title>Rapid access to divergent fused polycycles via one&#8208;pot A3 coupling and intramolecular Diels&#8208;Alder reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Divergent nitrogen&#8208;containing fused polycyclic ring systems are constructed from simple starting materials via a one&#8208;pot aldehyde&#8208;alkyne&#8208;amine (A3) coupling and intramolecular Diels&#8208;Alder reaction. This domino reaction directly furnishes linear 5/5/5 and 5/5/6, or nonlinear 5/5/6/5, polycyclic rings containing an oxa&#8208;bridged fused 5/5 bicycle and a 1,6&#8208;enyne substructure. One&#8208;step derivation of the oxa&#8208;bridged 5/5 bicycle leads to a polyfunctionalized 5/5 bicycle with tetrahydrofuran fused back&#8208;to&#8208;back to pyrroline or a 6/5 bicycle with the hexahydro&#8208;1H&#8208;isoindole structure, while cycloisomerizing the enyne substructure adds an extra fused 5&#8208;membered ring to afford functionalized linear 5/5/5/5 or 5/5/5/5/5 fused ring systems from selected substrates. In addition, the one&#8208;pot product can be designed so that the alkyne moiety is hydroalkoxylated to form an additional heterocyle in a linear 5/5/5/6 or nonlinear 5/5/6/5/5 ring system. This diversity&#8208;oriented synthetic approach thus allows rapid access to an under&#8208;explored structural space for discovery of new biological or non&#8208;biological activities or functions.</dc:description>

         <title>Unusual Photochemistry in Aromatic Dithioimides: Quantitative Thione Reduction Promoted by Ether Solvents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a mechanistic investigation of an aromatic dithioimide (2SS) displaying puzzling yet efficient photochemistry in ether solvents. Perplexingly, 2SS dissolved in ether solvents in a sealed and degassed vial was photochemically converted to the corresponding diimide (2OO), as determined by 1H NMR following product extraction. With no external sources of oxygen in the sample, could the oxygen in 2OO be from the ether itself? To study this unprecedented proposition, we attempt to uncover the ether&#8217;s involvement in this reaction. As seen by laser&#8208;flash photolysis, 2SS appears to first react with the solvent from its singlet excited state. Following the reaction by NMR under rigorously oxygen&#8208; and water&#8208;free conditions led to the identification of a photoreductive pathway that quantitatively transformed one thione into a methylene to yield 2SH2. Subsequent oxidation of 2SH2 or irradiation of 2SS under air proved that molecular oxygen was indeed necessary to observe an oxidative pathway leading to 2OO, ruling out the initially proposed involvement of an ether oxygen. An explanation of 2SS desulfurization was further revealed through the study of solvent by&#8208;products by GC&#8208;MS analysis. Supported by DFT calculations, a mechanism is proposed to involve a chain reaction initiated by photochemically generated ether radical.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The present study corroborates that the neutral tridentate&#160;N&#8208;ligand trimethyl&#8208;triazacyclononane (Me3TACN) qualifies as a versatile platform to study selective ligand exchange with rare&#8208;earth&#8208;metal alkyl complexes, herein [(Me3TACN)YMe3].

         <title>Recent Advancements in Continuous&#8208;Flow Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura Coupling Utilizing Immobilized Molecular Palladium Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 27, May 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The present &#8216;Concept&#8217; provides a comprehensive review of recent strides in continuous&#8208;flow Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling, employing a packed&#8208;bed reactor featuring immobilized palladium complexes. Emphasis is placed on meticulously designed catalyst structures and the innovative reaction technologies employed under continuous&#8208;flow conditions, accentuating their pivotal roles in the establishment of a pragmatic synthesis process.







Abstract
Immobilized Pd&#8208;catalyzed Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling under continuous&#8208;flow conditions using a packed&#8208;bed reactor, representing an efficient, automated, practical, and safe technology compared to conventional batch&#8208;type reactions. The core objective of this study is the development of an active and durable catalyst. In contrast to supported Pd nanoparticles, the attachment of Pd complexes onto solid supports through well&#8208;defined coordination sites is considered a favorable approach for preparing highly dispersed and stabilized Pd species. These species can be directly employed in various flow reactions without the need for pre&#8208;treatment. This concept paper explores recent achievements involving the application of immobilized Pd complexes as precatalysts for continuous&#8208;flow Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling. Our focus is to elucidate the significance of the designed catalyst structures in relation to their catalytic performance under flow conditions. Additionally, we highlight various reaction systems and catalyst packing methods, emphasizing their crucial roles in establishing a practical synthesis process.

         <title>The Role of Alkalis in Orchestrating Uranyl&#8208;Peroxide Reactivity Leading to Direct Air Capture of Carbon Dioxide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 27, May 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alkali&#8208;countercations for inorganic oxoanions are not innocent bystanders. The uranyl triperoxide anion, a monomer building block for uranyl&#8208;polyoxometalates, shows substantial decrease in stability with increasing alkali size, in solution and the solid state. The Cs uranyl triperoxide, stable for only minutes in air, undergoes stabilization by direct air capture of CO2.







Abstract
Spectator ions have known and emerging roles in aqueous metal&#8208;cation chemistry, respectively directing solubility, speciation, and reactivity. Here, we isolate and structurally characterize the last two metastable members of the alkali uranyl triperoxide series, the Rb+ and Cs+ salts (Cs&#8208;U1 and Rb&#8208;U1). We document their rapid solution polymerization via small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering, which is compared to the more stable Li+, Na+ and K+ analogues. To understand the role of the alkalis, we also quantify alkali&#8208;hydroxide promoted peroxide deprotonation and decomposition, which generally exhibits increasing reactivity with increasing alkali size. Cs&#8208;U1, the most unstable of the uranyl triperoxide monomers, undergoes ambient direct air capture of CO2 in the solid&#8208;state, converting to Cs4[UVIO2(CO3)3], evidenced by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, and Raman spectroscopy. We have attempted to benchmark the evolution of Cs&#8208;U1 to uranyl tricarbonate, which involves a transient, unstable hygroscopic solid that contains predominantly pentavalent uranium, quantified by X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Powder X&#8208;ray diffraction suggests this intermediate state contains a hydrous derivative of CsUVO3, where the parent phase has been computationally predicted, but not yet synthesized.

         <title>3,4&#8208;Dimethylenecyclobutene: A Building Block for Design of Macrocycles with Excited State Aromatic Low&#8208;Lying High&#8208;Spin States</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 27, May 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We studied the electronic structure and (anti)aromatic character of 3,4&#8208;dimethylenecyclobutene (DMCB) and of macrocycles composed of fused DMCB units in their lowest&#8208;lying states of different multiplicities. The designed macrocycles exhibit very stable low&#8208;lying nonet states, which can be even thermally populated as result of local H&#252;ckel&#8208; and Baird&#8208;aromaticity.







Abstract
3,4&#8208;Dimethylenecyclobutene (DMCB) is an unusual isomer of benzene. Motivated by recent synthetic progress to substituted derivatives of this scaffold, we carried out a theoretical and computational analysis with a particular focus on the extent of (anti)aromatic character in the lowest excited states of different multiplicities. We found that the parent DMCB is non&#8208;aromatic in its singlet ground state (S0), lowest triplet state (T1), and lowest singlet excited state (S1), while it is aromatic in its lowest quintet state (Q1) as this state is represented by a triplet multiplicity cyclobutadiene (CBD) ring and two uncoupled same&#8208;spin methylene radicals. Interestingly, the Q1 state, despite having four unpaired electrons, is placed merely 4.8&#8197;eV above S0, and there is a corresponding singlet tetraradical 0.16&#8197;eV above. The DMCB is potentially a highly useful structural motif for the design of larger molecular entities with interesting optoelectronic properties. Here, we designed macrocycles composed of fused DMCB units, and according to our computations, two of these have low&#8208;lying nonet states (i.&#8201;e., octaradical states) at energies merely 2.40 and 0.37&#8197;eV above their S0 states as a result of local H&#252;ckel&#8208; and Baird&#8208;aromatic character of individual 6&#960;&#8208; and 4&#960;&#8208;electron monocycles.

         <title>Intramolecular Phenyl Transfer from a Boronate to Lithium in the Gas Phase Reveals Crucial Role of Solvation in Transmetalations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 27, May 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Contrary to common belief, transmetalation reactions are not simply controlled by the electronegativity difference of the involved metals/metalloids. A combination of gas&#8208;phase and solution experiments, together with quantum chemical calculations, reveals the crucial role of solvation in the transmetalation from lithium to boron. Only in the presence of solvent molecules, the reaction proceeds in the expected direction, whereas the formation of the organolithium compound is favored in the gas phase.







Abstract
In contrast to its behavior in solution, the adduct [(LiBr)(tBu)(Ph)Bpin]&#8722; (pin=pinacol) transfers its phenyl anion from boron to lithium upon fragmentation in the gas phase. Quantum chemical calculations predict this exceptional transmetalation to be exothermic relative to the separated reactants, [(tBu)(Ph)Bpin]&#8722; and LiBr, which we attribute to the high phenyl&#8208;anion affinity of the coordinatively unsaturated LiBr unit. The addition of a single molecule of tetrahydrofuran drastically reduces the phenyl&#8208;anion affinity of LiBr and thereby renders the transmetalation from boron to lithium endothermic. Thus, the probed system highlights the importance of solvation and ligation effects in transmetalations. For correctly predicting the direction, in which these reactions proceed, it is not sufficient to consider the electronegativities or partial charges of the involved metals or metalloids. Instead, the individual coordination states and their changes over the course of the reaction must be taken into account.

         <dc:description>
A series of near&#8208;IR&#8208;absorbing 2,6&#8208;diarylated aza&#8208;BDP derivatives with various electron donors is designed, synthesized, and characterized. The impact of diverse electron donor substitutions on the photophysical properties is examined through steady&#8208;state UV&#8208;vis absorption and fluorescence spectra, electrochemical analyses, time&#8208;resolved nanosecond transient absorption (ns&#8208;TA) spectroscopy, and theoretical computations.







Abstract
A series of near&#8208;IR absorbing 2,6&#8208;diarylated BF2&#8208;chelated aza&#8208;boron&#8208;dipyrromethenes (aza&#8208;BDPs) derivatives bearing different electron donors (benzene, naphthalene, phenanthrene, phenothiazine and carbazole) were designed and synthesized. The effect of different electron donor substitutions on the photophysical properties was studied by steady&#8208;state UV&#8208;vis absorption and fluorescence spectra, electrochemical, time&#8208;resolved nanosecond transient absorption (ns&#8208;TA) spectroscopy and theoretical computations. The UV&#8208;vis absorption spectra of AzaBDP&#8208;PTZ and AzaBDP&#8208;CAR (&#955;abs=710&#8197;nm in toluene) showed a bathochromic absorption profile compared with the reference AzaBDP&#8208;Ph (&#955;abs=685&#8197;nm in toluene), indicating the non&#8208;negligible electronic interaction at the ground state between donor and acceptor moieties. Moreover, the fluorescence is almost completely quenched for AzaBDP&#8208;PTZ/AzaBDP&#8208;CAR (fluorescence quantum yield, &#934;F=0.2&#8211;0.7&#8201;% in toluene) as compared with the AzaBDP&#8208;Ph (&#934;F=27&#8201;% in toluene).

         <title>Effect of Fe Doping Profile on Current Collapse in GaN&#8208;based RF HEMTs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 27, May 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Accurate simulation models are established and developed to investigate Fe doping profile on current collapse in GaN&#8208;based Radio Frequency (RF) high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs). By controlling Fe doping profile in GaN buffer layer, current&#8208;collapse magnitude (&#9653;CC) of GaN&#8208;based RF HEMTs can be reduced by approximately 50.3&#8201;%.







Abstract
Using computer&#8208;aided design (TCAD) simulation, the impact of the Fe doping profile, including concentration, decay rate, and depth of the doping region on current&#8208;collapse magnitude (&#9653;CC) in 0.5&#8208;&#956;m gated GaN&#8208;based high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs) is systematically investigated. Accurate simulation models are established and developed to facilitate the fabrication of electronics. It is elucidated that the intricate interplay between trapping and de&#8208;trapping of Fe&#8208;related traps at the gate&#8208;drain edge is responsible for current collapse. The concentration and decay rate of the doping region have a more significant impact on current collapse than the depth. Increased trap state density near two&#8208;dimensional electron gas (2DEG) channel caused by deep&#8208;level acceptors would boost &#9653;CC. However, a minor dynamic reduction in 2DEG density (nT) induces a relatively small &#9653;CC. By adjusting the concentration, decay rate, and depth of the doping region, &#9653;CC of GaN&#8208;based Radio Frequency (RF) HEMTs can be reduced by approximately 50.3&#8201;%. The optimized distribution of Fe doping discussed in this work helps to prepare GaN&#8208;based RF HEMTs with a limited current collapse effect.

Products with up to 99&#8201;% yield and up to 99&#8201;% ee were obtained in aza&#8208;Friedel&#8208;Crafts reaction of 1&#8208;naphthols and electron&#8208;rich phenols with isatin&#8208;derived ketimines using Cu(II) complex bearing binaphthyl&#8208;proline&#8208;imidazoline&#8208;based tridentate chiral ligand as catalyst. The system showed good scalability, and reaction carried out in gram&#8208;scale also provided the desired product in excellent ee.







Abstract
New chiral ligands could be obtained by introducing proline moieties and imidazoline moieties to binaphthyl skeletons. The chiral ligands exhibited balanced rigidity and flexibility which could allow the change of the conformations during the reactions on one hand, and could provide sufficient asymmetric induction on the other. The proline moiety could act as a linker connecting the binaphthyl skeletons and the imidazoline moieties as well as a coordinating group for the central metal, and the electronic and steric properties of the imidazoline groups could be carefully fine&#8208;tuned by the use of different substituents. In the presence of Cu(II) catalyst bearing such chiral ligands, aza&#8208;Friedel&#8211;Crafts reaction of 1&#8208;naphthols and electron&#8208;rich phenols with isatin&#8208;derived ketimines provided the desired products with good to excellent yields and up to 99&#8201;% ee. The reactions showed good scalability, and excellent ee could still be obtained when the reaction was carried out in gram&#8208;scale.

         <title>Selectivity in Adduct Formation of a Bidentate Boron Lewis Acid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 27, May 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The adduct formation of a bidentate boron Lewis acid with diamines and &#8208;phosphines with an increasing linker length was observed in solution by NMR experiments and in the solid state by X&#8208;ray diffraction. This study offers insight into the selectivity of the host&#8208;guest adduct formation of bidentate Lewis acids with host molecules of varying size.







Abstract
A bidentate boron Lewis acid based on 1,8&#8208;diethynylanthracene has been studied in detail with respect to its adduct formation with diamines and diphosphanes of different linker lengths between the donor functions. A clear correlation between the linker length of the bifunctional base and the formation of 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 adducts, 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 adducts or oligomers was found. The adducts were characterized in solution by NMR titration experiments and structurally by X&#8208;ray diffraction. In addition, adduct formation and competition experiments of the host system with ZR3 (Z=N, P; R=H, Me) demonstrated the generally higher stability of alkylphosphane adducts compared to alkylamine adducts with boron functions. The results provide a general insight into the adduct formation of bidentate Lewis acids with guests of different sizes as well as the differences in stability between borane&#8208;amine and borane&#8208;phosphane adducts.

         <title>Non&#8208;Templated Assembly of D5h&#8208;Symmetric Pd5L10 Rings by Precise Ligand Angle Adjustment</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 27, May 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Systematic angle variation in bis&#8208;monodentate ligands allowed the first non&#8208;templated synthesis of Pd5L10 rings. Across different PdnL2n ring sizes, the nuclearity n is correlated to the ligand binding angle, with conformational strain being the decisive factor.







Abstract
We report a series of Pd(II)nL2n coordination rings for which nuclearity is controlled by the binding angle of the corresponding bis&#8208;monodentate bridging ligands. Judicious choice of the angle within a family of rather rigid ligands allowed for the first&#8208;time to synthesize a homoleptic five&#8208;membered Pd5L10 ring that does not require any template to form. We demonstrate that control over the ring size is maintained both in the solid&#8208;, solution&#8208;, and gas&#8208;phase. Two X&#8208;ray structures of five&#8208;membered rings from ligands with ideal angles (yielding a perfect pentagonal ring) vs. suboptimal angles (resulting in a highly distorted structure) illustrate the importance of the correct ligand geometry. A mathematical model for estimating the expected ring size based on the ligand angle was derived and DFT computations show that ring&#8208;strain is the major factor determining the assembly outcome.

&lt;p&gt;Systematic angle variation in bis-monodentate ligands allowed the first non-templated synthesis of Pd&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;L&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; rings. Across different Pd&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;L&lt;sub&gt;2n&lt;/sub&gt; ring sizes, the nuclearity n is correlated to the ligand binding angle, with conformational strain being the decisive factor.

         <title>Optimal Oriented External Electric Fields to Trigger a Barrierless Oxaphosphetane Ring Opening Step of the Wittig Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 27, May 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The perturbed potential energy surface of the oxaphosphetane ring opening due to the optimal electric field demonstrates that the process occurs by first breaking the P&#8722;C bond and then breaking the O&#8722;C bond.







Abstract
The Wittig reaction is one of the most important processes in organic chemistry for the asymmetric synthesis of olefinic compounds. In view of the increasingly acknowledged potentiality of the electric fields in promoting reactions, here we will consider the effect of the oriented external electric field (OEEF) on the second step of Wittig reaction (i.&#8201;e. the ring opening oxaphosphetane) in a model system for non&#8208;stabilized ylides. In particular, we have determined the optimal direction and strength of the electric field that should be applied to annihilate the reaction barrier of the ring opening through the polarizable molecular electric dipole (PMED) model that we have recently developed. We conclude that the application of the optimal external electric field for the oxaphosphetane ring opening favours a Bestmann&#8208;like mechanism.

         <title>Driving Triplet State Population in Benzothioxanthene Imide Dyes: Let's twist!</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 27, May 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A subtle chemical modification in the bay area of the benzothioxanthene imide (BTI) was used to shed light on the closely intertwined connections between spin&#8208;orbit coupling, distortion of the &#960;&#8208;system, and intersystem crossing.







Abstract
Controlling the formation of photoexcited triplet states is critical for many (photo)chemical and physical applications. Here, we demonstrate that a permanent out&#8208;of&#8208;plane distortion of the benzothioxanthene imide (BTI) dye promotes intersystem crossing by increasing spin&#8208;orbit coupling. This manipulation was achieved through a subtle chemical modification, specifically the bay&#8208;area methylation. Consequently, this simple yet efficient approach expands the catalog of known molecular engineering strategies for synthesizing heavy atom&#8208;free, dual redox&#8208;active, yet still emissive and synthetically accessible photosensitizers.

         <title>First Potassium Fluoroaluminate Ionic Exchanger for Rapid and Selective Removal of Sr2+ with High Capacity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 27, May 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Remarkable potassium fluoroaluminate possesses an excellent adsorption selectivity (Kd=~6.1&#215;104&#8197;mL&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1) and a maximum adsorption capacity of (qm=~120.32&#8197;mg&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1) for Sr2+. Importantly, it still keep a very good selectivity for Sr2+ ions even in the presence of competing Na+, Mg2+ and Ca2+ aqueous solutions.







Abstract
90Sr, as a typical artificial radionuclide, poses a serious threat to human health and the ecological environment. The selective removal of this radionuclide from industrial nuclear waste is crucial for our environment. Here we report a novel potassium fluoroaluminate, K2[(AlF5)H2O], which was synthesized by a simple low&#8208;temperature one&#8208;step method. It adopts a 1D AlF6&#8208;chain structure, which consists of exchangeable potassium ions in between the infinite chains of octahedral Al centers. As a remarkable inorganic ionic exchanger, K2[(AlF5)H2O] has a high chemical stability (resistance of pH=~3&#8208;12) and thermal stability (&#8805;~300&#8201;&#176;C). It possesses an excellent adsorption selectivity (Kd=~6.1&#215;104&#8197;mL&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1) and a maximum adsorption capacity of qm=~120.32&#8197;mg&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1 for Sr2+. Importantly, it still keep a very good selectivity for Sr2+ ions even in the presence of competing Na+, Mg2+ and Ca2+ aqueous solutions. K2[(AlF5)H2O] is the first example of fluoroaluminate ionic exchange materials that can capture Sr2+. This result opens up a new way to design and synthesize inorganic ionic exchangers for the selective removal of Sr2+ ions from radioactive waste water.

         <title>Socialane, a Nonaprenyl Terpene Hydrocarbon Surface Lipid from the Collembola Hypogastrura socialis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 27, May 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unlike insects, some of the tiny Collembola use large terpenes as epicuticular lipids. The identification and synthesis of socialane, the first cyclic regular nonaprenyl terpene from the cuticle of the springtail Hypogastrura socialis is reported. In the background, the nanostructure of the superhydrophobic collembolan cuticle is shown.







Abstract
Springtails use unique compounds for their outermost epicuticular wax layer, often of terpenoid origin. We report here the structure and synthesis of socialane, the major cuticular constituent of the Collembola Hypogastrura socialis. Socialane is also the first regular nonaprenyl terpene with a cyclic head group. The saturated side chain has seven stereogenic centers, making the determination of the configuration difficult. We describe here the identification of socialane and a synthetic approach using the building blocks farnesol and phytol, enantioselective hydrogenation, and &#945;&#8208;alkylation of sulfones for the synthesis of various stereoisomers. NMR experiments showed the presence of an anti&#8208;configuration of the methyl groups closest to the benzene ring and that the other methyl groups of the polyprenyl side&#8208;chain are not uniformly configured. Furthermore, socialane is structurally different from [6+2]&#8208;terpene viaticene of the closely related H. viatica, showing species specificity of the epicuticular lipids of this genus and hinting at a possible role of surface lipids in the communication of these gregarious arthropods.

         <title>Leveraging Halogen Interactions for a Supramolecular Nanotube</title>

Formation of supramolecular nanotubes from molecular triangles in a single crystal is observed. The supramolecular nanotube growth is templated by intermolecular halogen interactions between individual macrocycles encoded directly in their structure creating a well defined nanochannel.







Abstract
We demonstrate the formation of supramolecular nanotubes from molecular triangles in a single crystal by balancing the hydrogen bonds and halogen interactions between individual macrocycles. Thereby, we template the supramolecular nanotube growth by intermolecular interactions encoded directly in the macrocycles instead of those provided by the crystallization solvent. Ultimately, we show that replacing bromines for iodines in the macrocycle is necessary to achieve this supramolecular organization by enhancing the strength of the halogen interactions and concomitant reduction of the detrimental hydrogen bonds. We investigated the nature and the interplay of the individual intermolecular interactions by analysis of the experimental single crystal data and quantum chemical calculations. This work enriches the available toolbox of supramolecular interactions and will aid and abet the development of rationally&#8208;designed materials with a long&#8208;range 1D tubular organization.

         <title>Phenanthrothiophene&#8208;Triazine Star&#8208;Shaped Discotic Liquid Crystals: Synthesis, Self&#8208;Assembly, and Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Fluorescence Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 27, May 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Triazine&#8208;based mesogens with three pending discoid arms have been shown to self&#8208;organize into rectangular columnar mesophases and form gels in various solvents. The solvatochromic&#8208;, acidochromic&#8208; and metal recognition&#8208;response photoluminescence of these mesogens offer applications in stimuli&#8208;responsive fluorescence anti&#8208;counterfeiting and as selective metal&#8208;ion recognition.







Abstract
Lipophilic biphenylthiophene&#8208; and phenanthrothiophene&#8208;triazine compounds, BPTTn and CPTTn, respectively, were prepared by a tandem procedure involving successive Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling and Scholl cyclodehydrogenation reactions. These compounds display photoluminescence in solution and in thin film state, solvatochromism with increasing solvent's polarity, as well as acidochromism and metal ion recognition stimuli&#8208;responsive fluorescence. Protonation of BPTT10 and CPTT10 by trifluoroacetic acid results in fluorescence quenching, which is reversibly restored once treated with triethylamine (ON&#8208;OFF switch). DFT computational studies show that intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) phenomena occurs for both molecules, and reveal that protonation enhances the electron&#8208;withdrawing ability of the triazine core and reduces the band gap. This acidochromic behavior was applied to a prototype fluorescent anti&#8208;counterfeiting device. They also specifically recognize Fe3+ through coordination, and the recognition mechanism is closely related to the photoinduced electron transfer between Fe3+ and BPTT10/CPTT10. CPTTn self&#8208;assemble into columnar rectangular (Colrec) mesophase, which can be modulated by oleic acid via the formation of a hydrogen&#8208;bonded supramolecular liquid crystal hexagonal Colhex mesophase. Finally, CPTTn also form organic gels in alkanes at low critical gel concentration (3.0&#8197;mg/mL). Therefore, these star&#8208;shaped triazine molecules possess many interesting features and thus hold great promises for information processing, liquid crystal semiconductors and organogelators.

         <title>Prism[2]dihydrophenazines: Synthesis, Configurational Analysis, and Supramolecular Tessellation through Exo&#8208;Wall Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 27, May 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of macrocyclic arenes (prism[2]dihydrophenazines) with tunable flexibility have been fabricated by AlCl3&#8208;catalyzed Friedel&#8208;Crafts reactions between methyl&#8208;substituted derivatives of dihydrophenazine subunits and paraformaldehyde in 1,2&#8208;dichloroethane. Cocrystallization of the flexible prism[2]dihydrophenazine with the electron&#8208;deficient guest tetrafluoro&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone resulted in regular parallelogram&#8208;like supramolecular tessellation.







Abstract
Macrocyclic arenes have gained considerable attention for their structural diversity and widespread applications. In this research, a new kind of macrocyclic arenes, namely prism[2]dihydrophenazines (anti&#8208;P2P20, syn&#8208;P2P20, and P2P22), composed of two dihydrophenazine derivatives subunits bridged by methylene groups, were conveniently synthesized by AlCl3&#8208;catalyzed one&#8208;pot condensation in 1,2&#8208;dichloroethane. Both anti&#8208;P2P20 and its isomer syn&#8208;P2P20 exhibited flexible and convertible conformation with narrow cavity, while P2P22 possessed rigid and rhombic&#8208;like skeleton due to the more steric hindrance on subunits. In addition, the selection of electron&#8208;deficient guest was found to influence the outside binding behavior of syn&#8208;P2P20. Fantastic regular supramolecular tessellation was fabricated by tiling of syn&#8208;P2P20 with tetrafluoro&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone (TFB) through the exo&#8208;wall interactions. Using 1,5&#8208;difluoro&#8208;2,4&#8208;dinitrobenzene (DFN) as a linker, only the regular 2D network superstructure with periodic units in a plane was obtained through cocrystallization. This work not only reports the construction of supramolecular tessellations by using prism[2]dihydrophenazines as building blocks, but also provides a new perspective for the design of macrocyclic arenes and fabrication of 2D supramolecular materials.

         <title>NBN&#8208; and BNB&#8208;Phenalenyls: the Yin and Yang of Heteroatom&#8208;doped &#960; Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 27, May 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photophysical properties of NBN&#8208;phenalenyls are experimentally and quantum&#8208;chemically investigated, shedding light on the substituent&#8208;dependent emission characteristics of these compounds. Co&#8208;aggregation of a suitable NBN&#8208; with its complementary BNB&#8208;phenalenyl in a microsuspension leads to a drastic red&#8208;shift in emission wavelength compared to the emission of an equimolar mixture in solution.







Abstract
NBN&#8208; and BNB&#8208;doped phenalenyls are isoelectronic to phenalenyl anions and cations, respectively. They represent a pair of complementary molecules that have essentially identical structures but opposite properties as electron donors and acceptors. The NBN&#8208;phenalenyls 1&#8211;4 considered here were prepared from N,N&#8217;&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1,8&#8208;diaminonaphthalene and readily available boron&#8208;containing building blocks (i.&#8201;e., BH3&#8901;SMe2 (1), p&#8208;CF3&#8208;C6H4B(OH)2 (2), C6H5B(OH)2 (3), or MesBCl2/iPr2NEt (4)). Treatment of 1 with 4&#8208;Me2N&#8208;2,6&#8208;Me2&#8208;C6H2Li gave the corresponding NBN derivative 5. The BNB&#8208;phenalenyl 6 was synthesized from 1,8&#8208;naphthalenediyl&#8208;bridged diborane(6), PhNH2, and MesMgBr. A computational study reveals that the photoemission of 1, 4, and 5 originates from locally excited (LE) states at the NBN&#8208;phenalenyl fragments, while that of 2 is dominated by charge transfer (CT) from the NBN&#8208;phenalenyl to the p&#8208;CF3&#8208;C6H4 fragment. Depending on the dihedral angle &#952; between its Ph and NBN planes, compound 3 emits mainly from a less polar LE (&#952; &gt;55&#176;) or more polar CT state (&#952; &lt;55&#176;). In turn, the energetic preference for either state is governed by the polarity of the solvent used. An equimolar aggregate of the NBN&#8208; and BNB&#8208;phenalenyls 3 and 6 (in THF/H2O) shows a distinct red&#8208;shifted emission compared to that of the individual components, which originates from an intermolecular CT state.

The NBN-phenalenyls &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt; considered here were prepared from &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;N&#8217;-&lt;/i&gt;dimethyl-1,8-diaminonaphthalene and readily available boron-containing building blocks (i.&#8201;e., BH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#8901;SMe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;), &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;B(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;), C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;B(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;), or MesBCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;Pr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NEt (&lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;)). Treatment of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; with 4-Me&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N-2,6-Me&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Li gave the corresponding NBN derivative &lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt;. The BNB-phenalenyl &lt;b&gt;6&lt;/b&gt; was synthesized from 1,8-naphthalenediyl-bridged diborane(6), PhNH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and MesMgBr. A computational study reveals that the photoemission of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt; originates from locally excited (LE) states at the NBN-phenalenyl fragments, while that of &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; is dominated by charge transfer (CT) from the NBN-phenalenyl to the &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; fragment. Depending on the dihedral angle &lt;i&gt;&#952;&lt;/i&gt; between its Ph and NBN planes, compound &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; emits mainly from a less polar LE (&lt;i&gt;&#952;&lt;/i&gt; &amp;gt;55&#176;) or more polar CT state (&lt;i&gt;&#952;&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt;55&#176;). In turn, the energetic preference for either state is governed by the polarity of the solvent used. An equimolar aggregate of the NBN- and BNB-phenalenyls &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;6&lt;/b&gt; (in THF/H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) shows a distinct red-shifted emission compared to that of the individual components, which originates from an intermolecular CT state.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>7Li NMR Spectroscopy: A Tool for Determining Dimerization Constants and Averaged Dimerization Constants of the Monomer/Dimer Equilibrium of Hierarchical Helicates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 27, May 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
7Li NMR is a perfect tool for the evaluation of supramolecular aggregates. In case of titanium(IV) based hierarchical helicates dimerization as well as averaged dimerization constants are determined and the expansion and compression of molecular switches is followed. Thus, 7Li NMR helps to understand phenomena far beyond the simple observation of a heteroatom resonance in solution or in the solid.







Abstract
7Li nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is an ideal tool to study hierarchically assembled helicates of the form Li[Li3L6Ti2]. Internally bound and external lithium ions can be well distinguished by solution&#8208; or solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy and dimerization constants of the monomer/dimer equilibrium can be easily determined in solution. Averaged dimerization constants can be estimated in case of statistical mixtures of helicates formed from mixtures of ligands.

         <title>Azulene&#8208;Containing Bis(squaraine) Dyes: Design, Synthesis and Aggregation Behaviors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 27, May 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three azulene&#8208;containing bis(squaraine) dyes were synthesized, among which BSQ1 showed distinct aggregation behaviors from the other two dimers and demonstrated excellent photothermal conversion efficiency. In nanoparticles, BSQ1 formed J&#8208;aggregates while BSQ2 and BSQ3 displayed H&#8208;aggregates. In films, BSQ1 presented the most significant rearrangement of aggregate structures upon thermal annealing with improved charge transport capabilities.







Abstract
The relationship among chemical structure, physicochemical property and aggregation behavior of organic functional material is an important research topic. Here, we designed and synthesized three bis(squaraine) dyes BSQ1, BSQ2 and BSQ3 through the combination of two kinds of unsymmetrical azulenyl squaraine monomers. Their physicochemical properties were investigated in both molecular and aggregate states. Generally, BSQ1 displayed different assembly behaviors from BSQ2 and BSQ3. Upon fabrication into nanoparticles, BSQ1 tend to form J&#8208;aggregates while BSQ2 and BSQ3 tend to form H&#8208;aggregates in aqueous medium. When in the form of thin films, three bis(squaraine) dyes all adopted J&#8208;aggregation packing modes while only BSQ1 presented the most significant rearrangement of aggregate structures as well as the improvement in the carrier mobilities upon thermal annealing. Our research highlights the discrepancy of aggregation behaviors originating from the molecular structure and surrounding circumstances, providing guidance for the molecular design and functional applications of squaraines.

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Complex of the Parent Phosphinidene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 27, May 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pre&#8208;reactive complex (HP&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;HCl) in prototype phosphinidene insertion reactions has been observed in the photoreaction between the parent phosphinidene PH and HCl in an Ar&#8208;matrix at 10&#8197;K. This hydrogen&#8208;bonded complex is highly unstable, as its structure varies in the presence of other weak hydrogen&#8208;bond acceptors such as N2 and HCl.







Abstract
The diatomic molecule PH is very reactive, and it serves as the parent compound for phosphinidenes featuring a monovalent phosphorus atom. Herein, we report the characterization and reactivity of a rare hydrogen&#8208;bonded complex of PH. Specifically, the molecular complex between PH and HCl has been generated by photolysis of chlorophosphine (H2PCl) at 254&#8197;nm in a solid Ar&#8208;matrix at 10&#8197;K. The IR spectrum of the complex HP&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;HCl and quantum chemical calculations at the UCCSD(T)&#8208;F12a/haTZ level consistently prove that the phosphorus atom acts as a hydrogen bond acceptor with a binding energy (D0) of &#8722;0.6&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1. In line with the observed absorption at 341&#8197;nm for the binary complex, the triplet phosphinidene PH undergoes prototype H&#8722;Cl bond insertion by reformation of H2PCl upon photoexcitation at 365&#8197;nm. However, this hydrogen&#8208;bonded complex is unstable in the presence of N2 and HCl, as both molecules prefers stronger interactions with HCl than PH in the observed complexes HP&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;HCl&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;N2 and HP&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;2HCl.

         <title>A Study on Auto&#8208;Catalysis and Product Inhibition: A Nucleophilic Aromatic Substitution Reaction Catalysed within the Cavity of an Octanuclear Coordination Cage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 27, May 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An octanuclear cubic coordination cage catalyses the nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction of a cavity&#8208;bound guest, 2,4&#8208;dinitrofluorobenzene (DNFB). The product 2,4&#8208;dinitrophenolate (DNP) remained bound within the cavity, providing both autocatalysis in the early stages and inhibition in the late stages of the reaction. A red&#8208;shift in the UV/Vis spectrum revealed 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 host to guest binding, this was confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallography analysis.







Abstract
The ability of an octanuclear cubic coordination cage to catalyse a nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction on a cavity&#8208;bound guest was studied with 2,4&#8208;dinitrofluorobenzene (DNFB) as the guest/substrate. It was found that DNFB undergoes a catalysed reaction with hydroxide ions within the cavity of the cubic cage (in aqueous buffer solution, pH&#8197;8.6). The rate enhancement of kcat/kuncat was determined to be 22, with cavity binding of the guest being required for catalysis to occur. The product, 2,4&#8208;dinitrophenolate (DNP), remained bound within the cavity due to electrostatic stabilisation and exerts two apparently contradictory effects: it initially auto&#8208;catalyses the reaction when present at low concentrations, but at higher concentrations inhibits catalysis when a pair of DNP guests block the cavity. When encapsulated, the UV/Vis absorption spectrum of DNP is red&#8208;shifted when compared to the spectrum of free DNP in aqueous solution. Further investigations using other aromatic guests determined that a similar red&#8208;shift on cavity binding also occurred for 4&#8208;nitrophenolate (4NP) at pH&#8197;8.6. The red&#8208;shift was used to determine the stoichiometry of guest binding of DNP and 4NP within the cage cavity, which was confirmed by structural analysis with X&#8208;ray crystallography; and was also used to perform catalytic kinetic studies in the solution&#8208;state.

A red-shift in the UV/Vis spectrum revealed 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 host to guest binding, this was confirmed by X-ray crystallography analysis.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ability of an octanuclear cubic coordination cage to catalyse a nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction on a cavity-bound guest was studied with 2,4-dinitrofluorobenzene (DNFB) as the guest/substrate. It was found that DNFB undergoes a catalysed reaction with hydroxide ions within the cavity of the cubic cage (in aqueous buffer solution, pH&#8197;8.6). The rate enhancement of &lt;i&gt;k&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt;/k&lt;sub&gt;uncat&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; was determined to be 22, with cavity binding of the guest being required for catalysis to occur. The product, 2,4-dinitrophenolate (DNP), remained bound within the cavity due to electrostatic stabilisation and exerts two apparently contradictory effects: it initially auto-catalyses the reaction when present at low concentrations, but at higher concentrations inhibits catalysis when a pair of DNP guests block the cavity. When encapsulated, the UV/Vis absorption spectrum of DNP is red-shifted when compared to the spectrum of free DNP in aqueous solution. Further investigations using other aromatic guests determined that a similar red-shift on cavity binding also occurred for 4-nitrophenolate (4NP) at pH&#8197;8.6. The red-shift was used to determine the stoichiometry of guest binding of DNP and 4NP within the cage cavity, which was confirmed by structural analysis with X-ray crystallography; and was also used to perform catalytic kinetic studies in the solution-state.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bimodal Use of Chiral &#945;&#8208;Trifluoromethylalanine in Aib Foldamers: Study of the Position Impact Towards the Helical Screw&#8208;Sense Preference</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 27, May 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Introduction of a chiral &#945;&#8208;trifluoromethylalanine residue into Aib oligomers proved its effectiveness as a bimodal moiety, acting both as controller and 19F NMR reporter of the helical screw&#8208;sense preference. By varying its position along the chain and the nature of the C&#8208;terminal capping, our study revealed the stereoelectronic properties of the CF3 group enabling the control of the helical conformation.







Abstract
Oligomers of the achiral &#945;&#8208;aminoisobutyric acid (Aib) adopt a 310 helical conformation in which the screw&#8208;sense preference can be controlled by a single chiral residue. The use of the fluorinated residue &#945;&#8208;Trifluoromethylalanine (&#945;&#8208;TfmAla) revealed a unique way to both induce and measure the screw&#8208;sense preference of such oligomers acting as 19F NMR probe. This work proposes a systematic study of the effect of this fluorinated chiral inducer on the helical screw&#8208;sense preference of poly&#8208;Aib oligomers. The impact of the position of the fluorinated residue into pentamers (N&#8208;terminal, central or C&#8208;terminal) as well as the nature of the C&#8208;terminal capping of the peptides was thoroughly studied in light of complete structural analysis. A deeper understanding of the fluorine effect was achieved confirming the unique ability of &#945;&#8208;TfmAla as a helical screw&#8208;sense controller.

         <title>A Healable Quasi&#8208;Solid Polymer Electrolyte with Balanced Toughness and Ionic Conductivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 27, May 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A gel polymer electrolyte, rooted in poly(urethane&#8208;urea) chemistry, has been synthesized by a post immersion method, which allows for precise manipulation of its mechanical and electrical properties. This polymer electrolyte demonstrates exceptional dendritic resistance and outstanding self&#8208;healing features, with significant potential for application in lithium&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
Solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) have garnered extensive attention as potential alternatives to traditional liquid electrolytes, primarily due to their prowess in curbing lithium dendrite formation and preventing electrolyte leaks. The quest for SPEs that are both mechanically robust and exhibit superior ionic conductivity has been vigorous. However, achieving a harmonious balance between these two attributes remains a significant challenge. In this study, we introduce a novel quasi&#8208;solid electrolyte, ingeniously crafted from a poly(urethane&#8208;urea) network, enriched with lithium salts and plasticizers. This innovative composition not only boasts remarkable toughness but also ensures commendable ionic conductivity. Our post&#8208;gelation method yields gel polymer electrolytes that undergo rigorous evaluation, leading to an optimized version that stands out with its exceptional room&#8208;temperature ionic conductivity (2.94&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1) and outstanding toughness (11.9 MJ m&#8722;3). Moreover, it demonstrates a broad electrochemical window (4.73&#8197;V), remarkable stability across a 600&#8208;hour cycle test, a high capacity retention exceeding 80&#8201;% after 100&#8197;cycles at 0.2&#8197;C, and a noteworthy self&#8208;healing capability. This quasi&#8208;solid polymer electrolyte emerges as a promising contender to replace current liquid electrolyte solutions.

         <title>Photosensitizers Enable the Formation of Biphenyls with UV&#8208;LEDs and Sunlight</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 27, May 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A significantly improved method for metal&#8208;free biaryl synthesis through the photochemical extrusion of traceless linkers (photosplicing) is presented. An array of aldehydes and ketones have been identified as powerful photosensitizers that eliminate the requirement for UV&#8722;C light, allowing the use of UV LEDs and even sunlight. This advancement not only simplifies the reaction setup but also enables the scalable production of biphenyls.







Abstract
The regioselective synthesis of biphenyls, which are economically important pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and liquid crystals, is a challenging task. Current methods rely on metal&#8208;dependent cross&#8208;coupling reactions, which unfortunately require the use of harmful halogenated aryls and heavy metal catalysts that are toxic and difficult to remove from the final products. Recently, we have circumvented these problems by developing a metal&#8208;free and broadly applicable photochemical method for biphenyl synthesis using UV&#8722;C light, called photosplicing. Here we present an improved method using photosensitizers in combination with UV&#8722;B, UV&#8722;A light, or sunlight. Using a high&#8208;precision flow reactor with deep&#8208;UV LEDs, we investigated the ability of commonly available organic photosensitizers to enhance the photosplicing reaction and identified a number of suitable photosensitizers with the required triplet energy. This method allows for easy batch synthesis of biaryls in borosilicate glassware and paves the way for their large&#8208;scale production without the need for flow reactors.

Hyping up Europium: Here we report the first examples of molecular europium&#8197;(II) hydrides, which can be conveniently isolated from the reaction of either symmetrical or unsymmetrical &#946;&#8208;diketiminato europium&#8197;(II) alkyls with 1,4&#8208;cyclohexadiene.







Abstract
The bulky &#946;&#8208;diketiminate ligand frameworks [BDIDCHP]&#8722; and [BDIDipp/Ar]&#8722; (BDI=[HC{C(Me)2N&#8208;Dipp/Ar}2]&#8722; (Dipp=2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl (Dipp); Ar=2,6&#8208;dicyclohexylphyenyl (DCHP) or 2,4,6&#8208;tricyclohexylphyenyl (TCHP)) have been developed for the kinetic stabilisation of the first europium&#8197;(II) hydride complexes, [(BDIDCHP)Eu(&#956;&#8208;H)]2, [(BDIDipp/DCHP)Eu(&#956;&#8208;H)]2 and [(BDIDipp/TCHP)Eu(&#956;&#8208;H)]2, respectively. These complexes represent the first step beyond the current lanthanide(II) hydrides that are all based on ytterbium. Tuning the steric profile of &#946;&#8208;diketiminate ligands from a symmetrical to unsymmetrical disposition, enhanced solubility and stability in the solution&#8211;state. This provides the first opportunity to study the structure and bonding of these novel Eu(II) hydride complexes crystallographically, spectroscopically and computationally, with their preliminary reactivity investigated.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Promoted Cascade Coupling of 2&#8208;Isocyanonaphthalenes with Elemental Sulfur and Amines to Construct Naphtho[2,1&#8208;d]thiazol&#8208;2&#8208;Amines</title>

         <dc:description>
A facile and efficient visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced three&#8208;component reaction has been developed for the synthesis of 2&#8208;aminonaphthothiazoles from 2&#8208;isocyanonaphthalenes, elemental sulfur, and amines. This photochemical transformation can be conducted under mild conditions without an external photocatalyst to afford various naphtho[2,1&#8208;d]thiazol&#8208;2&#8208;amines in moderate to excellent yields by using air as a green oxidant.







Abstract
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced strategy has been explored for the synthesis of naphtho[2,1&#8208;d]thiazol&#8208;2&#8208;amines through ortho&#8208;C&#8722;H sulfuration of 2&#8208;isocyanonaphthalenes with elemental sulfur and amines under external photocatalyst&#8208;free conditions. This three&#8208;component reaction, which utilizes elemental sulfur as the odorless sulfur source, molecular oxygen as the clean oxidant, and visible light as the clean energy source, provides a mild and efficient approach to construct a series of naphtho[2,1&#8208;d]thiazol&#8208;2&#8208;amines. Preliminary mechanistic studies indicated that visible&#8208;light&#8208;promoted photoexcitation of reaction intermediates consisting of thioureas and DBU might be involved in this transformation.

         <title>Cover Feature: The Role of Alkalis in Orchestrating Uranyl&#8208;Peroxide Reactivity Leading to Direct Air Capture of Carbon Dioxide (Chem. Eur. J. 27/2024)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 27, May 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nuclear double duty? When coupled with heavy alkali counter&#8208;cations, depleted uranium (from nuclear fuel production) in the form of a uranyl triperoxide is a potent material for CO2 direct air capture (DAC). In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202301687), M. Nyman and co&#8208;workers show how they isolated highly reactive Cs+ and Rb+ uranyl triperoxide materials and how the reactivity of the alkali uranyl triperoxide analogues increases with increasing alkali size, through polymerization in solution and through CO2 DAC in the solid state.

Through an accessible chemical modification, a permanent out&#8208;of&#8208;plane distortion was induced in the &#960;&#8208;conjugated backbone of a benzothioxanthene imide (BTI). This simple yet effective strategy was used to manipulate triplet formation with ease and to rationalize the closely intertwined connection between spin&#8211;orbit coupling, twisting of the &#960;&#8208;system and intersystem crossing. More information can be found in the Research Article by C. Monnereau, C. Cabanetos, T. Le&#8197;Bahers and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202400191).

         <title>Tailoring the Properties of Gel Polymer Electrolytes for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries Using Ionic Liquids: A Review</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 27, May 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The review paper features the use of ionic liquids in tuning the properties of gel polymer electrolytes for sodium&#8208;ion batteries. We aim to give the readers some general context of the structure and properties of ionic liquids because it is the ground for shaping the electrolyte. Furthermore, the characterization techniques and results are discussed.







Abstract
Ionic liquids are an extraordinary group of compounds, fully ionic in structure like inorganic salts but with low melting points, that resemble organic molecular solvents. Their chemical, electrochemical, and thermal stability is what draws the attention and enables their use in many applications, including electrochemical power sources. Even though they are no longer considered eco&#8208;friendly because of nonnegligible toxicity and long bioaccumulation, they can still be efficiently recovered, purified, and reused. These attributes can be harvested to enhance the properties of gel polymer electrolytes for the emerging sodium&#8208;ion batteries. The variety of anions and cations for ILs and their influence on the final properties of the compound opens the road to tuning the properties of gel polymer electrolytes. Ionic liquids as plasticizers constitute a major part of gel polymer electrolytes (average of 70&#8197;wt%) and hence, they affect the fundamental properties of gel electrolytes like ionic conductivity and electrochemical window. They also improve the safety features of sodium&#8208;ion batteries, which is relevant for their anticipated applications in stationary energy storage and electric vehicles. The presented review paper aims to explain the relationship between the cation and anion in ionic liquid and the properties of gel electrolytes for sodium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Recent Developments of Nontraditional Single&#8208;Molecule Toroics</title>

Based on the nontraditional perspective, the exciting advances of SMTs are reviewed ranging from the 3D topological to 1D&amp;2D&amp;3D polymeric SMTs, and 3d&#8211;4f to non Dy&#8208;based SMTs. The understanding of key design principles and the outlook on nontraditional SMTs will contribute to the design of novel SMTs.







Abstract
Single&#8208;molecule toroics (SMTs), defined as a type of molecules with toroidal arrangement of magnetic moment associated with bi&#8208;stable non&#8208;magnetic ground states, are promising candidates for high&#8208;density information storage and the development of molecule based multiferroic materials with linear magneto&#8211;electric coupling and multiferroic behavior. The design and synthesis of SMTs by arranging the magnetic anisotropy axis in a circular pattern at the molecular level have been of great interest to scientists for last two decades since the first detection of the SMT behavior in the seminal Dy3 molecules. DyIII ion has long been the ideal candidate for constructing SMTs due to its Kramer ion nature as well as high anisotropy. Nevertheless, other LnIII ions such as TbIII and HoIII ions, as well as some paramagnetic transition metal ions, have also been used to construct many nontraditional SMTs. Therefore, we review the progress in the studies of SMTs based on the nontraditional perspective, ranging from the 3D topological to 1D&amp;2D&amp;3D polymeric SMTs, and 3d&#8211;4f to non Dy&#8208;based SMTs. We hope the understanding we provide about nontraditional SMTs will be helpful in designing novel SMTs.

Heterocyclic naphthalene diimide (NDI) acenes and NDI hydroazaacenes possess unique and intriguing properties. This review explores the diverse range of synthetic routes as well as their versatile applications in areas such as sensors, semiconductors, optical and redox&#8211;switchable materials as well as in biology.







Abstract
Acenes and Naphthalene Diimides (NDIs) stand as distinguished classes of organic compounds, each possessing unique and intriguing properties that have garnered significant attention across various scientific disciplines. Acenes, characterized by linearly fused aromatic rings, have captivated researchers due to their diverse electronic structures and promising applications in materials science. On the other hand, NDIs, known for their distinctive electron&#8211;accepting properties, exhibit remarkable versatility in fields ranging from organic electronics, supramolecular to spin chemistry. In this review, we navigate through the fascinating realms of both acenes and NDIs before converging our focus on the highly diverse and distinctive subgroup of NDI&#8211;annulated heterocyclic acenes. This potentially important subgroup, has emerged as a subject of intense investigation, encapsulating their fascinating synthesis, optical and electrochemical characteristics, and multifaceted applications that span the realms of chemistry, physics, and biology. Through the exploration of their synthetic strategies, unique properties, and diverse applications, this review aims to offer a comprehensive understanding of the pivotal role played by NDI&#8208;based heterocyclic acenes in contemporary multidisciplinary research and technological innovation.

         <title>Anion&#8208;&#960;+ AIEgens for Fluorescence Imaging and Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 27, May 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anion&#8208;&#960;+ AIEgens are drawing increasing attention for their distinct molecular packing in aggregate states. This concept summarizes the recently developed anion&#8208;&#960;+ AIEgens and their applications including fluorescence imaging and fluorescence imaging&#8208;guided photodynamic therapy against pathogenic bacteria and cancers, which will provide some guidelines and further promote the exploitation and clinical application of anion&#8208;&#960;+ AIEgens.







Abstract
Fluorescence imaging&#8208;guided photodynamic therapy (PDT) has attracted extensive attention due to its potential of real&#8208;time monitoring the lesion locations and visualizing the treatment process with high sensitivity and resolution. Aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogens (AIEgens) show enhanced fluorescence and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation after cellular uptake, giving them significant advantages in bioimaging and PDT applications. However, most AIEgens are unfavorable for the application in organisms due to their severe hydrophobicity. Anion&#8208;&#960;+ type AIEgens carry intrinsic charges that can effectively alleviate their hydrophobicity and improve their binding capability to cells, which is expected to enhance the bioimaging quality and PDT performance. This concept summarizes the applications of anion&#8208;&#960;+ type AIEgens in fluorescence imaging, fluorescence imaging&#8208;guided photodynamic anticancer and antimicrobial therapy in recent years, hoping to provide some new ideas for the construction of robust photosensitizers. Finally, the current problems and future challenges of anion&#8208;&#960;+ AIEgens are discussed.

         <title>Advances Toward Amphidinolides C, F and U: Isolations, Synthetic Studies and Total Syntheses</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 27, May 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amphidinolides C, F and U are a sub&#8208;class of polyketides sharing a similar structure, isolated from dinoflagellates or octocoral sponges and exhibiting high cytotoxic activity. This review discloses the progress made in their isolations and structural determinations and the various synthetic approaches and successful attempts leading to their total syntheses.







Abstract
Amphidinolides C, F, and U, including C2&#8208;C4 analogs, are highly cytotoxic marine macrolides, mainly isolated from dinoflagellates of the genus Amphidinium. All these polyketides share a 75&#8201;% or more similar structure, highlighted by a macrolactone ring, at least one trans&#8208;2,5&#8208;substituted&#8208;THF motif and a characteristic polyenic side chain. From their isolation and absolute configurational assignment, the total synthesis of these marine macrolides represented an intense challenge to the organic synthesis community over the last 15&#8197;years, with around 14 research groups engaged in this inspiring task. In the first part of this review, we present the different approaches to the isolation and characterization of these natural products, including the most recent analogs, which may cast doubt on the biogenetic origin of these compounds. The various synthetic approaches to the total synthesis of C, F, and U amphidinolides are presented in a second part, focusing on key reactions and/or innovative strategies. The review concludes in a third section summarizing the successful approaches leading to the total synthesis of one of the members of this amphidinolide subfamily.

         <title>Polymorphism Dependent Cytotoxicity, Cellular Uptake, and Live Cell Imaging Studies on Napthalimide&#8208;Vinyl&#8208;Phenothiazine Conjugate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymorphs serve as excellent models for illustrating the relationship between structure and properties, given their distinction lies primarily in the arrangement of constituents within a 3D lattice. While numerous researchers leverage this concept to elucidate the influence of molecular structure on chemical and physical properties, there remains a dearth of exploration into their biological response. This study presents two luminescent polymorphs, 1Y and 1R, identified as ideal candidates for observing polymorph&#8208;dependent cellular uptake and cytotoxicity using straightforward fluorescence microscopy techniques.







Abstract
Polymorphism&#8208;dependent cytotoxicity and cellular uptake of drug molecules have been studied for the past two decades. However, the visualization of polymorph&#8208;dependent cellular uptake and cytotoxicity using microscopy imaging techniques has not yet been reported. The luminescent polymorph is an ideal candidate to validate the above hypothesis. Herein, we report the polymorph&#8208;dependent cellular uptake, cytotoxicity, and bio&#8208;imaging functions of polymorphs 1Y and 1R of a naphthalimide&#8208;phenothiazine dyad. These polymorphs show different luminescence colors in the solid state and exhibit aggregation&#8208;induced enhanced emission (AIEE) in the DMSO&#8208;Water mixture. Bioimaging, cytotoxicity assay, and fluorescence&#8208;activated cell sorting (FACS) studies revealed that these polymorphs show different levels of cytotoxicity, cellular uptake, localization, and imaging potential. Detailed photophysical, morphological, and biological studies revealed that the difference in molecular conformation in these polymorphs enables them to form aggregates of different sizes and morphology, which leads to the differential uptake of these into the cells and consequently shows different cytotoxicity and imaging potentials.

Detailed photophysical, morphological, and biological studies revealed that the difference in molecular conformation in these polymorphs enables them to form aggregates of different sizes and morphology, which leads to the differential uptake of these into the cells and consequently shows different cytotoxicity and imaging potentials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Inducing &#945;&#8208;Helicity in Peptides by Silver Coordination to Cysteine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular switch based on metal complexation of peptides is here presented. The highly ordered dimeric &#945;&#8208;helical complexes are obtained by adding silver ions to specific peptide motifs containing two cysteine residues. The dynamic formation of these surprisingly stable complexes has been characterized by chromatographic, spectroscopic, potentiometric and mass spectrometric methods.







Abstract
Short peptide sequences consisting of two cysteine residues separated by three other amino acids display complete change from random coil to &#945;&#8208;helical secondary structure in response to addition of Ag+ ions. The folded CXXXC/Ag+ complex involves formation of multinuclear Ag+ species and is stable in a wide pH range from below 3 to above 8. The complex is stable through reversed&#8208;phase HPLC separation as well as towards a physiological level of chloride ions, based on far&#8208;UV circular dichroism spectroscopy. In electrospray MS under acidic conditions a peptide dimer with four Ag+ ions bound was observed, and modelling based on potentiometric experiments supported this to be the dominating complex at neutral pH together with a peptide dimer with 3&#8197;Ag+ and one proton at lower pH. The complex was demonstrated to work as a N&#8208;terminal nucleation site for inducing &#945;&#8208;helicity into longer peptides. This type of silver&#8208;mediated peptide assembly and folding may be of more general use for stabilizing not only peptide folding but also for controlling oligomerization even under acidic conditions.

         <title>Unidentical Twins: Geometrically Similar but Chemically Distinct Metal&#8208;Free Sites in Boron Oxide for Methane Oxidation to HCHO, CO and CO2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unidentical Twins: The B2O3 surface contains various geometrically similar sites to carry out methane oxidation in presence of dioxygen. Computational descriptors were employed to distinct these identical twin sites. In methane oxidation, the rate&#8208;determining step for one site is the co&#8208;activation of dioxygen and methane, whereas formaldehyde formation is the rate&#8208;determining step over the other site. These sites prefer the formation of CO over CO2.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;free boron&#8208;based catalysts such as boron oxide (B2O3) and boron nitride (h&#8208;BN) are promising catalysts for methane oxidation to HCHO and CO. The B2O3 catalyst contains various probable boron sites (B1 to B6), which may be responsible for methane oxidation. In this work, we utilized density functional theory to compare two relevant geometrically identical boron sites (B2 and B4) for their reactivities. The two sites are explored in&#8208;detail for the conversion of methane to formaldehyde (M2F), carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide. The B4 site activates the methane C&#8722;H bond easily as compared to the B2 site. In M2F conversion, the rate&#8208;determining step for the B2 site is the co&#8208;activation of dioxygen and methane, whereas over the B4 site, formaldehyde formation is the rate&#8208;determining step. The computationally&#8208;determined RDS for the B4 site coincides well with the reported experiments. It is further revealed that this site also prefers the formation of CO over CO2, which is in&#8208;line with the experiments in literature. It is also shown through orbital analysis that methanol formation does not occur during methane oxidation. We employed descriptors such as condensed Fukui functions and global electrophilicity index to chemically distinct these twin sites.

         <title>Highly Efficient and Thermally Durable Luminescence of 1D Eu3+ Coordination Polymers with Arsenic Bridging Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Luminescent Eu3+ coordination polymers bridged by bisarsine oxides exhibited intense emission even at 550&#8197;K. In addition, they showed heating&#8208;induced emission enhancement when heated from 300&#8197;K to 400&#8197;K.







Abstract
In this work, bisarsine oxides were evaluated as novel bridging ligands, aiming to develop practical and efficient luminescent lanthanide coordination polymers. We have synthesized one&#8208;dimensional (1D) Eu3+ coordination polymers that incorporate bisarsine oxide bridging ligands and hexafluoroacetylacetonate anions. These polymers exhibited a denser packing of chains compared to analogous polymers bridged with bisphosphine oxides. The coordination polymers demonstrated exceptional thermal stability and substantial emission quantum yields. Additionally, the bisarsine oxides induced a pronounced polarization effect, facilitating a sensitive electric dipole transition that yields considerably narrow band red emission. Remarkably, the Eu3+ coordination polymers with bisarsine oxides maintained intense emission even at 550&#8197;K. A distinctive feature of these polymers is their heating&#8208;induced emission enhancement observed when the temperature was increased from 300&#8197;K to 400&#8197;K.

         <title>Boosting Excited&#8208;State Energy Transfer by Anchoring Dipole Orientation in Binary Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence/J&#8208;Aggregate Assemblies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anchoring dipole orientation: In a binary nano&#8208;assembly, an anchoring effect between the energy donor (thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitter (2CzPN)) and the energy acceptor (J&#8208;aggregate of a cyanine dye (Cy&#8208;J)), has boosted the F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) process. This was achieved through fixing the parallel orientation of their transition dipole moments to enhance the orientation factor (&#954;2).







Abstract
F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) has been widely applied in fluorescence imaging, sensing and so on, while developing useful strategy of boosting FRET efficiency becomes a key issue that limits the application. Except optimizing spectral properties, promoting orientation factor (&#954;2) has been well discussed but rarely utilized for boosting FRET. Herein, we constructed binary nano&#8208;assembling of two thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters (2CzPN and DMAC&#8208;DPS) with J&#8208;type aggregate of cyanine dye (C8S4) as doping films by taking advantage of their electrostatic interactions. Time&#8208;resolved spectroscopic measurements indicated that 2CzPN/Cy&#8208;J films exhibit an order of magnitude higher kFRET than DMAC&#8208;DPS/Cy&#8208;J films. Further quantitative analysing on kFRET and kDET indicated higher orientation factor (&#954;2) in 2CzPN/Cy&#8208;J films play a key role for achieving fast kFRET, which was subsequently confirmed by anisotropic measurements. Corresponding DFT/TDDFT calculation revealed strong &#8220;two&#8208;point&#8221; electrostatic anchoring in 2CzPN/Cy&#8208;J films that is responsible for highly orientated transitions. We provide a new strategy for boosting FRET in nano&#8208;assemblies, which might be inspired for designing FRET&#8208;based devices of sensing, imaging and information encryption.

         <title>Trapping an Elusive Phosphanyl&#8208;Phosphaalumene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The attempted synthesis of a phosphaalumene is described. Due to the weak nature and high polarity of the P=Al &#960;&#8208;bond, this species undergoes intramolecular C&#8722;H bond activation of the &#946;&#8208;diketiminato ligand. The deleterious decomposition of this compound can be prevented by complexation with tetrahydrofuran, allowing for isolation of the Lewis acid&#8211;base adduct, which retains the reactivity of the P=Al &#960;&#8208;bond toward polar and non&#8208;polar substrates.

We describe our efforts to access a compound with an Al=P double bond by reaction of Al(Nacnac) towards [H2CN(Dipp)]2P(PCO) (Nacnac=HC[C(Me)N(Dipp)]2; Dipp=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3). Our observations are consistent with the formation of a transient phosphanyl&#8208;phosphaalumene at low temperatures (&#8722;70&#8201;&#176;C), however this species was found to readily undergo intramolecular C&#8722;H activation of the &#946;&#8208;diketiminato ligand upon warming to room temperature. The reactivity of the transient complex toward small molecules including dihydrogen, carbon dioxide, phosphaketenes, amines and silanes could be explored at low temperatures, showcasing that the target compound can react as both a frustrated Lewis pair (via the pendant phosphanyl moiety) or in hydroelementation reactions of the Al=P bond. The elusive target molecule could be trapped by addition of a Lewis base (tetrahydrofuran) affording an isolable molecular species that reacts in an analogous fashion to the base&#8208;free compound.

     alt="Trapping an Elusive Phosphanyl-Phosphaalumene"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The attempted synthesis of a phosphaalumene is described. Due to the weak nature and high polarity of the P=Al &#960;-bond, this species undergoes intramolecular C&#8722;H bond activation of the &#946;-diketiminato ligand. The deleterious decomposition of this compound can be prevented by complexation with tetrahydrofuran, allowing for isolation of the Lewis acid&#8211;base adduct, which retains the reactivity of the P=Al &#960;-bond toward polar and non-polar substrates.

         <title>Heteroatom&#8208;Promoted Polyhexagonal Saddle&#8208;Shaped Molecular Structures and their Supramolecular Coassembly with C60</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combined effect of sulphur&#8208;induced curvature and unification of aryl groups through borylation furnishes a potential saddle&#8208;shaped architecture to the polyaromatics 1 and 2 without introducing any heptagon. Heterocycle 1, with smaller concave&#8208;convex molecular surfaces, forms a superstructure with double columnar fullerenes C60 in the solid state.







Abstract
Molecules with curved architecture can exhibit unique optoelectronic properties due to the concave&#8208;convex &#960;&#8208;surface. However, synthesizing negatively curved saddle&#8208;shaped aromatic systems has been challenging due to the internal structural strain. Herein, we report the facile synthesis of two polyhexagonal molecular systems, 1 and 2, with saddle shape geometry by judiciously varying the aromatic moiety, avoiding the harsh synthetic methods as that of heptagonal aromatic saddle systems. The unique geometry preferences of B, N, and S furnish suitable curvature to the molecules, featuring saddle shape. The saddle geometry also enables them to interact with fullerene C60, and the supramolecular interactions of fullerene C60 with 1 and 2 modify their optoelectronic properties. Crystal structure analysis reveals that 1, with a small &#960;&#8208;surface, forms a double columnar array of fullerenes in the solid state. In contrast, 2 with a large &#960;&#8208;surface produces a supramolecular capsule entrapping two discrete fullerenes. The intermolecular interactions between B, N, S, and the aryl&#8208;&#960; surface of the host and C60 guest are the stabilizing factors for creating these supramolecular structures. Comprehensive computational, optical, and Raman spectroscopic studies establish the charge transfer interactions between B&#8722;N doped heterocycle host and fullerene C60 guest.

         <title>Insight into the MOtBu (M=Na, K)&#8208;Mediated Dehydrogenation of Dimethylamine&#8208;Borane and Transfer Hydrogenation of Nitriles to Primary Amines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A practical, operationally simple, and efficient protocol for the NaOtBu&#8208;mediated transfer hydrogenation of nitriles to the corresponding primary amines with a relatively unexplored sacrificial hydrogen source (dimethylamine borane) is reported. The reaction encompasses a broad substrate scope and furnishes good&#8208;to&#8208;excellent yields of the primary amines under solvent&#8208;free conditions.







Abstract
Selective synthesis of primary amines from nitriles is challenging in synthetic chemistry due to the possible en&#8208;route generation of various amines and imines. Herein, we report a practical and operationally simple MOtBu&#8208;mediated (M=Na, K) transfer hydrogenation of nitriles to the corresponding primary amines with a relatively unexplored sacrificial hydrogen source (dimethylamine borane). The strategy encompasses a broad substrate scope under transition metal&#8208;free conditions and does not require any solvent. The mechanistic investigation was performed with the aid of control experiments and spectroscopic studies. The GC analysis of the reaction mixture exhibited the evolution of the H2 gas. Additionally, detailed computational calculations were undertaken to shed light on the possible intermediates and transition states involved during the present protocol.

         <title>Ferromagnetically Coupled Chromium(III) Dimer Shows Luminescence and Sensitizes Photon Upconversion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tridentate chelate ligand allows both meridional and facial coordination of chromium(III) via controlled synthesis, giving either a mono&#8208; or a dinuclear chromium(III) complex. Both complexes show room&#8208;temperature luminescence in solution with sub&#8208;microsecond lifetimes, short enough to avoid quenching by air oxygen, but sufficiently long for energy transfer to a triplet annihilator.







Abstract
There has been much progress on mononuclear chromium(III) complexes featuring luminescence and photoredox activity, but dinuclear chromium(III) complexes have remained underexplored in these contexts until now. We identified a tridentate chelate ligand able to accommodate both meridional and facial coordination of chromium(III), to either access a mono&#8208; or a dinuclear chromium(III) complex depending on reaction conditions. This chelate ligand causes tetragonally distorted primary coordination spheres around chromium(III) in both complexes, entailing comparatively short excited&#8208;state lifetimes in the range of 400 to 800&#8197;ns in solution at room temperature and making photoluminescence essentially oxygen insensitive. The two chromium(III) ions in the dimer experience ferromagnetic exchange interactions that result in a high spin (S=3) ground state with a coupling constant of +9.3&#8197;cm&#8722;1. Photoinduced energy transfer from the luminescent ferromagnetically coupled dimer to an anthracene derivative results in sensitized triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation upconversion. Based on these proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle studies, dinuclear chromium(III) complexes seem attractive for the development of fundamentally new types of photophysics and photochemistry enabled by magnetic exchange interactions.

         <title>Indium(III)&#8208;Catalyzed Haloalkynylation Reaction of Alkynes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using main group halides as catalysts for the Haloalkynylation reaction enables the application of various haloacetylenes. By means of several experiments and quantum chemical calculations, two different reaction pathways can be proposed.







Abstract
Green chemistry strives for sustainability at the molecular level and is gaining increasing relevance in the development of chemical reactions. The haloalkynylation reaction is a highly atom&#8211;economical C&#8722;C coupling reaction that was previously only achieved using transition metal catalysts. It enables the introduction of an alkyne unit and a halogen atom into the target molecule. Herein, we present a haloalkynylation reaction catalyzed by indium(III) halides. The use of indium(III) bromide as a catalyst leads exclusively to the cis addition products with yields up to 86&#8201;%. In addition, iodoacetylenes can be applied for the first time for the haloalkynylation reaction of internal alkynes which is an important step forward in the development of industrially relevant and sustainable catalysts. In contrast to gold catalysis, which proceeds via a similar mechanism, the use of alkyl&#8208;substituted haloacetylenes as reagents is also possible. Based on 13C labeling experiments and quantum chemical calculations, we postulate two possible mechanisms for the indium(III)&#8208;catalyzed haloalkynylation reactions.

         <title>Dual Role of a Novel heteroleptic Cu(I) Complex in Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven CO2&#160;Reduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel mononuclear Cu(I) complex was synthesized via coordination with a benzoquinoxalin&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;one&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazole chelating diimine and the bis[(2&#8208;diphenylphosphino)phenyl] ether (DPEPhos), to target a new and efficient photosensitizer for photocatalytic CO2 reduction. The Cu(I) complex absorbs in the blue&#8208;green region of the visible spectrum, with a broad band having a maximum at 475 nm &#8232;(&#949; = 4500 M&#8208;1cm&#8208;1), which is assigned to the metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (MLCT) transition from the Cu(I) to the benzoquinoxalin&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;one moiety of the diimine. Surprisingly, photo&#8208;driven experiments for the CO2 reduction showed that this complex can undergo a photoinduced electron transfer with a sacrificial electron donor and accumulate electrons on the diimine backbone. Photo&#8208;driven experiments in a CO2 atmosphere revealed that this complex can not only act as a photosensitizer, when combined with an Fe(III)&#8208;porphyrin, but can also selectively produce CO from CO2. Thus, owing to its charge&#8208;accumulation properties, the non&#8208;innocent benzoquinoxalin&#8208;2&#8208;one based ligand enabled the development of the first copper(I)&#8208;based photocatalyst for CO2 reduction.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Comparative Studies Revealing the Contribution of TADF Activity of Organic Emitters Towards Efficient Electrochemiluminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemiluminescence (ECL) featuring thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) properties has attracted considerable interest, showcasing their potential for 100% exciton harvesting, which marks a significant advancement in the realm of organic ECL. However, the challenge of elucidating the precise contribution of TADF to the enhanced ECL efficiency arises due to the lack of comparative studies of organic compounds with or without efficient TADF properties. In this study, we present four carbazole&#8208;benzonitrile (Cz&#8208;BN) molecules possessing similar chemical structures and comparable exchange energy (&#916;EST). Despite their comparable properties, these compounds exhibited varying TADF efficiencies, warranting a closer examination of their underlying structural and electronic characteristics governing the optical properties. Consequently, intense ECL emission was only observed from 4CzBN with a remarkable TADF efficiency, underscoring the substantial difference in the ECL signal among molecules with comparable &#916;EST and similar spectral properties but varying TADF activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Progress in Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Photosensitizers for Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a rapidly growing discipline that is expected to become an encouraging noninvasive therapeutic strategy for cancer treatment. In the PDT process, an efficient intersystem crossing (ISC) process for photosensitizers from the singlet excited state (S1) to the triplet excited state (T1) is critical for the formation of cytotoxic reactive oxygen species and improvement of PDT performance. Thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) molecules featuring an extremely small singlet&#8211;triplet energy gap and an efficient ISC process represent an enormous breakthrough for the PDT process. Consequently, the development of advanced TADF photosensitizers has become increasingly crucial and pressing. The most recent developments in TADF photosensitizers aimed at enhancing PDT efficiency for bio&#8208;applications are presented in this review. TADF photosensitizers with water dispersibility, targeting ability, activatable ability, and two&#8208;photon excitation properties are highlighted. Furthermore, the future challenges and perspectives of TADF photosensitizers in PDT are proposed.</dc:description>

         <title>Conformational Analysis of (+)&#8208;Germacrene D&#8208;4&#8208;ol Using the Crystalline Sponge Method to Elucidate the Origin of its Instability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Unsaturated cyclic terpenes often exhibit instability due to the proximation of C=C bonds in the cyclic skeleton, leading to nonenzymatic degradation. In this study, the crystalline sponge (CS) method was employed for the X&#8208;ray conformational analysis of a minute amount of oily and cyclic terpene compound, (+)&#8208;germacrene D&#8208;4&#8208;ol, which was produced by a terpene synthase OILTS under in vitro conditions.&#160; The CS method revealed a reactive conformation of the cyclic terpene with proximal double bonds. Under weakly acidic in vivo conditions, OILTS gave four pseudo&#8208;natural products or artifacts. The CS method also elucidated the structures of these degraded compounds, proposing a degradation mechanism triggered by the transannular reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Tridentate Lewis Acids Based on Tribenzotriquinacene Chalices</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chalice&#8208;shaped tridentate poly&#8208;Lewis acids (PLA) based on the tribenzotriquinacene (TBTQ) scaffold have been synthesised. Stannylation of the alkyne units, attached via phenyl&#8208;spacers to the benzhydrylic positions to the TBTQ scaffold, with Me2NSnMe3 afforded the trimethyltin substituted TBTQ derivative. Replacement of these tin functions with other elements resulted in rigid boron&#8208; and aluminium&#8208;functionalised PLAs. More flexible PLAs were obtained by hydrometallation reactions of the terminal alkyne groups of 4b,8b,12b&#8208;tris((ethy&#173;nyl)phenyl)tribenzotriquinacene. The resulting poly&#8208;Lewis acids were tested for their acceptor abilities in host&#8208;guest experi&#173;ments with suitable bases. Preliminary tests with pyridine led to the synthesis of a large tridentate base with three pyridyl groups attached to a TBTQ backbone. Complexation of this Lewis base with the PLAs resulted in the formation of aggregates, which were studied in solution in more detail by 1H DOSY NMR experiments regarding their size. Further experiments were performed with the tridentate bases 1,4,7&#8208;trimethyl&#8208;1,4,7&#8208;triazacyclononane and tris((dimethylphosphino)&#173;methyl)&#173;phenyl&#173;si&#173;&#173;lane.</dc:description>

         <title>Regiodivergent Synthesis of 4&#8208; and 5&#8208;Sulfenyl Oxazoles from Alkynyl Thioethers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The regiodivergent synthesis of 4&#8208; and 5&#8208;sulfenyl oxazoles from 1,4,2&#8208;dioxazoles and alkynyl thioethers has been achieved. Gold&#8208;catalysed conditions are used to favour the formation of 5&#8208;sulfenyl oxazoles via &#946;&#8208;selective attack of the nitrenoid relative to the sulfenyl group. In contrast, 4&#8208;sulfenyl oxazoles are formed by &#945;&#8208;selective reaction under Br&#248;nsted acid conditions from the same substrates. The nature of stabilising gold&#8208;sulfur interactions have been investigated by natural bond orbital analysis, showing that the S&#8594;Au interactions are significantly stronger in the intermediate that favours the 5&#8208;sulfenyl oxazoles. A kinetic survey identifies catalyst inhibition processes. This study into the regiodivergent methods includes the development of telescoped annulation&#8208;oxidation protocols for regioselective access to oxazole sulfoxides and sulfones.</dc:description>

         <title>Ligand Basicity and Chelate Effects on Sulfur Insertion vs. Sulfur Reduction by Zinc Thiolate Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>4&#8208; and 5&#8208;coordinate zinc thiolate complexes supported either by bis(carboxamide)pyridine frameworks or by substituted tris(pyrazolyl)borate ligands react with elemental sulfur (S8) following two distinct pathways. Some zinc thiolate moieties insert sulfur atoms to form zinc polysulfanide complexes, while others reduce sulfur and oxidize the thiolate. Here, we compare the effects of ligand electronics, strain, and sterics for selecting the respective reaction pathway. These results show that chelating and electron&#8208;deficient thiolate ligands better stabilize persistent zinc&#8208;bound polysulfanide species.</dc:description>

         <title>Poly(ferrocenylsilane)&#8208;Based Redox&#8208;Active Artificial Organelles for Biomimetic Cascade Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Artificial organelles serve as functional counterparts to natural organelles, which are primarily employed to artificially replicate, restore, or enhance cellular functions. While most artificial organelles exhibit basic functions, we diverge from this norm by utilizing poly(ferrocenylmethylethylthiocarboxypropylsilane) microcapsules (PFC MCs) to construct multifunctional artificial organelles through water/oil interfacial self&#8208;assembly. Within these PFC MCs, enzymatic cascades are induced through active molecular exchange across the membrane to mimic the functions of enzymes in mitochondria. We harness the inherent redox properties of the PFC polymer, which forms the membrane, to facilitate in&#8208;situ redox reactions similar to those supported by the inner membrane of natural mitochondria. Subsequent studies have demonstrated the interaction between PFC MCs and living cell including extended lifespans within various cell types. We anticipate that functional PFC MCs have the potential to serve as innovative platforms for organelle mimics capable of executing specific cellular functions.</dc:description>

         <title>Coinage Metal Complexes of a Sterically Encumbered Anionic Pyridylborate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sterically loaded, anionic pyridine has been synthesized and utilized successfully in the stabilization of a homoleptic series of coinage metal complexes. &#160;The treatment of [4&#8208;(Ph3B)&#8208;2,6&#8208;Trip2Py]K (Trip =2,4,6&#8208;iPr3C6H2) with CuBr(PPh3), AgCl(PPh3) or AuCl(PPh3) (Py = pyridine) afforded the corresponding [4&#8208;(Ph3B)&#8208;2,6&#8208;Trip2Py]M(PPh3) (M = Au, Ag, Cu) complexes, via salt metathesis, as isolable, crystalline solids.&#160; Notably, these reactions avoid the facile single electron transfer chemistry reported with the less bulky ligand systems.&#160; The X&#8208;ray structures revealed that they are two&#8208;coordinate metal adducts.&#160; The M&#8208;N and M&#8208;P bond distances are longest in the silver and shortest in the copper adduct among the three group 11 family members. &#160;Computational analysis revealed an interesting stability dependence on steric bulk of the anionic pyridine (i.e., pyridyl borate) ligand.&#160; A comparison of structures and bonding of [4&#8208;(Ph3B)&#8208;2,6&#8208;Trip2Py]Au(PPh3) to pyridine and m&#8208;terphenyl complexes, {[2,6&#8208;Trip2Py]Au(PPh3)}[SbF6] and [2,6&#8208;Trip2Ph]Au(PPh3) are also provided.&#160; The Au(I) isocyanide complex, [4&#8208;(Ph3B)&#8208;2,6&#8208;Trip2Py]Au(CNBut) has been stabilized using the same anionic pyridylborate illustrating that it can support other gold&#8208;ligand moieties as well.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>(Z)&#8208;alkenes are useful synthons but thermodynamically less stable than their (E)&#8208;isomers and typically more difficult to prepare. The synthesis of 1,4&#8208;hetero&#8208;bifunctionalized (Z)&#8208;alkenes is particularly challenging due to the inherent regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity issues. Herein we demonstrate a general, chemoselective and direct synthesis of (Z)&#8208;2&#8208;butene&#8208;1,4&#8208;diol monoesters. The protocol operates within a Pd&#8208;catalyzed decarboxylative acyloxylation regime involving vinyl ethylene carbonates (VECs) and various carboxylic acids as the reaction partners under mild and operationally attractive conditions. The newly developed process allows access to a structurally diverse pool of (Z)&#8208;2&#8208;butene&#8208;1,4&#8208;diol monoesters in good yields and with excellent regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity. Various synthetic transformations of the obtained (Z)&#8208;2&#8208;butene&#8208;1,4&#8208;diol monoesters demonstrate how these synthons are of great use to rapidly diversify the portfolio of these formal desymmetrized (Z)&#8208;alkenes.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The effective transition metal&#8208;free photoredox/bismuth dual catalytic reductive dialkylation of nitroarenes with benzaldehydes has been reported. The nitroarene redution through visible light&#8208;driven photoredox catalysis was integrated with subsequent reductive dialkylation of anilines under bismuth catalysis to enable the cascade reductive alkylation of nitroarenes with carbonyls. Salient features of this relay catalysis system include mild reaction conditions, no requirement for transition metal catalysts, easy handling, step&#8208;economy, and high selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Bispidine based Hg(II) 1D Coordination Polymers of Helical Topology: Stability, Selective Adsorption and 1D to 2D Dimensionality Change via SC&#8208;to&#8208;SC Transformation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bispidine based Hg(II) coordination polymers of helical topology&#160; CP&#8208;MeOH and CP&#8208;EtOH are almost isostructural (they mainly differ for the solvent included in their lattice and by a small % in unit cell parameters) but they differ for everything else: i) their intrinsic stability, ii) their ability to adsorb solvents upon prior evacuation, iii) their accessible structural transformations. In particular, one of the two starting materials, once evacuated, is capable to adsorb methanol from atmospheres containing binary and ternary mixtures of volatile organic compounds (MeOH, CHCl3 and EtOH) under ambient conditions (25 &#176;C, 1 atm) and with a marked selectivity. The other one is not, but undergoes a 1D to 2D dimensionality change which can be monitored in situ by SC&#8208;XRD through a SC&#8208;to&#8208;SC process.</dc:description>

         <title>Two&#8208;Phase Electrosynthesis of Dihydroxycoumestans: Discovery of a New Scaffold for Topoisomerase I poison</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Coumestan represents a biologically relevant structural motif distributed in a number of natural products, and the rapid construction of related derivatives as well as the characterization of targets would accelerate lead compound discovery in medicinal chemistry. In this work, a general and scalable approach to 8,9&#8208;dihydroxycoumestans via two&#8208;electrode constant current electrolysis was developed. The application of a two&#8208;phase (aqueous/organic) system plays a crucial role for success, protecting the sensitive o&#8208;benzoquinone intermediates from over&#8208;oxidation. Based on the structurally diverse products, a primary SAR study on coumestan scaffold was completed, and compound 3r exhibited potent antiproliferative activities and a robust topoisomerase I (Top1) inhibitory activity. Further mechanism studies demonstrates that compound 3r was a novel Top1 poison, which might open an avenue for the development of Top1&#8208;targeted antitumor agent.</dc:description>

         <title>Bioorthogonal Cycloadditions of C3&#8208;Trifluoromethylated 1,2,4&#8208;Triazines with trans&#8208;Cyclooctenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>1,2,4&#8208;triazines are a valuable class of heterodienes that can be employed in inverse electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder reactions. However, their broader application in bioorthogonal chemistry is limited due to their low reactivity. This article focuses on 3&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazines, which can be efficiently prepared in a one&#8208;pot reaction from NH&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazoles. These triazines are highly reactive in reactions with strained cyclooctenes, giving second&#8208;order rate constants as high as 230 M&#8211;1 s&#8211;1. Despite their high reactivity, the compounds remain sufficiently stable under biologically relevant conditions. We show that some of the compounds are fluorogenic, a property of potential use in bioimaging. In addition, we demonstrate the successful application of the triazines in labeling model biomolecules. Our work shows that the reactivity of 1,2,4&#8208;triazines can be enhanced by the 3&#8208;CF3&#8208;substitution, which we consider an important step toward the wider use of this promising class of reagents.</dc:description>

         <title>Influence of chemical modifications of the crystallophore on protein nucleating properties and supramolecular interactions network.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Crystallophores are lanthanide complexes that have demonstrated outstanding induction of crystallization for various proteins. This article explores the effect of tailored modifications of the crystallophore first generation and their impact on the nucleating properties, and protein crystal structures. Through high&#8208;throughput crystallization experiments and dataset analysis, we evaluated the effectiveness of these variants, in comparison to the first crystallophore generation G1. In particular, the V1variant, featuring a propanol pendant arm, demonstrated the ability to produce new crystallization conditions for the proteins tested (hen&#8208;egg white lysozyme, proteinase K and thaumatin). Structural analysis performed in the case of hen egg&#8208;white lysozyme along with Molecular Dynamics simulations, highlights V1's unique behavior, taking advantage of the flexibility of its propanol arm to explore different protein surfaces and form versatile supramolecular interactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Unlocking Photocatalytic Activity of Acridinium Salts by Anion&#8208;Binding Co&#8208;Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The in situ generation of active photoredox organic catalysts upon anion&#8208;binding co&#8208;catalysis by making use of the ionic nature of common photosensitizers is reported. Hence, the merge of anion&#8208;binding and photocatalysis permitted the modulation of the photocatalytic activity of simple acridinium halide salts, building an effective anion&#8208;binding &#8211; photoredox ion pair complex able to promote a variety of visible light driven transformations, such as anti&#8208;Markovnikov addition to olefins, Diels&#8208;Alder and the desilylative C&#8208;C bond formatting reactions. Anion&#8208;binding studies, together with steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved spectroscopy analysis, supported the postulated ion pair formation between the thiourea hydrogen&#8208;bond donor organocatalyst and the acridinium salt, which proved essential for unlocking the photocatalytic activity of the photosensitizer.</dc:description>

         <title>sAPP&#945; Peptide Promotes Damaged Microglia to Clear Alzheimer&#8217;s Amyloid&#8208;&#946; via Restoring Mitochondrial Function</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age&#8208;related neurodegenerative disease with amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) deposition as the main pathological feature. It&#8217;s an important challenge to find new ways to clear A&#946; from Brain. The soluble amyloid precursor protein &#945; (sAPP&#945;) is a neuroprotective protein and can attenuate neuronal damage, including toxic A&#946;. However, the regulatory role of sAPP&#945; in non&#8208;neuronal cells, such as microglia, is less reported and controversial. Here, we showed that sAPP&#945; promoted the phagocytosis and degradation of A&#946; in both normal and damaged microglia. Moreover, the function of damaged microglia was improved by the sAPP&#945; through normalizing mitochondrial function. Furthermore, the results of molecular docking simulation showed that sAPP&#945; had a good affinity with A&#946;. We preliminarily reveal that sAPP&#945; is similar to antibodies and can participate in the regulation of microglia phagocytosis and degradation of A&#946; after binding to A&#946;. sAPP&#945; is expected to be a mild and safe peptide drug or drug carrier for AD.</dc:description>

         <title>Keplerate&#8208;Type Polyoxometalates&#8208;Based Triboelectric Nanogenerator for Higher Performance via the Morphology Modulation of Blackberry Structure</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The triboelectric material is the key factor affecting the performance of triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs). Inorganic materials have higher heat resistance and stability than widely used organic materials. However, the weaker triboelectric property limits the application of TENGs. Modulating surface roughness by changing particle shape and size is a simple way to increase performance for TENGs. Polyoxometalates (POMs) have unrivalled structural diversity and can self&#8208;assemble to form different nanostructures. In this study, we propose [{(NH4)42[Mo72VIMo60VO372(CH3COO)30(H2O)7.ca.300H2O.ca.CH3COONH4)]}&#8208;Mo132] and [{Na8K14(VO)2[{(MoVI)(Mo5VIO21)(H2O)3]}10{(MoVI)Mo5VIO21(H2O)3(SO4)}2{VIVO(H2O)20}{VIVO}10({KSO4}5)2]&#183;150H2O)}&#8208;Mo72V30] with blackberry structure which are cured and prepared into film by spin&#8208;coating technique, are used as triboelectric positive materials for the first time in the field of TENGs. Keplerate&#8208;type polyoxometalates can form blackberry structures with higher dispersibility and flexibility, which can be used to control surface roughness by regulating the size of particles. The discovery proves that the particle size influences the surface roughness, which adjusts the output of TENGs. According to our findings, Mo132&#8208;h&#8208;TENG generates an output voltage of 29.3 V, an output charge of 8 nC 2&#8208;3 folds higher than Mo132&#8208;TENG, and a maximum power density of 6.25 mW&#183;m&#8208;2 at 300 M&#937;. Our research provides that altering the dimensional size can be an available way to raise the output of TENGs.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Carbene Transfer: Enhancing Chemical Diversity for Drug Discovery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The exploration of chemical space for disease targets is of paramount importance. However, the current repertoire of chemically synthesized compounds, numbering around 108, merely scratches the surface in comparison to the theoretical diversity of 1060. Organic chemists are actively engaged in pioneering methodologies to expand this constrained space. Among these innovative approaches, Asymmetric Carbene Transfer (ACT) emerges as a potent strategy for enhancing molecular diversity. This article critically examines the efficacy of ACT in synthesizing pharmaceutically relevant molecules, encompassing natural products and bioactive compounds. We highlight its pivotal role in the synthesis of 25 compounds. By unraveling the diverse applications of ACT, this review illuminates its potential impact on drug discovery. Furthermore, we propose future methodology directions, contributing to the ongoing discourse within the medicinal chemistry community. In summary, this review article navigates the landscape of ACT, showcasing its prowess in expanding chemical space for drug discovery. Through a nuanced exploration of its applications and a forward&#8208;looking approach, we contribute to the collective understanding of ACT's potential and chart a course for future advancements in ACT for drug discovery.</dc:description>

         <title>A Broadened Class of Donor&#8208;Acceptor Stacked Macrometallacyclic Adducts of Different Coinage Metals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A yet&#8208;outstanding supramolecular chemistry challenge is isolation of novel varieties of stacked complexes with fine&#8208;tuned donor&#8208;acceptor bonding and optoelectronic properties, as herein reported for binary adducts comprising two different cyclic trinuclear complexes (CTC@CTC&#8217;). Most previous attempts focused only on 1&#8208;2 factors among metal/ligand/substituent combinations, resulting in heterobimetallic complexes. Instead, here we show that, when all 3 factors are carefully considered, a broadened variety of CTC@CTC&#8217; stacked pairs with intuitively&#8208;enhanced intertrimer coordinate&#8208;covalent bonding strength and ligand&#8208;ligand/metal&#8208;ligand dispersion are attained (dM&#8211;M&#8217; 2.868(2) &#197;; &#916;E &gt; 50 kcal/mol, an order of magnitude higher than aurophilic interactions). Significantly, CTC@CTC&#8217; pairs remain intact/strongly&#8208;bound even in solution (Keq 4.67&#215;105 L/mol via NMR/UV&#8208;vis titrations), and the gas phase (mass spectrometry revealing molecular peaks for the entire CTC@CTC&#8217; units in sublimed samples), rather than simple co&#8208;crystal formation. Photo&#8208;/electro&#8208;luminescence studies unravel metal&#8208;centered phosphorescence useful for novel optoelectronic device concepts. This work manifests systematic design of supramolecular bonding and multi&#8208;faceted spectral properties of pure metal&#8208;organic macrometallacyclic donor/acceptor (inorganic/inorganic) stacks with remarkably&#8208;rich optoelectronic properties akin to well&#8208;established organic/organic and organic/inorganic analogues.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorination/dearomatization of C6F5 groups: An FLP route to an electrophilic borane and non&#8208;coordinating anions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>B(C6F5)3 and the corresponding anion [B(C6F5)4]&#8722; are ubiquitous in main group and transition metal chemistry. Known derivatives are generally limited to the incorporation of electron donating substituents. Herein we describe electrophilic fluorination and dearomatization of such species using XeF2 in the presence of BF3 or Lewis acidic cations. In this fashion the anions [HB(C6F5)3]&#8722;, [B(C6F5)4]&#8722; and [(C6F5)3BC&#8801;NB(C6F5)3]&#8722;, are converted to [HB(C6F7)3]&#8722;, [B(C6F7)4]&#8722;, and [(C6F7)3BC&#8801;NB(C6F7)3]&#8722;, respectively. Similarly, the borane adducts (L)B(C6F7)3 (L = MeCN, OPEt3) are produced. These rare examples of electrophilic attack of electron deficient rings proceed as [XeF][BF4] acts as a frustrated Lewis pair effecting fluorination and dearomatization of C6F5 rings.</dc:description>

         <title>Zn promoted GaZrOx ternary solid solution oxide combined with SAPO&#8208;34 effectively converts CO2 to light olefins with low CO selectivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We proposed a new strategy for CO2 hydrogenation to prepare light olefins by introducing Zn into GaZrOx to construct ZnGaZrOx ternary oxides, which was combined with SAPO&#8208;34 to prepare a high&#8208;performance ZnGaZrOx/SAPO&#8208;34 tandem catalyst for CO2 hydrogenation to light olefins. By optimizing the Zn doping content, the ratio and mode of the two&#8208;phase composite, and the process conditions, the 3.5%ZnGaZrOx/SAPO&#8208;34 tandem catalyst showed excellent catalytic performance and good high&#8208;temperature inhibition of the reverse water&#8208;gas shift (RWGS) reaction. The catalyst achieved 26.6% CO2 conversion, 82.1% C2=&#8208;C4= selectivity and 11.8% light olefins yield. The ZnGaZrOx formed by introducing an appropriate amount of Zn into GaZrOx significantly enhanced the spillover H2 effect and also induced the generation of abundant oxygen vacancies to effectively promote the activation of CO2. Importantly, the RWGS reaction was also significantly suppressed at high temperatures, with the CO selectivity being only 46.1% at 390&#176;C.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanochemical Regioselective [3+3] Annulation of 6&#8208;Amino Uracil with Propargyl Alcohols Catalyzed by a Br&#248;nsted Acid/Hexafluoroisopropanol</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A mechanochemistry approach is developed for regioselective synthesis of functionalized dihydropyrido[2,3&#8208;d]pyrimidines by milling propargylic alcohols and 6&#8208;amino uracils with HFIP/p&#8208;TsOH. In the case of tert&#8208;propargyl alcohols, this [3+3] cascade annulation proceeded through allenylation of uracil followed by a 6&#8208;endo trig cyclization. With sec&#8208;propargyl alcohols, the reaction furnished the propargylation of uracil. This atom economy ball milling reaction allows access to a broad range of dihydropyrido[2,3&#8208;d]pyrimidine derivatives in excellent yields. We demonstrated the gram scale synthesis of 3g and post&#8208;synthetic modifications to effect the cyclization of 5 to 6.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Lanthanide&#8208;Organic Framework as an Efficient Heterogeneous Catalyst for Cycloaddition of CO2 with Epoxides and Knoevenagel Condensation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multimetallic synergistic effects have the potential to improve CO2 cycloesterification and Knoevenagel reaction processes, outperforming monometallic MOFs. The results demonstrate superior performance in these processes. To investigate this, we created and characterized a selection of single&#8208;component Ln(III)&#8208;MOFs (Ln = Eu, Tb, Gd, Dy, Ho) and high&#8208;entropy lanthanide&#8208;organic framework (HE&#8208;LnMOF) using solvent&#8208;thermal conditions. The experiments revealed that HE&#8208;LnMOF exhibited heightened catalytic efficiency in CO2 cycloesterification and Knoevenagel reactions compared to single&#8208;component Ln(III) MOFs. Moreover, the HE&#8208;LnMOF displayed significant stability, maintaining their structural integrity after five cycles while sustaining elevated conversion and selectivity rates. The feasible mechanisms of catalytic reactions were also discussed. HE&#8208;LnMOF possess multiple unsaturated metal centers, acting as Lewis acid sites, with oxygen atoms connecting the metal, and hydroxyl groups on the ligand serving as base sites. This study introduces a novel method for synthesizing HE&#8208;LnMOF and presents a fresh application of HE&#8208;LnMOF for converting CO2.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of Nanoflower&#8208;Like Zn2SnS4 as Nanozymes for Highly Sensitive Electrochemical Detection of H2O2 Released by Living Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zn2SnS4 nanoflowers with high uniformity and a large surface area were synthesized using a facile one&#8208;pot hydrothermal method without the use of any template precursors. Utilizing macrophages differentiated from leukemia THP&#8208;1 cells as a representative sensing model, an electrochemical sensor based on the Zn2SnS4 nanoflowers was successfully fabricated for real&#8208;time monitoring of H2O2 release from living cells induced by LPS.







Abstract
The sensitive and reliable nanozyme&#8208;based sensor enables the detection of low concentrations of H2O2 in biological microenvironments, it has potential applications as an in&#8208;situ monitoring platform for cellular H2O2 release. The uniformly dispersed bimetallic sulfide (Zn2SnS4) nanoflowers were synthesized via a one&#8208;pot hydrothermal method and the two kinds of metal ions can serve as morphology and structure directing agents for each other in the synthetic process. The nanoparticles were utilized as nanozyme materials to fabricate a novel electrochemical sensor, and it exhibits a distinct electrochemical response towards H2O2 with excellent stability and detection capability (with a minimum detection limit of 1.79&#8197;nM (S/N=3)), the excellent characteristics facilitate the precise detection of low concentrations of H2O2 in biological microenvironments. Use the macrophages differentiated from leukemia THP&#8208;1 cells as a representative sensing model, the sensor was successfully utilized for real&#8208;time monitoring of the release of H2O2 induced by living cells, which has significant potential applications in clinical diagnosis and cancer treatment.

&lt;p&gt;Zn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SnS&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; nanoflowers with high uniformity and a large surface area were synthesized using a facile one-pot hydrothermal method without the use of any template precursors. Utilizing macrophages differentiated from leukemia THP-1 cells as a representative sensing model, an electrochemical sensor based on the Zn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SnS&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; nanoflowers was successfully fabricated for real-time monitoring of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; release from living cells induced by LPS.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sensitive and reliable nanozyme-based sensor enables the detection of low concentrations of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in biological microenvironments, it has potential applications as an in-situ monitoring platform for cellular H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; release. The uniformly dispersed bimetallic sulfide (Zn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SnS&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) nanoflowers were synthesized via a one-pot hydrothermal method and the two kinds of metal ions can serve as morphology and structure directing agents for each other in the synthetic process. The nanoparticles were utilized as nanozyme materials to fabricate a novel electrochemical sensor, and it exhibits a distinct electrochemical response towards H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with excellent stability and detection capability (with a minimum detection limit of 1.79&#8197;nM (S/N=3)), the excellent characteristics facilitate the precise detection of low concentrations of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in biological microenvironments. Use the macrophages differentiated from leukemia THP-1 cells as a representative sensing model, the sensor was successfully utilized for real-time monitoring of the release of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; induced by living cells, which has significant potential applications in clinical diagnosis and cancer treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Sequential, Electrochemical&#8208;Photochemical Synthesis of 1,2,4&#8208;Triazolo&#8208;[4,3&#8208;a]pyrazines</title>

         <dc:description>
The electrochemical coupling of tetrazole species with 2,6&#8208;dimethoxypyrazine, followed by UV cyclization has resulted in an effective means for the synthesis of 1,2,4&#8208;triazolo&#8208;[4,3&#8208;a]pyrazine.







Abstract
1,2,4&#8208;triazolo&#8208;[4,3&#8208;a]pyrazine was prepared via a two&#8208;step electrochemical, photochemical process. First, a 5&#8208;substituted tetrazole is electrochemically coupled to 2,6&#8208;dimethoxypyrazine to yield 1,5&#8208; and 2,5&#8208; disubstituted tetrazoles. Subsequent photochemical excitation of the 2,5&#8208;disubstituted tetrazole species using an ultraviolet lamp releases nitrogen gas and produces a short&#8208;lived nitrilimine intermediate. Subsequent cyclization of the nitrilimine intermediate yields a 1,2,4&#8208;triazolo&#8208;[4,3&#8208;a]pyrazine backbone. The scope of this reaction was explored using various tetrazoles and pyrazines. Materials produced were identified using chemical analytical techniques and computationally studied for potential application as an insensitive energetic material.

         <title>Linear, Planar, Orbicular, and Macrocyclic Multinuclear Zinc (Meth)acrylate Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The diverse structures of zinc (meth)acrylate are present herein. The linear polymeric structure consisting of dinuclear repeating units of zinc (meth)acrylate is converted to a Zn4 cluster upon treating with ZnO. Recrystallization of zinc acrylate from a hydrous solvent affords a sheet&#8208;like structure consisting of Zn5 repeating units bridged by two &#956;3&#8208;OH, whereas zinc methacrylate affords a cyclic Zn12 structure supported by methacrylato ligands.







Abstract
Zinc carboxylate complexes are widely utilized as artificial models of metalloenzymes and as secondary building units of PCPs/MOFs. However, the relationship between the structure of the monodentate carboxylato ligand and the molecular arrangement of multinuclear zinc carboxylate complexes is not fully understood because of the coordination flexibility of the Zn ion and carboxylato ligands. Herein, we report the structural analysis of a series of complexes derived from zinc (meth)acrylate which has a linear infinite chain structure. The molecular structure of &#956;4&#8208;oxido&#8208;bridged tetranuclear complexes [Zn4(&#956;4&#8208;O)(OCOR)6] revealed a distorted Zn4O core. Crystallization of zinc acrylate under aqueous conditions afforded a &#956;3&#8208;hydroxido&#8208;containing pentanuclear complex [Zn5(&#956;3&#8208;OH)2(OCOR)8] as the repeating unit of an infinite sheet&#8208;like structure in the solid state. It was also obtained by the hydrolysis of the &#956;4&#8208;oxido&#8208;bridged tetranuclear complex. In sharp contrast, the methacrylate analog retained the methacrylato ligands under aqueous crystallization conditions to form a macrocyclic dodecanuclear complex with methacrylato as the sole ligand.

         <title>In Situ Diazonium Salt Formation and Photochemical Aryl&#8211;Aryl Coupling in Continuous Flow Monitored by Inline NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Soluble aryl diazonium trifluoroacetates are introduced for safe photochemical aryl&#8211;aryl coupling to produce industrially relevant biphenyls, even on a gram scale. While conventional diazonium tetrafluoroborates fail, this mild synthesis requires no catalysts but only UV&#8208;A light to generate aryl radicals for direct C&#8722;H arylation of various arenes. By implementing a capillary flow photoreactor, 13 biphenyl derivatives were synthesised and quantified by real&#8208;time 19F NMR spectroscopy as an in&#8208;line PAT tool. More information can be found in the Research Article by C. Deckers and T.&#8197;H. Rehm (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202303692).

Stimuli&#8208;responsive click chemistry implements molecular switches within host&#8208;guest complexes, allowing non&#8208;covalent ligation of molecular fragments and external stimulation of bound/unbound constitutional states. With selected examples, we show that these supramolecular systems are ideal candidates for stimuli&#8208;controlled molecular conjugation, thereby advancing efforts towards a more function&#8208;oriented chemical synthesis.







Abstract
Click chemistry has reached its maturity as the weapon of choice for the irreversible ligation of molecular fragments, with over 20&#8197;years of research resulting in the development or improvement of highly efficient kinetically controlled conjugation reactions. Nevertheless, traditional click reactions can be disadvantageous not only in terms of efficiency (side products, slow kinetics, air/water tolerance, etc.), but also because they completely avoid the possibility to reversibly produce and control bound/unbound states. Recently, non&#8208;covalent click chemistry has appeared as a more efficient alternative, in particular by using host&#8208;guest self&#8208;assembled systems of high thermodynamic stability and kinetic lability. This review discusses the implementation of molecular switches in the development of such non&#8208;covalent ligation processes, resulting in what we have termed stimuli&#8208;responsive click chemistry, in which the bound/unbound constitutional states of the system can be favored by external stimulation, in particular using host&#8208;guest complexes. As we exemplify with handpicked selected examples, these supramolecular systems are well suited for the development of human&#8208;controlled molecular conjugation, by coupling thermodynamically regulated processes with appropriate temporally resolved extrinsic control mechanisms, thus mimicking nature and advancing our efforts to develop a more function&#8208;oriented chemical synthesis.

         <title>Indenoannulated Tridecacyclene: An All&#8208;Carbon Seven&#8208;Stage Redox&#8208;Amphoter</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Charge it up: Indenoannulation of tridecacyclene afforded a saddle&#8208;shaped nanocarbon with one octagonal and multiple pentagonal rings. The compound can undergo seven reversible redox events (highlighted as electron flashes), facilitated by the aromatic stabilization provided by the non&#8208;benzenoid moieties in charged states (glowing non&#8208;hexagonal rings). The colors of the circles around the electrons are based on the color of the dication and dianion in solution. More information can be found in the Research Article by M. Kivala and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202400696).

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Charge it up&lt;/b&gt;: Indenoannulation of tridecacyclene afforded a saddle-shaped nanocarbon with one octagonal and multiple pentagonal rings. The compound can undergo seven reversible redox events (highlighted as electron flashes), facilitated by the aromatic stabilization provided by the non-benzenoid moieties in charged states (glowing non-hexagonal rings). The colors of the circles around the electrons are based on the color of the dication and dianion in solution. More information can be found in the Research Article by M. Kivala and co-workers (DOI: &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/chem.202400696"&gt;10.1002/chem.202400696&lt;/a&gt;).

         <title>Cross&#8208;Coupling Between Aryl Halides and Aryl Alkynes Catalyzed by an Odd Alternant Hydrocarbon</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A super&#8208;reduced odd alternant hydrocarbon based on phenalenyl unit acts as a catalyst for cross&#8208;coupling between aryl halides and aryl alkynes synthesizing a rich library of internal alkynes without any external stimuli. This protocol was extended to accomplish the Sonogashira&#8208;type coupling under transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free and solvent&#8208;free conditions.







Abstract
Catalytic cross&#8208;coupling between aryl halides and alkynes is considered an extremely important organic transformation (popularly known as the Sonogashira coupling) and it requires a transition metal&#8208;based catalyst. Accomplishing such transformation without any transition metal&#8208;based catalyst in the absence of any external stimuli such as heat, photoexcitation or cathodic current is highly challenging. This work reports transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free cross&#8208;coupling between aryl halides and alkynes synthesizing a rich library of internal alkynes without any external stimuli. A chemically double&#8208;reduced phenalenyl (PLY)&#8208;based molecule with the super&#8208;reducing property was employed for single electron transfer to activate aryl halides generating reactive aryl radicals, which subsequently react with alkyne. This protocol covers not only various types of aryl, heteroaryl and polyaryl halides but also applies to a large variety of aromatic alkynes at room temperature. With a versatile substrate scope successfully tested on more than 75 entries, this radical&#8208;mediated pathway has been explained by several control experiments. All the key reactive intermediates have been characterized with spectroscopic evidence. Detailed DFT calculations have been instrumental in portraying the mechanistic pathway. Furthermore, we have successfully extended this transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free catalytic strategy for the first time towards solvent&#8208;free cross&#8208;coupling between solid aryl halide and alkyne substrates.

         <title>64Cu Tumor Labeling with Hexadentate Picolinic Acid&#8208;Based Bispidine Immunoconjugates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bispidine picolinates quickly form very stable complexes with the positron emitter 64CuII under physiological conditions. These bifunctional chelators can be easily attached to amino&#8208;terminated tumor&#8208;seeking target modules. The subsequent 64Cu labeling is fast and efficient, and does not require demanding purification steps. These compounds have great potential for the development of copper&#8208;labeled radiopharmaceuticals. More information can be found in the Research Article by M. Kubeil, P. Comba, H. Stephan and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202400366).

         <dc:description>
This cover is dedicated to a special collection of works by colleagues and friends of Prof. Miquel Sol&#224; in honor of his 60th birthday. The artwork captures the main scientific interests of Professor Sol&#224;, including molecular aromaticity, chemical bonding analysis, and organic reaction mechanisms. His research explores new forms of aromaticity, such as three&#8208;dimensional and excited state aromaticity, and the reactivity of fullerenes and endohedral metallofullerenes. More information can be found in the Guest Editorial by A.&#8197;J. Stasyuk, J. Poater, and H. Ottosson (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202401206). The cover was designed by S&#237;lvia Osuna.

         <dc:description>Thanks to the ability of diazo derivatives to react either as 1,3&#8208;dipoles and as carbenes after dinitrogen extrusion, combinations of oxa or aza benzonorbornadienes and diazomalonates afford polycyclic pyrazolidines via a three&#8208;step sequence of (i) a highly diastereoselective [3+2]&#8208;cycloaddition, (ii) a CpRu&#8208;catalyzed carbene addition, and (iii) a second dipolar cycloaddition. Of importance, step (II) represents a unique access to novel bench&#8208;stable N,N&#8208;cyclic azomethine imines, which behave as effective 1,3&#8208;dipoles in combination with electron&#8208;poor dipolarophiles. Each step proceeds efficiently and the 3&#8208;step process can be performed in one&#8208;pot to yield a polycyclic pyrazolidine in excellent overall yield (90%).</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of (Hetero)biaryls via Nickel Catalyzed Reductive Cross&#8208;Electrophile Coupling Between (Hetero)aryl Iodides and Bromides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>(Hetero)biaryls are fundamental building blocks in the pharmaceutical industry and rapid access to these scaffolds is imperative for the success of numerous medicinal chemistry campaigns. Herein, a highly general, mild, and chemoselective reductive cross&#8208;electrophile coupling between (hetero)aryl iodides and heteroaryl bromides is reported. By employing more reactive (hetero)aryl halides, a broad range of successful substrates (45&#160;examples) were identified. The reaction was also found to be chemoselective for C(sp2)&#8211;C(sp2) bond formation between (hetero)aryl iodides and bromides over (hetero)aryl chlorides, which were generally inert under the described reaction conditions. The efficiency of the procedure is also further demonstrated in parallel synthesis library format, on gram scale, as well as in the formal synthesis of Ruxolitinib, a potent JAK inhibitor. As such, we anticipate this method will find widespread utility in the assembly of (hetero)biaryls for medicinal chemistry efforts.</dc:description>

         <title>The Role of Lysozyme in the Formation of Bioinspired Silicon Dioxide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Several organisms are able to polycondensate tetraoxosilicic(IV) acid to form silicon (IV) dioxide using polycationic molecules. According to an earlier mechanistic proposal, these molecules undergo a phase&#8208;separation and recent experimental evidence appears to confirm this model. At the same time, polycationic proteins like lysozyme can also promote polycondensation of silicon (IV) dioxide, and they do so under conditions that are not compatible with liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation. In this manuscript we investigate this conundrum by molecular simulations.

         <title>Effect of Br&#248;nsted Acids on the Activation of Mixed Anhydride/Mixed Carbonic Anhydride and C&#8208;Terminal&#8208;Free N&#8208;Methylated Peptide Synthesis in a Micro&#8208;Flow Reactor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Amidations employing mixed (carbonic) anhydrides have long been favoured in peptide synthesis because of their cost&#8208;effectiveness and less waste generation. Despite their long history, no study has compared the effects of additives on the activation of mixed anhydrides and carbonic anhydrides. In this study, we investigated the amidation of mixed (carbonic) anhydride in the presence of a base and/or Br&#248;nsted acids. The use of NMI&#183;HCl significantly improved the conversion of the mixed carbonic anhydride, while expediting nucleophilic attacks on the desired carbonyl group. In contrast, in the case of mixed carbonic anhydrides, neither the conversion nor the desired nucleophilic attack improved significantly. We developed a C&#8208;terminus&#8208;free N&#8208;methylated peptide synthesis method using mixed carbonic anhydrides in a micro&#8208;flow reactor. Fourteen N&#8208;alkylated peptides were synthesized in moderate to high yields (55&#8211;99%) without severe racemization (&lt;1%). Additionally, a significant enhancement in the amidation between mixed carbonic anhydrides and bis&#8208;TMS&#8208;protected N&#8208;methyl amino acids with the inclusion of NMI&#183;HCl was observed for the first time. In addition, we observed unexpected C&#8208;terminal epimerization of the C&#8208;terminus&#8208;free N&#8208;methyl peptides.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhancing Substrate Channeling with Multi&#8208;Enzyme Architectures in Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOF) represent an emerging category of organic structures with high crystallinity and metal&#8208;free, which are not commonly observed in alternative porous organic frameworks. These needle&#8208;like porous structure can help in stabilizing enzymes and allow transfer of molecules between enzymes participating in cascade reactions for enhanced substrate channelling. Herein, we systematically synthesized and investigated the stability of HOF at extreme conditions followed by one&#8208;pot encapsulation of single and bi&#8208;enzyme systems. Firstly, we observed HOF to be stable at pH 1 to 14 and at high temperatures (up to 115&#176;C). Secondly, the encapsulated glucose oxidase enzyme (GOX) showed 80 % and 90% of its original activity at 70 &#176;C and pH 11, respectively. Thirdly, transient time close to 0 seconds was observed for HOF encapsulated bi&#8208;enzyme cascade reaction system demonstrating a 4.25&#8208;fold improvement in catalytic activity when compared to free enzymes with enhanced substrate channelling. Our findings showcase a facile system synthesized under ambient conditions to encapsulate and stabilize enzymes at extreme conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemoselective Post&#8208;Synthesis Modification of Pyridyl&#8208;Substituted, Aromatic Phosphorus Heterocycles: Cationic Ligands for Coordination Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pyridyl&#8208;functionalized triazaphospholes provide the possibility for a post&#8208;synthesis modification, affording a variety of mono&#8208; and dicationic species. This is achieved by a chemoselective and stepwise alkylation exclusively of the nitrogen atoms and can be controlled by the choice and by the stoichiometry of the used electrophile. This targeted synthesis opens up a fascinating coordination chemistry.







Abstract
Triazaphospholes are potential polydentate ligands due to the presence of both phosphorus and nitrogen donor atoms within the aromatic 5&#8208;membered heterocycle. The incorporation of an additional pyridyl&#8208;substituent opens up the possibility of a post&#8208;synthesis modification via chemoselective and also stepwise alkylation exclusively of the nitrogen atoms. This can be controlled by the choice and by the stoichiometry of the electrophile and allows the targeted synthesis of a variety of novel mono&#8208; and dicationic ligands. Reaction with Cu(I)&#8208;halides causes the formation of cuprates of the type [CuXn](n&#8722;1)&#8722;, which enables coordination of the &#960;&#8208;acidic phosphorus donor to the negatively charged metal core, which is favored over the coordination by a strongly &#963;&#8208;donating nitrogen atom. The use of cationic triazaphosphole derivatives can be used as a strategy to enforce the coordination of the ligand to an electron rich metal solely via the phosphorus atom. However, there is a subtle balance between the formation of either coordination polymers or dimeric structures, as the substitution pattern on the heterocycle and the nature of the halide have a large influence on the coordination motifs formed.

This is achieved by a chemoselective and stepwise alkylation exclusively of the nitrogen atoms and can be controlled by the choice and by the stoichiometry of the used electrophile. This targeted synthesis opens up a fascinating coordination chemistry.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Triazaphospholes are potential polydentate ligands due to the presence of both phosphorus and nitrogen donor atoms within the aromatic 5-membered heterocycle. The incorporation of an additional pyridyl-substituent opens up the possibility of a post-synthesis modification &lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; chemoselective and also stepwise alkylation exclusively of the nitrogen atoms. This can be controlled by the choice and by the stoichiometry of the electrophile and allows the targeted synthesis of a variety of novel mono- and dicationic ligands. Reaction with Cu(I)-halides causes the formation of cuprates of the type [CuX&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;(n&#8722;1)&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, which enables coordination of the &#960;-acidic phosphorus donor to the negatively charged metal core, which is favored over the coordination by a strongly &#963;-donating nitrogen atom. The use of cationic triazaphosphole derivatives can be used as a strategy to enforce the coordination of the ligand to an electron rich metal solely &lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; the phosphorus atom. However, there is a subtle balance between the formation of either coordination polymers or dimeric structures, as the substitution pattern on the heterocycle and the nature of the halide have a large influence on the coordination motifs formed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Advancements in Interfacial Engineering for Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Interfacial Engineering: As perovskite&#8208;based LEDs (PeLEDs) strive for higher efficiency, optimizing device performance solely through perovskite material enhancements becomes more challenging. Interfacial layers and device architecture are now recognized as crucial for stability and efficiency, playing vital roles in PeLED development. This perspective highlights advancements in PeLED devices, focusing on modifying adjacent layers interfacing with the perovskite film.







Abstract
Perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) have gained significant attention due to their promising optoelectronic properties and potential applications in the fields of lighting and display devices. Despite their potential, PeLEDs face challenges related to stability, high turn&#8208;on voltage, and low external quantum efficiency (EQE) which has restricted their broad acceptance. Most research efforts have predominantly focused on refining the properties of the perovskite films. However, it is becoming more apparent that interfacial layers and device architecture are crucial for achieving stability and high efficiency, making them indispensable components in PeLED development. This perspective highlights remarkable advancements in PeLED devices, with a primary focus on modifying adjacent layers interfacing with the perovskite film.

         <title>Photoreduction of Trifluoromethyl Group: Lithium Ion Assisted Fluoride&#8208;Coupled Electron Transfer from EDA Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have developed an electron&#8208;donor&#8208;acceptor complex mediated single&#8208;electron transfer of &#945;,&#945;,&#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl arenes in the presence of lithium salt to give &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluoroalkylarenes. The C&#8722;F bond reduction was realized by lithium iodide and triethylamine, two common feedstock reagents. Computational studies indicated that the lithium&#8208;assisted defluorination and the single&#8208;electron reduction occurred concertedly. We call this phenomenon fluoride&#8208;coupled electron transfer (FCET).







Abstract
Photoinduced single&#8208;electron reduction is an efficient method for the mono&#8208;selective activation of the C&#8722;F bond on a trifluoromethyl group to construct a difluoroalkyl group. We have developed an electron&#8208;donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complex mediated single&#8208;electron transfer (EDA&#8208;SET) of &#945;,&#945;,&#945;&#8208;trifluoromethyl arenes in the presence of lithium salt to give &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluoroalkylarenes. The C&#8722;F bond reduction was realized by lithium iodide and triethylamine, two common feedstock reagents. Mechanistic studies revealed the generation of a &#945;,&#945;&#8208;difluoromethyl radical by single&#8208;electron reduction and defluorination, followed by the radical addition to alkenes. Lithium salt interacted with the fluorine atom to promote the photoinduced reduction mediated by the EDA complex. Computational studies indicated that the lithium&#8208;assisted defluorination and the single&#8208;electron reduction occurred concertedly. We call this phenomenon fluoride&#8208;coupled electron transfer (FCET). FCET is a novel approach to C&#8722;F bond activation for the synthesis of organofluorine compounds.

         <title>Synthesis and Lewis Acid Properties of Neutral Silver(III) Adducts Containing the AgIII(CF3)3 Moiety</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthetic approaches to [AgIII(CF3)3(NCCH3)] (2) from either [AgIII(CF3)3Cl]&#8722; (3&#8901;Cl) or [AgIII(CF3)4]&#8722; (1), originally reported by Eujen and Naumann, are herein reinvestigated owing to major inconsistencies. Naumann's method provides 2 from 1 and HBF4, yet accompanied by its s&#8208;triazinyl derivative [AgIII(CF3)3(C6H9N3)] (2&#8217;), which is formed in&#8197;situ through nitrile cyclotrimerization enabled by AgIII/H+. In turn, chloride abstraction from 3&#8901;Cl using AgNO3 leads to [AgIII(CF3)3(ONO2)]&#8722; (5) instead of 2, as evidenced by NMR spectroscopy, Sc&#8208;XRD and EA.







Abstract
The acetonitrile AgIII complex [AgIII(CF3)3(NCCH3)] (2) has been reported independently by Eujen and Naumann in the last century, albeit with intriguing NMR discrepancy. In their reports, 2 was claimed to be obtained starting from either [AgIII(CF3)3Cl]&#8722; (3&#8901;Cl) or [AgIII(CF3)4]&#8722; (1) via halide abstraction using AgNO3 or acidic treatment, resp. These two synthetic routes are herein reinvestigated. The feasibility of Naumann's method is demonstrated, thus providing 2 yet accompanied by its s&#8208;triazinyl derivative [AgIII(CF3)3(C6H9N3)] (2&#8217;). The formation of 2&#8217; is unprecedented and was thereby investigated. Both 2 and 2&#8217; were isolated in pure fashion and fully characterized. In turn, halide extraction from 3&#8901;Cl leads to the AgIII&#8208;ONO2 anion 5 instead of 2, as evidenced by NMR spectroscopy, EA and Sc&#8208;XRD.

         <title>Polymorphism of Two&#8208;Dimensional Semiconducting Coordination Polymers: Impact of a Lead&#8211;Sulfur Network on Photoconductivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sulfur&#8208;coordinated coordination polymers (S&#8722;CPs) have unique optoelectrical properties resulting from inorganic (&#8722;M&#8722;S&#8722;)n network structures. However, these structures have never been correlated with their electronic properties. We reveal the impact of the (&#8722;M&#8722;S&#8722;)n networks in S&#8722;CPs on photoconductivity by comparing S&#8722;CP crystal polymorphs.







Abstract
Sulfur&#8208;coordinated coordination polymers (S&#8722;CPs) have unique optoelectrical properties that originate from infinite M&#8722;S bond networks. In this study, we synthesized and characterized two polymorphs of a two&#8211;dimensional (2D) Pb(II) S&#8722;CP with a formula of [Pb(tzdt)(OAc)] (Htzdt=1,3&#8208;thiazolidine&#8208;2&#8208;thione, OAc=acetate). Our findings revealed that the thermodynamic product (KGF&#8208;26) possesses quasi&#8208;2D (&#8722;Pb&#8722;S&#8722;)n layers with weak nonbonded Pb&#8722;S bonds, whereas the kinetic product (KGF&#8208;27) has intrinsic 2D (&#8722;Pb&#8722;S&#8722;)n layers with Pb&#8722;S bonds. The results of time&#8208;resolved microwave conductivity measurements and first&#8211;principles calculations confirmed that KGF&#8208;27 exhibits higher photoconductivity than KGF&#8208;26, which establishes that the inorganic (&#8722;Pb&#8722;S&#8722;)n networks with Pb&#8722;S bonds are crucial for achieving high photoconductivity. This is the first experimental demonstration of the impact of the (&#8722;M&#8722;S&#8722;)n networks in S&#8722;CPs on photoconductivity through the comparison of crystal polymorphisms.

&lt;/sub&gt; networks in S&#8722;CPs on photoconductivity by comparing S&#8722;CP crystal polymorphs.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sulfur-coordinated coordination polymers (S&#8722;CPs) have unique optoelectrical properties that originate from infinite M&#8722;S bond networks. In this study, we synthesized and characterized two polymorphs of a two&#8211;dimensional (2D) Pb(II) S&#8722;CP with a formula of [Pb(tzdt)(OAc)] (Htzdt=1,3-thiazolidine-2-thione, OAc=acetate). Our findings revealed that the thermodynamic product (&lt;b&gt;KGF-26&lt;/b&gt;) possesses quasi-2D (&#8722;Pb&#8722;S&#8722;)&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; layers with weak nonbonded Pb&#8722;S bonds, whereas the kinetic product (&lt;b&gt;KGF-27&lt;/b&gt;) has intrinsic 2D (&#8722;Pb&#8722;S&#8722;)&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; layers with Pb&#8722;S bonds. The results of time-resolved microwave conductivity measurements and first&#8211;principles calculations confirmed that &lt;b&gt;KGF-27&lt;/b&gt; exhibits higher photoconductivity than &lt;b&gt;KGF-26&lt;/b&gt;, which establishes that the inorganic (&#8722;Pb&#8722;S&#8722;)&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; networks with Pb&#8722;S bonds are crucial for achieving high photoconductivity. This is the first experimental demonstration of the impact of the (&#8722;M&#8722;S&#8722;)&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; networks in S&#8722;CPs on photoconductivity through the comparison of crystal polymorphisms.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Theoretical Study of the Ternary Compound Monolayer CuP2Se for Photocatalytic Water Splitting with Efficient Optical Absorption</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The left panels mean the most stable adsorption configurations for each step of the hydrogen reduction and oxygen evolution half&#8208;reactions, while the right panels are the corresponding Gibbs free energy changes. The variation of energy change of uphill and downhill in the right panels indicate the endothermic and exothermic reactions, respectively.







Abstract
Utilizing photocatalytic method to produce hydrogen by splitting water is an efficient strategy to solve the hotspot issues of energy crisis and environmental pollution. Herein, we systematically investigate the corresponding properties of the reported Cu&#8208;bearing ternary compound monolayer CuP2Se by using the first&#8208;principle calculations. The monolayer CuP2Se has quite small cleavage energy of 0.51&#8197;J/m2, indicating it can be easily produced by the mechanical exfoliation method experimentally. In addition, it is an indirect bandgap semiconductor material which has a moderate value of 1.91&#8197;eV. The conduction band minimum (CBM) and valence band maximum (VBM) can perfectly straddle the redox potentials of water when a biaxial strain of &#8722;4% to 4% is applied, unveiling the high photocatalytic thermodynamic stability of monolayer CuP2Se in response to the effect of solvent tension. Remarkably, the monolayer CuP2Se also demonstrates significant sunlight capturing ability in the visible region. The outstanding electronic and optical properties suggest that the monolayer CuP2Se is undoubtedly a viable material for photocatalytic water splitting.

The synthesis of AlPDA&#8208;53&#8208;DEF, AlPDA&#8208;53&#8208;H, and AlPDA&#8208;68 with insights into Aluminum Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks (Al&#8208;MOFs), their defect structures, lattice rearrangement, and the role of defects and disorders in the transformation from AlPDA&#8208;53&#8208;DEF to AlPDA&#8208;53&#8208;H.







Abstract
The transition from disorder to order and structural transformation are distinctive metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) features. How to adapt or control both behaviors in MOF has rarely been studied. In this case, we demonstrate that our successful synthesis of [Al(OH)(PDA)]n (AlPDA&#8208;53&#8208;DEF, AlPDA&#8208;53&#8208;H, and AlPDA&#8208;68) with H2PDA=4,4&#8242;&#8208;[1,4&#8208;phenylenebis(ethyne&#8208;2,1&#8208;diyl)]&#8208;di benzoic acid has shown the intricate world of Aluminum Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks (Al&#8208;MOFs). It offers profound insights into defect structures to order and transformations. AlPDA&#8208;53&#8208;DEF, in particular, revealed a fascinating interplay of various pore sizes within both micro and mesoporous regions, unveiling a unique lattice rearrangement phenomenon upon solvent desorption. Defects and disorders emerged as crucial impacts of transforming AlPDA&#8208;53&#8208;DEF, with its initially imperfect crystallinity, into the highly crystalline, hierarchically porous AlPDA&#8208;53&#8208;H.

         <title>Solid&#8208;State Glass Nanopipettes: Functionalization and Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solid&#8208;state glass nanopipettes, also known as nanopores or nanochannels, are an attractive class of sensing platforms due to their inherent advantages, such as confined space, mechanical stability, and scalable functionalization. By monitoring dynamic switches of surface charge or resistive pulse, various applications have been developed, like biosensors, DNA sequencing, and drug delivery.







Abstract
Solid&#8208;state glass nanopipettes provide a promising confined space that offers several advantages such as controllable size, simple preparation, low cost, good mechanical stability, and good thermal stability. These advantages make them an ideal choice for various applications such as biosensors, DNA sequencing, and drug delivery. In this review, we first delve into the functionalized nanopipettes for sensing various analytes and the methods used to develop detection means with them. Next, we provide an in&#8208;depth overview of the advanced functionalization methodologies of nanopipettes based on diversified chemical kinetics. After that, we present the latest state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art achievements and potential applications in detecting a wide range of targets, including ions, molecules, biological macromolecules, and single cells. We examine the various challenges that arise when working with these targets, as well as the innovative solutions developed to overcome them. The final section offers an in&#8208;depth overview of the current development status, newest trends, and application prospects of sensors. Overall, this review provides a comprehensive and detailed analysis of the current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art functionalized nanopipette perception sensing and development of detection means and offers valuable insights into the prospects for this exciting field.

         <title>Coordination of a Phosphine&#8208;Tethered Aminoborane to Group 10 Metals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis and coordination chemistry of a diphosphine&#8208;aminoborane ligand to group 10 metals is reported, affording a rare aminoborane &#960;&#8208;complex of Ni(0). The bonding situation is best described as a 3&#8208;center&#8208;4&#8208;electron bond where the Ni and N atoms compete for an accepting orbital on boron. In contrast with isoelectronic olefin &#960;&#8208;complexes, the metal&#8208;ligand bond is tenuous and the B=N ligand is therefore easily displaced.







Abstract
While &#960;&#8208;complexes of C=C bonds are ubiquitous in organometallic chemistry, analogous complexes of the isoelectronic but strongly polarized B=N double bond of aminoboranes are extremely scarce. To address this gap, a diphosphine&#8208;aminoborane ligand (PhDPBAiPr) is introduced and its coordination with group 10 metals is investigated. The B=N bond does not coordinate to the metal in Pt(0) and Pd(II) complexes. In contrast, side&#8208;on coordination of the B=N bond is observed in the Ni(0) complex (PhDPBAiPr)Ni(NCPh), and the X&#8208;ray crystal structure reveals B&#8722;N bond elongation compared to the free ligand. The choice of co&#8208;ligand strongly influences the presence or absence of side&#8208;on coordination at Ni(0) as evidenced by NMR spectroscopy. While the B=N &#960;&#8208;complex is geometrically similar to C=C analogues, a bonding analysis reveals that the interaction of the B=N motif with the electron&#8208;rich Ni(0) center is best described as 3c4e hyperbond, in which Ni and N are competing for the empty orbital on B.

A panel of twenty&#8208;two isomeric asymmetrical tri&#8208;antennary N&#8208;glycans presenting SLex&#8208;Lex epitopes on either the MGAT4 or MGAT5 arm prepared by a chemoenzymatic strategy reveals that glycan complexity can modulate receptor specificities of hemagglutinins of H5 influenza A viruses.







Abstract
Sialyl&#8208;Lewisx (SLex) is involved in immune regulation, human fertilization, cancer, and bacterial and viral diseases. The influence of the complex glycan structures, which can present SLex epitopes, on binding is largely unknown. We report here a chemoenzymatic strategy for the preparation of a panel of twenty&#8208;two isomeric asymmetrical tri&#8208;antennary N&#8208;glycans presenting SLex&#8208;Lex epitopes on either the MGAT4 or MGAT5 arm that include putative high&#8208;affinity ligands for E&#8208;selectin. The N&#8208;glycans were prepared starting from a sialoglycopeptide isolated from egg yolk powder and took advantage of inherent substrate preferences of glycosyltransferases and the use of 5&#8242;&#8208;diphospho&#8208;N&#8208;trifluoracetylglucosamine (UDP&#8208;GlcNHTFA) that can be transferred by branching N&#8208;acetylglucosaminyltransferases to give, after base treatment, GlcNH2&#8208;containing glycans that temporarily disable an antenna from enzymatic modification. Glycan microarray binding studies showed that E&#8208;selectin bound equally well to linear glycans and tri&#8208;antennary N&#8208;glycans presenting SLex&#8208;Lex. On the other hand, it was found that hemagglutinins (HA) of H5 influenza A viruses (IAV) preferentially bound the tri&#8208;antennary N&#8208;glycans. Furthermore, several H5 HAs preferentially bound to N&#8208;glycan presenting SLex on the MGAT4 arm. SLex is displayed in the respiratory tract of several avian species, demonstrating the relevance of investigating the binding of, among others IAVs, to complex N&#8208;glycans presenting SLex.

         <title>Improving the Stability and Kinetic Inertness of Mn(II) Complexes by Increasing the Bridge Length in Bicyclic CDTA&#8208;Like Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bicyclic trans&#8208;diaminotetraacetate ligands were synthesized to form paramagnetic Mn(II) complexes with improved kinetic inertness for application as MRI contrast agents. The length of the alkyl bridge on the cyclohexane ring was varied from methylene (BCH&#8208;DTA), ethylene (BCO&#8208;DTA) to propylene (BCN&#8208;DTA) to evaluate the influence of the different structures on the relaxometric properties, thermodynamic stability and kinetic inertness of the Mn(II) complexes.







Abstract
Kinetic inertness of Mn(II)&#8208;based MRI contrast agents can be improved by increasing the rigidity of the polydentate ligand that tightly coordinate the metal ion. Taking inspiration from the remarkable increase in kinetic inertness of [Mn(CDTA)]2&#8722; compared to [Mn(EDTA)]2&#8722; due to the cyclohexyl backbone rigidity, we devised that bicyclic ligands would further improve the kinetic inertness of the Mn(II) complexes. The length of the alkyl bridge on the cyclohexane ring was varied from methylene (BCH&#8208;DTA), ethylene (BCO&#8208;DTA) to propylene (BCN&#8208;DTA) to evaluate the influence of the different trans&#8208;diaminotetraacetate ligands on relaxometric, thermodynamic and kinetic properties of the Mn(II) complexes. 1H and 17O&#8197;NMR relaxometric studies showed a slight increase in relaxivity and a faster water exchange rate in these Mn(II)&#8208;complexes with respect to [Mn(CDTA)]2&#8722;. Solution studies revealed that the conditional stability (pMn) and dissociation half&#8208;life (t1/2) at pH&#8197;7.4 follow the order [Mn(BCH&#8208;DTA)]2&#8722;&lt;[Mn(BCO&#8208;DTA)]2&#8722;&lt;[Mn(BCN&#8208;DTA)]2&#8722; highlighting the effect of the bridge length on the overall stability of the Mn(II) complexes. Remarkably, [Mn(BCN&#8208;DTA)]2&#8722; shows an improved pMn value and a 7&#8208;times higher kinetic inertness than [Mn(CDTA)]2&#8722;. NMR studies on the Zn(II) analogues confirm the rigidity of the bicyclic complexes with an isomerization process at &gt;313&#8197;K for the smaller bridged complex [Zn(BCH&#8208;DTA)]2&#8722;.

Abstract
Assembling multi&#8208;anionic groups is conducive to utilizing respective advantage to achieve the enhancement of optical performance. Two new hydroxyfluorooxoborates, Ama2&#8208;Rb2B3O3F4(OH) and K8Cs2B15O14(OH)7F20&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O with [B3O3F4(OH)] six&#8208;membered rings were synthesized for the first time. The title compounds exhibit short ultraviolet cutoff edges (&lt;200&#8197;nm) and K8Cs2B15O14(OH)7F20&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O possesses a moderate experimental refractive index difference of 0.051@546&#8197;nm.

         <dc:description>
Diborylalkenes are useful building blocks for the synthesis of pharmaceuticals and organic materials. We demonstrate a metal&#8208;free phosphine&#8208;catalyzed cis&#8208;diboration of 1,3&#8208;diynes with B2pin2 to afford cis&#8208;diboryl&#8208;1,3&#8208;enynes in good yields with high regio&#8208; and stereo&#8208;selectivity (up to 96&#8201;% yield and &gt;99&#8201;:&#8201;1 Z/E selectivity). The diboration product can be conveniently transformed into densely functionalized 1,3&#8208;enynes.

Trialkyl phosphines PMe3 and PEt3 catalyze the 1,2&#8208;cis&#8208;diboration of 1,3&#8208;butadiynes to give 1,2&#8208;diboryl enynes. The products were utilized to synthesize 1,1,2,4&#8208;tetraaryl enynes using a Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura protocol and can readily undergo proto&#8208;deborylation.

&lt;p&gt;Diborylalkenes are useful building blocks for the synthesis of pharmaceuticals and organic materials. We demonstrate a metal-free phosphine-catalyzed &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-diboration of 1,3-diynes with B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;pin&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to afford &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-diboryl-1,3-enynes in good yields with high regio- and stereo-selectivity (up to 96&#8201;% yield and &amp;gt;99&#8201;:&#8201;1 &lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt; selectivity). The diboration product can be conveniently transformed into densely functionalized 1,3-enynes.

         <title>Regulation Strategies for Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C and Co&#8722;N&#8722;C Catalysts for the Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C and Co&#8722;N&#8722;C have been widely studied due to their excellent intrinsic oxygen reduction reaction performance. Regulation strategies for Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C or Co&#8722;N&#8722;C catalysts are summarized in this Review from 5 perspectives: (1)&#8197;coordinated atoms, (2)&#8197;environmental heteroatoms and defects, (3)&#8197;dual&#8208;metal active sites, (4)&#8197;metal&#8208;based particle promoters, and (5)&#8197;curved carbon layers.







Abstract
Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) and alkaline membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs) have received great attention as energy devices of the next generation. Accelerating oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) kinetics is the key to improve PEMFC and AEMFC performance. Platinum&#8208;based catalysts are the most widely used catalysts for the ORR, but their high price and low abundance limit the commercialization of fuel cells. Non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;carbon (M&#8722;N&#8722;C) is considered to be the most likely material class to replace Pt&#8208;based catalysts, among which Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C and Co&#8722;N&#8722;C have been widely studied due to their excellent intrinsic ORR performance and have made great progress in the past decades. With the improvement of synthesis technology and a deeper understanding of the ORR mechanism, some reported Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C and Co&#8722;N&#8722;C catalysts have shown excellent ORR activity close to that of commercial Pt/C catalysts. Inspired by the progress, regulation strategies for Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C and Co&#8722;N&#8722;C catalysts are summarized in this Review from 5&#8197;perspectives: (1)&#8197;coordinated atoms, (2)&#8197;environmental heteroatoms and defects, (3)&#8197;dual&#8208;metal active sites, (4)&#8197;metal&#8208;based particle promoters, and (5)&#8197;curved carbon layers. We also make suggestions on some challenges facing Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C and Co&#8722;N&#8722;C research.

         <title>Structure&#8208;Based Design and Synthesis of Lipid A Derivatives to Modulate Cytokine Responses</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on co&#8208;crystal structure of LPS with TLR4&#8208;MD2, a range of bis&#8208; and monophosphoryl lipid A derivatives was designed and synthesized to probe the importance of the (R)&#8208;3&#8208;hydroxymyristate at C&#8208;2 of the proximal glucosamine for inducing the production of a wide variety of cytokines by human monocytes.







Abstract
Agonists of Toll like receptors (TLRs) have attracted interest as adjuvants and immune modulators. A crystal structure of TLR4/MD2 with E. coli LPS indicates that the fatty acid at C&#8208;2 of the lipid A component of LPS induces dimerization of two TLR4&#8208;MD2 complexes, which in turn initiates cell signaling leading to the production of (pro)inflammatory cytokines. To probe the importance of the (R)&#8208;3&#8208;hydroxymyristate at C&#8208;2 of lipid A, a range of bis&#8208; and mono&#8208;phosphoryl lipid A derivatives with different modifications at C&#8208;2 were prepared by a strategy in which 2&#8208;methylnaphthyl ethers were employed as permanent protecting group that could be readily removed by catalytic hydrogenation. The C&#8208;2 amine was protected as 9&#8208;fluorenylmethyloxycarbamate, which at a later stage could be removed to give a free amine that was modified by different fatty acids. LPS and the synthetic lipid As induced the same cytokines, however, large differences in activity were observed. A compound having a hexanoyl moiety at C&#8208;2 still showed agonistic properties, but further shortening to a butanoyl abolished activity. The modifications had a larger influence on monophosphoryl lipid As. The lipid As having a butanoyl moiety at C&#8208;2 could selectively antagonize TRIF associated cytokines induced by LPS or lipid A.

         <title>Construction of Ultrafine PtIr Clusters Supported on Co3O4 Nanoflowers for Enhanced Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By fabricating the combination of ultrafine PtIr nanoclusters and the Co3O4 nanoflowers assembled by nanowires, the as&#8208;obtained PtIr&#8208;Co3O4 hybrid catalysts exhibit OER/HER and overall water splitting performances superior to the commercial IrO2 and Pt/C catalysts, owing to the heterogeneous structure, ultrafine metal clusters and strong interaction between noble metal and transition metal species.







Abstract
Green hydrogen production through electrochemical overall water splitting has suffered from sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics, inferior conversion efficiency, and high cost. Herein, ultrafine PtIr clusters are synthesized via an electrodeposition method and decorated on the Co3O4 nanoflowers assembled by nanowires (PtIr&#8208;Co3O4). The encouraging performances in electrochemical OER and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) are achieved over the PtIr&#8208;Co3O4 catalyst, with the overpotentials as low as 410 and 237&#8197;mV at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, respectively, outperforming the commercial IrO2 and Pt/C catalysts. Due to the ultralow loading of PtIr clusters, the PtIr&#8208;Co3O4 catalyst exhibits 1270&#8197;A&#8201;gIr&#8722;1 for OER at the overpotential of 400&#8197;mV. Our detailed analyses also show that the strong interactions between the ultrafine PtIr clusters and the Co3O4 nanoflowers enable the PtIr&#8208;Co3O4 catalyst to afford 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 for the overall water splitting at the potential of 1.57&#8197;V, accompanied by high durability for 100&#8197;h.

         <title>External Electric Field Control of Exciton Motion in Porphyrin&#8208;Based Metal Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porphyrins excel as light&#8208;harvesting complexes, but their unsuitability for photovoltaics stems from poor transport properties causing significant exciton loss. While arranging them in surface&#8208;anchored metal&#8208;organic frameworks (PP&#8208;SURMOFs) aids charge carrier dissociation, it doesn&#8242;t notably enhance conductivity. To address this, we propose guiding exciton diffusion indirectly with an external electric field. Fields as low as 0.1&#8197;V&#8201;nm&#8722;1 induce a Stark effect, reducing band gaps in PP&#8208;SURMOFs. Applied as a gradient, this creates a unidirectional hopping pathway, potentially reducing exciton diffusion lengths and enhancing their utility in photovoltaic and photocatalytic applications.







Abstract
Porphyrins are excellent light&#8208;harvesting complexes. Presently they are unsuitable for photovoltaic applications, as their excellent light absorbance is compensated to a large extent by their poor transport properties, where most excitons are lost by recombination. Arranging porphyrins in regular, strongly bound, lattices of surface&#8208;anchored metal&#8208;organic frameworks (PP&#8208;SURMOFs) may facilitate charge carrier dissociation, but does not significantly enhance the conductive properties. In most cases, photogenerated excitons traverse undirected, Brownian motion through a hopping process, resulting in a substantial diffusion length to reach electrodes, leading to significant exciton loss through recombination. Here, we propose to guide exciton diffusion indirectly by an external electric field. We show that electric fields, even as strong as 1&#8197;V&#8201;nm&#8722;1, do not affect the HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap of the porphyrins. However, fields of 0.1&#8197;V&#8201;nm&#8722;1 and even less demonstrate a notable Stark effect, with slight band gap reductions, for some PP&#8208;SURMOFs. When applied as an electric field gradient, for instance, via the substrate, it creates a unidirectional hopping pathway for the excitons. Consequently, we expect a significant reduction of exciton diffusion length leading to increased utilization of photogenerated excitons as they reach the electrodes. This strategy holds promise for integrating photoactive molecules in photovoltaic and photocatalytic applications.

         <title>A Fluorination Strategy and Low&#8208;Acidity Anchoring Group in Self&#8208;Assembled Molecules for Efficient and Stable Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two self&#8208;assembled hole transport materials with low acidity anchoring group, benzoic acid, and a fluorination strategy have been developed. With the new hole transport materials, high&#8208;performance PSCs were fabricated with high&#8208;quality perovskite layer and excellent interfacial contacts, and a champion PCE of 20.32&#8201;% was achieved with remarkably enhanced stability.







Abstract
Herein, we synthesized two donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) type small organic molecules with self&#8208;assembly properties, namely MPA&#8208;BT&#8208;BA and MPA&#8208;2FBT&#8208;BA, both containing a low acidity anchoring group, benzoic acid. After systematically investigation, it is found that, with the fluorination, the MPA&#8208;2FBT&#8208;BA demonstrates a lower highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level, higher hole mobility, higher hydrophobicity and stronger interaction with the perovskite layer than that of MPA&#8208;BT&#8208;BA. As a result, the device based&#8208;on MPA&#8208;2FBT&#8208;BA displays a better crystallization and morphology of perovskite layer with larger grain size and less non&#8208;radiative recombination. Consequently, the device using MPA&#8208;2FBT&#8208;BA as hole transport material achieved the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.32&#8201;% and remarkable stability. After being kept in an N2 glove box for 116&#8197;days, the unsealed PSCs&#8217; device retained 93&#8201;% of its initial PCE. Even exposed to air with a relative humidity range of 30&#177;5&#8201;% for 43&#8197;days, its PCE remained above 91&#8201;% of its initial condition. This study highlights the vital importance of the fluorination strategy combined with a low acidity anchoring group in SAMs, offering a pathway to achieve efficient and stable PSCs.

         <title>On the Synthesis and Structure of &#8216;Naked&#8217; Ga(I) and In(I) Salts and the Surprising Stability of Simple Ga(I) and In(I) Salts in the Coordinating Solvents Ether and Acetonitrile</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Free Choices: In this work we introduce a route to solvent&#8208;free &#8216;naked&#8217; GaI and InI salts that may serve as starting materials to introduce GaI and InI to any desired system. Their markedly different structures are compared and analyzed in detail. In addition, the isolation of [M(OEt2)2]+ and [M(MeCN)2]+ (M=Ga, In) complex salts and the limits of stability of MI against disproportionation are explored.







Abstract
In this work, we present the solid&#8208;state structures of solvent&#8208;free Ga[pf] and In[pf] salts ([pf]&#8722;=[Al(ORF)4]&#8722;; RF=C(CF3)3), which are very rare examples of salts with truly &#8216;naked&#8217; metal cations. Both salts may serve as starting materials for subvalent gallium and indium chemistry with very weakly coordinating ligands providing the freedom of choice for solvents and ligands for the future. On the other hand, we report and rationalize the formation and isolation of [M(OEt2)2][pf] and [M(MeCN)2][pf] (M=Ga, In), underlining the surprising stability of these subvalent group 13&#8197;M+ ions against disproportionation. Unexpectedly, dicoordinate and carbene analogous [M(L)2]+ ions with the [pf]&#8722; counterion are stable in L=acetonitrile and diethyl ether at room temperature, opening up possible applications for example in organic synthesis and catalysis.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydroxylamine&#8208;mediated C(sp2)&#8722;H trifluoromethylation of terminal alkenes was developed, which shows good reactivity, impressive E/Z selectivity, and broad group compatibility. Expansion of this approach to perfluoroalkylation and late&#8208;stage trifluoromethylation demonstrates its promising applications in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals.







Abstract
Introduction of the trifluoromethyl (CF3) group into organic compounds has garnered substantial interest because of its significant role in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. Here, we report a hydroxylamine&#8208;mediated radical process for C(sp2)&#8722;H trifluoromethylation of terminal alkenes. The reaction shows good reactivity, impressive E/Z selectivity (up to &gt;20&#8201;:&#8201;1), and broad functional group compatibility. Expansion of this approach to perfluoroalkylation and late&#8208;stage trifluoromethylation of bioactive molecules demonstrates its promising application potential. Mechanistic studies suggest that the reaction follows a radical addition and subsequent elimination pathway.

On&#8208;surface synthesis of heterochiral heptahelicene oligomers via Ullman coupling has been reported. Annealing helicene monomers equipped with spacer linkers and Br ligands on an Au(111) surface in UHV conditions resulted in helicene oligomers with a 100&#8201;% monomer coupling yield. The oligomers were characterized by AFM/STM and theoretical calculations.







Abstract
We report on&#8208;surface synthesis of heterochiral 1D heptahelicene oligomers after deposition of a racemic heptahelicene monomer on an Au(111) surface followed by Ullmann coupling under ultrahigh vacuum conditions. Structure, chirality and mode of adsorption of the resulting dimers to octamers are inferred from the scanning probe microscopy and theoretical calculations.

         <title>Strategies for using Quaternary Ammonium Salts as Alternative Reagents in Alkylations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review outlines strategies for using quaternary ammonium salts (QAS) as alternative and solid reagents in alkylation reactions, enabling safer chemical synthesis methods for researchers. Unlike traditional reagents, which entail notable health and safety hazards, QAS present a safer alternative, being non&#8208;carcinogenic, non&#8208;mutagenic, non&#8208;flammable, and non&#8208;corrosive.







Abstract
Alkylation reactions are pivotal in organic chemistry, with wide&#8208;ranging utilization across various fields of applied synthetic chemistry. However, conventional reagents employed in alkylations often pose substantial health and exposure risks. Quaternary ammonium salts (QAS) present a promising alternative for these transformations offering significantly reduced hazards as they are non&#8208;cancerogenic, non&#8208;mutagenic, non&#8208;flammable, and non&#8208;corrosive. Despite their potential, their use in direct organic transformations remains relatively unexplored. This review outlines strategies for utilizing QAS as alternative reagents in alkylation reactions, providing researchers with safer approaches to chemical synthesis.

         <title>Luminescent Supramolecular Metallogels: Drug Loading and Eu(III) as Structural Probe</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Eu(III) is combined with iminodiacetic acid to create luminescent hydrogels, with tunable rheological properties. Utilizing Eu(III) luminescence as a structural probe, we propose molecular structures for the materials. We also assess their capacity for loading bioactive molecules. This research could inspire luminescent hydrogel development for optical and biomedical materials, leveraging Eu(III) luminescence for advanced material characterization.







Abstract
Supramolecular metallogels combine the rheological properties of gels with the color, magnetism, and other properties of metal ions. Lanthanide ions such as Eu(III) can be valuable components of metallogels due to their fascinating luminescence. In this work, we combine Eu(III) and iminodiacetic acid (IDA) into luminescent hydrogels. We investigate the tailoring of the rheological properties of these gels by changes in their metal:ligand ratio. Further, we use the highly sensitive Eu(III) luminescence to obtain information about the chemical structure of the materials. In special, we take advantage of computational calculations to employ an indirect method for structural elucidation, in which the simulated luminescent properties of candidate structures are matched to the experimental data. With this strategy, we can propose molecular structures for different EuIDA gels. We also explore the usage of these gels for the loading of bioactive molecules such as OXA, observing that its aldose reductase activity remains present in the gel. We envision that the findings from this work could inspire the development of luminescent hydrogels with tunable rheology for applications such as 3D printing and imaging&#8208;guided drug delivery platforms. Finally, Eu(III) emission&#8208;based structural elucidation could be a powerful tool in the characterization of advanced materials.

         <title>Distinctive Chiral Conformations Induced to Poly (naphthalene&#8211;1,4&#8208;diyl) by Helix&#8211;sense&#8211;selective Polymerization and Circularly Polarized Light Irradiation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Non&#8211;helical &#8220;biased&#8211;dihedral conformation&#8221; as a novel chiral structure and single&#8211;handed helical conformation as one of the well&#8211;known, ordered chiral structures are induced to poly (naphthalene&#8208;1,4&#8208;diyl) by circularly polarized light irradiation and asymmetric polymerization, respectively. The former conformation is stable only in the solid state while the latter resists racemization by aggregation in solution. Both conformations contribute to efficient circularly polarized luminescence.







Abstract
Optically active poly(naphthalene&#8208;1,4&#8208;diyl) was prepared through helix&#8211;sense&#8211;selective polymerization of the corresponding monomers and also through circularly polarized light (CPL) irradiation, resulting in distinctive circular dichroism (CD) spectral patterns. Chirality of the helix&#8211;sense&#8211;selective polymerization &#8208;based polymer is ascribed to preferred&#8211;handed helicity while that of the CPL&#8211;based polymer to a non&#8211;helical, chiral conformation (&#8216;biased&#8211;dihedral conformation&#8217;) with preferred&#8211;handedness which was stable only in the solid state. The helix of the helix&#8211;sense&#8211;selective polymerization&#8211;based polymer gradually racemized in tetrahydrofuran while it was stabilized by aggregate formation in a hexane&#8211;dichloromethane solution. Both helix&#8211;sense&#8211;selective polymerization&#8208; and CPL&#8211;based polymers exhibited efficient circularly polarized luminescence.

         <title>Dinuclear Rhenium(I) Tricarbonyl Complexes as Anticancer Drug Candidates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study the chemical synthesis and biological evaluation of dinuclear rhenium(I) complexes as potential chemotherapeutic drug candidates are presented. The metal complexes primarily accumulated in the mitochondria, causing cell death by apoptosis. The lead compound demonstrated to eradicate a pancreatic carcinoma multicellular tumor spheroid upon treatment with micromolar concentrations.







Abstract
Cancer is one of the deadliest diseases worldwide. Chemotherapy remains one of the most dominant forms for anticancer treatment. Despite their clinical success, the used chemotherapeutic agents are associated with severe side effect and pharmacological limitations. To overcome these drawbacks there is a need for the development of new types of chemotherapeutic agents. Herein, the chemical synthesis and biological evaluation of dinuclear rhenium(I) complexes as potential chemotherapeutic drug candidates are proposed. The metal complexes were found to be internalized by an energy dependent endocytosis pathway, primary accumulating in the mitochondria. The rhenium(I) complexes demonstrated to induce cell death against a variety of cancer cells in the micromolar range through apoptosis. The lead compound showed to eradicate a pancreatic carcinoma multicellular tumor spheroid at micromolar concentrations.

         <title>Syntheses of &#945;(2,8) Sialosides Containing NeuAc and NeuGc by Using Double Carbonyl&#8208;Protected N&#8208;Acyl Sialyl Donors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Double carbonyl&#8208;protected N&#8208;acetyl and N&#8208;glycoyl sialyl donors underwent efficient &#945;(2,8) sialylation in dichloromethane, allowing for the chemical synthesis of &#945;(2,8) disialosides involving the compounds containing both NeuAc and NeuGc. The selective ring&#8208;opening of the N&#8208;glycolylcarbamate in these sialosides without losing the N&#8208;glycolyl group was accomplished under a lower reaction temperature than that required for N&#8208;acetyl carbamate.







Abstract
We report on the syntheses of NeuAc and NeuGc&#8208;containing glycosides via the use of double carbonyl&#8208;protected N&#8208;acetyl sialyl donors. The 7&#8208;O,9&#8208;O&#8208;carbonyl protection of an N&#8208;acyl&#8208;5&#8208;N,4&#8208;O&#8208;carbonyl&#8208;protected sialyl donor markedly increased the &#945;&#8208;selectivity during glycosylation, particularly when glycosylating the C&#8208;8 hydroxyl group of sialic acids. The N&#8208;acyl carbamates were selectively opened with ethanethiol under basic conditions to provide N&#8208;acyl amines. It is noteworthy that N&#8208;glycolyl carbamate was more reactive to nucleophiles by comparison with the N&#8208;acetyl carbamate due to the electron&#8208;withdrawing oxygen in the N&#8208;acyl group and however, allowed selective opening of the carbamates without the loss of N&#8208;glycolyl groups. To demonstrate the utility of the approach, we began by synthesizing &#945;(2,3) and &#945;(2,6) sialyl galactosides. Glycosylation of the hydroxy groups of galactosides at the C&#8208;6 position with the NeuAc and NeuGc donors provided the corresponding sialyl galactoses in good yields with excellent &#945;&#8208;selectivity. However, glycosylation of the 2,3&#8208;diol galactosyl acceptor selectively provided Sia&#945;(2,2)Gal. Next, we prepared a series of &#945;(2,8) disialosides composed of NeuAc and NeuGc. Glycosylation of NeuGc and NeuAc acceptors at the C&#8208;8 hydroxyl group with NeuGc and NeuAc sialyl donors provided the corresponding &#945;(2,8) disialosides, and no significant differences were detected in the reactivities of these acceptors.

     alt="Syntheses of &#945;(2,8) Sialosides Containing NeuAc and NeuGc by Using Double Carbonyl-Protected N-Acyl Sialyl Donors"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Double carbonyl-protected &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-acetyl and &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-glycoyl sialyl donors underwent efficient &#945;(2,8) sialylation in dichloromethane, allowing for the chemical synthesis of &#945;(2,8) disialosides involving the compounds containing both NeuAc and NeuGc. The selective ring-opening of the &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-glycolylcarbamate in these sialosides without losing the &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-glycolyl group was accomplished under a lower reaction temperature than that required for &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-acetyl carbamate.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report on the syntheses of NeuAc and NeuGc-containing glycosides via the use of double carbonyl-protected &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-acetyl sialyl donors. The 7-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;,9-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-carbonyl protection of an &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-acyl-5-&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;,4-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-carbonyl-protected sialyl donor markedly increased the &#945;-selectivity during glycosylation, particularly when glycosylating the C-8 hydroxyl group of sialic acids. The &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-acyl carbamates were selectively opened with ethanethiol under basic conditions to provide &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-acyl amines. It is noteworthy that &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-glycolyl carbamate was more reactive to nucleophiles by comparison with the &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-acetyl carbamate due to the electron-withdrawing oxygen in the &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-acyl group and however, allowed selective opening of the carbamates without the loss of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-glycolyl groups. To demonstrate the utility of the approach, we began by synthesizing &#945;(2,3) and &#945;(2,6) sialyl galactosides. Glycosylation of the hydroxy groups of galactosides at the C-6 position with the NeuAc and NeuGc donors provided the corresponding sialyl galactoses in good yields with excellent &#945;-selectivity. However, glycosylation of the 2,3-diol galactosyl acceptor selectively provided Sia&#945;(2,2)Gal. Next, we prepared a series of &#945;(2,8) disialosides composed of NeuAc and NeuGc. Glycosylation of NeuGc and NeuAc acceptors at the C-8 hydroxyl group with NeuGc and NeuAc sialyl donors provided the corresponding &#945;(2,8) disialosides, and no significant differences were detected in the reactivities of these acceptors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Construction of Supramolecular Polymers and Covalent Polymers via the Same Monomers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two types of monomers were designed, which embodied diazonium salt units and phenolic hydroxyl groups respectively. First, supramolecular polymers were prepared driven by hydrogen bonds between diazonium salt and hydroxyl. Besides, covalent polymers could be obtained upon ultraviolet irradiation followed by the self&#8208;assembly process. In this way, both supramolecular polymers and covalent polymers were successfully synthesized using same monomers.







Abstract
Nature owns the ability to construct structurally different polymers from the same monomers. While polymers can be classified as covalent polymers (CPs) and supramolecular polymers (SPs), it is still difficult to synthesize CPs and SPs using same monomers like nature do. Herein, M1 with two diazo salts on both the ends was designed. Additionally, hydroquinone was chosen to be M2 for the existence of two hydroxyl groups. When mixing at room temperature, M1 and M2 self&#8208;assembled to SPs via N&#8230;H hydrogen bonds. In another way, upon the exposure to ultraviolet irradiation when blending M1 with M2, CPs were fabricated in the presence of covalent bonds. The excellent thermal stability of CPs was determined by TGA and DSC, while the great corrosion resistance of covalent polymers was detected by acid or alkali immersion. In this way, constructing two kinds of polymers using the same monomers was successfully achieved. This shows tremendous potential in fields of polymer science, supramolecular chemistry, which would boom the development of polymers.

         <title>Accelerating Cellular Uptake with Unnatural Amino Acid for Inhibiting Immunosuppressive Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This research demonstrates that the integration of unnatural amino acids (L&#8208; or D&#8208;4,4&#8242;&#8208;biphenylalanine) into peptide assemblies significantly accelerates their accumulation within prostate cancer cells, boosting their capacity to hinder cancer proliferation. This work paves a way for engineering supramolecular medicine, potentially heightening the efficacy of peptide&#8208;based treatments for prostate cancer. It may lead to more effective therapeutic strategies for treating other cancers.







Abstract
Targeting immunosuppressive metastatic cancer cells is a key challenge in therapy. We recently have shown that a rigid&#8208;rod aromatic, pBP&#8722;NBD, that responds to enzymes and kill immunosuppressive metastatic osteosarcoma (mOS) and castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) cells in mimetic bone microenvironment. However, pBP&#8722;NBD demonstrated moderate efficacy against CRPC cells. To enhance activity, we incorporated the unnatural amino acid L&#8208; or D&#8208;4,4&#8242;&#8208;biphenylalanine (L&#8208; or D&#8722;BiP) into pBP&#8722;NBD, drastically increasing cellular uptake and CRPC inhibition. Specifically, we inserted BiP into pBP&#8722;NBD to target mOS (Saos2 and SJSA1) and CRPC (VCaP and PC3) cells with overexpressed phosphatases. Our results show that the D&#8208;peptide backbone with an aspartate methyl diester at the C&#8208;terminal offers the highest activity against these immunosuppressive mOS and CRPC cells. Importantly, imaging shows that the peptide assemblies almost instantly enter the cells and accumulate primarily within the endoplasmic reticulum of Saos2, SJSA1, and PC3 cells and at the lysosomes of VCaP cells. By using BiP to boost cellular uptake and self&#8208;assembly within cancer cells, this work illustrates an unnatural hydrophobic amino acid as a versatile and effective residue to boost endocytosis of synthetic peptides for intracellular self&#8208;assembly.

         <title>A GFP Inspired 8&#8208;Methoxyquinoline&#8208;Derived Fluorescent Molecular Sensor for the Detection of Zn2+ by Two&#8208;Photon Microscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel fluorescent probe for visualizing Zn2+ in biological samples through microscopy has been designed. The probe was inspired by the chromophore of the green fluorescent protein, which was extended with an 8&#8208;methoxyquinoline ionophore. A probe&#8211;Zn2+ complex is shown glowing green inside a cell, lighting up the scene and illustrating how the sensor indicates the presence of the ion. More information can be found in the Research Article by E. Kov&#225;cs, B. R&#243;zsa, Z. Mucsi and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202400009).
