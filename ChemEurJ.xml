         <title>Conjugated Olefin Enabled Rollover Cyclometallation of Distant C&#8208;H Bonds: Regioselective Annulation of o&#8208;Alkenyl Phenols with Alkynes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although challenging, the distant C&#8208;H functionalization with precision is quite rewarding and has long been intriguing. Tailoring an appropriate template accomplishes the job but the prerequisite sets the limitation. We herein unveil our discovery of annulation of alkynes on to two distant (from directing group) C&#8208;H bonds through rollover cyclometallation assisted by conjugated C=C bond. The annulation follows a concomitant cyclization rewarding a rare triple C&#8208;H functionalization. The annulation is totally regioselective with an array of unsymmetrical alkynes, taking the leverage of an extended conjugation or a tertiary hydroxyl co&#8208;ordination. The mechanism is supported by control experiments, KIE &amp; labelling studies and Mass spectrometry.</dc:description>

         <title>gem&#8208;Difluoroolefination of Amides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A metal&#8208;free one&#8208;pot process for the gem&#8208;difluoroolefination of amides is described. The reaction is based on interaction of generated in situ &#945;&#8208;chloroiminium salts with difluorinated phosphorus ylide formed from difluorocarbene and triphenylphosphine. The olefination involves nucleophile&#8208;assisted dephosphorylation and proceeds within one hour at low temperature. The gem&#8208;difluoroenamines were used in further transformations leading to a variety of fluoroalkylated amines.</dc:description>

         <title>Living Self&#8208;Assembly of Metastable and Stable Two&#8208;Dimensional Platelets from a Single Small Molecule</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study reports the design of a donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) molecule with two fluorene units on each side of a benzothiadiazole moiety, which allows multiple intermolecular interactions to compete with one another so as to induce the evolution of the metastable 2D platelets to the stable 2D platelets during the self&#8208;assembly of the D&#8208;A molecule. Importantly, the living seeded self&#8208;assembly of metastable and stable 2D structures with precisely controlled sizes can be conveniently achieved using an appropriate supersaturated solution of the D&#8208;A molecule as the seeded growth medium that can temporarily hold the almost&#8208;proceeding spontaneous nucleation from competing with the seeded growth. The stable 2D platelets with smaller area sizes exhibit higher sensitivity to gaseous dimethyl sulfide, illustrating that the novel living self&#8208;assembly method provides more available functional structures with controlled sizes for practical applications. The key finding of this study is that the new living methodology is separated into two independent processes: the elaborate molecular design for various crystalline structures as seeds and the application of an appropriate supersaturated solution as the growth medium to grow the uniform structures with controlled sizes; this would make convenient and possible the living seeded self&#8208;assembly of rich 1D, 2D, and 3D architectures.</dc:description>

         <title>Total Chemical Synthesis of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Spike Receptor&#8208;Binding Domain</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 and its global spread have created an unprecedented public health crisis. The spike protein of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 has gained significant attention due to its crucial role in viral entry into host cells and its potential as both a prophylactic and a target for therapeutic interventions. Herein, we report the first successful total synthesis of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD), highlighting the key challenges and the strategies employed to overcome them. Appropriate utilization of advanced solid phase peptide synthesis and cutting&#8208;edge native chemical ligation methods have facilitated the synthesis of the protein molecule. We discuss problems encountered during the chemical synthesis and approaches taken to optimize the yield and the purity of the synthetic protein molecule. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the chemically synthesized spike RBD efficiently binds to the known mini&#8208;protein binder LCB1. The successful chemical synthesis of the spike RBD presented here can be utilized to gain valuable insights into SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike RBD biology, advancing our understanding and aiding the development of intervention strategies to combat future coronavirus outbreaks. The modular synthetic approach described in this study can be effectively implemented in the synthesis of other mutated variants or enantiomer of spike RBD for mirror&#8208;image drug discovery.</dc:description>

         <title>Dense NiCo2O4 Nanoneedles Grown on Carbon Foam Showing Excellent Electrochemical and Microwave Absorption Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electromagnetic pollution could harm sensitive electronic equipment due to the rising use of electronic devices and communication infrastructure. The supercapacitor's electrochemical performance should be enhanced, and electromagnetic damage should be prevented. This study proposes NiCo2O4/CF composites for supercapacitors and microwave absorption. They are made by combining hydrothermal and annealing processes. Dense NiCo2O4 nanoneedles were uniformly grown on the outer layer of carbon foam (CF) as a growth skeleton, preventing the agglomeration of NiCo2O4. The composite had a specific capacitance of 537.5 F/g at 1 A/g. When the current density was set to 1 A/g, the supercapacitor that used NiCo2O4/CF as the cathode had a specific capacitance of 70.7 F/g, and when the current density was increased to 10 A/g, the original specific capacitance of 87.2% could still be maintained after 5000 charge&#8208;discharge cycles. At a power density of 3695.5 W/kg, an energy density of 22.1 Wh/kg could be maintained. Furthermore, we performed a microwave absorption test and determined its reflection loss curve for various sample thicknesses. Recombination enhanced the composite material's microwave absorption capability by greatly reducing the dielectric loss and the magnetic loss.</dc:description>

The changed interaction between S&#8722;Nb&#8722;S in [NbO]6&#8722;x&#8208;xS structure, and the constructed [NbO]6&#8722;x&#8208;xS structure realized the regulation of charge density change and spontaneous polarization. S&#8208;doping weakens the S&#8722;Nb&#8722;S interaction in the [NbO]6&#8722;x&#8208;xS structure, which effectively improves the performance of the pyro&#8208;photo&#8208;electric synergistic water splitting system.







Abstract
Pyroelectric materials in the field of photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting still face the problems of difficult low spontaneous polarization intensity and excessive carrier recombination. Based on the above problems, we altered the interaction between S&#8722;Nb&#8722;S in the [NbO]6&#8722;x&#8208;xS structure, and the constructed [NbO]6&#8722;x&#8208;xS structure achieved the regulation of charge density change and spontaneous polarization. The results show that under the stimulation of light and temperature fluctuations, the current density of the NS&#8208;4 photoanode is as high as 0.574&#8197;mA/cm2 at 1.23&#8197;VRHE, which is about 1.59&#8197;times higher than the pure NaNbO3 current density value, and the NS &#8722;4 photoanode achieves IPCE value of 16.08&#8201;%. The first&#8208;principles density&#8208;functional theory calculations (DFT) reveal the principle of the [NbO]6&#8722;x&#8208;xS structure for the suppression function of the carrier recombination and the improvement function of the pyroelectric effect. The analysis shows that the S&#8208;doping leads to the weakening of S&#8722;Nb&#8722;S interactions in the [NbO]6&#8722;x&#8208;xS structure, which improves the pyroelectric effect and suppresses the photo/pyro&#8208;generated carrier recombination, and effectively enhances the performance of the pyro&#8208;photo&#8208;electric synergistic water splitting system. This work promotes the development of pyroelectric materials in the field of photoelectrochemical water splitting.

         <title>Theoretical Prediction of Electrocatalytic Reduction of CO2 Using a 2D Catalyst Composed of 3&#8201;d Transition Metal and Hexaamine Dipyrazino Quinoxaline</title>

Computational screening of 2D materials composed of 3d transition metal and hexaamine dipyrazino quinoxalineas efficient catalysts for carbon dioxide reduction reactions.







Abstract
Transition metals and organic ligands combine to form metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), which possess distinct active sites, large specific surface areas and stable porous structures, giving them considerable promise for CO2 reduction electrocatalysis. In the present study, using spin polarisation density&#8208;functional theory, a series of 2D MOFs constructed from 3d transition metal and hexamethylene dipyrazoline quinoxaline(HADQ) were investigated. The calculated binding energies between HADQ and metal atoms for the ten TM&#8208;HADQ monolayers were strong sufficient to stably disperse the metal atoms in the HADQ monolayers. Of the ten catalysts tested, seven (Sc, Ni, Cu, Zn, Ti, V and Cr) exhibited high CO2 reduction selectivity, while Mn, Fe and Co required pH values above 2.350, 6.461 and 6.363, respectively, to exhibit CO2 reduction selectivity. HCOOH was the most important producer for Sc, Zn, Ni and Mn, while CH4 was the main producer for Ti, Cr, Fe and V. Cu and Co were less selective, producing HCHO, CH3OH, and CH4 simultaneously at the same rate&#8208;determining step and limiting potential. The Cu&#8208;HADQ catalyst had a high overpotential for the HCHO product (1.022&#8197;V), while the other catalysts had lower overpotentials between 0.016&#8197;V and 0.792&#8197;V. Thus, these results predict TM&#8208;HADQ to show excellent activity in CO2 electrocatalytic reduction and to become a promising electrocatalyst for CO2 reduction.

         <title>Binary Metallic CuCo5S8 Anode for High Volumetric Sodium&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Binary metallic CuCo5S8 is successfully synthesized and evaluated as a CA&#8208;free anode in sodium&#8208;ion batteries. Because of the metallic properties of the material, the CA&#8208;free anode exhibits superior rate and cyclic performances. The high electrode density and multi&#8208;electron transfer during the charge&#8208;discharge process enable CuCo5S8 anode to display an outstanding volumetric capacity.







Abstract
With the rapid improvement of compact smart devices, fabricating anode materials with high volumetric capacity has gained substantial interest for future sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) applications. Herein, a novel bimetal sulfide CuCo5S8 material is proposed with enhanced volumetric capacity due to the intrinsic metallic electronic conductivity of the material and multi&#8208;electron transfer during electrochemical procedures. Due to the intrinsic metallic behavior, the conducting additive (CA) could be removed from the electrode fabrication without scarifying the high rate capability. The CA&#8208;free CuCo5S8 electrode can achieve a high volumetric capacity of 1436.4&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;cm&#8722;3 at a current density of 0.2&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 and 100&#8201;% capacity retention over 2000&#8197;cycles in SIBs, outperforming most metal chalcogenides, owing to the enhanced electrode density. Reversible conversion reactions are revealed by combined measurements for sodium systems. The proposed new strategy offers a viable approach for developing innovative anode materials with high&#8208;volumetric capacity.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;free natural dye has been developed to selectively convert methane to methyl trifluoroacetate (CH3TFA) using visible light, probably due to the formation of a chloride&#8208;bridged dimer undergoing fast intra&#8208;complex charge transfer.

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Catalyzed bis&#8208;Borylation of Quinolines: The Importance of the Cobalt Triplet State</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report herein a mild stereo&#8208; and regioselective dearomatization of quinolines using the simple low valent HCo(N2)(PPh3)3 complex that exhibits labile ligands. Conditions to form selectively, at room temperature, high&#8208;valued 1,4&#8208;bis&#8208;borylated tetrahydroquinolines from simple starting heteroaromatic compounds have been developed. The efficient and selective functionalization of a large scope of quinolines bearing various electron&#8208;donating or electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents is presented, as well as the post&#8208;modification of the resulting C&#8211;B bond. NMR and labelling studies are consistent with a cascade mechanism pathway, starting from an in situ generated paramagnetic bis&#8208;quinoline cobalt(I) hydride complex. A first quinoline dearomatization followed by a cobalt(I)&#8208;catalyzed Markovnikov hydroboration of the remaining double bond allows the introduction of the boronic ester group only at C4 position. DFT calculations particularly highlight the importance of the cobalt triplet state throughout the reaction pathway, and bring some rationalization for the observed C4 selective borylation.</dc:description>

         <title>Hexaguanidino&#8208;Triptycenes and Triphenylenes: Electronic Coupling in Molecules Containing Three Redox&#8208;Active o&#8208;Diguanidinobenzene Units Connected either Directly or Interacting Through Homoconjucation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Novel redox&#8208;active hexaguanidine molecules with multiple redox states were synthesized by connecting three o&#8208;diguanidinobenzene units. In 2,3,6,7,14,15&#8208;hexaguanidino&#8208;triptycenes, the three redox&#8208;active o&#8208;diguanidinobenzene units are connected through C&#8208;C bonds to the sp3&#8208;hybridized bridgehead C atoms, and in 2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexaguanidino&#8208;triphenylenes they are directly connected. The connectivity difference leads to different electronic coupling between the three redox&#8208;active o&#8208;diguanidinobenzene units, with homoconjugation being present in the triptycene, but not in the triphenylene compounds. Motivated by the appearance of an intense low&#8208;energy electronic transition, we especially analysed the effect of homoconjugation on the electronic structure and charge delocalization in the dicationic redox state of the triptycene derivatives. Then, several trinuclear high&#8208;spin cobalt (and copper) complexes were synthesized with the triphenylene and triptycene ligands, and the magnetic coupling and redox properties analysed. By choice of the coligands (hexafluoroacetylacetonate, trifluoroacetylacetonate and acetylacetonate), oxidation could be switched between metal&#8208; and ligand&#8208;centered redox events, leading to drastic changes in the magnetic or optical properties, especially as a consequence of homoconjugation in the triptycene derivatives.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalyst&#8208;Free Transfer Hydrogenation from Amine&#8208;Borane Small Oligomers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Amine&#8208;borane dimers and oligomers with varied steric and electronic profiles were prepared via capping agent&#8208;controlled AA/BB polycondensations. They were used for transfer hydrogenations to aldehydes, ketones, imines as well as electron&#8208;poor alkene/alkyne moieties. The amine&#8208;borane Lewis&#8208;paired oligomers and the congested bis(amine&#8208;borane)s provided the highest yields. This was likely helped by facilitated dissociation (oligomers) or H&#8208;bond assistance. In the case of the oligomers, the second equivalent of H2 present was also engaged in the reaction. Solid&#8208;state NMR characterization provides evidence that the Boron&#8208;containing materials obtained after transfer dehydrogenation are highly similar to those obtained from thermal dehydrogenation. The oligomers bridge the gap between simple amine&#8208;borane molecular reductants and the poly&#8208;amine&#8208;boranes and provide a full picture of the reactivity changes at the different scales.</dc:description>

         <title>Bimetallic Manganese Catalysts: A Route to Controlled and Switchable Polymerization of Lactones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The sustainable solution to the environmental problem of polymeric materials calls for efficient and well&#8208;controlled ring&#8208;opening polymerization catalytic systems. Inspired by the highly reactive and stereospecific bimetallic catalysts, three kinds of bimetallic Salen&#8208;Mn catalysts supported by biaryl linking moieties are synthesized and applied to polymerization catalysis of lactide (LA) and &#949;&#8208;caprolactone (&#949;&#8208;CL) in this work. The polymerization is initiated in situ by the ring&#8208;opening of epoxide compounds, in which the ionic cocatalyst could accelerate the reaction process. The Mn&#8208;Mn coordination effect contributes to the higher activity and iso&#8208;selectivity towards LA compared to the mononuclear Salen&#8208;Mn catalyst. The reactivity and stereoselectivity are determined by the conformation of catalysts, specifically the Mn&#8208;Mn separation and dihedral angle. Finally, the CO2&#8208;controlled switchable polymerizations are carried out with LA and &#949;&#8208;CL. The reversibility of the on&#8208;off switching operation is influenced by the combination between CO2 molecules and active species. The success in binuclear Salen&#8208;Mn catalysts not only expands the range of bimetallic catalyst analogues but also claims the promising potential of Mn&#8208;based catalysts in practical and theoretical research.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Accessibility and Diffusion of Resorufin in Zeolite Crystals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We use confocal laser scanning microscopy on the small, fluorescent resorufin dye molecule to visualize molecular accessibility and diffusion in the hierarchical, anisotropic pore structure of large (~10 &#181;m&#8208;sized) zeolite&#8208;&#946; crystals. The resorufin dye is widely used in life and materials science, but only in its deprotonated form because the protonated molecule is barely fluorescent in aqueous solution. In this work, we show that protonated resorufin is in fact strongly fluorescent when confined within the zeolite micropores enabling fluorescence microimaging experiments. We find that J&#8208;aggregation guest&#8211;guest interactions lead to a decrease in the measured fluorescence intensity, but is prevented by using non&#8208;fluorescent spacer molecules. By introducing resorufin from the outside solution and following its diffusion into zeolite&#8208;&#946; crystals, we characterize the pore space. The eventual homogeneous distribution of resorufin molecules throughout the zeolite indicates a fully accessible pore network. This enables the quantification of its diffusion coefficient in the straight pores of zeolite&#8208;&#946; without the need for complex analysis, and we find a value of 3 &#215; 10&#8722;15 m2 s&#8722;1. Furthermore, we visualize that diffusion through the straight pores of zeolite&#8208;&#946; is impeded when crossing the boundaries between zeolite sub&#8208;units.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Temperature&#8208;modulated colloidal phase of plasmonic nanoparticles is a convenient playground for resettable soft&#8208;actuators or colorimetric sensors.&#160;To render reversible clustering under temperature change, bulky ligands are required, especially if anisotropic morphologies are of interest.&#160;Here, we showcase thermoresponsive gold nanorods by employing small surface ligands, bis (p&#8208;sulfonatophenyl) phenyl&#8208;phosphine dihydrate dipotassium salt (BSPP) and native cationic surfactant.&#160;Temperature&#8208;dependent analysis in real&#8208;time allowed us to describe the structural features (interparticle distance and cluster size) as well as thermal parameters, melting and freezing temperatures. Our findings suggest that neither covalent Au&#8208;S bonds nor bulky ligands are required to obtain a robust thermoresponsive system based on anisotropic gold nanoparticles, paving the way to stimuli&#8208;responsive nanoparticles with a wide range of sizes and geometries.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Hierarchical CdS/NiS Photocatalysts Using Ni&#8722;MOF&#8208;74 as Template for Efficient Ethanol Conversion and Hydrogen Production under Visible Light</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 56, October 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ni&#8722;MOF&#8208;74 was added to fabricate the hierarchical CdS/NiS&#8722;N composites with an elevated specific surface area during the hydrothermal synthesis of CdS microsphere, and the Ni&#8722;MOF&#8208;74 facilitate the self&#8208;assemble growth of CdS and provide a source of Ni for the formation of NiS. The prepared photocatalyst can efficiently convert ethanol while producing a large amount of hydrogen gas and exhibits excellent photocatalytic stability.







Abstract
The conversion of ethanol into high&#8208;valuable chemicals and H2 by photocatalytic process provides a sustainable approach to produce carbon&#8208;chain&#8208;prolonged chemicals and hydrogen energy. In this article, Ni&#8722;MOF&#8208;74 was added to fabricate the hierarchical CdS/NiS&#8722;N composites with an elevated specific surface area during the hydrothermal synthesis of CdS microsphere, and the Ni&#8722;MOF&#8208;74 facilitate the self&#8208;assemble growth of CdS and provide a source of Ni for the formation of NiS. The as&#8208;prepared photocatalyst was subjected to photocatalytic ethanol conversion, and the hierarchical composite material CdS/NiS&#8722;N (100) formed by adding 100&#8197;mg of Ni&#8722;MOF&#8208;74 exhibits the highest photocatalytic activity and stability in an ethanol aqueous solution with a water content of 10&#8201;%. Under visible light irradiation, the conversion rate of ethanol reached 15.2&#8201;% at the photocatalytic reaction of 5&#8197;h. The selectivity of 2,3&#8208;butanediol(2,3&#8208;BDO) was 25&#8201;%, and the selectivity of acetaldehyde(AA) was 63&#8201;%. Through various characterizations, it has been proven that a large specific surface area and the coupling interface between CdS and NiS are key factors in improving photocatalytic performance. This work provides an effective strategy for constructing photocatalysts with coupled cocatalysts/semiconductors and large specific surface areas.

         <dc:description>
The new cyanido&#8208;sulfate anion, [SO3CN]&#8722;, is a complex of the Lewis base CN&#8722; and the Lewis acid SO3. The ion the a pseudo&#8208;halide analogon of the well&#8208;known fluorido&#8208; and chlorido&#8208;sulfates. Its formation is astonishing because the oxidation of the cyanide ion by SO3 seems to be favorable. For the successful preparation it seems to be benefitial that the synthesis can be carried out at room temperature.







Abstract
The reaction of the pyridine adduct of SO3 and tetra&#8208;n&#8208;butyl&#8208;ammonium cyanide, [N(nBu)4][CN] at room temperature leads to the unprecedented cyanido&#8208;sulfate anion [SO3CN]&#8722; stabilized in the salt [N(nBu)4][SO3CN]. The anion is a pseudo&#8208;halogen congener of the well&#8208;known fluoro&#8208; and chloro&#8208;sulfates. The new anion has been studied by vibrational spectroscopy and theoretical calculations.

         <title>Gas Permeation through Mechanically Resistant Self&#8208;Standing Membranes of a Neat Amorphous Organic Cage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 56, October 9, 2023. </description>

Stand up and be tested: Self&#8208;standing membranes of a neat organic cage are reported here. The cage membranes showed a remarkably good mechanical resistance, which made them suitable for gas&#8208;permeation tests. This study pointed the possibility of using a simple organic cage molecule to achieve a molecular material with features that are generally observed with polymeric membranes.







Abstract
The synthesis and characterization of a novel film&#8208;forming organic cage and of its smaller analogue are here described. While the small cage produced single crystals suitable for X&#8208;ray diffraction studies, the large one was isolated as a dense film. Due to its remarkable film&#8208;forming properties, this latter cage could be solution processed into transparent thin&#8208;layer films and mechanically stable dense self&#8208;standing membranes of controllable thickness. Thanks to these peculiar features, the membranes were also successfully tested for gas permeation, reporting a behavior similar to that found with stiff glassy polymers such as polymers of intrinsic microporosity or polyimides. Given the growing interest in the development of molecular&#8208;based membranes, for example for separation technologies and functional coatings, the properties of this organic cage were investigated by thorough analysis of their structural, thermal, mechanical and gas transport properties, and by detailed atomistic simulations.

         <title>Synergistic Promotion of Large&#8208;Current Water Splitting through Interfacial Engineering of Hierarchically Structured CoP&#8722;FeP Nanosheets with Rich P Vacancies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 56, October 9, 2023. </description>

A CoP&#8722;FeP heterostructure catalyst with abundant P vacancies (Vp&#8722;CoP&#8722;FeP/NF) on nickel foam is constructed through impregnation and phosphorization. It demonstrates excellent hydrogen evolution performance and has practical application prospects in high&#8208;current overall water splitting. The catalyst&#8216;s unique hierarchical nanosheet structure, plentiful P vacancies and synergistic effect of CoP and FeP accelerate HER kinetics, resulting in its superior performance.







Abstract
The development of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalysts with high performance under large current density is still a challenge. Introducing P vacancies in heterostructure is an appealing strategy to enhance HER kinetics. This study investigates a CoP&#8722;FeP heterostructure catalyst with abundant P vacancies (Vp&#8722;CoP&#8722;FeP/NF) on nickel foam (NF), which was prepared using dipping and phosphating treatment. The optimized Vp&#8722;CoP&#8722;FeP catalyst exerted prominent HER catalytic capability, requiring an ultra&#8208;low overpotential (58&#8197;mV @ 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and displaying robust durability (50&#8197;h @ 200&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) in 1.0&#8197;M KOH solution. Furthermore, the catalyst demonstrated superior overall water splitting activity as cathode, demanding only cell voltage of 1.76&#8197;V at 200&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, outperforming Pt/C/NF(&#8722;) || RuO2/NF(+). The catalyst&#8216;s outstanding performance can be attributed to the hierarchical structure of porous nanosheets, abundant P vacancies, and synergistic effect between CoP and FeP components, which promote water dissociation and H* adsorption and desorption, thereby synergically accelerating HER kinetics and enhancing HER activity. This study demonstrates the potential of HER catalysts with phosphorus&#8208;rich vacancies that can work under industrial&#8208;scale current density, highlighting the importance of developing durable and efficient catalysts for hydrogen production.

         <title>Spontaneous Decoration of Ultrasmall Pt Nanoparticles on Size&#8208;Separated MoS2 Nanosheets</title>

Size of liquid exfoliated MoS2 nanosheets plays a crucial role in determining nanoparticle decoration densities in the spontaneous reduction of chloroplatinic acid into ultrasmall Pt nanoparticles.







Abstract
Liquid exfoliation can be considered as a viable approach for the scalable production of 2D materials due to its various benefits, although the polydispersity in the obtained nanosheet size hinders their straightforward incorporation. Size&#8208;separation can help alleviate these concerns, however a correlation between nanosheet size and property needs to be established to bring about size&#8208;specific applicability. Herein, size&#8208;selected aqueous nanosheet dispersions have been obtained via centrifugation&#8208;based protocols, and their chemical activity in the spontaneous reduction of chloroplatinic acid is investigated. Growth of ultrasmall Pt nanoparticles was achieved on nanosheet surfaces without a need for reducing agents, and stark differences in the nanoparticle coverage were observed as a function of nanosheet size. Defects in the nanosheets were probed via Raman spectroscopy, and correlated to the observed size&#8208;activity. Additionally, the effect of reaction temperature during synthesis was investigated. The electrochemical activity of the ultrasmall Pt nanoparticle decorated MoS2 nanosheets was evaluated for the hydrogen evolution reaction, and enhancement in performance was observed with nanosheet size, and nanoparticle decoration density. These findings shine light on the significance of nanosheet size in controlling spontaneous reduction reactions, and provide a deeper insight to intrinsic properties of liquid exfoliated nanosheets.

Size-separation can help alleviate these concerns, however a correlation between nanosheet size and property needs to be established to bring about size-specific applicability. Herein, size-selected aqueous nanosheet dispersions have been obtained via centrifugation-based protocols, and their chemical activity in the spontaneous reduction of chloroplatinic acid is investigated. Growth of ultrasmall Pt nanoparticles was achieved on nanosheet surfaces without a need for reducing agents, and stark differences in the nanoparticle coverage were observed as a function of nanosheet size. Defects in the nanosheets were probed via Raman spectroscopy, and correlated to the observed size-activity. Additionally, the effect of reaction temperature during synthesis was investigated. The electrochemical activity of the ultrasmall Pt nanoparticle decorated MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanosheets was evaluated for the hydrogen evolution reaction, and enhancement in performance was observed with nanosheet size, and nanoparticle decoration density. These findings shine light on the significance of nanosheet size in controlling spontaneous reduction reactions, and provide a deeper insight to intrinsic properties of liquid exfoliated nanosheets.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
A ferrocene&#8208;based tetradentate ligand featured with modular synthesis and rigid skeleton was reported. Its iron(II) complex facilitates asymmetric direct hydrogenation of ketones without the participation of extra strong&#8208;field ligand such as CO and isocyanide. Various chiral alcohols including the intermediate for montelukast could be prepared with satisfactory yields and enantioinduction.







Abstract
We herein reported the design and synthesis of a ferrocene&#8208;based tetradentate ligand that is featured with modular synthesis and rigid skeleton. Its iron(II) complex facilitates asymmetric direct hydrogenation of ketones without the participation of extra strong&#8208;field ligand such as CO and isocyanide. Hydride donor lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) converted non&#8208;reactive Fe(II) species to reactive Fe(II) hydride species. With this catalyst, various chiral alcohols including the intermediate for montelukast could be prepared with satisfactory yields and enantioinduction.

Detection of Ba2+: Herein, we report on a highly Ba2+&#8208;selective, Ba2+&#8208;sensitive and pH independent fluorescent probe with a high photostability in water (cf. TOC). This fluorescent probe is equipped with a benzo&#8208;21&#8208;crown&#8208;7 as a highly selective Ba2+ ionophore and a tetramethylated BODIPY fluorophore.







Abstract
Herein, we report on highly Ba2+ selective fluorescence sensing in water by a fluorescent probe consisting of a benzo&#8208;21&#8208;crown&#8208;7 as a Ba2+ binding unit (ionophore) and a tetramethylated BODIPY fluorophore as a fluorescence reporter. This fluorescent probe showed a Ba2+ induced fluorescence enhancement (FE) by a factor of 12&#177;1 independently of the pH value and a high Ba2+ sensitivity with a limit of detection (LOD) of (17.2&#177;0.3)&#8197;&#956;M. Moreover, a second fluorescent probe consisting of the same BODIPY fluorophore, but a benzo&#8208;18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 as a cation&#8208;responsive binding moiety, showed an even higher FE upon Ba2+ complexation by a factor of 85&#177;3 and a lower LOD of (13&#177;3)&#8197;&#956;M albeit a lower Ba2+ selectivity. The fluorescence sensing mechanism of Ba2+ was further investigated by time&#8208;resolved fluorescence as well as transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS) and it turned out that within these probes a blocking of a photoinduced electron transfer (PET) by Ba2+ is very likely responsible for the FE.

         <title>Direct Amination of Benzene with Ammonia by Flow Plasma Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 56, October 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Direct amination of benzene is demonstrated with a plasma microreactor. Using ammonia plasma, this process was optimized by studying the influence of temperature, residence time and power of the plasma. Various compounds were evaluated to study influence of double bond, conjugation, and aromaticity. Under optimized conditions, direct amination of benzene gave of total yield of 3.8&#8201;%.







Abstract
Amine derivatives, including aniline and allylic amines, can be formed in a single&#8208;step process from benzene and an ammonia plasma in a microreactor. Different process parameters such as temperature, residence time, and plasma power were evaluated to improve the reaction yield and its selectivity toward aminated products and avoid hydrogenated or oligomerized products. In parallel, simulation studies of the process have been carried out to propose a global mechanism and gain a better understanding of the influence of the different process parameters. The exploration of diverse related alkenes showed that the double bonds, conjugation, and aromatization influenced the amination mechanism. Benzene was the best reactant for amination based on the lifetime of radical intermediates. Under optimized conditions, benzene was aminated in the absence of catalyst with a yield of 3.8&#8201;% and a selectivity of 49&#8201;% in various amino compounds.

Abstract
Two wide&#8208;band&#8208;capturing donor&#8208;acceptor conjugates featuring bis&#8208;styrylBODIPY and perylenediimide (PDI) have been newly synthesized, and the occurrence of ultrafast excitation transfer from the 1PDI* to BODIPY, and a subsequent electron transfer from the 1BODIPY* to PDI have been demonstrated. Optical absorption studies revealed panchromatic light capture but offered no evidence of ground&#8208;state interactions between the donor and acceptor entities. Steady&#8208;state fluorescence and excitation spectral recordings provided evidence of singlet&#8208;singlet energy transfer in these dyads, and quenched fluorescence of bis&#8208;styrylBODIPY emission in the dyads suggested additional photo&#8208;events. The facile oxidation of bis&#8208;styrylBODIPY and facile reduction of PDI, establishing their relative roles of electron donor and acceptor, were borne out by electrochemical studies. The electrostatic potential surfaces of the S1 and S2 states, derived from time&#8208;dependent DFT calculations, supported excited charge transfer in these dyads. Spectro&#8208;electrochemical studies on one&#8208;electron&#8208;oxidized and one&#8208;electron&#8208;reduced dyads and the monomeric precursor compounds were also performed in a thin&#8208;layer optical cell under corresponding applied potentials. From this study, both bis&#8208;styrylBODIPY&#8901;+ and PDI&#8901;&#8722; could be spectrally characterizes and were subsequently used in characterizing the electron&#8208;transfer products. Finally, pump&#8211;probe spectral studies were performed in dichlorobenzene under selective PDI and bis&#8208;styrylBODIPY excitation to secure energy and electron&#8208;transfer evidence. The measured rate constants for energy transfer, kENT, were in the range of 1011&#8197;s&#8722;1, while the electron transfer rate constants, kET, were in the range of 1010&#8197;s&#8722;1, thus highlighting their potential use in solar energy harvesting and optoelectronic applications.

         <title>The Rapid Synthesis of Colibactin Warhead Model Compounds Using New Metal&#8208;Free Photocatalytic Cyclopropanation Reactions Facilitates the Investigation of Biological Mechanisms</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 56, October 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two new metal&#8208;free photocatalytic cyclopropanations employing eosin in the green solvent ethanol have been developed and then applied to the synthesis of colibactin warhead models. Using the models, we show what features can lead to nucleophilic addition at the cyclopropyl unit and which ones favor a ring expansion&#8208;addition sequence. We also show that copper could be responsible for catalyzing the known oxidation of the colibactin&#8208;DNA adduct.







Abstract
Herein, we report the synthesis of a series of colibactin warhead model compounds using two newly developed metal&#8208;free photocatalytic cyclopropanation reactions. These mild cyclopropanations expand the known applications of eosin within synthesis. A halogen atom transfer reaction mode has been harnessed so that dihalides can be used as the cyclopropanating agents. The colibactin warhead models were then used to provide new insight into two key mechanisms in colibactin chemistry. An explanation is provided for why the colibactin warhead sometimes undergoes a ring expansion&#8208;addition reaction to give fused cyclobutyl products while at other times nucleophiles add directly to the cyclopropyl unit (as when DNA adds to colibactin). Finally, we provide some evidence that Cu(II) chelated to colibactin may catalyze an important oxidation of the colibactin&#8208;DNA adduct. The Cu(I) generated as a result could then also play a role in inducing double strand breaks in DNA.

Undescribed aminosulfinates enabled the preparation of &#946;&#8208;fluoroalkylamines in a photocatalyzed addition reaction of the corresponding aminodifluoroalkyl radicals to electron&#8208;deficient, electron&#8208;rich alkenes and vinylaryls or unactivated alkenes.







Abstract
The synthesis of undescribed &#946;&#8208;aminodifluoroethylsulfinates and their uses in the hydroaminodifluoroalkylation of alkenes is reported. This reaction is performed in the presence of a photocatalyst (4CzIPN, Ru complexes) and enables the direct incorporation of a &#946;&#8208;difluoroamine moiety into vinylic aryls, unactivated alkenes, and electron&#8208;rich, or &#8208;deficient alkenes. The mechanism was studied, and the formation of a gem&#8208;difluoromethyl radical was observed after the selective oxidation of the sulfinate function.

         <title>Rapid Unambiguous Structure Elucidation of Streptnatamide A, a New Cyclic Peptide Isolated from A Marine&#8208;derived Streptomyces sp</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 56, October 9, 2023. </description>

An inspiring collaboration between pharmaceutical industry and academia enabled discovery, structure elucidation, and biosynthetic pathway analysis of streptnatamide A, a new cyclic peptide isolated from secondary metabolites of a marine invertebrate&#8208;associated Streptomyces sp. This study highlights the application of mass spectrometry tools that enables the rapid unambiguous structure elucidation of this complex molecule.







Abstract
Cyclic peptides have been excellent source of drug leads. With the advances in discovery platforms, the pharmaceutical industry has a growing interest in cyclic peptides and has pushed several into clinical trials. However, structural complexity of cyclic peptides brings extreme challenges for structure elucidation efforts. Isotopic fine structure analysis, Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and detailed tandem mass spectrometry rapidly provided peptide sequence for streptnatamide A, a cyclic peptide isolated from a marine&#8208;derived Streptomyces sp. Marfey's analysis determined the stereochemistry of all amino acids, enabling the unambiguous structure determination of this compound. A non&#8208;ribosomal peptide synthetase biosynthetic gene cluster (stp) was tentatively identified and annotated for streptnatamide A based on the in silico analysis of whole genome sequencing data. These analytical tools will be powerful tools to overcome the challenges for cyclic peptide structure elucidation and accelerate the development of bioactive cyclic peptides.

         <dc:description>
A convenient three&#8208;component tetrafluoroethylation reaction of alkenes induced by visible light has been developed using 1,1,2,2&#8208;tetrafluoroethylsulfonyl chloride and quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones. This method provides a facile approach to introduce the HCF2CF2 group into organic molecules under mild conditions, enabling the late&#8208;stage modification of biologically active and drug molecules.







Abstract
1,1,2,2&#8208;Tetrafluoroethyl&#8208;containing compounds are valuable structures due to their unique physicochemical properties, which have increasing potential application in drug discovery. However, synthetic methods for preparing such compounds are rare. Herein, we report the first use of 1,1,2,2&#8208;tetrafluoroethanesulfonyl chloride to introduce the HCF2CF2 group into organic molecules via a three&#8208;component, radical tetrafluoroethyl&#8208;heteroarylation of alkenes with readily available quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones. This method provides a new and facile approach for late&#8208;stage functionalization of potential biologically active molecules.

         <title>Induction and Stabilization of Columnar Mesophases in Fluorinated Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons by Arene&#8208;Perfluoroarene Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 56, October 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The efficient synthesis of fluorous polyaromatic hydrocarbons via the arene&#8208;fluorine nucleophilic substitution reaction offers a fast and clean synthetic route to highly &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems of interest for organic electronics. The development of long&#8208;range noncovalent arene&#8208;fluoroarene interactions enables the formation of broader and thermally more stable mesophases than their hydrogenated counterparts, as well as supramolecular luminescent gels and films.







Abstract
The straightforward synthesis of several Fluorinated Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons by the efficient, transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free, arene fluorine nucleophilic substitution reaction is described, and the full investigation of their liquid crystalline and optical properties reported. The key precursors for this study, i.&#8201;e. 2,2&#8217;&#8208;dilithio&#8208;4,4&#8242;,5,5&#8242;&#8208;tetraalkoxy&#8208;1,1&#8217;&#8208;biphenyl derivatives, were obtained in two steps from the highly selective Scholl oxidative homo&#8208;coupling of 3,4&#8208;dialkoxy&#8208;1&#8208;bromobenzene, followed by quantitative double&#8208;lithiation. In situ room temperature nucleophilic annulation with either perfluorobenzene or perfluoronaphthalene leads to 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrafluoro&#8208;6,7,10,11&#8208;tetraalkxoytriphenylenes and 9,10,11,12,13,14&#8208;hexafluoro&#8208;2,3,6,7&#8208;tetraalkoxybenzo[f]tetraphenes, respectively, in good yields. Exploiting the same strategy, subsequent double annulations resulted in the formation of 9,18&#8208;difluoro&#8208;2,3,6,7,11,12,15,16&#8208;octa(alkoxy)tribenzo[f,k,m]tetraphenes and 9,10,19,20&#8208;tetrafluoro&#8208;2,3,6,7,12,13,16,17&#8208;octakis(hexyloxy)tetrabenzo[a,c,j,l]tetracenes, respectively. Despite the presence of only four alkoxy chains, the polar &#8220;Janus&#8221; mesogens display a columnar hexagonal mesophase over broad temperature ranges, with higher mesophase stability than the archetypical 2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexa(alkoxy)triphenylenes and their hydrogenated counterparts. The improvement or induction of mesomorphism is attributed to efficient antiparallel face&#8208;to&#8208;face &#960;&#8208;stacking driven by the establishment of non&#8208;covalent perfluoroarene&#8208;arene intermolecular interactions. The larger lipophilic discotic &#960;&#8208;extended compounds also exhibit columnar mesomorphism, over similar temperature ranges and stability than their hydrogenated homologs. Finally, these fluorinated molecules form stringy gels in various solvents, and show interesting solvatochromic emission properties in solution as well as strong emission in thin films and gels.

     alt="Induction and Stabilization of Columnar Mesophases in Fluorinated Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons by Arene-Perfluoroarene Interactions"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The efficient synthesis of fluorous polyaromatic hydrocarbons&lt;/b&gt; via the arene-fluorine nucleophilic substitution reaction offers a fast and clean synthetic route to highly &#960;-conjugated systems of interest for organic electronics. The development of long-range noncovalent arene-fluoroarene interactions enables the formation of broader and thermally more stable mesophases than their hydrogenated counterparts, as well as supramolecular luminescent gels and films.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The straightforward synthesis of several Fluorinated Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons by the efficient, transition-metal-free, arene fluorine nucleophilic substitution reaction is described, and the full investigation of their liquid crystalline and optical properties reported. The key precursors for this study, i.&#8201;e. 2,2&#8217;-dilithio-4,4&#8242;,5,5&#8242;-tetraalkoxy-1,1&#8217;-biphenyl derivatives, were obtained in two steps from the highly selective Scholl oxidative homo-coupling of 3,4-dialkoxy-1-bromobenzene, followed by quantitative double-lithiation. In situ room temperature nucleophilic annulation with either perfluorobenzene or perfluoronaphthalene leads to 1,2,3,4-tetrafluoro-6,7,10,11-tetraalkxoytriphenylenes and 9,10,11,12,13,14-hexafluoro-2,3,6,7-tetraalkoxybenzo[&lt;i&gt;f&lt;/i&gt;]tetraphenes, respectively, in good yields. Exploiting the same strategy, subsequent double annulations resulted in the formation of 9,18-difluoro-2,3,6,7,11,12,15,16-octa(alkoxy)tribenzo[&lt;i&gt;f&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;]tetraphenes and 9,10,19,20-tetrafluoro-2,3,6,7,12,13,16,17-octakis(hexyloxy)tetrabenzo[&lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;j&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;l&lt;/i&gt;]tetracenes, respectively. Despite the presence of only four alkoxy chains, the polar &#8220;Janus&#8221; mesogens display a columnar hexagonal mesophase over broad temperature ranges, with higher mesophase stability than the archetypical 2,3,6,7,10,11-hexa(alkoxy)triphenylenes and their hydrogenated counterparts. The improvement or induction of mesomorphism is attributed to efficient antiparallel face-to-face &#960;-stacking driven by the establishment of non-covalent perfluoroarene-arene intermolecular interactions. The larger lipophilic discotic &#960;-extended compounds also exhibit columnar mesomorphism, over similar temperature ranges and stability than their hydrogenated homologs. Finally, these fluorinated molecules form stringy gels in various solvents, and show interesting solvatochromic emission properties in solution as well as strong emission in thin films and gels.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Three Oxidative Addition Routes of Alkali Metal Aluminyls to Dihydridoaluminates and Reactivity with CO2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 56, October 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three distinct methods have been studied to convert alkali metal aluminyls, AM[Al(NONDipp)] (AM=Li&#8722;Cs) to dihydridoaluminates AM[Al(NONDipp)(H)2], which in turn reduce CO2 to bis&#8208;formates AM[Al(NONDipp)(O2CH)2]. Diverting from its usual proton&#8208;hydride releasing behaviour, 1,4&#8208;cyclohexadiene undergoes a remarkable oxidative addition in a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 stoichiometric reaction with Cs[Al(NONDipp)] yielding the inverse sandwich compound [{Cs(Et2O)}2{Al(NONDipp)(H)}2(C6H6)] (pictured).







Abstract
Three distinct routes are reported to the soluble, dihydridoaluminate compounds, AM[Al(NONDipp)(H)2] (AM=Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs; [NONDipp]2&#8722;=[O(SiMe2NDipp)2]2&#8722;; Dipp=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3) starting from the alkali metal aluminyls, AM[Al(NONDipp)]. Direct H2 hydrogenation of the heavier analogues (AM=Rb, Cs) produced the first examples of structurally characterized rubidium and caesium dihydridoaluminates, although harsh conditions were required for complete conversion. Using 1,4&#8208;cyclohexadiene (1,4&#8208;CHD) as an alternative hydrogen source in transfer hydrogenation reactions provided a lower energy pathway to the full series of products for AM=Li&#8722;Cs. A further moderation in conditions was noted for the thermal decomposition of the (silyl)(hydrido)aluminates, AM[Al(NONDipp)(H)(SiH2Ph)]. Probing the reaction of Cs[Al(NONDipp)] with 1,4&#8208;CHD provided access to a novel inverse sandwich complex, [{Cs(Et2O)}2{Al(NONDipp)(H)}2(C6H6)], containing the 1,4&#8208;dialuminated [C6H6]2&#8722; dianion and representing the first time that an intermediate in the commonly utilized oxidation process of 1,4&#8208;CHD to benzene has been trapped. The synthetic utility of the newly installed Al&#8722;H bonds has been demonstrated by their ability to reduce CO2 under mild conditions to form the bis&#8208;formate AM[Al(NONDipp)(O2CH)2] compounds, which exhibit a diverse series of eyecatching bimetallacyclic structures.

         <title>Inhibition of Amyloid &#946; Aggregation and Cytotoxicity by Berbamine Hydrochloride</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 56, October 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The inhibitory effects of berbamine hydrochloride (BBMH) on A&#946; aggregation were comprehensively evaluated using several widely&#8208;used biophysical assays. Furthermore, the inhibitory mechanisms of BBMH were elucidated through SPR analysis and chemical kinetics analysis. These findings suggest that bisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloids hold great promise in the battle against Alzheimer's disease.







Abstract
Alzheimer's disease (AD) continues to be a major global health challenge, and the recent approval of Aduhelm and Leqembi has opened new avenues for its treatment. Small&#8208;molecule inhibitors targeting A&#946; aggregation hold promise as an alternative to monoclonal antibodies. In this study, we evaluated the ability of berbamine hydrochloride (BBMH), a member of the bisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloids, to reduce A&#946; aggregation and cytotoxicity. Thioflavin T kinetics, circular dichroism spectroscopy, and atomic force microscopy results indicated that BBMH effectively inhibited A&#946; aggregation. Surface plasmon resonance and molecular docking results further revealed that BBMH could bind to A&#946; fibrils, thereby hindering the aggregation process. This physical picture has been confirmed in a quantitative way by chemical kinetics analysis, which showed BBMH tends to bind with the fibril ends and thus prevents the transition from protofibrils to mature fibrils as well as the elongation process. Additionally, our MTT results showed that BBMH was able to reduce the cytotoxicity of A&#946;40 on N2a cells. Our results demonstrate, for the first time, the potential of BBMH to inhibit A&#946; aggregation and cytotoxicity, offering a promising direction for further research and drug development efforts in the fight against Alzheimer's disease.

The intriguing tetracoordinate geometry of a dilithio methandiide complex is probed from a coordination chemistry perspective, demonstrating the sp2&#8208;hybridized nature of the methandiide carbon and the other (non&#8208;covalent) interactions responsible for its planarity.







Abstract
The reported tetracoordinate dilithio methandiide complex from Liddle and co&#8208;workers (1) is investigated from a coordination chemistry perspective, to probe the origin of its intriguing geometry. Through the application of a variety of computational techniques, non&#8208;covalent (steric, electrostatic) interactions are found to be dominant. Further, we arrive at a bonding description which emphasizes the tricoordinate sp2&#8208;hybridized nature of the central methandiide carbon, differing somewhat from the original proposal. Thus, 1 is distinct from other dilithio methandiides since it contains only one C&#8722;Li &#963;&#8208;bond, and is found to be comparable to a simple aryllithium compound, phenyllithium.

         <dc:description>
Seven&#8208;exo&#8208;dig hydrocarboxylation of internal alkynes was developed with gold&#8208;zinc bimetallic catalysts activating alkyne&#8208;tethered carboxylic acids via cooperative action of the gold and zinc sites. N&#8208;Substituents of the NHC ligand for gold complexes significantly affected their catalytic activities, in which a gold complex with a 2,6&#8208;dibenzhydryl&#8208;4&#8208;methylphenyl substituent served as the most effective catalyst for the seven&#8208;membered ring formation.







Abstract
Seven&#8208;exo&#8208;dig hydrocarboxylation of nonactivated internal alkynes with conformationally flexible linker chains was achieved with cooperative gold&#8208;zinc catalysts composed of an imidazo[1,5&#8208;a]pyridinylidene ligand including a bipyridine coordination site at the C5 position. A proximity effect of the gold and zinc sites was essential for their high catalytic activity, in which the internal alkyne activated by the cationic gold species was attacked by the carboxylic acid deprotonated by the basic zinc site. Using a gold(I)&#8208;complex with a bulky aromatic N&#8208;substituent, 2,6&#8208;dibenzhydryl&#8208;4&#8208;methylphenyl group, for the NHC ligand facilitated seven&#8208;membered ring formation while minimizing intermolecular hydrocarboxylation as an undesired side reaction. The reaction mechanism was investigated by quantum chemical calculations.

         <title>Highly Efficient Luminescence from a Red Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitter with Flexible Conformation of Ancillary Groups</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 56, October 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The freer it goes, the brighter it shines. Rigid structure usually shows a positive effect on the efficiency of TADF emitters. In this work, Ph&#8208;TPA with flexible conformation of ancillary groups exhibited higher efficiency than Mc&#8208;TPA with conformationally locked ancillary groups. The macrocycle in MC&#8208;TPA made a significant contribution to the reorganization energy, leading to a severe non&#8208;radiative decay.







Abstract
Robust scaffolds were typically applied in thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) molecules to suppress the non&#8208;radiative decay, trigger the fast spin&#8208;flipping, and enhance the light out&#8208;coupling efficiency. Herein, we disclosed for the first time the positive effect of flexible conformation of ancillary groups on the photophysical properties of TADF emitter. The red TADF emitter Ph&#8208;TPA with flexible conformation demonstrated small excited&#8208;state structural distortion and low reorganization energy compared to the counterpart Mc&#8208;TPA with a rigid macrocycle. Consequently, Ph&#8208;TPA showed an excellent photoluminescent quantum yield (PLQY) of 92&#8201;% and a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 30.6&#8201;% at 630&#8197;nm. This work could deepen our understanding of structure&#8208;property relationships of organic luminophores and help us to rationalize the design of efficient TADF materials.

         <title>Formation of a Hexaphosphido Cobalt Complex through P&#8722;P Condensation</title>

[4+2] condensation reaction of diphosphene [(ClImDipp)P2(Dipp)]OTf and diphosphanide [(ClImDipp)P2(Dipp)Cl] with the cyclo&#8208;P4 cobalt complex [K(18c&#8208;6)][(PHDI)Co(&#951;4&#8208;cyclo&#8208;P4)] forms a CoP6 complex, featuring an unusual hexaphosphido ligand composed of a cyclo&#8208;P5 ring and an exocyclic (ClImDipp)P moiety. 31P&#8197;NMR spectroscopic studies reveal that at ambient temperature, this CoP6 complex undergoes disproportionation into more stable CoP7 and CoP5 complexes.







Abstract
The reaction between diphosphorus derivatives [(ClImDipp)P2(Dipp)]OTf (1[OTf]) and [(ClImDipp)P2(Dipp)Cl] (1[Cl]) with the cyclotetraphosphido cobalt complex [K(18c&#8208;6)][(PHDI)Co(&#951;4&#8208;cyclo&#8208;P4)] (2) leads to the formation of complex [(PHDI)Co{&#951;4&#8208;cyclo&#8208;P6(Dipp)(ClImDipp)}] (3), which features an unusual hexaphosphido ligand [ClImDipp=4,5&#8208;dichloro&#8208;1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl, Dipp=2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl, 18c&#8208;6=18&#8208;crown&#8208;6, PHDI=bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)phenanthrene&#8208;9,10&#8208;diimine]. Complex 3 was obtained as a crystalline material with a moderate yield at low temperature. Upon exposure to ambient temperature, compound 3 slowly transforms into two other compounds, [K(18c&#8208;6)][(PHDI)Co(&#951;4&#8208;P7Dipp)] (4) and [(PHDI)Co{cyclo&#8208;P5(ClImDipp)}] (5). The novel complexes 3&#8211;5 were characterized using multinuclear NMR spectroscopy and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. To shed light on the formation of these compounds, a proposed mechanism based on 31P&#8197;NMR monitoring studies is presented.

         <title>Solid&#8208;Phase Synthesis of PROTACs and SNIPERs on Backbone Amide Linked (BAL) Resin</title>

         <dc:description>
Solid&#8208;phase approaches could offer many advantages over conventional PROTAC synthesis if the same chemistries and topographic diversity can be incorporated. We have examined solid&#8208;phase synthesis of both VHL&#8208;targeting PROTACS and IAP&#8208;targeting SNIPERS using backbone&#8208;amide linked (BAL resin) completing 8&#8211;11 step syntheses with products obtained with a single purification step.







Abstract
Developing straightforward but flexible approaches to PROTAC synthesis that can incorporate the structural elements of emerging designs can improve the quality and efficiency of PROTAC development. Solid&#8208;phase approaches could offer many advantages over conventional PROTAC synthesis if diverse chemistries and topographies can be incorporated. We have exploited the backbone&#8208;amide&#8208;linked (BAL) resin to employ an array of solid&#8208;phase organic reactions, providing access to VHL&#8208; and IAP&#8208;targeting degraders using the BRD4&#8208;targeting JQ1 conjugates as examples.

This study reports the synthesis of cofacial organic cage molecules containing aggregation&#8208;induced emissive (AIE) luminogens (AIEgens) through four&#8208;fold Cu(I)&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) &#8220;click&#8221; reactions. The shorter AIEgen, tetraphenylethylene (TPE), afforded two orientational isomers (TPE&#8208;CC&#8208;1A and TPE&#8208;CC&#8208;1B). The longer AIEgen, tetrabiphenylethylene (TBPE), afforded a single isomer (TBPE&#8208;CC&#8208;2). The click reaction employed is irreversible, yet it yielded remarkable four&#8208;fold click products above 40&#8201;%. The phenyl rings around the ethylene core generate propeller&#8208;shaped chirality owing to their orientation, which influences the chirality of the resulting cages. The shorter cages are a mixture of PP/MM isomers, while the longer ones are a mixture of PM/MP isomers, as evidenced by their x&#8208;ray structures. The newly synthesized cage molecules are emissive even in dilute solutions (THF) and exhibit enhanced AIE upon the addition of water. The aggregated cage molecules in aqueous solution exhibit turn&#8208;off emission sensing of nitroaromatic explosives, with selectivity to picric acid in the 25&#8211;38 nanomolar detection range.

A highly enantioselective cyanation of imines (up to &gt;99&#8201;%&#8201;ee) has been developed using well&#8208;designed C2&#8208;symmetric hydrogen bonding catalysts. This catalytic system is distinguished by its low catalyst loading (S/C up to 1000), high efficiency, extremely broad substrate scope, scalability and mild reaction conditions.







Abstract
A highly enantioselective cyanation of imines (up to &gt;99&#8201;%&#8201;ee) has been developed using well&#8208;designed C2&#8208;symmetric hydrogen bonding catalysts. The catalytic strategy was characterized with low catalyst loading (0.1&#8211;1&#8197;mol&#8201;%), easily accessible catalysts with diverse functional groups, and catalytic base additives. A wide range of imines, including the challenging N&#8208;Boc and N&#8208;Cbz protected ketimines and aldimines, as well as fluoroalkylated ketimines, were investigated under mild conditions to afford the products with good to excellent yields (up to 99&#8201;% yield) and high enantioselectivity (up to &gt;99&#8201;%&#8201;ee). Control experiments revealed that the multiple hydrogen bonding catalysts enhanced the reactivity and enantioselectivity of the Strecker reaction initiated by the base.

         <title>Cover Feature: The Cyanido&#8208;Sulfate Anion [SO3CN]&#8722; (Chem. Eur. J. 56/2023)</title>

Sulfur trioxide acts as a strong oxidizer towards halides as well as pseudohalides. Therefore, reactions of sulfur trioxide with cyanide anions do usually not lead to the formation of cyanido&#8208;sulfates anion but to oxidation of the cyanide ion. This problem can be avoided if a sulfur trioxide&#8208;pyridine complex is used instead of neat sulfur trioxide. In this way, the oxidation power is sufficiently reduced, and the pyridine molecule can be replaced by the cyanide anion under formation of the cyanido&#8208;sulfate anion, SO3CN&#8722;. Thus sulfur trioxide gets rid of the badly smelling pyridine molecule, however, at the expense of gaining the toxic cyanide anion. More information can be found in the Research Article by M.&#8197;S. Wickleder and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202301761).

Gas separation: A novel organic cage with excellent film&#8208;forming tendencies was processed into transparent, mechanically robust, self&#8208;standing membranes of controllable thickness. Thanks to their peculiar features, the membranes of the neat cage were successfully tested for gas permeation (e.g., with CO2), with behavior similar to that found with stiff glassy polymers such as polymers of intrinsic microporosity or polyimides being reported. More information can be found in the Research Article by J.&#8197;C. Jansen, V. Amendola and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202301437).

Wide&#8208;band&#8208;capturing artificial photosynthetic model compounds featuring bisstyrylBODIPY and perylene diimide have been newly synthesized to probe excited&#8208;state energy and electron transfer. Excited&#8208;state DFT and free&#8208;energy calculations supported the occurrence of such photo events. Pump&#8211;probe spectroscopy provided the ultimate evidence wherein the measured rate constants for energy transfer were in the range of 1011&#8197;s&#8722;1, while the electron transfer rate constants were in the range of 10&#8197;s&#8722;1, thus highlighting their potential use in solar energy harvesting.

         <title>Critical Issues of Vanadium&#8208;Based Cathodes Towards Practical Aqueous Zn&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 56, October 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review aims to provide an overview of the key obstacles encountered by vanadium&#8208;based cathodes toward practical aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries, encompassing dissolution, by&#8208;product formation, and limited ion diffusion. Additionally, it highlights the latest advancements made in tackling these challenges and proposes potential directions for future research in this domain.







Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) are gaining significant attention for their numerous advantages, including high safety, high energy density, affordability, and environmental friendliness. However, the development of ZIBs has been hampered by the lack of suitable cathode materials that can store Zn2+ with high capacity and reversibility. Currently, vanadium&#8208;based materials with tunnel or layered structures are widely researched owing to their high theoretical capacity and diversified structures. However, their long&#8208;term cycling stability is unsatisfactory because of material dissolution, phase transformation, and restrictive kinetics in aqueous electrolytes, which limits their practical applications. Different from previous reviews on ZIBs, this review specifically addresses the critical issues faced by vanadium&#8208;based cathodes for practical aqueous ZIBs and proposes potential solutions. Focusing on vanadium&#8208;based cathodes, their ion storage mechanisms, the critical parameters affecting their performance, and the progress made in addressing the aforementioned problems are also summarized. Finally, future directions for the development of practical aqueous ZIB are suggested.

         <title>Hydroelementation and Phosphinidene Transfer: Reactivity of Phosphagermenes and Phosphastannenes Towards Small Molecule Substrates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of [(Me3Si)2CH]2E=PMes* (E=Ge, Sn) from the reaction of the tetrylenes with a phospha&#8208;Wittig reagent is described. Reactivity studies reveal that they are capable of undergoing hydroelementation reactions across the E=P bond and of acting as masked phosphinidene sources.







Abstract
We describe the facile synthesis of [(Me3Si)2CH]2E=PMes* (E=Ge, Sn) from the reaction of the tetrylenes with the phospha&#8208;Wittig reagent, Me3P&#8722;PMes*. Their reactivity towards a range of substrates with protic and hydridic E&#8722;H bonds (E=N, O, Si) is described. In addition to hydroelementation reactions of the E=P bonds, we show that these compounds, particularly [(Me3Si)2CH]2Sn=PMes*, also act as base&#8208;stabilized phosphinidenes, allowing phosphinidene transfer to other nucleophiles.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two highly stable, novel, triply fused dinickel(II)/dicopper(II) chlorin&#8208;porphyrin dication diradical heterodimers are reported in which the bridge is completely fused between two porphyrin macrocycles. UV&#8208;vis, EPR, and ESI&#8208;MS investigations enabled us to identify some of the key reactive intermediates disclosing tentative mechanistic details of such an unusual transformation.







Abstract
We report an unexpected rearrangement, controlled by the nature of the bridge, leading to the formation of novel, remarkably stable triply fused dinickel(II)/dicopper(II) chlorin&#8208;porphyrin dication diradical heterodimers in excellent yields. Here, a dipyrromethene bridge gets completely fused between two porphyrin macrocycles with two new C&#8722;C and one C&#8722;N bonds. The two macrocycles exhibit extensive &#960;&#8208;conjugation through the bridge, which results in an antiferromagnetic coupling between the two &#960;&#8208;cation radicals. In addition, the macrocyclic distortion also favours a rare intramolecular ferromagnetic interaction between the CuII and &#960;&#8208;cation radical spins to form a triplet state. The structural and electronic perturbation in the unconjugated dication diradical possibly enables the bridging pyrrolic nitrogen to undergo a nucleophilic attack at the nearby &#946;&#8208;carbon of the porphyrin &#960;&#8208;cation radical with a computed free energy barrier of &gt;20&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 which was supplied in the form of reflux condition to initiate such a rearrangement process. UV&#8208;vis, EPR and ESI&#8208;MS spectroscopies were used to monitor the rearrangement process in&#8197;situ in order to identify the key reactive intermediates leading to such an unusual transformation.

         <title>Carbon Nitrides from Supramolecular Crystals: From Single Atoms to Heterojunctions and Advanced Photoelectrodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular single crystals based on C&#8722;N monomers are used to prepared carbon nitride materials with tailored morphology and porosity, single atom catalysts or heterojunctions. This approach can be applied to fabricate efficient water splitting photoelectrodes.







Abstract
Carbon nitride materials (CN) have become one of the most studied photocatalysts within the last 15&#8197;years. While CN absorbs visible light, its low porosity and fast electron&#8208;hole recombination hinder its photoelectric performance and have motivated the research in the modification of its physical and chemical properties (such as energy band structure, porosity, or chemical composition) by different means. In this Concept we review the utilization of supramolecular crystals as CN precursors to tailor its properties. We elaborate on the features needed in a supramolecular crystal to serve as CN precursor, we delve on the influence of metal&#8208;free crystals in the morphology and porosity of the resulting materials and then discuss the formation of single atoms and heterojunctions when employing a metal&#8208;organic crystal. We finally discuss the performance of CN photoanodes derived from crystals and highlight the current standing challenges in the field.

         <title>Intramolecular Through&#8208;Space Double&#8208;Electron Transfer Between A Pair of Redox&#8208;Active Guanidine Units Aligned by Dithiolate Bridges</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transfer in pairs: Intramolecular through&#8208;space electron transfer between an oxidized, dicationic and a reduced, neutral triguanidine unit is observed if the two units are preorientated by a dithiolate bridge.







Abstract
Using unconventional synthesis protocols, two redox&#8208;active triguanidine units are connected by a dithiolate bridge, aligning the two redox&#8208;active units in close proximity. The reduced, neutral and the tetracationic redox states with two dicationic triguanidine units are isolated and fully characterized. Then, the dicationic redox states are prepared by mixing the neutral and tetracationic molecules. At low temperatures, the dications are diamagnetic (singlet ground state) with two different triguanidine units (neutral and dicationic). At room temperature, the triplet state with two radical monocationic triguanidine units is populated. At low temperature (210&#8197;K), chemical exchange by intramolecular through&#8208;space electron&#8208;transfer between the two triguanidine units is evidenced by EXSY NMR spectroscopy. Intramolecular through&#8208;space transfer of two electrons from the neutral to the dicationic triguanidine unit is accompanied by migration of the counterions in opposite direction. The rate of double&#8208;electron transfer critically depends on the bridge. No electron&#8208;transfer is measured in the absence of a bridge (in a mixture of one dicationic and one neutral triguanidine), and relatively slow electron transfer if the bridge does not allow the two triguanidine units to approach each other close enough. The results give detailed, quantitative insight into the factors that influence intramolecular through&#8208;space double&#8208;electron&#8208;transfer processes.

         <title>Yttrium Complexes with Group 13 Heterobenzene&#8208;Type Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The gallabenzene&#8208;type yttrium complex [(1&#8208;Me&#8208;3,5&#8208;tBu2&#8722;C5H3Ga)(&#956;&#8208;Me)Y(2,4&#8208;dtbp)] (A) is readily formed from one&#8208;pot&#8208;reactions using mixtures [YMe3]n/GaMe3/K(2,4&#8208;dtbp) (2,4&#8208;dtbp=2,4&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;pentadienyl), while the remaining pentadienyl ligand gets easily displaced by pentamethylcyclopentadienyl affording B, showcasing the strong interaction of the heterobenzene ligand with the rare&#8208;earth&#8208;metal center. Distinct ligand bonding is revealed by 89Y&#8197;NMR chemical shifts.







Abstract
The yttrium gallabenzene complex [(1&#8208;Me&#8208;3,5&#8208;tBu2&#8722;C5H3Ga)(&#956;&#8208;Me)Y(2,4&#8208;dtbp)] is accessible from Y(GaMe4)3 and K(2,4&#8208;dtbp) via a tandem salt metathesis/methane elimination (2,4&#8208;dtbp=2,4&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;pentadienyl).

The yttrium center in [(1&#8208;Me&#8208;3,5&#8208;tBu2&#8722;C5H3E)(&#956;&#8208;Me)Y(2,4&#8208;dtbp)] readily forms adducts with neutral Lewis bases like 4&#8208;DMAP (4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine), PMe3, DMPE (1,2&#8208;bis(dimethylphosphino)ethane), and DME (1,2&#8208;dimethoxyethane). In stark contrast, addition of TMEDA (N,N,N&#8217;,N&#8217;&#8208;tetramethylethylenediamine) results in methyl/pentadienyl exchange between aluminum and yttrium resulting in [(1&#8208;(2,4&#8208;dtbp)&#8208;1&#8208;Me&#8208;3,5&#8208;tBu2&#8722;C5H3Al)Y(Me)(tmeda)]. The bonding features of the newly synthesized complexes are analyzed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) and heteronuclear (89Y, 31P) NMR spectroscopy.

         <title>Solid&#8208;State [4+4] Cycloaddition and Cycloreversion with Use of Unpaired Hydrogen&#8208;Bond Donors to Achieve Solvatomorphism and Stabilization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The solid&#8208;state [4+4] cycloaddition of a commercially available anthracene derivative affords facile synthesis of a cycloadduct. The cycloaddition is reversible in the solid&#8208;state using heat or mechanical force. The cycloadduct is highly solvatomorphic due to presence of unused, strong hydrogen&#8208;bond donors and is applied to the thermal stabilization of monomers.







Abstract
The crystal structure of a commercially available anthracene derivative, anthracene&#8208;9&#8208;thiocarboxamide, is reported here for the first time. The compound undergoes a [4+4] cycloaddition in the solid state to afford facile synthesis of the cycloadduct (CA). The cycloaddition is also reversible in the solid state using heat or mechanical force. Due to the presence of unpaired, strong hydrogen&#8208;bond donor atoms on the CA, significant solvatomorphism is achieved, and components of the solvatomorphs self&#8208;assemble into four different classes of supramolecular structures. The CA readily crystallizes with a variety of structurally&#8208;diverse solvents including those containing oxygen&#8208;, nitrogen&#8208;, or pi&#8208;acceptors. Some of the solvents the CA crystallized with include thiophene, benzene, and the three xylene isomers; thus, the CA was employed in industrially&#8208;relevant solvent separation. However, in competition studies, the CA did not exhibit selectivity. Lastly, it is demonstrated that the CA crystallizes with vinyl&#8208;containing monomers and is currently the only compound that crystallizes with both widely used monomers 4&#8208;vinylpyridine and styrene. Solid&#8208;state complexation of the CA with the monomers affords over a 50&#8201;&#176;C increase in the monomer's thermal stabilities. The strategy of designing molecules with unused donors can be applied to achieve separations or volatile liquid stabilization.

         <title>A Combination of B&#8208; and N&#8208;Doped &#960;&#8208;Systems Enabling Systematic Tuning of Electronic Structures and Properties</title>

B/N&#8208;codoped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were constructed via combining the B&#8208; and N&#8208;doped &#960;&#8208;systems. Two B/N&#8208;codoped PAHs were synthesized through the Mallory photoreaction, and their electronic structures and optical properties could be effectively modulated via static and dynamic control of intramolecular charge transfer states.







Abstract
Doping heteroatoms into polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) may alter their structures and thereby physical properties. This study reports the construction of B/N&#8208;codoped PAHs via combining the B&#8208; and N&#8208;doped &#960;&#8208;systems. Two &#960;&#8208;extended B/N&#8208;codoped PAHs were synthesized through the Mallory photoreaction. Both feature a C48BN2 &#960;&#8208;skeleton, which is assembled by linearly fusing three substructures including B&#8208;doped and sp2&#8208;hybridized N&#8208;doped &#960;&#8208;moieties and one pyrene unit. In comparison to the pristine B&#8208;doped analog, their intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) states are distinctly modulated by the fused N&#8208;doped &#960;&#8208;system and the further incorporated cyano group, leading to their tunable optical properties, as revealed by detailed theoretical and experimental analysis. Furthermore, these three molecules have sufficient Lewis acidity and can coordinate with Lewis base to form Lewis acid&#8208;base adducts, and notably, such intermolecular complexation can further dynamically modulate their ICT transitions and thereby photophysical properties, such as producing blue, green and red fluorescence.

         <title>Chemistry and Biology of Podophyllotoxins&#8722;An Update</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Podophyllotoxin is an aryltetralin lignan lactone derived from different plants of Podophyllum. It consists of five rings with four chiral centers, one trans&#8208;lactone and one aryl tetrahydronaphthalene skeleton with multiple modification sites. Moreover, podophyllotoxin and its derivatives showed lots of bioactivities, including anticancer, anti&#8208;inflammatory, antiviral, and insecticidal properties. The demand for podophyllotoxin and its derivatives is rising as a result of their high efficacy. As a continuation of our previous review (Chem. Eur. J., 2017, 23, 4467&#8208;4526), herein we summarized total synthesis, biotransformation, structural modifications, bioactivities, and structure&#8208;activity relationships of podophyllotoxin and its derivatives from 2017 to 2022. Meanwhile, we compiled an update information on the origin of new podophyllotoxin analogues from plants from 2014 to 2022. We hope that this review will provide a reference for future high value&#8211;added applications of podophyllotoxin and its analogues in the pharmaceutical and agricultural fields</dc:description>

         <title>Acceptorless or Transfer Dehydrogenation of Glycerol Catalyzed by Base Metal Salt Cobaltous Chloride &#8211; Facile Access to Lactic Acid and Hydrogen or Isopropanol</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The dehydrogenation of glycerol to lactic acid (LA) under both acceptorless and transfer dehydrogenation conditions using readily available, inexpensive, environmentally benign and earth&#8208;abundant base metal salt CoCl2 is reported here. The CoCl2 (0.5 mol%) catalyzed acceptorless dehydrogenation of glycerol at 160 &#176;C in the presence of 0.75 equiv of KOH, gave up to 33% yield of LA in 44% selectivity apart from hydrogen. Alternatively, with acetone as a sacrificial hydrogen acceptor, the CoCl2 (0.5 mol%) catalyzed dehydrogenation of glycerol at 160 &#176;C in the presence of 1.1 equiv of NaOtBu resulted in up to 93% LA with 96% selectivity along with another value&#8208;added product isopropanol. Labelling studies revealed a modest secondary KIE of 1.68 which points to the involvement of C&#8208;H bond activation as a part of the catalytic cycle but not as a part of the rate&#8208;determining step. Catalyst poisoning experiments with PPh3 and CS2 are indicative of the homogeneous nature of the reaction mixture involving&#160;molecular species that are likely to be in&#8208;situ formed octahedral Co(II) as inferred from EPR, HRMS and Evans magnetic moment studies. The net transfer dehydrogenation activity is attributed to exclusive contribution from the alcoholysis step.</dc:description>

Diradicals: Simple, modular and convergent access to diradicals with controllable S&#8722;T gap demonstrated with two examples.







Abstract
Reactions of a benzo[e][1,2,4]triazine with dilithiobenzenes lead to di&#8208;Blatter diradicals connected at the N(1) positions via a spin coupling unit, 1,4&#8208;phenylene or 1,3&#8208;phenylene. Electrochemical analysis in MeCN revealed four one&#8208;electron redox processes separated by 0.1&#8211;0.3&#8197;V in both diradicals. Variable temperature EPR measurements in polystyrene (PS) solid solutions gave the singlet&#8208;triplet energy gaps &#916;ES&#8208;T=2&#8197;J of &#8722;3.02(11) and &#8722;0.16(1)&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 for 1,4&#8208;phenylene and 1,3&#8208;phenylene derivatives, respectively. The latter negative value was attributed to conformational properties of the diradical in the PS solid solution. Results suggest a simple and efficient access to a family of stable Blatter diradicals with a controllable S&#8722;T gap through a judicious choice of the arylene coupling unit. DFT calculations indicate that the triplet state is stabilized by (het)arylenes with low LUMO.

         <dc:description>

Abstract
Gallium&#8208;based alloy liquid metal batteries currently face limitations such as volume expansion, unstable solid electrolyte interface (SEI) film and substantial capacity decay. In this study, amorphous titanium dioxide is used to coat eutectic GaSn nanodroplets (eGaSn NDs) to construct the core&#8208;shell structure of eGaSn@TiO2 nanodroplets (eGaSn@TiO2 NDs). The amorphous TiO2 shell (~6.5&#8197;nm) formed a stable SEI film, alleviated the volume expansion, and provided electron/ion transport channels to achieve excellent cycling performance and high specific capacity. The resulting eGaSn@TiO2 NDs exhibited high capacities of 580, 540, 515, 485, 456 and 426&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2 and 5&#8197;C, respectively. No significant decay was observed after more than 500&#8197;cycles with a capacity of 455&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 1&#8197;C. In situ X&#8208;ray diffraction (in&#8197;situ XRD) was used to explore the lithiation mechanism of the eGaSn negative electrode during discharge. This study elucidates the design of advanced liquid alloy&#8208;based negative electrode materials for high&#8208;performance liquid metal batteries (LMBs).

         <title>Rational design&#160;of a multifunctional benzothiadiazole derivative in organic photonics and electronics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In order to achieve a multifunctional compound with potential application in organic photonics and electronics, a multidonor benzothiadiazole derivative was rationally designed and synthesized employing microwave irradiation as energy source, increasing the process efficiency about yields and reaction times in comparison with conventional conditions. This powerful compound displayed solvatochromism and showed efficient behavior as red optical waveguide with low OLC around 10&#8208;2 dB &#956;m&#8208;1 and with the capacity of light transmission in two directions. In addition, the proposed derivative acted as efficient p&#8208;type semiconductor in organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs) with hole mobilities up 10&#8208;1 cm2V&#8208;1s&#8208;1. This corroborates its multifunctional character, thus making it a potential candidate to be applied in hybrid organic field&#8208;effect optical waveguides (OFEWs).</dc:description>

         <title>Bioinspired Functionalization of Carbonyl Compounds Enabled by Metal Chelated Bifunctional Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In Nature, enzymatic reactions proceed through exceptionally ordered transition states giving rise to extraordinary levels of stereoselection. In those reactions, the active site of the enzyme plays crucial roles &#8211; through one position, it holds the substrate in the proximity to the reaction epicentre that facilitates both the reactivity and stereoselectivity of the chemical process. Inspired by this natural phenomenon, synthetic chemists have designed bifunctional ligands that not only coordinate to a metal centre but also preassociate with an organic substrate, e.g. aldehyde and ketone, and exerts stereodirecting influence to accelerate the attack of the incoming reacting partner from a particular enantiotopic face. The chief goal of the current review is to give an overview of the recently developed approaches enabled by privileged bio&#8208;inspired bifunctional ligands that not only bind to the metal catalyst but also activates carbonyl substrates via organocatalysis, thereby easing in the new bond forming step. As carbonyl a&#8208;functionalizations are dominated by enamine and enolate chemistry, the current review primarily focusses on enamine&#8208; and enolate&#8208;metal catalysis by bifunctional ligands. Thus, developments based on traditional cooperative catalysis occurring through two directly coupled but independent catalytic cycles of an organocatalyst and a metal catalyst are not covered.</dc:description>

         <title>Revealing the unique role of water in the formation of benzothiazoles: an experimental and computational study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present here a joint experimental and computational study on the formation of benzothiazoles. Our investigation reveals a green protocol for accessing benzothiazoles from acyl chlorides using either water alongside a reducing agent as the reaction medium or in combination with stoichiometric amounts of a weak acid, instead of the harsh conditions and catalysts previously reported. Specifically, we show that a protic solvent, particularly water, enables the formation of 2&#8208;substituted benzothiazoles from N&#8208;acyl 1,2&#8208;aminothiophenols already at room temperature, without the need for strong acids or metal catalysts. DFT Molecular Dynamics simulations coupled with advanced enhanced sampling techniques provide a clear understanding of the catalytic role of water. We demonstrate how bulk water &#8211; due to its extended network of hydrogen bonds and an efficient Grotthus mechanism &#8211; provides a reaction path that strongly reduces the reaction barriers compared to aprotic environments, namely more than 80 kJ/mol for the first reaction step and 250 kJ/mol for the second. Finally, we discuss the influence of different aliphatic and aromatic substituents with varying electronic properties on chemical reactivity. Besides providing in&#8208;depth mechanistic insights, we believe that our findings pave the way for a greener route toward an important class of bioactive molecules.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>In the present work, several manganese(I) complexes of chelating heteroditopic ligands Mn1&#8208;3, featuring ImNHC (imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) connected to a 1,2,3&#8208;triazole&#8208;N or tzNHC (1,2,3&#8208;triazol&#8208;5&#8208;ylidene) donors via a methylene spacer, with possible modifications at the triazole backbone have been synthesized and completely characterized. Notably, the CO stretching frequencies, electrochemical analysis, and frontier orbital analysis certainly suggests that the chelating ImNHC&#8208;tzNHC ligands have stronger donation capabilities than the related ImNHC&#8208;Ntz ligand in the synthesized complexes. Moreover, these well&#8208;defined phosphine free Mn(I)&#8208;NHC complexes have been found to be effective non&#8208;bifunctional catalysts for the &#945;&#8208;alkylation of nitriles using alcohols and importantly, the catalyst Mn1 containing ImNHC connected to a weaker triazole&#8208;N donor displayed higher activity compared to Mn2/Mn3 containing an unsymmetrical bis&#8208;carbene donors (ImNHC and tzNHC). A wide range of aryl nitriles were coupled with diverse (hetero)aromatic as well as aliphatic alcohols to get the corresponding products in good to excellent yields (32 examples, up to 95% yield). The detailed mechanistic studies including deuterium labelling experiments reveal that the reaction follows a Borrowing Hydrogen pathway.</dc:description>

         <title>Isomeric effect of &#960; bridge in IDT&#8208;based nonfused electron photovoltaic acceptor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>One pair of isomers, IDT&#8208;BOF containing S&#183;&#183;&#183;O/F&#183;&#183;&#183;H noncovalently configurational locks and IDT&#8208;BFO containing F&#183;&#183;&#183;H/O&#183;&#183;&#183;H noncovalently configurational locks, were designed and synthesized with an acceptor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor (A&#8208;&#960;&#8208;D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A) structure by choosing 4,9&#8208;dihydro&#8208;s&#8208;indaceno[1,2&#8208;b:5,6&#8208;b']dithiophene (IDT) as the D unit, F/n&#8208;hexyloxy substituted phenyl ring as &#960; bridge, and 3&#8208;(dicyanomethylidene)indan&#8208;1&#8208;one as the A unit. Owing to the S&#183;&#183;&#183;O/F&#183;&#183;&#183;H or F&#183;&#183;&#183;H/O&#183;&#183;&#183;H noncovalently configurational locks, both IDT&#8208;BOF and IDT&#8208;BFO show completely planar structure. In comparison to IDT&#8208;BFO, IDT&#8208;BOF exhibits similar LUMO but higher HOMO energy levels, leading to a smaller optical bandgap and red&#8208;shifted absorption. However, IDT&#8208;BOF&#8208;based bulk&#8208;heterojunction organic solar cells (BHJ&#8208;OSCs) coupled with PBDB&#8208;T, and PCE&#8208;10 as donor materials both exhibited a lower PCE than that of IDT&#8208;BFO (PBDB&#8208;T: 5.2% vs. 6.1%; PCE&#8208;10: 1.7% vs. 3.2%). Comprehensively comparing and investigating IDT&#8208;BOF:PBDB&#8208;T and IDT&#8208;BFO:PBDB&#8208;T OSCs suggested that the large phase separation and serious charge recombination of IDT&#8208;BOF based OSCs contributed to its lower PCE.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;One pair of isomers, IDT-BOF containing S&#183;&#183;&#183;O/F&#183;&#183;&#183;H noncovalently configurational locks and IDT-BFO containing F&#183;&#183;&#183;H/O&#183;&#183;&#183;H noncovalently configurational locks, were designed and synthesized with an acceptor-&#960;-donor-&#960;-acceptor (A-&#960;-D-&#960;-A) structure by choosing 4,9-dihydro-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b']dithiophene (IDT) as the D unit, F/n-hexyloxy substituted phenyl ring as &#960; bridge, and 3-(dicyanomethylidene)indan-1-one as the A unit. Owing to the S&#183;&#183;&#183;O/F&#183;&#183;&#183;H or F&#183;&#183;&#183;H/O&#183;&#183;&#183;H noncovalently configurational locks, both IDT-BOF and IDT-BFO show completely planar structure. In comparison to IDT-BFO, IDT-BOF exhibits similar LUMO but higher HOMO energy levels, leading to a smaller optical bandgap and red-shifted absorption. However, IDT-BOF-based bulk-heterojunction organic solar cells (BHJ-OSCs) coupled with PBDB-T, and PCE-10 as donor materials both exhibited a lower PCE than that of IDT-BFO (PBDB-T: 5.2% vs. 6.1%; PCE-10: 1.7% vs. 3.2%).

         <title>Enabling N2 to ammonia conversion in Bi2WO6&#8208;based materials: A new avenue in photocatalytic applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The field of photocatalysis has been evolving since 1972 since Honda and Fujishima&#8217;s initial push for using light as an energy source to accomplish redox reactions. Since then, many photocatalysts have been studied, semiconductors or otherwise. A new photocatalytic application to convert N2 gas to ammonia (N2 fixation or nitrogen reduction reaction; NRR) has emerged. Many researchers have steered their research in this direction due to developments in the ease of ammonia detection through UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy. This concept will specifically discuss Bi2WO6&#8208;based materials, techniques to enhance their photocatalytic activity (CO2 reduction, H2 production, pollutant removal, etc.), and their current application in photocatalytic NRR. Initially, a brief introduction of Bi2WO6 along with its VB and CB potentials will be compared to various redox potentials. A final topic of interest would be a brief description of photocatalytic nitrogen fixation with additional consideration to Bi2WO6&#8208;based materials in N2 fixation. A major problem with photocatalytic NRR is the false ammonia quantification in Bi&#8208;based materials, which will be discussed in detail and also ways to minimize them.</dc:description>

         <title>Control of substrate conformation by hydrogen bonding in a retaining &#946;&#8208;endoglycosidase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bacterial &#946;&#8208;glycosidases are hydrolytic enzymes that depolymerize polysaccharides such as &#946;&#8208;cellulose, &#946;&#8208;glucans and &#946;&#8208;xylans from different sources, which are used in a myriad of biomedical and industrial applications. It has been shown that a conformational change of the substrate, from a relaxed 4C1 conformation to a distorted 1S3/1,4B conformation of the reactive sugar, is necessary for catalysis. However, the molecular determinants that stabilize the substrate&#8217;s distortion are poorly understood. Here we use quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM)&#8208;based molecular dynamics methods to assess the impact of the interaction between the reactive sugar, i.e. the one at subsite &#8208;1, and the catalytic nucleophile (a glutamate) on substrate conformation. We show that the hydrogen bond involving the C2 exocyclic group and the nucleophile controls substrate conformation: its presence preserves sugar distortion, whereas its absence (e.g. in an enzyme mutant) knocks it out. We also show that 2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;2&#8208;fluoro derivatives, widely used to trap the reaction intermediates by X&#8208;ray crystallography, reproduce the conformation of the hydrolysable substrate at the experimental conditions. These results highlight the importance of the 2&#8208;OH&#183;&#183;&#183;nucleophile interaction in substrate recognition and catalysis in endo&#8208;glycosidases and can inform mutational campaigns aimed to search for more efficient enzymes.</dc:description>

         <title>Iron(II) Complexes of P3&#8208;chain Ligands: Structural diversity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Iron(II) complexes containing ligands with a R2P&#8211;P&#8211;PR2 unit were synthesized by metathesis reactions. With R&#160;=&#160;tBu, a mixture of two isomers is formed; in one of them, the terminal phosphorus binds to the Fe center (ylidic structure), while in the other one, the central P atom is linked to Fe. Starting from differently functionalized parent triphosphanes and corresponding functionalized Fe complexes, the ratio of isomers does not change. The outcome of the reaction and therefore the binding modes of the triphosphane ligands in the resulting compounds can be influenced by the size of the substituents. In the case of R&#160;=&#160;iPr a chelate complex is formed (both terminal P atoms are linked to the Fe center). Applying the mixed&#8208;substituted triphosphane, the ylidic structure of the resulting complex is preferred. The new compounds were characterized by NMR spectroscopy in solution and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction in solid&#8208;state. The synthetic work was supported by DFT calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Extremely Stable Perylene Bisimide&#8208;Bridged Regioisomeric Diradicals and Their Redox Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Excellent stability is an essential premise for organic diradicals to be used in organic electronic and spintronic devices. Herein, we attach two tris(2,4,6&#8208;trichlorophenyl)methyl (TTM) radical building blocks to the two sides of perylene bisimide (PBI) bridges and obtain two regioisomeric diradicals (1,6&#8208;TTM&#8208;PBI and 1,7&#8208;TTM&#8208;PBI). Both of the isomers show super stability rather than the monomeric TTM under ambient conditions, due to the enlarged conjugation as well as the electron withdrawing effects from the PBI bridges. The diradicals show distinct and reversible multi&#8208;step redox processes, and the spectroelectrochemistry investigation reveals the generation of organic mixed&#8208;valence (MV) species during reduction processes. The two diradicals have singlet ground states, very small singlet&#8722;triplet energy gaps (&#916;ES&#8208;T) and a pure open&#8208;shell character (with diradical character y0 = 0.966 for 1,6&#8208;TTM&#8208;PBI and 0.967 for 1,7&#8208;TTM&#8208;PBI). This work opens a window to develop very stable diradicals and offers them opportunity of further applications in optical, electronic and magnetic devices.</dc:description>

         <title>An Aryl&#8208;ether&#8208;linked Covalent Organic Framework Modified with Thioamide Groups for Selective Extraction of Palladium from Strong Acid Solutions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficient adsorption of palladium ions from acid nuclear waste solution is crucial for ensuring the safety of vitrification process for radioactive waste. However, the limited stability and selectivity of most current adsorbents hinder their practical applications under strong acid and intense radiation conditions. Herein, to address these limitations, we designed and synthesized an aryl&#8208;ether&#8208;linked covalent organic framework (COF&#8208;316&#8208;DM) grafted dimethylthiocarbamoyl groups on the pore walls. This unique structure endows COF&#8208;316&#8208;DM with high stability and exceptional palladium capture capacity. The robust polyarylether linkage enables COF&#8208;316&#8208;DM to withstand irradiation doses of 200 or 400 kGy of &#946;/&#947; ray. Furthermore, COF&#8208;316&#8208;DM demonstrates fast adsorption kinetics, high adsorption capacity (147 mg g&#8208;1), and excellent reusability in 4 M nitric acid. Moreover, COF&#8208;316&#8208;DM exhibits remarkable selectivity for palladium ions in the presence of 17 interference ions, simulating high level liquid waste scenario. The superior adsorption performance can be attributed to the strong binding affinity between the thioamide groups and Pd2+ ions, as confirmed by the comprehensive analysis of FT&#8208;IR and XPS spectra. Our findings highlight the potential of COFs with robust linkers and tailored functional groups for efficient and selective capture of metal ions, even in harsh environmental conditions.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Efficient adsorption of palladium ions from acid nuclear waste solution is crucial for ensuring the safety of vitrification process for radioactive waste. However, the limited stability and selectivity of most current adsorbents hinder their practical applications under strong acid and intense radiation conditions. Herein, to address these limitations, we designed and synthesized an aryl-ether-linked covalent organic framework (COF-316-DM) grafted dimethylthiocarbamoyl groups on the pore walls. This unique structure endows COF-316-DM with high stability and exceptional palladium capture capacity. The robust polyarylether linkage enables COF-316-DM to withstand irradiation doses of 200 or 400 kGy of &#946;/&#947; ray. Furthermore, COF-316-DM demonstrates fast adsorption kinetics, high adsorption capacity (147 mg g-1), and excellent reusability in 4 M nitric acid. Moreover, COF-316-DM exhibits remarkable selectivity for palladium ions in the presence of 17 interference ions, simulating high level liquid waste scenario. The superior adsorption performance can be attributed to the strong binding affinity between the thioamide groups and Pd2+ ions, as confirmed by the comprehensive analysis of FT-IR and XPS spectra. Our findings highlight the potential of COFs with robust linkers and tailored functional groups for efficient and selective capture of metal ions, even in harsh environmental conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Catalyst&#8208;free Propargylboration of Ketones with Allenyl&#8208;Bpins: Highly Stereoselective Synthesis of tert&#8208;Homopropargyl Alcohols Bearing Vicinal Stereocenters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A practical and efficient propargylboration of ketones is presented using general allenylboronic acid pinacol esters (allenyl&#8208;Bpins) without a catalyst. This reaction is triggered by in&#8208;situ activation of stable allenyl&#8208;Bpins through the sequential addition of 1.25 equiv. of nBuLi and the prerequisite 2.0 equiv. of TFAA. Under the optimized reaction conditions, the versatile trisubstituted allenyl&#8208;Bpins react with various ketones smoothly to afford a wide range of tert&#8208;homopropargyl alcohols bearing vicinal stereocenters in high yields with good to excellent diastereoselectivities. Furthermore, propargylboration of ketones with chiral trisubstituted allenyl&#8208;Bpins allows for the asymmetric synthesis of chiral tert&#8208;homopropargyl alcohols with a full chirality transfer.</dc:description>

         <title>Diphenylpyrrole&#8208;Strapped Calix[4]pyrrole Extractant for the Fluoride and Chloride Anions</title>

Extractants: The diphenylpyrrole&#8208;strapped calix[4]pyrrole and its dual host systems involving crown ethers enable the extraction of various fluoride and chloride salts from water.







Abstract
The anion binding features of diphenylpyrrole&#8208;strapped calix[4]pyrrole 1 have been investigated by means of 1H&#8197;NMR spectroscopy and ITC (isothermal titration calorimetry), as well as single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses. Receptor 1 bearing an auxiliary pyrrolic NH donor and solubilizing phenyl groups on the strap was found to bind F&#8722;, Cl&#8722;, and Br&#8722; as their tetrabutylammonium salts with high affinity in DMSO&#8208;d6. In addition, receptor 1 was found to extract the fluoride anion (as both its tetraethylammonium (TEA+) and tetrabutylammonium (TBA+) salts), as well as the chloride anion into chloroform&#8208;d from an aqueous source phase. Cation metathesis using TBAI or the use of a dual host approach involving crown ethers enabled receptor 1 to extract simple alkali metal fluoride or chloride salts from water. Quantitative binding of NaF by receptor 1 was observed in 20&#8201;% D2O&#8208;DMSO&#8208;d6 allowing for the direct determination of the NaF concentration in an unknown sample.

         <title>2D Non&#8208;van der Waals Nanoplatelets of Hematene and Magnetene: Nonlinear Optical Response and Optical Limiting Performance from UV to NIR</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The present study reports that non&#8208;van der Waals 2D materials, hematene and magnetene, show very efficient optical limiting (OL) from UV to visible, with their optical limiting onset (OLon) values exhibiting a decreasing trend towards UV irradiation wavelengths. The obtained results render these materials very promising candidates for OL&#8208;related applications, such as the protection of human retinal from high&#8208;power laser.







Abstract
Recently, the preparation of some hematene and magnetene ultrathin non van der Waals (non&#8208;vdW) 2D nanoplatelets was reported starting from hematite and magnetite natural iron ores. The present work reports on the determination and evaluation of the nonlinear optical response and the optical limiting (OL) action of these 2D nanoplatelets dispersed in water under ns laser excitation. The obtained results show that both hematene and magnetene exhibit strong nonlinear absorption and refraction, comparable and even larger than those of other van der Waals (vdW) 2D counterpart materials. In addition, due to their strong nonlinear absorption, both hematene and magnetene show exceptional OL performance from the UV to visible, attaining very low values of optical limiting onset (OLon), comparable and even lower than that of vdW 2D nanomaterials, such as graphene, graphene oxide, other transition metal dichalcogenides like MoS2, WS2 and MoSe2, black phosphorous and antimonene. Moreover, hematene was found to exhibit more efficient OL action than magnetene for all the excitation wavelengths studied, attributed to more efficient ligand to metal charge transfer. The present findings open new possibilities for the potential use of these non&#8208;vdW 2D materials in photonics and optoelectronics, e.&#8201;g., as optical limiters and optical switchers.

         <title>Dimension Tuning of All&#8208;Inorganic Ag&#8208;Based Metal Halides by Solvent Engineering</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, different dimensions of Cs2AgCl3 (1D) and CsAgCl2 (2D) metal halides have been synthesized in different solvents, DMF and DMSO, respectively. By comparing the functional group, dielectric constant, and donor number among four solvents (DMF, DMSO, DMAC, DMPU), we find the donor number plays the predominant role in the dimension tuning.







Abstract
Dimension growth of metal halides is important for its properties and applications. However, such dimension control of the metal halides is rarely reported in the literature and the growth mechanism is not clear yet. A minute difference of solvent properties can tremendously alter the process of nucleation and growth of crystals. Herein, an intriguing phenomenon of dimension tuning for Ag&#8208;based metal halides is reported. The 1D Cs2AgCl3 crystals can be obtained in pure DMF while the 2D CsAgCl2 crystals are obtained in pure DMSO. Both exhibit bright yellow emission, which are derived from self&#8208;trapping excitons (STEs). The photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of Cs2AgCl3 (1D) and CsAgCl2 (2D) are 28.46&#8201;% and 20.61&#8201;%, respectively. In order to understand the mechanism of the dimension change, additional solvents (N,N&#8208;dimethylacetamide, DMAC, 1,3&#8208;Dimethyl&#8208;Tetrahydropyrimidin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;one, DMPU) are also selected to process the precursor for crystal growth. By comparing the functional group, dielectric constant, and donor number among the four solvents, we find the donor number plays the predominant role in nucleation process for Cs2AgCl3 and CsAgCl2. This research reveals the relationship between coordination ability of the solvent and the dimension of metal halides.

This research reveals the relationship between coordination ability of the solvent and the dimension of metal halides.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chemical Synthesis of Human Milk Oligosaccharides: para&#8208;Lacto&#8208;N&#8208;hexaose and para&#8208;Lacto&#8208;N&#8208;neohexaose</title>

Chemical synthesis of two common core human milk oligosaccharides&#8212;para&#8208;lacto&#8208;N&#8208;hexaose (pLNH) and para&#8208;lacto&#8208;N&#8208;neohexaose (pLNnH)&#8212;using a convergent 3+3 approach has been reported.







Abstract
Human milk oligosaccharides (HMO) have emerged as a very active area of research in glycoscience and nutrition. HMO are involved in the early development of infants and may help to prevent certain diseases. The development of chemical methods for obtaining individual HMO aids the global effort dedicated to understanding the roles of these biomolecules. Reported herein is the chemical synthesis of two common core hexasaccharides found in human milk, i.&#8201;e. para&#8208;lacto&#8208;N&#8208;hexaose (pLNH) and para&#8208;lacto&#8208;N&#8208;neohexaose (pLNnH). After screening multiple leaving groups and temporary protecting group combinations, a 3+3 convergent coupling strategy was found to work best for obtaining these linear glycans.

         <title>Anion&#8208;Dependent Reactivity of Mono&#8208; and Dinuclear Boron Cations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
If NHC&#8208;stabilized borenium ions [NHC&#8722;BH2]+ and [PF6]&#8722; take the same bus, they will get off neutralized and with a noticeable change, i.&#8201;e., as NHC&#8722;BF3 and PH2F3. However, if tetrakis(perfluoro&#8208;tert&#8208;butoxy)aluminate is the second passenger, the anion remains untouched and a bis(boronium) or a bis(borenium) ion can enjoy the journey.







Abstract
The dinuclear bis(N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene) borane adduct 2 rapidly reacts with tritylium salts at room temperature but the outcome is strongly impacted by the respective counter&#8208;ion. Using tritylium tetrakis(perfluoro&#8208;tert&#8208;butoxy)aluminate affords &#8211; depending on the solvent &#8211; either the bis(boronium) ion 4 or the hydride&#8208;bridged dication 5. In case of tritylium hexafluorophosphate, however, H/F exchange occurs between boron and phosphorus yielding the dinuclear BF3 adduct 3 along with phosphorus dihydride trifluoride. H/F exchange also takes place when using the mononuclear N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene BH3 adduct 6 and hence provides a facile route to PH2F3, which is usually synthesized in more complex reaction sequences regularly involving toxic hydrogen fluoride. DFT calculations shed light on the H/F exchange between the borenium ion and the [PF6]&#8722; counter&#8208;ion and the computed mechanism features only small barriers in line with the experimental observations.

         <title>Controlling the Crystallisation and Hydration State of Crystalline Porous Organic Salts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High throughput screening was used to rapidly identify a new crystalline porous salt (CPOS). Using flow chemistry, the CPOS was scaled, and the material was shown to have permeant porosity with a carbon dioxide uptake of 4.3&#8197;mmol/g at 195&#8197;K, making it one of the most porous and scalable CPOS reported to date.







Abstract
Crystalline porous organic salts (CPOS) are a subclass of molecular crystals. The low solubility of CPOS and their building blocks limits the choice of crystallisation solvents to water or polar alcohols, hindering the isolation, scale&#8208;up, and scope of the porous material. In this work, high throughput screening was used to expand the solvent scope, resulting in the identification of a new porous salt, CPOS&#8208;7, formed from tetrakis(4&#8208;sulfophenyl)methane (TSPM) and tetrakis(4&#8208;aminophenyl)methane (TAPM). CPOS&#8208;7 does not form with standard solvents for CPOS, rather a hydrated phase (Hydrate2920) previously reported is isolated. Initial attempts to translate the crystallisation to batch led to challenges with loss of crystallinity and Hydrate2920 forming favorably in the presence of excess water. Using acetic acid as a dehydrating agent hindered formation of Hydrate2920 and furthermore allowed for direct conversion to CPOS&#8208;7. To allow for direct formation of CPOS&#8208;7 in high crystallinity flow chemistry was used for the first time to circumvent the issues found in batch. CPOS&#8208;7 and Hydrate2920 were shown to have promise for water and CO2 capture, with CPOS&#8208;7 having a CO2 uptake of 4.3&#8197;mmol/g at 195&#8197;K, making it one of the most porous CPOS reported to date.

         <title>Closed Synthetic Cycle for Nickel&#8208;Based Dihydrogen Formation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nickel complexes with a N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene ligand (TIMENiPr) have been synthesized and characterized. Starting from the Ni0 precursor, a NiII hydride is synthesized that reacts with protons to form a rare Ni&#8722;H2 intermediate, which was studied by NMR spectroscopy and DFT calculations. Further reduction closes the synthetic cycle.







Abstract
Dihydrogen evolution was observed in a two&#8208;step protonation reaction starting from a Ni0 precursor with a tripodal N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligand. Upon the first protonation, a NiII monohydride complex was formed, which was isolated and fully characterized. Subsequent protonation yields H2 via a transient intermediate (INT) and an isolable NiII acetonitrile complex. The latter can be reduced to regenerate its Ni0 precursor. The mechanism of H2 formation was investigated by using a deuterated acid and scrutinized by 1H NMR spectroscopy and gas chromatography. Remarkably, the second protonation forms a rare nickel dihydrogen complex, which was detected and identified in solution and characterized by 1H NMR spectroscopy. DFT&#8208;based computational analyses were employed to propose a reaction profile and a molecular structure of the Ni&#8722;H2 complex. Thus, a dihydrogen&#8208;evolving, closed&#8208;synthetic cycle is reported with a rare Ni&#8722;H2 species as a key intermediate.

         <dc:description>Direct C&#8208;H methylation is a highly valuable approach for introducing methyl groups into organic molecules, particularly in pharmaceutical chemistry. Among the various methodologies available, photo&#8208;induced methylation stands out as an exceptional choice due to its mild reaction conditions, energy efficiency, and compatibility with functional groups. This article offers a comprehensive review of photochemical strategies employed for the direct and selective methylation of C(sp3)&#8208;H, C(sp2)&#8208;H, and C(sp)&#8208;H bonds in various organic molecules. The discussed methodologies encompass transition metal&#8208;based photocatalysis, organophotocatalysis, as well as other metal&#8208;free approaches, including electron donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA)&#8208;enabled transformations. Importantly, a wide range of easily accessible agents such as tert&#8208;butyl peroxide, methanol, DMSO, acetic acid, methyl halides, and even methane can serve as effective methylating reagents for modifying diverse targets. These advancements in photochemical C&#8208;H methylation are anticipated to drive further progress in the fields of organic synthesis, photocatalysis, and pharmaceutical development, opening up exciting avenues for creating novel organic molecules and discovering new drug compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Electron paramagnetic resonance, electronic ground state, and electron spin relaxation of seven lanthanide ions bound to lanmodulin and the bioinspired chelator, 3,4,3&#8208;LI(1,2&#8208;HOPO)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra of lanthanide(III) ions besides Gd(III), bound to small&#8208;molecule and protein chelators, are uncharacterized. Here, we systematically investigated the EPR properties of 7 lanthanide(III) ions bound to the natural lanthanide&#8208;binding protein, lanmodulin (LanM), and the synthetic small&#8208;molecule chelator, 3,4,3&#8208;LI(1,2&#8208;HOPO) (&#8220;HOPO&#8221;). Echo&#8208;detected pulsed EPR spectra reveal intense signals from ions for which the normal continuous&#8208;wave first&#8208;derivative spectra are negligibly different from zero. Spectra of Kramers lanthanide ions Ce3+, Nd3+, Sm3+, Er3+, and Yb3+, and non&#8208;Kramers Tb3+ and Tm3+, bound to LanM are more similar to the ions in dilute aqueous:ethanol solution than to those coordinated with HOPO. Lanmodulins from two bacteria, with distinct metal&#8208;binding sites, had similar spectra for Tb3+ but different spectra for Nd3+. Spin&#8208;echo dephasing rates (1/Tm) are faster for lanthanides than for most transition metals and limited detection of echoes to temperatures below ~6 to 12 K. Dephasing rates were environment dependent and decreased in the order water:ethanol &gt; LanM &gt; HOPO, which is attributed to decreasing librational motion. Our results demonstrate that the EPR spectra and relaxation times of lanthanide(III) ions are sensitive to coordination environment, motivating wider application of these methods for characterization of both small&#8208;molecule and biomolecule interactions with lanthanides.</dc:description>

         <title>An Indacenopicene&#8208;based Buckybowl Catcher for Recognition of Fullerenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel buckybowl catcher with an extended &#960;&#8208;surface has been synthesized via cross&#8208;coupling of two bowl shaped bromoindacenopicene moieties with a tolyl linker. The obtained catcher has been unambiguously characterized by 2D&#8208;NMR and mass spectrometry. DFT calculations indicate that the curved shape of the receptor moieties is favourable for binding fullerenes. Effective binding was confirmed for interactions with C60 and C70 utilizing NMR spectroscopy and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). The resulting binding values show a higher affinity of the catcher towards C70 over C60. The designed catcher demonstrated the fundamental possibility of creating sensors for spherical aromaticity.</dc:description>

         <title>Weakly Self&#8208;Assembled [6]Helicenes: Circularly Polarized Light and Spin Filtering Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbo[6]helicenes decorated with 3,4,5&#8208;tris(dodecyloxy)&#8208;N&#8208;(4&#8208;ethynylphenyl)benzamide moieties at their periphery give access to weak self&#8208;assemblies with circularly polarized luminescence and spin selectivity.







Abstract
Self&#8208;assembling features, chiroptical activity, and spin filtering properties are reported for 2,15&#8208; and 4,13&#8208;disubstituted [6]helicenes decorated in their periphery with 3,4,5&#8208;tris(dodecyloxy)&#8208;N&#8208;(4&#8208;ethynylphenyl)benzamide moieties. The weak non&#8208;covalent interaction between these units conditions the corresponding circularly polarized luminescence and spin polarization. The self&#8208;assembly is overall weak for these [6]helicene derivatives that, despite the formation of H&#8208;bonding interactions between the amide groups present in the peripheral moieties, shows very similar chiroptical properties both in the monomeric or aggregated states. This effect could be explained by considering the steric effect that these groups could generate in the growing of the corresponding aggregate formed. Importantly, the self&#8208;assembling features also condition chiral induced spin selectivity (CISS effect), with experimental spin polarization (SP) values found between 35&#8211;40&#8201;% for both systems, as measured by magnetic&#8208;conducting atomic force microscopy (AFM) technique.

         <title>Amphiphilic Molecules Exhibiting Zwitterionic Excited&#8208;State Intramolecular Proton Transfer and Near&#8208;Infrared Emission for the Detection of Amyloid &#946; Aggregates in Alzheimer's Disease
</title>

         <dc:description>
A novel zwitterionic excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer molecular system exhibits high affinity towards amyloid &#946; (A&#946;) aggregates and allows for in&#8197;vivo near&#8208;infrared (NIR) imaging of amyloid plaques in transgenic Alzheimer's vs. wild&#8208;type mice.







Abstract
Chromophores with zwitterionic excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) have been shown to have larger Stock shifts and red&#8208;shifted emission wavelengths compared to the conventional &#960;&#8208;delocalized ESIPT molecules. However, there is still a dearth of design strategies to expand the current library of zwitterionic ESIPT compounds. Herein, a novel zwitterionic excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer system is reported, enabled by addition of 1,4,7&#8208;triazacyclononane (TACN) fragments on a dicyanomethylene&#8208;4H&#8208;pyran (DCM) scaffold. The solvent&#8208;dependent steady&#8208;state photophysical studies, pKa measurements, and computational analysis strongly support that the ESIPT process is more efficient with two TACN groups attached to the DCM scaffold and not affected by polar protic solvents. Impressively, compound DCM&#8208;OH&#8208;2&#8208;DT exhibits a near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emission at 740&#8197;nm along with an uncommonly large Stokes shift. Moreover, DCM&#8208;OH&#8208;2&#8208;DT shows high affinity towards soluble amyloid &#946; (A&#946;) oligomers in&#8197;vitro and in 5xFAD mouse brain sections, and we have successfully applied DCM&#8208;OH&#8208;2&#8208;DT for the in&#8197;vivo imaging of A&#946; aggregates and demonstrated its potential use as an early diagnostic agent for AD. Overall, this study can provide a general molecular design strategy for developing new zwitterionic ESIPT compounds with NIR emission in&#8197;vivo imaging applications.

         <title>Covalent Organic Frameworks in Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are an attractive class of electrode materials due to their outstanding advantages, such as structural designability, good stability, and ordered pore structure. The applications of COFs in the cathode, anode, and electrolyte of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) are summarized, and the relationship between the structure and electrochemical performance of COFs is elaborated.







Abstract
The development and utilization of green renewable energy are imperative with the aggravation of environmental pollution and energy crisis. In recent years, the exploration of electrochemical energy storage systems has gradually become a research hotspot in energy. Among them, aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) have progressively developed into highly competitive and efficient energy storage devices owing to their inherent safety, natural abundance, and higher theoretical capacity. However, the practical application of ZIBs suffers from the limitation of challenges such as the absence of proper cathode materials and the unavoidable zinc dendrites and side reactions of Zn anode. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are an attractive class of electrode materials due to their inherent advantages, like structural designability, high stability, and ordered&#8208;open channels, bestowing them with great potential to overcome the problems of ZIBs. In this review, we concentrate on the discussion of designed strategies of COFs applied to ZIBs. Furthermore, the methods of using COFs to solve the challenging problems of cathode development, anode modification, and electrolyte optimization for ZIBs are summarized. Finally, the existing difficulties, solution measures, and prospects of COFs for ZIBs applications are discussed. Our commentary hopes to serve as a valuable reference for developing COFs&#8208;based ZIBs.

         <title>Fluorescence Enhancement of Adamantane&#8208;Modified Dyes in Aqueous Solution via Supramolecular Interaction with Methyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin and Their Application in Cell Imaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy for fluorescence enhancement in aqueous solution with high inclusion equilibrium constant based on host&#8208;guest chemistry was proposed. Fluorescent dyes based on adamantane modification could be complexed with methylated &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (M&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CD). Consequently, fluorescent intensity of these dyes was significantly improved in water. And the work was further extended to fluorescent organelle targeting. Fluorescence enhancement was successfully realized in bioimaging with the addition of M&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CD.







Abstract
The fluorescence of functional dyes was generally quenched in aqueous solution, which hindered their application in water&#8208;bearing detections. In this work, a novel strategy based on host&#8208;guest interaction was provided for the purpose of fluorescence enhancement in aqueous solution and cell imaging. Three adamantane&#8208;modified fluorescent dyes (Coum&#8208;Ad, NP&#8208;Ad, NR&#8208;Ad) with coumarin, 1,8&#8208;naphthalimide and Nile Red as fluorophores were initially designed and prepared. The ((adamantan&#8208;1&#8208;yl)methyl)amino group, as the auxochrome of those dyes, complexed with methylated &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (M&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CD) via supramolecular interaction, and then fluorescent supramolecular nanoparticles (FSNPs) were formed by self&#8208;assembly in water. The inclusion equilibrium constant (K) could be as high as 3.94&#215;104&#8197;M&#8722;1. With the addition of M&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CD, fluorescence quantum yields of these dyes were separately improved to 69.8&#8201;%, 32.9&#8201;% and 41.3&#8201;%. Inspired by the above satisfactory results, six adamantane&#8208;modified probes organelle&#8208;NPAds with organelle&#8208;targeting capability were further obtained. As the formation of hydrogen bonds between organelle&#8208;NPAd2 and M&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CD verified by theoretical calculation, K of organelle&#8208;NPAd2 (5.13&#215;104&#8197;M&#8722;1~4.53&#215;105&#8197;M&#8722;1) with M&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CD was higher than that of organelle&#8208;NPAd1 (1.15&#215;104&#8197;M&#8722;1~3.66&#215;104&#8197;M&#8722;1) and their fluorescence quantum yields increased to 32.8&#8201;%~83.6&#8201;% in aqueous solution. In addition, fluorescence enhancement was realized in cell imaging with the addition of M&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CD.

         <title>Photoisomerization of &#8220;Partially Embedded Dihydropyridazine&#8221; with a Helical Structure</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoisomerization of &#8220;partially embedded fused&#8208;dihydropyridazine N&#8208;aryl aza[5]helicene derivatives&#8221; (PDH) with a helical structure inspires the demonstration of intrinsic photo&#8208;triggered multi&#8208;functional properties based on a Kekul&#233; biradical and structural flexibility. Multiple functions, such as T&#8208;type photochromism, photo&#8208;excitation&#8208;mediated triplet biradical formation, and photoracemization, which are attributed to PDH, are revealed.







Abstract
Herein, we report the synthesis of two &#8220;partially embedded fused&#8208;dihydropyridazine N&#8208;aryl aza[5]helicene derivatives&#8221; (PDHs) and the demonstration of their intrinsic photo&#8208;triggered multi&#8208;functional properties based on a Kekul&#233; biradical structure. Introducing bulky electron&#8208;withdrawing trifluoromethyl or pentafluoroethyl groups into the aza[5]helicene framework (PDH&#8208;CF3 and &#8722;C2F5) gives PDH axial chirality based on the helicity of the P and M forms, even at room temperature. Upon photo&#8208;irradiation of PDH&#8208;CF3 in a frozen solution, an ESR signal from the triplet biradical with zero&#8208;field splitting values, generated by N&#8722;N bond dissociation, was observed. However, when the irradiation was turned off, the ESR signal became silent, thus indicating the existence of two equilibria: between the biradical and quinoidal forms based on the Kekul&#233; structure, and between N&#8722;N bond cleavage and recombination. The observed photo&#8208; and thermally induced behaviors indicate that T&#8208;type photochromic molecules are involved in the photoisomerization mechanism involving the two equilibria. Inspired by the photoisomerization, chirality control of PDH by photoracemization was achieved. Multiple functionalities, such as T&#8208;type photochromism, photo&#8208;excitation&#8208;mediated triplet biradical formation, and photoracemization, which are attributed to the &#8220;partially embedded dihydropyridazine&#8221; structure, are demonstrated.

&#8226; 1st Ge atom side&#8208;on coordination to C=N, &#8226; Novel mode of aromatic C&#8722;C bond activation by NHC, &#8226; Germanium atom transfer







Abstract
The germylone dimNHCGe (dimNHC=diimino N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene) reacts with azides N3R (R=SiMe3 or p&#8208;tolyl) to furnish the first examples of germanium &#960;&#8208;complexes, i.&#8201;e. guanidine&#8208;ligated compounds (dimNHI&#8722;SiMe3)Ge (NHI=N&#8208;heterocyclic imine, R=SiMe3) and (dimNHI&#8722;Tol)Ge (R=p&#8208;tolyl). DFT calculations suggest that these species are formed by a Staudinger type replacement of dinitrogen in the azide by a nucleophilic germylone, leading to a transient carbene adduct of iminogermylidene. Heating a solution of compound (dimNHI&#8722;SiMe3)Ge to 70&#8201;&#176;C results in extrusion of the iminogermylidene that further aggregates to produce the known [Me3SiNGe]4 tetramer, whereas the imidazolylidene fragment transforms into an unusual heptatriene species that can be considered as a product of carbene insertion into the C&#8722;C bond of a pendant Ar substituent at the imidazolylidene nitrogen of the dimNHC. Reaction of (dimNHI&#8722;SiMe3)Ge with tetrachloro&#8208;o&#8208;benzoquinone results in the net transfer of a germanium atom and formation of the free diimino&#8208;guanidine ligand. This ligand also forms when (dimNHI&#8722;SiMe3)Ge is treated with azide N3(p&#8722;Tol), with the germanium product being [(p&#8722;Tol)NGe]n

         <title>Trichlates, an Unattended Class of Compounds: Characterization of Cl3CSO2Cl, and (H5O2)[Cl3CSO3]</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The so&#8208;called &#8220;trichlates&#8221; are the heavier but scarcely investigated homologues of the well&#8208;known triflates. Access to the acid (H5O2)[Cl3CSO3] is the key step for the synthesis of trichlates. The acid can be prepared by chlorination of CS2, yielding Cl3CSCl, and subsequent oxidation by H2O2 giving Cl3CSO2Cl, the chloride of the acid.







Abstract
Chlorination of CS2 leads to trichloromethanesulfenyl chloride, Cl3CSCl, in moderate yields. The oxidation of Cl3CSCl with H2O2 gives Cl3CSO2Cl, the chloride of trichloromethanesulfonic acid. Cl3CSO2Cl is the crucial product for the preparation of trichloromethanesulfonates (&#8220;trichlates&#8221;) and has been characterized by IR spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and X&#8208;ray diffraction measurements (P&#8208;1, a=609.99(5) pm, b=727.45(6) pm, c=782.49(7) pm, &#945;=80.644(3)&#176;, &#946;=85.175(3)&#176;, &#947;=88.311(3)&#176;. The acid Cl3CSO3H can be gained in form of the hydrate (H5O2)[Cl3CSO3] in two different modifications (I: monoclinic, P21/n, Z=8, a=1292.47(7) pm, b=605.89(2) pm, c=2661.1(1) pm, &#946;=98.708(4)&#176;, V=1672.8(1) &#197;3; II: monoclinic, Cc, Z=4, a=699.80(5) pm, b=1054.72(8) pm, c=1139.88(8) pm, &#946;=95.303(3)&#176;, V=837.7(1) &#197;3. Both modifications have been investigated by IR spectroscopy, thermal analyses and theoretical calculations.

         <title>Effects of the Magnetic Orientation of M13 Bacteriophage on Phage Display Selection</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In phage display selection using M13 bacteriophage, the M13 main body, which is a huge filament&gt;103&#8197;time larger than the displayed peptide, has been considered to interfere with the result of affinity selection. This interference can be attenuated by magnetically orienting the M13 main body vertical to the target surface, which results in the suppression of nonspecific adhesion and the change in the population of selected M13 clones.







Abstract
Although phage display selection using a library of M13 bacteriophage has become a powerful tool for finding peptides that bind to target materials on demand, a remaining concern of this method is the interference by the M13 main body, which is a huge filament &gt;103&#8197;times larger than the displayed peptide, and therefore would nonspecifically adhere to the target or sterically inhibit the binding of the displayed peptide. Meanwhile, filamentous phages are known to be orientable by an external magnetic field. If M13 filaments are magnetically oriented during the library selection, their angular arrangement relative to the target surface would be changed, being expected to control the interference by the M13 main body. This study reports that the magnetic orientation of M13 filaments vertical to the target surface significantly affects the selection. When the target surface was affinitive to the M13 main body, this orientation notably suppressed the nonspecific adhesion. Furthermore, when the target surface was less affinitive to the M13 main body and intrinsically free from the nonspecific adhesion, this orientation drastically changed the population of M13 clones obtained through library selection. The method of using no chemicals but only a physical stimulus is simple, clean, and expected to expand the scope of phage display selection.

         <title>Rational Design, Multistep Synthesis and in Vitro Evaluation of Poly(glycerol) Functionalized Nanodiamond Conjugated with Boron&#8208;10 Cluster and Active Targeting Moiety for Boron Neutron Capture Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

Poyl(glycerol) functionalized detonation nanodiamonds conjugated with boron&#8208;10 cluster and active targeting moiety were designed and synthesized. The nanodrugs were taken up by tumor cells and exhibited boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) efficacy upon thermal neutron irradiation.







Abstract
Boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT), advanced cancer treatment utilizing nuclear fission of 10B atom in cancer cells, is attracting increasing attention. As 10B delivery agent, sodium borocaptate (10BSH, 10B12H11SH&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2Na), has been used in clinical studies along with L&#8208;boronophenylalanine. Recently, this boron cluster has been conjugated with lipids, polymers or nanoparticles to increase selectivity to and retentivity in tumor. In this work, anticancer nanoformulations for BNCT are designed, consisting of poly(glycerol) functionalized detonation nanodiamonds (DND&#8722;PG) as a hydrophilic nanocarrier, the boron cluster moiety (10B12H112&#8722;) as a dense boron&#8208;10 source, and phenylboronic acid or RGD peptide as an active targeting moiety. Some hydroxy groups in PG were oxidized to carboxy groups (DND&#8722;PG&#8722;COOH) to conjugate the active targeting moiety. Some hydroxy groups in DND&#8722;PG&#8722;COOH were then transformed to azide to conjugate 10B12H112&#8722; through click chemistry. The nanodrugs were evaluated in&#8197;vitro using B16 murine melanoma cells in terms of cell viability, BNCT efficacy and cellular uptake. As a result, the 10B12H112&#8722; moiety is found to facilitate cellular uptake probably due to its negative charge. Upon thermal neutron irradiation, the nanodrugs with 10B12H112&#8722; moiety exhibited good anticancer efficacies with slight differences with and without targeting moiety.

         <title>A Unique Two&#8208;Dimensional Silver(II) Antiferromagnet Cu[Ag(SO4)2] and Perspectives for Its Further Modifications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
CuAg(SO4)2, a novel mixed&#8208;metal sulfate, shows a layered structure, with [Ag(SO4)2]2&#8722; sublattice (shown) hosting strong antiferromagnetic interactions. Calculations suggest that copper site could easily be changed for other small divalent cations, giving rise to a new family of two&#8208;dimensional magnetic materials.







Abstract
Copper(II) silver(II) sulfate crystallizes in a monoclinic CuSO4&#8208;related structure with P21/n symmetry. This quasi&#8208;ternary compound features Ag(SO4)22&#8722; layers, while the remaining cationic sites may be occupied either completely or partially by Cu2+ cations, corresponding to the formula of (CuxAg1&#8722;x)[Ag(SO4)2], x=0.6&#8722;1.0. CuAg(SO4)2 is antiferromagnetic with large negative Curie&#8208;Weiss temperature of &#8722;140&#8197;K and shows characteristic ordering phenomenon at 40.4&#8197;K. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the strongest superexchange interaction is a two&#8208;dimensional antiferromagnetic coupling within Ag(SO4)22&#8722; layers, with the superexchange constant J2D of &#8722;11.1&#8197;meV. This renders CuAg(SO4)2 the rare representative of layered Ag2+&#8208;based antiferromagnets. Magnetic coupling is facilitated by the strong mixing of Ag d(x2&#8722;y2) and O 2p states. Calculations show that M2+ sites in MAg(SO4)2 can be occupied with other similar cations such as Zn2+, Cd2+, Ni2+, Co2+, and Mg2+.

&lt;p&gt;Copper(II) silver(II) sulfate crystallizes in a monoclinic CuSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-related structure with &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;2&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; symmetry. This quasi-ternary compound features Ag(SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; layers, while the remaining cationic sites may be occupied either completely or partially by Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; cations, corresponding to the formula of (Cu&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;Ag&lt;sub&gt;1&#8722;&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;)[Ag(SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;], &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;=0.6&#8722;1.0. CuAg(SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is antiferromagnetic with large negative Curie-Weiss temperature of &#8722;140&#8197;K and shows characteristic ordering phenomenon at 40.4&#8197;K. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the strongest superexchange interaction is a two-dimensional antiferromagnetic coupling within Ag(SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; layers, with the superexchange constant &lt;i&gt;J&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;2D&lt;/sub&gt; of &#8722;11.1&#8197;meV. This renders CuAg(SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; the rare representative of layered Ag&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-based antiferromagnets. Magnetic coupling is facilitated by the strong mixing of Ag &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;(&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and O 2&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; states. Calculations show that M&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; sites in MAg(SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; can be occupied with other similar cations such as Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Cd&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Ni&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Co&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, and Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Nitrogen Heterocycle Synthesis through Hydride Abstraction of Acyclic Carbamates and Related Species: Scope, Mechanism, Stereoselectivity, and Product Conformation Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Acyliminium ions and related species are potent electrophiles that can be quite valuable in the synthesis of nitrogen&#8208;containing molecules. This manuscript describes a protocol to form these intermediates through hydride abstractions of easily accessible allylic carbamates, amides, and sulfonamides that avoids the reversibility that is possible in classical condensation&#8208;based routes. These intermediates are used in the preparation of a range of nitrogen&#8208;containing heterocycles, and in many cases high levels of sterocontrol are observed. Specifically areas of investigation include the impact of chemical structure on oxidation efficiency, the geometry of the intermediate iminium ions, the impact of a substrate stereocenter on stereocontrol, and an examination of transition state geometry.</dc:description>

         <title>Site Selectivity of Peptoids as Azobenzene Scaffold for Molecular Solar Thermal Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Storing solar energy is a key challenge in modern science. MOlecular Solar Thermal (MOST) systems, in particular those based on azobenzene switches, have received great interest in the last decades. The energy storage properties of azobenzene (t1/2 &lt; 4 days; DH~270 kJ/kg) must be improved for future applications. Herein, we introduce peptoids as programmable supramolecular scaffolds to improve the energy storage properties of azobenzene&#8208;based MOST systems. We demonstrate with 3&#8208;unit peptoids bearing a single azobenzene chromophore that dynamics of the MOST systems can be tuned depending on the anchoring position of the photochromic unit on the macromolecular backbone. We measured a remarkable increase of the half&#8208;life of the metastable form up to 14 days at 20 &#176;C for a specific anchoring site, significantly higher than the isolated azobenzene moiety, thus opening new perspectives for MOST development. We also highlight that liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry does not only enable to monitor the different stereoisomers during the photoisomerization process as traditionnaly done, but also allows to determine the thermal back&#8208;isomerization kinetics.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanistic Avenues in Chan&#8208;Lam based Etherification Reaction: A Computational Exploration</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ongoing advances in CuII&#8208;catalyzed aerobic oxidative coupling reactions between arylboronic esters and diverse heteroatom nucleophiles have strengthened the development of the general Chan&#8208;Lam (CL) based reaction protocol, including the C&#8722;O bond formation methodologies. In&#8208;depth mechanistic understanding of CL etherification with specific emphasize on different reaction routes and its energetics are still lacking, even though the reaction has been experimentally explored. Here, we present a DFT&#8208;guided computational study to unravel the mechanistic pathways of the CL&#8208;based etherification reaction. The computational findings provide some interesting insights on the fundamental steps of the catalytic cycle, particularly the rate&#8208;determining transmetalation event. Aryl boronic ester coordinated, methoxide bridged CuII intermediate acts as resting state, which undergoes transmetalation accompanying an activation barrier of 20.4 kcal/mol. The energy spans of the remaining fundamental steps leading to the methoxylated product are relatively low. The minor product requires an additional 14.2 kcal/mol energy span to surmount in comparison to the favored route. Hammett studies for the substituted aryl boronic esters reveal higher reaction turnover for electron&#8208;rich aryl systems. The results agree with the previously reported spectroscopic and kinetic observations. For a series of alcohol substrates, it was observed that except for cyclohexanol, moderate to high etherification turnovers are predicted.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Properties of Boron&#8208;Containing Heteromerous Bistricyclic Aromatic Enes: Structural Effects on Thermodynamic Stability and Photoreactivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Overcrowded bistricyclic aromatic enes (BAEs) have several conformations such as twisted and anti&#8208;folded conformers, and their stereochemistry and chromism have been studied in earnest. In this study, we synthesized boron&#8208;containing heteromerous BAEs having various tricyclic structures and investigated their photophysical properties. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis revealed that the introduction of a rigid fluorene unit resulted in a twisted conformer, whereas the introduction of flexible units such as thioxanthene and 9,9&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;9,10&#8208;dihydroanthracene units resulted in an anti&#8208;folded conformer. The absorption spectra of the heteromerous BAEs were dependent on the introduced tricyclic structures, suggesting the immense impact of the tricyclic structures on the electronic structures of BAEs. DFT calculations revealed the large effect of the flexibility of the tricyclic structures on the thermodynamic stability of the conformers. In addition, the boron&#8208;containing heteromerous BAEs underwent photocyclization reactions, indicating their potential application as precursors of polyaromatic hydrocarbons and helical aromatic materials.</dc:description>

Group I alkoxides and amylates efficiently catalyze the heterodehydrocoupling of challenging silane and amine substrates under mild conditions! This represents one of the most straightforward and accessible methods to form aminosilanes through heterodehydrocoupling! This train is now leaving the station &#8211; don't miss it!







Abstract
Group I alkoxides are highly active precatalysts in the heterodehydrocoupling of silanes and amines to afford aminosilane products. The broadly soluble and commercially available KOtAmyl was utilized as the benchmark precatalyst for this transformation. Challenging substrates such as anilines were found to readily couple primary, secondary, and tertiary silanes in high conversions (&gt;90&#8201;%) after only 2&#8197;h at 40&#8201;&#176;C. Traditionally challenging silanes such as Ph3SiH were also easily coupled to simple primary and secondary amines under mild conditions, with reactivity that rivals many rare earth and transition&#8208;metal catalysts for this transformation. Preliminary evidence suggests the formation of hypercoordinated intermediates, but radicals were detected under catalytic conditions, indicating a mechanism that is rare for Si&#8722;N bond formation.

         <title>Acetylene Semi&#8208;Hydrogenation at Room Temperature over Pd&#8722;Zn Nanocatalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hexadecylamine capped Pd&#8208;Zn nanoparticles were realized by a combination of solvated metal atom dispersion and co&#8208;digestive approaches. Acetylene semi&#8208;hydrogenation was achieved using Pd&#8722;Zn nanoparticles at room temperature and atmospheric pressure with high selectivity towards ethylene.







Abstract
A reaction of fundamental and commercial importance is acetylene semi&#8208;hydrogenation. Acetylene impurity in the ethylene feedstock used in the polyethylene industry poisons the Ziegler&#8208;Natta catalyst which adversely affects the polymer quality. Pd based catalysts are most often employed for converting acetylene into the main reactant, ethylene, however, it often involves a tradeoff between the conversion and the selectivity and generally requires high temperatures. In this work, bimetallic Pd&#8722;Zn nanoparticles capped by hexadecylamine (HDA) have been synthesized by co&#8208;digestive ripening of Pd and Zn nanoparticles and studied for semi&#8208;hydrogenation of acetylene. The catalyst showed a high selectivity of ~85&#8201;% towards ethylene with a high ethylene productivity to the tune of ~4341&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;min&#8722;1, at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. It also exhibited excellent stability with ethylene selectivity remaining greater than 85&#8201;% even after 70&#8197;h on stream. To the best of the authors&#8217; knowledge, this is the first report of room temperature acetylene semi&#8208;hydrogenation, with the catalyst effecting high amount of acetylene conversion to ethylene retaining excellent selectivity and stability among all the reported catalysts thus far. DFT calculations show that the disordered Pd&#8722;Zn nanocatalyst prepared by a low temperature route exhibits a change in the d&#8208;band center of Pd and Zn which in turn enhances the selectivity towards ethylene. TPD, XPS and a range of catalysis experiments provided in&#8208;depth insights into the reaction mechanism, indicating the key role of particle size, surface area, Pd&#8722;Zn interactions, and the capping agent.

         <title>Atomistic&#8208;Level Effects of Noncovalent Interactions and Crystalline Packing for Organic Material Structural Integrity upon Exposure to Gamma Radiation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
First atomistic&#8208;level study of organic single component and cocrystalline materials upon exposure to gamma radiation. EPR and periodic DFT calculations delineated how noncovalent interactions provide a crucial role in the structural stability of these materials upon exposure to radiation.







Abstract
Developing an atomistic understanding of ionizing radiation induced changes to organic materials is necessary for intentional design of greener and more sustainable materials for radiation shielding and detection. Cocrystals are promising for these purposes, but a detailed understanding of how the specific intermolecular interactions within the lattice upon exposure to radiation affect the structural stability of the organic crystalline material is unknown. This study evaluates atomistic&#8208;level effects of &#947; radiation on both single&#8208; and multicomponent organic crystalline materials and how specific noncovalent interactions and packing within the crystalline lattice enhance structural stability. Dose studies were performed on all crystalline systems and evaluated via experimental and computational methods. Changes in crystallinity were evaluated by p&#8208;XRD and free radical formation was analyzed via EPR spectroscopy. Type of intermolecular interactions and packing within the crystal lattice was delineated and related to the specific free radical species formed and the structural integrity of each material. Periodic DFT and HOMO&#8208;LUMO surface mapping calculations provided atomistic&#8208;level identifications of the most probable sites for the radicals formed upon exposure to &#947; radiation and relate intermolecular interactions and molecular packing within the crystalline lattice to experimental results.

         <title>Valence Delocalization and Metal&#8211;Metal Bonding in Carbon&#8208;Bridged Mixed&#8208;Valence Iron Complexes
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two mixed&#8208;valence diiron complexes with carbon bridges are reported. The mixed&#8208;valence [2Fe&#8722;2C] complex 4 possesses a low&#8208;spin ground state yet displays strong valence delocalization as evident by M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy. In contrast, the reduced [2Fe&#8722;C] complex 5 displays a class&#8208;III valence&#8208;delocalized ground state that is supported by magnetometry, vis&#8208;NIR and M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy, as well as DFT calculations.







Abstract
The carbide ligand in the iron&#8211;molybdenum cofactor (FeMoco) in nitrogenase bridges iron atoms in different oxidation states, yet it is difficult to discern its ability to mediate magnetic exchange interactions due to the structural complexity of the cofactor. Here, we describe two mixed&#8208;valent diiron complexes with C&#8208;based ketenylidene bridging ligands, and compare the carbon bridges with the more familiar sulfur bridges. The ground state of the [Fe2(&#956;&#8208;CCO)2]+ complex with two carbon bridges (4) is S=
, and it is valence delocalized on the M&#246;ssbauer timescale with a small thermal barrier for electron hopping that stems from the low Fe&#8722;C force constant. In contrast, one&#8208;electron reduction of the [Fe2(&#956;&#8208;CCO)] complex with one carbon bridge (2) affords a mixed&#8208;valence species with a high&#8208;spin ground state (S=
), and the Fe&#8722;Fe distance contracts by 1&#8197;&#197;. Spectroscopic, magnetic, and computational studies of the latter reveal an Fe&#8722;Fe bonding interaction that leads to complete valence delocalization. Analysis of near&#8208;IR intervalence charge transfer transitions in 5 indicates a very large double exchange constant (B) in the range of 780&#8211;965&#8197;cm&#8722;1. These results show that carbon bridges are extremely effective at stabilizing valence delocalized ground states in mixed&#8208;valent iron dimers.

         <title>Highly Scalable and Inherently Safer Preparation of Di, Tri and Tetra Nitrate Esters Using Continuous Flow Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient continuous flow O&#8208;nitration of aliphatic polyols was developed. Industrially important nitrate esters containing two, three and four nitro groups were synthesized. Examples include glycol dinitrates: 1,2&#8208;propanediol dinitrate (PGDN), ethylene glycol dinitrate (EGDN), diethylene glycol dinitrate (DEGDN), triethylene glycol dinitrate (TEGDN); trinitrates: trimethylolethane trinitrate (TMETN), 1,2,4&#8208;butanetriol trinitrate (BTTN); and tetranitrates: erythritol tetranitrate (ETN). The optimized process for each molecule provided yield &gt;90&#8201;% in a short residence time of 1&#8197;min corresponding to a space time yield of &gt;18&#8197;g/h/mL reactor volume.







Abstract
Nitrate esters are important organic compounds having wide application in energetic materials, medicines and fuel additives. They are synthesized through nitration of aliphatic polyols. But the process safety challenges associated with nitration reaction makes the production process complicated and economically unviable. Herein, we have developed a continuous flow process wherein polyol and nitric acid are reacted in a microreactor to produce nitrate ester continuously. Our developed process is inherently safer and efficient. The process was optimized for industrially important nitrate esters containing two, three and four nitro groups. Substrates include glycol dinitrates: 1,2&#8208;propylene glycol dinitrate (PGDN), ethylene glycol dinitrate (EGDN), diethylene glycol dinitrate (DEGDN), triethylene glycol dinitrate (TEGDN); trinitrates: trimethylolethane trinitrate (TMETN), 1,2,4&#8208;butanetriol trinitrate (BTTN); and tetranitrates: erythritol tetranitrate (ETN). The optimized process for each molecule provided yield &gt;90&#8201;% in a short residence time of 1&#8197;min corresponding to a space time yield of &gt;18&#8197;g/h/mL of reactor volume.

Examples include &lt;b&gt;glycol dinitrates&lt;/b&gt;: 1,2-propanediol dinitrate (PGDN), ethylene glycol dinitrate (EGDN), diethylene glycol dinitrate (DEGDN), triethylene glycol dinitrate (TEGDN); &lt;b&gt;trinitrates&lt;/b&gt;: trimethylolethane trinitrate (TMETN), 1,2,4-butanetriol trinitrate (BTTN); and &lt;b&gt;tetranitrates&lt;/b&gt;: erythritol tetranitrate (ETN). The optimized process for each molecule provided yield &amp;gt;&lt;i&gt;90&#8201;%&lt;/i&gt; in a short residence time of 1&#8197;min corresponding to a space time yield of &amp;gt;&lt;i&gt;18&#8197;g/h/mL&lt;/i&gt; reactor volume.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nitrate esters are important organic compounds having wide application in energetic materials, medicines and fuel additives. They are synthesized through nitration of aliphatic polyols. But the process safety challenges associated with nitration reaction makes the production process complicated and economically unviable. Herein, we have developed a continuous flow process wherein polyol and nitric acid are reacted in a microreactor to produce nitrate ester continuously. Our developed process is inherently safer and efficient. The process was optimized for industrially important nitrate esters containing two, three and four nitro groups. Substrates include glycol &lt;i&gt;dinitrates&lt;/i&gt;: 1,2-propylene glycol dinitrate (PGDN), ethylene glycol dinitrate (EGDN), diethylene glycol dinitrate (DEGDN), triethylene glycol dinitrate (TEGDN); &lt;i&gt;trinitrates&lt;/i&gt;: trimethylolethane trinitrate (TMETN), 1,2,4-butanetriol trinitrate (BTTN); and &lt;i&gt;tetranitrates&lt;/i&gt;: erythritol tetranitrate (ETN). The optimized process for each molecule provided yield &amp;gt;&lt;i&gt;90&#8201;%&lt;/i&gt; in a short residence time of 1&#8197;min corresponding to a space time yield of &amp;gt;&lt;i&gt;18&#8197;g/h/mL&lt;/i&gt; of reactor volume.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photoreduction of Anthracenes Catalyzed by peri&#8208;Xanthenoxanthene: a Scalable and Sustainable Birch&#8208;Type Alternative</title>

         <dc:description>
Recyclability with efficiency: Photocatalyzed &#8220;Birch&#8208;type&#8221; reduction of acenes by using peri&#8208;xanthenoxanthene (PXX). We present a novel method for reducing various full&#8208;carbon acenes using visible blue light and PXX as a photocatalyst. By attaching PXX to PDMS beads, we achieve catalyst recyclability without compromising efficiency. We also demonstrate continuous&#8208;flow reduction in a microreactor, which enhances the sustainability and scalability of this heterogenous phase strategy.







Abstract
The typical Birch reduction transforms arenes into cyclohexa&#8208;1,4&#8208;dienes by using alkali metals, an alcohol as a proton source, and an amine as solvent. Capitalizing on the strong photoreductive properties of peri&#8208;xanthenoxanthene (PXX), herein we report the photocatalyzed &#8220;Birch&#8208;type&#8221; reduction of acenes by employing visible blue light irradiation at room temperature in the presence of air. Upon excitation at 405 or 460&#8197;nm in the presence of a mixture of N,N&#8208;diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA) and trifluoromethanesulfonimide (HNTf2) in DMSO, PXX photocatalyzes the selective reduction of full&#8208;carbon acene derivatives (24&#8211;75&#8201;%). Immobilization of PXX onto polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) beads (PXX&#8208;PDMS) allowed the use of the catalyst in heterogeneous batch reactions, giving 9&#8208;phenyl&#8208;9,10&#8208;dihydroanthracene in high yield (68&#8201;%). The catalyst could easily be recovered and reused, with no notable drop in performance observed after five reaction cycles. Integration of the PXX&#8208;PDMS beads into a microreactor enabled the reduction of acenes under continuous&#8208;flow conditions, thereby validating the sustainability and scalability of this heterogeneous&#8208;phase approach.

         <title>Achieving the Reverse Intersystem Crossing in Chalcone Based Donor&#8208;Acceptor System through Down&#8208;Conversion of Triplet Exciton</title>

The graphical abstract depicts two reverse intersystem crossing (rISC) pathways through the Jablonski diagram: the traditional thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) channel on the left with yellow sunny background and a new, cold rISC pathway on the right in blue.







Abstract
In recent years, understanding the mechanism of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) has become the primary choice for designing high&#8208;efficiency, low&#8208;cost, metal&#8208;free organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs). Herein, we propose a strategically designed chalcone based donor&#8208;acceptor system, where intensification of delayed fluorescence with decrease in temperature (300&#8197;K to 100&#8197;K) is observed; the theoretical investigations of electronic states and orbital characters uncovered a new cold rISC pathway in donor&#8208;acceptor system, where rISC occurs through the down&#8208;conversation of higher triplet exciton (from T3) to lowest singlet state (S1), having negative energy splitting, thus no thermal energy is required. The comprehensive research described herein might open&#8208;up new avenues in donor&#8208;acceptor system over the conventional up&#8208;convention of triplet exciton and demonstrates that not necessarily all delayed fluorescence are thermally activated (TADF).

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Access to Boron&#8208;Doped Fused Heterocycles via Domino Cyclization of Bis&#8208;Diazidoboranes with Isonitrile</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The room temperature domino cyclization reaction of bis&#8208;diazidoboranes with isonitriles was reported for the first time. This one&#8208;step reaction leads to complex boron&#8208;doped fused heterocycles and provides a new strategy for the construction of boron&#8208;doped heterocyclic systems.







Abstract
Boron&#8208;doped fused heterocycles have shown great potential in the field of functional materials. This study reports on the synthesis of a new class of bis&#8208;diazidoboranes and the discovery of their cycloaddition reaction with isonitriles. Triply fused boron&#8208;doped heterocyclic compounds were constructed in a one&#8208;pot process through a domino cycloaddition, providing an effective route for constructing complex boron&#8208;doped heterocyclic systems.

         <title>Generation and Application of Homoallylic &#945;,&#945;&#8208;Diboryl Radicals via Diboron&#8208;Promoted Ring&#8208;Opening of Vinyl Cyclopropanes: cis&#8208;Diastereoselective Borylative Cycloaddition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbon&#8208;centered radicals stabilized by adjacent boron atoms are underexplored reaction intermediates in organic synthesis. We report the development of vinyl cyclopropyl diborons (VCPDBs) as a versatile source of previously unknown homoallylic &#945;,&#945;&#8208;diboryl radicals via thiyl radical catalyzed diboron&#8208;directed ring opening. These diboryl stabilized radicals underwent smooth [3+2] cycloaddition with a variety of olefins to provide diboryl cyclopentanes in good to excellent diastereoselectivity. In contrast to the trans&#8208;diastereoselectivity observed with most of the dicarbonyl activated VCPs, the cycloaddition of VCPDBs showed a remarkable preference for formation of cis&#8208;cyclopentane diastereomer which was confirmed by quantitative NOE and 2D NOESY studies. The cis&#8208;stereochemistry of cyclopentane products enabled a concise intramolecular Heck reaction approach to rare tricyclic cyclopentanoid framework containing the diboron group. The mild reaction conditions also allowed a one&#8208;pot VCP ring&#8208;opening, cycloaddition&#8208;oxidation sequence to afford disubstituted cyclopentanones. Control experiments and DFT analysis of reaction mechanism support a radical mediated pathway and provide a rationale for the observed diastereoselectivity. To our knowledge, these are the first examples of the use of geminal diboryl group as an activator of VCP ring opening and cycloaddition reaction of &#945;&#8208;boryl radicals.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed coupling reactions that involve the direct functionalization of insert C&#8208;H bond represent one of the most efficient strategies for forming carbon&#8208;carbon bonds.

         <title>Functionalization of Dodecaborates by Mild and Efficient Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Formation of B&#8208;C Bonds with Boronic Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hybrid organic&#8208;inorganic molecules have recently received great interest due to their unique properties, which give access to their implementation in biological and material sciences. Herein, a new synthetic approach for the direct&#8208;linkage of the purely inorganic dodecaborate cluster to organic building blocks through B&#8208;C bond is established, using boronic acids as functional groups on the organic moiety, reacting under Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling conditions with iodo&#8208;undecahydridododecaborate. The choices of ligand (DavePhos) and solvent (N&#8208;methylpyrrolidone for electron&#8208;poor, CD3CN for electron&#8208;rich groups) are essential for the successful coupling. Ultimately, the newly described methodology is found to be functional&#8208;group tolerant covering a wide spectrum of substrates including electron&#8208;poor arenes.</dc:description>

         <title>HER&#8208;2&#8208;targeted Boron Neutron Capture Therapy with Carborane&#8208;integrated Immunoliposomes Prepared via an Exchanging Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) is a promising modality for cancer treatment because of its minimal invasiveness. To maximize the therapeutic benefits of BNCT, the development of efficient platforms for the delivery of boron agents is indispensable. Here, we prepared carborane&#8208;integrated immunoliposomes via an exchanging reaction to achieve HER&#8208;2&#8208;targeted BNCT. The conjugation of an anti&#8208;HER&#8208;2 antibody to carborane&#8208;integrated liposomes successfully endowed these liposome with targeting properties toward HER&#8208;2&#8208;overexpressing human ovarian cancer cells (SK&#8208;OV3); the resulting BNCT activity toward SK&#8208;OV3 cells obtained using the current immunoliposomal system was 14&#8208;fold that of the l&#8208;BPA/fructose complex, which is a clinically available boron agent. Moreover, the growth of spheroids treated with our system followed by thermal neutron irradiation was significantly suppressed compared with treatment with the l&#8208;BPA/fructose complex.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual strategies with anion/cation co&#8208;doping and lithium carbonate coating to enhance the electrochemical performance of Li&#8208;rich layered oxides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium&#8208;rich layered oxides (LLOs, Li1.2Mn0.54Ni0.13Co0.13O2) are widely used as cathode materials for lithium&#8208;ion batteries due to its high specific capacity, high operating voltage and low cost. However, the LLOs are faced with rapid decay of charge/discharge capacity and voltage, as well as interface side reactions, which limit its electrochemical performance. Herein, the dual strategies of sulfite/sodium ion co&#8208;doping and lithium carbonate coating were used to improve it. It founds that modified LLOs achieve 88.74% initial coulomb efficiency, 295.3 mAh g&#8211;1 first turn discharge capacity, in addition to 216.9 mAh g&#8211;1 at 1 C, and 87.23% capacity retention after 100 cycles. Mechanism research indicated that the excellent electrochemical performance benefits from the doping of both Na+ and SO32&#8208;, and it could significantly reduce the migration energy barrier of Li+ and promote Li+ migration. Meanwhile, anion and cation are co&#8208;doped greatly reduces the band gap of LLOs and increase its electrical conductivity, and no electron spin barrier leap effect at the Fermi level. In addition, the lithium carbonate coating significantly inhibits the occurrence of interfacial side reactions of LLOs. This work provides a theoretical basis and practical guidance for the further development of LLOs with higher electrochemical performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Development of Lysine Crotonyl&#8208;Mimic Probe to Covalently Identify H3K27Cr Interacting Proteins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The enhancement of cysteine reactivity of crotonylated lysine (Kcr) in thiol&#8208;Michael addition by replacing the amide bond with an ester bond is reported. The H3g27Cr probe identified the known H3K27Cr&#8208;binding protein HDAC1, as well as the unknown protein STAT3, as potential binders of H3K27Cr in a possibly complex manner. A specific crotonyl group aimed at identifying newer Kcr&#8208;binding interactomes is reported.







Abstract
Histone lysine crotonylation (Kcr) is one newly discovered acylation modification and regulates numerous pathophysiological processes. The binding affinity between Kcr and its interacting proteins is generally weak, which makes it difficult to effectively identify Kcr&#8208;interacting partners. Changing the amide of crotonyl to an ester increased reactivity with proximal cysteines and retained specificity for Kcr antibody. The probe &#8220;H3g27Cr&#8221; was designed by incorporating the ester functionality into a H3K27 peptide. Using this probe, multiple Kcr&#8208;interacting partners including STAT3 were successfully identified, and this has not been reported previously. Further experiments suggested that STAT3 possibly could form complexes with Histone deacetylase HDACs to downregulate the acetylation and crotonylation of Histone H3K27. Our unique design provided intriguing tools to further explore Kcr&#8208;interacting proteins and elucidate their working mechanisms.

         <title>Highly Enantioselective Synthesis of Pharmaceuticals at Chiral&#8208;Encoded Metal Surfaces</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanostructured mesoporous Pt&#8208;Ir alloys are used as heterogeneous catalysts for the asymmetric synthesis of pharmaceutical compounds, illustrated by the enantioselective hydrogenation adrenalone, leading to the desired epinephrine stereoisomer as a model compound with up to 95&#8201;% ee.







Abstract
Enantioselective catalysis is of crucial importance in modern chemistry and pharmaceutical science. Although various concepts have been used for the development of enantioselective catalysts to obtain highly pure chiral compounds, most of them are based on homogeneous catalytic systems. Recently, we successfully developed nanostructured metal layers imprinted with chiral information, which were applied as electrocatalysts for the enantioselective synthesis of chiral model compounds. However, so far such materials have not been employed as heterogeneous catalysts for the enantioselective synthesis of real pharmaceutical products. In this contribution, we report the asymmetric synthesis of chiral pharmaceuticals (CPs) with chiral imprinted Pt&#8722;Ir surfaces as a simple hydrogenation catalyst. By fine&#8208;tuning the experimental parameters, a very high enantioselectivity (up to 95&#8201;% enantiomeric excess) with good catalyst stability can be achieved. The designed materials were also successfully used as catalytically active stationary phases for the continuous asymmetric flow synthesis of pharmaceutical compounds. This illustrates the possibility of producing real chiral pharmaceuticals at such nanostructured metal surfaces for the first time.

         <title>Behavior of a Dynamic Covalent Library Driven by Combined Pd(II) and Biphasic Effectors for Metal Transport between Phases</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pd(II) acts as a chemical effector on an acylhydrazone&#8208;based dynamic covalent library (DCL) in a biphasic system. The introduction of Pd(II) leads to a significant increase in the constituent that is best suited for a transfer of Pd(II) into the organic phase. This study introduces a novel approach for liquid/liquid extraction and metal recovery by utilizing extractant species generated in&#8197;situ by the DCL.







Abstract
This work reports the effect of Pd(II) as chemical effector on an acylhydrazone&#8208;based dynamic covalent library (DCL) in biphasic systems (water/chloroform). The constituents of the DCL are self&#8208;built and distributed in the two phases, two of them are lipophilic enough to play the role of a carrier agent that may transfer Pd(II) from the aqueous phase to the organic phase. Upon addition of Pd(II), the DCL of components exhibits a strong amplification of the constituent that is the most adapted to stabilize Pd(II) in chloroform as well as its agonist in water. This evolution is driven by the combination of the interaction of the DCL with Pd(II) and the presence of the two phases. This study paves the way to a novel approach for liquid/liquid extraction and metal recovery by means of adaptive extractant species generated in&#8197;situ by a DCL.

         <title>Photoisomerisation of Exo&#8208;Imine Complexes and the Role of MECP in the Reverse Thermal Equilibrium: An Experimental and DFT Computational Investigation
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exo&#8208;imine complexes have been synthesised and shown to behave as molecular switches. Irradiation with visible light converts the more stable to the less stable form (usually trans to cis). The reverse process is thermally activated. DFT calculations show the important role of a minimum energy crossing point (MECP) in the thermal isomerisation.







Abstract
Complexes [MCl2Cp*]2 (M=Ir, Rh), [RuCl2(p&#8208;cymene)]2 and [Ir(C^N)2Cl]2 (HC^N=a, phenylpyridine ; b, phenylpyrazole,) react with imine ligands derived from &#959;&#8208;aminophenol to yield complexes with an exocyclic C=N bond which has a cis or trans configuration. The trans isomer is favoured except for sterically crowded complexes Cp*M (M=Ir, Rh) when the imine has a mesityl substituent, for which the cis isomer is favoured. The complexes undergo photoisomerisation in visible light but revert back to the original isomer over time or when heated. The rate of the thermal reverse isomerisation depends on the imine substituent and the metal fragment. DFT calculations correctly reproduce the favoured isomer and suggest that the reverse isomerisation occurs by a rehybridisation at the N atom as found in organic imines. In addition, a triplet state, thermally accessible by a Minimum Energy Crossing Point (MECP) provides a low energy pathway for reverse isomerisation in the case of the half&#8208;sandwich complexes.

         <title>Hydrogenation of CO2 by a Bifunctional PC(sp3)P Iridium(III) Pincer Complex Equipped with Tertiary Amine as a Functional Group</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogenation of CO2 under molecular hydrogen by a fully characterized Ir(III) pincer complex is described. The unique biomimetic second coordination sphere functionality is investigated both empirically and computationally shows the hydrogen activation step to proceed in room temperature.







Abstract
Reversible hydrogen storage in the form of stable and mostly harmless chemical substances such as formic acid (FA) is a cornerstone of a fossil fuels&#8208;free economy. In the past, we have reported a primary amine&#8208;functionalized bifunctional iridium(III)&#8208;PC(sp3)P pincer complex as a mild and chemoselective catalyst for the additive&#8208;free decomposition of neat formic acid. In this manuscript, we report on the successful application of a redesigned complex bearing tertiary amine functionality as a catalyst for mild hydrogenation of CO2 to formic acid. The catalyst demonstrates TON up to 6&#215;104 and TOF up to 1.7&#215;104&#8197;h&#8722;1. In addition to the practical value of the catalyst, experimental and computational mechanistic studies provide the rationale for the design of improved next&#8208;generation catalysts.

         <title>Enhancing the Cycle Performance of Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries by Coating the Separator with a Cation&#8208;Selective Polymer Layer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A delicately designed cation&#8208;selective polymer is synthesized and then coated on one side of the polypropylene separator in a lithium&#8208;sulfur battery, which can effectively obstruct the shuttling of negatively charged soluble polysulfides by the electrostatic repulsion of fixed anions on the backbone of the polymer with no influence on the passage of lithium&#8208;ion, thus remarkably elevating the battery's cycle performance.







Abstract
Lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries are believed to possess the feasibility to power electric vehicles in the future ascribed to the competitive energy density. However, soluble polysulfides continuously shuttle between the sulfur electrode and lithium anode across the separator, which dramatically impairs the battery's capacity. Herein, the surface of a polypropylene separator (PP film) is successfully modified with a delicately designed cation&#8208;selective polymer layer to suppress the transport of polysulfides. In principle, since bis&#8208;sulfonimide anions groups on the backbone of the polymer are immobilized, only cations can pass through the polymer layer. Furthermore, plenty of ethoxy chains in the polymer can facilitate lithium&#8208;ion mobility. Consequently, in addition to obstructing the movement of negatively charged polysulfides by the electrostatic repulsive force of fixed anions, the coated multi&#8208;functional layer on the PP film also guarantees the smooth conduction of lithium ions. The investigations demonstrate that the battery with the pristine PP film only delivers 228.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 300&#8197;cycles at 2&#8197;C with a high capacity fading rate of 60.9&#8201;%. By contrast, the polymer&#8208;coated sample can release 409.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 under the identical test condition and the capacity fading rate sharply declines to 43.2&#8201;%, illustrating superior cycle performance.

         <title>NHC&#8208;Stabilized Dialanes(4) of Al2Mes4</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis and characterization of novel N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) stabilized dialanes Al2Mes4 as well as first investigations concerning the reactivity of these compounds are reported. The synthesis of these compounds proceeds via the Mesityl&#8208;substituted alanes (NHC)&#183;AlHMes2 (NHC = IMeMe3, IiPrMe4) and iodo&#8208;alanes (NHC)&#183;AlIMes2 (NHC = IMeMe5, IiPrMe6). Metallic reduction of 5 and 6 afforded the new NHC&#8208;stabilized dialanes (NHC)2&#183;Al2Mes4 (NHC = IMeMe7, IiPrMe8). The NHC&#8208;ligated dialanes are thermally robust and storable synthons for the dialane Al2Mes4. First reactivity studies on (IMeMe)2&#183;Al2Mes47 towards small molecules confirm this, as 7 shows controlled and selective reactions with several substrates. Reaction with CuCl leads to oxidation of the dialane and formation of (IMeMe)&#183;AlClMes210, reactions with pyridine N&#8208;oxide and tBu&#8208;N=C=S, respectively, gave the chalcogenide&#8208;bridged dimers ((IMeMe)&#183;AlMes2)2&#8208;&#956;&#8208;E (E= O 11, S 12), and reaction with acetylene afforded the dimetallaacetylide ((IMeMe)&#183;AlMes2)2&#8208;&#956;&#8208;(C&#8801;C) 13.</dc:description>

         <title>Capture&#8208;SELEX of DNA Aptamers for Sulforhodamine B and Fluorescein</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While many dye binding aptamers have been reported, most of them were for light&#8208;up aptamers that can significantly enhance the quantum yield of fluorophores. Sulforhodamine B (SRhB) was used as a target previously to select both DNA and RNA aptamers, and the DNA aptamer was a G&#8208;quadruplex that can bind to a number of rhodamine analogs. In addition, the previous selections were performed by immobilizing the target molecules. In this work, we used the library immobilization method to respectively select aptamers for SRhB and fluorescein. The SRhB aptamer has a non&#8208;G&#8208;quadruplex structure with a Kd of 1.0 &#181;M measured from isothermal titration calorimetry. Upon titration of the aptamer, the fluorescence of SRhB increased 2.5&#8208;fold, and this aptamer does not require Mg2+ for binding. Rhodamine B has even tighter binding suggesting binding through the xanthene moiety of the dyes. No binding was detected for fluorescein. For the fluorescein selection, a dominant aptamer sequence with a Kd of 147 &#181;M was obtained. This study provides two new aptamers for two important fluorophores that can be used to study aptamer&#8208;based separation, dye detection and catalysis. Comparison of these aptamers also provide insights into the effect of functional groups on aptamer binding.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The anion recognition and electrochemical anion sensing properties of halogen bonding (XB) tripodal zinc (II)&#8208;receptors strategically designed and constructed for tetrahedral anion guest binding are described. The XB tris(iodotriazole)&#8208;containing hosts exhibit high affinities and selectivities for inorganic phosphate over other more basic, mono&#8208;charged oxoanions such as acetate and the halides in a competitive CH3CN/ D2O 9:1 v/v aqueous solvent mixture. 1H NMR anion binding and electrochemical voltammetric anion sensing studies with redox&#8208;active ferrocene functionalised metallo&#8208;tripodal receptor analogues, reveal each of the XB tripods as superior anion complexants when compared to their tris(prototriazole)&#8208;containing, hydrogen bonding (HB) counterparts, not only exemplifying the halogen bond as a strong alternative interaction to the traditional hydrogen bond for molecular recognition but also providing rare evidence of the ability of XB receptors to preferentially bind the &#8216;harder&#8217; phosphate oxoanion over the &#8216;softer&#8217; and less hydrated halides in aqueous containing media.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective and Stepwise Functionalization of the Pyridazine Scaffold by Using Thio&#8208;Substituted Pyridazine Building Blocks</title>

We described a regioselective tri&#8208; and tetra&#8208;functionalization of the pyridazine scaffold using two readily available building blocks: 3&#8208;(butylthio)&#8208;6&#8208;chloropyridazine and 3,4&#8208;bis(methylthio)&#8208;6&#8208;chloropyridazine by performing selective metalations with TMPMgCl&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;LiCl and catalyst&#8208;tuned cross&#8208;coupling reactions with arylzinc halides. Several of the resulting pyridazines were converted into more elaborated N&#8208;heterocycles such as thieno[2,3&#8208;c]pyridazines and 1H&#8208;pyrazolo[3,4&#8208;c]pyridazines.

         <dc:description>
Geometry of the first excited S1 state has been obtained for the bimetallic end&#8208;on &#956;2&#8208;&#951;1:&#951;1&#8208;N2 bridging dinitrogen complexes that possess characteristic N&#8722;N &#960;* based LUMO (&#960;*&#8208;&#960;*&#8208;&#960;*) centered on their M&#8722;N&#8722;N&#8722;M core. The elongated N&#8722;N bond in the S1 state and thermodynamically feasible N&#8722;N protonation free energies hold great promise for N2 &#960;&#8208;photoactivation and protonation.







Abstract
Bimetallic end&#8208;on &#956;2&#8208;&#951;1:&#951;1&#8208;N2 bridging dinitrogen complexes have served as the platform for photochemical N2 activation, mainly for the N&#8722;N cleavage. However, the alternate N&#8722;N &#960;&#8208;photoactivation route has remained largely unexplored. This study strengthens the notion of weakening the N&#8722;N bond through the population of &#960;* orbital upon electronic excitation from the ground to the first excited state using four prototypical complexes based on Fe (1), Mo (2), and Ru (3,4). The complexes 1&#8211;4 possess characteristic N&#8722;N &#960;* based LUMO (&#960;*&#8208;&#960;*&#8208;&#960;*) centered on their M&#8722;N&#8722;N&#8722;M core, which was earlier postulated to play a central role in the N2 photoactivation. Vertical electronic excitation of the highest oscillator strength involves transitions to the N&#8722;N &#960;*&#8208;based acceptor orbital (&#960;*&#8208;&#960;*&#8208;&#960;*) in complexes 1&#8211;4. This induces geometry relaxation of the first excited metal&#8208;to&#8208;nitrogen (&#960;*) charge transfer (1MNCT) state leading to a &#8220;zigzag&#8221; M&#8722;N&#8722;N&#8722;M core in the equilibrium structure. Obtaining the equilibrium geometry in the first excited state with the full&#8208;sized complexes widens the scope of N&#8722;N &#960;&#8208;photoactivation with &#956;2&#8208;&#951;1:&#951;1&#8208;N2 bridging dinitrogen complexes. Promisingly, the elongated N&#8722;N bond and bent &#8736;MNN angle in the photoexcited S1 state of 1&#8211;4 resemble their radical&#8208; and di&#8208;anion forms, which lead toward thermodynamically feasible N&#8722;N protonation in the S1 excited state.

This induces geometry relaxation of the first excited metal-to-nitrogen (&#960;*) charge transfer (&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;MNCT) state leading to a &#8220;zigzag&#8221; M&#8722;N&#8722;N&#8722;M core in the equilibrium structure. Obtaining the equilibrium geometry in the first excited state with the full-sized complexes widens the scope of N&#8722;N &#960;-photoactivation with &#956;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-&#951;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;:&#951;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;-N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; bridging dinitrogen complexes. Promisingly, the elongated N&#8722;N bond and bent &#8736;MNN angle in the photoexcited S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; state of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt; resemble their radical- and di-anion forms, which lead toward thermodynamically feasible N&#8722;N protonation in the S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; excited state.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis and VCD Spectroscopic Characterization of a Series of Azacryptands from a Chiral Valine&#8208;Based Derivative of Tris(2&#8208;aminoethyl)amine (TREN)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We introduce three C3&#8208;symmetric azacryptands with chiral valine&#8208;based TREN headgroups. Their VCD spectroscopic characterization reveals that the computed lowest energy conformers of all three azacryptands are not favored in solution phase and that they prefer a collapsed conformation.







Abstract
Utilizing experimental and computational vibrational circular dichroism (VCD) spectroscopy, we explored the conformational preferences of a series of chiral C3&#8208;symmetric octaazacryptands with tris(2&#8208;aminoethyl)&#8208;amine head groups derived from valine. While the spectra of the smallest azacryptand with p&#8208;phenyl linkers and its elongated derivative with p&#8208;biphenyls linker were found to match well with the computed spectra, the computed conformational preferences of the m&#8208;biphenyl&#8208;based azacryptand did not seem to reflect the conformations dominating in chloroform solution. A detailed analysis revealed that structural changes resulting in a collapsed cage structure gave a notably better match with the experiment. It could subsequently be concluded from the VCD analysis, that the octaazacryptands prefer a collapsed structure, which is not predicted by density functional theory (DFT) calculations as the global minimum structures. These findings are expected to have consequences also for future studies on inclusion complexes of such azacryptands.

         <title>Pinacol Cross&#8208;Coupling Promoted by an Aluminyl Anion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A simple sequential addition protocol for the reductive coupling of ketones and aldehydes by a potassium aluminyl grants access to unsymmetrical pinacolate derivatives. Isolation of an aluminium ketyl complex presents evidence for the accessibility of radical species. Product release from the aluminium centre was achieved using an iodosilane, forming the disilylated 1,2&#8208;diol and a neutral aluminium iodide, thereby demonstrating the steps required to generate a closed synthetic cycle for pinacol (cross) coupling at an aluminyl anion.</dc:description>

analysis shows a near planar 1,4&#8208;di(9H&#8208;fluoren&#8208;9ylidene)tetraazadiide ligand that chelates to the aluminium. The thermally induced elimination of dinitrogen from 1 affords the neutral aluminium ketimide complex, Al(NON)(N=flu)(THF) (2) and the 1,2di(9H&#8208;fluoren&#8208;9&#8208;yl)diazene dianion as the potassium salt, [K2(THF)3][fluN=Nflu] (3). The reaction of 2 with N,N'diisopropylcarbodiimide (iPrN=C=NiPr) affords the aluminium guanidinate complex, Al(NON){N(iPr)C(N=CMe2)N(CHflu)} (4), showing a rare example of reactivity at a metal ketimide ligand. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations have been used to examine the bonding in the newly formed [(fluN2)2]2&#8211; ligand in 1 and the ketimide bonding in 2. The mechanism leading to the formation of 4 has also been studied using this technique.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The functionalisation of carbon nanotubes has been instrumental in broadening its application field, allowing especially its use in biological studies. Although numerous covalent and non&#8208;covalent functionalisation methods have been described, the characterisation of the final materials has always been an added challenge. Among the various techniques available, Raman spectroscopy is one of the most widely used to determine the covalent functionalisation of these species. However, Raman spectroscopy is not a quantitative technique, and no studies are reported comparing its performance when the same number of functional groups are added but using completely different reactions. In this work, we have experimentally and theoretically studied the functionalisation of carbon nanotubes using two of the most commonly used reactions: 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition of azomethylene ylides and diazonium&#8208;based radical addition. The number of groups introduced onto the tubes by these reactions has been determined by different characterisation techniques. The results of this study support the idea that data obtained by Raman spectra are only helpful for comparing functionalisations produced using the same type of reaction. However, they should be carefully analysed when comparing functionalisations produced using different reaction types.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning the optical properties through hydrogen bond&#8208;assisted H&#8208;aggregate formation: The ODIN case</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The current work focuses on the investigation of two functionalized naphthyridine derivatives, namely ODIN&#8208;EtPh and ODIN&#8208;But, to gain insights into the hydrogen bond&#8208;assisted H&#8208;aggregate formation and its impact on the optical properties of ODIN molecules. By employing a combination of X&#8208;ray and electron crystallography, Absorption and Emission spectroscopy, time resolved fluorescence and ultrafast pump&#8208;probe spectroscopy (visible and infrared) we unravel the correlation between the structure and light&#8208;matter response, with a particular emphasis on the influence of the polarity of the surrounding environment. Our experimental results and simulations confirm that in polar and good hydrogen&#8208;bond acceptor solvents (DMSO), the formation of dimers for ODIN derivatives is strongly inhibited. The presence of a phenyl group linked to the ureidic unit favors the folding of ODIN derivatives (forming an intramolecular hydrogen bond) leading to the stabilization of a charge&#8208;transfer excited state which almost completely quenches its fluorescence emission. In solvents with a poor aptitude for forming hydrogen bonds, the formation of dimers is favored which give rise to H aggregates, with a consequent considerable reduction in the fluorescence emission. The urea&#8208;bound phenyl group furtherly stabilize the dimers in chloroform.</dc:description>

         <title>Antibactericidal Ir(III) and Ru(II) Complexes with Phosphine&#8208;Alkaloid Conjugate and Their Interactions with Biomolecules: A Case of N&#8208;Methylphenethylamine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The phosphine derived from natural alkaloid N&#8208;methylphenethylamine was used to synthesize half&#8208;sandwich iridium(III) and ruthenium(II) complexes. It turned out that they are selective towards Gram&#8208;positive bacteria, whereas the Ir(III) complex was more bactericidal. The potential action mode was proposed, based on the interactions with various biomolecules (ctDNA, plasmid DNA, 9&#8208;ethylguanine, and 9&#8208;methyladenine, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, glutathione, and ascorbic acid).







Abstract
The phosphine ligand (Ph2PCH2N(CH3)(CH2)2Ph, PNMPEA) obtained by the reaction of the (hydroxymethyl)diphenylphosphine with naturally occurring alkaloid N&#8208;methylphenethylamine, was used to synthesize the half&#8208;sandwich iridium(III) (Ir(&#951;5&#8208;Cp*)Cl2Ph2PCH2N(CH3)(CH2)2Ph, IrPNMPEA) and ruthenium(II) (Ru(&#951;6&#8208;p&#8208;cymene)Cl2Ph2PCH2N(CH3)(CH2)2Ph, RuPNMPEA) complexes. They were characterized using a vast array of methods, including 1D and 2D NMR, ESI(+)MS spectrometry, elemental analysis, cyclic voltammetry (CV), electron spectroscopy in the UV&#8208;Vis range (absorption, fluorescence) and density functional theory (DFT). The initial antimicrobial activity in&#8197;vitro toward Gram&#8208;positive and Gram&#8208;negative bacterial strains was examined, indicating that both complexes are selective towards Gram&#8208;positive bacteria, e.&#8201;g., Staphylococcus aureus, where the IrPNMPEA has been more bactericidal compared to RuPNMPEA. Additionally, the interactions of these compounds with various biomolecules, such as DNA (ctDNA, plasmid DNA, 9&#8208;ethylguanine (9&#8208;EtG), and 9&#8208;methyladenine (9&#8208;MeA)), nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH), glutathione (GSH), and ascorbic acid (Asc) were described. The results showed that both Ir(III) and Ru(II) complexes accelerate the oxidation process of NADH, GSH and Asc that appeared to occur by an electron transfer mechanism. Interestingly, only IrPNMPEA leads to the formation of various biomolecule adducts, which can explain its higher activity. Furthermore, RuPNMPEA and IrPNMPEA have been interacting with the DNA through weak noncovalent interactions.

         <title>Amino&#8208;Acid&#8208;Assisted Synthesis of Hollow Hierarchical FER Zeolite with Improved Catalytic Performance</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hollow hierarchical FER zeolite is synthesized through an amino&#8208;acid&#8208;assisted approach without the use of mesoporogens, and exhibits improved catalytic performance in the skeletal isomerization of 1&#8208;butene to isobutene.







Abstract
Hierarchical zeolites are highly&#8208;desired catalysts in the petrochemical industry due to their shorter diffusion length, faster diffusion rate, and better accessibility to active acid sites compared with conventional zeolites. Herein, we report a simple amino&#8208;acid&#8208;assisted method to synthesize urchin&#8208;like hollow hierarchical FER zeolites with abundant mesopores and macroporous inner cavities. An amino acid (i.&#8201;e. L&#8208;lysine) is used to facilitate the agglomeration of primary gel nanoparticles. The preferential nucleation and crystal growth at the external surfaces together with the lagged crystallization of the inner core of the agglomerates results in the formation of hollow inner cavities after the exhaustion of interior materials. Thanks to the unique hierarchical structure and more accessible acid sites, the hollow hierarchical FER zeolite exhibits improved catalytic performance over the conventional one in the skeletal isomerization of 1&#8208;butene to isobutene.

         <title>Chiral Dual Core Chromophores Based on Binaphthyl Acrylonitrile Motif with Tunable Dual Emission Bands and Anti&#8208;counterfeiting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The prepared chiral dual core chromophores based on binaphthyl acrylonitrile were shown to have the excellent dual state emissions and tunable dual wavelength emissions. A range of colors could be observed by solvatochromic and mechanochromic effects, and the anti&#8208;counterfeiting application with small color migration was also achieved.







Abstract
Small organic molecules which can emit fluorescence with tunable dual emission bands are significant for fundamental research and broad applications. In this work, two binaphthyl based arylacrylonitrile derivatives with pyrene and triphenylamine unit (BiNp&#8208;Py and BiNp&#8208;TPA) were designed and synthesized, respectively, featuring chiral backbone and dual AIE&#8208;active cyanostyrene&#8208;linked chromophores. Excellent fluorescence emissions in a range of solution and solid states were observed with high quantum yields, indicative of the solvatochromism and mechanochromism. More interestingly, dual emission bands were found and tunable by the water fraction in THF, and speculatively attributed to the balancing of intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) and locally excited (LE) emission in solution and aggregate states. Furthermore, the potential application in anti&#8208;counterfeiting ink was also explored, indicating the very low concentration (5&#8197;ppm) for sufficient distinguishable vision and small colour migration (28&#8197;nm) for printing on the filter. The present work provides a new strategy to design organic luminescent structure having widely fluorescent emissions in dual states and a valuable reference for the study of chiral optical materials.

         <title>Switchable Selectivity in the Annulation of o&#8208;Trifluoroacetylanilines and Activated Terminal Alkynes Based on Transition Metal and Phosphine Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on Cu ang Ag catalysis as well as phosphine catalysis, we have developed efficient methods for the synthesis of three different types of CF3&#8208;substituted compounds (quinoline&#8208;3&#8208;carboxylates, quinoline&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylates, and indolines) from the same starting materials such as o&#8208;trifluoroacetylanilines and propiolates.







Abstract
In this work, we have developed selective methods for the synthesis of quinoline&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylates and quinoline&#8208;3&#8208;carboxylates as well as (indolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene)acetates through copper&#8208;, silver&#8208;, or phosphine&#8208;catalyzed reaction of propiolates with 2&#8242;&#8208;amino&#8208;2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroacetophenones. The approaches proposed ensure synthesis of substituted quinoline carboxylates and (indolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene)acetates in good yields. Introduction of alkynones into the reaction with 2&#8242;&#8208;amino&#8208;2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroacetophenones gives acyl substituted derivatives in good yields.

         <title>Post&#8208;Synthetic Nucleobase Modification of Oligodeoxynucleotides by Sonogashira Coupling and Influence of Alkynyl Modifications on the Duplex&#8208;Forming Ability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A post&#8208;synthetic nucleobase modification method for oligonucleotides via Sonogashira coupling is developed. This method enables efficient synthesis of various types of alkynyl&#8208;modified oligonucleotides and evaluation of the stability of the duplex formed by the synthesized alkynyl&#8208;modified oligonucleotides. Interestingly, alkynyl&#8208;modification on pyrimidine is less tolerated than on purine in duplex stability.







Abstract
Recently, it was reported that the alkynyl modification of nucleobases mitigates the toxicity of antisense oligonucleotides (ASO) while maintaining the efficacy. However, the general effect of alkynyl modifications on the duplex&#8208;forming ability of oligonucleotides (ONs) is unclear. In this study, post&#8208;synthetic nucleobase modification by Sonogashira coupling in aqueous medium was carried out to efficiently evaluate the physiological properties of various ONs with alkynyl&#8208;modified nucleobases. Although several undesired reactions, including nucleobase cyclization, were observed, various types of alkynyl&#8208;modified ONs were successfully obtained via Sonogashira coupling of ONs containing iodinated nucleobases. Evaluation of the stability of the duplex formed by the synthesized alkynyl&#8208;modified ONs showed that the alkynyl modification of pyrimidine was less tolerated than that of purine, although both the modifications occurred in the major groove of the duplex. These results can be attributed to the bond angle of the alkyne on the pyrimidine and the close proximity of the alkynyl substituents to the phosphodiester backbone. The synthetic method developed in this study may contribute to the screening of the optimal chemical modification of ASO because various alkynyl&#8208;modified ONs that are effective in reducing the toxicity of ASO can be easily synthesized by this method.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A post-synthetic nucleobase modification&lt;/b&gt; method for oligonucleotides via Sonogashira coupling is developed. This method enables efficient synthesis of various types of alkynyl-modified oligonucleotides and evaluation of the stability of the duplex formed by the synthesized alkynyl-modified oligonucleotides. Interestingly, alkynyl-modification on pyrimidine is less tolerated than on purine in duplex stability.

         <title>Mechanistic Characterisation of Collinodiene Synthase, a Diterpene Synthase from Streptomyces collinus</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two homologs of the diterpene synthase CotB2 for cyclooctat&#8208;9&#8208;en&#8208;7&#8208;ol from Streptomyces collinus and S. iakyrus were investigated. The enzyme from S. collinus produces the new compound collinodiene besides cyclooctat&#8208;9&#8208;en&#8208;7&#8208;ol and other side products. Isotopic labelling experiments were performed to enlighten the cyclisation mechanism.







Abstract
Two homologs of the diterpene synthase CotB2 from Streptomyces collinus (ScCotB2) and Streptomyces iakyrus (SiCotB2) were investigated for their products by in&#8197;vitro incubations of the recombinant enzymes with geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate, followed by compound isolation and structure elucidation by NMR. ScCotB2 produced the new compound collinodiene, besides the canonical CotB2 product cyclooctat&#8208;9&#8208;en&#8208;7&#8208;ol, dolabella&#8208;3,7,18&#8208;triene and dolabella&#8208;3,7,12&#8208;triene, while SiCotB2 gave mainly cyclooctat&#8208;9&#8208;en&#8208;7&#8208;ol and only traces of dolabella&#8208;3,7,18&#8208;triene. The cyclisation mechanism towards the ScCotB2 products and their absolute configurations were investigated through isotopic labelling experiments.

         <title>Double&#8208;Walled Covalent Organic Frameworks with High Stability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two covalent organic frameworks with double&#8208;walled linkages were successfully synthesized and exhibited excellent stability when treated with boiling water and basic solutions. Moreover, these double&#8208;walled COFs exhibited remarkable IAST selectivity for favored adsorption of CO2 over N2.







Abstract
Double&#8208;walled covalent organic frameworks, consisting of two same building blocks parallel to each other forming ladder&#8208;shape linkers, could enhance the stability of the frameworks and increase the density of functional sites, thus making them suitable for various applications. In this study, two double&#8208;walled covalent organic frameworks, namely DW&#8208;COF&#8208;1 and DW&#8208;COF&#8208;2, were successfully synthesized via imine condensation. The resulting DW&#8208;COFs exhibited a honeycomb topology, high crystallinity and stability. Particularly, DW&#8208;COF&#8208;2 showed excellent resistance toward boiling water, strong acid, and strong base, due to its double&#8208;walled structure, which limits the exposure of labile imine bonds to external chemical environments. The DW&#8208;COFs showed high porosity near 900&#8197;m2/g, making them suitable for gas storage/separation. The selective gas adsorption experiments showed that at 273&#8197;K and 1&#8197;atm pressure, DW&#8208;COF&#8208;1 and DW&#8208;COF&#8208;2 exhibited a good IAST selectivity towards CO2/N2 (15/85) adsorption, with selectivity values of 121.3 and 56.4 for CO2 over N2, respectively.

         <title>Improved Triplex&#8208;Forming Isoorotamide PNA Nucleobases for A&#8722;U Recognition of RNA Duplexes
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Four isoorotamide nucleobases (Io5&#8722;Io8) are reported for incorporation into peptide nucleic acids aimed at RNA triple&#8208;helix formation. These extended nucleobases require only two hydrogen bonds across the Hoogsteen face of the A&#8722;U base pair for strong and selective binding, unlike previously reported extended nucleobases. Molecular dynamics simulations provide further insight into triple helical binding affinity and selectivity.







Abstract
Four new isoorotamide (Io)&#8208;containing PNA nucleobases have been designed for A&#8722;U recognition of double helical RNA. New PNA monomers were prepared efficiently and incorporated into PNA nonamers for binding A&#8722;U in a PNA:RNA2 triplex. Isothermal titration calorimetry and UV thermal melting experiments revealed slightly improved binding affinity for singly modified PNA compared to known A&#8208;binding nucleobases. Molecular dynamics simulations provided further insights into binding of Io bases in the triple helix. Together, the data revealed interesting insights into binding modes including the notion that three Hoogsteen hydrogen bonds are unnecessary for strong selective binding of an extended nucleobase. Cationic monomer Io8 additionally gave the highest affinity observed for an A&#8208;binding nucleobase to date. These results will help inform future nucleobase design toward the goal of recognizing any sequence of double helical RNA.

         <title>Structural Variations in Carboxylated Bispidine Ligands: Influence of Positional Isomerism and Rigidity on the Conformation, Stability, Inertness and Relaxivity of their Mn2+ Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mn(II) complexes with acetate&#8208;substituted bispidine ligands can adopt different conformations depending on the N3 substituent. Complexes in chair&#8208;chair conformation display high relaxivity and strong kinetic inertness, both very important for their potential use as MRI contrast agents. In contrast, the boat&#8208;chair conformers undergo fast dissociation and do no retain good relaxivity.







Abstract
Mn2+ complexes of 2,4&#8208;pyridyl&#8208;disubstituted bispidine ligands have emerged as more biocompatible alternatives to Gd3+&#8208;based MRI probes. They display relaxivities comparable to that of commercial contrast agents and high kinetic inertness, unprecedented for Mn2+ complexes. The chemical structure, in particular the substituents on the two macrocyclic nitrogens N3 and N7, are decisive for the conformation of the Mn2+ complexes, and this will in turn determine their thermodynamic, kinetic and relaxation properties. We describe the synthesis of four ligands with acetate substituents in positions N3, N7 or both. We evidence that the bispidine conformation is dependent on N3 substitution, with direct impact on the thermodynamic stability, kinetic inertness, hydration state and relaxivity of the Mn2+ complexes. These results unambiguously show that (i) solely a chair&#8208;chair conformation allows for favorable inertness and relaxivity, and (ii) in this family such chair&#8208;chair conformation is accessible only for ligands without N3&#8208;appended carboxylates.

         <title>A multi&#8208;pyridine&#8208;anchored and &#8208;linked bilayer photocathode for water reduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of efficient photocathodes is of critical importance for the constructions of promising tandem photoelectrochemical cells. Most known dye&#8208;sensitized photocathodes are prepared with the conventional carboxylic or phosphonic acid anchors and requires the presence of other terminal linking groups to connect catalysts, suffering from high synthetic difficulty and low adsorption stability in aqueous media. Herein, a compact bilayer photocathode is prepared by using a pyrene&#8208;based photosensitizer with multiple terminal pyridine moieties as both the anchoring and linking groups to connect a Co hydrogen&#8208;evolution catalyst to the NiO substrate. The catalyst and dye molecule are assembled in a layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer manner on NiO through the metal&#8208;pyridine coordination. This photocathode exhibits good dye adsorption stability in aqueous media. A stable cathodic photocurrent of 70 &#956;A/cm2 has been achieved with H2 being generated at the photocathode under the visible&#8208;light irradiation. The Faraday efficiency of H2 evolution was estimated to be 9.1%. Transient absorption spectral studies suggest that the interfacial hole transfer occurs within a few of picoseconds. The integration of the organic photosensitizer with pyridine anchoring and linking groups is expected to provide a simple method for the fabrication of stable and efficient photocathodes</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral 4&#8208;MeO&#8208;Pyridine (MOPY) Catalyst for Enantioselective Cyclopropanation: Attenuation of Lewis Basicity Leads to Improved Catalytic Efficiency</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The design of pyridine&#8208;derived organocatalysts aims at the increase of their Lewis basicity, however such an approach is not always efficient. For example, strongly Lewis basic DMAP is completely inefficient as catalyst in the cyclopropanation reaction. Herein we disclose an alternative approach that relies on attenuation of DMAP Lewis basicity. Specifically, the replacement of 4&#8208;dimethylamino substituent in DMAP for 4&#8208;MeO group delivered a highly efficient catalyst for cyclopropanation of electron&#8208;deficient olefins with &#945;&#8208;bromoketones. Kinetic studies provide compelling evidence that the superior catalytic efficiency of 4&#8208;MeO pyridine (MOPY) is to be attributed to the favorable balance between Lewis basicity and leaving group ability. The use of chiral, enantiomerically pure MOPY catalyst has helped to achieve high enantioselectivities (up to 91:9 er) in the previously unreported pyridine&#8208;catalyzed cyclopropanation reaction.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A solid&#8208;state method was developed for generating diarylisonaphthofurans from 1,3&#8208;diaryl&#8208;1,3&#8208;dihydronaphthofuranols. The generated reactive molecules were stable in the solid state and could be stored without any precaution. Their X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis revealed a typical quinoidal structure. Furthermore, the mechanochemical Diels&#8211;Alder reaction of 1,3&#8208;diarylisonaphthofurans with epoxynaphthalenes afforded synthetically attractive diepoxypentacenes.</dc:description>

         <title>Azotriptycenes: Photoswitchable Molecular Brakes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The control of molecular motions is a central topic of molecular machine research. Molecular brakes are fundamental building blocks towards such goal as they allow deliberately decelerating specific motions after an outside stimulus is applied. Here we present azotriptycenes as structural framework for light&#8208;controlled molecular brakes. The intrinsic kinetics and their changes upon azotriptycene isomerization are scrutinized comprehensively by a mixed theoretical and variable temperature NMR approach. With azotriptycenes C&#8208;N bond rotation rates can be decelerated or accelerated reversibly by up to five orders of magnitude. Rate change effects are highly localized and are strongest for the C&#8208;N bond connecting a triptycene rotor fragment to the central diazo group. The detailed mechanistic insights provide a solid basis for further conscious design and applications in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>Simple Synthesis of 1,2&#8208;Dideoxy&#8208;2&#8208;Vinyl Carbohydrates by Tin&#8208;Free Radical Reactions of Xanthates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Vinyl&#8208;substituted carbohydrates have been synthesized from glycals derived from hexoses and pentoses. Key step is the radical reaction of xanthates in the presence of triethylborane, a nontoxic reagent. The mechanism has been investigated by isolation of various side products, which speak for a reversibility of the cyclopropylmethyl radical ring&#8208;opening. Compared to reactions with tributyltin hydride, higher regioselectivities in favor of the 2&#8208;vinylsubstituted sugars have been obtained. Yields are slightly lower with triethylborane, but all products have been isolated in analytically pure form. The new reaction is applicable to benzyl&#8208; and silyl&#8208;protected carbohydrates, which makes free sugars accessible as well. Overall, more than 15 1,2&#8208;dideoxy&#8208;2&#8208;vinyl carbohydrates have been synthesized from simple precursors in only few steps.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of 10&#8208;Membered Azecines through Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Formal [6+4] Cycloaddition and Their Transannular Reaction to Polycyclic Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Azecine fragments are frequently presented in natural products and bioactive compounds. However, minor efforts have been devoted to these 10&#8208;membered N&#8208;heterocycless, and their synthesis is still challenging. We report herein the first catalytic formal [6+4] cycloaddition for the synthesis of 10&#8208;membered azecines. Under palladium catalysis, the reaction of &#948;&#8208;vinylvalerolactones and benzofuran&#8208;derived azadienes proceeds smoothly to afford benzofuran&#8208;fused azecines with high diastereoselectivity in moderate to good yields. A unique transannular reaction of these 10&#8208;membered azecines for the construction of polycyclic compounds is also demonstrated.</dc:description>

         <title>Exploration of the Copper&#8208;Catalyzed Sydnone and Sydnonimine&#8208;Alkyne Cycloaddition Reactions by High&#8208;Throughput Experimentation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reactivity of sydnones and sydnonimines toward terminal alkynes under copper catalysis has been explored using High&#8208;Throughput&#8208;Experimentation. A large panel of ligands and reaction conditions have been tested to optimize the copper&#8208;catalyzed sydnone click reaction discovered by our group ten years ago. This screening approach led to the identification of new ligands, which boosted the catalytic properties of copper and allowed the discovery of a new copper&#8208;catalyzed click&#8208;and&#8208;release reaction involving sydnonimines. This reaction allowed chemoselective ligation of terminal alkynes with sydnonimines and, simultaneously, the release of an isocyanate fragment molecule that can be used for further transformations.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorination Influences the Bioisostery of Myo&#8208;Inositol Pyrophosphate Analogs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Inositol pyrophosphates (PP&#8208;IPs) are densely phosphorylated messenger molecules involved in numerous biological processes. PP&#8208;IPs contain one or two pyrophosphate group(s) attached to a phosphorylated myo&#8208;inositol ring. 5PP&#8208;IP5 is the most abundant PP&#8208;IP in human cells. To investigate the function and regulation by PP&#8208;IPs in biological contexts, metabolically stable analogs have been developed. Here, we report the synthesis of a new fluorinated phosphoramidite reagent and its application for the synthesis of a difluoromethylene bisphosphonate analog of 5PP&#8208;IP5. Subsequently, the properties of all currently reported analogs were benchmarked using a number of biophysical and biochemical methods, including co&#8208;crystallization, ITC, kinase activity assays and chromatography. Together, the results showcase how small structural alterations of the analogs can have notable effects on their properties in a biochemical setting and will guide in the choice of the most suitable analog(s) for future investigations.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Nitrogen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ammonia is vital for fertilizer production, hydrogen storage, and alternative fuels. The conventional Haber&#8208;Bosch process for ammonia production is energy&#8208;intensive and environmentally harmful. Designing environmentally friendly and low&#8208;energy consumption strategies for electrocatalytic N2 reduction reaction (ENRR) in mild conditions is meaningful. Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) have been studied extensively for NRR due to their high atomic utilization and unique electronic structure but are limited by their poor faradic efficiency and low ammonia formation yield. Dual single&#8208;atom catalysts (DSACs) have recently emerged as a promising solution for the effective activation of molecular N2, providing diverse active sites and synergistic interactions between adjacent atoms. In this review, we summarize the latest advances in metal DSACs for electrochemical ENRR based on both theoretical calculations and experimental studies, including aspects such as their variety, coordination, support, N2 adsorption and activity mechanisms, the characterization of NRR and electrochemical cell Configuration. We also address challenges and prospects in this rapidly evolving field, providing a comprehensive overview of DSACs for ENRR.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanistic Study on Selenium&#8208; and Sulfur&#8208;mediated Isomerization of Hydroxamic Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present an in&#8208;depth computational study revealing the intriguing mechanism of the recently reported isomerization of hydroxamic acids into para&#8208;aminophenols catalyzed by phenylselenyl bromide under mild conditions. Our computations not only align with the reported experimental data, effectively explaining observed phenomena such as para&#8208;selectivity but also shed light on crucial aspects of the reaction mechanism that establish limitations on the scope of the studied rearrangement. Additionally, we performed a joint theoretical/experimental study to examine the potency of the phenylsulfenyl bromide to mediate the reaction under the same conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Isolation, Characterization and Reactivity of Key Intermediates Relevant to Reductive (Electro)catalysis with Cp*Rh Complexes containing Pyridyl&#8208;MIC (MIC = Mesoionic Carbene) Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In recent years, metal complexes of pyridyl&#8208;mesoionic carbene (MIC) ligands have been reported as excellent homogeneous and molecular electrocatalysts. In combination with group 9 metals, such ligands form highly active catalysts for hydrogenation/transfer hydrogenation/hydrosilylation catalysis and electrocatalysts for dihydrogen production. Despite such progress, very little is known about the structural/electrochemical/spectroscopic properties of crucial intermediates for such catalytic reactions with these ligands: solvato complexes, reduced complexes and hydridic species. We present here a comprehensive study involving the isolation, crystallographic characterization, electrochemical/spectroelectrochemical/theoretical investigations, and in&#8208;situ reactivity studies of all the aforementioned crucial intermediates involving Cp*Rh and pyridyl&#8208;MIC ligands. A detailed mechanistic study of the precatalytic activation of [RhCp*] complexes with pyridyl&#8208;MIC ligands is presented. Intriguingly, amphiphilicity of the [RhCp*]&#8208;hydride complexes was observed, displaying the substrate dependent transfer of H+, H&#8729; or H&#8722;. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first of its kind targeting intermediates and reactive species involving metal complexes of pyridyl&#8208;MIC ligands and investigating the interconversion amongst them.</dc:description>
