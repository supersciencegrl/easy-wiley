      <title>Molecular Chirality in Classical Spacetime: Solving the Controversy about the Spinning Cone Model of Rotating Molecules</title>
      <dc:description>
Re&#8208;examining chirality: The disagreement between Barron and Mislow regarding the potential chirality of a spinning cone is settled. The controversy comes from an ambiguity in the spinning cone model and a new definition of chirality, which encompasses the one introduced by Lord Kelvin, is used to prove that both authors were right.







Abstract
The spinning cone is a model of rotating molecules used by Barron in 1986 in relation to asymmetric synthesis and to parity violation. He considered that the non&#8208;translating cone spinning about its symmetry axis has false chirality (i.e., it is not chiral), whereas Mislow concluded in 1999 that it is indeed chiral and severely criticized the true versus false chirality nomenclature introduced by Barron, who still disagreed in 2013 with the conclusion of Mislow. Here, it is shown that this controversy comes from an ambiguity in the spinning cone model and that in fact both authors were right. Light is thrown on the true chirality versus false chirality controversy with a very recently published result, which was thus unavailable to both authors: this is a new definition of chirality that encompasses the one introduced by Lord Kelvin at the end of the 19th century.

      <title>Temperature Induced Aggregation of Organic Semiconductors</title>
      <dc:description>One important feature of organic semiconductors is their solution processability, which allows researchers to tune their aggregation states in solution and solid states and to control the processing conditions to reach desirable electronic and optoelectronic properties. Temperature is one of the most important processing parameters of organic semiconductors and has been studied extensively particularly for those conjugated small&#8208; and macro&#8208; molecules with strong temperature&#8208;dependent aggregation properties.

      <title>A porous mooncake&#8208;shaped Li4Ti5O12 anode material modified by SmF3 and its electrochemical performance in lithium&#8208;ion batteries</title>
      <dc:description>Reasonably designing and synthesizing advanced electrode materials is significant to enhance the electrochemical performance of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). Herein, a metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF, Mil&#8208;125) is used as a precursor and template to successfully synthesize the porous mooncake&#8208;shaped Li  4  Ti  5  O  12  (LTO) anode material assembled from nanoparticles. Even more critical, SmF  3  is used to modify the prepared porous mooncake&#8208;shaped LTO material. The SmF  3  modified LTO still maintains a porous mooncake&#8208;shaped structure with a large specific surface area, and the SmF  3  nanoparticles are observed to attach on the surface of the LTO material. It has been proved that the SmF  3  modification can further facilitate the transition from Ti  4+  to Ti  3+  , reduce the polarization of electrode, decrease charge transfer impedance (  R  ct  ) and solid electrolyte interface  impedance (  R  se  i  ), and increase the lithium&#8208;ions diffusion coefficient (  D  Li  ), thereby enhancing the electrochemical performance of LTO. Therefore, the porous mooncake&#8208;shaped LTO modified using 2  wt  % SmF  3  displays a large specific discharge capacity of 143.8 mAh g  &#8208;1  with an increment of 79.16% compared to pure LTO at a high rate of 10 C (1 C=170mAh g  &#8208;1  ), and shows a high retention rate of 96.4% after 500 cycles at 5 C&#8208;rate.</dc:description>

      <title>LGBTQ+ in STEM: Visibility and Beyond</title>
      <dc:description>
&#8220;Out and Proud&#8221; goes beyond slogans and efforts to make scientific workplaces more diverse and inclusive to LGBTQ+ scientists are being felt in Europe.







Abstract
Lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans, queer (LGBTQ+, &#8220;+&#8221;=plus other sexes, gender identities, and sexual orientation) people in the STEM fields (STEM=science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) continue to experience discrimination in their workplace. In the last decade, the clamor for safe and diverse spaces continue to rise. Indeed, social media plays a huge part on increasing visibility of the LGBTQ+ community in STEM. LGBTQ+ scientists have not only promoted discourse and raised concerns to the online community, but more importantly, supported each other in platforms such as Twitter. Beyond social media, work at the institutes by LGBTQ+ individuals are also bearing fruit. This piece explores the grassroots work of scientists as they work hand&#8208;in&#8208;hand with their institute staff and leadership to promote diversity and inclusivity within and beyond their community.

This piece explores the grassroots work of scientists as they work hand&#8208;in&#8208;hand with their institute staff and leadership to promote diversity and inclusivity within and beyond their community.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Investigating Ugi / Passerini multicomponent reactions for the Site&#8208;Selective Conjugation of Native Trastuzumab</title>
      <dc:description>Site&#8208;selective modification of proteins has been the object of intense studies over the past decades, especially in the therapeutic field. Prominent results have been obtained with recombinant proteins, for which site&#8208;specific conjugation is made possible by the incorporation of particular amino acid residues or peptide sequences. In parallel, methods for the site&#8208;selective and site&#8208;specific conjugation of native and natural proteins are starting to thrive, allowing the controlled functionalization of various types of amino acid residues. Pursuing the efforts in this field, we planned to develop a new type of site&#8208;selective method, aiming at the simultaneous conjugation of two amino acid residues. We reasoned that this should give higher chances of developing a site&#8208;selective strategy compared to the large majority of existing methods that solely target a single residue. We opted for the Ugi four&#8208;center three&#8208;component reaction to implement this idea, with the aim of conjugating the side&#8208;chain amine and carboxylate groups of two neighbouring lysine and aspartate/glutamate. Herein, we show that this strategy can give access to valuable antibody conjugates bearing several different payloads, and limits the potential conjugation sites to only six on the model antibody trastuzumab.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>
Borosulfates are oxoanionic compounds consisting of condensed sulfur&#8208; and boron&#8208;centered tetrahedra and are structurally similar to silicates. Their anionic subunits consist of alternating (SO4) and (BO4) tetrahedra forming oligomers, single and multiple chains, layers and extended 3D network structures. For more information on the synthesis strategies, crystal chemistry of borosulfates and their properties, see the Review by H. Huppertz et al. on page&#8197;7966&#8197;ff.

      <title>Frontispiece: Polar Organofluorine Substituents: Multivicinal Fluorines on Alkyl Chains and Alicyclic Rings</title>
      <dc:description>
This Review in organo&#8208;fluorine chemistry outlines the synthesis and properties of compounds with multiple vicinal fluorinated alkyl chains and rings. Chain conformations of individual diastereoisomers with &#8208;CHF&#8208; at adjacent carbons are influenced by stereoelectronic factors associated with the polar C&#8722;F bond and also the polarised geminal hydrogens. Chains generally prefer a conformation which acts to minimise overall molecular polarity, and where the C&#8722;F bonds orient away from each other. However, when vicinal fluorines are positioned all&#8208;cis on a ring, this results in an electronegative &#8216;fluorine face&#8217; and an electropositive &#8216;hydrogen face&#8217;, and then these Janus face molecules become polarised and are highly crystalline. For the full story see the Review by D. O'Hagan on page&#8197;7981&#8197;ff.

      <title>An artificial hemoprotein with inducible peroxidase&#8208; and monooxygenase&#8208;like activities</title>
      <dc:description>A new inducible artificial metalloenzyme was obtained by covalent attachment of a Mn(III)&#8208;tetraphenylporphyrin to the artificial bidomain repeat protein (A3A3&#8217;)Y26C. The biohybrid was characterized by MALDI&#8208;ToF MS, circular dichroism and UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopies. Its peroxidase activity was tested as well as its monooxygenase activity for the oxidation of thioanisole into sulfoxide by H  2  O  2  . Catalytic tests were performed on the original scaffold and with&#160; several co&#8208;catalysts a) additional imidazole, b) a specific &#945;Rep bA3&#8208;2 that induces the opening of the (A3A3&#8217;) interdomain region and c) a &#945;Rep bA3&#8208;2 bearing a His6&#8208;Tag (His6&#8208;bA3&#8208;2), and the best activity was obtained with His6&#8208;bA3&#8208;2. The mechanism was rationalized by a molecular modeling study including protein&#8208;ligand docking and large scale molecular dynamics. It appears that: 1) the hydrophobic Mn&#8208;porphyrin fits well into the (A3A3&#8217;)Y26C cavity, becomes protected by the protein and fully soluble in water; 2) the biohybrid alone does not display any catalytic activity, even in the presence of imidazole because of a closed conformation of the system; 3) opening of the binding site by bA3&#8208;2 leads to a noticeable activity and, 4) the best activity is obtained in the presence of the His6&#8208;Tag with one or two of the histidines able to coordinate to the metal acting as co&#8208;catalyst in the reactions. To the best of our knowledge, this constitutes the first example of an entirely artificial metalloenzyme with inducible peroxidase and monooxygenase activities, reminiscent of allosteric regulation of natural enzymatic pathways.</dc:description>

      <title>Multifunctional Electrocatalytic Cathodes Derived from Metal Organic Frameworks for Advanced Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>The rechargeable lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) battery is a promising candidate for the next&#8211;generation of energy storage technology, owing to the high theoretical capacity, high specific energy density, and low cost of electrode materials. The main drawbacks of developing long&#8211;life Li&#8211;S batteries are capacity fading and the kinetic sluggishness at the cathode caused by the polysulfides shuttle. To address these limitations, we have designed novel nanocages containing cobalt phosphide (CoP) nanoparticles embedded in highly porous nitrogen&#8211;doped carbon (CoP&#8211;N&#8211;GC) by thermal annealing of ZIF&#8211;67 in a reductive atmosphere followed by a phosphidation step using sodium hypophosphite. The large surface area and the uniform homogeneous distribution of CoP nanoparticles within the N&#8211;doped nanocages graphitic carbon act as electrocatalysts to suppress the shuttle of soluble polysulfides through strong chemical interactions, while catalyzing the sulfur redox. As a result, the S@CoP&#8211;N&#8211;GC electrode delivers an extremely high specific capacity of 1410 mA h g  &#8211;1  at 0.1 C (1C = 1675 mA g  &#8211;1  ) with an excellent coulombic efficiency of 99.7%. Moreover, capacity retention from 864 to 678 mA h g  &#8211;1  was obtained after 460 cycles with a very low decay rate of 0.046% per cycle at 0.5 C. Therefore, the combination of CoP catalyst and polar conductive porous carbon effectively stabilizes the sulfur cathode, enhancing the electrochemical performance and stability of the battery.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Targeted alpha&#8208;therapy (TAT) has great potential for treating a broad range of late stage cancers by delivering a focused and lethal radiation dose to tumors. Actinium&#8208;225 ( 225 Ac) is an emerging alpha emitter suitable for TAT, however the availability of chelators for Ac remains limited to a small number of examples (DOTA and macropa).

We synthesized 225 Ac&#8208;crown&#8208;&#945;MSH, a peptide targeting the melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R), specifically expressed in primary and metastatic melanoma. Biodistribution of 225 Ac&#8208;crown&#8208;&#945;MSH showed favorable tumor&#8208;to&#8208;background ratios at 2 hours post injection in a preclinical model. In addition, we demonstrated dramatically different biodistrubution patterns of 225 Ac&#8208; crown&#8208;&#945;MSH when subjected to different latency times before injection.

      <title>Towards more photostable, brighter, and less phototoxic chromophores: Synthesis and properties of porphyrins functionalized with cyclooctatetraene</title>
      <dc:description>Free base and zinc porphyrins functionalized with cyclooctatetraene (COT), a molecule known as a good triplet state quencher, have been obtained and characterized in detail by structural, spectral, and photophysical techniques. Substitution with COT leads to a dramatic decrease of the intrinsic lifetime of the porphyrin triplet. As a result, photostability in oxygen&#8208;free solution increases by 2&#8208;3 orders of magnitude. In non&#8208;degassed solutions, improvement of photostability is about tenfold for zinc porphyrins, but the free bases become less photostable. Similar quantum yields of photodegradation in free base and zinc porphyrins containing the COT moiety indicate a common mechanism of photochemical decomposition. The new porphyrins are expected to be much less phototoxic, since the quantum yield of singlet oxygen formation strongly decreases because of shorter triplet lifetime. The reduction of triplet lifetime should also enhance the brightness and reduce blinking in porphyrin chromophores emitting in single molecule regime, since the duration of dark OFF states will be shorter.</dc:description>

      <title>Characterization of the locally excited and charge&#8208;transfer states of the anticancer drug lapatinib by ultrafast spectroscopy and computational studies</title>
      <dc:description>Lapatinib (LAP) is an anticancer drug, which is metabolized to the N&#8208; and O&#8208;dealkylated products (N&#8208;LAP and O&#8208;LAP, respectively). In view of the photosensitizing potential of related drugs, a complete experimental and theoretical study has been performed on LAP, N&#8208;LAP and O&#8208;LAP, both in solution and upon complexation with human serum albumin (HSA). In organic solvent, coplanar locally excited (LE) emissive states are generated; they rapidly evolve towards twisted intramolecular charge&#8208;transfer (ICT) states. By contrast, within HSA only LE states are detected. Accordingly, femtosecond transient absorption reveals a very fast switching (ca. 2 ps) from LE (&#955;  max  = 550 nm) to ICT states (&#955;  max  = 480 nm) in solution, whereas within HSA the LE species become stabilized and live much longer (up to the ns scale). Interestingly, molecular dynamics simulation studies confirm that the coplanar orientation is preferred for LAP (or to a lesser extent N&#8208;LAP) within HSA, explaining the experimental results.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY) dyes represent a particular class within the broad array of potential photosensitizers. Their highly fluorescent nature opens the door for theragnostic applications, combining imaging and therapy using a single, easily synthesized chromophore.

Here, we present a series of compact BODIPY&#8208;acridine dyads, active in the phototherapeutic window and showing balanced brightness and phototoxic power. Although the donor&#8208;acceptor design was envisioned to introduce a charge transfer state to assist in intersystem crossing, quantum&#8208;chemical calculations refute this.

      <title>Aqueous Precursor Induced Morphological Change and Improved Water Stability of CsPbBr3 Nanocrystals</title>
      <dc:description>In literature, lead halide perovskites are very notable for their degradation in the presence of polar solvents, such as water.

In this order, the shape and phase transformation from CsPbBr3 nanoplates to CsPbBr3/Cs4PbBr6 nanorods and Cs4PbBr6 nanowires can be controlled with increasing water content in the precursor solution. While adding water up to an ideal amount, CsPbBr3 maintains its phase and nanoplates morphology.

      <title>Ambident Reactivity of Imidazolium Cations as Evidence of the Dynamic Nature of N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene&#8208;Mediated Organocatalysis</title>
      <dc:description>
Ambident nucleophilic reactivity of imidazolium cations at the C2 and C4 carbene centers indicated the dynamic nature of imidazolium&#8208;based organocatalysis proceeding by means of a covalent interaction of imidazolium carbenes with carbonyl substrates and was explained by the generation of the H&#8208;bonded ditopic carbanionic carbenes along with the classical C2 carbenes. Based on these findings, covalent bonding of imidazolium carbenes with carbonyl group of enolizable ketones was investigated. More information can be found in the Full Paper by K. Galkin, B. Karlinskii, V.&#8197;P. Ananikov, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.201905704).

      <title>Female Faculty: Why So Few and Why Care?</title>
      <dc:description>
Diversity in academia: Data shows that there are few female faculty in academia today, with the percentage decreasing the higher the rank. There are many common responses to gender equality efforts that hamper progress of women in academia. Herein, we counteract such comments and discuss possible solutions along with concerns about how the COVID&#8208;19 pandemic may affect diversity in academia.







Abstract
Despite slow ongoing progress in increasing the representation of women in academia, women remain significantly under&#8208;represented at senior levels, in particular in the natural sciences and engineering. Not infrequently, this is downplayed by bringing forth arguments such as inherent biological differences between genders, that current policies are adequate to address the issue, or by deflecting this as being &#8220;not my problem&#8221; among other examples. In this piece we present scientific evidence that counters these claims, as well as a best&#8208;practice example, Genie, from Chalmers University of Technology, where one of the authors is currently employed. We also highlight particular challenges caused by the current COVID&#8208;19 pandemic. Finally, we conclude by proposing some possible solutions to the situation and emphasize that we need to all do our part, to ensure that the next generation of academics experience a more diverse, inclusive, and equitable working environment.

      <title>Synthesis, Structure, Reactivity and Catalytic Implications of a Cationic, Acetylide&#8208;Bridged Trigold&#8211;JohnPhos Species</title>
      <dc:description>
Multinuclear gold: A new family of tri&#8208;AuI complexes have been characterised as intermediates during the [AuIL][SbF6] catalytic preparation of acetaldehyde acetals. These well&#8208;characterised cationic AuI intermediates lend support to the proposed reaction mechanism. An analogous copper complex revealed different behaviour, leading to a vinylphosphonium and copper nanoparticles.







Abstract
The cationic complex [(JohnPhos&#8211;Au)3(acetylide)][SbF6] (JohnPhos=(2&#8208;biphenyl)di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphosphine, L1) has been characterised structurally and features an acetylide&#8211;trigold(I)&#8211;JohnPhos system; the trinuclear&#8211;acetylide unit, coordinated to the monodentate bulk phosphines, adopts an unprecedented &#956;,&#951;1,&#951;2,&#951;1 coordination mode with an additional interaction between distal phenyl rings and gold centres. Other cationic &#963;,&#960;&#8208;[(gold(I)L1)2] complexes have also been isolated. The reaction of trimethylsilylacetylene with various alcohols (iPrOH, nBuOH, n&#8208;HexOH) catalysed by cationic [AuIL1][SbF6] complexes in CH2Cl2 at 50&#8201;&#176;C led to the formation of acetaldehyde acetals with a high degree of chemo&#8208; and regioselectivity. The reaction mechanism was studied, and several organic and inorganic intermediates have been characterised. A comparative study with the analogous cationic [CuIL1][PF6] complex revealed different behaviour; the copper metal is lost from the coordination sphere leading to the formation of cationic vinylphosphonium and copper nanoparticles. Additionally, a new catalytic approach for the formation of this high&#8208;value cationic vinylphosphonium has been established.

      <title>Activity&#8208;Based Sensing of Ascorbate by Using Copper&#8208;Mediated Oxidative Bond Cleavage</title>
      <dc:description>
Probing ascorbate: A new, activity&#8208;based sensing strategy was developed for the highly selective detection of ascorbate. A copper(II) complex was designed to be activated by ascorbate to effect an oxidative bond cleavage and release an emissive fluorophore for a turn&#8208;on signal. The new ascorbate probes can be applied in complex matrix including food, plasma, and live cells.







Abstract
Ascorbate is an important biological reductant and enzyme cofactor. Although direct detection through ascorbate&#8208;mediated reduction is possible, this approach suffers from poor selectivity due to the wide range of cellular reducing agents. To overcome this limitation, we leverage reduction potential of ascorbate to mediate a copper&#8208;mediated oxidative bond cleavage of ether&#8208;caged fluorophores. The copper(II) complexes supported by a {bis(2&#8208;pyridylmethyl)}benzylamine or a {bis(2&#8208;pyridylmethyl)}(2&#8208;methoxybenzyl)amine ligand were identified as an ascorbate responsive unit and their reaction with ascorbate yields a copper&#8208;based oxidant that enables rapid benzylic oxidation and the release of an ether&#8208;caged dye (coumarin or fluorescein). The copper&#8208;mediated bond cleavage is specific to ascorbate and the trigger can be readily derivatized for tuning photophysical properties of the probes. The probes were successfully applied for the fluorometric detection of ascorbate in commercial food samples, human plasma, and serum, and within live cells by using confocal microscopy and flow cytometry.

      <title>Engineering Bifunctional Host Materials of Sulfur and Lithium&#8208;Metal Based on Nitrogen&#8208;Enriched Polyacrylonitrile for Li&#8211;S Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
Polyacrylonitrile (PAN) is delicately engineered as a bifunctional host material to simultaneously solve the problems of the shuttle effect in the cathode and lithium dendrite in the anode, which leads to improved electrochemical performances of both electrodes. Due to excellent bifunctional host characteristics, the full cell demonstrates an outstanding long&#8208;term cycling capability.







Abstract
Lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries (LSBs) still suffer from the shuttle effect on the cathode and the lithium dendrite on the anode. Herein, polyacrylonitrile (PAN) is developed into a bifunctional host material to simultaneously address the challenges faced on both the sulfur cathode and lithium anode in LSBs. For the sulfur cathode, PAN is bonded with sulfur to produce sulfurized PAN (SPAN) to avoid the shuttle effect. The SPAN is accommodated into a conductive 3D CNTs&#8208;wrapped carbon foam to prepare a self&#8208;supporting cathode, which improves the electronic and ionic conductivity, and buffers the volume expansion. Thereby, it delivers reversible capacity, superb rate capability, and outstanding cycling stability. For the Li&#8208;metal anode, PAN aerogel is carbonized to give macroporous N&#8208;doped cross&#8208;linked carbon nanofiber that behaves as a lithiophilic host to regulate Li plating and suppress the growth of Li dendrite. Combining the improvements for both the cathode and anode realizes a remarkable long&#8208;term cyclability (765&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 300&#8197;cycles) in a full cell. It provides new opportunity to propel the practical application of advanced LSBs.

For the sulfur cathode, PAN is bonded with sulfur to produce sulfurized PAN (SPAN) to avoid the shuttle effect. The SPAN is accommodated into a conductive 3D CNTs&#8208;wrapped carbon foam to prepare a self&#8208;supporting cathode, which improves the electronic and ionic conductivity, and buffers the volume expansion. Thereby, it delivers reversible capacity, superb rate capability, and outstanding cycling stability. For the Li&#8208;metal anode, PAN aerogel is carbonized to give macroporous N&#8208;doped cross&#8208;linked carbon nanofiber that behaves as a lithiophilic host to regulate Li plating and suppress the growth of Li dendrite. Combining the improvements for both the cathode and anode realizes a remarkable long&#8208;term cyclability (765&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; after 300&#8197;cycles) in a full cell. It provides new opportunity to propel the practical application of advanced LSBs.&lt;/p&gt;

      <dc:description>The design and synthesis of a tweezer&#8208;shaped naphthalenediimide(NDI)&#8208;anthracene conjugate (  2NDI  ) are reported. The closed form (  &#960;  NDI  &#183;&#183;&#183;  &#960;  NDI  &#160;stack) of&#160;  2NDI  &#160;has been elucidated using single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis, where the existence of C&#8211;H &#8943; O hydrogen&#8208;bonding involving the nearest carbonyl oxygen of NDI unit has been also suggested. The tunability of&#160;  &#960;  NDI  &#183;&#183;&#183;  &#960;  NDI  &#160;interactions has been studied by means of UV/Vis absorption, fluorescence, NMR spectroscopies and molecular modelling.

      <title>Solution&#8208;based, anion&#8208;doping of Li4Ti5O12 Nanoflowers 
for Lithium&#8208;ion Battery Applications</title>
      <dc:description>Solution&#8208;based, anionic doping represents a convenient strategy with which to improve upon the conductivity of candidate anode materials such as Li  4  Ti  5  O  12  (LTO). As such, we have primarily devised novel synthetic hydrothermally&#8208;inspired protocols, aimed at the large scale production of unique halogen&#8208;doped, micron&#8208;scale, three&#8208;dimensional, hierarchical LTO flower&#8208;like motifs. Though we have explored F doping, we have concentrated herein primarily on the use of Cl dopants. Several experimental variables, such as dopant amount, lithium hydroxide concentration, and titanium butoxide purity, were probed and perfected. Furthermore, the Cl doping process did not damage the intrinsic LTO morphology. Our analysis, based on interpreting a compilation of SEM, XRD, XPS, and TEM&#8208;EDS results, was used to determine an optimized dopant concentration of Cl. Electrochemical tests demonstrated an increased capacity via cycling of 12% for a doped sample as compared with pristine LTO. Moreover, the Cl&#8208;doped LTO sample described in this study exhibited the highest discharge capacity yet reported for this material at 120 mAh/g, obtained with an observed rate of 2C. Overall, these data suggest that the Cl dopant likely enhances not only the ion transport capabilities but also the overall electrical conductivity of our as&#8208;prepared structures. To help explain these favorable findings, theoretical DFT calculations were used to postulate that the electronic conductivity and Li diffusion were likely improved by partially reducing Ti  4+  to Ti  3+  and widening the Li migration channel.</dc:description>

      <title>Asymmetric Hydrogenation of Cationic Intermediates for the Synthesis of Chiral N,O&#8208;Acetals</title>
      <dc:description>Over a half century, transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed homogeneous hydrogenation has been mainly focused on neutral and readily&#8208;prepared unsaturated substrates. While the addition of molecular hydrogen to C=C, C=N and C=O bonds was a well&#8208;studied paradigm, the asymmetric hydrogenation of cationic species was an underdeveloped area. In this research, we were seeking for a breakthrough in asymmetric hydrogenation to include cationic intermediates as the target and therefore expecting to apply this powerful tool in the construction of challenging chiral molecules. Under an acidic condition, both N &#8208; or O &#8208;acetyl salicylamides undergo cyclization to generate cationic intermediates, which was subsequentially reduced by an iridium or rhodium hydride complex. N,O &#8208;acetals were synthesized with remarkably high enantioselectivity. This catalytic strategy exhibited high efficiency (TON up to 4400) and high chemoselectivities. Mechanistic studies supported the hypothesis that a cationic intermediate was in situ formed and hydrogenated afterwards. A catalytic cycle was proposed with the hydride transfer from iridium complex to the cationic sp 2 &#8208;carbon being the rate determining step. A steric map of the catalyst was depicted to illustrate the chiral environment and a QSSR analysis showed how the enantiomeric induction was achieved in this chemical transformation.</dc:description>

      <title>Total Synthesis of a Partial Structure from Arabinogalactan and its Application for Allergy&#8208;Prevention</title>
      <dc:description>Arabinogalactan, a microheterogeneous polysaccharide occurring in plants, is known for its allergy&#8208;protective activity, which could potentially be used for preventive allergy treatment. New treatment options are highly desirable, especially in a preventive manner, due to the constant rise of atopic diseases worldwide. The structural origin of the allergy&#8208;protective activity of arabinogalactan is, however, still unclear and isolation of the polysaccharide is not feasible for pharmaceutical applications due to a variation of the activity of the natural product and contaminations with endotoxins. Therefore, a pentasaccharide partial structure was selected for total synthesis and subsequently coupled to a carrier protein to form a neoglycoconjugate. The allergy&#8208;protective activity of arabinogalactan could be reproduced with the partial structure in subsequent in vivo experiments. This is the first example of a successful simplification of arabinogalactan with a single partial structure while retaining its allergy&#8208;preventive potential.</dc:description>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Arabinogalactan, a microheterogeneous polysaccharide occurring in plants, is known for its allergy&#8208;protective activity, which could potentially be used for preventive allergy treatment. New treatment options are highly desirable, especially in a preventive manner, due to the constant rise of atopic diseases worldwide. The structural origin of the allergy&#8208;protective activity of arabinogalactan is, however, still unclear and isolation of the polysaccharide is not feasible for pharmaceutical applications due to a variation of the activity of the natural product and contaminations with endotoxins. Therefore, a pentasaccharide partial structure was selected for total synthesis and subsequently coupled to a carrier protein to form a neoglycoconjugate. The allergy&#8208;protective activity of arabinogalactan could be reproduced with the partial structure in subsequent in vivo experiments. This is the first example of a successful simplification of arabinogalactan with a single partial structure while retaining its allergy&#8208;preventive potential.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Enzymatic Insertion of Lipids Increases Membrane Tension for Inhibiting Cancer Cells</title>
      <dc:description>Although lipids contribute to cancer drug resistance, it is challenging to target diverse range of lipids. Here we show enzymatically inserting exceedingly simple synthetic lipids into membranes for increasing membrane tension and selectively inhibiting drug resistant cancer cells. The lipid, formed by conjugating dodecylamine to D&#8208;phosphotyrosine, self&#8208;assembles to form micelles. Enzymatic dephosphorylation of the micelles inserts the lipids into membranes and increases membrane tension. This transformation of micelles effectively inhibits a drug resistant glioblastoma cell (T98G) or a triple&#8208;negative breast cancer cell (HCC1937), without inducing acquired drug resistance. Moreover, the enzymatic reaction of the micelles promotes the accumulation of the lipids in the membranes of subcellular organelles (e.g., endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Golgi, and mitochondria), thus activating multiple regulated cell death pathways. This work, as the first report that a multiple step molecular process increases membrane tension for inhibiting cancer cells, illustrates a new and powerful supramolecular approach for antagonizing difficult drug targets.</dc:description>

      <title>Triarylborane Appended Anils and Boranils: Solid State Emission, Mechanofluorochromism and Phosphorescence</title>
      <dc:description>Herein we report the design, synthesis, optical and mechanoluminescence properties of a series of conjugates having covalently linked triarylborane (TAB) and anils/boranils (TAB&#8208;anils:  1a  &#8208;  3a  and TAB&#8208;boranils:  1  &#8208;  3  ). The electronic interaction between TAB and anils/boranils in  1a  &#8208;  3a  and  1  &#8208;  3  were finetuned by changing the position of the boryl moiety on the phenyl spacer connecting TAB and anils/boranils units. Boryl moiety at the  meta  position (  1a  ) of the phenyl spacer stabilizes enolic form (E&#8208;OH) while boryl moiety at the  para  position (  2a  and  3a  ) stabilize keto form (Z&#8208;NH) in the solid state. However, in solutions state  1a  ,  2a  and  3a  exhibit keto&#8208;enol tautomerism in both ground and excited states. Both TAB coupled anils and boranils show red shifted absorption compared to the model compounds  4a  and  4,  devoid of TAB moiety indicating the effective participation of empty  p  &#8208;orbital on boron center. These compounds show vivid emission in solid&#8208;state and the luminescence color tunability was realized. Compounds  1  and  2  showed the fluorescence variations in response to the external stimuli such as mechanical grinding. TAB coupled boranil complexes exhibited the phosphorescence emission (77 K) with a long lifetime (18&#8208;46 ms). The detailed optical properties for TAB coupled anils (  1a  &#8208;  3a  ) and boranils (  1  &#8208;  3  ) are rationalized in the context of quantum mechanical calculations.</dc:description>

      <title>Syntheses of Salmonella Paratyphi A associated oligosaccharide antigens and development towards anti&#8208;paratyphoid fever vaccines</title>
      <dc:description>With the emergence of multidrug resistant  Salmonella  strains, the development of anti&#8208;  Salmonella  vaccines is an important task. Currently there are no approved vaccines against  Salmonella  Paratyphi A, the leading cause of paratyphoid fever. To fill this gap, oligosaccharides corresponding to the  O  &#8208;polysaccharide repeating units from the surface of  Salmonella  Paratyphi A have been synthesized through convergent stereoselective glycosylations. The synthetic glycan antigen was conjugated with a powerful immunogenic carrier system, the bacteriophage Q&#946;. The resulting construct was able to elicit strong and long&#8208;lasting anti&#8208;glycan IgG antibody responses, which were highly selective toward  Salmonella  Paratyphi A associated glycans. The availability of well&#8208;defined glycan antigen enabled the determination that one repeating unit of the polysaccharide is sufficient to induce protective antibodies, and the paratose residue and/or the  O  &#8208;acetyl modifications on the backbone are important for recognition by antibodies elicited by a Q&#946;&#8208;tetrasaccharide conjugate.

      <title>Bivariate metal&#8208;organic frameworks with tunable spin&#8208;crossover properties</title>
      <dc:description>In this work, we have screened out pyrazine (A), aminopyrazine (B), quinoxaline (C), and 5,6,7,8&#8208;tetrahydroquinoxaline (D) among a large number of pyrazine derivatives to construct Hofmann&#8208;type MOFs Fe(L)[M(CN)4] (M = Pt, Pd) with similar 3D pillared&#8208;layer structures. X&#8208;ray single crystal diffraction reveals that the alternate linkage between M and Fe(II) ions through cyano bridges forms the 2D extended metal cyanide sheets, and ligands  A&#8208;D  acted as vertical columns to connnect 2D sheets to give 3D pillared&#8208;layer structures. Subsequently, a series of bivariate MOFs were constructed by pairwise combination of the four ligands  A&#8208;D  , which were confirmed by  1  H NMR, PXRD, FT&#8208;IR and Raman. The results demonstrated that ligand size and crystallization velocity play a dominant role in constructing bivariate Hofmann&#8208;type MOFs. More importantly, the SCO properties of the bivariate MOFs can be finely tuned by adjusting the proportion of two pillared ligands in the 3D Hofmann&#8208;type structures. Remarkably, the spin transition temperatures,  Tc  &#8593; and  Tc  &#8595; of the Fe(  A)x(B)1&#8208;x  [Pt(CN)4] (x = 0&#8208;1) can be adjusted from 239 to 254 K and 248 K to 284 K, respectively. Meanwhile the width of hysteresis loops can be widened from 9 to 30 K.

      <title>Synthesis of Oligonucleotides containing the cis&#8208;Interstrand Crosslink Produced by Mitomycins in their Reaction with DNA.</title>
      <dc:description>Mitomycin C, (MC), an antitumor drug and decarbamoylmitomycin C, (DMC), a derivative of MC lacking the carbamoyl moiety, are DNA alkylating agents which can form DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICLs) between deoxyguanosine residues located on opposing DNA strands. MC forms primarily deoxyguanosine adducts with a 1&#8221;&#8208; R stereochemistry at the guanine&#8208;mitosene bond (1&#8221;&#8208;&#945;, trans ) whereas DMC forms mainly adducts with a 1&#8221;&#8208; S stereochemistry (1&#8221;&#8208;&#946;, cis ). The crosslinking reaction is diastereospecific: trans &#8208;crosslinks are formed exclusively at CpG sequences, while cis &#8208;crosslinks are formed only at GpC sequences. Until now, oligonucleotides containing 1&#8221;&#8208;&#946;&#8208;deoxyguanosine adducts or ICL at a specific site could not be synthesized, thus limiting the investigation of the role played by the stereochemical configuration at C1'' in the toxicity of these compounds. Here, we present a novel biomimetic synthesis to access these substrates. Structural proof of the adducted oligonucleotides and ICL were provided by enzymatic digestion to nucleosides, high resolution mass spectral analysis, CD spectroscopy and UV melting temperature studies. Finally, a virtual model of the 25 mer 1&#8221;&#8208;&#946; ICL synthesized was created to explore the conformational space and structural features of the crosslinked duplex.</dc:description>

      <title>Amine Catalysis with Substrates Bearing N&#8208;Heterocyclic Moieties&#160;Enabled by Control over the Enamine Pyramidalization Direction</title>
      <dc:description>Stereoselective organocatalytic&#160;C&#8211;C bond formations that tolerate N&#8208;heterocycles are valuable since these moieties are common motifs in numerous chiral bioactive compounds. Such transformations are, however, challenging since N&#8208;heterocyclic moieties can interfere with the catalytic reaction. Here, we present a peptide that catalyzes conjugate addition reactions between aldehydes and&#160;nitroolefins bearing a broad range of different N&#8208;heterocyclic moieties with basic and/or H&#8208;bonding sites&#160;in excellent yields and stereoselectivities. Tuning of the pyramidalization direction of the enamine intermediate enabled the high stereoselectivity.</dc:description>

      <title>Highly tough, stretchable, self&#8208;adhesive and strain&#8208;Sensitive DNA&#8208;inspired hydrogels for human motions monitoring</title>
      <dc:description>The hydrogel as strain sensor often relies on assistant splicing tapes to attach on surfaces, which causes much inconvenience. Therefore, to develop the strain sensor hydrogels that possess both good mechanical properties and self&#8208;adhesion is still a great challenge. Herein, inspired by the multiple hydrogen bonding interactions of nucleobases in DNA, we designed and synthesized a series of hydrogels PAAm&#8208;GO&#8208;Aba/Tba/Aba+Tba comprised of poly acrylamide (PAAm), graphene oxide (GO), acrylated adenine and thymine (Aba and Tba). The introduction of nucleobases facilitates hydrogels to adhere to various substrates through the multiple hydrogen bonding interactions. And it has been found that the adhesive strength of hydrogels with nucleobases for hogskin increased to be 2.5&#8208;fold than that of those without nucleobases. Meanwhile, these hydrogels exhibited good dynamic mechanical and self&#8208;recovery properties. The hydrogels can be directly attached on human skin as strain sensors to monitor the motions of finger, wrist and elbow. The electrical tests indicate that they give precise real&#8208;time monitoring data and exhibit good strain sensitivity and electrical stability. This work provides a promising exploration to fabricate tough, self&#8208;adhesive and strain&#8208;sensitive hydrogels as strain sensors for the applications in wearable devices and healthcare monitoring.</dc:description>

The electrical tests indicate that they give precise real&#8208;time monitoring data and exhibit good strain sensitivity and electrical stability. This work provides a promising exploration to fabricate tough, self&#8208;adhesive and strain&#8208;sensitive hydrogels as strain sensors for the applications in wearable devices and healthcare monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Hexagonal La2O3 nanocrystals chemically coupled with nitrogen&#8208;doped porous carbon as efficient catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction</title>
      <dc:description>The construction of nano&#8208;scale hybrid materials with a smart interfacial structure, established by rare earth oxide and carbon as building blocks, is essential for the development of economical and efficient catalysts for oxygen reduction reactions (ORR). In this work, hexagonal La  2  O  3  nanocrystals on a nitrogen&#8208;doped porous carbon (NPC) derived from crop radish, served as building bricks, are prepared by chemical precipitation and then calcination at elevated temperatures. The obtained La  2  O  3  /NPC hybrid exhibits a very high ORR activity with a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.90 V, exceeding that of commercial Pt/C (0.83 V). Both DFT theoretical and experimental results have verified that the significantly enhanced catalytic performance is ascribed to the formation of the C&#8208;O&#8208;La covalent bonds between carbon and La  2  O  3  . Through the covalent bonds, electrons can transfer from the carbon to La  2  O  3  and occupy the unfilled e  g  orbital of La  2  O  3  phase. It results in the accelerated adsorption of active oxygen and the facilitated desorption of the surface hydroxides (OH  ad  &#8208;  ), thereby promoting the ORR over the catalyst.</dc:description>

      <title>Intermacrocyclic Interaction Upon Stepwise Oxidations in a Monometallic Porphyrin Dimer: Ring versus Metal&#8208;centre Oxidations and Effect of Counter Anions</title>
      <dc:description>The effect of intermacrocylic interaction was studied by controlled and step&#8208;wise oxidations of monometallic silver(II) porphyrin dimer that contains a highly flexible ethane bridge. Monometallic dimers are unique systems and behave differently from their dimetallic analog on the basis of their available sites for storing oxidizing equivalents. UV&#8208;visible,  1  H NMR, XPS and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies clearly suggest the removal of first electron from the metal centre. The removal of second electron occurred from the ring&#8208;center to form a &#960;&#8208;cation radical and, thereby, form a very unique mixed&#8208;valent species. However, unlike in all other ethane&#8208;bridged metalloporphyrin dimer reported earlier, the 2e&#8208;oxidized species showed quite unusual structures depending on the nature of counter ions. Ions like SbF  6  , SbCl  6  and PF  6  are engaged in strong interaction with porphyrin &#960;&#8208;cation radical and causes substantial structural change including large deformation of the ring. The solid state structure remains intact in solution also. The observations are further supported by the DFT calculations.</dc:description>

      <title>Phenol oxidation by a nickel(III)&#8208;fluoride complex: exploring the influence of the proton accepting ligand in PCET oxidation</title>
      <dc:description>In order to gain insight into the influence of the H  +  &#8208;accepting terminal ligand in high&#8208;valent oxidant mediated proton coupled electron transfer (PCET) reactions, the reactivity of a high valent nickel&#8208;fluoride complex [Ni  III  (F)(L)] (  2  , L = N,N&#8217;&#8208;(2,6&#8208;dimethylphenyl)&#8208;2,6&#8208;pyridinecarboxamidate) with substituted phenols was explored. Analysis of kinetic data from these reactions (Evans&#8208;Polanyi, Hammett, and Marcus plots, and KIE measurements) and the formed products show that  2  reacted with electron rich phenols through a hydrogen atom transfer (HAT, or concerted PCET) mechanism and with electron poor phenols via a stepwise PT/ET reaction mechanism. The analogous complexes [Ni  III  (Z)(L)] (Z = Cl, OCO  2  H, O  2  CCH  3  , ONO  2  ) reacted with all phenols through a HAT mechanism. We explore the reason for a change in mechanism with the highly basic fluoride ligand in  2. 2  was also found to react one to two orders magnitude faster than the corresponding analogous [Ni  III  (Z)(L)] complexes. This was ascribed to a high bond dissociation free energy value associated with H&#8211;F (135 kcal/mol), which is the product formed from PCET oxidation by  2  and is believed to be the driving force for the reaction. Our findings show that high&#8208;valent metal&#8208;fluoride complexes represent a class of highly reactive PCET oxidants.</dc:description>

      <title>Cocrystals &#8220;divorce and marriage&#8221;: when a binary system meets an active multifunctional synthon in a ball mill.</title>
      <dc:description>A well&#8208;defined and stable &#8220;AB&#8221; binary system in the presence of &#8220;C&#8221; crystalline synthon ground in a ball mill undergoes selective transformation in the solid state according to the equation AB + C &#8594; AC + B. When the amount of C is increased two times then AB + 2C &#8594; AC + BC equation is valid. The other variants are more complex. The pathway BC + A is allowed and leads to the AC and B products. The pathway AC + B is not preferred and a transformation was not observed. These non&#8208;obvious correlations were observed for cocrystal of barbituric acid (BA):thiobarbituric acid (TBA) recently reported by Shemchuk et al.  ( Chem. Commun.,  2016  , 52  , 11815&#8211;11818) in the presence of 1&#8208; H  ydroxy&#8208;4,5&#8208;Dimethyl&#8208; Im  idazole 3&#8208; O  xide (HIMO). Single&#8208;quantum, Double&#8208;quantum (SQ&#8208;DQ) two dimensional (2D) 1  H Very Fast MAS NMR technique with a spinning rate of 60 kHz was employed as a basic and most diagnostic tool for the study of cocrystals transformations. The analysis of the experimental data was supported by theoretical calculations. Two mechanisms of synthon replacement have been proposed.</dc:description>

When the amount of C is increased two times then AB + 2C &#8594; AC + BC equation is valid. The other variants are more complex. The pathway BC + A is allowed and leads to the AC and B products. The pathway AC + B is not preferred and a transformation was not observed. These non&#8208;obvious correlations were observed for cocrystal of barbituric acid (BA):thiobarbituric acid (TBA) recently reported by Shemchuk et al.  ( Chem. Commun.,  2016  , 52  , 11815&#8211;11818) in the presence of 1&#8208; H  ydroxy&#8208;4,5&#8208;Dimethyl&#8208; Im  idazole 3&#8208; O  xide (HIMO). Single&#8208;quantum, Double&#8208;quantum (SQ&#8208;DQ) two dimensional (2D) 1  H Very Fast MAS NMR technique with a spinning rate of 60 kHz was employed as a basic and most diagnostic tool for the study of cocrystals transformations. The analysis of the experimental data was supported by theoretical calculations. Two mechanisms of synthon replacement have been proposed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

New topology of polyoxovanadates: A rare example of lacunary Keggin&#8208;type vanadoselenite [SeV10O28(SeO3)3]8&#8722; ({Se4V10}) was readily obtained, which shows sufficient reactivity with divalent transition metals (TMs) to form a new series of TM&#8208;sandwiched complexes {(Se4V10)2M} (M=Mn, Co, Zn).

      <dc:description>
Organic electrosynthesis guides the way to alkyl arylsulfonates! In an electrochemical multi&#8208;component reaction, an alcohol of choice, an electron&#8208;rich arene, and SO2 are converted to alkyl arylsulfonates. This novel methodology features the first direct synthesis of alkyl arylsulfonates from arenes at mild reaction conditions. No prefunctionalization is required and no DABSO is needed. The in&#8208;situ formation of monoalkyl sulfites omits the use of supporting electrolytes. BDD electrodes are employed in an HFIP/acetonitrile solvent mixture.

      <title>Anthranoxides as Highly Reactive Arynophiles for the Synthesis of Triptycenes</title>
      <dc:description>
An efficient method to synthesize triptycenes through the reaction of benzynes and anthranoxides, which are electron&#8208;rich and readily prepared from the corresponding anthrones, is reported. Using this method, 1,9&#8208;syn&#8208;substituted triptycenes were regioselectively obtained employing 3&#8208;methoxybenzynes. This method was also applied to synthesize pentiptycenes. A DFT study revealed that the cycloaddition of lithium anthranoxide and benzyne proceeds stepwise. More information can be found in the Communication by T. Iwata, M. Shindo, et&#8197;al.

Formation of one of the final dications is accompanied by an inclusion of a complex anion within the cavity yielding a pseudorotaxane&#8208;like complex. Multiple conformational transformations of the macrocycle remind the movement of a rollercoaster along a complex track constructed of loops and turns, providing the expanded carbaporphyrinoid amusement park.

Abstract
Carbon&#8208;layer&#8208;coated porous Ni&#8208;doped CoSe2 (Ni&#8208;CoSe2/C) nanospheres have been fabricated by a facile hydrothermal method followed by a new selenization strategy. The porous structure of Ni&#8208;CoSe2/C is formed by the aggregation of many small particles (20&#8211;40&#8197;nm), which are not tightly packed together, but are interspersed with gaps. Moreover, the surfaces of these small particles are covered with a thin carbon layer. Ni&#8208;CoSe2/C delivers superior rate performance (314.0&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 20&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1), ultra&#8208;long cycle life (316.1&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 8000&#8197;cycles), and excellent full&#8208;cell performance (208.3&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 70&#8197;cycles) when used as an anode material for half/full sodium&#8208;ion batteries. The Na storage mechanism and kinetics have been confirmed by ex situ X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis, assessment of capacitance performance, and a galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT). GITT shows that Na+ diffusion in the electrode material is a dynamic change process, which is associated with a phase transition during charge and discharge. The excellent electrochemical performance suggests that the porous Ni&#8208;CoSe2/C nanospheres have great potential to serve as an electrode material for sodium&#8208;ion batteries.

      <title>Tuning the Triplet Excited State of Bis(dipyrrin) Zinc(II) Complexes: Symmetry Breaking Charge Transfer Architecture with Exceptionally Long Lived Triplet State for Upconversion</title>
      <dc:description>Zinc(II) bis(dipyrrin) complexes, which feature intense visible absorption and efficient symmetry breaking charge transfer (SBCT) are outstanding candidates for photovoltaics but their short lived triplet states limit applications in several areas. Herein we demonstrate that triplet excited state dynamics of bis(dipyrrin) complexes can be efficiently tuned by attaching electron donating aryl moieties at the 5,5'&#8208;position of the complexes. For the first time, a long lived triplet excited state (&#964; T = 296 &#181;s) along with efficient ISC ability (&#934; &#8710; = 71%) was observed for zinc(II) bis(dipyrrin) complexes, formed via SBCT process. The results revealed that molecular geometry and energy gap between CT state and triplet energy levels strongly controls the triplet excited state properties of the complexes. An efficient triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation upconversion system was devised for the first time using SBCT architecture as triplet photosensitizer, reaching a high upconversion quantum yield of 6.2%. Our findings provide a blueprint for the development of triplet photosensitizers based on earth abundant metal complexes with long lived triplet state for revolutionary photochemical applications.</dc:description>

      <title>Total Synthesis and Antimycobacterial Activity of Ohmyungsamycin A, Deoxyecumicin, and Ecumicin</title>
      <dc:description>The ohmyungsamycin and ecumicin natural product families are structurally related cyclic depsipeptides that display potent antimycobacterial activity. Herein the total synthesis of ohmyungsamycin A, deoxyecumicin, and ecumicin are reported, together with the first direct biological comparison of members of these natural product families against  Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb)  , the etiological agent of tuberculosis (TB). The synthesis of each of the natural products employed a solid&#8208;phase strategy to assemble the linear peptide precursor, involving a key on&#8208;resin esterification and an optional on&#8208;resin dimethylation step, before a final solution&#8208;phase macrolactamization between the non&#8208;proteinogenic  N  &#8208;methyl&#8208;4&#8208;methoxy&#8208;l&#8208;tryptophan amino acid and a bulky  N  &#8208;methyl&#8208;l&#8208;valine residue. The synthetic natural products possessed potent antimycobacterial activity against  Mtb  with MIC  90  &#8217;s ranging from 110&#8208;360 nM and retained activity against  Mtb  in  Mtb  &#8208;infected macrophages. Deoxyecumicin also exhibited rapid bactericidal killing against  Mtb  , sterilizing cultures after 21 days.</dc:description>

      <dc:description>Design and construction of &#8216;thermodynamically stable&#8217; MOFs surviving in liquid water, boiling water, acidic/basic solutions over a wide pH range is highly desirable for many practical applications especially adsorption based gas separations with obvious scalable preparations.

As an alternate to cost intensive cryogenic high pressure distillation process for the separation of hydrocarbons, recently MOFs have shown the promise of such separation. Thus, towards application standpoint, this MOF exhibits relatively higher uptake of C  2  s hydrocarbons over the C  1  hydrocarbon at ambient conditions with one of the highest selectivities based on IAST method. Combination of two strategies (presence of stronger metal&#8208;N coordination on the spacer and the hydrophobicity on the aromatic moiety of the organic ligand) possibly makes the framework highly robust even stable in boiling water and over a wide range of pH 2&#8208;10 and representing the first example of &#8216;thermodynamically stable&#8217; MOF displaying 2D structural network. Moreover, this material is easily scalable by refluxing the reaction mixture overnight.

      <title>Synthesis of a Molecule with Five Different Adjacent Pnictogens</title>
      <dc:description>
Power of 5! A molecular compound with all five pnictogen atoms and exclusively tertiary butyl substituents was obtained by a planned multi&#8208;step synthesis (see figure).







Abstract
The first molecular compound with all five pnictogens was obtained by a multi&#8208;step reaction. Lithiation of the (bisamido)diazadiarsetidine (tBuNAs)2(tBuNH)2 in aliphatic solvents leads to the dimeric metallated species [(tBuNAs)2(tBuNLi)2]2 (12). Upon reactions with AsCl3, SbCl3 and BiCl3 the polycyclic compounds [(tBuNAs)2(tBuN)2]PnCl (Pn=As (2), Sb (3), Bi (4)) can be obtained. Conversion of 2&#8211;4 with [tBu2SbP(tBu)Li(OEt2)]2 leads to the remarkable interpnictogens [(tBuNAs)2(tBuN)2]PnP(tBu)SbtBu2 (Pn=As (5), Sb (6), Bi (7)), whereby 7 is the first example of a molecule containing all five Group&#8197;15 elements. The compound with adjacent AsNBiPSb&#8208;chains is surprisingly stable and does not show high sensibility against light as the labile Bi&#8722;P bond might suggest.

      <title>JoyaPhos: An Atropisomeric Teraryl Monophosphine Ligand</title>
      <dc:description>
JoyaPhos: A new atropisomeric monophosphine (JoyaPhos) was prepared by the sequential de novo introduction of aromatic units, resulting in a configurationally stable teraryl structure with a well&#8208;defined topology. The ligand scaffold differs from canonical binaphthyl structures and can accommodate transition metals in a dense ligand sphere, suitable for stereoselective transformations.







Abstract
A topologically well&#8208;defined atropisomeric teraryl monophosphine ligand system, prepared by a highly stereoselective arene&#8208;forming aldol condensation combined with a direct ester&#8208;to&#8208;anthracene transformation, is described herein. The ligands were evaluated for gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed [2+2] cycloaddition and cycloisomerization reactions as well as a unique intramolecular Pd&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;N cross&#8208;coupling for the atroposelective synthesis of a N&#8208;aryl&#8208;indoline bearing a C&#8722;N stereogenic axis. The ligand structure induced up to 95:5 stereoselectivity in the asymmetric allylic alkylation reaction and features an interesting dynamic behavior as observed by X&#8208;ray crystallographic studies.

      <title>PAINT&#8208;ing Fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc)&#8208;Diphenylalanine Hydrogels</title>
      <dc:description>
Key aspects of hydrogels like fiber diameter, network morphology and mesh size are sub&#8208;diffraction limited features and cannot be visualized effectively using confocal microscopy. In this work, we show that it is possible to image fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl&#8208;protected diphenylalanine (FmocFF) hydrogels by points accumulation for imaging in nanoscale topography (PAINT) in native conditions and without direct gel labelling (see figure).







Abstract
Self&#8208;assembly of fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl&#8208;protected diphenylalanine (FmocFF) in water is widely known to produce hydrogels. Typically, confocal microscopy is used to visualize such hydrogels under wet conditions, that is, without freezing or drying. However, key aspects of hydrogels like fiber diameter, network morphology and mesh size are sub&#8208;diffraction limited features and cannot be visualized effectively using this approach. In this work, we show that it is possible to image FmocFF hydrogels by Points Accumulation for Imaging in Nanoscale Topography (PAINT) in native conditions and without direct gel labelling. We demonstrate that the fiber network can be visualized with improved resolution (&#8776;50&#8197;nm) both in 2D and 3D. Quantitative information is extracted such as mesh size and fiber diameter. This method can complement the existing characterization tools for hydrogels and provide useful information supporting the design of new materials.

      <title>Dynamic Coordination Chemistry of Fluorinated Zr&#8208;MOFs: Synthetic Control and Reassembly/Disassembly beyond de novo Synthesis to Tune the Structure and Property</title>
      <dc:description>
Zr4+ metal&#8208;organic frameworks (Zr&#8208;MOFs), known for excellent stability and functionality, meet the synthetic challenge in tuning the strength of a Zr&#8722;Ocarboxylate linkage. This work explores the unusual coordination dynamics of a family of fluorinated Zr&#8208;MOFs. The low&#8208;connecting kinetic Zr&#8208;MOFs possess dynamic behavior, thus opening a post&#8208;synthetic pathway to sequential reassembly/disassembly. The factors, such as ligand geometry, etc., have been studied. Their stability, hydrophobicity and gas adsorption/separation properties are explored. More information can be found in the Full Paper by Z.&#8208;W. Wei, G. Maurin, C.&#8208;Y. Su, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202001052).

Garlic, Allium Sativum, is native to Central Asia and is grown in China in extraordinary amounts, accounting for 80&#8201;% of the world's total production. Famous for its pungent odor and characteristic flavor, beneath its cloves are natural products with well&#8208;known biological properties. There is still a distinct lack of reported total syntheses of its low molecular weight natural products, which are volatile and contain reactive moieties such as disulfides. In this work, the second chemical total synthesis of ajoene, an anti&#8208;thrombotic agent, was developed in batch mode. Flow chemistry has also been developed to enable the synthesis of a novel sulfide without purification steps. More information can be found in the Communication by T. Wirth et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202001598).

      <title>A Fast, Low&#8208;Temperature Synthesis Method for Hexagonal YMnO3: Kinetics, Purity, Size and Shape as Studied by In Situ X&#8208;Ray Diffraction</title>
      <dc:description>
A hydrothermal reaction taking place in a capillary while being monitored using in situ X&#8208;ray diffraction from a synchrotron source is depicted in the cover image. The capillary is locally heated from above, while being penetrated by X&#8208;rays, which are diffracted in cone&#8208;like patterns by the powder within. The zoom on the capillary shows the evolution of crystal structures as hexagonal YMnO3 is formed from Mn2O3 and Y2O3 in hydroxide solution. More information can be found in the Full Paper by M.&#8208;A. Einarsrud et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202000528).
