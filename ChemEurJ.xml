         <title>Homochiral and Heterochiral Self&#8208;Sorting Assemblies of Antiaromatic Ni(II) Norcorrole Dimers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently, &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacked antiaromatic &#960;&#8208;systems have received considerable attention because they&#160;can exhibit stacked&#8208;ring aromaticity&#160;due to&#160;substantial intermolecular orbital interactions. Here, we report three antiaromatic norcorrole dimers that self&#8208;assemble to form supramolecular architectures through chiral self&#8208;sorting. A&#160;2,2&#8217;&#8208;linked norcorrole dimer&#160;with 3,5&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphenyl groups forms a&#160;&#960;&#8208;stacked dimer both in solid and solution states&#160;via homochiral self&#8208;sorting. Its association constant in solution is&#160;(3.6 &#177; 1.7) &#215; 105&#160;M&#8211;1&#160;at 20 &#176;C. In the solid state,&#160;3,3&#8217;&#8208;linked norcorrole dimers&#160;with 3,5&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphenyl and phenyl groups afford macrocyclic and helical supramolecular assemblies via heterochiral and homochiral self&#8208;sorting, respectively. Notably, the subtle modification in the substituent resulted in a complete change in the structure of the aggregates and the chiral self&#8208;sorting mode. The present findings demonstrate that structural manipulation in antiaromatic monomer units leads to the formation of various supramolecular assemblies on the basis of the attractive interactions between antiaromatic&#160;&#960;&#8208;systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Fabrication of Fe/KB composite as sulfur host for Li&#8208;S battery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium sulfur battery is a novel kind of secondary battery which has high energy density, however its application is greatly affected by the shuttle effect of polysulfides generated in the redox reaction of cathode electrode. Metal active sites are supposed as effective catalysts which can absorb and accelerate the conversion efficiency of&#160;lithium polysulfides, thus the shuttle effect will be alleviated. In this work, we conducted a simple way to prepare a metal Fe doped ketjen black to serve as the sulfur host of lithium sulfur battery. Ketjen black has a large specific surface area and rich porous structure, while Fe nanodot is an excellent catalyst for lithium polysulfides. Because of these advantages, the Fe/KB host can effectively confine a large amount of active material and accelerate its, therefore the Fe/KB&#8208;S cathode electrode show an excellent electrochemical performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Protecting&#8208;Group&#8208;Free&#160;Synthesis of ADP&#8208;Ribose and Dinucleoside Di&#8208;/Triphosphate Derivatives&#160;via&#160;P(V)&#8211;P(V) Coupling Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biomolecules containing adenosine di&#8208; or triphosphate (ADP or ATP) are crucial for diverse biological processes. Synthesis of these biomolecules and development of their chemical probes are important to elucidate their functions. Enabling reproducible and high&#8208;yielding access to these ADP&#8208; and ATP&#8208;containing molecules via conventional P(III)&#8211;P(V) and P(V)&#8211;P(V) coupling reactions is challenging owing to water content in highly polar phosphate&#8208;containing substrates. Herein, we report an efficient and reliable method for protecting&#8208;group&#8208;free P(V)&#8211;P(V) coupling reaction through in situ activation of phosphates using hydrolysis&#8208;stable 2&#8208;[N&#8208;(2&#8208;methylimidazoyl)]&#8208;1,3&#8208;dimethylimidazolinium chloride (2&#8208;MeImIm&#8208;Cl), providing the corresponding electrophilic P(V) intermediates for subsequent nucleophilic attack using their coupling partners. This P(V)&#8211;P(V) coupling reaction proceeded even in a wet reaction medium and showed a broad substrate scope, accommodating protecting&#8208;group&#8208;free synthesis of ADP&#8208;ribose&#160;and nicotinamide adenine diphosphate&#160;analogs, ATP&#8208;containing biomolecules, and ADP&#8208;ribosyl peptides.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Styrylbenzazole Photoswitches and Evaluation of their Photochemical Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Styrylbenzazoles form a promising yet under&#8208;represented class of photoswitches that can perform a light&#8208;driven E&#8208;Z isomerization of the central alkene double bond without undergoing irreversible photocyclization, typical of the parent stilbene. In this work, we report the synthesis and photochemical study of 23 styrylbenzazole photoswitches. Their thermal stabilities, quantum yields, maximum absorption wavelengths and photostationary state (PSS) distributions can be tuned by changing the benzazole heterocycle and the substitution pattern on the aryl ring. In particular, we found that push&#8208;pull systems show large redshifts of the maximum absorption wavelengths and the highest quantum yields, whereas ortho&#8208;substituted styrylbenzazole photoswitches exhibit the most favorable PSS ratios. Taking advantage of both design principles, we produced 2,6&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;4&#8208;(dimethylamino)&#8208;styrylbenzothiazole, a thermally stable and efficient P&#8208;type photoswitch which displays negative photochromism upon irradiation with visible light up to 470 nm to obtain a near&#8208;quantitative isomerization with a very high quantum yield of 59%. Furthermore, 4&#8208;hydroxystyrylbenzothiazole was demonstrated to be a pH&#8208;sensitive switch which exhibits a 100 nm redshift upon deprotonation. Ortho&#8208;methylation of this switch improved the obtained PSS ratio in its deprotonated state from E:Z=53:47 to E:Z=18:82. We anticipate that this relatively unexplored class of photoswitches will form a valuable expansion of the current family of photoswitches.</dc:description>

         <title>Thio and Seleno&#8208; Psoralens as Efficient Triplet Harvesting Photosensitizers For Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Psoralen (Pso) molecule finds extensive applications in photo&#8208;chemotherapy, courtesy of its triplet state forming ability. Sulfur and selenium replacement of exocyclic carbonyl oxygen of organic chromophores foster efficient triplet harvesting with near unity triplet quantum yield. These triplet&#8208;forming photosensitizers are useful in Photodynamic Therapy (PDT) applications for selective apoptosis of cancer cells. In this work, we have critically assessed the effect of the sulfur and selenium substitution at the exocyclic carbonyl (TPso and SePso, respectively) and endocyclic oxygen positions of Psoralen. It resulted in a significant redshifted absorption spectrum to access the PDT therapeutic window with increased oscillator strength. The reduction in singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap and enhancement in the spin&#8208;orbit coupling values increase the number of intersystem crossing (ISC) pathways to the triplet manifold, which shortens the ISC lifetime from 10&#8208;5 s for Pso to 10&#8208;8 s for TPso and 10&#8208;9 s for SePso. The intramolecular photo&#8208;induced electron transfer process, a competitive pathway to ISC, is also considerably curbed by these exocyclic functionalizations. In addition, a maximum of 115 GM of two&#8208;photon absorption (2PA) with IR absorption (660&#8208;1050 nm) confirms that the Psoralen skeleton can be effectively tweaked via single chalcogen atom replacement to design a suitable PDT photosensitizer.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The synthesis of phosphine acetylide amidinate stabilized copper(I) and gold(I) heterobimetallic complexes was achieved by reacting ligand [{Ph2PC&#8801;CC(NDipp)2}Li(thf)3] (Dipp = N,N&#8217;&#8208;diisopropylphenyl) with CuCl and Au(tht))Cl, yielding the eight membered ring [{Ph2PC&#8801;CC(NDipp)2}2Cu2] and the twelve membered ring [{Ph2PC&#8801;CC(NDipp)2}2Au2]. {Ph2PC&#8801;CC(NDipp)2}2Cu2] features a Cu2 unit, which is bridged by two amidinate ligands, served as a metalloligand to synthesize the heterobimetallic CuI/AuI complexes [{(AuX)Ph2PC&#8801;CC(NDipp)2}2Cu2] (X = Cl, C6F5). In these reactions the central ring structure is retained. In contrast, when the twelve membered ring [{Ph2PC&#8801;CC(NDipp)2}2Au2] was reacted with CuX (X = Cl, Br, I and Mes), the reaction led to rearrangement of the central ring structure to give [{(AuX)Ph2PC&#8801;CC(NDipp)2}2Cu2] (X = Cl, Br, I and Mes), which feature the same the eight membered Cu2 ring as above. These compounds were also synthesized by a one&#8208;pot reaction. The luminescent heterobimetallic complexes were further investigated for their photophysical properties.</dc:description>

Using solid state molecular structures, photophysical data, cyclic voltammetry, DFT and LR&#8208;TDDFT calculations, we compare o&#8208;carborane and B(mes)2 (mes = 2,4,6&#8208;Me3C6H2) as acceptor groups. Whereas the &#960;&#8208;acceptor strength of B(mes)2 is sufficient to drop the pyrene LUMO+1 below the LUMO, the carborane does not do this. We confirm the &#960;&#8208;donor strength of the julolidine&#8208;like moiety, however, which raises the pyrene HOMO&#8208;1 above the HOMO.

         <title>Activation of SO2F2 at a Rhodium PNP Pincer Complex: Ligand Supported S&#8208;F Bond Cleavage to Generate NSO2F Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The &#954;2&#8208;(P,N)&#8208;phosphine ligand precursor NH(CH2CH2PCy2)2 can be used for the synthesis of the rhodium(I) complex [Rh(CO){&#312;3&#8208;(P,N,P)&#8208;Cy2PC2H4NHC2H4PCy2}][Cl] (1). The deprotonated complex [Rh(CO){&#312;3&#8208;(P,N,P)&#8208;Cy2PC2H4NC2H4PCy2}] (2) shows a cooperative reactivity of the PNP ligand in the activation reaction of SO2F2 to yield the rhodium fluorido complex trans&#8208;[Rh(F)(CO){&#312;2&#8208;(P,P)&#8208;Cy2PC2H4N(SO2F)C2H4PCy2}]2 (3) by S&#8208;F bond cleavage. It is remarkable that no reaction was observed when 3 was treated with hydrogen sources e.g. dihydrogen, organosilicon compounds such as triethylsilane or TMS&#8208;CF3 and different fluorine sources such as SF4 or Selectfluor&#174;. However, the treatment of complex 3 with XeF2 in the presence of CsF resulted in the formation of the unique fluorido rhodium(III) complex cis,trans&#8208;[Rh(F)3(CO){&#312;2&#8208;(P,P)&#8208;Cy2PC2H4N(SO2F)C2H4PCy2}]2 (4).

         <title>Variation in Catalytic Efficacies of a 2D pH&#8208;Stable MOF by Altering Activation Methods</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chemically robust 2D MOF, IITKGP&#8208;60, has been strategically designed and developed, which showed excellent catalytic activity in three&#8208;component Strecker reaction and Knoevenagel condensation reaction under solvent&#8208;free condition. The significant effect of activation methods on its catalytic performances is specifically highlighted.







Abstract
Although it is well&#8208;known that the Lewis acidity of Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks (MOFs) can effectively enhance their catalytic activity in organic transformations, access to these Lewis&#8208;acidic sites remains a key hurdle to widespread applications of Lewis&#8208;acidic catalysis by MOFs. Easy accessibility of strong Lewis acidic sites onto 2D MOFs by using proper activation methods can be a cornerstone in attaining desired catalytic performance. Herein, we report a new 2D chemically stable MOF, IITKGP&#8208;60, which displayed excellent framework robustness over a wide pH range (2&#8211;12). Benefiting from the abundant open metal sites (OMSs) and framework robustness, the catalytic activity of the developed material was explored in one&#8208;pot three&#8208;component Strecker reaction and Knoevenagel condensation reaction. Moreover, the developed catalyst is superior in catalyzing the reactions involving sterically hindered substrate (1&#8208;naphthaldehyde) with high turnover number. A comparative catalytic study was conducted using different activation methods (chloroform and methanol exchanged activated samples), highlighting the significant effect of activation methods on its catalytic performances. The sustainable synthetic pathway under solvent&#8208;free conditions for a broad scope of substrates using low catalyst loading and excellent recyclability made the developed pH&#8208;stable framework a promising heterogeneous catalyst.

         <title>Investigation of Isolated IrF5&#8722;, IrF6&#8722; Anions and M[IrF6] (M=Na, K, Rb, Cs) Ion Pairs by Matrix&#8208;Isolation Spectroscopy and Relativistic Quantum&#8208;Chemical Calculations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The IR spectra of molecular IrF5&#8722;, IrF6&#8722; anions and M[IrF6] (M=Na, K, Rb, Cs) ion pairs isolated in rare&#8208;gas matrices are presented. The closed&#8208;shell IrF6&#8722; anion with Oh symmetry stabilized by SOC effects has been verified spectroscopically in the low&#8208;temperature matrices. The M[IrF6] ion pairs with C3v symmetry feature coordination of an alkali metal ion to three F atoms.







Abstract
The molecular IrF5&#8722;, IrF6&#8722; anions and M[IrF6] (M=Na, K, Rb, Cs) ion pairs were prepared by co&#8208;deposition of laser&#8208;ablated alkali metal fluorides MF with IrF6 and isolated in solid neon or argon matrices under cryogenic conditions. The free anions were obtained as well by co&#8208;deposition of IrF6 with laser&#8208;ablated metals (Ir or Pt) as electron sources. The products were characterized in a combined analysis of matrix IR spectroscopy and electronic structure calculations using two&#8208;component quasi&#8208;relativistic DFT methods accounting for spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC) effects as well as multi&#8208;reference configuration&#8208;interaction (MRCI) approaches with SOC. Inclusion of SOC is crucial in the prediction of spectra and properties of IrF6&#8722; and its alkali&#8208;metal ion pairs. The observed IR bands and the computations show that the IrF6&#8722; anion adopts an Oh structure in a nondegenerate ground state stabilized by SOC effects, and not a distorted D4h structure in a triplet ground state as suggested by scalar&#8208;relativistic calculations. The corresponding &#8220;closed&#8208;shell&#8221; M[IrF6] ion pairs with C3v symmetry are stabilized by coordination of an alkali metal ion to three F atoms, and their structural change in the series from M=Na to Cs was proven spectroscopically. There is no evidence for the formation of IrF7, IrF7&#8722; or M[IrF7] (M=Na, K, Rb, Cs) ion pairs in our experiments.

&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and its alkali-metal ion pairs. The observed IR bands and the computations show that the IrF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; anion adopts an &lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; structure in a nondegenerate ground state stabilized by SOC effects, and not a distorted &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;4h&lt;/sub&gt; structure in a triplet ground state as suggested by scalar-relativistic calculations. The corresponding &#8220;closed-shell&#8221; M[IrF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;] ion pairs with &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;3v&lt;/sub&gt; symmetry are stabilized by coordination of an alkali metal ion to three F atoms, and their structural change in the series from M=Na to Cs was proven spectroscopically. There is no evidence for the formation of IrF&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;, IrF&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; or M[IrF&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;] (M=Na, K, Rb, Cs) ion pairs in our experiments.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Formation, Selective Encapsulation, and Tautomerization Control of Isoindolone Utilizing Guanidinium Sulfonate Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

Hydrogen bonding frameworks can do it all; catalysis, selective encapsulation, and control of tautomeric state.







Abstract
Herein we report the use of tetrakis (guanidinium) pyrenetetrasulfonate (G4PYR) and bis (guanidinium) 1,5&#8208;napthalene disulfonate (G2NDS) to catalyze the cyclization of 2&#8208;cyanobenzamide (1) to isoindolone (2). Moreover, we demonstrate the remarkable selectivity of these guanidinium organosulfonate hosts in encapsulating 2 over 1. By thoroughly investigating the intramolecular cyclization reaction, we determined that guanidinium and the organosulfonate moiety acts as the catalyst in this process. Additionally, 2 is selectively encapsulated, even in mixtures of other structurally similar heterocycles like indole. Furthermore, the tautomeric state of 2 (amino isoindolone (2&#8211;A) and imino isoindolinone forms (2&#8211;I)) can be controlled by utilizing different guanidinium organosulfonate frameworks.

         <title>Modular Construction of Vinylene&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks with Tunable Emission for Tumor Visualization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of isostructural vinylene&#8208;linked 2D COFs were constructed based on a new tetratopic D2h&#8208;symmetric monomer with two highly electron deficient s&#8208;triazine core. The fluorescence emission of the resulting D&#8722;A type COFs red&#8208;shifted with respect to the enhancement of the electronegativity of the donor unit. Their ability in non&#8208;invasive tumor visualization was further demonstrated.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with ordered &#960; structures are very promising in porous light&#8208;emitting materials. However, most of these COFs are either poor in luminescence or lack of water&#8208;stability. Herein, a series of isostructural D&#8722;A vinylene&#8208;linked COFs were constructed based a new D2h symmetric linker 1,4&#8208;bis(4,6&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)benzene (TMTA) with high crystallinity, comparative high surface area and excellent chemical/thermal stability. Impressively, their adsorption and luminescence wavelength vary with respect to the density of &#960;&#8208;systems in the electron&#8208;donating group, which constitute the foundation for molecular engineering the luminescent properties of vinylene&#8208;linked COFs. The DFT calculations further established the relationship between the luminescence properties and the donor electronic structure. Moreover, one of representative COF named FZU&#8208;203 showed inspiring applications in bioimaging, which may further provide strategic guidance for the use of vinylene&#8208;linked COFs as fluorescent nanoprobes in non&#8208;invasive medical diagnosis and visualization therapy of tumors.

         <title>Unspecific Peroxygenase (UPO) can be Tuned for Oxygenation or Halogenation Activity by Controlling the Reaction pH</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heme&#8208;dependent unspecific peroxygenases (UPOs) catalyze the selective oxygenation of organic molecules at pH&#8197;6.0 using hydrogen peroxide to form the oxidant Compound I at the active site. Compound I can also be recruited for the oxidation of halide ions in the presence of peroxide at pH&#8197;3.0 to generate hypohalous acid for halogenation reactions. Hence, the activity of UPOs towards a substrate such as thymol can be tuned to give oxygenated or halogenated products dependent upon the pH of the reaction.







Abstract
Unspecific Peroxygenases (UPOs) are increasingly significant enzymes for selective oxygenations as they are stable, highly active and catalyze their reactions at the expense of only hydrogen peroxide as the oxidant. Their structural similarity to chloroperoxidase (CPO) means that UPOs can also catalyze halogenation reactions based upon the generation of hypohalous acids from halide and H2O2. Here we show that the halogenation and oxygenation modes of a UPO can be stimulated at different pH values. Using simple aromatic compounds such as thymol, we show that, at a pH of 3.0 and 6.0, either brominated or oxygenated products respectively are produced. Preparative 100&#8197;mg scale transformations of substrates were performed with 60&#8211;72&#8201;% isolated yields of brominated products obtained. A one&#8208;pot bromination&#8208;oxygenation cascade reaction on 4&#8208;ethylanisole, in which the pH was adjusted from 3.0 to 6.0 at the halfway stage, yielded sequentially brominated and oxygenated products 1&#8208;(3&#8208;bromo&#8208;4&#8208;methoxyphenyl)ethyl alcohol and 3&#8208;bromo&#8208;4&#8208;methoxy acetophenone with 82&#8201;% combined conversion. These results identify UPOs as an unusual example of a biocatalyst that is tunable for entirely different chemical reactions, dependent upon the reaction conditions.

         <dc:description>
A lattice&#8208;matched NiO/NiFe2O4 heterophase hybrid catalyst with ample oxygen vacancies was reported via the heterogeneous interface and defect engineering strategy. The optimized geometry/electronic structure can effectively facilitate the mass transport and charge transfer process, thereby the as&#8208;prepared catalyst shows a favorable OER performance toward efficient water splitting and Zn&#8208;air batteries.







Abstract
Heterogeneous interface and defect engineering offer effective pathways to accelerate oxygen evolution reaction (OER) charge transfer kinetics and motivate optimal intrinsic catalytic activity. Herein, we report the lattice&#8208;matched NiO/NiFe2O4 heterostructure with ample oxygen vacancies (Vo&#8208;NiO/NiFe2O4) induced by a feasible hydrothermal followed by calcination and plasma&#8208;engraving assistant technique, which shows the unique porous microflower arrangement of intertwined nanosheets. Benefitting from the synergetic effects between lattice&#8208;matched heterointerface and oxygen vacancies induce the strong electronic coupling, optimized OH&#8722;/O2 diffusion pathway and ample active sites, thus&#8208;prepared Vo&#8208;NiO/NiFe2O4 presents a favorable OER performance with a low overpotential (261&#8197;mV @ 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and small Tafel slope (39.4&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1), even surpassing commercial RuO2 catalyst. Additionally, the two&#8208;electrode configuration water electrolyzer and rechargeable zinc&#8208;air battery assembled by Vo&#8208;NiO/NiFe2O4 catalyst show the potential practical application directions. This work provides an innovative avenue for strengthening OER performance toward water electrolysis and Zn&#8208;air batteries via the interface and vacancy engineering strategy.

         <title>Divergent Synthesis of Pyrazoles via Manganese Pincer Complex Catalyzed Acceptorless Dehydrogenative Coupling Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecularly defined Mn(I)&#8208;complex catalyzed acceptorless dehydrogenative coupling (ADC) reactions employing alcohols as the carbon source enabled the synthesis of multi&#8208;substituted pyrazoles. Symmetrical pyrazoles were made via the coupling of 1,3&#8208;diols with hydrazines. The unsymmetrically substituted pyrazoles were created using the ADC reaction of primary alcohols with hydrazones.







Abstract
This report detailed the synthesis of multi&#8208;substituted pyrazoles through the acceptorless dehydrogenative coupling (ADC) reaction catalyzed by a well&#8208;defined manganese(I)&#8208;pincer complex. Symmetrically substituted pyrazoles were synthesized by reacting 1,3&#8208;diols with hydrazines. Unsymmetrically substituted pyrazoles were selectively made via the ADC of primary alcohols with methyl hydrazones. Water and hydrogen are liberated as the green byproducts. The endurance of these methodologies has been presented by producing 30 substrates with varied functionalities. Model reactions were scaled up to demonstrate practicability. The reaction rate and order were measured to transparent the involvement of the reagents during catalysis. Control experiments elucidated the plausible reaction mechanisms.

         <title>Tetraanionic Oligo&#8208;Dioxaborines: Strongly Absorbing Near&#8208;Infrared Dyes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strongly absorbing NIR polymethines of tetraanionic nature bearing 1,3,2&#8208;dioxaborine rings and different electron&#8208;accepting end&#8208;groups were synthesized and characterized. Due to a highly symmetric electronic structure of tetraanionic chromophore, the obtained dyes possess exceptionally high molar absorption coefficients (exceeding half a million) and good fluorescence quantum yields (up to 0.13).







Abstract
Polymethine dyes of tetraanionic nature comprising 1,3,2&#8208;dioxaborine rings in the polymethine chain and end&#8208;groups of different electron&#8208;accepting abilities have been synthesized. They can be considered as oligomeric polymethines, where a linear conjugated &#960;&#8208;system passes through three 1,3,2&#8208;dioxaborine units and a number of tri&#8208; and dimethine &#960;&#8208;bridges between two end&#8208;groups. The obtained dyes exhibit near&#8208;infrared absorption and fluorescence, with molar absorption coefficients reaching as high as 564000&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1 in DMF, rendering them among the strongest absorbers known. The novel compounds are bright NIR fluorophores, with fluorescence quantum yields up to 0.13 in DMF. A comparative analysis of the electronic structure of the obtained dyes with respective dianionic and trianionic oligomers was conducted through quantum chemical calculations.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Intramolecular Hydrosilylation of Alkynes: Embracing Conventional and Electrochemical Routes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper presents a nickel&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular hydrosilylation of various aryl silanes containing a triple bond. The Ni(0) catalyst was generated through a simple reduction of the NiBr2bipy pre&#8208;catalyst using manganese metal or via electroreduction. In the latter case, the amount of electrons involved is catalytic, making the process highly manageable.







Abstract
Nickel&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular hydrosilylation can be efficiently achieved with high regio&#8208; and stereoselectivities through two distinct methodologies. The first approach utilizes a conventional method, involving the reduction of nickel salt (NiBr2&#8208;2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine) using manganese metal. The second method employs a one&#8208;step electrochemical reaction, utilizing the sacrificial anode process and NiBr2bipy catalysis. Both methods yield silylated heterocycles in good to high yields through a syn&#8208;exo&#8208;dig cyclization process. Control experiments and molecular electrochemistry (cyclic voltammetry) provided further insights into the reaction mechanism.

         <title>14&#8208;Membered Macrocyclic &#946;&#8208;Diiminato Gold(II) &#8211; A New Member for the Gold(II) Complex Family?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
One&#8208;electron reduction of the macrocyclic gold(III) complex yields an elusive transient gold(II) species as shown by experimental (cyclic voltammetry, UV/Vis, NMR, EPR spectroscopy) and quantum chemical methods (density functional theory).







Abstract
The chemistry of molecular gold compounds is dominated by the oxidation states +I and +III. For the intermediate oxidation state +II with 5d9 electron configuration, dimerization or disproportionation of the gold(II) radicals is favored, so that only a few mononuclear gold(II) complexes have been isolated to date. The present study addresses the one&#8208;electron reduction of the macrocyclic gold(III) complex [AuIIIL]+ of the innocent &#946;&#8208;diiminato ligand L2&#8722; with a 14&#8208;membered macrocycle (L2&#8722;=5,7,12,14&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;1,4,8,11&#8208;tetraazacyclotetradeca&#8208;5,7,12,14&#8208;tetraenato). Electrochemistry, spectroelectrochemistry and chemical reduction of [AuIIIL]+ monitored by UV/Vis, NMR and EPR spectroscopy together with density functional theory calculations reveal disproportionation of the initially generated but elusive gold(II) complex AuIIL and provide guidelines for prospective stable mononuclear tetraazamacrocyclic gold(II) complexes.

         <title>Polyaniline/Tungsten Trioxide Organic&#8208;Inorganic Hybrid Anode for Aqueous Proton Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The outstanding rate performance, stability and high capacity of aqueous proton batteries has attracted numerous attentions. We development a new aqueous proton battery system with organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid materials (WO3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H2O@PANI). Thus, it shows obviously improved electrochemical performance of high capacity and long cycle life. It can play a certain enlightening role in the research and development of electrode materials for aqueous proton batteries.







Abstract
Aqueous proton batteries have received increasing attention due to their outstanding rate performance, stability and high capacity. However, the selection of anode materials in strongly acidic electrolytes poses a challenge in achieving high&#8208;performance aqueous proton batteries. This study optimized the proton reaction kinetics of layered metal oxide WO3 by introducing interlayer structural water and coating polyaniline (PANI) on its surface to prepare organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid material (WO3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H2O@PANI). We constructed an aqueous proton battery with WO3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H2O@PANI anode and MnO2@GF cathode. After 1500 cycles at a current density of 10&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, the capacity retention rate can still reach 80.2&#8201;%. These results can inspire the development of new aqueous proton batteries.

         <dc:description>
2,5&#8208;Dimethyl&#8208;2,4&#8208;hexadiene is presented here as a suitable and selective reactant for delivering either prenyl or isobutylenyl groups to alkenes through a cross&#8208;metathesis reaction. The process smoothly operates at room temperature, give high yields of products, includes a late&#8208;stage transformation, and enables the valorization of real samples of recycled rubber.







Abstract
2,5&#8208;Dimethyl&#8208;2,4&#8208;hexadiene is a readily available and easily managable compound, whose symmetric and polymethylated dienic structure should be prone to engage in cross&#8208;metathesis reactions with other alkenes, but this has not been apparently exploited so far. Here we show that this reactant enables the easy synthesis of tri&#8208; and tetra&#8208;susbtituted alkenes (i.&#8201;e. isobutylenyl and prenyl groups) from simple alkenes under mild reaction conditions, not only with the conventional 2nd generation Grubbs catalyst but also with other Grela&#8208;type catalyts such as StickyCat,TM AquaMetTM and GreenCatTM. The use of liquid and low volatile 2,5&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2,4&#8208;hexadiene avoids the use of gaseous alkene reactants and, besides, showcases the reactivity of polyisoprene (rubber), thus allowing to optimize the reaction conditions for rubber upcycling, after metathesis reaction of the pristine or used polymer with simple alkenes. These results bring low volatile isoprene&#8208;type compounds as privileged poly&#8208;substituted reactants for alkene cross&#8208;metathesis reactions.

         <title>Generation and Identification of the Trifluorosilylarsinidene F3SiAs and Isomeric Perfluorinated Arsasilene FAsSiF2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel silylarsinidene F3SiAs and its isomer arsasilene FAsSiF2 are generated via the reactions of laser&#8208;ablated silicon atoms with AsF3 in low&#8208;temperature matrices and identified by matrix isolation IR spectroscopy as well as theoretical calculations. The isomerization of arsasilene FAsSiF2 to silylarsinidene F3SiAs under UV light (&#955; = 275&#8197;nm) was also observed.







Abstract
The trifluorosilylarsinidene F3SiAs in the triplet ground state has been generated through the reaction of laser&#8208;ablated silicon atoms with AsF3 in cryogenic Ne&#8208; and Ar&#8208;matrices. The reactions proceed with the initial formation of perfluorinated arsasilene FAsSiF2 in the singlet ground state by two As&#8722;F bonds insertion reaction on annealing. The trifluorosilylarsinidene F3SiAs was formed via F&#8208;migration reactions of FAsSiF2 under irradiation at UV light (&#955; = 275&#8197;nm). The characterization of FAsSiF2 and F3SiAs by IR matrix&#8208;isolation spectroscopy is supported by computations at CCSD(T)&#8208;F12/aug&#8208;cc&#8208;pVTZ and B3LYP/aug&#8208;cc&#8208;pVTZ levels of theory.

         <title>Reductions of Arenes using a Magnesium&#8208;Dinitrogen Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diene from a Birching. A magnesium&#8208;dinitrogen complex acts as a &#8220;masked&#8221; dimagnesium(I) diradical in reductions of an array of unfunctionalized and functionalized arenes. The former proceed via &#8220;Birch&#8208;type&#8221; reductions, while the latter typically result in reductive C&#8722;E (E=O, F or P) cleavage reactions.







Abstract
In this contribution, we present &#8220;Birch&#8208;type&#8221;, and other reductions of simple arenes by the potassium salt of an anionic magnesium dinitrogen complex, [{K(TCHPNON)Mg}2(&#956;&#8208;N2)] (TCHPNON=4,5&#8208;bis(2,4,6&#8208;tricyclohexylanilido)&#8208;2,7&#8208;diethyl&#8208;9,9&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;xanthene), which acts as a masked dimagnesium(I) diradical in these reactions. This reagent is non&#8208;hazardous, easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle, and in some cases provides access to 1,4&#8208;cyclohexadiene reduction products under relatively mild reaction conditions. This system works effectively to reduce benzene, naphthalene and anthracene through magnesium&#8208;bound &#8220;Birch&#8208;type&#8221; reduction intermediates. Cyclohexadiene products can be subsequently released from the magnesium centres by protonolysis with methanol. In contrast, the reduction of substituted arenes is less selective and involves competing reaction pathways. For toluene and 1,3,5&#8208;triphenylbenzene, the structural authentication of &#8220;Birch&#8208;type&#8221; reduction intermediates is conclusive, although the formation of corresponding 1,4&#8208;cyclohexadiene derivatives was low yielding. Reduction of anisole did not yield an isolable &#8220;Birch&#8208;type&#8221; intermediate, but instead gave a C&#8722;O activation product. Treating triphenylphosphine with [{K(TCHPNON)Mg}2(&#956;&#8208;N2)] resulted in the extrusion of both biphenyl and dinitrogen to afford a magnesium(II) phosphanide [{K(TCHPNON)Mg(&#956;&#8208;PPh2)}2]. Reduction of fluorobenzene proceeded via C&#8722;F activation of the arene, and isolation of the magnesium(II) fluoride [{K(TCHPNON)Mg(&#956;&#8208;F)}2]. Finally, the two&#8208;electron reduction of 1,3,5,7&#8208;cyclooctatetraene (COT) with [{K(TCHPNON)Mg}2(&#956;&#8208;N2)] yielded a complex, [{K(TCHPNON)Mg}2(&#956;&#8208;COT)], incorporating the aromatic dianion (COT2&#8722;).

Abstract
Some nanomaterials with intrinsic protease&#8208;like activity have the advantages of good stability, biosafety, low price, large&#8208;scale preparation and unique property of nanomaterials, which are promising alternatives for natural proteases in various applications. An especial term, &#8220;nanoprotease&#8221;, has been coined to stress the intrinsic proteolytic property of these nanomaterials. As a new generation of artificial proteases, they have become a burgeoning field, attracting many researchers to design and synthesize high performance nanoproteases. In this review, we summarize recent progress on all types of nanoproteases with regard of their activity, mechanism and application and introduce a new and effective strategy for engineering high&#8208;performance nanoproteases. In addition, we discuss the challenges and opportunities of nanoprotease research in the future.

         <title>Application of Sublimation in the Synthesis and Crystal Growth of Organosulfones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
1,6&#8208;trans&#8208;substituted bis(arylsulfone) trienes undergo aromatization and elimination of phenylsulfinic acid during sublimation leading to the growth of high quality, pure single crystals of the resulting (4&#8208;phenylsulfonyl)biphenyls in the desublimation area.







Abstract
The solvent&#8208;free elimination of sulfinic acid and aromatization of 1,6&#8208;trans&#8208;substituted bis(arylsulfone) trienes is reported. It is shown that sublimation can be used as a &#8216;green&#8217; method to combine the thermal transformation of six trienes and the crystal growth of the resulting 4&#8208;(phenylsulfonyl)biphenyls. When the sublimation conditions are carefully controlled, high quality single crystals of the 4&#8208;(phenylsulfonyl)biphenyls are obtained. Theoretical modelling of the reaction using the simplified triene Ph&#8208;(CH)6&#8208;SO2H showed that the cyclization is energetically feasible and that the complete conversion is possible during the timescale of the sublimation. At temperatures slightly higher than the optimum sublimation temperature two of the trienes transformed into 1,4&#8208;cyclohexadienes that did not eliminate phenylsulfinic acid. A reaction mechanism involving a 1,3&#8208;hydrogen shift induced by free PhS&#8226; radicals is proposed for the formation of the 1,4&#8208;cyclohexadienes.

&lt;p&gt;The solvent-free elimination of sulfinic acid and aromatization of 1,6-trans-substituted bis(arylsulfone) trienes is reported. It is shown that sublimation can be used as a &#8216;green&#8217; method to combine the thermal transformation of six trienes and the crystal growth of the resulting 4-(phenylsulfonyl)biphenyls. When the sublimation conditions are carefully controlled, high quality single crystals of the 4-(phenylsulfonyl)biphenyls are obtained. Theoretical modelling of the reaction using the simplified triene Ph-(CH)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;-SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H showed that the cyclization is energetically feasible and that the complete conversion is possible during the timescale of the sublimation. At temperatures slightly higher than the optimum sublimation temperature two of the trienes transformed into 1,4-cyclohexadienes that did not eliminate phenylsulfinic acid. A reaction mechanism involving a 1,3-hydrogen shift induced by free PhS&#8226; radicals is proposed for the formation of the 1,4-cyclohexadienes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis of 1,3&#8208;Dibromopyrene as Precursor of 1&#8208;, 3&#8208;, 6&#8208;, and 8&#8208;Substituted Long&#8208;Axially Symmetric Pyrene Derivatives</title>

         <dc:description>
Efficient synthesis of 1,3&#8208;dibromopyrene from 1&#8208;methoxypyrene was achieved with an overall yield of 71&#8201;%. This compound was successfully converted into 13OPA, a long&#8208;axially symmetric pyrene dye with electron donor&#8211;acceptor groups, which exhibits photophysical properties markedly distinct from those of its point&#8208;symmetric and short&#8208;axially symmetric isomers. These findings are valuable for the development of novel pyrene&#8208;based emitting materials.







Abstract
Pyrene derivatives bearing substituents at positions 1, 3, 6, and 8 find numerous applications, as exemplified by their use in lasers, sensors, and bioimaging probes. However, these derivatives typically have point&#8208;symmetric or short&#8208;axially symmetric structures, whereas long&#8208;axially symmetric derivatives remain underexplored because of the difficulty in obtaining their precursor, 1,3&#8208;dibromopyrene. To address this problem, we herein synthesized 1,3&#8208;dibromopyrene from 1&#8208;methoxypyrene in an overall yield (71&#8201;% over four steps) considerably exceeding those of existing methods. 1,3&#8208;Dibromopyrene was converted into 13OPA, a long&#8208;axially symmetric pyrene dye with electron&#8208;donor (alkoxy) groups at positions 1 and 3 and electron&#8208;acceptor (formyl) groups at positions 6 and 8. 13OPA exhibited photophysical properties distinct from those of its point&#8208;symmetric and short&#8208;axially symmetric isomers, featuring a broad and strongly redshifted absorption, strong fluorescence with reduced sensitivity to protic solvents, and small dipole moment change upon photoexcitation. The derivatization of 13OPA into a Schiff base and its functionalization via Lewis acid&#8208;base pairing were also demonstrated. Thus, our work expands the design scope of pyrene&#8208;based molecules, particularly those used as emitters.

         <dc:description>
Just as a station is the starting point of a journey and each person has their own destination, different shapes of complexes can be obtained starting from zinc (meth)acrylate. The recrystallization of zinc methacrylate from THF and water afforded a macrocyclic dodecanuclear complex, whereas that of zinc acrylate formed a sheet&#8208;like pentanuclear core with hydroxido ligands. The treatment of zinc (meth)acrylate with ZnO led to tetranuclear complex with oxido ligand. More information can be found in the Research Article by T. Iwasaki, K. Nozaki and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202400586).

         <dc:description>
The cover picture shows two polymorphs of a 2D PbII coordination polymer with Pb&#8722;S bonds. The thermodynamic product features a 2D architecture composed of quasi&#8208;2D (&#8722;Pb&#8722;S&#8722;)n layers with weak, nonbonded Pb&#8722;S bonds, whereas the kinetic product forms a 2D structure containing intrinsic 2D (&#8722;Pb&#8722;S&#8722;)n layers with Pb&#8722;S bonds. Moreover, the kinetic product exhibits higher photoconductivity than the thermodynamic product owing to the presence of the intrinsic 2D (&#8722;Pb&#8722;S&#8722;)n layers.

New perspectives in GaI and InI chemistry: The salts of &#8216;naked&#8217; M+ (M = Ga, In) ions with a weakly coordinating, fluorinated alkoxyaluminate anion have been isolated, and the stability of M+ with this anion in the coordinating solvents acetonitrile and diethyl ether has been demonstrated. The results will allow the coordination chemistry of M+ with weak ligands and the reactivity of M+ in standard solvents to be examined. The cover portrays these new possibilities as M+ hikers in a mysterious nighttime landscape. More information can be found in the Research Article by I.

         <title>Wavelength&#8208;Dependent Activation of Photoacids and Bases</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The wavelength&#8208;by&#8208;wavelength&#8208;resolved photoreactivity of a photoacid and a base is mapped in a simple and facile manner via pH monitoring, revealing a marked mismatch of photochemical reactivity and absorptivity of the acids and bases.







Abstract
Photoacids and bases allow remote control over pH in reaction solutions, which is of fundamental importance to an array of applications. Herein, we determine the wavelength&#8208;by&#8208;wavelength resolved photoreactivity of triarylsulfonium hexafluorophosphate salts as a representative photoacid generator and p&#8208;(benzoyl)benzyl triethylammonium tetraphenylborate as a photobase generator, constructing a wavelength&#8208;resolved photochemical action plot for each of the compounds. We monitor the pH change of the solution on&#8208;line within the cavity of the laser vial and demonstrate a marked mismatch between the absorption spectrum of the photoacid and base with the photochemical action plot, unveiling reactivity at very low absorptivities. Our findings are of critical importance for the use of photoacids and bases, unambiguously demonstrating that absorption is no guide to chemical reactivity with critical consequences for the wavelength employed in applications of photoacids and bases.

         <title>Fagopyrins from Buckwheat Flowers: Structural and Stereochemical Characterization Through Combined NMR/CD Spectroscopy and Theoretical Calculations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the first time, nine fagopyrin isomers have been structurally characterized and their stereochemistry fully elucidated by integrated 1H&#8208;NMR and CD spectroscopy studies. The presence of two different heterocyclic ring substituents, two stereogenic centers and the inherent axial chirality of the aromatic system provides a complex stereochemical relationships among isomers, giving account of the high level of molecular multiplicity.







Abstract
Fagopyrins are phenantroperylenequinones present in the flowers of Fagopyrum esculentum (buckwheat) endowed with photodynamic activity. It has been reported that fagopyrin extracts actually contain a complex mixture of closely related compounds, differing only on the nature of the perylenequinone substituents. We report our systematic and detailed study on the chemical composition of fagopyrin extracts by a combination of preparative and analytical techniques. The combined use of 1H&#8208;NMR and CD spectroscopy was found to be particularly suited to fully characterize all stereochemical aspects of the extracted fagopyrins. For the first time nine isomers have been structurally characterized and their stereochemistry fully elucidated. The presence of two different heterocyclic ring substituents, two stereogenic centers and the inherent axial chirality of the aromatic system provides a complex stereochemical relationships among isomers, thus giving account of the high level of molecular multiplicity found in the extract.

         <title>Challenges in the Synthesis and Processing of Hydrosilanes as Precursors for Silicon Deposition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>








Abstract
Liquid hydrosilanes are required for the production of silicon films. The silicon layers can be processed for electronic devices like transistors or thin&#8208;film solar cells. Hydrosilanes are highly reactive and pyrophoric. Therefore, the synthesis of these compounds is challenging and dangerous. The available synthesis methods for hydrosilanes are reviewed and compared.
Hydrosilanes are highly attractive compounds, which can be processed as liquids with printing technology to amorphous silicon films on nearly any solid substrate. The silicon layers can be processed for electronic devices like transistors or thin&#8208;film solar cells. The endothermic character of hydrosilanes with their positive enthalpies of formation results in favorable properties for processing. The larger the molecules, the lower their decomposition temperature and the higher their photoactivity. Cyclic hydrosilanes such as cyclopentasilane and cyclohexasilane can be easily deposited. The branched neopentasilane is more difficult to deposit but yields better&#8208;quality films after processing.
The key challenge is the complex synthesis of the precursors and the hydrosilanes. The available preparative methods are presented in this review and their advantages and disadvantages are evaluated. The following synthesis methods are presented and discussed in this article: Wurtz coupling and other reductive coupling processes, dehydrogenative coupling of silanes, plasma synthesis of chlorinated polysilanes, amine&#8208; or chloride&#8208;induced disproportionations, and transformation of monosilane to higher silanes.
Plasma synthesis is already carried out today as a continuous industrial process. The most effective synthesis methods in the laboratory are currently amine&#8208; and chloride&#8208;induced disproportionations. There is a great need to further optimize the syntheses of hydrosilanes and to develop new simple synthesis variants.

         <title>Insight into the Effect of Methylglyoxal on the Conformation, Function, and Aggregation Propensity of &#945;&#8208;Synuclein</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methylglyoxal reacts with &#945;&#8208;synuclein (&#945;S) by forming a heterogeneous mixture of reaction products on specific Lys. Among them highlights the 2&#8208;ammonio&#8208;6&#8208;[1&#8208;(5&#8208;ammonio&#8208;6&#8208;oxido&#8208;6&#8208;oxohexyl)&#8208;5&#8208;methylimidazolium&#8208;3&#8208;yl] hexanoate (MOLD), which crosslinks two Lys. The formation of these MG&#8208;derived AGEs had a scarce effect on the averaged conformational ensemble of &#945;S, but they completely depleted its native propensity to aggregate and its ability to bind, cluster and fusion synaptic&#8208;like vesicles.







Abstract
It is well&#8208;known that people suffering from hyperglycemia have a higher propensity to develop Parkinson's disease (PD). One of the most plausible mechanisms linking these two pathologies is the glycation of neuronal proteins and the pathological consequences of it. &#945;&#8208;Synuclein, a key component in PD, can be glycated at its fifteen lysine. In fact, the end products of this process have been detected on aggregated &#945;&#8208;synuclein isolated from in&#8197;vivo. However, the consequences of glycation are not entirely clear, which are of crucial importance to understand the mechanism underlying the connection between diabetes and PD. To better clarify this, we have here examined how methylglyoxal (the most important carbonyl compound found in the cytoplasm) affects the conformation and aggregation propensity of &#945;&#8208;synuclein, as well as its ability to cluster and fuse synaptic&#8208;like vesicles. The obtained data prove that methylglyoxal induces the Lys&#8208;Lys crosslinking through the formation of MOLD. However, this does not have a remarkable effect on the averaged conformational ensemble of &#945;&#8208;synuclein, although it completely depletes its native propensity to form soluble oligomers and insoluble amyloid fibrils. Moreover, methylglyoxal has a disrupting effect on the ability of &#945;&#8208;synuclein to bind, cluster and fusion synaptic&#8208;like vesicles.

         <title>Selective Lattice Doping Enables a Low&#8208;Cost, High&#8208;Capacity and Long&#8208;Lasting Potassium Layered Oxide Cathode for Potassium and Sodium Storage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel P3&#8208;type oxide, K0.57Cu0.1Fe0.1Mn0.8O2, is proposed to enhance KxMnO2 cathodes by addressing intrinsic issues and optimizing electrochemical properties. The co&#8208;doping strategy of multifunctional Cu and Fe element makes potassium&#8208;ion batteries more competitive for sustainable, low&#8208;cost energy storage. Additionally, the cathode can be adapted for sodium ion storage, offering a promising pathway for high&#8208;performance and cost&#8208;effective sodium&#8208;ion batteries.







Abstract
Layered transition metal oxides are highly promising host materials for K ions, owing to their high theoretical capacities and appropriate operational potentials. To address the intrinsic issues of KxMnO2 cathodes and optimize their electrochemical properties, a novel P3&#8208;type oxide doped with carefully chosen cost&#8208;effective, electrochemically active and multi&#8208;functional elements is proposed, namely K0.57Cu0.1Fe0.1Mn0.8O2. Compared to the pristine K0.56MnO2, its reversible specific is increased from 104 to 135&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1. In addition, the Cu and Fe co&#8208;doping triples the capacity under high current densities, and contributes to long&#8208;term stability over 500&#8197;cycles with a capacity retention of 68&#8201;%. Such endeavor holds the potential to make potassium&#8208;ion batteries particularly competitive for application in sustainable, low&#8208;cost, and large&#8208;scale energy storage devices. In addition, the cathode is also extended for sodium storage. Facilitated by the interlayer K ions that protect the layered structure from collapsing and expand the diffusion pathway for sodium ions, the cathode shows a high reversible capacity of 144&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1, fast kinetics and a long lifespan over 1000&#8197;cycles. The findings offer a novel pathway for the development of high&#8208;performance and cost&#8208;effective sodium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Engineering Modular DNA Reaction Networks for Signal Processing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

Engineering modular DNA reaction networks. Functional units are flexibly selected, adjusted, and combined to construct modular DNA reaction networks for performing various signal processing tasks.







Abstract
Diversified molecular information&#8208;processing methods have significant implications for nanoscale manipulation and control, monitoring and disease diagnosis of organisms, and direct intervention in biological activities. However, as an effective approach for implementing multifunctional molecular information processing, DNA reaction networks (DRNs) with numerous functionally specialized molecular structures have challenged them on scale design, leading to increased network complexity, further causing problems such as signal leakage, attenuation, and cross&#8208;talk in network reactions. Our study developed a strategy for performing various signal&#8208;processing tasks through engineering modular DRNs. This strategy is based on a universal core unit with signal selection capability, and a time&#8208;adjustable signal self&#8208;resetting module is achieved by combing the core unit and self&#8208;resetting unit, which improves the time controllability of modular DRNs. In addition, multi&#8208;input and &#8208;output signal cross&#8208;catalytic and continuously adjustable signal delay modules were realized by combining core and threshold units, providing a flexible, precise method for modular DRNs to process the signal. The strategy simplifies the design of DRNs, helps generate design ideas for large&#8208;scale integrated DRNs with multiple functions, and provides prospects in biocomputing, gene regulation, and biosensing.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diversified molecular information-processing methods have significant implications for nanoscale manipulation and control, monitoring and disease diagnosis of organisms, and direct intervention in biological activities. However, as an effective approach for implementing multifunctional molecular information processing, DNA reaction networks (DRNs) with numerous functionally specialized molecular structures have challenged them on scale design, leading to increased network complexity, further causing problems such as signal leakage, attenuation, and cross-talk in network reactions. Our study developed a strategy for performing various signal-processing tasks through engineering modular DRNs. This strategy is based on a universal core unit with signal selection capability, and a time-adjustable signal self-resetting module is achieved by combing the core unit and self-resetting unit, which improves the time controllability of modular DRNs. In addition, multi-input and -output signal cross-catalytic and continuously adjustable signal delay modules were realized by combining core and threshold units, providing a flexible, precise method for modular DRNs to process the signal. The strategy simplifies the design of DRNs, helps generate design ideas for large-scale integrated DRNs with multiple functions, and provides prospects in biocomputing, gene regulation, and biosensing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Opportunities of MXenes in Heterogeneous Catalysis: V2C as Aerobic Oxidation Catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This concept aims to illustrate the possibility to employ V2C MXene as a reusable heterogeneous solid catalyst for the aerobic oxidation of indane to indanol/indanone mixture with high conversion and selectivity under solvent free conditions. Further, the influence of surface terminal groups in MXene in oxidation reaction is also studied.







Abstract
MXenes are two&#8208;dimensional nanomaterials having alternating sheets of one atom&#8208;thick early transition metal layer and one atom&#8208;thick carbide or nitride layer. The external surface contains termination groups, whose nature depends on the etching agent used in the preparation procedure from the MAX phase. The present concept proposes that, due to their composition, the metal&#8208;surface termination groups make MXenes particularly suited as heterogeneous catalysts for some reactions. This proposal comes from the consideration that early transition metal atoms bonded to hydroxyl and oxo groups are a general type of active sites in heterogeneous catalysis and that similar catalytic centers can also be present in the MXene structure. After having presented the concept, we have selected V2C Mxene as an example to illustrate its catalytic activity and to show how the catalytic performance varies when the surface groups are modified. As a test reaction, we selected the aerobic oxidation of indane to the corresponding indanol/indanone mixture using molecular oxygen as terminal oxidizing reagent. Two previously reported procedures to modify the surface groups, namely surface dehydroxylation by thermal treatment under diluted hydrogen flow and surface oxidation with ammonium persulfate to convert some surface groups into oxo groups were used, observing in both cases a decrease in the catalytic activity of V2C. Based on this, VIII/IV&#8208;OH are proposed as catalytic centers in this aerobic oxidation. Overall, the present concept shows the merits of MXenes in heterogeneous catalysis, based on their chemical composition and the surface functionality.

         <title>Structure Engineering of Acridine Donor to Optimize Color Purity of Blue Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Donor engineering of dimethylacridine by incorporating fluorophenyl or trifluoromethylphenyl groups regularly shifts the fluorescence to sky blue region by 24 and 39&#8197;nm for the thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitters, but keeps high external quantum efficiencies in OLEDs at 22.7&#8201;%.







Abstract
9,9&#8208;Dimethyl&#8208;9,10&#8208;dihydroacridine (DMAC) is one of the most widely used electron donor for constructing high&#8208;performance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters. However, DMAC&#8208;based emitters often suffer from the imperfect color purity, particularly in blue emitters, due to its strong electron&#8208;donating capability. To modulate donor strength, 2,7&#8208;F&#8208;Ph&#8208;DMAC and 2,7&#8208;CF3&#8208;Ph&#8208;DMAC were designed by introducing the electron&#8208;withdrawing 2&#8208;fluorophenyl and 2&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)phenyl at the 2,7&#8208;positions of DMAC. These donors were used, in combination with 2,4,6&#8208;triphenyl&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine (TRZ) acceptor, to develop novel TADF emitters 2,7&#8208;F&#8208;Ph&#8208;DMAC&#8208;TRZ and 2,7&#8208;CF3&#8208;Ph&#8208;DMAC&#8208;TRZ. Compared to the F&#8208; or CF3&#8208;free reference emitter, both two emitters showed hypsochromic effect in fluorescence and comparable photoluminescence quantum yields without sacrificing the reverse intersystem crossing rate constants. In particular, 2,7&#8208;CF3&#8208;Ph&#8208;DMAC&#8208;TRZ based OLED exhibited a blue shift by up to 39&#8197;nm and significantly improved Commission International de l&#8242;&#201;clairage (CIE) coordinates from (0.36, 0.55) to (0.22, 0.41), while the external quantum efficiency kept stable at about 22.5&#8201;%. This donor engineering strategy should be valid for improving the color purity of large amount of acridine based TADF emitters. It can be predicted that pure blue TADF emitters should be feasible if these F&#8208; or CF3&#8208;modifed acridine donors are combined with other weaker electron acceptors.

         <title>Engineering Amino Acid and Peptide Supramolecular Architectures through Fluorination</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorination of amino acids deeply affects their self&#8208;assembly, enhancing, for instance, their tendency to aggregate into fibrils and gels. The conformational changes induced by fluorine can also change their functions, as well as the bioactivity of the deriving peptides and proteins, allowing to engineer bioinspired materials with specific and tunable properties.







Abstract
Fluorinated non&#8208;natural amino acids are attracting considerable research interest, especially in the biomedical field and in materials science, thanks to their ability to self&#8208;assemble into peculiar supramolecular structures. The conformational changes induced by the presence of fluorine atoms obviously affect their functions, as well as the biological activity of the deriving peptides and proteins. Here, we will briefly describe the main effects of fluorination on the aggregation behavior of such building blocks, focusing in particular on their improved tendency to form fibrils, and gels therefrom. Our aim is to underline the promising potential of fluorination as a tool to affect the self&#8208;assembly features of amino acids, both when used alone and when inserted into polypeptide sequences. The ability of fluorine to influence physical, chemical, and structural properties of these substrates offers the possibility to engineer bioinspired materials with specific and tunable functions.

Because of its special structural advantages, it has been widely used in Enantiomer recognition, Enantiomer separation, Circularly polarized luminescence and Asymmetric catalysis.







Abstract
Chiral Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks (CMOFs) is a kind of material with great application value in recent years. Formed by the coordination of metal ions or metal clusters with organic ligands. It has ordered and adjustable pores, multi&#8208;dimensional network structure, large specific surface area and excellent adsorption properties. This material structure combines the properties of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) with the chiral properties of chiral molecules. It has great advantages in catalysis, adsorption, separation and other fields. Therefore, it has a wide range of applications in chemistry, biology, medicine and materials science. In this paper, various synthesis strategies and preparation methods of chiral metal&#8208;organic frameworks are reviewed from different perspectives, and the advantages of each method are analyzed. In addition, the applications of chiral metal&#8208;organic framework materials in enantiomer recognition and separation, circular polarization luminescence and asymmetric catalysis are systematically summarized, and the corresponding mechanisms are discussed. Finally, the challenges and prospects of the development of chiral metal&#8208;organic frame materials are analyzed in detail.

The implementation of molecular switches within host&#8211;guest complexes allows the noncovalent ligation of molecular fragments, resulting in what E. Pazos, M.&#8197;D. Garc&#237;a, and co&#8208;workers have termed stimuli&#8208;responsive click chemistry. Their Concept article (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202400743) shows that these supramolecular systems are ideal candidates for controlling molecular conjugation on demand, opening up new possibilities towards a more function&#8208;oriented chemical synthesis.

Their Concept article (DOI: &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/chem.202400743"&gt;10.1002/chem.202400743&lt;/a&gt;) shows that these supramolecular systems are ideal candidates for controlling molecular conjugation on demand, opening up new possibilities towards a more function-oriented chemical synthesis.

         <title>Injectable Chitosan Hydrogels Doped with 2D Peptide Nanosheet&#8208;Drug Conjugates for Glutathione&#8208;Responsive Sustained Drug Delivery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 28, May 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecule&#8208;responsive drug release system based on 2D peptide nanosheets (PNSs) has been developed by using chitosan (CS) hydrogel as a sustained&#8208;release platform. The PNS&#8208;CS&#8208;based drug delivery system demonstrates outstanding pH&#8208;responsiveness and sustained drug release capabilities, and the improved cellular uptake shown offers potential for biomedical applications.







Abstract
The development of novel and effective drug delivery systems aimed at enhancing therapeutic profile and efficacy of therapeutic agents is a critical challenge in modern medicine. This study presents an intelligent drug delivery system based on self&#8208;assembled two&#8208;dimensional peptide nanosheets (2D PNSs). Leveraging the tunable properties of amino acid structures and sequences, we design a peptide with the sequence of Fmoc&#8208;FKKGSHC, which self&#8208;assembles into 2D PNSs with uniform structure, high biocompatibility, and excellent degradability. Covalent attachment of thiol&#8208;modified doxorubicin (DOX) drugs to 2D PNSs via disulfide bond results in the peptide&#8208;drug conjugates (PDCs), which is denoted as PNS&#8208;SS&#8208;DOX. Subsequently, the PDCs are encapsulated within the injectable, thermosensitive chitosan (CS) hydrogels for drug delivery. The designed drug delivery system demonstrates outstanding pH&#8208;responsiveness and sustained drug release capabilities, which are facilitated by the characteristics of the CS hydrogels. Meanwhile, the covalently linked disulfide bond within the PNS&#8208;SS&#8208;DOX is responsive to intracellular glutathione (GSH) within tumor cells, enabling controlled drug release and significantly inhibiting the cancer cell growth. This responsive peptide&#8208;drug conjugate based on a 2D peptide nanoplatform paves the way for the development of smart drug delivery systems and has bright prospects in the future biomedicine field.

         <title>Mechanistic Insights into the Discharge Processes of Li&#8722;CO2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 28, May 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This concept article elucidates the significant factors affecting discharge intermediates and reaction pathways of the Li&#8722;CO2 batteries and highlights a *Li2O&#8208;mediated surface lithiation mechanism.







Abstract
Li&#8722;CO2 batteries facilitate renewable energy storage in a cost&#8208;effective, eco&#8208;friendly manner. However, an inadequate understanding of their reaction mechanism severely impedes their development. Here we outline recent mechanistic advances in the discharge processes of Li&#8722;CO2 batteries, particularly in terms of the theoretical aspect. First, the vital factors affecting the formation of discharge intermediates are highlighted, and a surface lithiation mechanism predominantly applicable to catalysts with weak CO2 adsorption is proposed. Subsequently, the modeling of the chemical potential of Li++e&#8722;, which is crucial for the evaluation of the theoretical limiting voltage, is detailed. Finally, challenges and future directions pertaining to the further development of Li&#8722;CO2 are discussed. In essence, this concept article seeks to inspire future experimental and theoretical studies in advancing the development of Li&#8722;CO2 electrochemical technology.

         <title>Endowing Metal&#8208;Organic Coordination Materials with Chiroptical Activity by a Chiral Anion Strategy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 28, May 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Taking advantage of the chirality transfer from chiral anions to cationic coordination components, efficient circular dichroism and circularly polarized luminescence properties are realized. Such a chiral anion strategy is successfully implemented in ionic small&#8208;molecular metal complexes, metal clusters, coordination supramolecular assemblies, and metal&#8208;organic frameworks. The chiroptical properties can be modulated by the use of different chiral anions.







Abstract
Recently, chiral metal&#8208;organic coordination materials have emerged as promising candidates for a wide range of applications in chiroptoelectronics, chiral catalysis, and information encryption, etc. Notably, the chiroptical effect of coordination chromophores makes them appealing for applications such as photodetectors, OLEDs, 3D displays, and bioimaging. The direct synthesis of chiral coordination materials using chiral organic ligands or complexes with metal&#8208;centered chirality is very often tedious and costly. In the case of ionic coordination materials, the combination of chiral anions with cationic, achiral coordination compounds through noncovalent interactions may endow molecular materials with desirable chiroptical properties. The use of such a simple chiral strategy has been proven effective in inducing promising circular dichroism and/or circularly polarized luminescence signals. This concept article mainly delves into the latest advances in exploring the efficacy of such a chiral anion strategy for transforming achiral coordination materials into chromophores with superb photo&#8208; or electro&#8208;chiroptical properties. In particular, ionic small&#8208;molecular metal complexes, metal clusters, coordination supramolecular assemblies, and metal&#8208;organic frameworks containing chiral anions are discussed. A perspective on the future opportunities on the preparation of chiroptical materials with the chiral anion strategy is also presented.

         <title>Scope and Limitations of Using Microemulsions for the Covalent Patterning of Graphene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 28, May 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We explore the scope and limitations of using microemulsions (MEMs) as templates to pattern graphene covalently. This methodology is very simple and can be used to obtain functionalization in either the major (out&#8208;patterning) or the minor (in&#8208;patterning) components of the MEM.







Abstract
Patterning of graphene (functionalizing some areas while leaving others intact) is challenging, as all the C atoms in the basal plane are identical, but it is also desirable for a variety of applications, like opening a bandgap in the electronic structure of graphene. Several methods have been reported to pattern graphene, but most of them are very technologically intensive. Recently, we reported the use of microemulsions as templates to pattern graphene at the &#956;m scale. This method is very simple and in principle tunable, as emulsions of different droplet size and composition can be prepared easily. Here, we explore in detail the scope of this methodology by applying it to all the combinations of four different emulsions and three different organic reagents, and characterizing the resulting substrates exhaustively through Raman, SEM and AFM. We find that the method is general, works better when the reactive species are outside the micelles, and requires reactive species that involve short reaction times.

         <title>Suppressing Cis/Trans &#8216;Ring&#8208;Flipping&#8217; in Organoaluminium(III)&#8208;2&#8208;Pyridyl Dimers&#8211;Design Strategies Towards Lewis Acid Catalysts for Alkene Oligomerisation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 28, May 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controlling the cis/trans isomerism of the dimers [R2Al(&#956;&#8208;2&#8208;py&#8217;)]2 is the key to the development of co&#8208;operative cationic Al(III) catalysts that may offer stereo&#8208;control of alkene insertion during polymerization, in a similar way to established Zr(IV)&#8208;based systems. Substitution at the 6&#8208;position of the 2&#8208;py&#8217; groups favors the desired C2&#8208;symmetric trans isomer and the stability of the cations [{RAl(2&#8208;py&#8217;)}2(&#956;&#8208;Me)]+ formed by demethylation.







Abstract
Owing to its high natural abundance compared to the commonly used transition (precious) metals, as well as its high Lewis acidity and ability to change oxidation state, aluminium has recently been explored as the basis for a range of single&#8208;site catalysts. This paper aims to establish the ground rules for the development of a new type of cationic alkene oligomerisation catalyst containing two Al(III) ions, with the potential to act co&#8208;operatively in stereoselective assembly. Five new dimers of the type [R2Al(2&#8208;py&#8242;)]2 (R=Me, iBu; py&#8242;=substituted pyridyl group) with different substituents on the Al atoms and pyridyl rings have been synthesised. The formation of the undesired cis isomers can be suppressed by the presence of substituents on the 6&#8208;position of the pyridyl ring due to steric congestion, with DFT calculations showing that the selection of the trans isomer is thermodynamically controlled. Calculations show that demethylation of the dimers [Me2Al(2&#8208;py&#8242;)]2 with Ph3C+ to the cations [{MeAl(2&#8208;py&#8217;)}2(&#956;&#8208;Me)]+ is highly favourable and that the desired trans disposition of the 2&#8208;pyridyl ring units is influenced by steric effects. Preliminary experimental studies confirm that demethylation of [Me2Al(6&#8208;MeO&#8208;2&#8208;py)]2 can be achieved using [Ph3C][B(C6F5)4].

         <title>Composition and Conformation of Hetero&#8208; versus Homo&#8208;Fluorinated Triazolamers Influence their Activity on Islet Amyloid Polypeptide Aggregation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 28, May 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
While fluorinated molecules constitute nearly 30&#8201;% of all newly approved drugs, and peptidomimetic foldamers provide original solutions to resolve certain peptide problems, the interest of fluorinated foldamers is still little addressed. The conformational and biological interest of fluorinated triazolamers as an alternative to natural peptides is demonstrated here.







Abstract
Novel fluorinated foldamers based on aminomethyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;triazolyl&#8208;difluoroacetic acid (1,4&#8208;Tz&#8722;CF2) units were synthesized and their conformational behaviour was studied by NMR and molecular dynamics. Their activity on the aggregation of the human islet amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP) amyloid protein was evaluated by fluorescence spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. The fluorine labelling of these foldamers allowed the analysis of their interaction with the target protein. We demonstrated that the preferred extended conformation of homotriazolamers of 1,4&#8208;Tz&#8722;CF2 unit increases the aggregation of hIAPP, while the hairpin&#8208;like conformation of more flexible heterotriazolamers containing two 1,4&#8208;Tz&#8722;CF2 units mixed with natural amino acids from the hIAPP sequence reduces it, and more efficiently than the parent natural peptide. The longer heterotriazolamers having three 1,4&#8208;Tz&#8722;CF2 units adopting more folded hairpin&#8208;like and ladder&#8208;like structures similar to short multi&#8208;stranded &#946;&#8208;sheets have no effect. This work demonstrates that a good balance between the structuring and flexibility of these foldamers is necessary to allow efficient interaction with the target protein.

The preparation of substituted 3&#8208;chloro&#8208;3&#8208;aryl&#8208;cyclopropanes through the reaction of alkenes with photolytically&#8208;generated chlorocarbenes from chlorodiazirines is reported as an effective method. This approach facilitates the production of diverse 3&#8208;chloro&#8208;3&#8208;aryl&#8208;cyclopropanes (32 examples) in an continuous flow with a residence time of 5 minutes under the influence of light&#8208;emitting diode (LED) irradiation. The use of 380&#8197;nm irradiation conditions was effectively extended to the synthesis of substituted 3&#8208;bromo&#8208;3&#8208;aryl&#8208;cyclopropanes (3 examples).

         <title>Superalkalis with Hydrogen as Central Electronegative Atom and their Possible Applications: Ab Initio and DFT Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 28, May 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Superalkalis having hydrogen as central electronegative core are designed. They exhibit very low ionization energies even lower than that of cesium. The superalkalis are capable of reducing molecules having very low electron affinities. They can act as the building blocks of supersalts and also show remarkable non&#8208;linear optical property.







Abstract
Superalkalis are unusual species having ionization energies lower than that of the alkali metals. These species with various applications are of great importance in chemistry due to their low ionization energies and strong reducing property. A typical superalkali contains a central electronegative core decorated with excess metal ligands. In the quest for novel superalkalis, we have designed the superalkalis HLi2, HLiNa and HNa2 using hydrogen as central electronegative atom for the first time employing high level ab initio (CCSD(T), MP2) and density functional theory (&#969;B97X&#8208;D) methods. The superalkalis exhibit very low ionization energies, even lower than that of cesium. Stability of these species is verified from binding energy and dissociation energy values. The superalkalis are capable of reducing SO2, NO, CO2, CO and N2 molecules by forming stable ionic complexes and therefore can be used as catalysts for the reduction or activation of systems possessing very low electron affinities. The superalkalis form stable supersalts with tailored properties when interact with a superhalogen. They also show remarkably high non&#8208;linear optical responses, hence could have industrial applications. It is hoped that this work will enrich the superalkali family and spur further theoretical and experimental research in this direction.

         <title>Design and Asymmetric Control of Orientational Chirality by Using the Combination of C(sp2)&#8208;C(sp) Levers and Achiral N&#8208;Protecting Group</title>

We report herein the design of the asymmetric synthesis of orientational atropisomers via Sonogashira coupling as the key step. This new category of orientational atropisomers is anticipated to have a broad impact on chemical, biomedical, and material sciences in the future.







Abstract
New chiral targets of orientational chirality have been designed and asymmetrically synthesized by taking advantage of N&#8208;sulfinyl imine&#8208;directed nucleophilic addition/oxidation, Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura, and Sonogashira cross&#8208;coupling reactions. Orientation of single isomers has been selectively controlled by using aryl/alkynyl levers [C(sp2)&#8208;C(sp) axis] and tBuSO2&#8208; protecting group on nitrogen as proven by X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. The key structural characteristic of resulting orientational products is shown by remote through&#8208;space blocking manner.

     alt="Design and Asymmetric Control of Orientational Chirality by Using the Combination of C(sp2)-C(sp) Levers and Achiral N-Protecting Group"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report herein the design of the asymmetric synthesis of orientational atropisomers &lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; Sonogashira coupling as the key step. This new category of orientational atropisomers is anticipated to have a broad impact on chemical, biomedical, and material sciences in the future.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New chiral targets of orientational chirality have been designed and asymmetrically synthesized by taking advantage of &lt;i&gt;N-&lt;/i&gt;sulfinyl imine-directed nucleophilic addition/oxidation, Suzuki-Miyaura, and Sonogashira cross-coupling reactions. Orientation of single isomers has been selectively controlled by using aryl/alkynyl levers [C(sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)-C(sp) axis] and &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;BuSO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;- protecting group on nitrogen as proven by X-ray diffraction analysis. The key structural characteristic of resulting orientational products is shown by remote through-space blocking manner. Seventeen examples of multi-step synthesis were obtained with modest to good chemical yields and complete orientational selectivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Controlling the Crystal Growth of DNA Molecules via Strategic Chemical Modifications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 28, May 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controlling the crystal growth of biomacromolecules remains elusive. Herein we have successfully accelerated the crystal growth of DNA molecules by introducing the 2&#8217;&#8208;O&#8208;methylation into their stacking sites, and decelerated it by introducing the phosphorothioate. Further, we have developed a novel strategy for controlling the crystal growth of biomacromolecules.







Abstract
Intermolecular interactions are critical to the crystallization of biomolecules, yet the precise control of biomolecular crystal growth based on these interactions remains elusive. To understand the connections between the crystallization kinetics and the strength of intermolecular interactions, herein we have employed DNA triangular crystals and modified ones as a versatile tool to investigate how the strength of intermolecular interaction affects crystal growth. Interestingly, we have found that the 2&#8217;&#8208;O&#8208;methylation at sticky ends of the DNA triangle could strengthen its intermolecular interaction, resulting in the accelerated formation of smaller crystals. Conversely, phosphorothioate modification could weaken the sticky&#8208;end cohesion and delay the nucleation, resulting in formation of fewer but larger crystals. In addition, these modification effects were consistently observed in the crystallization of a DNA decamer. In one word, our experimental results demonstrate that the strength of intermolecular interaction directly impacts crystal growth. It suggests that 2&#8217;&#8208;O&#8208;methylation and phosphorothioate modification represents a rational strategy for controlling DNA molecules grow into desired crystals and it also facilitates structural determination.

Hydrolytically stable palladium and platinum diaminocarbene complexes exhibit nanomolar antiproliferative activity and high selectivity for triple&#8208;negative breast cancer. Our lead drug candidate surpasses cisplatin by 300 times in vitro and exhibits superior efficacy in reducing the growth of aggressive MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 xenograft tumors in mice. The critical role of interference with metabolic processes and redox homeostasis in achieving excellent selectivity for cancer cells is demonstrated.







Abstract
Hydrolytically stable PdII and PtII complexes supported by acyclic diaminocarbene ligands represent a novel class of structural organometallic anticancer agents exhibiting nanomolar antiproliferative activity in a panel of cancer cell lines (IC50 0.07&#8211;0.81&#8197;&#956;M) and up to 300&#8208;fold selectivity for cancer cells over normal primary fibroblasts. The lead drug candidate was 300 times more potent than cisplatin in&#8197;vitro and showed higher efficacy in reducing the growth of aggressive MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 xenograft tumors in mice.

         <title>pH&#8208;Responsive Aminobenzocoumarins as Fluorescent Probes for Biological Acidity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 28, May 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorescent pH probes applicable in staining lysosomes in live human cells have been synthesized and characterized. These aminobenzocoumarins display large Stokes shifts, emission in the visible region, and up to 300&#8208;fold emission intensity increase upon activation in acidic conditions.







Abstract
Regulation of pH plays an essential role in orchestrating the delicate cellular machinery responsible for life as we know it. Its abnormal values are indicative of aberrant cellular behavior and associated with pathologies including cancer progression or solid tumors. Here, we report a series of bent and linear aminobenzocoumarins decorated with different substituents. We investigate their photophysical properties and demonstrate that the probes display strong pH&#8208;responsive fluorescence &#8220;turn on&#8221; behavior in highly acidic environments, with enhancement up to 300&#8208;fold. In combination with their low cytotoxicity, this behavior enabled their application in bioimaging of acidic lysosomes in live human cells. We believe that these molecules serve as attractive lead structures for future rational design of novel biocompatible fluorescent pH probes.

         <title>Enhancing Intramolecular Ferromagnetic Coupling in Tetrathiafulvalene&#8211;Nitronyl Nitroxide&#8208;Based Compounds through Spin Polarization Mechanism</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 28, May 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intramolecular ferromagnetic (FM) J&#8208;coupling between spin&#8208;polarized&#8208;donor radicals like Tetrathiafulvalene (TTF+&#8901;) and Nitronyl&#8208;Nitroxide (NN) connected by a coupler, such as in BTBN, is a key ingredient to achieve magnetoresistant response. In silico modifications of BTBN accomplish the enhancement of the FM coupling by using hydroxyl&#8208;ethylene as coupler, while preserving BTBN&#8242;s structure, providing promising candidates for a (possibly) improved magnetoresistance material.







Abstract
Spin&#8208;polarized donor radicals based on tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) derivatives and nitronyl nitroxide (NN) radicals in which one&#8208;electron oxidation involves the HOMO instead of the SOMO are well known for exhibiting magnetoresistance. In particular, BTBN consists of one dibromo&#8208;TTF and one NN radical, which are linked by a phenyl coupler group. One of the key factors driving magnetoresistance is the presence of intramolecular ferromagnetic (FM) coupling between the oxidized &#960;&#8208;donor (TTF+&#8901;, D unit) and NN (R unit). Here, a theoretical study is carried out to assess suitable candidates with enhanced FM coupling with respect BTBN, which is thus used as a reference. The study is conducted via in silico chemical modification of the substituents of the BTBN basic functional units (D and R radicals, C coupler) to benefit from the spin polarization mechanism to boost the intramolecular FM coupling, aiming to distort the BTBN radical arrangement within the molecular crystal as little as possible, in the event the material can be synthesized. NICSiso(1) and Wiberg's Bond Order are analyzed to further assist in identifying promising potential candidates, since the decrease in aromaticity is expected to enhance the diradical character and give rise to a larger magnetic coupling value. The most favorable diradical building block to replace the BTBN moiety results from using a hydroxyl&#8208;ethylene (&#8722;(H)C=C(OH)&#8722;) as a coupler preserving BTBN original radicals, namely, NN and TTF+&#8901; units. This study aims at illustrating the feasibility of improving the intramolecular FM interaction between radical moieties, which is fully realized, as a first step towards the synthesis of new materials with (possibly) enhanced magnetoresistance properties.

         <title>Cellular Uptake of Cell&#8208;Penetrating Peptides Activated by Amphiphilic p&#8208;Sulfonatocalix[4]arenes</title>

         <dc:description>
The synthesis of amphiphilic p&#8208;sulfonatocalix[4]arenes with varying alkyl chain lengths (CX4&#8208;Cn) and their ability to activate the uptake of cell&#8208;penetrating peptides (CPPs) into vesicles and into CHO&#8722;K1, HCT 116, and KTC&#8208;1 cells is reported. First mechanistic studies suggest that CX4&#8208;Cn are excellent to afford an efficient cellular delivery of CPP&#8208;conjugated cargo molecules into the cytosol of live cells.







Abstract
We report the synthesis of a series of amphiphilic p&#8208;sulfonatocalix[4]arenes with varying alkyl chain lengths (CX4&#8208;Cn) and their application as efficient counterion activators for membrane transport of cell&#8208;penetrating peptides (CPPs). The enhanced membrane activity is confirmed with the carboxyfluorescein (CF) assay in vesicles and by the direct cytosolic delivery of CPPs into CHO&#8722;K1, HCT 116, and KTC&#8208;1 cells enabling excellent cellular uptake of the CPPs into two cancer cell lines. Intracellular delivery was confirmed by fluorescence microscopy after CPP entry into live cells mediated by CX4&#8208;Cn, which was also quantified after cell lysis by fluorescence spectroscopy. The results present the first systematic exploration of structure&#8208;activity relationships for calixarene&#8208;based counterion activators and show that CX4&#8208;Cn are exceptionally effective in cellular delivery of CPPs. The dodecyl derivative, CX4&#8208;C12, serves as best activator. A first mechanistic insight is provided by efficient CPP uptake at 4&#8201;&#176;C and in the presence of the endocytosis inhibitor dynasore, which indicates a direct translocation of the CPP&#8208;counterion complexes into the cytosol and highlights the potential benefits of CX4&#8208;Cn for efficient and direct translocation of CPPs and CPP&#8208;conjugated cargo molecules into the cytosol of live cells.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly Strategy for Constructing Porous Boron and Nitrogen Co&#8208;Doped Carbon as an Efficient ORR Electrocatalyst toward Zinc&#8208;Air Battery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 28, May 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;assembly strategy is developed to construct porous N and B doped carbon materials (BCN&#8208;P) as efficient metal&#8208;free ORR catalysts for zinc&#8208;air battery, which employs the macrocyclic molecule cucurbit[7]uril (CB7) and 3D aromatic&#8208;like closo&#8208;[B12H12]2&#8722; as nitrogen and boron sources. BCN&#8208;P exhibits better ORR catalytic activity than its single dopant counterpart, and even comparable to Pt/C in zinc&#8208;air battery performance.







Abstract
Carbon nanomaterials doped with N and B could activate nearby carbon atoms to promote charge polarization through the synergistic coupling effect between N and B atoms, thus facilitating adsorption of O2 and weakening O&#8722;O bond to enhance oxygen reduction reaction. Herein, a simple and controllable self&#8208;assembly strategy is applied to synthesize porous B, N co&#8208;doped carbon&#8208;based catalysts (BCN&#8208;P), which employs the macrocyclic molecule cucurbit[7]uril (CB7) as nitrogen source, and 3D aromatic&#8208;like closo&#8208;[B12H12]2&#8722; as boron source. In addition, polystyrene microspheres are added to help introduce porous structure to expose more active sites. Benefitting from porous structures and the synergistic coupling effect between N and B atoms, BCN&#8208;P has a high onset potential (Eonset=0.846&#8197;V) and half&#8208;wave potential (E1/2=0.74&#8197;V) in alkaline media. The zinc&#8208;air battery assembled with BCN&#8208;P shows high operating voltage (1.42&#8197;V), peak power density (128.7&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and stable charge/discharge cycles, which is even comparable with Pt/C.

         <title>Not All Binding Sites Are Equal: Site Determination and Folding State Analysis of Gas&#8208;Phase Protein&#8208;Metallodrug Adducts</title>

Mass spectrometric studies showed that the anticancer agent RAPTA&#8208;C binds most effectively to ubiquitin and myoglobin over cytochrome c and lysozyme via coordination to His and/or Met residues. While coordination of [Ru(cym)] to ubiquitin at Met1 caused a large compaction of the native&#8208;like protein, [Ru(cym)(PTA)] adducts had negligible effects, as also observed for myoglobin.







Abstract
Modern approaches in metallodrug research focus on compounds that bind protein targets rather than DNA. However, the identification of protein targets and binding sites is challenging. Using intact mass spectrometry and proteomics, we investigated the binding of the antimetastatic agent RAPTA&#8208;C to the model proteins ubiquitin, cytochrome c, lysozyme, and myoglobin. Binding to cytochrome c and lysozyme was negligible. However, ubiquitin bound up to three Ru moieties, two of which were localized at Met1 and His68 as [Ru(cym)], and [Ru(cym)] or [Ru(cym)(PTA)] adducts, respectively. Myoglobin bound up to four [Ru(cym)(PTA)] moieties and five sites were identified at His24, His36, His64, His81/82 and His113. Collision&#8208;induced unfolding (CIU) studies via ion&#8208;mobility mass spectrometry allowed measuring protein folding as a function of collisional activation. CIU of protein&#8211;RAPTA&#8208;C adducts showed binding of [Ru(cym)] to Met1 caused a significant compaction of ubiquitin, likely from N&#8208;terminal S&#8722;Ru&#8722;N chelation, while binding of [Ru(cym)(PTA)] to His residues of ubiquitin or myoglobin induced a smaller effect. Interestingly, the folded state of ubiquitin formed by His functionalization was more stable than Met1 metalation. The data suggests that selective metalation of amino acids at different positions on the protein impacts the conformation and potentially the biological activity of anticancer compounds.

         <title>Identification of the Cirratiomycin Biosynthesis Gene Cluster in Streptomyces Cirratus: Elucidation of the Biosynthetic Pathways for 2,3&#8208;Diaminobutyric Acid and Hydroxymethylserine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 28, May 17, 2024. </description>

The cirratiomycin biosynthetic gene cluster was identified in Streptomyces cirratus by genome sequencing and gene inactivation. The biosynthesis of two nonproteinogenic amino acids was elucidated: (2S,3S)&#8208;2,3&#8208;diaminobutyric acid (DABA) is synthesized from threonine by four enzymes, CirQ, CirR, CirS and CirB, and &#945;&#8208;(hydroxymethyl)serine (HMSer) is synthesized from d&#8208;serine by CirH.







Abstract
Cirratiomycin, a heptapeptide with antibacterial activity, was isolated and characterized in 1981; however, its biosynthetic pathway has not been elucidated. It contains several interesting nonproteinogenic amino acids, such as (2S,3S)&#8208;2,3&#8208;diaminobutyric acid ((2S,3S)&#8208;DABA) and &#945;&#8208;(hydroxymethyl)serine, as building blocks. Here, we report the identification of a cirratiomycin biosynthetic gene cluster in Streptomyces cirratus. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that several Streptomyces viridifaciens and Kitasatospora aureofaciens strains also have this cluster. One S. viridifaciens strain was confirmed to produce cirratiomycin. The biosynthetic gene cluster was shown to be responsible for cirratiomycin biosynthesis in S. cirratus in a gene inactivation experiment using CRISPR&#8208;cBEST. Interestingly, this cluster encodes a nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) composed of 12 proteins, including those with an unusual domain organization: a stand&#8208;alone adenylation domain, two stand&#8208;alone condensation domains, two type II thioesterases, and two NRPS modules that have no adenylation domain. Using heterologous expression and in&#8197;vitro analysis of recombinant enzymes, we revealed the biosynthetic pathway of (2S,3S)&#8208;DABA: (2S,3S)&#8208;DABA is synthesized from l&#8208;threonine by four enzymes, CirR, CirS, CirQ, and CirB. In addition, CirH, a glycine/serine hydroxymethyltransferase homolog, was shown to synthesize &#945;&#8208;(hydroxymethyl)serine from d&#8208;serine in&#8197;vitro. These findings broaden our knowledge of nonproteinogenic amino acid biosynthesis.

Using heterologous expression and &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;vitro&lt;/i&gt; analysis of recombinant enzymes, we revealed the biosynthetic pathway of (2&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;,3&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)-DABA: (2&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;,3&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)-DABA is synthesized from &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;-threonine by four enzymes, CirR, CirS, CirQ, and CirB. In addition, CirH, a glycine/serine hydroxymethyltransferase homolog, was shown to synthesize &#945;-(hydroxymethyl)serine from &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;-serine &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;vitro&lt;/i&gt;. These findings broaden our knowledge of nonproteinogenic amino acid biosynthesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis and Functionalization of Azetidine&#8208;Containing Small Macrocyclic Peptides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 28, May 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Incorporation of a 3&#8208;aminoazetidine (3&#8208;AAz) into peptide backbones improves head&#8208;to&#8208;tail cyclizations compared to unmodified peptides. The azetidine nitrogen can be readily functionalized using substitution or click chemistry. Crystal structure analysis reveals that a 3&#8208;AAz modified cyclic tetrapeptide adopts an uncommon all&#8208;trans conformation. The 3&#8208;AAz provides stability to protease degradation compared to the unmodified macrocycle.







Abstract
Cyclic peptides are increasingly important structures in drugs but their development can be impeded by difficulties associated with their synthesis. Here, we introduce the 3&#8208;aminoazetidine (3&#8208;AAz) subunit as a new turn&#8208;inducing element for the efficient synthesis of small head&#8208;to&#8208;tail cyclic peptides. Greatly improved cyclizations of tetra&#8208;, penta&#8208; and hexapeptides (28 examples) under standard reaction conditions are achieved by introduction of this element within the linear peptide precursor. Post&#8208;cyclization deprotection of the amino acid side chains with strong acid is realized without degradation of the strained four&#8208;membered azetidine. A special feature of this chemistry is that further late&#8208;stage modification of the resultant macrocyclic peptides can be achieved via the 3&#8208;AAz unit. This is done by: (i) chemoselective deprotection and substitution at the azetidine nitrogen, or by (ii) a click&#8208;based approach employing a 2&#8208;propynyl carbamate on the azetidine nitrogen. In this way, a range of dye and biotin tagged macrocycles are readily produced. Structural insights gained by XRD analysis of a cyclic tetrapeptide indicate that the azetidine ring encourages access to the less stable, all&#8208;trans conformation. Moreover, introduction of a 3&#8208;AAz into a representative cyclohexapeptide improves stability towards proteases compared to the homodetic macrocycle.

         <title>[Gd(HB&#8208;DO3A)]: Equilibrium, Dissociation Kinetic and Structural Differences in a Simple Homolog of [Gd(HP&#8208;DO3A)] (Prohance&#174;)</title>

The minor structural variation arising in [Gd(HB&#8208;DO3A)] from homologation of a coordination side arm of the clinically employed MRI contrast agent [Gd(HP&#8208;DO3A)] (gadoteridol) does not influence its overall general structure but significantly affects its dynamic properties.







Abstract
[Gd(HP&#8208;DO3A)] (gadoteridol) as an active compound of ProHance&#174; is a widely employed contrast agent in clinical MRI scans in the last 30&#8197;years. Recent concerns about the long&#8208;term retention of gadolinium&#8208;based contrast agents (GBCAs) led to a deeper investigation of the structural features underlying the integrity of the paramagnetic metal complex. Several human and nonclinical studies have noted marked differences among the macrocyclic GBCAs, with the least retention of Gd traces and most rapid elimination consistently being reported for [Gd(HP&#8208;DO3A)]. It was deemed of interest to assess how minor structural/electronic changes associated to the ligand structure may affect basic properties of the metal complex with several [Gd(HP&#8208;DO3A)] analogues synthesized and characterized in the last years. We recently reported that the closest homolog of [Gd(HP&#8208;DO3A)], i.&#8201;e.: [Gd(HB&#8208;DO3A)], in which a (&#177;)&#8208;2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;1&#8208;propyl pendant arm is replaced by a (&#177;)&#8208;2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;1&#8208;butyl moiety, showed a significantly different retention behaviour in the model interaction with collagen, despite the apparently very minor structural difference. In this paper we report a comprehensive study of the structural, thermodynamic, kinetic and relaxation properties of [Gd(HB&#8208;DO3A)], compared to the parent [Gd(HP&#8208;DO3A)] and to other closely related macrocyclic GBCAs to assess whether very minor structural changes can modulate the physico&#8208;chemical properties of Gd3+ complexes.

         <title>Quest for Double M&#246;bius Aromaticity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 28, May 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quantum chemical calculation predict double and single M&#246;bius aromaticity in the global minimum geometries of Rh2B2 and RhB2&#8722; clusters. Heavier analogue Ir2B2 follows the same type of aromaticity, albeit being non&#8208;planar. Aromaticity of these clusters have been confirmed by various analysis.







Abstract
Neutral four&#8208;membered rings with 4n&#8197;electrons are generally H&#252;ckel antiaromatic. On the other hand, 4n electron system can also be M&#246;bius aromatic, although identification has escaped so far. A recent study of double M&#246;bius aromaticity has been put forwarded in the D2h symmetric singlet ground state of four member Pa2B2 ring. Although interesting, but the synthesis possesses a significant challenge as Pa is rare, highly radioactive and toxic. Herein, a synthetically viable four membered Rh2B2 cluster is proposed which contains double M&#246;bius aromaticity. Interestingly, the three membered RhB2&#8722; cluster also possess M&#246;bius aromaticity and is the smallest ring to show such phenomenon.

The anilato&#8208;based DyIII&#8208;containing compounds formulated as [Dy2(C6O4Cl2)3(fma)6]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;4.5fma (1) and [Dy2(C6O4X2)3(fma)6]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;4fma&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H2O, with X=Br (2) and Cl (3), prepared with formamide as coordinating solvent, are coordination polymers with a honey&#8208;comb layered structure showing slow magnetic relaxation when a DC field is applied. Compounds 1 and 3 are solvates obtained with a slow and fast crystallization method, respectively. Compounds 2 and 3 are isostructural.







Abstract
We have prepared and characterized three coordination polymers formulated as [Dy2(C6O4Cl2)3(fma)6]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;4.5fma (1) and [Dy2(C6O4X2)3(fma)6]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;4fma&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H2O with X=Br (2) and Cl (3), where fma=formamide and C6O4X22&#8722;=3,6&#8208;disubstituted&#8208;2,5&#8208;dihydroxy&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone dianion with X=Cl (chloranilato) and Br (bromanilato). Compounds 1 and 3 are solvates obtained with slow and fast precipitation methods, respectively. Compounds 2 and 3 are isostructural and only differ in the X group of the anilato ligand. The three compounds present (6,3)&#8208;gon two&#8208;dimensional hexagonal honey&#8208;comb structures. Magnetic measurements indicate that the three compounds show slow relaxation of the magnetization at low temperatures when a continuous magnetic field is applied, although with different relaxation times and energy barriers depending on X and the crystallisation molecules. Compounds 1&#8211;3 represent the first examples of anilato&#8208;based lattices with formamide and field&#8208;induced slow relaxation of the magnetization.

&lt;p&gt;The anilato-based Dy&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;-containing compounds formulated as [Dy&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(fma)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;4.5fma (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) and [Dy&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;X&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(fma)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;4fma&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, with X=Br (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;) and Cl (&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;), prepared with formamide as coordinating solvent, are coordination polymers with a honey-comb layered structure showing slow magnetic relaxation when a DC field is applied. Compounds &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; are solvates obtained with a slow and fast crystallization method, respectively. Compounds &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; are isostructural.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have prepared and characterized three coordination polymers formulated as [Dy&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(fma)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;4.5fma (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) and [Dy&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;X&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(fma)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;4fma&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O with X=Br (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;) and Cl (&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;), where fma=formamide and C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;X&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;=3,6-disubstituted-2,5-dihydroxy-1,4-benzoquinone dianion with X=Cl (chloranilato) and Br (bromanilato). Compounds &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; are solvates obtained with slow and fast precipitation methods, respectively. Compounds &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; are isostructural and only differ in the X group of the anilato ligand. The three compounds present (6,3)-gon two-dimensional hexagonal honey-comb structures. Magnetic measurements indicate that the three compounds show slow relaxation of the magnetization at low temperatures when a continuous magnetic field is applied, although with different relaxation times and energy barriers depending on X and the crystallisation molecules. Compounds &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; represent the first examples of anilato-based lattices with formamide and field-induced slow relaxation of the magnetization.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Leveraging Pyrazolium Ylide Reactivity to Access Indolizine and 1,2&#8208;Dihydropyrimidine Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 28, May 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild, transition metal&#8208;free method to synthesize indolizines and 1,2&#8208;dihydropyrimidines from pyrazolium ylides is presented. The reaction of pyrazolium ylides with alkynes follows an N&#8208;deletion mechanism to afford indolizines, while reaction with isocyanates follows a rearrangement into a 1,2&#8208;dihydropyrimidine.







Abstract
N&#8208;Heterocyclic ylides are important synthetic precursors to rapidly build molecular complexity. Pyrazolium ylides have largely been unexplored, and we demonstrate their diverse utility in this report. We show that these readily accessible building blocks can be used to construct different heterocyclic skeletons by varying the coupling partner. Indolizines can be formed via an N&#8208;deletion type mechanism when reacting pyrazolium salts with electron deficient alkynes. 1,2&#8208;Dihydropyrimidines can be formed via a rearrangement mechanism when reacting pyrazolium ylides with isocyanates. These reactions enable access to valuable heteroarenes without the need for transition metal catalysis, high temperatures, or strong bases.

         <title>Incorporation of Carboxylate Pendant Arms into 18&#8208;Membered Macrocycles: Effects on [nat/203Pb]Pb(II) Complexation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 28, May 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chelators based on an 18&#8208;membered macrocyclic unit form very stable Pb(II) complexes from the thermodynamic point of view. The studies performed with [203Pb]Pb(II) show that the fluxionality of the complexes is a key factor that needs to be considered for the development of Pb(II)&#8208;based radiopharmaceuticals.







Abstract
We present a detailed investigation on the coordination chemistry of [nat/203Pb]Pb(II) with chelators H4PYTA and H4CHX&#8208;PYTA. These chelators belong to the family of ligands derived from the 18&#8208;membered macrocyclic backbone PYAN and present varying degrees of rigidity due to the presence of either ethyl or cyclohexyl spacers. A complete study of the stable Pb(II) complexes is carried out via NMR, X&#8208;Ray crystallography, stability constant determination and computational studies. While these studies indicated that Pb(II) complexation is achieved, and the thermodynamic stability of the resulting complexes is very high, a certain degree of fluxionality does exist in both cases. Nevertheless, radiolabeling studies were carried out using SPECT (single photon emission computed tomography) compatible isotope lead&#8208;203 (203Pb, t1/2=51.9&#8197;h), and while both chelators complex the radioisotope, the incorporation of carboxylate pendant arms appears to be detrimental towards the stability of the complexes when compared to the previously described amide analogues. Additionally, incorporation of a cyclohexyl spacer does not improve the kinetic inertness of the system.

A stereoselective intramolecular bicyclization reaction of sulfonamides via intramolecular Mannich and aza&#8208;Michael addition cascade which is an efficient, simple and practical method for the synthesis of bicyclic &#947;&#8208;ureasultams.







Abstract
A novel approach has been developed for the synthesis of bicyclic &#946;, &#947;&#8208;fused bicyclic &#947;&#8208;ureasultams containing two consecutive chiral centers through an intramolecular Mannich and aza&#8208;Michael addition cascade of alkenyl sulfamides. The straightforward practical procedure and readily available starting materials enable the synthesis of variously substituted ureasultams. In addition, bicyclic &#947;&#8208;ureasultams is a class of potential biotin analogues.

         <title>Eight&#8208;Electron Copper Nanoclusters for Photothermal Conversion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 28, May 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomically precise Cu54 nanoclusters with eight free valence electrons have been prepared, characterized, and structurally determined. The clusters show high performance in the field of photothermal conversion. For the first time, atomically precise copper nanoclusters are proved to be effective in photothermal application, which may stimulate the research on using copper nanoclusters in material sciences.







Abstract
Owing to distinct physicochemical properties in comparison to gold and silver counterparts, atomically precise copper nanoclusters are attracting embryonic interest in material science. The introduction of copper cluster nanomaterials in more interesting fields is currently urgent and desired. Reported in this work are novel copper nanoclusters of [XCu54Cl12(tBuS)20(NO3)12] (X=S or none, tBuSH=2&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;propanethiol), which exhibit high performance in photothermal conversion. The clusters have been prepared in one pot and characterized by combinatorial techniques including ultraviolet&#8208;visible spectroscopy (UV&#8208;vis), electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI&#8208;MS), and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The molecular structure of the clusters, as revealed by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis (SCXRD), shows the concentric three&#8208;shell Russian doll arrangement of X@Cu14@Cl12@Cu40. Interestingly, the [SCu54Cl12(tBuS)20(NO3)12] cluster contains 8 free valence electrons in its structure, making it the first eight&#8208;electron copper nanocluster stabilized by thiolates. More impressively, the clusters possess an effective photothermal conversion (temperature increases by 71&#8201;&#176;C within ~50&#8197;s, &#955;ex=445&#8197;nm, 0.5&#8197;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2) in a wide wavelength range (either blue or near&#8208;infrared). The photothermal conversion can be even driven under irradiation of simulated sunlight (3 sun), endowing the clusters with great potency in solar energy utilization.

Reported in this work are novel copper nanoclusters of [XCu&lt;sub&gt;54&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;(&lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt;BuS)&lt;sub&gt;20&lt;/sub&gt;(NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;] (X=S or none, &lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt;BuSH=2-methyl-2-propanethiol), which exhibit high performance in photothermal conversion. The clusters have been prepared in one pot and characterized by combinatorial techniques including ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-vis), electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The molecular structure of the clusters, as revealed by single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis (SCXRD), shows the concentric three-shell Russian doll arrangement of X@Cu&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt;@Cl&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;@Cu&lt;sub&gt;40&lt;/sub&gt;. Interestingly, the [SCu&lt;sub&gt;54&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;(&lt;sup&gt;t&lt;/sup&gt;BuS)&lt;sub&gt;20&lt;/sub&gt;(NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;] cluster contains 8 free valence electrons in its structure, making it the first eight-electron copper nanocluster stabilized by thiolates. More impressively, the clusters possess an effective photothermal conversion (temperature increases by 71&#8201;&#176;C within ~50&#8197;s, &#955;&lt;sub&gt;ex&lt;/sub&gt;=445&#8197;nm, 0.5&#8197;W&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) in a wide wavelength range (either blue or near-infrared). The photothermal conversion can be even driven under irradiation of simulated sunlight (3 sun), endowing the clusters with great potency in solar energy utilization.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Intramolecular Friedel&#8208;Crafts Acylation of [11C]Isocyanates Enabling the Radiolabeling of [carbonyl&#8208;11C]DPQ</title>

We developed a radiolabeling method for &#945;,&#946;&#8208;aromatic lactams using the PET nuclide carbon&#8208;11. The labeling reactions utilize widely available [11C]CO2 and amine precursors in a quick, robust and automatable one&#8208;pot reaction. The reaction showed a broad substrate scope and was applied to produce the otherwise inaccessible PARP inhibitor tracer [carbonyl&#8208;11C]DPQ, meeting the quality requirements of the European Pharmacopoeia.







Abstract
&#945;,&#946;&#8208;aromatic lactams are highly abundant in biologically active molecules, yet so far they cannot be radiolabeled with short&#8208;lived (t1/2=20.3&#8197;min), &#946;+&#8208;decaying carbon&#8208;11, which has prevented their application as positron emission tomography tracers. Herein, we developed, optimized, and applied a widely applicable, one&#8208;pot, quick, robust and automatable radiolabeling method for &#945;,&#946;&#8208;aromatic lactams starting from [11C]CO2 using the reagent POCl3&#8901;AlCl3. This method proceeds via intramolecular Friedel&#8208;Crafts acylation of in&#8197;situ formed [11C]isocyanates and shows a broad substrate scope for the formation of five&#8208; and six&#8208;membered rings. We implemented our developed labeling method for the radiosynthesis of the potential PARP1 PET tracer [carbonyl&#8208;11C]DPQ in a clinical radiotracer production facility following the standards of the European Pharmacopoeia.

         <title>Enabling High Activation of Glucose&#8208;6&#8208;Phosphate Dehydrogenase Activity Through Liquid Condensate Formation and Compression</title>

Temperature and pressure dependence of the glycolytic G6PDH reaction forming NADPH/PLL droplets as the enzymatic reaction proceeds: Incorporation of the reactants in the droplet phase led to a boost in enzymatic activity, which was most pronounced at medium&#8208;high pressures.







Abstract
Droplet formation via liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation is thought to be involved in the regulation of various biological processes, including enzymatic reactions. We investigated a glycolytic enzymatic reaction, the conversion of glucose&#8208;6&#8208;phosphate to 6&#8208;phospho&#8208;D&#8208;glucono&#8208;1,5&#8208;lactone with concomitant reduction of NADP+ to NADPH both in the absence and presence of dynamically controlled liquid droplet formation. Here, the nucleotide serves as substrate as well as the scaffold required for the formation of liquid droplets. To further expand the process parameter space, temperature and pressure dependent measurements were performed. Incorporation of the reactants in the liquid droplet phase led to a boost in enzymatic activity, which was most pronounced at medium&#8208;high pressures. The crowded environment of the droplet phase induced a marked increase of the affinity of the enzyme and substrate. An increase in turnover number in the droplet phase at high pressure contributed to a further strong increase in catalytic efficiency. Enzyme systems that are dynamically coupled to liquid condensate formation may be the key to deciphering many biochemical reactions. Expanding the process parameter space by adjusting temperature and pressure conditions can be a means to further increase the efficiency of industrial enzyme utilization and help uncover regulatory mechanisms adopted by extremophiles.

Ab initio coupled cluster calculations has identified double M&#246;bius aromaticity in planar neutral four&#8208;membered D2h&#8208;symmetric Rh2B2 and single M&#246;bius three&#8208;membered C2V&#8208;symmetric Rh2B&#8208; rings.

         <title>Three&#8208;Dimensional Self&#8208;Supported Ge Anode for Advanced Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 28, May 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three&#8208;dimensional (3D) self&#8208;supported Ge anode with enlarged surface area, enough spacing, and the shortened ions/electrons transporting path length would greatly facilitate the rapid kinetics and promote more Li ions reversibly stored in the Ge electrode during cycling, thus embrace improved energy&amp;power density and cyclability. This review highlights various strategies of constructing the 3D self&#8208;supported Ge anode and provides future perspectives.







Abstract
Three&#8208;dimensional (3D) self&#8208;supported Ge anode is one of the promising candidates to replace the traditional graphite anode material for high&#8208;performance binder&#8208;free lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). The enlarged surface area and the shortened ions/electrons transporting distance of the 3D electrode would greatly facilitate the rapid transfer of abundant lithium ions during cycling, thus achieve enhanced energy and power density during cycling. Cycle stability of the 3D self&#8208;supported Ge electrode would be improved due to the obtained enough space could effectively accommodate the large volume expansion of the Ge anode. In this review, we first describe the electrochemical properties and Li ions storage mechanism of Ge anode. Moreover, the recent advances in the 3D self&#8208;supported Ge anode architectures design are majorly illustrated and discussed. Challenges and prospects of the 3D self&#8208;supported Ge electrode are finally provided, which shed light on ways to design more reliable 3D Ge&#8208;based electrodes in energy storage systems.

         <title>Mesogenic Ordering&#8211;Driven Self&#8211;Assembly of Liquid Crystalline Block Copolymers in Solution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 28, May 17, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the recent progress in the solution&#8211;state self&#8211;assembly of liquid crystalline block copolymers, including an in&#8211;depth understanding of the mesogenic ordering&#8211;driven self&#8211;assembly, precise assembly methods, utilization of these methods to fabricate hierarchical structures, and the potential applications of these well&#8211;defined nanostructures.







Abstract
With the development of nanotechnology, the preparation of polymeric nanoparticles with nicely defined structures has been well&#8211;developed, and the functionalization and subsequent applications of the resultant nanostructures are becoming increasingly important. Particularly, by introducing mesogenic ordering as the driving force for the solution&#8211;state self&#8211;assembly of liquid crystalline (LC) block copolymers (BCPs), micellar nanostructures with different morphologies, especially anisotropic morphologies, can be easily prepared. This review summarizes the recent progress in the solution&#8211;state self&#8211;assembly of LC BCPs and is mostly focused on four main related aspects, including an in&#8211;depth understanding of the mesogenic ordering&#8211;driven self&#8211;assembly, precise assembly methods, utilization of these methods to fabricate hierarchical structures, and the potential applications of these well&#8211;defined nanostructures. We hope not only to make a systematic summary of previous studies but also to provide some useful thinking for the future development of this field.

Sensitivity enhanced dynamic nuclear polarization solid&#8208;state NMR has opened the door to probing the structures of protein in&#8197;situ at atomic resolution. Here we discuss the methodologies&#8217; state of the art, current bottlenecks, and present possible solutions to the latter ranging from application of novel biochemical approaches to purely spectroscopic considerations.







Abstract
Sensitivity enhanced dynamic nuclear polarization solid&#8208;state NMR is emerging as a powerful technique for probing the structural properties of conformationally homogenous and heterogenous biomolecular species irrespective of size at atomic resolution within their native environments. Herein we detail advancements that have made acquiring such data, specifically within the confines of intact bacterial and eukaryotic cell a reality and further discuss the type of structural information that can presently be garnered by the technique's exploitation. Subsequently, we discuss bottlenecks that have thus far curbed cellular DNP&#8208;ssNMR's broader adoption namely due a lack of sensitivity and spectral resolution. We also explore possible solutions ranging from utilization of new pulse sequences, design of better performing polarizing agents, and application of additional biochemical/ cell biological methodologies.

         <title>Magnetic&#8208;Field&#8208;Induced Spin Regulation in Electrocatalytic Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 28, May 17, 2024. </description>

Recently, magnetic fields have been regarded as an effective tool to modify magnetic domain structure and change the spin multiplicity of electrons during the electrocatalysis process. In this review, we systematically summarize the recent development of spin regulation induced by the magnetic field in electrocatalysis. Finally, we point out the challenges and perspectives in spin&#8208;catalysis.







Abstract
The utilization of a magnetic field to manipulate spin states has emerged as a novel approach to enhance efficiency in electrocatalytic reactions, distinguishing from traditional strategies that focus on tuning activation energy barriers. Currently, this approach is specifically tailored to reactions where spin states change during the catalytic process, such as the oxidation of singlet H2O to triplet O2. In the magnetically enhanced oxygen evolution reaction (OER) procedure, the parallel spin alignment on the ferromagnetic catalyst was induced by the external magnetic field, facilitating the triplet O&#8722;O bonding, which is the rate limiting step in OER. This review centers on recent advancements in harnessing external magnetic fields to enhance OER performance, delving into mechanistic approaches for this magnetic promotion. Additionally, we provide a summary of magnetic field application in other electrocatalytic reactions, including oxygen reduction, methanol oxidation, and CO2 reduction.

         <title>Supramolecular Sequential Light&#8208;Harvesting Systems for Constructing White LED Device and Latent Fingerprint Imaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The fabrication of supramolecular light&#8208;harvesting systems (LHS) with sequential energy transfer is of significance in utilizing light energy. In this study, we report the non&#8208;covalent self&#8208;assembly of a sequential LHS by pillar[5]arene&#8208;based host&#8208;guest interaction in water and its applications in white light&#8208;emitting diode (LED) device and latent fingerprint imaging. The host&#8208;guest complex WP5&#11815;G self&#8208;assembles into nanoparticles in water and shows enhanced aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) effect. The nanoparticles can be further used to construct sequential LHS with fluorescent dyes 4,7&#8208;di(2&#8208;thienyl)&#8208;benzo[2,1,3]thiadiazole (DBT) and sulforhodamine 101 (SR101). Impressively, the system shows white&#8208;light emission when the molar ratio of WP5&#11815;G/DBT/SR101 is 1100/2/16. The material can be coated on a LED bulb to achieve white&#8208;light emission. In addition, the sequential LHS exhibit color&#8208;tunable fluorescence including red emission, which have been successfully applied to high&#8208;resolution imaging of latent fingerprints. Therefore, we demonstrated a general strategy for the construction of sequential LHS in water based on macrocyclic host&#8208;guest interaction and explored its multi&#8208;functional applications in white&#8208;light LED device and imaging of latent fingerprints, which will promote future development and application of supramolecular LHSs.</dc:description>

         <title>A Novel Approach of Electrocatalytic Deamination from Aromatic Amide to Diarylimide on Ni&#8208;PTFE Modified Electrode</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A hydrophobic Ni&#8208;PTFE modified electrode has been prepared by constant current and cathodic electroplating with a nickel sheet as substrate in a PTFE suspension. Then the Ni&#8208;PTFE modified electrode was used for electroreduction from aromatic amide to diarylimide. The electrochemical characterizations such as cyclic voltammogram, EIS, polarization curves, and electrode stability have been carried out by electrochemical workstation. The structure of the electroreduction product diarylimide was characterized by 1HNMR, FT&#8208;IR, MS(Mass Spectrum), and EA(Elemental Analyzer). Based on the hydrophobicity of the electrode, an approach suggested that the phenyl ketone radical may be formed by electroreductive deamination at the cathode. With the construction of C&#8208;N bond by the radical coupling, the electrocatalytic reduction may be comprised of a one&#8208;electron process including an ECC (Electrochemical&#8208;Chemical&#8208;Chemical) process. The electroreduction of aromatic amide to diarylimide may be controlled by both charge migration and concentration polarization. Electrocatalytic reduction of aromatic amides on Ni&#8208;PTFE&#8208;modified electrodes is all well conversion ratio.</dc:description>

         <title>Cleaving Folded RNA by Multifunctional DNAzyme Nanomachines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Both tight and specific binding of folded biological mRNA is required for gene silencing by oligonucleotide gene therapy agents. However, this is fundamentally impossible using the conventional oligonucleotide probes according to the affinity/specificity dilemma. This study addresses this problem by using multicomponent agents (dubbed &#8216;DNA nanomachine&#8217; or DNM) for RNA binding. DNMs bind RNA by four short RNA binding arms, which ensures tight and highly selective RNA binding. Along with the improved affinity, DNM maintained the high sequence selectivity of the conventional DNAzymes. DNM enabled up to 3&#8208;fold improvement in DNAzymes catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) by facilitating both RNA substrate binding and product release steps of the catalytic cycle. This study demonstrates that multicomponent probes organized in sophisticated structures can help to achieve the balance between affinity and selectivity in recognizing folded RNA and thus creates a foundation for applying complex DNA nanostructures in gene therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Rational Design of Coumarin&#8208;Based Hybridized Local and Charge&#8208;Transfer Blue Emitters for Solution&#8208;Processed Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hybridized local and charge&#8208;transfer (HLCT) with the utilization of both singlet and triplet excitons through the "hot excitons" channel have great application potential in highly efficient blue organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). The proportion of charge&#8208;transfer (CT) and locally excited (LE) components in the relevant singlet and triplet states makes a big difference for the high&#8208;lying reverse intersystem crossing process. Herein, three novel donor (D)&#8208;acceptor (A) type HLCT materials, 7&#8208;([1,1'&#8208;biphenyl]&#8208;4&#8208;yl(9,9&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;9H&#8208;fluoren&#8208;2&#8208;yl)amino)&#8208;3&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1H&#8208;isochromen&#8208;1&#8208;one (pPh&#8208;7P), 7&#8208;([1,1'&#8208;biphenyl]&#8208;4&#8208;yl(9,9&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;9H&#8208;fluoren&#8208;2&#8208;yl)amino)&#8208;3&#8208;methyl&#8208;1H&#8208;isochromen&#8208;1&#8208;one (pPh&#8208;7M), and 6&#8208;([1,1'&#8208;biphenyl]&#8208;4&#8208;yl(9,9&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;9H&#8208;fluoren&#8208;2&#8208;yl)amino)&#8208;3&#8208;methyl&#8208;1H&#8208;isochromen&#8208;1&#8208;one (pPh&#8208;6M), were rationally designed and synthesized with diphenylamine derivative as donor and oxygen heterocyclic coumarin moiety as acceptors. The proportions of CT and LE components were fine controlled by changing the connection site of diphenylamine derivative at C6/C7&#8208;position and the substituent at C3&#8208;position of coumarin moiety. The HLCT characteristics of pPh&#8208;7P, pPh&#8208;7M, and pPh&#8208;6M were systematically demonstrated through photophysical properties and density functional theory calculations. The solution&#8208;processed doped OLEDs based on pPh&#8208;6M exhibited deep&#8208;blue electroluminescence with the maximum emission wavelength of 446 nm, maximum luminance of 8755 cd m&#8208;2, maximum current efficiency of 5.83 cd A&#8208;1, and maximum external quantum efficiency of 6.54%. The results reveal that pPh&#8208;6M with dominant 1LE and 3CT components has better OLED performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced Low&#8208;Temperature Resistance of Lithium&#8208;metal Rechargeable Batteries Based on Electrolyte Including Ethyl Acetate and LiDFOB Additives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To meet the demand for higher energy density in lithium&#8208;ion batteries and expand their application range, coupling lithium metal anodes with high&#8208;voltage cathodes is an ideal solution. However, the compatibility between lithium metal batteries and electrolytes affects their applicability. In this study, proposes a locally concentrated electrolyte based on ethyl acetate (EA) as the solvent, lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) as the lithium salt, and lithium difluorooxoborate (LiDFOB) as a sacrificial agent to enhance the low&#8208;temperature and high&#8208;voltage endurance of Li//Lithium cobalt oxide (LCO) batteries. The Li//LCO battery can operate within the voltage range of 3 to 4.5 V, with an initial discharge specific capacity of 174.5 mAh g&#8208;1 at 20 oC. At &#8208;40 oC, after 200 cycles, the capacity retention rate is 87.7%. It can operate under extreme conditions of &#8208;70 oC, with a discharge specific capacity of 112.6 mAh g&#8208;1. Additionally, LCO//HC batteries using this electrolyte demonstrate excellent performance. Present work provides a new perspective for the optimization of electrolytes for low&#8208;temperature lithium&#8208;ion batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Rationalization of a Streptavidin Based Enantioselective Artificial Suzukiase: An Integrative Computational Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An Artificial Metalloenzyme (ArM) built employing the streptavidin&#8208;biotin technology has been used for the enantioselective synthesis of binaphthyls by means of asymmetric Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reactions. Despite its success, it remains a challenge to understand how the length of the biotin cofactors or the introduction of mutations to streptavidin leads the preferential synthesis of one atropisomer over the other. In this study, we apply an integrated computational modeling approach, including DFT calculations, protein&#8208;ligand dockings and molecular dynamics to rationalize the impact of mutations and length of the biotion cofactor on the enantioselectivities of the biaryl product. The results unravel that the enantiomeric differences found experimentally can be rationalized by the disposition of the first intermediate, coming from the oxidative addition step, and the entrance of the second substrate. The work also showcases the difficulties facing to control the enantioselection when engineering ArM to catalyze enantioselective Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura couplings and how the combination of DFT calculations, molecular dockings and MD simulations can be used to rationalize artificial metalloenzymes.</dc:description>

         <title>Nature Products Chlorophyll Derivatives for NIR&#8208;II Fluorescence Bioimaging and Plant&#8208;imaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The second near&#8208;infrared window (NIR&#8208;II, 1000 &#8208; 1700 nm) fluorescence imaging has attracted significant attention in research fields because of its unique advantages compared with conventional optical windows (400 &#8211; 900 nm). A variety of NIR&#8208;II fluorophores have been actively studied because they serve as a key component of fluorescence imaging. Among them, organic small molecule NIR&#8208;II fluorophores display outstanding imaging performance and many advantages, but types of small molecule NIR&#8208;II fluorophores with high biocompatibility are still quite limited. Novel molecular scaffolds based NIR&#8208;II dyes are highly desired. Herein, we hypothesized that chlorophyll is a new promising molecular platform for discovery NIR&#8208;II fluorophores. Thus, seven derivatives of derivatives were selected to characterize their optical properties. Interestingly, six chlorophyll derivatives displayed NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging capability. This characteristic allowed the successful NIR&#8208;II imaging of green leaves of various plants. Furthermore, most of these fluorophores showed capacity to monitor viscosity change because of their sensitive for viscosity. For demonstration of its biomedical applications, these probes were successfully used for NIR&#8208;II fluorescence&#8208;guided surgical resection of lymph nodes. In summary, chlorophylls are novel valuable tool molecules for NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging and have potential to expand their applications in biomedical field and plant science.</dc:description>

         <title>Polydentate Amidinato&#8208;Silylenes, &#8208;Germylenes and &#8208;Stannylenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review article classifies the title compounds into families that differ in the position(s) of the donor group(s) D on the corresponding amidinatotetrylene moiety (E=Si, Ge, Sn), schematically presents the structures of the members of each family, and describes the synthetic approaches utilized for their preparation and their use as ligands in transition metal&#8208;catalysed reactions.







Abstract
This review article focuses on amidinatotetrylenes that potentially can (or have already shown to) behave as bi&#8208; or tridentate ligands because they contain at least one amidinatotetrylene moiety (silylene, germylene or stannylene) and one (or more) additional coordinable fragment(s). Currently, they are being widely used as ligands in coordination chemistry, small molecule activation and catalysis. This review classifies those that have been isolated as transition metal&#8208;free compounds into five families that differ in the position(s) of the donor group(s) (D) on the amidinatotetrylene moiety, namely: ED{R1NC(R2)NR1}, EX{DNC(R2)NR1}, EX{R1NC(D)NR1}, EX{DNC(R2)ND} and E{R1NC(R2)ND}2 (E=Si, Ge or Sn). Those that do not exist as transition metal&#8208;free compounds but have been observed as ligands in transition metal complexes are cyclometallated and ring&#8208;opened amidinatotetrylene ligands. This article presents schematic descriptions of their structures, the approaches used for their syntheses and a quick overview of their involvement (as ligands) in transition metal&#8208;catalysed reactions. The literature is covered up to the end of 2023.

         <title>Elucidating the Binding Mode of Sulfur&#8208; and Selenium&#8208;Based Cationic Chalcogen&#8208;Bond Donors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The noncovalent interaction modes of 2&#8208;chalcogeno&#8208;imidazolium salts have been studied in the solid state, in solution by DOSY, NMR titration and activation experiments, as well as in silico. A combined anion&#8208;&#960; /chalcogen bonding interaction mode prevails for most compounds. For the tellurium derivatives, the pure chalcogen bonding gains in importance, while hydrogen bonding becomes more relevant for the sulfur analogs.







Abstract
For a comparison of the interaction modes of various chalcogen&#8208;bond donors, 2&#8208;chalcogeno&#8208;imidazolium salts have been designed, synthesized, and studied by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, solution NMR and DFT as well as for their ability to act as activators in an SN1&#8208;type substitution reaction. Their interaction modes in solution were elucidated based on NMR diffusion and chemical shift perturbation experiments, which were supported by DFT&#8208;calculations. Our finding is that going from lighter to the heavier chalcogens, hydrogen bonding plays a less, while chalcogen bonding an increasingly important role for the coordination of anions. Anion&#8208;&#960; interactions also show importance, especially for the sulfur and selenium derivatives.

         <title>Selective B(3)&#8208;H Activation Affording Multinuclear Ir(III) Complexes with (o&#8208;Carboranyl)dithioester Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Linkage of two or three o&#8208;carborane moieties was achieved to form a series of carboranyldithioester bridging ligands. Direct B(3)&#8208;H activation on these ligands without the assistance of Ag(I) and alkali was realized with half&#8208;sandwich [Cp*IrCl2]2 and confirmed by single crystal structure analysis. Their SnCl2&#8208;inserted derivatives further confirm the selective B(3)&#8208;H activation.







Abstract
A method was developed to link two or three o&#8208;carborane moieties to form a series of carboranyl dithioester bridging ligands via in&#8197;situ substitution of haloalkanes by tetraphenylphosphonium carboranyldithiocarboxylates. Based on these ligands, direct B&#8722;H activation without the assistance of Ag(I) and alkali was successfully achieved with half&#8208;sandwich Ir(III) substrate [Cp*IrCl2]2 to yield corresponding bimetallic or trimetallic complexes. Single crystal structure analyses of the B&#8722;H activated complexes and corresponding SnCl2&#8208;inserted derivatives confirm the selective B(3)&#8208;H activation in these complexes.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A method was developed to link two or three &lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-carborane moieties to form a series of carboranyl dithioester bridging ligands &lt;i&gt;via in&#8197;situ&lt;/i&gt; substitution of haloalkanes by tetraphenylphosphonium carboranyldithiocarboxylates. Based on these ligands, direct B&#8722;H activation without the assistance of Ag(I) and alkali was successfully achieved with half-sandwich Ir(III) substrate [Cp*IrCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to yield corresponding bimetallic or trimetallic complexes. Single crystal structure analyses of the B&#8722;H activated complexes and corresponding SnCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-inserted derivatives confirm the selective B(3)-H activation in these complexes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Smartphone&#8208;Based Sensing of Cortisol by Functionalized Rhodamine Probes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cortisol detection by optical Strip Test, based on fluorescent rhodamine probes properly functionalized to interact by non&#8208;covalent interactions with cortisol, is here described. Furthermore, we used a smartphone as detector, obtaining a prototype for the monitoring cortisol levels in real life.







Abstract
During a stress condition, the human body synthesizes catecholamine neurotransmitters and specific hormones (called &#8220;stress hormones&#8221;), the most important of which is cortisol. The monitoring of cortisol levels should be extremely important to control the stress levels, and for this reason, it shows important medical applications. The common analytical methods (HPLC, GC&#8208;MS) cannot be used in real life, due to the bulky size of the instruments and the necessity of specialized personnel. Molecular probes solve these problems due to their fast and easy use. The synthesis of new fluorescent rhodamine probes, able to interact by non&#8208;covalent interactions with cortisol, the recognition properties in solution as well as in solid state by Strip Test, using a smartphone as detector, are here reported. DFT calculations and FT&#8208;IR measurements suggest the formation of supramolecular complexes through hydrogen bonds as main non&#8208;covalent interaction. The present study represents one of the first sensor, based on synthetical chemical receptors, able to detect cortisol in a linear range from 1&#8197;mM to 1&#8197;pM, based on non&#8208;covalent molecular recognition and paves the way to the realization of practical point&#8208;of&#8208;care device for the monitoring of cortisol in real live.

         <title>Kinetic Trapping of an Out&#8208;of&#8208;Equilibrium Dynamic Library of Imines by Changing Solvent</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
When an Activated Carboxylic Acid (ACA) is employed to perturb a dynamic library of imines, the nature of the solvent has a crucial role in defining the non&#8208;equilibrium state of such library. A dissipative dynamic library in CD2Cl2, fully coupled with the decarboxylation of the ACA, or a kinetically trapped out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium dynamic library in CD3CN can be generated.







Abstract
A well&#8208;behaved dynamic library composed of two imines and corresponding amines was subjected to the action of an activated carboxylic acid (ACA), whose decarboxylation is known to be base promoted, in different solvents, namely CD2Cl2, CD3CN, and mixtures of them. Two non&#8208;equilibrium systems are consequently obtained: i)&#8197;a dissipative (CD2Cl2) and ii)&#8197;an out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium (CD3CN) dynamic library whose composition goes back to equilibrium after a given time. In the former case, the library is fully coupled with the decarboxylation of the ACA, while in the latter, an energy ratchet operates. In the mixed solvents, the library exhibits a mediated behavior. Interestingly, in the presence of an excess of added ACA, the different behavior of the imine library in the two solvents is expected to manifest only when the excess acid is consumed.

         <title>Real&#8208;time LSPR&#8208;based study of metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) growth</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>MOFs are known for their absorption properties and widely used for accumulation, filtering, sensorics, photothermal, catalytical and other applications. Their combination with plasmonic metal nanoparticles leads to hybrid structures that profit from the stabilizing effect and high porosity of the MOF as well as the optical and electronic properties of the nanoparticles. The growth of MOFs on plasmonic nanoparticles can be monitored in&#8208;situ using LSPR spectroscopy, simultaneously applying microfluidic reaction conditions for the fabrication of NP@MOF structures. Here, a systematic study is conducted using LSPR spectroscopy for the monitoring of the Layer&#8208;by&#8208;Layer deposition of twelve different MOFs, determining the suitability of LSPR spectroscopy for this purpose. In addition to some well&#8208;investigated materials like HKUST&#8208;1, other MOFs such as MIL&#8208;53, MIL&#8208;88A and Cu&#8208;BDC are deposited successfully. For some MOFs such as Zn&#8208;Fum, the LSPR experiment indicates that no deposition had taken place. The results are confirmed with AFM, SEM and XPS measurements. This work shows that LSPR spectroscopy is suitable for the in&#8208;situ monitoring of LbL MOF growth and the microfluidic setup is a promising method for the controlled manufacturing of NP@MOF hybrid structures. Further studies may include optimization of the synthesis process or transfer to other materials.</dc:description>

Abstract
Understanding diversity is the foundation for progress on inclusion. Diversity covers a wide range of characteristics, not just gender. Does the training meet the current needs of the workplace? What role does gender discrimination play in the chemical workforce? To what extent are partners treated equally when caring for a family member? Three Employment Surveys for European Chemists (ESEC1 &#8211; ESEC3) were conducted between 2013 and 2020. The online questionnaires were open to chemists from all countries. 9747 responses were collected for all three surveys together. The reports for ESEC1 and ESEC2 are freely available.[1,2] The questionnaires from ESEC1 to ESEC3 were continuously adapted to reflect the latest discussions in our societies, for example diversity, which was specifically addressed in ESEC3. The results are reported here. The Royal Society of Chemistry asked similar questions.[3] Graduates from the last 15&#8197;years are particularly important for two reasons. They are the largest group of ESEC participants, with 59&#8201;% of the responses, and they represent the labour market with the greatest future prospects. Their situation is of particular importance for real decisions about the chemistry labour market. For this reason, the current report focuses exclusively on graduates of the last 15&#8197;years.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding diversity is the foundation for progress on inclusion. Diversity covers a wide range of characteristics, not just gender. Does the training meet the current needs of the workplace? What role does gender discrimination play in the chemical workforce? To what extent are partners treated equally when caring for a family member? Three Employment Surveys for European Chemists (ESEC1 &#8211; ESEC3) were conducted between 2013 and 2020. The online questionnaires were open to chemists from all countries. 9747 responses were collected for all three surveys together. The reports for ESEC1 and ESEC2 are freely available.&lt;sup&gt;[1,2]&lt;/sup&gt; The questionnaires from ESEC1 to ESEC3 were continuously adapted to reflect the latest discussions in our societies, for example diversity, which was specifically addressed in ESEC3. The results are reported here. The Royal Society of Chemistry asked similar questions.&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt; Graduates from the last 15&#8197;years are particularly important for two reasons. They are the largest group of ESEC participants, with 59&#8201;% of the responses, and they represent the labour market with the greatest future prospects. Their situation is of particular importance for real decisions about the chemistry labour market. For this reason, the current report focuses exclusively on graduates of the last 15&#8197;years.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
What are the country&#8208;specific differences in the education of chemistry students across the EU? How do students&#8217; preferred careers change with the level of their qualifications? Do students have sufficient information to make good career choices? Which media are now considered most effective for job searches? What do students currently consider to be a successful career?
Three Employment Surveys for European Chemists (ESEC1&#8722;ESEC3) were conducted between 2013 and 2020. The web&#8208;based questionnaires were open to chemists from all countries. A total of 9747 responses were received. The reports for ESEC1 and ESEC2 are freely available.[1,2] Subsequent questionnaires have been continuously adapted to reflect the latest discussions in our societies. In particular, ESEC3 focused on students&#8217; careers. The results are reported here. Where results from earlier surveys are included, this is explicitly stated.
Graduates of the last 15&#8197;years are particularly important for two reasons. They represent the largest group of ESEC participants, with 59&#8201;% of the responses, and they represent the labour market with the greatest future prospects. Their situation is of particular importance for real decisions about the chemistry labour market. For this reason, this report focuses exclusively on graduates of the last 15&#8197;years.

         <dc:description>Tunable photoluminescence (PL) is one of the hot topics in current materials science, and research performed on the molecular phases is at the forefront of this field. We present the new (Et4N)2[PtII(bph)(CN)2]&#183;rez3&#183;1/3H2O (Pt2rez3) (bph = biphenyl&#8208;2,2&#8217;&#8208;diyl; rez3 = 3,3&#8221;,5,5&#8221;&#8208;tetrahydroxy&#8208;1,1&#8217;:4&#8217;,1&#8221;&#8208;terphenyl,&#160;phenylene&#8208;1,4&#8208;diresorcinol coformer, a linear quaternary hydrogen bond donor) co&#8208;crystal salt based on the recently appointed promising [PtII(bph)(CN)2]2&#8211; luminophore. Within the extended hydrogen&#8208;bonded subnetwork [PtII(bph)(CN)2]2&#8211; complexes and rez3 coformer molecules form two types of contacts: the&#160; rez3O&#8208;H&#183;&#183;&#183;Ncomplex ones in the equatorial plane of the complex and non&#8208;typical rez3O&#8208;H&#183;&#183;&#183;Pt ones along its axial direction. The combined structural, PL, and DFT approach distinguished the rez3O&#8208;H&#183;&#183;&#183;Pt synthons to promote the noticeable uniform redshift of bph ligand centered (LC) emission compared to the LC emission of (Et4N)2[PtII(bph)(CN)2]&#183;H2O (Pt2) precursor owing to the direct interference of the phenol group into the PtII&#8208;bph orbital system via altering the CT processes. The high&#8208;resolution emission spectra for Pt2 and Pt2rez3 were successfully reproduced at 77 K by using the Franck&#8208;Cordon expressions. The possibility to tune PL properties along the plausible continuum of rez3O&#8208;H&#183;&#183;&#183;Pt synthons is indicated, considering various scenarios of molecular occupation of the space above and below the complex plane.</dc:description>

         <title>Low&#8208;lying LUMO Boosts Conductance in Antiaromatic Dibenzopentalene Versus Aromatic Analogues</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Antiaromaticity is a fundamental concept in chemistry, but the study of molecular wires incorporating antiaromatic units is limited. Despite initial predictions, very few studies show that antiaromaticity has a beneficial effect on electron transport. Dibenzo[a,e]pentalene (DBP) is a stable structure that displays appreciable antiaromaticity within the five&#8208;membered rings of the pentalene core. We have investigated derivatives of DBP furnished with pyridyl (Py) and F4&#8208;pyridyl (PyF4) anchor groups, and compared the conductance with purely aromatic phenyl and anthracene analogues. We find that the low&#8208;bias conductance of DBP&#8208;Py is approximately 60% larger than that of the anthracene analogue Anth&#8208;Py and 250% larger compared to the phenyl derivative Ph&#8208;Py. This is due to a better alignment of the LUMO with the gold Fermi level, which we confirm by conductance&#8208;voltage spectroscopy where the conductance of DBP&#8208;Py shows the greatest voltage&#8208;dependence. The F4&#8208;pyridyl compounds, which have lower LUMO energies compared to the pyridyl analogues, did not, however, form detectable molecular junctions. The strongly electron&#8208;withdrawing fluorine atoms reduce the donor capability of the nitrogen lone&#8208;pair to the point where stable N&#8208;Au bonds no longer form</dc:description>

         <title>Backbone Modification in a Protein Hydrophobic Core</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Targeted protein backbone modification can recreate tertiary structures reminiscent of folds found in nature on artificial scaffolds with improved biostability. Incorporation of altered monomers in such entities is typically limited to sites distant from the hydrophobic core to avoid potential disruptions to folding. This is limiting, as it is advantageous in some applications to incorporate artificial connectivity at buried sites. Here, we report an examination of protein backbone modification targeted specifically to hydrophobic core positions and its impacts on tertiary folded structure and fold stability. Different artificial monomer types are placed at core, core&#8208;flanking, or solvent&#8208;exposed positions in a compact three&#8208;helix protein. Effects on structure and folding energetics are assessed by NMR spectroscopy and biophysical methods. Results show that artificial residues can be well accommodated in the hydrophobic core of a defined tertiary fold, with effects on stability only modestly larger than identical changes at solvent&#8208;exposed sites. Collectively, these results provide new insights into folding behavior of protein&#8208;like artificial chains as well as strategies for the design of such molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Unusually short H&#183;&#183;&#183;H contacts in intramolecularly cyclized helically fused anthracenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The intramolecular coupling of dichloro&#8208;substituted helically fused anthracenes using the Yamamoto coupling yielded cyclized products with sterically congested molecular structures. The X&#8208;ray analysis and DFT calculations showed that the aromatic framework adopted a nonplanar structure with a twisted conformation about the newly formed single bond, which acts as a chiral axis. Interestingly, the X&#8208;ray structure obtained through the Hirshfeld atom refinement revealed short interatomic distances between the inner hydrogen atoms (1.648&#8211;1.692 &#197;), much shorter than the sum of their van der Waals radii. Owing to these unusually short contacts, the 1H NMR spectrum exhibited a significant deshielding (12.5 ppm) and a large nuclear Overhauser effect (44%). Additionally, the IR spectrum displayed a high&#8208;frequency shift of the C&#8211;H stretching vibration. These observations, along with the noncovalent interaction plot indicative of a characteristic steric environment, strongly support the presence of steric hindrance. Moreover, dynamic NMR measurement of the mesityl&#8208;substituted derivative yielded a barrier to helical inversion of 84 kJ mol&#8722;1. The optical properties and crystal packing of the cyclized products are also reported.</dc:description>

         <title>The Mechanism of Guerbet Reaction by Metal Ligand Cooperation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Guerbet reaction is important for the synthesis of longer&#8208;chain monoalcohols like isobutanol through catalytic transfer hydrogenation from short&#8208;chain methanol and ethanol. However, the mechanism becomes complicated, especially considering the variations in the different metal&#8208;ligand cooperation (MLC) catalysts used. In order to further understand the Guerbet reaction, DFT studies were performed to figure out the detailed mechanism initiated by the unique Mn&#8208;PCP MLC Catalyst. Our results suggest that even with the assistance of the carbanion site of the PCP ligand, the direct substitution mechanism is less favored than the condensation&#8208;reduction mechanism. The key step of the reaction is the final reduction of the carbonyl, in which the 1,4&#8208;reduction of the unsaturated aldehyde is prior to the 3,4&#8208;reduction or 1,2&#8208;reduction due to the stronger interaction between the catalyst and the substrate. It is found that the production of isobutanol is preferred over n&#8208;butanol because of the lower total free energy barrier and lower relative free energy of the product. Finally, by changing the electronic effect of the carbanion site of the catalyst, we found that the relation between the electronic effect and the highest free energy span was not monotonous and a point with optimal electronic effect exists numerically.</dc:description>

         <title>Photo&#8208;triggered Phase Transition of Crystals and Photoactuation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photo&#8208;triggered phase transition is a new type of phase transition in which a photochromic crystal with a thermal phase transition transforms into an identical high&#8208;temperature phase in a temperature region lower than the thermal phase transition temperature upon light irradiation. Here, we report a second crystal that exhibits a photo&#8208;triggered phase transition, thereby demonstrating that the photo&#8208;triggered phase transition is a general phenomenon that occurs in crystals. When the chiral salicylidenephenylethylamine crystal was irradiated with ultraviolet (UV) light, the photo&#8208;triggered phase transition occurred in the temperature range &#8211;30 to &#8211;10&#176;C. The photo&#8208;triggered phase transition is induced by local stress due to trans&#8208;keto molecules produced by photoisomerization near the irradiated surface. Crystal cantilevers exhibited stepwise bending by the combination of the photo&#8208;triggered phase transition and photoisomerization. Alternate irradiation with UV and visible light achieved locomotion of single crystals driven by repeated stepwise bending. Finally, a detailed comparison of photo&#8208;triggered and non&#8208;photo&#8208;triggered phase transition crystals revealed that a sufficient molecular conformation change in affordable crystal voids, smooth photoisomerization, and most likely a chiral molecular arrangement are required for inducing the photo&#8208;triggered phase transition.</dc:description>

         <title>Linkage&#8208;Mediated Electronic Structure Modulation in Multicomponent Covalent Organic Frameworks for Dramatically Promoted Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Linkage chemistry is an essential aspect to covalent organic framework (COF) applications; it is highly desirable to precisely modulate electronic structure mediated directly by linkage for efficient COF&#8208;based photocatalytic hydrogen evolution, which however, remains substantially challenging. Herein, as a proof of concept, a collection of robust multicomponent pyrene&#8208;based COFs with abundant donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) interactions has been judiciously designed and synthesized through molecularly engineering linkage for photogeneration of hydrogen. Controlled locking and conversion of linkage critically contribute to continuously regulating COFs&#8217; electronic structures further to optimize photocatalytic activities. Remarkably, the well&#8208;modulated optoelectronic properties turn on the average hydrogen evolution rate from zero to 15.67&#160;mmol g&#8208;1&#160;h&#8208;1&#160;by the protonated quinoline&#8208;linked COF decorated with the trifluoromethyl group (TT&#8208;PQCOF&#8208;CF3). Using diversified spectroscopy and theoretical calculations, we show that&#160;multiple modifications toward linkage&#160;synergistically lead to the redistribution of charge on COFs with extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation and reinforced D&#8208;A effect, making TT&#8208;PQCOF&#8208;CF3&#160;a promising material with significantly boosted carrier separation and migration.&#160;This study provides important guidance for the design of high&#8208;performance COF photocatalysts based on the strategy of linkage&#8208;mediated electronic structure modulation&#160;in COFs.</dc:description>

         <title>Crystalline CdS/amorphous Cd(OH)2 Composite for Electrochemical CO2 Reduction to CO in a Wide Potential Window</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemical CO2 reduction is a promising method for converting atmospheric CO2 into valuable low&#8208;carbon chemicals. In this study, a crystalline cadmium sulfide/amorphous cadmium hydroxide composite was successfully deposited on the carbon paper substrate surface by in&#8208;situ chemical bath deposition (named as c&#8208;CdS/a&#8208;Cd(OH)2/CP electrodes) for the efficient electrochemical CO2 reduction to produce CO. The c&#8208;CdS/a&#8208;Cd(OH)2/CP electrode exhibited high CO Faradaic efficiencies (&gt;90%) under a wide potential window of 1.0 V, with the highest value reaching ~100% at the applied potential ranging from &#8722;2.16 V to &#8722;2.46 V vs. ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+), superior to the crystalline counterpart c&#8208;CdS/CP and c&#8208;CdS/c&#8208;Cd(OH)2@CP electrodes. Meanwhile, the CO partial current density reached up to 154.7 mA cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;2.76 V vs. Fc/Fc+ on the c&#8208;CdS/a&#8208;Cd(OH)2/CP electrode. The excellent performance of this electrode was mainly ascribed to its special three&#8208;dimensional structure and the introduction of a&#8208;Cd(OH)2. These structures could provide more active sites, accelerate the charge transfer, and enhance adsorption of *COOH intermediates, thereby improving the CO selectivity. Moreover, the electrolytes consisting of 1&#8208;butyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate and acetonitrile also enhanced the reaction kinetics of electrochemical CO2 reduction to CO.</dc:description>

         <title>Classical versus Collective Interactions in Asymmetric Trigonal Bipyramidal Alkaline Metal&#8211;Boron Halide Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
C3v&#8208;M2BX3 complexes (M=Li, Na, and K; X=F, Cl, and Br) may form in reduction of BX3 via alkali metals. In M2BX3 species a collective and a normal bond form simultaneously. Bond dissociation energies prove that the collective bond is more stable than the normal bond. Here, isodensity surface of Laplacian of electron density shows electron concentration regions in K2BBr3.







Abstract
Collective interactions are a novel type of chemical bond formed between metals and electron&#8208;rich substituents around an electron&#8208;poor central atom. So far only a limited number of candidates for having collective interactions are reported. In this work, we extend the newly introduced concept of collective bonding to a series of neutral boron complexes with the general formula M2BX3 (M=Li, Na, and K; X=F, Cl, and Br). Our state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art ab initio computations suggest that these complexes form trigonal bipyramidal structures with a D3h to C3v distortion along the C3 axis of symmetry. The BX3 unit in the complexes distorts from planar to pyramidal akin to a sp3 hybridized atom. Interestingly, the interaction of the metals with the pyramidal side of BX3, where the lone pair in a hypothetical [BX3]2&#8722; should be located, is weaker than the interactions of metals with the inverted side, i.&#8201;e., the middle of three halogen atoms. The origin of this stronger interaction can be explained by the formation of collective interactions between metals and halogen atoms as we explored via energy decomposition within the context of the theory of interacting quantum atoms, IQA.

In this work, we extend the newly introduced concept of collective bonding to a series of neutral boron complexes with the general formula M&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;BX&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (M=Li, Na, and K; X=F, Cl, and Br). Our state-of-the-art ab initio computations suggest that these complexes form trigonal bipyramidal structures with a D&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;3h&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; to C&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;3v&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; distortion along the C&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;3&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; axis of symmetry. The BX&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; unit in the complexes distorts from planar to pyramidal akin to a sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; hybridized atom. Interestingly, the interaction of the metals with the pyramidal side of BX&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, where the lone pair in a hypothetical [BX&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; should be located, is weaker than the interactions of metals with the inverted side, i.&#8201;e., the middle of three halogen atoms. The origin of this stronger interaction can be explained by the formation of collective interactions between metals and halogen atoms as we explored via energy decomposition within the context of the theory of interacting quantum atoms, IQA.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Total Chemical Synthesis of Aggregation&#8208;Prone Disulfide&#8208;Rich Starfish Peptides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a comprehensive synthetic strategy for creating relaxin&#8208;like peptides characterized by a two&#8208;chain structure linked by three disulfide bonds. Utilizing Fmoc solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis, the A&#8208; and B&#8208;chains are independently assembled with orthogonal cysteine protecting groups (tBu, Acm, Trt) to facilitate the controlled formation of disulfide bonds. The synthesis proceeds through four key steps: (i.) Oxidation of the A&#8208;chain to establish the intramolecular disulfide bond; (ii.) Conversion of Cys(tBu) to a more reactive Cys(SPyr) derivative; (iii.) Thiolysis&#8208;driven combination of A&#8208; and B&#8208;chain to form the first inter&#8208;chain disulfide bond; and (iv.) Final disulfide bond formation via iodine oxidation, culminating in the production of the fully assembled peptide.







Abstract
A relaxin&#8208;like gonad&#8208;stimulating peptide (RGP), Aso&#8208;RGP, featuring six cysteine residues, was identified in the Crown&#8208;of&#8208;Thorns Starfish (COTS, Acanthaster cf. solaris) and initially produced through recombinant yeast expression. This method yielded a single&#8208;chain peptide with an uncleaved C&#8208;peptide (His Tag) and suboptimal purity. Our objective was to chemically synthesize Aso&#8208;RGP in its mature form, comprising two chains (A and B) and three disulfide bridges, omitting the C&#8208;peptide. Furthermore, we aimed to synthesize a newly identified relaxin&#8208;like peptide, Aso&#8208;RLP2, from COTS, which had not been previously synthesized. This paper reports the first total chemical synthesis of Aso&#8208;RGP and Aso&#8208;RLP2. Aso&#8208;RGP synthesis proceeded without major issues, whereas the A&#8208;chain of Aso&#8208;RLP2, in its reduced and unfolded state with two free thiols, presented considerable challenges. These were initially marked by &#8220;messy&#8221; RP&#8208;HPLC profiles, typically indicative of synthesis failure. Surprisingly, oxidizing the A&#8208;chain significantly improved the RP&#8208;HPLC profile, revealing the main issue was not synthesis failure but the peptide's aggregation tendency, which initially obscured analysis. This discovery highlights the critical need to account for aggregation in peptide synthesis and analysis. Ultimately, our efforts led to the successful synthesis of both peptides with purities exceeding 95&#8201;%.

         <title>Heterocycle&#8208; and Amine&#8208;Free Electrochromic and Electrofluorochromic Molecules for Energy&#8208;Saving See&#8208;Through Smart Windows and Displays</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochromic (EC) smart windows are an elegant alternative to dusty curtains, blinds, and traditional dimming devices. The EC energy storage smart windows and displays received remarkable attention in the optoelectronic industry as they hold promise for high energy efficiency, low power consumption, reversibility, and swift response to stimuli. However, achieving these properties remains challenging. Moreover, most EC molecules do not exhibit electrofluorochromism, which is highly essential for smart displays because its EC property can modulate the solar heat entering the building, and its electrofluorochromic (EFC) aspects can create lighting during the night. In this work, a structure&#8208;property relationship is utilized to develop new electrochromes that can store the injected charge, and these molecules indeed exhibit electrofluorochromism. The compounds are synthesized from tetrabenzofluorene with two aromatic acceptor units, and avoids the use of widely studied heterocycles and amine derivatives. The electrochromes switches from yellow to dark hue in solution, solid, and gel state. The compounds display exceptional electrochemical stability and reversibility in 1000 cycles and capacity retention of 93&#8208;100% in 300 charging&#8208;discharging cycles. The proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept device fabrication of the self&#8208;dimming EC smart window presented here demonstrates that it can furnish visual comfort, modulate transmitted light and glare, and reduce energy usage.</dc:description>

         <title>A Mechanistic Spectrum of O&#8208;H Bond Cleavage Observed for Reactions of Phenols with a Manganese Superoxo Complex</title>

Intriguingly, the reactions of 1 with 4&#8208;chlorophenol and 4&#8208;methoxyphenol follow two routes of CPET and sequential proton and electron transfer to furnish complex 2 in the end.

         <title>Chiral Diselenophosphoric Acids for Ion Pair Catalysis: A Novel Approach to Enhance Both Proton Donating and Proton Accepting Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The activation of poorly reactive substrates via strong chiral acids is a central topic in asymmetric ion pair catalysis these days. Despite highly successful scaffolds such as N&#8208;triflylphosphoramides, these catalysts either lack C2&#8208;symmetry or provide multiple H&#8208;bond acceptor sites, leading to lower ee values for certain reactions. We present BINOL&#8208;based diselenophosphoric acids (DSA) as an extremely promising alternative. Using an intertwined approach of synthesis and NMR studies, we developed a synthetic approach to DSA with up to 98% NMR yield. The obtained acids provide both very high proton donor and proton acceptor properties, a bifunctionality, which is key to catalytic applications. Indeed, first reactivity test proved the much higher acidity of DSA and its ability to initiate Mukaiyama&#8211;Mannich reaction and protodesilylation of silyl ethers. Together with their C2&#8208;symmetry, the single donor and single acceptor situation, the decreased tendency of self&#8208;association, and the straightforward synthesis with potential 3,3&#8217;&#8208;substitution, the DSA provide all features ideal for the further development of ion pair catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced Near&#8208;infrared Phosphorescent Emission Modulated by Clipping of Metallotweezers in Aqueous Media</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Near&#8208;infrared phosphorescent materials have received significant attention due to their potential applications in bioimaging and diagnostics. Although, many types of organic phosphors with near&#8208;infrared emission have been developed, the low phosphorescence efficiency in aqueous solution hampers their practical applications in biological systems. Hence, there is an urgent need to develop near&#8208;infrared phosphorescent materials with high emission efficiency in aqueous media. Metallotweezers, based on d8 transition metal complexes, emerge as the potential candidates for realizing this objective. Specifically, metallotweezers, featuring two positively charged platinum(II) terpyridine and neutral gold(III) diphenylpyridine pincers on diphenylpyridine spacer, have been designed and synthesized, respectively. The pre&#8208;organization effect, rendered by the rigid spacer, enables the resulting metallotweezers to complex with each other, resulting in the formation of clipping complex. The synergistic rigidifying and shielding effects of clipping structure results in enhanced phosphorescent emission intensity. Concurrently, due to phase segregation between the clipping units and the polyethylene glycol tail, the clipping complex undergoes self&#8208;assembly in aqueous solution, resulting in phosphorescent emission in the near&#8208;infrared region. Overall, non&#8208;covalent clipping of metallotweezers illustrated in this study presents a new and effective approach toward near&#8208;infrared phosphorescent materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Thixotropic Composite Hydrogel Electrode Composed of a Polymer Hydrogelator and Water&#8208;Dispersive Tungsten Oxide Flat Microparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here, we introduce an organic/inorganic composite hydrogel as a versatile gel electrode material. This composite hydrogel was formed by simply mixing an aqueous solution of flat microparticles of tungsten oxide, exhibiting superior water dispersibility, with a hydrogel composed of a water&#8208;soluble polyaramide&#8208;based polymer hydrogelator. The resulting composite hydrogel exhibited uniform dispersion of tungsten oxide flat particles throughout the hydrogel matrix, supplementing the structure formed by the polymer hydrogelator. It maintained the gel&#8208;forming capability and thixotropic behavior inherent to the polymer hydrogelator while showcasing the electrochemical characteristics of tungsten oxide. With its spreadability and applicability to various electrode shapes, a composite hydrogel is presented as a potential spreadable gel electrode material.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanical Bond Induced Enhancement and Purification of Pyrene Emission in the Solid State</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To address key concerns on solid&#8208;state pyrene&#8208;based luminescent materials, we propose a novel and efficient mechanical bond strategy. This strategy results in a transformation from aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) to aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) effect and a remarkable enhancement of pyrene emission in the solid state. More importantly, an unusual purification of emission is also achieved. Through computational calculation and experimental characterization, finally determined by X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis, we prove that the excellent emissions result from the refined molecular arrangements, including reduced &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking, well&#8208;ordered packing and enhanced structural stability. This work demonstrates the potential of mechanical bond in the field of organic luminescent molecules, providing a new avenue for developing high&#8208;performance organic luminescent materials and beyond.</dc:description>

         <title>Rapid access to divergent fused polycycles via one&#8208;pot A3 coupling and intramolecular Diels&#8208;Alder reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Divergent nitrogen&#8208;containing fused polycyclic ring systems are constructed from simple starting materials via a one&#8208;pot aldehyde&#8208;alkyne&#8208;amine (A3) coupling and intramolecular Diels&#8208;Alder reaction. This domino reaction directly furnishes linear 5/5/5 and 5/5/6, or nonlinear 5/5/6/5, polycyclic rings containing an oxa&#8208;bridged fused 5/5 bicycle and a 1,6&#8208;enyne substructure. One&#8208;step derivation of the oxa&#8208;bridged 5/5 bicycle leads to a polyfunctionalized 5/5 bicycle with tetrahydrofuran fused back&#8208;to&#8208;back to pyrroline or a 6/5 bicycle with the hexahydro&#8208;1H&#8208;isoindole structure, while cycloisomerizing the enyne substructure adds an extra fused 5&#8208;membered ring to afford functionalized linear 5/5/5/5 or 5/5/5/5/5 fused ring systems from selected substrates. In addition, the one&#8208;pot product can be designed so that the alkyne moiety is hydroalkoxylated to form an additional heterocyle in a linear 5/5/5/6 or nonlinear 5/5/6/5/5 ring system. This diversity&#8208;oriented synthetic approach thus allows rapid access to an under&#8208;explored structural space for discovery of new biological or non&#8208;biological activities or functions.</dc:description>

         <title>Unusual Photochemistry in Aromatic Dithioimides: Quantitative Thione Reduction Promoted by Ether Solvents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a mechanistic investigation of an aromatic dithioimide (2SS) displaying puzzling yet efficient photochemistry in ether solvents. Perplexingly, 2SS dissolved in ether solvents in a sealed and degassed vial was photochemically converted to the corresponding diimide (2OO), as determined by 1H NMR following product extraction. With no external sources of oxygen in the sample, could the oxygen in 2OO be from the ether itself? To study this unprecedented proposition, we attempt to uncover the ether&#8217;s involvement in this reaction. As seen by laser&#8208;flash photolysis, 2SS appears to first react with the solvent from its singlet excited state. Following the reaction by NMR under rigorously oxygen&#8208; and water&#8208;free conditions led to the identification of a photoreductive pathway that quantitatively transformed one thione into a methylene to yield 2SH2. Subsequent oxidation of 2SH2 or irradiation of 2SS under air proved that molecular oxygen was indeed necessary to observe an oxidative pathway leading to 2OO, ruling out the initially proposed involvement of an ether oxygen. An explanation of 2SS desulfurization was further revealed through the study of solvent by&#8208;products by GC&#8208;MS analysis. Supported by DFT calculations, a mechanism is proposed to involve a chain reaction initiated by photochemically generated ether radical.</dc:description>

         <title>Polymorphism Dependent Cytotoxicity, Cellular Uptake, and Live Cell Imaging Studies on Napthalimide&#8208;Vinyl&#8208;Phenothiazine Conjugate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymorphs serve as excellent models for illustrating the relationship between structure and properties, given their distinction lies primarily in the arrangement of constituents within a 3D lattice. While numerous researchers leverage this concept to elucidate the influence of molecular structure on chemical and physical properties, there remains a dearth of exploration into their biological response. This study presents two luminescent polymorphs, 1Y and 1R, identified as ideal candidates for observing polymorph&#8208;dependent cellular uptake and cytotoxicity using straightforward fluorescence microscopy techniques.







Abstract
Polymorphism&#8208;dependent cytotoxicity and cellular uptake of drug molecules have been studied for the past two decades. However, the visualization of polymorph&#8208;dependent cellular uptake and cytotoxicity using microscopy imaging techniques has not yet been reported. The luminescent polymorph is an ideal candidate to validate the above hypothesis. Herein, we report the polymorph&#8208;dependent cellular uptake, cytotoxicity, and bio&#8208;imaging functions of polymorphs 1Y and 1R of a naphthalimide&#8208;phenothiazine dyad. These polymorphs show different luminescence colors in the solid state and exhibit aggregation&#8208;induced enhanced emission (AIEE) in the DMSO&#8208;Water mixture. Bioimaging, cytotoxicity assay, and fluorescence&#8208;activated cell sorting (FACS) studies revealed that these polymorphs show different levels of cytotoxicity, cellular uptake, localization, and imaging potential. Detailed photophysical, morphological, and biological studies revealed that the difference in molecular conformation in these polymorphs enables them to form aggregates of different sizes and morphology, which leads to the differential uptake of these into the cells and consequently shows different cytotoxicity and imaging potentials.

         <title>Inducing &#945;&#8208;Helicity in Peptides by Silver Coordination to Cysteine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular switch based on metal complexation of peptides is here presented. The highly ordered dimeric &#945;&#8208;helical complexes are obtained by adding silver ions to specific peptide motifs containing two cysteine residues. The dynamic formation of these surprisingly stable complexes has been characterized by chromatographic, spectroscopic, potentiometric and mass spectrometric methods.







Abstract
Short peptide sequences consisting of two cysteine residues separated by three other amino acids display complete change from random coil to &#945;&#8208;helical secondary structure in response to addition of Ag+ ions. The folded CXXXC/Ag+ complex involves formation of multinuclear Ag+ species and is stable in a wide pH range from below 3 to above 8. The complex is stable through reversed&#8208;phase HPLC separation as well as towards a physiological level of chloride ions, based on far&#8208;UV circular dichroism spectroscopy. In electrospray MS under acidic conditions a peptide dimer with four Ag+ ions bound was observed, and modelling based on potentiometric experiments supported this to be the dominating complex at neutral pH together with a peptide dimer with 3&#8197;Ag+ and one proton at lower pH. The complex was demonstrated to work as a N&#8208;terminal nucleation site for inducing &#945;&#8208;helicity into longer peptides. This type of silver&#8208;mediated peptide assembly and folding may be of more general use for stabilizing not only peptide folding but also for controlling oligomerization even under acidic conditions.

         <title>Unidentical Twins: Geometrically Similar but Chemically Distinct Metal&#8208;Free Sites in Boron Oxide for Methane Oxidation to HCHO, CO and CO2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unidentical Twins: The B2O3 surface contains various geometrically similar sites to carry out methane oxidation in presence of dioxygen. Computational descriptors were employed to distinct these identical twin sites. In methane oxidation, the rate&#8208;determining step for one site is the co&#8208;activation of dioxygen and methane, whereas formaldehyde formation is the rate&#8208;determining step over the other site. These sites prefer the formation of CO over CO2.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;free boron&#8208;based catalysts such as boron oxide (B2O3) and boron nitride (h&#8208;BN) are promising catalysts for methane oxidation to HCHO and CO. The B2O3 catalyst contains various probable boron sites (B1 to B6), which may be responsible for methane oxidation. In this work, we utilized density functional theory to compare two relevant geometrically identical boron sites (B2 and B4) for their reactivities. The two sites are explored in&#8208;detail for the conversion of methane to formaldehyde (M2F), carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide. The B4 site activates the methane C&#8722;H bond easily as compared to the B2 site. In M2F conversion, the rate&#8208;determining step for the B2 site is the co&#8208;activation of dioxygen and methane, whereas over the B4 site, formaldehyde formation is the rate&#8208;determining step. The computationally&#8208;determined RDS for the B4 site coincides well with the reported experiments. It is further revealed that this site also prefers the formation of CO over CO2, which is in&#8208;line with the experiments in literature. It is also shown through orbital analysis that methanol formation does not occur during methane oxidation. We employed descriptors such as condensed Fukui functions and global electrophilicity index to chemically distinct these twin sites.

         <title>Highly Efficient and Thermally Durable Luminescence of 1D Eu3+ Coordination Polymers with Arsenic Bridging Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Luminescent Eu3+ coordination polymers bridged by bisarsine oxides exhibited intense emission even at 550&#8197;K. In addition, they showed heating&#8208;induced emission enhancement when heated from 300&#8197;K to 400&#8197;K.







Abstract
In this work, bisarsine oxides were evaluated as novel bridging ligands, aiming to develop practical and efficient luminescent lanthanide coordination polymers. We have synthesized one&#8208;dimensional (1D) Eu3+ coordination polymers that incorporate bisarsine oxide bridging ligands and hexafluoroacetylacetonate anions. These polymers exhibited a denser packing of chains compared to analogous polymers bridged with bisphosphine oxides. The coordination polymers demonstrated exceptional thermal stability and substantial emission quantum yields. Additionally, the bisarsine oxides induced a pronounced polarization effect, facilitating a sensitive electric dipole transition that yields considerably narrow band red emission. Remarkably, the Eu3+ coordination polymers with bisarsine oxides maintained intense emission even at 550&#8197;K. A distinctive feature of these polymers is their heating&#8208;induced emission enhancement observed when the temperature was increased from 300&#8197;K to 400&#8197;K.

         <title>Boosting Excited&#8208;State Energy Transfer by Anchoring Dipole Orientation in Binary Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence/J&#8208;Aggregate Assemblies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anchoring dipole orientation: In a binary nano&#8208;assembly, an anchoring effect between the energy donor (thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitter (2CzPN)) and the energy acceptor (J&#8208;aggregate of a cyanine dye (Cy&#8208;J)), has boosted the F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) process. This was achieved through fixing the parallel orientation of their transition dipole moments to enhance the orientation factor (&#954;2).







Abstract
F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) has been widely applied in fluorescence imaging, sensing and so on, while developing useful strategy of boosting FRET efficiency becomes a key issue that limits the application. Except optimizing spectral properties, promoting orientation factor (&#954;2) has been well discussed but rarely utilized for boosting FRET. Herein, we constructed binary nano&#8208;assembling of two thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters (2CzPN and DMAC&#8208;DPS) with J&#8208;type aggregate of cyanine dye (C8S4) as doping films by taking advantage of their electrostatic interactions. Time&#8208;resolved spectroscopic measurements indicated that 2CzPN/Cy&#8208;J films exhibit an order of magnitude higher kFRET than DMAC&#8208;DPS/Cy&#8208;J films. Further quantitative analysing on kFRET and kDET indicated higher orientation factor (&#954;2) in 2CzPN/Cy&#8208;J films play a key role for achieving fast kFRET, which was subsequently confirmed by anisotropic measurements. Corresponding DFT/TDDFT calculation revealed strong &#8220;two&#8208;point&#8221; electrostatic anchoring in 2CzPN/Cy&#8208;J films that is responsible for highly orientated transitions. We provide a new strategy for boosting FRET in nano&#8208;assemblies, which might be inspired for designing FRET&#8208;based devices of sensing, imaging and information encryption.

         <title>Trapping an Elusive Phosphanyl&#8208;Phosphaalumene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The attempted synthesis of a phosphaalumene is described. Due to the weak nature and high polarity of the P=Al &#960;&#8208;bond, this species undergoes intramolecular C&#8722;H bond activation of the &#946;&#8208;diketiminato ligand. The deleterious decomposition of this compound can be prevented by complexation with tetrahydrofuran, allowing for isolation of the Lewis acid&#8211;base adduct, which retains the reactivity of the P=Al &#960;&#8208;bond toward polar and non&#8208;polar substrates.







Abstract
We describe our efforts to access a compound with an Al=P double bond by reaction of Al(Nacnac) towards [H2CN(Dipp)]2P(PCO) (Nacnac=HC[C(Me)N(Dipp)]2; Dipp=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3). Our observations are consistent with the formation of a transient phosphanyl&#8208;phosphaalumene at low temperatures (&#8722;70&#8201;&#176;C), however this species was found to readily undergo intramolecular C&#8722;H activation of the &#946;&#8208;diketiminato ligand upon warming to room temperature. The reactivity of the transient complex toward small molecules including dihydrogen, carbon dioxide, phosphaketenes, amines and silanes could be explored at low temperatures, showcasing that the target compound can react as both a frustrated Lewis pair (via the pendant phosphanyl moiety) or in hydroelementation reactions of the Al=P bond. The elusive target molecule could be trapped by addition of a Lewis base (tetrahydrofuran) affording an isolable molecular species that reacts in an analogous fashion to the base&#8208;free compound.

     alt="Trapping an Elusive Phosphanyl-Phosphaalumene"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The attempted synthesis of a phosphaalumene is described. Due to the weak nature and high polarity of the P=Al &#960;-bond, this species undergoes intramolecular C&#8722;H bond activation of the &#946;-diketiminato ligand. The deleterious decomposition of this compound can be prevented by complexation with tetrahydrofuran, allowing for isolation of the Lewis acid&#8211;base adduct, which retains the reactivity of the P=Al &#960;-bond toward polar and non-polar substrates.
&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Heteroatom&#8208;Promoted Polyhexagonal Saddle&#8208;Shaped Molecular Structures and their Supramolecular Coassembly with C60</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combined effect of sulphur&#8208;induced curvature and unification of aryl groups through borylation furnishes a potential saddle&#8208;shaped architecture to the polyaromatics 1 and 2 without introducing any heptagon. Heterocycle 1, with smaller concave&#8208;convex molecular surfaces, forms a superstructure with double columnar fullerenes C60 in the solid state.







Abstract
Molecules with curved architecture can exhibit unique optoelectronic properties due to the concave&#8208;convex &#960;&#8208;surface. However, synthesizing negatively curved saddle&#8208;shaped aromatic systems has been challenging due to the internal structural strain. Herein, we report the facile synthesis of two polyhexagonal molecular systems, 1 and 2, with saddle shape geometry by judiciously varying the aromatic moiety, avoiding the harsh synthetic methods as that of heptagonal aromatic saddle systems. The unique geometry preferences of B, N, and S furnish suitable curvature to the molecules, featuring saddle shape. The saddle geometry also enables them to interact with fullerene C60, and the supramolecular interactions of fullerene C60 with 1 and 2 modify their optoelectronic properties. Crystal structure analysis reveals that 1, with a small &#960;&#8208;surface, forms a double columnar array of fullerenes in the solid state. In contrast, 2 with a large &#960;&#8208;surface produces a supramolecular capsule entrapping two discrete fullerenes. The intermolecular interactions between B, N, S, and the aryl&#8208;&#960; surface of the host and C60 guest are the stabilizing factors for creating these supramolecular structures. Comprehensive computational, optical, and Raman spectroscopic studies establish the charge transfer interactions between B&#8722;N doped heterocycle host and fullerene C60 guest.

         <title>Insight into the MOtBu (M=Na, K)&#8208;Mediated Dehydrogenation of Dimethylamine&#8208;Borane and Transfer Hydrogenation of Nitriles to Primary Amines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A practical, operationally simple, and efficient protocol for the NaOtBu&#8208;mediated transfer hydrogenation of nitriles to the corresponding primary amines with a relatively unexplored sacrificial hydrogen source (dimethylamine borane) is reported. The reaction encompasses a broad substrate scope and furnishes good&#8208;to&#8208;excellent yields of the primary amines under solvent&#8208;free conditions.







Abstract
Selective synthesis of primary amines from nitriles is challenging in synthetic chemistry due to the possible en&#8208;route generation of various amines and imines. Herein, we report a practical and operationally simple MOtBu&#8208;mediated (M=Na, K) transfer hydrogenation of nitriles to the corresponding primary amines with a relatively unexplored sacrificial hydrogen source (dimethylamine borane). The strategy encompasses a broad substrate scope under transition metal&#8208;free conditions and does not require any solvent. The mechanistic investigation was performed with the aid of control experiments and spectroscopic studies. The GC analysis of the reaction mixture exhibited the evolution of the H2 gas. Additionally, detailed computational calculations were undertaken to shed light on the possible intermediates and transition states involved during the present protocol.

         <title>Ferromagnetically Coupled Chromium(III) Dimer Shows Luminescence and Sensitizes Photon Upconversion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tridentate chelate ligand allows both meridional and facial coordination of chromium(III) via controlled synthesis, giving either a mono&#8208; or a dinuclear chromium(III) complex. Both complexes show room&#8208;temperature luminescence in solution with sub&#8208;microsecond lifetimes, short enough to avoid quenching by air oxygen, but sufficiently long for energy transfer to a triplet annihilator.







Abstract
There has been much progress on mononuclear chromium(III) complexes featuring luminescence and photoredox activity, but dinuclear chromium(III) complexes have remained underexplored in these contexts until now. We identified a tridentate chelate ligand able to accommodate both meridional and facial coordination of chromium(III), to either access a mono&#8208; or a dinuclear chromium(III) complex depending on reaction conditions. This chelate ligand causes tetragonally distorted primary coordination spheres around chromium(III) in both complexes, entailing comparatively short excited&#8208;state lifetimes in the range of 400 to 800&#8197;ns in solution at room temperature and making photoluminescence essentially oxygen insensitive. The two chromium(III) ions in the dimer experience ferromagnetic exchange interactions that result in a high spin (S=3) ground state with a coupling constant of +9.3&#8197;cm&#8722;1. Photoinduced energy transfer from the luminescent ferromagnetically coupled dimer to an anthracene derivative results in sensitized triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation upconversion. Based on these proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle studies, dinuclear chromium(III) complexes seem attractive for the development of fundamentally new types of photophysics and photochemistry enabled by magnetic exchange interactions.

         <title>Indium(III)&#8208;Catalyzed Haloalkynylation Reaction of Alkynes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using main group halides as catalysts for the Haloalkynylation reaction enables the application of various haloacetylenes. By means of several experiments and quantum chemical calculations, two different reaction pathways can be proposed.







Abstract
Green chemistry strives for sustainability at the molecular level and is gaining increasing relevance in the development of chemical reactions. The haloalkynylation reaction is a highly atom&#8211;economical C&#8722;C coupling reaction that was previously only achieved using transition metal catalysts. It enables the introduction of an alkyne unit and a halogen atom into the target molecule. Herein, we present a haloalkynylation reaction catalyzed by indium(III) halides. The use of indium(III) bromide as a catalyst leads exclusively to the cis addition products with yields up to 86&#8201;%. In addition, iodoacetylenes can be applied for the first time for the haloalkynylation reaction of internal alkynes which is an important step forward in the development of industrially relevant and sustainable catalysts. In contrast to gold catalysis, which proceeds via a similar mechanism, the use of alkyl&#8208;substituted haloacetylenes as reagents is also possible. Based on 13C labeling experiments and quantum chemical calculations, we postulate two possible mechanisms for the indium(III)&#8208;catalyzed haloalkynylation reactions.

         <title>Dual Role of a Novel heteroleptic Cu(I) Complex in Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven CO2&#160;Reduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel mononuclear Cu(I) complex was synthesized via coordination with a benzoquinoxalin&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;one&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazole chelating diimine and the bis[(2&#8208;diphenylphosphino)phenyl] ether (DPEPhos), to target a new and efficient photosensitizer for photocatalytic CO2 reduction. The Cu(I) complex absorbs in the blue&#8208;green region of the visible spectrum, with a broad band having a maximum at 475 nm &#8232;(&#949; = 4500 M&#8208;1cm&#8208;1), which is assigned to the metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (MLCT) transition from the Cu(I) to the benzoquinoxalin&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;one moiety of the diimine. Surprisingly, photo&#8208;driven experiments for the CO2 reduction showed that this complex can undergo a photoinduced electron transfer with a sacrificial electron donor and accumulate electrons on the diimine backbone. Photo&#8208;driven experiments in a CO2 atmosphere revealed that this complex can not only act as a photosensitizer, when combined with an Fe(III)&#8208;porphyrin, but can also selectively produce CO from CO2. Thus, owing to its charge&#8208;accumulation properties, the non&#8208;innocent benzoquinoxalin&#8208;2&#8208;one based ligand enabled the development of the first copper(I)&#8208;based photocatalyst for CO2 reduction.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct Comparative Studies Revealing the Contribution of TADF Activity of Organic Emitters Towards Efficient Electrochemiluminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrochemiluminescence (ECL) featuring thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) properties has attracted considerable interest, showcasing their potential for 100% exciton harvesting, which marks a significant advancement in the realm of organic ECL. However, the challenge of elucidating the precise contribution of TADF to the enhanced ECL efficiency arises due to the lack of comparative studies of organic compounds with or without efficient TADF properties. In this study, we present four carbazole&#8208;benzonitrile (Cz&#8208;BN) molecules possessing similar chemical structures and comparable exchange energy (&#916;EST). Despite their comparable properties, these compounds exhibited varying TADF efficiencies, warranting a closer examination of their underlying structural and electronic characteristics governing the optical properties. Consequently, intense ECL emission was only observed from 4CzBN with a remarkable TADF efficiency, underscoring the substantial difference in the ECL signal among molecules with comparable &#916;EST and similar spectral properties but varying TADF activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Progress in Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Photosensitizers for Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a rapidly growing discipline that is expected to become an encouraging noninvasive therapeutic strategy for cancer treatment. In the PDT process, an efficient intersystem crossing (ISC) process for photosensitizers from the singlet excited state (S1) to the triplet excited state (T1) is critical for the formation of cytotoxic reactive oxygen species and improvement of PDT performance. Thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) molecules featuring an extremely small singlet&#8211;triplet energy gap and an efficient ISC process represent an enormous breakthrough for the PDT process. Consequently, the development of advanced TADF photosensitizers has become increasingly crucial and pressing. The most recent developments in TADF photosensitizers aimed at enhancing PDT efficiency for bio&#8208;applications are presented in this review. TADF photosensitizers with water dispersibility, targeting ability, activatable ability, and two&#8208;photon excitation properties are highlighted. Furthermore, the future challenges and perspectives of TADF photosensitizers in PDT are proposed.</dc:description>

         <title>Conformational Analysis of (+)&#8208;Germacrene D&#8208;4&#8208;ol Using the Crystalline Sponge Method to Elucidate the Origin of its Instability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Unsaturated cyclic terpenes often exhibit instability due to the proximation of C=C bonds in the cyclic skeleton, leading to nonenzymatic degradation. In this study, the crystalline sponge (CS) method was employed for the X&#8208;ray conformational analysis of a minute amount of oily and cyclic terpene compound, (+)&#8208;germacrene D&#8208;4&#8208;ol, which was produced by a terpene synthase OILTS under in vitro conditions.&#160; The CS method revealed a reactive conformation of the cyclic terpene with proximal double bonds. Under weakly acidic in vivo conditions, OILTS gave four pseudo&#8208;natural products or artifacts. The CS method also elucidated the structures of these degraded compounds, proposing a degradation mechanism triggered by the transannular reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Tridentate Lewis Acids Based on Tribenzotriquinacene Chalices</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chalice&#8208;shaped tridentate poly&#8208;Lewis acids (PLA) based on the tribenzotriquinacene (TBTQ) scaffold have been synthesised. Stannylation of the alkyne units, attached via phenyl&#8208;spacers to the benzhydrylic positions to the TBTQ scaffold, with Me2NSnMe3 afforded the trimethyltin substituted TBTQ derivative. Replacement of these tin functions with other elements resulted in rigid boron&#8208; and aluminium&#8208;functionalised PLAs. More flexible PLAs were obtained by hydrometallation reactions of the terminal alkyne groups of 4b,8b,12b&#8208;tris((ethy&#173;nyl)phenyl)tribenzotriquinacene. The resulting poly&#8208;Lewis acids were tested for their acceptor abilities in host&#8208;guest experi&#173;ments with suitable bases. Preliminary tests with pyridine led to the synthesis of a large tridentate base with three pyridyl groups attached to a TBTQ backbone. Complexation of this Lewis base with the PLAs resulted in the formation of aggregates, which were studied in solution in more detail by 1H DOSY NMR experiments regarding their size. Further experiments were performed with the tridentate bases 1,4,7&#8208;trimethyl&#8208;1,4,7&#8208;triazacyclononane and tris((dimethylphosphino)&#173;methyl)&#173;phenyl&#173;si&#173;&#173;lane.</dc:description>

         <title>Regiodivergent Synthesis of 4&#8208; and 5&#8208;Sulfenyl Oxazoles from Alkynyl Thioethers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The regiodivergent synthesis of 4&#8208; and 5&#8208;sulfenyl oxazoles from 1,4,2&#8208;dioxazoles and alkynyl thioethers has been achieved. Gold&#8208;catalysed conditions are used to favour the formation of 5&#8208;sulfenyl oxazoles via &#946;&#8208;selective attack of the nitrenoid relative to the sulfenyl group. In contrast, 4&#8208;sulfenyl oxazoles are formed by &#945;&#8208;selective reaction under Br&#248;nsted acid conditions from the same substrates. The nature of stabilising gold&#8208;sulfur interactions have been investigated by natural bond orbital analysis, showing that the S&#8594;Au interactions are significantly stronger in the intermediate that favours the 5&#8208;sulfenyl oxazoles. A kinetic survey identifies catalyst inhibition processes. This study into the regiodivergent methods includes the development of telescoped annulation&#8208;oxidation protocols for regioselective access to oxazole sulfoxides and sulfones.</dc:description>

         <title>Ligand Basicity and Chelate Effects on Sulfur Insertion vs. Sulfur Reduction by Zinc Thiolate Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>4&#8208; and 5&#8208;coordinate zinc thiolate complexes supported either by bis(carboxamide)pyridine frameworks or by substituted tris(pyrazolyl)borate ligands react with elemental sulfur (S8) following two distinct pathways. Some zinc thiolate moieties insert sulfur atoms to form zinc polysulfanide complexes, while others reduce sulfur and oxidize the thiolate. Here, we compare the effects of ligand electronics, strain, and sterics for selecting the respective reaction pathway. These results show that chelating and electron&#8208;deficient thiolate ligands better stabilize persistent zinc&#8208;bound polysulfanide species.</dc:description>

         <title>Poly(ferrocenylsilane)&#8208;Based Redox&#8208;Active Artificial Organelles for Biomimetic Cascade Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Artificial organelles serve as functional counterparts to natural organelles, which are primarily employed to artificially replicate, restore, or enhance cellular functions. While most artificial organelles exhibit basic functions, we diverge from this norm by utilizing poly(ferrocenylmethylethylthiocarboxypropylsilane) microcapsules (PFC MCs) to construct multifunctional artificial organelles through water/oil interfacial self&#8208;assembly. Within these PFC MCs, enzymatic cascades are induced through active molecular exchange across the membrane to mimic the functions of enzymes in mitochondria. We harness the inherent redox properties of the PFC polymer, which forms the membrane, to facilitate in&#8208;situ redox reactions similar to those supported by the inner membrane of natural mitochondria. Subsequent studies have demonstrated the interaction between PFC MCs and living cell including extended lifespans within various cell types. We anticipate that functional PFC MCs have the potential to serve as innovative platforms for organelle mimics capable of executing specific cellular functions.</dc:description>

         <title>Coinage Metal Complexes of a Sterically Encumbered Anionic Pyridylborate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sterically loaded, anionic pyridine has been synthesized and utilized successfully in the stabilization of a homoleptic series of coinage metal complexes. &#160;The treatment of [4&#8208;(Ph3B)&#8208;2,6&#8208;Trip2Py]K (Trip =2,4,6&#8208;iPr3C6H2) with CuBr(PPh3), AgCl(PPh3) or AuCl(PPh3) (Py = pyridine) afforded the corresponding [4&#8208;(Ph3B)&#8208;2,6&#8208;Trip2Py]M(PPh3) (M = Au, Ag, Cu) complexes, via salt metathesis, as isolable, crystalline solids.&#160; Notably, these reactions avoid the facile single electron transfer chemistry reported with the less bulky ligand systems.&#160; The X&#8208;ray structures revealed that they are two&#8208;coordinate metal adducts.&#160; The M&#8208;N and M&#8208;P bond distances are longest in the silver and shortest in the copper adduct among the three group 11 family members. &#160;Computational analysis revealed an interesting stability dependence on steric bulk of the anionic pyridine (i.e., pyridyl borate) ligand.&#160; A comparison of structures and bonding of [4&#8208;(Ph3B)&#8208;2,6&#8208;Trip2Py]Au(PPh3) to pyridine and m&#8208;terphenyl complexes, {[2,6&#8208;Trip2Py]Au(PPh3)}[SbF6] and [2,6&#8208;Trip2Ph]Au(PPh3) are also provided.&#160; The Au(I) isocyanide complex, [4&#8208;(Ph3B)&#8208;2,6&#8208;Trip2Py]Au(CNBut) has been stabilized using the same anionic pyridylborate illustrating that it can support other gold&#8208;ligand moieties as well.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>(Z)&#8208;alkenes are useful synthons but thermodynamically less stable than their (E)&#8208;isomers and typically more difficult to prepare. The synthesis of 1,4&#8208;hetero&#8208;bifunctionalized (Z)&#8208;alkenes is particularly challenging due to the inherent regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity issues. Herein we demonstrate a general, chemoselective and direct synthesis of (Z)&#8208;2&#8208;butene&#8208;1,4&#8208;diol monoesters. The protocol operates within a Pd&#8208;catalyzed decarboxylative acyloxylation regime involving vinyl ethylene carbonates (VECs) and various carboxylic acids as the reaction partners under mild and operationally attractive conditions. The newly developed process allows access to a structurally diverse pool of (Z)&#8208;2&#8208;butene&#8208;1,4&#8208;diol monoesters in good yields and with excellent regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity. Various synthetic transformations of the obtained (Z)&#8208;2&#8208;butene&#8208;1,4&#8208;diol monoesters demonstrate how these synthons are of great use to rapidly diversify the portfolio of these formal desymmetrized (Z)&#8208;alkenes.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The effective transition metal&#8208;free photoredox/bismuth dual catalytic reductive dialkylation of nitroarenes with benzaldehydes has been reported. The nitroarene redution through visible light&#8208;driven photoredox catalysis was integrated with subsequent reductive dialkylation of anilines under bismuth catalysis to enable the cascade reductive alkylation of nitroarenes with carbonyls. Salient features of this relay catalysis system include mild reaction conditions, no requirement for transition metal catalysts, easy handling, step&#8208;economy, and high selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Bispidine based Hg(II) 1D Coordination Polymers of Helical Topology: Stability, Selective Adsorption and 1D to 2D Dimensionality Change via SC&#8208;to&#8208;SC Transformation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bispidine based Hg(II) coordination polymers of helical topology&#160; CP&#8208;MeOH and CP&#8208;EtOH are almost isostructural (they mainly differ for the solvent included in their lattice and by a small % in unit cell parameters) but they differ for everything else: i) their intrinsic stability, ii) their ability to adsorb solvents upon prior evacuation, iii) their accessible structural transformations. In particular, one of the two starting materials, once evacuated, is capable to adsorb methanol from atmospheres containing binary and ternary mixtures of volatile organic compounds (MeOH, CHCl3 and EtOH) under ambient conditions (25 &#176;C, 1 atm) and with a marked selectivity. The other one is not, but undergoes a 1D to 2D dimensionality change which can be monitored in situ by SC&#8208;XRD through a SC&#8208;to&#8208;SC process.</dc:description>

         <title>Two&#8208;Phase Electrosynthesis of Dihydroxycoumestans: Discovery of a New Scaffold for Topoisomerase I poison</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Coumestan represents a biologically relevant structural motif distributed in a number of natural products, and the rapid construction of related derivatives as well as the characterization of targets would accelerate lead compound discovery in medicinal chemistry. In this work, a general and scalable approach to 8,9&#8208;dihydroxycoumestans via two&#8208;electrode constant current electrolysis was developed. The application of a two&#8208;phase (aqueous/organic) system plays a crucial role for success, protecting the sensitive o&#8208;benzoquinone intermediates from over&#8208;oxidation. Based on the structurally diverse products, a primary SAR study on coumestan scaffold was completed, and compound 3r exhibited potent antiproliferative activities and a robust topoisomerase I (Top1) inhibitory activity. Further mechanism studies demonstrates that compound 3r was a novel Top1 poison, which might open an avenue for the development of Top1&#8208;targeted antitumor agent.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>

         <title>Bioorthogonal Cycloadditions of C3&#8208;Trifluoromethylated 1,2,4&#8208;Triazines with trans&#8208;Cyclooctenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>1,2,4&#8208;triazines are a valuable class of heterodienes that can be employed in inverse electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder reactions. However, their broader application in bioorthogonal chemistry is limited due to their low reactivity. This article focuses on 3&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazines, which can be efficiently prepared in a one&#8208;pot reaction from NH&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazoles. These triazines are highly reactive in reactions with strained cyclooctenes, giving second&#8208;order rate constants as high as 230 M&#8211;1 s&#8211;1. Despite their high reactivity, the compounds remain sufficiently stable under biologically relevant conditions. We show that some of the compounds are fluorogenic, a property of potential use in bioimaging. In addition, we demonstrate the successful application of the triazines in labeling model biomolecules. Our work shows that the reactivity of 1,2,4&#8208;triazines can be enhanced by the 3&#8208;CF3&#8208;substitution, which we consider an important step toward the wider use of this promising class of reagents.</dc:description>

         <title>Influence of chemical modifications of the crystallophore on protein nucleating properties and supramolecular interactions network.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Crystallophores are lanthanide complexes that have demonstrated outstanding induction of crystallization for various proteins. This article explores the effect of tailored modifications of the crystallophore first generation and their impact on the nucleating properties, and protein crystal structures. Through high&#8208;throughput crystallization experiments and dataset analysis, we evaluated the effectiveness of these variants, in comparison to the first crystallophore generation G1. In particular, the V1variant, featuring a propanol pendant arm, demonstrated the ability to produce new crystallization conditions for the proteins tested (hen&#8208;egg white lysozyme, proteinase K and thaumatin). Structural analysis performed in the case of hen egg&#8208;white lysozyme along with Molecular Dynamics simulations, highlights V1's unique behavior, taking advantage of the flexibility of its propanol arm to explore different protein surfaces and form versatile supramolecular interactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Unlocking Photocatalytic Activity of Acridinium Salts by Anion&#8208;Binding Co&#8208;Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The in situ generation of active photoredox organic catalysts upon anion&#8208;binding co&#8208;catalysis by making use of the ionic nature of common photosensitizers is reported. Hence, the merge of anion&#8208;binding and photocatalysis permitted the modulation of the photocatalytic activity of simple acridinium halide salts, building an effective anion&#8208;binding &#8211; photoredox ion pair complex able to promote a variety of visible light driven transformations, such as anti&#8208;Markovnikov addition to olefins, Diels&#8208;Alder and the desilylative C&#8208;C bond formatting reactions. Anion&#8208;binding studies, together with steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved spectroscopy analysis, supported the postulated ion pair formation between the thiourea hydrogen&#8208;bond donor organocatalyst and the acridinium salt, which proved essential for unlocking the photocatalytic activity of the photosensitizer.</dc:description>

         <title>sAPP&#945; Peptide Promotes Damaged Microglia to Clear Alzheimer&#8217;s Amyloid&#8208;&#946; via Restoring Mitochondrial Function</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age&#8208;related neurodegenerative disease with amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) deposition as the main pathological feature. It&#8217;s an important challenge to find new ways to clear A&#946; from Brain. The soluble amyloid precursor protein &#945; (sAPP&#945;) is a neuroprotective protein and can attenuate neuronal damage, including toxic A&#946;. However, the regulatory role of sAPP&#945; in non&#8208;neuronal cells, such as microglia, is less reported and controversial. Here, we showed that sAPP&#945; promoted the phagocytosis and degradation of A&#946; in both normal and damaged microglia. Moreover, the function of damaged microglia was improved by the sAPP&#945; through normalizing mitochondrial function. Furthermore, the results of molecular docking simulation showed that sAPP&#945; had a good affinity with A&#946;. We preliminarily reveal that sAPP&#945; is similar to antibodies and can participate in the regulation of microglia phagocytosis and degradation of A&#946; after binding to A&#946;. sAPP&#945; is expected to be a mild and safe peptide drug or drug carrier for AD.</dc:description>

         <title>Keplerate&#8208;Type Polyoxometalates&#8208;Based Triboelectric Nanogenerator for Higher Performance via the Morphology Modulation of Blackberry Structure</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The triboelectric material is the key factor affecting the performance of triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs). Inorganic materials have higher heat resistance and stability than widely used organic materials. However, the weaker triboelectric property limits the application of TENGs. Modulating surface roughness by changing particle shape and size is a simple way to increase performance for TENGs. Polyoxometalates (POMs) have unrivalled structural diversity and can self&#8208;assemble to form different nanostructures. In this study, we propose [{(NH4)42[Mo72VIMo60VO372(CH3COO)30(H2O)7.ca.300H2O.ca.CH3COONH4)]}&#8208;Mo132] and [{Na8K14(VO)2[{(MoVI)(Mo5VIO21)(H2O)3]}10{(MoVI)Mo5VIO21(H2O)3(SO4)}2{VIVO(H2O)20}{VIVO}10({KSO4}5)2]&#183;150H2O)}&#8208;Mo72V30] with blackberry structure which are cured and prepared into film by spin&#8208;coating technique, are used as triboelectric positive materials for the first time in the field of TENGs. Keplerate&#8208;type polyoxometalates can form blackberry structures with higher dispersibility and flexibility, which can be used to control surface roughness by regulating the size of particles. The discovery proves that the particle size influences the surface roughness, which adjusts the output of TENGs. According to our findings, Mo132&#8208;h&#8208;TENG generates an output voltage of 29.3 V, an output charge of 8 nC 2&#8208;3 folds higher than Mo132&#8208;TENG, and a maximum power density of 6.25 mW&#183;m&#8208;2 at 300 M&#937;. Our research provides that altering the dimensional size can be an available way to raise the output of TENGs.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Carbene Transfer: Enhancing Chemical Diversity for Drug Discovery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The exploration of chemical space for disease targets is of paramount importance. However, the current repertoire of chemically synthesized compounds, numbering around 108, merely scratches the surface in comparison to the theoretical diversity of 1060. Organic chemists are actively engaged in pioneering methodologies to expand this constrained space. Among these innovative approaches, Asymmetric Carbene Transfer (ACT) emerges as a potent strategy for enhancing molecular diversity. This article critically examines the efficacy of ACT in synthesizing pharmaceutically relevant molecules, encompassing natural products and bioactive compounds. We highlight its pivotal role in the synthesis of 25 compounds. By unraveling the diverse applications of ACT, this review illuminates its potential impact on drug discovery. Furthermore, we propose future methodology directions, contributing to the ongoing discourse within the medicinal chemistry community. In summary, this review article navigates the landscape of ACT, showcasing its prowess in expanding chemical space for drug discovery. Through a nuanced exploration of its applications and a forward&#8208;looking approach, we contribute to the collective understanding of ACT's potential and chart a course for future advancements in ACT for drug discovery.</dc:description>

         <title>A Broadened Class of Donor&#8208;Acceptor Stacked Macrometallacyclic Adducts of Different Coinage Metals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A yet&#8208;outstanding supramolecular chemistry challenge is isolation of novel varieties of stacked complexes with fine&#8208;tuned donor&#8208;acceptor bonding and optoelectronic properties, as herein reported for binary adducts comprising two different cyclic trinuclear complexes (CTC@CTC&#8217;). Most previous attempts focused only on 1&#8208;2 factors among metal/ligand/substituent combinations, resulting in heterobimetallic complexes. Instead, here we show that, when all 3 factors are carefully considered, a broadened variety of CTC@CTC&#8217; stacked pairs with intuitively&#8208;enhanced intertrimer coordinate&#8208;covalent bonding strength and ligand&#8208;ligand/metal&#8208;ligand dispersion are attained (dM&#8211;M&#8217; 2.868(2) &#197;; &#916;E &gt; 50 kcal/mol, an order of magnitude higher than aurophilic interactions). Significantly, CTC@CTC&#8217; pairs remain intact/strongly&#8208;bound even in solution (Keq 4.67&#215;105 L/mol via NMR/UV&#8208;vis titrations), and the gas phase (mass spectrometry revealing molecular peaks for the entire CTC@CTC&#8217; units in sublimed samples), rather than simple co&#8208;crystal formation. Photo&#8208;/electro&#8208;luminescence studies unravel metal&#8208;centered phosphorescence useful for novel optoelectronic device concepts. This work manifests systematic design of supramolecular bonding and multi&#8208;faceted spectral properties of pure metal&#8208;organic macrometallacyclic donor/acceptor (inorganic/inorganic) stacks with remarkably&#8208;rich optoelectronic properties akin to well&#8208;established organic/organic and organic/inorganic analogues.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorination/dearomatization of C6F5 groups: An FLP route to an electrophilic borane and non&#8208;coordinating anions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>B(C6F5)3 and the corresponding anion [B(C6F5)4]&#8722; are ubiquitous in main group and transition metal chemistry. Known derivatives are generally limited to the incorporation of electron donating substituents. Herein we describe electrophilic fluorination and dearomatization of such species using XeF2 in the presence of BF3 or Lewis acidic cations. In this fashion the anions [HB(C6F5)3]&#8722;, [B(C6F5)4]&#8722; and [(C6F5)3BC&#8801;NB(C6F5)3]&#8722;, are converted to [HB(C6F7)3]&#8722;, [B(C6F7)4]&#8722;, and [(C6F7)3BC&#8801;NB(C6F7)3]&#8722;, respectively. Similarly, the borane adducts (L)B(C6F7)3 (L = MeCN, OPEt3) are produced. These rare examples of electrophilic attack of electron deficient rings proceed as [XeF][BF4] acts as a frustrated Lewis pair effecting fluorination and dearomatization of C6F5 rings.</dc:description>

         <title>Zn promoted GaZrOx ternary solid solution oxide combined with SAPO&#8208;34 effectively converts CO2 to light olefins with low CO selectivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We proposed a new strategy for CO2 hydrogenation to prepare light olefins by introducing Zn into GaZrOx to construct ZnGaZrOx ternary oxides, which was combined with SAPO&#8208;34 to prepare a high&#8208;performance ZnGaZrOx/SAPO&#8208;34 tandem catalyst for CO2 hydrogenation to light olefins. By optimizing the Zn doping content, the ratio and mode of the two&#8208;phase composite, and the process conditions, the 3.5%ZnGaZrOx/SAPO&#8208;34 tandem catalyst showed excellent catalytic performance and good high&#8208;temperature inhibition of the reverse water&#8208;gas shift (RWGS) reaction. The catalyst achieved 26.6% CO2 conversion, 82.1% C2=&#8208;C4= selectivity and 11.8% light olefins yield. The ZnGaZrOx formed by introducing an appropriate amount of Zn into GaZrOx significantly enhanced the spillover H2 effect and also induced the generation of abundant oxygen vacancies to effectively promote the activation of CO2. Importantly, the RWGS reaction was also significantly suppressed at high temperatures, with the CO selectivity being only 46.1% at 390&#176;C.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A mechanochemistry approach is developed for regioselective synthesis of functionalized dihydropyrido[2,3&#8208;d]pyrimidines by milling propargylic alcohols and 6&#8208;amino uracils with HFIP/p&#8208;TsOH. In the case of tert&#8208;propargyl alcohols, this [3+3] cascade annulation proceeded through allenylation of uracil followed by a 6&#8208;endo trig cyclization. With sec&#8208;propargyl alcohols, the reaction furnished the propargylation of uracil. This atom economy ball milling reaction allows access to a broad range of dihydropyrido[2,3&#8208;d]pyrimidine derivatives in excellent yields.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of Nanoflower&#8208;Like Zn2SnS4 as Nanozymes for Highly Sensitive Electrochemical Detection of H2O2 Released by Living Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zn2SnS4 nanoflowers with high uniformity and a large surface area were synthesized using a facile one&#8208;pot hydrothermal method without the use of any template precursors. Utilizing macrophages differentiated from leukemia THP&#8208;1 cells as a representative sensing model, an electrochemical sensor based on the Zn2SnS4 nanoflowers was successfully fabricated for real&#8208;time monitoring of H2O2 release from living cells induced by LPS.







Abstract
The sensitive and reliable nanozyme&#8208;based sensor enables the detection of low concentrations of H2O2 in biological microenvironments, it has potential applications as an in&#8208;situ monitoring platform for cellular H2O2 release. The uniformly dispersed bimetallic sulfide (Zn2SnS4) nanoflowers were synthesized via a one&#8208;pot hydrothermal method and the two kinds of metal ions can serve as morphology and structure directing agents for each other in the synthetic process. The nanoparticles were utilized as nanozyme materials to fabricate a novel electrochemical sensor, and it exhibits a distinct electrochemical response towards H2O2 with excellent stability and detection capability (with a minimum detection limit of 1.79&#8197;nM (S/N=3)), the excellent characteristics facilitate the precise detection of low concentrations of H2O2 in biological microenvironments. Use the macrophages differentiated from leukemia THP&#8208;1 cells as a representative sensing model, the sensor was successfully utilized for real&#8208;time monitoring of the release of H2O2 induced by living cells, which has significant potential applications in clinical diagnosis and cancer treatment.

The electrochemical coupling of tetrazole species with 2,6&#8208;dimethoxypyrazine, followed by UV cyclization has resulted in an effective means for the synthesis of 1,2,4&#8208;triazolo&#8208;[4,3&#8208;a]pyrazine.







Abstract
1,2,4&#8208;triazolo&#8208;[4,3&#8208;a]pyrazine was prepared via a two&#8208;step electrochemical, photochemical process. First, a 5&#8208;substituted tetrazole is electrochemically coupled to 2,6&#8208;dimethoxypyrazine to yield 1,5&#8208; and 2,5&#8208; disubstituted tetrazoles. Subsequent photochemical excitation of the 2,5&#8208;disubstituted tetrazole species using an ultraviolet lamp releases nitrogen gas and produces a short&#8208;lived nitrilimine intermediate. Subsequent cyclization of the nitrilimine intermediate yields a 1,2,4&#8208;triazolo&#8208;[4,3&#8208;a]pyrazine backbone. The scope of this reaction was explored using various tetrazoles and pyrazines. Materials produced were identified using chemical analytical techniques and computationally studied for potential application as an insensitive energetic material.

         <title>Linear, Planar, Orbicular, and Macrocyclic Multinuclear Zinc (Meth)acrylate Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The diverse structures of zinc (meth)acrylate are present herein. The linear polymeric structure consisting of dinuclear repeating units of zinc (meth)acrylate is converted to a Zn4 cluster upon treating with ZnO. Recrystallization of zinc acrylate from a hydrous solvent affords a sheet&#8208;like structure consisting of Zn5 repeating units bridged by two &#956;3&#8208;OH, whereas zinc methacrylate affords a cyclic Zn12 structure supported by methacrylato ligands.







Abstract
Zinc carboxylate complexes are widely utilized as artificial models of metalloenzymes and as secondary building units of PCPs/MOFs. However, the relationship between the structure of the monodentate carboxylato ligand and the molecular arrangement of multinuclear zinc carboxylate complexes is not fully understood because of the coordination flexibility of the Zn ion and carboxylato ligands. Herein, we report the structural analysis of a series of complexes derived from zinc (meth)acrylate which has a linear infinite chain structure. The molecular structure of &#956;4&#8208;oxido&#8208;bridged tetranuclear complexes [Zn4(&#956;4&#8208;O)(OCOR)6] revealed a distorted Zn4O core. Crystallization of zinc acrylate under aqueous conditions afforded a &#956;3&#8208;hydroxido&#8208;containing pentanuclear complex [Zn5(&#956;3&#8208;OH)2(OCOR)8] as the repeating unit of an infinite sheet&#8208;like structure in the solid state. It was also obtained by the hydrolysis of the &#956;4&#8208;oxido&#8208;bridged tetranuclear complex. In sharp contrast, the methacrylate analog retained the methacrylato ligands under aqueous crystallization conditions to form a macrocyclic dodecanuclear complex with methacrylato as the sole ligand.

         <title>In Situ Diazonium Salt Formation and Photochemical Aryl&#8211;Aryl Coupling in Continuous Flow Monitored by Inline NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Soluble aryl diazonium trifluoroacetates are introduced for safe photochemical aryl&#8211;aryl coupling to produce industrially relevant biphenyls, even on a gram scale. While conventional diazonium tetrafluoroborates fail, this mild synthesis requires no catalysts but only UV&#8208;A light to generate aryl radicals for direct C&#8722;H arylation of various arenes. By implementing a capillary flow photoreactor, 13 biphenyl derivatives were synthesised and quantified by real&#8208;time 19F NMR spectroscopy as an in&#8208;line PAT tool. More information can be found in the Research Article by C. Deckers and T.&#8197;H. Rehm (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202303692).

Stimuli&#8208;responsive click chemistry implements molecular switches within host&#8208;guest complexes, allowing non&#8208;covalent ligation of molecular fragments and external stimulation of bound/unbound constitutional states. With selected examples, we show that these supramolecular systems are ideal candidates for stimuli&#8208;controlled molecular conjugation, thereby advancing efforts towards a more function&#8208;oriented chemical synthesis.







Abstract
Click chemistry has reached its maturity as the weapon of choice for the irreversible ligation of molecular fragments, with over 20&#8197;years of research resulting in the development or improvement of highly efficient kinetically controlled conjugation reactions. Nevertheless, traditional click reactions can be disadvantageous not only in terms of efficiency (side products, slow kinetics, air/water tolerance, etc.), but also because they completely avoid the possibility to reversibly produce and control bound/unbound states. Recently, non&#8208;covalent click chemistry has appeared as a more efficient alternative, in particular by using host&#8208;guest self&#8208;assembled systems of high thermodynamic stability and kinetic lability. This review discusses the implementation of molecular switches in the development of such non&#8208;covalent ligation processes, resulting in what we have termed stimuli&#8208;responsive click chemistry, in which the bound/unbound constitutional states of the system can be favored by external stimulation, in particular using host&#8208;guest complexes. As we exemplify with handpicked selected examples, these supramolecular systems are well suited for the development of human&#8208;controlled molecular conjugation, by coupling thermodynamically regulated processes with appropriate temporally resolved extrinsic control mechanisms, thus mimicking nature and advancing our efforts to develop a more function&#8208;oriented chemical synthesis.

Charge it up: Indenoannulation of tridecacyclene afforded a saddle&#8208;shaped nanocarbon with one octagonal and multiple pentagonal rings. The compound can undergo seven reversible redox events (highlighted as electron flashes), facilitated by the aromatic stabilization provided by the non&#8208;benzenoid moieties in charged states (glowing non&#8208;hexagonal rings). The colors of the circles around the electrons are based on the color of the dication and dianion in solution. More information can be found in the Research Article by M.

         <title>Cross&#8208;Coupling Between Aryl Halides and Aryl Alkynes Catalyzed by an Odd Alternant Hydrocarbon</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A super&#8208;reduced odd alternant hydrocarbon based on phenalenyl unit acts as a catalyst for cross&#8208;coupling between aryl halides and aryl alkynes synthesizing a rich library of internal alkynes without any external stimuli. This protocol was extended to accomplish the Sonogashira&#8208;type coupling under transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free and solvent&#8208;free conditions.







Abstract
Catalytic cross&#8208;coupling between aryl halides and alkynes is considered an extremely important organic transformation (popularly known as the Sonogashira coupling) and it requires a transition metal&#8208;based catalyst. Accomplishing such transformation without any transition metal&#8208;based catalyst in the absence of any external stimuli such as heat, photoexcitation or cathodic current is highly challenging. This work reports transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free cross&#8208;coupling between aryl halides and alkynes synthesizing a rich library of internal alkynes without any external stimuli. A chemically double&#8208;reduced phenalenyl (PLY)&#8208;based molecule with the super&#8208;reducing property was employed for single electron transfer to activate aryl halides generating reactive aryl radicals, which subsequently react with alkyne. This protocol covers not only various types of aryl, heteroaryl and polyaryl halides but also applies to a large variety of aromatic alkynes at room temperature. With a versatile substrate scope successfully tested on more than 75 entries, this radical&#8208;mediated pathway has been explained by several control experiments. All the key reactive intermediates have been characterized with spectroscopic evidence. Detailed DFT calculations have been instrumental in portraying the mechanistic pathway.

     alt="Cross-Coupling Between Aryl Halides and Aryl Alkynes Catalyzed by an Odd Alternant Hydrocarbon"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A super-reduced odd alternant hydrocarbon based on phenalenyl unit acts as a catalyst for cross-coupling between aryl halides and aryl alkynes synthesizing a rich library of internal alkynes without any external stimuli. This protocol was extended to accomplish the Sonogashira-type coupling under transition-metal-free and solvent-free conditions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Catalytic cross-coupling between aryl halides and alkynes is considered an extremely important organic transformation (popularly known as the Sonogashira coupling) and it requires a transition metal-based catalyst. Accomplishing such transformation without any transition metal-based catalyst in the absence of any external stimuli such as heat, photoexcitation or cathodic current is highly challenging. This work reports transition-metal-free cross-coupling between aryl halides and alkynes synthesizing a rich library of internal alkynes without any external stimuli. A chemically double-reduced phenalenyl (PLY)-based molecule with the super-reducing property was employed for single electron transfer to activate aryl halides generating reactive aryl radicals, which subsequently react with alkyne. This protocol covers not only various types of aryl, heteroaryl and polyaryl halides but also applies to a large variety of aromatic alkynes at room temperature. With a versatile substrate scope successfully tested on more than 75 entries, this radical-mediated pathway has been explained by several control experiments. All the key reactive intermediates have been characterized with spectroscopic evidence. Detailed DFT calculations have been instrumental in portraying the mechanistic pathway. Furthermore, we have successfully extended this transition-metal-free catalytic strategy for the first time towards solvent-free cross-coupling between solid aryl halide and alkyne substrates.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>64Cu Tumor Labeling with Hexadentate Picolinic Acid&#8208;Based Bispidine Immunoconjugates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bispidine picolinates quickly form very stable complexes with the positron emitter 64CuII under physiological conditions. These bifunctional chelators can be easily attached to amino&#8208;terminated tumor&#8208;seeking target modules. The subsequent 64Cu labeling is fast and efficient, and does not require demanding purification steps. These compounds have great potential for the development of copper&#8208;labeled radiopharmaceuticals. More information can be found in the Research Article by M. Kubeil, P. Comba, H. Stephan and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202400366).
