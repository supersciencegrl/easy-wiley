         <title>Bioactivities of Triazolium&#8208;Based N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Salts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 31, June 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biological activity: 1,2,4&#8208;Triazolium salt derivatives have been extensively studied as N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalysts and ligands. Meanwhile, it has also shown a wide range of highly effective bioactivities, including the activities of antibacterial, antifungal, anticancer, anti&#8208;plasmodium and even worm growth regulation. The development and applications of 1,2,4&#8208;triazolium salts in the development of both agrochemicals and pharmaceuticals are attractive.







Abstract
1,2,4&#8208;Triazolium salts are precursors of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs), which have been extensively used as effective catalysts and ligands for both asymmetric and non&#8208;enantioselective reactions. Nevertheless, they are also a kind of quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs) that possess amphipathic properties. The unique chemical and physical properties of 1,2,4&#8208;triazolium salts have received significant attention from scientists focusing on the development of novel bioactive molecules as pesticides and medicines. It is timely and meaningful to summarize the bioactivities of 1,2,4&#8208;triazolium salt derivatives against various bacteria, fungi, cancer cells, and other pathogens in the past 30&#8197;years. Meanwhile, the structure&#8208;activity relationship (SAR) of 1,2,4&#8208;triazolium salts was also summarized. Finally, our perspective on the future development and applications of triazolium salts as agrichemicals or human drugs is presented.

         <title>Photomodulation on Active Sites of Adsorbents: Controllable Adsorption Processes with Improved Efficiency</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 31, June 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photomodulation on adsorptive sites is an emerging strategy to achieve selective adsorption and efficient desorption. Compared with traditional adsorption techniques, active sites of photoresponsive adsorbents can be flexibly regulated by light irradiation based on the demands of adsorption process. This concept summarizes recent advances in this field and highlights the exquisite strategies of photoregulation on active sites.







Abstract
Adsorption is a widely applied technique in producing high&#8208;purity chemicals with advantages of low energy consumption, high selectivity, and mild operating conditions. However, traditional adsorbents have inflexible properties and suffer from the trade&#8208;off between selective adsorption and efficient desorption. Recently, the emerging photoresponsive adsorbents have provided new avenues for adsorption techniques. Active sites of photoresponsive adsorbents can be regulated through steric hindrance or tunable adsorbent&#8208;adsorbate interactions. Therefore, variation in adsorptive capacity is able to readily achieve through photomodulation, and the corresponding adsorption/desorption cycles are energy&#8208;saving. This concept mainly summarizes recent efforts on the fabrication and application of photoresponsive adsorbents with tunable active sites. Also, the future opportunities and critical challenges of photoregulation on adsorptive sites are presented.

         <title>Integrating Regioselective E&#8594;Z Isomerization of Trienones with Cascade Sequences under Photosensitizer&#8208;Free Direct Irradiation at 390&#8197;nm</title>

Isomerization&#8208;enabled cascade: Conjugated polyenes undergo photosensitizer&#8208;free direct irradiation at 390&#8197;nm for the highly regioselective E&#8594;Z alkene isomerization and subsequent cascade sequences to stereoselectively provide bridged bicyclic products. The directionality results from the stabilizing n&#8594;&#960;* interactions.







Abstract
The regioselective E&#8594;Z isomerization of a target olefin unit embedded in a conjugated polyene is challenging. Examples are limited to retinal and its derivatives only. The problem is further amplified when such an isomerization is integrated into cascade sequences, among which the regioselectivity and subsequent directionality are the major bottlenecks. Indeed, there are no reports till date for such a transformation. Herein, it is reported that such a controlled isomerization and subsequent cyclization cascade can be enabled by photosensitizer&#8208;free direct irradiation of linearly conjugated acyclic polyenes in dichloromethane solvent using a 390&#8197;nm LED. The directionality results from deconjugation of the extended &#960;&#8208;system in the transient Z&#8208;isomer due to stabilizing n&#8594;&#960;* interactions between 1,4&#8208;dicarbonyls (C=O&#8594;C=O) or 1,4&#8208;carbonyl/&#8208;aryl (C=O&#8594;aryl) groups. The involvement of such noncovalent interactions has been supported by X&#8208;ray crystallography and control experiments. Thus, conjugated trienones can be stereoselectively converted into oxabicyclo[3.2.1]octadienes in an atom&#8208; and step&#8208;economic manner, including the first example by regioselective isomerization of a tetrasubstituted alkene. The reaction conditions are very general (&gt;46 examples). The reaction can be conducted under open air atmosphere at ambient temperature. Such a cascade cyclization can also be realized in solid state.

         <title>Extended q&#8208;Range X&#8208;Ray Scattering Reveals High&#8208;Resolution Structural Details of Biomacromolecules in Aqueous Solutions</title>

         <dc:description>
Detailed atomic structural information of biomacromolecules in their native solution statues over several magnitude length scales was revealed by extended q&#8208;range X&#8208;ray scattering data and pair distribution function analysis.







Abstract
We communicate a feasibility study for high&#8208;resolution structural characterization of biomacromolecules in aqueous solution from X&#8208;ray scattering experiments measured over a range of scattering vectors (q) that is approximately two orders of magnitude wider than used previously for such systems. Scattering data with such an extended q&#8208;range enables the recovery of the underlying real&#8208;space atomic pair distribution function, which facilitates structure determination. We demonstrate the potential of this method for biomacromolecules using several types of cyclodextrins (CD) as model systems. We successfully identified deviations of the tilting angles for the glycosidic units in CDs in aqueous solutions relative to their values in the crystalline forms of these molecules. Such level of structural detail is inaccessible from standard small angle scattering measurements. Our results call for further exploration of ultra&#8208;wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering measurements for biomacromolecules.

The peracid oxidation of hydrocarbons in chlorinated solvents is a low yielding and poorly selective process. Through a combination of DFT calculations, spectroscopic studies, and kinetic measurement it is shown that the origin of this is electronic in nature and can be influenced through the addition of hydrogen bond donors (HBD) and hydrogen bond acceptors (HBA). Performing the reaction of a cycloalkane with mCPBA in a fluorinated alcohol solvent such as nonafluoro&#8208;tert&#8208;butanol (NFTB) or hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP), which act as strong HBD and poor HBA, leads to significantly higher yields and selectivities being observed for the alcohol product. Application of the optimised reaction conditions allows for the selective oxidation of both cyclic and linear alkane substrates delivering the corresponding alcohol in up to 86&#8201;% yield. The transformation shows selectivity for tertiary centres over secondary centres and the oxidation of secondary centres is strongly influenced by stereoelectronic effects. Primary centres are not oxidised by this method. A simple computational model developed to understand this transformation provides a powerful tool to reliably predict the influence of substitution and functionality on reaction outcome.

         <title>Biomimetic Synthesis of Organic Molecular&#8208;Doped Fluorescent Guanine Crystals with Pearlescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 31, June 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorescent guanine microplatelets exposing the high refractive index (1&#8201;0&#8201;0) face are synthesized by incorporating Nile red (NR) or fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) molecule in guanine crystals in the presence of P(VP&#8208;co&#8208;VA). The synthesized NR&#8208; and FITC&#8208;doped guanine crystals show red and green fluorescence. Aqueous suspensions with NR&#8208; and FITC&#8208;doped guanine crystals exhibit distinct pearlescence.







Abstract
Biomimetic synthesis of guanine crystals has been focused on in the last years. However, multi&#8208;functional guanine crystals occluded with fluorescent molecules have not been realized in the laboratory. Here, the controllable synthesis of guanine crystal microplatelets with fluorescence and pearlescence was achieved for the first time by incorporating Nile red (NR) or fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) molecules into guanine crystals. The synthesized fluorescent guanine crystals are pure &#946;&#8208;phase anhydrous guanine single crystals. Aqueous suspensions with NR&#8208; and FITC&#8208;doped guanine crystals exhibit distinct pearlescence. The fluorescence intensities of NR and FITC were greatly enhanced after being doped into guanine crystals due to the inhibition of aggregation&#8208;caused quenching. Moreover, films composed of fluorescent guanine microplatelets exhibit high diffuse reflection intensity (70&#8201;%). This work provides a strategy to synthesize multifunctional materials composed of organic crystals occluded with dyes.

         <title>Highly Efficient Ruthenium&#8208;Catalyzed Semi&#8208;hydrogenation of Urea Derivatives to Formamides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 31, June 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We discovered a new pathway (the urea derivatives underwent catalytic pyrolysis at first, followed by fast hydrogenation of the isocyanates) that enables rapid hydrogenation of urea derivatives to formamides even at lower H2 pressures (&lt;5&#8197;bar). This enables a two&#8208;step process of high&#8208;value CO2 utilization under mild pressures, including CO2 to urea derivatives and ureas hydrogenation.







Abstract
The utilization of CO2 as a non&#8208;toxic and cheap feedstock for C1 is a desirable route to achieve high value&#8208;added chemicals. In this context, we report a highly efficient ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed semi&#8208;hydrogenation reaction of CO2&#8208;derived ureas. Various alkyl and aryl urea derivatives were successfully hydrogenated to obtain the corresponding recyclable amines and formamides (up to 97&#8201;% yield), highlighting the good substrate applicability of this method, which makes this method a sustainable alternative for the hydrogenation of CO2 to formamides in the presence of amines. In the meantime, we have discovered a new pathway that enables rapid hydrogenation of urea derivatives even at lower H2 pressure (&lt;5&#8197;bar). This methodology might provide a new insight into the reduction functionalization of CO2 under mild pressure to form new C&#8722;N bond. Based on the control experiments and the observed intermediate products, we clarify the mechanism for selective semi&#8208;hydrogenation of ureas.

         <title>Better Peptides via Chemical Glycosylation: Somatostatin Analogues Having a Human Complex&#8208;Type N&#8208;Glycan with Improved Drug Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 31, June 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A haloacetamidyl glycan with no protecting group on the hydroxy and carboxy groups can be readily used in combination with Cys&#8208;scanning performed across any peptide and protein sequences to produce glycosylated analogues having a native complex&#8208;type glycan. Chemical glycosylation represents a powerful tool for the development of peptide and protein analogues superior to the original molecules with enhanced drug properties.







Abstract
Somatostatin (somatotropin release&#8208;inhibiting factor, SRIF) is a growth hormone inhibitory factor in the form of a 14&#8208; or 28&#8208;amino acid peptide. SRIF affects several physiological functions through its action on five distinct SRIF receptor subtypes (sst1&#8211;5). Native SRIF has only limited clinical applications due to its rapid degradation in plasma. To overcome this obstacle, we have developed glycosylated SRIF analogues that possess not only metabolic stability but also high affinity to all five receptor subtypes by attaching human complex&#8208;type oligosaccharides. Such glycosylated SRIF analogues with improved pharmacokinetic profiles could be potent and novel therapeutic drugs for SRIF&#8208;related diseases in which several SRIF receptor subtypes are closely involved, and also shed light on new indications. Our results show that chemical glycosylation can be a powerful tool for the development of peptide and protein analogues superior to the original molecules with enhanced drug properties.

         <title>Waxberry&#8208;Like MnS/Ni3S4 as High&#8208;Efficiency Bi&#8208;Functional Catalyst for Zn&#8208;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 31, June 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Waxberry&#8208;like MnS/Ni3S4 was successful prepared through a sulfuration process. MnS/Ni3S4 catalysts showed good oxygen evolution reactions (Ej=10=1.55&#8197;V) and oxygen reduction reactions (E1/2=0.81&#8197;V). When the catalyst was used in Zn&#8211;air batteries as the cathode, it showed excellent cycle stability (308&#8197;h) and small voltage gap (0.83&#8197;V &amp; 0.86&#8197;V) at 5&#8197;mA cm&#8722;2.







Abstract
In this paper, a waxberry&#8208;like MnS/Ni3S4 composite catalyst was designed and synthesized. In this coating structure, MnS is located inside and Ni3S4 is wrapped on the surface to form a spherical structure. This structure makes the material show excellent stability in the electrocatalytic process. The diffusion staggered region structure formed at the two&#8208;phase interface greatly enhances the synergistic interaction between MnS and Ni3S4. At the same time, the defects and vacancies formed by the diffusion mechanism at the interface of the two phases increase the active site and improve the interfacial electron transfer kinetics. Therefore, MnS/Ni3S4 composites showed good catalytic performance for ORR/OER. At 10&#8197;mA cm&#8722;2, the overpotential of it is only 320&#8197;mV, and the half&#8208;wave potential can reach 0.81&#8197;V. The catalyst also exhibited extraordinary cycle stability and small voltage gap when used as cathode of Zn&#8208;air batteries. When the current density is 3&#8197;mA cm&#8722;2, the cyclic discharge can be stable for 400&#8197;h and the voltage difference between the front and back does not increase more than. When the current density increases to 5&#8197;mA cm&#8722;2, the cyclic charge and discharge can be stable for more than 300&#8197;h.

Therefore, MnS/Ni&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; composites showed good catalytic performance for ORR/OER. At 10&#8197;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, the overpotential of it is only 320&#8197;mV, and the half-wave potential can reach 0.81&#8197;V. The catalyst also exhibited extraordinary cycle stability and small voltage gap when used as cathode of Zn-air batteries. When the current density is 3&#8197;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, the cyclic discharge can be stable for 400&#8197;h and the voltage difference between the front and back does not increase more than. When the current density increases to 5&#8197;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, the cyclic charge and discharge can be stable for more than 300&#8197;h.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A BF2 Chelate Exhibiting Excimer&#8208;like Fluorescence with an Unusually Large Stokes Shift in the Crystalline Phase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 31, June 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Excimer emission: Crystals of the target compound exhibit bright emission in the red region for which the spectral profile is broad and well separated from absorption transitions. The solid&#8208;state structure comprises tightly grouped molecular pairs that assemble into highly ordered columns while facilitating excimer formation at ambient temperature.







Abstract
The target mono&#8208;BF2 complex is weakly emissive in fluid solution because radiationless decay of the excited&#8208;singlet state is promoted through an intramolecular N&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#8722;N hydrogen bond. The lack of mirror symmetry for this compound is attributed to vibronic effects, as reported previously for the bis&#8208;BF2 complex (BOPHY). Red&#8208;shifted fluorescence is observed from single crystals, the emission quantum yield approaching 30&#8201;% with a fluorescence lifetime of 2&#8197;ns. The large Stokes shift of 5,700&#8197;cm&#8722;1 helps minimize self&#8208;absorption. Crystallography indicates that the internal fold and twist angles are increased substantially in the crystal, but the hydrogen bond is weakened relative to solution. The crystal structure is compiled from pairs of head&#8208;to&#8208;tail molecules having a shift of ca. 4.1&#8197;&#197; and closest approach of ca. 3.5&#8197;&#197;. These molecular pairs are arranged in columns, which, in turn, assemble into sheets. The proximity favors excitonic coupling between individual molecules, with the coupling strength obtained by analysis of the absorption spectrum reaching ca. 1,000&#8197;cm&#8722;1. Both the ideal dipole approximation and the extended dipole methodology seriously overestimate the coupling strength, but the atomic transition charge density procedure leads to good agreement with experiment. Emission is attributed to the closely coupled molecular pair functioning in an excimer&#8208;like manner with the exciton trapped in a local minimum. Increasing temperature causes a slight blue shift and loss of fluorescence.

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Deoxynitrogenation of Carboxylic Acids with Cyanamides to Access Nitriles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 31, June 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An iron&#8208;catalyzed deoxynitrogenation strategy to convert carboxylic acids into nitriles is reported. This method utilizes a cyanamide as the recyclable nitrogen donor and deoxygenating reagent and features an easy&#8208;to&#8208;setup without inert gas protection. The synthetic value of this method is highlighted by the broad substrate scope and application in late&#8208;stage modification of pharmaceuticals and scaleup reactions and derivatizations.







Abstract
Efficient strategies to access nitriles from common organic functionalities are highly important, given their significance in synthetic and medicinal chemistry. Although the direct transformation of carboxylic acids to nitriles have been explored for decades, there is few general and practical protocol to access nitriles from carboxylic acid precursors. Herein, an iron&#8208;catalyzed deoxynitrogenaton strategy to convert carboxylic acids into nitriles is described. This method utilizes a cyanamide as the recyclable nitrogen donor and deoxygenating reagent, operates broadly across aryl, alkenyl, and alkyl carboxylic acids, and features an easy setup without inert gas protection. The synthetic value of this method is demonstrated by application in late&#8208;stage modification of drug molecules, synthesis of a pharmaceutical structure, and scaleup reactions and downstream derivatizations.

         <title>Novel Pyrimidine&#8208;Based Iridium Complexes with Bulky Charge&#8208;Carrier Groups as Dopants for Highly Efficient Green Polymer Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 31, June 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two novel pyrimidine&#8208;based iridium complexes ((TPAPr)2IrAcac and (TPSPr)2IrAcac) with triphenylamine and tetraphenylsilane were fully synthesized and characterized. (TPSPr)2IrAcac with bulky tetraphenylsilane group, which can efficiently suppress the concentration quenching, achieved its highest current efficiency (CE) at higher dopant concentration. Highly efficient green phosphorescent polymer light&#8208;emitting diodes (PLEDs) are achieved by using (TPAPr)2IrAcac and (TPSPr)2IrAcac as dopants.







Abstract
Two new pyrimidine&#8208;based iridium complexes with triphenylamine and tetraphenylsilane, namely (TPAPr)2IrAcac and (TPSPr)2IrAcac, were fully synthesized and characterized. Both of the targeted iridium complexes exhibit excellent thermal stability and high photoluminescence quantum yields. Compared to (TPAPr)2IrAcac, (TPSPr)2IrAcac achieved its highest PLQY and current efficiency (CE) at higher dopant concentration probably because of its bulky tetraphenylsilane group, which can effectively suppress the concentration quenching. However, according to DFT studies, (TPSPr)2IrAcac shows faster non&#8208;radiative transitions due to the presence of more excited&#8208;state distortions than (TPAPr)2IrAcac. As a result, Green phosphorescent polymer light&#8208;emitting diodes (PLEDs) containing (TPAPr)2IrAcac and (TPSPr)2IrAcac as dopants exhibit exceptional device performance with peak CE values of 38.24 and 36.06&#8197;cd&#8201;A&#8722;1, respectively. (TPAPr)2IrAcac exhibited a superior efficiency than (TPSPr)2IrAcac because of its high &#934;p, low RMSD value, and efficient energy transfer from the host to the guest. More importantly, the PLEDs based on (TPAPr)2IrAcac and (TPSPr)2IrAcac show stable phosphorescent emission with Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.313, 0.497) and (0.299, 0.483), respectively. This work points out a viable method for creating phosphorescent iridium complexes based on pyrimidine for high&#8208;efficiency organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs).

         <title>Azide&#8211;Enolate Cycloaddition&#8208;Rearrangement Enables Direct &#945;&#8208;Amination of Amides and Enelactam Synthesis from Esters

Diverse frameworks via cycloaddition&#8208;rearrangement: Azide&#8208;enolate cycloaddition&#8208;rearrangements were applied to the direct &#945;&#8208;amination of amides and lactams, and synthesis of ene&#8208;&#947;&#8208;lactams from esters. The outcome of the reaction varied by substrate, depending on the fate of triazoline intermediates generated in the cycloaddition. These processes form part of a wider cycloaddition&#8208;rearrangement reaction manifold providing concise access to diverse frameworks.







Abstract
Azide&#8208;enolate cycloaddition&#8208;rearrangements offer potential for rapid access to diverse molecular frameworks from simple precursors. We report here that investigations into the cycloadditions of ester or amide enolates with vinyl azides led to the identification of two reaction processes &#8211; direct &#945;&#8208;amination of amides and lactams, and the synthesis of ene&#8208;&#947;&#8208;lactams from esters. The outcomes of these reactions depended on the fate of key vinyl triazoline intermediates generated in the initial cycloaddition step. Isolation of reaction intermediates in the ene&#8208;&#947;&#8208;lactam synthesis revealed the unexpected addition of two enolate equivalents, one of which is later eliminated. Computational studies further suggested an unusual reaction pathway involving direct addition of an enolate to the terminal carbon of the N&#8208;vinyl triazoline. In contrast, the &#945;&#8208;amination of amides and lactams proceeded by rearrangement of the intermediate triazoline to give an imine, hydrolysis or reduction of which gave access to primary or secondary &#945;&#8208;amino amides or lactams.

We report here that investigations into the cycloadditions of ester or amide enolates with vinyl azides led to the identification of two reaction processes &#8211; direct &#945;-amination of amides and lactams, and the synthesis of ene-&#947;-lactams from esters. The outcomes of these reactions depended on the fate of key vinyl triazoline intermediates generated in the initial cycloaddition step. Isolation of reaction intermediates in the ene-&#947;-lactam synthesis revealed the unexpected addition of &lt;i&gt;two&lt;/i&gt; enolate equivalents, one of which is later eliminated. Computational studies further suggested an unusual reaction pathway involving direct addition of an enolate to the terminal carbon of the &lt;i&gt;N-&lt;/i&gt;vinyl triazoline. In contrast, the &#945;-amination of amides and lactams proceeded by rearrangement of the intermediate triazoline to give an imine, hydrolysis or reduction of which gave access to primary or secondary &#945;-amino amides or lactams.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Exploring Zr&#8208;Based Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks as Smart Electrochromic Sensors by Coordination&#8208;Driven Surface Engineering</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 31, June 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By coordination&#8208;driven surface engineering, an electrochromic Zr&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework incorporating a viologen&#8208;like electron&#8208;deficient moiety achieved modulated interface electron transfer, thus providing a favorable paradigm for visual analysis such as phosphoprotein detection and aptamer&#8208;directed target recognition.







Abstract
As emerging stimuli&#8208;responsive materials, electrochromic metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are still not utilized in sensing applications due to difficulties in water stability, facile synthesis and functionalization, and efficient translation of specific recognition events. Here, we firstly find that a Zr&#8208;based MOF furnished with postsynthetically created viologen&#8208;like electron&#8208;deficient moiety was electrochromic active. With a coordination&#8208;driven surface engineering strategy where phosphate&#8208;containing biomolecules are tethered to Zr nodes of the MOF, fine tuning the interface electron transfer was readily achieved, thus benefitting for constructing smart electrochromic sensors through the combination of the sensitivity of electrochemistry with the visuality of colorimetry. Particularly, MOF&#8208;coated conductive films enabled label&#8208;free detection of phosphoproteins, and aptamer&#8208;functionalized ones responded specifically to the target. In two cases distinct color changes allow for visual quantification. This study represents the first example of MOF&#8208;based electrochromic sensors developed by an efficient strategy, indicating the generality to electrochromic counterparts for various sensing applications.

         <title>Graphene Oxide&#8208;BODIPY Conjugates as Highly Fluorescent Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 31, June 2, 2023. </description>

Shine bright: Graphene oxide chemically functionalized with BODIPY via a dynamic covalent bond evidences an equilibrium between GO&#8208;PBA&#8208;BODIPY and free PBA&#8208;BODIPY. While for GO&#8208;PBA&#8208;BODIPY an ultrafast energy transfer from BODIPY toward GO occurs, free BODIPY simply emits light.







Abstract
Covalent functionalization of graphene oxide (GO) with boron dipyrromethenes (BODIPYs) was achieved through a facile synthesis, affording two different GO&#8208;BODIPY conjugates where the main difference lies in the nature of the spacer and the type of bonds between the two components. The use of a long but flexible spacer afforded strong electronic GO&#8208;BODIPY interactions in the ground state. This drastically altered the light absorption of the BODIPY structure and impeded its selective excitation. In contrast, the utilisation of a short, but rigid spacer based on boronic esters resulted in a perpendicular geometry of the phenyl boronic acid BODIPY (PBA&#8208;BODIPY) with respect to the GO plane, which enables only minor electronic GO&#8208;BODIPY interactions in the ground state. In this case, selective excitation of PBA&#8208;BODIPY was easily achieved, allowing to investigate the excited state interactions. A quantitative ultrafast energy transfer from PBA&#8208;BODIPY to GO was observed. Furthermore, due to the reversible dynamic nature of the covalent GO&#8208;PBA&#8208;BODIPY linkage, some PBA&#8208;BODIPY is free in solution and, hence, not quenched from GO. This resulted in a weak, but detectable fluorescence from the PBA&#8208;BODIPY that will allow to exploit GO&#8208;PBA&#8208;BODIPY for slow release and imaging purposes.

         <title>Electronic Structure and Aromaticity of an Unusual Cyclo[18]carbon Precursor, C18Br6
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 31, June 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Investigation of an uncommon cyclo[18]carbon precursor: The analyses of the electronic structure, bonding character, electron delocalization, and response to an external magnetic field indicate that C18Br6 is a globally aromatic species with lower aromaticity than cyclo[18]carbon (C18), and the blocking of in&#8208;plane &#960;&#8208;conjugation by the presence of &#8208;Br substituents in it is the underlying cause for the weakening of molecular aromaticity.







Abstract
Herein, the electronic structure and bonding character of the stable cyclo[18]carbon (C18) precursor, C18Br6, are thoroughly characterized by molecular orbital (MO), density of states (DOS), bond order (BO), and interaction region indicator (IRI) analyses. The delocalization characters of out&#8208;of&#8208;plane and in&#8208;plane &#960;&#8208;electrons (labeled as &#960;out&#8208; and &#960;in&#8208;electrons, respectively) in bonding regions were examined using localized orbital locator (LOL) and electron localization function (ELF). The aromaticity was investigated, studying the molecular magnetic response to external magnetic field by computing the magnetically induced current density (Jind), iso&#8208;chemical shielding surface (ICSS), anisotropy of the induced current density (AICD), and the induced magnetic field (Bind). All these analyses indicate that C18Br6 is a globally aromatic species with lower aromaticity than C18, and the blocking of in&#8208;plane &#960;&#8208;conjugation (labeled as &#960;in&#8208;conjugation) by the presence of &#8208;Br substituents in it is the underlying cause for the weakening of molecular aromaticity.

         <title>Radiation&#8208;Responsive Benzothiazolines as Potential Cleavable Fluorogenic Linkers for Drug Delivery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 31, June 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benzothiazolines in aqueous solutions are cleaved under irradiation with &#947;&#8208;rays in a dose&#8208;dependent manner, leading to the formation of fluorescent products. The study paves the way for the future use of benzothiazolines as radiation sensors or as prodrugs in the context of radiotherapy.







Abstract
Radiosensitive compounds can be useful for the detection of radiations and also as prodrugs that can be activated during a radiotherapy. Herein we describe the use of benzothiazolines, which upon treatment with 137Cs produced &#947;&#8208;irradiation in water give rise to fluorescent benzothiazoles and concomitant release of amines or carboxylic acids. In a proof of concept study, we showed that benzothiazolines may be used as new cleavable linkers that can be triggered upon irradiation.

The benzamide group adopts the trans geometry in the fluorescent target compounds, thereby reducing conformational heterogeneity and opening the way to develop sophisticated nanophotonic materials. The main translational motion with these secondary benzamides concerns inversion of the aryl ring, evidenced by NMR spectroscopy and quantified by quantum chemical calculation.







Abstract
Aromatic amides can be used to construct light&#8208;harvesting materials with valuable optical properties. The amide bond is formed using well&#8208;known coupling agents in near quantitative yield, as illustrated here through the synthesis of two boron dipyrromethene derivatives bearing an amide linkage. The primary concern with acyl amides is rotation around the C&#8722;N bond, leading to cis and trans isomers. Using NMR spectroscopy, quantum chemical calculations and critical comparison to simpler benzamides, the stereochemistry of the target compounds has been addressed. The N&#8208;cyclohexyl derivative gave diffraction quality crystals that established a trans geometry for the amide bond. Quantum chemical calculations support the trans geometry as being the lowest&#8208;energy structure in solution but indicate that inversion of the aryl ring is an important structural feature. Indeed, rotation around the C(sp2)&#8722;C(aryl) bond has a strong influence on the solution&#8208;phase NMR spectra. The amide connection has minimal effect on the photophysical properties.

         <title>Ruthenium Complexes of Polyfluorocarbon Substituted Terpyridine and Mesoionic Carbene Ligands: An Interplay in CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 31, June 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ruthenium(II) complexes of PFC substituted terpyridines and MIC ligands are presented as molecular electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction. The MIC ligand is used to tune the kinetics of CO2 electrocatalysis and the terpyridine ligands are used for controlling the overpotential.







Abstract
In recent years terpyridines (tpy) and mesoionic carbenes (MIC) have been widely used in metal complexes. With the right combination with a metal center, both of these ligands are individually known to generate excellent catalysts for CO2 reduction. In this study, we combine the potentials of PFC (PFC=polyfluorocarbon) substituted tpy and MIC ligands within the same platform to obtain a new class of complexes, which we investigated with respect to their structural, electrochemical and UV/Vis/NIR spectroelectrochemical properties. We further show that the resulting metal complexes are potent electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction in which CO is exclusively formed with a faradaic efficiency of 92&#8201;%. A preliminary mechanistic study, including the isolation and characterization of a key intermediate is also reported.

         <title>Metallic and Dimensional Optimization of Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for High&#8208;Performance Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 31, June 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The crystallographic dimensions and metallic categories of MOFs are optimized in controlling polysulfides and catalyzing conversion. S supported on 2D&#8208;Ni&#8208;MOF/CNTs exhibits longer lifetime and superior rate capability, due to the highly exposed Ni nuclei. This work pioneered the avenue of sieving decent LSBs cathodes through optimizing the dimensions and metals of MOFs synergistically.







Abstract
Lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries (LSBs) have been considered as one of the most promising energy storage systems owing to their high theoretical energy density and abundant sulfuric resources. However, their commercial application is limited by rapid capacity decline and low Coulombic efficiency. Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) made of metallic nodes and organic ligands can suppress polysulfide shuttling and promote redox kinetics. In this paper, the effects of crystallographic dimensions and metallic categories on chemical performance of LSBs have been meticulously explored electrochemical performance. As a result, exposed Ni active sites in a lamellar Ni&#8208;MOF was found to deliver a superior electrochemical performance. The as&#8208;assembled LSBs with 2D&#8208;Ni&#8208;MOF/CNTs cathode deliver a much superior initial discharge capacity, (820&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.5&#8197;C), and exhibit excellent cycling stability over 550&#8197;cycles than those analogues of 3D stereoscopic Ni&#8208;MOF and 2D lamellar Co&#8208;MOF. This work proposed a perspective in elevating LSBs performance through synergistic optimization of the MOFs dimensions and the metallic nuclei in the cathodes.

Spiro&#8208;indolinepyrrolidinones and indoline&#8208;fused diazepinones were synthesized through Cs2CO3&#8208;promoted formal [2+3] and [4+3] cycloadditions of indoline&#8208;derived azadienes and &#945;&#8208;bromohydroxamates. Thirty&#8208;six examples of the target compounds were obtained in up to 89&#8201;% yield.

Abstract
A divergent reaction of indoline&#8208;derived azadienes with &#945;&#8208;bromohydroxamates for the selective synthesis of spiro&#8208;indolinepyrrolidinones and indoline&#8208;fused diazepinones was disclosed. This reaction sequence involved an initial formation of five&#8208;membered spirocyclic products followed by an intramolecular ring&#8208;opening and ring expansion to produce seven&#8208;membered diazepinones. We demonstrated that controlling the reaction time could modulate the reaction pathway for formation of different molecular frameworks for the same set of substrates. Based on the experimental results, the reaction mechanism was also discussed and proposed to explain the phenomena observed in the process.

         <title>Trapping of a Transient Base&#8208;Stabilised Alumylene and Alumylene&#8208;Type Reactivity of a Self&#8208;Stabilising Dialumene towards Organic Azides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 31, June 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An NHC&#8208;stabilised aluminium(III) terphenyl dihalide was reduced in the presence of alkynes to trap the in&#8208;situ&#8208;formed alumylene [NHC(Ter)Al:]. In the absence of an alkyne the reduction yielded a self&#8208;stabilised dialumene, which showed alumylene&#8208;like reactivity towards organic azides.







Abstract
The reduction of a carbene&#8208;coordinated, sterically encumbered terphenyl&#8208;substituted aluminium diiodide, (LRAlI2), yielded a &#8220;masked&#8221; dialumene (LRAl=AlRL), self&#8208;stabilised through [2+2] cycloaddition with a peripheral aromatic group. During the course of the reaction, a carbene&#8208;stabilised arylalumylene (LRAl:) was generated in&#8197;situ, which was trapped using an alkyne, generating an aluminacyclopropene or a C&#8722;H activated product thereof, depending on the steric bulk of the alkyne. The masked dialumene also underwent intramolecular cycloreversion and dissociation into alumylene fragments, which reacted with various organic azides to yield monomeric or dimeric iminoalanes depending on the sterics of the azide substituent. The thermodynamics of monomeric and dimeric iminoalane formation were probed by theoretical calculations.

         <title>Phase&#8208;Dependent Long Persistent Phosphorescence in Coumarin&#8208;Phosphine&#8208;Based Coinage Metal Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 31, June 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Improving the shining hour: Coumarin&#8208;functionalized aminodiphosphine and its copper and silver complexes of different nuclearities have been synthesized. The complexes exhibit unusual persistent phosphorescence with a lifetime as long as 1.5&#8197;s in solution at 77&#8197;K that is strongly dependent on phase and temperature.







Abstract
A coumarin functionalized aminodiphosphine has been introduced as a bidentate ligand in coinage metal chemistry. Mono&#8208;, di&#8208;, and trimetallic copper and silver complexes were synthesized with this ligand. The hybrid character of the ligand led to compounds with rich luminescence properties. These include coumarin&#8208;based blue fluorescence, observed as a sole emission in solution at room temperature, and green phosphorescence, which is efficient at low temperatures and dominates the spectra of the metal complexes. In the rigid environment of frozen solutions, the green phosphorescence shows an unusually long (for metal complexes) decay on the seconds timescale in high quantum yield. In addition, a red phosphorescence, which may be assigned to the triplet state localized in the phosphine&#8208;M3Cl2 (M=Cu, Ag), is observed for the trinuclear complexes at low temperature. Neither the second&#8208;long phosphorescence nor the red emission is observed for the coumarin ligand, thus they must be a result of the coordination to coinage metal clusters. The excited states in these compounds were also investigated by femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy and quantum chemical calculations.

         <title>Inverting the Electronic Structure of Diylidylgermylenes by Backbone Modification</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 31, June 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Germylenes with two ylide&#8208;substituents are usually highly nucleophilic species. Herein, we demonstrate that introduction of a cyano moiety into the ylide backbone decreases the LUMO energy and thus significantly enhances the electrophilic nature of these species. This is reflected in the reactivity but also in the molecular structure of the diylidylgermylene.







Abstract
Owing to the strong electron&#8208;donating ability of ylide substituents, diylidyltetrylenes are usually highly nucleophilic species with strong donor capacities. Here, we demonstrate that their electronic properties are in fact highly flexible and can be effectively tuned through variation of the substituent in the ylide backbone. Initial density functional theory studies showed that cyano groups are particularly capable in lowering the LUMO energy of diylidyl germylenes thus turning these usually highly nucleophilic species into electrophilic compounds. This was confirmed by experimental studies. Attempts to synthesize the germylene (YCN)2Ge [with YCN=Ph3P&#8208;(C)&#8208;CN] from the corresponding metalated ylide YCNK selectively led to germanide [(YCN)3Ge)K]2 thus reflecting the electrophilic nature of the intermediate formed germylene. XRD analysis of single crystals of (YCN)2Ge &#8211; serendipitously obtained through protonative cleavage of one ylide from the germanide &#8211; revealed a monomeric structure with rather long Ge&#8208;ylide linkages, which corroborates well with a pure single bond and no stabilization of the empty p&#960; orbital at germanium through &#960; bonding. The germanide exhibits methanide&#8208;like reactivity towards chalcogens but a likewise weak Ge&#8722;C bond as demonstrated by the insertion of carbon dioxide.

         <title>Engineering the BASHY Dye Platform toward Architectures with Responsive Fluorescence</title>

The structural and electronic extension of the boronic&#8208;acid&#8208;derived salicylidenehydrazone (BASHY) dye platform yields stimuli&#8208;responsive fluorophores with applications in fluorescence lifetime imaging of live cells.







Abstract
A set of nine boronic&#8208;acid&#8208;derived salicylidenehydrazone (BASHY) complexes has been synthesized in good to very good chemical yields in a versatile three&#8208;component reaction. In an extension to previous reports on this dye platform, the focus was put on the electronic modification of the &#8220;vertical&#8221; positions of the salicylidenehydrazone backbone. This enabled the observation of fluorescence quenching by photoinduced electron transfer (PeT), which can be reverted by the addition of acid in organic solvent (OFF&#8208;ON fluorescence switching). The resulting emission is observed in the green&#8208;to&#8208;orange spectral region (maxima at 520&#8211;590&#8197;nm). In contrast, under physiological pH conditions in water, the PeT process is inherently decativated, thereby enabling the observation of fluorescence in the red&#8208;to&#8208;NIR region (maxima at 650&#8211;680&#8197;nm) with appreciable quantum yields and lifetimes. The latter characteristic supported the application of the dyes in fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) of live A549 cells.

         <title>Biocatalytic Cascade Synthesis of Enantioenriched Epoxides and Triols from Biomass&#8208;Derived Synthons Driven by Specifically Designed Enzymes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 31, June 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we report the design and application of multi&#8208;step enzymatic cascades to synthesize enantioenriched epoxides and vicinal aromatic triols from simple biomass&#8208;derived starting materials in one pot. These artificial metabolic pathways involve a tailor&#8208;made aldolase, a highly evolved cofactor&#8208;independent peroxyzyme, and when needed a specifically chosen epoxide hydrolase. These attractive biocatalytic cascades can be performed under environmentally benign conditions, such as the use of aqueous media and mild temperatures, and do not require the isolation of reaction intermediates. Good to excellent conversions, high enantioselectivity, and moderate to good product yields are achieved.







Abstract
Multi&#8208;enzymatic cascades exploiting engineered enzymes are a powerful tool for the tailor&#8208;made synthesis of complex molecules from simple inexpensive building blocks. In this work, we engineered the promiscuous enzyme 4&#8208;oxalocrotonate tautomerase (4&#8208;OT) into an effective aldolase with 160&#8208;fold increased activity compared to 4&#8208;OT wild type. Subsequently, we applied the evolved 4&#8208;OT variant to perform an aldol condensation, followed by an epoxidation reaction catalyzed by a previously engineered 4&#8208;OT mutant, in a one&#8208;pot two&#8208;step cascade for the synthesis of enantioenriched epoxides (up to 98&#8201;%&#8201;ee) from biomass&#8208;derived starting materials. For three chosen substrates, the reaction was performed at milligram scale with product yields up to 68&#8201;% and remarkably high enantioselectivity. Furthermore, we developed a three&#8208;step enzymatic cascade involving an epoxide hydrolase for the production of chiral aromatic 1,2,3&#8208;prim,sec,sec&#8208;triols with high enantiopurity and good isolated yields. The reported one&#8208;pot, three&#8208;step cascade, with no intermediate isolation and being completely cofactor&#8208;less, provides an attractive route for the synthesis of chiral aromatic triols from biomass&#8208;based synthons.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Regio&#8208; and Enantioselective Ring Opening of 3,4&#8208;Epoxy Amides and Esters with Aromatic Amines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 31, June 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A carbonyl&#8208;directed regio&#8208; and enantioselective ring opening reaction of 2,3&#8208;epoxy amides and esters has been developed by use of a chiral nickel/bipyridine complex as the catalyst.







Abstract
Herein we present a nickel&#8208;catalyzed regio&#8208; and enantioselective ring opening reaction of 3,4&#8208;epoxy amides and esters with aromatic amines as nucleophiles. This method features high regiocontrol, diastereospecific SN2 reaction pathway, broad substrate scope, and mild reaction conditions, furnishing a wide range of &#947;&#8208;amino acid derivatives in a highly enantioselective manner. Notably, the selective nucleophilic attack to the C&#8208;4 position of epoxides is controlled by the directing effect of the pendant carbonyl group.

         <title>Pyridone&#8208;Doped Acenes with Improved Stability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 31, June 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of monopyridone&#8208;doped acenes from anthracene to heptacene with improved stability have been synthesized. The pyridone unit demonstrates different nature in the doped acenes depending on the molecular length. The capacity of electron transport between the face&#8208;to&#8208;face stacked acene planes is preserved.







Abstract
Besides the peripheral modification, the introduction of heteroatoms to modulate the property of longer acenes with improved chemical stability has been extensively studied for their potential applications in organic electronics. However, the utilization of 4&#8208;pyridone, a common unit in the air&#8208; and photo&#8208;stable acridone and quinacridone, to decorate higher acenes with increased stability has not been realized yet. Here we present the synthesis of a series of monopyridone&#8208;doped acenes up to heptacene via the palladium&#8208;catalyzed Buchwald&#8208;Hartwig amination of aniline and dibromo&#8208;ketone. The effect of pyridone on the property of doped acenes were investigated experimentally and computationally. With the &#960;&#8208;extension of doped acenes, the pyridone ring shows the weakened conjugation and gradual loss of aromaticity. The doped acenes demonstrate enhanced stability in solution and maintain the electronic communication between the acene planes.

         <title>Insight into the Evolution Track for the Metathesis of Alkenes within Hierarchical Zeolite&#8208;Based Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 31, June 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Evolution track within hierarchical zeolite: A new functionality of mesoporosity is disclosed as the intrazeolitic interface boundary with alumina phase, which enables the creation of evolution track for the active metathesis catalysts. The working track requires the indispensable engagements from intracrystalline mesoporous surface, alumina slices, and zeolitic Br&#248;nsted acid sites.







Abstract
The usage of hierarchical MFI zeolite enables a boost of the catalytic performance of Mo&#8208;based catalysts for the olefin&#8208;metathesis reaction. The harvest of active catalysts roots in a segmental evolution track between hierarchical zeolite and Al2O3 slices for the fabrication of active sites. The working evolution track requires the indispensable engagements from intracrystalline mesoporous surface, Al2O3 slices, and zeolitic Br&#248;nsted acid sites. The infilling of disaggregated Al2O3 slices into the intracrystalline mesopores triggers the creation of localized intrazeolite&#8722;Al2O3 interfaces, which enables the subsequent migration and trapping of surface molybdates into the micropores. The insulation of intrazeolite&#8722;Al2O3 interface or shielding of zeolitic Br&#248;nsted acid sites leads to the break of the evolution track. Our findings disclose the hidden functionality of mesoporosity as intrazeolite interface boundary for the fabrication of active sites and supply a new strategy for the rational design of zeolite catalysts.

         <title>Controlled Shell and Kernel Modifications of Atomically Precise Pd/Ag Superatomic Nanoclusters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 31, June 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first controlled modification of kernel and shell arrangements in Pd&#8208;doped superatomic silver clusters containing interstitial hydrides is presented. The sequential addition of individual Ag atoms to an icosahedron core results in PdH@Ag19, PdH@Ag20, and Pd@Ag21, while maintaining a 12&#8208;ligand stabilizing framework. Remarkable aqueous stability, proven by unsupported catalytic reduction of 4&#8208;nitrophenol was demonstrated.







Abstract
The first 8&#8208;electron Pd/Ag superatomic alloys with an interstitial hydride [PdHAg19(dtp)12] (dtp=S2P(OiPr)2&#8722;) 1 and [PdHAg20(dtp)12]+ 2 are reported. The targeted addition of a single Ag atom to 1 is achieved by the reaction of one equivalent of trifluoroacetic acid, resulting in the formation of 2 in 55&#8201;% yield. Further modification of the shell results in the formation of [PdAg21(dtp)12]+ 3 via an internal redox reaction, with the system retaining an 8&#8208;electron superatomic configuration. The interstitial hydride in 1 and 2 contributes its 1s1 electron to the superatomic electron count and occupies a PdAg3 tetrahedron. The distributions of isomers corresponding to different dispositions of the outer capping Ag atoms are investigated by multinuclear VT&#8197;NMR spectroscopy. The emissive state of 3 has a lifetime of 200&#8197;&#956;s (&#955;ex=448; &#955;em=842), while 1 and 2 are non&#8208;emissive. The catalytic reduction of 4&#8208;nitrophenol is demonstrated with 1&#8211;3 at room temperature.

The afterglow of coinage metal complexes synthesized by using novel coumarin&#8208;functionalized aminodiphosphine ligands is depicted. A hybrid character of the ligand led to compounds with afterglow luminescence at low temperatures, which is clearly visible to the naked eye after the UV excitation is turned off. More information can be found in the Research Article by P.&#8197;W. Roesky and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202300497). Artwork: Vanitha Reddy Naina and Lakshmi Prabha Edappilly.

BASHY dyes, such as the one drawn in the foreground, are prepared in a multicomponent reaction. This is symbolized by the background, which shows part of a beach that is made of sea&#8208;washed stones and which is located in the North of Portugal (Praia de Belinho). The BASHY dyes discussed in the Research Article by P.&#8197;M.&#8197;P. Gois, U. Pischel and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202300579) show several photophysical features such as fluorescence, intramolecular charge transfer (ICT), and photoinduced electron transfer (PeT), which jointly orchestrate the function of the dye.

Carbon dots are widely applied for fluorescent&#8208;based sensors. The interplay between dynamic and static quenching is essential to design specific sensors.







Abstract
The pollution caused by heavy metals (HMs) may occur through both natural processes and anthropogenic activities and is found in complex media. The purpose of this review is to summarize the state&#8208;of&#8208;art of fluorescent CDs and the sensing applications in a systematic manner. This review intends to provide clues on the origin on the observed selectivity in chemiluminiscence sensors, which was until now a stated but unaddressed question, and still remains open for debate. Indeed, it is tempting to think that CDs possessing functional groups with soft bases at the surface are able to detect soft metal acids, while the opposite is to be suspected for hard acid&#8208;base pairs. However, the literature shows several examples where this trend does not hold. We found that such observation is explained by the involvement of dynamic quenching, which does not involve the formation of a non&#8208;fluorescent complex, as in the case of static quenching. We have provided an interpretation of published data that was not provided by the original authors and offer guidelines to enable the design of CDs to target ions in solution.

Herein, we achieved an effective inner&#8208;space modification for an open&#8208;cage C60 derivative by insertion of a neutral CH3CN molecule into the cavity. The thus obtained CH3CN@open&#8208;C60 was found to show an enhanced polarity, affording an easy separation from a mixture containing the empty cage by column chromatography on silica gel, without preparative HPLC that was needed for the previous cases. The less negative reduction potentials with respect to those of empty cage reflect the decreased energy level of the LUMO, which is supported by the DFT calculations. It was revealed that both presence of the encapsulated CH3CN and cage deformation caused by the CH3CN play an essential role for the change in the electronic properties, studied by NMR spectroscopy, single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis, and theoretical calculations. Furthermore, the favored binding affinity of deuterated acetonitrile CD3CN with internal C60 surface was discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Hantzsch ester as efficient and economical NAD(P)H mimic for in vitro bioredox reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biocatalysis has emerged as a valuable and reliable tool for industrial and academic societies, particularly in bioredox reactions&#8208;related fields. The cost of cofactors, especially those needed to be replenished at stoichiometric amounts or more, is the chief economic concern for bioredox reactions. In this study, a readily accessible, inexpensive, and bench&#8208;stable Hantzsch ester is verified as the viable and efficient NAD(P)H mimic by four enzymatic redox transformations including two non&#8208;heme diiron N&#8208;oxygenases and two flavin&#8208;dependent reductases. This finding provides the potential to significantly reduce the costs of NAD(P)H&#8208;relying bioredox reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>London Dispersion Effects on the Stability of Heavy Tetrel Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>London dispersion (LD) interactions, which stem from long&#8208;range electron correlations arising from instantaneously induced dipoles can occur between neighboring atoms or molecules, for example, between H atoms within ligand C&#8211;H groups. These interactions are currently of interest as a new method of stabilizing long bonds and species with unusual oxidation states. They can also limit reactivity by installing LD enhanced groups into organic frameworks or ligand substituents. Here, we address the most recent advances in the design of LD enhanced ligands, the sterically counterintuitive structures that can be generated and the consequences that these interactions can have on the structures and reactivity of sterically crowded heavy group 14 species.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&lt;p&gt;Photochromic fluorescent molecules dramatically extend their fields of applications ranging from optical memories, bioimaging, photoswitches, photonic devices, anti&#8208;counterfeiting technology and many more. Here, we have logically designed and synthesized a triazole appended &lt;a name="_Hlk114846063"&gt;bis&#8208;(dithienylethene&lt;/a&gt;)&#8208;naphthalenediimide based photo&#8208;responsive material, &lt;strong&gt;5&lt;/strong&gt;, which demonstrated fluorescence enhancement property upon photocyclization (F&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.42), with high photocyclization (44 s, k&lt;sub&gt;solution&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.0355 s&lt;sup&gt;&#8208;1&lt;/sup&gt;, k&lt;sub&gt;solid &lt;/sub&gt;= 0.0135 s&lt;sup&gt;&#8208;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and photocycloreversion (160 s, k&lt;sub&gt;solution&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.0181 s&lt;sup&gt;&#8208;1&lt;/sup&gt;, k&lt;sub&gt;solid&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.0085 s&lt;sup&gt;&#8208;1&lt;/sup&gt;) rate and decent photoreaction quantum yield (F&lt;sub&gt;o&amp;rarr;c&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.93 and F&lt;sub&gt;c&amp;rarr;o&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.11). The open isomer almost converted to the closed isomer at photo&#8208;stationary state (&lt;st1:stockticker w:st="on"&gt;PSS&lt;/st1:stockticker&gt;) with distinct color change from colorless to blue with 92.85% conversion yield. A reversible noninvasive modulation of fluorescence through efficient photoinduced electron transfer (PET) process was observed both in solution as well as in solid state. The fluorescence modulation through PET process was further corroborated with thermodynamic calculations using Rehm&#8208;Weller equation and quantum chemical studies (DFT). The thermally stable compound &lt;strong&gt;5 &lt;/strong&gt;exhibits high fatigue resistance property (up to 50 cycles) both in solution and solid state. Furthermore, the compound &lt;strong&gt;5 &lt;/strong&gt;was successfully applied as erasable ink and in deciphering secret codes (Quick Response/bar code) portending potential promising application in anti&#8208;counterfeiting.&lt;/p&gt;</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The first case of successful suppression of the coordination of a lithium atom with a dialkylamino group by the effective conjugation of the latter with the aromatic core has been discovered. This effect controls regioselectivity of the bromine&#8208;lithium exchange in 4,6,7,9&#8208;tetrabromo&#8208;1,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1H&#8208;perimidine, which leads to products with the most effective conjugation. As a result, the product of this quadruple exchange demonstrates no tendency of the coordination of the NMe groups to neighboring lithium atoms despite the absence of steric restrictions. Experimental results are explained by means of quantum chemical calculations: geometry optimization, natural bond analysis and scans using the modredundant scheme.</dc:description>

Subsequent isolation of FP(&#956;&#8208;N)2S in cryogenic matrices (Ar, Ne, and N2) allows its characterization with matrix&#8208;isolation IR and UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy by combination with 15N&#8208;isotope labeling and computations at the CCSD(T)&#8208;F12a/VTZ&#8208;F12 level of theory. Upon visible&#8208;light irradiation at 550 nm, this cyclic compound undergoes ring&#8208;opening to the thiazyl isomer FPNSN, followed by dissociation to FP and SN2 under subsequent UV&#8208;irradiation at 365 nm.

         <title>New Generation of Benzidine Wide&#8208;Gap Conjugated Materials: Solution Processing a Classic Evaporated Scaffold</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benzidine&#8208;type wide&#8208;gap materials are designed in order to access green processing techniques, via functionalization with solubilizing pendant groups. Flexible thin films and organic electronic devices are then prepared from low&#8208;toxic solvent such as alcohols or o&#8208;xylenes.

Carbazole&#8208; and fluorene&#8208;substituted benzidine blocks have been functionalized with two different solubilizing pendant groups, in order to enhance the material's solubility in greener solvents. Preserving the optical and electrochemical properties, the aromatic function and substitution showed an important influence on the solvent affinity, achieving concentrations up to 150&#8197;mg/mL in o&#8208;xylenes for the glycol&#8208;containing materials and decent solubility in alcohols for the compounds functionalized with ionic chains. The latter solution proved to be ideal for the preparation of luminescence slot&#8208;die coating film on top of flexible&#8208;substrates up to 33&#8197;cm&#215;2&#8197;cm. As a proof of concept, the materials have been implemented in different organic electronic devices, highlighting the low turn&#8208;on voltage (4&#8197;V) presented by organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs), which is comparable with vacuum&#8208;processed devices. A structure&#8208;solubility relationship and a synthetic strategy are disentangled in this manuscript to tailor organic semiconductors and adapt their solubility towards the desired solvent and application.

         <title>A Dormant Reagent Reaction&#8208;Diffusion Method for the Generation of Co&#8208;Fe Prussian Blue Analogue Periodic Precipitate Particle Libraries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
For preparation of particle size libraries of products with low solubility constants, a new reaction&#8208;diffusion method is presented through the example of a catalytically valuable Prussian Blue analogue. The particle size analyses of the Liesegang Patterns forming via &#8216;dormant&#8217; citrate complex show the method produces libraries of differently sized products in each band. The new method can be expanded into other PBAs and 2D diffusion systems.







Abstract
Liesegang patterns that develop as a result of reaction&#8208;diffusion can simultaneously form products with slightly different sizes spatially separated in a single medium. We show here a reaction&#8208;diffusion method using a dormant reagent (citrate) for developing Liesegang patterns of cobalt hexacyanoferrate Prussian Blue analog (PBA) particle libraries. This method slows the precipitation reaction and produces different&#8208;sized particles in a gel medium at different locations. The gel&#8208;embedded particles are still catalytically active. Finally, the applicability of the new method to other PBAs and 2D systems is presented. The method proves promising for obtaining similar inorganic framework libraries with catalytic abilities.

         <title>Boosting Methanol&#8208;Mediated CO2 Hydrogenation into Aromatics by Synergistically Tailoring Oxygen Vacancy and Acid Site Properties of Multifunctional Catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synergistically tailoring oxygen vacancy and acid site properties of multifunctional catalyst composed of Cr2O3 and H&#8208;ZSM&#8208;5 guarantees the superior aromatics synthesis performance of CO2 hydrogenation in a single&#8208;pass. The structure&#8208;function relationship between aromatics synthesis performance and the different catalytic components is well established to boost aromatics synthesis from CO2 hydrogenation.







Abstract
Even though the direct hydrogenation of CO2 into aromatics has been realized via a methanol&#8208;mediated pathway and multifunctional catalyst, few works have been focused on the simultaneously rational design of each component in multifunctional catalyst to improve the performance. Also, the structure&#8208;function relationship between aromatics synthesis performance and the different catalytic components (reducible metal oxide and acidic zeolite) has been rarely investigated. Herein, we increase the oxygen vacancy (Ov) density in reducible Cr2O3 by sequential carbonization and oxidation (SCO) treatments of Cr&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks. Thanks to the enriched Ov, Cr2O3&#8208;based catalyst affords high methanol selectivity of 98.1&#8201;% (without CO) at a CO2 conversion of 16.8&#8201;% under high reaction temperature (350&#8201;&#176;C). Furthermore, after combining with the acidic zeolite H&#8208;ZSM&#8208;5, the multifunctional catalyst realizes the direct conversion of CO2 into aromatics with conversion and selectivity as high as 25.4&#8201;% and 80.1&#8201;% (without CO), respectively. The property of acid site in H&#8208;ZSM&#8208;5, especially the Al species that located at the intersection of straight and sinusoidal channels, plays a vital role in enhancing the aromatics selectivity, which can be precisely controlled by varying the hydrothermal synthesis conditions. Our work provides a synergistic strategy to boost the aromatics synthesis performance from CO2 hydrogenation.

         <title>Thienyl&#8208;Substituted Diboranes(4): Electronic Stabilization of Radicals Versus Increased Reactivity towards Bond Activation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thienyl substituents at a diborane(4) provide a mixture of steric flexibility, &#963;&#8208;electron&#8208;withdrawing and mesomeric effects, which enable the stabilization of a highly delocalized diboron radical anion, as well as an increased reactivity towards bond activation and rearrangement reactions upon Lewis&#8208;base coordination and two&#8208;electron reduction.







Abstract
Low&#8208;valent main group chemistry involves a balancing act between steric and electronic stabilization of the electron&#8208;rich low oxidation state main group centers and their desired reactivity. Herein we show that the combination of sterically shielding mesityl and rotationally flexible 2&#8208;thienyl groups, the latter having the potential to be either electronically stabilizing or activating, at a diborane(4) provides a platform for both radical anion stabilization and unusual bond activation and rearrangement reactions. The addition of a Lewis base to a 1,2&#8208;dimesityl&#8208;1,2&#8208;dithienyldiborane(4) (1) results in direct and unprecedented C&#8722;H borylation of one thienyl substituent with cleavage of the B&#8722;B bond. The facile one&#8208;electron reduction of 1 yields a stable diboron radical anion through delocalization of its unpaired electron over the entire planar 1,2&#8208;dithienyldiboron framework, as evidenced by EPR spectroscopy and DFT calculations. The two&#8208;electron reduction of 1 with magnesium anthracene under more forcing conditions results in B&#8722;B bond cleavage and replacement of one thienyl sulfur atom by a mesitylboron moiety, leading to the formation of a magnesium complex of an &#951;5&#8208;diborafulvene dianion. Salt metathesis of the latter with [(&#951;6&#8208;p&#8208;cymene)RuCl2] affords a mixed ruthenium sandwich complex of an &#951;5&#8208;borylborole dianion. Calculations highlight both the structural and electronic changes in the boron&#8208;substituted heterocyclic C4B dianion upon switching coordination from magnesium (diborafulvene dianion) to ruthenium (borylborole dianion).

         <title>Structural Self&#8208;Assembly and Applications of Metal&#8211;Organic Molecular Containers with Flexible Backbones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8211;organic molecular containers (MOMCs), constructed with flexible backbones, exhibit a unique feature both in the structural construction and applications, due to the free rotation and self&#8208;adaptively of the functional groups in the skeletons. This Review focuses on the recent development of flexible MOMCs from the aspects of self&#8208;assembly construction to the various applications, which remains a fertile ground for opportunity and creativity.







Abstract
Supramolecular chemistry has become an interdisciplinary discipline of chemistry, physics, and biology. As a huge subunit of supramolecular compounds, the functional metal&#8211;organic supramolecular systems with well&#8208;defined cavities which are able to accommodate size&#8208;suitable guests via benign host&#8208;guest behavior, have been known as &#8220;metal&#8211;organic molecular containers&#8221; (MOMCs) and attracted much attentions for their rich chemical properties and wide potential applications in molecular recognition, catalysis, bio&#8208;medical and other fields. In particular, the MOMCs with flexible backbones exhibit a unique feature both in the aspect of structural construction and applications, due to the free rotation and self&#8208;adaptively of the specific functional groups in the skeletons. In this paper, we review several selected examples of the coordination&#8208;driven metal&#8211;organic supramolecular systems from the aspects of self&#8208;assembly construction to the various applications. The self&#8208;assembly strategies, especially the different choice of organic ligands with flexible backbones during the construction, leading to quite diverse configurations compared to the rigid ligands, have been also discussed to show a different perspective of metal&#8211;organic system construction.

         <title>Electronic and Charge Transport Properties in Bridged versus Unbridged Nanohoops: Role of the Nanohoop Size</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Experimental/theoretical investigations link the size of a nanohoop to its charge transport properties, which are key in organic electronics. the first cyclocarbazole possessing five constituting building units was synthesized and studied. Comparison of the photophysical, electrochemical, morphological and charge transport properties with those of a shorter analogue highlights the key role played by the hoop size. Corresponding cycloparaphenylenes with eight and ten phenyl units were also compared. Notably the saturated field effect mobility of the five&#8208;unit cyclocarbazole is four times higher than that of its smaller analogue.







Abstract
In the field of &#960;&#8208;conjugated nanohoops, the size of the macrocycle has a strong impact on its structural characteristics, which in turn affect its electronic properties. In this work, we report the first experimental investigations linking the size of a nanohoop to its charge transport properties, a key property in organic electronics. We describe the synthesis and study of the first example of a cyclocarbazole possessing five constituting building units, namely [5]&#8208;cyclo&#8208;N&#8208;butyl&#8208;2,7&#8208;carbazole, [5]C&#8208;Bu&#8208;Cbz. By comparison with a shorter analogue, [4]&#8208;cyclo&#8208;N&#8208;butyl&#8208;2,7&#8208;carbazole, [4]C&#8208;Bu&#8208;Cbz, we detail the photophysical, electrochemical, morphological and charge transport properties, highlighting the key role played by the hoop size. In particular, we show that the saturated field effect mobility of [5]C&#8208;Bu&#8208;Cbz is four times higher than that of its smaller analogue [4]C&#8208;Bu&#8208;Cbz (4.22&#215;10&#8722;5 vs 1.04&#215;10&#8722;5&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1). However, the study of the other organic field&#8208;effect transistor characteristics (threshold voltage VTH and subthreshold slope SS) suggest that a small nanohoop is beneficial for good organization of the molecules in thin films, whereas a large one increases the density of structural defects, and hence of traps for the charge carriers. The present findings are of interest for the further development of nanohoops in electronics.

         <title>18F&#8208;Labeling Chemistry in Aqueous Media</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The direct incorporation of 18F into target molecules of interest in aqueous media has many practical advantages. This paper classifies the atoms that form covalent bonds with fluorine and reviews the existing methods for 18F&#8208;labeling in aqueous media. Additionally, some 18F&#8208;labeling mechanisms are explained.







Abstract
18F&#8208;Labeled molecular tracers and subsequent positron emission tomography are indispensable molecular imaging tools in medical diagnosis and research. The preparation of 18F&#8208;labeled molecular tracers involves critical steps such as the 18F&#8208;labeling reaction, work&#8208;up, and 18F&#8208;product purification, which are governed by 18F&#8208;labeling chemistry. Since direct incorporation of 18F in aqueous media exhibits many advantages in practice, this Review summarizes the existing 18F&#8208;labeling methods in aqueous media, which are sorted by atoms forming chemical covalent bonds with F. The Review is focused on the respective reaction mechanism, the water effect and the applications of these methods for the development of 18F&#8208;radiopharmaceuticals. The research progress on aqueous nucleophilic labeling methods using [18F]F&#8722; as the 18F source has been mainly discussed.

         <title>Impact of Faradaic Interlayer Confinement and Carbon&#8208;Centered Macrostructure Designs for Ion Capture and the Recovery of Elements</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the context of desalination and renewable energy, several capacitive deionization processes and variables responsible for ion capture and the recovery of elements are reviewed.







Abstract
Environmental protection associated with renewable energy is among the most critical challenges for translational ion&#8208;capture based on capacitive storage of ions in electrical double layers at the interface of electrode and electrolyte. Electric double&#8208;layer capacitance with charge induction and faradaic pseudo&#8208;capacitance with charge transfer classifies the capacitance of the electrochemical interface. The electrochemical interface in most energy technologies involves porous and pseudocapacitive redox materials that offer varying degrees of electrolyte confinement. In this review, we discuss the factors affecting water desalination, such as the effect of nanopores for ion capture, the ion sieving effect, the effect of hydration energy, and hydration radius in the carbon sub&#8208;nanometer pore. Moreover, the surface phenomena of electrodes, including carbon corrosion, and the potential of zero charge to control the oxidation of carbon electrodes are explained along with protection mechanisms. The various capacitive deionization (CDI) operations and the corresponding electrochemical cell technologies are briefly introduced, including the significance of double&#8208;layer charging materials with faradaic intercalation, which suffer less from co&#8208;ion expulsion. Finally, we revisit the effects of various nanoarchitectures and the construction of capacitive deionization electrodes for clean water technology.

         <title>Interaction Modes Between SF4 and Ketones; Study of Intermediates in Deoxofluorination Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Acetone and SF4 form two thermally unstable adducts. In the presence of HF and SF4, 2&#8208;adamantanone forms an adduct with a unique O&#8212;(HF)&#8212;S interaction motif that elucidates possible interactions during deoxofluorination of ketones. Based on NPA charges, the C=O&#8212;HF and F3SF&#8212;HF interactions are deemed competitive.







Abstract
Interactions between ketones and SF4 are studied for the simplest ketone, acetone, and the bulky polycyclic 2&#8208;adamantanone. Acetone forms the 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 adduct SF4&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;[O=C(CH3)2]2, as well as the dimeric 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 adducts [SF4&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;O=C(CH3)2]2 as identified by low&#8208;temperature Raman spectroscopy and, for the latter, X&#8208;ray crystallography. In both adducts, SF4 acts as a double chalcogen&#8208;bond donor to two keto groups. In contrast 2&#8208;adamantanone does not form an isolable solid adduct with SF4; in the presence of HF, however, it forms SF4&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;O=C10H14O&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;HF, which comprises chains with weak S&#8212;O and S&#8212;FH chalcogen bonds in the crystal structure. Sulfur tetrafluoride in this compound is readily lost at &#8722;85&#8201;&#176;C, leading to the isolation of C10H14O&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;HF at low temperature. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations aid in vibrational assignments and serve to describe the interactions of the keto group with SF4 and HF, as well as interactions between SF4 with HF. It is found that separate and combined CO&#8212;HF and CO&#8212;SF4 chalcogen bonds do not polarize the C=O group to any significant degree.

         <title>Intramolecular Hiyama Coupling: Synthesis of 1,8,13&#8208;Trisubstituted Chiral Triptycenes with Three Different Substituents by Intramolecular Substituent Transfer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The proximity of Si&#8722;O&#8722;Pd plays an important role not only in the formation of the oxy&#8208;palladium species in intramolecular Hiyama coupling, but also in the activation of the silyl group to facilitate intramolecular substituent transfer. Various 1,8,13&#8208;trisubstituted chiral triptycenes were synthesized by using this reaction. More information can be found in the Research Article by T. Iwata, M. Shindo, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202300988).

         <title>Electrospray Ionization Tandem Mass Spectrometry with Collision&#8208;Induced Dissociation of Uranyl Peroxide Nanoclusters Containing Various Uranyl Bridging Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Detecting the presence of uranyl peroxide nanoclusters (UPCs) in solution is difficult, so this study used tandem mass spectrometry with collision&#8208;induced dissociation to probe bridging ions surrounding the uranyl ion and to determine fragmentation fingerprints of UPCs. The image shows an abstract artistic representation of the nanocluster U24Pp12, [(UO2)24(O2)24(P2O7)12]48&#8211;, and its movement through a quadrupole mass analyzer with subsequent fragmentation. More information can be found in the Research Article by V.&#8197;G. Rodriguez and P.&#8197;C. Burns (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202300794). Image designed by V.G.R.

         <dc:description>We demonstrate a quadruple N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene/cobalt/photoredox/Br&#248;nsted base catalysis to realize branch&#8208;selective hydroacylation of styrenes with aromatic and aliphatic aldehydes. This protocol allows access to branched ketones from readily available materials in an atom&#8208;economical manner. The quadruple catalysis can transfer a formyl hydrogen of aldehydes as a hydrogen radical equivalent onto the terminal carbon of an alkene by controlled electron and proton transfers.</dc:description>

         <title>Amide Skeletal Elongation via Amino Acid Insertion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Amide derivatization is useful to access valuable organic compounds considering the ready availability of molecules containing amide functionality. Current approaches to derivatize amide mainly focus on the synthesis of carbonyl&#8208;containing compounds and amines. Incorporating both parts of the initial amide into the new derivatives is rare. Herein, we describe a simple and practical amide derivatization through amino acid insertion to prepare more complex amides. This insertion is applicable to all amino acids and more importantly, the chiral information is completely conserved during the insertion. Comparison of this insertion strategy with conventional amide synthesis demonstrates the synthetic advantages of this new protocol.</dc:description>

         <title>Natural Light&#8208;Regulated Switchable Self&#8208;Adhesive Supramolecular Films for Smart Windows</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Switchable self&#8208;adhesive films are promising coating materials for constructing smart windows. Compared to commonly used hydrogels, self&#8208;adhesive supramolecular films have a variety of advantages and serve as a universal carrier of stimuli&#8208;responsiveness. In this study, supramolecular adhesive is processed into self&#8208;adhesive films, which display tough and long&#8208;stable adhesion to commercially available organic/inorganic glass windows. Spiropyrans are used as the photo&#8208;responsive units to endow smart windows with switchable optical behavior. Reverse photochromism is successfully realized by the combination of supramolecular films and spiropyrans. Reversible and rapid transformations in the color and transmittance of smart windows are fully achieved by natural light irradiation in different weather conditions, including sunny, rainy, and cloudy.</dc:description>

         <title>Investigating Design Rules for Photoinduced Electron Transfer Quenching in Triangulenium Probes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorescent probes based on photoinduced electron transfer (PET) quenching of long lifetime triangulenium fluorophores have found multiple applications. For such probes a successful design relies on the right balance between the rates of PET quenching and fluorescence. In a series of ADOTA (A) and DAOTA (D) triangulenium fluorophores appended with aniline&#8208;like quencher moieties, we have investigated the rates of quenching and its relation to thermodynamic driving force, distance, and conjugation within the quencher moiety. Three different quenchers, a short (1), a long (2), and a long twisted (3), 4&#8208;aminophenyl, 4&#8217;&#8208;aminobiphenyl, and 2,2&#8217;&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;4&#8217;&#8208;aminobiphenyl, respectively were investigated. Time&#8208;resolved fluorescence measurement was used to measure PET rate constant&#160;kPET&#160;ranging from &gt;4x1011&#160;s&#8208;1&#160;to 2x109&#160;s&#8208;1. Interestingly, PET quenching is equally efficient/fast from&#160;1&#160;and&#160;2, even with increase in distance between the donor and the acceptor. However, when twisting the biphenyl in&#160;3, a 20&#8208;fold decrease in quenching is found. Even with the decrease in&#160;kPET&#160;the quenching in&#160;3A/D&#160;is still highly efficient, with nearly 99% quenching. The study show that long lifetime fluorophores can be efficiently switched even by relative slow PET processes and that PET quencher moieties can be removed far from the fluorophore if conjugated linkers are applied.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalysis by KDM6 Histone Demethylases &#8211; A Synergy between the Non&#8208;Heme Iron(II) Center, Second Coordination Sphere, and Long&#8208;Range Interactions</title>

         <dc:description>KDM6A (UTX) and KDM6B (JMJD3) are human non&#8208;heme Fe(II) and 2&#8208;oxoglutarate (2OG) dependent JmjC oxygenases that catalyze the demethylation of trimethylated lysine 27 in the N&#8208;terminal tail of histone H3, a post&#8208;translational modification that regulates transcription. We performed Combined Quantum Mechanics/ Molecular Mechanics and Molecular Dynamics study on the catalytic mechanism of KDM6A/B.&#160;The results reveal that the transition state for the rate&#8208;limiting hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) reaction in KDM6A/B catalysis is stabilized by polar (Asn217) and aromatic (Trp369)/non&#8208;polar (Pro274) residues in contrast to KDM4 and KDM7 demethylases where charged residues (Glu, Arg, Asp) are involved.&#160;KDM6A employs both &#963;&#8208; and &#960;&#8208;electron transfer pathways for HAT, whereas KDM6B employs the &#963;&#8208;electron pathway. Differences in hydrogen bonding of the Fe&#8208;chelating Glu252(KDM6B) contribute to the lower energy barriers in KDM6B vs. KDM6A.&#160;The study reveals a dependence of the activation barrier of the rebound hydroxylation on the Fe&#8208;O&#8208;C angle in the transition state of KDM6A. Anti&#8208;correlation of the Zn&#8208;binding domain with the active site residues is a key factor distinguishing KDM6A/B from KDM7/4s. The results reveal the importance of communication between the Fe center, second coordination sphere, and long&#8208;range interactions in catalysis by KDMs and, by implication, other 2OG oxygenases.</dc:description>

         <title>Late&#8208;Stage, Stereoretentive, and Site&#8208;Selective Modification of Synthetic Peptides by Using Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoredox&#8208;catalysed reaction of activated thioethers unveils alanyl radical intermediates in a stereoretentive and site&#8208;selective manner. Installation of the activating group is simple, and the intermediate radical can react with non&#8208;activated alkenes to form non&#8208;natural residues bearing aliphatic, hydrophobic units. The method is applicable to late&#8208;stage peptide functionalisation and expands the scope of analogues that can be accessed.







Abstract
Late&#8208;stage functionalisation is an attractive method to generate peptide analogues containing non&#8208;natural residues. It is shown that cysteine residues can be activated as Crich&#8208;type thioethers, either by alkylation of a synthetic cysteine&#8208;continuing peptide or by incorporation of a modified cysteine unit into solid phase or solution phase peptide synthesis. Photoredox catalysed reaction of the thioether generates an alanyl radical intermediate in a stereoretentive and site&#8208;selective manner, even in the presence of free cysteine residues. The radical can react with non&#8208;activated alkenes to form non&#8208;natural residues bearing aliphatic, hydrophobic units. A method to avoid unwanted alkylation of amine residues was identified and the process was applied to the functionalization of both linear and cyclic synthetic peptides.

         <title>[Ni(CO)4]+ as NiI Synthon: Synthesis and Characterization of NiI Half&#8208;Sandwich and Sandwich Cations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 19&#8201;valence electron, half&#8208;sandwich cations [Ni(arene)(CO)2]+ (arene=C6H6, C6H4F2) and the homoleptic [Ni(C6H4F2)2]+ were synthesized endergonically from [Ni(CO)4]+[F{Al(ORF)3}2]&#8722; (RF=C(CF3)3) by irreversible removal of CO from the equilibrium. This procedure is likely transferable to any kind of weak ligand. The [Ni(C6H4F2)2]+ cation revealed an unprecedented &#951;3,&#951;3&#8208;slipped sandwich structure which probably is the ultimate NiI source.







Abstract
The stable, easily accessible salt [Ni(CO)4]+[F{Al(ORF)3}2]&#8722; (RF=C(CF3)3) was used as a NiI synthon to generate the novel half&#8208;sandwich complexes [Ni(arene)(CO)2]+ (arene=C6H6, o&#8208;dfb=1,2&#8208;F2C6H4). By irreversible removal of CO from the equilibrium, even the rather endergonic reaction to a [Ni(o&#8208;dfb)2]+ salt was successful (&#916;rG&#176;(solv)=+78&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1). The latter displays an unprecedented slipped &#951;3,&#951;3&#8208;sandwich structure and is the ultimate synthon to NiI&#8208;chemistry.

         <title>Secondary Amine&#8208;Mediated Domino Reaction for the Synthesis of Substituted Quinolines from Dicyanoalkenes and Enynals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multi&#8208;substituted quinoline derivatives were synthesized from dicyanoalkenes and unsaturated aldehydes via an organocatalyst&#8208;mediated domino reaction in excellent yields. Two catalytic system were established including diphenylprolinol silyl ether and di(2&#8208;ethyl)hexylamine. As catalyst is the amine and a by&#8208;product is only water, this is an environmentally benign reaction.







Abstract
Substituted quinolines, tricyclic and tetracyclic molecules with a quinoline moiety are synthesized by a domino reaction from dicyanoalkenes and 3&#8208;aryl&#8208;pent&#8208;2&#8208;en&#8208;4&#8208;ynals in one pot. We established two methods: one is catalyzed by chiral diphenylprolinol silyl ether, and the other is catalyzed by di(2&#8208;ethyl)hexylamine, in combination with p&#8208;nitrophenol.

As the catalysts are secondary amines, and water is the only by&#8208;product, this is an environmentally benign synthetic method for the preparation of substituted quinolines.

     alt="Secondary Amine-Mediated Domino Reaction for the Synthesis of Substituted Quinolines from Dicyanoalkenes and Enynals"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Multi-substituted quinoline derivatives&lt;/b&gt; were synthesized from dicyanoalkenes and unsaturated aldehydes via an organocatalyst-mediated domino reaction in excellent yields. Two catalytic system were established including diphenylprolinol silyl ether and di(2-ethyl)hexylamine. As catalyst is the amine and a by-product is only water, this is an environmentally benign reaction.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Substituted quinolines, tricyclic and tetracyclic molecules with a quinoline moiety are synthesized by a domino reaction from dicyanoalkenes and 3-aryl-pent-2-en-4-ynals in one pot. We established two methods: one is catalyzed by chiral diphenylprolinol silyl ether, and the other is catalyzed by di(2-ethyl)hexylamine, in combination with &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-nitrophenol. A wide variety of dicyanoalkenes can be employed. As the catalysts are secondary amines, and water is the only by-product, this is an environmentally benign synthetic method for the preparation of substituted quinolines.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High Rates of Quinone&#8208;Alkyne Cycloaddition Reactions are Dictated by Entropic Factors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Second&#8208;order rate constants for the SPOCQ click reaction between an ortho&#8208;quinone and various strained systems are accurately determined. Thermodynamic activation parameters of the click reaction with two strained alkynes were determined using Eyring plots, and show that the reaction is controlled by entropic factors.







Abstract
Reaction rates of strained cycloalkynes and cycloalkenes with 1,2&#8208;quinone were quantified by stopped flow UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy and computational analysis. We found that the strained alkyne BCN&#8722;OH 3 (k2 1824&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1) reacts &gt;150&#8197;times faster than the strained alkene TCO&#8208;OH 5 (k2 11.56&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1), and that derivatization with a carbamate can lead to a reduction of the rate constant with almost half. Also, the 8&#8208;membered strained alkyne BCN&#8722;OH 3 reacts 16&#8197;times faster than the more strained 7&#8208;membered THS 2 (k2 110.6&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1). Using the linearized Eyring equation we determined the thermodynamic activation parameters of these two strained alkynes, revealing that the SPOCQ reaction of quinone 1 with THS 2 is associated with &#916;H&#8800; of 0.80&#8197;kcal/mol, &#916;S&#8800;=&#8722;46.8 cal/K&#8901;mol, and &#916;G&#8800;=14.8&#8197;kcal/mol (at 25&#8201;&#176;C), whereas the same reaction with BCN&#8722;OH 3 is associated with, &#916;H&#8800;=2.25&#8197;kcal/mol, &#916;S&#8800;=&#8722;36.3 cal/K&#8901;mol, and &#916;G&#8800;=13.1&#8197;kcal/mol (at 25&#8201;&#176;C). Computational analysis supported the values obtained by the stopped&#8208;flow measurements, with calculated &#916;G&#8800; of 15.6&#8197;kcal/mol (in H2O) for the SPOCQ reaction with THS 2, and with &#916;G&#8800; of 14.7&#8197;kcal/mol (in H2O) for the SPOCQ reaction with BCN&#8722;OH 3. With these empirically determined thermodynamic parameters, we set an important step towards a more fundamental understanding of this set of rapid click reactions.

         <title>De&#8208;Novo Design of pre&#8208;miR&#8208;21 Maturation Inhibitors: Synthesis and Activity Assessment</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A RNA&#8208;focused library targeted against the production of the oncogenic microRNA&#8208;21 was designed and synthesized according to a five&#8208;step sustainable approach. Low&#8208;micromolar affinities towards pre&#8208;miR&#8208;2, good selectivity against other nucleic acid structures and promising inhibition activity (in the two&#8208;digit micromolar range) in Dicer processing of the pre&#8208;miR&#8208;21 were determined for a trifluoromethyl&#8208;functionalized derivative.







Abstract
Targeting RNA with small molecules is a major challenge of current medicinal chemistry, and the identification and design of original scaffolds able to selectively interact with an RNA target remains difficult. Various approaches have been developed based on classical medicinal chemistry strategies (fragment&#8208;based drug design, dynamic combinatorial chemistry, HTS or DNA&#8208;encoded libraries) as well as on advanced structural biology and biochemistry methodologies (such as X&#8208;ray, cryo&#8208;EM, NMR, or SHAPE). Here, we report the de novo design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of RNA ligands by using a straightforward and sustainable chemistry combined with molecular docking and biochemical and biophysical studies that allowed us to identify a novel pharmacophore for RNA binding. Specifically, we focused on targeting the biogenesis of microRNA&#8208;21, the well&#8208;known oncogene. This led us not only to promising inhibitors but also to a better understanding of the interactions between the small&#8208;molecule compounds and the RNA target paving the way for the rational design of efficient inhibitors with potential anticancer activity.

         <title>HAV&#8208;Peptides Attached to Colloidal Probes Faithfully Detect E&#8208;Cadherins Displayed on Living Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
With a minimum of chemistry, we developed a tool based on functionalized colloidal probes that mimic the presence of adjacent cells detecting the presence of E&#8208;cadherins on the cell surface. The specificity and dynamic strength of the peptide&#8208;E&#8208;cadherin interaction can be read out demonstrating the potential for a label&#8208;free screening of cell surfaces.







Abstract
Cell adhesion molecules are crucial for a variety of biological processes, including wound healing, barrier formation and tissue homeostasis. One of them is E&#8208;cadherin which is generally found at adherent junctions between epithelial cells. To identify this molecule on the surface of cells, E&#8208;cadherin mimetic peptides with a critical amino acid sequence of HAV (histidine&#8208;alanine&#8208;valine) were synthesized and attached to solid&#8208;supported membranes covering colloidal probes. Two different functionalization strategies were established, one based on the complexation of DOGS&#8208;NTA(Ni) with a polyhistidine&#8208;tagged HAV&#8208;peptide and the other one relying on the formation of a HAV&#8208;lipopeptide using in&#8197;situ maleimide&#8208;thiol coupling. Binding studies were performed to verify the ability of the peptides to attach to the membrane surface. Compared to the non&#8208;covalent attachment via the His&#8208;tag, we achieved a higher yield by lipopeptide formation. Colloidal probes functionalized with HAV&#8208;peptides were employed to measure the presence of E&#8208;cadherins on living cells either using video particle tracking or force spectroscopy. Here, human HaCaT cells were examined confirming the specific interaction of the HAV&#8208;peptide with the E&#8208;cadherin of the cells. Statistical methods were also used to determine the number of single&#8208;bond ruptures and the force of a single bond. These findings may be essential for the development of novel biosynthetic materials given their potential to become increasingly relevant in medical applications.

         <title>Intermolecular Triazene Alkene Cycloaddition via Lewis Base Catalysis: Access to Diverse Trifluoromethylated Pyrazolines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient Lewis base catalytic transformation to functionalized 3&#8208; and 5&#8208;trifluoromethylpyrazolines is developed via [3+2] triazene&#8208;alkene cycloaddition reactions of an array of unactivated alkenes with CF3CHN2. This approach features good functional group tolerance and mild reaction conditions. Synthetic utility of the procedure is elucidated by structure diversification of known pharmaceuticals, natural products, and bioactive molecules.







Abstract
A novel approach to chemoselective synthesis of biologically important CF3&#8208;subsituted pyrazolines was developed via a Lewis base catalyzed intermolecular triazene cycloaddition reaction of an array of terminal/internal alkenes with CF3CHN2. This strategy features a catalytic amount of 1,8&#8208;diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec&#8208;7&#8208;ene, high yields (up to 95&#8201;%), wide substrate scope and excellent functional group tolerance (54 examples). Importantly, we preformed scaffold diversification of a panel of known pharmaceuticals, natural products, and bioactive heterocycles to generate the corresponding pyrazoline derivatives with potential broad bioactivities for further development.

&lt;p&gt;A novel approach to chemoselective synthesis of biologically important CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-subsituted pyrazolines was developed via a Lewis base catalyzed intermolecular triazene cycloaddition reaction of an array of terminal/internal alkenes with CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CHN&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. This strategy features a catalytic amount of 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene, high yields (up to 95&#8201;%), wide substrate scope and excellent functional group tolerance (54 examples). Importantly, we preformed scaffold diversification of a panel of known pharmaceuticals, natural products, and bioactive heterocycles to generate the corresponding pyrazoline derivatives with potential broad bioactivities for further development.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Lanthanide Functionalized Covalent Organic Frameworks Hybrid Materials for Luminescence Responsive Chemical Sensing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) possess several unique features of structural and functional chemistry, together with other modular optical performance, which make them candidates for luminescence responsive chemical sensing. Lanthanide functionalized COFs hybrid materials still keep the parent COFs&#8217; virtues and also embody the abundant multiple luminescence response with cooperative emission with energy transfer and discrete one without energy transfer. In this review, the summary is highlighted on the lanthanide functionalized COFs hybrid materials and the relevant systems for luminescence responsive chemical sensing. It is subdivided into five sections involving the three main topics. Firstly, the basic knowledges of COFs materials related to the luminescence responsive chemical sensing are introduced (including three sections), involving the chemistry, application and post&#8208;synthetic modification (PSM) of COFs, the luminescence and luminescence responsive chemical sensing, and the luminescence responsive chemical sensing of non&#8208;lanthanide functionalized COFs hybrids materials. Secondly, the systematic progresses are outlined on the lanthanide functionalized COFs hybrid materials in luminescence responsive chemical sensing. Finally, the conclusion and prospect are given. It needs to refer that the pure COFs and non&#8208;lanthanide functionalized COFs hybrids are not the main topic for this review and only simply mentioned for the general knowledge.</dc:description>

         <title>Unexpected coexisting solid solutions in the quasi&#8208;binary&#160;Ag(II)F2/Cu(II)F2 phase diagram</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>High&#8208;temperature solid&#8208;state reaction between orthorhombic AgF2 and monoclinic CuF2 (y = 0.15, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5) in a fluorine atmosphere resulted in coexisting solid solutions of Cu&#8208;poor orthorhombic and Cu&#8208;rich monoclinic phases with stoichiometry Ag1&#8208;xCuxF2. Based on X&#8208;ray powder diffraction analyses, the mutual solubility in the orthorhombic phase (AgF2:Cu) appears to be at an upper limit of Cu concentration of 30 mol % (Ag0.7Cu0.3F2), while the monoclinic phase (CuF2:Ag) can form a nearly stoichiometric Cu: Ag = 1: 1 solid solution (Cu0.56Ag0.44F2), preserving the CuF2 crystal structure. Experimental data and DFT calculations showed that AgF2:Cu and CuF2:Ag solid solutions deviate from the classical Vegard&#8217;s law. Magnetic measurements of Ag1&#8208;xCuxF2 showed that the N&#233;el temperature (TN) decreases with increasing Cu content in both phases. Likewise, theoretical DFT+U calculations for Ag1&#8208;xCuxF2 showed that the progressive substitution of Ag by Cu decreases the magnetic interaction strength |J2D| in both structures. Electrical conductivity measurements of Ag0.85Cu0.15F2 showed a ca. 2&#8208;fold increase in specific ionic conductivity (3.71&#183;10&#8208;13 &#177; 2.6&#183;10&#8208;15 S/cm) as compared to pure AgF2 (1.85&#183;10&#8208;13 &#177; 1.2&#183;10&#8208;15 S/cm), indicating the formation of a vacancy&#8208; or F adatom&#8208;free metal difluoride sample.</dc:description>

         <title>Photochemical Aminochlorination of Alkenes Without the Use of an External Catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The niche field of Photochemistry offers opportunities that are not found in &#8220;traditional&#8221; ground state chemical pathways. Aminochlorinated derivatives is an interesting family of 1,2&#8208;difunctionalised compounds that provide access to a variety of natural products and pharmaceutical active substances. A practical, catalyst&#8208;free chloroamination protocol is described herein, providing access to intermediates of great importance, utilising mild and photochemical reaction conditions (370 nm), where N&#8208;chlorosulfonamides are used as both nitrogen and chlorine sources. A wide variety of olefins, decorated with a plethora of functional groups, were tested providing excellent results (28 examples, 18&#8208;88% yield). Mechanistic studies (UV&#8208;Vis, control experiments and quantum yield measurement) were also performed.</dc:description>

         <title>The Role of the Amino Acid Molecular Characteristics on the Formation of Fluorescent Gold&#8208; and Silver&#8208;Based Nanoclusters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Role of amino acids like L&#8208;phenylalanine (Phe), L&#8208;glutamine (Gln) and L&#8208;arginine (Arg) is described and interpreted in terms of their potential for preparation of fluorescent molecular&#8208;like gold and silver nanostructures. We are among the first to demonstrate the effect of syntheses conditions as well as the molecular characteristics of Phe, Gln and Arg amino acids on the structure of the formed products. Comprehensive optical characterizations (lifetime, quantum yield (QY%)) of the blue&#8208;emitting products were also carried out. It was confirmed that for all Au&#8208;containing samples and for Gln&#8208;Ag system the characteristic fluorescence originates from few&#8208;atomic metallic nanoclusters (NCs) where the reduction of metal ions was promoted by citrate in some cases. Relatively high QY% (~ 18%) was obtained for Arg&#8208;stabilized Au NCs due to the existence of an electrostatic interaction between the electron rich, positively charged guanidium side chain of Arg and the negatively charged carboxylate group of citrate on the metallic surface. Size and structural analysis of the products were evaluated by infrared measurements and dynamic light scattering techniques.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Structure&#8211;Activity Relationship Studies of C(13)&#8208;Desmethylene&#8208;(&#8722;)&#8208;Zampanolide Analogs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The sponge&#8208;derived, highly unsaturated marine macrolide (&#8722;)&#8208;zampanolide is a potent antimitotic agent and cancer cell growth inhibitor. By using a convergent synthetic approach, the shown series of partially reduced and/or demethylated analogs were obtained. Depending on the site of modification, these compounds show a range of microtubule&#8208;binding affinities and cellular activities, thus providing new insights into the relative importance of specific double bonds and methyl groups for biological activity. More information can be found in the Research Article by K.&#8208;H. Altmann and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202300703).

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The sponge-derived, highly unsaturated marine macrolide&lt;/b&gt; (&#8722;)-zampanolide is a potent antimitotic agent and cancer cell growth inhibitor. By using a convergent synthetic approach, the shown series of partially reduced and/or demethylated analogs were obtained. Depending on the site of modification, these compounds show a range of microtubule-binding affinities and cellular activities, thus providing new insights into the relative importance of specific double bonds and methyl groups for biological activity.

         <title>Antitumor Activity and Reductive Stress by Platinum(II) N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes based on Guanosine
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Platinum(II) complexes bearing NHCs based on guanosine undergo a substantial increase in antiproliferative activity when changing the ligand trans to the NHC from bromide to hydride. Compound 6 leads to an increase in reductive stress and increase in glutathione levels in cancer cells but not in non&#8208;cancer cells.







Abstract
Platinum(II) complexes bearing N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes based guanosine and caffeine have been synthesized by unassisted C&#8722;H oxidative addition, leading to the corresponding trans&#8208;hydride complexes. Platinum guanosine derivatives bearing triflate as counterion or bromide instead of hydride as co&#8208;ligand were also synthesized to facilitate correlation between structure and activity. The hydride compounds show high antiproliferative activity against all cell lines (TC&#8208;71, MV&#8208;4&#8208;11, U&#8208;937 and A&#8208;172). Methyl Guanosine complex 3, bearing a hydride ligand, is up to 30&#8197;times more active than compound 4, with a bromide in the same position. Changing the counterion has no significant effect in antiproliferative activity. Increasing bulkiness at N7, with an isopropyl group (compound 6), allows to maintain the antiproliferative activity while decreasing toxicity for non&#8208;cancer cells. Compound 6 leads to an increase in endoplasmic reticulum and autophagy markers on TC71 and MV&#8208;4&#8208;11 cancer cells, induces reductive stress and increases glutathione levels in cancer cells but not in non&#8208;cancer cell line HEK&#8208;293.

         <title>Trinuclear PdII Complexes with a C3&#8208;Symmetric Triethynylbenzene&#8208;Based Tris&#8208;NHC Ligand: Catalytic Benefits</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalytic benefits: Trinuclear PdII complexes with an extended C3&#8208;symmetric triethynylbenzene&#8208;based tris&#8208;NHC ligand are presented. Catalytic studies indicate an enhanced activity of the trinuclear PdII complex in comparison to the corresponding mononuclear PdII complex. An electronic effect in the trinuclear ligand platform is likely to be responsible for the better catalytic activity of the trinuclear complexes over mononuclear complexes.







Abstract
A new C3&#8208;symmetric tris&#8208;imidazolium tribromide salt 3, featuring 1,3,5&#8208;substituted triethynylbenzene, was used for the preparation of a trinuclear PdII pyridine&#8208;enhanced precatalyst preparation stabilization and initiation&#8208;type (PEPPSI) complex by triple C2 deprotonation followed by the addition of PdCl2. Trinuclear PdII complex possessing a combination of NHC and PPh3 ligands has also been synthesized. The corresponding mononuclear palladium(II) complexes have also been synthesized for the comparison purpose. All these complexes have been characterized by using NMR spectroscopy and ESI mass spectrometry. The molecular structure of the trinuclear palladium(II) complex bearing mixed carbene and pyridine donor ligands has been established by using single crystal XRD. All the palladium(II) complexes have been used as pre&#8208;catalysts, which gave good to excellent yields in intermolecular &#945;&#8208;arylation of 1&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxindole and Sonogashira coupling reaction. Catalytic studies indicate an enhanced activity of the trinuclear PdII complex in comparison to the corresponding mononuclear PdII complex for both catalytic transformations. The better performance of the trinuclear complex has also been further supported by preliminary electrochemical measurements. A negative mercury poison test was observed for both the aforementioned catalyses and therefore, it is likely that these organic transformations proceed homogeneously.

         <title>Phosphate&#8208;functionalized Zirconium Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Enhancing Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Battery Cycling</title>

Functional framework: A phosphate&#8208;functionalized metal&#8211;organic framework improves charge transport and enhances sulfur utilization as sulfur cathode additive for lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries.







Abstract
Lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries are promising candidates for next&#8208;generation energy storage devices due to their outstanding theoretical energy density. However, they suffer from low sulfur utilization and poor cyclability, greatly limiting their practical implementation. Herein, we adopted a phosphate&#8208;functionalized zirconium metal&#8211;organic framework (Zr&#8208;MOF) as a sulfur host. With their porous structure, remarkable electrochemical stability, and synthetic versatility, Zr&#8208;MOFs present great potential in preventing soluble polysulfides from leaching. Phosphate groups were introduced to the framework post&#8208;synthetically since they have shown a strong affinity towards lithium polysulfides and an ability to facilitate Li ion transport. The successful incorporation of phosphate in MOF&#8208;808 was demonstrated by a series of techniques including infrared spectroscopy, solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and X&#8208;ray pair distribution function analysis. When employed in batteries, phosphate&#8208;functionalized Zr&#8208;MOF (MOF&#8208;808&#8208;PO4) exhibits significantly enhanced sulfur utilization and ion diffusion compared to the parent framework, leading to higher capacity and rate capability. The improved capacity retention and inhibited self&#8208;discharge rate also demonstrate effective polysulfide encapsulation utilizing MOF&#8208;808&#8208;PO4. Furthermore, we explored their potential towards high&#8208;density batteries by examining the cycling performance at various sulfur loadings. Our approach to correlate structure with function using hybrid inorganic&#8211;organic materials offers new chemical design strategies for advancing battery materials.

Pt(II)&#8722;NHC complexes are used in alkene hydrosilylation reactions. Some of the examined compounds display excellent catalytic activity, outperforming Pt(0)&#8722;NHC pre&#8208;catalysts. Our study explores the catalyst structure&#8208;activity relationship and provides new mechanistic insights into this industrially important transformation. A sustainable protocol, featuring efficient platinum removal, allows us to access a series of organosilanes in very good to excellent yields.







Abstract
Herein, we report the catalytic activity of a series of platinum(II) pre&#8208;catalysts, bearing N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands, in the alkene hydrosilylation reaction. Their structural and electronic properties are fully investigated using X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR). Next, our study presents a structure&#8208;activity relationship within this group of pre&#8208;catalysts and gives mechanistic insights into the catalyst activation step. An exceptional catalytic performance of one of the complexes is observed, reaching a turnover number (TON) of 970 000 and a turnover frequency (TOF) of 40 417&#8197;h&#8722;1 at 1&#8197;ppm catalyst loading. Finally, an attractive solvent&#8208;free and open&#8208;to&#8208;air alkene hydrosilylation protocol, featuring efficient platinum removal (reduction of residual Pt from 582&#8197;ppm to 5.8&#8197;ppm), is disclosed.

         <title>Etheno&#8208;bridged Azaacene Spiro Dimers</title>

Merging the world of cis&#8208;stilbenes and azaacenes: The synthesis of spiro&#8208;linked azaacene dimers conjugated via a secondary etheno&#8208;bridge is reported &#8211; introducing a conformationally locked cis&#8208;stilbene core fragment. Conjugation decreases the optical gap of the presented dimers and broadens absorption, albeit opens a new decomposition pathway.







Abstract
We present the synthesis of two sets of spiro&#8208;connected azaacene dimers. Their geometry and electronic coupling are critically determined by a secondary linker, i.&#8201;e., an etheno&#8208; and an ethano&#8208;bridge. The core fragment of the etheno&#8208;bridged dimer corresponds to a conformationally locked cis&#8208;stilbene. Optoelectronic properties, single crystal X&#8208;ray structures and stability with respect to oxidation of the conjugated and non&#8208;conjugated dimers are reported and compared. The conjugated dimers exhibit smaller optical gaps and bathochromically shifted absorption maxima, but are prone to unexpected oxygen addition, dearomatizing one of the azaacene substituents.

         <title>Y&#8208;Shaped D&#8208;A Type Thioxanthone Derivatives: Mechano&#8208;Induced Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence and High&#8208;Contrast Mechano&#8208;Responsive Luminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Y&#8208;shaped D&#8208;A type molecules possessed two independent ICT states inside, resulted from the two independent D&#8722;A conjugation from their small donor arms to the acceptor. As their two D&#8722;A torsion angles are very sensitive to aggregated states, they showed interesting mechano&#8208;induced TADF and high&#8208;contrast MRL properties.







Abstract
High&#8208;contrast mechano&#8208;responsive luminescence (MRL) materials with mechano&#8208;induced emission enhancement properties are fascinating candidates but few, for applications in rewritable media and recording devices. Here, an interesting design strategy of &#8220;Y&#8208;shape&#8221; donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8722;A) type molecules for high&#8208;contrast MRL materials was presented, based on substituted diphenylamine donor and planar acceptor. Interestingly, their D&#8722;A torsion angles are small in crystals but increased after ground, resulted in planar and twist intramolecular charge transfer (PICT and TICT) states, respectively. Therefore, high&#8208;contrast MRL switching between weak blue (450&#8197;nm) fluorescence and bright yellow (552&#8197;nm) thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) can be achieved for compound TXDO (4,4&#8242;&#8208;dimethoxydiphenylamine donor), which photoluminescence quantum yield increased from 2.8&#8201;% to 54.7&#8201;% after ground. Most importantly, the two independent D&#8722;A conjugation dihedral angles are actually independent in the &#8220;Y&#8208;shape&#8221; molecules. Especially for compound TXDT (4,4&#8242;&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyldiphenylamine donor), its crystal exhibited both PICT and TICT processes inside, resulted from the different dihedral angles of 11.8&#176; and 35.5&#176;, respectively. The TXDT crystal thus showed dual&#8208;peak emission, including both TICT fluorescence and PICT room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence. Therefore, this strategy of &#8220;Y&#8208;shape&#8221; D&#8722;A type molecules provide a new approach to design advanced luminescent materials with mechano&#8208;induced TADF feature, for high&#8208;contrast MRL and single&#8208;component white luminescence.

         <title>Effects of Central Elements on the Properties of Group 13 Dialdiminate Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Group 13 elements diversify the luminescent behavior of dialdiminate complexes. Aluminium and gallium complexes exhibit Lewis base&#8208;responsive emission, and aluminium enhances the responsiveness. The indium system encompasses ligand&#8208;exchange reactions in solution states, thus enabling us to alter the luminescence behavior dynamically. We also demonstrate their solid&#8208;state emissive properties involving aggregation&#8208; and crystallization&#8208;induced emission enhancement. More information can be found in the Research Article by K. Tanaka and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202300654).

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The underlying features&lt;/b&gt; of the presented work is a newly devised strategic economical post-furnishing protocol, that is, air&#8211;liquid interfacial plasma (ALIP), on a covalently linked organic framework (COF) material for explicitly fine-tuning the surface properties and subsequently developing a new pathway towards boosted CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; capture. More information can be found in the Research Article by A. Kalita and co-workers (DOI: &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/chem.202300756"&gt;10.1002/chem.202300756&lt;/a&gt;).

         <title>Heterophenoquinones: Tuning Optoelectronics and Electrochromicity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pick any color of electrochrome: Sensors, photovoltaic cells, non&#8208;volatile memories, tintable glass etc.&#8212;all of these technologies include thiophene&#8208;based materials. They need to be tailor&#8208;made, and therefore customization and modularization is highly desirable. We have synthesized a kit of 16 thiophene&#8208;based heterophenoquinones, carefully investigated their optoelectronic properties and uncovered their structure&#8211;property relationships. The absorption of the heterophenoquinones covers the entire visible spectrum (structure and hexagons at the front). Upon reduction they change their color (structure and hexagons at the back), thus making them applicable in tintable glass. More information can be found in the Research Article by J. Freudenberg, U.&#8197;H.&#8197;F. Bunz and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202203862).

         <title>Near&#8208;Room&#8208;Temperature Synergetic Response of Magnetism, Dielectricity and Luminescence Based on (C5NH13Cl)2MnBr4</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Light, electricity, magnetism, and heat are manifestations of energy that are strongly interrelated and can be converted into each other under certain conditions. The molecular complex (C5NH13Cl)2MnBr4 shows a structural phase transition near room temperature that further induces the switchable magnetic properties, dielectric anomalies and fluorescent response over the same range of temperature. This is the first observation of the synergetic effect of magnetism, dielectricity and fluorescence near room temperature in a molecule, which well represents the strong interrelation between the light, electricity, magnetism, and heat. More information can be found in the Research Article by Y. Peng, Y. Song, Z.&#8208;B. Hu and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202300598).

         <title>Anion Effects on Spin Crossover Systems: From Supramolecular Chemistry to Magnetism</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The field of anion supramolecular chemistry has received more and more attention in recent years. Anions with diverse types and geometries have been widely used for the synthesis of ionic spin crossover (SCO) complexes. This review is devoted to anion effects on the molecular, supramolecular structures and magnetic properties of discrete SCO compounds. Firstly, typical anions used in the synthesis of these compounds are briefly summarized according to their various geometries. This is followed by a collection of representative examples of anion&#8208;based SCO compounds, whose SCO properties are analyzed in terms of supramolecular interactions, geometry and charge of anions. In the third part, anion effects on SCO complexes of different kinds of metal centers and ligands are outlined and finally remarks on the synthesis new type of ionic SCO complexes in the future are described.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report&#160;the first single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structure evidence of the potassium salt of the hexalacunary [&#945;&#8208;H2P2W12O48]12&#8722; (abbreviated as {P2W12})&#160;anion&#160;after its discovery by Contant and Ciabrini in 1977. In addition, we observed&#160;oligomerization of P2W12 into a {WO(OH2)}4+&#8208;bridged Pacman&#8208;shaped [{WO(OH2)}(&#945;&#8208;HP2W12O48)2]22&#8722; ({P4W25}) dimer and a cyclic [{WO(OH2)}3(P2W12O48)3]30&#8722; ({P6W39}) trimer. The three phosphotungstate anions were synthesized through recrystallization of (NH4)12[&#945;&#8208;H2P2W12O48] from slightly alkaline (HOCH2)3CNH2/KCl, CH3NH3Cl/KCl, and CH3NH3Cl/NH4Cl solutions. The structure of {P2W12} is derived from [&#945;&#8208;P2W18O62]6&#8722; that has six tungsten&#8212;one from each polar group and four from the belt&#8212;removed, and the center of the lacunary site is capped by a potassium cation. Structures of {P4W25} and {P6W39} are constructed by connecting two and three {P2W12} units with {WO(OH2)}4+, respectively. The isolation of the a pure {P6W39} phosphotungstate framework&#160;without coordination with transition metal cations is unprecedented. Powder X&#8208;ray diffraction confirmed the bulk purity of these compounds, indicating that selective crystallization was achieved through the selection of counter cations and pH.</dc:description>

         <title>The Bulk Breast Cancer Cell and Breast Cancer Stem Cell Activity of Bi&#8208;nuclear Copper(II)&#8208;Phenanthroline Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mono&#8208;nuclear copper(II)&#8208;phenanthroline complexes have been widely investigated as anticancer agents whereas multi&#8208;nuclear copper(II)&#8208;phenanthroline complexes are underexplored. Here we report the synthesis and characterisation of two new bi&#8208;nuclear copper(II)&#8208;phenanthroline complexes 1 and 2 comprising of 2,9&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1,10&#8208;phenanthroline or 2,9&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;4,7&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;1,10&#8208;phenanthroline, terminal chloride ligands, and bridging chloride or hydroxide ligands. The bi&#8208;nuclear copper(II) complex containing 2,9&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1,10&#8208;phenanthroline 1 displays nanomolar toxicity towards bulk breast cancer cells and breast cancer stem cells (CSCs) grown in monolayers, &gt;50&#8208;fold greater than cisplatin (an anticancer metallodrug) and salinomycin (a gold&#8208;standard anti&#8208;CSC agent). Spectacularly, 1 exhibits &gt;100&#8208;fold greater potency toward three&#8208;dimensionally cultured mammospheres than cisplatin and salinomycin. Mechanistic studies show that 1 evokes breast CSC apoptosis by elevating intracellular reactive oxygen species levels and damaging genomic DNA (possibly via an oxidative mechanism). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to probe the anti&#8208;breast CSC properties of bi&#8208;nuclear copper(II)&#8208;phenanthroline complexes.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here we describe the synthesis and characterization of a new uranyl peroxide cluster (UPC), U60Ox30*, which captures and stabilizes oxygen&#8208;based free radicals for more than one week. These radical species were first detected with a nitroblue tetrazolium colorimetric assay and U60Ox30* was characterized by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction as well as infrared (IR), Raman, UV&#8208;Vis&#8208;NIR, and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopies. Identification of the free radicals present in U60Ox30* was done via room temperature solid and solution state X&#8208;band EPR studies using spin trapping methods. The spin trapping agent 5,5&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1&#8208;pyrroline N&#8208;oxide (DMPO) was definitive for identifying the free radicals in U60Ox30*, which are hydroxyl radicals (&#8226;OH) that are stable for up to ten days that also persist upon addition of the metalloenzymes catalase and superoxide dismutase. Addition of the spin trapping agent &#945;&#8208;(4&#8208;pyridyl N&#8208;oxide)&#8208;N&#8208;tert&#8208;butylnitrone (POBN) further confirmed the radicals were oxygen based, and deuteration experiments showed that the origin of the free radicals was from the decomposition of H2O2 in water. These results demonstrate that highly oxidizing species such as the &#8226;OH radical can be stabilized in UPCs, which alters our understanding of the role of free radicals present in spent nuclear fuel.</dc:description>

         <title>Oxidative NHC Catalysis: An Unconventional Tool for Macrocyclic Oligoesters Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The application of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalysis under highly diluted oxidative condition to the polycondensation of dialdehydes and diols is herein presented as an alternative, atomeconomical synthetic route to macrocyclic oligoesters (MCOs). The disclosed protocol paves the way to the straightforward access to MCOs, starting from commercial dialdehydes, avoiding the use of toxic diacyl chlorides, commonly employed in traditional MCOs synthetic processes. The method is totally metal&#8208;free, takes place in the green Me&#8208;THF solvent and requires the use of a fully recyclable quinone oxidant. The protocol versatility is confirmed by the employment of fossil&#8208;based and bio&#8208;based monomers such as 2,5diformylfuran (DFF), 2,5&#8208;bis(hydroxymethyl)furan (BHMF), and isomannide, synthesizing a series of novel and known synthetically relevant macrocyclic oligoesters, fully characterized by NMR and MALDI&#8208;TOF MS analysis, with product yields (51&#8208;86%) comparable to those obtained by traditional synthetic routes. Finally, to emphasize the synthetic relevance of the target macrocycles, an entropicallydriven ring opening polymerization (ED&#8208;ROP) key study has been performed, optimizing the organocatalyzed synthesis of poly(2,5furan&#8208;dimethylene 2,5 furandicarboxylate) (PBHMF) with numberaverage molecular weight up to 8200 g mol&#8208;1 and 66% isolated yield.</dc:description>

         <title>Covalently modified MoS2 bearing a Hamilton&#8208;type receptor for recognizing a redox&#8208;active ferrocene&#8208;barbiturate guest via multiple H&#8208;bonds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The covalent modification of the metallic phase of MoS2 with a Hamilton&#8208;type ligand, transforming MoS2 to a recognition platform able to embrace barbiturate moieties via hydrogen bonding, is presented. The successful hydrogen bonding formation is easily monitored via simple electrochemical assessments, when a ferrocene&#8208;labeled barbiturate analogue is utilized as a proof of concept. Full spectroscopic, thermal and electron microscopy imaging characterization is provided for the newly formed recognition system, along with valuable insights concerning the electrochemical sensing. The methodology given expands beyond the sensing applications, confidently entering the territory of supramolecular interactions on the surface of 2D transition metal dichalcogenides. The well&#8208;designed host&#8208;guest chemistry, presented herein, constitutes a guide and an inspiration to hosting customized&#8208;structured functional building blocks on MoS2 and its relatives via hydrogen bonding, opening new avenues on its potential applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Kinetic Analysis of the Photochemical Paths in Asymmetric Diarylethene Dimer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An asymmetric diarylethene dimer composed of 2&#8208; and 3&#8208;thienylethene units linked by m&#8208;phenylene developed various colors upon UV irradiation via an independent photochromic reaction on each unit. The change in contents and the other photoresponses of the photogenerated four isomers were analyzed using quantum yield for all the possible photochemical paths, i.e., photoisomerization, fluorescence, energy transfer, and the other non&#8208;radiative paths. Almost all the rate constants of photochemical paths were calculated using measurable quantum yields and lifetimes. It was found that a significant contribution on photoresponse was the competition between photoisomerization and intramolecular energy transfer. The clear difference was observed in the photoresponses of the dimer and the 1:1 mixture solution of the model compounds. The m&#8208;phenylene spacer appropriately regulated the rate of energy transfer in the asymmetric dimer, and the spacer enabled isolation of the excited state of the dimer, making the above quantitative analysis possible.</dc:description>

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Directed H2S Probe and Scavenger for Specific Tumor Imaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An expanding body of evidence suggests that specifically targeting hydrogen sulfide (H2S) may potentially benefit both tumor diagnosis and treatment, but there is still a lack of cancer&#8208;targeted molecular tools for in vivo applications. Here, we report the first ligand&#8208;directed H2S&#8208;specific near&#8208;infrared fluorescent sensor PSMA&#8208;Cy7&#8208;NBD and scavenger PSMA&#8208;Py&#8208;NBD, targeting the prostate&#8208;specific membrane antigen (PSMA). PSMA&#8208;Cy7&#8208;NBD displays a 53&#8208;fold off&#8208;on fluorescence response to H2S at 803 nm with high specificity. PSMA&#8208;Py&#8208;NBD can scavenge H2S fast (k2 = 30.8 M&#8208;1s&#8208;1 at 25 oC) without interference from biothiols. Both tools are highly water&#8208;soluble and can be transported into PSMA&#8208;expressing prostate cancer cells selectively. Endogenous H2S levels in murine 22Rv1 tumor models can be imaged and down&#8208;regulated by intravenous injection of PSMA&#8208;Cy7&#8208;NBD and PSMA&#8208;Py&#8208;NBD, respectively. These tools may potentially help investigate H2S cancer biology and related therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Picolinaldehyde&#8208;Zinc(II)&#8208;Palladium(0) Catalytic System for the Asymmetric &#945;&#8208;Allylation of N&#8208;unprotected Amino Esters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reported in this work is a synergistic ternary achiral picolinaldehyde&#8208;Zn(II)&#8208;chiral palladium complex system for the highly enantioselective &#945;&#8208;allylation of N&#8208;unprotected amino esters. By utilizing a variety of allylic carbonates or vinyl benzoxazinanones as substrates, &#945;&#8208;allyl &#945;&#8208;amino esters were obtained in high yields (up to 96%) with high enantioselectivities (up to 98% ee). Control experiments suggest that the coordination of Zn(II) with the Schiff base intermediate enhances the acidity of the &#945;&#8208;C&#8208;H bonds of amino esters, thereby favoring &#945;&#8208;allylation over intrinsic N&#8208;allylation. Furthermore, NMR studies reveal an interaction between the chiral palladium complex and the Zn(II)&#8208;Schiff base intermediate, leading to the formation of a picolinaldehyde&#8208;Zn(II)&#8208;Pd(0) catalytic system.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogen Bonding Parameters by Rapid Colorimetric Assessment: Evaluation of Structural Components Found in Biological Ligands and Organocatalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high throughput UV&#8208;Vis method to measure hydrogen bonding capacity is disclosed using over 100 compounds of biological and catalytic relevance. A multiple linear regression model enables estimation of hydrogen bonding affinity from a single measurement using &#8764;2&#8197;mg of analyte that was showcased with a set of carboxylic acid bioisosteres.







Abstract
Hydrogen bonding is a key molecular interaction in biological processes, drug delivery, and catalysis. This report describes a high throughput UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopic method to measure hydrogen bonding capacity using a pyrazinone sensor. This colormetric sensor reversibly binds to a hydrogen bond donor, resulting in a blue shift as additional equivalents of donor are added. Titration with excess equivalents of donor is used to determine the binding coefficient, ln(Keq). Over 100 titrations were performed for a variety of biologically relevant compounds. This data enabled development a multiple linear regression model that is capable of predicting 95&#8201;% of ln(Keq) values within 1 unit, allowing for the estimation of hydrogen bonding affinity from a single measurement. To show the effectiveness of the single point measurements, hydrogen bond strengths were obtained for a set of carboxylic acid bioisosteres. The values from the single point measurements were validated with full titrations.

         <title>Late&#8208;Stage Functionalization for the Divergent Synthesis of Podophyllotoxin Derivatives by Rhodium Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Divergent synthesis of novel podophyllotoxin derivatives from available starting materials by late&#8208;stage functionalization strategy by rhodium catalysis is described. Exquisite selectivity for podophyllotoxin functionalization was demonstrated through arylation, alkenylation and cyclization at C5 position.







Abstract
A divergent synthesis of podophyllotoxin derivatives from simple and readily available starting materials through a late&#8208;stage functionalization strategy by rhodium catalysis is reported here. This strategy uses the ketone and oxime in substrates as directing groups. Four kinds of novel podophyllotoxin derivatives have been obtained without any erosion of the enantiopurity, thus indicating the broad substrate scope of this method. Additionally, by using the newly developed strategy, 9&#8201;aa, which exhibited excellent anticancer activity, can be prepared by a sequential transformation. In particularly, 9&#8201;aa suppressed HeLa cells with IC50 values of 74.5&#8197;nM, thus providing a promising lead compound for future drug discovery.

Two is better than one: Diimidazolium salt HBDIM 1, a precursor for di&#8208;NHCs ligand CageCarbene, from cheap and easily available agent hexabenzylhexaazaisowurtzitane (HBIW) was developed. Studies showed that the steric hinderance of CageCarbene is similar to that of SIMes but smaller than that of IPr, and electronically, CageCarbene is a strong &#963;&#8208;donator similar to SIMs and a stronger &#963;&#8208;donator than IPr. Bimetallic complexes 2&#8211;4 of Au, Cu or Pd bearing CageCarbene were synthesized and fully characterized, including X&#8208;ray diffraction of their single crystals. Further studies showed that complexes 2&#8211;4 were highly reactive to catalyze up to 17 reactions.







Abstract
The preparation of diimidazolium salt HBDIM 1, a precursor for a di&#8208;NHCs ligand, from cheap and easily available agent hexabenzylhexaazaisowurtzitane (HBIW) is reported. Under basic conditions, HBDIM undergoes facile deprotonation to in&#8197;situ generate CageCarbene, which could efficiently coordinate to transition&#8208;metals, such as, Au, Cu or Pd, to give the corresponding bimetallic complexes 2&#8211;4. These complexes were isolated and fully characterized, including X&#8208;ray diffraction of their single crystals. It was found that the steric hinderance of CageCarbene is similar to that of SIMes but smaller than that of IPr, and electronically, CageCarbene is a strong &#963;&#8208;donator similar to SIMes and a stronger &#963;&#8208;donator than IPr. Further studies showed that complexes 2&#8211;4 were highly reactive to catalyze up to 17 reactions. Control experiments utilizing a N&#8208;benzyl&#8208;substituted monoimidazolium salt showed much lower catalytic reactivity when it was bound to Au or Cu, but exhibited similar reactivity for the Pd complex. Kinetic studies showed that the low reactivity of the monodentate carbene&#8208;ligated Au or Cu complex was due to the low stability of the complex under the reaction conditions.

         <title>Dinuclear Iron(II) Triple Helicates Exhibiting Room Temperature Spin&#8208;Transition Behaviour in Solid and Solution Phase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three iron(II) dinuclear helicates exhibit incomplete, multistep and single&#8208;step spin transition behaviour close to room temperature in solid, as well as in solution phases. Complexes possess the different crystallographic space groups, which results in different crystallographic packing of the complexes. This, in turn, affects the cooperativity throughout the Fe centre of the crystal lattice, which plays a major role in such spin&#8208;state transition.







Abstract
Herein, three dinuclear iron(II) helicates bearing the molecular formula [Fe2(L1)3](ClO4)4&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2CH3OH&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;3H2O (complex 1), [Fe2(L2)3](ClO4)4&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;6CH3CN (complex 2), and [Fe2(L3)3](ClO4)4&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;0.5H2O (complex 3) have been synthesized using imidazole and pyridine&#8208;imine&#8208;based ligands having fluorene moiety in the backbone. A change in the ligand field strength by terminal modulation led to a change in the spin&#8208;transition behaviour from incomplete, multi&#8208;step to complete, around room temperature in the solid state. Spin transition behaviour has also been observed in the solution phase characterized using variable temperature 1H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (Evans method) and correlated using UV&#8208;visible spectroscopy. Fitting the NMR data using the ideal solution model yielded the transition temperature in the order T1/2 (1)&lt;T1/2 (2)&lt;T1/2 (3), which indicates an increase in the ligand field strength from complexes 1 to 3. This study accentuates the interplay between the ligand field strength, crystal packing, and supramolecular interactions in fine&#8208;tuning the spin transition behaviour effectively.

Fitting the NMR data using the ideal solution model yielded the transition temperature in the order T&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;)&amp;lt;T&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;)&amp;lt;T&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;), which indicates an increase in the ligand field strength from complexes &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; to &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;. This study accentuates the interplay between the ligand field strength, crystal packing, and supramolecular interactions in fine-tuning the spin transition behaviour effectively.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Symmetrically Functionalized Copper and Silver Corrole&#8208;Bis&#8208;Tetracyanobutadiene Push&#8208;Pull Conjugates: Efficient Population of Triplet States via Charge Transfer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Copper and silver corroles, symmetrically functionalized with two TCBDs, have been newly synthesized as wideband capturing push&#8208;pull systems. An efficient population of triplet states via the intermediate charge transfer state formed as a function of excitation wavelength is demonstrated using ultrafast pump&#8208;probe spectroscopy.







Abstract
Copper and silver tritolylcorroles (TTC) are symmetrically functionalized to carry two tetracyanobutadiene (TCBD) entities via [2+2] cycloaddition&#8208;retroeletrocyclization reaction involving ethynyl functionalized corroles with an electron acceptor, tetracyanoethylene (TCNE) in excellent yields, as the first examples of corrole&#8208;TCBD push&#8208;pull systems. The strong push&#8208;pull effect resulted in charge polarization in the ground state resulting in a considerable hypsochromic shift of the spectrum extending it into the near&#8208;IR region. Electrochemical studies coupled with computational studies revealed considerable interactions between the two TCBD entities via the corrole &#960;&#8208;system and the degree of such interactions was found to depend on the metal ion present in the corrole cavity. Energy considerations suggested charge transfer (CT) from the S2 or vibrationally hot S1 state but not the relaxed S1 state in the case of CuTTC(TCBD)2 while CT to occur from all these states in the case of AgTTC(TCBD)2. Additionally, the high&#8208;energy CT states populate the low&#8208;lying triplet states. Systematic femtosecond pump&#8208;probe studies provided the ultimate proof for the occurrence of excited CT as a function of excitation wavelength followed by the efficient population of the triplet states. The present study brings out the significance of charge transfer in efficiently populating the triplet states in rather unusual copper and silver corroles carrying two TCBD entities.

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Hydrosilylation of Alkenes with Acylhydrosilanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel method to access synthetically valuable acylsilanes from alkenes through Rh&#8208;catalyzed alkene hydrosilylation with acylhydrosilanes is reported. Acylhydrosilanes represent a novel class of acylsilanes and a great variety of acylsilanes can be accessed via this approach. Reactions occur in good to excellent yields under mild conditions and show high functional group tolerance as well as high atom economy.







Abstract
Acylsilanes are an important class of organosilicon compounds that have gained increased attention recently. Their various reaction modes in particularly their ability to generate carbenes under thermal or photochemical conditions render them valuable reagents in organic synthesis. In this communication, an unprecedented route towards acylsilanes is reported by introducing the acylsilane moiety directly in a single step through alkene hydrosilylation. In this context, acylhydrosilanes representing a novel class of acylsilanes are introduced and applied as silylation reagents in rhodium catalyzed alkene hydrosilylations to access a great variety of acylsilanes. These reactions occur in good to excellent yields under mild conditions and show high functional group tolerance and atom economy.

         <title>Structure&#8208;Property Relationships in a New Family of Photoactive Diimine&#8208;Diphosphine Copper(I) Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel heteroleptic copper(I) complexes based on the tetraazaphenanthrene ligand were synthesized and extensively studied. The correlation of the properties to the substitution of the diimine ligand and their impact on the photoreactivity of complexes in the presence of N,N&#8217;&#8208;diisopropylethylamine are rationalized, overall providing useful structure&#8208;property relationships for copper complexes as photoredox catalysts.







Abstract
A new family of heteroleptic diimine&#8208;diphosphine copper(I) complexes is reported, with six new complexes compared to benchmark [Cu(bcp)(DPEPhos)]PF6. These new complexes are based on 1,4,5,8&#8208;tetraazaphenanthrene (TAP) ligands with representative electronic properties as well as substitution patterns and DPEPhos and XantPhos as diphosphine ligands. Their photophysical and electrochemical properties were investigated and correlated with the number and position of substituents on the TAP ligands. Stern&#8208;Volmer studies using H&#252;nig's base as reductive quencher demonstrated the influence of the complex photoreduction potential and of the excited state lifetime on the photoreactivity. This study refines the structure&#8208;property relationship profile for heteroleptic copper(I) complexes and confirms that such profiles are of high interest to design new copper complexes as optimized photoredox catalysts.

         <title>Selective Hydroxylation of C(sp3)&#8211;H Bonds in Steroids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Steroids are highly prevalent structures in small molecule therapeutics, with the level of oxidation being key to their biological activity and physicochemical properties. These C(sp3)&#8208;rich tetracycles contain many stereocentres, which are important for creating specific vectors and protein binding orientations. Therefore, the ability to hydroxylate steroids with a high degree of regio&#8208;, chemo&#8208; and stereoselectivity is essential for researchers working in this field. This review will cover three main methods for the hydroxylation of steroidal C(sp3)&#8211;H bonds: biocatalysis, metal&#8208;catalysed C&#8211;H hydroxylation, and organic oxidants, such as dioxiranes and oxaziridines.</dc:description>

         <title>Enzymatic Synthesis of l&#8208;Methionine Analogues and Application in a Methyltransferase Catalysed Alkylation Cascade</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemical modification of small molecules is a key step for the development of pharmaceuticals. S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;l&#8208;methionine (SAM) analogues are used by methyltransferases (MTs) to transfer alkyl, allyl and benzyl moieties chemo&#8208;, stereo&#8208; and regioselectively onto substrates, enabling an enzymatic way for specific derivatisation of a wide range of molecules. l&#8208;Methionine analogues are required for the synthesis of SAM analogues. Most of these are not commercially available. In nature, O&#8208;acetyl&#8208;l&#8208;homoserine sulfhydrolases (OAHS) catalyse the synthesis of l&#8208;methionine from O&#8208;acetyl&#8208;l&#8208;homoserine or l&#8208;homocysteine, and methyl mercaptan. Here, we investigated the substrate scope of ScOAHS from Saccharomyces cerevisiae for the production of l&#8208;methionine analogues from l&#8208;homocysteine and organic thiols. The promiscuous enzyme was used to synthesise nine different l&#8208;methionine analogues with modifications on the thioether residue up to a conversion of 75%. ScOAHS was combined with an established MT dependent three&#8208;enzyme alkylation cascade, allowing transfer of in total seven moieties onto two MT substrates. Ethylation was nearly doubled with the new four&#8208;enzyme cascade, indicating a beneficial effect of the in situ production of l&#8208;methionine analogues with ScOAHS.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalytic Cross&#8208;Pinacol Coupling Promoted by Carbon Dioxide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cross&#8208;pinacol coupling of two different carbonyl compounds was achieved through successive one&#8208;electron transfer processes under photocatalytic conditions. In the reaction, an umpoled anionic carbinol synthon was generated in situ to react nucleophilically with a second electrophilic carbonyl compound. We revealed that a CO2 additive promoted the photocatalytic generation of the carbinol synthon to suppress undesired radical dimerization. A wide variety of aromatic and aliphatic carbonyl substrates underwent the cross&#8208;pinacol coupling to afford the corresponding unsymmetric vicinal 1,2&#8208;diols, where even a combination of carbonyl reactants with similar structures such as two aldehydes and two ketones were also well tolerated with high cross&#8208;coupling selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Skeletal Editing of (Hetero)Arenes Using Carbenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>(Hetero)arenes continue to prove their indispensability in pharmaceutical engineering, materials science, and synthetic chemistry. As such, the controllable modification of biologically significant (hetero)arenes towards diverse more&#8208;potent complex molecular scaffolds through peripheral and skeletal editing has been considered a challenging goal in synthetic organic chemistry. Despite many excellent reviews that have discussed peripheral editing (i.e., C&#8211;H functionalization) of (hetero)arenes, their skeletal editing via single atom insertion, deletion, or transmutations has so far been less discussed. In this review, we tried to summarize and depict the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art skeletal editing reactions on heteroarenes using carbenes, with a focus on general mechanistic considerations and the potential application of this transformation for the synthesis of natural products. The potential opportunities and inherent challenges encountered while developing these strategies have also been highlighted.</dc:description>

         <title>Thin Layer Chromatography&#8208;Freeze Surface&#8208;Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy: A Powerful Tool for Monitoring Synthetic Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) is a promising tool used in combination with thin layer chromatography (TLC) to obtain direct molecular information on the spots. However, the stationary phase and impurities on nanoparticles used in SERS can negatively affect the efficacy of the TLC&#8208;SERS. The present study shows that freezing improves TLC&#8208;SERS efficiency, allowing for the identification of compounds with high sensitivity and the monitoring of synthetic reactions quantitatively.







Abstract
Thin layer chromatography (TLC) is widely used to confirm the formation of the target compound in chemical synthesis. The key issue in TLC is spot identification as it primarily relies on retention factors. Coupling of TLC with surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS), which gives direct molecular information, is an appropriate choice, to overcome this challenge. However, interference from the stationary phase and impurities on the nanoparticles added for SERS measurements significantly degrades TLC&#8208;SERS efficiency. It was found that freezing effectively eliminates such interferences and dramatically improves the performance of TLC&#8208;SERS. In this study, TLC&#8208;freeze SERS is applied to the monitoring of four chemically important reactions. The proposed method can identify the product and side&#8208;products of similar structures, detect compounds with high sensitivity, and provide information of quantities that allows the reliable determination of the reaction time based on kinetic analysis.

         <title>A 2&#8208;Anilidomethylpyridine Ligand Framework Showcasing Hydride Storage and Transfer Abilities in Its Aluminum Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 2&#8208;anilidomethylpyridine framework, a proven ancillary support, undergoes 1,4&#8208;hydroalumination by AlH3(NMe2Et) and models the hydride storage in Hantzsch esters and biological cofactors like NADH or NAD(P)H. DFT analyses suggest a &#8216;self&#8208;promoting&#8217; hydroalumination mechanism that underlines alane's acid&#8208;base duality. AlMe3 in contrast does not lead to such pyridyl dearomatization.







Abstract
Dearomatized 1,4&#8208;dihydropyridyl motifs are significant in both chemistry and biology for their potential abilities to deliver the stored hydride, driven by rearomatization. Biological cofactors like nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) and organic &#8216;hydride sources&#8217; like Hantzsch esters are prime examples. An organoaluminum chemistry on a 2&#8208;anilidomethylpyridine framework is reported, where such hydride storage and transfer abilities are displayed by the ligand's pyridyl unit. The pyridylmethylaniline proligand (NNLH) is simultaneously deprotonated and 1,4&#8208;hydroaluminated by AlH3(NMe2Et) to [(NNLde)AlH(NMe2Et)] (1; NNLde=hydride&#8208;inserted dearomatized version of NNL). A hydride abstraction by B(C6F5)3 rearomatizes the pyridyl moiety to give the cationic aluminum hydride [(NNL)AlH(NMe2Et)][HB(C6F5)3] (6). Notably, such chemical non&#8208;innocence is priorly unseen in this established ligand class. The hydroalumination mechanism is investigated by isolating the intermediate [(NNL)AlH2] (2) and by control experiments, and is also analyzed by DFT calculation. The results advocate an intriguing &#8216;self&#8208;promoting&#8217; pathway, which underlines alane's Lewis acid/Br&#248;nsted base duality. NMe2Et carrying the alane also plays a crucial role. In contrast, the chemistry between NNLH and AlMe3 is much different, giving only [(NNL)AlMe2] (4) from the adduct [(NNLH)AlMe3] (3) by deprotonation but not a subsequent pyridyl dearomatization in the presence or absence of NMe2Et. This divergence is also justified by DFT analyses.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A 2-anilidomethylpyridine framework&lt;/b&gt;, a proven ancillary support, undergoes 1,4-hydroalumination by AlH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(NMe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Et) and models the hydride storage in Hantzsch esters and biological cofactors like NADH or NAD(P)H. DFT analyses suggest a &#8216;self-promoting&#8217; hydroalumination mechanism that underlines alane's acid-base duality. AlMe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; in contrast does not lead to such pyridyl dearomatization.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dearomatized 1,4-dihydropyridyl motifs are significant in both chemistry and biology for their potential abilities to deliver the stored hydride, driven by rearomatization. Biological cofactors like nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) and organic &#8216;hydride sources&#8217; like Hantzsch esters are prime examples. An organoaluminum chemistry on a 2-anilidomethylpyridine framework is reported, where such hydride storage and transfer abilities are displayed by the ligand's pyridyl unit. The pyridylmethylaniline proligand (&lt;sup&gt;NN&lt;/sup&gt;L&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;) is simultaneously deprotonated and 1,4-hydroaluminated by AlH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(NMe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Et) to [(&lt;sup&gt;NN&lt;/sup&gt;L&lt;sup&gt;de&lt;/sup&gt;)AlH(NMe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Et)] (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;; &lt;sup&gt;NN&lt;/sup&gt;L&lt;sup&gt;de&lt;/sup&gt;=hydride-inserted dearomatized version of &lt;sup&gt;NN&lt;/sup&gt;L). A hydride abstraction by B(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; rearomatizes the pyridyl moiety to give the cationic aluminum hydride [(&lt;sup&gt;NN&lt;/sup&gt;L)AlH(NMe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Et)][HB(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;] (&lt;b&gt;6&lt;/b&gt;). Notably, such chemical non-innocence is priorly unseen in this established ligand class. The hydroalumination mechanism is investigated by isolating the intermediate [(&lt;sup&gt;NN&lt;/sup&gt;L)AlH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;) and by control experiments, and is also analyzed by DFT calculation.

A heterogeneous flow Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling has been carried out. A water or aqueous organic solution of aryl halides and arylboronic acids (left&#8208;hand side) was continuously injected into a flow column cartridge filled with convoluted polymeric Pd catalysts and stabilizing polymeric auxiliary materials (orange balls) along with sea sand (white balls). The products, which included liquid crystals, pharmaceutical compounds, and organic LED compounds, were eluted from the column (right&#8208;hand side).

         <title>Peptide Stapling with Boronate Esters&#8208; A Reversible Folding of (Artificial) Peptide Chain to &#945;&#8208;Helix</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Precisely designed peptide sequences decorated with phenylboronic acid derivative and sugar residues (fructonic or galacturonic acid) in appropriate positions show reversibly forming ester residue and switching between cyclic (closed, stapled) and linear (open, non&#8208;stapled) forms. The boronate ester stapling is stabilized in mild basic conditions and may be switched off by acidification leading to unfolded organization of the peptide chain.







Abstract
Stabilization of a peptide conformation via stapling strategy may be realized by the reversible or more often irreversible connection of side chains being in mutually appropriate geometry. An incorporation of phenylboronic acid and sugar residues (fructonic or galacturonic acid), attached to two lysine side chains via amide bonds and separated by 2, 3, or 6 other residues in the C&#8208;terminal fragment of RNase A introduces the intramolecular interaction stabilizing the &#945;&#8208;helical organization. The boronate ester stapling is stabilized in mild basic conditions and may be switched off by acidification leading to unfolded organization of the peptide chain. We investigated the possibility of using switchable stapling by mass spectrometry, NMR and UV&#8208;CD spectroscopies, and DFT calculations.

         <title>Amino&#8208;Ene Click Reaction of Electron&#8208;Deficient &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Molecules with Negative Activation Enthalpies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amino&#8208;ene click reaction of an electron&#8208;deficient &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecule with an amine that proceeds faster at lower temperatures in some solvents. The amino&#8208;ene click reaction would open up a new versatile platform for amino&#8208;functionalization of brittle or unstable &#960;&#8208;systems under mild conditions.







Abstract
An amino&#8208;ene click reaction is a type of aza&#8208;Michael addition reaction that is congruent with click chemistry in terms of its reaction efficiency and rate under mild conditions. The amino&#8208;ene click reaction is increasingly recognized as a prominent synthetic tool to form C&#8722;N bonds in the context of organic materials chemistry and polymer chemistry. Herein, an unconventional amino&#8208;ene click reaction with negative activation enthalpies, in which an electron&#8208;deficient &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecule, such as a naphthalenediimide, reacts with an amine faster at lower temperatures is reported. The detailed study of the reaction mechanism reveals that the amino&#8208;ene click reaction proceeds via a pre&#8208;equilibrium reaction, the key to which is the formation of a stable reaction intermediate due to the solvation and charge delocalization on the &#960;&#8208;core. By optimizing the reaction conditions, it was demonstrated that the amino&#8208;ene click reaction proceeded faster at 273&#8197;K than at 347&#8197;K, which was easily observed visually.

         <dc:description>
From substrates to products. Just as boats make crossing from one side of a river to the other possible, a suitable catalytic system allows access to difficult or unattainable transformations. An unprecedented reductive boration of amides is achieved through a triple iridium&#8211;photoredox&#8211;organocatalysis system, affording valuable &#945;&#8208;amino boron products.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of healable alicyclic poly(ether&#8208;b&#8208;amide) multiblock copolymers (PEBA&#8208;I539, PEBA&#8208;I875, and PEBA&#8208;I1212), consisting of an asymmetric diamine (IPDA) with substantial steric hindrance, were successfully synthesized, and PEBA&#8208;I1212 with record&#8208;high strength and toughness for self&#8208;healing polyamide&#8208;based elastomers exhibited great prospects as a protective coating and flexible substrate for soft electronics.







Abstract
Self&#8208;healing polyamide multiblock copolymer with robust mechanical properties is highly desired. Here, an alicyclic diamine monomer, isophoronediamine (IPDA), with asymmetric structure and substantial steric hindrance was incorporated into the backbone of poly(ether&#8208;b&#8208;amide) multiblock copolymer. Based on the phase&#8208;lock effect, the mechanical properties and segmental mobility of copolymers can be modulated on a large scale via adjusting the molecular weight of hard segments. An extraordinary tensile strength of 32.0&#8197;MPa and an excellent elongation at break of 1881&#8201;% were simultaneously achieved, which leaded to a record&#8208;high toughness of 328.9&#8197;MJ&#8201;m&#8722;3 for self&#8208;healable polyamide elastomers. The synergism between the dynamic H&#8208;bonding networks and the diffusion of polymer chains contributed to a balance between the mechanical performance and self&#8208;healing efficiency of copolymers. Due to the adjustable mechanical performance, rapid scratch self&#8208;healing ability and superior impact resistance, the resultant copolymers showed great potential in the fields of protective coatings and soft electronics.

         <title>Synthesis of Tetrahydro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;carbolines by a Manganese&#8208;Catalysed Oxidative Pictet&#8211;Spengler Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, an efficient and green procedure for the synthesis of tetrahydro&#8208;&#946;&#8208;carbolines via dehydrogenative coupling of alcohols with tryptamines is reported. The reaction was carried out under mild conditions in the presence of a catalytic amount of the iPrPNP&#8722;Mn catalyst and a weak base (Na2CO3). This method tolerated a variety of benzylic and aliphatic alcohol substrates with different functional groups and afforded diverse products in good to excellent isolated yields using tryptamines. Using this strategy, we successfully synthesised pharmaceutical molecules harman, harmaline, and harmine in a concise manner.

         <title>Disulphide Cross&#8208;Linked Ultrashort Peptide Hydrogelator for Water Remediation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unleashing the power of peptide hydrogels for environmental remediation: This is a tale of an ultrashort peptide hydrogel (azo&#8208;KC) and its efficiency for wastewater treatment. The hydrogel is the outcome of the cumulative efforts of covalent and noncovalent interactions providing unique features like thixotropy and insolubility in bulk water medium. Dye contamination from textile industries is a severe concern for water pollution, and this crosslinked 3D fibrous hydrogel has been implemented as a promising way to efficiently address such wastewater challenges. More information can be found in the Research Article by S. Ahmed, B. Pramanik and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202300312). Various elements in this picture were designed by Freepik.

         <title>Bis[1]benzothieno[1,4]thiaborins as a Platform for BODIPY Singlet Oxygen Photosensitizers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Singlet oxygen is generated by the BODIPY photosensitizer, whose X&#8208;ray structure is shown in the central part of the picture. The structures in the left and right corners of the doors are those of bis(benzothienylo)[1,4]thiaborins&#8212;basic building blocks of BODIPY. The sensitization process requires white light, which is symbolized by a light bulb. Triplet oxygen enters through the red door, where it is excited to the singlet state, and leaves through the blue door. More information can be found in the Research Article by P.&#8197;H. Marek&#8208;Urban, K. Durka, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202300680). Artwork by P.H.M.&#8208;U.

         <title>Caged Luciferase Inhibitor&#8208;Based Bioluminescence SwitchingStrategy Enables Efficient Detection of Serum APN Activity and the Identification of Its Roles in Metastasis of Non&#8208;Small Cell Lung Cancer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bioluminogenic probes emerged as powerful tools for imaging and analysis of various bioanalyses, but traditional approaches would be limited to the low sensitivity during determine the low activity of protease in clinical specimens. Herein, we proposed a caged luciferase inhibitor&#8208;based bioluminescence&#8208;switching strategy (CLIBS) by using a cleavable luciferase inhibitor to modulate the activity of luciferase reporter to amplify the detective signals, which led to the enhancement of detection sensitivity, and enabled the determination of circulating Aminopeptidase N (APN) activity in thousands of times diluted serum. By applying the CLIBS to serum samples in non&#8211;small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients from two clinical cohorts, we revealed that, for the first time, higher circulating APN activities but not its concentration, were associated with more NSCLC metastasis or higher metastasis stages by subsequent clinical analysis, and can serve as an independent factor for forecasting NSCLC patients&#8217;risk of metastasis.</dc:description>

         <title>Insight into the structural ambiguity of actinide(IV) oxalate sheet structures: a case for alternate coordination geometries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Plutonium(IV) oxalate hexahydrate (Pu(C2O4)2&#8729;6H2O; PuOx) is an important intermediate in the recovery of plutonium from used nuclear fuel. Its formation via precipitation is well studied, yet its crystal structure remains unknown. Instead, the crystal structure of PuOx is assumed to be isostructural with neptunium(IV) oxalate hexahydrate (Np(C2O4)&#173;2&#8729;6H2O; NpOx) and uranium(IV) oxalate hexahydrate (U(C2O4)&#173;2&#8729;6H2O; UOx) despite the high degree of unresolved disorder that exists when determining water positions in the crystal structures of the latter two compounds. Such assumptions regarding the isostructural behavior of the actinide elements have been used to predict the structure of PuOx for use in a wide range of studies. Herein, we report the first crystal structures for PuOx and Th(C2O4)2&#183;6H2O (ThOx). This data, along with new characterization of UOx and NpOx, has resulted in the full determination of the structures and resolution of the disorder around the water molecules. Specifically, we identify the coordination of two water molecules with each metal center, which necessitates a change in oxalate coordination mode from axial to equatorial that has not been reported in the literature. This work exemplifies&#160;the need to revisit previous assumptions regarding fundamental actinide chemistry, which are heavily relied upon within the current nuclear field.</dc:description>

         <title>Diverse Reactions of &#945;&#8208;Diimine&#8208;Ligated Mg(I)&#8211;Mg(I)&#8208;Bonded Compound with Carbodiimides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The &#945;&#8208;diimine&#8208;ligated dimagnesium(I) compound [K(thf)3]2[LMg&#8722;MgL] (1, L = [(2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3)NC(Me)]22&#8722;) displays diverse reactivities toward carbodiimides (RN=C=NR) with different R substituents. In the reaction of 1 with Me3SiNCNSiMe3, one of the easily leaving trimethylsilyl groups loses to yield the Me3SiNCN&#8722; moiety that either bridges two Mg(II) centers (2) or terminally coordinated (3). In contrast, with the similarly bulky tBuNCNtBu, the carbodiimide inserts into Mg&#8211;Mg bond with accompanying C&#8722;H activation of a ligand or solvent (products 4 and 5). In the case of dicyclohexyl or diisopropyl carbodiimide, reductive C&#8722;C coupling of two RNCNR molecules occurs to form the [C2(NR)4]2&#8722; diamido moiety that bridges two Mg centers, giving complexes [{K(dme)2}2LMg(&#956;&#8208;{C2(NR)4})MgL] (6, R = Cy; 7, R = iPr) and [L&#8226;&#8722;Mg(&#956;&#8208;{C2(NR)4})MgL&#8226;&#8722;] (8). Most interestingly, by reaction of 1 with Me3SiC&#8801;CSiMe3, the acetylide complex [K(dme)][LMg(C&#8801;CSiMe3)(dme)] (9) was prepared, which undergoes a rare &#8220;double insertion&#8221; with CyNCNCy to afford [K(solv)][K(dme)2LMg(NCy)2C&#8722;C&#8801;C&#8722;C(NCy)2MgL] (10) containing a diacetylide&#8208;coupled bis(amidinate) ligand that bridges two Mg atoms.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlling Swing Rates in Macrocyclic Molecular Mortise Hinges</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hinge motion is observed in macrocyclic, mortise&#8208;type molecular hinges using variable temperature NMR spectroscopy. The data is consistent with dynamic hinging from a folded&#8208;to&#8208;extended&#8208;to&#8208;folded enantiomeric states. Crystallographic and solution structures of the folded states are reported. Chemical shift predictions derived from crystallographic data corroborate fully revolute hinge motion. The rate of hinging is affected by steric congestion at the hinge axis.&#160; Macrocycles containing glycine, 1, hinge faster than those comprising aminoisobutyric acid, 2. The free energies of activation, &#916;G&#8225;, for 1 and 2 were determined to be 13.3&#160; &#177;&#160; 0.3 kcal/mol and 16.3 &#177; 0.3 kcal/mol, respectively. This barrier is largely independent of solvent across those surveyed (CD3OD, CD3CN, DMSO&#8208;d6, pyridine&#8208;d5, D2O). Experiment and computation predict energy barriers that are consistent with disruption of an intramolecular network of hydrogen bonds. DFT calculations reveal pathways for hinge motion.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydration rearrangement in the 4&#8208;aminobenzonitrile&#8211;(H2O)2 cluster induced by photoionization: The effect of solvent&#8208;solvent interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The interplay between solute&#8208;solvent and solvent&#8208;solvent interactions plays an essential role in solvation dynamics that has important effects on the mechanism and dynamics of chemical reactions in solution. In this study, the rearrangement of the hydration shell induced by photoionization of a solute molecule is probed in a state&#8208; and isomer&#8208;specific manner by resonant multiphoton ionization detected IR spectroscopy of the prototypical 4&#8208;aminobenzonitrile&#8211;(H2O)2 cluster produced in a molecular beam. IR spectra reveal that the water molecules form a cyclic solvent network around the CN group in the initial neutral state (S0). Different from the singly&#8208;hydrated cluster, in which either the CN or the NH2 group is hydrated, hydration of the NH2 group is not observed in the dihydrated cluster. IR spectra obtained after ionizing the solute molecule into the cation ground state (D0) exhibit features ascribed to both NH&#8208;bound and CN&#8208;bound isomers, indicating that water molecules migrate from the CN to the NH site upon ionization with a yield depending on the ionization excess energy. Analysis of the IR spectra as a function of the excess energy shows that migration produces two different NH2 solvated structures, namely (i) the most stable structure in which both N&#8208;H bonds are singly hydrated</dc:description>

         <title>Supramolecular Chirogenesis in a Sterically Hindered Porphyrin &#8211; a Critical Theoretical Analysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The determination of molecular stereochemistry and absolute configuration is an important part of modern chemistry, pharmacology, and biology. Electronic circular dichroism (ECD) spectroscopy is a wildly used tool for chirality assignment, especially with porphyrin macrocycles employed as reporter chromophores. However, the mechanisms of induced ECD in porphyrin complexes are yet to be comprehensively rationalized. In this work the ECD spectra of a sterically hindered hexacationic porphyrin with two camphorsulfonic acids in dichloromethane and chloroform were experimentally measured and computationally analyzed. The influence of geometric factors such as the position of chiral guest molecules, distortion of the porphyrin macrocycle, and orientation of aromatic and non&#8208;aromatic peripheral substituents, on the ECD spectra was theoretically studied. Various potential pitfalls, such as lack of significant conformations and accidental agreement of experimental and simulated spectra, are considered and discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Deuteration Degree&#8208;Controllable Methylation via a Cascade Assembly Strategy using Methylamine&#8208;Water as Methyl Source</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present a novel and effective photocatalytic method for the methylation of &#946;&#8208;diketones with controllable degrees of deuterium incorporation via development of new methyl sources. By utilizing a methylamine&#8208;water system as the methyl precursor and a cascade assembly strategy for deuteration degree control, we synthesized methylated compounds with varying degrees of deuterium incorporation, showcasing the versatility of this approach. We examined a range of &#946;&#8208;diketone substrates and synthesized key intermediates for drug and bioactive compounds with varying degrees of deuterium incorporation, ranging from 0 to 3. We also investigated and discussed the postulated reaction pathway. This work demonstrates the utility of readily available reagents, methylamines and water, as a new methyl source, and provides a simple and efficient strategy for the synthesis of degree&#8208;controllable deuterium&#8208;labelled compounds.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural Interconversion Based on Intramolecular Boroxine Formation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel structural interconversion unit based on intramolecular boroxine formation and hydrolysis has been developed. Owing to entropic factors, a macrocyclic triboronic acid and tricyclic boroxine can be dynamically interconverted by simple heating/cooling. The entropically stabilized tricyclic boroxine also shows high stability against hydrolysis.







Abstract
A novel structural interconversion unit based on intramolecular boroxine formation has been developed. A macrocyclic triboronic acid consisting of three phenylboronic acid units linked by covalent linkers preferentially underwent intramolecular rather than intermolecular boroxine formation, resulting in a quantitative formation of tricyclic boroxine. This structural transformation was accompanied by changes in the polarity, flexibility, and size of the molecule. Dynamic interconversion between the macrocyclic triboronic acid and the tricyclic boroxine was achieved by simple heating/cooling, whereas no boroxine formation occurred upon heating when three boronic acid units were not connected by linkers. Thermodynamic analysis revealed that the entropic advantage of the intramolecular boroxine formation process resulted in these unique features. The entropically stabilized tricyclic boroxine also shows high stability with respect to hydrolysis.

Abstract
A class of organomanganese hydrogenation catalysts was recently rediscovered. These are simple dinuclear Mn(I) carbonyl compounds with phosphido (PR2&#8722;) and hydrido (H&#8722;) bridges. This class of compounds has been known since the 1960&#8217;s, and they have rich coordination chemistry and reactivity. Given their recently discovered potential for catalytic applications, a fresh look at this class of compounds was necessary. Hence, this Review comprehensively covers the synthesis, reactivity, and catalysis of this interesting class of molecules.

         <title>A DNA&#8208;Based Dissipation System that Synchronizes Multiple Fuels</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A DNA&#8208;based dissipation system with synchronized multiple molecular fuels provides multiple transient states and enhanced complexity. The dissipation system is harnessed to dynamically regulate the assembly of DNA nanotubes allowing for controlling the assembly kinetics by multiple fuels.







Abstract
Artificial dissipative networks have emerged as advanced bionic systems for the development of material technology and synthetic biology. Here, a DNA&#8208;based artificial dissipation system is demonstrated that synchronizes multiple energy&#8208;rich molecules (fuels) including oligonucleotide, dNTP, and ATP. The autonomous operation of the dissipation system relies on the integration of DNA reaction network including polymerase extension, kinase phosphorylation, and exonuclease digestion. The use of multiple fuels provides multiple transient states with different energy levels and fine&#8208;tuning dissipative kinetics. The lifetime of the transient state can be programmed to increase or decrease just by varying one of the fuel molecules unlike conventional DNA&#8208;based dissipative systems where the increase in the concentration of fuel molecule extends the lifetime. This design greatly expands the toolkits for establishing dissipative/dynamic DNA networks. The dissipation system is harnessed to dynamically regulate the assembly of DNA nanotubes allowing for controlling the assembly kinetics by multiple fuels. Owing to the multiple transient states in the dissipation system, two nanotubes can be regulated in parallel. It is envisioned that the system will find broad application in responsive materials, soft robotics, biosensors, and on&#8208;demand drug delivery.

         <title>Exploration of N&#8208;Arylation of Backbone Amides as a Novel Tool for Conformational Modification in Peptides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
As an inquisitive approach, cyclic peptides containing N&#8208;aryl alanine amino acids were synthesized. Their conformations in solution were determined by NMR spectroscopy and compared with those of other N&#8208;modified peptides. The compounds showed relatively high conformational homogeneity and populated well&#8208;characterized antiparallel &#946;&#8208;sheet structures having discrete &#946;&#8208; and &#947;&#8208;turns and hydrogen bonding patterns; these have been classified into different templates.







Abstract
A set of 15 cyclic&#8208;hexaalanine and 10 cyclic&#8208;pentaalanine peptides containing one or two backbone N&#8208;aryl amide bonds were synthesized by following a combination of solution&#8208;phase and solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis. NMR&#8208;based conformation studies of these N&#8208;aryl cyclic&#8208;hexaalanine peptides revealed five distinct template conformations with an antiparallel &#946;&#8208;sheet structure; for N&#8208;aryl cyclic&#8208;pentaalanine peptides three template structures were revealed. All the template structures have distinct peptide&#8208;turn features. The conformations in these N&#8208;aryl peptides were compared to those in the commonly studied N&#8208;methyl peptide analogues. We observed that the N&#8208;aryl peptides exhibit a considerable conformational homogeneity, and their conformations differ significantly from those in N&#8208;methyl analogues. We anticipate that the N&#8208;arylation of backbone amides has the potential for application as a novel tool for conformation and physicochemical modification in peptides.

         <title>Persistent and Predominantly Localized Boron Radical from the Reduction of a Three&#8208;Dimensional Analogue of NHC&#8208;Stabilized Borafluorenium</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The single&#8208;electron reduction of a 3D NHC&#8208;stabilized 9&#8208;borafluorenium cation leads to the formation of a persistent 3D 9&#8208;borafluorene radical that exhibits remarkable stability in both solid and solution states. Single crystal structure, EPR analysis, and theoretical studies indicate that the unpaired electron is predominantly located on boron.







Abstract
In this contribution, we reported the three&#8208;dimensional (3D) analogues of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;stabilized 9&#8208;borafluorenium and 9&#8208;borafluorene radical. The radical was fully characterized by cyclic voltammetry (CV), UV&#8208;Vis absorption spectroscopy, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses. The distinct boron&#8208;centered radical character of 9&#8208;borafluorene radical was corroborated by DFT calculations and EPR analysis.

         <title>Organic Afterglow Nanoparticles in Bioapplications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic afterglow nanoparticles are unique optical materials that emit light long after cessation of excitation. Due to their advantages of no need for real&#8208;time light excitation, avoiding autofluorescence, low imaging background, high signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio, deep tissue penetration, and high sensitivity, afterglow imaging technology has been widely used in cell tracking, biosensing, cancer diagnosis, and cancer therapy, which provides an effective technical method for the acquisition of molecular information with high sensitivity, specificity and real&#8208;time at the cellular and living level. In this review, we summarize and illustrate the recent progress of organic afterglow imaging, focusing on the mechanism of organic afterglow materials and their biological application. Furthermore, we also discuss the potential challenges and the further directions of this field.</dc:description>

         <title>Direction Switching and Self&#8208;recovering Mechanochromic Luminescence of Anthracene&#8208;modified o&#8208;Carboranes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report luminochromic behaviors regarding mechanochromic luminescence (MCL) of o&#8208;carborane&#8208;modified anthracene derivatives. We have previously synthesized bis&#8208;o&#8208;carborane&#8208;substituted anthracene 1 and found that its crystal polymorph 1a show dual&#8208;emission properties composed of excimer and charge transfer (CT) emission bands in solid. Initially, we observed the bathchromic MCL behavior from 1a originating from emission mechanism alteration from dual emission to CT emission. By inserting the ethynylene spacers between anthracene and o&#8208;carboranes, compound 2 was obtained. Interestingly, 2 showed hypsochromic MCL originating from the emission mechanism alteration from CT to excimer emission. Furthermore, luminescent color of ground 1a can be recovered to the initial state by allowing to stand at room temperature, meaning that self&#8208;recovery proceeds. Detailed analyses are described in this study.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Bisubstrate Analogues for RNA Methylation Studies using two Transition Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>RNA methyltransferases (RNA MTases) are a family of enzymes that catalyze the methylation of RNA using the cofactor S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;L&#8208;methionine. While RNA MTases are promising drug targets, new molecules are needed to fully understand their roles in disease and to develop effective drugs that can modulate their activity. Since RNA MTases are suitable for bisubstrate binding, we report an original strategy for the synthesis of a new family of m6A MTases bisubstrate analogues. Six compounds containing a SAM analogue unit covalently tethered by a triazole ring to the N&#8208;6 position of an adenosine were synthesized. A procedure using two transition metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions was used to introduce the a&#8208;amino acid motif mimicking the methionine chain of the cofactor SAM. First, an iCuAAC reaction afforded the 5&#8208;iodo&#8208;1,4&#8208;disubstituted&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazole which was functionalized by palladium&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling&#160; to connect the a&#8208;amino acid substituent. Docking studies of our molecules in the active site of the m6A ribosomal MTase RlmJ show that the use of triazole as a linker provides additional interactions and the presence of the a&#8208;amino acid chain stabilizes the bisubstrate. The synthetic method developed here enhances the structural diversity of bisubstrate analogues to explore the active site of RNA modification enzymes and to develop new inhibitors.</dc:description>

         <title>Substitution Effects on the Photophysical and Photoredox Properties of Tetraaza[7]helicenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of substituted derivatives of a tetraaza[7]helicenes were synthesized and the influence of the substitution on their photophysical and photoredox&#8208;catalytic properties was studied. The combination of their high fluorescence quantum yields of up to 0.65 and their circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) activity results in CPL brightness values (BCPL) that are among the highest recorded for [7]helicenes so far. A sulfonylation/hetarylation reaction using cyanopyridines as substrates for photoinduced electron transfer (PET) from the excited helicenes was conducted to test for viability in photoredox catalysis. DFT calculations predict the introduction of electron withdrawing substituents to yield more oxidizing catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>A Novel Nitridoborate Hydride Sr13[BN2]6H8 Elucidated from X&#8208;Ray and Neutron Diffraction Data</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal hydrides are an uprising compound class bringing up various functional materials. Due to the low X&#8208;ray scattering power of hydrogen, neutron diffraction is often crucial to fully disclose the structural characteristics thereof. We herein present the second strontium nitridoborate hydride known so far, Sr13[BN2]6H8, formed in a solid&#8208;state reaction of the binary nitrides and strontium hydride at 950&#160;&#176;C. The crystal structure was elucidated based on single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray and neutron powder diffraction in the hexagonal space group P63/m (no.176), exhibiting a novel three&#8208;dimensional network of [BN2]3&#8722; units and hydride anions connected by strontium cations. Further analyses with magic angle spinning (MAS) NMR and vibrational spectroscopy corroborate the presence of anionic hydrogen within the structure. Quantum chemical calculations reveal the electronic properties and support the experimental outcome. Sr13[BN2]6H8 expands the emerging family of nitridoborate hydrides, broadening the access to an open field of new, intriguing materials.</dc:description>

         <title>A Predictive Model for the Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Site&#8208;Selective Oxidation of Diols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A predictive model, shaped as a set of rules, is presented that predicts site&#8208;selectivity in the mono&#8208;oxidation of diols by palladium&#8208;neocuproine catalysis. For this, the factors that govern this site&#8208;selectivity within diols and between different diols have been studied both experimentally and with computation. It is shown that an electronegative substituent antiperiplanar to the C&#8211;H bond retards hydride abstraction, resulting in a lower reactivity. This explains the selective oxidation of axial hydroxy groups in vicinal cis&#8208;diols. Furthermore, DFT calculations and competition experiments show how the reaction rate of different diols is determined by their configuration and conformational freedom. The model has been validated by the oxidation of several complex natural products, including two steroids. From a synthesis perspective, the model predicts whether a natural product comprising multiple hydroxy groups is a suitable substrate for site&#8208;selective palladium&#8208;catalyzed oxidation.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Sub&#8208;Nanochannels Formed Inside Solid&#8208;State Nanopore with Proton Ultra&#8208;High Selectivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) have the advantages of high porosity, angstrom&#8208;scale pore size, and unique structure. In this work, a kind of MOFs, UiO&#8208;66 and its derivatives (including aminated UiO&#8208;66&#8208;(NH2)2 and sulfonated UiO&#8208;66&#8208;(NH&#8208;SAG)2), were constructed on the inner surface of solid&#8208;state nanopores for ultra&#8208;selective proton transport. UiO&#8208;66 and UiO&#8208;66&#8208;(NH2)2 nanocrystal particles were in&#8208;situ grown at the orifice of glass nanopores firstly, which were used to investigate the ionic current responses in LiCl and HCl solutions when the monovalent anions (Cl&#8208;) were unchanged. Compared with UiO&#8208;66&#8208;modifed nanopores, the aminated MOFs modification (UiO&#8208;66&#8208;(NH2)2) can improve the proton selectivity obviously. However, when the UiO&#8208;66&#8208;(NH&#8208;SAG)2 nanopore is prepared by further post&#8208;modification with sulfo&#8208;acetic acid, lithium ions can hardly pass through the channel, and the interaction between protons and sulfonic acid groups can promote the transport of protons, thus achieving ultra&#8208;high selectivity to protons. This work provides a new way to achieve sub&#8208;nanochannels with high selectivity, which can widely be used in ion separation, sensing and energy conversion.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have the advantages of high porosity, angstrom-scale pore size, and unique structure. In this work, a kind of MOFs, UiO-66 and its derivatives (including aminated UiO-66-(NH2)2 and sulfonated UiO-66-(NH-SAG)2), were constructed on the inner surface of solid-state nanopores for ultra-selective proton transport. UiO-66 and UiO-66-(NH2)2 nanocrystal particles were in-situ grown at the orifice of glass nanopores firstly, which were used to investigate the ionic current responses in LiCl and HCl solutions when the monovalent anions (Cl-) were unchanged. Compared with UiO-66-modifed nanopores, the aminated MOFs modification (UiO-66-(NH2)2) can improve the proton selectivity obviously. However, when the UiO-66-(NH-SAG)2 nanopore is prepared by further post-modification with sulfo-acetic acid, lithium ions can hardly pass through the channel, and the interaction between protons and sulfonic acid groups can promote the transport of protons, thus achieving ultra-high selectivity to protons. This work provides a new way to achieve sub-nanochannels with high selectivity, which can widely be used in ion separation, sensing and energy conversion.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Computational Study of Single Metal Atom Anchored on Black Phosphorus for Methane Oxidation to Methanol by Nitrous Oxide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Direct conversion of methane to the high&#8208;value&#8208;added transportable chemicals is of great challenge, which requires high energy input to break the strong C&#8208;H bond. Developing efficient catalysts for methane oxidation to methanol under mild conditions is of vital importance. In this work, the single transition metal atoms (TM = Fe, Co, Ni, Cu) anchored on black phosphorus (TM@BP) were studied as catalysts to assist the methane oxidation to methanol by means of first&#8208;principles calculations. The results indicate that Cu@BP exhibits an outstanding catalytic activity through the radical reaction pathways and the formation of the Cu&#8208;O active site is the rate&#8208;determining with an energy barrier of 0.48 eV. Meanwhile, electronic structure calculations and dynamic simulations show that Cu@BP offer excellent thermal stability. Our calculations provide a new approach for the rational design of single atom catalysts for methane oxidation to methanol.</dc:description>

         <title>Use of Biomass Glycerol as a Reducing Agent for Photocatalytic Deprotection of Pyridine N&#8208;Oxides in an Aqueous Suspension of Titanium(IV) Oxide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Deprotection of pyridine N&#8208;oxides under a mild condition with an inexpensive and environmentally friendly reducing reagent is important. The use of biomass waste as the reducing reagent, water as the solvent and solar light as the energy source is one of the most promising approaches with minimal impact on the environment. A TiO2 photocatalyst and glycerol successfully combine these items and stoichiometric deprotection of pyridine N&#8208;oxide (PyNO) with a minimal amount of glycerol (PyNO:glycerol= 7:1) was achieved, with only CO2 being produced as the final oxidation product of glycerol. The deprotection of PyNO is thermally accelerated. Under solar light, the temperature of the reaction system increased to 40&#8208;50oC and PyNO was also quantitatively deprotected, indicating that solar energy, i.e., UV light and thermal energy, can be effectively used. The results provide a new approach in the fields of organic chemistry and medical chemistry using biomass waste and solar light.</dc:description>

         <title>Protocell Self&#8208;Assembly Driven by Sodium Trimetaphosphate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phosphorus is not only an essential element for life but also an important activation component for multiple types of prebiotics on early Earth. Synergistic symbiosis between N&#8208;acyl amino acid (NAA)&#8208;type membrane precursor and peptide can be realized via sodium trimetaphosphate (P3m) activation effect based on the different activation mechanisms, which plays a significant role in the emergence of functionalized protocells.







Abstract
The co&#8208;evolution of peptide formation and membrane self&#8208;assembly is considered an essential step in the origin of life. However, more research is required on both processes, particularly on the interaction between prebiotic simple fatty&#8208;acid membranes and peptide synthesis. In this study, the sodium trimetaphosphate (P3m)&#8208;activated peptide formation reaction of phenylalanine (Phe) in an alkaline decanoic acid&#8208;decanol vesicle system was systematically investigated. The experimental results showed that peptide formation could competitively occur with N&#8208;acyl amino acid (NAA) formation. NAA formation did not follow the traditional P3m&#8208;activated peptide formation reaction involving the intermediate cyclic acylphosphoramidate (CAPA). Decanoic acid was activated by P3m to form a mixed anhydride, which then reacted with an amino acid to form the amide NAA. As a kind of membrane&#8208;forming amphiphile, NAA can form vesicles independently and reduce the critical vesicle concentration of the fatty&#8208;acid vesicles. Moreover, 11 other representative amino acids, namely alanine (Ala), aspartic acid (Asp), glutamic acid (Glu), glycine (Gly), isoleucine (Ile), leucine (Leu), proline (Pro), serine (Ser), threonine (Thr), valine (Val), and arginine (Arg), were selected for investigation. All of them reacted with decanoic acid to form NAA via the activation effect of P3m. The abovementioned mechanism involving P3m&#8208;activated carboxylic acid has not been reported in the literature. Our experimental results indicate that the participation of decanoic acid in the P3m activation&#8208;based peptide formation reaction system plays a significant role in the emergence of functionalized protocells. The P3m activation effect can provide diversified raw membrane materials to form and stabilize protocell membranes; moreover, the small peptides, such as Phe&#8208;Leu, formed in the same reaction system can induce the amplification of primitive cells. This implies that synergistic symbiosis between membrane and peptide can be realized via the P3m activation effect.

         <title>An Amphiphilic Peptide Carrier for HCl Transport</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single molecules that co&#8208;transport cations as well as anions across lipid membranes are few despite their high biological utility. The elegant yet simple lipidomimetic peptide design herein enables efficient HCl transport without the use of any external additives for proton transport. The carboxylic acids in the dipeptide scaffold provide a handle to append two long hydrophobic tails and also provides a polar hydrophilic carboxylate group. The peptide central unit also provides NH sites for anion&#8208;binding. Protonation of the carboxylate group coupled with the weak halide binding of the terminal NH group results in HCl transport with transport rates of H+ &gt; Cl&#8254;. The lipid&#8208;like structure also facilitates seamless membrane integration and flipping of the molecule. The biocompatibility, design simplicity and potential pH regulation of these molecules open up several avenues for their therapeutic use.</dc:description>

         <title>EnT&#8208;Mediated Amino&#8208;Sulfonylation of Alkenes with Bifunctional Sulfonamides: Access to &#946;&#8208;Amino Sulfone Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#946;&#8208;Amino sulfones are commonly found structural motifs in biologically active compounds. Herein, we report a direct photocatalyzed amino&#8208;sulfonylation reaction of alkenes for the efficicient production of important compounds by simple hydrolysis without the need for additional oxidants and reductants. In this transformation, the sulfonamides worked as bifunctional reagents, simultaneously generating sulfonyl radicals and N&#8208;centered radicals which were added to alkene in a highly atom&#8208;economical fashion with high regioselectivity and diastereoselectivity. This approach showed high functional group tolerance and compatibility, facilitating the late&#8208;stage modification of some bioactive alkenes and sulfonamide molecules, thereby expanding the biologically relevant chemical space. Scaling up this reaction led to an efficient green synthesis of apremilast, one of the best&#8208;selling pharmceuticals, demonstrating the synthetic utility of the applied method. Moreover, mechanistic investigations suggest that an energy transfer (EnT) process was in operation.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Benzene&#8208;1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrathiolate (btt) has been used as a bridging ligand to prepare a redox active (molybdenocene dithiolene)&#8208;based bimetallic complex Cp2Mo(btt)MoCp2, which exhibits four successive electron transfers up to the tetracation. Spectro&#8208;electrochemical investigations together with DFT and TD&#8208;DFT calculations evidence that the two electroactive MoS2C2 metallacycles are electronically coupled in the monocationic as in the dicationic state. Two salts of the dication [Cp2Mo(btt)MoCp2]2+ have been structurally characterized with PF6&#8722; and HSO4&#8722; counterions, showing different chair or boat conformations associated with variable folding angles of the two MoS2C2 metallacycles along the S&#8208;&#8208;&#8208;S hinge. The bis&#8208;oxidized dicationic complex exhibits a diradical character, with both radicals essentially localized on the metallacycles and with antiferromagnetic coupling evidenced from magnetic susceptibility measurements.</dc:description>

         <title>The first Cu(I)&#8208;peptoid complex: enabling metal ion stability and selectivity via backbone helicity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stabilization of Cu(I) is ubiquitous within native copper proteins. Understanding how to stabilize Cu(I) within synthetic biomimetic systems is therefore desired towards biological applications. Peptoids are an important class of peptodomimetics, that can bind metal ions and stabilize them in their high oxidation state. Thus, up to date, they were not used for Cu(I) binding. Here we show how the helical peptoid hexamer, having two 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine (Bipy) groups that face the same side of the helix, forms the intramolecular air stable Cu(I) complex. Further study of the binding site by rigorous spectroscopic techniques suggests that Cu(I) is tetracoordinated, binding to only three N atoms from the Bipy ligands and to the N&#8208;terminus of the peptoid's backbone. A set of control peptoids and experiments indicates that the Cu(I) stability and selectivity are dictated by the intramolecular binding, forced by the helicity of the peptoid, which can be defined as the second coordination sphere of the metal center.</dc:description>

         <title>Through&#8208;Space, Lone&#8208;Pair Promoted Aromatic Substitution: A Relay Mechanism Can Beat Out Direct Activation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a detailed experimental and theoretical analysis of through&#8208;space arene activation with halogens, tetrazoles and achiral esters and amides. Contrary to previously assumed direct activation through &#963;&#8208;complex stabilization, our results suggest that these reactions proceed by a relay mechanism wherein the lone pair&#8208;containing activators form exothermic &#960;&#8208;complexes with electrophilic nitronium ion before transferring it to the probe ring through low barrier transition states. Noncovalent interactions (NCI) plots and Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules (QTAIM) analyses depict favorable interactions between the Lewis base (LB) and the nitronium ion in the precomplexes and the transition states, suggesting directing group participation throughout the mechanism. The regioselectivity of substitution also comports with a relay mechanism. In all, these data pave the way for an alternate platform of electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Kinetically controlled star copolymer self&#8208;assembly for rapid fabrication of nanoparticles with high encapsulation capacity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rapid and scalable self&#8208;assembly of an amphiphilic 21&#8208;arm star copolymer, (polystyrene&#8208;block&#8208;polyethylene glycol)21 [(PS&#8208;b&#8208;PEG)21] in aqueous solution has been performed via reverse solvent exchange procedure. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) and nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) reveal the formation of nanoparticles with narrow size distribution. Further investigation indicates a kinetically controlled self&#8208;assembly mechanism of the copolymers, in which the star topology of the amphiphilic copolymer and deep quenching condition by reverse solvent exchange are key to accelerate intrachain contraction of the copolymer during phase separation. When interchain contraction dominant over interchain association, nanoparticles with low aggregation number could be formed. Thanks to the high hydrophobic contents of the (PS&#8208;b&#8208;PEG)21 polymers, the resulted nanoparticles could encapsulate a high capacity of hydrophobic cargo up to 19.84%. The kinetically controlled star copolymer self&#8208;assembly process reported here provides a platform for the rapid and scalable fabrication of nanoparticle with high drug loading capacity (LC), which may find broad range of applications in, e.g. drug delivery, nanopesticide.</dc:description>

         <title>Potent and Selective Cell&#8208;Active Iminosugar Inhibitors of Human &#945;&#8208;N&#8208;Acetylgalactosaminidase (&#945;&#8208;NAGAL)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glycoside hydrolases (GHs) are a class of enzymes with emerging roles in various diseases. Selective GH inhibitors are sought to better understand their functions and assess the therapeutic potential of modulating their activities. Iminosugars are a promising class of GH inhibitors but typically lack the selectivity required to accurately perturb biological systems. Here, we describe a concise synthesis of iminosugar inhibitors of N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;galactosaminidase (&#945;&#8208;NAGAL), the GH responsible for cleaving terminal &#945;&#8208;N&#8208;acetylgalactosamine residues from glycoproteins and glycoconjugates. Starting from non&#8208;carbohydrate precursors, this modular synthesis supported the identification of a potent (490 nM) and &#945;&#8208;NAGAL selective (~200&#8208;fold) guanidino&#8208;containing derivative DGJNGuan.&#160; To illustrate the cellular activity of this new inhibitor, we developed a quantitative fluorescence image&#8208;based method to measure levels of the Tn&#8208;antigen, a cellular glycoprotein substrate of a&#8208;NAGAL. Using this assay we show that DGJGuan exhibits excellent inhibition of a&#8208;NAGAL within cells using patient derived fibroblasts (EC50 = 150 nM). Moreover, in vitro and in cell assays to assess levels of lysosomal b&#8208;hexosaminidase substrate ganglioside GM2 show that DGJGuan is selective whereas DGJNAc exhibits off&#8208;target inhibition both in vitro and within cells. DGJNGuan is a readily produced and selective tool compound that should prove useful for investigating the physiological roles of &#945;&#8208;NAGAL.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Glycoside hydrolases (GHs) are a class of enzymes with emerging roles in various diseases. Selective GH inhibitors are sought to better understand their functions and assess the therapeutic potential of modulating their activities. Iminosugars are a promising class of GH inhibitors but typically lack the selectivity required to accurately perturb biological systems. Here, we describe a concise synthesis of iminosugar inhibitors of N-acetyl-&#945;-galactosaminidase (&#945;-NAGAL), the GH responsible for cleaving terminal &#945;-N-acetylgalactosamine residues from glycoproteins and glycoconjugates. Starting from non-carbohydrate precursors, this modular synthesis supported the identification of a potent (490 nM) and &#945;-NAGAL selective (~200-fold) guanidino-containing derivative DGJNGuan.&#160; To illustrate the cellular activity of this new inhibitor, we developed a quantitative fluorescence image-based method to measure levels of the Tn-antigen, a cellular glycoprotein substrate of a-NAGAL. Using this assay we show that DGJGuan exhibits excellent inhibition of a-NAGAL within cells using patient derived fibroblasts (EC50 = 150 nM). Moreover, in vitro and in cell assays to assess levels of lysosomal b-hexosaminidase substrate ganglioside GM2 show that DGJGuan is selective whereas DGJNAc exhibits off-target inhibition both in vitro and within cells. DGJNGuan is a readily produced and selective tool compound that should prove useful for investigating the physiological roles of &#945;-NAGAL.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>RNA&#8208;catalyzed RNA Ligation within Prebiotically Plausible Model Protocells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Demonstrating RNA catalysis within prebiotically relevant models of primordial cells (protocells) remains a challenge in Origins of life research. Fatty acid vesicles encapsulating genomic and catalytic RNAs (ribozymes) are attractive models for protocells; however, RNA catalysis has largely been incompatible with fatty acid vesicles due to their instability in the presence of Mg2+ at concentrations required for ribozyme function. Here, we report a ribozyme that catalyzes template&#8208;directed RNA ligation at low Mg2+ concentrations and thus remains active within stable vesicles. Ribose and adenine, both prebiotically relevant molecules, were found to greatly reduce Mg2+&#8208;induced RNA leakage from vesicles. When we co&#8208;encapsulated the ribozyme, substrate, and template within fatty acid vesicles, we observed efficient RNA&#8208;catalyzed RNA ligation upon subsequent addition of Mg2+. Our work shows that RNA&#8208;catalyzed RNA assembly can occur efficiently within prebiotically plausible fatty acid vesicles and represents a step toward the replication of primordial genomes within self&#8208;replicating protocells.</dc:description>

         <title>First Example of 1,2,5&#8208;Oxadiazole&#8208;Based Hypergolic Ionic Liquids: a New Class of Potential Energetic Fuels</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of liquid energetic fuels with improved properties is important topic in space propulsion technologies. In this manuscript, a series of energetic ionic liquids incorporating a 1,2,5&#8208;oxadiazole ring and nitrate, dicyanamide or dinitramide anion was synthesized and their physicochemical properties were evaluated. The synthesized compounds were fully characterized and were found to have good thermal stabilities (up to 219 &#176;C) and experimental densities (1.21&#8208;1.47 g cm&#8208;3). Advantageously, 1,2,5&#8208;oxadiazole&#8208;based ionic liquids have high combined nitrogen&#8208;oxygen contents (up to 64.4%), while their detonation velocities are on the level of known explosive TNT, and combustion performance exceeds those of benchmark 2&#8208;hydroxyethylhydrazinium nitrate. Considering the established hypergolicity with H2O2 in the presence of a catalyst, and insensitivity to impact, synthesized ionic liquids have strong application potential as energetic fuels for space technologies.</dc:description>
