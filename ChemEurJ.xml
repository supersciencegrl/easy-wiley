         <title>Symmetry&#8208;Breaking and Symmetry&#8208; Retaining Morphological Evolution of the Single Crystals of Cyclodextrin Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>

         <dc:description>The morphological symmetry&#8208;retaining and symmetry&#8208;breaking of single crystals of  the &#947;&#8208;cyclodextrin metal&#8208;organic framework have been achieved via introducing lower symmetric &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrins and &#945;&#8208;cyclodextrins, respectively.&#946;&#8208;cyclodextrins led to a morphological evolution with retained symmetry from cubic to rhombic dodecahedra, while &#945;&#8208;cyclodextrins resulted in the original cubic crystal missing a vertex angle presenting symmetry&#8208;breaking behavior.The crystal structures of rhombic dodecahedra and angle&#8208;deficient crystals were confirmed through X&#8208;ray crystallography, and the mechanisms underlying the morphological transformation evolution were further analyzed. Our work not only provides a rare case realizing two different paths of morphological evolution in one system, but also encourages future efforts towards the evolution of artificial crystal systems in a natural way.</dc:description>

         <title>N&#8208;Heterocyclic carbene enabled functionalization of inert C(sp3)&#8208;H bonds via hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) processes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing methods to directly transform C(sp3)&#8208;H bonds is crucial in synthetic chemistry due to their prevalence in various organic compounds. While conventional protocols have largely relied on transition metal catalysis, recent advancements in organocatalysis, particularly with radical NHC catalysis have sparked interest in the direct functionalization of "inert" C(sp3)&#8208;H bonds for cross C&#8208;C coupling with carbonyl moieties. This strategy involves selective cleavage of C(sp3)&#8208;H bonds to generate key carbon radicals, often achieved via hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) processes. By leveraging the bond dissociation energy (BDE) and polarity effects, HAT enables the rapid functionalization of diverse C(sp3)&#8208;H substrates, such as ethers, amines, and alkanes. This mini&#8208;review summarizes the progress in carbene organocatalytic functionalization of inert C(sp3)&#8208;H bonds enabled by HAT processes, categorizing them into two sections: 1) C&#8208;H functionalization involving acyl azolium intermediates; and 2) functionalization of C&#8208;H bonds via reductive Breslow intermediates.</dc:description>

         <title>Conformational Analysis of (+)&#8208;Germacrene D&#8208;4&#8208;ol Using the Crystalline Sponge Method to Elucidate the Origin of its Instability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The crystalline sponge (CS) method was employed for the X&#8208;ray conformational analysis of a relatively unstable terpene compound, (+)&#8208;germacrene D&#8208;4&#8208;ol. The CS method revealed a reactive conformation of this terpene, in which two double bonds are in proximity.







Abstract
Unsaturated cyclic terpenes often exhibit instability due to the proximation of C=C bonds in the cyclic skeleton, leading to nonenzymatic degradation. In this study, the crystalline sponge (CS) method was employed for the X&#8208;ray conformational analysis of a minute amount of oily and cyclic terpene compound, (+)&#8208;germacrene D&#8208;4&#8208;ol, which was produced by a terpene synthase OILTS under in&#8197;vitro conditions. The CS method revealed a reactive conformation of the cyclic terpene with proximal double bonds. Under weakly acidic in&#8197;vivo conditions, OILTS gave four pseudo&#8208;natural products or artifacts. The CS method also elucidated the structures of these degraded compounds, proposing a degradation mechanism triggered by the transannular reactions.

         <title>Grain Boundary Defect Engineering in Rutile Iridium Oxide Boosts Efficient and Stable Acidic Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Joule heating pretreatment and carbon templates are used to construct grain boudary&#8208;rich IrO2 nanoparticles for promoting acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The assembled proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) with the optimized catalyst (350&#8208;IrO2) exhibits high activity (1.68&#8197;V at 1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2, 1.84&#8197;V at 2&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and stability (100&#8197;h at 1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2).







Abstract
Proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) is considered a promising technology for coupling with renewable energy sources to achieve clean hydrogen production. However, constrained by the sluggish kinetics of the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the acidic abominable environment render the grand challenges in developing the active and stable OER electrocatalyst, leading to low efficiency of PEMWE. Herein, we develop the rutile&#8208;type IrO2 nanoparticles with abundant grain boundaries and the continuous nanostructure through the joule heating and sacrificial template method. The optimal candidate (350&#8208;IrO2) demonstrates remarkable electrocatalytic activity and stability during the OER, presenting a promising advancement for efficient PEMWE. DFT calculations verified that grain boundaries can modulate the electronic structure of Ir sites and optimize the adsorption of oxygen intermediates, resulting in the accelerated kinetics. 350&#8208;IrO2 affords a rapid OER process with 20&#8197;times higher mass activity (0.61&#8197;A mgIr&#8722;1) than the commercial IrO2 at 1.50&#8197;V vs. RHE. Benefiting from the reduced overpotential and the preservation of the stable rutile structure, 350&#8208;IrO2 exhibits the stability of 200&#8197;h test at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with only trace decay of 11.8&#8197;mV. Moreover, the assembled PEMWE with anode 350&#8208;IrO2 catalyst outputs the current density up to 2&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with only 1.84&#8197;V applied voltage, long&#8208;term operation for 100&#8197;h without obvious performance degradation at 1&#8197;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Synthesis of Styrylbenzazole Photoswitches and Evaluation of their Photochemical Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the synthesis and photochemical study of 23 styrylbenzazole photoswitches, which exhibit interesting properties, such as high thermal stabilities of the Z isomers, high quantum yields and negative photochromism. Furthermore, we found that the thermal stability, quantum yields, maximum absorption wavelength and photostationary state distributions can be tuned by modifying the benzazole heterocycle and the substitution pattern on the aryl ring.







Abstract
Styrylbenzazoles form a promising yet under&#8208;represented class of photoswitches that can perform a light&#8208;driven E&#8208;Z isomerization of the central alkene double bond without undergoing irreversible photocyclization, typical of the parent stilbene. In this work, we report the synthesis and photochemical study of 23 styrylbenzazole photoswitches. Their thermal stabilities, quantum yields, maximum absorption wavelengths and photostationary state (PSS) distributions can be tuned by changing the benzazole heterocycle and the substitution pattern on the aryl ring. In particular, we found that push&#8208;pull systems show large redshifts of the maximum absorption wavelengths and the highest quantum yields, whereas ortho&#8208;substituted styrylbenzazole photoswitches exhibit the most favorable PSS ratios. Taking advantage of both design principles, we produced 2,6&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;4&#8208;(dimethylamino)&#8208;styrylbenzothiazole, a thermally stable and efficient P&#8208;type photoswitch which displays negative photochromism upon irradiation with visible light up to 470&#8197;nm to obtain a near&#8208;quantitative isomerization with a very high quantum yield of 59&#8201;%. Furthermore, 4&#8208;hydroxystyrylbenzoxazole was demonstrated to be a pH&#8208;sensitive switch which exhibits a 100&#8197;nm redshift upon deprotonation. Ortho&#8208;methylation of its benzothiazole analogue improved the obtained PSS ratio in its deprotonated state from E&#8201;:&#8201;Z=53&#8201;:&#8201;47 to E&#8201;:&#8201;Z=18&#8201;:&#8201;82. We anticipate that this relatively unexplored class of photoswitches will form a valuable expansion of the current family of photoswitches.

&lt;p&gt;Styrylbenzazoles form a promising yet under-represented class of photoswitches that can perform a light-driven &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt; isomerization of the central alkene double bond without undergoing irreversible photocyclization, typical of the parent stilbene. In this work, we report the synthesis and photochemical study of 23 styrylbenzazole photoswitches. Their thermal stabilities, quantum yields, maximum absorption wavelengths and photostationary state (PSS) distributions can be tuned by changing the benzazole heterocycle and the substitution pattern on the aryl ring. In particular, we found that push-pull systems show large redshifts of the maximum absorption wavelengths and the highest quantum yields, whereas &lt;i&gt;ortho-&lt;/i&gt;substituted styrylbenzazole photoswitches exhibit the most favorable PSS ratios. Taking advantage of both design principles, we produced 2,6-dimethyl-4-(dimethylamino)-styrylbenzothiazole, a thermally stable and efficient P-type photoswitch which displays negative photochromism upon irradiation with visible light up to 470&#8197;nm to obtain a near-quantitative isomerization with a very high quantum yield of 59&#8201;%. Furthermore, 4-hydroxystyrylbenzoxazole was demonstrated to be a pH-sensitive switch which exhibits a 100&#8197;nm redshift upon deprotonation. &lt;i&gt;Ortho&lt;/i&gt;-methylation of its benzothiazole analogue improved the obtained PSS ratio in its deprotonated state from &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;&#8201;:&#8201;&lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;=53&#8201;:&#8201;47 to &lt;i&gt;E&#8201;:&#8201;Z&lt;/i&gt;=18&#8201;:&#8201;82. We anticipate that this relatively unexplored class of photoswitches will form a valuable expansion of the current family of photoswitches.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photoredox/Bismuth Relay Catalysis Enabling Reductive Alkylation of Nitroarenes with Aldehydes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoredox/bismuth relay catalysis: A mild and transition metal&#8208;free visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced Photoredox/bismuth dual catalytic system allows sequential hydrogenation of nitroarenes and reductive dibenzylation and provides an facile access to N,N&#8208;dibenzyl anilines.







Abstract
The effective transition metal&#8208;free photoredox/bismuth dual catalytic reductive dialkylation of nitroarenes with benzaldehydes has been reported. The nitroarene reduction through visible light&#8208;driven photoredox catalysis was integrated with subsequent reductive dialkylation of anilines under bismuth catalysis to enable the cascade reductive alkylation of nitroarenes with carbonyls. Salient features of this relay catalysis system include mild reaction conditions, no requirement for transition metal catalysts, easy handling, step&#8208;economy, and high selectivity.

         <title>Thixotropic Composite Hydrogel Electrode Composed of a Polymer Hydrogelator and Water&#8208;Dispersive Tungsten Oxide Flat Microparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gel electrode material: Water&#8208;dispersive WO3 flat microparticles were newly synthesized, demonstrating potential as a spreadable electrode material by mixing with a molecular hydrogel composed of a hydrogelator.







Abstract
Here, we introduce an organic/inorganic composite hydrogel as a versatile gel electrode material. This composite hydrogel was formed by simply mixing an aqueous solution of flat microparticles of tungsten oxide, exhibiting superior water dispersibility, with a hydrogel composed of a water&#8208;soluble polyaramide&#8208;based polymer hydrogelator. The resulting composite hydrogel exhibited uniform dispersion of tungsten oxide flat particles throughout the hydrogel matrix, supplementing the structure formed by the polymer hydrogelator. It maintained the gel&#8208;forming capability and thixotropic behavior inherent to the polymer hydrogelator while showcasing the electrochemical characteristics of tungsten oxide. With its spreadability and applicability to various electrode shapes, a composite hydrogel is presented as a potential spreadable gel electrode material.

         <title>Tridentate Lewis Acids Based on Tribenzotriquinacene Chalices</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dedicated to Professor Lothar Weber on the Occasion of his 80th Birthday.Chalice&#8208;type tridentate poly&#8208;Lewis acids (PLA) based on the C3v symmetric tribenzotriquinacene (TBTQ) have been synthesised and were studied regarding their complexation behaviour with (poly&#8208;)Lewis bases, that led to the synthesis of a tridentate base with a TBTQ backbone. The host&#8208;guest adducts were studied in more detail by DOSY NMR experiments to gain information about the size of the aggregates in solution.







Abstract
Chalice&#8208;shaped tridentate poly&#8208;Lewis acids (PLA) based on the tribenzotriquinacene (TBTQ) scaffold have been synthesised. Stannylation of the alkyne units, attached via phenyl&#8208;spacers to the benzhydrylic positions to the TBTQ scaffold, with Me2NSnMe3 afforded the trimethyltin substituted TBTQ derivative. Replacement of these tin functions with other elements resulted in rigid boron&#8208; and aluminium&#8208;functionalised PLAs. More flexible PLAs were obtained by hydrometallation reactions of the terminal alkyne groups of 4b,8b,12b&#8208;tris((ethynyl)phenyl)tribenzotriquinacene. The resulting poly&#8208;Lewis acids were tested for their acceptor abilities in host&#8208;guest experiments with suitable bases. Preliminary tests with pyridine led to the synthesis of a large tridentate base with three pyridyl groups attached to a TBTQ backbone. Complexation of this Lewis base with the PLAs resulted in the formation of aggregates, which were studied in solution in more detail by 1H DOSY NMR experiments regarding their size. Further experiments were performed with the tridentate bases 1,4,7&#8208;trimethyl&#8208;1,4,7&#8208;triazacyclononane and tris((dimethylphosphino)methyl)phenylsilane.

         <title>Telescoped Flow Synthesis of Azacyclic Scaffolds Exploiting the Chromoselective Photolysis of Vinyl Azides and Azirines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#8220;This study reports an efficient and readily scalable photochemical route into azirines and related photo&#8208;dimers that can be accessed from simple vinyl azides in a chromoselective manner. The value of these entities is demonstrated through flow&#8208;based conversions to highly substituted dihydropyrimidines and pyrimidines that are privileged scaffolds in medicinal and materials chemistry.&#8221;







Abstract
An efficient chromoselective photochemical process is presented for the synthesis of 2H&#8208;azirines and 1,3&#8208;diazabicylo[3.1.0]hex&#8208;3&#8208;enes from readily available vinyl azides. The method exploits continuous flow photochemistry to enable the safe consumption of the hazardous azide group and provides uniform irradiation using high&#8208;power LEDs at 365&#8211;450&#8197;nm. Additionally, a scaled telescoped process has been developed providing access to drug&#8208;like 1,6&#8208;dihydropyrimidines and pyrimidines via integrated ring&#8208;expansion and oxidation reactions. Given the prevalence of various azacyclic targets in pharmaceutical, agrochemical and materials applications it is anticipated that this methodology will enable further exploitations of these important scaffolds.

         <title>Spatially Resolved Multicolor Luminescence Tuning on the Single 1D Heterogeneous Microrod</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The spatially resolvable multicolored microrods have potential applications in many fields. However, achieving spatially resolved multi&#8208;color luminescence tuning on the microrod with a fixed composition remains a daunting challenge. Herein, a strategy is proposed that allows for the tuning of spatially resolved, multicolored upconversion (UC) luminescence (UCL) along a 1D heterogeneous microrod by modifying the pulse width of an external laser. NaYbF4:1%Ho is identified as an UCL color&#8208;adjustable material, exhibiting pulse width&#8208;dependent multicolored UCL, resulting in a significant regulation of the red/green (R/G) ratio from 0.1 to 10.3 as the pulse width is varied from 0.1 to 10 ms. Such variability can be ascribed to differences in the number of photons incident upon the microrod throughout the period necessary for the UC process to occur. Additionally, NaYbF4:1%Tm and NaYF4:20%Yb,1%Ho are employed as materials that emit blue and green light, respectively, with their UCL colors largely unaffected by changes in the pulse width. Subsequently, a tip&#8208;modified epitaxial growth method is utilized to integrate both UCL color&#8208;adjustable and non&#8208;adjustable segments within the same microrod. Comparing with single&#8208;color or fixed multi&#8208;color microrods, our developed multisegmented emissive color adjustable 1D heterogeneous microrods have unique optical characteristics and can carry more optical information.</dc:description>

         <title>Semi&#8208;interpenetrating polymer network anion exchange membranes based on quaternized polybenzoxazine and poly(vinyl alcohol&#8208;co&#8208;ethylene) for acid recovery by diffusion dialysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Acid recovery from acidic waste is a pressing issue in current times. Chemical methods for recovery are not economically feasible and require significant energy input to save the environment. This study reported a semi&#8208;interpenetrating polymer network (semi&#8208;IPN) anion exchange membranes (AEMs) for acid recovery by diffusion dialysis with excellent dimensional stability, high oxidation stability, good acid dialysis coefficient (UH+) and high separation factor (S). Semi&#8208;IPN AEMs are prepared by ring&#8208;open cross&#8208;linked quaternized polybenzoxazine (AQBZ) with poly(vinyl alcohol&#8208;co&#8208;ethylene), where AQBZ is obtained by Mannich reaction and Menshutkin reaction. Four proportions of semi&#8208;IPNs exhibit clear micro&#8208;phase separation, which is conducive to ion transport. The water uptake of the four semi&#8208;IPNs ranges from 14.2% to 19.2%, while the swelling ratio remains between 8.7% and 11.3%. These results indicate that the cross&#8208;linked structure in the designed semi&#8208;IPNs effectively control swelling and ensure dimensional stability. The thermal degradation temperature (Td5) of semi&#8208;IPN4:6 to semi&#8208;IPN7:3 varies from 309&#176;C to 289&#176;C, with an oxidation stability weight loss rate (WOX) ranging from 91.5% to 93.5%, demonstrating excellent thermal stability and oxidation stability. The semi&#8208;IPNs also show good UH+ values ranging from 11.9&#8208;16.3*10&#8208;3 m/h and high S values between 38.6 to 45.9, indicating the promising potential of the semi&#8208;IPNs.</dc:description>

         <title>Preparation and Optical and Electrochemical Properties of Boron (III) Octafluorosubphthalocyanines with One Triselenole and One Diselenet Ring</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Unsymmetric boron (III) subphthalocyanines with a triselenole ring or a diselenete ring and eight fluoro groups were prepared by the reaction of 5,6&#8208;dicyano&#8208;4,7&#8208;diethylbenzo&#8208;[1,2,3]triselenole and tetrafluorophthalonitrile with trichloroborane in xylene. The reaction was accompanied by a contraction of the triselenole ring to the diselenete ring. The substrate, dicyanobenzo[1,2,3]triselenole, was prepared by a new procedure via a photolytic demethylenation reaction of 3,7&#8208;diethyl[1,3]diselenolophthalonitrile using a 10 W white LED light. While triselenolosubphthalocyanine was treated by triphenylphosphine to give the diselenete derivative, the reaction of diselenetosubphthalocyanine with Woolion&#8217;s reagent produced the expanded triselenole ring. The diselenete derivative reacted with tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)platinum to yield the corresponding platinum complex with Se&#8208;Pt bonds. Q&#8208;band absorption for the products appeared at around &#955;max = 590 nm in the UV&#8208;vis spectrum and weak emission was observed at about &#955;e = 620 nm. When diselenetosubphthalocyanine was treated with pentachloro antimonate in dichloromethane or sodium metal in hexane/tetrahydrofuran, the solution showed strong ESR signals. The structures of model compounds were optimized using the DFT method with the Gaussian 09 program at the B3LYP/6&#8208;31G (d, p) level.</dc:description>

         <title>Functionalization of Alginate Hydrogels with a Multifunctional Peptide Supports Mesenchymal Stem Cell Adhesion and Reduces Bacterial Colonization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogels with cell adhesive moieties stand out as promising materials to enhance tissue healing and regeneration. Nonetheless, bacterial infections of the implants represent an unmet major concern. In the present work, we developed an alginate hydrogel modified with a multifunctional peptide containing the RGD cell adhesive motif in combination with an antibacterial peptide derived from the 1&#8208;11 region of lactoferrin (LF). The RGD&#8208;LF branched peptide was successfully anchored to the alginate backbone by carbodiimide chemistry, as demonstrated by 1H NMR and fluorescence measurements. The functionalized hydrogel presented desirable physicochemical properties (porosity, swelling and rheological behavior) to develop biomaterials for tissue engineering. The viability of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) on the peptide&#8208;functionalized hydrogels was excellent, with values higher than 85% at day 1, and higher than 95% after 14 days in culture. Moreover, the biological characterization demonstrated the ability of the hydrogels to significantly enhance ALP activity of MSCs as well as to decrease bacterial colonization of both Gram&#8208;positive and Gram&#8208;negative models. Such results prove the potential of the functionalized hydrogels as novel biomaterials for tissue engineering, simultaneously displaying cell adhesive activity and the capacity to prevent bacterial contamination, a dual bioactivity commonly not found for these types of hydrogels.</dc:description>

         <title>Binary and Ternary Deep Eutectic Solvents for Methylene Green Electropolymerization on Multiwalled Carbon Nanotubes: Optimization, Characterization and Application</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Choline chloride (ChCl) based binary and ternary deep eutectic solvents (DES) were evaluated for methylene green electropolymerization with oxalic acid (OA) and ethylene glycol (EG) as hydrogen bond donors. Binary DES ChCl:OA in molar ratios 1:1 and 2:1 and ChCl:EG 1:2 and ternary DES (tDES) in different molar ratios and percentages of water were evaluated. The highest polymer growth was in ChCl:OA:EG&#8208;tDES with added water, that had a lower viscosity and higher ionic conductivity when associated with HCl as dopant. This enhanced the formation of more cation radicals and, consequently, more polymer formation. The PMG/MWCNT/GCE&#8208;tDES sensor was successfully applied to the simultaneous determination of 5&#8208;aminosalicylic acid (5&#8208;ASA) and acetaminophen (APAP) by differential pulse voltammetry in the concentration range 2 &#181;M &#8208; 200 &#181;M, with detection limits of 0.37 &#181;M and 0.49 &#181;M for 5&#8208;ASA and APAP, respectively. The sensor demonstrated good repeatability, reproducibility and stability, and was successfully applied in pharmaceutical formulations.</dc:description>

         <title>High Pressure Promotes Binding of the Allosteric Inhibitor Zn2+&#8208;Cyclen in Crystals of Activated H&#8208;Ras</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 35, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
High pressure induces in the crystal of Ras(wt).Mg2+.GppNHp, which is in the dominant state 2 conformation, a transition to a transient state where the Zn2+&#8208;cyclen molecule, which is an allosteric inhibitor targeting the state 1, can bind.







Abstract
In this work, we experimentally investigate the potency of high pressure to drive a protein toward an excited state where an inhibitor targeted for this state can bind. Ras proteins are small GTPases cycling between active GTP&#8208;bound and inactive GDP&#8208;bound states. Various states of GTP&#8208;bound Ras in active conformation coexist in solution, amongst them, state 2 which binds to effectors, and state 1, weakly populated at ambient conditions, which has a low affinity for effectors. Zn2+&#8208;cyclen is an allosteric inhibitor of Ras protein, designed to bind specifically to the state 1. In H&#8208;Ras(wt).Mg2+.GppNHp crystals soaked with Zn2+&#8208;cyclen, no binding could be observed, as expected in the state 2 conformation which is the dominant state at ambient pressure. Interestingly, Zn2+&#8208;cyclen binding is observed at 500&#8197;MPa pressure, close to the nucleotide, in Ras protein that is driven by pressure to a state 1 conformer. The unknown binding mode of Zn2+&#8208;cyclen to H&#8208;Ras can thus be fully characterized in atomic details. As a more general conjunction from our study, high pressure x&#8208;ray crystallography turns out to be a powerful method to induce transitions allowing drug binding in proteins that are in low&#8208;populated conformations at ambient conditions, enabling the design of specific inhibitors.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 35, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We introduce a novel approach for the autonomous E/Z isomerization of pH&#8208;responsive hydrazones using trichloroacetic acid pulses. The use of this transient acid enables reversible switching of hydrazones without apparent fatigue even after 50 cycles. Kinetic analysis indicates a significant dependence of switching operations on the electronic properties of substituents.







Abstract
The chemically triggered reversible switching of pH&#8208;responsive hydrazones involves rotary motion&#8208;induced configurational changes, serving as a prototype for constructing an array of molecular machines. Typically, the configurational isomerization of such switches into two distinct forms (E/Z) occurs through the alteration of the pH the medium, achieved by successive additions of acid and base stimuli. However, this process results in intermittent operation due to the concomitant accumulation of salt after each cycle, limiting switching performance to only a few cycles (5&#8211;6). In this context, we introduce a novel strategy for the autonomous E/Z isomerization of hydrazones in acetonitrile using pulses of trichloroacetic acid as a chemical fuel. The use of this transient acid enabled reversible switching of hydrazones even after 50&#8197;cycles without causing significant fatigue. To test the broad viability of the fuel, a series of ortho/para&#8208;substituted hydrazones were synthesized and their switching performance was investigated. The analysis of kinetic data showed a strong dependency of switching operations including the lifetime of transient state, on the electronic properties of substituents. Finally, a distinct color change from yellow to orange due to reversible switching of the para&#8208;methoxy substituted hydrazone was employed for the creation of rewritable messages on commercially available paper.

         <title>A Single Terminal [NiII&#8722;OH] Catalyst for Direct Julia&#8208;Type Olefination and &#945;&#8208;Alkylation Involving Sulfones and Alcohols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 35, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single terminal [NiII&#8722;OH] catalyst is employed for direct Julia&#8208;type olefination of alcohols and &#945;&#8208;alkylation of sulfones using different reaction conditions. Detailed mechanistic studies, including DFT calculations, are undertaken to gain insight on the reaction pathway.







Abstract
A terminal [NiII&#8722;OH] complex 1, supported by triflamide&#8208;functionalized NHC ligands, showed divergent reactivity for the reaction of sulfone with alcohol, contingent on base concentration, temperature, and time. Julia&#8208;type olefination of alcohols with sulfones was achieved using one equiv. of base, whereas lowering base loading to 0.5&#8197;equiv. afforded &#945;&#8208;alkylated sulfones. Besides excellent substrate scope and selectivity, biologically active stilbene derivatives DMU&#8208;212, pinosylvin, resveratrol, and piceatannol were synthesized in high yield under Julia&#8208;type olefination conditions. An extensive array of controlled experiments and DFT calculations provide valuable insight on the reaction pathway.

         <title>Mechanisms of Mn(V)&#8208;Oxo to Mn(IV)&#8208;Oxyl Conversion: From Closed&#8208;Cubane Photosystem II to Mn(V) Catalysts and the Role of the Entering Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 35, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An Mn(V)&#8208;oxo complex with a trigonal bipyramidal structure can change its identity to an Mn(IV)&#8208;oxyl if it rearranges into a square pyramidal structure. An L ligand can trap the Mn(IV)&#8208;oxyl complex by coordinating to the square pyramidal structure, thereby making the resulting complex energetically more available to serve as a highly reactive catalyst in H2O oxidation and C&#8722;H bond functionalization.







Abstract
The low activation barrier for O&#8722;O coupling in the closed&#8208;cubane Oxygen&#8208;Evolving Centre (OEC) of Photosystem&#8197;II (PSII) requires water coordination with the Mn4 &#8242;dangler&#8242; ion in the Mn(V)&#8208;oxo fragment. This coordination transforms the Mn(V)&#8208;oxo complex into a more reactive Mn4(IV)&#8208;oxyl species, enhancing O&#8722;O coupling. This study explains the mechanism behind the coordination and indicates that in the most stable form of the OEC, the Mn4 fragment adopts a trigonal bipyramidal geometry but needs to transition to a square pyramidal form to be activated for O&#8722;O coupling. This transition stabilizes the Mn4 dxy orbital, enabling electron transfer from the oxo ligand to the dxy orbital, converting the oxo ligand into an oxyl species. The role of the water is to coordinate with the square pyramidal structure, reducing the energy gap between the oxo and oxyl forms, thereby lowering the activation energy for O&#8722;O coupling. This mechanism applies not only to the OEC system but also to other Mn(V)&#8208;based catalysts. For other catalysts, ligands such as OH&#8722; stabilize the Mn(IV)&#8208;oxyl species better than water, improving catalyst activation for reactions like C&#8722;H bond activation. This study is the first to explain the Mn(V)&#8208;oxo to Mn(IV)&#8208;oxyl conversion, providing a new foundation for Mn&#8208;based catalyst design.

         <title>A Magnesium Binding Site And The Anomeric Effect Regulate The Abiotic Redox Chemistry Of Nicotinamide Nucleotides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 35, June 20, 2024. </description>

NAD(H) and nicotinamide mononucleotide are capable of mediating model protometabolic electron transfer reactions, whereas simpler analogues are not. Early enzyme&#8208;like catalysts likely exploited molecules that possessed a nicotinamide, an anomeric position, and a Mg2+&#8208;binding site, as found in nicotinamide&#8208;containing molecules in biology today.







Abstract
Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) is a redox active molecule that is universally found in biology. Despite the importance and simplicity of this molecule, few reports exist that investigate which molecular features are important for the activity of this ribodinucleotide. By exploiting the nonenzymatic reduction and oxidation of NAD+ by pyruvate and methylene blue, respectively, we were able to identify key molecular features necessary for the intrinsic activity of NAD+ through kinetic analysis. Such features may explain how NAD+ could have been selected early during the emergence of life. Simpler molecules, such as nicotinamide, that lack an anomeric carbon are incapable of accepting electrons from pyruvate. The phosphate moiety inhibits activity in the absence of metal ions but facilitates activity at physiological pH and model prebiotic conditions by recruiting catalytic Mg2+. Reduction proceeds through consecutive single electron transfer events. Of the derivatives tested, including nicotinamide mononucleotide, nicotinamide riboside, 3&#8208;(aminocarbonyl)&#8208;1&#8208;(2,3&#8208;dihydroxypropyl)pyridinium, 1&#8208;methylnicotinamide, and nicotinamide, only NAD+ and nicotinamide mononucleotide would be capable of efficiently accepting and donating electrons within a nonenzymatic electron transport chain. The data are consistent with early metabolic chemistry exploiting NAD+ or nicotinamide mononucleotide and not simpler molecules.

         <title>Reactive Magnesium Nanoparticles to Perform Reactions in Suspension</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 35, June 20, 2024. </description>

Magnesium nanoparticles (10.3&#177;1.7&#8197;nm) are prepared in THF. Based on their high reactivity, they are used as a starting material in the liquid phase for reaction with sterically demanding ligands, resulting in C&#8722;C and Si&#8722;Si coupling reactions and five novel coordination compounds.







Abstract
Zerovalent magnesium (Mg(0)) nanoparticles are prepared in the liquid phase (THF) by reduction of MgBr2 either with lithium naphthalenide ([LiNaph]) or lithium biphenyl ([LiBP]). [LiBP]&#8208;driven reduction results in smaller Mg(0) nanoparticles (10.3&#177;1.7&#8197;nm) than [LiNaph]&#8208;driven reduction (28.5&#177;4&#8197;nm).

&lt;p&gt;Magnesium nanoparticles (10.3&#177;1.7&#8197;nm) are prepared in THF. Based on their high reactivity, they are used as a starting material in the liquid phase for reaction with sterically demanding ligands, resulting in C&#8722;C and Si&#8722;Si coupling reactions and five novel coordination compounds.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zerovalent magnesium (Mg(0)) nanoparticles are prepared in the liquid phase (THF) by reduction of MgBr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; either with lithium naphthalenide ([LiNaph]) or lithium biphenyl ([LiBP]). [LiBP]-driven reduction results in smaller Mg(0) nanoparticles (10.3&#177;1.7&#8197;nm) than [LiNaph]-driven reduction (28.5&#177;4&#8197;nm). The as-prepared Mg(0) nanoparticles are monocrystalline (&lt;i&gt;d&lt;sub&gt;101&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;=245&#177;5&#8197;pm) for both types of reduction. Their reactivity is probed by liquid-phase reaction (THF, toluene) in suspension near room temperature (20&#8211;120&#8201;&#176;C) with 1-bromoadamantane (AdBr), chlortriphenylsilane (Ph&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;SiCl), trichlorphenylsilane (PhSiCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), 9H-carbazole (Hcbz), 7-azaindole (Hai), 1,8-diaminonaphthalene (H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;nda) and N,N&#8217;-bis(&#945;-pyridyl)-2,6-diaminopyridine (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;tpda) as exemplary starting materials.

         <title>Push&#8208;Pull Bis&#8208;Norbornadienes for Solar Thermal Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 35, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Not only the production, but especially the storage of renewable energy is crucial for a sustainable society. A major challenge in the field of molecular solar thermal energy storage is designing visible light&#8208;absorbing photoswitches with long energy storage half&#8208;lives. Five novel visible light&#8208;absorbing norbornadiene dimers were prepared, with half&#8208;lives up to 23.0&#8197;hours, and high energy densities up to 379.3&#8197;kJ/kg.







Abstract
The norbornadiene/quadricyclane (NBD/QC) photoswitch pair represents a promising system for application in molecular solar thermal energy storage (MOST). Often, the NBD derivatives have very limited overlap with the solar spectrum, and substitution to redshift the absorption leads to a decrease in the gravimetric energy density. Dimeric systems mitigate this factor because two switches can &#8216;share&#8217; a substituent. Here, we present five new NBD dimers with red&#8208;shifted absorption spectra. One dimer features the most red&#8208;shifted absorption onset (539&#8197;nm) and a significantly red&#8208;shifted absorption maximum (404&#8197;nm) for NBD systems reported so far, without compromising thermal half&#8208;life. Promising properties for high&#8208;performance MOST applications are demonstrated, such as high absorption onsets reaching 539&#8197;nm, and energy densities of 379&#8197;kJ/kg, while still maintaining long half&#8208;lives of the metastable isomer, up to 23&#8197;hours at 25&#8201;&#176;C.

         <title>Calcium&#8208;Based Metal&#8208;Organic Framework: Detection and Idiosyncratic Removal of Copper by Nano&#8208;Particle Deposition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 35, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a cost&#8208;effective, environmentally benign calcium&#8208;MOF has been synthesized by microwave irradiation, having selective and reusable copper detection and removal capability from wastewater. This material, upon interaction with copper solution, undergoes a color change from yellow to reddish with a detection limit of&#8805;5&#8197;ppm and has a removal capacity of 484.2&#177;30&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1 that adsorbed copper as copper oxide nanoparticles.







Abstract
A novel calcium&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework (CaMOF@LSB) was designed and synthesized, exhibiting dual functionality for both selective detection and removal of Cu2+ ions from aqueous solutions. The framework&#8216;s stability, including solvent and pH variations, was established with notable thermal resilience. Colorimetric Cu2+ detection (&#8805;5&#8197;ppm) with a high capture capacity of 484.2&#8197;mg&#8201;g&#8722;1 by CaMOF@LSB places this material among the few that ensure efficient colorimetric detection and high removal capabilities of Cu2+ ions. Batch adsorption experiments revealed pH&#8208;dependent behavior and competitive interactions. Langmuir and pseudo&#8208;second&#8208;order kinetics models aptly described adsorption isotherms and kinetics, respectively. Thermodynamic assessments confirmed spontaneous and endothermic adsorption. Mechanistically, nanoparticle deposition contributes to the Cu2+ uptake. CaMOF@LSB also exhibited one of the best removal behaviour of Cu2+ by means of oxide formation on the surface. Regeneration of CaMOF@LSB was achieved by simple sonication in 0.1&#8197;M aqueous NaOH solution. The recyclability was also tested up to 5 cycles, and it exhibited a small decrease in adsorption capacity observed across the cycles. This research presents a promising avenue for addressing heavy metal pollution using metal&#8208;organic frameworks, thereby offering potential applications in water purification and environmental pollution monitoring and remediation.

The use of nickel&#8208;Chiraphos complex as a catalyst enables the synthesis of a variety of poly(1,4&#8208;phenylene) with a chiral side chain and provides new insights into the correlation with their helical structure through the measurement of CD spectra.







Abstract
Circular dichroism (CD) studies on poly(1,4&#8208;phenylene)s bearing a chiral side chain in the aggregated conditions were carried out. Little CD was observed in a solution form, while addition of a poor solvent into the polyphenylene solution induced aggregation and a strong CD was observed, accordingly. Applying the controlled degree of polymerization (DP) of poly(1,4&#8208;phenylene) in the use of bidentate diphosphine Chiraphos as a ligand for the nickel catalyst, the relationship of DP with CD strength was studied to reveal to show the highest CD at the DP=84 (gabs=ca. 2&#215;10&#8722;2). It was also found that the related aggregation was observed in good solvent 1,2&#8208;dichloroethane upon standing the solution at 4&#8201;&#176;C for 3&#8211;23&#8197;days to observe gabs=ca. 10&#8722;1. Studies on the substituent effect of poly(1,4&#8208;phenylene) suggested that CD behaviors were dependent on the type of non&#8208;chiral substituent on the aromatic ring as well as the side&#8208;chain chirality.

         <title>Redox&#8208;Active Triazole&#8208;Derived Mesoionic Imines with Ferrocenyl Substituents and their Metal Complexes: Directed Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding, Unusual C&#8722;H Activation and Ion&#8208;Pair Formation</title>

The properties of redox&#8208;active MIIs and their metal complexes are shown to be strongly influenced by non&#8208;covalent interactions such as hydrogen&#8208;bonding and ion&#8208;pair formation.







Abstract
We present herein the synthesis, characterization and complexation of ferrocenyl&#8208;substituted MIIs (mesoionic imines) and their metal complexes. In the free MIIs, strong hydrogen bonding interactions are observed between the imine&#8208;N and the C&#8722;H bonds of the ferrocenyl substituents both in the solid state and in solution. The influence of this hydrogen bonding is so strong that complexation of the MIIs with [IrCp*Cl2]2 yields unique six&#8208;membered iridacycles via C&#8722;H&#8208;activation of the corresponding C&#8722;H&#8208;site at the Fc&#8208;substituent and not the Ph&#8208;substituent. This result is in contrast to previous reports in which always a preferential C&#8722;H activation at the phenyl substituent is observed in competitive reactions in the presence of ferrocenyl substituents. The corresponding Ir complexes formed after in&#8208;situ halide exchange reaction exist in either [Ir&#8722;I] contact or as [Ir]+I&#8722; solvent separated ion&#8208;pairs depending on the solvent polarity. The iodide coordinated and solvent separated ion&#8208;pairs display drastically different physical properties. The TEP (Tolman&#8208;electronic&#8208;parameter) of these ligands was determined and lines up with previously reported MII&#8208;ligands. The redox properties were investigated by a combination of electrochemical and spectroelectrochemical methods. We show here how non&#8208;covalent interactions can have a drastic influence on the physical and chemical properties of these new class of compounds.

         <title>Ion Mobility Mass Spectrometry&#8208;Based Disaccharide Analysis of Glycosaminoglycans</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 35, June 20, 2024. </description>

Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are vital polysaccharides with complex structures. Disaccharide analysis, involving enzymatic depolymerization and liquid chromatography, is commonly used for their analysis. Here, direct infusion nESI ion mobility&#8208;mass spectrometry (IM&#8208;MS) is used to reduce measurement time from hours to minutes. Chemical modification and stable isotope&#8208;labelled standards enable quantification.







Abstract
Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are linear and acidic polysaccharides. They are ubiquitous molecules, which are involved in a wide range of biological processes. Despite being structurally simple at first glance, with a repeating backbone of alternating hexuronic acid and hexosamine dimers, GAGs display a highly complex structure, which predominantly results from their heterogeneous sulfation patterns. The commonly applied method for compositional analysis of all GAGs is &#8220;disaccharide analysis.&#8221; In this process, GAGs are enzymatically depolymerized into disaccharides, derivatized with a fluorescent label, and then analysed through liquid chromatography. The limiting factor in the high throughput analysis of GAG disaccharides is the time&#8208;consuming liquid chromatography. To address this limitation, we here utilized trapped ion mobility&#8208;mass spectrometry (TIM&#8208;MS) for the separation of isomeric GAG disaccharides, which reduces the measurement time from hours to a few minutes. A full set of disaccharides comprises twelve structures, with eight possessing isomers. Most disaccharides cannot be differentiated by TIM&#8208;MS in underivatized form. Therefore, we developed chemical modifications to reduce sample complexity and enhance differentiability. Quantification is performed using stable isotope labelled standards, which are easily available due to the nature of the performed modifications.

         <title>The Characterization of Multifaceted PREP1 Peptides Provides Insights into Correlations between Spectroscopic and Structural Properties of Amyloid&#8208;like Assemblies</title>

The characterization of an amyloid&#8208;like cross&#8208;&#946; peptide demonstrates that it can emit visible fluorescence with unusual redshifts via a Foster resonance electron transfer (FRET) phenomenon and highlights interesting correlations between structural and spectroscopic properties.







Abstract
The widespread ability of proteins and peptides to self&#8208;assemble by forming cross&#8208;&#946; structure is one of the most significant discoveries in structural biology. Intriguingly, the cross&#8208;&#946; association of proteins/peptides may generate intricate supramolecular architectures with uncommon spectroscopic properties. We have recently characterized self&#8208;assembled peptides extracted from the PREP1 protein that are endowed with interesting structural/spectroscopic properties. We here demonstrate that the green fluorescence emission of the peptide PREP1[117&#8208;132] (&#955;em ~520&#8197;nm), can be induced by excitation with UV radiation. The associated unusually large Stokes shift (&#916;&#955; ~150&#8197;nm) represents, to the best of our knowledge, the first evidence of an internal resonance energy transfer in amyloid&#8208;like structures, where the blue emission of some assemblies becomes the excitation radiation for others. Moreover, the characterization of PREP1[117&#8208;132] variants provides insights into the sequence/structure and structure/spectroscopic properties relationships. Our data suggests that the green fluorescence is plausibly associated with antiparallel &#946;&#8208;sheet states of the peptide whereas parallel &#946;&#8208;sheet assemblies are only endowed with blue fluorescence. Notably, the different PREP1[117&#8208;132] variants also form assemblies characterized by distinct morphologies. Indeed, the parent peptide and single mutants form compact but structured aggregates whereas most of the double mutants exhibit elongated and highly extended fibers.

         <title>On the Synthesis and Structure of &#8216;Naked&#8217; Ga(I) and In(I) Salts and the Surprising Stability of Simple Ga(I) and In(I) Salts in the Coordinating Solvents Ether and Acetonitrile</title>

Free Choices: In this work we introduce a route to solvent&#8208;free &#8216;naked&#8217; GaI and InI salts that may serve as starting materials to introduce GaI and InI to any desired system. Their markedly different structures are compared and analyzed in detail. In addition, the isolation of [M(OEt2)2]+ and [M(MeCN)2]+ (M=Ga, In) complex salts and the limits of stability of MI against disproportionation are explored.







Abstract
In this work, we present the solid&#8208;state structures of solvent&#8208;free Ga[pf] and In[pf] salts ([pf]&#8722;=[Al(ORF)4]&#8722;; RF=C(CF3)3), which are very rare examples of salts with truly &#8216;naked&#8217; metal cations. Both salts may serve as starting materials for subvalent gallium and indium chemistry with very weakly coordinating ligands providing the freedom of choice for solvents and ligands for the future. On the other hand, we report and rationalize the formation and isolation of [M(OEt2)2][pf] and [M(MeCN)2][pf] (M=Ga, In), underlining the surprising stability of these subvalent group 13&#8197;M+ ions against disproportionation. Unexpectedly, dicoordinate and carbene analogous [M(L)2]+ ions with the [pf]&#8722; counterion are stable in L=acetonitrile and diethyl ether at room temperature, opening up possible applications for example in organic synthesis and catalysis.

         <title>Optical Upconversion in Mononuclear Lanthanide Co&#8208;Crystal Assemblies</title>

Co&#8208;crystal assemblies of mononuclear Yb3+ and Pr3+ complexes enable cooperative sensitization upconversion and energy transfer upconversion from Pr3+ at room temperature. This is the first example of Pr3+ upconversion luminescence at the molecular dimension which enriches the research in the field of upconversion luminescence with lanthanide complexes.







Abstract
In this work, we developed two kinds of co&#8208;crystal assemblies systems, consisting of discrete mononuclear Yb3+ and Er3+ and mononuclear Yb3+ and Pr3+, which can achieve Er3+ and Pr3+ upconversion luminescence, respectively, by Yb3+ sensitization under 980&#8197;nm excitation. The structure and composition of two co&#8208;crystal assemblies were determined by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. By investigation of the series of two assemblies, respectively, it is found that the strongest upconversion luminescence is both obtained when the molar ratio of Yb3+ and Ln3+ (Ln=Er or Pr) is 1&#8201;:&#8201;1. The energy transfer mechanism of Er3+ assemblies is determined as energy transfer upconversion, while that of Pr3+ assemblies is determined as energy transfer upconversion and cooperative sensitization upconversion. This is the first example of Pr3+ upconversion luminescence at the molecular dimension at room temperature, which enriches the research in the field of upconversion luminescence with lanthanide complexes.

         <title>Thermal Equilibrium Between Quinoid/Biradical Forms Enhancing Electrochemical Amphotericity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 35, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An open&#8208;shell biradical form, which is generated by a thermal equilibrium with the closed&#8208;shell quinoid form in solution, exhibits electrochemical amphotericity. For the biradicals, since two radical units behave independently upon electron transfer, both oxidation and reduction proceed in two&#8208;electron processes. As a result, these biradicals show an exceptionally small difference between second oxidation and second reduction potentials.







Abstract
Upon dibenzo annulation on Thiele's hydrocarbon (tetraphenyl&#8208;p&#8208;quinodimethane), the quinoid form and the biradical form adopt quite different geometries, and thus are no longer resonance structures. When these two forms can interconvert rapidly due to the small energy barrier (&#916;G&#8800;), the equilibrated mixture contains both forms in a ratio that is determined by the energy difference (&#916;Go) between the two forms. For a series of tetrakis[5&#8208;(4&#8208;methoxyphenyl)&#8208;2&#8208;thienyl]&#8208;substituted derivatives, the more stable quinoid form and the metastable biradical form coexist in solution as an equilibrated mixture due to small &#916;G&#8800; (&lt;15&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1) and &#916;Go (1&#8211;4&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1), in which the proportion of the two forms can be regulated by temperature. Since the biradical form can undergo easy two&#8208;electron (2e) oxidation to the corresponding dications as well as easy 2e&#8208;reduction to the dianions, it exhibits very high electrochemical amphotericity. This character with a record&#8208;small span for not only the first oxidation and reduction potentials but also the second those, [E1sum&#8776;E2sum=E2ox&#8722;E2red=ca. 1.4&#8197;V], is attained through thermally enhanced conversion to the biradical form from the corresponding quinoid form, the latter of which is less amphoteric due to higher Eox and lower Ered values.

         <title>Radiation&#8208;Induced Defects in Uranyl Trinitrate Solids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 35, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Uranyl trinitrate solid&#8208;state materials are exposed to gamma radiation and characterized by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and Raman spectroscopy. Density functional theory calculations confirm the spectroscopic signatures and the presence of a nitrate radical bound in a monodentate fashion to the uranyl cation. Including alkali cations in the theoretic models is crucial to accurate calculation of the g&#8208;values.







Abstract
Actinides are inherently radioactive; thus, ionizing radiation is emitted by these elements can have profound effects on its surrounding chemical environment through the formation of free radical species. While previous work has noted that the presence of free radicals in the system impacts the redox state of the actinides, there is little atomistic understanding of how these metal cations interact with free radicals. Herein, we explore the effects of radiation (UV and &#947;) on three U(VI) trinitrate complexes, M[UO2(NO3)3] (where M=K+, Rb+, Cs+), and their respective nitrate salts in the solid state via electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and Raman spectroscopy paired with Density Functional Theory (DFT) methods. We find that the alkali salts form nitrate radicals under UV and &#947; irradiation, but also note the presence of additional degradation products. M[UO2(NO3)3] solids also form nitrate radicals and additional DFT calculations indicate the species corresponds to a change from the bidentate bound nitrate anion into a monodentate NO3&#8226; radical. Computational studies also highlight the need to include the second sphere coordination environment around the [UO2(NO3)3]0,1 species to gain agreement between the experimental and predicted EPR signatures.

         <title>Aromaticity in Semi&#8208;Condensed Figure&#8208;Eight Molecules</title>

         <dc:description>
Aromaticity in the illustrated semi&#8208;condensed figure&#8208;eight molecule, a [5]helicene&#8208;bridged (1,4)cyclophane, is dominated by a (semi&#8208;)local character with some additional minor global character, as allowed by the small torsion angle along the single bonds.







Abstract
Electron delocalization and aromaticity was comparatively evaluated in recently synthesized figure&#8208;eight molecules made of two condensed U&#8208;shaped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon moieties connected either by two single bonds or by two para&#8208;phenylene groups. The selected examples include molecules that incorporate eight&#8208;membered and sixteen&#8208;membered rings, as well as a doubly [5]helicene&#8208;bridged (1,4)cyclophane. We probe whether some electron delocalization could occur through the stereogenic single bonds in these molecules: Is aromaticity purely (semi&#8208;)local, or possibly also global in these molecules? It was concluded that the situation can go from a purely (semi&#8208;)local character when the dihedral angle at the connecting single bonds is large, such as in biphenyl, to a predominantly (semi&#8208;)local character with a minor global contribution when the dihedral angle is small, such as in the para&#8208;phenylene connectors of the [5] helicene&#8208;bridged cyclophane.

Periodic acid is the sole oxidizing agent, yielding 1,2&#8208;diketones mechanochemically from diverse alkynes, effectively emulating ozone&#8216;s reactivity. It is environmentally friendly, cost&#8208;effective, and shows tolerance of different groups.

Utilizing periodic acid as an environmentally benign oxidizing agent, this study introduces a novel mechanochemical method that mimics ozonolysis to convert internal alkynes into 1,2&#8208;diketones, showcasing effective emulation of ozone&#8216;s reactivity. Notably, this oxidation occurs at room temperature in aerobic conditions, eliminating the need for toxic transition metals, hazardous oxidants, or expensive solvents. Through control experiments validating the mechanism, substantial evidence supports a concerted reaction pathway. This progress marks a significant stride toward cleaner and more efficient chemical synthesis, mitigating the environmental impact of conventional processes. Assessing the green chemistry metrics in both solvent&#8208;free and previously reported solvent&#8208;based methods, our eco&#8208;friendly protocol demonstrates an E&#8208;factor of 7.40, a 51.7&#8201;% atom economy, a 45.5&#8201;% atom efficiency, 100&#8201;% carbon efficiency, and 11.9&#8201;% reaction mass efficiency when solvents are not used.

         <title>A Structure&#8208;Activity Investigation of the Fungal Metabolite (&#8722;)&#8208;TAN&#8208;2483B: Inhibition of Bruton's Tyrosine Kinase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 35, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
(&#8722;)&#8208;TAN&#8208;2483B is a fungal metabolite that inhibits Bruton's Tyrosine Kinase (Btk), showing immunomodulatory potential. Docking revealed binding modes for (&#8722;)&#8208;TAN&#8208;2483B and analogues in the Btk active site. Newly synthesised analogues were tested, corroborating docking observations and highlighting the requirements for Btk inhibition and selectivity. These findings inform the development of new Btk inhibitors for leukemia and immune disorders.







Abstract
The natural product (&#8722;)&#8208;TAN&#8208;2483B is a fungal secondary metabolite which displays promising anti&#8208;cancer and immunomodulatory activity. Our previous syntheses of (&#8722;)&#8208;TAN&#8208;2483B and sidechain analogues uncovered inhibitory activity against Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk), an established drug target for various leukaemia and immunological diseases. A structure&#8208;based computational study using ensemble docking and molecular dynamics was performed to determine plausible binding modes for (&#8722;)&#8208;TAN&#8208;2483B and analogues in the Btk binding site. These hypotheses guided the design of new analogues which were synthesised and their inhibitory activities determined, providing insights into the structural determinants of the furopyranone scaffold that confer both activity and selectivity for Btk. These findings offer new perspectives for generating optimised (&#8722;)&#8208;TAN&#8208;2483B&#8208;based kinase inhibitors for the treatment of leukaemia and immunological diseases.

         <title>Benzoselenadiazole&#8208;Functionalized H&#8208;Bonded Arylamide Foldamers: Solvent&#8208;Responsive Properties and Helix Self&#8208;Assembly Directed by Chalcogen Bonding in Solid State</title>

A novel kind of benzoselenadiazole&#8208;functionalized H&#8208;bonded arylamide foldamers with solvent&#8208;responsive properties have been synthesized. In dichloromethane or dimethyl sulfoxide solvents, the molecules exhibit meniscus or linear structures, respectively, which can be attributed to the unique intramolecular hydrogen bonding behavior. The crystal structures reveal that further assembly of monomers was induced by effective intermolecular Se&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;N interaction. And with the synergistic induction of intramolecular hydrogen bonds and intermolecular chalcogen bonds, supramolecular linear and double helices structures were constructed in solid state.







Abstract
In this study, a series of H&#8208;bonded arylamide foldamers bearing benzoselenadiazole ends with solvent&#8208;responsive properties have been synthesized. In dichloromethane or dimethyl sulfoxide solvents, the molecules exhibit meniscus or linear structures, respectively, which can be attributed to the unique intramolecular hydrogen bonding behavior evidenced by 1D 1H NMR and 2D NOESY spectra. UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy experiments show that the absorption wavelength of H&#8208;bonded arylamide foldamers are significantly red&#8208;shifted due to the presence of benzoselenadiazole group. In addition, the crystal structures reveal that effective intermolecular dual Se&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;N interactions between benzoselenadiazole groups induce further assembly of the monomers. Remarkably, supramolecular linear and double helices structures are constructed under the synergistic induction of intramolecular hydrogen bonding and intermolecular chalcogen bonding. Additionally, 2D DOSY diffusion spectra and theoretical modelling based on density functional theory (DFT) are performed to explore the persistence of intermolecular Se&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;N interactions beyond the crystalline state.

         <title>Indole C5&#8208;Selective Bromination of Indolo[2,3&#8208;a]quinolizidine Alkaloids via In Situ&#8208;Generated Indoline Intermediate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 35, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The indole C5&#8208;selective bromination of indolo[2,3&#8208;a]quinolizidine alkaloids by adding nearly equimolar amounts of Br3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;PyH and HCl in MeOH is disclosed. The resulting reaction plausibly proceeds through an indoline intermediate by the nucleophilic addition of MeOH to the C3&#8208;brominated indolenine intermediate. These simple, mild, and metal&#8208;free conditions are suitable for late&#8208;stage chemical conversions in total synthesis and medicinal chemistry.







Abstract
There are many indole alkaloids that contain diverse functional groups attached to the benzene ring on the indole core. Promising biological activities of these alkaloids have been reported. Herein, we report the indole C5&#8208;selective bromination of indolo[2,3&#8208;a]quinolizidine alkaloids by adding nearly equimolar amounts of Br3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;PyH and HCl in MeOH. The resulting reaction plausibly proceeds through an indoline intermediate by the nucleophilic addition of MeOH to the C3&#8208;brominated indolenine intermediate. Data support the intermediacy of a C3&#8208;, C5&#8208;dibrominated indolenine intermediate as a brominating agent. These conditions demonstrate excellent selectivity for indole C5 bromination of natural products and their derivatives. Thus, these simple, mild, and metal&#8208;free conditions allow for selective, late&#8208;stage bromination followed by further chemical modifications. The utility of the brominated product prepared from naturally occurring yohimbine was demonstrated through various derivatizations, including a bioinspired heterodimerization reaction.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Meso&lt;/i&gt;-nitrile oxide group in 1,7-Diphenyl-containing BODIPYs can be involved in highly unusual [3+2] intramolecular cycloaddition reaction with the formation of the dihydrobenzo[&lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;]isoxazole-containing BODIPYs. Oxidation of these compounds results in the formation of unprecedented either benzisoxazole- or benzo[&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;]azepine-fused fully conjugated NIR absorbing BODIPYs. The photophysical properties and electronic structures of the target compounds were studied by an array of experimental and theoretical methods.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Generation, Characterization and Reactivity of a High&#8208;Valent Mononuclear Cobalt(IV)&#8722;Diazide Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 35, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of azide to a Co(IV)&#8722;dinitrate complex results in the replacement of both nitrate ligands to form a Co(IV)&#8722;diazide species. The azide interacts with Co(IV) more strongly than nitrate, leading to the modulation of the Co(IV) electronic structure and the Co(IV/III) redox potential. Together with the basicity of azide, Co(IV)&#8722;diazide has a higher driving force than Co(IV)&#8722;dinitrate species to activate substrate C&#8722;H and O&#8722;H bonds.







Abstract
High&#8208;valent Fe(IV)=O intermediates of metalloenzymes have inspired numerous efforts to generate synthetic analogs to mimic and understand their substrate oxidation reactivities. However, high&#8208;valent M(IV) complexes of late transition metals are rare. We have recently reported a novel Co(IV)&#8722;dinitrate complex (1&#8208;NO3) that activates sp3 C&#8722;H bonds up to 87&#8197;kcal/mol. In this work, we have shown that the nitrate ligands in 1&#8208;NO3 can be replaced by azide, a more basic coordinating base, resulting in the formation of a more potent Co(IV)&#8722;diazide species (1&#8208;N3) that reacts with substrates (hydrocarbons and phenols) at faster rate constants and activates stronger C&#8722;H bonds than the parent complex 1&#8208;NO3. We have characterized 1&#8208;N3 employing a combination of spectroscopic and computational approaches. Our results clearly show that the coordination of azide leads to the modulation of the Co(IV) electronic structure and the Co(IV/III) redox potential. Together with the higher basicity of azide, these thermodynamic parameters contribute to the higher driving forces of 1&#8208;N3 than 1&#8208;NO3 for C&#8722;H bond activation. Our discoveries are thus insightful for designing more reactive bio&#8208;inspired high&#8208;valent late transition metal complexes for activating inert aliphatic hydrocarbons.

         <title>A Triply Linked Copper(III) Dicarbacorrole Dimer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 35, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#946;&#8208;&#946;, meso&#8208;meso, &#946;&#8208;&#946; triply linked dicarbacorrole dimer was synthesized from a meso&#8208;meso singly linked dicarbacorrole dimer precursor via an oxidative fusion reaction. The dimer is capable of stabilizing high&#8208;valent Cu(III) cations and show distinct NIR absorptions.







Abstract
A triply linked dicarbacorrole dimer (7) was synthesized from a new meso&#8208;meso singly linked dicarbacorrole dimer precursor (6) via an oxidative fusion reaction by 2,3&#8208;dichloro&#8208;5,6&#8208;dicyano&#8208;p&#8208;benzoquinone (DDQ) in the presence of trifluoromethanesulfonic acid (TfOH). Single crystal X&#8208;ray structure of 7 adopts a flat conformation with a length as ca. 15.946&#8197;&#197; and a width as 6.903&#8197;&#197;, which can be regarded as a short carbaporphyrinoid tape. Two coordinated Cu ions keeps the +3 oxidation state in 7, as confirmed by NMR spectroscopy, single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). This is in sharp contrast to the Osuka's triply linked tetrapyrrolic corrole dimers, where the inner 3NH form is not stable and thus can only act as a divalent ligand. Due to the non&#8208;aromatic nature of dicarbacorrole macrocycle, the largely decreased HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap and red&#8208;shifted absorption of 7 are best ascribed to the strong electronic interaction between two dipyrromethene&#8208;type chromophores. To our knowledge, this is the first fully fused carbaporphyrinoid dimer with &#946;&#8208;&#946;, meso&#8208;meso, &#946;&#8208;&#946; triply linkages prepared to date.

         <title>Energy Barriers and Gap Between Two Excited States in a Dual&#8208;Emissive Carborane</title>

It is hard to experimentally measure both the energy barriers and gap between two excited states of a compound. In this paper, we designed 1&#8208;(pyren&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;yl)&#8208;9,12&#8208;di(p&#8208;tolyl)&#8208;o&#8208;carborane, the ratio of its LE and ICT emission bands is controlled by thermodynamics at higher temperatures and by kinetics at lower temperatures, and thus the energy barriers and gap between the two excited states can be experimentally estimated.







Abstract
A thorough understanding of the internal conversion process between excited states is important for the designing of ideal multiple&#8208;emissive materials. However, it is hard to experimentally measure both the energy barriers and gaps between the excited states of a compound. For a long time, it is dubious if what was measured is the energy gap or barrier between two excited states. In this paper, we designed 1&#8208;(pyren&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;yl)&#8208;9,12&#8208;di(p&#8208;tolyl)&#8208;o&#8208;carborane (2), which shows dual&#8208;emission in solution. Temperature&#8208;dependent fluorescence measurements show that the two emission bands in hexane are corresponding to two different excited states. The ratio of the emission bands is controlled by thermodynamics at higher temperatures and by kinetics at lower temperatures. Thus, the energy barrier and energy gaps between the two excited states of 2 can be experimentally estimated.

         <title>A Bis&#8208;Porphyrin Cavitand Breathing&#8208;In to Constrict Bucky Balls</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 35, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bis&#8208;Ni(II)porphyrin cavitand has been shown to undergo an elastic, breathing mechanism to accommodate incoming fullerenes. The binding is seen to depend on both the electronic and steric factors imposed by the porphyrin faces; additionally, the pillars connecting the two porphyrins undergo facile twisting on binding fullerene, demonstrating a constriction behaviour.







Abstract
Bis&#8208;porphyrin cages have long been exploited to bind fullerenes selectively for various applications. The major consideration for an effective binding here had been the cavity size. Herein, we structurally demonstrate that a bis&#8208;Ni&#8722;porphyrin cavitand having even a smaller cavity can host a larger fullerene by a breathing and ruffling mechanism. It has also been shown that both the electronic and steric influence at the meso&#8208; positions of the porphyrin in fact dictate the binding character. The smaller cavity of 2NiD exhibits preferential binding for C70 over C60; however, surprisingly, the larger cavities in 2HD and 2NiTD display stronger affinities for C60 over the larger fullerene. We show here that the structural elasticity infused both by the metalloporphyrins and the connecting bridges play a major role in directing the binding. These conclusions have adequately been supported by structural and spectroscopic investigations. Additionally, the suitability of one of the conjugates for photoinduced charge&#8208;separation has been investigated using ultrafast transient absorption measurements. 2NiD&#8835;C60 has a charge separation timescale of ~0.8&#8197;ps, while charge recombination occurs at a longer timescale of ~920&#8197;ps.

The smaller cavity of &lt;b&gt;2NiD&lt;/b&gt; exhibits preferential binding for C&lt;sub&gt;70&lt;/sub&gt; over C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;; however, surprisingly, the larger cavities in &lt;b&gt;2HD&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;2NiTD&lt;/b&gt; display stronger affinities for C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; over the larger fullerene. We show here that the structural elasticity infused both by the metalloporphyrins and the connecting bridges play a major role in directing the binding. These conclusions have adequately been supported by structural and spectroscopic investigations. Additionally, the suitability of one of the conjugates for photoinduced charge-separation has been investigated using ultrafast transient absorption measurements. &lt;b&gt;2NiD&#8835;C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; has a charge separation timescale of ~0.8&#8197;ps, while charge recombination occurs at a longer timescale of ~920&#8197;ps.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Fluorescence and Lifetime Imaging of Endoplasmic Reticulum Polarity Change During Ferroptosis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 35, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An endoplasmic reticulum (ER)&#8208;targeted and polarity&#8208;sensitive fluorescent probe, SBD&#8722;CH, was developed. By combining confocal laser scanning microscopy with fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy, it revealed an increased and more dispersed ER polarity during ferroptosis. The common ferroptosis inhibitor Fer&#8208;1 could only partially reduce the polarity of ER, but did not restore the dispersion loss of ER membrane.







Abstract
As a new form of regulated cell death, ferroptosis is closely related to various diseases. Tracing ferroptosis related biological behavior is helpful to better understand this process and its related biology. Considering that ferroptosis is featured with remarkable lipid peroxidation which can easily change the membranes&#8217; compositions and structures, it is potential to detect intracellular environmental changes for direct assessment of ferroptosis. In view of the close relationship between endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and ferroptosis, we designed an ER&#8208;targeted and polarity&#8208;sensitive fluorescent probe SBD&#8722;CH, which has superior photostability and can respond to polarity with high selectivity without the affection of viscosity. SBD&#8722;CH can monitor the trend of ER polarity during ferroptosis by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), and analyze the distribution of polarity in ferroptosis by fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM). During Erastin induced ferroptosis, the polarity of ER in HT&#8208;1080 cells increased and the polarity distribution in ER was more dispersed. Our work provides an effective strategy for evaluating the process of ferroptosis by monitoring the changes of ER polarity.

         <title>Novel Types of Phyllobilins in a Fern &#8208; Molecular Reporters of the Evolution of Chlorophyll Breakdown in the Paleozoic Era</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 35, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bilin&#8208;type chlorophyll&#8208;catabolites in de&#8208;greened leaves of the bracken fern and of some angiosperms are molecular reporters of a common basic pathway of Chl&#8208;breakdown in two widely different plant divisions. However, the Chl&#8208;catabolite structures were revealed to also differ in striking ways, shedding light on the evolution of specific Chl&#8208;breakdown strategies in early land plants that existed in the Paleozoic, as progenitors of the extant flora.







Abstract
Breakdown of chlorophyll (Chl), as studied in angiosperms, follows the pheophorbide a oxygenase/phyllobilin (PaO/PB) pathway, furnishing linear tetrapyrroles, named phyllobilins (PBs). In an investigation with fern leaves we have discovered iso&#8208;phyllobilanones (iPBs) with an intriguingly rearranged and oxidized carbon skeleton. We report here a key second group of iPBs from the fern and on their structure analysis. Previously, these additional Chl&#8208;catabolites escaped their characterization, since they exist in aqueous media as mixtures of equilibrating isomers. However, their chemical dehydration furnished stable iPB&#8208;derivatives that allowed the delineation of the enigmatic structures and chemistry of the original natural catabolites. The structures of all fern&#8208;iPBs reflect the early core steps of a PaO/PB&#8208;type pathway and the PB&#8208;to&#8208;iPB carbon skeleton rearrangement. A striking further degradative chemical ring&#8208;cleavage was observed, proposed to consume singlet molecular oxygen (1O2). Hence, Chl&#8208;catabolites may play a novel active role in detoxifying cellular 1O2. The critical deviations from the PaO/PB pathway, found in the fern, reflect evolutionary developments of Chl&#8208;breakdown in the green plants in the Paleozoic era.

         <title>Alared: Solvatochromic and Fluorogenic Red Amino Acid for Ratiometric Live&#8208;Cell Imaging of Bioactive Peptides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 35, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here we introduce Alared, solvatochromic and fluorogenic red fluorescent amino acid which can be easily integrated into bioactive peptides using classical solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis. The emission color and the quantum yield of Alared vary in a broad range depending on the peptide microenvironment, making Alared a powerful reporter of biomolecular interactions in living cells.







Abstract
To fill the need for environmentally sensitive fluorescent unnatural amino acids able to operate in the red region of the spectrum, we have designed and synthesized Alared, a red solvatochromic and fluorogenic amino acid derived from the Nile Red chromophore. The new unnatural amino acid can be easily integrated into bioactive peptides using classical solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis. The fluorescence quantum yield and the emission maximum of Alared&#8208;labeled peptides vary in a broad range depending on the peptide's environment, making Alared a powerful reporter of biomolecular interactions. Due to its red&#8208;shifted absorption and emission spectra, Alared&#8208;labeled peptides could be followed in living cells with minimal interference from cellular autofluorescence. Using ratiometric fluorescence microscopy, we were able to track the fate of the Alared&#8208;labeled peptide agonists of the apelin G protein&#8208;coupled receptor upon receptor activation and internalization. Due to its color&#8208;shifting environmentally sensitive emission, Alared allowed for distinguishing the fractions of peptides that are specifically bound to the receptor or unspecifically bound to different cellular membranes.

         <title>Azophosphines: Synthesis, Structure and Coordination Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 35, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Functional groups are fundamentally important for synthetic chemists and enable rational understanding of reactivity. Azophosphines are underexplored compounds that are heavier congeners of triazenes, and we have devised a general synthesis to this family of compounds. The availability of the phosphorus lone pair enabled them to be used as ligands that can bind in different coordination modes in a controlled manner.







Abstract
The conceptual replacement of nitrogen with phosphorus in common organic functional groups unlocks new properties and reactivity. The phosphorus&#8208;containing analogues of triazenes are underexplored but offer great potential as flexible and small bite&#8208;angle ligands. This manuscript explores the synthesis and characterisation of a family of air&#8208;stable azophosphine&#8208;borane complexes, and their subsequent deprotection to the free azophosphines. These compounds are structurally characterised, both experimentally and computationally, and highlight the availability of the phosphorus lone pair for coordination. This is confirmed by demonstrating that neutral azophosphines can act as ligands in Ru complexes, and can coordinate as monodentate or bidentate ligands in a controlled manner, in contrast to their nitrogen analogues.

A ray of sunlight absorbed by a solution will be stored and later released as heat energy. The norbornadiene derivatives designed and studied in this work swirl around the flask like autumn leaves symbolizing the cyclic nature of molecular solar thermal energy storage; and as leaves turn red in autumn, so the absorption of these molecular switches is redshifted. The natural setting reflects the ultimate goal of providing a new, renewable way of storing energy, thereby protecting the environment and the climate.

New perspectives in GaI and InI chemistry: The salts of &#8216;naked&#8217; M+ (M = Ga, In) ions with a weakly coordinating, fluorinated alkoxyaluminate anion have been isolated, and the stability of M+ with this anion in the coordinating solvents acetonitrile and diethyl ether has been demonstrated. The results will allow the coordination chemistry of M+ with weak ligands and the reactivity of M+ in standard solvents to be examined. The cover portrays these new possibilities as M+ hikers in a mysterious nighttime landscape. More information can be found in the Research Article by I. Krossing and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202400897).

         <title>A Comprehensive Review on Reductive Recycling of Cathode Materials of Spent Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 35, June 20, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review aims to digest lithium&#8208;ion battery cathode material recycling and regeneration methods based on the reduction reaction mechanism. It discusses several reductants commonly used in the recycling process, and introduces some recently proposed direct regeneration methods. Finally, it concludes and outlooks the battery recycling based on the reduction reaction mechanism.







Abstract
The prosperity of the lithium&#8208;ion battery market is inevitably accompanied by the depletion of corresponding resources and the accumulation of spent batteries in a dialectical manner. Spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries are harboring the characteristics of hazardous waste and high&#8208;value resources, so efficient recycling is of great significance. The cathode material is considered as an interesting target for repurposing. Despite some important reviews give commendable emphasis to recycling technologies, there is still a dearth of exploration of recycling mechanisms. This deficiency of awareness highlights the need for further research and development in this area. This review aims to systematically review and thoroughly discuss the reduction reaction mechanism of each method regarding different cathode materials. And systematically digest the selection of reducing agent and the effect of reduction reaction on material regeneration are systematically digested, as well as the impact of the reduction reaction on the regeneration of materials. This review emphasizes the importance of balancing efficiency, economic and environmental benefits in reuse technologies. Finally, the review proposes an outlook on the opportunities and challenges facing the reuse of key materials for next&#8208;generation spent batteries aimed at promoting the green and sustainable development of lithium&#8208;ion batteries, circular economy and ecological balance.

         <title>Post&#8208;synthetic Metalation on the Ionic TiO2 Surface to Enhance Metal&#8208;CO2 Interaction During Photochemical CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Post&#8208;Modification for CO2 Reduction. The ionic surface of a polyoxometalate stabilized 6&#8197;nm photoactive TiO2 nanocore allows post&#8208;synthetic copper exchange on the surface of the nanoparticles. Copper(II) ions on the surface show enhanced CO2 adsorption and act as the reactive center to transfer photoexcited electrons to stabilize the M&#8208;[CO2]&#8722; intermediate, detected by quasi&#8208;in&#8208;situ Raman and labeling study, which has earlier been speculated as the reactive species to direct the selectivity of photochemical CO2 reduction.







Abstract
During the photochemical CO2 reduction reaction, CO2 adsorption on the catalyst's surface is a crucial step where the binding mode of the [metal&#8208;CO2] adduct directs the product selectivity and efficiency. Herein, an ionic TiO2 nanostructure stabilized by polyoxometalates (POM), ([POM]x@TiO2), is prepared and the sodium counter ions present on the surface to balance the POMs&#8217; charge are replaced with copper(II) ions, (Cux[POM]@TiO2). The microscopic and spectroscopic studies affirm the copper exchange without altering the TiO2 core and weak coordination of copper (II) ions to the POMs&#8217; surface. Band structure analysis suggests the photo&#8208;harvesting efficiency of the TiO2 core with the conduction band edge higher than the reduction potential of CuII/I and multi&#8208;electron CO2 reduction potentials. Photochemical CO2 reduction with Cux[POM]@TiO2 results in 30&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;gcat.&#8722;1 CO (79&#8201;%) and 8&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;gcat&#8722;1 of CH4 (21&#8201;%). Quasi&#8208;in&#8208;situ Raman study provides evidence in support of CO2 adsorption on the Cux[POM]@TiO2 surface. 13C and D2O labeling studies affirm the {Cu&#8208;[CO2]&#8722;} adduct formation. Despite the photo&#8208;harvesting ability of Nax[POM]@TiO2 itself, the poor CO2 adsorption ability of sodium ions highlights the crucial role of copper ion CO2 photo&#8208;reduction.

     alt="Post-synthetic Metalation on the Ionic TiO2 Surface to Enhance Metal-CO2 Interaction During Photochemical CO2 Reduction"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Post-Modification for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Reduction&lt;/b&gt;. The ionic surface of a polyoxometalate stabilized 6&#8197;nm photoactive TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanocore allows post-synthetic copper exchange on the surface of the nanoparticles. Copper(II) ions on the surface show enhanced CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption and act as the reactive center to transfer photoexcited electrons to stabilize the M-[CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; intermediate, detected by quasi-in-situ Raman and labeling study, which has earlier been speculated as the reactive species to direct the selectivity of photochemical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the photochemical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction reaction, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption on the catalyst's surface is a crucial step where the binding mode of the [metal-CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] adduct directs the product selectivity and efficiency. Herein, an ionic TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanostructure stabilized by polyoxometalates (POM), ([POM]&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;@TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), is prepared and the sodium counter ions present on the surface to balance the POMs&#8217; charge are replaced with copper(II) ions, (Cu&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;[POM]@TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). The microscopic and spectroscopic studies affirm the copper exchange without altering the TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; core and weak coordination of copper (II) ions to the POMs&#8217; surface. Band structure analysis suggests the photo-harvesting efficiency of the TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; core with the conduction band edge higher than the reduction potential of Cu&lt;sup&gt;II/I&lt;/sup&gt; and multi-electron CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction potentials. Photochemical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction with Cu&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;[POM]@TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; results in 30&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&lt;sub&gt;cat.&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; CO (79&#8201;%) and 8&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; of CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (21&#8201;%). Quasi-in-situ Raman study provides evidence in support of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption on the Cu&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;[POM]@TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; surface. &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C and D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O labeling studies affirm the {Cu-[CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;} adduct formation. Despite the photo-harvesting ability of Na&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;[POM]@TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; itself, the poor CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption ability of sodium ions highlights the crucial role of copper ion CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; photo-reduction. Characterization of the {M-[&#951;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;} species via surface tuning validates the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; activation and photochemical reduction pathway proposed earlier.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

We present here the encapsulation of an FeII spin crossover complex C1 inside MOF&#8208;808(Zr), a chemically robust Metal&#8208;Organic Framework. The compound C1&#8834;MOF&#8208;808 retains its crystallinity as well as a partial porosity compared to pristine MOF and shows a reversible solvatochromism under formaldehyde and formic acid vapor sorption associated to a spin state change of the guest complex.







Abstract
We present here the encapsulation of a spin crossover complex C1 [FeII(L)] (L: 4&#8208;amino&#8208;, 2&#8208;(2&#8208;pyridinylmethylene)hydrazide) inside MOF&#8208;808(Zr), a chemically robust Metal&#8208;Organic Framework. The compound C1&#8834;MOF&#8208;808 retains its crystallinity as well as a partial porosity compared to pristine MOF and shows solvatochromism under Volatile Organic compounds (VOCs) sorption associated to a spin state change of the guest complex. More specifically, this compound shows an interesting reversible color change under formaldehyde and formic acid vapor sorption and can therefore be considered as a new kind of optical VOCs chemosensor, opening new doors for developing a broad range of VOCs optical sensors.

         <title>Influence of Chemical Modifications of the Crystallophore on Protein Nucleating Properties and Supramolecular Interactions Network</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Crystallophores are lanthanide complexes known to favor protein crystallization. Herein, we explore the effect of the introduction of pendant arms at the free amino position of the TACN macrocycle on the nucleating properties and protein crystal structures. Through high&#8208;throughput crystallization experiments and dataset analysis, we evaluated the effectiveness of these variants, in comparison to the first crystallophore generation, and highlighted the potential of the V1 variant, featuring a propanol pendant arm.







Abstract
Crystallophores are lanthanide complexes that have demonstrated outstanding induction of crystallization for various proteins. This article explores the effect of tailored modifications of the crystallophore first generation and their impact on the nucleating properties and protein crystal structures. Through high&#8208;throughput crystallization experiments and dataset analysis, we evaluated the effectiveness of these variants, in comparison to the first crystallophore generation G1. In particular, the V1 variant, featuring a propanol pendant arm, demonstrated the ability to produce new crystallization conditions for the proteins tested (hen&#8208;egg white lysozyme, proteinase K and thaumatin). Structural analysis performed in the case of hen egg&#8208;white lysozyme along with Molecular Dynamics simulations, highlights V1&#8242;s unique behavior, taking advantage of the flexibility of its propanol arm to explore different protein surfaces and form versatile supramolecular interactions.

         <title>Enhanced Low&#8208;Temperature Resistance of Lithium&#8208;Metal Rechargeable Batteries Based on Electrolyte Including Ethyl Acetate and LiDFOB Additives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Adjusting the solvent structure and reducing the desolvation energy enables the electrolyte to withstand high voltages and low temperatures. Li//LCO and HC//LCO batteries using this electrolyte can still operate within the voltage range of 3.0 to 4.5&#8197;V at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C, exhibiting high discharge specific capacities and long cycling performance.







Abstract
To meet the demand for higher energy density in lithium&#8208;ion batteries and expand their application range, coupling lithium metal anodes with high&#8208;voltage cathodes is an ideal solution. However, the compatibility between lithium metal batteries and electrolytes affects their applicability. In this study, proposes a locally concentrated electrolyte based on ethyl acetate (EA) as the solvent, lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) as the lithium salt, and lithium difluorooxoborate (LiDFOB) as a sacrificial agent to enhance the low&#8208;temperature and high&#8208;voltage endurance of Li//Lithium cobalt oxide (LCO) batteries. The Li//LCO battery can operate within the voltage range of 3 to 4.5&#8197;V, with an initial discharge specific capacity of 174.5&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 20&#8201;&#176;C. At &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C, after 200 cycles, the capacity retention rate is 87.7&#8201;%. It can operate under extreme conditions of &#8722;70&#8201;&#176;C, with a discharge specific capacity of 112.6&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1. Additionally, LCO//HC batteries using this electrolyte demonstrate excellent performance. Present work provides a new perspective for the optimization of electrolytes for low&#8208;temperature lithium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>The Formation of Carbon Dots from D&#8208;Glucose Studied by Infrared Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

This work was funded and developed within the framework of the project e.INS&#8211;Ecosystem of Innovation for Next Generation Sardinia (grant number ECS 00000038), funded by the Italian Ministry for Research and Education (MUR) under the National Recovery and Resilience Plan (NRRP)&#8211;MISSION 4 COMPONENT 2, &#8220;From research to business&#8221; INVESTMENT 1.5, &#8220;Creation and strengthening of Ecosystems of innovation&#8221;, and construction of &#8220;Territorial R&amp;D Leaders&#8221;.







Abstract
Carbon dots (C&#8208;dots) obtained from D&#8208;glucose have attracted great interest because of their properties and as a model for understanding the synthesis process and the origin of photoluminescence in carbon&#8208;based nanostructures. Synthesising C&#8208;dots under hydrothermal conditions has become one of the most common methods for their preparation. Understanding the details of this process is quite difficult. To tackle this challenge, we have adopted a multi&#8208;technique approach in our present work. We have correlated different spectroscopic analyses, such as infrared, Raman, fluorescence, NMR, and UV&#8208;Vis, to connect the emissions with specific chemical groups. In particular, in&#8197;situ infrared analysis as a function of temperature has allowed following the formation of C=C, C=O, and COOH species and the rise of specific emissions. Only weak emissions due to n&#8208;&#960;* transitions are detected upon post&#8208;synthesis thermal annealing.

         <title>Chemo&#8208;, Regio&#8208; and Stereoselective Preparation of (Z)&#8208;2&#8208;Butene&#8208;1,4&#8208;Diol Monoesters via Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Decarboxylative Acyloxylation</title>

         <dc:description>
A practical method for the preparation of a wide range of 2&#8208;butene&#8208;1,4&#8208;diol monoesters using Pd&#8208;catalysis is described that combines typically high yields, high chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208; and stereocontrol under mild operating conditions. The target compounds find application in the synthesis of a range of bifunctional scaffolds that have potential in complex molecule synthesis.







Abstract
(Z)&#8208;alkenes are useful synthons but thermodynamically less stable than their (E)&#8208;isomers and typically more difficult to prepare. The synthesis of 1,4&#8208;hetero&#8208;bifunctionalized (Z)&#8208;alkenes is particularly challenging due to the inherent regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity issues. Herein we demonstrate a general, chemoselective and direct synthesis of (Z)&#8208;2&#8208;butene&#8208;1,4&#8208;diol monoesters. The protocol operates within a Pd&#8208;catalyzed decarboxylative acyloxylation regime involving vinyl ethylene carbonates (VECs) and various carboxylic acids as the reaction partners under mild and operationally attractive conditions. The newly developed process allows access to a structurally diverse pool of (Z)&#8208;2&#8208;butene&#8208;1,4&#8208;diol monoesters in good yields and with excellent regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity. Various synthetic transformations of the obtained (Z)&#8208;2&#8208;butene&#8208;1,4&#8208;diol monoesters demonstrate how these synthons are of great use to rapidly diversify the portfolio of these formal desymmetrized (Z)&#8208;alkenes.

         <title>Defect&#8208;Engineered Metal&#8208;Organic Framework/Polyimide Mixed Matrix Membrane for CO2 Separation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Engineering defects on the Zr&#8208;fumarate MOF by heating the as&#8208;synthesized material at 320 &#176;C creates open Zr coordination sites, which improve its performance as the filler in mixed matrix membranes for CO2 separation, increasing both the permeability and selectivity over the Robeson upper bound for CO2/CH4 separation.







Abstract
Defect&#8208;engineered metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with outstanding structural and chemical features have become excellent candidates for specific separation applications. The introduction of structural defects in MOFs as an efficient approach to manipulate their functionality provides excellent opportunities for the preparation of MOF&#8208;based mixed matrix membranes (MMMs). However, the use of this strategy to adjust the properties and develop the separation performance of gas separation membranes is still in its early stages. Here, a novel defect&#8208;engineered MOF (quasi ZrFum or Q&#8208;ZrFum) was synthesized via a controlled thermal deligandation process and incorporated into a CO2&#8208;philic 6FDA&#8208;durene polyimide (PI) matrix to form Q&#8208;ZrFum loaded MMMs. Defect&#8208;engineered MOFs and fabricated MMMs were investigated regarding their characteristic properties and separation performance. The incorporation of defects into the MOF structure increases the pore size and provides unsaturated active metal sites that positively affect CO2 molecule transport. The interfacial compatibility between the Q&#8208;ZrFum particles and the PI matrix increases via the deligandation process, which improves the mechanical strength of Q&#8208;ZrFum loaded membranes. MMM containing 5&#8197;wt.% of defect&#8208;engineered Q&#8208;ZrFum exhibits excellent CO2 permeability of 1308 Barrer, which increased by 99&#8201;% compared to the pure PI membrane (656 Barrer) at a feed pressure of 2&#8197;bar. CO2/CH4 and CO2/N2 selectivity reached 44 and 26.6 which increased by about 70 and 16&#8201;%, respectively. This study emphasizes that defect&#8208;engineered MOFs can be promising candidates for use as fillers in the preparation of MMMs for the future development of membrane&#8208;based gas separation applications.

Electrosynthesis of dihydroxycoumestan and its application as topoisomerase I poison.







Abstract
Coumestan represents a biologically relevant structural motif distributed in a number of natural products, and the rapid construction of related derivatives as well as the characterization of targets would accelerate lead compound discovery in medicinal chemistry. In this work, a general and scalable approach to 8,9&#8208;dihydroxycoumestans via two&#8208;electrode constant current electrolysis was developed. The application of a two&#8208;phase (aqueous/organic) system plays a crucial role for success, protecting the sensitive o&#8208;benzoquinone intermediates from over&#8208;oxidation. Based on the structurally diverse products, a primary SAR study on coumestan scaffold was completed, and compound 3&#8201;r exhibited potent antiproliferative activities and a robust topoisomerase I (Top1) inhibitory activity. Further mechanism studies demonstrates that compound 3&#8201;r was a novel Top1 poison, which might open an avenue for the development of Top1&#8208;targeted antitumor agent.

         <title>Cleaving Folded RNA by Multifunctional DNAzyme Nanomachines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The developed multifunctional DNAzyme nanomachine (DNM) binds RNA by four short RNA binding arms, which ensure tight and highly selective RNA binding. The design can increase both the binding and product release steps of the DNAzyme catalytic cycle. The approach is efficient in cleaving RNA having stable secondary structures.







Abstract
Both tight and specific binding of folded biological mRNA is required for gene silencing by oligonucleotide gene therapy agents. However, this is fundamentally impossible using the conventional oligonucleotide probes according to the affinity/specificity dilemma. This study addresses this problem for cleaving folded RNA by using multicomponent agents (dubbed &#8216;DNA nanomachine&#8217; or DNM). DNMs bind RNA by four short RNA binding arms, which ensure tight and highly selective RNA binding. Along with the improved affinity, DNM maintain the high sequence selectivity of the conventional DNAzymes. DNM enabled up to 3&#8208;fold improvement in DNAzymes catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) by facilitating both RNA substrate binding and product release steps of the catalytic cycle. This study demonstrates that multicomponent probes organized in sophisticated structures can help to achieve the balance between affinity and selectivity in recognizing folded RNA and thus creates a foundation for applying complex DNA nanostructures derived by DNA nanotechnology in gene therapy.

         <title>Direct Comparative Studies Revealing the Contribution of TADF Activity of Organic Emitters Towards Efficient Electrochemiluminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We presented four Carbazole&#8208;benzonitrile molecules possessing similar properties to facilitate a fairer comparison, thereby highlighting the influence of TADF on improving ECL. Intense ECL emission was observed from 4CzBN, underscoring the substantial difference in the ECL among molecules with comparable &#916;EST and similar spectral properties but varying TADF activity.







Abstract
Electrochemiluminescence (ECL) featuring thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) properties has attracted considerable interest, showcasing their potential for 100&#8201;% exciton harvesting, which marks a significant advancement in the realm of organic ECL. However, the challenge of elucidating the precise contribution of TADF to the enhanced ECL efficiency arises due to the lack of comparative studies of organic compounds with or without efficient TADF properties. In this study, we present four carbazole&#8208;benzonitrile molecules possessing similar chemical structures and comparable exchange energy (&#916;EST). Despite their comparable properties, these compounds exhibited varying TADF efficiencies, warranting a closer examination of their underlying structural and electronic characteristics governing the optical properties. Consequently, intense ECL emission was only observed from 4CzBN with a remarkable TADF efficiency, underscoring the substantial difference in the ECL signal among molecules with comparable &#916;EST and similar spectral properties but varying TADF activity.

&lt;p&gt;Electrochemiluminescence (ECL) featuring thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) properties has attracted considerable interest, showcasing their potential for 100&#8201;% exciton harvesting, which marks a significant advancement in the realm of organic ECL. However, the challenge of elucidating the precise contribution of TADF to the enhanced ECL efficiency arises due to the lack of comparative studies of organic compounds with or without efficient TADF properties. In this study, we present four carbazole-benzonitrile molecules possessing similar chemical structures and comparable exchange energy (&#916;E&lt;sub&gt;ST&lt;/sub&gt;). Despite their comparable properties, these compounds exhibited varying TADF efficiencies, warranting a closer examination of their underlying structural and electronic characteristics governing the optical properties. Consequently, intense ECL emission was only observed from 4CzBN with a remarkable TADF efficiency, underscoring the substantial difference in the ECL signal among molecules with comparable &#916;E&lt;sub&gt;ST&lt;/sub&gt; and similar spectral properties but varying TADF activity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Active Site Environment and Reactivity of Copper&#8208;A&#946; in Membrane Mimetic SDS Micellar Environment</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the abnormal aggregation of amyloid &#946; (A&#946;) peptide in extracellular deposits generated upon proteolysis of Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP). While copper (Cu2+) binds to A&#946; in soluble oligomeric and aggregated forms, its interaction with membrane&#8208;bound A&#946; remains elusive. Investigating these interactions is crucial for understanding AD pathogenesis. Here, utilizing SDS micelles as a simplified membrane mimic, we focus on elucidating the interplay between membrane&#8208;anchored A&#946; and copper, given their pivotal roles in AD. We employed spectroscopic techniques including UV, CD, and EPR to characterize the active site of Cu&#8208;A&#946; complexes. Our findings demonstrate that copper interacts with A&#946; peptides in membrane&#8208;mimicking micellar environments similarly to aqueous buffer solutions. Cu&#8208;A&#946; complexes in this medium also induce higher hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production, potentially contributing to AD&#8208;related oxidative stress. Moreover, we observe an increased oxidation rate of neurotransmitter such as dopamine by Cu&#8208;A&#946; complexes. These results enhance our understanding of Cu&#8208;A&#946; interactions in AD pathology and offer insights into potential therapeutic interventions targeting this interaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Designing Cobalt(II) Complex for Chemoselective Synthesis of 2&#8208;Aryl&#8208;3&#8208;formyl indoles from Amino Alcohols and Alcohols&#8224;</title>

         <dc:description>An air&#8208;stable, inexpensive, and isolable cobalt(II) complex (C1) of N&#8208;((1&#8208;methyl&#8208;1H&#8208;imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)methyl)&#8208;2&#8208;(phenylselanyl)ethan amine (L1) was synthesized and characterized. The complex was used to catalyze a one&#8208;pot cascade reaction between 2&#8208;(2&#8208;aminophenyl)ethanols and benzyl alcohol derivatives. Interestingly, 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;3&#8208;formylindole derivatives were formed instead of N&#8208;alkylated or C&#8208;3 alkylated indoles. A broad substrate scope can be activated using this protocol with only 5.0 mol% catalyst loading to achieve up to 87% yield of 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;3&#8208;formylindole derivatives. The mechanistic studies suggested that the reaction proceeds through tandem imine formation followed by cyclization.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;immolative Polymer Hydrogels via&#160;In Situ&#160;Gelation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogels are of interest for a wide range of applications. The ability to control when the hydrogel degrades can provide beneficial properties such as controlled degradation in the environment or the stimulated release of drugs or cells. Self&#8208;immolative polymers are a class of degradable polymers that undergo complete end&#8208;to&#8208;end depolymerization upon the application of a stimulus. They have been explored for hydrogel development, but the ability to prepare and selectively degrade self&#8208;immolative hydrogels under neutral aqueous conditions has so far been limited. We describe here the preparation of water&#8208;soluble polyglyoxyamides with cross&#8208;linkable pendent azides and their cross&#8208;linking to form hydrogels with 4&#8208;arm poly(ethylene glycol)s having unstrained and strained alkynes using copper&#8208;assisted and strain&#8208;promoted azide&#8208;alkyne click chemistry respectively. The influence of pendent azide density and solution polymer content on the resulting hydrogels was evaluated. A polyglyoxylamide with a 70:30 ratio of pendent hydroxyl:azide successfully provided hydrogels with compressive moduli ranging from 1.3 &#8211; 6.3 kPa under copper&#8208;free conditions at 10 &#8211; 20% (w/w) of polymer in phosphate&#8208;buffered saline. Selective depolymerization and degradation of the hydrogels upon irradiation with light was demonstrated, resulting in reductions in the compressive moduli and the release of depolymerization products that were detected by NMR spectroscopy.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of a Library of Terpenoid Alkaloid&#8211;like Compounds Containing Medium&#8208;sized Rings via Reconstruction of the Humulene Skeleton</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The construction of a chemical library based on natural products is a promising method for the synthesis of natural product&#8211;like compounds. In this study, we synthesized a terpenoid alkaloid&#8211;like compound library based on the humulene skeleton. Our strategy, which enables access to diverse ring systems such as 11&#8208;membered monocyclic, oxabicyclic, and medium&#8208;sized aza ring&#8211;containing scaffolds, involves the introduction of a nitrogen atom, an intermolecular C&#8211;O bond formation via Lewis acid&#8211;mediated epoxide&#8208;opening transannulation, and a ring&#8208;reconstruction strategy based on olefin metathesis. A cheminformatics analysis based on their structural and physicochemical properties revealed that the synthesized compounds have high three&#8208;dimensionality and high natural product likeness scores but with structural novelty. The usefulness of the terpenoid alkaloid&#8211;like compound library for drug discovery and the accessibility to structure&#8211;activity relationship studies were validated by performing an assay for osteoclast&#8208;specific tartrate&#8208;resistant acid phosphatase activity, resulting in the identification of a lead compound for bone&#8208;resorptive diseases such as osteoporosis.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The confinement and high utilization of sulfur in the cathodes is critical for improved cycling performance of lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries. In this case one&#8208;pot hydrothermal strategy is developed to produce rGO/MXene/sulfur composite aerogels where sulfur is in situ trapped in the 3D rGO/MXene conductive skeleton. The optimized composite aerogels as free&#8208;standing cathodes delivery a specific capacity of 951 mAhg&#8208;1 after 100 cycles at 0.2 C with a low fading rate of 0.062% per cycle.

         <title>Fluorination/Dearomatization of C6F5 Groups: An FLP Route to an Electrophilic Borane and Non&#8208;Coordinating Anions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrophilic fluorination and de&#8208;aromatization of C6F5 rings in boranes and borate derivatives is achieved using XeF2 in the presence of BF3 or Lewis acidic cations. Thus, the anions [FB(C6F7)3]&#8722;, [B(C6F7)4]&#8722;, and [(C6F7)3BC&#8801;NB(C6F7)3]&#8722;, and borane adducts (L)B(C6F7)3 (L=MeCN, OPEt3) are reported.







Abstract
B(C6F5)3 and the corresponding anion [B(C6F5)4]&#8722; are ubiquitous in main group and transition metal chemistry. Known derivatives are generally limited to the incorporation of electron donating substituents. Herein we describe electrophilic fluorination and dearomatization of such species using XeF2 in the presence of BF3 or Lewis acidic cations. In this fashion the anions [HB(C6F5)3]&#8722;, [B(C6F5)4]&#8722; and [(C6F5)3BC&#8801;NB(C6F5)3]&#8722;, are converted to [FB(C6F7)3]&#8722;, [B(C6F7)4]&#8722;, and [(C6F7)3BC&#8801;NB(C6F7)3]&#8722;, respectively. Similarly, the borane adducts (L)B(C6F7)3 (L=MeCN, OPEt3) are produced. These rare examples of electrophilic attack of electron deficient rings proceed as [XeF][BF4] acts as a frustrated Lewis pair effecting fluorination and dearomatization of C6F5 rings.

         <title>A Monometallic Bis(cyaphido) Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bis(cyaphido) complex is achieved for the first time, demonstrating the viability of incorporating multiple cyaphido ligands at one metal center. Comparison with the heteroleptic C&#8801;N/C&#8801;P analogue offers the first direct experimental comparison of cyaphide with cyanide. A degree of cooperative delocalization within the bis(cyaphido) complex illustrates the cyaphido ligand exhibiting some &#960;&#8208;donor, in addition to its &#960;&#8208;acceptor, character.







Abstract
The first example of a bis(cyaphido) complex, trans&#8208;[Ru(dppe)2(C&#8801;P)2], is described, unequivocally demonstrating the synthetic accessibility and stability of complexes that feature more than one cyaphido ligand. Synthesis is achieved from the precedent cation [Ru(dppe)2(C&#8801;P)]+ via sequential coordination and desilylation of the phosphaalkyne Me3SiC&#8801;P. The heteroleptic analogue trans&#8208;[Ru(dppe)2(C&#8801;N)(C&#8801;P)] is also prepared from the same cation and NaCN; both cyaphido complexes are structurally characterized, enabling the first direct comparison of cyaphide with cyanide, its isoelectronic and isolobal counterpart. This demonstrates an enhanced &#960;&#8208;acidity for &#8722;C&#8801;P over &#8722;C&#8801;N, while computational studies reveal also a higher &#960;&#8208;donor character for the cyaphido ligand.

         <title>The Complete Assessment of Small Molecule and Peptidomimetic Inhibitors of Sortase A Towards Antivirulence Treatment</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review covers the most recent advances in the development of inhibitors for the bacterial enzyme sortase A (SrtA), where it is considered as a major target for antivirulence therapy. Sortases are key enzymes regulating bacterial adherence to host cells and are considered major virulence factors. Currently, many promising approaches to target SrtA are available, including naturally derived and synthetic small molecule inhibitors as well as peptidomimetic inhibitors, based on the SrtA recognition sequence.







Abstract
This review covers the most recent advances in the development of inhibitors for the bacterial enzyme sortase A (SrtA). Sortase A (SrtA) is a critical virulence factor, present ubiquitously in Gram&#8208;positive bacteria of which many are pathogenic. Sortases are key enzymes regulating bacterial adherence to host cells, by anchoring extracellular matrix&#8208;binding proteins to the bacterial outer cell wall. By targeting virulence factors, effective treatment can be achieved, without inducing antibiotic resistance to the treatment. This is a potentially more sustainable, long&#8208;term approach to treating bacterial infections, including ones that display multiple resistance to current therapeutics. There are many promising approaches available for SrtA inhibition, some of which have the potential to advance into further clinical development, with peptidomimetic and in&#8197;vivo active small molecules being among the most promising. There are currently no approved drugs on the market targeting SrtA, despite its promise, adding to the relevance of this review article, as it extends to the pharmaceutical industry additionally to academic researchers.

         <title>Unlocking Photocatalytic Activity of Acridinium Salts by Anion&#8208;Binding Co&#8208;Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The merge of anion&#8208;binding and photoredox catalysis for the modular, in&#8197;situ photocatalytic activation of acridinium salts is reported. This approach leads to an enhancement of the stability and selectivity of the photoactive ion pair species, which proved effective to promote several visible light&#8208;mediated photoredox reactions.







Abstract
The in&#8197;situ generation of active photoredox organic catalysts upon anion&#8208;binding co&#8208;catalysis by making use of the ionic nature of common photosensitizers is reported. Hence, the merge of anion&#8208;binding and photocatalysis permitted the modulation of the photocatalytic activity of simple acridinium halide salts, building an effective anion&#8208;binding &#8211; photoredox ion pair complex able to promote a variety of visible light driven transformations, such as anti&#8208;Markovnikov addition to olefins, Diels&#8208;Alder and the desilylative C&#8722;C bond forming reactions. Anion&#8208;binding studies, together with steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved spectroscopy analysis, supported the postulated ion pair formation between the thiourea hydrogen&#8208;bond donor organocatalyst and the acridinium salt, which proved essential for unlocking the photocatalytic activity of the photosensitizer.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unusually stable: Triazenes stabilized with a cyclic (amino)(alkyl)carbene are readily accessible, remarkably stable towards thermal N2 loss and undergo partially reversible E&#8208;to&#8208;Z isomerization. They offer a large &#960;&#8208;conjugation that extends from the N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene and through all three nitrogens and, when used as ligand to palladium, impart high catalytic activity in olefin oligomerization and double bond migration.







Abstract
N&#8208;heterocyclic imines such as pyridylidene amines impart high catalytic activity when coordinated to a transition metal, largely imposed by their electronic flexibility. Here, this donor flexibility has been applied for the first time to CAAC&#8208;based systems through the synthesis of CAAC&#8208;triazenes. These new ligands offer a larger &#960;&#8208;conjugation that extends from the N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene through three nitrogens rather than just one, as observed in N&#8208;heterocyclic imines. We demonstrate the straightforward synthesis of three new CAAC&#8208;triazenes containing different substituents on the terminal triazene nitrogen. These compounds are remarkably stable up to 120&#8201;&#176;C without loss of N2 as typically observed with similar triazenes. E&#8208;to&#8208;Z isomerization within the triazene is instigated by UV light and is partially reversible dependent on the triazene substituent. The quinoline&#8208;substituted CAAC&#8208;triazene 1&#8208;Q has been applied as an L,L&#8217;&#8208;type ligand in the synthesis of [PdCl2(1&#8208;Q)], [PdCl(Me)(1&#8208;Q)] and [Pd(Me)(H2O(1&#8208;Q)]+. E&#8208;to&#8208;Z ligand isomerization also occurs when coordinated to PdCl2, providing access to on&#8208;metal manipulation. The cationic complex [PdMe(H2O)(1&#8208;Q)]+ is a precatalyst for oligomerization of ethylene to form initially 2&#8208;butene and subsequently linear and branched C8&#8722;C12 products from butene activation. Moreover, isomerization of 1&#8208;hexene takes place efficiently with exceptionally low catalyst loading (10&#8197;ppm) and up to 74,000 turnover numbers.

         <title>An Efficient and Scalable &#8220;Second Generation&#8221; Total Synthesis of the Marine Polyketide Limaol Endowed with Antiparasitic Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The apparently non&#8208;thermodynamic cluster of skipped exo&#8208;methylene substituents on the &#8220;northern&#8221; wing of limaol is not the Achilles heel of this unique dinoflagellate&#8208;derived marine natural product; rather, the proper choice of protecting groups on the spiroketal core proved to be key for an efficient synthesis. In consideration thereof, a &#8220;second generation&#8221; synthesis was devised that is practical, robust, efficient and scalable.







Abstract
The cluster of four skipped exo&#8208;methylene substituents on the &#8220;northern&#8221; wing of limaol renders this dinoflagellate&#8208;derived marine natural product unique in structural terms. This arguably non&#8208;thermodynamic array gains kinetic stability by virtue of populating local conformations which impede isomerization to a partly or fully conjugated polyene. This analysis suggested that the difficulties encountered during the late stages of our first total synthesis of this polyketide had not been caused by an overly fragile character of this unusual substructure; rather, an unfavorable steric microenvironment about the spirotricyclic core was identified as the likely cause. To remedy the issue, the protecting groups on this central fragment were changed; in effect, this amendment allowed all strategic and practical problems to be addressed. As a result, the overall yield over the longest linear sequence was multiplied by a factor of almost five and the material throughput increased more than eighty&#8208;fold per run. Key&#8208;to&#8208;success was a gold&#8208;catalyzed spirocyclization reaction; the reasons why a Br&#248;nsted acid cocatalyst is needed and the origin of the excellent levels of selectivity were delineated. The change of the protecting groups also allowed for much improved fragment coupling processes; most notably, the sequence of a substrate&#8208;controlled carbonyl addition reaction followed by Mitsunobu inversion that had originally been necessary to affix the southern tail to the core could be replaced by a reagent controlled asymmetric allylation. Finally, a much&#8208;improved route to the &#8220;northern&#8221; sector was established by leveraging the power of asymmetric hydrogenation of a 2&#8208;pyrone derivative. Limaol was found to combine appreciable antiparasitic activity with very modest cytotoxicity.

         <title>Synthesis and Performance of Bio&#8208;Based Amphoteric Surfactants</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of sustainable bio&#8208;based surfactants was explored derived from biomass monosaccharides. Amphoteric, amine&#8208;oxide containing surfactants were prepared through a simple oxidation process. These carbohydrate&#8208;based surfactants showed comparable properties performance to their commercially applied benchmarks. These bio&#8208;based alternatives offered a reduced skin irritation potential rapid biodegradability, increased viscosity, making them good candidates for the formulation of bio&#8208;based personal care products.







Abstract
As the global surfactant market continues to expand, there is an increasing need to develop bio&#8208;based alternatives in the shift towards a circular economy. This study focuses on the synthesis of polar, amphoteric, amine&#8208;oxide surfactants starting from biomass&#8208;derived monosaccharides and demonstrating their potential in various applications. The synthesis involved a reductive amination of the sugars with an alkylamine and formaldehyde followed by oxidation to produce N&#8208;oxide surfactants. These bio&#8208;based surfactants exhibited promising properties, including high solubility, foamability, surface tension reduction, and critical micelle concentration. In particular, N&#8208;GalA1.10 and N&#8208;GalA1.12 showed comparable performance to commercial surfactants. Furthermore, these bio&#8208;based surfactants demonstrated significantly lower skin irritation potential when compared to petrochemical&#8208;derived counterparts like sodium laureth sulfate (SLES), making them potentially suitable for personal care products. The biodegradability assessment revealed that N&#8208;GalA1.12 exhibited good biodegradation, indicating its potential environmental compatibility. In conclusion, this study highlights the potential of bio&#8208;based N&#8208;oxide surfactants derived from monosaccharides as sustainable and skin&#8208;friendly alternatives to traditional amphoteric surfactants, like cocamidopropyl betaine (CAPB).

         <title>Coinage Metal Complexes of a Sterically Encumbered Anionic Pyridylborate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sterically loaded anionic pyridyl borate ligand has been utilized successfully to stabilize two&#8208;coordinate gold, silver, and copper phosphine complexes and a gold isocyanide complex, and to probe their solid&#8208;state structures, bonding, and spectroscopic features.







Abstract
Sterically loaded, anionic pyridine has been synthesized and utilized successfully in the stabilization of a isoleptic series of coinage metal complexes. The treatment of [4&#8208;(Ph3B)&#8208;2,6&#8208;Trip2Py]K (Trip=2,4,6&#8208;iPr3C6H2) with CuBr(PPh3), AgCl(PPh3) or AuCl(PPh3) (Py=pyridine) afforded the corresponding [4&#8208;(Ph3B)&#8208;2,6&#8208;Trip2Py]M(PPh3) (M=Au, Ag, Cu) complexes, via salt metathesis, as isolable, crystalline solids. Notably, these reactions avoid the facile single electron transfer chemistry reported with the less bulky ligand systems. The X&#8208;ray structures revealed that they are two&#8208;coordinate metal adducts. The M&#8722;N and M&#8722;P bond distances are longest in the silver and shortest in the copper adduct among the three group 11 family members. Computational analysis revealed an interesting stability dependence on steric bulk of the anionic pyridine (i.&#8201;e., pyridyl borate) ligand. A comparison of structures and bonding of [4&#8208;(Ph3B)&#8208;2,6&#8208;Trip2Py]Au(PPh3) to pyridine and m&#8208;terphenyl complexes, {[2,6&#8208;Trip2Py]Au(PPh3)}[SbF6] and [2,6&#8208;Trip2Ph]Au(PPh3) are also provided. The Au(I) isocyanide complex, [4&#8208;(Ph3B)&#8208;2,6&#8208;Trip2Py]Au(CNBut) has been stabilized using the same anionic pyridylborate illustrating that it can support other gold&#8208;ligand moieties as well.

         <title>Bispidine Based Hg(II) 1D Coordination Polymers of Helical Topology: Stability, Selective Adsorption and 1D to 2D Dimensionality Change Via SC&#8208;to&#8208;SC Transformation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two remarkably similar coordination polymers made of bispidine ligand 1 and Hg(II) ions behave in a completely different way as one provides selective adsorption capabilities towards MeOH/CHCl3 mixtures while the other a 1D to 2D dimensionality change in a SC&#8208;to&#8208;SC fashion.







Abstract
Bispidine based Hg(II) coordination polymers of helical topology CP&#8208;MeOH and CP&#8208;EtOH are almost isostructural (they mainly differ for the solvent included in their lattice and by a small % in unit cell parameters) but they differ for everything else: i) their intrinsic stability, ii) their ability to adsorb solvents upon prior evacuation, iii) their accessible structural transformations. In particular, one of the two starting materials, once evacuated, is capable to adsorb methanol from atmospheres containing binary and ternary mixtures of volatile organic compounds (MeOH, CHCl3 and EtOH) under ambient conditions (25&#8201;&#176;C, 1&#8197;atm) and with a marked selectivity. The other one is not, but undergoes a 1D to 2D dimensionality change which can be monitored in&#8197;situ by SC&#8208;XRD through a SC&#8208;to&#8208;SC process.

A colorimetric sensor array based on homochiral metal&#8211;organic&#8208;framework films in Fabry&#8211;P&#233;rot cavities is presented. The sensor read&#8208;out is generated by recording the RGB values with a common smartphone camera, and the data are analyzed with a simple machine&#8208;learning algorithm. In addition to the enantioselective detection of chiral odor molecules, the sensor system enables the discrimination of a large number of commercial perfume scents. More information can be found in the Research Article by L. Heinke and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202400798). Picture by Kuo Zhan.

         <title>Understanding Flexdispersion: Structure&#8211;Function Relationship Studies of Organic Amphiphilic Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Front Cover shows a schematic impression of our study on the &#8220;flexible&#8221; dispersibility of TiO2 nanoparticles in a variety of organic solvents. We previously developed amphiphilic ligands that consist of alkyl chains and ethylene glycol chains to disperse inorganic nanoparticles in a variety of organic solvents. In this study, we have shown that the ratio of alkyl/ethylene glycol chains alone does not define the dispersibility of nanoparticles in various solvents, but that the arrangement of individual chains also has an effect. More information can be found in the Research Article by Y. Okada and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202304324).

         <title>Advanced Insulin Synthesis by One&#8208;Pot/Stepwise Disulfide Bond Formation Enabled by S&#8208;Protected Cysteine Sulfoxide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
S&#8208;Protected cysteine and its sulfoxide pairs allow stepwise disulfide bond formation, with the reaction increasing in acidity. This system enables an unprecedented synthesis of insulin possessing three disulfides and its lipidated analog. Stepwise formation of three disulfides generally requires three independent oxidation steps; however, the presented method has a single oxidation step. More information can be found in the Research by et al. More information can be found in the Research Article by A. Otaka and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202401003).

The protocol exploits the synergistic role of redox&#8208;active Ni(II) complexes and AlCl3 as a CO2 activator/oxygen scavenger, leading to the formation of a wide range of cyclic amides and esters (28 examples) in good to high yields (up to 87%). A dedicated computational investigation revealed the multiple roles played by AlCl3. In particular, the simultaneous transient protection of the pendant amino group of the starting reagents and the formation of the electrophilically activated CO2&#8208;AlCl3 adduct are shown to concur in paving the way for an energetically favorable mechanistic pathway.</dc:description>

         <title>Aromaticity in the Spectroscopic Spotlight of Hexaphyrins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Spectroscopic properties are commonly used in the experimental evaluation of ground&#8208; and excited&#8208;state aromaticity in expanded porphyrins. Herein, we investigate if the defining photophysical properties still hold for a diverse set of hexaphyrins with varying redox states, topologies, peripheral substitutions, and core&#8208;modifications. By combining TD&#8208;DFT calculations with several aromaticity descriptors and chemical compound space maps, the intricate interplay between structural planarity, aromaticity, and absorption spectra is elucidated. Our results emphasize that the general assumption that antiaromatic porphyrinoids exhibit significantly attenuated absorption bands as compared to aromatic counterparts does not hold even for the unsubstituted macrocycles. To connect the spectroscopic properties to the hexaphyrins&#8217; aromaticity behaviour, we analyzed chemical compound space maps defined by the various aromaticity indices. The intensity of the Q&#8208;band is not well described by the macrocyclic aromaticity. Instead, the degeneracy of the frontier molecular orbitals appears to be a better indicator to identify hexaphyrins with enhanced light&#8208;absorbing abilities in the near&#8208;infrared region. Regions with highly planar (anti)aromatic hexaphyrin structuresare characterized by an intense B&#8208;band. Hence, we advise to use a combination of both global and local aromaticity descriptors rooted in different criteria to assess the aromaticity of expanded porphyrins instead of solely using the absorption spectrum.</dc:description>

         <title>Semisynthetic glycoconjugates as potential vaccine candidates against Haemophilus influenzae type a</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Glycoconjugate vaccines are based on chemical conjugation of pathogen&#8208;associated carbohydrates with immunogenic carrier proteins and are considered a very cost&#8208;effective way to prevent infections. Most of the licensed glycoconjugate vaccines are composed of saccharide antigens extracted from bacterial sources. However, synthetic oligosaccharide antigens have become a promising alternative to natural polysaccharides with the advantage of being well&#8208;defined structures providing homogeneous conjugates. Haemophilus influenzae (Hi) is responsible for a number of severe diseases. In recent years, an increasing rate of invasive infections caused by Hi serotype a (Hia) raised some concern, because no vaccine targeting Hia is currently available. The capsular polysaccharide (CPS) of Hia is constituted by phosphodiester&#8208;linked 4&#8208;&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;glucose&#8208;(1&#8594;4)&#8208;d&#8208;ribitol&#8208;5&#8208;(PO4&#8594;) repeating units and is the antigen for protein&#8208;conjugated polysaccharide vaccines. To investigate the antigenic potential of the CPS from Hia, we synthesized related saccharide fragments containing up to five repeating units. Following the synthetic optimization of the needed disaccharide building blocks, they were assembled using the phosphoramidite approach for the installation of the phosphodiester linkages. The resulting CPS&#8208;based Hia oligomers were conjugated to CRM197 carrier protein and evaluated in vivo for their immunogenic potential, showing that all glycoconjugates were capable of raising antibodies recognizing Hia synthetic fragments.</dc:description>

         <title>Towards Sustainable Materials: A Review of Acylhydrazone Chemistry for Reversible Polymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transitioning towards a circular economy, extensive research has focused on dynamic covalent bonds (DCBs) to pave the way for more sustainable materials. These bonds enable debonding and rebonding on demand, as well as facilitating end&#8208;of&#8208;life recycling. Acylhydrazone/hydrazone chemistry offers a material with high stability under neutral and basic conditions making it a promising candidate for materials research, though the material is susceptible to acid degradation. However, this degradation under acidic conditions can be exploited, making it widely applicable in self&#8208;healing and biomedical fields, with potential for reprocessing and recycling. This review highlights studies exploring the reversibility of acylhydrazone/hydrazone bonds in various polymers, altering their properties, and utilizing them in applications such as self&#8208;healing, reprocessing, and recycling. The review also focuses on how the mechanical properties are affected by the presence of dynamic linkages, and methods to improve the mechanical performance.</dc:description>

         <title>A Simply Synthesized Shaking&#8208;induced Small Molecule System with Repeatableand Instantaneous Discoloration Response</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Force&#8208;related discoloration materials are highly valuable because of their characteristics of visualization, easy operation, and environment friendliness. Most force&#8208;related discoloration materials focus on polymers and depend on bond scission, which leads to insensitivity and unrecoverable. Small&#8208;molecule systems based on well&#8208;defined molecular structures and simple composition with high sensitivity would exhibit considerable mechanochromic potential. However, to date, researches about force&#8208;related discoloration materials based on small molecule solution remain limited and are rarely reported. In this study, we developed a repeatable and instantaneous discoloration small molecule solution system by simple one&#8208;pot synthesis method. It exhibited an instantaneous chromic change from yellowish to dark green under shaking and reverting back to yellow within 1 minute after removal of the shaking. Experimental results confirmed that the discoloration mechanism is attributed to the oscillation accelerating the production of unstable ortho&#8208;OH phenoxyl radical. The newly developed shaking&#8208;induced discoloration small molecule system (SDSMS) promises in field of mechanical force sensing and optical encryption.</dc:description>

         <title>Charge&#8208;Transfer Complexes: Halogen&#8208;Doped Anthracene as a Case of Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ElectrochemicaTransistor set&#8208;up proposed in this paper features the peculiar characteristics that a suitable functionalized materials acts both as the working electrode (in an electrochemical cell) and the gate (in the transistor source/gate/drain layout). Allowing for simultaneous potential control and electrical impedance measurement of the working/gate (anthracene is used as working/gate electrode).







Abstract
Charge transfer (CT) crystals exhibit unique electronic and magnetic properties with interesting applications. We present a rational and easy guide which allows to foresee the effective charge transfer co&#8208;crystal production and that is based on the comparison of the frontier molecular orbital (MO) energies of a donor and acceptor couple. For the sake of comparison, theoretical calculations have been carried out by using the cheap and fast PM6 semiempirical Hamiltonian and pure HF/cc&#8208;pVTZ level of the theory. The results are then compared with experimental results obtained both by chemical (bromine and iodine were used as the acceptor) and electrochemical doping (exploiting an original experimental set&#8208;up by this laboratory: the electrochemical transistor). Infra&#8208;red vibrational experimental results and theoretically calculated spectra are compared to assess both the effective donor&#8208;acceptor (D/A) charge&#8208;transfer and transport mechanism (giant IRAV polaron signature). XPS spectra have been collected (carbon (1&#8197;s) and iodine (3d5/2)) signals, yielding further evidence of the effective formation of the CT anthracene:iodine complex.

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Lanthanide&#8211;Organic Framework as an Efficient Heterogeneous Catalyst for Cycloaddition of CO2 with Epoxides and Knoevenagel Condensation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;entropy lanthanide&#8211;organic framework (HE&#8208;LnMOF) heterogeneous catalyst toward sustainable CO2 conversion reactions. The five rare earth metals were well&#8208;dispersed and randomly distributed in the structure. The HE&#8208;LnMOF possess multiple unsaturated metal centers, abundant Lewis acid and base interaction sites at the same time. The synergistic effect of multi&#8208;metallic Ln3+ ions endow it with outstanding catalytic performance.







Abstract
Multimetallic synergistic effects have the potential to improve CO2 cycloesterification and Knoevenagel reaction processes, outperforming monometallic MOFs. The results demonstrate superior performance in these processes. To investigate this, we created and characterized a selection of single&#8208;component Ln(III)&#8208;MOFs (Ln=Eu, Tb, Gd, Dy, Ho) and high&#8208;entropy lanthanide&#8208;organic framework (HE&#8208;LnMOF) using solvent&#8208;thermal conditions. The experiments revealed that HE&#8208;LnMOF exhibited heightened catalytic efficiency in CO2 cycloesterification and Knoevenagel reactions compared to single&#8208;component Ln(III) MOFs. Moreover, the HE&#8208;LnMOF displayed significant stability, maintaining their structural integrity after five cycles while sustaining elevated conversion and selectivity rates. The feasible mechanisms of catalytic reactions were also discussed. HE&#8208;LnMOF possess multiple unsaturated metal centers, acting as Lewis acid sites, with oxygen atoms connecting the metal, and hydroxyl groups on the ligand serving as base sites. This study introduces a novel method for synthesizing HE&#8208;LnMOF and presents a fresh application of HE&#8208;LnMOF for converting CO2.

&lt;p&gt;A high-entropy lanthanide&#8211;organic framework (HE-LnMOF) heterogeneous catalyst toward sustainable CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; conversion reactions. The five rare earth metals were well-dispersed and randomly distributed in the structure. The HE-LnMOF possess multiple unsaturated metal centers, abundant Lewis acid and base interaction sites at the same time. The synergistic effect of multi-metallic Ln&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ions endow it with outstanding catalytic performance.

         <title>Unusual Photochemistry in Aromatic Dithioimides: Quantitative Thione Reduction Promoted by Ether Solvents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here we report the photochemical reaction of dithioimide (2SS) in ether&#8208;containing solvents. While 2SS undergoes photooxidation in the presence of oxygen (forming 2OO), under glove&#8208;box conditions it undergoes an unusual but efficient photoreduction to form 2SH2. Reaction product studies and DFT calculations suggest a mechanism involving the THF radical.







Abstract
We report a mechanistic investigation of an aromatic dithioimide (2SS) displaying puzzling yet efficient photochemistry in ether solvents. Perplexingly, 2SS dissolved in ether solvents in a sealed and degassed vial was photochemically converted to the corresponding diimide (2OO), as determined by 1H NMR following product extraction. With no external sources of oxygen in the sample, could the oxygen in 2OO be from the ether itself? To study this unprecedented proposition, we attempt to uncover the ether's involvement in this reaction. As seen by laser&#8208;flash photolysis, 2SS appears to first react with the solvent from its singlet excited state. Following the reaction by NMR under rigorously oxygen&#8208; and water&#8208;free conditions led to the identification of a photoreductive pathway that quantitatively transformed one thione into a methylene to yield 2SH2. Subsequent oxidation of 2SH2 or irradiation of 2SS under air proved that molecular oxygen was indeed necessary to observe an oxidative pathway leading to 2OO, ruling out the initially proposed involvement of an ether oxygen. An explanation of 2SS desulfurization was further revealed through the study of solvent by&#8208;products by GC&#8208;MS analysis. Supported by DFT calculations, a mechanism is proposed to involve a chain reaction initiated by photochemically generated ether radical.

         <title>Gaining Insights into the Interplay between Optical and Magnetic Properties in Photoexcited Coordination Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This concept article explores the understanding of the interplay of electronic and magnetic properties on the optical signatures of 3d&#8211;4f single molecule magnets (SMMs). It presents a combination of multiple time and frequency domain techniques including transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy and superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer measurements.







Abstract
We describe early and recent advances in the fascinating field of combined magnetic and optical properties of inorganic coordination compounds and in particular of 3d&#8211;4f single molecule magnets. We cover various applied techniques which allow for the correlation of results obtained in the frequency and time domain in order to highlight the specific properties of these compounds and the future challenges towards multidimensional spectroscopic tools. An important point is to understand the details of the interplay of magnetic and optical properties through performing time&#8208;resolved studies in the presence of external fields especially magnetic ones. This will enable further exploration of this fundamental interactions i.&#8201;e. the two components of electromagnetic radiation influencing optical properties.

         <title>Poly(2&#8208;Oxazoline) Amphiphilicity Tunes the Excited&#8208;State Proton Transfer of Pyrenol&#8208;Based Polyphotoacids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photo&#8208;responsive nature of polyphotoacids for their applicability in targeted release of cargo depends on an excited&#8208;state proton transfer (ESPT) step and therefore on the hydration of the local environment. Hence this contribution provides a mechanistic understanding of ESPT in polyoxazoline&#8208;based polymers with varying degrees of hydration with pyrenol as the photoacid of choice.







Abstract
The ability of light to change the properties of light&#8208;responsive polymers opens avenues for targeted release of cargo with a high degree of spatial and temporal control. Recently, we established photoacid polymers as light&#8208;switchable macromolecular amphiphiles. In these systems, light&#8208;induced excited&#8208;state proton transfer (ESPT) causes changes in amphilicity. However, as the intermolecular process itself critically depends on the local environment of the photoacid unit within the polymer, the overall amphiphilicity directly influences ESPT. Thus, understanding the impact of the local environment on the photophysics of photoacidic side chains is key to material design. In this contribution we address both thermodynamic and kinetic aspects of ESPT in oxazoline&#8208;based amphiphilic polymers with pyrenol&#8208;based photoacid side chains. We will compare the effect of polymer design, i.&#8201;e. statistical and block arrangements, i.&#8201;e. in poly[(2&#8208;ethyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxazoline)&#8208;co&#8208;(1&#8208;(6/8&#8208;hydroxyperene)sulphonylaziridine)] and poly(2&#8208;ethyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxazoline)&#8208;block&#8208;poly[(2&#8208;ethyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxazoline)&#8208;co&#8208;(2&#8208;(3&#8208;(6&#8208;hydroxypyrene)sulphonamide)propyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxazoline), on the intermolecular proton transfer reaction by combining steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved absorption and emission spectroscopy. ESPT appears more prominent in the statistical copolymer compared to a block copolymer with overall similar pyrenol loading. We hypothesize that the difference is due to different local chain arrangements adopted by the polymers in the two cases.

         <title>Mechanochemical Regioselective [3+3] Annulation of 6&#8208;Amino Uracil with Propargyl Alcohols Catalyzed by a Br&#248;nsted Acid/Hexafluoroisopropanol</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed the first mechanochemical annulation of 6&#8208;amino uracil with tert&#8208;propargyl alcohols by milling with p&#8208;TSA/HFIP. This regioselective annulation proceeds through the allenylation of uracil and subsequent 6&#8208;endo&#8208;trig cyclization. Interestingly, sec&#8208;propargyl alcohols furnished the propargylation of amino uracil.







Abstract
A mechanochemistry approach is developed for regioselective synthesis of functionalized dihydropyrido[2,3&#8208;d]pyrimidines by milling propargylic alcohols and 6&#8208;aminouracils with HFIP/p&#8208;TsOH. In the case of tert&#8208;propargyl alcohols, this [3+3] cascade annulation proceeded through allenylation of uracil followed by a 6&#8208;endo trig cyclization. With sec&#8208;propargyl alcohols, the reaction furnished the propargylation of uracil. This atom economy ball milling reaction allows access to a broad range of dihydropyrido[2,3&#8208;d]pyrimidine derivatives in excellent yields. We demonstrated the gram scale synthesis of 3&#8201;g and post&#8208;synthetic modifications to effect the cyclization of 5 to 6.

         <title>Poly(ferrocenylsilane)&#8208;Based Redox&#8208;Active Artificial Organelles for Biomimetic Cascade Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Poly(ferrocenylmethylethylthiocarboxypropylsilane) (PFC), a kind of novel polymer possesses excellent redox property, was employed to fabricate microcapsules via self&#8208;assembly at the interface of water&#8208;in&#8208;oil emulsion droplets. Within these PFC MCs, enzymatic cascades are induced through active molecular exchange across the membrane to mimic the functions of enzymes in mitochondria. We anticipate that the functional PFC MCs have the potential to serve as innovative platforms for artificial organelles capable of executing specific cellular functions.







Abstract
Artificial organelles serve as functional counterparts to natural organelles, which are primarily employed to artificially replicate, restore, or enhance cellular functions. While most artificial organelles exhibit basic functions, we diverge from this norm by utilizing poly(ferrocenylmethylethylthiocarboxypropylsilane) microcapsules (PFC MCs) to construct multifunctional artificial organelles through water/oil interfacial self&#8208;assembly. Within these PFC MCs, enzymatic cascades are induced through active molecular exchange across the membrane to mimic the functions of enzymes in mitochondria. We harness the inherent redox properties of the PFC polymer, which forms the membrane, to facilitate in&#8208;situ redox reactions similar to those supported by the inner membrane of natural mitochondria. Subsequent studies have demonstrated the interaction between PFC MCs and living cell including extended lifespans within various cell types. We anticipate that functional PFC MCs have the potential to serve as innovative platforms for organelle mimics capable of executing specific cellular functions.

         <title>Effect of Br&#248;nsted Acids on the Activation of Mixed Anhydride/Mixed Carbonic Anhydride and C&#8208;Terminal&#8208;Free N&#8208;Methylated Peptide Synthesis in a Micro&#8208;Flow Reactor</title>

         <dc:description>
A comparison between amidations using mixed carbonic anhydride and mixed anhydride in the presence of tertiary amine and Br&#248;nsted acids revealed a significant difference in the anhydrides. A rapid micro&#8208;flow C&#8208;terminal&#8208;free N&#8208;methylated peptide synthesis via acyl imidazolium without severe racemization has been developed. Unexpectedly, epimerization of the C&#8208;terminal&#8208;free N&#8208;methylated dipeptide was observed.







Abstract
Amidations employing mixed (carbonic) anhydrides have long been favoured in peptide synthesis because of their cost&#8208;effectiveness and less waste generation. Despite their long history, no study has compared the effects of additives on the activation of mixed anhydrides and carbonic anhydrides. In this study, we investigated the amidation of mixed (carbonic) anhydride in the presence of a base and/or Br&#248;nsted acids. The use of NMI&#8901;HCl significantly improved the conversion of the mixed carbonic anhydride, while expediting nucleophilic attacks on the desired carbonyl group. In contrast, in the case of mixed anhydrides, neither the conversion nor the desired nucleophilic attack improved significantly. We developed a C&#8208;terminus&#8208;free N&#8208;methylated peptide synthesis method using mixed carbonic anhydrides in a micro&#8208;flow reactor. Fourteen N&#8208;alkylated peptides were synthesized in moderate to high yields (55&#8211;99&#8201;%) without severe racemization (&lt;1&#8201;%). Additionally, a significant enhancement in the amidation between mixed carbonic anhydrides and bis&#8208;TMS&#8208;protected N&#8208;methyl amino acids with the inclusion of NMI&#8901;HCl was observed for the first time. In addition, we observed unexpected C&#8208;terminal epimerization of the C&#8208;terminus&#8208;free N&#8208;methyl peptides.

         <title>Organocatalyzed Asymmetric Conjugate Addition of Alcohols to &#946;&#8208;Fluoroalkyl Vinylsulfones by Bifunctional Phosphonium Salt Catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An asymmetric organocatalytic oxa&#8208;Michael reaction has been developed to synthesize chiral secondary alcohol derivatives with high yields and excellent enantioselectivities. Particularly noteworthy is the utilization of aliphatic alcohols as nucleophiles in the asymmetric oxa&#8208;Michael step, overcoming obstacles associated with their direct utilization as Michael donors. Furthermore, a sequential process offers a novel synthetic strategy for constructing essential fluorinated chiral alcohols from readily available materials.







Abstract
Chiral secondary alcohols, serving as essential structural motifs, hold significant potential for diverse applications. The exploration of effective synthetic strategies toward these compounds is both attractive and challenging. Herein, we present an asymmetric oxa&#8208;Michael reaction involving aliphatic alcohols as nucleophiles and &#946;&#8208;fluoroalkyl vinylsulfones catalyzed by bifunctional phosphonium salt (BPS), achieving high yields and excellent enantioselectivities (up to 98&#8201;% yield and 98&#8201;%&#8197;ee). Additionally, a sequential process including asymmetric oxa&#8208;Michael and debenzylation, facilitated by BPS/Lewis acid cooperation, was revealed for synthesizing diverse chiral secondary alcohol compounds in high yields (81&#8211;88&#8201;%) with consistent stereoselectivities. Furthermore, mechanistic explorations and subsequent results unveiled that the enantioselectivity originates from hydrogen&#8208;bonding and ion&#8208;pair interactions between the BPS catalyst and the substrates.

         <title>Synthesis, Characterization, and Cytotoxicity Evaluation of Novel Water&#8208;Soluble Cationic Platinum(II) Organometallic Complexes with Phenanthroline and Imidazolic Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We reported the synthesis of monofunctional platinum(II) complexes for anticancer evaluation. Remarkably, complex 4 demonstrated the most pronounced cytotoxicity across both cancer (HeLa and Caki&#8208;1) and normal cell lines (HK&#8208;2). In contrast, complex 3 displayed superior selectivity for tumor cells (Caki&#8208;1) compared to healthy cells (HK&#8208;2) among the examined complexes. So, complex 3 signifies a lead entity in a promising class of antitumor agents.







Abstract
Platinum&#8208;based chemotherapeutic agents are widely used in the treatment of cancer. However, their effectiveness is limited by severe adverse reactions, drug resistance, and poor water solubility. This study focuses on the synthesis and characterization of new water&#8208;soluble cationic monofunctional platinum(II) complexes starting from the [PtCl(&#951;1&#8208;C2H4OEt)(phen)] (1, phen=1,10&#8208;phenanthroline) precursor, specifically [Pt(NH3)(&#951;1&#8208;C2H4OEt)(phen)]Cl (2), [Pt(1&#8208;hexyl&#8208;1H&#8208;imidazole)(&#951;1&#8208;C2H4OEt)(phen)]Cl (3), and [Pt(1&#8208;hexyl&#8208;1H&#8208;benzo[d]imidazole)(&#951;1&#8208;C2H4OEt)(phen)]Cl (4), which deviate from traditional requirements for antitumor activity. These complexes were evaluated for their cytotoxic effects in comparison to cisplatin, using immortalized cervical adenocarcinoma cells (HeLa), human renal carcinoma cells (Caki&#8208;1), and normal human renal cells (HK&#8208;2). While complex 2 showed minimal effects on the cell lines, complexes 3 and 4 demonstrated higher cytotoxicity than cisplatin. Notably, complex 4 displayed the highest cytotoxicity in both cancer and normal cell lines. However, complex 3 exhibited the highest selectivity for renal tumor cells (Caki&#8208;1) among the tested complexes, compared to healthy cells (HK&#8208;2). This resulted in a significantly higher selectivity than that of cisplatin and complex 4. Therefore, complex 3 shows potential as a leading candidate for the development of a new generation of platinum&#8208;based anticancer drugs, utilizing biocompatible imidazole ligands while demonstrating promising anticancer properties.

         <title>Interaction of C60 with Methylammonium Lead Iodide Perovskite Surfaces: Unveiling the Role of C60 in Surface Engineering</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interaction of C60 on MAPbI3 perovskite surfaces has been systematically explored by means of periodic density functional simulations. The charge transfer from the perovskite to the C60 to increases due to the presence of defects like Pb vacancies or I antisites, and C60 is able to promote the surface reconstruction.







Abstract
Understanding the interaction between fullerene (C60) and perovskite surfaces is pivotal for advancing the efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells. In this study, we investigate the adsorption behavior of C60 on methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) surfaces using periodic density functional theory calculations. We explore various surface terminations and defect configurations to elucidate the influence of surface morphology on the C60&#8208;perovskite interaction, computing the adsorption energy and transfer of charge. Our results reveal distinct adsorption energies and charge transfer mechanisms for different surface terminations, shedding light on the role of surface defects in modifying the electronic structure and stability of perovskite materials. Furthermore, we provide insights into the potential of C60 to passivate surface defects, playing a relevant role in the surface reconstruction after the formation of defects. This comprehensive understanding of C60&#8208;perovskite interactions offers valuable guidelines about the role of fullerenes on surface structure and reconstruction.

         <title>Radiation&#8208;Induced Molecular Processes in DNA: A Perspective on Gas&#8208;Phase Interaction Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This perspective explores the technical developments towards crossed&#8208;beam studies of ionizing radiation with mass&#8208;selected and conformationally pure beams of oligonucleotide ions. It reviews key developments in the field and highlights challenges. The relevance of expected future results as benchmarks for quantum chemical calculations and for multiscale&#8208;modelling of radiation therapy is outlined.







Abstract
Studying the direct effects of DNA irradiation is essential for understanding the impact of radiation on biological systems. Gas&#8208;phase interactions are especially well suited to uncover the molecular mechanisms underlying these direct effects. Only relatively recently, isolated DNA oligonucleotides were irradiated by ionizing particles such as VUV or X&#8208;ray photons or ion beams, and ionic products were analyzed by mass spectrometry. This article provides a comprehensive review of primarily experimental investigations in this field over the past decade, emphasizing the description of processes such as ionization, fragmentation, charge and hydrogen transfer triggered by photoabsorption or ion collision, and the recent progress made thanks to specific atomic photoabsorption. Then, we outline ongoing experimental developments notably involving ion&#8208;mobility spectrometry, crossed beams or time&#8208;resolved measurements. The discussion extends to potential research directions for the future.

         <title>Silver&#8208;Catalyzed Carbofluorination of Olefins and &#945;&#8208;Fluoroolefins with Carbamoyl Radicals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A combination of silver oxide (Ag2O) catalyst, potassium persulfate (K2S2O8) and SelectfluorTM was identified to perform radical carbofluorination reactions of olefin and &#945;&#8208;fluoroolefin substrates with carbamoyl radicals generated in&#8197;situ from sodium oxamate salts. Both transformations proceed under mild conditions and provide respectively a straightforward access to &#946;&#8208;fluoroamides and &#946;,&#946;&#8208;difluoroamides.







Abstract
The reactivity of carbamoyl radicals, generated in&#8197;situ from sodium oxamate salts, has been investigated in the context of radical carbofluorination reactions of olefins and &#945;&#8208;fluoroolefins, respectively. Both transformations are catalyzed by silver salts and required the presence of potassium persulfate (K2S2O8) and SelectfluorTM as a radicophilic fluorine source. The reported methods provide a direct access to &#946;&#8208;fluoroamides and &#946;,&#946;&#8208;difluoroamides.

         <title>Keplerate&#8208;Type Polyoxometalates&#8208;Based Triboelectric Nanogenerator for Higher Performance via the Morphology Modulation of Blackberry Structure</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Keplerate&#8208;type Polyoxometalates (POMs) can self&#8208;assemble to form larger black strawberry structures. We prepare the larger roughness and higher surface potential of film through spin&#8208;coating, which is first used as the positive tribe&#8208;material in the triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs). The TENG has a higher heat resistance and stability and has been applied in the wearable era with better output performance.







Abstract
The tribe&#8208;material is the key factor affecting the performance of triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs). Inorganic materials have higher heat resistance and stability than widely used organic materials. However, the weaker tribe&#8208;property limits the application of TENGs. Modulating surface roughness by changing particle shape and size is a simple way to increase performance for TENGs. Polyoxometalates (POMs) have unrivalled structural diversity and can self&#8208;assemble to form different nanostructures. In this study, we propose [{(NH4)42[Mo72VIMo60VO372(CH3COO)30 (H2O)72]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;ca.300H2O&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;ca.CH3COONH4)}&#8208;Mo132] and [{Na8K14(VO)2[{(MoVI) (Mo5VIO21)(H2O)3]}10{(MoVI)Mo5VIO21(H2O)3 (SO4)}2{VIVO(H2O)20} {VIVO}10({KSO4}5)2]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;150H2O)}&#8208;Mo72V30] with blackberry structure which are cured and prepared into film by spin&#8208;coating technique, are used as positive tribe&#8208;materials for the first time in the field of TENGs. Keplerate&#8208;type POMs can form blackberry structures with higher dispersibility and flexibility, which can be used to control surface roughness by regulating the size of particles. The discovery proves that the particle size influences the surface roughness, which adjusts the output of TENGs. According to our findings, Mo132&#8208;h&#8208;TENG generates an output voltage of 29.3&#8197;V, an output charge of 8 Nc, which is 2&#8211;3 folds higher than Mo132&#8208;TENG, and a maximum power density of 6.25&#8197;mW&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;m&#8722;2 at 300&#8197;M&#937;. Our research provides that altering the dimensional size can be an available way to raise the output of TENGs.

         <title>The Role of Lysozyme in the Formation of Bioinspired Silicon Dioxide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mechanism of formation of silica templated by lysozyme is here interrogated using molecular dynamics simulations. The results strongly suggest that the &#8211; densely charged &#8211; protein electrostatically attracts the precursor and can thus accelerate the polycondensation reaction by increasing its concentration.







Abstract
Several organisms are able to polycondensate tetraoxosilicic(IV) acid to form silicon(IV) dioxide using polycationic molecules. According to an earlier mechanistic proposal, these molecules undergo a phase separation and recent experimental evidence appears to confirm this model. At the same time, polycationic proteins like lysozyme can also promote polycondensation of silicon(IV) dioxide, and they do so under conditions that are not compatible with liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation. In this manuscript we investigate this conundrum by molecular simulations.

At the same time, polycationic proteins like lysozyme can also promote polycondensation of silicon(IV) dioxide, and they do so under conditions that are not compatible with liquid-liquid phase separation. In this manuscript we investigate this conundrum by molecular simulations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Pyridinethiolate&#8208;Capped CdSe Quantum Dots for Red&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven H2 Production in Water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The utilization of low&#8208;energy sunlight to produce renewable fuels is a subject of great interest. Here we report the first example of metal chalcogenide quantum dots (QDs) capped with a pyridinethiolate carboxylic acid (pyS&#8208;COOH) for red&#8208;light&#8208;driven H2 production in water. The precious&#8208;metal&#8208;free system is robust over 240 h, and achieves a turnover number (TON) of 43910 &#177; 305 (vs Ni) with a rate of 31570 &#177; 1690 mmol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 for hydrogen production. In contrast to the inactive QDs capped with other thiolate ligands, the CdSe&#8208;pyS&#8208;COOH QDs give a significantly higher singlet oxygen quantum yield [&#934;&#916; (1O2)] in solution.</dc:description>

         <title>Dioxygen Activation by Gold(I)&#8208;Distorted Porphyrin Dinuclear Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Interactions between gold&#8208;based materials and dioxygen (O2) have motivated researchers to understand reaction mechanisms for O2 activation by homo&#8208; and heterogeneous gold catalysts. In this work, gold(I) porphyrin dinuclear complexes were synthesized with a saddle&#8208;distorted porphyrin ligand. The gold(I) porphyrin complexes showed unprecedented O2 activation in the presence of protic solvents to form gold(III) tetradentate porphyrin complexes. Mechanistic insights into the O2 activation by the gold(I) center were elucidated by spectroscopic measurements and theoretical calculations, revealing that dissociation of halides on the gold(I) center by alcohol solvents and hydrogen bonding of an N&#8211;H proton in the distorted porphyrin with dioxygen played important roles in establishing the unique reactivities of gold(I) complexes.</dc:description>

         <title>Rational Molecular Design of Diketopyrrolopyrrole&#8208;Based n&#8208;Type and Ambipolar Polymer Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP)&#8208;based polymer semiconductors have drawn great attention in the field of organic electronics due to the planar structure, decent solubilizing capability, and high crystallinity. However, the electron&#8208;deficient capacity of DPP derivatives are not strong enough, leading to relatively high&#8208;lying lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of the corresponding polymers. As a result, n&#8208;type and ambipolar DPP&#8208;based polymers are rare and their electron mobilities also lag far behind the p&#8208;type counterparts, which limits the development of important p&#8208;n&#8208;junction&#8208;based electronic devices. Therefore, new design strategies have been proposed recent years to develop n&#8208;type/ambipolar DPP&#8208;based polymers with improved performances. In this view, these molecular design strategies are summarized, including copolymerization of DPP with different acceptors and weak donors, DPP flanked aromatic ring modification, DPP&#8208;core ring expansion and DPP dimerization. The relationship between the chemical structures and organic thin&#8208;film transistor performances is intensively discussed. Finally, a perspective on future trends in the molecular design of DPP&#8208;based n&#8208;type/ambipolar polymers is also proposed.</dc:description>

         <title>An in&#8208;depth exploration of six decades of the Kr&#246;hnke pyridine synthesis &#8211; a review</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Kr&#246;hnke Pyridine Synthesis has been discovered about six decades ago (1961), by Fritz Kr&#246;hnke and Wilfried Zecher at the University of Giessen. The original method involved the reaction of &#945;&#8208;pyridinium methyl ketone salts with &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated carbonyl compounds in the presence of a nitrogen source, frequently ammonium acetate. Since its discovery, the Kr&#246;hnke methodology has been demonstrated to be suitable for the preparation of mono&#8208;, di&#8208;, tri&#8208; and tetra&#8208;pyridines, with important applications in several research fields. Over the years, a number of modifications to the original approach have been developed and reported, enabling for the broad applicability of these methods even in modern days, also for the synthesis of non&#8208;pyridine compounds. In this critical and tutorial review, we will thoroughly explore and discuss the potential of the original method, the refinements that have been made over the years, as well as some applications arising from each type of pyridine and/or non&#8208;pyridine compounds produced by Kr&#246;hnke&#8217;s approach.</dc:description>

         <title>Organic Reactions Enabled by Mechanical Force&#8208;Induced&#160;Single Electron Transfer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mechanochemical reactions, achieved through milling, grinding, or other mechanical actions, have emerged as a solvent&#8208;free alternative to traditional solution&#8208;based chemistry. Mechanochemistry not only provides the opportunity to eliminate bulk solvent use, reducing waste generation, but also unveils a new reaction strategy which enables the realization of reactions previously inaccessible in solution. While the majority of organic reactions facilitated by mechanical force traditionally follow two&#8208;electron transfer pathways similar to their solution&#8208;based counterparts, the field of mechanochemically induced single&#8208;electron transfer (SET) reactions has witnessed rapid development. This review outlines examples of mechanochemical reactions facilitated by the SET process, focusing on the reagents that initiate SET, thereby positioning mechanochemistry as a burgeoning field within the realm of single&#8208;electron chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Characterizing the Oligomers Distribution along the Aggregation Pathway of Amyloid A&#946;1&#8208;40 by NMR</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A&#946;1&#8208;40 seed&#8208;free sample is recovered after rapid isomerization of 26&#8208;O&#8208;acyl isoA&#946;1&#8208;40 at neutral pH. NMR 1D 1H spectra and diffusion measurements collected over time, coupled with their analysis through the Inverse Laplace Transform reconstruction method, detect changes in the oligomeric distribution along the aggregation pathway of amyloid A&#946;1&#8208;40. The presented approach emerges as a valuable tool in drug discovery.







Abstract
This study delves into the early aggregation process of the A&#946;1&#8208;40 amyloid peptide, elucidating the associated oligomers distribution. Motivated by the acknowledged role of small oligomers in the neurotoxic damage linked to Alzheimer's disease, we present an experimental protocol for preparing 26&#8208;O&#8208;acyl isoA&#946;1&#8208;40, a modified A&#946;1&#8208;40 peptide facilitating rapid isomerization to the native amide form at neutral pH. This ensures seed&#8208;free solutions, minimizing experimental variability. Additionally, we demonstrate the efficacy of coupling NMR diffusion ordered spectroscopy (DOSY) with the Inverse Laplace Transform (ILT) reconstruction method, for effective characterization of early aggregation processes. This innovative approach efficiently maps oligomers distributions across a wide spectrum of initial peptide concentrations offering unique insights into the evolution of oligomers relative populations. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach assessing the impact of Epigallocathechin gallate, a known remodeling agent of amyloid fibrils, on the oligomeric distributions of aggregated A&#946;1&#8208;40. The DOSY&#8208;ILT proposed approach stands as a robust and discriminating asset, providing a powerful strategy for rapidly gaining insight into potential inhibitors&#8217; impact on the aggregation process.

         <title>Aggregation mechanisms and molecular structures of amyloid&#8208;&#946; in Alzheimer&#8217;s disease</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Amyloid plaques&#160;are a major pathological hallmark involved in Alzheimer&#8217;s disease and consist of&#160;deposits of the amyloid&#8208;&#946; peptide (A&#946;). The aggregation process of A&#946; is highly complex, which leads to polymorphous aggregates with different structures. In addition to aberrant aggregation, A&#946; oligomers can&#160;undergo liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation and form dynamic condensates. It has been hypothesized that these amyloid liquid droplets affect and modulate amyloid fibril formation.&#160;In this review, we briefly introduce the relationship between stress granules and amyloid protein aggregation that is associated with neurodegenerative diseases. Then we highlight the&#160;regulatory&#160;role of liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation in A&#946; aggregation and discuss the potential relationship between A&#946; phase transition and aggregation. Furthermore, we summarize the current structures of A&#946; oligomers and amyloid fibrils, which have been determined using nuclear magnetic resonance and cryo&#8208;electron microscopy. The structural variations of A&#946; aggregates provide an explanation for the different levels of toxicity, shed light on the aggregation mechanism and may pave the way towards structure&#8208;based drug design for both clinical diagnosis and treatment.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Parahydrogen&#8208;induced polarization (PHIP) is an emerging technique to enhance the signal of stable isotope metabolic contrast agents for Magnetic Resonance (MR). The objective of this study is to continue establishing 1&#8208;13C&#8208;pyruvate&#8208;d3, signal&#8208;enhanced via PHIP, as a hyperpolarized contrast agent, obtained in seconds, to monitor metabolism in human cancer. Our focus was on human pancreatic and colon tumor xenografts. 1&#8208;13C&#8208;vinylpyruvate&#8208;d6 was hydrogenated using parahydrogen. Thereafter, the polarization of the protons was transferred to 13C. Following a workup procedure, the free hyperpolarized 1&#8208;13C&#8208;pyruvate&#8208;d3 was obtained in clean aqueous solution. After injection into animals bearing either pancreatic or colon cancer xenografts, slice&#8208;selective MR spectra were acquired and analyzed to determine rate constants of metabolic conversion into lactate and alanine. 1&#8208;13C&#8208;pyruvate&#8208;d3 proved to follow the increased metabolic rate to lactate and alanine in the tumor xenografts.</dc:description>

         <title>Zn promoted GaZrOx Ternary Solid Solution Oxide Combined with SAPO&#8208;34 Effectively Converts CO2 to Light Olefins with Low CO Selectivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this paper, Zn was introduced into GaZrOx to construct ZnGaZrOx ternary oxides, which was combined with SAPO&#8208;34 for CO2 hydrogenation to light olefins. The ZnGaZrOx significantly enhanced the spillover H2 effect and also induced the generation of abundant oxygen vacancies to effectively promote the activation of CO2, thereby the ZnGaZrOx/SAPO&#8208;34 bifunctional catalysts exhibited excellent catalytic performance.







Abstract
We proposed a new strategy for CO2 hydrogenation to prepare light olefins by introducing Zn into GaZrOx to construct ZnGaZrOx ternary oxides, which was combined with SAPO&#8208;34 to prepare a high&#8211;performance ZnGaZrOx/SAPO&#8208;34 tandem catalyst for CO2 hydrogenation to light olefins. By optimizing the Zn doping content, the ratio and mode of the two&#8211;phase composite, and the process conditions, the 3.5&#8201;%ZnGaZrOx/SAPO&#8208;34 tandem catalyst showed excellent catalytic performance and good high&#8211;temperature inhibition of the reverse water&#8211;gas shift (RWGS) reaction. The catalyst achieved 26.6&#8201;% CO2 conversion, 82.1&#8201;% C2=&#8722;C4= selectivity and 11.8&#8201;% light olefins yield. The ZnGaZrOx formed by introducing an appropriate amount of Zn into GaZrOx significantly enhanced the spillover H2 effect and also induced the generation of abundant oxygen vacancies to effectively promote the activation of CO2. Importantly, the RWGS reaction was also significantly suppressed at high temperatures, with the CO selectivity being only 46.1&#8201;% at 390&#8201;&#176;C.

         <title>Directly&#8208;Fused Ni(II)Porphyrin Conjugated Polymers with Blocked meso&#8208;Positions: Impact on Electrocatalytic Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates the synthesis via chemical vapor deposition of directly fused porphyrins conjugated polymers from Ni(II)porphyrin with blocked meso&#8208;positions. The electrochemical findings highlight that multiple direct fusion (&#946;&#8208;&#946;/meso&#8208;meso/&#946;&#8208;&#946; or meso&#8208;&#946;/&#946;&#8208;meso) is essential for the Ni(II) porphyrin&#8208;based conjugated polymer to operate via a dinuclear radical oxo&#8208;coupling (ROC) mechanism for water oxidation at low overpotential and ensure durable catalytic properties.







Abstract
The oxidative coupling reaction of two Ni(II) porphyrins meso&#8208;substituted with three and four phenyl groups, Ni(II) 5,10,15&#8208;(triphenyl)porphyrin (NiPh3P) and Ni(II) 5,10,15,20&#8208;(tetraphenyl)porphyrin (NiPh4P) respectively, was investigated in a oxidative chemical vapor deposition (oCVD) process. Irrespective of the number of meso&#8208;substituents, high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry evidences the formation of oligomeric species containing up to five porphyrin units. UV&#8208;Vis&#8208;NIR and XPS analyses of the oCVD films highlighted a strong dependence of the intermolecular coupling reaction with the substrate temperature. Specifically, higher substrate temperatures yield lowering of valence band maxima and reduction of the band gap. The formation of conjugated polymeric assemblies results in increased conductivities as compared to their sublimed counterparts. Yet, electrocatalytic measurements exhibit water oxidation onset overpotentials (308&#8197;mV for pNiPh3P and 343&#8197;mV for pNiPh4P) comparatively higher than the onset overpotential measured for the oCVD film from Ni(II) 5,15&#8208;(diphenyl)porphyrin (pNiPh2P), i.&#8201;e. 283&#8197;mV. Although DFT and comparative oCVD studies suggest the formation of directly fused porphyrins involving &#8216;phenyl&#8208;mediated&#8217; and &#946;&#8208;&#946; linkages when reacting tetra&#8208;meso&#8208;substituted porphyrins, the present findings highlight that multiple direct fusion (&#946;&#8208;&#946;/meso&#8208;meso/&#946;&#8208;&#946; or meso&#8208;&#946;/&#946;&#8208;meso) is essential for Ni(II) porphyrin&#8208;based conjugated polymers to enable a dinuclear radical oxo&#8208;coupling operating mechanism for water oxidation at low overpotential and durable catalytic activity.

         <title>Determining Structures of Layer&#8208;by&#8208;Layer Spin&#8208;Coated Zinc Dicarboxylate&#8208;Based Metal&#8208;Organic Thin Films</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structures of metal&#8208;organic thin films obtained from layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer spin&#8208;coating are determined by combining grazing&#8208;incidence wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering and ab&#8197;initio density functional theory simulations. The Zn2+&#8208;to&#8208;dicarboxylic linker molar ratio used for spin&#8208;coating pivotally influences the resulting structure. High excess of Zn2+ generates dicarboxylate&#8208;intercalated layered zinc hydroxides, whereas equimolar ratios or slight excess of the linker yield metal&#8208;(hydroxide&#8208;)organic frameworks.







Abstract
Thin films of crystalline solids with substantial free volume built from organic chromophores and metal secondary building units (SBUs) are promising for engineering new optoelectronic properties through control of interchromophore coupling. Zn&#8208;based SBUs are especially relevant in this case because they avoid quenching the chromophore's luminescence. We find that layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer spin&#8208;coating using Zn acetate dihydrate and benzene&#8208;1,4&#8208;dicarboxylic acid (H2BDC) and biphenyl&#8208;4,4&#8217;&#8208;dicarboxylic acid (H2BPDC) linkers readily produces crystalline thin films. However, analysis of the grazing&#8208;incidence wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (GIWAXS) data reveals the structures of these films vary significantly with the linker, and with the metal&#8208;to&#8208;linker molar ratio used for fabrication. Under equimolar conditions, H2BPDC creates a type of structure like that proposed for SURMOF&#8208;2, whereas H2BDC generates a different metal&#8208;hydroxide&#8208;organic framework. Large excess of Zn2+ ions causes the growth of layered zinc hydroxides, irrespective of the linker used. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations provide structural models with minimum total energy that are consistent with the experimentally observed diffractograms. In the broader sense, this work illustrates the importance in this field of careful structure determination, e.&#8201;g., by utilizing GIWAXS and DFT simulations to determine the structure of the obtained crystalline metal&#8208;organic thin films, such that properties can be rationally engineered and explained.

         <title>Biocompatible Synthesis of Macrocyclic Thiazol(in)e Peptides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Discover a biocompatible method to synthesize macrocyclic peptides with thiazoline heterocycles. Learn how a cleavable linker enables direct installation of a reactive nitrile group at the peptide C&#8208;terminus during solid&#8208;phase synthesis. Explore the transformation of the peptide's thiazoline into thiazole or cysteine through oxidation or hydrolysis, unlocking the potential of three classes of macrocyclic peptides in one synthesis.







Abstract
Macrocyclic peptides containing a thiazole or thiazoline in the backbone are considered privileged structures in both natural compounds and drug discovery, owing to their enhanced bioactivity, stability, and permeability. Here, we present the biocompatible synthesis of macrocyclic peptides from N&#8208;terminal cysteine and C&#8208;terminal nitrile. While the N&#8208;terminal cysteine is incorporated during solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis, the C&#8208;terminal nitrile is introduced during cleavage with aminoacetonitrile, utilizing a cleavable benzotriazole linker. This method directly yields the fully functionalized linear peptide precursor. The biocompatible cyclization reaction occurs in buffer at physiological pH and room temperature. The resulting thiazoline heterocycle remains stable in buffer but hydrolyzes under acidic conditions. While such hydrolysis enables access to macrocyclic peptides with a complete amide backbone, mild oxidation of the thiazoline leads to the stable thiazole macrocyclic peptide. While conventional oxidation strategies involve metals, we developed a protocol simply relying on alkaline salt and air. Therefore, we offer a rapid and metal&#8208;free pathway to macrocyclic thiazole peptides, featuring a biocompatible key cyclization step.

         <title>Reassignment of the Structure of a Tryptophan&#8208;Containing Cyclic Tripeptide Produced by the Biarylitide Crosslinking Cytochrome P450blt</title>

The crosslinked Tyr&#8208;Leu&#8208;Trp peptide produced by the biarylitide crosslinking cytochrome P450Blt from Micromonospora sp. MW&#8208;13 has been reanalysed by NMR, computational and isotope labelling experiments and shown to contain a C&#8722;N rather than a C&#8722;O bond. In vivo experiments using this peptide show there is a general tolerance of biarylitide crosslinking P450 enzymes for histidine to tryptophan mutations within their minimal peptide substrate sequences.







Abstract
The structure of the sidechain crosslinked Tyr&#8208;Leu&#8208;Trp peptide produced by the biarylitide crosslinking cytochrome P450Blt from Micromonospora sp. MW&#8208;13 has been reanalysed by a series of NMR, computational and isotope labelling experiments and shown to contain a C&#8722;N rather than a C&#8722;O bond. Additional in&#8197;vivo experiments using such a modified peptide show there is a general tolerance of biarylitide crosslinking P450 enzymes for histidine to tryptophan mutations within their minimal peptide substrate sequences despite the lack of such residues noted in natural biarylitide gene clusters. This work further highlights the impressive ability of P450s from biarylitide biosynthesis pathways to act as biocatalysts for the formation of a range of sidechain crosslinked tripeptides.

         <title>Cold Pressing of Perovskite&#8208;ZIF Glass Interpenetrating Networks with Stable Photoelectric Response</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cold pressing synthesis: The (agZIF&#8208;62)0.5(CsPbBr3)0.5 composite material is prepared using a ball milling and cold pressing technique. The interpenetrating network of perovskite&#8208;ZIF glass within the composite material contributes to enhanced fluorescent emission and lifetime. The optoelectronic device fabricated from this composite material exhibits excellent air stability, retaining 97.6&#8201;% of the initial current after 2000&#8197;hours.







Abstract
The protection of lead halide perovskite within a stable matrix normally leads to the loss of semiconducting properties. Here, we report the synthesis of perovskite&#8208;ZIF glass interpenetrating networks via a cold pressing method, which allows the advantages of bright photoluminescence, high photoconductivity and environmental stability. This hybrid architecture has provided a novel design strategy for the real&#8208;world application of perovskite&#8208;based devices.

         <title>Nitrogen Fixation by Manganese Complexes &#8211; Waiting for the Rush?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the context of nitrogen fixation, manganese complexes seem to be set back when compared to other early&#8208;to&#8208;mid transition metals. This does not reflect the rush this metal has experienced in homogeneous hydrogenation catalysis and related processes. Giving an overview of the relevant literature, the authors attempt to answer why this metal has not yet made its breakthrough in N2 activation.







Abstract
Manganese is currently experiencing a great deal of attention in homogeneous catalysis as a sustainable alternative to platinum group metals due to its abundance, affordable price and low toxicity. While homogeneous nitrogen fixation employing well&#8208;defined transition metal complexes has been an important part of coordination chemistry, manganese derivatives have been only sporadically used in this research area. In this contribution, the authors systematically cover manganese organometallic chemistry related to N2 activation spanning almost 60&#8197;years, identify apparent pitfalls and outline encouraging perspectives for its future development.

         <title>Synthesis of Diverse Allylic Sulfone Derivatives via Sequential Hydroalkoxylation of 1,3&#8208;Enynes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A first metal&#8208;free protocol for the synthesis of allylic sulfones featuring aldehyde functionality at the &#948;&#8208;position has been reported. The present approach allows facile installation of acetal groups within the allylic sulfone scaffold, providing versatile platforms for further functionalization and drug development.







Abstract
A first metal&#8208;free protocol for the synthesis of allylic sulfones featuring aldehyde functionality at the &#948;&#8208;position has been reported. The formation of structurally complex &#948;,&#948;&#8208;dimethoxy allylic sulfones is enabled by the direct nucleophilic attack of methoxide onto the sulfone&#8208;containing 1,3&#8208;enynes. The present approach allows facile installation of acetal groups within the allylic sulfone scaffold, providing versatile platforms for further functionalization and drug development.

         <title>Ionic Porous Aromatic Frameworks Embedding Polyoxometalates for Heterogeneous Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multivariate ionic porous aromatic framework (MTV&#8208;iPAFs) material (PAF&#8208;270) was synthesized from a multivariable synthesis strategy, which specific surface area was 724&#8197;m2&#8201;g&#8722;1, and had hierarchical structure. Leveraging its physical and chemical properties, PAF&#8208;270 was availability for polyoxometalates loading and heterogeneous catalysis.







Abstract
Porous aromatic frameworks (PAFs) are highly promising functional porous solids known for their feasible amenability and extraordinary stability. When the framework was modified by ionic functional groups, these ionic PAFs (iPAFs) exhibited charged channels for adsorption, separation, and catalysis. However, the surface areas of ionic porous frameworks are usually lower than that of neutral frameworks, and their synthesis is limited by specific strategies and complex modification processes. To address these challenges, an intuitive route to construct ionic porous framework with high specific surface area was proposed. Herein, a multivariate ionic porous aromatic framework (MTV&#8208;iPAFs, named PAF&#8208;270) was synthesized using readily available building units with ionic functional groups through a multivariable synthesis strategy. PAF&#8208;270 exhibited hierarchical structure with the highest specific surface area among reported imidazolium&#8208;functionalized PAFs. Utilizing its physical and chemical properties, the availability for polyoxometalate loading and heterogeneous catalysis of PAF&#8208;270 were explored. PAF&#8208;270 exhibited a high adsorption capacity up to 50&#8201;% for both H3O40PW12 (HPW) and (NH4)5H6PV8Mo4O40 (V8). HPW@PAF&#8208;270 and V8@PAF&#8208;270 exhibited excellent catalytic abilities for oleic acid esterification and extractive oxidative desulfurization, respectively. Due to the stability of PAFs, these materials also showed remarkable resistance to temperature and pH changes. Overall, these results underscore the potential application of MTV&#8208;iPAFs as versatile functional porous materials.

         <title>A Prebiotic Pathway to Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Enzymes play a fundamental role in cellular metabolism. A wide range of enzymes require the presence of complementary coenzymes and cofactors to function properly. While coenzymes are believed to have been part of the last universal ancestor (LUCA) or have been present even earlier, the syntheses of crucial coenzymes like the redox&#8208;active coenzymes flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) or nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) remain challenging. Here, we present a pathway to NAD+ under prebiotic conditions starting with ammonia, cyanoacetaldehyde, prop&#8208;2&#8208;ynal and sugar&#8208;forming precursors, yielding in situ the nicotinamide riboside. Regioselective phosphorylation and water stable light activated adenosine monophosphate derivatives allow for topographically and irradiation&#8208;controlled formation of NAD+. Our findings indicate that NAD+, a coenzyme vital to life, can be formed non&#8208;enzymatically from simple organic feedstock molecules via photocatalytic activation under prebiotically plausible early Earth conditions in a continuous process under aqueous conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Is the E/Z Iminium Ratio a Good Enantioselectivity Predictor in Iminium Catalysis?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing new enantioselective reactions is an important part of chemical discovery but requires time and resources to test large arrays of potential reaction conditions. New techniques are required to analyse many different reactions quickly and efficiently. Mass spectrometry is a high&#8208;throughput method; when combined with ion&#8208;mobility spectrometry, this technique can monitor diastereomeric reaction intermediates and thus be a handle to study enantioselective reactions. Through this technique and others, it was noted before that in the organocatalytic 1,4&#8208;addition to &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes, the abundance of initial diastereomeric intermediates correlates strongly to that of the final enantiomeric products. This work determines isomeric abundance for various catalysts and aldehydes and uses it to predict the enantiomeric excess of two control reactions. The prediction matches well for one reaction but does not predict the obtained results for the second. This finding confirms that the E/Z ratio of the iminium intermediates can be used as a predictor for some reactions, but the kinetics of the following steps can dramatically change the true enantioselectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Modulating Helix&#8208;preference of an Axially&#8208;twisted Molecular Scaffold Through Diastereomeric Salt Formation with Tartaric Acid Stereoisomers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we designed a chiral, axially&#8208;twisted molecular scaffold (ATMS) using pyridine&#8208;2,6&#8208;dicarboxamide (PDC) unit as pivot, chiral trans&#8208;cyclohexanediamine (CHDA) residues as linkers, and pyrene residues as fluorescent reporters. R,R&#8208;ATMS exclusively adopted M&#8208;helicity and produced differential response in UV&#8208;vis, fluorescence, and NMR upon addition of tartaric acid (TA) stereoisomers allowing naked&#8208;eye detection and enantiomeric excess determination. Circular dichroism (CD) profile of R,R&#8208;ATMS underwent unique changes during titration with TA stereoisomers &#8211; while loss of CD signal at 345 nm was observed with equimolar D&#8208;TA and meso&#8208;TA, inversion was seen with equimolar L&#8208;TA. Temperature increase weakened these interactions to partially recover the original CD signature of R,R&#8208;ATMS. 2D NMR studies also indicated the significant structural changes in R,R&#8208;ATMS in the solution state upon addition of L&#8208;TA. Single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) studies on the crystals of the R,R&#8208;ATMS&#8835;D&#8208;TA salt revealed the interacting partners stacked in arrays and ATMS molecules stabilized by &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking between its PDC and pyrene residues. Contrastingly, tightly&#8208;packed supramolecular cages comprised of four molecules each of R,R&#8208;ATMS and L&#8208;TA were seen in R,R&#8208;ATMS&#8835;L&#8208;TA salt, and the ATMS molecules contorted to achieve CH&#8208;&#960; interactions between its pyrene residues. These results may have implications in modulating the helicity of topologically&#8208;similar larger biomolecules.</dc:description>

R,R-ATMS exclusively adopted M-helicity and produced differential response in UV-vis, fluorescence, and NMR upon addition of tartaric acid (TA) stereoisomers allowing naked-eye detection and enantiomeric excess determination. Circular dichroism (CD) profile of R,R-ATMS underwent unique changes during titration with TA stereoisomers &#8211; while loss of CD signal at 345 nm was observed with equimolar D-TA and meso-TA, inversion was seen with equimolar L-TA.

         <title>Unimolecular Decomposition Mechanism of Trimethyl Phosphate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Trimethyl phosphate (TMP), an organophosphorus compound (OPC), is a promising fire&#8208;retardant candidate for lithium&#8208;ion battery (LIB) electrolytes to mitigate fire spread. This study aims to understand the mechanism of TMP unimolecular thermal decomposition to support the integration of a TMP chemical kinetic model into a LIB electrolyte surrogate model. Reactive intermediates and products of TMP thermal decomposition were experimentally detected using vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) synchrotron radiation and double imaging photoelectron photoion coincidence (i2PEPICO) spectroscopy. Phosphorus&#8208;containing intermediates such as PO, HPO and HPO2 were identified. Sampling effects could successfully be obviated thanks to photoion imaging, which also showed evidence for isomerization reactions upon wall collisions in the ionization chamber. Quantum chemical calculations performed for the unimolecular decomposition of TMP revealed for the first time that isomerization channels via hydrogen and methyl transfer (barrier heights of 65.9 and 72.6 kcal/mol, respectively) are the lowest&#8208;energy primary steps of TMP decomposition followed by CH3OH/CH3/CH2O or dimethyl ether (DME) production, respectively. We found an analogous DME production channel in the unimolecular decomposition of dimethyl methylphosphonate (DMMP), another important OPC fire&#8208;retardant additive with a similar molecular structure to TMP, which are not included in currently available chemical kinetic models.</dc:description>

         <title>Improving Molecular Dynamics Simulations for Solid&#8208;Liquid Interface with Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Emerging developments in artificial intelligence have opened infinite possibilities for material simulation. Depending on the powerful fitting of machine learning algorithms to first&#8208;principles data, machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) can effectively balance the accuracy and efficiency problems in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, serving as powerful tools in various complex physicochemical systems. Consequently, this brings unprecedented enthusiasm for researchers to apply such novel technology in multiple fields to revisit the major scientific problems that have remained controversial owing to the limitations of previous computational methods. Herein, we introduce the evolution of MLIPs, provide valuable application examples for solid&#8211;liquid interfaces, and present current challenges. Driven by solving multitudinous difficulties in terms of the accuracy, efficiency, and versatility of MLIPs, this booming technique, combined with molecular simulation methods, will provide an underlying and valuable understanding of interdisciplinary scientific challenges, including materials, physics, and chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Photo&#8208;Induced Generation of Oxygenated Quaternary Centers via EnT Enabled Singlet O2 Addition to C3&#8208;Maleimidated Quinoxaline: A Reagent&#8208;Less Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A reagent&#8208;less sensitizer&#8208;free photo&#8208;induced access of oxygenated centers via hindered tertiary hydroxylation (Csp3&#8208;H) and intramolecular spiro&#8208;etherification (Csp3&#8208;H/Csp2&#8208;H) of photo&#8208;responsive C3&#8208;maleimidated quinoxaline has been demonstrated. This is an illustrative example of a tautomeric reacting substrate&#8208;induced singlet oxygen up&#8208;taken divergent photo&#8208;oxygenation, guided by the use of a suitable solvent.







Abstract
Demonstrated here is an external photo&#8208;sensitizer&#8208;free (auto&#8208;sensitized) singlet oxygen&#8208;enabled solvent&#8208;dependent tertiary hydroxylation and aryl&#8208;alkyl spiro&#8208;etherification of C3&#8208;maleimidated quinoxalines. Such &#8220;reagent&#8208;less&#8221; photo&#8208;oxygenation at Csp3&#8208;H and etherification involving Csp3&#8208;H/Csp2&#8208;H are unparalleled. Possibly, the highly &#960;&#8208;conjugated N&#8208;H tautomer allows the substrate to get excited by irradiation, and subsequently, it attains the triplet state via ISC. This excited triplet&#8208;state sensitized molecule then transfers its energy to a triplet&#8208;state oxygen (3O2) generating reactive singlet oxygen (1O2) for hydroxylation and spirocyclization depending on the solvent used. In HFIP, the generated alkoxy radical accepts a proton via HAT giving hydroxylated product. In contrast, in an aprotic PhCl it underwent a radical addition at the ortho&#8208;position of the C2 aryl to provide spiro&#8208;ether. An unprecedented orthogonal spiro&#8208;etherification was observed via the displacement of o&#8208;substitutents for ortho (&#8722;OEt, &#8722;OMe, &#8722;F, &#8722;Cl, &#8722;Br) substituted substrates. The order of ipso substitution follows the trend &#8722;OMe&gt;&#8722;OEt&gt;&#8722;F&gt;&#8722;H&gt;&#8722;Cl&gt;&#8722;Br. Both these oxygenation reactions can be carried out with nearly equal ease using direct sunlight without the requirement of any elaborate reaction setup. Demonstration of large&#8208;scale synthesis and a few interesting transformations have also been realized. Furthermore, several insightful control experiments and quantum chemical computations were performed to unravel the mechanism.

         <title>Oriented Metal&#8208;organic Framework Membranes for Molecular Separations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review discusses recent progress made in oriented metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) membranes for energy&#8208;efficient separation. Diverse synthetic protocols, including counter&#8208;diffusion interfacial synthesis, current&#8208;driven synthesis, and modular assembly, are systematically introduced. Furthermore, their emerging applications towards addressing environmental and industrial challenges, are highlighted.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) membranes, which are recognized as state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art platforms applied in various separation processes, have attracted widespread attention. Nonetheless, to overcome the trade&#8208;off between permeability and selectivity, which is crucial for achieving efficient separation, it is important to rationally design and manipulate MOF membrane structure. Given remarkable advances in the past decade, a timely summary of recent advancement in this field has become indispensable. This review introduces major strategies for fabricating oriented MOF membranes, including in&#8197;situ growth, contra&#8208;diffusion method, interface&#8208;assisted approach, and laminated nanosheet assembly. New insights into their updated progress and potential are elucidated. Of particular note, recent development and emerging applications of oriented MOF membranes, illustrating their potential to address environmental and energy challenges, are highlighted. Finally, remaining challenges facing their bath production and practical applications are discussed.

         <title>Ruthenium(II) Polypyridyl Complexes with Benzoxazole Derivatives and Non&#8208;Innocent Ligands as Effective Antioxidants in Human Neuroblasts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of benzoxazole derivatives with non&#8208;innocent ligands in the same ruthenium(II) polypyridyl complex is a suitable strategy to design new pharmacological tools with ROS&#8208;scavenging activity against pro&#8208;apoptotic/pro&#8208;oxidant molecules challenge in human differentiated neuroblasts. The antioxidant properties of such systems are likely the result of a non&#8208;trivial synergetic action involving the bioactive ligands in their chemical architectures. The decrease of oxidative stress by these ruthenium(II) systems exerts both pro&#8208;survival effect and anti&#8208;inflammatory activity in human differentiated neuroblasts.







Abstract
Ruthenium(II) polypyridyl complexes continue to raise increasing interest for the encouraging results in several biomedical areas. Considering their vast chemical&#8208;physical repertoire, in particular the possibility to switch from the sensitization of reactive oxygen species (ROS) to ROS&#8208;scavenging abilities by tuning the nature of their ligands, it is therefore surprising that their potential as antioxidants has not been largely investigated so far. Herein, we explored the antioxidant behaviour of the novel ruthenium compound [Ru(dbpy)(2,3&#8208;DAN)Cl]PF6 (Ru1), featuring a benzoxazole derivative (dpby=2,6&#8208;bis(4&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;benzoxazolyl)pyridine) and the non&#8208;innocent 2,3&#8208;diamminonaftalene (2,3&#8208;DAN) ligand, along with the reference tpy&#8208;containing analogue [Ru(tpy)(2,3&#8208;DAN)Cl]PF6 (Ru2) (tpy=2,2&#8217;:6&#8217;,2&#8217;&#8217;&#8208;terpyridine). Following the synthesis and the electrochemical characterization, chemical antioxidant assays highlighted the beneficial role of dpby for the ROS&#8208;scavenging properties of Ru1. These data have been corroborated by the highest protective effect of Ru1 against the oxidative stress induced in SH&#8208;SY5Y human neuroblastoma, which exerts pro&#8208;survival and anti&#8208;inflammatory actions. The results herein reported highlight the potential of Ru1 as pharmacological tool in neurodegenerative diseases and specially prove that the antioxidant properties of such compounds are likely the result of a non&#8208;trivial synergetic action involving the bioactive ligands in their chemical architectures.

         <title>Exploring the Role of Central Metals in Bulky Phthalocyanines for Dye&#8208;Sensitized Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of metallo&#8208;(Zn(II), Mg(II) and Ru(II)) and free&#8208;base phthalocyanines (Pcs) with a carboxyl anchoring group and either tert&#8208;butyl or bulky 2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenoxy peripheral substituents were synthesized and tested as sensitizer in DSSCs to shed light on the role of central metals in photovoltaic performance. Regardless of peripheral substitution, the trend of photovoltaic efficiencies followed the order Zn(II)Pc&gt;Mg(II)Pc&#8811;H2Pc &#8776; Ru(II)Pc.







Abstract
Two series of metallo&#8208;(Zn(II), Mg(II), and Ru(II)) and free&#8208;base phthalocyanines (Pcs) with a carboxyl anchoring group and well&#8208;established bulky peripheral substituents (either tert&#8208;butyl or bulky 2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenoxy) were synthesized and tested as sensitizers in dye&#8208;sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). The trend of photovoltaic efficiencies (PCEs) for free&#8208;base and metallo Pcs followed the order Zn(II)Pc&gt;Mg(II)Pc&#8811;H2Pc &#8776; Ru(II)Pc regardless of the peripheral substitution. Higher efficiencies (4.95 versus 3.63 for the Zn(II) derivatives) were achieved with Pcs bearing the bulkier 2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenoxy group, indicating a lower aggregation and more suitable HOMO&#8208;LUMO levels. Furthermore, these derivatives showed a morelevant influence of the metal on the PCE values (from the highest 4.95 for the Zn(II)Pc to the lowest 0.23 for the Ru(II)Pc. In both series, the best PCEs observed with the Zn(II) derivatives were mainly due to their highest Jsc values. The lowest efficiencies found for the free&#8208;bases and Ru(II) derivatives were attributed to a mismatch between their LUMO levels and the conduction band of the TiO2,and lower light&#8208;harvesting capabilities, respectively. In conclusion, Zn(II) derivatives are still the best Pc candidates to use as sensitizers in molecular photovoltaics.

         <title>Selective Electrochemical Oxygen Reduction to Hydrogen Peroxide by Confinement of Cobalt Porphyrins in a Metal&#8208;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sustainable alternatives for the energy intensive synthesis of H2O2 are necessary. Molecular cobalt catalysts show potential but are typically restricted by undesired bimolecular pathways leading to the breakdown of both H2O2 and the catalyst. The confinement of cobalt porphyrins in the PCN&#8208;224 metal&#8208;organic framework leads to an enhanced selectivity towards H2O2 and stability of the catalyst. Consequently, oxygen can now be selectively reduced to hydrogen peroxide with a stable conversion for at least 5 h, illustrating the potential of catalysts confined in MOFs to increase the selectivity and stability of electrocatalytic conversions.</dc:description>

         <title>Advancements and Challenges in the Synthesis of Oxymethylene Ethers (OMEs) as Sustainable Transportation Fuels</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The urgent need for sustainable alternatives to fossil fuels in the transportation sector is driving research into novel energy carriers that can meet the high energy density requirements of heavy&#8208;duty vehicles without exacerbating the climate change. This concept article examines the synthesis, mechanisms, and challenges associated with oxymethylene ethers (OMEs), a promising class of synthetic fuels potentially derived from carbon dioxide and hydrogen. We highlight the importance of OMEs in the transition towards non&#8208;fossil energy sources due to their compatibility with the existing Diesel infrastructure and their cleaner combustion profile. The synthesis mechanisms, including the Schulz&#8208;Flory distribution and its implications for OME chain length specificity, and the role of various catalysts and starting materials are discussed in depth. Despite advancements in the field, significant challenges remain, such as overcoming the Schulz&#8208;Flory distribution, efficiently managing water byproducts, and improving the overall energy efficiency of the OME synthesis. Addressing these challenges is crucial for OMEs to become a viable alternative fuel, contributing to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and the transition to a sustainable energy future in the transportation sector.</dc:description>

         <title>Total Synthesis of (15R)&#8208; and (15S)&#8208;Prostaglandin A2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>From both pharmaceutical and structural perspectives, the large family of prostaglandins represent a truly remarkable class of natural products. Prostaglandin A2 is a tissue hormone naturally found in human seminal plasma and in the sea whip Plexaura homomalla with yet poorly understood biological or therapeutic effects. Herein, a novel strategy for the stereoselective construction of both naturally occurring prostaglandin A2 epimers and first insights into their functional effects on the major inhibitory neurotransmitter &#947;&#8208;aminobutyric acid (GABA) type A receptors (GABAAR) are provided. The synthesis of both epimers was achieved in only 11 steps starting from commercially available 2,5&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;tetrahydrofuran employing an organocatalytic domino&#8208;aldol reaction, a Mizoroki&#8208;Heck reaction, a Wittig reaction as well as an oxidation&#8208;decarboxylation sequence. The (15R)&#8208;epimer significantly reduced GABA&#8208;induced currents through GABAA receptors while its (15S)&#8208;epimer did not show any significant effect.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;From both pharmaceutical and structural perspectives, the large family of prostaglandins represent a truly remarkable class of natural products. Prostaglandin A2 is a tissue hormone naturally found in human seminal plasma and in the sea whip Plexaura homomalla with yet poorly understood biological or therapeutic effects. Herein, a novel strategy for the stereoselective construction of both naturally occurring prostaglandin A2 epimers and first insights into their functional effects on the major inhibitory neurotransmitter &#947;-aminobutyric acid (GABA) type A receptors (GABAAR) are provided. The synthesis of both epimers was achieved in only 11 steps starting from commercially available 2,5-dimethoxy-tetrahydrofuran employing an organocatalytic domino-aldol reaction, a Mizoroki-Heck reaction, a Wittig reaction as well as an oxidation-decarboxylation sequence. The (15R)-epimer significantly reduced GABA-induced currents through GABAA receptors while its (15S)-epimer did not show any significant effect. These data suggest that 15R-PGA2 might serve as a novel scaffold for the development of selective GABAA receptor modulators.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dual pH and Ca2+&#8208;Responsive PEG&#8208;Modified Pillar[5]arene&#8208;Based Supramolecular Nanodrug Delivery System: Excellent Cargo Encapsulation and Minimal Drug Toxicity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemotherapy is one of the most employed strategies in clinical treatment of cancer. However, reducing medication adverse effects and improving the biological activity remains a significant issue for chemotherapy. We developed a pH and Ca2+&#8208;responsive pillar[5]arene&#8208;based supramolecular nanodrug delivery system (NDDS) WP5&#8835;EV@DOX to address the aforementioned challenges. The formation of this NDDS began with the spontaneous formation of supramolecular nanodrug carrier WP5&#8835;EV in water from PEG&#8208;modified pillar[5]arene and the bipyridilium salt derivative EV through simple host&#8208;guest interaction. Then the antitumor drug doxorubicin DOX was efficiently loaded with a high encapsulation rate of 84.6%. Cytotoxicity results indicated that the constructed nanoplatform not only reduced DOX toxicity and side effects on normal cell (293T), but also significantly enhanced the antitumor activity on cancer cell (HepG2). Moreover, in vivo experiments showed that WP5&#8835;EV@DOX had a longer half&#8208;life and higher bioavailability in the blood of mice compared to the nake drug DOX, with increases to 212% and 179%, respectively. Therefore, WP5&#8835;EV@DOX has great potential in tumor therapy and provides a new idea for host&#8208;guest drug delivery system.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrosilylation of Arynes with Silanes and Silicon&#8208;based Polymer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Benzyne derived from hexadehydrogenated Diels Alder (HDDA) reactions was found to be an efficient hydrosilylation acceptors. Various silanes can react smoothly with HDDA&#8208;derived benzyne to give the arylation products. Lewis acid such as boron trifluoride etherate can accelerate these hydrosilylation reactions. Polyhydromethylsiloxane (PHMS), a widely used organosilicon polymer, was also successfully modified using our method. About 5% of Si&#8208;H bonds in the polymer were inserted by benzynes, giving a functional PHMS with much more solubility in methanol and with a blue&#8208;emitting fluorescence behavior. Mechanism research shows that the insertion of benzyne into the Si&#8208;H bond probably undergoes a synergistic pathway, which is quite different from the traditional radical&#8208;initiated hydrosilylation or transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed hydrosilylation.</dc:description>

         <title>The Excited State Dynamics of a Mutagenic Guanosine Etheno Adduct Investigated by Femtosecond Fluorescence Spectroscopy and Quantum Mechanical Calculations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Femtosecond fluorescence upconversion experiments were combined with CASPT2 and time dependent DFT calculations to characterize the excited state dynamics of the mutagenic etheno adduct 1,N2&#8208;etheno&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;deoxyguanosine (&#949;dG). This endogenously formed lesion is attracting great interest because of its ubiquity in human tissues and its highly mutagenic properties. The &#949;dG fluorescence is strongly modified with respect to that of the canonical nucleoside dG, notably by an about 6&#8208;fold increase in fluorescence lifetime and quantum yield at neutral pH. In addition, femtosecond fluorescence upconversion experiments reveal the presence of two emission bands with maxima at 335 nm for the shorter&#8208;lived and 425 nm for the longer&#8208;lived. Quantum mechanical calculations rationalize these findings and provide absorption and fluorescence spectral shapes similar to the experimental ones. Two different bright minima are located on the potential energy surface of the lowest energy singlet excited state. One planar, slightly less stable, is associated with the emission at 335 nm, whereas the other, with a bent etheno ring, is associated with the red&#8208;shifted emission.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The rising demand and financial costs of noble transition metal catalysts have emphasized the need for sustainable catalytic approaches. Over the past few years, base&#8208;metal catalysts have emerged as ideal candidates to replace their noble&#8208;metal counterparts because of their abundance and easiness of handling. Despite the significant advancements achieved with precious transition metals, earth&#8208;abundant cobalt catalysts have emerged as efficient alternatives for allylic substitution reactions. In this review, allylic alkylations at sp3&#8208;carbon centers mediated by cobalt will be discussed, with a special focus on the mechanistic features, scope, and limitations.</dc:description>

         <title>Pyridyl&#8208;substituted nitronyl nitroxides: comprehensive magnetochemical and quantum chemical study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of pyridyl&#8208;substituted nitronyl nitroxides was synthesized and structurally characterized. A comprehensive magnetochemical and quantum chemical study of extended raw of the nitroxides with different substituents R in the pyridine fragment was performed. It was shown, that temperature&#8208;dependent magnetic properties are determined by the short contacts between nitroxide groups of adjacent molecules as well as between nitroxide group and methyl substituents in the pseudo axial positions of imidazoline fragments. Quantum chemistry allows to select the appropriate model of exchange cluster for analysis of experimental magnetic data and evaluation of the exchange interaction parameters. For NN&#8208;PyCl the &#8220;order&#8208;disorder&#8221; transition was detected by means of low temperature XRD. The difference in the experimental and calculated exchange interaction energies may serve as an indicator of temperature&#8208;induced structural rearrangements. For instance, for methyl substituted nitronyl nitroxide NN&#8208;PyMe structural transformations and significant changes in exchange interaction energies were observed.</dc:description>

         <title>Redox Active Ligands for Catalyzing the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>

         <title>Green Late&#8208;Stage Functionalization of Tryptamines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An efficient and rapid protocol for the oxidative halogenation of tryptamines with 10% aqueous NaClO has been developed. This reaction is featured by its operational simplicity, metal&#8208;free conditions, no purification, and high yield. Notably, the resulting key intermediates are suitable for further functionalization with various nucleophiles, including amines, N&#8208;aromatic heterocycles, indoles and phenols. The overall transformation exhibits broad functional&#8208;group tolerance and is applicable to the late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex biorelevant molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Microwave&#8208;Assisted ultrafast Synthesis of Bimetallic Nickel&#8208;Cobalt Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Application in the Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of monometallic Ni&#8208;, Co&#8208; and Zn&#8208;MOFs and bimetallic NiCo&#8208;, NiZn&#8208; and CoZn&#8208;MOFs M2(BDC)2DABCO and (M,M&#8217;)2(BDC)2DABCO, respectively, with the same pillar and layer linkers 4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO) and benzene&#8208;1,4&#8208;dicarboxylate (BDC) were prepared through a fast microwave&#8208;assisted thermal conversion synthesis method within only 12 min. In the bimetallic MOFs the ratio M:M&#8217; was 4:1. The mono&#8208; and bimetallic MOFs were selected to systematically explore the catalytic&#8208;activity of their derived metal oxide/hydroxides for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The NiCoMOF exhibits superior catalytic activity for the OER with the lowest overpotentials of 301 mV and Tafel slopes of 42 mV dec&#8722;1 on a glassy carbon electrode in 1 mol L&#8211;1 KOH electrolyte at a current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2. In addition, NiCoMOF was in situ grown in just 25 min by the MW synthesis on the surface of nickel foam (NF) where overpotentials of 313 and 328 mV at current densities of 50 and 300 mA cm&#8211;2, respectively, were delivered and superior long&#8208;term stability for practical OER application. The low Tafel slope of 27 mV dec&#8722;1, as well as a low reaction resistance from electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurement (Rfar = 2 &#937;), confirm the excellent OER performance of this NiCoMOF/NF composite.</dc:description>

         <title>Stacking Structure of Vaterite Revealed by Atomic Imaging and Diffraction Analysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Anhydrous calcium carbonate crystals exist as three polymorphs: calcite, aragonite, and vaterite. Although vaterite is a metastable phase rarely found in the geological environment, it is intriguing that various biominerals are composed of vaterite. The processes of stable vaterite formation in biological systems cannot be understood without elucidating the nature of vaterite. The crystal structure of vaterite has been discussed for nearly a century but is still an open question. Here we propose the actual structure of vaterite by combining atomic imaging and diffraction analysis with simulations of disordered stacking sequences. Vaterite basically appears as layers of hexagonal calcium planes and carbonate (CO32&#8722;)&#8208;containing sheets stacked with +60&#176;, &#8722;60&#176;, or 180&#176; rotations from the underlying layer. However, equivalent carbonate positions in alternating layers are forbidden, and four&#8208;layer stacking in which the fourth layer rotates 180&#176; relative to the first layer are predominant, forming an orthogonal reciprocal lattice in diffraction patterns. These stacking characteristics replicate the intensity distribution in the electron and X&#8208;ray diffraction patterns. This study has almost completely elucidated the crystal structure and stacking sequence of vaterite. Our findings provide insights into the thermodynamic stability of vaterite, which facilitates comprehension of the biomineralization processes and growth dynamics of calcium carbonate.</dc:description>

         <title>DNA Molecular Glue Assisted Bacterial Conjugative Transfer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bacterial conjugation, a commonly used method to horizontally transfer functional genes from donor to recipient strains, plays an important role in the genetic manipulation of bacteria for basic research and industrial production. Successful conjugation depends on the donor&#8208;recipient cell recognition and a tight mating junction formation. However, the efficiency of conjugative transfer is usually very low. In this work, we developed a new technique that employed DNA molecule &#8220;glue&#8221; to increase the match frequency and the interaction stability between the donor and recipient cells. We used two&#160;E. coli&#160;strains, ETZ and BL21, as a model system, and modified them with the complementary ssDNA oligonucleotides by click chemistry. The conjugation efficiency of the modified bacteria was improved more than 4 times from 10% to 46%. This technique is simple and generalizable as it only relies on the active amino groups on the bacterial surface. It is expected to have broad applications in constructing&#160;engineered bacteria.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering applications of solar photocatalysis &amp; photothermal catalysis for hydrogen production from biomass:A review</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biomass photoreforming is a promising way of producing sustainable hydrogen thanks to the abundant sources of biomass feedstocks. Solar energy provides the heat and driven force to initial biomass oxidation coupled with H2 evolution. Currently, biomass photoreforming is still far from plant&#8208;scale applications due to the lower solar energy utilization efficiencies, the low H2 yield, and the lack of appropriate photoreactors. The production of H2 from photoreforming of native biomass and platform molecules was summarized and discussed with special attention to the prospects of scaling up the catalysis technology for mass production of hydrogen. The types of photoreforming including photocatalysis and photothermal catalysis were discussed consequently considering the different requirements for photoreactors.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Biomass photoreforming is a promising way of producing sustainable hydrogen thanks to the abundant sources of biomass feedstocks. Solar energy provides the heat and driven force to initial biomass oxidation coupled with H2 evolution. Currently, biomass photoreforming is still far from plant-scale applications due to the lower solar energy utilization efficiencies, the low H2 yield, and the lack of appropriate photoreactors. The production of H2 from photoreforming of native biomass and platform molecules was summarized and discussed with special attention to the prospects of scaling up the catalysis technology for mass production of hydrogen. The types of photoreforming including photocatalysis and photothermal catalysis were discussed consequently considering the different requirements for photoreactors. We also reviewed the photoreactors that support biomass photoreforming. Numerical simulation methods were implemented for the solid-liquid two-phase flow and inter-particle radiative transfer involved in the reaction process. Developing concentrated photothermal catalytic flowed reactors is beneficial to scale-up catalytic hydrogen production from biomass.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Multi Stimuli Responsive Dual Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission and Photochromic Behavior of a Tetraphenyl Substituted Triphenylamine Derivative and Its Application as Anti&#8208;counterfeiting Agent</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A multi&#8208;stimuli responsive tetraphenyl substituted tripehnylamine&#8208;based aggregation induced emissive (AIE) material coupled with spiropyran was prepared. Owing to the presence of AIE and photochromic moiety, the molecule exhibits emissive aggregates, photochromism, and acidochromism. The multiple stimuli sensitive behavior of the molecule was explored for anti&#8208;counterfeiting behavior on TLC plate and commercial banknotes. The fluorogenic and photogenic response under UV and visible light established the potential of the candidate as a new generation encryption material.</dc:description>

         <title>Oxygen Promoted On&#8208;Surface Synthesis of Polyboroxine Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present our findings on the on&#8208;surface synthesis of polyboroxine molecules derived from boroxine molecules precursors. This process is promoted by oxygen species present on the Au(111) surface: oxygen atoms facilitate the detachment of naphthalene units of trinaphthyl&#8208;boroxine molecules and bridge two unsaturated boroxine centers to form a boroxine&#8208;O&#8208;boroxine chemical motif. X&#8208;ray spectroscopic characterization shows that, as the synthesis process proceeds, it progressively tunes the electronic properties of the interface, thus providing a promising route to control the electron level alignment. .</dc:description>

         <title>A Schottky/Z&#8208;Scheme Hybrid for Augmented Photocatalytic H2 and H2O2 Production</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The prodigious employment of fossil fuels to conquer the global energy demand is becoming a dreadful threat to the human society. This predicament is appealing for a potent photocatalyst that can generate alternate energy sources via solar to chemical energy conversion. With this interest, we have fabricated a ternary heterostructure of Ti3C2 nanosheet modified g&#8208;C3N4/Bi2O3 (MCNRBO) Z&#8208;scheme photocatalyst through self&#8208;assembly process. The morphological analysis clearly evidenced the close interfacial interaction between g&#8208;C3N4 nanorod, Bi2O3 and Ti3C2 nanosheets. The oxygen vacancy created on Bi2O3 surface, as suggested by XPS and EPR analysis, supported the Z&#8208;scheme heterojunction formation between g&#8208;C3N4 nanorod and Bi2O3 nanosheets. The collaborative effect of Z&#8208;scheme and Schottky junction significantly reduced charge transfer resistance promoting separation efficiency of excitons as indicated from PL and EIS analysis. The potential of MCNRBO towards photocatalytic application was investigated by H2O2 and H2 evolution reaction. A superior photocatalytic H2O2 and H2 production rate for MCNRBO is observed, which are respectively around 5 and 18 folds higher as compared to pristine CNR nanorod. The present work encourages for the development of a noble, eco&#8208;benign and immensely efficient dual heterojunction based photocatalyst, which can acts as saviour of human society from energy crisis.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis, Characterization and Energetic Properties of Hydroxymethyl&#8208;Bishomocubanone Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The present work reports synthesis, characterization and theoretical insights on novel hydroxymethyl&#8208;bishomocubanone derivatives. Twelve new bishomocubanes (BHCs) were synthesized and fully characterized by various spectroscopic techniques and single&#160;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis. The densities of the title compounds were found in the range of 1.34&#8208;1.59 g/cm3. Density&#8208;functional theory (DFT) based calculations at B3LYP/6&#8208;311++G(d,p) level of theory were performed on &#160;ten selected BHC based cage compounds. Propulsive and ballistic properties of newly synthesized hydroxymethyl&#8208;bishomocubanone derivatives in solid and liquid propulsion systems were calculated, and the results suggested that these compounds are superior to conventional fuel RP1 and binder HTPB. The detonation parameters revealed that these compounds are not explosive in nature and safe to use as solid propellants. Furthermore, kinetic and thermal stabilities of the title compounds were determined by HOMO&#8208;LUMO energy gap, ESP maps, impact sensitivity (h50) and bond dissociation energies (BDEs) followed by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential thermogravimetry analysis (DTA). Three compounds, a dinitroazide (Isp,vac= 310.98s), a dinitrate (Isp,vac = 309.51s), and a dinitronitrate (Isp,vac= 309.20s) were&#160;found to be excellent candidates for volume limited applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Ring Rearrangement Reactions of 4&#8208;Alkenylisocoumarins and Photophysical Evaluation of Multi&#8208;Substituted Anthracene Products</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein we report that readily available 4&#8208;alkenylisocouma&#173;rins can be regarded as potent dienolate equivalents. For example, lactol silyl ethers derived from 4&#8208;alkenylisocoumarins were selectively converted to the corresponding benzo&#8208;homophthalates through a flu&#173;oride&#8208;induced ring opening step that was followed by a ring closure through a vinylogous intramolecular aldol condensation. Likewise, nu&#173;cleophilic activation of 4&#8208;alkenylisocoumarins directly yields diversely poly&#8208;substituted naphthalenes and anthracenes without formation of any regioisomer. Photophysical evaluation of a set of thus obtained 1,3&#8208;di&#8208; and 1,3,4&#8208;trisubstituted anthracenes reveals their distinct intra&#173;molecular charge transfer (ICT) character during light absorption in polar solutions and excimer emission from the solid state when a face to face &#960;&#8208;stacked molecular assembly is present in the crystal packing.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Application of Robust Spiro [Fluorene&#8209;9] CAAC Ruthenium Alkylidene Complexes for the &#8222;One&#8208;Pot&#8220; Conversion of Allyl Acetate to Butane&#8208;1,4&#8208;diol</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of a novel CAAC ligands featuring a spiro&#8208;fluorene group have been synthesized and complexed with ruthenium alkylidenes, yielding the corresponding Hoveyda&#8208;type derivatives as a new family of olefin metathesis catalysts. The novel complexes have been characterized by XRD, HRMS and NMR measurements. The synthetized complexes were tested in catalysis and showed good activity in olefin metathesis, as demonstrated on diethyl diallylmalonate and allyl acetate substrates. The unique backbone in the ligand system with the large, yet inflexible condensed system renders interesting properties to the catalyst, exemplified by the good catalytic performance and improved&#160;Z&#8209;selectivity. In addition, the complex can also serve as a hydrogenation catalyst in a consecutive (one&#8208;pot) reaction. The latter reaction can convert allyl acetate to butane&#8209;1,4&#8209;diol, a valuable chemical intermediate for biodegradable polybutylene succinate (PBS).</dc:description>

         <title>Co(II) Macrocyclic Complexes with Amide&#8208;Glycinate Pendants as ParaCEST and Liposomal CEST Agents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Macrocyclic Co(II) complexes with appended amide&#8208;glycinate groups were prepared to develop paramagnetic Co(II) chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) agents of reduced overall charge. Complexes with reduced charge and lowered osmolarity are important for their loading into liposomes and to provide complexes that are highly water soluble and well tolerated in animals. Co(L1) has two non&#8208;coordinating benzyl groups and two amide&#8208;glycinate pendants, whereas Co(L2) has two unsubstituted amide pendants and two amide&#8208;glycinate pendants on cyclam (1,4,8,11&#8208;tetraazacyclododecane). The 1H NMR spectrum of Co(L1) is consistent with a single cis&#8208;pendant isomer with both amide protons in the trans&#8208;configuration, as supported by an X&#8208;ray crystal structure. Co(L2) has a mixture of different isomers in solution, including the trans&#8208;1,4 and 1,8 pendant isomers. The Z&#8208;spectrum of Co(L1) shows one highly&#8208;shifted CEST peak, whereas Co(L2) exhibits six CEST peaks. Encapsulation of 40 mM Co(L1) in a liposome with osmotically&#8208;induced shrinking at 300 mOsm/L produces a liposomal CEST agent with saturation frequency offset of 3 ppm. Addition of the amphiphilic 1,4,7&#8208;triazacyclononane&#8208;based complex Co(L5) to the liposomal bilayer at 18 mM with Co(L1) encapsulated in the liposome at 50 mM changes the sign and increases the magnitude of the saturation frequency offset to &#8208;7.5 ppm at 300 mOsm/L.</dc:description>

         <title>Pegylated Phosphine Ligands in Iridium(I) Catalyzed Hydrogen Isotope Exchange Reactions in Aqueous Buffers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of a water&#8208;soluble, phosphine&#8208;pegylated iridium(I) catalyst and its application in hydrogen isotope exchange (HIE) reactions in buffer is reported. The longer polyethylene glycol side chains on the phosphine increased the water solubility independently from the pH. HIE reactions of polar substrates in protic solvents were studied. DFT calculations gave further insides into the catalytic processes. The scope and limitation of the pegylated catalyst was studied in HIE reactions of several complex compounds in borax buffer at pH 9 and the best conditions were applied in a tritium experiment with the drug telmisartan.</dc:description>
