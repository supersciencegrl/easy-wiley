         <title>Stability of AgIII towards Halides in Organosilver(III) Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unexpectedly robust: We provide theoretical evidence and experimental proof of the unexpected stability of the AgIII&#8722;X bond with every halogen (X=F, Cl, Br and I) in the series of square&#8208;planar organosilver(III) derivatives [PPh4][(CF3)3AgX]. Unimolecular decomposition paths were analyzed by combined theoretical and experimental methods, whereby the two series of linear complexes [CF3AgX]&#8722; and [FAgX]&#8722; were detected. The first silver(III) azide was also prepared, isolated and structurally characterized.







Abstract
The involvement of silver in two&#8208;electron AgI/AgIII processes is currently emerging. However, the range of stability of the required and uncommon AgIII species is virtually unknown. Here, the stability of AgIII towards the whole set of halide ligands in the organosilver(III) complex frame [(CF3)3AgX]&#8722; (X=F, Cl, Br, I, At) is theoretically analyzed. The results obtained depend on a single factor: the nature of X. Even the softest and least electronegative halides (I and At) are found to form reasonably stable AgIII&#8722;X bonds. Our estimates were confirmed by experiment. The whole series of nonradiative halide complexes [PPh4][(CF3)3AgX] (X=F, Cl, Br, I) has been experimentally prepared and all its constituents have been isolated in pure form. The pseudohalides [PPh4][(CF3)3AgCN] and [PPh4][(CF3)3Ag(N3)] have also been isolated, the latter being the first silver(III) azido complex. Except for the iodo compound, all the crystal and molecular structures have been established by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction methods. The decomposition paths of the [(CF3)3AgX]&#8722; entities at the unimolecular level have been examined in the gas phase by multistage mass spectrometry (MSn). The experimental detection of the two series of mixed complexes [CF3AgX]&#8722; and [FAgX]&#8722; arising from the corresponding parent species [(CF3)3AgX]&#8722; demonstrate that the Ag&#8722;X bond is particularly robust. Our experimental observations are rationalized with the aid of theoretical methods. Smooth variation with the electronegativity of X is also observed in the thermolyses of bulk samples. The thermal stability in the solid state gradually decreases from X=F (145&#8201;&#176;C, dec.) to X=I (78&#8201;&#176;C, dec.) The experimentally established compatibility of AgIII with the heaviest halides is of particular relevance to silver&#8208;mediated or silver&#8208;catalyzed processes.

         <title>Non&#8208;conventional Behavior of a 2,1&#8208;Benzazaphosphole: Heterodiene or Hidden Phosphinidene?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on a Natural Resonance Theory study, 2,1&#8208;benzazaphosphole exhibits a dualistic behavior and can serve as a heterodiene or a hidden phosphinidene. This intriguing property has been confirmed chemically. It is able to react with established dienophiles via hetero&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reaction, thereby forming new heterocyclic compounds, but it also donates two transition metals as a 4e ligand, thus mimicking a phosphinidene character. More information can be found in the Full Paper by Z. Benk&#337;, L. Dost&#225;l, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101686).

         <title>Ni(II) Precatalysts Enable Thioetherification of (Hetero)Aryl Halides and Tosylates and Tandem C&#8722;S/C&#8722;N Couplings</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Competent partners: &#960;&#8208;Allyl&#8211;nickel precatalysts supported by dialkylterphenyl phosphines efficiently couple a wide range of electrophiles including aryl iodides/bromides/chlorides and, for the first time, aryl and alkenyl tosylates with aromatic and aliphatic thiols. In addition, tandem C&#8722;S and C&#8722;N coupling of multi&#8208;electrophile/nucleophile combinations is achieved in a completely chemoselective manner leading to highly functionalized products.

         <title>Design of Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Dynamic Covalent Delivery Systems for Volatile Compounds (Part&#8197;2): Fragrance&#8208;Releasing Cleavable Surfactants in Functional Perfumery Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Imine&#8208;based cleavable surfactant profragrances assemble into micelles that allow solubilization of perfume molecules that are not covalently attached to the surfactant. Formulated systems were found to be stable during storage and released a fragrance aldehyde upon hydrolysis while providing a balanced evaporation of co&#8208;solubilized perfumery molecules.







Abstract
Amphiphilic imines prepared by condensation of a hydrophobic fragrance aldehyde with a hydrophilic amine derived from a poly(propylene oxide) and poly(ethylene oxide) diblock copolymer were investigated as cleavable surfactant profragrances in applications of functional perfumery. In water, the cleavable surfactants assemble into micelles that allow solubilization of perfume molecules that are not covalently attached to the surfactant. Dynamic headspace analysis on a glass surface showed that solubilized perfume molecules evaporated in a similar manner in the presence of the cleavable surfactant as compared with a non&#8208;cleavable reference surfactant. Under application conditions, the cleavable surfactant imine hydrolysed to release the covalently linked fragrance aldehyde. The profragrances were stable during storage in aqueous media, and upon dilution showed a blooming effect for the hydrolytical fragrance release and a more balanced performance of a solubilized perfume by retaining the more volatile fragrances and boosting the evaporation of the less volatile fragrances.

The so far hardly accessible type&#8208;II clathrate Na24&#8208;&#948;Ge136 (&#948;&#8776;2) was obtained in an about 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 mass ratio with &#945;&#8208;Ge from Na12Ge17 by redox reaction with benzophenone and subsequent heat treatment of the widely X&#8208;ray amorphous intermediate. The phase is room&#8208;temperature transient, diamagnetic and shows metallic properties as revealed by Knight&#8208;shifted 23Na NMR signals and a Pauli&#8208;paramagnetic contribution to the magnetic susceptibility.







Abstract
The metastable type&#8208;II clathrate Na24&#8208;&#948;Ge136 was obtained from Na12Ge17 by applying a two&#8208;step procedure. At first, Na12Ge17 was reacted at 70&#8201;&#176;C with a solution of benzophenone in the ionic liquid (IL) 1,3&#8208;dibutyl&#8208;2&#8208;methylimidazolium&#8208;bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl) azanide. The IL was inert towards Na12Ge17, but capable of dissolving the sodium salts formed in the redox reaction. By annealing at 340&#8201;&#176;C under an argon atmosphere, the X&#8208;ray amorphous intermediate product was transformed to crystalline Na24&#8208;&#948;Ge136 (&#948;&#8776;2) and &#945;&#8208;Ge in an about 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 mass ratio. The product was characterized by X&#8208;ray powder diffraction, chemical analysis, and 23Na solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy. Metallic properties of Na24&#8208;&#948;Ge136 were revealed by a significant Knight shift of the 23Na NMR signals and by a Pauli&#8208;paramagnetic contribution to the magnetic susceptibility. At room temperature, Na24&#8208;&#948;Ge136 slowly ages, with a tendency to volume decrease and sodium loss.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In a cooperative effort between research groups from Dortmund (Germany, coat of arms on the left) and Cuernavaca (Morelos, M&#233;xico, coat of arms on the right), novel molecular cages were synthesized and characterized by state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art analytical methods and DFT calculations. Among these novel compounds, the spacer&#8208;bridged tetraorganodistannoxane in the centre showing a double&#8208;ladder structure exhibits a record spacing between the opposite tin centres. More information can be found in the Communication by K. Jurkschat, H. H&#246;pfl, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101055).

         <title>Bidentate Disilicate Framework for Bis&#8208;Grafted Surface Species</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Grafting of a platinum precursor bearing a disilicate ligand, &#8722;OSi(OtBu)2OSi(OtBu)2O&#8722;, achieved the selective formation of bis&#8208;grafted surface species on silica supports. The chemical&#8208;shift values of the ancillary ligands were almost identical before and after the grafting, thus suggesting that the coordination sphere around platinum of the grafted species was nearly independent of the type of silica support and the degree of substitution on the disilicate ligand.

         <title>Design of Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Dynamic Covalent Delivery Systems for Volatile Compounds (Part&#8197;1): Controlled Hydrolysis of Micellar Amphiphilic Imines in Water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Imines are hydrolytically unstable, but can be stabilized in aqueous media by self&#8208;assembly in micellar structures. Parameters such as pH, concentration, position of the imine function in the amphiphilic structure and relative lengths of the linked hydrophilic and hydrophobic moieties affect the stability of the imine bond and can be adapted to form stimuli&#8208;responsive micelles suitable for controlling the release of bioactive volatiles.







Abstract
Despite their intrinsic hydrolysable character, imine bonds can become remarkably stable in water when self&#8208;assembled in amphiphilic micellar structures. In this work, we systematically studied some of these structures and the influence of various parameters that can be used to take control of their hydrolysis, including pH, concentration, the position of the imine function in the amphiphilic structure, relative lengths of the linked hydrophilic and hydrophobic moieties. Thermodynamic and kinetic data led us to the rational design of stable imines in water, partly based on the location of the imine function within the hydrophobic part of the amphiphile and on a predictable quantitative term that we define as the total hydrophilic&#8211;lipophilic balance (HLB). In addition, we show that such stable systems are also stimuli&#8208;responsive and therefore, of potential interest in trapping and releasing micellar components on demand.

         <title>Phosphate&#8208;Based Self&#8208;Immolative Linkers for Tuneable Double Cargo Release</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phosphorus&#8208;based self&#8208;immolative linkers activated by light sequentially release two phenolic cargos. Structurally modifying the lactate spacer responsible for self&#8208;immolation allows adjustable cargo release, ranging from minutes to days.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Phosphorus-based self-immolative linkers&lt;/b&gt; activated by light sequentially release two phenolic cargos. Structurally modifying the lactate spacer responsible for self-immolation allows adjustable cargo release, ranging from minutes to days. The cargo release rate can be additionally tuned by varying the cargos. NMR spectroscopy coupled to UV light illumination enabled us to track and characterize products released during the self-immolation process. More information can be found in the Full Paper by E.

         <title>Engineered Cyclotides with Potent Broad in Vitro and in Vivo Antimicrobial Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cyclotide is turning: By using a topologically modified sequence of protegrin PG&#8208;1, novel cyclotides were engineered with effective broad&#8208;spectrum antibacterial activity against several ESKAPE bacterial strains and clinical isolates. The most active antibacterial cyclotide showed little hemolytic activity and was extremely stable in serum. In addition, this cyclotide was able to provide protection in&#8197;vivo in a murine P. aeruginosa&#8208;induced peritonitis model.







Abstract
The search for novel antimicrobial agents to combat microbial pathogens is intensifying in response to the rapid development of drug resistance to current antibiotic therapeutics. Respiratory failure and septicemia are the leading causes of mortality among hospitalized patients. Here, the development of a novel engineered cyclotide with effective broad&#8208;spectrum antibacterial activity against several ESKAPE bacterial strains and clinical isolates is reported. The most active antibacterial cyclotide was extremely stable in serum, showed little hemolytic activity, and provided protection in&#8197;vivo in a murine model of P. aeruginosa peritonitis. These results highlight the potential of the cyclotide scaffold for the development of novel antimicrobial therapeutic leads for the treatment of bacteremia.

         <title>THE CATALYTIC MECHANISM OF THE RETAINING GLYCOSYLTRANSFERASE MANNOSYLGLYCERATE SYNTHASE</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To protect their intracellular proteins, extremophile microorganisms synthesize molecules called compatible solutes. These molecules are the result of the attachment of a small negatively charged molecule to a sugar molecule. It has been found that these molecules, not only protect the microorganism against osmotic stress, as initially thought, but also against other extreme conditions. The observation that these molecules can confer protection against extreme conditions to isolated enzymes from different organisms made them an exciting prospect for potential biotechnological applications. One of the most widespread compatible solute in hyperthermophile organisms is the molecule 2&#8208;O&#8208;&#945;&#8208;D&#8208;mannosyl&#8208;D&#8208;glycerate (MG). In addition to confer protection to proteins against extreme conditions, MG was found to prevent Alzheimer's &#946;&#8208;amyloid aggregation and reduce &#945;&#8208;synuclein fibril formation in Parkinson&#8217;s disease.&#160;
In this work we studied, using computational methods, the catalytic mechanism of the synthesis of MG by the enzyme mannosylglycerate synthase (MGS) from the thermophilic bacteria&#160;  Rhodothermus marinus  . MGS is a promiscuous enzyme, accepting a variety of sugar donors and acceptors. This feature can be used to synthesize other molecules with potential biotechnological applications beyond MG. The unravelling of the catalytic mechanism with atomistic resolution and the associated free energies and electrostatic profiles of the stationary states obtained in the present work will help future investigations to full explore the potential of MGS.</dc:description>

         <title>Externally Regulated Specific Molecular Recognition Driven Pathway Selectivity in Supramolecular Polymerization</title>

Externally added 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) introduces new nucleation conditions and influences the thermodynamic landscape in the supramolecular polymerization of a carboxylic&#8208;acid appended NDI&#8208;monomer. With 100&#8201;% DMAP, well&#8208;defined J&#8208;aggregation results in the formation of fibrillar morphology, irrespective of the cooling rate. With 10&#8201;% DMAP, depending on the cooling rate, either J&#8208;aggregate or H&#8208;aggregate (or mixture) is noticed with 1D and 2D morphology, respectively. With 2.5&#8201;% DMAP and slow cooling, extended 2D sheet can be obtained from the thermodynamically controlled H&#8208;aggregation.







Abstract
This article reveals 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) regulated pathway selectivity in the supramolecular polymerization of a naphthalene&#8208;diimide derivative (NDI&#8208;1), appended with a carboxylic acid group. In decane, NDI&#8208;1 produces ill&#8208;defined aggregate (Agg&#8208;1) due to different H&#8208;bonding motifs of the &#8722;COOH group. With one mole equivalent DMAP, the NDI&#8208;1/DMAP complex introduces new nucleation condition and exhibits a cooperative supramolecular polymerization producing J&#8208;aggregated fibrillar nanostructure (Agg&#8208;2). With 10&#8201;% DMAP and fast cooling (10&#8197;K/min), similar nucleation and open chain H&#8208;bonding with the free monomer in an anti&#8208;parallel arrangement produces identical J&#8208;aggregate (Agg&#8208;2a). With 2.5&#8201;% DMAP and slow cooling (1&#8197;K/min), a distinct nucleation and supramolecular polymerization pathway emerge leading to the thermodynamically controlled Agg&#8208;3 with face&#8208;to&#8208;face stacking and 2D&#8208;morphology. Slow cooling with 5&#8211;10&#8201;% DMAP produces a mixture of Agg&#8208;2a and Agg&#8208;3. Computational modelling studies provide valuable insights into the internal order and the pathway complexity.

         <title>Molten&#8208;Salt&#8208;Assisted Annealing for Making Colloidal ZnGa2O4:Cr Nanocrystals with High Persistent Luminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 44, Page 11398-11405, August 5, 2021. </description>

A new concept in molten salt confinement to thermally anneal as&#8208;synthesized sub&#8208;10&#8197;nm ZnGa2O4:Cr3+ colloidal nanocrystals in a molten salt medium at 650&#8201;&#176;C is presented. This improves their persistent luminescence intensity and lifetime without any loss of their nanostructural characteristics, water dispersibility or biocompatibility.







Abstract
Persistent luminescent nanocrystals (PLNCs) in the sub&#8208;10&#8197;nm domain are considered to be the most fascinating inventions in lighting technology owing to their excellent performance in anti&#8208;counterfeiting, luminous paints, bioimaging, security applications, etc. Further improvement of persistent luminescence (PersL) intensity and lifetime is needed to achieve the desired success of PLNCs while keeping the uniform sub&#8208;10&#8197;nm size. In this work, the concept of molten salt confinement to thermally anneal as&#8208;synthesized ZnGa2O4:Cr3+ (ZGOC) colloidal NCs (CNCs) in a molten salt medium at 650&#8201;&#176;C is introduced. This method led to significantly monodispersed and few agglomerated NCs with a much improved photoluminescence (PL) and PersL intensity without much growth in the size of the pristine CNCs. Other strategies such as i) thermal annealing, ii) overcoating, and iii) the core&#8211;shell strategy have also been tried to improve PL and PersL but did not improve them simultaneously. Moreover, directly annealing the CNCs in air without the assistance of molten salt could significantly improve both PL and PersL but led to particle heterogeneity and aggregation, which are highly unsuitable for in&#8197;vivo imaging. We believe this work provides a novel strategy to design PLNCs with high PL intensity and long PersL duration without losing their nanostructural characteristics, water dispersibility and biocompatibility.

         <title>Stabilisation of [WVF4]+ by N&#8208; and P&#8208;Donor Ligands: Second&#8208;Order Jahn&#8208;Teller Effects in Octacoordinate d1 Complexes</title>

         <dc:description>
The [WVF4]+ cation has been stabilised by C5H5N and P(CH3)3 in [O3SCF3]&#8722; salts. The cations adopt square&#8208;antiprismatic (SA) geometries in the solid state, instead of trigonal dodecahedra (TD), as determined using a new geometry index, &#964;8, to discern octacoordinate geometries. This preference for SA was revealed by DFT (B3LYP) studies to arise from a favourable second&#8208;order Jahn&#8208;Teller distortion upon occupation of the dx2&#8722;y2 orbital on tungsten.







Abstract
The first isolated examples of cationic fluoridotungsten(V) complexes are reported as octacoordinate [WF4(L)4]+ (L=C5H5N, P(CH3)3). The [WF4(NC5H5)4]+ cation is synthesised as its [O3SCF3]&#8722; salt upon reaction of WF5(NC5H5)2 with [(CH3)3Si(NC5H5)][O3SCF3] in excess C5H5N, whereas [WF4{P(CH3)3}4]+ is accessed directly from WF6 upon reaction with (CH3)3SiO3SCF3 and excess P(CH3)3. These salts were characterised by X&#8208;ray crystallography and Raman spectroscopy in the solid state. New geometry indices for octacoordinate complexes (&#964;8 and &#964;8&#8242;) are introduced, allowing for the facile differentiation of trigonal&#8208;dodecahedral (TD) and square&#8208;antiprismatic (SA) geometries. This has disambiguated the SA geometries of [WF4(L)4]+ and the geometries of a series of previously reported d0 and d1 MA4B4 complexes. Computational (DFT&#8722;B3LYP) studies of [WF4(PH3)4]2+/+ and related model systems demonstrate the occurrence of a second&#8208;order Jahn&#8208;Teller (SOJT) distortion from TD in d0 complexes to SA in d1 complexes, with the degree of SOJT stabilisation being most significant in 5d complexes containing fluorido ligands and monodentate neutral donors.

Under gentle heating conditions in NaOAc/AcOH, brominated lactol silyl ethers were selectively converted to 4&#8208;aryl&#8208;1,3&#8208;dihydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;naphthoates &#8208; a naphthalene scaffold with a fully substituted benzene unit. The present reaction including a 1,2&#8208;aryl migration process was successfully applied to construct a wide range of polycyclic systems including biphenyl, anthracene, and benzothiophene structures. In addition, the 4&#8208;aryl&#8208;1,3&#8208;dihydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;naphthoate products showed bright photoluminescence emmission from solid&#8208;state as well as in several organic solvents.

4&#8208;Aryl&#8208;1,3&#8208;dihydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;naphthoates having the less accessible 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrasubstituted naphthalene scaffold and that show photoluminescence emission from solid state as well as in solutions, were selectively synthesized from brominated lactol silyl ethers through the 1,2&#8208;aryl&#8208;migrative ring rearrangement reaction.

         <title>Single&#8208;Molecule White&#8208;Light&#8208;Emitting Starburst Donor&#8208;Acceptor Triphenylamine Derivatives and Their Application as Ratiometric Luminescent Molecular Thermometers</title>

From each his own: As the configuration of the central biphenyl breaks up any &#960;&#8208;conjugation, the triarylamine arms of these simple molecules retain their intrinsic electronic properties. This facilitates fluorescence from the individual subchromophoric units across the entire visible spectrum, generating white light. The excited&#8208;state process can be modulated by external stimuli such as temperature; thus, the compound could be exploited as molecular thermometers.







Abstract
White&#8208;light emission (WLE) from a single molecule is a highly desirable alternative to a complex mixture of complementary colour emitters, which suffers from poor stability and reproducibility for potential use in organic electronic devices and lighting applications. We report single&#8208;molecule WLE both in solution and thin films by judiciously controlled &#960;&#8208;electron delocalisation between the triarylamine subchromophoric units. Triphenylamine (TPA) forms the central core, and the phenyl rings are substituted with the electron&#8208;deficient acceptor 3&#8208;ethylrhodanine (Rh) and electron&#8208;rich donors triphenylamine or carbazole. The enforced biphenyl configuration of the TPA core and the other donors renders the &#960;&#8208;conjugation across the entire chromophore poor, thus the individual subchromophoric units retain their individual emission characteristics, which cover all three primary colour emissions, that is, red, green and blue (RGB). TPA&#8722;Rh units exhibit broad fluorescence in the green&#8208;red region originating from the local excited (LE) state and intramolecular charge transfer state (ICT), strongly influenced by the solvent, water, and temperature. Different fluorescence parameters, including spectral maxima, ratiometric changes in ICT emission at the expense of blue emission from terminal donor units, and changes in lifetime, have a linear relationship with temperature between 180&#8211;330&#8197;K, thus the molecules can function as a multiparameter luminescent molecular thermometer. A temperature coefficient of 0.19&#8197;K&#8722;1 in ratiometric fluorescence changes along with a spectral shift of 0.3&#8197;nm&#8201;K&#8722;1 and their workability over the wide temperature makes these molecules promising materials for potential applications. At lower temperatures, individual subchromophoric properties subside because of the reduced dihedral angle of biphenyl, and fluorescence from the whole molecule becomes dominant.

         <title>Study of Ground State Interactions of Enantiopure Chiral Quaternary Ammonium Salts and Amides, Nitroalkanes, Nitroalkenes, Esters, Heterocycles, Ketones and Fluoroamides</title>

1H&#8197;NMR titration experiments were carried out on Cinchona and Maruoka type quaternary ammonium salts, by using neutral ligands. The data clarified the principal interactions involved between catalyst and reactants, showed the binding of halides and non&#8208;coordinating anion BArF to chiral ammonium species, and provided a guide to understanding the enantioselective processes mediated by this class of organocatalysts.







Abstract
Chiral phase&#8208;transfer catalysis provides high level of enantiocontrol, however no experimental data showed the interaction of catalysts and substrates. 1H&#8197;NMR titration was carried out on Cinchona and Maruoka ammonium bromides vs. nitro, carbonyl, heterocycles, and N&#8722;F containing compounds. It was found that neutral organic species and quaternary ammonium salts interacted via an ensemble of catalyst +N&#8722;C&#8722;H and (sp2)C&#8722;H, specific for each substrate studied. The correspondent BArF salts interacted with carbonyls via a diverse set of +N&#8722;C&#8722;H and (sp2)C&#8722;H compared to bromides. This data suggests that BArF ammonium salts may display a different enantioselectivity profile. Although not providing quantitative data for the affinity constants, the data reported proofs that chiral ammonium salts coordinate with substrates, prior to transition state, through specific C&#8722;H positions in their structures, providing a new rational to rationalize the origin of enantioselectivity in their catalyses.

The correspondent BArF salts interacted with carbonyls &lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; a diverse set of &lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;N&#8722;C&#8722;H and (sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)C&#8722;H compared to bromides. This data suggests that BArF ammonium salts may display a different enantioselectivity profile. Although not providing quantitative data for the affinity constants, the data reported proofs that chiral ammonium salts coordinate with substrates, prior to transition state, through specific C&#8722;H positions in their structures, providing a new rational to rationalize the origin of enantioselectivity in their catalyses.&lt;/p&gt;

A family of cyclic phosphine&#8208;disiloxane featuring peri&#8208;substituted naphthyl(Nap)/acenaphthyl(Ace) scaffolds has been prepared. This straightforward synthesis takes advantage of both ortho&#8208; and peri&#8208;substitution of Nap/Ace&#8208;substituted phosphine oxides. The synthetic method allows diversifying the polycyclic aromatic platform and the Si substituents. Despite some steric congestion, the P&#8208;atom remains reactive. In particular, Au(I) complex could be prepared. Surprisingly, the P&#8208;trivalent derivatives display unexpected luminescence in the green in solid&#8208;state.







Abstract
A family of cyclic phosphine&#8208;disiloxane featuring peri&#8208;substituted naphthyl(Nap)/acenaphthyl(Ace) scaffolds has been prepared and fully characterized including X&#8208;ray structure, which enables a detailed structural analysis. This straightforward synthesis takes advantage of both ortho&#8208; and peri&#8208;substitution of Nap/Ace&#8208;substituted phosphine oxides. The synthetic method allows diversifying the polycyclic aromatic platform (Nap and Ace) as well as the Si substituents (Me and Ph). Despite a strong steric congestion, the P&#8208;atom remains reactive toward oxidation or coordination. In particular, Au(I) complex could be prepared. All the compounds display absorption/luminescence in the UV&#8208;Vis range. Surprisingly, the P&#8208;trivalent derivatives display unexpected luminescence in the green in solid&#8208;state.

         <title>Cu/CuxS&#8208;Embedded N,S&#8208;Doped Porous Carbon Derived in Situ from a MOF Designed for Efficient Catalysis</title>

Greater than the sum of its parts: Cu/CuxS embedded N,S&#8208;doped porous carbon (Cu/CuxS/NSC) derived in&#8197;situ from a designed Cu&#8208;MOF was successfully synthesized. Porous Cu/CuxS/NSC has a high catalytic reduction efficiency for 4&#8208;NP (k=0.0256&#8197;s&#8722;1) and dyes (CR, MO, MB and RhB) that is better than that of many copper&#8208;based catalysts and even precious metal catalysts. The efficient catalytic reduction performance of Cu/CuxS/NSC is inseparable from the synergistic catalysis of each component.







Abstract
The reasonable design of the precursor of a carbon&#8208;based nanocatalyst is an important pathway to improve catalytic performance. In this study, a simple solvothermal method was used to synthesize [Cu(TPT)(2,5&#8208;tdc)]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H2O (Cu&#8208;MOF), which contains N and S atoms, in one step. Further in&#8208;situ carbonization of the Cu&#8208;MOF as the precursor was used to synthesize Cu/CuxS&#8208;embedded N,S&#8208;doped porous carbon (Cu/CuxS/NSC) composites. The catalytic activities of the prepared Cu/CuxS/NSC were investigated through catalytic reduction of 4&#8208;nitrophenol (4&#8208;NP) to 4&#8208;aminophenol (4&#8208;AP). The results show that the designed Cu/CuxS/NSC has exceptional catalytic activity and recycling stability, with a reaction rate constant of 0.0256&#8197;s&#8722;1, and the conversion rate still exceeds 90&#8201;% after 15 cycles. Meanwhile, the efficient catalytic reduction of dyes (CR, MO, MB and RhB) confirmed its versatility. Finally, the active sites of the Cu/CuxS/NSC catalysts were analyzed, and a possible multicomponent synergistic catalytic mechanism was proposed.

Opening up open&#8208;shell molecular systems: We investigated the influence of AuI&#8722;AuI (aurophilic) interactions on the properties of multispin molecular systems by using multinuclear&#8208;AuI complexes with two or three nitronyl nitroxide&#8208;2&#8208;ide radical anions. Among these complexes, the one in which an aurophilic interaction was observed by structural analysis showed characteristic spin&#8722;spin interactions, electrochemical properties, and a solvatochromic behavior.







Abstract
Multinuclear AuI complexes with two or three nitronyl nitroxide&#8208;2&#8208;ide radical anion and phosphine&#8208;ligand scaffolds, (NN&#8208;Au)2&#8208;1&#8201;o, (NN&#8208;Au)2&#8208;1&#8201;m, and (NN&#8208;Au)2&#8208;1&#8201;p, have been synthesized to investigate the influence of AuI&#8722;AuI (aurophilic) interactions on the properties of multispin molecular systems. The desired complexes were successfully prepared in moderate yields in a one&#8208;pot synthesis from the corresponding phosphine ligand, AuI source, parent NN, and sodium hydroxide. Among the prepared complexes, (NN&#8208;Au)2&#8208;1&#8201;o, in which an aurophilic interaction was clearly observed by crystal structure analysis, showed characteristic spin&#8722;spin interactions, electrochemical properties, and solvatochromic behavior. The results from theoretical calculations also suggested that the differences in properties between complex (NN&#8208;Au)2&#8208;1&#8201;o and the other complexes are due to intramolecular aurophilic interactions.

         <title>Through Bridge Spin Coupling in Homo&#8208; and Heterobimetallic Porphyrin Dimers upon Stepwise Oxidations: A Spectroscopic and Theoretical Investigation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 44, Page 11428-11441, August 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Homo&#8208; and heterobimetallic porphyrin dimers have been synthesized, which, upon 2e&#8208;oxidation, produce stable dication diradical species as shown. Through the bridge, both porphyrin rings exhibited notable conjugation resulting in effective coupling between metal and porphyrin radical spins of both rings while the coupling model dependent on the nature of metal ion used. Mulliken spin density distributions display the Cu(II) porphyrin center as charge donor while Fe(III)/Mn(III) porphyrin center as charge acceptor.







Abstract
We have described copper(II)&#8208;iron(III) and copper(II)&#8208;manganese(III) heterobimetallic porphyrin dimers and compared them with the corresponding homobimetallic analogs. UV&#8208;visible spectra are very distinct in the heterometallic species while electrochemical studies demonstrate that these species, as compared to the homobimetallic analog, are much easier to oxidize. Combined M&#246;ssbauer, EPR, NMR, magnetic and UV&#8208;visible spectroscopic studies show that upon 2e&#8208;oxidation of the heterobimetallic complexes only ring&#8208;centered oxidation occurs. The energy differences between HOMO and LUMO are linearly dependent with the low&#8208;energy NIR band obtained for the 2e&#8208;oxidized complexes. Also, strong electronic communication between two porphyrin rings through the bridge facilitates coupling between various unpaired spins present while the coupling model depends on the nature of metal ions used. While unpaired spins of Fe(III) and the porphyrin &#960;&#8208;cation radical are strongly antiferromagnetically coupled, such coupling is rather weak between Mn(III) and a porphyrin &#960;&#8208;cation radical. Moreover, the coupling between two &#960;&#8208;cation radicals are much stronger in the 2e&#8208;oxidized complexes of dimanganese(III) and copper(II)&#8208;manganese(III) porphyrin dimers as compared to their diiron(III) and copper(II)&#8208;iron(III) analogs. Furthermore, coupling between the unpaired spins of a &#960;&#8208;cation radical and copper(II) is much stronger in the 2e&#8208;oxidized complex of copper(II)&#8208;iron(III) porphyrin dimer as compared to its copper(II)&#8208;manganese(III) analog. The Mulliken spin density distributions in 2e&#8208;oxidized homo&#8208; and heterobimetallic complexes show symmetric and asymmetric spread between the two macrocycles, respectively. In both the 2e&#8208;oxidized heterobimetallic complexes, the Cu(II) porphyrin center acts as a charge donor while Fe(III)/Mn(III) porphyrin center act as a charge acceptor. The experimental observations are also strongly supported by DFT calculations.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Homo- and heterobimetallic&lt;/b&gt; porphyrin dimers have been synthesized, which, upon 2e-oxidation, produce stable dication diradical species as shown. Through the bridge, both porphyrin rings exhibited notable conjugation resulting in effective coupling between metal and porphyrin radical spins of both rings while the coupling model dependent on the nature of metal ion used. Mulliken spin density distributions display the Cu(II) porphyrin center as charge donor while Fe(III)/Mn(III) porphyrin center as charge acceptor.

&lt;p&gt;We have described copper(II)-iron(III) and copper(II)-manganese(III) heterobimetallic porphyrin dimers and compared them with the corresponding homobimetallic analogs. UV-visible spectra are very distinct in the heterometallic species while electrochemical studies demonstrate that these species, as compared to the homobimetallic analog, are much easier to oxidize. Combined M&#246;ssbauer, EPR, NMR, magnetic and UV-visible spectroscopic studies show that upon 2e-oxidation of the heterobimetallic complexes only ring-centered oxidation occurs. The energy differences between HOMO and LUMO are linearly dependent with the low-energy NIR band obtained for the 2e-oxidized complexes. Also, strong electronic communication between two porphyrin rings through the bridge facilitates coupling between various unpaired spins present while the coupling model depends on the nature of metal ions used. While unpaired spins of Fe(III) and the porphyrin &#960;-cation radical are strongly antiferromagnetically coupled, such coupling is rather weak between Mn(III) and a porphyrin &#960;-cation radical. Moreover, the coupling between two &#960;-cation radicals are much stronger in the 2e-oxidized complexes of dimanganese(III) and copper(II)-manganese(III) porphyrin dimers as compared to their diiron(III) and copper(II)-iron(III) analogs.

Xonotlite and tobermorite minerals are characterized by layered structures containing pendant CaOH and SiOH groups that interact with confined water molecules. In these systems, the hydrogen&#8208;bond network and the dynamics of confined water are modified by the presence of different chemical environments. Herein, is shown that the ordered &#8220;ice&#8208;like&#8221; distribution of water molecules found in the SiOH&#8208;rich environments, as in tobermorite, is converted to a disordered &#8220;liquid&#8208;like&#8221; distribution in the CaOH&#8208;rich environment in xonotlite.







Abstract
Calcium silicate hydrates are members of a large family of minerals with layered structures containing pendant CaOH and SiOH groups that interact with confined water molecules. To rationalize the impact of the local chemical environment on the dynamics of water, SiOH&#8208; and CaOH&#8208;rich model nanocrystals were synthesized by using the continuous supercritical hydrothermal method and then systematically studied by a combination of spectroscopic techniques. In our comprehensive analysis, the ultrafast relaxation dynamics of hanging hydroxy groups can be univocally assigned to CaOH or SiOH environments, and the local chemical environment largely affects the H&#8208;bond network of the solvation water. Interestingly, the ordered &#8220;ice&#8208;like&#8221; solvation water found in the SiOH&#8208;rich environments is converted to a disordered &#8220;liquid&#8208;like&#8221; distribution in the CaOH&#8208;rich environment. This refined picture of the dynamics of confined water and hydroxy groups in calcium silicate hydrates can also be applied to other water&#8208;containing materials, with a significant impact in many fields of materials science.

         <title>Pathways of the Extremely Reactive Iron(IV)&#8208;oxido complexes with Tetradentate Bispidine Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 44, Page 11377-11390, August 5, 2021. </description>

The nonheme iron(IV)&#8208;oxido complex trans&#8208;N3&#8208;[(L1)FeIV=O(Cl)]+ is an extremely reactive oxidant for OAT and HAA processes and is the most reactive nonheme iron model system known so far and of similar reactivity as nonheme iron enzymes. Discussed are spectroscopic and kinetic data, supported by a DFT&#8208;based theoretical analysis. In bulk reactions cyclohexane is selectively oxidized to chlorocyclohexane.







Abstract
The nonheme iron(IV)&#8208;oxido complex trans&#8208;N3&#8208;[(L1)FeIV=O(Cl)]+, where L1 is a derivative of the tetradentate bispidine 2,4&#8208;di(pyridine&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;3,7&#8208;diazabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane&#8208;1&#8208;one, is known to have an S=1 electronic ground state and to be an extremely reactive oxidant for oxygen atom transfer (OAT) and hydrogen atom abstraction (HAA) processes. Here we show that, in spite of this ferryl oxidant having the &#8220;wrong&#8221; spin ground state, it is the most reactive nonheme iron model system known so far and of a similar order of reactivity as nonheme iron enzymes (C&#8722;H abstraction of cyclohexane, &#8722;90&#8201;&#176;C (propionitrile), t1/2=3.5&#8197;sec). Discussed are spectroscopic and kinetic data, supported by a DFT&#8208;based theoretical analysis, which indicate that substrate oxidation is significantly faster than self&#8208;decay processes due to an intramolecular demethylation pathway and formation of an oxido&#8208;bridged diiron(III) intermediate. It is also shown that the iron(III)&#8208;chlorido&#8208;hydroxido/cyclohexyl radical intermediate, resulting from C&#8722;H abstraction, selectively produces chlorocyclohexane in a rebound process. However, the life&#8208;time of the intermediate is so long that other reaction channels (known as cage escape) become important, and much of the C&#8722;H abstraction therefore is unproductive. In bulk reactions at ambient temperature and at longer time scales, there is formation of significant amounts of oxidation product &#8211; selectively of chlorocyclohexane &#8211; and it is shown that this originates from oxidation of the oxido&#8208;bridged diiron(III) resting state.

The first sub&#8208;picosecond studies of the excited&#8208;state ring&#8208;opening dynamics of stilbene oxide are presented. Three major decays for the parent ion (sub&#8208;450&#8197;fs, (1.5&#177;0.2)&#8197;ps, and &gt;100&#8197;ps), which relate to ring opening at the C&#8722;C bond of the oxirane center, were observed. Additionally two fragment ions appeared that might highlight an alternative mechanism that occurs through the dissociation of one of the C&#8722;O bonds of the oxirane center.







Abstract
The ultrafast photo&#8208;induced ring opening of the oxirane derivative trans&#8208;stilbene oxide has been studied through the use of ultrafast UV/UV pump&#8208;probe spectroscopy by using photo&#8208;ion detection. Single&#8208; and multiphoton probe paths and final states were identified through comparisons between UV power studies and synchrotron&#8208;based vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) single&#8208;photon ionization studies. Three major time&#8208;dependent features of the parent ion (sub&#8208;450&#8197;fs decay, (1.5&#177;0.2)&#8197;ps, and &gt;100&#8197;ps) were observed. These decays are discussed in conjunction with the primary ring&#8208;opening mechanism of stilbene oxide, which occurs through C&#8722;C dissociation in the oxirane ring. The appearance of fragments relating to the masses of dehydrogenated diphenylmethane (167&#8197;amu) and dehydrogenated methylbenzene (90&#8197;amu) were also investigated. The appearance of the 167&#8197;amu fragment could suggest an alternative ultrafast ring&#8208;opening pathway via the dissociation of one of the C&#8722;O bonds within the oxirane ring.

WO3 dispersions: Bulk layered WO3 has been synthesized from bulk WS2 through topochemical conversion. Furthermore, liquid&#8208;phase exfoliation was carried out to obtain a WO3 dispersion that could be directly used to fabricate thin films by the spray&#8208;coating method. WO3 thin films were used as electrodes in supercapacitors and photo&#8208;electrochemical water oxidation.







Abstract
Solution processing of nanomaterials is a promising technique for use in various applications owing to its simplicity and scalability. However, the studies on liquid&#8208;phase exfoliation (LPE) of tungsten oxide (WO3) are limited, unlike others, by a lack of commercial availability of bulk WO3 with layered structures. Herein, a one&#8208;step topochemical synthesis approach to obtain bulk layered WO3 from commercially available layered tungsten disulfide (WS2) by optimizing various parameters like reaction time and temperature is reported. Detailed microscopic and spectroscopic techniques confirmed the conversion process. Further, LPE was carried out on topochemically converted bulk layered WO3 in 22 different solvents; among the solvents studied, the propan&#8208;2&#8208;ol/water (1&#8201;:&#8201;1) co&#8208;solvent system appeared to be the best. This indicates that the possible values of surface tension and Hansen solubility parameters for bulk WO3 could be close to that of the co&#8208;solvent system. The obtained WO3 dispersions in a low&#8208;boiling&#8208;point solvent enable thin films of various thickness to be fabricated by using spray coating. The obtained thin films were used as active materials in supercapacitors without any conductive additives/binders and exhibited an areal capacitance of 31.7&#8197;mF&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 5&#8197;mV&#8201;s&#8722;1. Photo&#8208;electrochemical measurements revealed that these thin films can also be used as photoanodes for photo&#8208;electrochemical water oxidation.

         <title>A Fluorescence Sensor Array Based on Zinc(II)&#8208;Carboxyamidoquinolines: Toward Quantitative Detection of ATP**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 44, Page 11344-11351, August 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorescent carboxyamidoquinoline&#8208;zinc(II) assemblies were investigated as sensors for biologically relevant phosphate anions in water at low concentrations (micromolar). Analyte&#8208;specific changes in fluorescence allow for differentiation of inorganic phosphate, pyrophosphate, ADP, and ATP from eight other anionic analytes in a HEPES buffer. A fluorescence based array enabled quantitative analysis of ATP in the concentration range of 5&#8211;100&#8197;&#956;M.







Abstract
The newly prepared fluorescent carboxyamidoquinolines (1&#8211;3) and their Zn(II) complexes (Zn@1&#8208;Zn@3) were used to bind and sense various phosphate anions utilizing a relay mechanism, in which the Zn(II) ion migrates from the Zn@1&#8208;Zn@3 complexes to the phosphate, namely adenosine 5&#8217;&#8208;triphosphate (ATP) and pyrophosphate (PPi), a process accompanied by a dramatic change in fluorescence. Zn@1&#8208;Zn@3 assemblies interact with adenine nucleotide phosphates while displaying an analyte&#8208;specific response. This process was investigated using UV&#8208;vis, fluorescence, and NMR spectroscopy. It is shown that the different binding selectivity and the corresponding fluorescence response enable differentiation of adenosine 5&#8217;&#8208;triphosphate (ATP), adenosine 5&#8217;&#8208;diphosphate (ADP), pyrophosphate (PPi), and phosphate (Pi). The cross&#8208;reactive nature of the carboxyamidoquinolines&#8208;Zn(II) sensors in conjunction with linear discriminant analysis (LDA) was utilized in a simple fluorescence chemosensor array that allows for the identification of ATP, ADP, PPi, and Pi from 8 other anions including adenosine 5&#8217;&#8208;monophosphate (AMP) with 100&#8201;% correct classification. Furthermore, the support vector machine algorithm, a machine learning method, allowed for highly accurate quantitation of ATP in the range of 5&#8211;100&#8197;&#956;M concentration in unknown samples with error &lt;2.5&#8201;%.

         <title>Spectroscopic and Molecular Docking Study of the Interaction between Neutral Re(I) Tetrazolate Complexes and Bovine Serum Albumin</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 44, Page 11406-11417, August 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Interactions between bovine serum albumin (BSA) and two Re(I) complexes, differing in the functionality attached to the tetrazole, were investigated using spectroscopic methods and molecular modelling. Molecular docking was applied for the first time using Re(I) complexes as binding partners for BSA. This study revealed that subtle changes in the functional group of Re(I) complexes influence their interactions with BSA.







Abstract
Re(I) complexes have potential in biomedical sciences as imaging agents, diagnostics and therapeutics. Thus, it is crucial to understand how Re(I) complexes interact with carrier proteins, like serum albumins. Here, two neutral Re(I) complexes were used (fac&#8208;[Re(CO)3(1,10&#8208;phenanthroline)L], in which L is either 4&#8208;cyanophenyltetrazolate (1) or 4&#8208;methoxycarbonylphenyltetrazole ester (2), to study the interactions with bovine serum albumin (BSA). Spectroscopic measurements, calculations of thermodynamic and F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer parameters, as well as molecular modelling, were performed to study differential binding between BSA and complex 1 and 2. Induced&#8208;fit docking combined with quantum&#8208;polarised ligand docking were employed in what is believed to be a first for a Re(I) complex as a ligand for BSA. Our findings provide a basis for other molecular interaction studies and suggest that subtle functional group alterations at the terminal region of the Re(I) complex have a significant impact on the ability of this class of compounds to interact with BSA.

Strong nucleophiles and weak Lewis bases: Kinetic studies by laser flash photolytic methods reveal that dialkyl sulfides and selenides are strong nucleophiles, comparable to pyridine and N&#8208;methylimidazole. Because of their low Lewis basicity (6 to 7 orders of magnitude lower than that of pyridine with respect to C&#8208;centred Lewis acids) they are also good nucleofuges, which makes them useful group&#8208;transfer reagents. Low Marcus intrinsic barriers account for the different ranking of dialkyl chalcogenides in nucleophilicity and Lewis basicity scales.







Abstract
Rate constants for the reactions of dialkyl chalcogenides with laser flash photolytically generated benzhydrylium ions have been measured photometrically to integrate them into the comprehensive benzhydrylium&#8208;based nucleophilicity scale. Combining these rate constants with the previously reported equilibrium constants for the same reactions provided the corresponding Marcus intrinsic barriers and made it possible to quantify the leaving group abilities (nucleofugalities) of dialkyl sulfides and dimethyl selenide. Due to the low intrinsic barriers, dialkyl chalcogenides are fairly strong nucleophiles (comparable to pyridine and N&#8208;methylimidazole) as well as good nucleofuges; this makes them useful group&#8208;transfer reagents.

The ultra&#8208;fast synthesis of calcium silicate hydrates was performed in supercritical water that acts as a solvent for mimicking the natural conditions at high pressure and high temperature of the geological process. The synthesised xonotlite and tobermorite represent perfect Ca&#8722;OH&#8208;rich and Si&#8722;OH&#8208;rich model nanocrystals for investigating the effect of different chemical environments on the dynamics of confined water. These results could be applied to other water&#8208;containing construction materials. More information can be found in the Full Paper by J.&#8197;S. Dolado, C. Aymonier et&#8197;al.

         <dc:description>
The integration of fluorescent BODIPY chromophores and photocleavable oxazine heterocycles within the same covalent skeleton results in the realization of molecules with photoswitchable fluorescence. The photochemical and photophysical properties of these compounds can be engineered to enable the monitoring of dynamics events in live embryos, the encoding of optical signals in live nematodes, the optical writing of fluorescent patterns and the imaging of live cells with sub&#8208;diffraction resolution.

Helicenes are intriguing and inherently chiral compounds with fascinating 3D architecture. Their shape could be compared to whirlpools in the Naruto Strait 
 as it is beautifully depicted in the famous woodcut by Hiroshige. Formation of the whirlpools requires special conditions and these are also required in helical compounds&#8217; syntheses. Synthesis of chiral fluorescent [7]helical indenofluorenes by using catalytic enantioselective [2+2+2]cyclotrimerization and their photophysical properties are reported. More information can be found in the Communication by D. Ne&#269;as, M. Kotora, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202100759).

         <title>Cover Feature: A Novel Reactivity of Phosphanylalumane (&gt;P&#8722;Al&lt;): Reversible Addition of a Saturated Interelement Bond to Olefins (Chem. Eur. J. 44/2021)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 44, Page 11236-11236, August 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A P&#8722;Al single&#8208;bond species, phosphanylalumane, was found to bind relatively small terminal alkenes (ethylene, propylene, and hex&#8208;1&#8208;ene). Although the ethylene adduct did notundergo any elimination of ethylene even under vacuum conditions, heating the terminal alkene adducts resulted in the release of the corresponding alkenes and regenerated the P&#8722;Al bond. Theethylene adduct can work as a new saturated C2 vicinal P/Al&#8208;based frustrated Lewis pair (FLP), showing characteristic reactivity through the elimination of ethylene. More information can be found in the Communication by Y. Mizuhata, N. Tokitoh, and T. Yanagisawa (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101649).

         <title>Cover Feature: C=C Bond Oxidative Cleavage of BODIPY Photocages by Visible Light (Chem. Eur. J. 44/2021)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 44, Page 11235-11235, August 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Contrary to the cleavage of C&#8722;X single bonds, the photoreaction of the C=C bonds of electron&#8208;rich oxidative alkenes remains a challenge. This work presents a novel photoactivation of dialkenyl&#8208;substituted BODIPY photocages to release para&#8208;hydroxy benzaldehyde under visible light illumination in an aqueous environment through a formal [2+2] cycloaddition of singlet oxygen and a double bond. A real&#8208;time monitoring assay revealed that a mannose&#8208;functionalized photocage can target HepG2 cancer cells and release an aldehyde and a biothiol probe under illumination. More information can be found in the Communication by J. Geng et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101833).

How TOCs tick: Homometallic titanium oxo clusters are one of the most important groups of metal oxo clusters. Most of them are uncharged and are obtained by partial hydrolysis and condensation of titanium alkoxo derivatives. The cluster cores, ranging from 3 to &gt;50 titanium atoms, are stabilized by organic ligands. Apart from residual OR groups, carboxylato and phosphonato ligands are most frequent. The article critically reviews and categorizes the known structures and works out basic construction principles.







Abstract
Homometallic titanium oxo clusters are one of the most important groups of metal oxo clusters, with more than 300 examples characterized by X&#8208;ray structure analyses. Most of them are uncharged and are obtained by partial hydrolysis and condensation of titanium alkoxo derivatives. The cluster cores, ranging from 3 to &gt;50 titanium atoms, are stabilized by organic ligands. Apart from residual OR groups, carboxylato and phosphonato ligands are most frequent. The article critically reviews and categorizes the known structures and works out basic construction principles by comparing the different cluster types.

The article critically reviews and categorizes the known structures and works out basic construction principles by comparing the different cluster types.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>BODIPYs with Photoactivatable Fluorescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 44, Page 11257-11267, August 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoactivatable BODIPYs permit fluorescence switching with spatiotemporal control under the influence of optical stimulations. Their synthetic versatility further provides the opportunity to engineer the photochemical, photophysical and structural properties for the implementation of invaluable imaging strategies aimed at elucidating the structures and dynamics of biological samples. Specifically, these photoactivatable fluorophores allow the visualization of live cells with sub&#8208;diffraction resolution and the monitoring of dynamic events in live organisms.







Abstract
The borondipyrromethene (BODIPY) chromophore is a versatile platform for the construction of photoresponsive dyes with unique properties. Specifically, its covalent connection to a photocleavable group can be exploited to engineer compounds with photoswitchable fluorescence. The resulting photoactivatable fluorophores can increase their emission intensity or shift their emission wavelengths in response to switching. Such changes permit the spatiotemporal control of fluorescence with optical stimulations and the implementation of imaging strategies that would be impossible to replicate with conventional fluorophores. Indeed, BODIPYs with photoactivatable fluorescence enable the selective highlighting of intracellular targets, the nanoscaled visualization of sub&#8208;cellular components, the real&#8208;time monitoring of dynamic events and the photochemical writing of optical barcodes.

The crucial ingredients: The first highly enantioselective hydrophosphonylation of seven&#8208;membered cyclic N&#8208;sulfonyl imines by bifunctional phosphonium salt catalysis has been developed, and a broad range of optically pure phosphorus&#8208;containing &#1013;&#8208;benzosultam compounds was readily prepared under mild conditions with very low catalyst loading, easy purification and high yields. The practicality and utility of this protocol were demonstrated by scaled&#8208;up reactions and facile synthetic elaborations. The mechanistic results suggested that the ion&#8208;pair and H&#8208;bonding interactions were crucial in asymmetric induction.







Abstract
&#1013;&#8208;Benzosultam derivatives are potential drug candidates with diverse biological activities. A series of chiral &#1013;&#8208;benzosultams bearing phosphorus functionalities was synthesized by catalytic asymmetric hydrophosphonylation in the presence of a bifunctional phosphonium salt catalyst. The desired hydrophosphonylation products were obtained in good yields with high enantioselectivities, and scale&#8208;up reactions and further derivations were successfully accomplished. Some control experiments were also conducted to elucidate the plausible reaction mechanism of this chemical transformation.

         <title>C=C Bond Oxidative Cleavage of BODIPY Photocages by Visible Light</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 44, Page 11268-11272, August 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The regioselective oxidative cleavage of a C=C bond from a boron&#8208;dipyrrolemethene (BODIPY) photocage has been realized under 630&#8197;nm illumination; this generated an aldehyde compound and a thiol fluorescent probe. This reaction was demonstrated inside live cells by monitoring the aldehyde release in real time. In particular, the photocage can easily be functionalized with a mannose group so as to acquire the ability to target cancer cells.







Abstract
Photocages for protection and the controlled release of bioactive compounds have been widely investigated. However, the vast majority of these photocages employ the cleavage of single bonds and high&#8208;energy ultraviolet light. The construction of a photoactivation system that uses visible light to cleave unsaturated bonds still remains a challenge. Herein, we report a regioselective oxidative cleavage of C=C bonds from a boron&#8208;dipyrrolemethene (BODIPY)&#8208;based photocage by illumination at 630&#8197;nm, resulting in a free aldehyde and a thiol fluorescent probe. This strategy was demonstrated in live HeLa cells, and the generated &#945;&#8208;formyl&#8208;BODIPY allowed real&#8208;time monitoring of aldehyde release in the cells. In particular, it is shown that a mannose&#8208;functionalized photocage can target HepG2 cells.

Abstract
The separation of ethane/ethylene mixture by using metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) as adsorbents is strongly associated with the pore size&#8208;sieving effect and the adsorbent&#8208;adsorbate interaction. Herein, solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy is utilized to explore the host&#8208;guest interaction and ethane/ethylene separation mechanism on zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs). Preferential access to the ZIF&#8208;8 and ZIF&#8208;8&#8208;90 frameworks by ethane compared to ethylene is directly visualized from two&#8208;dimensional 1H&#8208;1H spin diffusion MAS NMR spectroscopy and further verified by computational density distributions. The 1H MAS NMR spectroscopy provides an alternative for straightforwardly extracting the adsorption selectivity of ethane/ethylene mixture at 1.1&#8764;9.6&#8197;bar in ZIFs, which is consistent with the IAST predictions.

         <title>Synthesis of Cu&#8208;Modified Nickel Oxide Nanocrystals and Their Applications as Hole&#8208;Injection layers for Quantum&#8208;Dot Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 44, Page 11298-11302, August 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple post&#8208;synthetic surface&#8208;modification strategy to anchor Cu species onto the surfaces of as&#8208;prepared NiOx nanocrystals, leading to Cu&#8208;modified NiOx (NiOx&#8208;Cu) nanocrystals was developed. The low&#8208;temperature&#8208;processed (135&#8201;&#176;C) films based on the NiOx&#8208;Cu nanocrystals show enhanced conductance, which is beneficial for use as hole&#8208;injection layers for quantum&#8208;dot light&#8208;emitting diodes.







Abstract
Solution&#8208;processed NiOx thin films have been applied as hole&#8208;injection layers (HILs) in quantum&#8208;dot light&#8208;emitting diodes (QLEDs). The commonly used NiOx HILs are prepared by the precursor&#8208;based route, which requires high annealing temperatures of over 275&#8201;&#176;C to in&#8197;situ convert the precursors into oxide films. Such high processing temperatures of NiOx HILs hinder their applications in flexible devices. Herein, we report a low&#8208;temperature approach based on Cu&#8208;modified NiOx (NiOx&#8208;Cu) nanocrystals to prepare HILs.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A simple post-synthetic&lt;/b&gt; surface-modification strategy to anchor Cu species onto the surfaces of as-prepared NiO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; nanocrystals, leading to Cu-modified NiO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; (NiO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;-Cu) nanocrystals was developed. The low-temperature-processed (135&#8201;&#176;C) films based on the NiO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;-Cu nanocrystals show enhanced conductance, which is beneficial for use as hole-injection layers for quantum-dot light-emitting diodes.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solution-processed NiO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; thin films have been applied as hole-injection layers (HILs) in quantum-dot light-emitting diodes (QLEDs). The commonly used NiO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; HILs are prepared by the precursor-based route, which requires high annealing temperatures of over 275&#8201;&#176;C to in&#8197;situ convert the precursors into oxide films. Such high processing temperatures of NiO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; HILs hinder their applications in flexible devices. Herein, we report a low-temperature approach based on Cu-modified NiO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; (NiO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;-Cu) nanocrystals to prepare HILs. A simple post-synthetic surface-modification step, which anchors the copper agents onto the surfaces of oxide nanocrystals, is developed to improve the electrical conductivity of the low-temperature-processed (135&#8201;&#176;C) oxide-nanocrystal thin films. In consequence, QLEDs based on the NiO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;-Cu HILs exhibit an external quantum efficiency of 17.5&#8201;% and a T&lt;sub&gt;95&lt;/sub&gt; operational lifetime of &#8764;2,800&#8197;h at an initial brightness of 1,000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, meeting the commercialization requirements for display applications. The results shed light on the potential of using NiO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;-Cu HILs for realizing high-performance flexible QLEDs.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>A Novel Reactivity of Phosphanylalumane (&gt;P&#8722;Al&lt;): Reversible Addition of a Saturated Interelement Bond to Olefins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 44, Page 11273-11278, August 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Keen on alkenes: Phosphanylalumane (P&#8722;Al single&#8208;bond compound) was treated with relatively small terminal olefins (ethylene, propylene, and hex&#8208;1&#8208;ene) at room temperature. Heating of propylene&#8208; and hex&#8208;1&#8208;ene adducts regenerated the P&#8722;Al bond with liberation of the corresponding olefins. An unprecedented reactivity of the ethylene adduct with the release of ethylene was demonstrated, in sharp contrast to the conventional P/B system.







Abstract
The reversible addition of olefins to a phosphanylalumane, P&#8722;Al single&#8208;bond species, was investigated. The P&#8722;Al bond added to ethylene and relatively small terminal alkenes (propylene and hex&#8208;1&#8208;ene) at room temperature to give the corresponding alkene adducts. Heating the terminal alkene adducts released the corresponding alkenes and regenerated the P&#8722;Al bond, but no release of ethylene was observed even under vacuum conditions. The reactivity of ethylene adduct as a new saturated C2 vicinal P/Al&#8208;based FLP was also investigated. The ethylene adduct was found to undergo complexation with nitriles to give the corresponding nitrile adducts to the Al center, which retained the ethylene tether as in the case of the corresponding P/B&#8208;based FLP. However, the reactivity of ethylene toward CO2 and benzaldehyde differed from that of the P/B system giving the corresponding adducts.

         <title>Iminosugar C&#8208;Glycosides Work as Pharmacological Chaperones of NAGLU, a Glycosidase Involved in MPS IIIB Rare Disease**
</title>

Capitalizing on the X&#8208;ray structure of two NAGLU&#8208;homoiminosugar complexes, the synthesis and evaluation as glycosidase inhibitors of a library of rationally designed iminosugar C&#8208;glycosides led to the discovery of several selective NAGLU inhibitors and allowed the identification of a pharmacological chaperone candidate to treat mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIB, a rare and devastating disease.







Abstract
Mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIB is a devastating neurological disease caused by a lack of the lysosomal enzyme, &#945;&#8208;N&#8208;acetylglucosaminidase (NAGLU), leading to a toxic accumulation of heparan sulfate. Herein we explored a pharmacological chaperone approach to enhance the residual activity of NAGLU in patient fibroblasts. Capitalizing on the three&#8208;dimensional structures of two modest homoiminosugar&#8208;based NAGLU inhibitors in complex with bacterial homolog of NAGLU, CpGH89, we have synthesized a library of 17 iminosugar C&#8208;glycosides mimicking N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;D&#8208;glucosamine and bearing various pseudo&#8208;anomeric substituents of both &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;configuration. Elaboration of the aglycon moiety results in low micromolar selective inhibitors of human recombinant NAGLU, but surprisingly it is the non&#8208;functionalized and wrongly configured &#946;&#8208;homoiminosugar that was proved to act as the most promising pharmacological chaperone, promoting a 2.4 fold activity enhancement of mutant NAGLU at its optimal concentration.

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Synthesis of Highly Fluorescent and CPL&#8208;Active Dispiroindeno[2,1&#8208;c]fluorenes</title>

Spiraling under control: Configurationally stable [7]&#8208;helical dispirodihydro[2,1&#8208;c]indenofluorenes (DSF&#8208;IFs) have been synthesized with er values up to 99&#8201;:&#8201;1 by using intramolecular [2+2+2] cycloaddition of tethered triynediols catalyzed by RhI/SEGPHOS&#174;. The chiral DSF&#8208;IFs had circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) activity and exceptionally high fluorescence.







Abstract
The enantioselective synthesis of chiral [7]&#8208;helical dispirodihydro[2,1&#8208;c]indenofluorenes (DSF&#8208;IFs) was achieved for the first time in good yields with high er values (er up to 99&#8201;:&#8201;1). The crucial step of the whole reaction sequence was the enantioselective intramolecular [2+2+2] cycloaddition of tethered triynediols to indenofluorenediols, which was catalyzed by a Rh/SEGPHOS&#174; complex. Further transformations led to the corresponding DSF&#8208;IFs. The prepared helically chiral DSF&#8208;IFs combine circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) activity (glum=&#8764;10&#8722;3) with exceptionally high fluorescence quantum yields (up to &#934;lum=0.97).

         <title>Correlation between the Dynamics of Nanoconfined Water and the Local Chemical Environment in Calcium Silicate Hydrate Nanominerals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 44, Page 11238-11238, August 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#8220;In this work, we have employed the innovative supercritical water&#8208;based technology for synthesising high crystalline calcium silicate hydrate nanominerals, finely controlling the Si&#8208;OH and Ca&#8208;OH contents. A key result of this study relies on the observation, for the first time, of a transformation from an ordered &#8220;ice&#8208;like&#8221; water distribution in the Si&#8208;OH&#8208;rich model nanocrystal to a disordered &#8220;liquid&#8208;like&#8221; one in the Ca&#8208;OH&#8208;rich counterpart.&#8221; Read more about the story behind the cover in the Cover Profile and about the research itself on page&#8197;11309&#8197;ff.

     alt="Correlation between the Dynamics of Nanoconfined Water and the Local Chemical Environment in Calcium Silicate Hydrate Nanominerals"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;&lt;i&gt;In this work, we have employed the innovative supercritical water-based technology for synthesising high crystalline calcium silicate hydrate nanominerals, finely controlling the Si-OH and Ca-OH contents. A key result of this study relies on the observation, for the first time, of a transformation from an ordered &#8220;ice-like&#8221; water distribution in the Si-OH-rich model nanocrystal to a disordered &#8220;liquid-like&#8221; one in the Ca-OH-rich counterpart&lt;/i&gt;.&#8221; Read more about the story behind the cover in the Cover Profile and about the research itself on page&#8197;11309&#8197;ff.

         <title>Dicyano&#8208;Imidazole: A Facile Generation of Pure Blue TADF Materials for OLEDs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The efficiencies of the blue&#8208;emissive devices with imM&#8208;SPAC and imM&#8208;DMAC obtained in this work are the highest among the reported imidazole&#8208;based TADF&#8208;OLEDs, which are 13.8&#8201;% and 13.4&#8201;%, respectively. Both of Commission Internationale de l&#8242;Eclairage (CIE) coordinates are close to the saturated blue region at (0.17, 0.18) and (0.16, 0.19), respectively. Combining these tailor&#8208;made TADF compounds with specific device architectures, electroluminescent (EL) emission from sky&#8208;blue to deep&#8208;blue could be achieved, proving their great potential in EL applications.







Abstract
A series of dicyano&#8208;imidazole&#8208;based molecules with thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) properties were synthesized to obtain pure blue&#8208;emitting organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). The targeted molecules used dicyano&#8208;imidazole with a short&#8208;conjugated system as the electron acceptor to strong intermolecular &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions, and provide a relatively shallow energy level of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO). The cyano group was selected to improve imidazole as an electron acceptor due to its prominent electron&#8208;transporting characteristics. Four different electron donors, that is, 9,9&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;9,10&#8208;dihydroacridine (DMAC), 10H&#8208;spiro(acridine&#8208;9,9&#8217;&#8208;fluoren) (SPAC), and 9,9&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;9,10&#8208;dihydroacridine (DPAC), were used to alternate the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level to tune the emission color further. The crowded molecular structure in space makes the electron donor and acceptor almost orthogonal, reducing the energy gap (&#916;EST) between the first excited singlet (S1) and the triplet (T1) states and introducing significant TADF property. The efficiencies of the blue&#8208;emissive devices with imM&#8208;SPAC and imM&#8208;DMAC obtained in this work are the highest among the reported imidazole&#8208;based TADF&#8208;OLEDs, which are 13.8&#8201;% and 13.4&#8201;%, respectively.

         <title>Azo&#8208;Functionalized Zirconium&#8208;Based Metal&#8722;Organic Polyhedron as an Efficient Catalyst for CO2 Fixation with Epoxides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel zirconium&#8208;based metal organic polyhedron (MOP) with azo functionality has been synthesized and exhibits high catalytic activity for CO2 fixation. The azo group could enhance the solubility of the MOP as well as being good Lewis base sites to enrich CO2. DFT calculation showed Zr&#8208;AZDA MOP with the Lewis activity of Zr sites could dramatically reduce the energy barrier of CO2 cycloaddition.







Abstract
Chemical fixation of CO2 as C1 source at ambient temperature and low pressure is an energy&#8208;saving way to make use of the green&#8208;house gas, but it still remains a challenge since efficient catalyst with high catalytic active sites is required. Here, a novel monoclinic azo&#8208;functionalized Zr&#8208;based metal&#8722;organic polyhedron (Zr&#8208;AZDA) has been prepared and applied in CO2 fixation with epoxides. The inherent azo groups not only endow Zr&#8208;AZDA with good solubilization, but also act as basic sites to enrich CO2 showing efficient synergistic catalysis as confirmed by TPD&#8208;CO2 analysis. XPS results demonstrate that the Zr active sites in Zr&#8208;AZDA possess suitable Lewis acidity, which satisfies both substrates activation and products desorption. DFT calculation indicates the energy barrier of the rate&#8208;determining step in CO2 cycloaddition could be reduced remarkably (by ca. 60.9&#8201;%) in the presence of Zr&#8208;AZDA, which may rationalize the mild and efficient reaction condition employed (80&#8201;&#176;C and 1&#8197;atm of CO2). The work provides an effective multi&#8208;functional cooperative method for improvement of CO2 cycloaddition.

         <title>The Coordinate Reaction Model: An Obstacle to Interpreting the Emergence of Chemical Complexity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Accurate descriptions: Time&#8208;invariant (T1) models are the basis of the molecular description of modern organic chemistry. However, applied to open systems far from equilibrium, they may lead to erroneous interpretations. In such systems, stationary states must be described, in both their stability and evolution (generalized evolution criterion), through irreversibility (time variant, T&#8722;1) by macroscopic systems methods. Even ordinate, abscissa and curves, in reductionistic graphical descriptions; have different meanings.







Abstract
The way chemical transformations are described by models based on microscopic reversibility does not take into account the irreversibility of natural processes, and therefore, in complex chemical networks working in open systems, misunderstandings may arise about the origin and causes of the stability of non&#8208;equilibrium stationary states, and general constraints on evolution in systems that are far from equilibrium. In order to be correctly simulated and understood, the chemical behavior of complex systems requires time&#8208;dependent models, otherwise the irreversibility of natural phenomena is overlooked. Micro reversible models based on the reaction&#8208;coordinate model are time invariant and are therefore unable to explain the evolution of open dissipative systems. The important points necessary for improving the modeling and simulations of complex chemical systems are: a) understanding the physical potential related to the entropy production rate, which is in general an inexact differential of a state function, and b) the interpretation and application of the so&#8208;called general evolution criterion (GEC), which is the general thermodynamic constraint for the evolution of dissipative chemical systems.

         <title>Quantitative Distinction between Noble Metals Located in Mesopores from Those on the External Surface</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three different approaches to quantitatively distinguish the active sites on the surface of a mesoporous material from those sites located in the pores are compared. Arylphosphine probes and 31P MAS NMR spectroscopy are applied to quantify the introduced noble metals. The most promising method was to selectively fill the pores with an inert (tetraethylorthosilicate) and to subsequently quantify the accessible sites.







Abstract
We compare three methods for quantitatively distinguishing the location of noble metal (NM) particles in mesopores from those found on the external support surface. MCM&#8208;41 and SBA&#8208;15 with NM located in mesopores or on the external surface were prepared and characterized by TEM. 31P MAS NMR spectroscopy was used to quantify arylphosphines in complexes with NM. Phosphine/NM ratios drop from 2.0 to 0.2 when increasing the probe diameter from 1.08 to 1.54&#8197;nm. The reaction between NM and triphenylphosphine (TPP) within 3.0&#8197;nm MCM&#8208;41 pores takes due to confinement effects multiple weeks. In contrast, external NM react with TPP instantly. A promising method is filling the pores by using the pore volume impregnation technique with tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS). TPP loading revealed that 66&#8201;% of NMs are located on the external surface of MCM&#8208;41. The pore filling method can be used in association with any probe molecule, also for the quantification of acid sites.

Circles in a spiral: The synthesis and physical properties of a helical chiral bicyclic hydrocarbon are presented. The design of the Gel&#228;nder architecture is based on a rigid, chiral, room&#8208;temperature&#8208;stable central ortho&#8208;tetraphenylene subunit, which is further developed and twice macrocyclized to provide the target structure. Pure enantiomers are obtained by chromatography with a chiral stationary phase and allow the investigation of the chiroptical properties. Comparison between recorded and simulated CD spectra allows these enantiostable model compounds to be assigned.







Abstract
A new type of &#8220;Gel&#228;nder&#8221; molecule based on a ortho&#8208;tetraphenylene core is presented. The central para&#8208;quaterphenyl backbone is wrapped by a 4,4&#8217;&#8208;di((Z)&#8208;styryl)&#8208;1,1&#8217;&#8208;biphenyl banister, with its aryl rings covalently attached to all four phenyl rings of the backbone. The resulting helical chiral bicyclic architecture consists exclusively of sp2&#8208;hybridized carbon atoms. The target structure was assembled by expanding the central ortho&#8208;tetraphenylene subunit with the required additional phenyl rings followed by a twofold macrocyclization. The first macrocyclization attempts based on a twofold McMurry coupling were successful but low yielding; the second strategy, profiting from olefin metathesis, provided satisfying yields. Hydrogenation of the olefins resulted in a saturated derivative of similar topology, thereby allowing the interdependence between saturation and physico&#8208;chemical properties to be studied. The target structures, including their solid&#8208;state structures, were fully characterized. The helical chiral bicycle was synthesized as a racemate and separated into pure enantiomers by HPLC on a chiral stationary phase. Comparison of recorded and simulated chiroptical properties allowed the enantiomers to be assigned.

         <title>An Electrochemical Route for Special Oxidative Ring&#8208;Opening of Indoles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel method of electrochemical oxidation cleavage of indole derivatives and reorganization with alcohols to construct a variety of useful o&#8208;amidobenzoate building blocks was developed. The reaction involves a mild and easy handling protocol that occurs without any stoichiometric metals and extra oxidants. N&#8208;unprotected indoles or indoles substituted with electron&#8208;withdrawing groups, even free indole could give the desired product, which expanded the substrate range.







Abstract
A novel electrochemical protocol for the oxidative cleavage of indoles has been developed, which o&#64256;ers a simple way to access synthetically useful anthranilic acid derivatives. In undivided cells, a wide variety of indoles and alcohol compounds are examined to a&#64256;ord amide ester aromatics without using extra oxidants and stoichiometric metal catalysts, which avoids the formation of undesired by&#8208;products and exhibits high atom economy. The products we described in this perspective represent a synthetic intermediate in numerous drug molecules and industrial chemical reagents and remarkably show potential application in the future.

         <title>N&#8208;Heterocyclic Iod(az)olium Salts &#8211; Potent Halogen&#8208;Bond Donors in Organocatalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;Heterocyclic iod(az)olium salts are introduced as highly potent halogen bonding (XB) organocatalysts reactivity in diverse test reactions based on the activation of halides and neutral species. Especially, N&#8208;methylated, dicationic derivatives outperformed all known monodentate iodine(I) and (III) XB&#8208;donors as well as the strong Lewis acid BF3.







Abstract
This article describes the application of N&#8208;heterocyclic iod(az)olium salts (NHISs) as highly reactive organocatalysts. A variety of mono&#8208; and dicationic NHISs are described and utilized as potent XB&#8208;donors in halogen&#8208;bond catalysis. They were benchmarked in seven diverse test reactions in which the activation of carbon&#8208; and metal&#8208;chloride bonds as well as carbonyl and nitro groups was achieved. N&#8208;methylated dicationic NHISs rendered the highest reactivity in all investigated catalytic applications with reactivities even higher than all previously described monodentate XB&#8208;donors based on iodine(I) and (III) and the strong Lewis acid BF3.

         <title>The Role of Alkali Cation Intercalates on the Electrochemical Characteristics of Nb2CTX MXene for Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Different size cations from aqueous salt electrolyte intercalating into layered Nb2CTx electrode in supercapacitor were explored. The extent of interlayer expansion of electrode material varies with the size of the intercalation cations. Na+ ions showed the slowest permeation rate in the spacing between Nb2CTx layers compared to Li+ and K+.







Abstract
The intercalation of cations into layered&#8208;structure electrode materials has long been studied in depth for energy storage applications. In particular, Li+&#8208;, Na+&#8208;, and K+&#8208;based cation transport in energy storage devices such as batteries and electrochemical capacitors is closely related to the capacitance behavior. We have exploited different sizes of cations from aqueous salt electrolytes intercalating into a layered Nb2CTx electrode in a supercapacitor for the first time. As a result, we have demonstrated that capacitive performance was dependent on cation intercalation behavior. The interlayer spacing expansion of the electrode material can be observed in Li2SO4, Na2SO4, and K2SO4 electrolytes with d&#8208;spacing. Additionally, our results showed that the Nb2CTx electrode exhibited higher electrochemical performance in the presence of Li2SO4 than in that of Na2SO4 and K2SO4. This is partly because the smaller&#8208;sized Li+ transports quickly and intercalates between the layers of Nb2CTx easily. Poor ion transport in the Na2SO4 electrolyte limited the electrode capacitance and presented the lowest electrochemical performance, although the cation radius follows Li+&gt;Na+&gt;K+. Our experimental studies provide direct evidence for the intercalation mechanism of Li+, Na+, and K+ on the 2D layered Nb2CTx electrode, which provides a new path for exploring the relationship between intercalated cations and other MXene electrodes.

         <title>Surface Chemistry Impact on the Light Absorption by Colloidal Quantum Dots</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>At the size scale at which quantum confinement effects arise in inorganic semiconductors, the materials&#8217; surface&#8208;to&#8208;volume ratio is intrinsically high. This consideration sets surface chemistry as a powerful tool to exert further control on the electronic structure of the inorganic semiconductors. Among the materials that experience the quantum confinement regime, those prepared via colloidal synthetic procedures (the colloidal quantum dots &#8211;and wires and wells, too&#8211;) are prone to undergo surface reactions in the solution phase and thus represent an ideal framework to study the ensemble impact of surface chemistry on the materials&#8217; electronic structure. It is here discussed such an impact at the ground state by using the absorption spectrum of the colloidal quantum dots as a descriptor. The experiments show that the chemical species (the ligands) at the colloidal quantum dot surface induce changes to the optical band gap, the absorption coefficient at all wavelengths, and the ionization potential. These evidences point to a description of the colloidal quantum dot (the ligand/core adduct) as an indecomposable species, in which the orbitals localized on the ligands and the core mix in each other&#8217;s electric field. This description goes beyond conventional models that conceive the ligands on the basis of pure electrostatic arguments (i.e., either as a dielectric shell or as electric dipoles) or as a mere potential energy barrier at the core boundaries.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;At the size scale at which quantum confinement effects arise in inorganic semiconductors, the materials&#8217; surface-to-volume ratio is intrinsically high. This consideration sets surface chemistry as a powerful tool to exert further control on the electronic structure of the inorganic semiconductors. Among the materials that experience the quantum confinement regime, those prepared via colloidal synthetic procedures (the colloidal quantum dots &#8211;and wires and wells, too&#8211;) are prone to undergo surface reactions in the solution phase and thus represent an ideal framework to study the ensemble impact of surface chemistry on the materials&#8217; electronic structure. It is here discussed such an impact at the ground state by using the absorption spectrum of the colloidal quantum dots as a descriptor. The experiments show that the chemical species (the ligands) at the colloidal quantum dot surface induce changes to the optical band gap, the absorption coefficient at all wavelengths, and the ionization potential. These evidences point to a description of the colloidal quantum dot (the ligand/core adduct) as an indecomposable species, in which the orbitals localized on the ligands and the core mix in each other&#8217;s electric field.

         <title>Osmaindenes: Synthesis and Reversible Mechanochromism Characteristics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of novel osmaindenes  1  &#8211;  6  bearing different substituents (CF  3  , H, I, Br, OCH  3  , N(Ph)  2  ) has been synthesized by nucleophilic reaction of water with the corresponding aromatic osmanaphthalyne complexes. All osmaindenes  1  &#8211;  6  have been characterized by elemental analysis (EA) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, although the low solubilities of  3  and  4  precluded the accumulation of their  13  C NMR spectra. Osmaindenes  2  ,  3  and  5  have also been characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. Subsequently, through solid&#8208;state fluorescence spectroscopy, mechanochromic studies, and powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, we found that osmaindenes  1  &#8211;  6  fluoresce at wavelengths in the range 500&#8211;800 nm, while also displaying reversible mechanochromic properties. The solid&#8208;state fluorescence emission of  1  after grinding extends into the near&#8208;infrared region. This research provides new insight into the design and synthesis of metallic materials with excellent mechanochromic properties.</dc:description>

         <title>The stereoselective oxidation of para&#8208;substituted benzenes by a cytochrome P450 biocatalyst.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The serine 244 to aspartate (S244D) variant of the cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP199A4 was used to expand its substrate range beyond benzoic acids. Substrates, in which the carboxylate group of the benzoic acid moiety is replaced, were oxidised with high activity by the S244D mutant (product formation rates &gt; 60 nmol.(nmol&#8208;CYP) &#8722;1 .min &#8722;1 ) and with total turnover numbers of up to 20,000. Ethyl &#945;&#8208;hydroxylation was more rapid than methyl oxidation, styrene epoxidation and S &#8208;oxidation. The S244D mutant catalysed the ethyl hydroxylation, epoxidation and sulfoxidation reactions with an excess of one stereoisomer (in some instances up to &gt;98%). The crystal structure of 4&#8208;methoxybenzoic acid&#8208;bound CYP199A4 S244D showed that the active site architecture and the substrate orientation were similar to that of the WT enzyme. Overall, this work demonstrates that CYP199A4 can catalyse the stereospecific hydroxylation, epoxidation or sulfoxidation of substituted benzene substrates under mild conditions resulting in more sustainable transformations using this heme monooxygenase enzyme.</dc:description>

         <title>Large Isotope Effects in Organometallic Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The kinetic isotope effect (KIE) is key to understanding reaction mechanisms in many areas of chemistry and chemical biology, including organometallic chemistry. This ratio of rate constants,  k  H  /  k  D  , typically falls between 1&#8208;7. However, KIEs up to 105 have been reported, and can even be so large that reactivity with deuterium is unobserved. We collect here examples of large KIEs across organometallic chemistry, in catalytic and stoichiometric reactions, along with their mechanistic interpretations. Large KIEs occur in proton transfer reactions such as protonation of organometallic complexes and clusters, protonolysis of metal&#8211;carbon bonds, and dihydrogen reactivity. C&#8211;H activation reactions with large KIEs occur with late and early transition metals, photogenerated intermediates, and abstraction by metal&#8208;oxo complexes. We categorize the mechanistic interpretations of large KIEs into the following three types: (a) proton tunneling, (b) compound effects from multiple steps, and (c) semi&#8208;classical effects on a single step. This comprehensive collection of large KIEs in organometallics provides context for future mechanistic interpretation.</dc:description>

         <title>Rational Fabrication of Multiple&#160;Dimensional Assemblies from Tryptophan&#8208;Based Racemate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fabricating structural complex assemblies from simple amino acid&#8208;based derivatives is attracting great research interests due to their easy accessibility and preparation. However, the morphological regulation of racemates (an equimolar mixture of enantiomers) were largely overlooked. In this work, through rational modulation of kinetic and thermodynamic parameters, we achieved multiple dimensional architectures employing tryptophan&#8208;based racemate (RPWM). Upon assembling, 1D bundled nanofibers, 2D lamellar nanostructure and 3D urchin&#8208;like microflowers could be obtained depending on the solvents used. The corresponding morphology evolutions were successfully illustrated by changing the enantiomeric excess (ee) value. Moreover, for RPWM, uniform 0D nanospheres were formed in H  2  O under 4 &#8451;, which could spontaneously convert into lamella under ambient temperature. Taking advantages of its temperature&#8208;responsive phase change behavior, RPWM assemblies exhibited excellent removal efficiency for organic dye RhB, and could be reused for several consecutive cycles without significant changes in its removal performance. Taken together, it&#8217;s rational to envision that the engineering of racemates assembly pathways can greatly increase the robustness in a wide variety of supramolecular materials and further lead to their blooming versatile applications.</dc:description>

         <title>How Aromatic Fluorination Exchanges the Interaction Role of Pyridine with Carbonyl Compounds: The Pentafluoropyridine&#183;&#183;&#183;Formaldehyde Adduct</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The rotational spectrum of the weakly bound complex pentafluoropyridine&#183;&#183;&#183;formaldehyde has been investigated using Fourier transform microwave spectroscopy. From the analysis of the rotational parameters of the parent species and of the  13  C and  15  N isotopologues, the structural arrangement of the adduct has been unambiguously established. The full ring fluorination of pyridine has a dramatic effect on its binding properties: It alters the electron density distribution at the &#960;&#8208;cloud of pyridine creating a &#960;&#8208;hole and changing its electron donor&#8208;acceptor capabilities. In the complex, formaldehyde lies above the aromatic ring with one of the oxygen lone pairs, as conventionally envisaged, pointing toward its centre. This lone pair&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960;&#8208;hole interaction, reinforced by a weak C&#8208;H&#183;&#183;&#183;N interaction, indicates an exchange of the electron&#8208;acceptor roles of both molecules when compared to the pyridine&#183;&#183;&#183;formaldehyde adduct. Tunnelling doublets due to the internal rotation of formaldehyde have also been observed and analysed leading to a discussion on the competition between lone pair&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960;&#8208;hole and &#960; &#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; staking interactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Engineering Functional Interface with Built&#8208;in Catalytic and Self&#8208;oxidation Sites for Highly Stable Lithium Sulfur Battery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium sulfur (Li&#8208;S) battery has attracted great attention due to its high theoretical energy density. The rapid redox conversion of lithium polysulfides (LiPS) is effective for solving the serious shuttle effect and improving utilization of active materials. The functional design of separator interface with the fast charge transfer and active catalytic sites is desirable for accelerating the conversion of intermediates. Herein, the graphene&#8208;wrapped MnCO3  nanowire (G@MC) was prepared and utilized to engineer the separator interface. G@MC with active Mn2+  sites can effectively anchor the LiPS by forming the Mn&#8208;S chemical bond according to our theoretical calculation results. In addition, the catalytic Mn2+  sites and conductive graphene layer of G@MC could accelerate the reversible conversion of LiPS  via  the spontaneous &#8220;self&#8208;redox&#8221; reaction and the rapid electron transfer in electrochemical process. As a result, the G@MC&#8208;based battery exhibits only 0.038% capacity decay (per cycle) after 1000 cycles at 2.0 C. This work affords new insights for designing the integrated functional interface for stable Li&#8208;S battery.</dc:description>

         <title>Graphene Oxide&#8208;Assisted Covalent Triazine Framework for Boosting Photocatalytic H2 Evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The &#960;&#8208;conjugation&#8208;linked CTF&#8208;1/GO hybrid material fabricated by facile low&#8208;temperature condensation of 1,4&#8208;dicyanobenzene in the presence of graphene oxide (GO) exhibited an optimum H2 evolution rate of 2262.4&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1 under visible light irradiation, which was 9 times that of pure CTF&#8208;1. This result indicates addition of certain additives, particularly like graphene, could significantly improve the materials&#8242; conductivity, make the crystallinity of the framework itself play a less critical role.







Abstract
Covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs) with two&#8208;dimensional structures have exhibited promising visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced H2 evolution performance. However, it is still a challenge to improve their activity. Herein, we report &#960;&#8208;conjugation&#8208;linked CTF&#8208;1/GO for boosting photocatalytic H2 evolution. The CTF&#8208;1/GO hybrid material was obtained by a facile low&#8208;temperature condensation of 1,4&#8208;dicyanobenzene in the presence of GO. The results of photocatalytic H2 evolution indicate that the optimum hybrid, CTF&#8208;1/GO&#8208;3.0, exhibited an H2 evolution rate of 2262.4&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;h&#8722;1 under visible light irradiation, which was 9 times that of pure CTF&#8208;1. The enhanced photocatalytic performance could be attributed to the fact that GO in CTF&#8208;1/GO hybrids not only acts as an electron collector and transporter like a &#8220;bridge&#8221; to facilitate the separation and transfer of photogenerated charges but also shortens the electron migration path due to its thin sheet layer uniformly distribution over CTF&#8208;1. This work could help future development of novel conjugated CTF&#8208;based composite materials as high&#8208;efficiency photocatalyst for photocatalysis.

         <title>NIR&#8208;Emissive Chromium(0), Molybdenum(0), and Tungsten(0) Complexes in the Solid State at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents emissive Cr(0), Mo(0), and W(0) complexes that contain a bidentate pyridyl&#8208;mesoionic carbene ligand and CO coligands. These systems exhibit dual vis and NIR II emissions at room temperature. The emissive excited triplet states were characterized by temperature&#8208;dependent luminescence and step&#8208;san FTIR spectroscopy in combination with density functional theory. The NIR quantum yield increases from Cr(0) over Mo(0) to W(0), reaching a very high value of 1.4&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;10&#8722;3 at room temperature.







Abstract
The development of NIR emitters based on earth&#8208;abundant elements is an important goal in contemporary science. We present here Cr(0), Mo(0), and W(0) carbonyl complexes with a pyridyl&#8208;mesoionic carbene (MIC) based ligand. A detailed photophysical investigation shows that all the complexes exhibit dual emissions in the VIS and in the NIR region. The emissive excited states are assigned to two distinct triplet states by time&#8208;resolved emission and step&#8208;scan FTIR spectroscopy at variable temperature, supported by density functional theory. In particular, the NIR emissive triplet state exhibits unprecedented lifetimes of up to 600&#177;10&#8197;ns and quantum yields reaching 1.7&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;10&#8722;4 at room temperature. These are the first examples of Cr(0), Mo(0) and W(0) complexes that emit in the NIR II region.

         <title>Making Aromatic Phosphorus Heterocycles More Basic and Nucleophilic: Synthesis, Characterization and Reactivity of the First Phosphinine Selenide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis and isolation of a phosphinine selenide was achieved for the first time. The &#963;&#8208;electron donating Me3Si&#8208;substituents significantly increase the energy of the phosphorus lone pair and hence its basicity, making the heterocycle considerably more basic and nucleophilic than the unsubstituted phosphinine C5H5P, as confirmed by the calculated gas&#8208;phase basicities. The novel phosphinine selenides show a distinct reactivity towards dienophiles, Au(I)Cl as well as alcohols.







Abstract
The synthesis and isolation of a phosphinine selenide was achieved for the first time by reacting red selenium with 2,6&#8208;bis(trimethylsilyl)phosphinine. The rather large coupling constant of 1JP,Se=883&#8197;Hz is in line with a P&#8722;Se bond of high s&#8208;character. The &#963;&#8208;electron donating Me3Si&#8208;substituents significantly increase the energy of the phosphorus lone pair and hence its basicity, making the heterocycle considerably more basic and nucleophilic than the unsubstituted phosphinine C5H5P, as confirmed by the calculated gas phase basicities. NBO calculations further reveal that the lone pairs of the selenium atom are stabilized through donor&#8208;acceptor interactions with antibonding orbitals of the aromatic ring. The novel phosphinine selenide shows a distinct reactivity towards hexafluoro&#8208;2&#8208;butyne, Au(I)Cl as well as iPrOH. Our results pave the way for new perspectives in the chemistry of phosphorus in low coordination.

         <title>Chemistry Platform for the Ultrafast Continuous Synthesis of High&#8208;Quality III&#8211;V Quantum Dots</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A III&#8211;V quantum dots (QDs) chemistry platform is presented. III&#8208;nitrides QDs are prepared in short residence times in a one&#8208;step continuous process involving supercritical solvents. InxGa1&#8208;xN QDs fabricated via this platform exhibit strong photoluminescence with continuous bandgap shift towards lower energies measured when increasing indium content. The chemistry platform proposed could be easily transferred to other binary and ternary III&#8211;V systems source.







Abstract
A chemistry platform for the fast continuous synthesis of III&#8211;V quantum dots is demonstrated. III&#8208;nitride QDs are prepared by using short residence times (less than 30&#8197;s) in a one&#8208;step continuous process with supercritical solvents. GaN QDs prepared via this route exhibit strong UV photoluminescence with a structuring of the emission signal at low temperature (5&#8197;K), confirming their high quality. An example of metal site substitution is given with the synthesis of InxGa1&#8208;xN solid solution. A continuous bandgap shift towards lower energies is demonstrated when increasing the indium content with strong photoluminescence signals from UV to visible. The chemistry platform proposed could be easily extrapolated to binary and ternary III phosphides or arsenides with the homologous V source.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A III&#8211;V quantum dots (QDs) chemistry platform&lt;/b&gt; is presented. III-nitrides QDs are prepared in short residence times in a one-step continuous process involving supercritical solvents. In&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;Ga&lt;sub&gt;1-x&lt;/sub&gt;N QDs fabricated via this platform exhibit strong photoluminescence with continuous bandgap shift towards lower energies measured when increasing indium content. The chemistry platform proposed could be easily transferred to other binary and ternary III&#8211;V systems source.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A chemistry platform for the fast continuous synthesis of III&#8211;V quantum dots is demonstrated. III-nitride QDs are prepared by using short residence times (less than 30&#8197;s) in a one-step continuous process with supercritical solvents. GaN QDs prepared via this route exhibit strong UV photoluminescence with a structuring of the emission signal at low temperature (5&#8197;K), confirming their high quality. An example of metal site substitution is given with the synthesis of In&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;Ga&lt;sub&gt;1-x&lt;/sub&gt;N solid solution. A continuous bandgap shift towards lower energies is demonstrated when increasing the indium content with strong photoluminescence signals from UV to visible. The chemistry platform proposed could be easily extrapolated to binary and ternary III phosphides or arsenides with the homologous V source.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Continuous Flow Synthesis of [Au(NHC)(Aryl)] (NHC=N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene) Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The continuous synthesis of a range of gold(I)&#8208;aryl complexes is reported for the first time. The recently showcased weak base route is successfully implemented into an operationally simple and readily scalable continuous flow procedure. The reported protocol allows for high reaction rates and mild reaction conditions, all in favor of more efficient and sustainable access to products which are valuable in catalysis, materials science and medicinal chemistry.







Abstract
The use of weak and inexpensive bases has recently opened promising perspectives towards the simpler and more sustainable synthesis of Au(I)&#8208;aryl complexes with valuable applications in catalysis, medicinal chemistry, and materials science. In recent years, continuous manufacturing has shown to be a reliable partner in establishing sustainable and controlled process scalability. Herein, the first continuous flow synthesis of a range of Au(I)&#8208;aryl starting from widely available boronic acids and various [Au(NHC)Cl] (NHC=N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene) complexes in unprecedentedly short reaction times and high yields is reported. Successful synthesis of previously non&#8208; or poorly accessible complexes exposed fascinating reactivity patterns. Via a gram&#8208;scale synthesis, convenient process scalability of the developed protocol was showcased.

         <title>Effectiveness of the Oxygenation over Classical Protonolysis Reactions: A Case of Alkylzinc Complexes Incorporating an Aminoalcoholate Ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alkylzinc aminoalcoholates have emerged as powerful catalysts in organic synthesis and polymerization processes. Despite extensive research, difficulties in the rational design of these catalytic systems have hitherto been encountered. Most of the major obstacles stem largely from the relatively limited knowledge of the structure&#8208;activity relationship of zinc catalysts. In fact, the key active species are often generated  in situ  via the protonolysis of the alkylzinc precursors. Herein, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the oxygenation over the classical protonolysis in the synthesis of zinc alkylperoxides stabilized by an aminoalcoholate ligand. The controlled oxygenation of a  tert  &#8208;butylzinc complex incorporating a pridinolum (  prinol  ) ligand leads to an&#160;adduct of a (  prinol  )ZnOO  t  Bu moiety with the parent  t  BuZn(  prinol  ) complex and a novel dimer [  t  BuOOZn(  prinol  )]  2  with terminal alkylperoxide groups.&#160;Although sparse examples of heteroleptic adducts of the [RZn(L)]  x  [ROOZn(L)]  y  &#8208;type are known, the reported herein homoleptic [ROOZn(L)]  x  aggregate is unprecedented. Strikingly, comparative studies involving reactions between  t  BuZn(  prinol  ) and  tert  &#8208;butylhydroperoxide or ethanol revealed that the respective seemingly simple zinc alkylperoxides, or zinc alkoxides, respectively, are not accessible via the classical alcoholysis. We believe that these game&#8208;changing results concerning multifaceted chemistry of organozinc aminoalcoholates should pave the way for more rational development of various Zn&#8208;based catalytic systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Selectively Deoxyfluorinated N&#8208;Acetyllactosamine Analogues as 19F NMR Probes to Study Carbohydrate&#8208;Galectin Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Six mono&#8208;deoxyfluorinated LacNAc analogues were prepared, and their affinity to galectin&#8208;1 and &#8722;3 was tested. Fluorination at positions 3, 4&#8242;, and 6&#8242; abrogated binding to galectin&#8208;1 and substantially reduced binding to galectin&#8208;3. Placement of fluorine at the positions 6 and 2&#8242; increased affinity to galectin&#8208;1, whereas binding to galectin&#8208;3 was unaffected. Fluorination at position 3&#8242; did not significantly influence binding to either galectin.







Abstract
Galectins are widely expressed galactose&#8208;binding lectins implied, for example, in immune regulation, metastatic spreading, and pathogen recognition. N&#8208;Acetyllactosamine (Gal&#946;1&#8208;4GlcNAc, LacNAc) and its oligomeric or glycosylated forms are natural ligands of galectins. To probe substrate specificity and binding mode of galectins, we synthesized a complete series of six mono&#8208;deoxyfluorinated analogues of LacNAc, in which each hydroxyl has been selectively replaced by fluorine while the anomeric position has been protected as methyl &#946;&#8208;glycoside. Initial evaluation of their binding to human galectin&#8208;1 and &#8208;3 by ELISA and 19F NMR T2&#8208;filter revealed that deoxyfluorination at C3, C4&#8242; and C6&#8242; completely abolished binding to galectin&#8208;1 but very weak binding to galectin&#8208;3 was still detectable. Moreover, deoxyfluorination of C2&#8242; caused an approximately 8&#8208;fold increase in the binding affinity towards galectin&#8208;1, whereas binding to galectin&#8208;3 was essentially not affected. Lipophilicity measurement revealed that deoxyfluorination at the Gal moiety affects log P very differently compared to deoxyfluorination at the GlcNAc moiety.

         <title>Targeted Chemical Modifications Identify Key Features of Carbohydrate Assemblies and Generate Tailored Carbohydrate Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Site&#8208;specific modifications identified key non&#8208;covalent interactions responsible for the supramolecular assembly of a disaccharide model. Electron diffraction (ED) and tomography enabled the correlation between molecular structure and nanoscale architecture, confirming that C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; edge&#8208;to&#8208;face type interactions between the aromatic rings and water&#8208;bridged hydrogen bonds between specific hydroxyl groups stabilized the assembly. The synthetic compounds were used to generate carbohydrate&#8208;based nanotubes, twisted ribbons, as well as spherical particles that were characterized with molecular level resolution.







Abstract
The molecular level description of carbohydrate assemblies is hampered by their structural complexity and the lack of suitable analytical methods. Here, we employed systematic chemical modifications to identify key non&#8208;covalent interactions that triggered the supramolecular assembly of a disaccharide model. While some modifications disrupted the supramolecular organization, others were tolerated, delivering important information on the aggregation process. The screening identified new geometries, including nanotubes, and twisted ribbons that were characterized with electron tomography and electron diffraction (ED) methods. This work demonstrates that the combination of synthetic chemistry and ED methods is a powerful tool to draw correlations between the molecular structure and the nanoscale architecture of carbohydrate assemblies.

         <title>Regioselective trans&#8208;Hydrostannation of Boron&#8208;Capped Alkynes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Peripheral: A hydrogen&#8208;bonding array in the periphery of the loaded ruthenium catalyst is the likely cause for the excellent regioselectivity observed in the hydrostannation of bench&#8208;stable alkynyl&#8208;B(aam) derivatives (aam=anthranilamido). The reaction follows a stereochemically unorthodox trans&#8208;addition mode and delivers highly versatile gem&#8208;dimetalated alkene building blocks for synthesis.







Abstract
Alkynyl&#8208;B(aam) (aam=anthranilamidato) derivatives are readily available bench&#8208;stable compounds that undergo remarkably selective reactions with Bu3SnH in the presence of [Cp*RuCl]4 as the catalyst. The addition follows a stereochemically unorthodox trans&#8208;selective course; in terms of regioselectivity, the Bu3Sn&#8208; unit is delivered with high fidelity to the C&#8208;atom of the triple bond adjacent to the boracyclic head group (&#8220;alpha,trans&#8208;addition&#8221;). This outcome is deemed to reflect a hydrogen bonding interaction between the protic &#8722;NH groups of the benzo&#8208;1,3,2&#8208;diazaborininone ring system and the polarized [Ru&#8722;Cl] bond in the loaded catalyst, which locks the substrate in place in a favorable orientation relative to the incoming reagent. The resulting isomerically (almost) pure gem&#8208;dimetalated building blocks are amenable to numerous downstream functionalizations; most remarkable is the ability to subject the &#8722;B(aam) moiety to Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross coupling without need for prior hydrolysis while keeping the adjacent Bu3Sn&#8208; group intact. Alternatively, the tin residue can be engaged in selective tin/halogen exchange without touching the boron substituent; the fact that the two &#8208;NH entities of &#8722;B(aam) do not protonate organozinc reagents and hence do not interfere with Negishi reactions of the alkenyl halides thus formed is another virtue of this so far underutilized boracycle. Overall, the ruthenium catalyzed trans&#8208;hydrostannation of alkynyl&#8208;B(aam) derivatives opens a practical gateway to isomerically pure trisubstituted alkenes of many different substitution patterns by sequential functionalization of the 1&#8208;alkenyl&#8208;1,1&#8208;heterobimetallic adducts primarily formed.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Peripheral&lt;/b&gt;: A hydrogen-bonding array in the periphery of the loaded ruthenium catalyst is the likely cause for the excellent regioselectivity observed in the hydrostannation of bench-stable alkynyl-B(aam) derivatives (aam=anthranilamido). The reaction follows a stereochemically unorthodox &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-addition mode and delivers highly versatile &lt;i&gt;gem&lt;/i&gt;-dimetalated alkene building blocks for synthesis.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alkynyl-B(aam) (aam=anthranilamidato) derivatives are readily available bench-stable compounds that undergo remarkably selective reactions with Bu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;SnH in the presence of [Cp*RuCl]&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; as the catalyst. The addition follows a stereochemically unorthodox &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-selective course; in terms of regioselectivity, the Bu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Sn- unit is delivered with high fidelity to the C-atom of the triple bond adjacent to the boracyclic head group (&#8220;&lt;i&gt;alpha,trans&lt;/i&gt;-addition&#8221;). This outcome is deemed to reflect a hydrogen bonding interaction between the protic &#8722;NH groups of the benzo-1,3,2-diazaborininone ring system and the polarized [Ru&#8722;Cl] bond in the loaded catalyst, which locks the substrate in place in a favorable orientation relative to the incoming reagent. The resulting isomerically (almost) pure &lt;i&gt;gem&lt;/i&gt;-dimetalated building blocks are amenable to numerous downstream functionalizations; most remarkable is the ability to subject the &#8722;B(aam) moiety to Suzuki-Miyaura cross coupling without need for prior hydrolysis while keeping the adjacent Bu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Sn- group intact. Alternatively, the tin residue can be engaged in selective tin/halogen exchange without touching the boron substituent; the fact that the two -NH entities of &#8722;B(aam) do not protonate organozinc reagents and hence do not interfere with Negishi reactions of the alkenyl halides thus formed is another virtue of this so far underutilized boracycle. Overall, the ruthenium catalyzed &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-hydrostannation of alkynyl-B(aam) derivatives opens a practical gateway to isomerically pure trisubstituted alkenes of many different substitution patterns by sequential functionalization of the 1-alkenyl-1,1-heterobimetallic adducts primarily formed.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Gold(I)&#8208;Catalyzed Intermolecular Formal [4+2] Cycloaddition of O&#8208;Aryl Ynol Ethers and Enol Ethers: Synthesis of Chromene Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two electron&#8208;rich unsaturated substrates such as O&#8208;aryl ynol ethers and enol ethers react in the presence of gold(I) catalyst through an intermolecular formal [4+2] cycloaddition to give chromene derivatives. The reaction takes place under mild conditions, and the process is regio&#8208; and stereoselective. The transformation shows high versatility for both substrates, including terminal or internal O&#8208;aryl ynol ethers, as well as cyclic, acyclic or silyl enol ethers.







Abstract
Gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed formal [4+2] cycloaddition of O&#8208;aryl ynol ethers 1 and enol ethers 2 is described. This intermolecular reaction between two electron&#8208;rich unsaturated systems takes place, under mild conditions, in the presence of 5&#8197;mol% [IPrAu(CH3CN)]SbF6 as catalyst giving chromene derivatives with good yields. The cycloaddition is completely regio&#8208; and stereoselective, as well as versatile for both reactives. Silyl enol ethers can also react in the same way and under the same reaction conditions with quantitative yields. A plausible mechanism through a selective addition of the enol ether to the alkyne gold activated complex followed by an intramolecular aromatic electrophilic substitution is proposed. Several experimental results support the presence of a cationic oxonium intermediate prior to the aromatic substitution. The reaction represents a new entry to the chromene core.

         <title>NHC Effects on Reduction Dynamics in Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Organic Transformations**

Upon reaction of Fe(OAc)2, NHC, and EtMgBr, it was found that the NHC utilized determined the rate of &#946;&#8208;hydride elimination. Fe(0)&#8208;ethylene and Fe(II)&#8208;ethyl species were isolated and characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography, 57Fe M&#246;ssbauer, and MCD spectroscopy. The Fe(0)&#8208;ethylene complexes were found to have a rare S=1 ground state. The Fe(II)&#8208;ethyl species were found to form cross&#8208;coupled product under stoichiometric reaction conditions.







Abstract
The high abundance, low toxicity and rich redox chemistry of iron has resulted in a surge of iron&#8208;catalyzed organic transformations over the last two decades. Within this area, N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands have been widely utilized to achieve high yields across reactions including cross&#8208;coupling and C&#8722;H alkylation, amongst others. Central to the development of iron&#8208;NHC catalytic methods is the understanding of iron speciation and the propensity of these species to undergo reduction events, as low&#8208;valent iron species can be advantageous or undesirable from one system to the next. This study highlights the importance of the identity of the NHC on iron speciation upon reaction with EtMgBr, where reactions with SIMes and IMes NHCs were shown to undergo &#946;&#8208;hydride elimination more readily than those with SIPr and IPr NHCs. This insight is vital to developing new iron&#8208;NHC catalyzed transformations as understanding how to control this reduction by simply changing the NHC is central to improving the reactivity in iron&#8208;NHC catalysis.

Whole lotta terminal phosphidos: A combined experimental and computational study of the reactivity of [Ni(NHC)2] (NHC=N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene) towards secondary and primary phosphines has been undertaken. P&#8722;H bond activation, as well as P&#8722;P activation of diphosphines, yields an extensive series of structurally characterised terminal phosphido complexes that exhibit unusual trans&#8208;phosphido hydrido and novel trans&#8208;bis&#8208;phosphido geometries.







Abstract
The addition of PPh2H, PPhMeH, PPhH2, P(para&#8208;Tol)H2, PMesH2 and PH3 to the two&#8208;coordinate Ni0 N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene species [Ni(NHC)2] (NHC=IiPr2, IMe4, IEt2Me2) affords a series of mononuclear, terminal phosphido nickel complexes. Structural characterisation of nine of these compounds shows that they have unusual trans [H&#8722;Ni&#8722;PR2] or novel trans [R2P&#8722;Ni&#8722;PR2] geometries. The bis&#8208;phosphido complexes are more accessible when smaller NHCs (IMe4&gt;IEt2Me2&gt;IiPr2) and phosphines are employed. P&#8722;P activation of the diphosphines R2P&#8722;PR2 (R2=Ph2, PhMe) provides an alternative route to some of the [Ni(NHC)2(PR2)2] complexes. DFT calculations capture these trends with P&#8722;H bond activation proceeding from unconventional phosphine adducts in which the H substituent bridges the Ni&#8722;P bond. P&#8722;P bond activation from [Ni(NHC)2(Ph2P&#8722;PPh2)] adducts proceeds with computed barriers below 10&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1. The ability of the [Ni(NHC)2] moiety to afford isolable terminal phosphido products reflects the stability of the Ni&#8722;NHC bond that prevents ligand dissociation and onward reaction.

Location, location, dimension: A pyridine&#8208;based amphiphile complexed with 1,5&#8208;, 1,6&#8208;, 2,6&#8208;, or 2,7&#8208;dihydroxy naphthalene self&#8208;assembled in water to form supramolecular nanotubes in which the dihydroxy naphthalene components formed J&#8208;type aggregates. The inner diameter (ID) of the nanotubes strongly depended on the regioisomeric dihydroxy naphthalene.







Abstract
A pyridine&#8208;based amphiphile complexed with 1,5&#8208;, 1,6&#8208;, 2,6&#8208;, or 2,7&#8208;dihydroxy naphthalene self&#8208;assembled in water to form nanotubes with inner diameters of 46, 38, 24, 18, and 11&#8197;nm in which the naphthalene molecules formed J&#8208;type aggregates. In contrast, the amphiphile complexed with 1,2&#8208;, 1,3&#8208;, 1,4&#8208;, 1,7&#8208;, 1,8&#8208;, or 2,3&#8208;dihydroxy naphthalene formed nanofibers in which the naphthalene molecules formed H&#8208;type aggregates. The inner diameter of the nanotubes strongly depended on the regioisomeric dihydroxy naphthalene. UV&#8211;vis, fluorescence, infrared spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis, and differential scanning calorimetry showed that nanotubes with smaller inner diameters had weaker intermolecular hydrogen bonds between the tilted amphiphiles complexed with the naphthalene molecules within the membrane walls and showed larger Stokes shifts in the excimer fluorescence of the naphthalene moiety. These findings should be useful not only for fine&#8208;tuning the inner diameters of supramolecular nanotubes but also for controlling the aggregation states of functional aromatic molecules to generate nanostructures with useful optical and electronic properties in water.

Abstract
Phase&#8208;pure spinel&#8208;type magnetic nickel ferrite (NiFe2O4) nanocrystals in the size range of 4 to 11&#8197;nm were successfully synthesized by a fast and energy&#8208;saving microwave&#8208;assisted approach. Size and accessible surface areas can be tuned precisely by the reaction parameters. Our results highlight the correlation between size, degree of inversion, and magnetic characteristics of NiFe2O4 nanoparticles, which enables fine&#8208;tuning of these parameters for a particular application without changing the elemental composition. Moreover, the application potential of the synthesized powders for the electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction in alkaline media was demonstrated, showing that a low degree of inversion is beneficial for the overall performance. The most active sample reaches an overpotential of 380&#8197;mV for water oxidation at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 38.8&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 1.7&#8197;V vs. RHE, combined with a low Tafel slope of 63&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1.

         <title>Construction of a Single&#8208;Atom Nanozyme for Enhanced Chemodynamic Therapy and Chemotherapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Only where it's wanted: Iron&#8208;based single&#8208;atom nanozymes (SAF NPs) that can effectively generate abundant &#8901;OH selectively in the tumor microenvironment for chemodynamic therapy, were modified with cell membrane and employed as an effective drug&#8208;carrying nanoplatform for the first time. SAF NPs exhibit superior catalytic property and high loading capacity (155&#8201;%) for DOX; this makes it possible to combine the enzymatic therapies of SACs and tumor chemotherapy.







Abstract
To fulfill the demand of precision and personalized medicine, single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) have emerged as a frontier in biomedical fields due to enzyme&#8208;mimic catalysis. Herein, we present a biocompatible and versatile nanoagent consisting of single&#8208;atom iron&#8208;containing nanoparticles (SAF NPs), DOX and A549&#8197;cell membrane (CM). The designed porous iron&#8208;based SACs originally served as a drug&#8208;carrying nanoplatform to release DOX selectively in a tumor microenvironment (TME) for chemotherapy (CT) due to their high loading capacity (155&#8201;%) for DOX; this signifies that SACs are promising candidates for universal cargo delivery. Besides, the designed single&#8208;atom nanoagent can perform like peroxidase, which effectively triggers an in&#8197;situ tumor&#8208;specific Fenton reaction to generate abundant toxic hydroxyl radicals (&#8901;OH) selectively in the acidic TME for chemodynamic therapy (CDT). With the combination of CDT and CT, the constructed SAF NPs@DOX@CM nanoagent demonstrates better in&#8197;vivo therapeutic performance than single&#8208;pathway therapy. In the meantime, after modification with CM, SAF NPs@DOX@CM can achieve homologous binding to target tumor tissues and avoid early clearance. This study presents a type of multifunctional SACs for enhanced cancer treatment via the capacity of a drug carrier combined with the enzymatic therapies of single&#8208;atom catalytic sites.

         <title>A 70&#8208;Year&#8208;Old Mystery in Technetium Chemistry Explained by the New Technetium Polyoxometalate&#160;[H7O3]4[Tc20O68]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;4H2O</title>

The red product obtained upon concentration of an HTcO4 solution contains the [Tc20O68]4&#8722; polyanion, which is the first technetium polyanionic species reported. The [Tc20O68]4&#8722; species exhibits a molecular structure never observed before and consists of a square&#8208;planar Tc4O4 ring decorated by sixteen Tc(VII)O4 units. The red color is due to d&#8594;d electronic transitions between the Tc(V) atoms of the central ring.







Abstract
[H7O3]4[Tc20O68]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;4H2O [1] was prepared from an aqueous Tc2O7 solution concentrated over anhydrous H2SO4. [Tc20O68]4&#8722; is the first polyanionic species to be reported for Tc. The unit cell contains one centrosymmetric [Tc20O68]4&#8722; polyanion as well as hydronium ions and water molecules. The core of the structure consists of four Tc(V)O6 octahedra that form a square Tc4O4 ring. The four Tc(V)O6 octahedra are decorated by sixteen Tc(VII)O4 tetrahedra. Calculations show the bonding within the Tc4O4 ring to consist of a 3&#8208;center bond formed between each neighboring pair of Tc atoms and their bridging oxygen. Calculations also indicate that a strong d&#8594;d electronic transition at 513&#8197;nm is the origin of the red color of [1]. The characterization of red HTcO4 solutions by X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy has complemented the description of this compound in aqueous solution. The formation mechanisms in solution, including the possible role of technetium's radioactivity in the formation of [1], are discussed.

         <title>Hexaphenylditetrels &#8211; When Longer Bonds Provide Higher Stability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present a computational analysis of hexaphenylethane derivatives with heavier tetrels comprising the central bond. In stark contrast to parent hexaphenylethane, the heavier tetrel derivatives can readily be prepared. In order to determine the origin of their apparent thermodynamic stability against dissociation as compared to the carbon case, we employed local energy decomposition analysis (LED) and symmetry&#8208;adapted perturbation theory (SAPT) at the DLPNO&#8208;CCSD(T)/def2&#8208;TZVP and sSAPT0/def2&#8208;TZVP levels of theory. We identified London dispersion (LD) interactions as the decisive factor for the molecular stability of heavier tetrel derivatives. This stability is made possible owing to the longer (than C&#8211;C) central bonds that move the phenyl groups out of the heavily repulsive regime so they can optimally benefit from LD interactions.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We present a computational analysis of hexaphenylethane derivatives with heavier tetrels comprising the central bond. In stark contrast to parent hexaphenylethane, the heavier tetrel derivatives can readily be prepared.

         <title>Hybrid Self&#8208;Assembled Gel Beads for Tunable pH&#8208;Controlled Rosuvastatin Delivery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This article describes the fabrication of new pH&#8208;responsive hybrid gel beads combining the polymer gelator calcium alginate with two different low molecular weight gelators (LMWGs) based on 1,3:2,4&#8208;dibenzylidene&#8208;  d  &#8208;sorbitol: pH&#8208;responsive DBS&#8208;COOH and thermally&#8208;responsive DBS&#8208;CONHNH  2  , clearly demonstrating that different classes of LMWG can be fabricated into gel beads using this approach. We also demonstrate that self&#8208;assembled multi&#8208;component gel beads can be formed using different combinations of these gelators. The different gel bead formulations exhibit different responsiveness &#8211; the DBS&#8208;COOH network can disassemble within those beads in which it is present on raising the pH. To exemplify preliminary data for a potential application for these hybrid gel beads, we explored aspects of the delivery of the lipid&#8208;lowering active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) rosuvastatin. The release profile of this statin from the hybrid gel beads is pH&#8208;dependent, with greater release at pH 7.4 than at pH 4.0 &#8211; primary control of this process results from the pKa of the API. The extent of pH&#8208;mediated API release, is also significantly further modified according to gel bead composition. The DBS&#8208;COOH/alginate beads show rapid, highly effective drug release at pH 7.4, while the three&#8208;component DBS&#8208;COOH/DBS&#8208;CONHNH  2  /alginate system shows controlled slow release of the API under the same conditions. These initial results indicate that such gel beads constitute a promising, versatile and easily tuned platform suitable for further development for controlled drug delivery applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Sequential Hydrogen Tunneling in o&#8208;Tolylmethylene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>o  &#8208;Tolylmethylene  1  is a metastable triplet carbene that rearranges to  o  &#8208;xylylene  2  even at temperatures as low as 2.7 K via [1,4] H atom tunneling. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and electron nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) spectroscopical techniques were used to identify two conformers of  1  (  anti  and  syn  ) in noble gas matrices and in frozen organic solutions. Conformer&#8208;specific kinetic measurements revealed that the rate constants for the rearrangements of the  anti  and  syn  conformers of  1  are very similar. However, the orbital alignment in the  syn  conformer is less favorable for the hydrogen transfer reaction than the orbital configuration in the  anti  conformer. Our spectroscopic and quantum chemical investigations indicate that  anti  1  and  syn  1  rapidly interconvert via efficient quantum tunneling forming a rotational pre&#8208;equilibrium. The subsequent second tunneling reaction, the [1,4] H migration from  anti  1  to  2  , is rate&#8208;limiting for the formation of  2  . We here present an efficient strategy for the study of such tunneling equilibria.</dc:description>

         <title>Spectroscopic and Computational Study of Boronium Ionic Liquids and Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Detailed spectroscopic characterisation of Li metal battery ionic liquid (IL) electrolytes based on the boronium cations (trimethylamine)(dimethylethylamine)dihydroborate [NNBH2]+ and (tetramethylethylenediamine)dihydroborate [(TMEDA)BH2]+, and anions bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide [TFSI]&#8722; and bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide [FSI]&#8722; was achieved by using a combination of ATR&#8208;FTIR spectroscopy and DFT calculations. This work elucidated the Li cation coordination environment for the 0.5&#8197;mol&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;kg&#8722;1 LiTFSI or LiFSI&#8208;doped ILs and provided valuable information for future spectroscopic studies of the IL|Li metal interface.







Abstract
Boronium cation&#8208;based ionic liquids (ILs) have demonstrated high thermal stability and a &gt;5.8&#8197;V electrochemical stability window. Additionally, IL&#8208;based electrolytes containing the salt LiTFSI have shown stable cycling against the Li metal anode, the &#8220;Holy grail&#8221; of rechargeable lithium batteries. However, the basic spectroscopic characterisation needed for further development and effective application is missing for these promising ILs and electrolytes. In this work, attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared (ATR&#8208;FTIR) spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations are used in combination to characterise four ILs and electrolytes based on the [NNBH2]+ and [(TMEDA)BH2]+ boronium cations and the [FSI]&#8722; and [TFSI]&#8722; anions. By using this combined experimental and computational approach, proper understanding of the role of different ion&#8208;ion interactions for the Li cation coordination environment in the electrolytes was achieved. Furthermore, the calculated vibrational frequencies assisted in the proper mode assignments for the ILs and in providing insights into the spectroscopic features expected at the interface created when they are adsorbed on a Li(001) surface. A reproducible synthesis procedure for [(TMEDA)BH2]+ is also reported. The fundamental findings presented in this work are beneficial for any future studies that utilise IL based electrolytes in next generation Li metal batteries.

         <title>Perylene&#8208;Cy3 FRET System to Analyze Photoactive DNA Structures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) pair of perylene and Cy3 was developed. Distinct orientation and distance dependence of FRET efficiency were observed. This pair could be used to analyze the structure of photocrosslinked DNA owing to its longer excitation wavelength. This pair will be useful to analyze various photo&#8208;active DNA structures.







Abstract
We report a new F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) system for structural analyses of DNA duplexes using perylene and Cy3 as donor and acceptor, respectively, linked at the termini of a DNA duplex via D&#8208;threoninol. Experimentally obtained FRET efficiencies were in good agreement with theoretical values calculated based on canonical B&#8208;form DNA. Due to the relatively long F&#246;rster radius, this system can be used to analyze large DNA structures, and duplexes containing photo&#8208;reactive molecules can be analyzed since perylene can be excited with visible light. The system was used to analyze a DNA duplex containing stilbene, demonstrating that in the region of the stilbene cluster the duplex adopts a ladder&#8208;like structure rather than helical one. Upon photodimerization between stilbene residues, FRET efficiencies indicated the reaction does not disturb DNA duplex. This FRET system will be useful for analysis of photoreactions of nucleobases as well as a wide range of nucleic acid structures.

         <title>Protection of Ag Clusters by Metal&#8208;Oxo Modules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Monodisperse and atomically precise Ag nanoclusters have attracted considerable recent research interest. A conventional silver cluster usually consists of a silver metallic kernel and an organic peripheral ligand shell. Nevertheless, the present inevitable problem is the unsatisfied stability of such nanoclusters. In this concept, we will give an introduction to Ag clusters protected by metal&#8208;oxo modules which exhibit enhanced stability and unique properties. Accordingly, three different types of clusters are summarized: (1) Ag clusters protected by mononuclear oxometallates; (2) Ag clusters protected by block&#8208;like metal&#8208;oxo clusters; (3) Ag clusters protected by hollow&#8208;like metal&#8208;oxo clusters. The aim of this concept is to offer possible general guidance and insight into future rational design of more metal&#8208;oxo clusters protected silver clusters or even other coinage metal nanoclusters.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural modulation on NiCo2S4 nanoarray by N doping to enhance 2e&#8208;ORR selectivity for photothermal AOPs and Zn&#8208;O2 battery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As a H  2  O  2  generator, 2e  &#8208;  oxygen reduction reaction active electrocatalyst plays an important role in advanced oxidation process to degrade organic pollutants in sewage. To enhance the tendency of NiCo  2  S  4  towards 2e  &#8208;  reduction reaction, N atoms are doped in its structure and replace S  2&#8208;  . The result implies this weakens the interaction between NiCo  2  S  4  and OOH*, suppresses O&#8208;O bond breaking and enhances H  2  O  2  selectivity. This electrocatalyst also shows photothermal effect. Under photothermal heating, H  2  O  2  produced by oxidation reduction reaction can decompose and release &#183;OH, which degrades organic pollutants with advanced oxidation process. Photothermal effect induced advance oxidation process shows obvious advantages over traditional Fenton reaction, such as wide pH adaptation scope and low secondary pollutant due to its Fe  2+  free character. With Zn as anode, the electrocatalyst as cathode material, Zn&#8208;O  2  battery is assembled. It achieves electricity generation and photothermal effect induced advance oxidation process simultaneously.</dc:description>

         <title>Autotandem Catalysis: Inexpensive and Green Access to Functionalized Ketones by Intermolecular Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Amidoalkynylation/Hydration Cascade Reaction via N&#8208;Acyliminium Ion Chemistry</title>

         <dc:description>Iron&#8208;based catalysts were applied in cascade&#8208;type reactions for the synthesis of different carbonyl compounds. The reactions proceeded by a new iron&#8208;catalyzed cascade of alkynylation/hydration by using both the &#963;&#8208; and &#960;&#8208;Lewis acid properties of iron salts. The alkynylation reactions of several endo and exocyclic acetoxylactams were achieved with three different catalysts including FeCl  3  .6H  2  O, FeCl  3  , and Fe(OTf)  3  showing the efficiency of &#963;&#8208;Lewis acidity of iron (III) salts in catalyzing the alkynylation reaction. We also demonstrated that the reaction sequence could be shortened by the direct use of hydroxylactams, leading to an environmentally friendly protocol, avoiding the need to perform unnecessary lengthy steps. A combination of the hard/soft iron Lewis acid properties was then used to implement an unprecedented tandem intermolecular alkynylation/intramolecular hydration sequence allowing expedient access to a new carbonyl structures from trivial materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Iron Binding in the Ferroxidase Site of Human Mitochondrial Ferritin</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ferritins are nanocage proteins that store iron ions in their central cavity as hydrated ferric oxide biominerals. In mammals, further the L (light) and H (heavy) chains constituting cytoplasmic maxi&#8208;ferritins, an additional type of ferritin has been identified, the mitochondrial ferritin (MTF). Human MTF (hMTF) is a functional homopolymeric H&#8208;like ferritin performing the ferroxidase activity in its ferroxidase site (FS), in which Fe(II) is oxidized to Fe(III) in the presence of dioxygen. To better investigate its ferroxidase properties, here we performed time&#8208;lapse X&#8208;ray crystallography analysis of hMTF, providing structural evidence of how iron ions interact with hMTF and of their binding to the FS. Transient iron binding sites, populating the pathway along the cage from the iron entry channel to the catalytic center, were also identified. Furthermore, our kinetic data at variable iron loads indicate that the catalytic iron oxidation reaction occurs via a diferric peroxo intermediate followed by the formation of ferric&#8208;oxo species, with significant differences with respect to human H&#8208;type ferritin.</dc:description>

         <title>An Optimized Protocol for the Synthesis of Peptides Containing trans&#8208;Cyclooctene and Bicyclononyne Dienophiles as Useful Multifunctional Bioorthogonal Probes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple methodology for the introduction of two strained dienophiles, bicyclononyne (BCN) and trans&#8208;cyclooctene (TCO), into synthetic peptides is presented. The method is based on the post&#8208;synthetic attachment of the clickable groups to lysine residues after selective deprotection steps. The resulting peptides can be used for construction of useful peptide conjugates in highly efficient and biocompatible manner via two orthogonal click reactions, the strain&#8208;promoted azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (SPAAC) and the inverse electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8208;Alder reaction (iEDDA).







Abstract
Despite the great advances in solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis (SPPS), the incorporation of certain functional groups into peptide sequences is restricted by the compatibility of the building blocks with conditions used during SPPS. In particular, the introduction of highly reactive groups used in modern bioorthogonal reactions into peptides remains elusive. Here, we present an optimized synthetic protocol enabling installation of two strained dienophiles, trans&#8208;cyclooctene (TCO) and bicyclononyne (BCN), into different peptide sequences. The two groups enable fast and modular post&#8208;synthetic functionalization of peptides, as we demonstrate in preparation of peptide&#8208;peptide and peptide&#8208;drug conjugates. Due to the excellent biocompatibility, the click&#8208;functionalization of the peptides can be performed directly in live cells. We further show that the introduction of both clickable groups into peptides enables construction of smart, multifunctional probes that can streamline complex chemical biology experiments such as visualization and pull&#8208;down of metabolically labeled glycoconjugates. The presented strategy will find utility in construction of peptides for diverse applications, where high reactivity, efficiency and biocompatibility of the modification step is critical.

         <title>Structure Elucidation of Complex Endotaxially Intergrown Lanthanum Barium Oxonitridosilicate Oxides by Combination of Microfocused Synchrotron Radiation and Transmission Electron Microscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;crystalline domains of microcrystalline intergrown oxonitridosilicate oxides Ba22.5+xLa55&#8722;x[Si129N240&#8722;xOx]O3 and Ba25.5+xLa77&#8722;x[Si170N312&#8722;xO9+x]O4 and related Sr analogues were identified by TEM. Diffraction data collected with microfocused synchrotron radiation reveal extraordinarily complex tetrahedra networks. This combination of analytical methods enables the characterization of new luminescent materials in heterogeneous powder samples.







Abstract
Single&#8208;crystalline domains in intergrown microcrystalline material of the new compounds Ba22.5+xLa55&#8722;x[Si129N240&#8722;xOx]O3:Ce3+ and Ba25.5+xLa77&#8722;x[Si170N312&#8722;xO9+x]O4:Ce3+ were identified by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Precise diffraction data from these domains were collected with microfocused synchrotron radiation so that crystal structure elucidation of the complex disordered networks became possible. They are composed of two different interconnected slabs of which one is similar in both compounds, which explains their notorious intergrowth. The distribution of Ba and La is indicated by the analysis of bond&#8208;valence sums and by comparison with isostructural Sr28.5+xLa75&#8722;x[Si170N312&#8722;xO9+x]O4. Ce3+ doping leads to yellow luminescence. This is a showcase that highlights the discovery and accurate characterization of new compounds relevant for luminescence applications from heterogeneous microcrystalline samples by exploiting the capability of the combination of TEM and diffraction using the latest focusing techniques for synchrotron radiation.

Diffraction data collected with microfocused synchrotron radiation reveal extraordinarily complex tetrahedra networks. This combination of analytical methods enables the characterization of new luminescent materials in heterogeneous powder samples.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Single-crystalline domains in intergrown microcrystalline material of the new compounds Ba&lt;sub&gt;22.5+&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;La&lt;sub&gt;55&#8722;&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;[Si&lt;sub&gt;129&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;240&#8722;&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;]O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;:Ce&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; and Ba&lt;sub&gt;25.5+&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;La&lt;sub&gt;77&#8722;&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;[Si&lt;sub&gt;170&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;312&#8722;&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;9+&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;]O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;:Ce&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; were identified by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Precise diffraction data from these domains were collected with microfocused synchrotron radiation so that crystal structure elucidation of the complex disordered networks became possible. They are composed of two different interconnected slabs of which one is similar in both compounds, which explains their notorious intergrowth. The distribution of Ba and La is indicated by the analysis of bond-valence sums and by comparison with isostructural Sr&lt;sub&gt;28.5+&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;La&lt;sub&gt;75&#8722;&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;[Si&lt;sub&gt;170&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;312&#8722;&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;9+&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;]O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. Ce&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; doping leads to yellow luminescence. This is a showcase that highlights the discovery and accurate characterization of new compounds relevant for luminescence applications from heterogeneous microcrystalline samples by exploiting the capability of the combination of TEM and diffraction using the latest focusing techniques for synchrotron radiation.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Ultradoping Boron on Si(100) via Solvothermal Chemistry**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultradoping, i.&#8201;e. using direct dopant&#8208;Si chemical bonds to dope past the Si solid solubility limit, changes the behavior of Si and makes it promising for use in next&#8208;generation devices. While solvothermal methods enable scalability and commercialization, there is little precedence for solvothermal formation of on&#8208;surface B&#8722;Si bonds. This work provides the first demonstration of solvothermally achieving ultradoping levels of B (&#8764;1e14&#8197;cm2).







Abstract
Ultradoping introduces unprecedented dopant levels into Si, which transforms its electronic behavior and enables its use as a next&#8208;generation electronic material. Commercialization of ultradoping is currently limited by gas&#8208;phase ultra&#8208;high vacuum requirements. Solvothermal chemistry is amenable to scale&#8208;up. However, an integral part of ultradoping is a direct chemical bond between dopants and Si, and solvothermal dopant&#8208;Si surface reactions are not well&#8208;developed. This work provides the first quantified demonstration of achieving ultradoping concentrations of boron (&#8764;1e14&#8197;cm2) by using a solvothermal process. Surface characterizations indicate the catalyst cross&#8208;reacted, which led to multiple surface products and caused ambiguity in experimental confirmation of direct surface attachment. Density functional theory computations elucidate that the reaction results in direct B&#8722;Si surface bonds. This proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle work lays groundwork for emerging solvothermal ultradoping processes.

         <title>Synergistic Engineering of Defects and Heterostructures Enhance Lithium/Sodium Storage Properties of F&#8208;SnO2&#8208;x&#8208;SnS2&#8208;x Nanocrystals Supported on N,S&#8208;Graphene</title>

         <dc:description>
F&#8208;SnO2&#8208;x&#8208;SnS2&#8208;x@N/S&#8208;RGO nanocomposite, which is featured by the heterostructures that originated from coupling SnO2 and SnS2, defects caused by F doping and VO/VS, is investigated as an anode for LIBs/SIBs. It renders extraordinary performances in both Li and Na ion batteries (LIBs, SIBs), due to the unique hierarchical structure and electronic characteristics. The rational designation is instructive to the exploitation of other similar anodes for superior Li/Na/K storage performance.







Abstract
Phase engineering of the electrode materials in terms of designing heterostructures, introducing heteroatom and defects, improves great prospects in accelerating the charge storage kinetics during the repeated Li+/Na+ insertion/deintercalation. Herein, a new design of Li/Na&#8208;ion battery anodes through phase regulating is reported consisting of F&#8208;doped SnO2&#8208;SnS2 heterostructure nanocrystals with oxygen/sulfur vacancies (VO/VS) anchored on a 2D sulfur/nitrogen&#8208;doped reduced graphene oxide matrix (F&#8208;SnO2&#8208;x&#8208;SnS2&#8208;x@N/S&#8208;RGO). Consequently, the F&#8208;SnO2&#8208;x&#8208;SnS2&#8208;x@N/S&#8208;RGO anode demonstrates superb high reversible capacity and long&#8208;term cycling stability. Moreover, it exhibits excellent great rate capability with 589&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 for Li+ and 296&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1 for Na+. The enhanced Li/Na storage properties of the nanocomposites are not only attributed to the increase in conductivity caused by VO/VS and F doping (confirmed by DFT calculations) to accelerate their charge&#8208;transfer kinetics but also the increased interaction between F&#8208;SnO2&#8208;x&#8208;SnS2&#8208;x and Li/Na through heterostructure. Meanwhile, the hierarchical F&#8208;SnO2&#8208;x&#8208;SnS2&#8208;x@N/S&#8208;RGO network structure enables fast infiltration of electrolyte and improves electron/ion transportation in the electrode, and the corrosion resistance of F doping contributes to prolonged cycle stability.

         <title>Electroresponsive Performances of Ecoresorbable Smart Fluids Consisting of Various Plant&#8208;Derived Carrier Liquids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This paper proposes the fabrication of a new type of electrorheological (ER) fluid with ecoresorbable features as well as excellent electroresponsive performance. The proposed ER fluid consists of biocompatible Mg&#8208;doped silica/titania hollow nanoparticles (ST HNPs) suspended in vegetable oils (canola, grapeseed, olive, and soy). The effects of biodegradable plant&#8208;derived carrier liquids on the ER performance are analyzed. The polarizability and wettability of the fabricated ER fluids are studied. The high polarizability of the nanoparticles contributes to the high electroresponsive performance by inducing electrostatic interactions between the nanoparticles under electric fields, which enables the formation of a rigid and strong fibril structure. A suitable wettability, which represents the favorable interaction between the oil and the nanoparticles, allows the nanoparticles to disperse evenly in the oil and prevents their aggregation, therefore making it easier to form a rigid and strong fibrillar structure under the electric field.</dc:description>

         <title>Ionic Liquids [M3+][A&#8722;]3 with Three&#8208;Valent Cations and Their Possible Use to Easily Separate Rare Earth Metals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alkyl polyethylene oxide carboxylates allow for simple and safe synthesis of polyvalent ionic liquids with &#8216;naked&#8217; rare earth metals without the need of additional complexation. The direct interactions between the ions produce strong ion&#8208;specific properties despite the similarities between lanthanides. Proof of concept experiments highlight the feasibility of rare earth metal separation in liquid/liquid separation.







Abstract
We introduce a simple way to liquify rare earth metals (REM) by incorporating the corresponding cations, in particular Eu3+, La3+, and Y3+, into polyvalent ionic liquids (ILs). In contrast to conventional methods, this is achieved not by transforming them into anionic complexes, but by keeping them as bare cations and combining them with convenient, cheap and commercially available anions (A) in the form [REM3+][A&#8722;]3. To do so, we follow the COncept of Melting Point Lowering due to EThoxylation (COMPLET) with alkyl polyethylene oxide carboxylates as anions. We provide basic properties, such as glass transition temperatures, viscosities, electrical conductivities, as well as water&#8208;octanol partition constants P and show that these ILs have remarkably different properties, despite the similarity of their cations. In addition, we show that the ionic liquids possess interesting luminescent properties as non&#8208;conventional fluorophores.

         <title>Are Heavy Pnictogen &#8208; &#960; Interactions Really &#8220;&#960; Interactions&#8221; ?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Non&#8208;covalent interactions of heavy pnictogens with &#960;&#8208;arenes play a fundamental role in fields like crystal engineering or catalysis. The strength of such bonds is based on an interplay between dispersion and donor/acceptor interactions, and is generally attributed to the presence of &#960;&#8208;arenes. Computational studies of the interaction between the heavy pnictogens As, Sb and Bi and cyclohexane, in comparison with previous studies on the interaction between heavy pnictogens and benzene, show that this concept probably has to be revised. A thorough analysis of all the different energetic components that play a role in these systems, carried out with state of the art computational methods, sheds light on how they influence one another and the effect that their interplay has on the overall system. Furthermore, the analysis of such interactions leads us to the unexpected finding that the presence of the pnictogen compounds strongly affects the conformational equilibrium of cyclohexane, reversing the relative stability of the chair and boat&#8208;twist conformers, suggesting a possible application of tuneable dispersion energy donors to stabilize the desired conformation.</dc:description>

While the reactions in THF with AgCl or CuCl afforded anionic mono&#8208; and dicarbene complexes with solvated lithium counterions [Li(THF)  n  ]  +  (n = 3, 4), the reactions in toluene proceeded with elimination of LiCl and formation of the neutral phosphine and arene complexes [(WCA&#8208;NHC)M(PPh  3  )] and [(WCA&#8208;NHC)M(  &#951;  2  &#8208;toluene)] (M = Ag, Cu). The latter were used for the preparation of chlorido&#8208; and iodido&#8208;bridged heterobimetallic Ag/Ru and Cu/Ru complexes [(WCA&#8208;NHC)M(  &#956;  &#8208;X)  2  Ru(PPh  3  )(  &#951;  6  &#8208;  p  &#8208;cymene)] (M = Ag, Cu, X = Cl; M = Ag, X = I).

         <title>Illuminating Protein Phase Separation: Reviewing Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission, Fluorescent Molecular Rotor and Solvatochromic Fluorophore based Probes.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Protein phase separation process involving protein unfolding, misfolding, condensation and aggregation  etc.  has been associated with numerous human degenerative diseases. The complexity in protein conformational transitions results in multi&#8208;step and multi&#8208;species biochemical pathways upon protein phase separation. Recent progresses in designing novel fluorescent probes have unraveled the enriched details of phase separated proteins and provided mechanistic insights towards disease pathology. In this review, we summarized the design and characterizations of fluorescent probes that selectively illuminate proteins at different phase separated states with a focus on aggregation&#8208;induced emission probes, fluorescent molecular rotors, and solvatochromic fluorophores. Inspired by these pioneering works, a design blueprint was proposed to further develop fluorescent probes that can potentially shed light on the unresolved protein phase separated states in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>Turning the Light on Phenols: New Opportunities in Organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phenols (  I  ) are extremely relevant chemical functionalities in natural, synthetic and industrial chemistry. Their corresponding electron&#8208;rich anions, namely phenolates (  I  ), are characterized by interesting physicochemical properties that can be drastically altered upon light excitation. Specifically, phenolates (  I  ) become strong reducing agents in the excited state and are able to generate reactive radicals from suitable precursors  via  single&#8208;electron transfer processes. Thus, these species can photochemically trigger strategic bond&#8208;forming reactions, including their direct aromatic C&#8208;H functionalization. Moreover, substituted phenolate anions can act as photocatalysts to enable synthetically useful organic transformations. An alternative mechanistic manifold is represented by the ability of phenolate derivatives  I  to form ground state electron donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complexes with electron&#8208;poor radical sources. These complementary scenarios have paved the way for the development of a wide range of relevant organic reactions. In this Minireview, we present the main examples of this research field, and give insight on emerging trends in phenols photocatalysis towards richer organic synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;Propelling Hybrid Gels Incorporating an Active Self&#8208;Assembled Low&#8208;Molecular&#8208;Weight Gelator</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hybrid gel beads based on combining a low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight gelator (LMWG) with a polymer gelator (PG) demonstrate enhanced ability to self&#8208;propel in water, with the LMWG playing an active role. Hybrid gel beads were loaded with ethanol and shown to move in water via &#8216;Marangoni effect&#8217; surface tension changes caused by the expulsion of ethanol &#8211; smaller beads move further and faster than larger beads. Flat shapes of the hybrid gel were cut using a &#8216;stamp&#8217; &#8211; circles moved the furthest while stars showed more rotational movement on their own axis. Comparing hybrid LMWG/PG gel beads with PG&#8208;only beads demonstrated that the LMWG speeds up the beads, enhancing the rate of self&#8208;propulsion. Self&#8208;assembly of the LMWG into a &#8216;solid&#8208;like&#8217; network prevents its leaching from the gel. The LMWG also retains its own unique function &#8211; specifically, remediating methylene blue pollutant dye from basic water as a result of non&#8208;covalent interactions. The mobile hybrid beads accumulate this dye more effectively than PG&#8208;only beads. Self&#8208;propelling gel beads have potential applications in removal/delivery of active agents in environmental or biological settings. The ability of self&#8208;assembling LMWGs to enhance mobility and control removal/delivery, suggests that adding them into self&#8208;propelling systems can add significant value.</dc:description>

         <title>The influence of secondary interactions on the [N&#8208;I&#8208;N]+ halogen bond</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>[Bis(pyridine)iodine(I)]  +  complexes offer controlled access to halonium ions under mild conditions. The reactivity of such stabilized halonium ions is primarily determined by their three&#8208;center, four&#8208;electron [N&#8208;I&#8208;N]  +  halogen bond. We studied the importance of chelation, strain, steric hindrance and electrostatic interaction for the structure and reactivity of halogen bonded halonium ions by acquiring their  15  N NMR coordination shifts and measuring their iodenium release rates, and interpreted the data with the support of DFT computations. A bidentate ligand stabilizes the [N&#8208;I&#8208;N]  +  halogen bond, decreasing the halenium transfer rate. Strain weakens the bond and accordingly increases the release rate. Remote modifications in the backbone do not influence the stability as long as the effect is entirely steric. Incorporating an electron&#8208;rich moiety close by the [N&#8208;I&#8208;N]  +  motif increases the iodenium release rate. The analysis of the iodine(I) transfer mechanism highlights the impact of secondary interactions, and may provide a handle on the induction of stereoselectivity in electrophilic halogenations.</dc:description>

         <title>Reactivity and Passivation of Fe Nanoclusters on h&#8208;BN/Rh(111)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reactivity of iron nanocluster arrays on  h&#8208;  BN/Rh(111) was studied using  in situ  high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The morphology and reactivity of the iron nanoclusters (Fe&#8208; NCs) were investigated by CO adsorption. On&#8208;top and hollow/edge sites were determined to be the available adsorption sites on the as&#8208;prepared Fe&#8208;NCs and CO dissociation was observed at 300 K. C&#8208; and O&#8208;precovered Fe&#8208;NCs showed no catalytic activity towards CO dissociation because the hollow/edge sites were blocked by the C and O atoms. Therefore, these adsorption sites were identified to be the most active sites of the Fe&#8208;NCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Rational Design of Semiconductor Heterojunctions for Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The nature, structure and electronic properties of some example of binary and ternary heterostructure relevant in photocatalysis experiments is reported in this work, focusing on important computational aspects such as the band gap problem, quantum size effects, band edges alignment, surface termination and on the insights that simulation can provide when designing new materials.







Abstract
Electronic structure calculations provide a useful complement to experimental characterization tools in the atomic&#8208;scale design of semiconductor heterojunctions for photocatalysis. The band alignment of the heterojunction is of fundamental importance to achieve an efficient charge carrier separation, so as to reduce electron/hole recombination and improve photoactivity. The accurate prediction of the offsets of valence and conduction bands in the constituent units is thus of key importance but poses several methodological and practical problems. In this Minireview we address some of these problems by considering selected examples of binary and ternary semiconductor heterojunctions and how these are determined at the level of density functional theory (DFT). The atomically precise description of the interface, the consequent charge polarization, the role of quantum confinement, the possibility to use facet engineering to determine a specific band alignment, are among the effects discussed, with particular attention to pros and cons of each one of these aspects. This analysis shows the increasingly important role of accurate electronic structure calculations to drive the design and the preparation of new interfaces with desired properties.

         <title>Local Light&#8208;Controlled Generation of Calcium Carbonate and Barium Carbonate Biomorphs via Photochemical Stimulation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Local irradiation of a liquid precursor leads to the space&#8208; and time&#8208;controlled photogeneration of calcium carbonate crystals and biomorphs. The method is based on the photodecarboxylation of an organic precursor, and it was optimized to avoid precipitation of organic matter and pH changes. By tuning the light intensity, the morphology of the resulting biomorphs can be controlled.







Abstract
Photochemical activation is proposed as a general method for controlling the crystallization of sparingly soluble carbonates in space and time. The photogeneration of carbonate in an alkaline environment is achieved upon photo&#8208;decarboxylation of an organic precursor by using a conventional 365&#8197;nm UV LED. Local irradiation was conducted focusing the LED light on a 300&#8197;&#956;m radius spot on a closed glass crystallization cell. The precursor solution was optimized to avoid the precipitation of the photoreaction organic byproducts and prevent photo&#8208;induced pH changes to achieve the formation of calcium carbonate only in the corresponding irradiated area. The crystallization was monitored in real&#8208;time by time&#8208;lapse imaging. The method is also shown to work in gels. Similarly, it was also shown to photo&#8208;activate locally the formation of barium carbonate biomorphs. In the last case, the morphology of these biomimetic structures was tuned by changing the irradiation intensity.

         <title>Pd&#8208;Catalysed Decarbonylation Free Approach to Carbonylative Esterification of 5&#8208;HMF to Its Aryl Esters Synthesis Using Aryl Halides and Oxalic Acid as C1 Source</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aldehyde unaffected: Selective carbonylative esterification of 5&#8208;HMF was achieved on a polystyrene&#8208;supported palladium (Pd@PS) catalyst with aryl halides as coupling partner. Using oxalic acid as a solid and environmentally benign CO source avoided the need for highly sophisticated equipment to trap CO gas. A series of aryl esters of 5&#8208;HMF were synthesized in good&#8208;to&#8208;moderate yield by overcoming the issue of decarbonylation.







Abstract
A decarbonylation free, polystyrene&#8208;supported, Pd (Pd@PS)&#8208;catalysed carbonylative esterification of the hydroxy group of 5&#8208;hydroxymethyl furfural (5&#8208;HMF) to its corresponding aryl esters has been developed. The use of Pd@PS, oxalic acid as CO source, and aryl halides was first explored for the aryl ester of 5&#8208;HMF synthesis. Here, we investigated the vital role of a polystyrene support to avoid the commonly known decarbonylation of 5&#8208;HMF. The reaction exhibits vast substrate scope with comparably good yield and catalyst recyclability.

         <title>Fluorescent Molecular Logic Gates Driven by Temperature and by Protons in Solution and on Solid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single family of compounds, 1,3,5&#8208;triaryl&#8208;&#916;2&#8208;pyrazolines, produces fluorescent logic gates in aqueous solution and on solid silica microparticles with H+ and temperature as inputs. H+&#8208;driven YES, PASS 1, YES+PASS 1, NOT, as well as temperature&#8208;driven NOT gates are demonstrated. H+&#8208;driven logic gates are based on photoinduced electron transfer (PET), whereas the temperature&#8208;driven cases depend on C(5)&#8722;N(1) predissociation. Temperature&#8208;driven YES logic gates based on polyacrylamide polymers alongside push&#8211;pull benzofurazans are also introduced for tagging solid particles.







Abstract
Temperature&#8208;driven fluorescent NOT logic is demonstrated by exploiting predissociation in a 1,3,5&#8208;trisubstituted &#916;2&#8208;pyrazoline on its own and when grafted onto silica microparticles. Related &#916;2&#8208;pyrazolines become proton&#8208;driven YES and NOT logic gates on the basis of fluorescent photoinduced electron transfer (PET) switches. Additional PASS 1 and YES+PASS 1 logic gates on silica are also demonstrated within the same family. Beside these small&#8208;molecule systems, a polymeric molecular thermometer based on a benzofurazan&#8208;derivatized N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide copolymer is attached to silica to produce temperature&#8208;driven fluorescent YES logic.

         <title>Catalyst Deactivation During Rhodium Complex&#8208;Catalyzed Propargylic C&#8722;H Activation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, the complete mechanistic elucidation of rhodium&#8208;catalyzed propargylic C&#8722;H activation is presented. Particular attention is paid to the deactivation pathway of the catalytic reaction. The associated deactivated species has been studied in detail by NMR and Raman spectroscopy as well as X&#8208;ray crystallography. Furthermore, the present work includes a kinetic study carried out by in&#8197;situ operando NMR spectroscopy.







Abstract
Detailed mechanistic investigations on our previously reported synthesis of branched allylic esters by the rhodium complex&#8208;catalyzed propargylic C&#8722;H activation have been carried out. Based on initial mechanistic studies, we present herein more detailed investigations of the reaction mechanism. For this, various analytical (NMR, X&#8208;ray crystal structure analysis, Raman) and kinetic methods were used to characterize the formation of intermediates under the reaction conditions. The knowledge obtained by this was used to further optimize the previous conditions and generate a more active catalytic system.

For this, various analytical (NMR, X-ray crystal structure analysis, Raman) and kinetic methods were used to characterize the formation of intermediates under the reaction conditions. The knowledge obtained by this was used to further optimize the previous conditions and generate a more active catalytic system.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Walter Reppe Revival &#8211; Identification and Genesis of Copper Acetylides Cu2C2 as Active Species in Ethynylation Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Copper acetylides, Cu2C2, have been proposed as catalytically active species in reactions with acetylene by Walter Reppe decades ago. The present study succeeded for the first time with the doubtless experimental identification of the explosive material as active species in the ethynylation of formaldehyde to 1,4&#8208;butynediol by correlation with the performance of supported Cu/Bi/SiO2 and bulk Cu2C2 catalysts.







Abstract
More than six decades after proposing copper acetylide, Cu2C2, as catalytically active species in ethynylation reactions by Walter Reppe, the explosive species have been experimentally identified and investigated during catalysis in detail now. Taking into account specific safety precautions, unequivocal qualitative characterization was achieved by Raman spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray powder diffraction of supported copper catalysts Cu/Bi/SiO2 during and after activation and catalysis in comparison to bulk Cu2C2 materials. Quantification of Cu2C2 succeeded by thermal analysis and Raman spectroscopy. Its formation in aqueous suspension is studied starting from copper(II) oxide catalysts including dissolution, reduction and precipitation steps. Copper acetylide formation can be correlated with catalytic performance in the ethynylation of formaldehyde to 1,4&#8208;butynediol.

         <title>Communication of Bichromophore Emission upon Aggregation &#8211; Aroyl&#8208;S,N&#8208;ketene Acetals as Multifunctional Sensor Merocyanines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

Multifunctional shining tool: A library of 31&#8197;aroyl&#8208;S,N&#8208;ketene acetal solid&#8208;state emissive bichromophores, synthesized by a consecutive three&#8208;component reaction (3CR), exhibits aggregation induced emission (AIE), acidochromicity, as well as dual emission and energy transfer in aggregates suitable for alcoholic beverage analysis and encapsulation in micrometer sized polystyrene particles with enhanced fluorescence quantum yield.







Abstract
Aroyl&#8208;S,N&#8208;ketene acetal&#8208;based bichromophores can be readily synthesized in a consecutive three&#8208;component synthesis in good to excellent yields by condensation of aroyl chlorides and an N&#8208;(p&#8208;bromobenzyl) 2&#8208;methyl benzothiazolium salt followed by a Suzuki coupling, yielding a library of 31&#8197;bichromophoric fluorophores with substitution pattern&#8208;tunable emission properties. Varying both chromophores enables different communication pathways between the chromophores, exploiting aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) and energy transfer (ET) properties, and thus, furnishing aggregation&#8208;based fluorescence switches. Possible applications range from fluorometric analysis of alcoholic beverages to pH sensors.

         <title>A Small&#8208;molecule Diketopyrrolopyrrole&#8208;based Dye for in vivo NIR&#8208;IIa Fluorescence Bioimaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic small&#8208;molecule fluorophores with near&#8208;infrared IIa (NIR&#8208;IIa) emission have great potential in pre&#8208;clinical detection and inoperative imaging due to the high&#8208;spatial resolution and deep penetration. However, developments of the NIR&#8208;IIa fluorophores are still facing considerable challenges. In this work, a series of diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP)&#8208;based fluorophores were designed and synthesized. Subsequently, nanomaterial  T25@F127  with significant NIR&#8208;IIa emission properties was rationally prepared by encapsulating DPP&#8208;based fluorophore  T25  , and was selected for fluorescence angiography and cerebral vascular microscopic imaging with nearly 800 &#956;m penetrating depth and excellent signal&#8208;background ratio of 4.07 and 2.26 (at 250 and 400 &#956;m) , respectively. Furthermore, the nanomaterial  T25@cRGD  with tumor targeting ability can image tiny metastatic tumor on intestine with a small size of 0.3 mm&#215;1.0 mm and high&#8208;spatial resolution (SBR = 3.84). This study demonstrates that the nanomaterials which encapsulated  T25  behave as excellent NIR&#8208;IIa fluorescence imaging agents and have a great potential for  in vivo  biological application.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reaction of [PtCl  2  (COD)]  (COD = 1,5&#8208;cyclooctadiene)  with  i  Pr  2  P(C  9  H  8  N) led to the formation of the chlorido complexes,  cis  &#8208;[PtCl  2  {  i  Pr  2  P(C  9  H  8  N)}  2  ] (  1  ) and  trans  &#8208;[PtCl  2  {  i  Pr  2  P(C  9  H  8  N)}  2  ] (  2  ).

         <title>Enantioselective Recognition of Racemic Amino Alcohols in Aqueous Solution by Chiral Metal&#8208;Oxide Keplerate {Mo132} Cluster Capsules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral resolution of racemic amino alcohol guests (phenylalaninol and 2&#8208;amino&#8208;1&#8208;phenylethanol) has been achieved by using a chirally coordinated enantiopure polyoxometalate host, {Mo132(lactate)30}. NMR spectroscopic methods, including DOSY measurements, were applied to determine the enantiomeric excesses of guest mixtures in addition to the association constants of the host&#8208;guest system binding process.







Abstract
Determining the relative configuration or enantiomeric excess of a substance may be achieved using NMR spectroscopy by employing chiral shift reagents (CSRs). Such reagents interact noncovalently with the chiral solute, resulting in each chiral form experiencing different magnetic anisotropy; this is then reflected in their NMR spectra. The Keplerate polyoxometalate (POM) is a molybdenum&#8208;based, water&#8208;soluble, discrete inorganic structure with a pore&#8208;accessible inner cavity, decorated by differentiable ligands. Through ligand exchange from the self&#8208;assembled nanostructure, a set of chiral Keplerate host molecules has been synthesised. By exploiting the interactions of analyte molecules at the surface pores, the relative configuration of chiral amino alcohol guests (phenylalaninol and 2&#8208;amino&#8208;1&#8208;phenylethanol) in aqueous solvent was establish and their enantiomeric excess was determined by 1H NMR using shifts of &#916;&#916;&#948;=0.06&#8197;ppm. The use of POMs as chiral shift reagents represents an application of a class that is yet to be well established and opens avenues into aqueous host&#8208;guest chemistry with self&#8208;assembled recognition agents.

         <title>Polymer Nanodiscs and Their Bioanalytical Potential</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Discovering discs: Although understanding membrane protein (MP) structure and activity is invaluable for rational drug design, challenges are associated with purification and analysis of MPs. Synthetic polymer nanodiscs, structures that arise from amphipathic copolymers capturing membrane proteins and surrounding phospholipids, offer a convenient detergent&#8208;free solution. This review explores the scope of possible analytical applications for polymer nanodiscs in the study of MPs and biomolecules.







Abstract
Membrane proteins (MPs) play a pivotal role in cellular function and are therefore predominant pharmaceutical targets. Although detailed understanding of MP structure and mechanistic activity is invaluable for rational drug design, challenges are associated with the purification and study of MPs. This review delves into the historical developments that became the prelude to currently available membrane mimetic technologies before shining a spotlight on polymer nanodiscs. These are soluble nanosized particles capable of encompassing MPs embedded in a phospholipid ring. The expanding range of reported amphipathic polymer nanodisc materials is presented and discussed in terms of their tolerance to different solution conditions and their nanodisc properties. Finally, the analytical scope of polymer nanodiscs is considered in both the demonstration of basic nanodisc parameters as well as in the elucidation of structures, lipid&#8211;protein interactions, and the functional mechanisms of reconstituted membrane proteins. The final emphasis is given to the unique benefits and applications demonstrated for native nanodiscs accessed through a detergent free process.

         <title>Triplet Exciton Upconverting Blue Exciplex Host for Deep Blue Phosphors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stopping diodes from dying: A TADF exciplex host managing positive polarons and stabilizing excitons was developed to improve the efficiency and device lifetime of blue phosphorescent organic light&#8208;emitting diodes. A higher external quantum efficiency of over 20&#8201;% and doubled device lifetime with deep blue color coordinate were realized in the blue phosphorescent OLEDs by using the new exciplex host system.







Abstract
A thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF)&#8208;type exciplex host employing a novel electron&#8208;transport type (n&#8208;type) type host managing positive polarons and stabilizing excitons was developed to elongate the device lifetime of deep blue phosphorescent organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (PhOLEDs). The bipolar n&#8208;type host was designed to prevent hole leakage and secure hole stability while being stabilized under excitons by introducing a CN&#8208;modified carbazole moiety as a weak donor. The TADF&#8208;type exciplex host&#8208;based blue PhOLEDs showed high (above 20&#8201;%) quantum efficiency with a deep blue color coordinate of (0.14, 0.16) and elongated device lifetime. The device operational lifetime of the blue PhOLEDs bearing the TADF&#8208;type exciplex host was extended by more than twice compared to that of the exciplex&#8208;free unipolar host. This work suggested a design concept of the n&#8208;type host to develop the TADF&#8208;type exciplex host for deep blue phosphors to reach a long lifespan in the deep blue PhOLEDs.

Dynamically 1D assembled linear Pd8 chains with bisisocyanide linkers are shown against a backdrop of contrails lit from below by the rising sun. A variety of Pd8 chains with a linear tetraphosphine, meso&#8208;dpmppm, were synthesized through both covalent and noncovalent interactions between two Pd4 fragments. They exhibited fine&#8208;tunable electronic states, a wide range of redox properties, and dynamic 1D self&#8208;assembly in solution. These findings could lead to the next frontier in exploring new functions with dynamically aggregated metal building blocks. More information can be found in the Full Paper by T. Tanase et&#8197;al.

         <title>Ytterbium (II) Hydride as a Powerful Multielectron Reductant</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular ytterbium(II) hydride enables the two&#8208;electron aromatization of 1,3,5,7&#8208;cyclooctatetraene to provide an inverse sandwich diytterbium cyclooctatetraenyl derivative and hydrogen gas. This reactivity was extended to the more challenging two&#8208;electron reduction of polyaromatic hydrocarbons, including naphthalene (E0=&#8722;2.60&#8197;V), with retention of metal oxidation state. This reactivity proceeds via consecutive polarized Yb&#8722;H/C=C insertion and deprotonation pathways that occurs at the dimeric hydride reagent.







Abstract
A dimeric &#946;&#8208;diketiminato ytterbium(II) hydride affects both the two&#8208;electron aromatization of 1,3,5,7&#8208;cyclooctatetraene (COT) and the more challenging two&#8208;electron reduction of polyaromatic hydrocarbons, including naphthalene (E0=&#8722;2.60&#8197;V). Confirmed by Density Functional Theory calculations, these reactions proceed via consecutive polarized Yb&#8722;H/C=C insertion and deprotonation steps to provide the respective ytterbium (II) inverse sandwich complexes and hydrogen gas.

     alt="Ytterbium (II) Hydride as a Powerful Multielectron Reductant"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A molecular ytterbium(II) hydride&lt;/b&gt; enables the two-electron aromatization of 1,3,5,7-cyclooctatetraene to provide an inverse sandwich diytterbium cyclooctatetraenyl derivative and hydrogen gas. This reactivity was extended to the more challenging two-electron reduction of polyaromatic hydrocarbons, including naphthalene (E&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;=&#8722;2.60&#8197;V), with retention of metal oxidation state. This reactivity proceeds via consecutive polarized Yb&#8722;H/C=C insertion and deprotonation pathways that occurs at the dimeric hydride reagent.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A dimeric &#946;-diketiminato ytterbium(II) hydride affects both the two-electron aromatization of 1,3,5,7-cyclooctatetraene (COT) and the more challenging two-electron reduction of polyaromatic hydrocarbons, including naphthalene (E&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;=&#8722;2.60&#8197;V). Confirmed by Density Functional Theory calculations, these reactions proceed via consecutive polarized Yb&#8722;H/C=C insertion and deprotonation steps to provide the respective ytterbium (II) inverse sandwich complexes and hydrogen gas. These observations highlight the ability of a simple ytterbium(II) hydride to act as a powerful two-electron reductant at room temperature without the necessity of an external electron to initiate the reaction and avoiding radicaloid intermediates.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Upgrading Octane Number of Naphtha by a Robust and Easily Attainable Metal&#8211;Organic Framework through Selective Molecular Sieving of Alkane Isomers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Naphtha was separated by using a easily attainable metal&#8211;organic framework, Co3(HCOO)6, through selective molecular exclusion of alkane isomers with different degrees of branching. The separation capability of the compound was evaluated by using naphtha mixtures with 180+ hydrocarbon components. Co3(HCOO)6 exhibited efficient separation of the mixture and thus yielded products with high octane ratings and high dynamic capacity. More information can be found in the Communication by H. Wang, Q. Gong, J. Li, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101871).

         <title>Total Synthesis of Aetokthonotoxin, the Cyanobacterial Neurotoxin Causing Vacuolar Myelinopathy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesizing the &#8220;wanted&#8221; bald eagle killer: Aetokthonotoxin (AETX), a pentabrominated 1,2&#8217;&#8208;biindole alkaloid has been indicted to elicit vacuolar myelinopathy, a neurologic disease causing the death of birds of prey, such as the bald eagle in the USA. In order to assess further biological activity studies, synthesis of this neurotoxin is decidedly needed. Here, we describe its first total synthesis: by fusing advanced indole intermediates in a Somei&#8208;type Michael reaction in only five steps overall. More information can be found in the Communication by M.&#8197;G. Ricardo, B. Westermann, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101848).

         <title>Remodeling of the Fibrillation Pathway of &#945;&#8208;Synuclein by Interaction with Antimicrobial Peptide LL&#8208;III</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation plus the droplet formation of proteins has emerged as a key mechanism for intracellular organization, but there is also evidence linking it to a variety of medical conditions. Pathological aggregation of &#945;&#8208;synuclein, which is causally linked to Parkinson's disease, can proceed via such droplet condensation. We show that the antimicrobial peptide LL&#8208;III is able to interact with both monomers and condensates of &#945;&#8208;synuclein, stabilizing the droplet phase and preventing conversion to the toxic fibrillar state. More information can be found in the Communication by R. Oliva, R. Winter, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101592).

         <title>A full flexible NH4+&#160; ion battery based on the concentrated hydrogel electrolyte for enhanced performance</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nonmetal ammonium&#160; NH  4  +  &#160;ions have recently been explored as effective charge carriers in battery systems due to their abundancy, light weight, small hydration shells in water. The research concerning the use of NH  4  +  &#160;ion&#160;redox chemistry&#160;in flexible batteries, is still in its infancy. For the first time, we report a flexible full&#160; NH  4  +  &#160;ion battery (AIB) composed of a concentrated hydrogel electrolyte sandwiched between NH4V3O8&#183;2.9H2O nanobelts cathode and polyaniline (PANI) anode. The hydrogel electrolyte is simply synthesized by using ammonium sulfate, xanthan gum and water. As a reference,&#160;AIB based on the liquid aqueous electrolyte is prepared first, which exhibits a capacity of 121 mAh g&#8208;1&#160; and capacity retention of 95% after 400 cycles at a specific current of 0.1 A g&#160;&#8208;1. The full flexible AIBs are then fabricated using hydrogel electrolytes with varied salt concentrations, to maximize the electrochemical performance. It is found that the battery based on the hydrogel electrolyte prepared from 3 M ammonium sulfate solution shows the best electrochemical performance&#160;i.e., a capacity of 60 mAh g&#8208;1&#160;while maintaining a capacity retention of 88% after 250 cycles at a specific current of 0.1 A g&#160; &#8208;1. Moreover, the flexible AIB retains excellent electrochemical performance when bent at different angles, demonstrating remarkable mechanical strength and flexibility. Therefore, this study sheds new light on the utilization of concentrated hydrogel electrolyte in the AIB chemistry, for future developments of new electrochemical energy storage technology.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We present a one&#8208;step Ugi reaction protocol for the expedient synthesis of photoaffinity probes for live&#8208;cell MS&#8208;based proteomics. The reaction couples an amine affinity function with commonly used photoreactive groups, and a variety of handle functionalities. Using this technology, a series of pan&#8208;BET selective bromodomain photoaffinity probes were obtained by parallel synthesis. Studies on the effects of photoreactive group, linker length and irradiation wavelength on photocrosslinking efficiency provide valuable insights into photoaffinity probe design. Optimal probes were progressed to MS based proteomics to capture the BET family of proteins from live cells and reveal their potential on&#8208; and off&#8208;target profiles.</dc:description>

         <title>PdNi/Ni Nanotubes Assembled by Mesoporous Nanoparticles for Efficient Alkaline Ethanol Oxidation Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The optimization of structure and composition is essential to improve the performance of catalysts. Herein, mesoporous nanoparticles assembled PdNi/Ni nanotubes (mPdNi/Ni NTs) are successfully fabricated using nickel nanowires as sacrificial template. The combination of nanotubular structure with mesoporous nanoparticle morphology can provide facilitated transfer channels and sufficient active sites, allowing the full contact and reaction between catalysts and reactants. Therefore, the synthesized mPdNi/Ni NTs exhibited superior ethanol oxidation performance to mesoporous Pd nanotubes and commercial Pd black. This study proposes a rational strategy for the development of nanoparticle assembled nanotubes with surface mesoporous morphology, which can greatly improve catalytic performance in various electrocatalytic fields.</dc:description>

Therefore, the synthesized mPdNi/Ni NTs exhibited superior ethanol oxidation performance to mesoporous Pd nanotubes and commercial Pd black. This study proposes a rational strategy for the development of nanoparticle assembled nanotubes with surface mesoporous morphology, which can greatly improve catalytic performance in various electrocatalytic fields.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Comparison with the  mono  &#8208;triarylboranes reveals the large influence of the bridging unit on the properties of the  bis  &#8208;triarylboranes, especially those of the cationic compounds. Based on these preliminary investigations, the interactions of  Cat  1+  ,  Cat  2+  ,  Cat(i)  2+  , and  Cat  3+  with DNA, RNA, and DNApore were investigated in buffered solutions. The same compounds were investigated for their ability to enter and localize within organelles of human lung carcinoma (A549) and normal lung (WI38) cells showing that not only the number of charges but also their distribution over the chromophore influences interactions and staining properties.</dc:description>

The resulting compounds [dpfam  3  LnM][OTf] (Ln = La, Nd and M = Ag, Au) feature a close proximity of the two metal centers and were investigated experimentally by photoluminescence spectroscopy and quantum chemical calculations.

         <title>Tunable Photoswitching in Norbornadiene (NBD)/Quadricyclane (QC) &#8211; Fullerene Hybrids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>With respect to molecular switches, initializing the quadricyclane (QC) to norbornadiene (NBD) back&#8208;reaction by light is highly desirable. Our previous publication provided a unique solution for this purpose by utilizing covalently bound C60  . In this work, we investigate the fundamental processes within these hybrids. Variation of the linker&#8208;unit connecting the NBD/QC moiety with the fullerene core is used as a tool to tune the properties of the resulting hybrids. Utilizing the Prato reaction two unprecedented NBD/QC &#8208; fullerene hybrids having a long&#8208;rigid and a short&#8208;rigid linker were synthesized. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed that this results in an average QC &#8211; C60  distance of up to 14.2 &#197;. By comparing the NBD &#8208; QC switching of these derivatives with the already established one having a flexible linker, valuable mechanistic insights were gained. Most importantly, spatial convergence of the QC moiety and the fullerene core is inevitable for an efficient back&#8208;reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Cata&#8208;Annulated Azaacene Bisimides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
How high can you go? Cata&#8208;annulation of dicarboximides onto azaacenes lowers the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals and increases reduction potentials up to &#8722;0.35&#8197;V vs. Fc/Fc+, but does not stabilize a tetrakis(dicarboximide)tetraazaheptacene which dimerized regioselectively to its butterfly adduct.







Abstract
Ultra&#8208;electron&#8208;deficient azaacenes were synthesized via Buchwald&#8208;Hartwig coupling of ortho&#8208;diaminoarenes with chlorinated mellophanic diimide followed by oxidation of the intermediate N,N&#8217;&#8208;dihydro compounds with MnO2 or PbO2. The resulting cata&#8208;annulated bisimide azaacenes have ultrahigh electron affinities with first reduction potentials as low as &#8722;0.35&#8197;V recorded for a tetraazapentacene. Attempts to prepare a tetrakis(dicarboximide)tetraazaheptacene resulted in the formation of a symmetric butterfly dimer.

         <title>Allenes and Dienes as Chiral Allylmetal Pronucleophiles in Catalytic Enantioselective C=X Addition: Historical Perspective and State&#8208;of&#8208;The&#8208;Art Survey</title>

Beyond preformed allylmetal reagents: In this review, the emerging use of allenes and dienes as chiral allylmetal pronucleophiles in catalytic enantioselective reductive additions to aldehydes, ketones, imines, carbon dioxide and other C=X (X=C, O, N) electrophiles is exhaustively catalogued.







Abstract
The use of allenes and 1,3&#8208;dienes as chiral allylmetal pronucleophiles in intermolecular catalytic enantioselective reductive additions to aldehydes, ketones, imines, carbon dioxide and other C=X electrophiles is exhaustively catalogued together with redox&#8208;neutral hydrogen auto&#8208;transfer processes. Coverage is limited to processes that result in both C&#8722;H and C&#8722;C bond formation. The use of alkynes as latent allylmetal pronucleophiles and multicomponent C=X allylations involving allenes and dienes is not covered. As illustrated in this review, the ability of allenes and 1,3&#8208;dienes to serve as tractable non&#8208;metallic pronucleophiles has evoked many useful transformations that have no counterpart in traditional allylmetal chemistry.

         <title>Group 15 and 16 Nitrene&#8208;Like Pnictinidenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pnictinidenes are an increasingly relevant species in main group chemistry and generally exhibit proclivity for the triplet electronic ground state. However, the elusive singlet electronic states are often desired for chemical applications. We predict the singlet&#8208;triplet energy differences (&#916;EST = ESinglet &#8722; ETriplet) of simple group 15 and 16 substituted pnictinidenes (Pn&#8208;R; Pn = P, As, Sb, or Bi) with highly reliable focal&#8208;point analyses targeting the CCSDTQ/CBS level of theory. The only cases we predict to have favorable singlet states are P&#8208;PH2 (&#8722;3.2 kcal mol&#8208;1) and P&#8208;NH2 (&#8722;0.2 kcal mol&#8208;1). &#916;EST trends are discussed in light of the geometric predictions as well as qualitative natural bond order analysis to elucidate some of the important electronic structure features. Our work provides a rigorous benchmark for the &#916;EST of fundamental Pn&#8208;R moieties and provides a firm foundation for the continued study of heavier pnictinidenes.</dc:description>

The only cases we predict to have favorable singlet states are P-PH2 (&#8722;3.2 kcal mol-1) and P-NH2 (&#8722;0.2 kcal mol-1). &#916;EST trends are discussed in light of the geometric predictions as well as qualitative natural bond order analysis to elucidate some of the important electronic structure features. Our work provides a rigorous benchmark for the &#916;EST of fundamental Pn-R moieties and provides a firm foundation for the continued study of heavier pnictinidenes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Application of the Redox&#8208;Transmetalation Procedure to Access Divalent Lanthanide and Alkaline&#8208;Earth NHC Complexes**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Redox&#8208;transmetalation is the key: NHC complexes of divalent lanthanides (Sm, Eu, Yb) and alkaline&#8208;earth metals (Ca, Sr) have been accessed by a redox&#8208;transmetalation strategy from NHC&#8208;AgI complexes, a viable procedure when the classical and non&#8208;redox transmetalation methodology fails to proceed. Trends in the bonding of the NHC ligands were established from a detailed experimental and computational analysis.







Abstract
Divalent lanthanide and alkaline&#8208;earth complexes supported by N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands have been accessed by redox&#8208;transmetalation between air&#8208;stable NHC&#8208;AgI complexes and the corresponding metals. By using the small ligand 1,3&#8208;dimethylimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene (IMe), two series of isostructural complexes were obtained: the tetra&#8208;NHC complexes [LnI2(IMe)4] (Ln=Eu and Sm) and the bis&#8208;NHC complexes [MI2(IMe)2(THF)2] (M=Yb, Ca and Sr). In the former, distortions in the NHC coordination were found to originate from intermolecular repulsions in the solid state. Application of the redox&#8208;transmetalation strategy with the bulkier 1,3&#8208;dimesitylimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene (IMes) ligand yielded [SrI2(IMes)(THF)3], while using a similar procedure with Ca metal led to [CaI2(THF)4] and uncoordinated IMes. DFT calculations were performed to rationalise the selective formation of the bis&#8208;NHC adduct in [SrI2(IMe)2(THF)2] and the tetra&#8208;NHC adduct in [SmI2(IMe)4]. Since the results in the gas phase point towards preferential formation of the tetra&#8208;NHC complexes for both metal centres, the differences between both arrangements are a result of solid&#8208;state effects such as slightly different packing forces.

         <title>Bulky Barbiturates as Non&#8208;Toxic Ionic Dye Insulators for Enhanced Emission in Polymeric Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bulky hydrophobic anions based on fluorinated C&#8208;acyl barbiturates with delocalized negative charge are found to provide insulation of ionic dyes, thus preventing their aggregation&#8208;caused quenching in polymeric nanoparticles. Their chemical structure defines dye encapsulation, particle brightness and on/off switching. Compared to currently used anions, C&#8208;acyl barbiturates are non&#8208;toxic, while offering chemical availability and versatility.







Abstract
Bulky hydrophobic counterions (weakly coordinating anions) can insulate ionic dyes against aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) and enable preparation of highly fluorescent dye&#8208;loaded nanoparticles (NPs) for bioimaging, biosensing and light harvesting. Here, we introduce a family of hydrophobic anions based on fluorinated C&#8208;acyl barbiturates with delocalized negative charge and bulky non&#8208;polar groups. Similarly to fluorinated tetraphenylborates, these barbiturates prevent ACQ of cationic dye alkyl rhodamine B inside polymer NPs made of biodegradable poly(lactic&#8208;co&#8208;glycolic acid) (PLGA). Their efficiency to prevent ACQ increases for analogues with higher acidity and bulkiness. Their structure controls dye&#8208;dye communication, yielding bright NPs with on/off switching or stable emission. They enhance dye encapsulation inside NPs, allowing intracellular imaging without dye leakage. Compared to fluorinated tetraphenylborates known as cytotoxic transmembrane ion transporters, the barbiturates display a significantly lower cytotoxicity. These chemically available and versatile barbiturate derivatives are promising counterion scaffolds for preparation of bright non&#8208;toxic fluorescent nanomaterials.

         <title>Design and Synthesis of Nitrogen&#8208;Rich Azo&#8208;Bridged Furoxanylazoles as High&#8208;Performance Energetic Materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of novel energetic materials comprising of azo&#8208;bridged furoxanylazoles enriched with energetic functionalities was designed and synthesized. These high&#8208;energy materials were thoroughly characterized by IR and multinuclear NMR (  1  H,  13  C,  14  N) spectroscopy, high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry, elemental analysis, and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The molecular structures of representative amino and azo oxadiazole assemblies were additionally confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and X&#8208;ray powder diffraction. A comparison of contributions of explosophoric moieties into the density of energetic materials revealed that furoxan and 1,2,4&#8208;oxadiazole rings are the densest motifs while the substitution of the azide and amino fragments on the nitro and azo ones leads to an increase of the density. Azo bridged energetic materials have high nitrogen&#8208;oxygen contents (68.8&#8208;76.9%) and high thermal stability. The synthesized compounds exhibit good experimental densities (1.62&#8208;1.88 g cm  &#8208;3  ), very high enthalpies of formation (846&#8208;1720 kJ mol  &#8208;1  ), and, as a result, excellent detonation performance (detonation velocities 7.66&#8208;9.09 km s  &#8208;1  and detonation pressures 25.0&#8208;37.7 GPa). From the application perspective, the detonation parameters of azo oxadiazole assemblies exceed those of the benchmark explosive RDX, while a combination of high detonation performance and acceptable friction sensitivity of azo(1,2,4&#8208;triazolylfuroxan) make it a promising potential alternative to PETN.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure Recovery and Recycling of the Used LiCoO2 Cathode Material</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The large number of lithium batteries have been retiring from the market of energy storage. Thus, the recycling of the used electrode materials is becoming urgent. In this study, the industrial machinery processing was used to recover the crystal structure of the waste LiCoO  2  materials with the combination of small&#8208;scale equipment repair technology. The results show that the crystal parameters of the repaired LiCoO  2  material become small, the unit cell volume is reduced, and the crystal structure tends to be stable. The Co&#8208;O bond length of 1.9134 nm, O&#8208;Co&#8208;O bond angle of 94.72&#186;, the (003) interplanar spacing of 0.467 nm indicate the excellent recovery level of the repaired LiCoO  2  . In addition, the electrochemical performance of the repaired LiCoO  2  material is greatly improved, compared with the waste material. The capacity of the repaired electrode material can be maintained at 120 mAh g  &#8208;1  after 100 cycles at the current density of 0.2 C. The promising rate performance of the repaired electrode material demonstrates the stable structure. This research work provides a large&#8208;scale method for the direct recovery of LiCoO  2  with the reduction of unnecessary energy and reagent consumption, which will be beneficial to the environmental protection.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The large number of lithium batteries have been retiring from the market of energy storage. Thus, the recycling of the used electrode materials is becoming urgent. In this study, the industrial machinery processing was used to recover the crystal structure of the waste LiCoO  2  materials with the combination of small-scale equipment repair technology. The results show that the crystal parameters of the repaired LiCoO  2  material become small, the unit cell volume is reduced, and the crystal structure tends to be stable. The Co-O bond length of 1.9134 nm, O-Co-O bond angle of 94.72&#186;, the (003) interplanar spacing of 0.467 nm indicate the excellent recovery level of the repaired LiCoO  2  . In addition, the electrochemical performance of the repaired LiCoO  2  material is greatly improved, compared with the waste material. The capacity of the repaired electrode material can be maintained at 120 mAh g  -1  after 100 cycles at the current density of 0.2 C. The promising rate performance of the repaired electrode material demonstrates the stable structure. This research work provides a large-scale method for the direct recovery of LiCoO  2  with the reduction of unnecessary energy and reagent consumption, which will be beneficial to the environmental protection.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mechanistic Investigation of a Synthetic Route to Biaryls via the Sigmatropic Rearrangement of Arylsulfonium Species</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A comprehensive mechanistic investigation was conducted on the coupling reaction of aryl sulfoxides with phenols by means of trifluoroacetic anhydride to yield biaryls. NMR experiments revealed that our previously proposed mechanism, which consists of a cascade of an interrupted Pummerer reaction and a rate&#8208;determining [3,3] sigmatropic rearrangement, is reasonable. The electronic effects of the substrates have also been evaluated to elucidate the nature of the rearrangement step. Based on experimental observations and theoretical calculations, we conclude that the rearrangement is highly asynchronous and stepwise rather than concerted when electron&#8208;rich phenols are employed for the reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Lateral Metallation and Redistribution Reactions of Sodium Ferrates Containing Bulky 2,6&#8208;Diisopropyl&#8208;N&#8208;(trimethylsilyl)anilide Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Alkali&#8208;metal&#160;ferrates containing amide groups have emerged as regioselective bases capable of promoting Fe&#8208;H exchanges of aromatic substrates. Advancing this area of heterobimetallic chemistry, a new series of sodium ferrates is introduced incorporating the bulky arylsilyl amido ligand N(SiMe3)(Dipp) (Dipp= 2,6&#8208;iPr2&#8208;C6H3). Influenced by the large steric demands imposed by this amide, transamination of [NaFe(HMDS)3]&#160;(HMDS = N(SiMe3)2) with an excess of HN(SiMe3)(Dipp)&#160;led to the isolation of heteroleptic&#160;[Na(HMDS)2Fe{N(SiMe3)Dipp}]&#8734;&#160;(1) resulting from the exchange of just one&#160;HMDS&#160;&#160;group. An alternative co&#8208;complexation approach, combining the homometallic metal amides [NaN(SiMe3)Dipp] and [Fe{N(SiMe3)Dipp}2] induces lateral metallation of one Me arm from the SiMe3&#160;group in the iron amide furnishing tetrameric&#160;[NaFe{N(SiCH2Me2)Dipp}{N(SiMe3)Dipp}]4&#160;(2). Reactivity studies support that this deprotonation is driven by the steric incompatibility of the single metal amides rather than the basic capability of the sodium reagent. Displaying synergistic reactivity, heteroleptic sodium ferrate&#160;1&#160;can selectively promote ferration of pentafluorobenzene using one of its HMDS arms to give heterotrileptic&#160;[Na{N(SiMe3)Dipp}(HMDS)Fe(C6F5)]&#8734;&#160;(4).&#160;Attempts to deprotonate less activated pyridine led to the isolation of NaHMDS and heteroleptic Fe(II) amide&#160;[(py)Fe{N(SiMe3)Dipp}(HMDS)] (5),&#160;resulting from an alternative redistribution process which is favoured by the Lewis donor ability of this substrate.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We report on a on the liquid&#8208;crystalline (LC) and luminescent properties of a series of&#160;  N  &#8208;annulated perylenes (  1  &#8208;  4  ) alternating amide and ester groups in their molecular structure. We found that the LC properties of these compounds does not only depends on the number of hydrogen bonding (H&#8208;bonding) units, but also on the relative position of the amide linkers in the molecule. The absence of amide groups in compound&#160;  1  &#160;leads to no LC properties, while the use of four amide groups induces the formation of long temperature range columnar hexagonal phase in compound&#160;  4  . Remarkably, compound&#160;  3,  &#160;bearing two amide groups in the inner part of the structure stabilizes the columnar LC phases better than its structural isomer&#160;  2  , with the amide groups in the outer part of the molecule. In the same direction, we found that only compounds&#160;  1  &#160;and&#160;  2  , with no H&#8208;bonding units in the inner part of the molecule, exhibit luminescence vapochromism upon exposure to organic solvent vapors.</dc:description>

         <title>Umbelliferone Decorated Water&#8208;soluble Zinc(II) Phthalocyanines &#8211; In Vitro Phototoxic Antimicrobial Anti&#8208;cancer Agents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this contribution we report on the synthesis, characterization and application of water&#8209;soluble zinc(II) phthalocyanines which are decorated with four or eight umbelliferone moieties for photodynamic therapy (PDT). These compounds are linked peripherally to zinc(II) phthalocyanine by a tri(ethylene glycol) linker attached to pyridines, leading to cationic pyridinium units, able to increase the water solubility of the system. Beside their photophysical properties they were analyzed concerning their cellular distribution in human hepatocyte carcinoma (HepG2) cells as well as their phototoxicity towards HepG2 cells, Gram&#8209;positive (S. aureus 3150/12 and B. subtilis DB104) and Gram&#8209;negative bacteria (E. coli UTI89 and E. coli Nissle 1917). At low light doses and concentrations, they exhibit superb antimicrobial activity against Gram&#8209;positive bacteria as well as anti&#8209;tumor activity against HepG2. They are even capable to inactivate Gram&#8208;negative bacteria, whereas the dark toxicity remains low. These unique water&#8209;soluble compounds can be regarded as all&#8208;in&#8208;one type photosensitizers with broad applications ranges in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Temperature and Large&#8208;Polarization Ferroelectric with Second Harmonic Generation Response in a Novel Crown Ether Clathrate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular ferroelectrics of high&#8208;temperature reversible phase&#8208;transition are very rare and have attracted increasing attention in recent years. In this paper, we have successfully synthesized  a novel high&#8208;temperature host&#8208;guest inclusion ferroelectric: [  (C  6  H  5  NF  3  )  (18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)][BF  4  ]  (1)  , which shows a pair of reversible peaks at 348 K (heating) and 331 K (cooling) with a heat hysteresis about 17 K by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements, indicating that  1  undergoes a reversible structural phase transition.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Molecular ferroelectrics of high-temperature reversible phase-transition are very rare and have attracted increasing attention in recent years. In this paper, we have successfully synthesized  a novel high-temperature host-guest inclusion ferroelectric: [  (C  6  H  5  NF  3  )  (18-crown-6)][BF  4  ]  (1)  , which shows a pair of reversible peaks at 348 K (heating) and 331 K (cooling) with a heat hysteresis about 17 K by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements, indicating that  1  undergoes a reversible structural phase transition.  The variable-temperature PXRD and temperature-dependent dielectric measurements further prove the phase-transition behavior of  1  . The second harmonic response demonstrates that  1  belongs to a non-centrosymmetric space group at room temperature and is a good nonlinear optical material. Meanwhile,  1  shows a wide optical band gap of about 4.43 eV in semiconducting property and is chiefly contributed by C, H and O atoms of the crystals. In particular, the ferroelectric measurements of  1  exhibit a typical polarization-electric hysteresis loop with large spontaneous polarization (  P  s  ) of about 4.06  &#956;C/  cm  2  . This finding offers an alternative pathway for designing new ferroelectric-dielectric and nonlinear optical materials and related physical properties in organic- inorganic and other hybrid crystals.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hydrogen and Halogen Bonding in Homogeneous External Electric Fields: Modulating the Bond Strengths</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recent years have witnessed various fascinating phenomena arising from the interactions of noncovalent bonds with homogeneous external electric fields (EEFs). Here we performed a computational study to interpret the sensitivity of intrinsic bond strengths to EEFs in terms of steric effect and orbital interactions. The block&#8208;localized wavefunction (BLW) method, which combines the advantages of both  ab initio  valence bond (VB) theory and molecular orbital (MO) theory, and the subsequent energy decomposition (BLW&#8208;ED) approach were adopted. The sensitivity was monitored and analyzed using the induced energy term, which is the variation in each energy component along the EEF strength. Systems with single or multiple hydrogen (H) or halogen (X) bond(s) were also examined. It was found that the X&#8208;bond strength change EEFs mainly stems from the covalency change, while generally the steric effect rules the response of H&#8208;bonds to EEFs. Furthermore, X&#8208;bonds are more sensitive to EEFs, with the key difference between H&#8208; and X&#8208;bonds lying in the charge transfer interaction. Since phenylboronic acid has been experimentally used as a smart linker in EEFs, switchable sensitivity was scrutinized with the example of the phenylboronic acid dimer, which exhibits two conformations with either antiparallel or parallel H&#8208;bonds, thereby, opposite or consistent responses to EEFs. Among the studied systems, the quadruple X&#8208;bonds in molecular capsules exhibit remarkable sensitivity, with its interaction energy increased by &#8208;95.2 kJ/mol at the EEF strength 0.005 a.u..</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Oligonucleotides Containing trans Mitomycin C DNA Adducts at N6 of Adenine and N2 of Guanine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mitomycin C, (MC), an antitumor drug, is a DNA alkylating agent currently used in the clinics. Inert in its native form, MC is reduced to reactive mitosenes which undergo nucleophilic attack by guanine or adenine bases in DNA to form monoadducts as well as interstrand crosslinks (ICLs). Although ICLs are considered the most cytotoxic lesions, the role of each individual adduct in the drug&#8217;s cytotoxicity is still not fully understood. Synthetic routes have been developed to access modified oligonucleotides containing dG MC&#8208;monoadducts and dG&#8208;MC&#8208;dG ICL at a single position of their base sequences to investigate the biological effects of these adducts. However, until now, oligonucleotides containing monoadducts formed by MC at the adenine base had not been&#160;available, thus preventing the examination of the role played by these lesions in the toxicity of MC. Here, we present a route to access these substrates. Structural proof of the adducted oligonucleotides were provided by enzymatic digestion to nucleosides and high resolution mass spectral analysis. Additionally, parent oligonucleotides containing a dG monoadduct and a dG&#8208;MC&#8208;dG ICL were also produced. The stability and physical properties of all substrates were compared  via  CD spectroscopy and UV melting temperature studies. Finally, virtual models were created to explore the conformational space and structural features of these MC&#8208;DNA complexes.</dc:description>

         <title>Double&#8208;shelled Hollow SiO2@N&#8208;C Nanofiber Boosts the Lithium Storage Performance of [PMo12O40]3&#8722;</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polyoxometalates (POMs)&#8208;based materials, with high theoretical capacities and abundant reversible multi&#8208;electron redox properties, are considered as promising candidates in lithium&#8208;ion storage. However, the poor electronic conductivity, low specific surface area and high solubility in the electrolyte limited their practical applications. Herein, a double&#8208;shelled hollow PMo  12  &#8208;SiO  2  @N&#8208;C nanofiber (PMo  12  &#8208;SiO  2  @N&#8208;C, where PMo  12  is [PMo  12  O  40  ]  3&#8208;  , N&#8208;C is nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon) was fabricated for the first time by combining coaxial electrospinning technique, thermal treatment and electrostatic adsorption. As an anode material for LIBs, the PMo  12  &#8208;SiO  2  @N&#8208;C delivered an excellent specific capacity of 1641 mA h g  &#8208;1  after 1000 cycles under 2 A g  &#8208;1  . The excellent electrochemical performance benefit from the unique double&#8208;shelled hollow structure of the material, in which the outermost N&#8208;C shell cannot only hinder the agglomeration of PMo  12  , but also improve its electronic conductivity. The SiO  2  inner shell can efficiently avoid the loss of active components. The hollow structure can buffer the volume expansion accelerate Li  +  diffusion during lithiation/delithiation process. Moreover, PMo  12  can greatly reduce charge&#8208;resistance and facilitate electron transfer of the entire composites, as evidenced by the EIS kinetics study and lithium&#8208;ion diffusion analysis. This work paves the way for the fabrication of novel POM&#8208;based LIBs anode materials with excellent lithium storage performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Topological Transformation of Mg&#8208;containing Layered Double Hydroxide Nanosheets for Efficient Photo&#8208;driven CH4 Coupling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Direct conversion of methane (CH  4  ) to fuels and other high value&#8208;added chemicals is an attractive technology in the chemical industry; however, practical challenges under sustainable process remain. Herein, we report the preparation of a heterostructured Co&#8208;doped MgO&#8208;based catalyst  via  topological transformation of a MgCo&#8208;layered double hydroxide (LDH) calcination from 200 to 1100  o  C. The catalyst can remarkably activate CH  4  coupling to produce C  2  H  6  with a selectivity of 41.60% within 3 h under a full&#8208;spectrum irradiation when calcination of LDH at 800  o  C. Characterization studies and catalytic results suggest that the highly dispersed active sites and large interfaces amongst the Co&#8208;doped MgO&#8208;based catalyst enable surface activation of CH  4  to methyl (CH  3  *), in turn promoting the coupling of CH  3  * to C  2  H  6  . This study introduces a promising pathway for the photo&#8208;driven CH  4  coupling to high value&#8208;added chemicals by using layered double hydroxides as a precursor.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>

         <dc:description>Anion receptors employing two distinct sensory mechanisms are rare. Herein we report the first examples of halogen bonding porphyrin&#8208;BODIPY [2]rotaxanes capable of both fluorescent and redox electrochemical sensing of anions.  1  H NMR, UV/visible and electrochemical studies reveal rotaxane axle triazole group coordination to the zinc(II) metalloporphyrin containing macrocycle component, serves to preorganise the rotaxane binding cavity and dramatically enhance anion binding affinities. Mechanically bonded integrated axle BODIPY and macrocycle strapped metalloporphyrin motifs, enable the anion recognition event to be sensed  via  significant quenching of the BODIPY fluorophore and cathodic perturbations of the metalloporphyrin P/P  +&#8226;  redox couple.</dc:description>

         <title>Facile Synthesis of Platinum Right Bipyramids by Separating and Controlling the Nucleation Step in a Continuous Flow System</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Colloidal synthesis of metal nanocrystals with controlled shapes and internal structures calls for a tight control over both the nucleation and growth processes. Here we report a method for the facile synthesis of Pt right bipyramids (RBPs) by separating nucleation from growth and controlling the nucleation step in a continuous flow reactor. Specifically, homogeneous nucleation was thermally triggered by introducing the reaction solution into a tubular flow reactor held at an elevated temperature to generate singly&#8208;twinned seeds. At a lower temperature, the singly&#8208;twinned seeds were protected from oxidative etching to allow their slow growth and evolution into RBPs while additional nucleation of undesired seeds could be largely suppressed to ensure RBPs as the main product. Further investigation indicated that the internal structure and growth pattern of the seeds were determined by the temperatures used for the nucleation and growth steps, respectively. The Br  &#8208;  ions involved in the synthesis also played a critical role in the generation of RBPs by serving as a capping agent for the Pt{100} facets while regulating the reduction kinetics through coordination with the Pt(IV) ions.</dc:description>

         <title>Aminotroponiminates: Impact of the NO2 Functional Group on Coordination, Isomerisation, and Backbone Substitution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aminotroponiminate (ATI) ligands are a versatile class of redox&#8208;active and potentially cooperative ligands with a rich coordination chemistry, which have consequently found a wide range of applications in synthesis and catalysis. While backbone substitution of these ligands has been investigated in some detail, the impact of electron&#8208;withdrawing groups on the coordination chemistry and reactivity of ATIs is only little investigated. We report here Li, Na, and K salts of an ATI ligand with a nitro&#8208;substituent in the backbone. It is demonstrated that the NO  2  group actively contributes to the coordination chemistry of these complexes, effectively competing with the  N  ,  N  &#8208;binding pocket as a coordination site. This results in an unprecedented  E  /  Z  &#8208;isomerisation of an ATI imino group and culminates in the isolation of the first &#8220;naked&#8221; ATI anion (i.e. without directional bonding to a metal atom). Reactions of sodium ATIs with silver(I) and tritylium salts gave the first  N,N  coordinated silver ATI complexes and unprecedented backbone substitution reactions. Analytical techniques applied in this work include multinuclear (VT&#8208;)NMR spectroscopy, single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis, and DFT calculations.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Peptides and nucleic acids can self&#8208;assemble to give supramolecular structures that find application in different fields, ranging from the delivery of drugs to the obtainment of materials endowed with optical properties. Forces that stabilize the &#8220;suprastructures&#8221; typically are hydrogen bonds or aromatic interactions; in case of nucleic acids, Watson&#8208;Crick pairing drives self&#8208;assembly while, in case of peptides, backbone hydrogen bonds and interactions between aromatic side chains trigger the formation of structures, such as nanotubes or ribbons. Molecules containing both aromatic peptides and nucleic acids could in principle exploit different forces to self&#8208;assemble. In this work we meant to investigate the self&#8208;assembly of mixed systems, with the aim to understand which forces play a major role and determine formation/structure of aggregates. We therefore synthesized conjugates of the peptide FF to the Peptide Nucleic Acid dimer &#8220;gc&#8221; and characterized their aggregates by different spectroscopic techniques, including NMR, CD and fluorescence.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient entropy&#8208;driven inhibition of dipeptidyl peptidase III by hydroxyethylene transition state peptidomimetics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dipeptidyl peptidase III (DPP3) is a ubiquitously expressed Zn&#8208;dependent protease, which plays an important role in regulating endogenous peptide hormones, such as enkephalins or angiotensins. In previous biophysical studies, we could show that substrate binding is driven by a large entropic contribution due to the release of water molecules from the closing binding cleft. Here, we report the design, synthesis and biophysical characterization of peptidomimetic inhibitors using for the first time an hydroxyethylene transition&#8208;state mimetic for a metalloprotease. Efficient routes for the synthesis of both stereoisomers of the pseudopeptide core were developed, which allowed the synthesis of peptidomimetic inhibitors mimicking the VVYPW&#8208;motif of tynorphin. The best inhibitors inhibit DPP3 in the low &#181;M range. Biophysical characterization by means of ITC measurement and X&#8208;ray crystallography confirm the unusual entropy&#8208;driven mode of binding. Stability assays demonstrated the desired stability of these inhibitors, which efficiently inhibited DPP3 in mouse brain homogenate.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Dipeptidyl peptidase III (DPP3) is a ubiquitously expressed Zn-dependent protease, which plays an important role in regulating endogenous peptide hormones, such as enkephalins or angiotensins.

         <title>The Impact of C2&#8208;Insertion into Carbazole Donor on Physicochemical Properties of Dibenzo[a,j]phenazine&#8208;Cored Donor&#8211;Acceptor&#8211;Donor Triads</title>

         <dc:description>Novel electron&#8208;donor&#8211;acceptor&#8208;donor (D&#8211;A&#8211;D) compounds comprising of dibenzo[a,j  ]phenazine as the central acceptor core and two 7&#8208;membered diarylamines (i.e., iminodibenzyl and iminostilbene) as the donors have been designed and synthesized. The investigation of their physicochemical properties revealed the impact of C2&#8208;insertion into well&#8208;known carbazole electron&#8208;donors on the properties of previously reported twisted dibenzo[  a,j]phenazine&#8208;cored D&#8211;A&#8211;D triads. Slight structural modification caused a drastic change in conformational preference, allowing unique photophysical behavior of dual emission derived from room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence and triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation. Furthermore, the electrochemical analysis suggested the sigma&#8208;dimer formation and electrochemical polymerization on the electrode. Quantum chemical calculations have also rationalized the experimental results.</dc:description>

         <title>Carbon dioxide capture enhanced by pre&#8208;adsorption of water and methanol in UiO&#8208;66</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The rapidly rising level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere resulting from human activity is one of the greatest environmental problems facing our civilization today. Most technologies are not yet sufficiently developed to move existing infrastructure to cleaner alternatives. Therefore, techniques for capturing carbon dioxide from emission sources may play a key role at the moment. The structure of the UiO&#8208;66 material not only meets the requirement of high stability in contact with water vapor but through the water pre adsorbed in the pores, the selectivity of carbon dioxide adsorption is increased. We successfully applied the recently developed methodology for water adsorption modelling. It allowed to elucidate the influence of water on CO  2  adsorption and study the mechanism of this effect. We showed that water is adsorbed in octahedral cage and stands for promotor for CO  2  adsorption in less favorable space than tetrahedral cages. Water plays a role of a mediator of adsorption, what is a general idea of improving affinity of adsorbate. On the basis of pre&#8208;adsorption of methanol as another polar solvent, we have shown that the adsorption sites play a key role here, and not, as previously thought, only the interaction between the solvent and quadrupole carbon dioxide. Overall, we explained the mechanism of increased CO  2  adsorption in the presence of water and methanol, as polar solvents, in the UiO&#8208;66 pores for a potential post&#8208;combustion carbon dioxide capture application.</dc:description>

         <title>Ternary Conductance Switching Realized by a Pillar[5]arene&#8208;Functionalized Two&#8208;dimensional Imine Polymer Film</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nowadays, most manufacturing memory devices are based on materials with electrical bistability (i.e., &#8220;0&#8221; and &#8220;1&#8221;) in response to an applied electric field. Memory devices with multilevel states are highly desired to produce high&#8208;density and efficient memory devices. Herein, we report for the first time a multichannel strategy to realize ternary state memristor. We make use of the intrinsic subnanometer channel of pillar[5]arene and nanometer channel of two&#8208;dimensional imine polymer to construct an active layer with muiltilevel channels for ternary memory devices. Low threshold voltage, long retention time, clearly distinguishable resistance states, high ON/OFF ratio (OFF/ON1/ON2 = 1:10:10  3  ), and high ternary yield (75%) were obtained. In addition, the flexible memory device based on 2DP  TPAZ+TAPB  can maintain its stable ternary memory performance after bending for 500 times. The device also exhibits excellent thermal stability and can tolerate a high temperature of 300 &#176;C. The results in this work are envisioned to open up possibilities for multistate, flexible resistive memories with good thermal stability and low energy consumption and broaden the application of pillar[n]arene.</dc:description>
