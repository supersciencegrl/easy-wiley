         <title>Retro&#8208;Friedel&#8208;Crafts&#8208;Type Acidic Ring&#8208;Opening of Triptycenes: A New Synthetic Approach to Acenes</title>

         <dc:description>
The triptycene scaffold has been ring&#8208;opened in a retro&#8208;Friedel&#8208;Crafts&#8208;type reaction under acidic conditions to give its corresponding anthrone product. 9&#8208;Hydroxytriptycenes and unsubstituted triptycene undergo ring&#8208;opening reaction under strongly acidic conditions, such as with TfOH. An investigation of the substitution effect has revealed that the electron&#8208;donating group on the arene moiety allows the reaction to proceed in the presence of a weaker acid, such as TFA. In addition, the reaction has been successfully applied toward the synthesis of tetracene.

         <title>Unlocking the Hydrolytic Mechanism of GH92 &#945;&#8208;1,2&#8208;Mannosidases: Computation Inspires the use of C&#8208;Glycosides as Michaelis Complex Mimics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Glycoside hydrolase 92 enzymes catalyze the degradation of N&#8208;glycans containing chains of &#945;&#8208;mannose. Since experiments with S&#8208;glycosides did not shed light about the conformation of the Michaelis complex (MC), we present a multidisciplinary work where computation and experiments demonstrate the reactive conformation adopted by the sugar in the MC. In addition, we demonstrate the power of C&#8208;glycosides as MC mimics.







Abstract
The conformational changes in a sugar moiety along the hydrolytic pathway are key to understand the mechanism of glycoside hydrolases (GHs) and to design new inhibitors. The two predominant itineraries for mannosidases go via OS2&#8594;B2,5&#8594;1S5 and 3S1&#8594;3H4&#8594;1C4. For the CAZy family 92, the conformational itinerary was unknown. Published complexes of Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron GH92 catalyst with a S&#8208;glycoside and mannoimidazole indicate a 4C1&#8594;4H5/1S5&#8594;1S5 mechanism. However, as observed with the GH125 family, S&#8208;glycosides may not act always as good mimics of GH's natural substrate. Here we present a cooperative study between computations and experiments where our results predict the E5&#8594;B2,5/1S5&#8594;1S5 pathway for GH92 enzymes. Furthermore, we demonstrate the Michaelis complex mimicry of a new kind of C&#8208;disaccharides, whose biochemical applicability was still a chimera.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Degradable Protein&#8208;Polymer Hybrid Shells for Caging Living Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy towards the remote control of cell functions is reported. Photo&#8208;degradable protein&#8208;polymer hybrid shells for protecting the whole cell surface were developed by the layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer assembly of polymers and polymer micelles through protein&#8208;ligand binding. These shells can be used to photo&#8208;regulate cellular functions by steric hinderance against the interaction between cell surfaces and substrates.







Abstract
There is growing demand for the precise remote control of cellular functions in various fields. Herein, a method for caging mammalian cells by coating with photodegradable protein&#8208;polymer hybrid shells to photo&#8208;control their functions without genetic engineering is reported. A layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer assembly of photocleavable synthetic materials through biotin&#8208;streptavidin (SA) binding was employed for cell coating. The cell surfaces were first biotinylated with photocleavable biotinylated poly(ethylene glycol)(PEG)&#8208;lipid and then coated by repeatedly layering SA and micelles of the PEG&#8208;lipid and photocleavable biotinylated four&#8208;arm PEG. The cell extension and adhesion were suppressed with the shells and then triggered with the degradation of the shells by light exposure. Macrophage phagocytosis was also stopped by caging with the shells and restarted by light&#8208;guided uncaging. This study provides the first proof of principle that cellular functions can be remotely controlled by steric hinderance of cell surfaces with photodegradable materials.

         <title>Remote Oxidative Activation of a [Cp*Rh] Monohydride**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Redox chemistry: [Cp*Rh] complexes supported by chelating diphosphine ligands can support generation of isolable metal monohydrides, but prior work has shown that the reduction potentials required to promote cleavage of Rh&#8722;H moieties in these complexes are quite negative. Herein, ligand&#8208;centered oxidation of a [Cp*Rh] monohydride is demonstrated to result in dramatic acidification of a Rh&#8722;H by 23 pKa units. Ligand&#8208;promoted redox chemistry could thus be a useful tool for promoting reactivity in metal&#8211;hydride systems.







Abstract
Half&#8208;sandwich rhodium monohydrides are often proposed as intermediates in catalysis, but little is known regarding the redox&#8208;induced reactivity accessible to these species. Herein, the bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocene (dppf) ligand has been used to explore the reactivity that can be induced when a [Cp*Rh] monohydride undergoes remote (dppf&#8208;centered) oxidation by 1e&#8722;. Chemical and electrochemical studies show that one&#8208;electron redox chemistry is accessible to Cp*Rh(dppf), including a unique quasi&#8208;reversible RhII/I process at &#8722;0.96&#8197;V vs. ferrocenium/ferrocene (Fc+/0). This redox manifold was confirmed by isolation of an uncommon RhII species, [Cp*Rh(dppf)]+, that was characterized by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. Protonation of Cp*Rh(dppf) with anilinium triflate yielded an isolable and inert monohydride, [Cp*Rh(dppf)H]+, and this species was found to undergo a quasireversible electrochemical oxidation at +0.41&#8197;V vs. Fc+/0 that corresponds to iron&#8208;centered oxidation in the dppf backbone. Thermochemical analysis predicts that this dppf&#8208;centered oxidation drives a dramatic increase in acidity of the Rh&#8722;H moiety by 23 pKa units, a reactivity pattern confirmed by in situ 1H NMR studies. Taken together, these results show that remote oxidation can effectively induce M&#8722;H activation and suggest that ligand&#8208;centered redox activity could be an attractive feature for the design of new systems relying on hydride intermediates.

Taken together, these results show that remote oxidation can effectively induce M&#8722;H activation and suggest that ligand-centered redox activity could be an attractive feature for the design of new systems relying on hydride intermediates.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Boron&#8208;, Sulfur&#8208; and Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon Multiple Resonance Emitters for Narrow&#8208;Band Blue Emission</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Boron&#8208;, sulfur&#8208; and nitrogen&#8208;doped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emitters are designed and synthesized to combine high photoluminescent quantum efficiency and rapid reverse intersystem crossing in one multiple resonance system for efficient narrow&#8208;band blue emission with full width at half maximum of 29&#8197;nm, which provides an avenue to expand the structure library for PAH skeletons with multiple resonance effect and narrow&#8208;band emission.







Abstract
Two boron&#8208;, sulfur&#8208; and nitrogen&#8208;doped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitters with high photoluminescent quantum efficiency (88&#8201;%) and rapid reverse intersystem crossing (kRISC= 1.0&#215;105&#8197;s&#8722;1) are designed and synthesized, enabling efficient narrow&#8208;band blue electroluminescence at 473&#8197;nm with full width at half maximum of 29&#8197;nm and maximum external quantum efficiency of 22.0&#8201;%, which provides an avenue to expand the structure library for multiple resonance emitters and an approach to regulate their emission properties.

         <title>Nonaqueous Emulsion Polycondensation Enabled by a Self&#8208;Assembled Cage&#8208;like Surfactant</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cationic self&#8208;assembled coordination cage was decorated with cholesterol groups attached via ethoxy chains, giving it a pronounced amphiphilic character. The nanosized cage acts as a surfactant for a variety of nonaqueous emulsions. These were employed in mini&#8208;emulsion polymerization reactions to produce polyurethane and polyurea materials with different particle sizes and morphologies.







Abstract
Nonaqueous emulsions are crucial for a range of applications based on water&#8208;sensitive systems such as controlled polymerizations requiring anhydrous reaction conditions and the stabilization of readily hydrolyzable reagents or pharmacologically active components. However, defined molecular surfactants to stabilize such nonaqueous emulsions are scarce. We introduce a self&#8208;assembled coordination cage, decorated with cholesterol functionalities, to serve as a molecular surfactant for various oil&#8208;in&#8208;oil emulsions of immiscible organic solvents. While the positively charged cage forms the amphiphile's polar moiety, the non&#8208;polar cholesterol appendices can bend in a common direction to stabilize the emulsion. Templated by the droplets, polycondensation reactions were carried out to produce microstructured polyurethane and polyurea materials of different particle sizes and morphologies. Further, the amphiphilic cage can encapsulate a guest molecule and the resulting host&#8208;guest assembly was also examined as a surfactant. In addition, the aggregation behavior of the amphiphilic cage in an aqueous medium was examined.

         <title>A Semiconductor&#8208;Mediator&#8208;Catalyst Artificial Photosynthetic System for Photoelectrochemical Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hybrid semiconductor&#8208;mediator&#8208;catalyst photoelectrochemical (PEC) cell mimicking the PSII is proposed for efficient water oxidation. Addition of carbazole mediator results in a significant enhancement in PEC water oxidation performance as it promotes interfacial hole transfer from the Fe2O3 light absorber to the Ru(carbene) catalyst, a function similar to the tyrosine residue in photosystem II. Such a semiconductor&#8208;mediator&#8208;catalyst assembly greatly inspires the rational design of high&#8208;performance artificial photosynthesis systems.







Abstract
In fabricating an artificial photosynthesis (AP) electrode for water oxidation, we have devised a semiconductor&#8208;mediator&#8208;catalyst structure that mimics photosystem II (PSII). It is based on a surface layer of vertically grown nanorods of Fe2O3 on fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) electrodes with a carbazole mediator base and a Ru(II) carbene complex on a nanolayer of TiO2 as a water oxidation co&#8208;catalyst. The resulting hybrid assembly, FTO|Fe2O3|&#8722;carbazole|TiO2|&#8722;Ru(carbene), demonstrates an enhanced photoelectrochemical (PEC) water oxidation performance compared to an electrode without the added carbaozle base with an increase in photocurrent density of 2.2&#8208;fold at 0.95&#8197;V vs. NHE and a negatively shifted onset potential of 500&#8197;mV. The enhanced PEC performance is attributable to carbazole mediator accelerated interfacial hole transfer from Fe2O3 to the Ru(II) carbene co&#8208;catalyst, with an improved effective surface area for the water oxidation reaction and reduced charge transfer resistance.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Chemical Protein Synthesis Utilizing Fmoc&#8208;Masked Selenazolidine to address the Redox Functionality of Human Selenoprotein F</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Human SELENOF is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) selenoprotein that contains the redox active motif CXU (C is cysteine and U is selenocysteine), resembling the redox motif of thiol&#8208;disulfide oxidoreductases (CXXC). Like other selenoproteins, the challenge in accessing SELENOF has somewhat limited its full biological characterization thus far. Here we present the one&#8208;pot chemical synthesis of the thioredoxin&#8208;like domain of SELENOF, highlighted by the use of Fmoc&#8208;protected selenazolidine, native chemical ligations and deselenization reactions. The redox potential of the CXU motif, together with insulin turbidimetric assay suggested that SELENOF may catalyze the reduction of disulfides in misfolded proteins. Furthermore, we demonstrate that SELENOF is not a protein disulfide isomerase (PDI)&#8208;like enzyme, as it did not enhance the folding of the two protein models; bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor and hirudin. These studies suggest that SELENOF may be responsible for reducing the non&#8208;native disulfide bonds of misfolded glycoproteins as part of the quality control system in the ER.</dc:description>

         <title>Thermodynamically Favourable States in the Reaction of Nitrogenase without Dissociation of any Sulfide Ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reaction mechanism of nitrogenase from N2H2 to 2&#8201;NH3 without any dissociated sulfide ligands has been studied by QM/MM methods. The calculations suggest an alternating mechanism in which the substrate binds to Fe6. Homocitrate functions as a proton buffer, stabilising H2NNH2 and NH3 intermediates. The two NH3 products dissociate at the E7 and E8 levels. His&#8208;195 prefers protonation on the NE2 atom and proton transfer from this residue is favourable for all steps.







Abstract
We have used combined quantum mechanical and molecular mechanical (QM/MM) calculations to study the reaction mechanism of nitrogenase, assuming that none of the sulfide ligands dissociates. To avoid the problem that there is no consensus regarding the structure and protonation of the E4 state, we start from a state where N2 is bound to the cluster and is protonated to N2H2, after dissociation of H2. We show that the reaction follows an alternating mechanism with HNNH (possibly protonated to HNNH2) and H2NNH2 as intermediates and the two NH3 products dissociate at the E7 and E8 levels. For all intermediates, coordination to Fe6 is preferred, but for the E4 and E8 intermediates, binding to Fe2 is competitive. For the E4, E5 and E7 intermediates we find that the substrate may abstract a proton from the hydroxy group of the homocitrate ligand of the FeMo cluster, thereby forming HNNH2, H2NNH2 and NH3 intermediates. This may explain why homocitrate is a mandatory component of nitrogenase. All steps in the suggested reaction mechanism are thermodynamically favourable compared to protonation of the nearby His&#8208;195 group and in all cases, protonation of the NE2 atom of the latter group is preferred.

         <title>Characterizing Enzyme Cooperativity with Imaging SAMDI&#8208;MS</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;throughput and label&#8208;free method is established for to characterize the degree of cooperativity and K0.5 of a cooperative metal&#8208;enzyme binding interaction using microfluidics and imaging self&#8208;assembled monolayers for matrix&#8208;assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (iSAMDI). Numerical calculations were used to build a finite element model to describe the spatiotemporal pattern of reaction yields for each channel within the microfluidic device.







Abstract
This paper describes a method that combines a microfluidic device and self&#8208;assembled monolayers for matrix&#8208;assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (SAMDI) mass spectrometry to calculate the cooperativity in binding of calcium ions to peptidylarginine deiminase type 2 (PAD2). This example uses only 120&#8197;&#956;L of enzyme solution and three fluidic inputs. This microfluidic device incorporates a self&#8208;assembled monolayer that is functionalized with a peptide substrate for PAD2. The enzyme and different concentrations of calcium ions are flowed through each of eight channels, where the position along the channel corresponds to reaction time and position across the channel corresponds to the concentration of Ca2+. Imaging SAMDI (iSAMDI) is then used to determine the yield for the enzyme reaction at each 200&#8197;&#956;m pixel on the monolayer, providing a time course for the reactions. Analysis of the peptide conversion as a function of position and time gives the degree of cooperativity (n) and the concentration of ligand required for half maximal activity (K0.5) for the Ca2+ &#8211; dependent activation of PAD2. This work establishes a high&#8208;throughput and label&#8208;free method for studying enzyme&#8208;ligand binding interactions and widens the applicability of microfluidics and matrix&#8208;assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI) imaging mass spectrometry.

         <title>Redox Replacement of Silver on MOF&#8208;Derived Cu/C Nanoparticles on Gas Diffusion Electrodes for Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
From CO2 to C2+: A novel Cu/C&#8722;Ag nanostructured catalyst has been synthesized by electroless redox replacement directly on gas&#8208;diffusion electrodes. An optimum Cu/Ag composition with similar&#8208;sized nanoparticles showed the highest conversion of CO2 to C2+ products compared to only Cu&#8208;modified gas diffusion electrodes. In&#8208;situ Raman spectroscopy and gas chromatography measurements suggest two parallel CO2 reduction mechanisms to produce HCO2H and C2+ products on the bimetallic Cu/Ag surface.







Abstract
Bimetallic tandem catalysts have emerged as a promising strategy to locally increase the CO flux during electrochemical CO2 reduction, so as to maximize the rate of conversion to C&#8722;C&#8208;coupled products. Considering this, a novel Cu/C&#8722;Ag nanostructured catalyst has been prepared by a redox replacement process, in which the ratio of the two metals can be tuned by the replacement time. An optimum Cu/Ag composition with similarly sized particles showed the highest CO2 conversion to C2+ products compared to non&#8208;Ag&#8208;modified gas&#8208;diffusion electrodes. Gas chromatography and in&#8208;situ Raman measurements in a CO2 gas diffusion cell suggest the formation of top&#8208;bound linear adsorbed *CO followed by consumption of CO in the successive cascade steps, as evidenced by the increasing&#957;C&#8722;H bands. These findings suggest that two mechanisms operate simultaneously towards the production of HCO2H and C&#8722;C&#8208;coupled products on the Cu/Ag bimetallic surface.

         <title>Transition Metal&#8208;Free Synthesis of meta&#8208;Bromo&#8208; and meta&#8208;Trifluoromethylanilines from Cyclopentanones by a Cascade Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fully regioselective synthesis of meta&#8208;bromo&#8208; and meta&#8208;trifluoromethylanilines through a cascade reaction from bench&#8208;stable non&#8208;aromatic precursors is reported. The convenient reaction setup requires only heating of the desired amine and the bench&#8208;stable reagents in sulfolane. The method is compatible with a broad range of primary, secondary and aromatic amines and proceeds in 20&#8211;81&#8201;% yields.







Abstract
Anilines are key constituents in biologically active compounds and often obtained from transition metal&#8208;catalyzed coupling of an aryl halide with an amine. In this work, we report a transition metal&#8208;free method for the synthesis of meta&#8208;bromo&#8208; and meta&#8208;trifluoromethylanilines starting from 3&#8208;tribromomethylcyclopentanone or 3&#8208;(2&#8208;bromo&#8208;2&#8208;chloro&#8208;1,1,1&#8208;trifluoroethyl)cyclopentanone, respectively. The scope of the transformation is shown by application of primary, secondary and aromatic amines. The reaction proceeds in acceptable to high yields (20&#8211;81&#8201;%), and allows for the synthesis of anilines with substitution patterns otherwise difficult to access.

A TADF OLED achieves an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 23&#8201;% and operation lifetime (LT50) of over 20&#8201;000&#8197;h at 1000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2. Moreover, a phosphorescent OLED achieves an EQE of 21&#8201;% and LT50 of over 30&#8201;000&#8197;h at 1000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2.







Abstract
The weak stability of a hole&#8208;transporter upon approaching the anion state is one of the major bottlenecks for developing long&#8208;life organic light&#8208;emitting devices (OLEDs). Therefore, in this study, we developed a series of thermally and electrically stable hole&#8208;transporters that are end&#8208;capped with four dibenzofuran units. These materials exhibit i)&#8197;high bond dissociation energy (BDE) toward the anion state, ii)&#8197;a high glass transition temperature (Tg&gt;130&#8201;&#176;C), and iii)&#8197;high triplet energy (ET&gt;2.7&#8197;eV), thereby enabling approximately 20&#8201;% high external quantum efficiency (EQE) and significantly prolonging the stability of both thermally activated delayed fluorescent (TADF) and phosphorescent OLEDs with an operation lifetime at 50&#8201;% (LT50) of 20&#8201;000&#8211;30&#8201;000&#8197;h at 1000&#8197;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2. In addition, investigating their structure&#8208;property relationship revealed that ionization potential (IP), BDE, and Tg are critical prerequisites for the hole&#8208;transporter to prolong lifetime in OLEDs.

         <title>Cyclopentannulated Dihydrotetraazapentacenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The alkyne units of bissilylethynylated N,N&#8217;&#8208;dihydrotetraazapentacene are transferred into a dihydrotetraazapentacene core by a transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed cycloisomerization reaction to form a new type of cyclopentannulated tetraazapentacene. Depending on the applied catalyst systems, either silyl group retention or migration takes place, which gives rise to constitutional isomers that show comparable optoelectronic properties but completely different packing motifs in the solid states.







Abstract
The transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed cyclization of bissilylethynylated N,N&#8217;&#8208;dihydrotetraazapentacene (TIPS&#8208;TAP&#8208;H2) into bissilylated cyclopenta[fg,qr]pentacenes is reported. Depending on the catalyst either none, one or two silyl groups migrate and change their positions in the formed five&#8208;membered rings. The optoelectronic properties are quite similar, whereas the packing motifs differ dramatically. Control experiments and quantum chemical calculations were performed to investigate the mechanism of the reaction and the selectivity of the silyl shift.

         <title>A Mechanism for Nitrogenase Including Loss of a Sulfide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lost property: The possible loss of a sulfide mechanism for the Mo&#8208;nitrogenase has been investigated by hybrid DFT using a cluster model. The calculations show that, after four reductions, a sulfide can be released as a H2S group. After another four reductions, the central carbon is protonated with one proton in E4, from where the loss of H2 and binding of N2 is reversible.







Abstract
Nitrogenase is the only enzyme in nature that can fix N2 from the air. The active cofactor of the leading form of this enzyme contains seven irons and one molybdenum connected by sulfide bridges. In several recent experimental studies, it has been suggested that the cofactor is very flexible, and might lose one of its sulfides during catalysis. In this study, the possible loss of a sulfide has been investigated by model calculations. In previous studies, we have shown that there should be four activation steps before catalysis starts, and this study is based on that finding. It was found here that, after the four reductions in the activation steps, a sulfide will become very loosely bound and can be released in a quite exergonic step with a low barrier. The binding of N2 has no part in that release. In our previous studies, we suggested that the central carbide should be protonated three times after the four activation steps. With the new finding, there will instead be a loss of a sulfide, as the barrier for the loss is much lower than the ones for protonating the carbide. Still, it is suggested here that the carbide will be protonated anyway, but only with one proton, in the E3 to E4 step. A very complicated transition state for H2 formation involving a large structural change was obtained. The combined step, with a loss of H2 and binding of N2, is calculated to be endergonic by +2.3&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1; this is in excellent agreement with experiments in which an easily reversible step has been found.

         <title>Inverse&#8208;Tunable Red Luminescence and Electronic Properties of Nitridoberylloaluminates Sr2&#8722;xBax[BeAl3N5]:Eu2+ (x=0&#8211;2)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The nitridoberylloaluminate Sr2&#8722;xBax[BeAl3N5]:Eu2+ (x=0&#8211;2) were synthesized in a HIP under 50&#8197;MPa N2 atmosphere at 1200&#8211;1400&#8201;&#176;C. In contrast to the usual trend, the emission maximum in the prepared samples is inversely shifted to higher wavelengths by the incorporation of the larger cation Ba2+.







Abstract
The nitridoberylloaluminate Ba2[BeAl3N5]:Eu2+ and solid solutions Sr2&#8722;xBax[BeAl3N5]:Eu2+ (x=0.5, 1.0, 1.5) were synthesized in a hot isostatic press (HIP) under 50&#8197;MPa N2 atmosphere at 1200&#8201;&#176;C. Ba2[BeAl3N5]:Eu2+ crystallizes in triclinic space group 
 (no. 2) (Z=2, a=6.1869(10), b=7.1736(13), c=8.0391(14)&#8197;&#197;, &#945;=102.754(8), &#946;=112.032(6), &#947;=104.765(7)&#176;), which was determined from single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction data. The lattice parameters of the solid solution series have been obtained from Rietveld refinements and show a nearly linear dependence on the atomic ratio Sr&#8201;:&#8201;Ba. The electronic properties and the band gaps of M2[BeAl3N5] (M=Sr, Ba) have been investigated by a combination of soft X&#8208;ray spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Upon irradiation with blue light (440&#8211;450&#8197;nm), the nitridoberylloaluminates exhibit intense orange to red luminescence, which can be tuned between 610 and 656&#8197;nm (fwhm=1922&#8211;2025&#8197;cm&#8722;1 (72&#8211;87&#8197;nm)). In contrast to the usual trend, the substitution of the smaller Sr2+ by larger Ba2+ leads to an inverse&#8208;tunable luminescence to higher wavelengths. Low&#8208;temperature luminescence measurements have been performed to exclude anomalous emission.

         <title>A New Variant of Emissive RNA Alphabets</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The substrate scope of T7 RNA Polymerase and adenosine deaminase (ADA) are expanded by the introduction of a new ribonucleoside alphabet based on a methylthieno[3,4&#8208;d]pyrimidine core. The majority of the new analogues display significantly red shifted emission relative to the corresponding thieno[3,4&#8208;d]pyrimidine and isothiazolo[4,3&#8208;d]pyrimidine based analogues.







Abstract
A new fluorescent ribonucleoside alphabet (mthN) consisting of pyrimidine and purine analogues, all derived from methylthieno[3,4&#8208;d]pyrimidine as the heterocyclic core, is described. Large bathochromic shifts and high microenvironmental susceptibility of their emission relative to previous alphabets derived from thieno[3,4&#8208;d]pyrimidine (thN) and isothiazole[4,3&#8208;d]pyrimidine (tzN) scaffolds are observed. Subjecting the purine analogues to adenosine deaminase, guanine deaminase and T7 RNA polymerase indicate that, while varying, all but one enzyme tolerate the corresponding mthN/mthNTP substrates. The robust emission quantum yields, high photophysical responsiveness and enzymatic accommodation suggest that the mthN alphabet is a biophysically viable tool and can be used to probe the tolerance of nucleoside/tide&#8208;processing enzymes to structural perturbations of their substrates.

         <title>Simultaneous Organic and Inorganic Host&#8208;Guest Chemistry within Pillararene&#8208;Protein Cage Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Very accepting: (Apo)ferritin protein cages self&#8208;assemble with cationic pillararenes into porous crystalline framework structures. The apoferritin and pillararene in the crystals can simultaneously host inorganic and organic pollutants, where the binding is determined by the host&#8208;guest chemistry.







Abstract
Supramolecular self&#8208;assembly of biomolecules provides a powerful bottom&#8208;up strategy to build functional nanostructures and materials. Among the different biomacromolecules, protein cages offer various advantages including uniform size, versatility, multi&#8208;modularity, and high stability. Additionally, protein cage crystals present confined microenvironments with well&#8208;defined dimensions. On the other hand, molecular hosts, such as cyclophanes, possess a defined cavity size and selective recognition of guest molecules. However, the successful combination of macrocycles and protein cages to achieve functional co&#8208;crystals has remained limited. In this study, we demonstrate electrostatic binding between cationic pillar[5]arenes and (apo)ferritin cages that results in porous and crystalline frameworks. The electrostatically assembled crystals present a face&#8208;centered cubic (FCC) lattice and have been characterized by means of small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering and cryo&#8208;TEM. These hierarchical structures result in a multiadsorbent framework capable of hosting both organic and inorganic pollutants, such as dyes and toxic metals, with potential application in water&#8208;remediation technologies.

         <title>A Solid Support&#8208;Based Synthetic Strategy for the Site&#8208;Selective Functionalization of Peptides with Organometallic Half&#8208;Sandwich Moieties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The site&#8208;selective functionalization of peptides with metal moieties has been achieved with a carbene ligand on solid support which facilitated the isolation and purification of metal&#8208;peptide conjugates. The developed methodology allows the metalation of Lys side chain functional groups and the N&#8208;terminus in presence of competing metal&#8208;binding amino acids.







Abstract
The number of donor atoms available on peptides that can competitively coordinate to metal centers renders the site&#8208;selective generation of advanced metal&#8208;peptide conjugates in high purity a challenging venture. Herein, we present a transmetalation&#8208;based synthetic approach on solid support in which an imidazolium pro&#8208;ligand can be used to selectively anchor a range of transition metal half&#8208;sandwich complexes onto peptides in the presence of multiple coordinative motifs. Amenable to solid support, a range of N&#8208;terminus and/or lysine conjugated metal&#8208;peptide conjugates were obtained in high purity after cleavage from the resin. The metalated peptides were evaluated for their anticancer properties against human cancer cell lines. While no cytotoxic activity was observed, this platform has the potential to i) provide a pathway to site&#8208;selective peptide labelling, ii) be explored as a biorthogonal handle and/or iii) generate a new strategy for ligand design in transition metal catalysts.

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;H Methylation and Alkylation Reactions by Carbene&#8208;Transfer Reactions</title>

         <dc:description>
C&#8722;H Functionalization: Computational studies on the reaction of 2&#8208;phenyl pyridine with diazoalkanes were used for pre&#8208;evaluation of metal catalysts and diazoalkanes, and suggest rhodium catalysts to be well&#8208;suited for such C&#8722;H functionalization reactions. These findings allowed the rapid identification of suitable reaction conditions for the C&#8722;H functionalization of 2&#8208;phenyl pyridine with TMS diazomethane and donor/acceptor diazoalkanes. Applications in a one&#8208;pot two&#8208;step protocol allow efficient methylation reactions with TMS diazomethane through a C&#8722;H functionalization/desilylation reaction cascade.







Abstract
In this combined computational and experimental study, the C&#8722;H functionalization of 2&#8208;phenyl pyridine with diazoalkanes was investigated. Initial evaluation by computational methods allowed the evaluation of different metal catalysts and diazoalkanes and their compatibility in this C&#8722;H functionalization reaction. With these findings, suitable reaction conditions for the C&#8722;H methylation reactions were quickly identified by using highly reactive TMS diazomethane and C&#8722;H alkylation reactions with donor/acceptor diazoalkanes, which is applied to a broad scope on alkylation reactions of 2&#8208;aryl pyridines with TMS diazomethane and donor/acceptor diazoalkane (51 examples, up to 98&#8201;% yield).

         <title>Structural and Electronic Properties of Boranes Containing Boron&#8208;Chalcogen Multiple Bonds and Stabilized by Amido Imidazoline&#8208;2&#8208;imine Ligands</title>

Electronic effects in the boron&#8208;chalcogen multiple bonds through ligand variation of a series of new chalcogenboranes stabilized by N,N&#8217;&#8208;chelating amido imidazoline&#8208;2&#8208;imine ligands were studied by DFT approach. Electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents and electron delocalization yield the shortest B=X bond lengths and the highest B=X bond orders.







Abstract
The stabilization of elusive monomeric species containing multiple boron&#8208;chalcogen bonds has motivated the investigation of sophisticated ligand systems in the past few years. Recently, a series of neutral, Lewis acid&#8208;free chalcogenboranes were prepared by incorporation of an amido imidazoline&#8208;2&#8208;imine as the supporting ligand (Frank et&#8197;al., Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2021, 60, 4633), resulting in well&#8208;defined molecular entities with pronounced multiple bond character, B=X (X=O, S, Se, Te). In view of the potential use of N&#8208;heterocyclic boranes (NHB=X) as ligands in catalysis and fine chemistry, we evaluated in this work the bonding properties of the new B=X compounds based on a &#960;&#8208;backdonation model. The electronic properties of systems in question were modulated via systematic modifications of the NHB ring with respect to ligand variation, saturation, size, and heteroatom substitutions. Investigations into the B=X bond length and order, calculated by means of density functional theory methods, reveal enhanced B=X bonding properties for NHB rings with high electron delocalization in the NHB ring and bearing electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents; a fact that was also confirmed by computational assessment of electron interactions of the B=X species with a dicarbonyl manganese complex. We expect that the analysis will contribute to the rational optimization of existing ligands as well as the development of new moieties, which would further allow for exploration of new boron chemistry.

Recently, a series of neutral, Lewis acid-free chalcogenboranes were prepared by incorporation of an amido imidazoline-2-imine as the supporting ligand (Frank et&#8197;al.&lt;i&gt;, Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2021, 60, 4633&lt;/i&gt;), resulting in well-defined molecular entities with pronounced multiple bond character, B=X (X=O, S, Se, Te). In view of the potential use of N-heterocyclic boranes (NHB=X) as ligands in catalysis and fine chemistry, we evaluated in this work the bonding properties of the new B=X compounds based on a &#960;-backdonation model. The electronic properties of systems in question were modulated via systematic modifications of the NHB ring with respect to ligand variation, saturation, size, and heteroatom substitutions. Investigations into the B=X bond length and order, calculated by means of density functional theory methods, reveal enhanced B=X bonding properties for NHB rings with high electron delocalization in the NHB ring and bearing electron-withdrawing substituents; a fact that was also confirmed by computational assessment of electron interactions of the B=X species with a dicarbonyl manganese complex. We expect that the analysis will contribute to the rational optimization of existing ligands as well as the development of new moieties, which would further allow for exploration of new boron chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Revisiting the Fundamental Nature of Metal&#8208;Ligand Bonding: An Impartial and Automated Fitting Procedure for Angular Overlap Model Parameters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In Ligand Field Theory, the angular overlap model (AOM) can in principle describe the electron donor/acceptor capabilities of individual ligands. However, its applicability is limited by the nature of the spectroscopic data. We present a computational approach for automated AOM parameter fitting and investigate metal&#8211;halide bonds that had previously been described only heuristically. This approach is applied to a 2D spectrochemical series, for which a linear relationship between AOM parameters and the chemical hardness of the ligands is found.







Abstract
The properties and reactivities of transition metal complexes are often discussed in terms of Ligand Field Theory (LFT), and with ab initio LFT a direct connection to quantum chemical wavefunctions was recently established. The Angular Overlap Model (AOM) is a widely used, ligand&#8208;specific parameterization scheme of the ligand field splitting that has, however, been restricted by the availability and resolution of experimental data. Using ab initio LFT, we present here a generalised, symmetry&#8208;independent and automated fitting procedure for AOM parameters that is even applicable to formally underdetermined or experimentally inaccessible systems. This method allows quantitative evaluations of assumptions commonly made in AOM applications, for example, transferability or the relative magnitudes of AOM parameters, and the response of the ligand field to structural or electronic changes. A two&#8208;dimensional spectrochemical series of tetrahedral halido metalates ([MIIX4]2&#8722;, M=Mn&#8722;Cu) served as a case study. A previously unknown linear relationship between the halide ligands&#8217; chemical hardness and their AOM parameters was found. The impartial and automated procedure for identifying AOM parameters introduced here can be used to systematically improve our understanding of ligand&#8211;metal interactions in coordination complexes.

         <title>Benchmarking of density functionals for the description of optical properties of newly synthesized &#960;&#8208;conjugated TADF blue emitters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Computational modeling of the optical characteristics of organic molecules with potential for thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) may assist markedly the development of more efficient emitting materials for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes. Recent theoretical studies in this area employ mostly methods from density functional theory (DFT). In order to obtain accurate predictions within this approach, the choice of a proper functional is crucial. In the current study, we focus on testing the performance of a set of DFT functionals for estimation of the excitation and emission energy and the excited singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap of three newly synthesized compounds with capacity for TADF. The emitters are designed specifically to enable charge transfer via &#960;&#8208;electron conjugation, at the same time possessing high&#8208;energy excited triplet states. The functionals chosen for testing are from various groups ranging from gradient&#8208;corrected through global hybrids to range&#8208;separated ones. The results show that the monitored optical properties are especially sensitive to how the long&#8208;range part of the exchange energy is treated within the functional. The accurate functional should also be able to provide well balanced distribution of the &#960;&#8208;electrons among the molecular fragments. Global hybrids with moderate (less than 0.4) share of exact exchange (B3LYP, PBE0) and the meta&#8208;GGA HSE06 are outlined as the best performing methods for the systems under study. They are able to predict all important optical parameters correctly, both qualitatively and quantitatively.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning of the C/N ratio of C&#8208;rich graphitic carbon nitride (g&#8208;C3N4) materials by the melamine/carboxylic acid adduct route</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>CC&#8208;rich graphitic carbonitride materials (CNx) with a large range of composition have been prepared thanks to the self&#8208;assembly, in different ratios, of melamine (M) and a panel of polycarboxylic acid (A) such as oxalic, tartaric and citric acid. The thermal conversion of the formed adducts (MAy), led to CNx phases with x ranging from 0.66 to 1.4 (x=1.33 for g&#8208;C3N4  for comparison). The properties of these materials were followed by different techniques (XRD, Raman, TEM, TGA, XPS and DRIFT). It appears that the increase of the C content is associated to a disappearance of the long&#8208;range order of heptazine units and to an increase of the subnanometric carbon&#8211;rich cluster size within the graphitic g&#8208;C3N4  structure. This trend is followed by a significant increase of the interlayer spacing and a lower proportion of the N=C&#8208;N bonds compared to C=C bonds. The thermal stability in inert atmosphere of these phases and their UV&#8208;Visible absorbance properties were also investigated.</dc:description>

         <title>A Modular Synthesis of Substituted Cycloparaphenylenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The key building block of our flexible approach to the modular synthesis of substituted cycloparaphenylenes (CPPs) is in the spotlight. From this stage, the depicted substituted [8]&#8208; and [10]CPPs were synthesised in two more steps, macrocyclization and reductive aromatization. The optoelectronic properties of these nanorings were compared to those of the parent CPPs, as well as the tube&#8208;like solid state structure. More information can be found in the Research Article by H.&#8197;A. Wegner et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202104239).

         <title>Direct Addition of Grignard Reagents to Aliphatic Carboxylic Acids Enabled by Bulky turbo&#8208;Organomagnesium Anilides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Grignard reagents (R&#8208;Mg&#8208;X) are commercial carbon nucleophiles commonly used in organic synthesis, but their stability becomes a limitation for the least&#8208;reactive electrophiles. A bulky magnesium anilide additive (in purple) generates a new organometallic reagent (R&#8722;Mg&#8208;NHAr) in&#8197;situ that boosts the nucleophilicity and selectivity of the organometallic ligand (in green). In the Research Article by A. Mendoza and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202104053), these reagents prove to be instrumental in the direct synthesis of ketones from carboxylic acids, a transformation that was only possible with some organolithium reagents before.

         <title>Evidence for Charge Delocalization in Diazafluorene Ligands Supporting Low&#8208;Valent [Cp*Rh] Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structural and electrochemical data for [Cp*Rh] complexes spanning three oxidation states demonstrate that the 9,9&#8242;&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;4,5&#8208;diazafluorene ligand, a notable but uncommon analogue of 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine, can stabilize electron&#8208;rich species through &#960;&#8208;backbonding and concomitant charge delocalization. This &#8220;fresh light&#8221; on the bonding properties is reflected in the photo of a recent vibrant sunset in the authors&#8217; home city of Lawrence, Kansas. More information can be found in the Research Article by J.&#8197;D. Blakemore et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202103970).

         <title>Bioinspired Transformations Using Strictosidine Aglycones: Divergent Total Syntheses of Monoterpenoid Indole Alkaloids in the Early Stage of Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strictosidine is an important molecule in the biosynthesis of higher plants that gives rise to a great variety of structures. A series of bioinspired transformations that are applied to convert strictosidine aglycones into monoterpenoid indole alkaloids is reported. In this image, the strictosidine aglycon is depicted as a gavel that produces treasure in Japanese folktales to represent the production of various natural products from a single molecule. The natural products produced in this study will be very useful as a library for drug discovery. More information can be found in the Research Article by J. Sakamoto and H. Ishikawa (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202104052).

         <title>Properties of Bromine Fused Salts based on Quaternary Ammonium Molecules and their Relevance for Use in a Hydrogen Bromine Redox Flow Battery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bromine complexing agents (BCA) in aqueous electrolytes for hydrogen bromine flow batteries are used to reduce bromine's vapor pressure, while an insoluble and liquid fused salt is formed. The properties (concentrations, composition, conductivity and viscosity) of this fused salt are investigated in this study systematically ex situ by using 7 BCAs at different state of charge in HBr/Br  2  /H  2  O electrolytes with a theoretical capacity of 179.6 Ah L  &#8208;1  . Bromine is stored in the fused salt at concentrations up to 13.6 M, reaching theoretical volumetrical capacities up to 730 Ah L  &#8208;1  in fused salts. The fused salt consists of a pure, bromine&#8208; and waterfree ionic liquid of organic [BCA]  +  cations and polybromides, and its conductivity bases on a hopping mechanism among the polybromides. Alkyl side chain length of the BCAs and distribution of polybromides influence strongly the conductivity and viscosity of the fused salts. 1&#8208;ethylpyridin&#8208;1&#8208;iumbromide results to be favoured BCA for application.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthetic antibody&#8208;rhamnose cluster conjugates show potent complement&#8208;dependent cell killing by recruiting natural antibodies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are one of the most rapidly growing drug classes used for the treatment of cancer, infectious and autoimmune diseases. Complement&#8208;dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) is one of the effector functions for antibodies to deplete target cells. We report here an efficient chemoenzymatic synthesis of structurally well&#8208;defined conjugates of a monoclonal antibody with a rhamnose&#8208; and an &#945;Gal trisaccharide&#8208;cluster to recruit natural anti&#8208;rhamnose and anti&#8208;&#945;Gal antibodies, respectively, to enhance the CDC&#8208;dependent targeted cell killing. The synthesis was achieved by using a modular antibody Fc&#8208;glycan remodeling method that includes site&#8208;specific chemoenzymatic Fc&#8208;glycan functionalization and subsequent click conjugation of synthetic rhamnose&#8208; and &#945;Gal trisaccharide&#8208;cluster to provide the respective homogeneous antibody conjugates. Cell&#8208;based assays indicated that the antibody&#8208;rhamnose cluster conjugates could mediate potent CDC activity for targeted cancer cell killing and showed much more potent efficacy than the antibody&#8208;&#945;Gal trisaccharide cluster conjugates for CDC effects.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A spin&#8208;selective tribo&#8208;chemical reaction using a dinuclear lanthanide complex is demonstrated for the first time. The dinuclear complex is composed of two Eu  III  ions, hexafluoroacetylacetonato ligands, and anthracene&#8208;based phosphine oxide bridges. Single crystal analysis revealed a face&#8208;to&#8208;face type anthracene dimer structure in the dinuclear Eu  III  complex. Mechanical stimulus on the dinuclear Eu  III  complex induced selective formation of oxidized anthracene. The tribo&#8208;chemical reaction is based on a characteristic energy transfer pathway for the selective formation of an excited triplet state.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereochemical Behavior of Pairs of P&#8208;stereogenic Phosphanyl Groups at the Dimethylxanthene Backbone</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The P&#8208;stereogenic bis(phosphanes) 7 and 9, featuring pairs of P(Mes)&#8208;ethynyl or vinyl substituents at the dimethyl xanthene backbone show rather low barriers of stereochemical inversion at phosphorus. &#960;&#8208;conjugative effects are probably causing these low inversion barriers. Compound 7 reacted with B(C6F5)3 to form the nine&#8208;membered heterocyclic product 10, featuring a [P]&#8208;C&#8801;C&#8208;B(C6F5)3 substituent. Compound 7 was converted to the bis[P(Mes)vinyl] xanthene derivative 9, which gave the zwitterionic P(H)(Mes)&#8208;CH=CH&#8208;B(C6F5)3 containing product 16 upon treatment with B(C6F5)3. Thermally induced epimerization barriers at phosphorus of ca. 20 to 26 kcal mol&#8208;1 were calculated by DFT for the alkenyl&#8208;and alkynyl&#8208;P derived systems 6 to 9, 15 and 16 and experimentally determined for the examples 7 and 16.</dc:description>

Thermally induced epimerization barriers at phosphorus of ca. 20 to 26 kcal mol-1 were calculated by DFT for the alkenyl-and alkynyl-P derived systems 6 to 9, 15 and 16 and experimentally determined for the examples 7 and 16.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

A new strategy of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF)&#8208;sensitized CPL (TSCP) is proposed to realize efficient circularly polarized electroluminescence (CPEL) by taking TADF molecule as sensitizer to improve exciton utilization and CP&#8208;FL molecule as emitter to realize CPEL. In this article, we highlight the research status of CPEL and CP&#8208;TADF, mainly focus on the concept of TSCP and its applications in CP&#8208;OLEDs, and finally give the prospects of TSCP in CPEL research area.







Abstract
A promising strategy of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) sensitized circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) has been proposed for improving the electroluminescence efficiencies of circularly polarized fluorescent emitters. Compared with chiral TADF emitters which suffer from the dilemma of small &#916;EST accompanied by small kr, the TADF&#8208;sensitized CPL (TSCP) strategy using TADF molecules as sensitizers and CP&#8208;FL molecules as emitters might be the most promising method to construct high&#8208;performance circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (CP&#8208;OLEDs). Consequently, by taking advantage of the theoretically 100&#8201;% exciton utilization of TADF sensitizers, especially, by designing CP&#8208;FL emitters with high PLQY, narrow FWHM and large glum values, TSCP&#8208;type CP&#8208;OLEDs with excellent overall performances can be realized.

         <title>A Stereoselective Glycosylation Approach to the Construction of 1,2&#8208;trans&#8208;&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;Glycosidic Linkages and Convergent Synthesis of Saponins</title>

Direct action: A highly stereoselective glycosylation protocol for the synthesis of 1,2&#8208;trans&#8208;&#946;&#8208;d&#8208; or &#945;&#8208;l&#8208;glycosidic linkages is disclosed, which employs a combination of glycosyl N&#8208;phenyltrifluroacetimidates as donors, FeCl3 as promoter, and CH2Cl2/nitrile as solvent and exploits glycosidation via glycosyl &#945;&#8208;nitrilium intermediates. A variety of natural saponins containing (1&#8594;2)&#8208;linked glycan motifs are thus synthesized in convergent manner by direct glycosylation with (1&#8594;2)&#8208;linked glycan donors.







Abstract
Conventional syntheses of 1,2&#8208;trans&#8208;&#946;&#8208;d&#8208; or &#945;&#8208;l&#8208;glycosidic linkages rely mainly on neighboring group participation in the glycosylation reactions. The requirement for a neighboring participation group (NPG) excludes direct glycosylation with (1&#8594;2)&#8208;linked glycan donors, thus only allowing stepwise assembly of glycans and glycoconjugates containing this type of common motif. Here, a robust glycosylation protocol for the synthesis of 1,2&#8208;trans&#8208;&#946;&#8208;d&#8208; or &#945;&#8208;l&#8208;glycosidic linkages without resorting to NPG is disclosed; it employs an optimal combination of glycosyl N&#8208;phenyltrifluroacetimidates as donors, FeCl3 as promoter, and CH2Cl2/nitrile as solvent. A broad substrate scope has been demonstrated by glycosylations with 12 (1&#8594;2)&#8208;linked di&#8208; and trisaccharide donors and 13 alcoholic acceptors including eight complex triterpene derivatives. Most of the glycosylation reactions are high yielding and exclusively 1,2&#8208;trans selective. Ten representative, naturally occurring triterpene saponins were thus synthesized in a convergent manner after deprotection of the coupled glycosides. Intensive mechanistic studies indicated that this glycosylation proceeds by SN2&#8208;type substitution of the glycosyl &#945;&#8208;nitrilium intermediates. Importantly, FeCl3 dissociates and coordinates with nitrile into [Fe(RCN)nCl2]+ and [FeCl4]&#8722;, and the ferric cationic species coordinates with the alcoholic acceptor to provide a protic species that activates the imidate, meanwhile the poor nucleophilicity of [FeCl4]&#8722; ensures an uninterruptive role for the glycosidation.

         <title>Origin of the different reactivity of the high&#8208;valent coinage&#8208;metal complexes [RCuiiiMe3]&#8722; and [RAgiiiMe3]&#8722; (R=allyl)**

Gas&#8208;phase fragmentation experiments reveal a contrasting reactivity of the high&#8208;valent coinage&#8208;metal complexes [RCuiiiMe3]&#8722; and [RAgiiiMe3]&#8722; (R=allyl). Using DFT, coupled&#8208;cluster and multi&#8208;configurational calculations together with kinetic modeling, the reactivity difference is traced back to different C&#8722;C coupling propensities of the two complexes. For [RAgMe3]&#8722;, an outer&#8208;sphere cross&#8208;coupling transition state featuring a large multi&#8208;configurational character plays a key role for the understanding of its reactivity.







Abstract
High&#8208;valent tetraalkylcuprates(iii) and &#8208;argentates(iii) are key intermediates of copper&#8208; and silver&#8208;mediated C&#8722;C coupling reactions. Here, we investigate the previously reported contrasting reactivity of [RMiiiMe3]&#8722; complexes (M=Cu, Ag and R=allyl) with energy&#8208;dependent collision&#8208;induced dissociation experiments, advanced quantum&#8208;chemical calculations and kinetic computations. The gas&#8208;phase fragmentation experiments confirmed the preferred formation of the [RCuMe]&#8722; anion upon collisional activation of the cuprate(iii) species, consistent with a homo&#8208;coupling reaction, whereas the silver analogue primarily yielded [AgMe2]&#8722;, consistent with a cross&#8208;coupling reaction. For both complexes, density functional theory calculations identified one mechanism for homo coupling and four different ones for cross coupling. Of these pathways, an unprecedented concerted outer&#8208;sphere cross coupling is of particular interest, because it can explain the formation of [AgMe2]&#8722; from the argentate(iii) species. Remarkably, the different C&#8722;C coupling propensities of the two [RMiiiMe3]&#8722; complexes become only apparent when properly accounting for the multi&#8208;configurational character of the wave function for the key transition state of [RAgMe3]&#8722;. Backed by the obtained detailed mechanistic insight for the gas&#8208;phase reactions, we propose that the previously observed cross&#8208;coupling reaction of the silver complex in solution proceeds via the outer&#8208;sphere mechanism.

Grey tellurium dissolves under disproportionation in the ionic liquids [P66614][OAc] and [P4444][OAc] at ambient temperatures. The stable red&#8208;purple solutions contain tellurium cations, such as (Te4)2+ and (Te6)4+, and anions (Ten)2&#8722; with chain lengths up to at least n=5, as evidenced by spectroscopic and electrochemical techniques. DFT calculations indicate that electrostatic interactions with the components of the ILs stabilize tellurium cations and anions in solution.







Abstract
Elemental tellurium readily dissolves in ionic liquids (ILs) based on tetraalkylphosphonium cations even at temperatures below 100&#8201;&#176;C. In the case of ILs with acetate, decanoate, or dicyanamide anions, dark red to purple colored solutions form. A study combining NMR, UV&#8208;Vis and Raman spectroscopy revealed the formation of tellurium anions (Ten)2&#8722; with chain lengths up to at least n=5, which are in dynamic equilibrium with each other. Since external influences could be excluded and no evidence of an ionic liquid reaction was found, disproportionation of the tellurium is the only possible dissolution mechanism. Although the spectroscopic detection of tellurium cations in these solutions is difficult, the coexistence of tellurium cations, such as (Te4)2+ and (Te6)4+, and tellurium anions could be proven by cyclic voltammetry and electrodeposition experiments. DFT calculations indicate that electrostatic interactions with the ions of the ILs are sufficient to stabilize both types of tellurium ions in solution.

         <title>Asymmetric Catalytic Assembly of Triple&#8208;Columned and Multilayered Chiral Folding Polymers Showing Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission (AIE)</title>

         <dc:description>
A first asymmetric catalytic approach to multilayer 3D folding polymers by using Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling in the presence of chiral catalysts. The resulting multiple &#960;&#8208;assemblies exhibited remarkable optical properties in aggregated states (photoluminescence in solids and aggregation&#8208;induced emission in solutions), as well as reversible redox properties in electrochemical performance.







Abstract
Unprecedented chiral multilayer folding 3D polymers have been assembled and regulated by uniform and differentiated aromatic chromophore units between naphthyl piers. Screening catalysts, catalytic systems and monomers were proven to be crucial for asymmetric catalytic Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura polycouplings for this assembly. X&#8208;ray crystallography of the corresponding dimers and trimers revealed the absolute configuration and the intermolecular packing pattern. Up to 61&#8201;960 Mw/41&#8201;900 Mn and m/z 4317 for polymers and oligomers, as confirmed by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) and MALDI&#8208;TOF MS, indicated that these frameworks were composed of multiple stacked layers. The resulting multiple &#960;&#8208;assemblies exhibited remarkable optical properties in aggregated states (photoluminescence in solids and aggregation&#8208;induced emission in solutions), as well as reversible redox properties in electrochemical performance.

         <title>Sterically Crowded Tris(2&#8208;(trimethylsilyl)phenyl)phosphine &#8211; Is it Still a Ligand?</title>

P(o&#8208;TMSC6H4)3: A phosphine with selective reactivity. The steric bulk (represented by the security guard) shields the phosphorus from most external influences &#8211; but not from all. Spectroscopy and diffraction reveal the structural diversity of this molecule and its hand picked reaction products.







Abstract
Tris(2&#8208;(trimethylsilyl)phenyl)phosphine, P(o&#8208;TMSC6H4)3, was synthesised and characterised in solution and in the solid state. The large steric bulk prevents most reactions of the phosphorus donor and makes the compound air stable both in the solid state as well as in solution. This shielded phosphine can still undergo three reactions, namely protonation, oxidation to the phosphine oxide under harsh conditions and complexation to AuI, thus forming a complex with linear coordination. Unexpectedly, complexation was unsuccessful with a range of other metal cations. Neither PdII, PtII, ZnII nor HgII reacted and even the remaining coinage metal cations CuI and AgI could not be coordinated. Both the parent molecule as well as the reaction products were structurally characterised by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, and the conformational change of geometry required to accommodate the additional atoms was analysed in detail. Apart from chemical oxidation with H2O2, P(o&#8208;TMSC6H4)3 displays reversible electrochemical oxidation with a potential not unlike the one of sterically unencumbered phosphines for which the oxidation is usually not reversible. P(o&#8208;TMSC6H4)3 can thus be considered a model compound for the investigation of the electronic properties of sterically unencumbered phosphines.

         <title>Carboboration&#8208;Driven Generation of a Silylium Ion for Vinylic C&#8722;F Bond Functionalization by B(C6F5)3 Catalysis</title>

B(C6F5)3&#8208;catalyzed reactions between fluoroalkenes and silyl ketene acetals gave vinylic C&#8722;F bond&#8208;functionalized products under mild and simple conditions. Carboboration reaction of fluoroalkenes generates an oxygen&#8208;stabilized silylium ion to facilitate the C&#8722;F bond cleavage. DFT and IBO studies were performed to clear the reaction mechanism. A comparative study of &#945;&#8208;chloro or bromostyrenes demonstrated that our reaction can be applied only to &#945;&#8208;fluorostyrenes due to the strong silicon&#8208;fluorine affinity.







Abstract
Strong main&#8208;group Lewis acids such as silylium ions are known to effectively promote heterolytic C(sp3)&#8722;F bond cleavage. However, carrying out the C(sp2)&#8722;F bond transformation of vinylic C&#8722;F bonds has remained an unmet challenge. Herein, we describe our development of a new and simple strategy for vinylic C&#8722;F bond transformation of &#945;&#8208;fluorostyrenes with silyl ketene acetals catalyzed by B(C6F5)3 under mild conditions. Our theoretical calculations revealed that a stabilized silylium ion, which is generated from silyl ketene acetals by carboboration, cleaves the C&#8722;F bond of &#945;&#8208;fluorostyrenes. A comparative study of &#945;&#8208;chloro or bromostyrenes demonstrated that our reaction can be applied only to &#945;&#8208;fluorostyrenes because the strong silicon&#8208;fluorine affinity facilitates an intramolecular interaction of silylium ions with fluorine atom to cleave the C&#8722;F bond. A broad range of &#945;&#8208;fluorostyrenes as well as a range of silyl ketene acetals underwent this C&#8722;F bond transformation.

         <title>Regioselective Fluorination of Acenes: Tailoring of Molecular Electronic Levels and Solid&#8208;State Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 7, February 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controlling energy levels: Partial fluorination of tetracenes allows the precise adjustment of the HOMO and LUMO energy levels. By applying regioselective synthetic strategies, such functionalized tetracenes can be obtained, as demonstrated for the unilaterally fluorinated F3TET, F4TET and F5TET. The solid&#8208;state packing and optoelectronic properties of these materials are compared to the properties of their parental acenes.







Abstract
Optoelectronic properties of molecular solids are important for organic electronic devices and are largely determined by the adopted molecular packing motifs. In this study, we analyzed such structure&#8208;property relationships for the partially regioselective fluorinated tetracenes 1,2,12&#8208;trifluorotetracene, 1,2,10,12&#8208;tetrafluorotetracene and 1,2,9,10,11&#8208;pentafluorotetracene that were further compared with tetracene and perfluoro&#8208;tetracene. Quantum chemical DFT calculations in combination with optical absorption spectroscopy data show that the frontier orbital energies are lowered with the degree of fluorination, while their optical gap is barely affected. However, the crystal structure changes from a herringbone packing motif of tetracene towards a planar stacking motif of the fluorinated tetracene derivatives, which is accompanied by the formation of excimers and leads to strongly red&#8208;shifted photoluminescence with larger lifetimes.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Controlling energy levels&lt;/b&gt;: Partial fluorination of tetracenes allows the precise adjustment of the HOMO and LUMO energy levels. By applying regioselective synthetic strategies, such functionalized tetracenes can be obtained, as demonstrated for the unilaterally fluorinated F&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;TET, F&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;TET and F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;TET. The solid-state packing and optoelectronic properties of these materials are compared to the properties of their parental acenes.

         <title>Properties of Single&#8208;Component Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Crystal&#8208;Glass Composites</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 7, February 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new series of single&#8208;component metal&#8211;organic framework crystal&#8208;glass composites (MOF&#8208;CGCs) were produced, where the materials contained a crystalline and glass phase from the same parent zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF): ZIF&#8208;62(Zn). The composites displayed thermal and adsorptive properties present in both the original crystalline and glass materials and interfacial compatibility between the two phases was evident. A mixed&#8208;metal Co/Zn analogue was also produced to further examine phase&#8208;mixing.







Abstract
The formation, and subsequent structural, thermal and adsorptive properties of single&#8208;component metal&#8211;organic framework crystal&#8208;glass composites (MOF&#8208;CGCs) are investigated. A series of novel materials exhibiting chemically identical glassy and crystalline phases within the same material were produced, where crystalline ZIF&#8208;62(Zn) was incorporated within an agZIF&#8208;62(Zn) matrix. X&#8208;ray diffraction showed that the crystalline phase was still present after heating to above the glass transition temperature of agZIF&#8208;62(Zn), and interfacial compatibility between the crystalline and glassy phases was investigated using a mixed&#8208;metal (ZIF&#8208;62(Co))0.5(agZIF&#8208;62(Zn))0.5 analogue. CO2 gas adsorption measurements showed that the CO2 uptakes of the MOF&#8208;CGCs were between those of the crystalline and glassy phases.

         <title>Synthesis of Redox&#8208;Active Photochromic Phenanthrene Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 7, February 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of photochromic phenanthrene derivatives bearing pyridine or pyridinium units have been synthetized and characterized by spectroscopy, electrochemistry and theoretical calculations. It has been demonstrated that the different substitution positions yield to a drastic difference on the photo and electrochromic properties of these systems. These compounds derived from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons compounds show good qualities for the applications in optoelectronic devices, as opto&#8208;transistors or in organic field&#8208;effect transistors.







Abstract
A phenanthrene unit has been functionalized by several methylthiophene units in order to bring it a photochromic behavior. These compounds were characterized by NMR, absorption and emission spectroscopies, theoretical calculations as well as cyclic voltammetry. The association of a phenanthrene group with a photochromic center could open the door to a new generation of organic field&#8208;effect transistors.

         <title>Cu2O/CeO2 Photo&#8208;electrochemical Water Splitting: A Nanocomposite with an Efficient Interfacial Transmission Path under the Co&#8208;action of a p&#8211;n Heterojunction and Micro&#8208;mesocrystals</title>

         <dc:description>
Improving your PECs: A Cu2O/CeO2 composite with a unique structure has been fabricated, in which a p&#8211;n heterojunction and a micro&#8208;mesocrystal (m&#8208;MC) structure work together. Under their synergistic effect, an optimal Cu2O/CeO2 photocathode provides a decisive pathway for the rapid separation and transfer of electron&#8211;holes, thereby facilitating the separation/transfer of carriers. As a result, the optimal Cu2O/CeO2 shows the best photo&#8208;electrochemical (PEC) water splitting performance and excellent stability.







Abstract
Cu2O is an ideal p&#8208;type material for photo&#8208;electrochemical (PEC) hydrogen evolution, although serious electron&#8211;hole recombination and photocorrosion restrict its further improvement for PEC activity. In this work, CeO2 nanoparticles (NPs) self&#8208;assemble on the surface of Cu2O octahedra, thus successfully forming a Cu2O/CeO2 structure in which p&#8211;n heterojunctions and micro&#8208;mesocrystals (m&#8208;MCs) work together. The optimum Cu2O/CeO2 composite, without the use of any cocatalyst, exhibits a fivefold higher photocurrent density (4.63&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 0&#8197;V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode) than that of Cu2O octahedra, which is better than most Cu2O&#8208;based photocathodes without cocatalyst and even comparable with advanced Cu2O&#8208;based photocathodes. The hydrogen production of the optimal Cu2O/CeO2 (Faradaic efficiency of &#8764;100&#8201;%) is 17.5&#8197;times higher than that of pure Cu2O octahedra, and the photocurrent shows almost no decay under the 12&#8197;h stability test. The delicately designed Cu2O/CeO2 structure in this work provides reference and inspiration for the design of cathodes materials.

         <title>Alkynylgold(I) C3&#8208;Chiral Concave Complexes: Aggregation and Luminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 7, February 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alkynylgold(I) C3&#8208;symmetric complexes bearing triphenyl (1) and trialkyl phosphine ligands (2 and 3) were synthesized and studied. In CHCl3/MeOH mixtures 1 and 2 showed an AIE effect at 540&#8197;nm, probably originating from aurophilic interactions. 3 showed AIE only in nearly pure MeOH and in the solid state. The aggregation of optically pure 1 started at lower MeOH content than (&#177;)&#8208;1, indicating that the latter gave racemates rather than conglomerates.







Abstract
Chiral gold(I) acetylide trinuclear complexes 1&#8211;3 based on the cyclotribenzylene platform and terminal PR3 ligands (R=Ph, Et, and Cy, respectively), were characterized and their light emission studied. They exhibited long&#8208;lived blue phosphorescence in CHCl3 and a weak fluorescence in the UV. In MeOH/CHCl3 mixtures of &gt;1:1 volume ratio, 1 and 2 exhibited a new emission band at ca. 540&#8197;nm that developed at the expense of the UV emission. DLS studies demonstrated the presence of molecular aggregates of &#216; 30&#8211;80&#8197;nm. The green emission observed in MeOH&#8208;rich solvent mixtures was therefore induced by aggregation, and could originate from Au&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Au interactions. The AIE spectrum of 3 was observed only in solutions containing 99&#8201;% of MeOH, and correlated with its solid state emission. The AIE profiles of the enantiomers of 1 differed from that of rac&#8208;1, suggesting that the latter is a true racemate.

&lt;p&gt;Chiral gold(I) acetylide trinuclear complexes &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; based on the cyclotribenzylene platform and terminal PR&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ligands (R=Ph, Et, and Cy, respectively), were characterized and their light emission studied. They exhibited long-lived blue phosphorescence in CHCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and a weak fluorescence in the UV. In MeOH/CHCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; mixtures of &amp;gt;1:1 volume ratio, &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; exhibited a new emission band at ca. 540&#8197;nm that developed at the expense of the UV emission. DLS studies demonstrated the presence of molecular aggregates of &#216; 30&#8211;80&#8197;nm. The green emission observed in MeOH-rich solvent mixtures was therefore induced by aggregation, and could originate from Au&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Au interactions. The AIE spectrum of &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; was observed only in solutions containing 99&#8201;% of MeOH, and correlated with its solid state emission. The AIE profiles of the enantiomers of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; differed from that of &lt;i&gt;rac&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;, suggesting that the latter is a true racemate.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

RvD2n&#8208;3 DPA, a specialized pro&#8208;resolving mediator, is synthesized for the first time based on the retrosynthetic outline depicted, enabling its structural elucidation and biological evaluations against S. aureus and zymosan A induced inflammation.







Abstract
Herein we report the first total synthesis of RvD2n&#8208;3 DPA, an endogenously formed mediator biosynthesized from the omega&#8208;3 fatty acid n&#8208;3 docosapentaenoic acid. The key steps are the Midland Alpine borane reduction, Sonogashira cross&#8208;coupling reactions, and a Z&#8208;selective alkyne reduction protocol, yielding RvD2n&#8208;3 DPA methyl ester in 13&#8201;% yield over 12 steps (longest linear sequence). The physical property data (UV chromophore, chromatography and MS/MS fragmentation) of the synthetic lipid mediator matched those obtained from biologically produced material. Moreover, synthetic RvD2n&#8208;3 DPA also carried the potent biological activities of enhancing macrophage uptake of Staphylococcus aureus and zymosan A bioparticles.

         <title>Bonding Character, Electron Delocalization, and Aromaticity of Cyclo[18]Carbon (C18) Precursors, C18&#8208;(CO)n (n=6, 4, and 2): Focusing on the Effect of Carbonyl (&#8208;CO) Groups**

The bonding character, electron delocalization, and aromaticity of C18&#8208;(CO)n (n=6, 4, and 2) were studied by advanced theoretical means. The difference of electron delocalization between two sets of &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems and significant influence of the number of &#8208;CO groups on them were focused on, and the essential reason for the distinct difference in molecular aromaticity was elucidated.







Abstract
The bonding character, electron delocalization, and aromaticity of the cyclo[18]carbon (C18) precursors, C18&#8208;(CO)n (n=6, 4, and 2), have been studied by combining quantum chemical calculations and various electronic wavefunction analyses with different physical bases. It was found that C18&#8208;(CO)n (n=6, 4, and 2) molecules exhibit alternating long and short C&#8722;C bonds, and have out&#8208;of&#8208;plane and in&#8208;plane dual &#960; systems (&#960;out and &#960;in) perpendicular to each other, which are consistent with the relevant characteristics of C18. However, the presence of carbonyl (&#8208;CO) groups significantly reduced the global electron conjugation of C18&#8208;(CO)n (n=6, 4, and 2) compared to C18. Specifically, the &#8208;CO group largely breaks the extensive delocalization of &#960;in system, and the &#960;out system is also affected by it but to a much lesser extent; as a consequence, C18&#8208;(CO)n (n=6, 4, and 2) with larger n shows weaker overall aromaticity. Mostly because of the decreased but still apparent &#960;out electron delocalization in the C18&#8208;(CO)n (n=6, 4, and 2), a notable diatropic induced ring current under the action of external magnetic field is observed, demonstrating the clear aromatic characteristic in the molecules. The correlation between C18&#8208;(CO)n (n=6, 4, and 2) and C18 in terms of the gradual elimination of &#8208;CO from the precursors showed that the direct elimination of two CO molecules in C18&#8208;(CO)n (n=6, 4, and 2) has a synergistic mechanism, but it is kinetically infeasible under normal conditions due to the high energy barrier.

The synthesis and biophysical screening of guanine quadruplex stabilization and binding properties of a family of platinum di&#8208;imine complexes are described. The second&#8208;generation binders display enhanced stabilization and selectivity compared to the parent compound, bearing much promise for the future evolution of this novel platform.







Abstract
The long&#8208;standing history of platinum coordination complexes in nucleic acid recognition attests to the unique suitability of such species for therapeutic applications. Here, we report the synthetic exploration and development of a family of di&#8208;imine ligands, and their platinum(II) complexes, elaborated on a 3&#8208;(2&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;[1,2,4]triazolo[4,3&#8208;a]pyridine platform which, in its unsubstituted form, has recently been shown to display exceptional capabilities for guanine quadruplex (G4) targeting. The identification of facile, high&#8208;yielding synthetic methods for the derivatization of this platform for the incorporation of additional sites of interactions with guanine quadruplex loops and grooves, along with the optimization of platinum(II) complexation methods, are discussed. Gratifyingly, preliminary biophysical screening of this novel family of binders validates all but one family members as robust G4 binders and highlights enhanced selectivity for quadruplex versus duplex DNA compared to the parent compound. These results bear promise for practical developments based on this platform.

         <title>Indoloquinoline Ligands Favor Intercalation at Quadruplex&#8208;Duplex Interfaces</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 7, February 1, 2022. </description>

Quadruplex&#8208;duplex junctions: A quadruplex&#8208;duplex interface outcompetes an exposed 5&#8217;&#8208;outer tetrad of a parallel quadruplex as favored binding site for indoloquinoline ligands. The ligands intercalate between the G&#8208;tetrad and the neighboring Watson&#8208;Crick base pair located at the interface. High&#8208;affinity binding associated with a large exothermicity is driven by maximizing &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking and electrostatic interactions of the positively charged indoloquinoline moiety.







Abstract
Quadruplex&#8208;duplex (Q&#8208;D) junctions are increasingly considered promising targets for medicinal and technological applications. Here, a Q&#8208;D hybrid with a hairpin&#8208;type snapback loop coaxially stacked onto the quadruplex 3&#8217;&#8208;outer tetrad was designed and employed as a target structure for the indoloquinoline ligand SYUIQ&#8208;5. NMR spectral analysis demonstrated high&#8208;affinity binding of the ligand at the quadruplex&#8208;duplex interface with association constants determined by isothermal titration calorimetry of about 107&#8197;M&#8722;1 and large exothermicities &#916;H&#176; of &#8722;14&#8197;kcal/mol in a 120&#8197;mM K+ buffer at 40&#8201;&#176;C. Determination of the ligand&#8208;bound hybrid structure revealed intercalation of SYUIQ&#8208;5 between 3&#8217;&#8208;outer tetrad and the neighboring CG base pair, maximizing &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking as well as electrostatic interactions with guanine carbonyl groups in close vicinity to the positively charged protonated quinoline nitrogen of the tetracyclic indoloquinoline. Exhibiting considerable flexibility, the SYUIQ&#8208;5 sidechain resides in the duplex minor groove. Based on comparative binding studies with the non&#8208;substituted N5&#8208;methylated indoloquinoline cryptolepine, the sidechain is suggested to confer additional affinity and to fix the alignment of the intercalated indoloquinoline aromatic core. However, selectivity for the Q&#8208;D junction mostly relies on the geometry and charge distribution of the indoloquinoline ring system. The presented results are expected to provide valuable guidelines for the design of ligands specifically targeting Q&#8208;D interfaces.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Quadruplex-duplex junctions&lt;/b&gt;: A quadruplex-duplex interface outcompetes an exposed 5&#8217;-outer tetrad of a parallel quadruplex as favored binding site for indoloquinoline ligands. The ligands intercalate between the G-tetrad and the neighboring Watson-Crick base pair located at the interface. High-affinity binding associated with a large exothermicity is driven by maximizing &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking and electrostatic interactions of the positively charged indoloquinoline moiety.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quadruplex-duplex (Q-D) junctions are increasingly considered promising targets for medicinal and technological applications. Here, a Q-D hybrid with a hairpin-type snapback loop coaxially stacked onto the quadruplex 3&#8217;-outer tetrad was designed and employed as a target structure for the indoloquinoline ligand SYUIQ-5. NMR spectral analysis demonstrated high-affinity binding of the ligand at the quadruplex-duplex interface with association constants determined by isothermal titration calorimetry of about 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;M&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and large exothermicities &#916;&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;&#176; of &#8722;14&#8197;kcal/mol in a 120&#8197;mM K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; buffer at 40&#8201;&#176;C. Determination of the ligand-bound hybrid structure revealed intercalation of SYUIQ-5 between 3&#8217;-outer tetrad and the neighboring CG base pair, maximizing &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking as well as electrostatic interactions with guanine carbonyl groups in close vicinity to the positively charged protonated quinoline nitrogen of the tetracyclic indoloquinoline. Exhibiting considerable flexibility, the SYUIQ-5 sidechain resides in the duplex minor groove. Based on comparative binding studies with the non-substituted &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;5-methylated indoloquinoline cryptolepine, the sidechain is suggested to confer additional affinity and to fix the alignment of the intercalated indoloquinoline aromatic core. However, selectivity for the Q-D junction mostly relies on the geometry and charge distribution of the indoloquinoline ring system. The presented results are expected to provide valuable guidelines for the design of ligands specifically targeting Q-D interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>MOF&#8208;Stabilized Perfluorinated Palladium Cages Catalyze the Additive&#8208;Free Aerobic Oxidation of Aliphatic Alcohols to Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 7, February 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorinated pyridine&#8208;Pd2+ coordinate cages have been synthesized and characterized with atomic resolution within the channels of a metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF), and used as catalysts during the aerobic oxidation of aliphatic alcohols to carboxylic acids without any additive. These results illustrate a rare example of stable per&#8208;fluorinated cationic metal complex, with potential implications in the future design of catalytic organometallic complexes.







Abstract
Extremely high electrophilic metal complexes, composed by a metal cation and very electron poor &#963;&#8208;donor ancillary ligands, are expected to be privileged catalysts for oxidation reactions in organic chemistry. However, their low lifetime prevents any use in catalysis. Here we show the synthesis of fluorinated pyridine&#8208;Pd2+ coordinate cages within the channels of an anionic tridimensional metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF), and their use as efficient metal catalysts for the aerobic oxidation of aliphatic alcohols to carboxylic acids without any additive. Mechanistic studies strongly support that the MOF&#8208;stabilized coordination cage with perfluorinated ligands unleashes the full electrophilic potential of Pd2+ to dehydrogenate primary alcohols, without any base, and also to activate O2 for the radical oxidation to the aldehyde intermediate. This study opens the door to design catalytic perfluorinated complexes for challenging organic transformations, where an extremely high electrophilic metal site is required.

         <title>Biodegradation of Herbicides by a Plant Nonheme Iron Dioxygenase: Mechanism and Selectivity of Substrate Analogues</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 7, February 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Density functional theory calculations show how plant enzymes can initiate the biodegradation of herbicide molecules efficiently. However, the reactivity of substituted substrate analogues is slowed down and in some cases encounters a large rebound barrier.







Abstract
Aryloxyalkanoate dioxygenases are unique herbicide biodegrading nonheme iron enzymes found in plants and hence, from environmental and agricultural point of view they are important and valuable. However, they often are substrate specific and little is known on the details of the mechanism and the substrate scope. To this end, we created enzyme models and calculate the mechanism for 2,4&#8208;dichlorophenoxyacetic acid biodegradation and 2&#8208;methyl substituted analogues by density functional theory. The work shows that the substrate binding is tight and positions the aliphatic group close to the metal center to enable a chemoselective reaction mechanism to form the C2&#8208;hydroxy products, whereas the aromatic hydroxylation barriers are well higher in energy. Subsequently, we investigated the metabolism of R&#8208; and S&#8208;methyl substituted inhibitors and show that these do not react as efficiently as 2,4&#8208;dichlorophenoxyacetic acid substrate due to stereochemical clashes in the active site and particularly for the R&#8208;isomer give high rebound barriers.

         <title>Borane Adducts of Aromatic Phosphorus Heterocycles: Synthesis, Crystallographic Characterization and Reactivity of a Phosphinine&#8208;B(C6F5)3 Lewis Pair</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 7, February 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Roll out the barrelene: The synthesis and crystallographic characterization of a phosphinine&#8211;borane adduct has been achieved for the first time. The novel Lewis adduct shows rapid insertion and [4+2] cycloaddition reactivity towards phenylacetylene, whereas a hitherto unknown dihydro&#8208;1&#8208;phosphabarrelene is formed with styrene. Reaction with an ester provides a new, facile and selective route to 1&#8208;R&#8208;phosphininium salts. These subsequently undergo a [4+2] cycloaddition in the presence of alkenes and alkynes to cleanly form unprecedented derivatives of 1&#8208;R&#8208;phosphabarrelenium salts.







Abstract
A phosphinine&#8208;borane adduct of a Me3Si&#8208;functionalized phosphinine and the Lewis acid B(C6F5)3 has been synthesized and characterized crystallographically for the first time. The reaction strongly depends on the nature of the substituents in the &#945;&#8208;position of the phosphorus heterocycle. In contrast, the reaction of B2H6 with various substituted phosphinines leads to an equilibrium between the starting materials and the phosphinine&#8211;borane adducts that is determined by the Lewis basicity of the phosphinine. The novel phosphinine borane adduct (6&#8208;B(C6F5)3) shows rapid and facile insertion and [4+2] cycloaddition reactivity towards phenylacetylene. A hitherto unknown dihydro&#8208;1&#8208;phosphabarrelene is formed with styrene. The reaction with an ester provides a new, facile and selective route to 1&#8208;R&#8208;phosphininium salts. These salts then undergo a [4+2] cycloaddition in the presence of Me3Si&#8722;C&#8801;CH and styrene to cleanly form unprecedented derivatives of 1&#8208;R&#8208;phosphabarrelenium salts.

         <title>Alkaline Stability of Low Oxophilicity Metallopolymer Anion&#8208;Exchange Membranes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 7, February 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metallopolymers can address many of the challenges of anion&#8208;exchange membranes in electrochemical devices, especially those requiring high alkaline stability. Using the same polymer backbone and NHC ligand, membranes are prepared using low oxophilicity metals such as Cu, Zn, Ni and Au, and their relative alkaline stabilities are compared. The Au(III) metallopolymer demonstrates unparalleled alkaline stability and good ion&#8208;conductivity.







Abstract
Anion&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs) are promising energy conversion devices due to their high efficiency. Nonetheless, AEMFC operation time is currently limited by the low chemical stability of their polymeric anion&#8208;exchange membranes. In recent years, metallopolymers, where the metal centers assume the ion transport function, have been proposed as a chemically stable alternative. Here we present a systematic study using a polymer backbone with side&#8208;chain N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands complexed to various metals with low oxophilicity, such as copper, zinc, nickel, and gold. The golden metallopolymer, using the metal with the lowest oxophilicity, demonstrates exceptional alkaline stability, far superior to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art quaternary ammonium cations, as well as good in situ AEMFC results. These results demonstrate that judiciously designed metallopolymers may be superior to purely organic membranes and provides a scientific base for further developments in the field.

Frustrated R&#8208;transfer processes: The catalytic use of bimetallic couples acting in a cooperative way affords novel and efficient chemical transformations. The presence of M&#8722;M&#8217; interactions is a key feature in these processes. We describe here a complete series of complexes containing G10M&#8722;G11M bonds (G10M=Pd, Pt; G11M=Ag, Au) that can be considered as snapshots of transmetallation processes. All together they compose a sort of short movie that allows to rank the progression of such processes depending on of the metals involved.







Abstract
Novel heteropolymetallic architectures have been built by integrating Pd, Au and Ag systems. The dinuclear [(CNC)(PPh3)Pd&#8208;G11M(PPh3)](ClO4) (G11M=Au (3), Ag (4); CNC=2,6&#8208;diphenylpyridinate) and trinuclear [{(CNC)(PPh3)Pd}2G11M](ClO4) (G11M=Au (6), Ag (5)) complexes have been accessed or isolated. Structural and DFT characterization unveil striking interactions of one of the aryl groups of the CNC ligand(s) with the G11M center, suggesting these complexes constitute models of transmetallation processes. Further analyses allow to qualitatively order the degree of transfer, proving that Au promotes the highest one and also that Pd systems favor higher degrees than Pt. Consistently, Energy Decomposition Analysis calculations show that the interaction energies follow the order Pd&#8722;Au &gt; Pt&#8722;Au &gt; Pd&#8722;Ag &gt; Pt&#8722;Ag. All these results offer potentially useful ideas for the design of bimetallic catalytic systems.

         <title>Injectable Micromotor@Hydrogel System for Antibacterial Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 7, February 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An injectable micromotor@hydrogel drug delivery system which can be injected directly into lesions to release micromotors in response to the environment has been developed to reduce external influence on micromotors and improve the sustained&#8208;release effect. Micromotors underwent enhanced diffusion in the surroundings of bacteria without addition of exogenous hydrogen peroxide, which was manifested by their appearance in edge of the inhibition zone. The proposed micromotor@hydrogel drug delivery system offers a new strategy for the treatment of bacterial infections.







Abstract
The drug delivery system based on nano/micromotors has become a research hot spot in recent years. However, naked micromotors may be ruptured or passivated under the complex biological environment, which will result in the leakage of drugs in advance or limited self&#8208;propulsion performance. Herein, an injectable micromotor@hydrogel drug delivery system to protect micromotors from the external environment is proposed. The micromotors were prepared through layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer assembly technology. The asymmetric decomposition of hydrogen peroxide catalyzed by the locally distributed platinum nanoparticles enabled efficient propulsion of the micromotors in low concentration of hydrogen peroxide. In order to protect micromotors, they were loaded into the Schiff base hydrogel. The micromotor@hydrogel system can be injected directly into the lesion to release micromotors in response to the environment, reducing external influence on micromotors and improving the sustained&#8208;release effect. Erythromycin (Ery) loaded into the micromotors and the micromotor@hydrogel system demonstrated excellent antibacterial effect. Micromotors released from the hydrogel underwent enhanced diffusion in the surroundings of bacteria without addition of exogenous hydrogen peroxide, which was manifested by their appearance in edge of the inhibition zone. The proposed micromotor@hydrogel drug delivery system offers a new strategy for the treatment of bacterial infections.

         <title>Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission Leading to White Light Emission in Diphenylbenzofulvene Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 7, February 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Even though the aggregation&#8208;induced emission phenomena have been described for diphenylbenzofulvene derivatives for about 15&#8197;years, their solid&#8208;state emission in films has not been previously studied. Hereby, their solid&#8208;state emission is characterized and the white light emission of a thin film made of mixture of the derivatives DPBFMe and DPMF(Me)2 is deciphered.







Abstract
The search for a unique molecular system able to efficiently emit in the total visible range of the electromagnetic spectra, i.&#8201;e., white light emission (WLE), is a topic of intense research. We here show that aggregates formed by diphenylbenzofulvene (DPBF) derivatives are from two to four orders of magnitude more emissive than their monomers. From a simple strategy, involving structural modification of a DPBF propelled shape core, a close match with the pure white light emission coordinates is obtained with a combination of two derivatives in films, with featured solid&#8208;state emission, without involvement of D&#8722;A groups or energy transfer processes.

         <title>Light&#8208;Assisted Ullmann Coupling of Phenols and Aryl Halides: The Synergetic Effect Between Plasmonic Copper Nanoparticles and Carbon Nanotubes from Various Sources</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 7, February 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, plasmonic copper nanoparticles (Cu NPs) were loaded onto carbon nanotubes (CNTs) from various sources including commercial CNTs and those directly derived from plastic wastes. Under visible&#8208;light irradiation, the synergetic effect between Cu NPs and CNTs could efficiently promote Ullmann coupling of phenols and aryl halides, achieving high yields of diaryl ethers.







Abstract
Utilizing light and plastic wastes as resources to turn the wasted phenols and hazardous aryl halides into value added chemicals seems to be an attractive idea for alleviating the energy crisis and environmental problems. In this work, plasmonic copper nanoparticles (Cu NPs) were loaded onto carbon nanotubes (CNTs) from various sources including commercial CNTs and those derived from plastic wastes. Under visible&#8208;light irradiation, the catalyst could efficiently convert phenols and aryl halides to diaryl ethers. Similar with commercial CNTs, excellent activity is also achieved when utilizing CNTs derived from different kinds of plastic wastes as support for the system. Further investigation shows that the visible&#8208;light irradiation and light&#8208;excited plasmonic Cu NPs are necessary to inhibit the phenol degradation on CNTs and in turn promote the cross&#8208;coupling of phenol and aryl halides. Compared with metal oxides and other carbon materials, the excellent capability of CNTs to absorb light, to convert light to heat, and to adsorb both two reactants simultaneously are critical to enhance the activity of Cu NPs, achieving high yields of diaryl ethers. This study could provide a novel strategy for catalyst design and generate a more economically sustainable process.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 7, February 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chirality patterns are commonly observed in the universe and in nature, particularly at micro&#8208; and macrolevels governing the origin of life on earth. Multilayer folding 3D chirality was discovered as a new addition to the chirality family, which is now achieved at a macromolecular level through asymmetric catalytic polymerization. These polymers show conformational flexibility upon pushing and releasing operations providing a variety of molecular energy levels. Therefore, they can have unique photo and electronic properties and it is anticipated that they will have a great impact on chemistry and materials science in the future. More information can be found in the Research Article by G. Li et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202104102).

Therefore, they can have unique photo and electronic properties and it is anticipated that they will have a great impact on chemistry and materials science in the future.

         <title>Frontispiece: Perfluoroaryl and Perfluoroheteroaryl Reagents as Emerging New Tools for Peptide Synthesis, Modification and Bioconjugation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 7, February 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Perfluorinated aromatics and heteroaromatics are versatile reagents for the modification of amino acids, peptides and proteins. This is principally because they undergo rapid and selective nucleophilic substitution reactions with biological nucleophiles. They are, therefore, exciting tools with which to modulate the biological activities and drug&#8208;like properties of natural and synthetic biomolecules in drug discovery and with which to append, for example, fluorescent probes in chemical biology studies. In this Minireview, Will Brittain and Chris Coxon survey the current field, discussing the synthetic incorporation of perfluoro(hetero)aromatics, the challenges posed by their physical and chemical properties, how these can be overcome, and what the future holds for these important new tools. For more information, see the Minireview on page 10.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 7, February 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy of TADF&#8208;sensitized CPL (TSCP) is proposed to realize efficient circularly polarized electroluminescence (CPEL) by taking TADF molecule as sensitizer to improve exciton utilization and CP&#8208;FL molecule as emitter to realize CPEL. For more information, see the Concept by Li and Chen on page 5.

         <title>Cover Feature: Heteropolymetallic Architectures as Snapshots of Transmetallation Processes at Different Degrees of Transfer (Chem. Eur. J. 7/2022)</title>

         <dc:description>
The catalytic use of metallic couples acting in a cooperative way arises as a powerful tool affording novel and efficient chemical transformations. In this article, a series of complexes containing M&#8722;M&#8242; bonds (M=Pd, Pt; M&#8242;=Ag, Au) is described. They can be regarded as arrested intermediates or snapshots of a transmetallation process that becomes &#8220;frustrated&#8221; given the nature of the &#8220;disputed&#8221; R fragment. Still, some gradation in the transfer can be evaluated depending on the M&#8722;M&#8242; couple, and all together they compose a short movie allowing the progression of such processes to be ranked. More information can be found in the Research Article by M. Baya, A. Mart&#237;n, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202104538).

         <dc:description>
The first crystallographically characterized phosphinine&#8211;borane adduct mimics frustrated Lewis&#8208;pair reactivity. In the presence of alkynes, alkenes and esters, a facile conversion to novel phosphinine&#8208;based species is achieved even at room temperature. Our results provide fascinating new perspectives for the future, particularly with respect to the activation of small molecules. More information can be found in the Research Article by T. B&#246;ttcher, C. M&#252;ller et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202104135).

         <title>Perfluoroaryl and Perfluoroheteroaryl Reagents as Emerging New Tools for Peptide Synthesis, Modification and Bioconjugation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 28, Issue 7, February 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Perfluoroaromatic and perfluoroheteroaromatic reagents have emerged in recent years as powerful reagents for peptide and protein modification. Dominated by their regio&#8208; and chemoselective nucleophilic aromatic substitution chemistry under mild conditions, they have been used in peptide synthesis, tagging, cyclisation, stapling and protein bioconjugation.







Abstract
Peptides and proteins are becoming increasingly valuable as medicines, diagnostic agents and as tools for biomedical sciences. Much of this has been underpinned by the emergence of new methods for the manipulation and augmentation of native biomolecules. Perfluoroaromatic reagents are perhaps one of the most diverse and exciting tools with which to modify peptides and proteins, due principally to their nucleophilic substitution chemistry, high electron deficiency and the ability for their reactivity to be tuned towards specific nucleophiles. As discussed in this minireview, in recent years, perfluoroaromatic reagents have found applications as protecting groups or activating groups in peptide synthesis and as orthogonal handles for peptide modification. Furthermore, they have applications in chemoselective &#8216;tagging&#8217;, stapling and bioconjugation of peptides and proteins, as well as tuning of &#8216;drug&#8208;like&#8217; properties. This review will also explore possible future applications of these reagents in biological chemistry.

&#8220;The resulting multiple &#960;&#8208;assemblies exhibited remarkable optical properties in aggregated states&#8230; as well as reversible redox properties.&#8221; This and more about the story behind the front cover can be found in the article at 10.1002/chem.202104102).







Abstract

         <title>An Incremental System To Predict the Effect of Different London Dispersion Donors in All&#8208;meta&#8208;Substituted Azobenzenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An incremental system for London dispersion has been developed that allows an easy back&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;envelope estimation when systematically altering the London dispersion donors. A simple equation is proposed that nicely reproduces the experimental results within error.







Abstract
Predictive models based on incremental systems exist for many chemical phenomena, thus allowing easy estimates. Despite their low magnitude in isolated systems London dispersion interactions are ubiquitous in manifold situations ranging from solvation to catalysis or in biological systems. Based on our azobenzene system, we systematically determined the London dispersion donor strength of the alkyl substituents Me, Et, iPr up to tBu. Based on this data, we were able to implement an incremental system for London dispersion for the azobenzene scheme. We propose an equation that allows the prediction of the effect of change of substituents on London dispersion interactions in azobenzenes, which has to be validated in similar molecular arrangements in the future.

         <title>Formation of Supramolecular Nanostructures through in Situ Self&#8208;Assembly and Post&#8208;Assembly Modification of a Biocatalytically Constructed Dipeptide Hydrazide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermolysin&#8208;assisted biocatalytic construction of a self&#8208;assembling dipeptide hydrazide from two kinds of non&#8208;self&#8208;assembling amino acid derivatives gives rise to the formation of supramolecular helical architectures under aqueous conditions. In addition, post&#8208;assembly modification based on hydrazone formation allows the in&#8208;situ constructed supramolecular helical architectures to be decorated with tethering hydrazide groups as chemical handles. More information can be found in the Research Article by M. Ikeda et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202104421).

         <title>Regulating Interfacial Lithium Ion by Artificial Protective Overlayers for High&#8208;Performance Lithium Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fabricating artificial protective overlayer with tunable surficial properties on lithium metal is a precise and effective strategy to relieve nonuniform lithium ion flux and sluggish lithium ion transportation at the anode surface. This Concept article introduces the key advancement of artificial protective overlayers for high&#8208;performance lithium metal anodes.







Abstract
The main limitation of lithium (Li) metal anodes lies in their severe dendrite growth due to nonuniform Li+ flux and sluggish Li+ transportation at the anode surface. Fabricating artificial protective overlayer with tunable surficial properties on Li metal is a precise and effective strategy to relieve this problem. In this Concept article, we focus on the basic principles of regulating interfacial Li+ through artificial protective overlayers and summarize the material preparation as well as structural design of these overlayers. The remaining challenges and promising directions of artificial protective overlayers are then highlighted to provide clues for the practical application of Li metal anodes.

         <title>Functionalized Graphene Quantum Dots Modified Dioxin&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks for Superior Lithium Storage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Functionalized graphene quantum dots (GQDs) modified dioxin&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COF) are fabricated and applied as anode material of lithium&#8208;ion battery for the first time. The modification of carboxyl GQDs leads to more active sites, fast lithium&#8208;ion transportation kinetics, and enhanced electronic conductivity, resulting in enhanced lithium&#8208;storage properties for the graphene quantum dots modified covalent organic frameworks (COF&#8208;GQDs) electrode







Abstract
Covalent organic framework, as an emerging porous nano&#8208;frame structure with pre&#8208;designed structure and custom properties, has been demonstrated as a prospective electrode for rechargeable Li&#8208;ion batteries. For improving the reversible capacity and long&#8208;term cycle stability of COF materials, we propose a GQDs modified COF material (COF&#8208;GQDs) and apply it as the anode for LIBs for the first time. This COF&#8208;GQDs electrode delivers enhanced long&#8208;term cycling performance with a large capacity of &#8764;820&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 300 cycles at 100&#8197;mA&#8201;g&#8722;1 and an improved rate performance. The enhanced lithium&#8208;storage performance, in terms of obvious&#8208;shortened activation process and high reversible capacities, can be attributed to the modification of carboxyl GQDs, which would activate more active sites (activated C=C groups from benzene rings) for lithium&#8208;storage, and provide fast lithium&#8208;ion transportation kinetic. Besides, the decreased interphase resistance, enhanced electronic conductivity, and prevented aggregation of needle&#8208;flake COF structure, originated from the addition of GQDs, which lead to the enhanced improved cycling stability of the COF&#8208;GQDs electrode. This manuscript can promote the further exploration on the design of COF&#8208;related materials with modification of functionalized carbonaceous materials to achieve enhanced lithium&#8208;storage properties for next&#8208;generation energy storage.

         <title>A Rare Alder&#8208;ene Cycloisomerization of 1,6&#8208;Allenynes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel Alder&#8208;ene reaction: Thermally induced intramolecular Alder&#8208;ene reactions of 1,6&#8208;allenynes gives &#945;&#8208;methylene&#8208;&#947;&#8208;lactams via a mechanism distinct from previous [2+2] cycloisomerization manifolds of related skeletons. The mechanism involves an unusual transfer of the allene&#8208;hydrogen and is supported by computational and deuterium labelling studies. The reaction is favoured by the electron&#8208;deficient nature of the propiolamide moiety and the absence of substituents on the termini of both the allene &#8220;ene&#8221; moiety and the alkyne of the 1,6&#8208;allenyne.







Abstract
Thermally induced cycloisomerization reactions of 1,6&#8208;allenynes gives &#945;&#8208;methylene&#8208;&#947;&#8208;lactams via intramolecular Alder&#8208;ene reactions. The mechanism is supported by computational and deuterium labelling studies. This thermal, non&#8208;radical method enables the discovery of a hitherto unknown route that proceeds via a divergent mechanism distinct from the previous [2+2] cycloisomerization manifold.

         <title>Developing the Low&#8208;Temperature Oxidation Mechanism of Cyclopentane: An Experimental and Theoretical Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly oxygenated intermediates play an important role in the low&#8208;temperature oxidation of fuels. In this study, a molecular beam sampling vacuum ultraviolet photoionization time&#8208;of&#8208;flight mass spectrometer (MB&#8208;VUV&#8208;PI&#8208;TOFMS) is used to observe the low&#8208;temperature oxidation products, especially highly oxygenated intermediates like ketohydroperoxide (KHP), keto&#8208;dihydroperoxide (KDHP), olefinic hydroperoxides (OHP) and dione structure products. More information can be found in the Full Paper by S. Chen, J. Chen, Z. Tang, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202103546).

         <title>Revisiting the Fundamental Nature of Metal&#8208;Ligand Bonding: An Impartial and Automated Fitting Procedure for Angular Overlap Model Parameters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Our work on ligand field theory&#8212;an automated fitting procedure for Angular Overlap Model (AOM) parameters&#8212;is reflected by Van Gogh's Field with Irises near Arles. We showcase the capabilities of this procedure with a two&#8208;dimensional spectrochemical series with the metals manganese, iron, cobalt, nickel and copper and the halides fluoride, chloride, bromide and iodide. The perspective in van Gogh's field resembles a correlation we found between the halide ligands&#8217; AOM parameters and their chemical hardness.

         <title>In&#8208;situ synthesis of the thinnest In2Se3/In2S3/In2Se3 sandwich&#8208;like heterojunction for photoelectrocatalytic water splitting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The efficient utilization of solar energy for photoelectrocatalytic (PEC) water splitting is a feasible solution for developing clean energy and alleviating environmental issues. However, as the core of PEC technology, the existing photoanode catalysts have disadvantages such as poor photoelectrocatalytic conversion efficiency, low conductivity of photogenerated carriers, and instability. Here, we report the ultrathin two&#8208;dimensional sandwich&#8208;like heterojunction of In 2  Se 3  /In 2  S 3  /In 2  Se 3  (SW In 2  S 3  @In 2  Se 3  ) for the first time for PEC water splitting. Our findings identify the efficient separation of electrons and holes by constructing SW In 2  S 3  @In 2  Se 3  heterojunction. The in&#8208;situ synthesis of ultrathin nanosheet arrays by using surface substitution of Se atom to epitaxially grow cell In 2  Se 3  maximizes the contact area of heterogeneous interface and accelerates the transmission of charge carrier. Benefitting from the unique structure and composition characteristic, SW In 2  S 3  @In 2  Se 3  displays excellent performance in PEC water splitting. The photocurrent density of SW In 2  S 3  @In 2  Se 3  reaches 8.43 mA cm &#8722;2  at 1.23 V RHE  . Compared with In 2  S 3  , the SW In 2  S 3  @In 2  Se 3  photoanode has nearly 12 times higher PEC performance, which represents the best performance among the In 2  S 3  &#8208;based photoanode heterojunction reported so far. The evolution rate of O 2  reaches 78.8 &#956;mol cm &#8208;2  h &#8208;1  , and the photocurrent has no apparent variety within 24 hours.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanistic Insight into Hydroboration of Imines from Combined Computational and Experimental Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Detailed DFT calculations and experiments were performed to study the hydroboration mechanisms of two different kinds of imines. Our results revealed that BArF3&#8208;catalyzed imine hydroboration proceeds through a BArF3&#8208;promoted hydride transfer pathway. The catalyst&#8208;free imine hydroboration is difficult to occur under the previously reported conditions (room temperature) according to our studies, and a BH3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;SMe2&#8208;catalyzed hydroboration reaction of imines was established. For the later hydroboration reaction, a hydroboration/B&#8722;H/B&#8722;N &#963;&#8208;bond metathesis pathway is preferred from our results.







Abstract
Boron Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed and catalyst&#8208;free hydroboration reactions of imines are attractive due to the mild reaction conditions. In this work, the mechanistic details of the hydroboration reactions of two different kinds of imines with pinacolborane (HBpin) are investigated by combining density functional theory calculations and some experimental studies. For the hydroboration reaction of N&#8208;(&#945;&#8208;methylbenzylidene)aniline catalyzed by tris[3,5&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]borane (BArF3), our calculations show that the reaction proceeds through a boron Lewis acid&#8208;promoted hydride transfer mechanism rather than the classical Lewis acid activation mechanism. For the catalyst&#8208; and solvent&#8208;free hydroboration reaction of imine, N&#8208;benzylideneaniline, our calculations and experimental studies indicate that this reaction is difficult to occur under the reaction conditions reported previously. With a combination of computational and experimental studies, we have established that the commercially available BH3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;SMe2 can serve as an efficient catalyst for the hydroboration reactions of N&#8208;benzylideneaniline and similar imines. The hydroboration reactions catalyzed by BH3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;SMe2 are most likely to proceed through a hydroboration/B&#8722;H/B&#8722;N &#963;&#8208;bond metathesis pathway, which is very different from that of the reaction catalyzed by BArF3.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Detailed DFT calculations and experiments&lt;/b&gt; were performed to study the hydroboration mechanisms of two different kinds of imines. Our results revealed that BAr&lt;sup&gt;F&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-catalyzed imine hydroboration proceeds through a BAr&lt;sup&gt;F&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-promoted hydride transfer pathway. The catalyst-free imine hydroboration is difficult to occur under the previously reported conditions (room temperature) according to our studies, and a BH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;SMe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-catalyzed hydroboration reaction of imines was established. For the later hydroboration reaction, a hydroboration/B&#8722;H/B&#8722;N &#963;-bond metathesis pathway is preferred from our results.

Keeping it simple: Minimalist photo&#8208;reactive probes, consisting of a photo&#8208;reactive group and a tag for the detection of target proteins, are useful tools in chemical biology. We have synthesized minimalist probes based on 2&#8208;thienyl&#8208;substituted &#945;&#8208;ketoamide by introducing an alkyne group into the thiophene ring. The position of the alkyne moiety significantly influences the reactivity.







Abstract
Minimalist photo&#8208;reactive probes, which consist of a photo&#8208;reactive group and a tag for detection of target proteins, are useful tools in chemical biology. Although several diazirine&#8208;based and aryl azide&#8208;based minimalist probes are available, no keto&#8208;based minimalist probe has yet been reported. Here we describe minimalist probes based on a 2&#8208;thienyl&#8208;substituted &#945;&#8208;ketoamide bearing an alkyne group on the thiophene ring. The 3&#8208;alkyne probe showed the highest photo&#8208;affinity labeling efficiency.

         <title>Structural Insights into Pixatimod (PG545) Inhibition of Heparanase, a Key Enzyme in Cancer and Viral Infections</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pixatimod (PG545), a drug candidate, is a potent inhibitor of heparanase. Conformational analysis by NMR spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulations revealed a flexible reducing end residue in a skew boat&#8208;like conformation. Docking and molecular dynamics simulations of PG545 with heparanase show that PG545 can block the active site by binding in different conformations, with the cholestanol sidechain making important hydrophobic interactions.







Abstract
Pixatimod (PG545), a heparan sulfate (HS) mimetic and anticancer agent currently in clinical trials, is a potent inhibitor of heparanase. Heparanase is an endo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;glucuronidase that degrades HS in the extracellular matrix and basement membranes and is implicated in numerous pathological processes such as cancer and viral infections, including SARS&#8722;CoV&#8208;2. To understand how PG545 interacts with heparanase, we firstly carried out a conformational analysis through a combination of NMR experiments and molecular modelling which showed that the reducing end &#946;&#8208;D&#8208;glucose residue of PG545 adopts a distorted conformation. This was followed by docking and molecular dynamics simulations to study the interactions of PG545 with heparanase, revealing that PG545 is able to block the active site by binding in different conformations, with the cholestanol side&#8208;chain making important hydrophobic interactions. While PG545 blocks its natural substrate HS from binding to the active site, small synthetic heparanase substrates are only partially excluded, and thus pentasaccharide or larger substrates are preferred for assaying this class of inhibitor. This study provides new insights for the design of next&#8208;generation heparanase inhibitors and substrates.

         <title>Synthesis of Polyoxygenated Tropolones and their Antiviral Activity against Hepatitis B Virus and Herpes Simplex Virus&#8208;1</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy is described for the generation of polyoxygenated tropolones by using an intermolecular oxidopyrylium cycloaddition/ring&#8208;opening strategy and complementary benzyl alcohol incorporation steps. The antiviral activity of these molecules was assessed against the pathogenic viruses hepatitis B virus and herpes simplex virus&#8208;1, providing new structure&#8211;function insight.







Abstract
Polyoxygenated tropolones possess a broad range of biological activity, and as a result are promising lead structures or fragments for drug development. However, structure&#8211;function studies and subsequent optimization have been challenging, in part due to the limited number of readily available tropolones and the obstacles to their synthesis. Oxidopyrylium [5+2] cycloaddition can effectively generate a diverse array of seven&#8208;membered ring carbocycles, and as a result can provide a highly general strategy for tropolone synthesis. Here, we describe the use of 3&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;4&#8208;pyrone&#8208;based oxidopyrylium cycloaddition chemistry in the synthesis of functionalized 3,7&#8208;dimethoxytropolones, 3,7&#8208;dihydroxytropolones, and isomeric 3&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;7&#8208;methoxytropolones through complementary benzyl alcohol&#8208;incorporating procedures. The antiviral activity of these molecules against herpes simplex virus&#8208;1 and hepatitis B virus is also described, highlighting the value of this approach and providing new structure&#8211;function insights relevant to their antiviral activity.

         <title>C(spn)&#8722;X (n=1&#8211;3) Bond Activation by Palladium</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Less is more! Our quantum chemical analyses reveal that the activity of palladium catalysts towards C&#8722;X bond activation increases along ethane, ethylene, acetylene because the steric repulsion between catalyst and substrate is relieved as the number of substituents around the carbon atom goes down.







Abstract
We have studied the palladium&#8208;mediated activation of C(spn)&#8722;X bonds (n = 1&#8211;3 and X = H, CH3, Cl) in archetypal model substrates H3C&#8722;CH2&#8722;X, H2C=CH&#8722;X and HC&#8801;C&#8722;X by catalysts PdLn with Ln = no ligand, Cl&#8722;, and (PH3)2, using relativistic density functional theory at ZORA&#8208;BLYP/TZ2P. The oxidative addition barrier decreases along this series, even though the strength of the bonds increases going from C(sp3)&#8722;X, to C(sp2)&#8722;X, to C(sp)&#8722;X. Activation strain and matching energy decomposition analyses reveal that the decreased oxidative addition barrier going from sp3, to sp2, to sp, originates from a reduction in the destabilizing steric (Pauli) repulsion between catalyst and substrate. This is the direct consequence of the decreasing coordination number of the carbon atom in C(spn)&#8722;X, which goes from four, to three, to two along this series. The associated net stabilization of the catalyst&#8211;substrate interaction dominates the trend in strain energy which indeed becomes more destabilizing along this same series as the bond becomes stronger from C(sp3)&#8722;X to C(sp)&#8722;X.

&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, to &lt;i&gt;sp&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, to &lt;i&gt;sp&lt;/i&gt;, originates from a reduction in the destabilizing steric (Pauli) repulsion between catalyst and substrate. This is the direct consequence of the decreasing coordination number of the carbon atom in C(&lt;i&gt;sp&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;X, which goes from four, to three, to two along this series. The associated net stabilization of the catalyst&#8211;substrate interaction dominates the trend in strain energy which indeed becomes more destabilizing along this same series as the bond becomes stronger from C(&lt;i&gt;sp&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;X to C(&lt;i&gt;sp&lt;/i&gt;)&#8722;X.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Highly selective lysine acylation in proteins using a Lys&#8208;His tag sequence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemical modification of proteins has numerous applications, but it has been challenging to achieve the required high degree of selectivity on lysine amino groups. Recently, we described the highly selective acylation of proteins with an N&#8208;terminal Gly&#8208;His 6 segment. This tag promoted acylation of the N&#8208;terminal N &#945; &#8208;amine resulting in stable conjugates. Here, we report the peptide sequences His n &#8208;Lys&#8208;His m , which we term Lys&#8208;His tags. In combination with simple acylating agents, they facilitate the acylation of the designated Lys N &#949; &#8208;amine under mild conditions and with high selectivity over native Lys residues. We show that the Lys&#8208;His tags, which are 7 to 10 amino acids in length and still act as conventional His tags, can be inserted in proteins at the C&#8208;terminus or in loops, thus providing high flexibility regarding the site of modification. Finally, the selective and efficient acylation of the therapeutic antibody Rituximab, pure or mixed with other proteins, demonstrates the scope of the Lys&#8208;His tag acylation method.</dc:description>

         <title>Visible&#8208;light switching of metallosupramolecular assemblies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A photoswitchable ligand and palladium(II) ions form a dynamic mixture of self&#8208;assembled metallosupramolecular structures. The photoswitching ligand is an ortho&#8208;fluoroazobenzene with appended pyridyl groups. Combining the  E  &#8208;isomer with palladium(II) salts affords a double&#8208;walled triangle with composition [Pd  3  L  6  ]  6+  and a distorted tetrahedron [Pd  4  L  8  ]  8+  (1:2 ratio at 298 K). Irradiation with 410&#160;nm light generates a photostationary state with ~80% of the  E&#8208;  isomer of the ligand and results in the selective disassembly of the tetrahedron, the more thermodynamically stable structure, and the formation of the triangle, the more kinetically inert product. The triangle is then slowly transformed back into the tetrahedron over 2 days at 333 K. The  Z  &#8208;isomer of the ligand does not form any well&#8208;defined structures and has a thermal half&#8208;life of 25 days at 298K. This approach shows how a thermodynamically preferred self&#8208;assembled structure can be reversibly pumped to a kinetic trap by small perturbations of the isomer distribution using non&#8208;destructive visible light.</dc:description>

         <title>Decisive Role of Spin&#8208;States and Spin&#8208;Coupling in Dictating Selective O2 Adsorption in Chromium(II) MOF</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Coordinatively unsaturated Chromium (II)&#8208;based Cr  3  [(Cr  4  Cl)  3  (BTT)  8  ]  2  (Cr&#8208;BTT; BTT  3&#8208;  =1,3,5&#8208;benzenetristetrazolate) metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) has been shown to exhibit exceptional selectivity towards adsorption of O  2  over N  2  /H  2  . Using periodic Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations, we attempt to decipher the origin of this puzzling selectivity. By computing and analyzing the magnetic exchange coupling, binding energies, the partial density of states (pDOS), and adsorption isotherms for the pristine and gas bound MOFs [(Cr  4  (X)  4  Cl)  3  (BTT)  8  ]  3&#8208;  (X=O  2  , N  2  , and H  2  ), we unequivocally establish the role of spin&#8208;states and spin&#8208;coupling in controlling the gas selectivity. The computed geometries and gas adsorption isotherms are consistent with the earlier experiments. The O  2  binding to the MOF follows an electron&#8208;transfer mechanism resulting in a Cr(III) superoxo species (O  2  &#8208;&#8226;  ) with a very strong antiferromagnetic coupling between the two centers, while N  2  /H  2  found to weakly interact with the metal centre and hence only slightly perturb the associated coupling constants. Although the gas bound and unbound MOFs have S =0 ground state (GS), the nature of spin configurations and the associated magnetic exchanges are dramatically different. The binding energy and the number of oxygen molecules that can favorably bind to the Cr center were found to vary with respect to the spin&#8208;state with a significant energy margin (47.6 kJ/mol). This study offers a hitherto unknown strategy of utilizing spin&#8208;state/spin&#8208;couplings to control gas adsorption selectivity in MOFs.</dc:description>

         <title>Substituent Effects of Tetracoordinate Boron in Organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Promotion by substituents: Tetracoordinate boryl groups stabilize or activate reactive intermediates, such as cations, radicals and &#960;&#8208;conjugation systems, as electron&#8208;donating groups. This review mainly focuses on reactions promoted by such substituent effects of tetracoordinate boryl groups in organic synthesis.







Abstract
The present review focuses on recent examples of tetracoordinate boryl groups greatly influencing reactions in organic synthesis. Electron&#8208;rich tetracoordinate boryl groups stabilize or activate reactive intermediates such as cations, radicals and &#960;&#8208;conjugation systems, and interaction of the intermediates with carbon&#8208;boron or heteroatom&#8208;boron bonds is the origin of such substituent effects. Unique substituent effects of tetracoordinate boryl groups often promote desired reactions and affect results of reactions such as yield and selectivity of products.

         <dc:description>
This Review discusses the recent developments in the synthesis and applications of visible light&#8208;driven molecular switches and motors and provides a perspective on their future challenges and opportunities.







Abstract
Inspired by human vision, a diverse range of light&#8208;driven molecular switches and motors have been developed for fundamental understanding and application in material science and biology. Recently, the design and synthesis of visible light&#8208;driven molecular switches and motors have been actively pursued. This emerging trend is partly motivated to avoid the harmful effects of ultraviolet light, which was necessary to drive the classical molecular switches and motors at least in one direction, impeding their employment in biomedical and photopharmacology applications. Moreover, visible light&#8208;driven molecular switches and motors are demonstrated to enable benign optical materials for advanced photonic devices. Therefore, during the past several years, visible light&#8208;driven molecular switches based on azobenzene derivatives, diarylethenes, 1,2&#8208;dicyanodithienylethenes, hemithioindigo derivatives, iminothioindoxyls, donor&#8208;acceptor Stenhouse adducts, and overcrowded alkene based molecular motors have been judiciously designed, synthesized, and used in the development of functional materials and systems for a wide range of applications. In this Review, we present the recent developments toward the design of visible light&#8208;driven molecular switches and motors, with their applications in the fabrication of functional materials and systems in material science, bioscience, pharmacology, etc. The visible light&#8208;driven molecular switches and motors realized so far undoubtedly widen the scope of these interesting compounds for technological and biological applications. We hope this Review article could provide additional impetus and inspire further research interests for future exploration of visible light&#8208;driven advanced materials, systems, and devices.

         <title>211At and 125I&#8208;Labeling of (Hetero)Aryliodonium Ylides: Astatine Wins Again</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The nucleophilic 211At&#8208;labeling of aryliodonium ylides was investigated and proved significantly more efficient than radioiodination. Reaction is rapid at room temperature with electron&#8208;poor activated substrates whereas heating and addition of the radical scavenger TEMPO was essential in the case of deactivated precursors to reach high RCY and molar activity.







Abstract
Despite the growing interest in radioiodine and 211At&#8208;labeled radiopharmaceuticals, the search for radiolabeling reactions has been somewhat neglected, resulting in a limited number of available radiosynthetic strategies. Herein we report a comparative study of nucleophilic 125I and 211At&#8208;labeling of aryliodonium ylides. Whereas radioiodination efficiency was low, 211At&#8208;labeling performed efficiently on a broad scope of precursors. The most activated aryliodonium ylides led rapidly to quantitative reactions at room temperature in acetonitrile. For deactivated precursors, heating up to 90&#8201;&#176;C in glyme and addition of 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidine&#8208;1&#8208;oxyl (TEMPO) as radical scavenger appeared essential to avoid precursor degradation and to achieve high radiochemical yields and molar activity. The approach was applied successfully to the preparation of 4&#8208;[211At]astatophenylalanine (4&#8208;APA), an amino acid derivative increasingly studied as radiotherapeutic drug for cancers. This validated aryliodonium ylides as a valuable tool for nucleophilic 211At&#8208;labeling and will complement the short but now growing list of available astatination reactions.

         <title>Cationic Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Decarbonylative Aryl Addition of Aromatic Aldehydes to Bicyclic Alkenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Building bridges: We have developed an unprecedented asymmetric decarbonylative aryl addition of an aromatic aldehyde to bicyclic alkenes, catalyzed by chiral cationic iridium. This process provides efficient access to a wide variety of enantioenriched bridged bicyclic systems from aromatic aldehydes in high yields and with excellent enantioselectivities (up to 90&#8201;% yield and up to 99&#8201;%&#8201;ee).







Abstract
We report an unprecedented catalytic protocol for the enantioselective decarbonylative transformation of aryl aldehydes. In this process, the decarbonylation of aldehydes catalyzed by chiral iridium complexes enabled the formation of asymmetric C&#8722;C bonds through the formation of an aryl&#8722;iridium intermediate. The decarbonylative aryl addition to bicyclic alkenes was fluidly performed without a stoichiometric aryl&#8722;metal reagent, such as aryl boronic acid, with a cationic iridium complex generated in&#8197;situ from Ir(cod)2(BArF4) and the sulfur&#8208;linked bis(phosphoramidite) ligand ((R,R)&#8208;S&#8722;Me&#8722;BIPAM). This reaction has broad functional group compatibility, and no waste is generated, except carbon monoxide.

         <title>Hydrazone Photoswitches for Structural Modulation of Short Peptides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Development of new photoswitches that can modulate biomolecules has been of consistent interest. Herein, it is shown that installation of amide substituents at different position(s) of hydrazone photoswitches does not cause a significant change in E/Z photoswitching behaviors. It is also demonstrated that a hydrazone switch comprising an upper phenyl ring and a lower quinolinyl ring is effective for structural control of short peptides.







Abstract
Molecules that undergo light&#8208;driven structural transformations constitute the core components in photoswitchable molecular systems and materials. Among various families of photoswitches, photochromic hydrazones have recently emerged as a novel class of photoswitches with superb properties, such as high photochemical conversion, spectral tunability, thermal stability, and fatigue resistance. Hydrazone photoswitches have been adopted in various adaptive materials at different length scales, however, their utilization for modulating biomolecules still has not been explored. Herein, we present new hydrazone switches that can photomodulate the structures of short peptides. Systematic investigation on a set of hydrazone derivatives revealed that installation of the amide group does not significantly alter the photoswitching behaviors. Importantly, a hydrazone switch comprising an upper phenyl ring and a lower quinolinyl ring was effective for structural control of peptides. We anticipate that this work, as a new milestone in the research of hydrazone switches, will open a new avenue for structural and functional control of biomolecules.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Cascade C&#8722;H Functionalization/Asymmetric Allylation Reaction of Aryl &#945;&#8208;Diazoamides and Allenes: Lewis Acid Makes a Difference</title>

         <dc:description>
An achiral Lewis acid enables chiral palladium complex&#8208;catalyzed cascade C&#8722;H functionalization/asymmetric allylation reaction of aryl &#945;&#8208;diazoamides and allenes to give synthetically useful chiral 3,3&#8208;disubstituted oxindole derivatives in enhanced yield and enantioselectivity (up to 93&#8201;% ee).







Abstract
A Pd&#8208;catalyzed cascade C&#8722;H functionalization/asymmetric allylation reaction with aryl &#945;&#8208;diazoamides and allenes has been developed. The reaction provides an efficient approach to construct chiral 3,3&#8208;disubstituted oxindole derivatives in high levels of yield and enantioselectivity (up to 93&#8201;% ee). Notably, the chromium complex works as Lewis acid to facilitate the formation of palladium carbene and to enhance acidity of carboxylic acid, allowing for higher stereochemical control and efficiency.

         <title>Continuous Flow Bioconjugations of NIR&#8208;AZA Fluorophores via Strained Alkyne Cycloadditions with Intra&#8208;Chip Fluorogenic Monitoring**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Continuous in&#8208;flow fluorogenic bioconjugations are achievable in five minutes under mild conditions with real&#8208;time intra&#8208;chip reaction progress monitoring. The use of a fluorogenic tetrazine fluorophore, in a glass channelled reactor chip, allowed for intra&#8208;chip reaction monitoring by recording fluorescence intensities at various positions throughout the chip. As the inverse electron demand Diels&#8208;Alder reactions proceeded through the chip, the fluorescence intensity increased accordingly in real&#8208;time.







Abstract
The importance of bioconjugation reactions continues to grow for cell specific targeting and dual therapeutic plus diagnostic medical applications. This necessitates the development of new bioconjugation chemistries, in&#8208;flow synthetic and analytical methods. With this goal, continuous flow bioconjugations were readily achieved with short residence times for strained alkyne substituted carbohydrate and therapeutic peptide biomolecules in reaction with azide and tetrazine substituted fluorophores. The strained alkyne substrates included substituted 2&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;&#945;&#8208;D&#8208;glucopyranose, and the linear and cyclic peptide sequences QIRQQPRDPPTETLELEVSPDPAS&#8208;OH and c(RGDfK) respectively. The catalyst and reagent&#8208;free inverse electron demand tetrazine cycloadditions proved more favourable than the azide 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloadditions. Reaction completion was achieved with residence times of 5&#8197;min at 40&#8201;&#176;C for tetrazine versus 10&#8197;min at 80&#8201;&#176;C for azide cycloadditions. The use of a fluorogenic tetrazine fluorophore, in a glass channelled reactor chip, allowed for intra&#8208;chip reaction monitoring by recording fluorescence intensities at various positions throughout the chip. As the Diels&#8208;Alder reactions proceeded through the chip, the fluorescence intensity increased accordingly in real&#8208;time. The application of continuous flow fluorogenic bioconjugations could offer an efficient translational access to theranostic agents.

The application of continuous flow fluorogenic bioconjugations could offer an efficient translational access to theranostic agents.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis of Natural Products by C&#8211;H Functionalization of Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Total synthesis is considered by many as the finest combination of art and science. During the last decades, several concepts were proposed for achieving the perfect vision of total synthesis, such as atom economy, step economy, or redox economy. In this context, C&#8211;H functionalization represents the most powerful platform that has emerged in the last years, empowering rapid synthesis of complex natural products and enabling diversification of bioactive scaffolds based on natural product architectures. In this review, we present an overview of the recent strategies towards the total synthesis of heterocyclic natural products enabled by C&#8211;H functionalization. Heterocycles represent the most common motifs in drug discovery and marketed drugs. The implementation of C&#8211;H functionalization of heterocycles enables novel tactics in the construction of core architectures, but also changes the logic design of retrosynthetic strategies and permits access to natural product scaffolds with novel and enhanced biological activities.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catalytic stereoselective additions with maleimides are useful one&#8208;step reactions to yield chiral succinimides, molecules that are widespread among therapeutically active compounds but challenging to prepare when the maleimide is C&#8208;substituted. We present the tripeptide H&#8208;Pro&#8208;Pro&#8208;Asp&#8208;NHC12H25 as a catalyst for conjugate addition reactions between aldehydes and Csubstituted maleimides to form succinimides with three contiguous stereogenic centers in high yields and stereoselectivities. The peptidic catalyst is so chemoselective that no protecting group is needed at the imide nitrogen of the maleimides. Derivatization of the succinimides was straightforward and provided access to chiral pyrrolidines, lactones, and lactams. Kinetic studies, including a Hammett plot, provided detailed insight into the reaction mechanism.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of arylboron reagents in metal&#8208;catalyzed domino addition&#8208;cyclization reactions is a well&#8208;established strategy for the preparation of diverse carbo&#8208; and heterocyclic products. Recent studies have demonstrated nickel catalysis is highly effective in these reactions, in many cases offering unique reactivity and access to products that might otherwise not be readily available using other metal catalysts. This review gives an overview of nickel&#8208;catalyzed arylative cyclizations of alkyne&#8208; and allene&#8208;tethered electrophiles using arylboron reagents.







Abstract
The use of arylboron reagents in metal&#8208;catalyzed domino addition&#8211;cyclization reactions is a well&#8208;established strategy for the preparation of diverse, highly functionalized carbo&#8208; and heterocyclic products. Although rhodium&#8208; and palladium&#8208;based catalysts have been commonly used for these reactions, more recent work has demonstrated nickel catalysis is also highly effective, in many cases offering unique reactivity and access to products that might otherwise not be readily available. This review gives an overview of nickel&#8208;catalyzed arylative cyclizations of alkyne&#8208; and allene&#8208;tethered electrophiles using arylboron reagents. The scope of the reactions is discussed in detail, and general mechanistic concepts underpinning the processes are described.

         <title>Assessing Alkali&#8208;Metal Effects in the Structures and Reactivity of Mixed&#8208;Ligand Alkyl/Alkoxide Alkali&#8208;Metal Magnesiates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis and isolation of several new mixed alkyl/alkoxide alkali&#8208;metal magnesiates have allowed for assessing their stability in solution and their reactivity towards Mg&#8722;Br exchange using 2&#8208;bromoanisole as a model substrate. Revealing a pronounced alkali&#8208;metal effect, potassium magnesiates are more powerful exchange reagents although the constitution of the final products in these reactions is strongly dependent on the nature of the alkoxide employed.







Abstract
Advancing the understanding of using alkali&#8208;metal alkoxides as additives to organomagnesium reagents in Mg&#8722;Br exchange reactions, a homologous series of mixed&#8208;ligand alkyl/alkoxide alkali&#8208;metal magnesiates [MMg(CH2SiMe3)2(dmem)]2 [dmem=2&#8208;{[2&#8208;(dimethylamino)ethyl]methylamino} ethoxide; M=Li, 1; Na, 2; (THF)K, 3] has been prepared. Structural and spectroscopic studies have established the constitutions of these heteroleptic/heterometallic species, which are retained in arene solution. Evaluation of their reactivity towards 2&#8208;bromoanisole has uncovered a marked alkali&#8208;metal effect with potassium magnesiate 3 being the most efficient of the three ate reagents. Studies probing the constitution of the exchange product from this reaction suggest that the putative [KMgAr2(dmem)]2 (Ar=o&#8208;OMe&#8722;C6H4) intermediate undergoes redistribution into its single metal components [KAr]n and [MgAr(dmem)]2 (5). This process can be circumvented by using a different potassium alkoxide containing an aliphatic chain such as KOR&#8217; (R&#8217;=2&#8208;ethylhexyl) which undergoes co&#8208;complexation with Mg(CH2SiMe3) to give [KMg(CH2SiMe3)2(OR&#8217;)]2 (7). This ate, in turn, reacts quantitatively with 2&#8208;bromoanisole furnishing [KMgAr2(OR&#8217;)]2 (9) which is stable in solution as a bimetallic compound. Collectively this work highlights the complexity of these alkali&#8208;metal mediated Mg&#8722;Br exchange reactions, where each reaction component can have a profound effect not only on the success of the reaction; but also the stability of the final metalated intermediates prior to their electrophilic interception.

         <title>Combined in Silico and in Vitro Approaches To Uncover the Oxidation and Schiff Base Reaction of Baicalein as an Inhibitor of Amyloid Protein Aggregation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The oxidation of baicalein and subsequent Schiff base reaction with pentylamine (lysine side&#8208;chain model) have been assessed by computational and experimental approaches. The reaction proceeds through initial ion pair formation followed by a redox chain reaction. The atomistic mechanistic findings (transient intermediates) can be used in drug design campaigns against amyloidogenesis.







Abstract
The oxidized form of baicalein (BA) leads to covalent binding with human amyloid proteins. Such adducts hamper the aggregation and deposition of fibrils. A novel reaction of BA with pentylamine (PA) as a model for the lysine side chain is described. This is the first study addressing the atomistic details of a Schiff base reaction with the trihydroxylated moiety of BA. Nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectrometry approaches clearly indicate the formation of dehydrobaicalein in solution as well as its condensation with PA under aerobic conditions, yielding regioselectively C6&#8208;substituted products. The combined results suggest initial ion pair formation between BA and PA, followed by a redox chain reaction: the initiation by oxygen/air; an o&#8208;quinone&#8208;based chain involving oxidation and reduction steps; and extra off&#8208;chain formation of a doubly oxidized product. These mechanistic details support the anti&#8208;amyloid activity of BA and endorse its trihydroxyphenyl moiety as a pharmacophore for drug&#8208;design studies.

         <title>Weak Antiferromagnetic Exchange and Ferromagnetic Alignment of FeII (S=2) Spins in Differently Charged {HAT&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;(FeIICl2)3}n (n=2&#8208; and 3&#8208;) Assemblies of Hexaazatriphenylenes (HAT)</title>

Hexaazatrianthracene (HATA) and hexaazatriphenylene&#8208;hexacarbonitrile {HAT(CN)6} ligands form coordination complexes with high&#8208;spin (S=2) FeII atoms in dianion and radical&#8208;trianion states. This provides weak antiferromagnetic exchange or ferromagnetic alignment of the FeII spins within the coordination assemblies.







Abstract
Hexaazatrianthracene (HATA) and hexaazatriphenylenehexacarbonitrile {HAT(CN)6} are reduced by metallic iron in the presence of crystal violet (CV+)(Cl&#8722;). Anionic ligands are produced, which simultaneously coordinate three FeIICl2 to form (CV+)2{HATA&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;(FeIICl2)3}2&#8722;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;3&#8197;C6H4Cl2 (1) and (CV+)3{HAT(CN)6. (FeIICl2)3}3&#8722;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;0.5CVCl&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2.5&#8197;C6H4Cl2 (2). High&#8208;spin (S=2) FeII atoms in both structures are arranged in equilateral triangles at a distance of 7&#8197;&#197;. An antiferromagnetic exchange is observed between FeII in {HATA&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;(FeIICl2)3}2&#8722; (1) with a Weiss temperature (&#920;) of &#8722;80&#8197;K, the PHI estimated exchange interaction (J) is &#8722;4.7&#8197;cm&#8722;1. The {HAT(CN)6&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;(FeIICl2)3}3&#8722; assembly is obtained in 2. The formation of HAT(CN)6.3&#8722; is supported by the appearance of an intense EPR signal with g=2.0037. The magnetic behavior of 2 is described by a strong antiferromagnetic coupling between the FeII and HAT(CN)6.3&#8722; spins with J1=&#8722;164&#8197;cm&#8722;1 (&#8722;2&#8197;J formalism) and by a weaker antiferromagnetic coupling between the FeII spins with J2=&#8722;15.4&#8197;cm&#8722;1. The stronger coupling results in the spins of the three FeIICl2 units to be aligned parallel to each other in the assembly. As a result, an increase of the &#967;MT values is observed with the decrease of temperature from 9.82 at 300&#8197;K up to 15.06&#8197;emu&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;K/mol at 6&#8197;K, and the Weiss temperature is also positive being at +23&#8197;K. Thus, a change in the charge and spin state of the HAT&#8208;type ligand to &#8901;3&#8722; results in ferromagnetic alignment of the FeII spins, yielding a high&#8208;spin (S=11/2) system. DFT calculations showed that, due to the high symmetry and nearly degenerated LUMO of both HATA and HAT(CN)6, their complexes with FeIICl2 have a variety of closely lying excited high&#8208;spin states with multiplicity up to S=15/2.

         <title>Metal Complexes of singly, doubly and triply linked Porphyrins and Corroles: An Insight into the Physicochemical Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal complexes of multi&#8208;porphyrins and multi&#8208;corroles are unique systems that display a host of extremely interesting properties. Availability of free  meso  and b positions allow formation of different types of directly linked bis&#8208;porphyrins giving rise to intriguing optical and electronic properties. While the fields of metalloporphyrin and corroles monomer have seen exponential growth in the last decades, the chemistry of metal complexes of bis&#8208;porphyrins and bis&#8208;corroles remain rather underexplored. Therefore, the impact of covalent linkages on the optical, electronic, (spectro)electrochemical, magnetic and electrocatalytic activities of metal complexes of bis&#8208;porphyrins and &#8208;corroles has been summarized in this review article. This article shows that despite the (still) somewhat difficult synthetic access to these molecules, their extremely exciting properties do make a strong case for pursuing research on these classes of compounds.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chirality is an important concept in chemistry revealing intriguing optical properties such as circular dichroism (CD), circularly polarized luminescence (CPL), etc. As one of the noncentrosymmmetric (NCS) classes, chiral materials with extended structures may exhibit unique nonlinear optical (NLO) properties, i.e., second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG). In this Concept article, a series of recently discovered NCS coordination polymers (CPs) by using carefully designed chiral organic ligands are reviewed. Combining several metal cations such as lanthanides, lead, zinc, and cadmium with rigid chiral ligands have resulted in interesting CPs with both polar and nonpolar structures. Detailed structures, SHG properties, and structure&#8208;property relationships are provided. The importance of hyperpolarizability formed by intermolecular hydrogen boding interactions to SHG is emphasized.</dc:description>

         <title>Influence of the Flexibility of Nickel PCP&#8208;Pincer Complexes on C&#8722;H and P&#8722;C Bond Activation and Ethylene Reactivity: A Combined Experimental and Theoretical Investigation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A combined experimental/theoretical study of Ni pincer complexes with a bridgehead pyrimidine&#8208;based NHC and arylphosphino side arms revealed unique features about stepwise C&#8722;H activation, ethylene insertion into the Ni&#8722;H bond of an isolated complex followed by ethyl migration with C&#8722;CNHC coupling, and an unprecedented C&#8722;P bond activation affording through PPh2 migration a NiII complex with a terminal phosphanido ligand and a new C&#8722;CNHC&#8722;P pincer ligand.







Abstract
Using a pincer platform based on a bridgehead NHC donor with functional side arms, the combined effect of increased flexibility in six&#8208;membered pyrimidine&#8208;type heterocycles compared to the more often studied five&#8208;membered imidazole, and rigidity of phosphane side arms was examined. The unique features observed include: 1) the reaction of the azolium Csp2&#8722;H bond with [Ni(cod)2] affording a carbanionic ligand in [NiCl(PCsp3HP)] (8) rather than a carbene; 2) its transformation into the NHC, hydrido complex [NiH(PCNHCP)]PF6 (9) upon halide abstraction; 3) ethylene insertion into the Ni&#8722;H bond of the latter and ethyl migration to the N&#8722;C&#8722;N carbon atom of the heterocycle in [Ni(PCEtP)]PF6 (10); and 4) an unprecedented C&#8722;P bond activation transforming the P&#8722;CNHC&#8722;P pincer ligand of 8 in a C&#8722;CNHC&#8722;P pincer and a terminal phosphanido ligand in [Ni(PPh2)(CCNHCP)] (15). The data are supported by nine crystal structure determinations and theoretical calculations provided insights into the mechanisms of these transformations, which are relevant to stoichiometric and catalytic steps of general interest.

&lt;sup&gt;H&lt;/sup&gt;P)] (&lt;b&gt;8&lt;/b&gt;) rather than a carbene; 2) its transformation into the NHC, hydrido complex [NiH(PC&lt;sup&gt;NHC&lt;/sup&gt;P)]PF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;9&lt;/b&gt;) upon halide abstraction; 3) ethylene insertion into the Ni&#8722;H bond of the latter and ethyl migration to the N&#8722;&lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;&#8722;N carbon atom of the heterocycle in [Ni(PC&lt;sup&gt;Et&lt;/sup&gt;P)]PF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;10&lt;/b&gt;); and 4) an unprecedented C&#8722;P bond activation transforming the P&#8722;C&lt;sup&gt;NHC&lt;/sup&gt;&#8722;P pincer ligand of &lt;b&gt;8&lt;/b&gt; in a C&#8722;C&lt;sup&gt;NHC&lt;/sup&gt;&#8722;P pincer and a terminal phosphanido ligand in [Ni(PPh&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)(CC&lt;sup&gt;NHC&lt;/sup&gt;P)] (&lt;b&gt;15&lt;/b&gt;). The data are supported by nine crystal structure determinations and theoretical calculations provided insights into the mechanisms of these transformations, which are relevant to stoichiometric and catalytic steps of general interest.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Selective Encapsulation and Unusual Stabilization of cis&#8208;Isomers by a Spherical Polyaromatic Cavity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thanks to a polyaromatic capsule, an azobenzene derivative is quantitatively encapsulated by the spherical cavity with 100&#8201;% cis&#8208;selectivity. The cis&#8208;to&#8208;trans isomerization is suppressed against heat and light due to the confined cavity effect. C,N&#8208;diphenyl imines are also encapsulated by the capsule and adopt an otherwise unstable cis&#8208;form. The cavity suppresses their hydrolysis in water due to the shielding effect.







Abstract
To explore new cavity functions, we herein employed cis&#8208;trans stereoisomers with a N=N, C=C, or C=N unit as guest indicators for a polyaromatic capsule. Thanks to the rigid, spherical cavity with a diameter of &#8764;1&#8197;nm, azobenzene and stilbene derivatives are quantitatively encapsulated by the capsule with 100&#8201;% cis&#8208;selectivity in water. The isomerization of the cis&#8208;azo compound is suppressed against heat and light in the cavity, due to the confinement effect. Furthermore, C,N&#8208;diphenyl imine derivatives are quantitatively encapsulated by the capsule in water and adopt an otherwise unstable cis&#8208;form. The polyaromatic cavity suppresses the hydrolysis of the imines in water, even at elevated temperature, due to the shielding effect. Accordingly, the properties of the cis&#8208;trans isomers could be largely altered through supramolecular manipulation.

         <title>Rearrangements in Scholl Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review portrays rearrangements with substrates of various genres in Scholl reaction. The rearranged products formed due to automerization, migration of substituents, rearrangement accompanied by cyclization, ring expansion, and ring contraction under Scholl&#8208;type reactions are gathered. In cases where new ring is constructed, they are grouped based on ring size. The crucial factors that drive rearrangements via enigmatic intermediates and the methods for successful prevention of rearrangements are also discussed.







Abstract
Rearrangements in Scholl reaction are mostly serendipitous. The design of molecular precursors is what seems to guide the course of rearrangement. This review consolidates different classes of precursors used in Scholl reaction and their accompanying rearrangements that include aryl migration, migration followed by cyclization and skeletal rearrangements involving ring expansion, ring contraction and both, under the reaction conditions. The attempt in collating heretofore&#8208;reported examples in this review is to guide designing appropriate precursors to predictably achieve complex molecular structures or nanographenes or defect&#8208;nanographenes via rearrangement.

Abstract
Temperature monitoring in&#8197;vivo plays a vital role in the investigation of biological processes of organisms and the improvement of disease theranostic methods. The development of lanthanide luminescent nanocomposite&#8208;derived temperature probes in&#8197;vivo allows accurate and reliable interrogation of biological thermodynamic processes due to their superior photostability, high sensitivity, and non&#8208;invasive sensing fashion. This concept presented an overview of the recent development of lanthanide luminescent nanocomposite which are suitable for in&#8197;vivo temperature monitoring, including the thermometric principles, key features, materials designs as well as their potential biomedical applications for non&#8208;invasive temperature detection in the living body. The perspectives of these lanthanide luminescent nanocomposite thermometers for the optimization of temperature monitoring performance and potential future development are also discussed.

         <title>Properties of the Reactants and Their Interactions within and with the Enzyme Binding Cavity Determine Reaction Selectivities. The Case of Fe(II)/2&#8208;Oxoglutarate Dependent Enzymes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fe(II)/2&#8208;oxoglutarate dependent dioxygenases catalyse with high specificity a variety of oxidative transformations of their substrates. This review provides a survey of computational and experimental studies revealing structural and electronic factors responsible for a broad scope of chemistry performed by this class of enzymes. These factors encompass inherent properties of ferryl species and organic substrates, steric hindrance imposed by the enzyme, specific enzyme&#8208;substrate interactions and substrate's conformational freedom within the binding cavity.







Abstract
Fe(II)/2&#8208;oxoglutarate dependent dioxygenases (ODDs) share a double stranded beta helix (DSBH) fold and utilise a common reactive intermediate, ferryl species, to catalyse oxidative transformations of substrates. Despite the structural similarities, ODDs accept a variety of substrates and facilitate a wide range of reactions, that is hydroxylations, desaturations, (oxa)cyclisations and ring rearrangements. In this review we present and discuss the factors contributing to the observed (regio)selectivities of ODDs. They span from inherent properties of the reactants, that is, substrate molecule and iron cofactor, to the interactions between the substrate and the enzyme's binding cavity; the latter can counterbalance the effect of the former. Based on results of both experimental and computational studies dedicated to ODDs, we also line out the properties of the reactants which promote reaction outcomes other than the &#8220;default&#8221; hydroxylation. It turns out that the reaction selectivity depends on a delicate balance of interactions between the components of the investigated system.

         <title>Developing the Low&#8208;Temperature Oxidation Mechanism of Cyclopentane: An Experimental and Theoretical Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A homemade MB&#8208;VUV&#8208;PI&#8208;TOFMS is used to observe the low&#8208;temperature oxidation products of cyclopentane, including cyclic olefins, cyclic ethers, and highly oxygenated intermediates (ketohydroperoxide KHP, keto&#8208;dihydroperoxide KDHP), at a total pressure of 1&#8211;3&#8197;atm and a low temperature range between 500 and 800&#8197;K. The low&#8208;temperature oxidation mechanism of CPT was studied by experimental and theoretical analyses.







Abstract
At present, the reactivity of cyclic alkanes is estimated by comparison with acyclic hydrocarbons. Due to the difference in the structure of cycloalkanes and acycloalkanes, the thermodynamic data obtained by analogy are not applicable. In this study, a molecular beam sampling vacuum ultraviolet photoionization time&#8208;of&#8208;flight mass spectrometer (MB&#8208;VUV&#8208;PI&#8208;TOFMS) was applied to study the low&#8208;temperature oxidation of cyclopentane (CPT) at a total pressure range from 1&#8211;3&#8197;atm and low&#8208;temperature range between 500 and 800&#8197;K. Low&#8208;temperature reaction products including cyclic olefins, cyclic ethers, and highly oxygenated intermediates (e.&#8201;g., ketohydroperoxide KHP, keto&#8208;dihydroperoxide KDHP, olefinic hydroperoxides OHP and ketone structure products) were observed. Further investigation of the oxidation of CPT &#8211; electronic structure calculations &#8211; were carried out at the UCCSD(T)&#8208;F12a/aug&#8208;cc&#8208;pVDZ//B3LYP/6&#8208;31+ G(d,p) level to explore the reactivity of O2 molecules adding sequentially to cyclopentyl radicals. Experimental and theoretical observations showed that the dominant product channel in the reaction of CPT radicals with O2 is HO2 elimination yielding cyclopentene. The pathways of second and third O2 addition &#8211; the dissociation of hydroperoxide &#8211; were further confirmed.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A homemade MB-VUV-PI-TOFMS&lt;/b&gt; is used to observe the low-temperature oxidation products of cyclopentane, including cyclic olefins, cyclic ethers, and highly oxygenated intermediates (ketohydroperoxide KHP, keto-dihydroperoxide KDHP), at a total pressure of 1&#8211;3&#8197;atm and a low temperature range between 500 and 800&#8197;K. The low-temperature oxidation mechanism of CPT was studied by experimental and theoretical analyses.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At present, the reactivity of cyclic alkanes is estimated by comparison with acyclic hydrocarbons. Due to the difference in the structure of cycloalkanes and acycloalkanes, the thermodynamic data obtained by analogy are not applicable. In this study, a molecular beam sampling vacuum ultraviolet photoionization time-of-flight mass spectrometer (MB-VUV-PI-TOFMS) was applied to study the low-temperature oxidation of cyclopentane (CPT) at a total pressure range from 1&#8211;3&#8197;atm and low-temperature range between 500 and 800&#8197;K. Low-temperature reaction products including cyclic olefins, cyclic ethers, and highly oxygenated intermediates (e.&#8201;g., ketohydroperoxide KHP, keto-dihydroperoxide KDHP, olefinic hydroperoxides OHP and ketone structure products) were observed. Further investigation of the oxidation of CPT &#8211; electronic structure calculations &#8211; were carried out at the UCCSD(T)-F12a/aug-cc-pVDZ//B3LYP/6-31+ G(d,p) level to explore the reactivity of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecules adding sequentially to cyclopentyl radicals. Experimental and theoretical observations showed that the dominant product channel in the reaction of CPT radicals with O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is HO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; elimination yielding cyclopentene. The pathways of second and third O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; addition &#8211; the dissociation of hydroperoxide &#8211; were further confirmed. The results of this study will develop the low-temperature oxidation mechanism of CPT, which can be used for future research on accurately simulating the combustion process of CPT.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Modular Synthesis of Substituted Cycloparaphenylenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new synthesis provides access to different sized substituted cycloparaphenylenes (CPPs). The use of a key synthon in a sequence of macrocyclization by cross&#8208;coupling with different reaction partners followed by aromatization allows a modular build&#8208;up. The controlled introduction of substituents enables a tube&#8208;like arrangement of these molecular carbon allotropes in the solid state.







Abstract
Herein, we report a modular synthesis providing access to substituted cycloparaphenylenes (CPPs) of different sizes. A key synthon introducing two geminal ester units was efficiently prepared by [2+2+2] cycloaddition. This building block can be conveniently converted to macrocyclic precursors controlling the ring size of the final CPP. Efficient reductive aromatization through single&#8208;electron transfer provided the substituted nanohoops in a straightforward manner. The tBu ester substitution pattern enables a tube&#8208;like arrangement in the solid&#8208;state governed by van der Waals interactions that exhibits one of the tightest packings of CPPs in tube direction, thus opening new avenues in the crystal design of CPPs.

         <title>Evidence for Charge Delocalization in Diazafluorene Ligands Supporting Low&#8208;Valent [Cp*Rh] Complexes**
</title>

         <dc:description>
4,5&#8208;Diazafluorene&#8208;based ligands are notable analogues of the workhorse 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridyls, but little is known about their ability to stabilize reduced organometallic complexes. Here, synthetic, structural, and electrochemical studies of [Cp*Rh] complexes bearing 9,9&#8242;&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;4,5&#8208;diazafluorene (Me2daf) and related analogues have been used to show that Me2daf can stabilize electron&#8208;rich species through &#960;&#8208;backbonding and concomitant charge delocalization. In light of this, Me2daf can be concluded to be a promising building block for applications in reductive chemistry and catalysis.







Abstract
Ligands based upon the 4,5&#8208;diazafluorene core are an important class of emerging ligands in organometallic chemistry, but the structure and electronic properties of these ligands have received less attention than they deserve. Here, we show that 9,9&#8242;&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;4,5&#8208;diazafluorene (Me2daf) can stabilize low&#8208;valent complexes through charge delocalization into its conjugated &#960;&#8208;system. Using a new platform of [Cp*Rh] complexes with three accessible formal oxidation states (+III, +II, and +I), we show that the methylation in Me2daf is protective, blocking Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;base chemistry commonly encountered with other daf&#8208;based ligands. Electronic absorption spectroscopy and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis of a family of eleven new compounds, including the unusual Cp*Rh(Me2daf), reveal features consistent with charge delocalization driven by &#960;&#8208;backbonding into the LUMO of Me2daf, reminiscent of behavior displayed by the workhorse 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridyl ligand. Taken together with spectrochemical data demonstrating clean conversion between oxidation states, our findings show that 9,9&#8242;&#8208;dialkylated daf&#8208;type ligands are promising building blocks for applications in reductive chemistry and catalysis.

         <dc:description>The total enantioselective synthesis of (+)&#8208;eucophylline  1  was achieved using as a key&#8208;structural motif a chiral piperidinone bearing the natural product all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenter.

Co&#8208; or Ni&#8208;boride reduction of the nitrile functional group along with the cyclopropane and cyclobutane ring&#8208;opening then led to the formation of the chiral piperidinone ring. Further elaboration of the latter into the key 1&#8208;azabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane motif followed by its coupling with a 2&#8208;cyanoaniline allowed the formation of the tetrahydrobenzo[  b  ][1,8]&#8208;naphthyridine skeleton of  1  , which was finally accessible in 17 steps and 5.9% overall yield from 1,1&#8208;dibromobutene.</dc:description>

         <title>Tetra&#8208;Substituted p&#8208;Tert&#8208;Butylcalix[4]Arene with Phosphoryl and Salicylamide Functional Groups: Synthesis, Complexation and Selective Extraction of f&#8208;Element Cations</title>

         <dc:description>
The tetra&#8208;substituted bifunctional calixarene ligand H2L is an effective extraction agent for selective removal of uranyl salts from aqueous rare&#8208;earth containing solutions. As the separation factor &#223;U/Ln is &#8764;100 in a weakly acidic pH range, a complete separation of uranyl from aqueous trivalent lanthanide solutions is expected to be achieved with few separation steps. The separation factors at pH&#8197;6.0 are 121 (UO22+/La3+) and 70 (UO22+/Yb3+)!







Abstract
A new series of lanthanide (1&#8211;5) and uranyl (6) complexes with a tetra&#8208;substituted bifunctional calixarene ligand H2L is described. The coordination environment for the Ln3+ and UO22+ ions is provided by phosphoryl and salicylamide functional groups appended to the lower rim of the p&#8208;tert&#8208;butylcalix[4]arene scaffold. Ligand interactions with lanthanide cations (light: La3+, Pr3+; intermediate: Eu3+ and Gd3+; and heavy: Yb3+), as well as the uranyl cation (UO22+) is examined in the solution and solid state, respectively with spectrophotometric titration and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffractometry. The ligand is fully deprotonated in the complexation of trivalent lanthanide ions forming di&#8208;cationic complexes 2&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8197;M&#8201;:&#8201;L, [Ln2(L)2(H2O)]2+ (1&#8211;5), in solution, whereas uranyl formed a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8197;M&#8201;:&#8201;L complex [UO2(L)(MeOH)]&#8734; (6) that demonstrated very limited solubility in 12 organic solvents. Solvent extraction behaviour is examined for cation selectivity and extraction efficiency. H2L was found to be an effective extracting agent for UO22+ over La3+ and Yb3+ cations. The separation factors at pH&#8197;6.0 are: &#946;UO

         <dc:description>
The compound Li5SnP3 completes for x=0 the series Li10+4xSn2&#8722;xP6 (x=0&#8211;1) of lithium&#8208;ion conducting phosphidostannates. The thorough investigation of the crystal structure as well as the materials properties applying X&#8208;ray diffraction as well as NMR and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy allows for a detailed comparison of the materials structure&#8208;property relationships, and thus, improves the understanding of the conduction mechanism within solid ion conductors.







Abstract
The targeted search for suitable solid&#8208;state ionic conductors requires a certain understanding of the conduction mechanism and the correlation of the structures and the resulting properties of the material. Thus, the investigation of various ionic conductors with respect to their structural composition is crucial for the design of next&#8208;generation materials as demanded. We report here on Li5SnP3 which completes with x=0 the series Li10+4xSn2&#8722;xP6 of the fast lithium&#8208;ion conductors &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;Li8SnP4 (x=0.5) and Li14SnP6 (x=1). Synthesis, crystal structure determination by single&#8208;crystal and powder X&#8208;ray diffraction methods, as well as 6Li, 31P and 119Sn MAS NMR and temperature&#8208;dependent 7Li NMR spectroscopy together with electrochemical impedance studies are reported. The correlation between the ionic conductivity and the occupation of octahedral and tetrahedral sites in a close&#8208;packed array of P atoms in the series of compounds is discussed. We conclude from this series that in order to receive fast ion conductors a partial occupation of the octahedral vacancies seems to be crucial.

         <title>Understanding the Influence of Donor&#8208;Acceptor Diazo Compounds on the Catalyst Efficiency of B(C6F5)3 Towards Carbene Formation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Extensive DFT calculations were carried out to interpret electronic effects of the substituents attached (electron donating/withdrawing substituents) to either side of a diazo functionality towards the ease of carbene generation from the corresponding diazo compounds in presence or absence of catalytic amounts of tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane [B(C6F5)3].







Abstract
Diazo compounds have been largely used as carbene precursors for carbene transfer reactions in a variety of functionalization reactions. However, the ease of carbene generation from the corresponding diazo compounds depends upon the electron donating/withdrawing substituents either side of the diazo functionality. These groups strongly impact the ease of N2 release. Recently, tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane [B(C6F5)3] has been shown to be an alternative transition metal&#8208;free catalyst for carbene transfer reactions. Herein, a density functional theory (DFT) study on the generation of carbene species from &#945;&#8208;aryl &#945;&#8208;diazocarbonyl compounds using catalytic amounts of B(C6F5)3 is reported. The significant finding is that the efficiency of the catalyst depends directly on the nature of the substituents on both the aryl ring and the carbonyl group of the substrate. In some cases, the boron catalyst has negligible effect on the ease of the carbene formation, while in other cases there is a dramatic reduction in the activation energy of the reaction. This direct dependence is not commonly observed in catalysis and this finding opens the way for intelligent design of this and other similar catalytic reactions.

         <title>Exploring the Association of Electron&#8208;Donating Corroles with Phthalocyanines as Electron Acceptors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electron&#8208;donating corroles (Cor) were integrated with electron&#8208;accepting phthalocyanines (Pc) to afford two different non&#8208;covalent Cor&#8226;Pc systems. At the forefront was the coordination between a 10&#8208;  meso  &#8208;pyridine Cor and a ZnPc. The complexation was corroborated in a combination of NMR, absorption, and fluorescence assays, and revealed association with binding constants as high as 10  6  M  &#8208;1  . Steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved spectroscopies evidenced that regardless of exciting Cor or Pc, the charge&#8208;separated state evolved efficiently in both cases, followed by a slow charge&#8208;recombination to reinstate the ground state. The introduction of non&#8208;covalent linkages between Cor and Pc induces appreciable sizeable differences in the context of light harvesting and transfer of charges when compared with covalently linked Cor&#8208;Pc conjugates.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Five analogs of dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP) with additional or shifted Me groups were converted with isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and the fungal variediene synthase from  Aspergillus brasiliensis  (AbVS). These enzymatic reactions resulted in the formation of several new terpene analogs that were isolated and structurally characterised by NMR spectroscopy. Several DMAPP analogs showed a changed reactivity giving access to compounds with unusual skeletons. Their formation is mechanistically rationalised and the absolute configurations of all obtained compounds were determined through a stereoselective deuteration strategy, revealing absolute configurations that are analogous to that of the natural enzyme product variediene.</dc:description>

         <title>Fibril structure demonstrates the role of iodine labelling on a pentapeptide self&#8208;assembly</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Iodination has long been employed as a successful labelling strategy to gain structural insights into proteins and other biomolecules  via  several techniques, including Small Angle X&#8208;ray Scattering, Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer (ICP&#8208;MS), and single&#8208;crystal crystallography. However, when dealing with smaller biomolecular systems, interactions driven by iodine may significantly alter their self&#8208;assembly behaviour. The engineering of amyloidogenic peptides for the development of ordered nanomaterials has greatly benefitted from this possibility. Still, to date, iodination has exclusively been applied to aromatic residues. In this work, an aliphatic bis&#8208;iodinated amino acid was synthesized and included into a custom pentapeptide, which showed enhanced fibrillogenic behaviour. Peptide single crystal X&#8208;ray structure and powder X&#8208;ray diffraction on its dried water solution demonstrated the key role of iodine atoms in promoting intermolecular interactions that drive the peptide self&#8208;assembly into amyloid fibrils. These findings enlarge the library of halogenated moieties available for directing and engineering the self&#8208;assembly of amyloidogenic peptides.</dc:description>

Peptide single crystal X-ray structure and powder X-ray diffraction on its dried water solution demonstrated the key role of iodine atoms in promoting intermolecular interactions that drive the peptide self-assembly into amyloid fibrils. These findings enlarge the library of halogenated moieties available for directing and engineering the self-assembly of amyloidogenic peptides.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Universal DNA Aptamer that Recognizes Spike Proteins of Diverse SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Variants of Concern</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report on a unique DNA aptamer, denoted MSA52, that displays universally high affinity for the spike proteins of wildtype SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 as well as the Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Epsilon, Kappa and Delta variants. Using an aptamer pool produced from round 13 of selection against the S1 domain of the wildtype spike protein, we carried out one&#8208;round SELEX experiments using five different trimeric spike proteins from variants, followed by high&#8208;throughput sequencing and sequence alignment analysis of aptamers that formed complexes with all proteins. A previously unidentified aptamer, MSA52, showed&#160;  K  d  &#160;values ranging from 2 &#8208; 10 nM for all variant spike proteins, and also bound similarly to variants not present in the reselection experiments. This aptamer also recognized&#160; pseudotyped lentiviruses (PL) expressing eight different spike proteins of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 with&#160;  K  d  &#160;values between 20 &#8208; 50 pM , and was integrated into a simple colorimetric assay for detection of multiple PL variants. &#160;This discovery provides evidence that aptamers can be generated with high affinity to multiple variants of a single protein, including emerging variants, making it well&#8208;suited for molecular recognition of rapidly evolving targets such as those found in SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2.</dc:description>

         <title>Peroxidase&#8208;Mimetic Copper&#8208;doped Carbon&#8208;Dots for Oxidative Stress&#8208;Mediated Broad&#8208;Spectrum and Efficient Antibacterial Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbon dots (CDs) have recently emerged as antibacterial agents and have attracted considerable attention owing to their fascinating merits of small size, facile fabrication, and surface functionalization. Most of them are involved in external light activation or hybridization with other functional nanomaterials. Herein, we present peroxidase&#8208;like Cu&#8208;doped CDs (Cu&#8208;CDs) for in vitro antibacterial applications. The unique peroxidase&#8208;mimicking property of the Cu&#8208;CDs was demonstrated by tetramethylbenzidine chromogenic assay, electron paramagnetic resonance spectra, and hydroxy radical probe. Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus were chosen as representative gram&#8208;negative/positive models against which Cu&#8208;CDs exhibited superior antimicrobial activity even at a dosage down to 5 &#181;g/mL. A possible mechanism of action was that the Cu&#8208;CDs triggered a catalytic redox reaction of endogenous H  2  O  2  and glutathione depletion in the bacteria cells, with subsequent oxidative stress and membrane disruption. This work provides a new strategy for the design of microenvironment&#8208;responsive antimicrobial nano&#8208;agents.</dc:description>

         <title>Cross&#8208;talk Between (Hydrogen)Sulfite and Metalloproteins: Impact on Human Health</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sulfite is a potent toxic substance causing harm to multi&#8208;organ in human. Despite toxicity, it is widely used as preservative, anti&#8208;browning and anti&#8208;oxidant in foods, beverages, and pharmaceuticals, which cause easy admission of sulfite in human. Sulfite is also produced endogenously during the catabolism of cysteine and methionine. In vivo, the serum sulfite level at physiological range is strictly maintained by a molybdenum dependent sulfite oxidase (SO), which catalyzes sulfite to sulfate via two&#8208;electron oxidation pathway. The loss of SO activity causes high serum sulfite level that fosters several diseases, including asthma, neurological dysfunction, birth defects, and heart diseases. The cytotoxicity of (bi)sulfite is implicated as sulfite radicals, which are generated by mainly heme&#8208;peroxidases via one&#8208;electron oxidation pathway. On the other hand, the toxic sulfite radicals are neutralized to sulfite by heme&#8208;globins. The enzymatic reduction of sulfite to sulfide is catalyzed by sulfite reductase, which contains an unusual metal cofactor, siroheme&#8208;[4Fe4S]&#8208;cluster. Overall, the interaction of sulfite with various metalloproteins in vivo is a close relation with human health. Therefore, this review describes the metabolic conversion of (bi)sulfite to sulfate, sulfite radical or sulfide via oxidation or reduction pathways by various metalloproteins (specially SOs, peroxidases, heme&#8208;globins, and sulfite reductases), and the potential applications of sulfite in biosensors/biofuel cells, anti&#8208;browning, and advance oxidation process.</dc:description>

         <title>Expedient synthesis of oxaboracyclic compounds based on naphthalene and biphenyl backbone and phase&#8208;dependent luminescence of their chelate complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The approach to a series of six&#8208; and seven&#8208;membered oxaboraheterocycles based on naphthalene or biphenyl backbones was developed. The key synthetic step involved Br/Li exchange in respective potassium (bromoaryl)trifluoroborates followed by quenching with selected electrophiles (CO  2  , DMF, Me  2  Si(H)Cl) and hydrolytic workup. Two ring&#8208;expanded benzoxaborole congeners were obtained by an additional reduction step with LiAlH  4  or NaBH  4  . The obtained boracyclic compounds were characterized in detail by NMR spectroscopy and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Specifically, biphenyl&#8208;based systems show dynamic behaviour interpreted in terms of inversion of non&#8208;planar 7&#8208;membered boraheterocycles. The acidity of the obtained compounds varies very strongly (  p  K  a  ranges from 3.1&#8722;9.6) depending on their structure. Due to the enhanced boron Lewis acidity, selected compounds were used as a basis for luminescent complexes with 8&#8208;hydroxyquinoline. A strong phase&#8208;dependent variation of emission band maximum (480&#8722;527 nm) and photoluminescence quantum yield (10&#8722;95%) was observed, which was rationalized in terms of specific aggregation effects.</dc:description>

         <title>Elucidating the germanium distribution in ITQ&#8208;13 zeolites by density functional theory</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>ITQ&#8208;13 is a medium&#8208;pore zeolite that can be prepared in all&#8208;silica form and as silicogermanate with Si/Ge ratios as low as 3. Usually synthesised in the presence of fluoride, ITQ&#8208;13 is among the very few systems containing fluoride anions in two distinct cage types, cube&#8208;like  d4r  units and [4&#183;5  6  ] cages. Here, dispersion&#8208;corrected density functional theory (DFT) calculations are used to investigate the energetically most favourable Ge distributions for Si/Ge ratios between 55 and 6. The calculations show Ge atoms are incorporated at both the corners of  d4r  cages and at the basal plane of the [4&#183;5  6  ] cages, in accordance with  19  F&#8208;NMR spectroscopy. Two Ge atoms at adjacent corners of [4&#183;5  6  ] cages are stable at the highest Ge content considered (Si/Ge = 6).. Such a local environment has not yet been considered in the experimental literature. A calculation of the corresponding  19  F&#8208;NMR resonance points to overlap with other resonances, which might preclude its clear identification. Additional calculations investigate the variation of the dynamic behaviour of the fluoride anions as a function of the local environment as well as the selective defluorination of the [4&#183;5  6  ] cages.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The reaction of fumaryl fluoride with the superacidic solutions XF/MF  5  (X = H, D; M = As, Sb) results in the formation of the monoprotonated and diprotonated species, dependent on the stoichiometric ratio of the Lewis acid in reference to fumaryl fluoride. The salts [C  4  H  3  F  2  O  2  ]  +  [MF  6  ]  &#8211;  (M = As, Sb) and [C  4  H  2  X  2  F  2  O  2  ]  2+  ([MF  6  ]  &#8211;  )  2  (X = H, D; M = As, Sb) are the first examples with a protonated acyl fluoride moiety. They were characterized by low&#8208;temperature vibrational spectroscopy. Low&#8208;temperature NMR spectroscopy and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structure analyses were carried out for [C  4  H  3  F  2  O  2  ]  +  [SbF  6  ]  &#8211;  as well as for [C  4  H  4  F  2  O  2  ]  2+  ([MF  6  ]  &#8211;  )  2  (M = As, Sb). The experimental results are discussed together with quantum chemical calculations of the cations [C  4  H  4  F  2  O  2  &#183; 2 HF]  2+  and [C  4  H  3  F  2  O  2  &#183; HF]  +  on the B3LYP/aug&#8208;cc&#8208;pVTZ level of theory. In addition, Electrostatic Potential (ESP) maps combined with Natural Population Analysis (NPA) charges were calculated in order to investigate the electron distribution and the charge related properties of the diprotonated species. The C&#8211;F bond lengths in the protonated dication are considerably reduced on account of the +R effect.</dc:description>

         <title>Cellular detection of a mitochondria targeted brominated vinyl triphenylamine optical probe (TP&#8208;Br) by X&#8208;ray fluorescence microscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Triphenylamine (TP) derivatives such as&#160;two&#8208;branch cationic vinylbenzimidazolium triphenylamine  &#160;TP&#8208;2Bzim  are promising turn&#8208;on fluorescent probes suitable for two&#8208;photon imaging, labelling mitochondria in live cells. Here, we designed two  TP&#8208;2Bzim  derivatives as bimodal probes suitable for X&#8208;ray fluorescence imaging. The conjugation of the TP core with a rhenium tricarbonyl moiety in the  TP&#8208;RePyta  probe altered the localisation in live cells from mitochondria to lysosomes. The introduction of bromine on the TP core generated the  TP&#8208;Br  probe retaining good photophysical properties and mitochondria labeling in live cells. The influence of calcium channels in the uptake of  TP&#8208;Br  was studied. Synchrotron Radiation X&#8208;ray Fluorescence (SXRF) imaging of bromine enabled the detection of  TP&#8208;Br  and suggested a negligible presence of the probe in an unbound state in the incubated cells, a crucial point in the development of these probes. This study paves the way towards the development of TP probes as specific organelle stainers suitable for SXRF imaging.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Synthesis of Isoxazolines: Method and Mechanism</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An electrochemical method for the green and practical synthesis of a broad range of substituted isoxazoline cores is presented. Both aryl and more challenging alkyl aldoximes are converted to the desired isoxazoline  via  an electrochemically enabled regio&#8208; and diastereoselective reaction with electron&#8208;deficient alkenes. Additionally,  in&#8208;situ  reaction monitoring methods compatible with electrochemistry equipment have also been developed in order to probe the reaction pathway. Supporting analyses from kinetic (timecourse) modeling and density functional theory support a stepwise, radical&#8208;mediated mechanism, and discounts hypothesized involvement of closed shell [3+2] cycloaddition pathways.</dc:description>

         <title>The apparently unreactive substrate facilitates the electron transfer for dioxygen activation in Rieske dioxygenases</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rieske dioxygenases belong to the non&#8208;heme iron family of oxygenases and catalyze important cis&#8208;dihydroxylation as well as O&#8208;/N&#8208;dealkylation and oxidative cyclization reactions for a wide range of substrates. The lack of substrate coordination at the non&#8208;heme ferrous iron center, however, makes it particularly challenging to delineate the role of the substrate for productive O2 activation. Here, we studied the role of the substrate in the key elementary reaction leading to O2 activation from a theoretical perspective by systematically considering (i) the 6&#8208;coordinate to 5&#8208;coordinate conversion of the non&#8208;heme FeII upon abstraction of a water ligand, (ii) binding of O2, and (iii) transfer of an electron from the Rieske cluster. We systematically evaluated the spin&#8208;state&#8208;dependent reaction energies and structural effects at the active site for all combinations of the three elementary processes in the presence and absence of substrate using naphthalene dioxygenase as a prototypical Rieske dioxygenase. We find that reaction energies for the generation of a coordination vacancy at the non&#8208;heme FeII center through thermoneutral H2O reorientation and exothermic O2 binding prior to Rieske cluster oxidation are largely insensitive to the presence of naphthalene and do not lead to formation of any of the known reactive Fe&#8208;oxygen species. By contrast, the role of the substrate becomes evident after Rieske cluster oxidation and exclusively for the 6&#8208;coordinate non&#8208;heme FeII sites in that the additional electron is found at the substrate instead of at the iron and oxygen atoms. Our results imply an allosteric control of the substrate on Rieske dioxygenase reactivity to happen prior to changes at the non&#8208;heme FeII in agreement with a strategy that avoids unproductive O2 activation.</dc:description>

         <title>Binding interactions in copper, silver and gold &#960;&#8208;complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The copper(I), silver(I), and gold(I) metals bind &#960;&#8208;ligands by &#963;&#8208;bonding and &#960;&#8208;back bonding interactions. We investigated these interactions using bidentate ancillary ligands with electron donating and withdrawing substituents. The &#960;&#8208;ligands span from ethylene to larger terminal and internal alkenes and alkynes. By means of X&#8208;ray crystallography, NMR, and IR spectroscopy and gas phase experiments, we show that the binding energies increase in the order Ag &lt; Cu &lt; Au and the binding energies are slightly higher for alkynes than for alkenes. By modulating the electron density at the metal using substituents on the ancillary ligands, we show that the &#960;&#8208;back bonding interaction plays a dominant role for the binding in the copper and gold complexes.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Strong push&#8208;pull interactions between&#160; diaminoazobenzene (azo), and&#160; perylenediimide (PDI), entities in the newly synthesized A&#8208;D&#8208;A type triads and the corresponding A&#8208;D dyads are shown to reveal wide&#8208;band absorption.&#160; Electrochemical studies revealed the facile reduction of PDI and relatively easier oxidation of diaminoazobenzene compared to that of PDI in the dyads and triads.&#160; Charge transfer reversal using fluorescence&#8208;spectroelectrochemistry wherein the PDI fluorescence recovery upon one&#8208;electron oxidation, deterring the charge&#8208;transfer interactions, was possible to accomplish.&#160; The charge transfer state density difference and the frontier orbitals from the DFT calculations established the PDI to be an electron acceptor and diaminoazobenzene to be an electron donor resulting in energetically closely positioned   PDI  d&#8208;  &#8208;Azo  d+  &#8208;PDI  d&#8208;  quadrupolar charge&#8208;transfer states  in the case of triads and Azo  d+  &#8208;PDI  d&#8208;  dipolar charge&#8208;transfer states in the case of dyads.&#160; Subsequent femtosecond transient absorption spectral studies unequivocally proved the occurrence of excited&#8208;state charge transfer in these dyads and triads in benzonitrile wherein the calculated forward charge transfer rate constants,  k  f  , were limited to instrument response factor, meaning &gt; 10  12  s  &#8208;1  revealing the occurrence of ultrafast photo&#8208;events.

         <title>Development of Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free Lewis Acid&#8208;Initiated Double Arylation of Aldehyde: A Facile Approach Towards the Total Synthesis of Anti&#8208;breast Cancer Agent</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This work describes a mild and robust double hydroarylation strategy for the synthesis of symmetrical /unsymmetrical diaryl&#8208; and triarylmethanes in excellent yields using Lambert salt (0.2&#8208;1.0 mol%). Despite the anticipated challenges associated with controlling selective product formation, unsymmetrical diaryl&#8208; and triarylmethanes products are obtained unprecedentedly. A highly efficient gram scale reaction has also been reported (TON for symmetrical product = 475 and for unsymmetrical product = 390). The synthetic utility of the methodology is demonstrated by the preparation of several unexplored diaryl&#8208; and triarylmethanes&#8208;based biological relevant molecules, such as arundine, vibrindole A, turbomycin B, anti&#8208;inflammatory agent. A total synthesis of anti&#8208;breast cancer agent is also demonstrated. Control experiments, Hammett analysis, HRMS and GC&#8208;MS studies reveal the reaction intermediates and reaction mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>H/F substitution induced large increase of Tc in a 3D hybrid rare&#8208;earth double perovskite multifunctional compound</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Increasing attention to study perovskite&#8208;type multifunctional stimuli&#8208;responsive materials with multiple channel physical characteristics. However, it remains significant challenges to simultaneously achieve multifunction and control of structural phase transition temperature in hybrid compounds. Here, we report two three&#8208;dimensional organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid rare&#8208;earth double perovskite compounds, (HQ)2RbEu(NO3)6 (1, HQ = quinuclidium) and (4FHQ)2 RbEu(NO3)6 (2, 4FHQ = 4&#8208;fluoro&#8208;quinuclidium), which exhibit ferroelasticity, dielectric switch, and excellent photoluminescence response. The phase transition temperature of 2 increases 169 K compared with 1 through H/F substitution. This result is attributed to the H/F substitution generated Rb&#8722;F coordinate between cations and anions. Meanwhile, the photoluminescence emission intensity of 2 shows no quench with the increase of temperature, in particular, the emission spectrum achieves fine regulation at high temperatures. This work provides a new solution for the realization of multi&#8208;functions and regulations of the properties based on hybrid perovskite materials with high critical temperatures.</dc:description>

         <title>Proton or Carbene Transfer? On the Dark and Light Reaction of Diazoalkanes with Alcohols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The formal alkylation reaction of OH groups with diazoalkanes under catalyst&#8208;free reaction conditions finds broad application in organic synthesis. However, this reaction is even today mainly limited to the use of diazomethane as reaction partner. In this combined experimental and theoretical study, we aim at a fundamental understanding of the reaction of diazoalkanes with alcohols to make this transformation amenable to a generalized approach towards formal alkylation reactions of alcohols with diazoalkanes. Experimental and theoretical studies suggest a direct proton transfer only in exceptional cases. In a more general setting, such O&#8208;H functionalization proceed both under dark and photochemical conditions via a key hydrogen&#8208;bonded singlet carbene intermediate that undergoes a protonation&#8208;addition mechanism. We conclude with applications of this approach in O&#8208;H functionalization reactions of alcohols, including simple fluorinated, halogenated and aliphatic alcohols and showcase functional group tolerance of this method in the reaction of biologically active and pharmaceutically relevant alcohols.</dc:description>

         <title>Directed Synthesis and Chemistry of Unsymmetric Dicationic Diboranes and Their Use in FLP&#8208;like Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The chemistry of dicationic diboranes with two B  II  atoms that are engaged in direct B&#8208;B bonding is by enlarge unexplored, although these molecules have intriguing properties due to their combined Lewis acidic and electron&#8208;donor properties. Unsymmetric dicationic diboranes are extremely rare, but especially attractive due to their polarized B&#8208;B bond. In this work we report the directed synthesis of several stable unsymmetric dicationic diboranes by reaction between the electron&#8208;rich ditriflato&#8208;diborane B  2  (hpp)  2  (OTf)  2  (hpp = 1,3,4,6,7,8&#8208;hexahydro&#8208;2  H  &#8208;pyrimido[1,2&#8208;&#945;]pyrimidinate) and a phosphino&#8208;pyridine, establishing B&#8208;N and B&#8208;P bonds with the diborane concomitant with triflate elimination. In the case of 2&#8208;((ditertbutylphosphino)methyl)pyridine, the B&#8208;N bond is formed instantly, but the B&#8208;P bond formation requires (due to steric constraints) several days at ambient conditions for completion, creating an intermediate that could be used for frustrated Lewis pair (FLP)&#8208;like chemistry. Here we test its reaction with an aldehyde, and propose a new type of FLP&#8208;like chemistry.</dc:description>

Here we test its reaction with an aldehyde, and propose a new type of FLP-like chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>On the road for more efficient biocompatible two&#8208;photon excitable fluorophores</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Red to NIR absorption and emission wavelengths are key requirements for intravital bioimaging. One of the way to reach such excitation wavelengths is to use two&#8208;photon excitation. Unfortunately, there is still a lack of two&#8208;photon excitable fluorophores that are both efficient and biocompatible. Thus, we design a series of biocompatible quadrupolar dyes in order to study their ability to be used for live&#8208;cell imaging, and in particular for two&#8208;photon microscopy. Hence, we report the synthesis of 5 probes based on different donor cores (phenoxazine, acridane, phenazasiline and phenothiazine) and the study of their linear and non&#8208;linear photophysical properties. TD&#8208;DFT calculations were performed and were able to highlight the structure&#8208;property relationship of this series. All these studies highlight the great potential of three of these biocompatible dyes for two&#8208;photon microscopy, as they both exhibit high two&#8208;photon cross&#8208;sections (up to 3 650 GM) and emit orange to red light. This potential was confirmed through live&#8208;cell two&#8208;photon microscopy experiments, leading to images with very high brightness and contrast.</dc:description>

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;mimetic molecular selective catalysis via single Zr atom catalysis in chelated cage embedded in a flexible piezoelectrical matrix</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The molecularly selective catalysis in enzyme is central to life. However, their functioning mechanism remains elusive. We propose here that the synergistic effects from (i) effective orbital hybridyzing and energy gap decreasing via chelating on single Zr atom as the catalytic center, (ii) selective supramolecular encapsulation in the cage, and (iii) piezoelectrical field motivation are able to achieve the enzyme&#8208;mimetic molecular selective high performance catalysis. Metal&#8208;organic polyhedra (MOPs) are added into a piezoelectrical polymer matrix to achieve the composite structure where ultrasonic treatment motivates redox reactions in the MOP&#8208;guest complex. Encapsulated and chelated guest such as Rhodamine B (RhB) is effectively converted with ratios higher than 90% after 100 min. In comparison, molecules inefficient in either cage encapsulation or chelating with the Zr center can not be converted. This study first proposes a synergistic plot for enzyme&#8208;mimetic catalyst realization and is expected to inspire new mentality in efficient catalyst designing.</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient oligomerization of aromatic amino acids induced by gaps in four&#8208;helix bundles of DNA or RNA</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The formation of peptides from amino acids is one of the processes associated with life. Because of the dominant role of translation in extant biology, peptide&#8208;forming processes that are RNA&#8208;induced are of particular interest. We had previously reported the formation of phosphoramidate&#8208;linked peptido RNAs as the products of spontaneous condensation reactions between ribonucleotides and free amino acids in aqueous solution. We now asked whether four&#8208;helix bundle (4HB) DNA or RNA folding motifs with a single&#8208; or double&#8208;nucleotide gap next to a 5'&#8208;phosphate can act as reaction sites for phosphoramidate formation. For glycine, this was found to be the case, whereas phenylalanine and tryptophan showed accelerated formation of peptides without a covalent link to the nucleic acid. Free peptides with up to 11 tryptophan or phenylalanine residues were found in precipitates forming in the presence of gap&#8208;containing DNA or RNA 4HB's. Control experiments using motifs with just a nick or primer alone did not have the same effect. Because folded structures with a gap in a double helix are likely products of hybridization of strands formed in statistically controlled oligomerization reactions, our results are interesting in the context of prebiotic scenarios. Independent of a putative role in evolution, our findings suggest that for some aromatic amino acids an RNA&#8208;induced pathway for oligomerization exists that does not have a discernable link to translation.</dc:description>

         <title>Role of anionic backbone in NHC&#8208;stabilized coinage metal complexes: New precursors for atomic layer deposition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cu and Ag precursors that are volatile, reactive, and thermally stable are currently of high interest for their application in atomic layer deposition (ALD) of thin metal films. In pursuit of new precursors for coinage metals namely Cu and Ag, a series of new N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) based Cu(I) and Ag(I) complexes were synthesized. Modifications in the substitution pattern of diketonate&#8208;based anionic backbones led to five monomeric Cu complexes and four closely related Ag complexes with the general formula [M(  tBu  NHC)(R)] (M = Cu, Ag;  tBu  NHC = 1,3&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene; R = diketonate). Thermal analysis indicated that most of the Cu complexes are thermally stable and volatile compared to the more fragile Ag analogs. One of the promising Cu precursors was evaluated for the ALD of nanoparticulate Cu metal deposits using hydroquinone as the reducing agent at appreciably low deposition temperatures (145&#8211;160 &#176;C). This study highlights the considerable impact of the employed ligand sphere on the structural and thermal properties of metal complexes that are relevant for vapor phase processing of thin films.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing robust oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts with excellent performance is essential for conversion of renewable electricity to clean fuel. Herein, we present a facile concept for the design of efficient high entropy metal&#8208;organic frameworks (HEMOFs) as electrocatalyst by one&#8208;step solvothermal synthesis. The strategy allows for control of the microstructure and corresponding lattice distortion by tuning the metal ion composition. As a result, the OER activity was improved by optimising the coordination environment of the metal catalytic center. The environment affects the electronic density and consequently binding energies of oxygenated intermediates at the metal ion centers. The optimized Co&#8208;rich HEMOFs exhibited a low overpotential of 310 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm &#8208;2 , better than RuO 2 catalyst. The finding involves lattice distortion of the high entropy MOFs provides more strategy for developing high&#8208;performance electrocatalyst for energy conversion.</dc:description>

         <title>Activation by Glutathione in Hypoxic Environment of an Azo&#8208;based Rhodamine Activatable Photosensitizer. A Computational Elucidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In the present paper, density functional theory (DFT) has been applied to the study of the activation mechanism of a new selenium azo&#8208;rhodamine (azoSeRho) in presence of the tripeptide thiol, glutathione (GSH), as potent photosensitizer to be employed in photodynamic therapy. The introduction of the azo group into the conjugated system of the seleno&#8208;rhodamine dye and its reaction with GSH allow the selective formation of the active photosensitizer, SeRho. Furthermore, DFT calculations have allowed to shed light on the activation mechanism of the azoSeRho photosensitizer when molecular oxygen is present and hydrogen peroxide is formed. This study is the first theoretical investigation revealing how the reductive cleavage of the azo moiety by GSH occurs. Time&#8208;dependent DFT approach has been used to evaluate the chalcogen&#8208;substitution effect on the structures and photophysical properties of the azo derivatives and, then, on the activated photosensitizers.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanistic Insights on the Mechanosynthesis of Phenytoin, a WHO Essential Medicine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In recent years, mechanochemistry has enriched the toolbox of synthetic chemists, enabling faster and more sustainable access to new materials and existing products, including active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). However, molecular&#8208;level understanding of most mechanochemical reactions remains limited, delaying the implementation of mechanochemistry in industrial applications. Herein, we have applied in&#8208;situ monitoring by Raman spectroscopy to the mechanosynthesis of phenytoin, a World Health Organization (WHO) Essential Medicine, enabling the observation, isolation, and characterization of key molecular&#8208;migration intermediates involved in the single&#8208;step transformation of benzil, urea, and KOH into phenytoin. This work contributes to the elucidation of a reaction mechanism that has been subjected to a number of interpretations over time and paints a clear picture of how mechanosynthesis can be applied and optimized for the preparation of added&#8208;value molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Kinase sensing based on protein interactions at the catalytic site</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The role kinases play in regulating cellular processes makes them potential biomarkers for detecting the onset and prognosis of various diseases, including many types of cancer. Current kinase biosensors, including electrochemical and radiometric methods, rely on sensing the ATP&#8208;dependent enzymatic phosphorylation reaction. Here we introduce a new type of interaction&#8208;based electrochemical kinase biosensor that does not require any chemical labelling or modification. The basis for sensing is the interactions between the catalytic site of the kinase and the phosphorylation site of its substrate rather than the phosphorylation reaction. We demonstrated this concept with the ERK2 kinase and its substrate protein HDGF, which is involved in lung cancer. A peptide monolayer derived from the HDGF phosphorylation site was adsorbed onto a gold electrode and was used to sense ERK2 without ATP. The sensitivity of the assay was down to 10 nM of ERK2, corresponding with the range of its cellular concentration. Surface chemistry analysis confirmed that ERK2 was bound to the HDGF peptide monolayer. This increased the permeability of redox&#8208;active species through the monolayer and resulted in ERK2 electrochemical sensing. Since our detection approach is based on protein&#8208;protein interactions and not on the enzymatic reaction, it can be further utilized for more selective detection of different types of enzymes.</dc:description>

         <title>Carbodiimide&#8208;driven dimerization and self&#8208;assembly of artificial, ribose&#8208;based amphiphiles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The aqueous self&#8208;assembly of amphiphiles into aggregates such as micelles and vesicles has been widely investigated over the past decades with applications ranging from materials science to drug delivery. The combination of characteristic properties of nucleic acids and amphiphiles is of substantial interest to mimic biological self&#8208;organization and compartmentalization. Herein, we present ribose&#8208; and ribonucleotide&#8208;based amphiphiles and investigate their self&#8208;assembly as well as their fundamental reactivity. We found that various types of aggregates are formed, ranging in size from nanometers to micrometers and all amphiphiles exhibit aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) in solution as well as in the solid state. We also observed that the addition of 1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;(3&#8208;dimethylaminopropyl)&#8208;carbodiimide (EDC) leads to rapid and selective dimerization of the amphiphiles into pyrophosphates, which decreases the critical aggregation concentration (CAC) by a factor of 25 when compared to the monomers. Since the propensity for amphiphile dimerization is correlated with their tendency to self&#8208;assemble, our results may be relevant for the formation of rudimentary compartments under prebiotic conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Acetylene Derivatives of Cationic Diazaoxatriangulenes and Diaza [4]Helicenes &#8211; Access to Red Emitters and Planar Chiral Stereochemical Traits</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cationic triangulenes, and related helicenes, constitute a rich class of dyes and fluorophores, usually absorbing and emitting light at low energy, in the orange to red domains. Recently, to broaden the scope of applications, regioselective late&#8208;stage functionalizations on these core moieties have been developed. For instance, with the introduction of electron&#8208;donating groups (EDGs), important bathochromic shifts are observed pushing absorptions towards or in the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) spectral domain while emissive properties disappear essentially completely. Herein, to upset this drawback, acetylene derivatives of cationic diazaoxa triangulenes (DAOTA) and [4]helicenes are prepared (16 examples). Contrary to other EDG&#8208;functionalized derivatives, C&#8801;C&#8208;functionalized products remain broadly fluorescent, with red&#8208;shifted absorptions (Dlabs up to 25 nm) and emissions (Dlem up to 73 nm, FPL up to 51%). Quite interestingly, a general dynamic stereoisomerism phenomenon is evidenced for the compounds derived from achiral DAOTA cores. At low temperature in 1H&#8208;NMR spectroscopy (218 K), N&#8208;CH2 protons become diastereotopic with chemical shifts differences (Dd) as high as +1.64 ppm. The signal coalescence occurs around 273 K with a barrier of ~12 kcal.mol&#8208;1. This phenomenon is due to planar chiral conformations (Sp and Rp configurations), induced by the geometry of the alkyl (n&#8208;propyl) side&#8208;chains next to the acetylenic substituents. Finally, DFT calculations offer a valuable insight on geometries, stereodynamics and on the large difference in NMR for some of the diastereotopic protons.</dc:description>

Contrary to other EDG-functionalized derivatives, C&#8801;C-functionalized products remain broadly fluorescent, with red-shifted absorptions (Dlabs up to 25 nm) and emissions (Dlem up to 73 nm, FPL up to 51%). Quite interestingly, a general dynamic stereoisomerism phenomenon is evidenced for the compounds derived from achiral DAOTA cores. At low temperature in 1H-NMR spectroscopy (218 K), N-CH2 protons become diastereotopic with chemical shifts differences (Dd) as high as +1.64 ppm. The signal coalescence occurs around 273 K with a barrier of ~12 kcal.mol-1. This phenomenon is due to planar chiral conformations (Sp and Rp configurations), induced by the geometry of the alkyl (n-propyl) side-chains next to the acetylenic substituents. Finally, DFT calculations offer a valuable insight on geometries, stereodynamics and on the large difference in NMR for some of the diastereotopic protons.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electronic circular dichroism&#8208;circularly polarized Raman (eCP&#8208;Raman): a new form of chiral Raman spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We summarize recent works on the discovery of a new form of chiral Raman spectroscopy,  e  CP&#8208;Raman, which combines two spectroscopies: electronic circular dichroism (ECD) and circularly polarized Raman (CP&#8208;Raman). First, some puzzling observations while carrying out Raman optical activity (ROA) measurements of several transition metal complexes under resonance are described, as well as the search for the mechanisms responsible. Then an equation for quantifying the  e  CP&#8208;Raman contribution is presented, followed by several examples of how  e  CP&#8208;Raman influences  the  I  R  &#8211; I  L  spectra of achiral and chiral solvent molecules and of a number of chiral solutes under resonance. The conditions to extract resonance ROA, when the  e  CP&#8208;Raman contribution is minimized, are also discussed. Finally, we comment on the potential applications of  e  CP&#8208;Raman.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure and Interaction Based Design of Anti&#8208;SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Aptamers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aptamer selection against novel infections is a complicated and time&#8208;consuming approach. Synergy can be achieved by using computational methods together with experimental procedures. This study aims to develop a reliable methodology for a rational aptamer  in silico  et vitro  design. The new approach combines multiple steps: (1) Molecular design, based on screening in a DNA aptamer library and directed mutagenesis to fit the protein tertiary structure; (2) 3D molecular modeling of the target; (3) Molecular docking of an aptamer with the protein; (4) Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the complexes; (5) Quantum&#8208;mechanical (QM) evaluation of the interactions between aptamer and target with further analysis; (6) Experimental verification at each cycle for structure and binding affinity using small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering, cytometry, and fluorescence polarization. Using a new iterative design procedure, Interaction Based Drug Design (SIBDD), a highly specific aptamer to the receptor&#8208;binding domain of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike protein, was developed and validated.
The SIBDD approach enhances speed of the high&#8208;affinity aptamers development from scratch, using a target protein structure. The method could be used to improve existing aptamers for stronger binding. This approach brings to an advanced level the development of novel affinity probes, functional nucleic acids. It offers a blueprint for the straightforward design of targeting molecules for new pathogen agents and emerging variants.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis, Reactivity and Structural Properties of Trifluoromethylphosphoranides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phosphoranides are interesting hypervalent species which serve as model compounds for intermediates or transition states in nucleophilic substitution reactions at trivalent phosphorus substrates. Herein, we report on the syntheses and properties of stable trifluoromethylphosphoranide salts.

These [P(CF  3  )  4&#8208;n  F  n  ]  &#8722;  (n = 0&#8208;2) salts exhibit fluorinating (n = 1&#8208;2) or trifluoromethylating (n = 0) properties, which is disclosed by studying their reactivity towards selected electrophiles. The solid&#8208;state structures of [K(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)][P(CF  3  )  4  ] and [K(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)][P(CF  3  )  3  F] are ascertained by single crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography.

         <title>Tuning the (Chir)optical Properties and Squeezing out the Inherent Chirality in Polyphenylene&#8208;Locked Helical Carbon Nanorings</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Distorting linear polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) out of planarity affects their physical properties and breaks their symmetry to induce inherent chirality. However, the chirality cannot be achieved in large distorted PAHs&#8208;based macrocycles due to low racemization barrier for isomerization. Herein we report the precise synthesis and tuning size&#8208;dependent (chir)optical properties of a new class of chiral PAHs&#8208;containing conjugated macrocycles (cyclo[n]paraphenylene&#8208;2,6&#8208;anthrylene, [n]CPPAn2,6; n = 6&#8208;8). Their inherent chiralities were squeezed out in small anthrylene&#8208;based macrocycles. Efficient resolutions for chiral enantiomers with (P)/(M)&#8208;helicity of small [6&#8208;7]CPPAns were achieved by HPLC. Interestingly, these macrocycles showed enriched size&#8208;dependent physical, chiral, and (chir)optical properties. Theoretical calculations indicate that these macrocycles have high strain energy (Estrain = 60.8 to 73.4 kcal/mol) and very small Egap (~3.0 eV). Notably, these enantiomers showed strong chiroptical properties and dissymmetry factors (|gabs| and |glum| ~0.01 for an enantiomer of [6]CPPAn2,6), which can give them potential applications in optically active materials.</dc:description>

         <title>The Potential of Micellar Media in the Synthesis of DNA&#8208;Encoded Libraries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>DNA&#8208;encoded library (DEL) technology has become widely used in drug discovery research.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;DNA-encoded library (DEL) technology has become widely used in drug discovery research. The construction of DELs require robust organic transformations which proceed in aqueous media under mild conditions. Unfortunately, the application of water as reaction media for organic synthesis is not evident due to generally limited solubility of organic reagents. However, the use of surfactants can offer a solution to this issue. Oil-in-water microemulsions formed by surfactant micelles are able localize hydrophobic reagents inside them, resulting in high local concentration of the organic substances in an otherwise poorly solvated environment. This review provides a conceptual and critical summary of micellar synthesis possibilities that are well-suited for DEL synthesis.

         <title>Enantioselective C&#8208;H Functionalization Reactions under Gold Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition metal&#8208;catalyzed enantioselective functionalization of ubiquitous C&#8208;H bonds has proven to be promising field as it offers the construction of chiral molecular complexity in a step&#8208; and atom&#8208;economical manner. In recent years, gold has emerged as an attractive contender for catalyzing such reactions. The unique reactivities and selectivities offered by gold catalysts have been exploited to access numerous asymmetric transformations based on gold&#8208;catalyzed C&#8208;H functionalization processes. Herein, this review critically highlights the major advances and discoveries made in the enantioselective C&#8208;H functionalization under gold catalysis which is accompanied by mechanistic insights at appropriate places.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of 3&#8208;Methyleneisoindolin&#8208;1&#8208;ones and Isoquinolinium Salts via Exo and Endo Selective Cyclization of 2&#8208;(1&#8208;Alkynyl)benzaldimines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Coinage metal&#8208;promoted 5&#8208;  exo  and 6&#8208;  endo  selective cyclization of 2&#8208;(1&#8208;alkynyl)benzaldimines have been studied. It was found that, under gold catalysis, 2&#8208;(1&#8208;alkynyl)benzaldimines underwent exclusive 5&#8208;  exo  &#8208;dig cyclization processes, followed by oxidation to form  N  &#8208;aryl 3&#8208;methyleneisoindolin&#8208;1&#8208;ones. In contrast, in the presence of base and under activation of AgOTf, switching of 5&#8208;  exo  into 6&#8208;  endo  cyclizations of 2&#8208;(1&#8208;alkynyl)benzaldimines was observed, exclusively giving  N  &#8208;aryl or  N  &#8208;alkyl substituted isoquinolinium salts. The two key reaction intermediates, exocyclic vinyl&#8208;Au and the endocyclic vinyl&#8208;Ag species have been isolated and characterized, and the study of their reactivities confirms the plausible mechanisms. Moreover, reacting the resultant 3&#8208;methyleneisoindolin&#8208;1&#8208;ones with benzyne could afford structurally important isoindolinone&#8208;based benzocyclobutenes. Additionally, several interesting transformations of the resultant isoquinolinium salts have been also investigated.</dc:description>

         <title>Tunable excimer circularly polarized luminescence in isohexide derivatives from renewable resources</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic compounds showing circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) are at the forefront of novel applications and technologies. Here we show the synthesis and chiroptical properties of pyrene and perylene derivatives of inexpensive chiral scaffolds: isomannide and isosorbide. Low&#8208;intensity ECD spectra were obtained, suggesting the absence of chromophore interaction in the ground state, except in the case of isomannide bis&#8208;perylenecarboxylate, whose ECD spectrum showed a positive exciton couplet. All isomannide derivatives, with the only exception of the one containing a pyrenecarboxylate and a perylenecarboxylate, exhibited excimer CPL spectra, whereas isosorbide derivatives did not show any CPL. Isomannide derivatives bearing two pyrenecarboxylate or two pyrenylacetate groups showed positive CPL emission with dissymmetry factors up to 10  &#8208;2  , which depends on the conformational freedom of the appended units. The CPL sign, Stokes shift and order of magnitude of dissymmetry factor were reproduced by excited&#8208;state calculations on a representative compound. Interestingly, the mixed derivative containing pyrenic units with different spacing from the isomannide scaffold showed an oppositely signed excimer band with respect to the homo&#8208;substituted derivatives.</dc:description>
