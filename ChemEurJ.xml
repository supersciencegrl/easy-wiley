         <title>Electronic Structure Analysis of the&#160;A10Tt2P6 System (A&#160;=&#160;Li &#8208; Cs; Tt&#160;=&#160;Si, Ge, Sn)&#160;and Synthesis of the Direct Band Gap Semiconductor K10Sn2P6</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Investigating the relationship between atomic and electronic structures is a powerful tool to screen the wide variety of Zintl phases for interesting optoelectronic properties. To get an insight in such relations, the A10Tt2P6 system (A=Li&#8208;Cs; Tt=Si&#8208;Sn) was picked as model system to analyse the influence of structural motives, combination of elements and their properties on type and width of the band gaps. Those compounds comprise two interesting structural motives of their anions, which are either monomeric trigonal planar TtP35&#8208; units which are isostructural to CO32&#8208;&#160;&#160;or [Tt2P6]10&#8208; dimers which correspond to two edge&#8208;sharing TtP4 tetrahedra. The A10Tt2P6 compounds were structurally optimized for both polymorphs and subsequent frequency analysis, band structure as well as density of states calculations were performed. The Gibbs free energies were compared to determine temperature dependent stability, where Na10Si2P6, Na10Ge2P6 and K10Sn2P6 were found to be candidates for a high temperature phase transition between the two polymorphs. Additionally, the unknown, but predicted compound K10Sn2P6 was synthesized and characterized by single crystal and powder x&#8208;ray diffraction. It crystalizes in the monoclinic space group P21/n and incorporates [Sn2P6]10&#8208; edge sharing double tetrahedra. It was determined to be a direct band gap semiconductor with a band gap of 2.57eV.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of [1]Benzothieno[3,2&#8208;b][1]benzothiophenes through Iodine&#8208;Mediated Sulfur Insertion Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>[1]Benzothieno[3,2&#8208;b][1]benzothiophenes (BTBTs) are important molecules that have been extensively studied as high&#8208;performance organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs). Therefore, it is important to develop a simple synthetic method for these molecules. In this paper, a synthetic method to obtain the BTBTs from 2&#8208;arylbenzo[b]thiophenes and elemental sulfur, in which two C&#8211;S bonds are formed at once, is described. In this method, molecular iodine plays a very important role as an additive. The role of iodine is discussed in the presumed reaction pathways.</dc:description>

         <title>A Versatile, Functional Group&#8208;Tolerant, and Bench&#8208;Stable Iron Precatalyst for Building Arene and Triazine Rings by [2+2+2] Cycloadditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report an efficient iron&#8208;catalyzed cycloaddition procedure leading to the construction of (hetero)aromatic rings by alkyne [2+2+2] cycloisomerization. This method relies on the use of an air&#8208;stable (N,N)Fe(II) precursor easily prepared from a commercially available ligand derived from 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline, reduced in situ into a catalytically active non&#8208;innocent (N,N&#9679;&#8211;)2Fe(II) species. This system displays a large scope application, operates under mild conditions and at low catalytic charges (25 cycloadducts formed, up to 1.5 mol% catalyst). Moreover, this method also enables access to 29 cycloadducts by cross&#8208;cycloisomerization between 1,6&#8208; or 1,7&#8208;diynes and alkynes in near&#8208;equimolar conditions. 1,3,5&#8208;Triazines can also be prepared with this procedure starting from the corresponding cyanamides. Scale&#8208;up reactions and post&#8208;functionalization of several cycloadducts also show that this [2+2+2] cycloaddition can be used in multistep sequences.</dc:description>

         <title>Exploring the Theoretical Foundations of Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence (TADF) Emission: A Comprehensive TD&#8208;DFT Study on Phenothiazine Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study conducts a thorough theoretical investigation of Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence (TADF) in phenothiazine&#8208;based systems, examining ten molecular configurations recognized experimentally as TADF&#8208;active. Employing Time&#8208;Dependent Density Functional Theory (TD&#8208;DFT), our analysis spans the investigation of singlet&#8208;triplet energy gaps ($\Delta E_{ST}$), spin&#8208;orbit coupling, and excitation characteristics using Multiwfn. This approach validates the adherence to El Sayed's rule across these systems but also provides a detailed understanding of charge transfer dynamics, as visualized through heat maps. A significant aspect of our study is the exploration of different oxidation states of sulfur and site substitutions on phenothiazine. This systematic variation aims to identify additional TADF&#8208;active compounds, drawing parallels with properties characterizing other known TADF emitters. Our investigation into Reverse Intersystem Crossing (rISC) rates and the analysis of dihedral angles in relation to $\Delta E_{ST}$ values offer nuanced insights into the TADF behaviours of these molecules.&#160; By integrating rigorous computational analysis, we provide a foundational understanding that enhances the design and optimization of phenothiazine&#8208;based materials for optoelectronic applications. This work not only advances our theoretical understanding of TADF in phenothiazine derivatives but also serves as a guide for experimentalists and industry professionals in the strategic design of new TADF materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Influence Mechanism of Interfacial Oxidation of Li3YCl6 Solid Electrolyte on Reduction Potential</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Halide&#8208;based solid electrolytes are promising candidates for all solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;ion batteries (ASSLBs) due to their high ionic conductivity, wide electrochemical window, and excellent chemical stability with cathode materials. However, when tested in practice, their intrinsic electrochemical stability windows do not well match the conditions for stable operation of ASSBs. Existing literature reports halide&#8208;based ASSBs that still operate well outside the electrochemical stability window, while ASSBs that do not operate within the window are not well studied or the studies are based on the cathode material interface. In this study, we aim to elucidate the mechanism behind all&#8208;solid&#8208;state battery failure by investigating how the reduction potential of Li3YCl6 solid&#8208;state electrolyte itself changes under overcharging conditions. Our findings demonstrate that in Li&#8208;In|Li3YCl6|Li3YCl6&#8208;C half&#8208;cells during the first state of charge, Cl ions participate in charge compensation, resulting in a depletion of ligands. This phenomenon significantly affects the reduction potential of Y3+, causing it to be reduced to Y2Cl3 and ultimately to Y0 at conditions far exceeding its actual reduction potential. Furthermore, we analyze the interfacial impedance induced by this process and propose a novel perspective on battery failure.</dc:description>

         <title>Near&#8208;IR&#8208;Absorbing Bis&#8208;Donor Functionalized Aza&#8208;BODIPY Derivatives: Synthesis and Photophysical Study by Using Transient Optical Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of near&#8208;IR absorbing 2,6&#8208;diarylated BF2&#8208;chelated aza&#8208;boron&#8208;dipyrromethenes (aza&#8208;BDPs) derivatives bearing different electron donors (Benzene, naphthalene, phenanthrene, phenothiazine and carbazole) were designed and synthesized. The effect of different electron donor substitutions on the photophysical properties was studied by steady&#8208;state UV&#8208;vis absorption and fluorescence spectra, electrochemical, time&#8208;resolved nanosecond transient absorption (ns&#8208;TA) spectroscopy and theoretical computations. The UV&#8722;vis absorption spectra of AzaBDP&#8208;PTZ and AzaBDP&#8208;CAR (&#955;abs = 710 nm in toluene) showed a bathochromic absorption profile compared with the reference AzaBDP&#8208;Ph (&#955;abs = 685 nm in toluene), indicating the non&#8208;negligible electronic interaction at the ground state between donor and acceptor moieties. Moreover, the fluorescence is almost completely quenched for AzaBDP&#8208;PTZ/AzaBDP&#8208;CAR (fluorescence quantum yield, &#934;F = 0.2&#8722;0.7% in toluene) as compared with the AzaBDP&#8208;Ph (&#934;F = 27% in toluene). However, the apparent intersystem crossing ability of these compounds is poor, based on the singlet oxygen quantum yield (&#934;&#916; = 0.3&#8722;1.5%). The ns&#8208;TA spectral study showed typical Bodipy localized triplet state transient features, short&#8208;lived excited triplet state for AzaBDP&#8208;Ph (&#964;T = 53.2 &#956;s) versus significantly long&#8208;lived triplet state for AzaBDP&#8208;CAR (&#964;T = 114 &#956;s) was observed under deaerated experimental conditions. &#160;These information are useful for molecular structure design of triplet photosensitizers.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of gem&#8208;Difluorinated Keto&#8208;Sulfoxides from Sulfoxonium Ylides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic molecules containing fluorine and sulfur atoms represent a large percentage of approved pharmaceuticals. Those with combination of both S and F atoms in their structure such as Xtandi, approved in 2012 for prostate cancer, indicates the importance of synthetic methods that accommodates both atoms in an organic moiety. In this study, a novel aspect of sulfoxonium ylide reactivity was explored, unveiling a streamlined and mild synthesis method for gem&#8208;difluorinated keto&#8208;sulfoxides. Our protocol offers a direct and practical approach to prepare these compounds in 14&#8208;80% chemical yields, that were represented by 21 examples. NMR studies and Hammett correlations gave strong evidence about the mechanism of this transformation.</dc:description>

         <title>Development of Receptor for Advanced Glycation End Products (RAGE) ligands through target directed dynamic combinatorial chemistry: a novel class of possible antagonists</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>RAGE is a transmembrane receptor of immunoglobulin family that can bind various endogenous and exogenous ligands, initiating the inflammatory downstream signaling pathways, including inflammaging. Therefore, RAGE represents an attractive drug target for age&#8208;related diseases. For the development of small&#8208;molecule RAGE antagonists, we employed protein&#8208;templated dynamic combinatorial chemistry (ptDCC) using RAGE's VC1 domain as a template, the first application of this approach in the context of RAGE. The affinities of DCC hits were validated using microscale thermophoresis. Subsequent screening against AGE2 (glyceraldehyde&#8208;modified AGE)&#8208;sRAGE (solubleRAGE) (AGE2&#8208;BSA/sRAGE) interaction using ELISA tests led to the identification of antagonists with micromolar potency. Our findings not only demonstrate the successful application of ptDCC on RAGE but also highlight its potential to address the pressing need for alternative strategies for the development of small&#8208;molecule RAGE antagonists, an area of research that has experienced a slowdown in recent years.</dc:description>

         <title>Mapping the Catalytic&#8208;Space for the Reactivity of Metal&#8208;free Boron Nitride with O2 for H2O&#8208;Mediated Conversion of Methane to HCHO and CO</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The h&#8208;BN surface catalyzes the partial oxidation of methane to formaldehyde and carbon monoxide in presence of dioxygen. The surface catalytic&#8208;space of h&#8208;BN for the methane oxidation is demonstrated with numerous pathways. Distortion/interaction and orbital analysis are utilized to rationalize the activation barriers. Water plays an intriguing role in HCHO and CO formation.







Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal based catalysts have been widely employed to catalyze partial oxidation of light alkanes. Recently, metal&#8208;free hexagonal&#8208;boron nitride (h&#8208;BN) has emerged as a promising catalyst for the oxidation of CH4 to HCHO and CO; however, the intricate catalytic surface of h&#8208;BN at molecular and electronic levels remains inadequately understood. Key questions include how electron&#8208;deficient boron atoms in h&#8208;BN reduce O2, and whether the partial oxidation of methane over h&#8208;BN exhibits similarities to traditional transition&#8208;metal catalysts. In our study, we computationally&#8208;mapped in&#8208;detail the surface catalytic&#8208;space of h&#8208;BN for methane oxidation. We considered different structures of h&#8208;BN and show that these structures contain numerous sites for O2 binding and therefore various routes for methane oxidation are possible. The activation barriers for methane oxidation via various paths varies from ~83 to ~123&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1. To comprehend the differences in activation barriers, we employed geometrical, orbital and distortion/interaction analysis (DIA). Orbital analysis reveals that methane activation over h&#8208;BN in presence of dioxygen follows a standard hydrogen atom transfer mechanism. It is also shown that water plays an intriguing role in reducing the barrier for HCHO and CO formation by acting as a bridge.

     alt="Mapping the Catalytic-Space for the Reactivity of Metal-free Boron Nitride with O2 for H2O-Mediated Conversion of Methane to HCHO and CO"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;i&gt;h&lt;/i&gt;-BN surface catalyzes the partial oxidation of methane to formaldehyde and carbon monoxide in presence of dioxygen. The surface catalytic-space of &lt;i&gt;h&lt;/i&gt;-BN for the methane oxidation is demonstrated with numerous pathways. Distortion/interaction and orbital analysis are utilized to rationalize the activation barriers. Water plays an intriguing role in HCHO and CO formation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transition-metal based catalysts have been widely employed to catalyze partial oxidation of light alkanes. Recently, metal-free &lt;i&gt;hexagonal&lt;/i&gt;-boron nitride (&lt;i&gt;h&lt;/i&gt;-BN) has emerged as a promising catalyst for the oxidation of CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; to HCHO and CO; however, the intricate catalytic surface of &lt;i&gt;h&lt;/i&gt;-BN at molecular and electronic levels remains inadequately understood. Key questions include how electron-deficient boron atoms in &lt;i&gt;h&lt;/i&gt;-BN reduce O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and whether the partial oxidation of methane over &lt;i&gt;h&lt;/i&gt;-BN exhibits similarities to traditional transition-metal catalysts. In our study, we computationally-mapped in-detail the surface catalytic-space of &lt;i&gt;h&lt;/i&gt;-BN for methane oxidation. We considered different structures of &lt;i&gt;h&lt;/i&gt;-BN and show that these structures contain numerous sites for O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; binding and therefore various routes for methane oxidation are possible. The activation barriers for methane oxidation via various paths varies from ~83 to ~123&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. To comprehend the differences in activation barriers, we employed geometrical, orbital and distortion/interaction analysis (DIA). Orbital analysis reveals that methane activation over &lt;i&gt;h&lt;/i&gt;-BN in presence of dioxygen follows a standard hydrogen atom transfer mechanism. It is also shown that water plays an intriguing role in reducing the barrier for HCHO and CO formation by acting as a bridge.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>An Efficient C&#8722;Si/C&#8722;H Cross&#8208;Coupling Reaction Enabled by a Radical Pathway</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The aryl radical from sulfonium salts have been generated through copper&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed processes, which enable the successful biaryl transformation through the addition to the aryl(trialkyl)silanes for the first time. Given the fast development in the copper catalysis, this method is expected to present new opportunities for exploring aryl(trialkyl)silanes in biaryl synthesis.







Abstract
The methods for the cross&#8208;coupling of aryl(trialkyl)silanes are long&#8208;standing challenges due to the extreme inertness of C&#8722;Si(R3) bond, though the reaction is environmentally friendly and highly regioselective to synthesize biaryls. Herein, we report a copper&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling of aryl(trialkyl)silanes and aryl via a radical mechanism. The reaction proceeds efficiently with aryl sulfonium salts as limiting reagents, exhibits broad substrate scope, and provides an important synthetic strategy to acquire biaryls, exemplified by unsymmetrical fluorescence probes and late&#8208;stage functionalization of drugs. Of note, the experimental and theoretical mechanistic studies revealed a radical mechanism where the copper catalyst and CsF play critical roles on the radical generation and desilylation process.

         <title>Binding of Acetylated Lysine by Using a Water Soluble Aryl Extended Calix[4]pyrrole</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The selective molecular recognition properties of two different calix[4]pyrrole receptors toward the cis isomer of acetylated lysine (cis&#8208;Kac) are investigated. The formation of a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 complex is favoured for the aryl&#8208;extended receptor compared to the superaryl&#8208;extended featuring a deeper cavity for which the energetically not favourable desolvation of the aminoacidic group hampers the guest inclusion in the hydrophobic cavity.







Abstract
Post&#8208;translational modifications of lysine in histones, as methylation and acetylation, have well established functions in epigenetics and are emerging as important actors in broader biological regulation. Currently, the detection of acetylated lysine (Kac) in water solution as free amino acid or protein residue remains challenging. Acetylated lysine is a neutral amino acid, and the lack of ion&#8211;dipole interactions causes the decrease in binding affinity displayed by synthetic molecular receptors with respect to the other lysine modifications. Here, we report molecular modeling calculations and 1H&#8197;NMR experiments to investigate the binding properties of two different calix[4]pyrrole receptors towards Kac. Computational analyses reveal that tetra&#8208;aryl&#8208;extended calix[4]pyrrole (1) preferentially binds the cis&#8208;Kac conformer over the trans one due to steric considerations and more favorable interactions. Experimental 1H&#8197;NMR titration experiments confirm the formation of a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 complex between receptor&#8197;1 and cis&#8208;Kac, with a Ka exceeding 103&#8197;M&#8722;1. Conversely, the super&#8208;aryl&#8208;extended calix[4]pyrrole 2 is less efficient in binding Kac, due to unfavorable solvation/desolvation effects, as proven by 1H&#8197;NMR experiments. Moreover, receptor&#8197;1 showed a higher affinity for Kac over other lysine modifications, such as methylated lysines.

         <title>The Origin of Dual&#8208;Emission in PLICT Compounds &#8211; an Empirical Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dual&#8208;emitting PLICT compounds based on cyano&#8208;1&#8208;aminoindole structures and exploration of their fluorescence behavior are presented. Combination of experimental studies, theoretical calculations, and a unique fluorophore cataloging map allows for the easy determination of the origin of fluorescence bands.







Abstract
Fluorescence spectroscopy proves to be a powerful and versatile tool in scientific research, demanding ongoing advancements of fluorescence probes to cater to a broad range of applications. The particular interest lies in the development of fluorophores with multiplexing capability, emitting from more than one excited state depending on the polarity and viscosity of the surrounding medium. Here, we present a variety of novel dual planarized intramolecular charge transfer (PLICT) emitters based on cyano&#8208;1&#8208;aminoindole structures. We have chosen a combination of experimental studies, theoretical calculations and the creation of a unique fluorophore cataloging map. This map serves as a useful tool for empirically determining the origin of both fluorescence bands.

         <title>Transport Properties with Multiple Functions of Fe@C60&#8208;GNR Single Molecule</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The transport properties of a series of double&#8208;layered Fe@C60&#8208;GNR devices have been designed. It gives deep insight into the experimental discoveries, and provides theoretical guidance for optimizing the transport properties of the Fe@C60&#8208;GNR devices.







Abstract
Encouraged by the successful fabrication of C60&#8208;GNR (GNR=graphene nanoribbon) single&#8208;molecule transistors in experiments, four Fe&#8208;containing derived double&#8208;layered devices of Fe@C60&#8208;GNR are designed by employing different electrode linkages and their transport properties are investigated by using density functional theory (DFT) and nonequilibrium Green's function (NEGF) methods. Regardless of electrode connection, all these devices give rise to a smaller negative differential resistance (NDR) peak at V=0.2 and a higher peak at 1.2&#8197;V, suggesting their stable maneuverability as molecular devices and good candidates for developing on(off)&#8208;off(on)&#8208;on(off) current switches. The macroscopic NDR performance depends on the delocalization character and the crossing mechanism of the frontier orbitals. The peak&#8208;to&#8208;valley current ratios (Rmax) range from 454 to 2737, determined by the electrode linkage. Such a large Rmax&#8208;value is necessary for developing dynamic random&#8208;access memory (DRAM) cells. Encapsulating the Fe atom inside C60 not only improves the conductivity but also introduces the spin&#8208;polarized transport property. The spin&#8208;filtering efficiency (SFE) of almost all devices oscillates up and down in response to the bias voltage, indicating the possibility of designing on(off)&#8208;off(on)&#8208;on(off) spin switches and up&#8208;down spin switches. All these fascinating properties provide an important clue for designing similar molecular devices with multiple functions by trapping magnetic transition metal atoms inside fullerenes.

         <title>A Nanoplatform Based on Pillar[5]arene Nanovalves for Combined Drug Delivery and Enhanced Antitumor Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pillar[5]arene&#8208;based nanovalves improved drug loading capacity and endowed the nanoplatforms with dual pH/light responsiveness. The loaded DOX and GOx successfully achieved combined chemo/starvation cancer therapy with better tumor suppression compared to single chemotherapy, providing a new approach for cancer treatment.







Abstract
Modern nanodrug delivery technologies offer new approaches in the fight against cancer. However, due to the heterogeneity of tumors and side effects of anticancer drugs, monotherapies are less effective. Herein, we report a novel pH and light dual&#8208;responsive nanodrug delivery platform. The platform was formed by sulfonate&#8208;modified gold nanoparticles loaded with the anticancer drugs doxorubicin (DOX) and glucose oxidase (GOx) and then covered by water&#8208;soluble pillar[5]arene as a nanovalve. The nanovalve formed by the host&#8208;guest interaction between pillar[5]arene and the sulfonic acid group grafted onto the gold nanoparticle increased the drug loading capacity of the nanoplatform and enabled sustained release of the drug in a simulated weakly acidic tumor environment. The released GOx can consume intracellular glucose, namely, starvation therapy, while the generated hydrogen peroxide can further kill tumor cells, complementing DOX chemotherapy. Gold nanoparticles have good photothermal conversion ability and can enhance the drugs release rate under specific wavelengths of light irradiation. The results of in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo experiments showed that this novel nanodrug delivery platform has good biocompatibility and better therapeutic efficacy relative to monotherapy. This study successfully developed a combined chemo/starvation therapy strategy with good tumor suppression, providing a new approach for cancer treatment.

         <title>Kinetic Resolution of Secondary Alcohols Catalyzed at the Exterior of Chiral Coordinated Capsules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The confinement of the chiral space inside a molecular host is an ideal platform for enantioselective reactions. However, this concept significantly limits the scope of reactants because reactants must be trapped inside molecular hosts. Instead, we utilized the exteriors of chiral molecular capsules as chiral sources and realized the kinetic resolution of secondary alcohols.







Abstract
Confined spaces inside molecular hosts can function as reaction vessels. However, this concept significantly limits the scope of reactants. When the exterior of molecular hosts is used instead, we can ease the restriction because reactants are not necessary to be trapped inside molecular hosts, although studies along this line have not been reported. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept of enantioselective reactions at the exterior of chiral molecular hosts, we utilized host&#8208;guest complexes of enantiomerically enriched Cu&#8208;coordinated capsules and guests possessing a catalytic center to realize the kinetic resolution of secondary alcohols. Under suitable reaction conditions, a selectivity factor of 2.6 was realized, demonstrating that the reactions occur at the exterior of the capsules. A series of experiments indicated that the substituents on the 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridyl arms and the alkyl chains on the lower rim contributed to the enantioselectivity of the reactions.

         <title>Convergent Synthesis of the Nonreducing Hexasaccharide Fragment and the Dodecasaccharide Scaffold of Marine Lipopolysaccharide Axinelloside A</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A convergent synthesis of properly protected dodecasaccharide backbone of axinelloside A was accomplished by virtue of an Au(I)&#8208;catalyzed [6+6] glycosylation. The 1,2&#8208;cis configuration of the glycosidic bonds was well controlled by judicious choice of protecting groups as well as promotion conditions.







Abstract
A convergent synthesis of the dodecasaccharide scaffold of axinelloside A was achieved through Au(I)&#8208;catalyzed [6+6] glycosylation. The initially devised [3+1+2] assembly of the nonreducing hexasaccharide fragment was low&#8208;yielding, whereas a convergent [3+3] glycosylation under Au(I) catalysis was proven feasible, allowing for a semi&#8208;gram scale preparation of the wanted hexasaccharide. The requisite 1,2&#8208;cis glycosidic bonds were forged in a highly stereoselective fashion by virtue of remote acetyl group participation, and judicious manipulation of protecting groups. The synthetic dodecasaccharide has been properly protected for the downstream elaboration toward its natural form.

         <title>Accessing Rare &#945;&#8208;Heterocyclic Aziridines via Br&#248;nsted Acid&#8208;catalyzed Michael Addition/Annulation: Scope, Limitations, and Mechanism</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report an approach to the diastereoselective synthesis of 1,2&#8208;disubstituted heterocyclic aziridines. A Br&#248;nsted acid&#8208;catalyzed conjugate addition of anilines to trisubstituted heterocyclic chloroalkenes provides an intermediate 1,2&#8208;chloroamine. Diastereocontrol was found to vary significantly with solvent selection, with computational modelling confirming selective, spontaneous fragmentation in the presence of trace acids, proceeding through a pseudo&#8208;cyclic, protonated intermediate and transition state. These chloroamines can then be converted to the aziridine by treatment with LiHMDS with high stereochemical fidelity. This solvent&#8208;induced stereochemical enrichment thereby enables an efficient route to rare cis&#8208;aziridines with high dr. The scope, limitations, and mechanistic origins of selectivity are also presented.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrochemical Dearomatizing Methoxylation of Phenols and Naphthols: Synthetic and Computational Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrochemical oxidative dearomatizing methoxylation of phenols and naphthols was developed. It provides an alternative route for the preparation of methoxycyclohexadienones, important and versatile synthetic intermediates, that eliminates the need for stoichiometric high&#8208;energy chemical oxidants and generates hydrogen as a sole by&#8208;product. The reaction proceeds in a simple constant current mode, in an undivided cell, and it employs standardized instrumentation. A collection of methoxycyclohexadienones derived from various 2,4,6&#8208;tri&#8208;substituted phenols and 1&#8208;substituted&#8208;2&#8208;naphthols was obtained in moderate to excellent yields. These include a complex derivative of estrone, as well as methoxylated dearomatized 1,1&#8242;&#8208;bi&#8208;2&#8208;naphthols (BINOLs). The mechanism of the reaction was subject to profound investigations using density functional theory calculations. In particular, the reactivity of two key intermediates, phenoxyl radical and phenoxenium ion, was carefully examined. The obtained results shed light on the pathway leading to the desired product and rationalize experimentally observed selectivities regarding a side benzylic methoxylation and the preference for the functionalization at the para over the ortho position. They also uncover the structure&#8208;selectivity relationship, inversely correlating the steric bulk of the substrate with its propensity to undergo the side&#8208;reaction. Moreover, the loss of stereochemical information from enantiopure BINOL substrates during the reaction is rationalized by the computations.</dc:description>

         <title>Artificial Processive Catalytic Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Processive catalysts remain attached to a substrate and perform multiple rounds of catalysis. They are abundant in nature. This review highlights artificial processive catalytic systems, which can be divided into (A) catalytic rings that move along a polymer chain, (B) catalytic pores that hold polymer chains and decompose them, (C) catalysts that remain attached to and move around a cyclic substrate via supramolecular interactions, and (D) anchored catalysts that remain in contact with a substrate via multiple catalytic interactions (see frontispiece).</dc:description>

         <title>Impact of the Methylene Bridge Substitution in Chelating NHC&#8208;Phosphine Mn(I) Catalyst for Ketone Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Systematic modification of the chelating NHC&#8208;phosphine ligand (NHC = N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene) in highly efficient ketone hydrogenation Mn(I) catalyst fac&#8208;[(Ph2PCH2NHC)Mn(CO)3Br] has been performed and the catalytic activity of the resulting complexes was evaluated using acetophenone as a benchmark substrate. While the variation of phosphine and NHC moieties led to inferior results than for a parent system, the incorporation of a phenyl substituent into the ligand methylene bridge improved catalytic performance by ca. 3 times providing maximal TON values in the range of 15000&#8208;20000. Mechanistic investigation combining experimental and computational studies allowed to rationalize this beneficial effect as an enhanced stabilization of reaction intermediates including anionic hydride species fac&#8208;[(Ph2PC(Ph)NHC)Mn(CO)3H]&#8722; playing a crucial role in the hydrogenation process. These results highlight the interest of such carbon bridge substitution strategy being rarely employed in the design of chemically non&#8208;innocent ligands.</dc:description>

         <title>Poly(vinyl chloride) Dechlorination Catalyzed by Zirconium</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Poly(vinyl chloride) undergoes dechlorination in the presence of triethylsilane (Et3SiH) and a catalytic amount of [Cp2Zr(NPh2)][CH3B(C6F5)3] (1b) at 40&#8208;80 &#176;C, with up to 91 % efficiency. Stoichiometric reactivity studies conducted on cyclohexyl chloride as a model suggest that 1b dechlorinates PVC by initial chloride abstraction, followed by hydride transfer to the cationic PVC chain from Et3SiH. Consumer items such as pipe fitting, vinyl disc or electric cable insulation undergo either dechlorination or hydrosilylation of the carbonyl&#8208;containing copolymer (polyvinyl acetate) or plasticizer (phthalate).</dc:description>

         <title>A Simple Manganese(I) Catalyst for the Efficient and Selective Hydrophosphination of Olefins with PH3, Primary, and Secondary Phosphanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A tridentate ligand L with a P,NH,N donor motif was synthesized in few steps from commercially available precursors. Upon reaction with [MnBr(CO)5], an octahedral 18&#8208;electron complex [Mn(CO)3(L)]Br (1) is obtained in which L adopts a facial arrangement. Deprotonation of the NH group leads under loss of CO to a neutral Mn(I) amide complex [Mn(CO)2(L&#8208;H)] (2), which has a trigonal bipyramidal structure with the P and N donor centers are in trans position. Further deprotonation of 2 gives the deep&#8208;blue anion [Mn(CO)2(L&#8208;2H)]&#8208; (3). DFT calculations and QTAIM analyses show that 2 contains a Mn&#8211;N bond with partial double bond character and 3 an aromatic MnN2C2 ring. The anion [Mn(CO)2(L&#8208;2H)]&#8208; reacts with Ph2PH to give a phosphido complex, which serves as phosphide transfer reagent to activated olefins with low catalytic activity. However, the neutral amide complex 2 is an excellent catalyst and with 0.04 mol%, turn over frequencies of &gt;40&#8217;000 h&#8209;1 can be achieved. Furthermore, secondary and primary alkyl phosphines as well as PH3 can be added in a catalytic hydrophosphination reaction to a wide range of activated olefins such as &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes, ketones, esters, and nitriles. But also, vinyl pyridine and some styrene derivatives are converted into the corresponding phosphanes.</dc:description>

         <title>Silver&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Double Desymmetrization via Vinylogous Michael Addition of Prochiral &#945;,&#945;&#8208;Dicyanoalkenes to Cyclopentendiones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An asymmetric double desymmetrization methodology has been developed for synthesizing densely functionalized chiral cyclopentylcyclohexane scaffolds. We have constructed four chiral centers, including an all&#8208;carbon quaternary stereocenter in a single C&#8208;C bond formation event. The methodology has high functional&#8208;group tolerance and delivers a broad range of enantioenriched products. This vinylogous Michael addition reaction of prochiral &#945;,&#945;&#8208;dicyanocyclohexane to 2,2&#8208;disubstituted cyclopentene&#8208;1,3&#8208;dione is catalyzed by a chiral Ag&#8208;(R)&#8208;DTBM&#8208;SEGPHOS catalyst.</dc:description>

         <title>Dansylated Nitrile N&#8208;Oxide as the Fluorescent Dye Clickable to Unsaturated Bonds without Catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorescent polymeric materials have been exploited in the fields of aesthetical purposes, biomedical engineering, and three&#8208;dimensional printing applications.&#160; While the fluorescent materials are prepared by the polymerization of fluorescent monomer or the blending a fluorescent dye with common polymer, the covalent immobilization of fluorescent dye onto common polymers is not the practical technique.&#160; In this paper, dansylated nitrile N&#8208;oxide (Dansyl&#8208;NO) has been designed and synthesized to be a stable nitrile N&#8208;oxide as the derivative of 2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;1&#8208;naphthaldehyde.&#160; While Dansyl&#8208;NO shows good reactivity to an alkene and an alkyne to give fluorescent Dansyl&#8208;Ene and Dansyl&#8208;Yne, respectively, it hardly reacts to a nitrile.&#160; The results indicate that Dansyl&#8208;NO serves as a fluorescent dye clickable to alkenes and alkynes.&#160; To know the effects of solvent on the fluorescent properties, the UV&#8208;vis and fluorescence spectra of Dansyl&#8208;Ene are measured in three solvents.&#160; Dansyl&#8208;Ene shows fluorescent solvatochromism, which appears to be red&#8208;shifted along with the increase in solvent polarity.&#160; Poly(styrene&#8208;co&#8208;butadiene) directly reacts with Dansyl&#8208;NO to give fluorescent modified SB.&#160; The emission spectrum of modified SB is blue&#8208;shifted compared with that of Dansyl&#8208;Ene.&#160; The blue&#8208;shift could be possibly attributed to the presence of less polar polymer skeleton around the dansyl moieties of modified SB.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Dynamics of Steroidal Rotors Probed by Theoretical, Spectroscopic and Dielectric Methods</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Our study focuses on molecular rotors with fast&#8208;moving rotators and their potential applications in the development of new amphidynamic crystals. Steroidal molecular rotors with a dipolar fluorine&#8208;substituted phenyl group as the rotator were synthesized and characterized. Three different rotors were investigated with varying numbers of fluorine atoms. A comprehensive analysis was performed using vibrational spectroscopy (Raman, FT&#8208;IR), electronic circular dichroism (ECD), and dielectric response to understand the behavior of the investigated model rotors. The results were supported by theoretical calculations using Density Functional Theory (DFT) methods. The angle&#8208;dependent polarized Raman spectra confirmed the crystallinity of the samples. Nearly frequency and temperature&#8208;independent permittivity suggest low&#8208;frequency librational motion of stators. An in&#8208;depth analysis of ECD spectra revealed high conformational flexibility in solution, resulting in low ECD effects, while in the solid&#8208;state with restricted rotation, significant ECD effects were observed. These findings shed light on the conformational behavior and potential applications of the studied steroidal molecular rotors.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural Design of 3D Current Collectors for Lithium Metal Anodes: A Review</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Due to the ultrahigh theoretical specific capacity (3860 mAh g&#8208;1) and low redox potential (&#8208;3.04 V vs. standard hydrogen electrode), Lithium (Li) metal anode (LMA) received increasing attentions. However, notorious dendrite and volume expansion during the cycling process seriously hinder the development of high energy density Li metal batteries. Constructing three&#8208;dimensional (3D) current collectors for Li can fundamentally solve the intrinsic drawback of hostless for Li. Therefore, this review systematically introduces the design and synthesis engineering and the current development status of different 3D collectors in recent years (the current collectors are divided into two major parts: metal&#8208;based current collectors and carbon&#8208;based current collectors). In the end, some perspectives of the future promotion for LMA application are also presented.</dc:description>

         <title>In&#8722;situ  confining selenium within bubble&#8722;like carbon nanoshells for ultra&#8722;stable Li&#8722;Se batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium&#8208;selenium (Li&#8208;Se) batteries are promising energy storage devices. However, the long&#8208;term durability and high&#8208;rate performance of the Se cathode have been limited by significant volume expansion and the troublesome shuttle effect of polyselenides during repeated charging/discharging processes. To revolutionize these issues, we applied a top&#8208;down strategy through the in&#8208;situ trapping of amorphous Se within bubble&#8208;like carbon (BLC) frameworks, which can radically minimize the presence of surface&#8208;absorbed Se while enhancing Se loading capacity. This ingenious technique successfully encapsulates all Se species within carbon nanoshells, creating a distinct half&#8208;filled core&#8208;shell structure known as Se@void@BLC. This in&#8208;situ trapping approach ensures the efficient management of Se volume changes during repeated discharge and charge cycles. Moreover, an extraordinary Se loading capacity of up to 65.6wt% is reached. Using the Se@void@BLC as cathode for Li&#8722;Se battery, we achieve a high initial Columbic efficiency of 84.2%, a high reversible capacity of 585 mAh g&#8722;1, and an ultralow capacity decay of only 0.0037 % per cycle during 4000 cycles at 10 A g&#8722;1.</dc:description>

         <title>Azaphosphinate Dyes: A Low Molecular Weight Near&#8208;Infrared Scaffold for Development of Photoacoustic or Fluorescence Imaging Probes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a new class of NIR dyes termed azaphosphinate NR dyes with desirable properties including low molecular weight, absorption/emission above 750&#8197;nm, and remarkable water solubility. Derivatives of these dyes can be used for photoacoustic or fluorescence imaging, providing a new NIR scaffold for the design of imaging probes.







Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) dyes are desirable for biological imaging applications including photoacoustic (PA) and fluorescence imaging. Nonetheless, current NIR dyes are often plagued by relatively large molecular weights, poor water solubility, and limited photostability. Herein, we provide the first examples of azaphosphinate dyes which display desirable properties such as low molecular weight, absorption/emission above 750&#8197;nm, and remarkable water solubility. In PA imaging, an azaphosphinate dye exhibited a 4.1&#8208;fold enhancement in intensity compared to commonly used standards, the ability to multiplex with existing dyes in whole blood, imaging depths of 2.75&#8197;cm in a tissue model, and contrast in mice. An improved derivative for fluorescence imaging displayed a &gt;10&#8208;fold reduction in photobleaching in water compared to the FDA&#8208;approved indocyanine green dye and could be visualized in mice. This new dye class provides a robust scaffold for the development of photoacoustic or NIR fluorescence imaging agents.

         <title>Mn(II) Promoted Divergent&#8208;Convergent Domino Reaction Giving Dinuclear Tetrasubstituted Pyrrole Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new domino reaction sequence has been realized between chelating heteroaryl methanamine and cheap and simple Mn(II) salt, leading to 2,3,4,5&#8208;tetrasubstituted pyrrole coordinated dinuclear Mn(II) complex. The reaction process has been studied and a six&#8208;step domino sequence involving the convergent [3+2] cycloaddition between imine and alkene/alkyne which were formed divergently from starting amine has been proposed.







Abstract
Domino reaction of benzo[d]thiazole&#8208;2&#8208;methylamine (S1) has been developed in the presence of MnCl2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;4H2O, leading to tetrasubstituted pyrrole coordinated dinuclear Mn(II) complex 1 ([MnClP]2, P&#8722;=2,3,4,5&#8208;tetrakis(benzo[d]thiazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)pyrrol&#8208;1&#8208;ide). The reaction process has been studied by assigning a series of intermediates based on time&#8208;dependent mass spectrometry, control experiments, crystallography, and density functional theory (DFT) theoretical calculation. A plausible mechanism involving an unprecedented divergent&#8208;convergent domino sequence has been proposed. Compound S1 could be activated by MnCl2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;4H2O via coordination, which divergently produces two intermediates imine II (1&#8208;(benzo[d]thiazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;N&#8208;(benzo[d]thiazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylmethyl)methanimine) and alkene C (1,2&#8208;bis(benzo[d]thiazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)ethene) through oxidative self&#8208;condensation and free radical coupling followed by elimination, respectively. They could then react with each other convergently via formal [3+2] cycloaddition to give deprotonated tetrasubstituted pyrrole coordinated intermediate [MnClP] after aromatization. Dimerization of [MnClP] produces the final product 1. Three C&#8722;C bonds and one C&#8722;N bond are formed through this six&#8208;step domino sequence. The corresponding organic skeleton (HP: 2,2&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;(1H&#8208;pyrrole&#8208;2,3,4,5&#8208;tetrayl)tetrakis(benzo[d]thiazole)) has been obtained from 1 and shows a higher fluorescent quantum yield (52&#8201;%) than the reported 3,4&#8208;diphenyl substituted analogue 2,2&#8242;&#8208;(3,4&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;1H&#8208;pyrrole&#8208;2,5&#8208;diyl)bis(benzo[d]thiazole) (DPB) (42&#8201;%).

A plausible mechanism involving an unprecedented divergent-convergent domino sequence has been proposed. Compound &lt;b&gt;S1&lt;/b&gt; could be activated by MnCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;4H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O via coordination, which divergently produces two intermediates imine &lt;b&gt;II&lt;/b&gt; (1-(benzo&lt;i&gt;[d]&lt;/i&gt;thiazol-2-yl)-N-(benzo&lt;i&gt;[d]&lt;/i&gt;thiazol-2-ylmethyl)methanimine) and alkene &lt;b&gt;C&lt;/b&gt; (1,2-bis(benzo&lt;i&gt;[d]&lt;/i&gt;thiazol-2-yl)ethene) through oxidative self-condensation and free radical coupling followed by elimination, respectively. They could then react with each other convergently via formal [3+2] cycloaddition to give deprotonated tetrasubstituted pyrrole coordinated intermediate &lt;b&gt;[MnClP]&lt;/b&gt; after aromatization. Dimerization of &lt;b&gt;[MnClP]&lt;/b&gt; produces the final product &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;. Three C&#8722;C bonds and one C&#8722;N bond are formed through this six-step domino sequence. The corresponding organic skeleton (&lt;b&gt;HP&lt;/b&gt;: 2,2&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;-(1H-pyrrole-2,3,4,5-tetrayl)tetrakis(benzo&lt;i&gt;[d]&lt;/i&gt;thiazole)) has been obtained from &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; and shows a higher fluorescent quantum yield (52&#8201;%) than the reported 3,4-diphenyl substituted analogue 2,2&#8242;-(3,4-diphenyl-1H-pyrrole-2,5-diyl)bis(benzo&lt;i&gt;[d]&lt;/i&gt;thiazole) (&lt;b&gt;DPB&lt;/b&gt;) (42&#8201;%).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Three&#8208;Dimensional Non&#8208;Fullerene Acceptor with Contorted Hexabenzocoronene and Perylenediimide for Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A conjugated molecular HBC&#8208;4&#8208;PDI with three&#8208;dimensional geometry is synthesized and applied as a non&#8208;fullerene acceptor material in the active layer of organic solar cells.







Abstract
Although fullerene derivatives such as [6,6]&#8208;phenyl&#8208;C61/C71&#8208;butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM/PC71BM) have dominated the the photoactive acceptor materials in bulk heterojunction organic solar cells (OSCs) for decades, they have several drawbacks such as weak absorption, limited structural tunability, prone to aggregation, and high costs of production. Constructing non&#8208;fullerene small molecules with three&#8208;dimensional (3D) molecular geometry is one of the strategies to replace fullerenes in OSCs. In this study, a 3D molecule, contorted hexa&#8208;cata&#8208;hexabenzocoronene tetra perylenediimide (HBC&#8208;4&#8208;PDI), was designed and synthesized. HBC&#8208;4&#8208;PDI shows a wide and strong light absorption in the whole UV&#8208;vis region as well as suitable energy levels as an acceptor for OSCs. More importantly, the 3D construction effectively reduced the self&#8208;aggregation of c&#8208;HBC, leading to an appropriate scale phase separation of the blend film morphology in OSCs. A preliminary power conversion efficiency of 2.70&#8201;% with a champion open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.06&#8197;V was obtained in OSCs with HBC&#8208;4&#8208;PDI as the acceptor, which was the highest among the previously reported OSCs based on c&#8208;HBC derivatives. The results indicated that HBC&#8208;4&#8208;PDI may serve as a good non&#8208;fullerene acceptor for OSCs.

         <title>Naphthalimide&#8208;based Functional Glycopolymeric Nanoparticles as Fluorescent Probes for Selective Imaging of Tumor Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Naphthalimide&#8208;based glycopolymeric nanoparticles with dual tumor&#8208;targeting ability from glucose&#8208;segment and phenylboronic ester modification were designed and used as pH sensitive and AIEgen fluorescent probes for selective imaging of tumor cells.







Abstract
A series of functional glycopolymer nanoparticles with 1,8&#8208;naphthalimide motif was designed, synthesized and applied for tumor cell imaging. With the pH&#8208;sensitive and aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) effect of the 1,8&#8208;naphthalimide fluorescent probe, the presence of glucose&#8208;based glycopolymers enhanced its water&#8208;solubility and biocompatibility. Owing to the dual tumor&#8208;targeting effects of the dense glucose part and the boronic ester modification, the obtained glycopolymers showed high affinity to tumor cells, with a much faster staining rate than normal cells, indicating a great potential for diagnosis and treatments of cancers.

         <title>Electrochemical Diselenation of BODIPY Fluorophores for Bioimaging Applications and Sensitization of 1O2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rapid and efficient approach with a broad scope for the late&#8208;stage electrochemical diselenation of BODIPYs is reported. The selenium&#8208;containing BODIPYs can stain lipid droplets selectively, exhibiting fluorescence in both green and red channels. The Se&#8208;functionalized BODIPYs exhibit larger Stokes shifts than their precursors, and sensitization of 1O2 from triplet states formed by competitive intersystem crossing, which makes them suitable for bioimaging studies and, potentially, and simultaneously, for photodynamic therapy. The electrochemical synthetic method offers an efficient and versatile alternative for the preparation of Se&#8208;functionalized fluorescent compounds with relevant physicochemical and biological profiles. More information can be found in the Research Article by H. Braunschweig, E.&#8197;N. da&#8197;Silva&#8197;J&#250;nior, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202303883).

         <title>Regioselective Partial Hydrogenation and Deuteration of Tetracyclic (Hetero)aromatic Systems Using a Simple Heterogeneous Catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of added &#8216;3&#8208;dimensionality&#8217; through late&#8208;stage functionalisation is a powerful synthetic approach to biologically significant moieties. Herein, a hydrogenative, regioselective dearomatisation of extended (hetero)aromatic systems is described, using a simple Pd catalyst at atmospheric hydrogen pressure. Deuteration is also demonstrated and some initial mechanistic insights are revealed.







Abstract
The introduction of added &#8216;3&#8208;dimensionality&#8217; through late&#8208;stage functionalisation of extended (hetero)aromatic systems is a powerful synthetic approach. The abundance of starting materials and cross&#8208;coupling methodologies to access the precursors allows for highly diverse products. Subsequent selective partial reduction can alter the core structure in a manner of interest to medicinal chemists. Herein, we describe the precise, partial reduction of multicyclic heteroaromatic systems using a simple heterogeneous catalyst. The approach can be extended to introduce deuterium (again at late&#8208;stage). Excellent yields can be obtained using simple reaction conditions.

         <title>Aptamer Clicked Poly(ferrocenylsilanes) at Au Nanoparticles as Platforms with Multiple Function[&#8224;]</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Table of Contents: We present a novel poly(ferrocenylsilane)&#8208;gold nanoparticle (PFS&#8208;AuNP) system for aptamer grafting. A multi&#8208;responsive aptamer&#8208;AuNP platform is described. This platform possesses high colloidal stability in high ionic strength environments and exhibits both a redox response and the specific sensitivity of the aptamer.







Abstract
Aptamers are widely used in biosensing due to their specific sensitivity toward many targets. Thus, gold nanoparticle (AuNP) aptasensors are subject to intense research due to the complementary properties of aptamers as sensing elements and AuNPs as transducers. We present herein a novel method for the functional coupling of thrombin&#8208;specific aptamers to AuNPs via an anionic, redox&#8208;active poly(ferrocenylsilane) (PFS) polyelectroyte. The polymer acts as a co&#8208;reductant and stabilizer for the AuNPs, provides grafting sites for the aptamer, and can be used as a redox sensing element, making the aptamer&#8208;PFS&#8208;AuNP composite (aptamer&#8208;AuNP) a promising model system for future multifunctional sensors. The aptamer&#8208;AuNPs exhibit excellent colloidal stability in high ionic strength environments owing to the combined electrosteric stabilizing effects of the aptamer and the PFS. The synthesis of each assembly element is described, and the colloidal stability and redox responsiveness are studied. As an example to illustrate applications, we present results for thrombin sensitivity and specificity using the specific aptamer.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Table of Contents&lt;/b&gt;: We present a novel poly(ferrocenylsilane)-gold nanoparticle (PFS-AuNP) system for aptamer grafting. A multi-responsive aptamer-AuNP platform is described. This platform possesses high colloidal stability in high ionic strength environments and exhibits both a redox response and the specific sensitivity of the aptamer.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aptamers are widely used in biosensing due to their specific sensitivity toward many targets. Thus, gold nanoparticle (AuNP) aptasensors are subject to intense research due to the complementary properties of aptamers as sensing elements and AuNPs as transducers. We present herein a novel method for the functional coupling of thrombin-specific aptamers to AuNPs via an anionic, redox-active poly(ferrocenylsilane) (PFS) polyelectroyte. The polymer acts as a co-reductant and stabilizer for the AuNPs, provides grafting sites for the aptamer, and can be used as a redox sensing element, making the aptamer-PFS-AuNP composite (aptamer-AuNP) a promising model system for future multifunctional sensors. The aptamer-AuNPs exhibit excellent colloidal stability in high ionic strength environments owing to the combined electrosteric stabilizing effects of the aptamer and the PFS. The synthesis of each assembly element is described, and the colloidal stability and redox responsiveness are studied. As an example to illustrate applications, we present results for thrombin sensitivity and specificity using the specific aptamer.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Two Birds with One Stone: Polymerized Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Small Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymerized TADF small molecules capable of cost&#8208;effective solution processing are believed to bridge the efficiency gap between small molecules and polymers. And their recent progress is highlighted so as to shed light on the development of efficient TADF polymers.







Abstract
Thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) polymers show a great potential in low&#8208;cost, large&#8208;area and flexible full&#8208;color flat&#8208;panel displays. One of the most promising design rules is based on TADF+Linker, where a small molecular TADF unit is bonded to each other by a simple linker. Unlike the expensive vacuum deposition for small molecules, these polymerized TADF small molecules (Poly&#8208;TADF&#8208;SMs) are capable of cost&#8208;effective solution processing. Meanwhile, the good luminescent property of small molecular TADF emitters can be well inherited by Poly&#8208;TADF&#8208;SMs so as to bridge the efficiency gap between small molecules and polymers. Herein, we will highlight the recent progress of Poly&#8208;TADF&#8208;SMs, together with emphasis on their molecular design, photophysical and electroluminescence properties.

         <title>Gallaphosphene L(Cl)GaPGaL: A novel phosphinidene transfer reagent</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gallaphosphene 1 serves as a phosphinidene transfer reagent in reactions with RNHCs and isonitriles, to give RNHC&#8208;coordinated phosphinidenes 2 and 1,3&#8208;phosphaazaallenes 3, respectively. NHC&#8208;coordinated phosphinidene 2&#8201;b reacted with THF&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;BH3 with selective B&#8722;H bond activation to the unique NHC&#8208;stabilized borane complex 4.







Abstract
Gallaphosphene L(Cl)GaPGaL 1 (L=HC[C(Me)N(Ar)]2; Ar=2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3) reacts with N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes RNHC (RNHC=[CMeN(R)]2C; R=Me, iPr) to RNHC&#8208;coordinated phosphinidenes RNHC&#8594;PGa(Cl)L (R=Me 2&#8201;a, iPr 2&#8201;b) and with isonitriles RNC (R=iPr, Cy) to 1,3&#8208;phosphaazaallenes L(Cl)GaP=C=N&#8722;R (R=iPr 3&#8201;a, Cy 3&#8201;b), respectively. Quantum chemical calculations reveal that 2&#8201;a/2&#8201;b possess two localized lone pair of electrons, whereas 3&#8201;a/3&#8201;b only show one localized lone pair as was reported for gallaphosphene 1. 2&#8201;b reacts with 2.5&#8197;equivalents of a borane (THF&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;BH3) to the NHC&#8208;stabilized phosphinidene&#8208;borane complex [iPrNHC&#8594;P(BH2)]2(BH3)3 4 with concomitant formation of LGa(H)Cl 5. 2&#8211;5 are characterized by heteronuclear (1H, 13C{1H}, 31P{1H}) NMR and IR spectroscopy, elemental analysis, and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (sc&#8208;XRD).

         <dc:description>
An efficient, atom&#8208;economic synthesis for a family of thio&#8208;oligosaccharides related to C.&#8197;jejuni HS:4 capsular polysaccharide is facilitated by epoxide&#8208;mediated trans&#8208;thioglycosylation. Access to these thio&#8208;linked analogs, known to have enhanced metabolic stability, has the potential to boost immunogenicity, accelerating the development of a synthetic vaccine against C.&#8197;jejuni HS:4, a multi&#8208;drug&#8208;resistant pathogen ranked as a high priority by the WHO.

         <title>Oligo&#8208;Condensation Reactions of Silanediols with Conservation of Solid&#8208;State&#8208;Structural Features.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The thermal (solid&#8208; and liquid state) condensation of monosilanols and silanediols was studied spectroscopically and thermally. Furthermore, the thermally induced cleavage of aryl groups was also investigated. A conservation of the crystal structure of the silanediols in the condensed state could be shown by X&#8208;ray diffractometry in combination with their single crystal structure.







Abstract
Oligo&#8208; and polysiloxanes are usually prepared by condensation reactions in solvents without control of stereochemistry. Here we present a solventless thermal condensation of stable organosilanols. We investigated the condensation reactions of organosilanediols with different organic substituents, having in common at least one aromatic group. The condensation kinetics of the precursors observed by NMR spectroscopy revealed a strong dependence on temperature, time, and substitution pattern at the silicon atom. SEC measurements showed that chain length increases with increasing condensation temperature and time and lower steric demand of the substituents, which also influences the glass transition temperatures (Tg) of the resulting oligo&#8208; or polymers. X&#8208;ray diffraction studies of the crystalline silanediols and their condensation products revealed a structural correlation between the substituent location in the crystalline precursors and the formed macromolecules induced by the hydrogen bonding pattern. In certain cases, it is possible to carry out topotactic polymerization in the solid&#8208;state, which has its origin in the crystal structure.

         <dc:description>The conversion of an azacalixpyridine&#8208;supported Mo(0) tricarbonyl into a Mo(VI) trioxo complex with dioxygen (O2) is investigated in homogeneous solution and in a molecular film adsorbed on Au(111) using a variety of spectroscopic and analytical methods. These studies in particular show that the dome&#8208;shaped carbonyl complex adsorbed on the metal surface has the ability to bind and activate gaseous oxygen, overcoming the so&#8208;called surface trans&#8208;effect. Furthermore, the rate of the conversion dramatically increases by irradiation with light. This observation is explained with the help of complementary DFT calculations and attributed to two different pathways, a thermal and a photochemical one. Based on the experimental and theoretical findings, a molecular mechanism for the conversion of the carbonyl to the oxo complex is derived.</dc:description>

         <title>Simulating Non&#8208;Adiabatic Dynamics of Photoexcited Phenyl Azide: Investigating Electronic and Structural Relaxation en Route to the Formation of Phenyl Nitrene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 7, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photolysis of phenyl azide lead by coupled nuclear motion results in excited singlet photoproduct. Surface hopping simulations based on multi&#8208;reference model reveal that the second electronic excited state steers the N2 elimination, accompanied by synchronous bond elongation and angular rotation.







Abstract
Excited state molecular dynamics simulations of the photoexcited phenyl azide have been performed. The semi&#8208;classical surface hopping approximation has enabled an unconstrained analysis of the electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom which contribute to the molecular dissociation of phenyl azide into phenyl nitrene and molecular nitrogen. The significance of the second singlet excited state in leading the photodissociation has been established through electronic structure calculations, based on multi&#8208;configurational schemes, and state population dynamics. The investigations on the structural dynamics have revealed the N&#8722;N bond separation to be accompanied by synchronous changes in the azide N&#8722;N&#8722;N bond angle. The 100&#8197;fs simulation results in a nitrene fragment that is electronically excited in the singlet manifold.

Direct Synthesis of Phosphoryltriacetates from White Phosphorus via Visible Light Catalysis: The reaction of P4 with &#945;&#8208;bromo esters using fac&#8208;Ir(ppy)3 as the photocatalyst and blue LEDs (456&#8197;nm) as the light source was developed for the first time to afford a series of phosphoryltriacetates. This approach features mild reaction conditions and simple operational process without chlorination.







Abstract
Organophosphorus compounds (OPCs) are widely used in many fields. However, traditional synthetic routes in the industry usually involve multistep and hazardous procedures. Therefore, it's of great significance to construct such compounds in an environmentally&#8208;friendly and facile way. Herein, a photoredox catalytic method has been developed to construct novel phosphoryltriacetates. Using fac&#8208;Ir(ppy)3 (ppy=2&#8208;phenylpyridine) as the photocatalyst and blue LEDs (456&#8197;nm) as the light source, white phosphorus can react with &#945;&#8208;bromo esters smoothly to generate phosphoryltriacetates in moderate to good yields. This one&#8208;step approach features mild reaction conditions and simple operational process without chlorination.

         <title>Enhancing Triplet&#8208;Triplet Annihilation Upconversion of Pyrene Derivatives for Photoredox Catalysis via Molecular Engineering</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 7, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The highest efficient red&#8208;to&#8208;green upconversion is achieved in a TTA&#8208;UC pair consisted of PdTPTBP and pyrene derivative via molecular engineering. This pair is successfully used to activate photooxidation of aryl boronic acid under red light, and the reaction yield is greatly improved compared to green light, showing the advantage of TTA&#8208;UC in photoredox catalysis.







Abstract
Triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation upconversion (TTA&#8208;UC) has the potential to enhance photoredox catalysis yield. It includes a sensitizer and an annihilator. Efficient and stable annihilators are essential for photoredox catalysis, yet only a few examples are reported. Herein, we designed four novel pyrene annihilators (1, 2, 3 and 4) via introducing aryl&#8208;alkynyl groups onto pyrene to systematically modulate their singlet and triplet energies. Coupled with platinum octaethylporphyrin (PtOEP), the TTA&#8208;UC efficiency is enhanced gradually as the number of aryl&#8208;alkynyl group increases. When combining 4 with palladium tetraphenyl&#8208;tetrabenzoporphyrin (PdTPTBP), we achieved the highest red&#8208;to&#8208;green upconversion efficiency (22.4&#177;0.3&#8201;%) (out of a 50&#8201;% maximum) so far. Then, this pair was used to activate photooxidation of aryl boronic acid under red light (630&#8197;nm), which achieved a great improved reaction yield compared to that activated by green light directly. The results not only provide a design strategy for efficient annihilators, but also show the advantage of applying TTA&#8208;UC into improving the photoredox catalysis yield.

This pair is successfully used to activate photooxidation of aryl boronic acid under red light, and the reaction yield is greatly improved compared to green light, showing the advantage of TTA-UC in photoredox catalysis.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Triplet-triplet annihilation upconversion (TTA-UC) has the potential to enhance photoredox catalysis yield. It includes a sensitizer and an annihilator. Efficient and stable annihilators are essential for photoredox catalysis, yet only a few examples are reported. Herein, we designed four novel pyrene annihilators (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;) via introducing aryl-alkynyl groups onto pyrene to systematically modulate their singlet and triplet energies. Coupled with platinum octaethylporphyrin (PtOEP), the TTA-UC efficiency is enhanced gradually as the number of aryl-alkynyl group increases. When combining &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt; with palladium tetraphenyl-tetrabenzoporphyrin (PdTPTBP), we achieved the highest red-to-green upconversion efficiency (22.4&#177;0.3&#8201;%) (out of a 50&#8201;% maximum) so far. Then, this pair was used to activate photooxidation of aryl boronic acid under red light (630&#8197;nm), which achieved a great improved reaction yield compared to that activated by green light directly. The results not only provide a design strategy for efficient annihilators, but also show the advantage of applying TTA-UC into improving the photoredox catalysis yield.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Exploring the Influence of the Phosphorus&#8208;Heteroatom Substitution in Nicotine on Its Electronic and Vibrational Spectroscopic Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 7, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The impacts of the phosphorus&#8208;substituted heteroatom in heterocycles on the vibrational spectroscopy and structural properties of a molecule were investigated. It was observed that phosphorus substitution in the conformationally flexible ring in addition to changing the structural and conformational properties of a molecule was able to alter the VCD patterns of these molecules.







Abstract
The influence of phosphorus substitution of nitrogen in heterocyclic compounds on the vibrational spectroscopy as well as frontier molecular orbitals are analyzed. Nicotine with two nitrogen atoms in its structure is taken as the sample system to be studied computationally. By replacing the nitrogen atom in one or both rings of this molecule with phosphorus, three nicotine derivatives are created. The vibrational circular dichroism and infrared spectra of these four molecules in their monomer state, as well as the assemblies up to trimers are determined. The aforementioned spectra are calculated using static quantum chemical calculations employing a cluster&#8208;weighted approach. The calculated gas phase spectra of nicotine are compared to their respective experimental spectra. It is observed that the nicotine derivatives with phosphorus in the methylpyrrolidine ring have considerably different gas phase and bulk phase vibrational circular dichroism spectra when compared to nicotine. The phosphorus substitution reduces the energy gap between the highest occupied molecular orbital and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital as well as altering the polarizability and reactivity of the investigated molecules.

         <title>Revealing the Unique Role of Water in the Formation of Benzothiazoles: an Experimental and Computational Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 7, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The formation of benzothiazoles catalyzed by water is studied using both experimental and state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art computational methods. Free energy calculations from DFT&#8208;metadynamics suggest water as the sole catalyst at room temperature. The influence of different aliphatic and aromatic substituents with varying electronic properties on the chemical reactivity is discussed.







Abstract
We present here a joint experimental and computational study on the formation of benzothiazoles. Our investigation reveals a green protocol for accessing benzothiazoles from acyl chlorides using either water alongside a reducing agent as the reaction medium or in combination with stoichiometric amounts of a weak acid, instead of the harsh conditions and catalysts previously reported. Specifically, we show that a protic solvent, particularly water, enables the formation of 2&#8208;substituted benzothiazoles from N&#8208;acyl 1,2&#8208;aminothiophenols already at room temperature, without the need for strong acids or metal catalysts. DFT Molecular Dynamics simulations coupled with advanced enhanced sampling techniques provide a clear understanding of the catalytic role of water. We demonstrate how bulk water &#8211; due to its extended network of hydrogen bonds and an efficient Grotthuss mechanism &#8211; provides a reaction path that strongly reduces the reaction barriers compared to aprotic environments, namely more than 80&#8197;kJ/mol for the first reaction step and 250&#8197;kJ/mol for the second. Finally, we discuss the influence of different aliphatic and aromatic substituents with varying electronic properties on chemical reactivity. Besides providing in&#8208;depth mechanistic insights, we believe that our findings pave the way for a greener route toward an important class of bioactive molecules.

         <title>Stabilization of Luminescent Mononuclear Three&#8208;Coordinate CuI Complexes by Two Distinct Cavity&#8208;Shaped Diphosphanes Obtained from a Single &#945;&#8208;Cyclodextrin Precursor</title>

Two for the price of one! Depending on the experimental conditions, two dramatically different diphosphanes can be obtained from diphenyl(2&#8208;phosphanylphenyl)phosphane and an &#945;&#8208;cyclodextrin&#8208;derived dimesylate. The metal confining properties of the cavity&#8208;shaped ligands have been exploited to produce luminescent chelate [CuX(PP)] complexes (X=Cl, Br, I).







Abstract
Slightly different reaction conditions afforded two distinct cavity&#8208;shaped cis&#8208;chelating diphosphanes from the same starting materials, namely diphenyl(2&#8208;phosphanylphenyl)phosphane and an &#945;&#8211;cyclodextrin&#8208;derived dimesylate. Thanks to their metal&#8208;confining properties, the two diphosphanes form only mononuclear [CuX(PP)] complexes (X=Cl, Br, or I) with the tricoordinated metal ion located just above the center of the cavity. The two series of CuI complexes display markedly different luminescence properties that are both influenced by the electronic properties of the ligand and the unique steric environment provided by the cyclodextrin (CD) cavity. The excited state lifetimes of all complexes are significantly longer than those of the cavity&#8208;free analogues suggesting peculiar electronic effects that affect radiative deactivation constants. The overall picture stemming from absorption and emission data suggests close&#8208;lying charge&#8208;transfer (MLCT, XLCT) and triplet ligand&#8208;centered (LC) excited states.

         <title>Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Vicinal Intermolecular Annulations of Iodoarenes, Indoles, and Carbazoles with Enynes</title>

         <dc:description>
A vicinal annulation of 2&#8208;iodobenzoates, indoles, and carbazoles with 1,6&#8208;enynes is described. The relay involved 7&#8208;/8&#8208;membered palladacycles, leading to multicyclic scaffolds, which were readily diversified to an array of adducts (with new functional tethers and/or three contiguous stereocenters), in which a challenging benzylic monooxygenation was showcased.







Abstract
Reaching the formidable C&#8722;H corners has been one of the top priorities of organic chemists in the recent past. This prompted us to disclose herein a vicinal annulation of 2&#8208;iodo benzoates, indoles, and carbazoles with N&#8208;embedded 1,6&#8208;enynes through 7&#8208;/8&#8208;membered palladacycles. The relay does not require the assistance of any directing group, leading to multicyclic scaffolds, which are readily diversified to an array of adducts (with new functional tethers and/or three contiguous stereocenters), in which we showcase a rare benzylic mono&#8208;oxygenation.

         <title>Simple Air&#8208;Stable [3]Radialene Anion Radicals as Environmentally Switchable Catholytes in Water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 7, February 1, 2024. </description>

Ester&#8208;substituted [3]radialene radical anions dimerize in solutions of water. The dimerization mode is structure specific and can be controlled by using heat, solvent, and salt. These results provide guidance for increasing the capacity of aqueous redox flow batteries containing radialene catholytes. A buildup of &#963;&#8208;dimer prevents stable charge&#8211;discharge cycling. The formation of &#960;&#8208;dimers through the addition of salt increases the stability of the charged species.







Abstract
The hexacyano[3]radialene radical anion (1) is an attractive catholyte material for use in redox flow battery (RFB) applications. The substitution of cyano groups with ester moieties enhances solubility while maintaining redox reversibility and favorable redox potentials. Here we show that these ester&#8208;functionalized, hexasubstituted [3]radialene radical anions dimerize reversibly in water. The dimerization mode is dependent on the substitution pattern and can be switched in solution. Stimuli&#8208;responsive behavior is achieved by exploiting an unprecedented tristate switching mechanism, wherein the radical can be toggled between the free radical, a &#960;&#8208;dimer, and a &#963;&#8208;dimer&#8208;each with dramatically different optical, magnetic, and redox properties&#8208;by changing the solvent environment, temperature, or salinity. The symmetric, triester&#8208;tricyano[3]radialene (3) forms a solvent&#8208;responsive, &#963;&#8208;dimer in water that converts to the radical anion with the addition of organic solvents or to a &#960;&#8208;dimer in brine solutions. Diester&#8208;tetracyano[3]radialene (2) exists primarily as a &#960;&#8208;dimer in aqueous solutions and a radical anion in organic solvents. The dimerization behavior of both 2 and 3 is temperature dependent in methanol solutions. Dimerization equilibrium has a direct impact on catholyte stability during galvanostatic charge&#8211;discharge cycling in static H&#8208;cells. Specifically, conditions that favor the free radical anion or &#960;&#8208;dimer exhibit significantly enhanced cycling profiles.

         <title>Computational Design of &#945;&#8208;Conotoxins to Target Specific Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor Subtypes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 7, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
FoldX was benchmarked as the best energy prediction method, and seven accurate molecular models of &#945;&#8208;conotoxin/nAChRs were developed as surrogates for the experimental complexes. The combined use of FoldX and these molecular models emerged as an effective approach to predict &#945;&#8208;conotoxins with improved pharmaceutical properties. Novel &#945;&#8208;conotoxin variants designed by this method were successfully validated by experimental assay.







Abstract
Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are drug targets for neurological diseases and disorders, but selective targeting of the large number of nAChR subtypes is challenging. Marine cone snail &#945;&#8208;conotoxins are potent blockers of nAChRs and some have been engineered to achieve subtype selectivity. This engineering effort would benefit from rapid computational methods able to predict mutational energies, but current approaches typically require high&#8208;resolution experimental structures, which are not widely available for &#945;&#8208;conotoxin complexes. Herein, five mutational energy prediction methods were benchmarked using crystallographic and mutational data on two acetylcholine binding protein/&#945;&#8208;conotoxin systems. Molecular models were developed for six nAChR subtypes in complex with five &#945;&#8208;conotoxins that were studied through 150 substitutions. The best method was a combination of FoldX and molecular dynamics simulations, resulting in a predictive Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 0.68 (85&#8201;% accuracy). Novel &#945;&#8208;conotoxin mutants designed using this method were successfully validated by experimental assay with improved pharmaceutical properties. This work paves the way for the rapid design of subtype&#8208;specific nAChR ligands and potentially accelerated drug development.

         <title>Accelerated Synthesis of Nanolayered MWW Zeolite by Interzeolite Transformation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 7, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By combining interzeolite transformation with a dual&#8208;template strategy, nanolayered MWW zeolite was obtained within 48&#8197;h. 4&#8208;Membered&#8208;ring (4MR) units from the FAU precursor are essential to accelerate MWW formation.







Abstract
Hierarchical zeolites can offer substantial benefits over bulk zeolites in catalysis. A drawback towards practical implementation is their lengthy synthesis, often requiring complex organic templates. This work describes an accelerated synthesis of nanolayered MWW zeolite based on the combination of interzeolite transformation (IZT) with a dual&#8208;templating strategy. FAU zeolite, hexamethyleneimine (HMI), and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) were respectively employed as Al source and primary zeolite, structure directing agent, and exfoliating agent. This approach allowed to reduce the synthesis of nanolayered MWW to 48&#8197;h, which is a considerable advance over the state of the art. Tracking structural, textural, morphological, and chemical properties during crystallization showed that 4&#8208;membered&#8208;ring (4MR) units derived from the FAU precursor are involved in the faster formation of MWW in comparison to a synthesis procedure from amorphous precursor. CTAB restricts the growth of the zeolite in the c&#8208;direction, resulting in nanolayered MWW. Moreover, we show that this approach can speed up the synthesis of nanolayered FER. The merits of nanolayered MWW zeolites are demonstrated in terms of improved catalytic performance in the Diels&#8208;Alder cycloaddition of 2,5&#8208;dimethylfuran and ethylene to p&#8208;xylene compared to bulk reference MWW sample.

         <title>Affinity of Telluronium Chalcogen Bond Donors for Lewis Bases in Solution: A Critical Experimental&#8208;Theoretical Joint Study</title>

Telluronium salts [Ar2MeTe]X were synthesized, and their Lewis acidic properties towards a number of bases were addressed in solution by physical and theoretical means. DFT and ab&#8208;initio methods reveal the driving role of coulombic and dispersion interactions in the formation of [Ar2MeTe&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;Bn]+ complexes in solution (B=Lewis base).







Abstract
Telluronium salts [Ar2MeTe]X were synthesized, and their Lewis acidic properties towards a number of Lewis bases were addressed in solution by physical and theoretical means. Structural X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis of 21 different salts revealed the electrophilicity of the Te centers in their interactions with anions. Telluroniums&#8217; propensity to form Lewis pairs was investigated with OPPh3. Diffusion&#8208;ordered NMR spectroscopy suggested that telluroniums can bind up to three OPPh3 molecules. Isotherm titration calorimetry showed that the related heats of association in 1,2&#8208;dichloroethane depend on the electronic properties of the substituents of the aryl moiety and on the nature of the counterion. The enthalpies of first association of OPPh3 span &#8722;0.5 to &#8722;5&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1. Study of the affinity of telluroniums for OPPh3 by state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art DFT and ab&#8208;initio methods revealed the dominant Coulombic and dispersion interactions as well as an entropic effect favoring association in solution. Intermolecular orbital interactions between [Ar2MeTe]+ cations and OPPh3 are deemed insufficient on their own to ensure the cohesion of [Ar2MeTe&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;Bn]+ complexes in solution (B=Lewis base). Comparison of Grimme's and Tkatchenko's DFT&#8208;D4/MBD&#8208;vdW thermodynamics of formation of higher [Ar2MeTe&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;Bn]+ complexes revealed significant molecular size&#8208;dependent divergence of the two methodologies, with MBD yielding better agreement with experiment.

The synthesis of a phosphonium&#8208;substituted diphosphaindenylide, PPI, is reported. Introduction of two P atoms to the indenyl core results in considerable biradical character. Moreover, the ligand properties of PPI are investigated using a chromium tricarbonyl complex as model compound.







Abstract
Starting from C6H4(PCl2)2 and the TMS&#8208;substituted ylide (TMS)2C=PR3 (TMS=trimethylsilyl, R=p&#8208;tolyl), the phosphonium&#8208;substituted diphosphaindenylide PPI was prepared in two steps. CASSCF calculations as well as the reactivity toward diphenyl acetylene suggest a notable biradical character in PPI. Reaction with [Cr(CO)3(MeCN)3] affords the complex [Cr(CO)3(&#951;5&#8208;PPI)] (5). This complex was employed to explore the ligand properties of PPI, which demonstrates considerable potential through the combination of strong metal&#8208;ligand interactions and the possibility of a pronounced indenyl effect.

         <title>Dihydroguaiazulenide Complexes and Catalysts of Group 8&#8211;12 Transition Metals: Ligands from Renewable Feedstock Replace, even Outmatch Petrochemical Based Cyclopentadienyl Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 7, February 1, 2024. </description>

Cyclopentadienyl synthon (8&#8208;H&#8208;GuaH)Li isolated from guaiazulene (Gua) and LiH is used in ligand transfer towards selected homo&#8208; and heteroleptic group&#8197;8&#8211;10 metal complexes. Replacement of classical petrochemical based Cp metal chemistry by this renewable resources based Cp anion is not only cheaper. A representative precatalyst, [(8&#8208;H&#8208;GuaH)PtMe3], has proven an even much higher activity in photoactivated hydrosilylation of 1&#8208;octene at only 5&#8197;ppm load and 96&#8201;% conversion compared to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalyst [(CpR)GuaPtMe3] (R=H, Me). The platinum consumption could be reduced by about 90&#8201;%.







Abstract
We present an in&#8208;depth study of the sterically demanding Cp&#8208;synthon (8&#8208;H&#8208;GuaH)Li isolated from natural product guaiazulene (Gua) as a ligand transfer reagent towards late transition metal complex precursors. The synthesis and full characterization of selected, essentially unexplored homo&#8208; and heteroleptic 8&#8208;H&#8208;guaiazulenide complexes of iron, ruthenium, cobalt, rhodium, platinum, copper and zinc are discussed in detail. In order to demonstrate their potential in catalytic applications, [(GuaH)PtMe3] was selected. The latter proved an even higher catalytic activity in light induced olefin hydrosilylation at catalyst loads as low as 5&#8197;ppm than classical [CpPtMe3] in a typical test reaction of silicone elastomer fabrication. Our results demonstrate that traditional petrochemical based Cp metal chemistry and catalysis can be replaced, sometimes even outmatched by superior catalysts based on cheap building blocks from renewable feedstock.

         <title>Enzymatic Resolution and Decarboxylative Functionalization of &#945;&#8208;Sulfinyl Esters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 7, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enzymatic resolution of &#945;&#8208;sulfinyl esters gives recovered ester and &#945;&#8208;sulfinyl acid in high enantiomeric purity. Decarboxylative functionalization provides access to a wide range of optically active sulfoxides in both enantiomeric forms.







Abstract
&#945;&#8208;Sulfinyl esters can be readily prepared through thiol substitution of &#945;&#8208;bromo esters followed by oxidation to the sulfoxide. Enzymatic resolution with lipoprotein lipase provides both the unreacted esters and corresponding &#945;&#8208;sulfinyl carboxylic acids in high yields and enantiomeric ratios. Subsequent decarboxylative halogenation, dihalogenation, trihalogenation and cross&#8208;coupling gives rise to functionalized sulfoxides. The method has been applied to the asymmetric synthesis of a potent inhibitor of 15&#8208;prostaglandin dehydrogenase.

A non&#8208;solvated alkyl&#8208;substituted Al(I) anion dimer was synthesized by a reduction of haloalumane precursor using a mechanochemical method. The crystallographic and theoretical analysis revealed its structure and electronic properties. Experimental XPS analysis of the Al(I) anions with reference compounds revealed the lower Al&#8197;2p binding energy corresponds to the lower oxidation state of Al species. It should be emphasized that the experimentally obtained XPS binding energies were reproduced by delta SCF calculations and were linearly correlated with NPA charges and 2p orbital energies.

         <title>An Offset Patterned Cross&#8208;&#946; Structure in Assemblies of C3&#8208;Symmetric Peptide Amphiphiles</title>

Offset patterned cross&#8208;&#946; architecture arises in C3&#8208;symmetric peptide amphiphile assemblies as a result of spatial limitations of the &#946;&#8208;sheet dimensions.







Abstract
Developing peptide&#8208;based materials with controlled morphology is a critical theme of soft matter research. Herein, we report the formation of a novel, patterned cross&#8208;&#946; structure formed by self&#8208;assembled C3&#8208;symmetric peptide amphiphiles based on diphenylalanine and benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;tricarboxamide (BTA). The cross&#8208;&#946; motif is an abundant structural element in amyloid fibrils and aggregates of fibril&#8208;forming peptides, including diphenylalanine. The incorporation of topological constraints on one edge of the diphenylalanine fragment limits the number of &#946;&#8208;strands in &#946;&#8208;sheets and leads to the creation of an unconventional offset&#8208;patterned cross&#8208;&#946; structure consisting of short 3&#215;2 parallel &#946;&#8208;sheets stabilized by phenylalanine zippers. In the reported assembly, two patterned cross&#8208;&#946; structures bind parallel arrays of BTA stacks in a superstructure within a single&#8208;molecule&#8208;thick nanoribbon. In addition to a threefold network of hydrogen bonds in the BTA stack, each molecule becomes simultaneously bound by hydrogen bonds from three &#946;&#8208;sheets and four phenylalanine zippers. The diffuse layer of alkyl chains with terminal polar groups prevents the nanoribbons from merging and stabilizes cross&#8208;&#946;&#8208;structure in water. Our results provide a simple approach to the incorporation of novel patterned cross&#8208;&#946; motifs into supramolecular superstructures and shed light on the general mechanism of &#946;&#8208;sheet formation in C3&#8208;symmetric peptide amphiphiles.

Tripodal molecules Tr&#8208;Np3 and Tr&#8208;T&#8208;Np3 exhibited absorption in 290&#8211;480&#8197;nm range in solutions and optical bandgaps (Egopt) of 3.10&#8197;eV and 2.64&#8197;eV, respectively. Electron mobilities of 5.24&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;cm2/Vs and 6.14&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;cm2/Vs were obtained for Tr&#8208;Np3 and Tr&#8208;T&#8208;Np3 respectively. Excellent photocatalytic abilities of compounds were observed towards highly selective formation of benzimidazoles through the oxidative condensation between o&#8208;phenylenediamines and carboxaldehydes.







Abstract
Tripodal donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) small molecules Tr&#8208;Np3 and Tr&#8208;T&#8208;Np3 consisting of triphenyl triazine and 1,8&#8208;naphthalimide, without and with a thiophene spacer have been synthesized. Their optical and redox properties were thoroughly investigated along with their utilization as photocatalysts in organic transformations. Compounds Tr&#8208;Np3 and Tr&#8208;T&#8208;Np3 showed broad absorption in the range of 290&#8211;480&#8197;nm in solutions and 300&#8211;510&#8197;nm in thin films. These tripodal molecules displayed wide optical bandgaps of (Egopt) 3.10&#8197;eV and 2.64&#8197;eV with very deep&#8208;lying HOMO energy levels (&#8722;6.60&#8197;eV and &#8722;6.03&#8197;eV) and low&#8208;lying LUMO levels (&#8722;3.50&#8197;eV and &#8722;3.40&#8197;eV). Appreciable electron mobilities of 5.24&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;cm2/Vs and 6.14&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;cm2/Vs were obtained for compounds Tr&#8208;Np3 and Tr&#8208;T&#8208;Np3 respectively by space&#8208;charge limited current (SCLC) measurements. Metal&#8208;free tripodal molecules Tr&#8208;Np3 and Tr&#8208;T&#8208;Np3 showed excellent photocatalytic abilities towards condensation of aromatic aldehydes and o&#8208;phenylenediamine followed by cyclization under visible light to yield benzimidazole derivatives that are of high medicinal value.

         <title>Direct Synthesis of N&#8208;formamides by Integrating Reductive Amination of Ketones and Aldehydes with CO2 Fixation in a Metal&#8208;Organic Framework</title>

         <dc:description>
Ru/MFM&#8208;300(Cr) was used as catalyst for the one&#8208;pot N&#8208;formylation of both aldehydes and ketones (30 substrates) in high yield. Synchrotron PXRD reveals the activation of carbonyl compounds via confined binding within MFM&#8208;300(Cr). Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopic analysis and control experiments suggest formate species as the intermediate derived from the reduction of CO2 and reveal the possible reaction pathway.







Abstract
Formamides are important feedstocks for the manufacture of many fine chemicals. State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art synthesis of formamides relies on the use of an excess amount of reagents, giving copious waste and thus poor atom&#8208;economy. Here, we report the first example of direct synthesis of N&#8208;formamides by coupling two challenging reactions, namely reductive amination of carbonyl compounds, particularly biomass&#8208;derived aldehydes and ketones, and fixation of CO2 in the presence of H2 over a metal&#8208;organic framework supported ruthenium catalyst, Ru/MFM&#8208;300(Cr). Highly selective production of N&#8208;formamides has been observed for a wide range of carbonyl compounds. Synchrotron X&#8208;ray powder diffraction reveals the presence of strong host&#8208;guest binding interactions via hydrogen bonding and parallel&#8208;displaced &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions between the catalyst and adsorbed substrates facilitating the activation of substrates and promoting selectivity to formamides. The use of multifunctional porous catalysts to integrate CO2 utilisation in the synthesis of formamide products will have a significant impact in the sustainable synthesis of feedstock chemicals.

         <title>Barbier Polymerization&#8208;Induced Emission towards Fully Substituted Polyethylene Analogues with Non&#8208;Traditional Intrinsic Luminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 7, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The preparation of fully substituted polyethylene analogues (FSPEA) and their non&#8208;traditional intrinsic luminescence (NTIL) are attractive, especially for substitutions with relatively larger atomic radius than fluorine atom. Here, Barbier polymerization&#8208;induced emission (PIE) is demonstrated as a universal method for the molecular design of NTIL type FSPEAs with aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) characteristics. Further potential applications for explosive detection, artificial light&#8208;harvesting system and white phosphor&#8208;converted light&#8208;emitting diode are investigated.







Abstract
The properties of polyethylene are highly dependent on the variety and quantity of substitutions. Generally, polyethylene can only be fully substituted with fluorine atoms, mainly e.&#8201;g., polytetrafluoroethylene and nafion, because atomic radius of fluorine atom is small enough. The preparation of fully substituted polyethylene analogues (FSPEA) and their non&#8208;traditional intrinsic luminescence (NTIL) are attractive, especially for substitutions with relatively larger atomic radii than a fluorine atom. Here, Barbier polymerization&#8208;induced emission (PIE) is demonstrated as a universal method for the molecular design of NTIL type FSPEAs with intriguing aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) behaviors. Through Barbier polymerization of diphenyldichloromethane and different peroxyesters in the presence of Mg in one pot, a series of FSPEAs, including polytriphenylethanol (PTPE), polydiphenylfurylethanol (PDPFE), polydiphenylthiophenylethanol (PDPTE) and polydiphenylnaphthylethanol (PDPNE) have been successfully prepared. Further potential applications for explosive detection, artificial light&#8208;harvesting system and white phosphor&#8208;converted light&#8208;emitting diode are investigated. Therefore, this work opens up a new approach for the molecular design of FSPEA with non&#8208;conjugated luminescence, which may cause inspirations to different research fields like polyolefin and luminescent materials.

An electrocatalytic hypervalent iodine(III)&#8208;mediated in&#8208;cell synthesis of 3,4&#8208;dihydroquinolin&#8208;2&#8208;ones by C&#8722;N coupling is established, applying catalytic amounts of reagents, inexpensive electrode materials and a simple galvanostatic set&#8208;up.

Abstract
Electrochemically generated hypervalent iodine(III) species are powerful reagents for oxidative C&#8722;N coupling reactions, providing access to valuable N&#8208;heterocycles. A new electrocatalytic hypervalent iodine(III)&#8208;mediated in&#8208;cell synthesis of 1H&#8208;N&#8208;aryl&#8208;3,4&#8208;dihydroquinolin&#8208;2&#8208;ones by dehydrogenative C&#8722;N bond formation is presented. Catalytic amounts of the redox mediator, a low supporting electrolyte concentration and recycling of the solvent used make this method a sustainable alternative to electrochemical ex&#8208;cell or conventional approaches. Furthermore, inexpensive, readily available electrode materials and a simple galvanostatic set&#8208;up are applied. The broad functional group tolerance could be demonstrated by synthesizing 23 examples in yields up to 96&#8201;%, with one reaction being performed on a 10&#8208;fold higher scale. Based on the obtained results a sound reaction mechanism could be proposed.

Furthermore, a 10-fold scale-up was performed and a reaction mechanism was proposed.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electrochemically generated hypervalent iodine(III) species are powerful reagents for oxidative C&#8722;N coupling reactions, providing access to valuable N-heterocycles. A new electrocatalytic hypervalent iodine(III)-mediated in-cell synthesis of 1&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-aryl-3,4-dihydroquinolin-2-ones by dehydrogenative C&#8722;N bond formation is presented. Catalytic amounts of the redox mediator, a low supporting electrolyte concentration and recycling of the solvent used make this method a sustainable alternative to electrochemical ex-cell or conventional approaches. Furthermore, inexpensive, readily available electrode materials and a simple galvanostatic set-up are applied. The broad functional group tolerance could be demonstrated by synthesizing 23 examples in yields up to 96&#8201;%, with one reaction being performed on a 10-fold higher scale. Based on the obtained results a sound reaction mechanism could be proposed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Click and release reaction between pyrone/pyranthiones and bicyclononyne (BCN), features a release of CO2/COS with second&#8208;order rate constants comparable to Strain&#8208;Promoted Azide&#8208;Alkyne Cycloaddition reactions (SPAACs) for tunable H2S delivery and imaging in living cells.







Abstract
Hydrogen sulfide (H2S), one of the most important gasotransmitters, plays a critical role in endogenous signaling pathways of many diseases. However, developing H2S donors with both tunable release kinetics and high release efficiency for subcellular delivery has been challenging. Here, we describe a click and release reaction between pyrone/pyranthiones and bicyclononyne (BCN). This reaction features a release of CO2/COS with second&#8208;order rate constants comparable to Strain&#8208;Promoted Azide&#8208;Alkyne Cycloaddition reactions (SPAACs). Interestingly, pyranthiones showed enhanced reaction rates compared to their pyrone counterparts. We investigated pyrone biorthogonality and demonstrated their utility in protein labeling applications. Moreover, we synthesized substituted pyranthiones with H2S release kinetics that can address the range of physiologically relevant H2S dynamics in cells and achieved quantitative H2S release efficiency in&#8197;vitro. Finally, we explored the potential of pyranthiones as H2S/COS donors for mitochondrial&#8208;targeted H2S delivery in living cells.

         <title>S&#8208;induced Phase Change Forming In2O3/In2S3 Heterostructure for Photoelectrochemical Glucose Sensor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 7, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Interface construction through experimental control of the introduced anions allows the tuning of the energy bands of photoanode materials. The cooperative energy band and electronical structure of In2O3/In2S3 resulted in a photocurrent of 0.6&#8197;mA&#8901;cm&#8722;2 when exposed to light irradiation. This strategy has practical significance for developing low&#8208;cost, high&#8208;performance PEC sensors.







Abstract
In the past several decades, Photoelectrochemical (PEC) sensing still remains a great challenge to design highly&#8208;efficient semiconductor photocatalysts via a facile method. It is of much importance to design and synthesize various novel nanostructured sensing materials for further improving the response performance. Herein, we present an In2O3/In2S3 heterostructure obtained by combining microwave assisted hydrothermal method with S&#8208;induced phase change, whose energy band and electronic structure could be adjusted by changing the S content. Combining theoretical calculation and spectroscopic techniques, the introduction of sulfur was proved to produce multifunctional interfaces, inducing the change of phase, oxygen vacancies and band gap, which accelerates the separation of photoexcited carriers and reduces their recombination, improving the electronic injection efficiency around the interface of In2O3/In2S3. As anticipated, an enhanced glucose response performance with a photocurrent of 0.6&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, a linear range of 0.1&#8211;1&#8197;mM and a detection limit as low as 14.5&#8197;&#956;M has been achieved based on the In2O3/In2S3 heterostructure, which is significant superior over its pure In2O3 and S&#8208;doped In2O3 counterparts. This efficient interfacial strategy may open a new route to manipulate the electrical structure, and energy band structure regulation of sensing material to improve the performance of photoelectrodes for PEC.

         <title>Polymorphism&#8208;driven Distinct Nanomechanical, Optical, Photophysical, and Conducting Properties in a Benzothiophene&#8208;quinoline</title>

Polymorphic forms of ethyl&#8208;2&#8208;(1&#8208;benzothiophene&#8208;2&#8208;yl)quinolone&#8208;4&#8208;carboxylate with distinct packing arrangements and interactions, vary in their nanomechanical response, photophysical, optical waveguiding, and conducting properties, highlight the significant role of polymorphism in modulating the microstructures in molecular materials and thereby their functional properties. DFT calculations on the single molecule and crystal dimorphs corroborate the experimental photophysical and conductive findings.







Abstract
Polymorphic forms of organic conjugated small molecules, with their unique molecular shapes, packing arrangements, and interaction patterns, provide an excellent opportunity to uncover how their microstructures influence their observable properties. Ethyl&#8208;2&#8208;(1&#8208;benzothiophene&#8208;2&#8208;yl)quinoline&#8208;4&#8208;carboxylate (BZQ) exists as dimorphs with distinct crystal habits &#8211; blocks (BZB) and needles (BZN). The crystal forms differ in their molecular arrangements &#8211; BZB has a slip&#8208;stacked column&#8208;like structure in contrast to a zig&#8208;zag crystal packing with limited &#960;&#8208;overlap in BZN. The BZB crystals characterized by extended &#960;&#8208;stacking along [100] demonstrated semiconductor behavior, whereas the BZN, with its zig&#8208;zag crystal packing and limited stacking characteristics, was reckoned as an insulator. Monotropically related crystal forms also differ in their nanomechanical properties, with BZB crystals being considerably softer than BZN crystals. This discrepancy in mechanical behavior can be attributed to the distinct molecular arrangements adopted by each crystal form, resulting in unique mechanisms to relieve the strain generated during nanoindentation experiments. Waveguiding experiments on the acicular crystals of BZN revealed the passive waveguiding properties. Excitation of these crystals using a 532&#8197;nm laser confirmed the propagation of elastically scattered photons (green) and the subsequent generation of inelastically scattered (orange) photons by the crystals. Further, the dimorphs display dissimilar photoluminescence properties; they are both blue&#8208;emissive, but BZN displays twice the quantum yield of BZB. The study underscores the integral role of polymorphism in modulating the mechanical, photophysical, and conducting properties of functional molecular materials. Importantly, our findings reveal the existence of light&#8208;emitting crystal polymorphs with varying electric conductivity, a relatively scarce phenomenon in the literature.

         <title>Multifunctional Photoelectroactive Materials for Optoelectronic Applications Based on Thieno[3,4&#8208;b]pyrazines and Thieno[1,2,5]thiadiazoles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 7, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oligomers containing electron donor units based on a carbazole&#8208;thiophene derivative and three different acceptor units (Bz, Pz, Tz) were synthesized and characterized. These structural modifications promote better &#960;&#8208;electron delocalization due to a progressive enhancement of the quinoidal character (Bz&lt;Pz&lt;Tz) and facilitate photoinduced charge transfer processes in optoelectronic devices.







Abstract
In this study, we introduce a novel family of symmetrical thiophene&#8208;based small molecules with a Donor&#8208;Acceptor&#8208;Donor structure. These compounds feature three different acceptor units: benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (Bz), thieno[3,4&#8208;b]pyrazine (Pz), and thieno[1,2,5]thiadiazole (Tz), coupled with electron donor units based on a carbazole&#8208;thiophene derivative. Using Density Functional Theory (DFT), we investigate how the molecular geometry and strength of the central acceptor unit impact the redox and spectroscopic properties. Notably, the incorporation of Pz and Tz moieties induces a significant redshift in the absorption and emission spectra, which extend into the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region, simultaneously reducing their energy gaps (~1.4&#8211;1.6&#8197;eV).

&lt;p&gt;Oligomers containing electron donor units based on a carbazole-thiophene derivative and three different acceptor units (Bz, Pz, Tz) were synthesized and characterized. These structural modifications promote better &#960;-electron delocalization due to a progressive enhancement of the quinoidal character (Bz&amp;lt;Pz&amp;lt;Tz) and facilitate photoinduced charge transfer processes in optoelectronic devices.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study, we introduce a novel family of symmetrical thiophene-based small molecules with a Donor-Acceptor-Donor structure. These compounds feature three different acceptor units: benzo[&lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;][1,2,5]thiadiazole (Bz), thieno[3,4-b]pyrazine (Pz), and thieno[1,2,5]thiadiazole (Tz), coupled with electron donor units based on a carbazole-thiophene derivative. Using Density Functional Theory (DFT), we investigate how the molecular geometry and strength of the central acceptor unit impact the redox and spectroscopic properties. Notably, the incorporation of Pz and Tz moieties induces a significant redshift in the absorption and emission spectra, which extend into the near-infrared (NIR) region, simultaneously reducing their energy gaps (~1.4&#8211;1.6&#8197;eV). This shift is attributed to the increased coplanarity of the oligomeric inner core, both in the ground (S&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) and excited (S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) states, due to the enhanced quinoidal character as supported by bond-length alternation (BLA) analysis. These structural changes promote better &#960;-electron delocalization and facilitate photoinduced charge transfer processes in optoelectronic devices. Notably, we show that Pz- and Tz-containing molecules exhibit NIR electrochromic behavior and present ambivalent character in bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells. Finally, theoretical calculations suggest that these molecules could serve as effective two-photon absorption (2PA) probes, further expanding their potential in optoelectronic applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Sulfur&#8208; and Amine&#8208; Promoted Multielectron Autoredox Transformation of Nitromethane: Multicomponent Access to Thiourea Derivatives</title>

Synthesis of thioureas using elemental sulfur and nitromethane as the starting materials: multi&#8208;electron auto&#8208;redox property of nitromethane in the presence of sulfur and amines, delivering thiourea products without any added oxidant or reductant.







Abstract
Thiourea derivatives are in&#8208;demand motifs in organic synthesis, medicinal chemistry and material science, yet redox methods for the synthesis that start from safe, simple, inexpensive and readily available feedstocks are scarce. In this article, we disclose the synthesis of these motifs using elemental sulfur and nitromethane as the starting materials. The method harnesses the multi&#8208;electron auto&#8208;redox property of nitromethane in the presence of sulfur and amines, delivering thiourea products without any added oxidant or reductant. Extension of this reaction to cyclizable amines and/or higher homologues of nitromethane led to a wide range of nitrogen heterocycles and thioamides. Operationally simple, the reactions are scalable, tolerate a wide range of functional groups, and can be employed for the direct functionalization of natural products. Mechanistically, the nitro group was found to act as an oxidant leaving group, being reduced to ammonia whereas sulfur, along with the role of a sulfur building block for the thiocarbonyl group, behaved as a complementary reductant, being oxidized to sulfate.

         <title>Ferroelectricity and Related Properties of Nitratecadmate(II) Hybrid with Metal&#8208;Vacancy</title>

By substitution of NH4+ ion of a hexagonal perovskite structure with Cd2+ ion, we obtained a new metal&#8208;vacancy compound (H2dabco)2Cd(H2O)2(NO3)6. The coordination twist of the Cd&#8208;vacancy leads to instability of the lattices, structural phase transitions and excellent ferroelectricity. This result reveals that the vacancy can be utilized as an element to produce ferroelectric complexes.







Abstract
All crystals are not ideal, and many of their properties are often determined not by the regular arrangement of atoms, but by the irregular arrangement of crystal defects. Many properties of materials can be controlled effectively by proper use of solid defects. By substitution of NH4+ ion of a hexagonal perovskite structure (H2dabco)(NH4)(NO3)3 (dabco=1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, 1) with Cd2+ ion, we obtained a new metal&#8208;vacancy compound (H2dabco)2Cd(H2O)2(NO3)6 (2). It exhibits a ferroelectric&#8208;paraelectric phase transition at 261&#8197;K. A comparison of the various&#8208;temperature single&#8208;crystal structures indicates that the coordination twist of Cd2+ ion leads to instability of the lattices and excellent ferroelectricity. These findings reveal that the vacancy can be utilized as an element to produce ferroelectricity and may start the chemistry of metal&#8208;vacancy coordination compounds. These findings reveals that the vacancy can be utilized as an effective means to tune the symmetry and produce ferroelectricity.

         <title>Synthesis and Characterization of Ionic Li+@C70 Endohedral Fullerene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 7, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first C70&#8208;based &#8220;ionic&#8221; endohedral fullerene, Li+@C70, was synthesized and isolated as PF6&#8722; and TFSI&#8722; salts. The 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 ion pair structures were fully confirmed by spectroscopic analyses and X&#8208;ray crystallography. Optical spectroscopy as well as electrochemical measurements revealed that the encapsulated Li+ strongly stabilized the orbital energy of C70 through Coulomb interaction without changing the original energy gap and orbital degeneracy of the cage.







Abstract
Ion&#8208;endohedral&#8208;fullerene has attracted growing interest due to the unique electronic and structural characteristics arising from its distinctive ionic nature. Although there has been only one reported ion&#8208;encapsulated fullerene, Li+@C60, a significant number of fundamental and applied studies have been conducted, making a substantial impact not only in chemistry and physics but also across various interdisciplinary research fields. Nevertheless, studies on ion&#8208;endohedral fullerenes are still in their infancy due to the limitations in variety, and hence, it remains an open question how the size and symmetry of fullerene, as well as the motion and position of the encapsulated ion, affect their physical/chemical properties. Herein, we report the synthesis of lithium&#8208;ion&#8208;endohedral [70]fullerene (Li+@C70 X&#8722;, X=PF6&#8722; and TFSI&#8722;), a novel ionic endohedral fullerene. X&#8208;ray crystallography confirmed the encapsulation of Li+ by C70 cage as well as its ion&#8208;pair structure stabilized by external TFSI&#8722; counter anion. The encapsulated Li+ drastically lowered the orbital energy of the C70 cage by Coulomb interactions but did not affect the orbital energy gap and degeneracy. DFT studies were also performed, which supported the experimentally observed electronic effects caused by the encapsulated Li+.

         <title>Synthesis of Waixenicin A: Exploring Strategies for Nine&#8208;Membered Ring Formation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 7, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A full account on the development of the first total synthesis of the marine natural product waixenicin A is presented. Learning from a series of approaches which ultimately remained unsuccessful, a route relying on an intramolecular alkylation to forge the characteristic nine&#8208;membered ring of the natural product was developed.







Abstract
We present a comprehensive account on our efforts behind the recently published synthesis of waixenicin A. Our approach for constructing the dihydropyran ring relied on an Achmatowicz rearrangement. For the assembly of the nine&#8208;membered ring, four distinct strategies were investigated. Our initial attempts using radical&#8208;based addition/fragmentation reactions targeting the C7&#8722;C11 bond proved unsuitable for accessing the 6/9&#8208;bicycle. By employing anionic fragmentation conditions at the furfuryl alcohol stage, we successfully reached a 5/9&#8208;bicycle. However, subsequent ring&#8208;expansion was unsuccessful. Alternative approaches, such as Nozaki&#8211;Hiyama&#8211;Kishi or Heck reactions to connect the C6&#8722;C7 bond, also encountered difficulties, with no nine&#8208;membered ring formation observed. Our first breakthrough came from our attempts to install the C5&#8722;C6 bond via an intramolecular alkylation. Surprisingly, subsequent functional group modifications proved unexpectedly challenging, necessitating a redesign of our synthetic route. Drawing from all our investigations, we concluded that construction of the C9&#8722;C10 bond would enable efficient nine&#8208;membered ring alkylation and would facilitate the installation of the desired substitution pattern along the southern periphery. Exploration of this strategy yielded further surprises but ultimately led to the successful synthesis of waixenicin A and 9&#8208;deacetoxy&#8208;14,15&#8208;deepoxyxeniculin.

     alt="Synthesis of Waixenicin A: Exploring Strategies for Nine-Membered Ring Formation"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A full account on the development of the first total synthesis of the marine natural product waixenicin A is presented. Learning from a series of approaches which ultimately remained unsuccessful, a route relying on an intramolecular alkylation to forge the characteristic nine-membered ring of the natural product was developed.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We present a comprehensive account on our efforts behind the recently published synthesis of waixenicin A. Our approach for constructing the dihydropyran ring relied on an Achmatowicz rearrangement. For the assembly of the nine-membered ring, four distinct strategies were investigated. Our initial attempts using radical-based addition/fragmentation reactions targeting the C7&#8722;C11 bond proved unsuitable for accessing the 6/9-bicycle. By employing anionic fragmentation conditions at the furfuryl alcohol stage, we successfully reached a 5/9-bicycle. However, subsequent ring-expansion was unsuccessful. Alternative approaches, such as Nozaki&#8211;Hiyama&#8211;Kishi or Heck reactions to connect the C6&#8722;C7 bond, also encountered difficulties, with no nine-membered ring formation observed. Our first breakthrough came from our attempts to install the C5&#8722;C6 bond via an intramolecular alkylation. Surprisingly, subsequent functional group modifications proved unexpectedly challenging, necessitating a redesign of our synthetic route. Drawing from all our investigations, we concluded that construction of the C9&#8722;C10 bond would enable efficient nine-membered ring alkylation and would facilitate the installation of the desired substitution pattern along the southern periphery. Exploration of this strategy yielded further surprises but ultimately led to the successful synthesis of waixenicin A and 9-deacetoxy-14,15-deepoxyxeniculin. For the latter compound, a bioinspired one-step rearrangement to xeniafauranol A was achieved.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cover Feature: Simple Air&#8208;Stable [3]Radialene Anion Radicals as Environmentally Switchable Catholytes in Water (Chem. Eur. J. 7/2024)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 7, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stimuli&#8208;responsive [3]radialene radical anions dimerize reversibly in a controlled manner. An unprecedented tristate switching mechanism can be achieved by changing the solvent environment, temperature, or salinity of the solution. This allows the radical to be toggled between the free radical, a &#960;&#8208;dimer, and a &#963;&#8208;dimer, which exhibit dramatically different optical, magnetic, and redox properties. The addition of salt to the radialene catholyte solution in an aqueous redox flow battery (RFB) converts the &#963;&#8208;dimer to the &#960;&#8208;dimer and increases the electrochemical reversibility and stability of the charged species, which are advantageous for galvanostatic charge&#8211;discharge studies at neutral pH. More information can be found in the Research Article by Arthur&#8197;H. Winter, C. Bejger, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202302829). Illustration by Frank&#8197;A. Martinez.

A fascinating and intricate bonding scenario is found within a biradicaloid chromium complex. The ligand&#8242;s bonding atoms are depicted as doors, clearly marked with C and P. The arrows on the doors highlight the biradicaloid nature at the P atoms. The bonding interactions are portrayed as a staircase, symbolizing the connection between the biradicaloid and the metal. Like the individuals walking in opposite directions on the steps, the electrons flow in both directions: from the ligand to the metal and vice versa. More information can be found in the Research Article by P. Coburger and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202302970). Image painted by Dr. Christoph Selg.

         <title>ortho&#8208;Boronic Acid Carbonyl Compounds and Their Applications in Chemical Biology

In this review, we highlight the utility of o&#8208;boronic acid imines, hydrazones, oximes, and diazaborines in chemical biology applications, including bioconjugation, drug delivery systems, stimuli&#8208;responsive polymers, and as chemical probes.







Abstract
Iminoboronates and diazaborines are related classes of compounds that feature an imine ortho to an arylboronic acid (iminoboronate) or a hydrazone that cyclizes with an ortho arylboronic acid (diazaborine). Rather than acting as independent chemical motifs, the arylboronic acid impacts the rate of imine/hydrazone formation, hydrolysis, and exchange with competing nucleophiles. Increasing evidence has shown that the imine/hydrazone functionality also impacts arylboronic acid reactivity toward diols and reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS/RNS). Untangling the communication between C=N linked functionalities and arylboronic acids has revealed a powerful and tunable motif for bioconjugation chemistries and other applications in chemical biology. Here, we survey the applications of iminoboronates and diazaborines in these fields with an eye toward understanding their utility as a function of neighboring group effects.

         <title>Optical Cavity Design and Functionality for Molecular Strong Coupling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 7, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cavity strong coupling offers prospects for showcasing captivating photochemical or photophysical phenomena. Recently, significant advancements have been made in the fabrication of microcavities specifically designed for strong coupling. The development of microcavities with multiple functions beyond simply optical resonators allows further investigation of strong coupling systems and opens the way for practical applications.







Abstract
Optical cavity/molecule strong coupling offers attractive opportunities to modulate photochemical or photophysical processes. When atoms or molecules are placed in an optical cavity, they can coherently exchange photonic energy with optical cavity vacuum fields, entering the strong coupling interaction regime. Recent work suggests that the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of molecules can be significantly changed by strong coupling, resulting in the emergence of intriguing photochemical and photophysical phenomena. As more and more physico&#8208;chemical systems are studied under strong coupling conditions, optical cavities have also advanced in their sophistication, responsiveness, and (multi)functionality. In this review, we highlight some of these recent developments, particularly focusing on Fabry&#8211;Perot microcavities.

         <title>Insulating 6,6&#8208;Phenyl&#8208;C61&#8208;butyric Acid Methyl Ester on Transition&#8208;Metal Dichalcogenides: Impact of the Hybrid Materials on the Optical and Electrical Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this study we develop a strategy to insulate 6,6 &#8208;Phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) on the basal plane of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). Concretely single layers of MoS2, MoSe2, MoTe2, WS2, WSe2 and WTe2 and ultrathin MoO2 and WO2 were grown via chemical vapor deposition (CVD). Then, the thiol group of a PCBM modified with cysteine reacts with the chalcogen vacancies on the basal plane of TMDs, yielding PCBM&#8208;MoS2, PCBM&#8208;MoSe2, PCBM&#8208;WS2, PCBM&#8208;WSe2, PCBM&#8208;WTe2, PCBM&#8208;MoO2 and PCBM&#8208;WO2. Afterwards, all the hybrid materials were characterized using several techniques, including XPS, Raman spectroscopy, TEM, AFM, and cyclic voltammetry. Furthermore, PCBM causes a unique optical and electrical impact in every TMDs. For MoS2 devices, the conductivity and photoluminescence (PL) emission achieve a remarkable enhancement of 1700% and 200% in PCBM&#8208;MoS2 hybrids. Similarly, PCBM&#8208;MoTe2 hybrids exhibit a 2&#8208;fold enhancement in PL emission at 1.1 eV. On the other hand, PCBM&#8208;MoSe2, PCBM&#8208;WSe2 and PCBM&#8208;WS2 hybrids exhibited a new interlayer exciton at 1.29&#8208;1.44, 1.7 and 1.37&#8208;154 eV along with an enhancement of the photo&#8208;response by 2400, 3200 and 600%, respectively. Additionally, PCBM&#8208;WTe2 and PCBM&#8208;WO2 showed a modest photo&#8208;response, in sharp contrast with pristine WTe2 or WO2 which archive pure metallic character.</dc:description>

         <title>Strong Circularly Polarized Luminescence Promoted by AIE&#8208;active Chiral Co&#8208;assemblies in Liquid Crystal Polymer Films</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently, extensive works have focused on increasing the dissymmetry factors (glum) of various circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) materials, which is one of the most important factors for future applications of CPL. Herein, we designed a chiral co&#8208;assembled liquid crystal polymer (LCP) PTZ@R/S&#8208;PB2, which was prepared by chiral binary co&#8208;polymer (R/S&#8208;PB2) doped with achiral phenothiazine derivation dye (PTZ). For comparison, ternary co&#8208;polymerized LCP (R/S&#8208;PT) was synthesized by co&#8208;polymerizing with mesogenic monomer, chiral monomer and emissive monomer. Both PTZ@R/S&#8208;PB2 and R/S&#8208;PT showed aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) properties. Interestingly, the CPL signals of both PTZ@R/S&#8208;PB2 and R/S&#8208;PT were reversed and amplified after thermal annealing treatment. The |glum| values of the co&#8208;assembled PTZ@R/S&#8208;PB2 were up to 0.13 at a 32 nm thickness, which was 5.4 times that of R/S&#8208;PT (|glum| = 0.024). This is due to PTZ@R/S&#8208;PB2 could form more orderly chiral co&#8208;assembly structures. Noticeably, increasing the LCP film thickness could further improve the glum value, and the maximum glum&#160;of PTZ@R/S&#8208;PB2 could be enhanced to 0.91&#160;at a 220 nm thickness.</dc:description>

         <title>2D Monolayer Catalysts: Towards Efficient Water Splitting and Green Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A viable alternative to non&#8208;renewable hydrocarbon fuels is hydrogen gas, created using a safe, environmentally friendly process like water splitting. An important role in water&#8208;splitting applications is played by the development of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) layered transition metal chalcogenides (TMDCs), transition metal carbides (MXenes), graphene&#8208;derived 2D layered nanomaterials, phosphorene, and hexagonal boron nitride. Advanced synthesis methods and characterization instruments enabled an effective application for improved electrocatalytic water splitting and sustainable hydrogen production. Enhancing active sites, modifying the phase and electronic structure, adding conductive elements like transition metals, forming heterostructures, altering the defect state, etc., can improve the catalytic activity of 2D stacked hybrid monolayer nanomaterials. The majority of global research and development is focused on finding safer substitutes for petrochemical fuels, and this review summarizes recent advancements in the field of 2D monolayer nanomaterials in water splitting for industrial&#8208;scale green hydrogen production and fuel cell applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis with Organoselenium Compounds &#8211; The Past Twelve Years</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Examples of asymmetric reactions modulated by selenium compounds include a chiral selenophosphoramide Lewis base that catalyzes electrophilic and oxidative additions to alkenes, an ylide containing a terpene&#8208;based chiral auxiliary for cyclopropanations and a chiral selenide catalyst for photoredox cyclofunctionalizations.







Abstract
The discovery and synthetic applications of novel organoselenium compounds and their reactions proceeded rapidly during the past fifty years and such processes are now carried out routinely in many laboratories. At the same time, the growing demand for new enantioselective processes provided new challenges. The convergence of selenium chemistry and asymmetric synthesis led to key developments in the 1970s, although the majority of early work was based on stoichiometric processes. More recently, greater emphasis has been placed on greener catalytic variations, along with the discovery of novel reactions and a deeper understanding of their mechanisms. The present review covers the literature in this field from 2010 to early 2023 and encompasses asymmetric reactions mediated by chiral selenium&#8208;based reagents, auxiliaries, and especially, catalysts. Protocols based on achiral selenium compounds in conjunction with other species of chiral catalysts, as well as reactions that are controlled by chiral substrates, are also included.

         <title>A Rational Design of Electrochemically and Photophysically Tunable Triarylamine Luminophores by Consecutive (Pseudo&#8208;)Four&#8208;Component Syntheses</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single palladium catalyst catches two birds with one stone by multicomponent Suzuki and Buchwald&#8208;Hartwig coupling to give a library of redox&#8208;active triarylamine (TAA) luminophores. Redox potentials, absorption and emission energies together with (TD)DFT calculations of the electronic structure set the stage for structure&#8208;property relationships for a rational design of tunable TAAs.







Abstract
The concatenation of Suzuki coupling and two&#8208;fold Buchwald&#8208;Hartwig amination in sequentially palladium&#8208;catalyzed consecutive multicomponent syntheses paves a concise, convergent route to diversely functionalized para&#8208;biaryl&#8208;substituted triarylamines (p&#8208;bTAAs) from simple, readily available starting materials. An extensive library of p&#8208;bTAAs permits comprehensive investigations of their electronic properties by absorption and emission spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, and quantum chemical calculations, which contribute to a deep understanding of their electronic structure. The synthesized p&#8208;bTAAs exhibit tunable fluorescence from blue to yellow upon photonic excitation with quantum yields up to 98&#8201;% in solution and 92&#8201;% in the solid state. Furthermore, a pronounced bathochromic shift of the emission maxima by increasing solvent polarity indicates positive emission solvatochromism. Aggregation&#8208;induced enhanced emission (AIEE) in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)/water mixtures causes the formation of intensely blue fluorescent aggregates. Cyclic voltammetry shows reversible first and second oxidations of p&#8208;bTAAs at low potentials, which are tunable by variation of the introduced para substituents. 3D Hammett plots resulting from the correlation of oxidation potentials and emission maxima with electronic substituent parameters emphasize the rational design of tailored p&#8208;bTAAs with predictable electrochemical and photophysical properties.

         <title>Exploring Electrophilic Hydrophosphination via Metal Phosphenium Intermediates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Umpolung in P&#8722;H activation: Metal&#8208;mediated hydrophosphination that relies on electrophilic addition at a phosphenium ligand has been demonstrated for unsaturated substrates including the decidedly unactivated ethylene. This outer&#8208;sphere process demonstrates that metal&#8208;coordinated secondary phosphines can act as hydride donors to reactive carbocations. The results highlight the tunable Lewis acidity of metal phosphenium complexes.







Abstract
Two Mo(0) phosphenium complexes containing ancillary secondary phosphine ligands have been investigated with respect to their ability to participate in electrophilic addition at unsaturated substrates and subsequent P&#8722;H hydride transfer to &#8220;quench&#8221; the resulting carbocations. These studies provide stoichiometric &#8220;proof of concept&#8221; for a proposed new metal&#8208;catalyzed electrophilic hydrophosphination mechanism. The more strongly Lewis acidic phosphenium complex, [Mo(CO)4(PR2H)(PR2)]+ (R=Ph, Tolp), cleanly hydrophosphinates 1,1&#8208;diphenylethylene, benzophenone, and ethylene, while other substrates react rapidly to give products resulting from competing electrophilic processes. A less Lewis acidic complex, [Mo(CO)3(PR2H)2(PR2)]+, generally reacts more slowly but participates in clean hydrophosphination of a wider range of unsaturated substrates, including styrene, indene, 1&#8208;hexene, and cyclohexanone, in addition to 1,1&#8208;diphenylethylene, benzophenone, and ethylene. Mechanistic studies are described, including stoichiometric control reactions and computational and kinetic analyses, which probe whether the observed P&#8722;H addition actually does occur by the proposed electrophilic mechanism, and whether hydridic P&#8722;H transfer in this system is intra&#8208; or intermolecular. Preliminary reactivity studies indicate challenges that must be addressed to exploit these promising results in catalysis.

         <title>Polyoxometalate&#8208;dependent photocatalytic activity of radical&#8208;doped perylenediimide&#8208;based hybrid materials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Extremely rare radical&#8208;doped PDI&#8208;based hybrid materials exhibit remarkable POM&#8208;dependent photocatalytic activities for the oxidative coupling of amines and the iodoperfluoroalkylation of alkenes, which is attributed to the energy differences between the SOMO&#8208;2 level of Cl4&#8208;PDI&#8901;&#8722;* and the LUMO level of the POMs.







Abstract
Inorganic&#8208;organic hybrid materials are a kind of multiduty materials with high crystallinity and definite structures, built from functional inorganic and organic components with highly tunable photochemical properties. Perylenediimides (PDIs) are a kind of strong visible light&#8208;absorbing organic dyes with &#960;&#8208;electron&#8208;deficient planes and photochemical properties depending on their micro&#8208;environment, which provides a platform for designing tunable and efficient hybrid photocatalytic materials. Herein, four radical&#8208;doped PDI&#8208;based crystalline hybrid materials, Cl4&#8208;PDI&#8901;SiW12O40 (1), Cl4&#8208;PDI&#8901;SiMo12O40 (2), Cl4&#8208;PDI&#8901;PW12O40 (3), and Cl4&#8208;PDI&#8901;PMo12O40 (4), were attained by slow diffusion of polyoxometalates (POMs) into acidified Cl4&#8208;PDI solutions. The obtained PDI&#8208;based crystalline hybrid materials not only exhibited prominent photochromism, but also possessed reactive organic radicals under ambient conditions. Furthermore, all hybrid materials could be easily photoreduced to their radical anions (Cl4&#8208;PDI&#8901;&#8722;), and then underwent a second photoexcitation to form energetic excited state radical anions (Cl4&#8208;PDI&#8901;&#8722;*). However, experiments and theoretical calculations demonstrated that the formed energetic Cl4&#8208;PDI&#8901;&#8722;* showed unusual POM&#8208;dependent photocatalytic efficiencies toward the oxidative coupling of amines and the iodoperfluoroalkylation of alkenes; higher photocatalytic efficiencies were found for hybrid materials 1 (anion: SiW12O404&#8722;) and 2 (anion: SiMo12O404&#8722;) compared to 3 (anion: PW12O403&#8722;) and 4 (anion: PMo12O403&#8722;). The photocatalytic efficiencies of these hybrid materials are mainly controlled by the energy differences between the SOMO&#8208;2 level of Cl4&#8208;PDI&#8901;&#8722;* and the LUMO level of the POMs. The structure&#8208;photocatalytic activity relationships established in present work provide new research directions to both the photocatalysis and hybrid material fields, and will promote the integration of these areas to explore new materials with interesting properties.

         <dc:description>
A novel class of siloxane&#8208;based porous materials is synthesized through the cross&#8208;linking of organosilylated cage siloxanes with double&#8208;6&#8208;ring (D6R) geometry. This material has higher surface area and chemical stability compared with conventional porous materials prepared using double&#8208;4&#8208;ring cage siloxanes, and also has a potential for unique encapsulation abilities.







Abstract
Utilization of well&#8208;defined siloxane molecules allows for the construction of functional siloxane&#8208;based nanoporous materials based on the molecular design. Herein, a novel class of siloxane&#8208;based porous materials is synthesized via cross&#8208;linking of dimethylsilyl&#8208; and dimethylvinylsilyl&#8208;functionalized cage siloxanes with double&#8208;6&#8208;ring (D6R) geometry. Compared with the conventional double&#8208;4&#8208;ring cage siloxane, this study highlights the characteristics of D6R siloxanes as building blocks, demonstrating their high surface area and chemical stability. Furthermore, density functional theory calculations show their unique cation encapsulation ability.

         <dc:description>Fast&#8208;charging technology is set to revolutionize the field of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), driving the creation of next&#8208;generation devices with the ability to get charged within a short span of time.

         <title>Controlling Cyclic Dienamine Reactivity in Radical tert&#8208;Alkylation for Molecular Diversity to Synthesize Multicyclic Compounds possessing a Quaternary Carbon</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selective formation of the desired dienamines from &#946;&#8208;methylcyclohexenone and their reaction with tertiary alkyl radicals generated from &#945;&#8208;bromoesters led to the synthesis of &#947;&#8208;oxoalkyl substituted cyclohexenone derivatives (OAC) with a quaternary carbon have been successfully synthesized. This OAC can be used as a common synthetic intermediate for fused [5,6] rings and spirocycles.







Abstract
Synthesis of diverse sterically congested molecules from a single important intermediate is one of the ideal synthetic strategies in organic synthesis. In this paper, we found that &#947;&#8208;oxoalkyl substituted cyclohexenone derivatives (OAC) possessing a quaternary carbon are a useful key intermediate to derive both congested fused [5,6] rings and spirocycles. For this purpose, we have established an efficient synthetic method to obtain OAC by tertiary alkylation of &#946;&#8208;methylcyclohexenone derivatives using &#945;&#8208;bromocarbonyl compounds as a tertiary alkyl source. The key to the success of this reaction is controlling the reactivity of the dienamine intermediate.

     alt="Controlling Cyclic Dienamine Reactivity in Radical tert-Alkylation for Molecular Diversity to Synthesize Multicyclic Compounds possessing a Quaternary Carbon"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Selective formation of the desired dienamines from &#946;-methylcyclohexenone and their reaction with tertiary alkyl radicals generated from &#945;-bromoesters led to the synthesis of &#947;-oxoalkyl substituted cyclohexenone derivatives (OAC) with a quaternary carbon have been successfully synthesized. This OAC can be used as a common synthetic intermediate for fused [5,6] rings and spirocycles.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Synthesis of diverse sterically congested molecules from a single important intermediate is one of the ideal synthetic strategies in organic synthesis. In this paper, we found that &#947;-oxoalkyl substituted cyclohexenone derivatives (OAC) possessing a quaternary carbon are a useful key intermediate to derive both congested fused [5,6] rings and spirocycles. For this purpose, we have established an efficient synthetic method to obtain OAC by tertiary alkylation of &#946;-methylcyclohexenone derivatives using &#945;-bromocarbonyl compounds as a tertiary alkyl source. The key to the success of this reaction is controlling the reactivity of the dienamine intermediate. While there have been many reports on enamine reactions, dienamine reactions have not been well studied. Herein, we report controlling reactivity of dienamines and molecular diversification from OAC.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Analysis of the Unusual Chemical Bonds and Dipole Moments of AeF&#8722; (Ae=Be&#8722;Ba): A Lesson in Covalent Bonding</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A careful bonding analysis of the anions AeF&#8208; shows that the fluorine anion F&#8722; is a very strong donor via charge&#8208;induced covalent interactions with alkaline earth atoms Ae, exhibiting triple bonds for Ae=Be, Mg and even quadruple bonds for the heavier atoms Ae=Ca, Sr, Ba due to their empty (n&#8208;1)d valence orbitals. The unusual dipole moments with the negative end at the Ae atom are decomposed into pairwise electron contributions that reveal the special role of the HOMO.







Abstract
Quantum chemical calculations of the anions AeF&#8722; (Ae=Be&#8722;Ba) have been carried out using ab initio methods at the CCSD(T)/def2&#8208;TZVPP level and density functional theory employing BP86 with various basis sets. The detailed bonding analyses using different charge&#8208; and energy partitioning methods show that the molecules possess three distinctively different dative bonds in the lighter species with Ae=Be, Mg and four dative bonds when Ae=Ca, Sr, Ba. The occupied 2p atomic orbitals (AOs) and to a lesser degree the occupied 2s AO of F&#8722; donate electronic charge into the vacant spx(&#963;) and p(&#960;) orbitals of Be and Mg which leads to a triple bond Ae
F&#8722;. The heavier Ae atoms Ca, Sr, Ba use their vacant (n&#8208;1)d AOs as acceptor orbitals which enables them to form a second &#963; donor bond with F&#8722; that leads to quadruply bonded Ae
F&#8722; (Ae=Ca&#8722;Ba). The presentation of molecular orbitals or charge distribution using only one isodensity value may give misleading information about the overall nature of the orbital or charge distribution. Better insights are given by contour line diagrams. The ELF calculations provide monosynaptic and disynaptic basins of AeF&#8722; which nicely agree with the analysis of the occupied molecular orbitals and with the charge density difference maps. A particular feature of the covalent bonds in AeF&#8722; concerns the inductive interaction of F&#8722; with the soft valence electrons in the (n)s valence orbitals of Ae. The polarization of the (n)s2 electrons induces a (n)spx hybridized lone&#8208;pair orbital at atom Ae, which yields a large dipole moment with the negative end at Ae. The concomitant formation of a vacant (n)spx AO of atom Ae, which overlaps with the occupied 2p(&#963;) AO of F&#8722;, leads to a strong covalent &#963; bond.

         <title>(Benz)imidazo[1,2&#8208;a]quinolinium Salts: Access via Unprecedented Regiospecific non&#8208;AAIPEX Strategy and Study of Their Tunable Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented access to monosubstituted cationic tricyclic heteroaromatic compounds (cPHACs), possessing tunable photo&#8208;physical/electrochemical properties and having structural resemblance with drug molecules, via Ru(II)&#8208;catalyzed tandem annulation cum aromatization following a non&#8208;AAIPEX protocol is reported. This methodology executes a range of intermediate steps e.&#8201;g. double C&#8722;H activation, nucleophilic addition, annulation, and dehydration cum aromatization in one&#8208;pot manner under the generation of water as the sole by&#8208;product.







Abstract
An unprecedented non&#8208;AAIPEX protocol has been developed to access diverse monosubstituted cationic polycyclic heteroaromatic compounds (cPHACs) from the readily available azolium salts and phenacyl bromides via Ru(II)&#8208;catalyzed tandem annulation cum aromatization. This atom&#8208;economic protocol executes a range of intermediate steps e.&#8201;g. double C&#8722;H activation, nucleophilic addition, annulation, and dehydration cum aromatization in one&#8208;pot manner under the generation of H2O as the sole byproduct. Moreover, the systematic tunability of photo&#8208;physical and electrochemical properties of these new class of cPHACs can be authenticated from the DFT calculated frontier molecular orbital energies that might be beneficial for their potential applications in optoelectronics and DNA intercalation.

         <title>Synthesis and Isolation of a Homochiral Nanohoop Composed of a Tr&#246;ger's Base and Hexaparaphenylene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tethering of a stereogenic Tr&#246;ger's base to a curved hexaparaphenylene has led to the synthesis of the homochiral nanohoop TB[6]CPP. This nanohoop possesses a C2 symmetrical structure, which gives rise to pale blue emission with a high quantum yield of ca.&#8197;0.69 and shows chiroptical properties, especially circular polarized luminescence with a moderate dissymmetry factor (|glum|) of 2.1&#215;10&#8722;3.







Abstract
The synthesis of a new nanohoop containing a stereogenic Tr&#246;ger's base skeleton tethered to a curved hexaparaphenylene ([6]CPP) is reported. The TB[6]CPP nanohoop possesses a stable C2 symmetrical structure, which promotes the allowed transition that gives rise to pale blue emission with a quantum yield of ~0.69, surpassing the value of the more symmetrical [8]CPP. Moreover, TB[6]CPP shows chiroptical properties including circular dichroism and circularly polarized luminescence with a moderate dissymmetry factor (|glum|) of ~2.1&#215;10&#8722;3

         <title>Pyrrole &#946;C&#8722;B&#8722;N Fused Porphyrins: Molecular Structures and Opto&#8208;Electrochemical Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
B&#8722;N fusion induced extended conjugation and tetracoordinated boron caused twisted structure in &#946;C&#8722;B&#8722;N fused Ni(II) porphyrins (1&#8208;trans, 1&#8208;cis, 2&#8208;trans, and 2&#8208;cis) exhibit red shifted absorption than non&#8208;fused compounds. The fused porphyrins are easier to reduce and easier to oxidize compared to compounds without B&#8722;N fusion.







Abstract
Herein, we report the design, synthesis, structure, and electrochemical study of doubly &#946;C&#8722;B&#8722;N fused Ni(II) porphyrins (1&#8208;trans, 1&#8208;cis, 2&#8208;trans, and 2&#8208;cis). These compounds have been synthesized from A2B2 type dipyridyl Ni(II) porphyrins (Ar=Ph for 1&#8201;a; Ar=C6F5 for 2&#8201;a) via Lewis base&#8208;directed electrophilic aromatic borylation reactions. The solution state structures of these compounds have been established using 1H NMR, 11B NMR, 1H&#8208;1H COSY, 1H&#8208;13C HSQC, and 19F&#8208;13C HSQC NMR techniques. Single crystal X&#8208;ray analysis have revealed that 1&#8208;trans, 1&#8208;cis, and 2&#8208;trans adopt ruffled conformations, with alternate meso&#8208;carbons on the opposite sides of the mean porphyrin plane. The Soret bands in the absorption spectra of the B&#8722;N fused molecules are ~40&#8197;nm redshifted compared to unfused Ni(II) porphyrin precursors. The B&#8722;N fusion have diminished the redox potential of fused porphyrins. Although 1&#8208;trans and 1&#8208;cis, show four oxidation processes, 2&#8208;trans and 2&#8208;cis show only three oxidation processes. DFT studies have revealed that the tetrahedral geometry of the boron has induced a twist in the &#960;&#8208;conjugation, which destabilizes the HOMO and stabilizes the LUMO in 1&#8208;trans, 1&#8208;cis, 2&#8208;trans, and 2&#8208;cis.

The solution state structures of these compounds have been established using &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H NMR, &lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;B NMR, &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H-&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H COSY, &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H-&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C HSQC, and &lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;F-&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C HSQC NMR techniques. Single crystal X-ray analysis have revealed that &lt;b&gt;1-trans&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;1-cis&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;2-trans&lt;/b&gt; adopt ruffled conformations, with alternate meso-carbons on the opposite sides of the mean porphyrin plane. The Soret bands in the absorption spectra of the B&#8722;N fused molecules are ~40&#8197;nm redshifted compared to unfused Ni(II) porphyrin precursors. The B&#8722;N fusion have diminished the redox potential of fused porphyrins. Although &lt;b&gt;1-trans&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;1-cis&lt;/b&gt;, show four oxidation processes, &lt;b&gt;2-trans&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;2-cis&lt;/b&gt; show only three oxidation processes. DFT studies have revealed that the tetrahedral geometry of the boron has induced a twist in the &#960;-conjugation, which destabilizes the HOMO and stabilizes the LUMO in &lt;b&gt;1-trans&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;1-cis&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;2-trans&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;2-cis&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Continuous Direct Mechanocatalytic Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura Coupling via Twin&#8208;Screw Extrusion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study delves into the mechanocatalytic Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura reaction within an extruder, elucidating the influence of parameters like temperature, catalyst position and contact time. Notably, multiple passes through the extruder yielded substantially improved reaction conversions. The research underscores the pivotal role of optimizing the interplay between catalyst contact time and energy input, offering crucial insights for industrial&#8208;scale applications of mechanochemical reactions.







Abstract
This work establishes the first direct mechanocatalytic reaction protocol within an extruder, focusing on the Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura reaction. Through the coating of either the extruder screws or barrel with Pd, we executed the cross&#8208;coupling reaction without the reliance on molecular catalyst compounds or powders, and solvents continuously. We identified the influence and interplay of crucial reaction parameters such as temperature, mechanical energy input, residence time, rheology, and catalyst contact time and finally obtained 36&#8201;% and 75&#8201;% of the reaction product after one and four reactor passes respectively.

         <title>Recent Advances of Flexible MXene and its Composites for Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>MXenes have unique properties such as high electrical conductivity, excellent mechanical properties, rich surface chemistry, and convenient processability. These characteristics make them ideal for producing flexible materials with tunable microstructures. This paper reviews the laboratory research progress of flexible MXene and its composite materials for supercapacitors. And introduces the general synthesis method of MXene, as well as the preparation and properties of flexible MXene. By analyzing the current research status, the electrochemical reaction mechanism of MXene was explained from the perspectives of electrolyte and surface terminating groups. This review particularly emphasizes the composite methods of freestanding flexible MXene composite materials. The review points out that the biggest problem with flexible MXene electrodes is severe self&#8208;stacking, which reduces the number of chemically active sites, weakens ion accessibility, and ultimately lowers electrochemical performance. Therefore, it is necessary to composite MXene with other electrode materials and design a good microstructure. This review affirms the enormous potential of flexible MXene and its composite materials in the field of supercapacitors. In addition, the challenges and possible improvements faced by MXene based materials in practical applications were also discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal Organic Frameworks Synthesis: The Versatility of Triethylamine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal Organic Frameworks (MOFs) are organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid materials with exceptionally customizable composition and properties. MOFs intrinsically possess open metal sites, tunable pore size/shape and an ultra&#8208;large specific surface area, and have obtained significant attention over the past 30 years. Furthermore, through the integration of functional moieties such as, molecules, functional groups, noble metal clusters and nanocrystals or nanoparticles into MOFs, the resulting composites have greatly enriched the physical and chemical properties of pure MOFs, enabling their application in a wider range of fields. Triethylamine (TEA) as an organic base has consistently played a fundamental role in the development of MOFs. In this Concept, the versatility of triethylamine when involved in the synthesis of MOFs is discussed. Four sections are used to elaborate on the role of TEA including: (1) Single crystal synthesis; (2) Size and morphology control; (3) Building block of MOFs; (4) MOFs composites synthesis. In the last part, we highlight the potential of TEA for further developments.</dc:description>

         <title>From the Iron Pentacarbonyl Cation to Heteroleptic &#951;6&#8208;arene Carbonyls and bis&#8208;&#951;6&#8208;arene Cations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Partial ligand substitution at the iron pentacarbonyl radical cation generates novel half&#8208;sandwich complexes of the type [Fe(&#951;6&#8208;arene)(CO)2]&#8226;+ (arene = 1,3,5&#8208;tri&#8208;tert&#8208;butylbenzene, 1,3,5&#8208;trimethylbenzene, benzene and fluorobenzene). Of those, the bulkier 1,3,5&#8208;tri&#8208;tert&#8208;butylbenzene (mes*) derivative [Fe(mes*)(CO)2]&#8226;+ was fully characterized by XRD analysis, IR, NMR, cw&#8208;EPR, M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry as the [Al(ORF)4]&#8722; (RF = C(CF3)3) salt. Chemical electronation, i.e., the single electron reduction, with decamethylferrocene generates neutral [Fe(mes*)(CO)2], whereas further deelectronation under CO&#8208;pressure leads to a dicationic three&#8208;legged [Fe(mes*)(CO)3]2+ salt with [Al(ORF)4]&#8211; counterion. The full substitution of the carbonyl ligands in [Fe(CO)5]&#8226;+[Al(ORF)4]&#8722; mainly resulted in disproportionation reactions, giving solid Fe(0) and the dicationic bis&#8208;arene salts [Fe(&#951;6&#8208;arene)2]2+([Al(ORF)4]&#8211;)2 (arene = 1,3,5&#8208;trimethylbenzene, benzene and fluorobenzene). Only by employing the very large fluoride bridged anion [F&#8208;{Al(ORF)3}2]&#8722;, it was possible to isolate an open shell bis&#8208;arene cation salt [Fe(C6H6)2]&#8226;+[F&#8208;{Al(ORF)3}2]&#8722;. The highly reactive cation was characterized by XRD analysis, cw&#8208;EPR, M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry. The disproportionation of [Fe(C6H6)2]&#8226;+ salts to give solid Fe(0) and [Fe(C6H6)2]2+ salts was analyzed by a suitable cycle, revealing that the thermodynamic driving force for the disproportionation is a function of the size of the anion used and the polarity of the solvent.</dc:description>

         <title>Aurones: Unexplored Visible&#8208;Light Photoswitches for Aqueous Medium</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of synthetically accessible photoswitches showing an efficient performance in aqueous medium has recently become an urgent task due to the rapid progress of photopharmacology and novel biomedical applications. In response to this challenge, in this work, aurone derivatives are introduced as a novel class of efficient visible&#8208;light photoswitches for aqueous medium. In general, aurones exhibit superior performance in water, including significantly higher quantum yields, compared with other indigoid photoswitches (hemithioindigo and hemiindigo). Especially remarkable are the half&#8208;lives of the photoinduced E&#8208;isomers of aurones in water, reaching up to 7 years. Further modification of the aurone scaffold with substituents that increase water solubility does not affect most of the photoswitching characteristics and even improves some them. The highly advantageous property profile of the aurone photoswitches make them a perfect novel platform for the design of light&#8208;controllable systems in the areas requiring photoswitching in aqueous medium.</dc:description>

         <title>Versatile Polymerization&#8208;Induced Emission Polymers from Barbier Polymerization of Cinnamic Esters with Tunable Emission</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cinnamic ester is a common and abundant chemical substance, which can be extracted from natural plants. Compared with traditional esters, cinnamic ester contains a,b &#8208;unsaturated carbonyl structure with multiple reactive sites, resulting in more abundant reactivities and chemical structures. Here, a versatile polymerization&#8208;induced emission (PIE) is successfully demonstrated through Barbier polymerization of cinnamic ester. Attributed to its abundant reactivities of a,b &#8208;unsaturated carbonyl structure, Barbier polymerization of cinnamic esters with different organodihalides gives polyalcohol and polyketone via 1,2&#8208;addition and 1,4&#8208;addition, respectively, which is also confirmed by small molecular model reactions. Meanwhile, these organodihalides dependant polyalcohol and polyketone exhibit different non&#8208;traditional intrinsic luminescence (NTIL) from aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) type to aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) type, where novel PIE luminogens (PIEgens) are revealed. Further potential applications in explosive detection are carried out, where it achieves TNT detection sensitivity at ppm level in solution and ng level on the test paper. This work therefore expands the structure and functionality libraries of monomer, polymer and NTIL, which might cause inspirations to different fields including polymer chemistry, NTIL, AIE and PIE.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoswitching in a Liquid Crystalline Pt(II) Coordination Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoswitching of photoluminescence has sparked tremendous research interests for super&#8208;resolution imaging, high&#8208;security&#8208;level anti&#8208;counterfeiting, and other high&#8208;tech applications. However, the excitation of photoluminescence is usually ready to trigger the photoswitching process, making the photoluminescence readout unreliable. Herein, we report a new photoswitch by the marriage of spiropyran with platinum(II) coordination complex. Viable photoluminescence can be achieved upon excitation by 480 nm visible light while the photoswitching can be easily triggered by 365 nm UV light. The feasible photoswitching may be benefited from the formed liquid crystalline phase of the designed photoswitch as a crystalline spiropyran is normally unable to implement photoswitching. Compared to the counterparts, this LC photoswitch can show distinct and reliable apparent colors and emission colors before and after photoswitching, which may promise the utility in high&#8208;security&#8208;level anti&#8208;counterfeiting and other advanced information technologies.</dc:description>

         <title>Supramolecular Polymer Network based on Electrophilic Substitution (ES) Adduct of Furan&#8208;Triazolinedione</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tailor&#8208;made homopolymer, poly(furfuryl methacrylate) (PFMA) was synthesized and engineered to a self&#8208;healable supramolecular thermoset via electrophilic substitution (ES) with a commercially available 1,2,4&#8208;triazoline&#8208;3,5&#8208;dione (TAD) derivative, 4&#8208;phenyl&#8208;TAD (PTAD).







Abstract
Polymers with furan functionality have been the subject of extensive research on developing sustainable materials applying a limited number of dynamic covalent approaches. Herein, we introduce a facile, dynamic non&#8208;covalent approach to make a furan polymer readily accessible for self&#8208;healing applications based on its electrophilic substitution (ES) with a commercially available 1,2,4&#8208;triazoline&#8208;3,5&#8208;dione (TAD) derivative, 4&#8208;phenyl&#8208;TAD (PTAD). A tailor&#8208;made furan polymer, poly(furfuryl methacrylate) (PFMA), considering it an initial illustrative example, was rapidly ES modified with PTAD to produce furfuryl&#8208;tagged triazolidine that subsequently associated via inter&#8208;molecular hydrogen (H&#8722;) bonding to produce a thermally reversible supramolecular polymer network under ambient conditions. The H&#8208;bonded network was experimentally quantified via ATR&#8208;IR analysis and theoretically rationalized via the density functional theory (DFT) study using smaller organic model compounds analogous to the macromolecular system. Thermoreversible feature of the H&#8208;bonded triazolidine&#8208;derived supramolecular polymer network enabled the solution reprocessing and self&#8208;healing of the polymer material.

         <title>Type&#8208;I photodynamic therapy induced by Pt&#8208;coordination of type&#8208;II photosensitizers into supramolecular complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Platinum coordination with type&#8208;II photosensitizer Cz&#8722;BTZ&#8722;Py enables type&#8208;I photodynamic therapy through exciton coupling between photosensitizer's ligands and enhanced spin&#8208;orbital coupling (SOC).







Abstract
Platinum supramolecular complexes based on photosensitizers have garnered great interest in photodynamic therapy (PDT) due to Pt (II) centers as chemotherapeutic agents to eliminate tumor cells completely, which greatly improve the antitumor efficacy of PDT. However, in comparison to precursor photosensitizer ligand, the formed platinum supramolecular complexes typically exhibit inferior outcomes in terms of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. How to boost ROS generation in the formed platinum supramolecular complexes for enhanced PDT is an enticing yet highly challenging task. Here we report a Pt&#8208;coordination&#8208;based dimeric photosensitizer complex (Cz&#8722;BTZ&#8722;Py)2Pt(OTf)2. It is found that comparing with photosensitizer ligand Cz&#8722;BTZ&#8722;Py, the formed supramolecular complex exhibit redshifts of absorption wavelength as well as enhanced ROS generation efficiency. Moreover, type&#8208;I ROS generation (O2&#8901;&#8722;) is produced in the formed platinum supramolecular complexes mainly due to a reduced energy gap &#916;EST resulting from exciton coupling between two photosensitizer ligands. And type&#8208;I ROS (O2&#8901;&#8722;) generation significantly amplifies the photodynamic therapy (PDT) outcomes. In&#8197;vitro evaluation shows excellent photochemotherapy performance of (Cz&#8722;BTZ&#8722;Py)2Pt(OTf)2 nanoparticles. We anticipate this work would provide a novel approach to design type&#8208;I photosensitizers for efficient PDT.

&lt;p&gt;Platinum coordination with type-II photosensitizer Cz&#8722;BTZ&#8722;Py enables type-I photodynamic therapy through exciton coupling between photosensitizer's ligands and enhanced spin-orbital coupling (SOC).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Platinum supramolecular complexes based on photosensitizers have garnered great interest in photodynamic therapy (PDT) due to Pt (II) centers as chemotherapeutic agents to eliminate tumor cells completely, which greatly improve the antitumor efficacy of PDT. However, in comparison to precursor photosensitizer ligand, the formed platinum supramolecular complexes typically exhibit inferior outcomes in terms of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. How to boost ROS generation in the formed platinum supramolecular complexes for enhanced PDT is an enticing yet highly challenging task. Here we report a Pt-coordination-based dimeric photosensitizer complex (Cz&#8722;BTZ&#8722;Py)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Pt(OTf)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. It is found that comparing with photosensitizer ligand Cz&#8722;BTZ&#8722;Py, the formed supramolecular complex exhibit redshifts of absorption wavelength as well as enhanced ROS generation efficiency. Moreover, type-I ROS generation (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8901;&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) is produced in the formed platinum supramolecular complexes mainly due to a reduced energy gap &#916;E&lt;sub&gt;ST&lt;/sub&gt; resulting from exciton coupling between two photosensitizer ligands. And type-I ROS (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8901;&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) generation significantly amplifies the photodynamic therapy (PDT) outcomes. &lt;i&gt;In&#8197;vitro&lt;/i&gt; evaluation shows excellent photochemotherapy performance of (Cz&#8722;BTZ&#8722;Py)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Pt(OTf)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanoparticles. We anticipate this work would provide a novel approach to design type-I photosensitizers for efficient PDT.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>[2,2]Paracyclophane Bridged, Thiophene Based Macrocycles: Synthesis and Electronic Properties in Different Redox States</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
[2,2]paracyclophane (pCp) bridged, thiophene&#8208;based macrocycles were sythesisized, and their electronic properties at diffferent oxidation states were investigated. The dications are open&#8208;shell diradical dications, while the tetracations have closed&#8208;shell ground state. There is almost no through&#8208;space electronic coupling through the pCp units, and thus no global aromaticity.







Abstract
The study of through&#8208;space electronic coupling in &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems remains an underexplored area. In this work, we present the facile synthesis of two isomeric macrocycles (1 and 2) bridged by [2,2]paracyclophane (pCp) and based on thiophene. The structures of these macrocycles have been confirmed through X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis. Our investigation centers on their electronic properties across various redox states, with a specific focus on potential through&#8208;space electronic coupling and global aromaticity. Experimental measurements, including UV&#8208;vis&#8208;NIR electronic absorption, NMR, ESR spectra, and X&#8208;ray diffraction, combined with theoretical calculations, reveal that both the neutral compounds and their tetracations exhibit a closed&#8208;shell ground state. However, their dications manifest as diradical dications with a subtle magnetic exchange interaction. Consequently, the through&#8208;space electronic coupling facilitated by the pCp unit in their respective ground states appears to be weak.

         <title>&#948;&#8208;bonding and spin&#8208;orbit coupling make SrAg4Sb2 a topological insulator</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8208;metal &#948; bonding creates a band inversion in the layered phase SrAg4Sb2 which makes a topological crystalline insulator. Spin&#8208;orbit coupling splits a degenerate pair of &#948;* bands which have an avoided crossing with a &#963; band. This is a new insight into the chemical origin of topological materials.







Abstract
Bonding interactions and spin&#8208;orbit coupling in the topological insulator SrAg4Sb2 are investigated using DFT with orbital projection analysis. Ag&#8722;Ag delta bonding is a key ingredient in the topological insulating state because the 
 delta antibonding band forms a band inversion with the 5&#8197;s sigma bonding band. Spin&#8208;orbit coupling is required to lift d orbital degeneracies and lower the antibonding band enough to create the band inversion. These bonding effects are enabled by a longer&#8208;than&#8208;covalent Ag&#8722;Ag distance in the crystal lattice, which might be a structural characteristic of other transition metal based topological insulators. A simplified model of the topological bands is constructed to capture the essence of the topological insulating state in a way that may be engineered in other materials.

         <title>Regio&#8208; and Enantioselective Synthesis of 1,2&#8208;Diamines by Formal Hydroamination of Enamines: Scope, Mechanism, and Asymmetric Synthesis of Orthogonally Protected Bis&#8208;Piperazines as a Privileged Scaffold</title>

         <dc:description>
Chiral 1,2&#8208;diamines are an important structural motif in organic synthesis, and can be prepared by an efficient Cu&#8722;H catalyzed asymmetric hydroamination of enamines. The applicability of the hydroamination protocol is demonstrated by an asymmetric synthesis of a MC&#8208;4 receptor antagonist. The origin of the excellent enantioselectivity is investigated using DFT calculations.







Abstract
We have previously reported the first formal hydroamination of enamines for the synthesis of chiral 1,2&#8208;diamines. Here, we describe: (i) the discovery, optimization, and substrate expansion of this reaction; (ii) a novel and straightforward protocol for the &#8220;click&#8208;type&#8221; synthesis of enamines in quantitative yield utilizing sodium sulfate in a dual role as an ancillary and dehydrating agent without the need for workup or purification; (iii) the application of this methodology to the first enantioselective synthesis of orthogonally protected 1,1&#8242;&#8208;(1&#8208;(4&#8208;fluorophenyl)ethane&#8208;1,2&#8208;diyl) piperazines, a scaffold for rapid lead optimization in drug discovery; (iv) a computational investigation into the mechanism and rationalization of the enantioselectivities of the reaction.

         <title>Protein&#8208;Templated Ugi Reactions versus In&#8208;Situ Ligation Screening: Two Roads to the Identification of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Main Protease Inhibitors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The primary target in corona virus infections, SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 main protease, was employed as a template for Ugi four&#8208;component reactions delivering potent inhibitors of the enzyme. However, in&#8208;situ ligation screening of Ugi products was found to be superior to protein templation, enabling the fast and efficient discovery of protease inhibitors. Best inhibitors stabilized protein dimers detectable by mass spectrometry.







Abstract
Protein&#8208;templated fragment ligation was established as a method for the rapid identification of high affinity ligands, and multicomponent reactions (MCR) such as the Ugi four&#8208;component reaction (Ugi 4CR) have been efficient in the synthesis of drug candidates. Thus, the combination of both strategies should provide a powerful approach to drug discovery. Here, we investigate protein&#8208;templated Ugi 4CR quantitatively using a fluorescence&#8208;based enzyme assay, HPLC&#8208;QTOF mass spectrometry (MS), and native protein MS with SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 main protease as template. Ugi reactions were analyzed in aqueous buffer at varying pH and fragment concentration. Potent inhibitors of the protease were formed in presence of the protein via Ugi 4CR together with Ugi three&#8208;component reaction (Ugi 3CR) products. Binding of inhibitors to the protease was confirmed by native MS and resulted in the dimerization of the protein target. Formation of Ugi products was, however, more efficient in the non&#8208;templated reaction, apparently due to interactions of the protein with the isocyanide and imine fragments. Consequently, in&#8208;situ ligation screening of Ugi 4CR products was identified as a superior approach to the discovery of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 protease inhibitors.

         <dc:description>
Nanoflower&#8208;like high&#8208;entropy CoFeCrMoMnOx/NF spinel catalyst exhibits outstanding electrocatalytic OER activity with an ultralow overpotential of 188&#8197;mV, surpassing most multicomponent electrocatalysts reported previously due to the synergistic effect between different metal elements. In&#8208;situ Raman spectra illustrate that the formation of &#947;&#8208;NiOOH on the high&#8208;entropy spinel surface is a crucial active species for the OER.







Abstract
Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is the key anode reaction of electrolytic water. To improve the slow OER kinetics, we synthesize nanoflower&#8208;like Co&#8722;Fe&#8208;Cr&#8722;Mo&#8208;Mn high&#8208;entropy spinel (HES) nanosheets on nickel foam (NF) by one&#8208;step solvothermal method, which exhibit an overpotential (&#951;10) of only 188&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, much lower than bimetallic CoFeOx/NF (233&#8197;mV), trimetallic CoFeCrOx/NF (211&#8197;mV), and tetrametallic CoFeCrMoOx/NF (200&#8197;mV). The OER overpotential decreases with the increase of the number of metals, indicating that the formation of HES has a positive effect on the improvement of electrocatalytic performance, since the synergistic effect between different metals enhances the charge transfer rate and decreases reaction barrier. In&#8208;situ Raman spectra demonstrate that the formation of &#947;&#8208;NiOOH on the HES surface is a crucial active species for the OER. This work demonstrates a simple and efficient synthesis method to prepare nanoflower&#8208;like high&#8208;entropy electrocatalysts for efficient OER electrocatalysis.

&lt;p&gt;Nanoflower-like high-entropy CoFeCrMoMnO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;/NF spinel catalyst exhibits outstanding electrocatalytic OER activity with an ultralow overpotential of 188&#8197;mV, surpassing most multicomponent electrocatalysts reported previously due to the synergistic effect between different metal elements. In-situ Raman spectra illustrate that the formation of &#947;-NiOOH on the high-entropy spinel surface is a crucial active species for the OER.

         <title>Total Synthesis of Ganoderma Meroterpenoids Cochlearol B and Its Congeners Driven by Structural Similarity and Biological Homology</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, driven by the high structural similarity between the homologous Ganoderma meroterpenoids cochlearol B and ganocin B, two chemically synthetic strategies were designed and investigated sequentially for the synthesis of cochlearol B from ganocin B. These strategies include intramolecular metal&#8208;catalyzed hydrogen atom transfer (MHAT) and intramolecular photochemical [2+2] cycloaddition. The aim was to reveal their potential biosynthetic conversion relationship using chemical synthesis methods. As a result, a highly efficient total synthesis of cochlearol B, cochlearol T, cochlearol F, as well as the formal total synthesis of ganocins A&#8211;B, and ganocochlearins C&#8211;D, has been achieved. Additionally, a novel synthetic approach for the synthesis of 6,6&#8208;disubstituted 6H&#8208;dibenzo[b,d]pyran and its analogues has been developed through palladium(II)&#8208;catalyzed Wacker&#8208;type/cross&#8208;coupling cascade reactions.







Abstract
Secondary metabolites that have the same biological origin must share some relationship in their biosynthesis. Exploring this relationship has always been a significant task for synthetic biologists. However, from the perspective of synthetic chemists, it is equally important to propose, prove, or refute potential biosynthetic pathways in order to elucidate and understand the biosynthesis of homologous secondary metabolites. In this study, driven by the high structural similarity between the homologous Ganoderma meroterpenoids cochlearol B and ganocin B, two chemically synthetic strategies were designed and investigated sequentially for the synthesis of cochlearol B from ganocin B. These strategies include intramolecular metal&#8208;catalyzed hydrogen atom transfer (MHAT) and intramolecular photochemical [2+2] cycloaddition.

         <title>One&#8208;Step Photochemical Preparation of CdS/Poly(MMA&#8208;co&#8208;MAA) Composite with Enhanced Photocatalytic Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new route from photo&#8208;energy to material and environmental application was displayed, by one&#8208;step photochemical preparation of CdS/Poly(MMA&#8208;co&#8208;MAA) and photocatalytic degradation of methyl blue. The compositing way allows CdS particles to have close contact with oxygen atoms with negative charge characteristics, promoting the electron&#8208;hole separation and effectively enhancing the activity.







Abstract
This paper presents a one&#8208;step photochemical method for the preparation of CdS/Poly(MMA&#8208;co&#8208;MAA) composite photocatalyst, based on the concept of simultaneous photocatalytic polymerization of organic monomers during UV&#8208;light induced formation of CdS. The preparation is carried out in an aqueous solution of Na2S2O3, CdSO4, methyl methacrylate (MMA) and methacrylic acid (MAA), under a UV lamp. The continuously formed CdS particles with photocatalytic activity act the role of initiator to directly initiate the copolymerization of MMA and MAA, resulting in the in&#8197;situ formation of the composite and full contact of the CdS particles with the oxygen&#8208;containing groups in the polymer. Taking the photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue as a case study, the composite exhibited significantly higher activity under simulated solar light compared to the pure CdS. By analysis on various data, the enhanced photocatalytic activity is attributed to the enhanced visible light absorption, and especially the high electron&#8208;hole separation efficiency caused by the electrostatic interaction between photogenerated holes and carbonyl oxygen atoms with negatively charged features. Furthermore, the composite displays excellent sunlight activity and recyclability, suggesting its potential for practical applications. Such a one&#8208;step construction strategy relying only on photo&#8208;energy is green, low&#8208;cost and promising in obtaining high&#8208;performance semiconductor/polymer composite photocatalysts.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supercapacitor is an important energy storage device widely used in the automobile industry, military production, and communication equipment because of its fast charge&#8208;discharge rate, and high power density. Herein, carbon quantum dots modified and Y3+ doped Ni3(NO3)2(OH)4 (NiY@CQDs) nanospheres are prepared by a solvothermal method and used as an electrode material. The electrochemical properties of NiY@CQDs were measured in a three&#8208;electrode system. An asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) cell was assembled with activated carbon (AC) as the anode and NiY@CQDs as the cathode. The electrochemical properties of the ASC device were measured in a two&#8208;electrode system. Experimental results show the shape of NiY@CQDs is petal&#8208;shaped and the introducing carbon quantum dots and doping Y3+ significantly increases the specific surface area, conductivity, and specific capacitance of Ni3(NO3)2(OH)4. The mass&#8208;specific capacitance of NiY@CQDs reaches up to 2944 F&#183;g&#8208;1 at a current density of 1 A&#183;g&#8208;1. The asymmetric supercapacitor of NiY@CQDs//AC has a high energy density of 138.65 Wh&#183;kg&#8722;1 at a power density of 1500 W&#183;kg&#8722;1, displaying a wide range of application prospects in the energy storage area.</dc:description>

         <title>Crystal, Solution, and Computational Study of the Structure of Ortho&#8208;Lithium N,N&#8208;Diisopropyl&#8208;P,P&#8208;Diphenylphosphinothioic Amide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ortho&#8208;lithiated phosphinothioic amides have been structurally characterized by X&#8208;ray diffraction and NMR spectroscopy in solution for the first time. DFT studies supported the existence of monomeric lithiated compounds and provided insight into their conformational behavior and the DoLi mechanism. The ortho anion transformed into a benzo[b]phosphindole 5&#8208;sulfide via a dearomatized species characterized by NMR spectroscopy.







Abstract
The first crystal structure of an ortho&#8208;lithium phosphinothioic amide complexed with tetramethylethylenediamine 12 is reported. The complex consists of a spirane in which the spiro&#8208;lithium is N,N&#8208; and C,S&#8208;chelated by the diamine and organophosphorus ligands, respectively. The analogous ortho anion 14 obtained by Sn(IV)/Li transmetallation in THF has also been synthesized. Nuclear magnetic resonance study of both anions showed that they exist as monomers in solution and are involved in dynamic processes including the restricted rotation around the P&#8722;N bond. 14 is converted at room temperature by nucleophilic cyclization to the dearomatized anion 15, which evolves after a few hours to the benzophosphindole sulfide 16. Density functional theory calculations supported the aggregation state in solution and were used to explore the conformational space of anion 12, the mechanism of ortho&#8208;lithiation directed by P(X)&#8722;N (X=O, S) groups, and the mechanism of formation of 15.

Density functional theory calculations supported the aggregation state in solution and were used to explore the conformational space of anion &lt;b&gt;12&lt;/b&gt;, the mechanism of &lt;i&gt;ortho-&lt;/i&gt;lithiation directed by P(X)&#8722;N (X=O, S) groups, and the mechanism of formation of &lt;b&gt;15&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mechanochemical C&#8722;H Arylation and Alkylation of Indoles Using 3d Transition Metal and Zero&#8208;Valent Magnesium</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although the 3d transition&#8208;metal catalyzed C&#8722;H functionalization have been extensively employed to promote the formation of valuable carbon&#8208;carbon bonds, the persistent problems, including the use of sensitive Grignard reagents and the rigorous operations (solvent&#8208;drying, inert gas protection, metal pre&#8208;activation and RMgX addition rate control), still leave great room for further development of sustainable methodologies. Herein, we report a mechanochemical technology toward in&#8208;situ preparation of highly sensitive organomagnesium reagents, and thus building two general 3d transition&#8208;metal catalytic platforms that enables regioselective arylation and alkylation of indoles with a wide variety of halides (including those containing post transformable functionalities and heteroaromatic rings). This mechanochemical strategy also brings unique reactivity and high step&#8208;economy in producing functionalized N&#8208;free indole products.</dc:description>

         <title>Magnetic&#8208;Plasmonic Nanocomposites as Versatile Substrates for Surface&#8208;enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS) Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) spectroscopy, a highly sensitive technique for detecting trace&#8208;level analytes, relies on plasmonic substrates. The choice of substrate, its morphology, and the excitation wavelength are crucial in SERS applications. To address advanced SERS requirements, the design and use of efficient nanocomposite substrates have become increasingly important. Notably, magnetic&#8208;plasmonic (MP) nanocomposites, which combine magnetic and plasmonic properties within a single particle system, stand out as promising nanoarchitectures with versatile applications in nanomedicine and SERS spectroscopy. In this review, we present an overview of MP nanocomposite fabrication methods, explore surface functionalization strategies, and evaluate their use in SERS. Our focus is on how different nanocomposite designs, magnetic and plasmonic properties, and surface modifications can significantly influence their SERS&#8208;related characteristics, thereby affecting their performance in specific applications such as separation, environmental monitoring, and biological applications. Reviewing recent studies highlights the multifaceted nature of these materials, which have great potential to transform SERS applications across a range of fields, from medical diagnostics to environmental monitoring. Finally, we discuss the prospects of MP nanocomposites, anticipating favorable developments that will make substantial contributions to various scientific and technological areas.</dc:description>

         <title>Covalent Post&#8208;Synthetic Modification of Metal&#8208;Organic Cages: Concepts and Recent Progress</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal&#8208;organic cages (MOCs) are supramolecular coordination complexes that have internal cavities for hosting guest molecules and exhibiting various properties. However, the functions of MOCs are limited by the choice of the building blocks. Post&#8208;synthetic modification (PSM) is a technique that can introduce new functional groups and replace existing ones on the MOCs without changing their geometry. Among many PSM methods, covalent PSM is a promising approach to modify MOCs with tailored structures and functions. Covalent PSM can be applied to either the internal cavity or the external surface of the MOCs, depending on the functionality expected to be customized. However, there are still some challenges and limitations in the field of covalent PSM of MOCs, such as the balance between the stability of MOCs and the harshness of organic reactions involved in covalent PSMs. This concept article introduces the organic reaction types involved in covalent PSM of MOCs, their new applications after modification, and summarizes and provides an outlook of this research field.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoinduced Puffing with Large Volume Expansion and Photomechanical Motions induced by Topochemical [4+4] Reactions in Molecular Crystal Solvates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rice puffing, a phenomenon where neat rice grains turn to a fluffy voluminous and porous puffed rice when heated to a certain temperature, has been mimicked using light. Irradiation of a crystal solvate (containing a solvent in the crystal lattice)&#8216; of an anthracene&#8208;benzhydrazide based molecule with 405&#8197;nm light results in a puffed crystal with a large volume expansion.







Abstract
In this work, we report the first example of two crystal solvates of an anthracene&#8208;benzhydrazide based molecule (Ant) that display very distinct photo&#8208;responsive behaviour when 365 or 405&#8197;nm or visible light is illuminated. For the first time, the crystal hydrate that has water molecule in the lattice (hereafter named as Ant&#8722;H2O) display fascinating puffing behavior with large volume expansion upto 50&#8201;% accompanied with surface modulation when illuminated with 405&#8197;nm light, a phenomenon very much similar to the rice or popcorn puffing by thermal treatment. Utilizing the properties of photoconverted Ant&#8722;H2O crystals, we have demonstrated their application in photoinduced enhanced liquid absorption using various liquids/solutions. The other crystal solvate having DMF in the crystal lattice (hereafter named as Ant&#8722;DMF) responds to 405&#8197;nm light by bending, twisting, chopping, jumping or splitting etc. The chopping of Ant&#8722;DMF crystal was also observed under ambient/white light but at a slower rate compared to 405&#8197;nm light. Single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction study reveals that the photoinduced puffing and photomechanical effects of these materials are rooted to the topochemical [4+4] cycloaddition reaction between the anthracene moieties that facilitate molecular packing change assisted by the reconfiguration of intermolecular non&#8208;covalent interactions involving lattice trapped solvent molecules.

         <title>Generalist versus Specialist Self&#8208;Replicators</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Darwinian evolution, including the selection of the fittest species under given environmental conditions, is a major milestone in the development of synthetic living systems. In this regard, generalist or specialist behavior (the ability to replicate in a broader or narrower, more specific food environment) are of importance. Here we demonstrate generalist and specialist behavior in dynamic combinatorial&#160; libraries composed of a peptide&#8208;based and an oligo(ethylene glycol) based building block. Three different sets of macrocyclic replicators could be distinguished based on their supramolecular organization: two prepared from a single building block as well as one prepared from an equimolar mixture of them. Peptide&#8208;containing hexamer replicators were found to be generalists, i.e. they could replicate in a broad range of food niches, whereas the octamer peptide&#8208;based replicator and hexameric ethyleneoxide&#8208;based replicator were proven to be specialists, i.e. they only replicate in very specific food niches that correspond to their composition. However, sequence specificity cannot be demonstrated for either of the generalist replicators. The generalist versus specialist nature of these replicators was linked to their supramolecular organization. Assembly modes that accommodate structurally different building blocks lead to generalist replicators, while assembly modes that are more restrictive yield specialist replicators.</dc:description>

         <title>Stereocontrol via Propeller Chirality in FLP&#8208;Catalyzed Asymmetric Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Utilization of chiral frustrated Lewis pairs as catalysts in enantioselective hydrogenation of unsaturated molecules represents a promising approach in asymmetric synthesis. In our effort to improve our current understanding of the factors governing the stereoselectivity in these catalytic processes, herein we examined the mechanism of direct hydrogenation of aromatic enamines catalyzed by a binaphthyl&#8208;based chiral amino&#8208;borane. Our computational analysis reveals that only one particular conformer of the key borohydride reaction intermediate can be regarded as a reactive form of this species. This borohydride conformer has a well&#8208;defined chiral propeller shape, which induces facial selectivity in the hydride transfer to pro&#8208;chiral iminium intermediates. The propeller chirality of the reactive borohydride conformer is generated by the axially chiral binaphthyl scaffold of the amino&#8208;borane catalyst through stabilizing&#160;&#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Utilization of chiral frustrated Lewis pairs as catalysts in enantioselective hydrogenation of unsaturated molecules represents a promising approach in asymmetric synthesis. In our effort to improve our current understanding of the factors governing the stereoselectivity in these catalytic processes, herein we examined the mechanism of direct hydrogenation of aromatic enamines catalyzed by a binaphthyl-based chiral amino-borane. Our computational analysis reveals that only one particular conformer of the key borohydride reaction intermediate can be regarded as a reactive form of this species. This borohydride conformer has a well-defined chiral propeller shape, which induces facial selectivity in the hydride transfer to pro-chiral iminium intermediates. The propeller chirality of the reactive borohydride conformer is generated by the axially chiral binaphthyl scaffold of the amino-borane catalyst through stabilizing&#160;&#960;-&#960; stacking interactions. This new computational insight can be readily used to interpret the high degree of stereoinduction observed for these reactions. We expect that the concept of chirality relay could be further exploited in catalyst design endeavors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Structure and Photophysics of N&#8208;Tolanyl&#8208;phenochalcogenazines and their Radical Cations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The study focuses on the structural and photophysical characteristics of neutral and oxidized forms of N&#8208;tolanyl&#8208;phenochalcogenazines PZX&#8208;tolan with X = O, S, Se, and Te. X&#8208;ray crystal structure analyses show a pseudo&#8208;equatorial (pe) structure of the tolan substituent in the O, S, and Se dyads, while the Te dyad possesses a pseudo&#8208;axial (pa) structure. DFT calculations suggest the pe structure for O and S, and the pa structure for Se and Te as stable forms. Steady&#8208;state and femtosecond&#8208;time resolved optical spectroscopy in toluene solution indicate that the O and S dyads emit from a CT state, whereas the Se and Te dyads emit from a tolan&#8208;localized state. The T1 state is tolan&#8208;localized in all cases, showing phosphorescence at 77 K. The heavy atom effect of chalcogens induces intersystem crossing from S1 to Tx, resulting in a decreasing S1 lifetime from 2.1 ns to 0.42 ps. The T1 states possess potential for singlet oxygen sensitization with a high quantum yield (ca. 40%) for the O, S, and Se dyads. Radical cations exhibit spin density primarily localized at the heterocycle. EPR measurements and quasirelativistic DFT calculations reveal a very strong g&#8208;tensor anisotropy, supporting the pe structure for the S and Se derivatives.</dc:description>

         <title>Divergent Reactivity of a Cyclic Bis&#8208;Hydridostannylene: A Masked Sn(I) Diradicaloid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, reactivity studies of a cyclic bis&#8208;hydridostannylene [(ADC)SnH]2 (1&#8208;H2) (ADC = PhC{(NDipp)C}2; Dipp = 2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3) with various unsaturated organic substrates are reported. Reactions of terminal alkynes (RC&#8801;CH) with 1&#8208;H2 afford mixed acetylide&#8208;vinyl&#8208;functionalized bis&#8208;stannylenes via dehydrogenation and hydro&#173;stannylation. Treatment of 1&#8208;H2 with PhC&#8801;CCH3 gives a unique distannabarrelene via dehydrogenative C(sp3)&#8211;H stannylation and hydrostannylation of the C&#8801;CCH3 moiety. 1&#8208;H2 undergoes dehydro&#173;genative [2+2]&#8208;cycloaddition reactions with diphenylacetylene, azobenzene, acetone, benzophenone, and benzaldehyde to form the 1,4&#8208;distannabarrelene derivatives. The elimination of H2 in these reactions suggests the masked&#8208;diradical property of 1&#8208;H2. In fact, these [2+2]&#8208;cycloaddition products are also accessible on treatments of the Sn(I) diradicaloid [(ADC)Sn]2 (1) with appropriate reagents. All compounds have been characterized by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Moreover, the catalytic activity of 1&#8208;H2 has been shown for the hydroboration of unsaturated substrates.</dc:description>

         <title>Divergent Electrochemical Synthesis of Indoles through pKa Regulation of Amides: Synthetic and Mechanistic Insights</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A divergent synthetic approach to access highly substituted indole scaffolds is illustrated. By virtue of a tunable electrochemical strategy, distinct control over the C&#8208;3 substitution pattern was achieved by employing two analogous 2&#8208;styrylaniline precursors. The chemoselectivity is governed by the fine&#8208;tuning of the acidity of the amide proton, relying on the appropriate selection of N&#8208;protecting groups, and assisted by the reactivity of the electrogenerated intermediates. Detailed mechanistic investigations based on cyclic voltametric experiments and computational studies revealed the crucial role of water additive, which assists the proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer event for highly acidic amide precursors, followed by an energetically favorable intramolecular C&#8210;N coupling, causing exclusive fabrication of the C&#8208;3 unsubstituted indoles. Alternatively, the implementation of an electrogenerated cationic olefin activator delivers the C&#8208;3 substituted indoles through the preferential nucleophilic nature of the N&#8208;acyl amides. This electrochemical approach of judicious selection of N&#8208;protecting groups to regulate pKa/E&#176; provides an expansion in the domain of switchable generation of heterocyclic derivatives in a sustainable fashion, with high regio&#8208; and chemoselectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Combined Covalent and Supramolecular Polymerization to reinforce Perylenebisimide Photosynthetic &#8220;Quantasomes&#8221;</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>PSII&#8208;inspired quantasomes have emerged as promising artificial photosystems evolving oxygen from water due to their integrated multi&#8208;chromophore asset, hierarchical architecture, and efficient light&#8208;harvesting capabilities. In this study, we adopt a combined covalent and supramolecular strategy by implementing a poly&#8208;styrene backbone that reinforces proximity and pairing between adjacent perylenebisimide (PBI) quantasome units. The covalent fixation of the quantasome network results in a significant enhancement of the photoelectrocatalytic performance on engineered IO&#8208;ITO photoanodes, with up to 290% photocurrent increase (J cm&#8208;2 up to 100 &#181;A, &#955; &gt; 450 nm, applied bias &lt; 1.23 V vs RHE, F.E.O2 &gt; 80%) compared to the non&#8208;polymerized analog. Moreover, the direct PBI&#8208;quantasome polymerization on the photoanode surface was performed by light irradiation of the radical initiator 2,2&#8217;&#8208;Azobis(2&#8208;methylpropionamidine), improving the photoelectrode robustness under high solar irradiance (&gt; 8 suns) and limiting the photocurrent loss (&lt; 20%) at 1.52 V vs RHE compared to the non&#8208;polymerized system.</dc:description>

         <title>Focused Ultrasound&#8208;Responsive Nanocomposite with Near&#8208;Infrared II Mechanoluminescence for Spatiotemporally Selective Immune Activation in Lymph Nodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The immune regulation of the lymphatic system, especially the lymph node (LN),&#160;is of great significance for the treatment of diseases and the inhibition of pathogenic organisms spreading in the body. However, achieving precise spatiotemporal control of immune cell activation in LN in vivo remains a challenge due to tissue depth and off&#8208;target effects. Furthermore, minimally invasive and real&#8208;time feedback methods to monitor the regulation of the immune system in LN are lacking. Here, focused ultrasound responsive immunomodulator loaded nanoplatform (FURIN) with near&#8208;infrared II (NIR&#8208;II) luminescence is designed to achieve spatiotemporally controllable immune activation in LN. The NIR&#8208;II persistent luminescence of FURIN can track its delivery in LN through bioimaging. Under focused ultrasound (FUS) stimulation, the immunomodulator encapsulated in FURIN can be released locally in&#160;LN to activate immune cells such as dendritic cells and the NIR&#8208;II mechanoluminescence of FURIN provides real&#8208;time optical feedback signals for immune activation. This work points to a FUS mediated, spatiotemporal selective immune activation strategy in vivo with the feedback control of luminescence signals via ultrasound responsive nanocomposite, which is of great significance in improving the efficacy and reducing the side effect of immune regulation for the development of potential immunotherapeutic methods in the future.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Chiral Sulfoxides by A Cyclic Oxidation&#8208;Reduction Multi&#8208;Enzymatic Cascade Biocatalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Optically pure sulfoxides are valuable organosulfur compounds extensively employed in medicinal and organic synthesis. In this study, we present a biocatalytic oxidation&#8208;reduction cascade system designed for the preparation of enantiopure sulfoxides.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Optically pure sulfoxides are valuable organosulfur compounds extensively employed in medicinal and organic synthesis. In this study, we present a biocatalytic oxidation-reduction cascade system designed for the preparation of enantiopure sulfoxides. The system involves the cooperation of a low-enantioselective chimeric oxidase SMO (styrene monooxygenase) with a high-enantioselective reductase MsrA (methionine sulfoxide reductase A), facilitating &#8220;non-selective oxidation and selective reduction&#8221; cycles for prochiral sulfide oxidation. The regeneration of requisite cofactors for MsrA and SMO was achieved via a cascade catalysis process involving three auxiliary enzymes, sustained by cost-effective D-glucose. Under the optimal reaction conditions, a series of heteroaryl alkyl, aryl alkyl and dialkyl sulfoxides in R configuration were synthesized through this &#8220;one-pot, one step&#8221; cascade reaction. The obtained compounds exhibited high yields of &amp;gt;90% and demonstrated enantiomeric excess (ee) values exceeding 90%.

         <title>Pd&#8208;Catalysed Direct Arylation of Distyrylbenzene: Strong Dual&#8208;state Fluorescence and Electrochromism</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel Pd&#8208;catalysed direct arylation approach has been employed to introduce different aryl groups (neutral, electron&#8208;withdrawing, electron&#8208;rich aryl groups) onto fluorobenzene&#8208;containing DSB moiety. The compounds possess strong dual&#8208;state (solution and solid state) fluorescence with fluorescence quantum yields reaching up to &gt;98&#8201;%. One of the compounds exhibits visible&#8208;to&#8208;NIR reversible electrochromism with a colour from pristine light yellow to orange.







Abstract
Distyrylbenzenes (DSBs) are well&#8208;known for their strong multicolour fluorescence. Fluorescence tuning of DSB via further functionalization/arylation, on the other hand, is uncommon. This paper reports a Pd&#8208;catalysed direct arylation approach for introducing different aryl groups onto fluorobenzene&#8208;containing DSB moiety (7) in high yields (67&#8211;72&#8201;%). The versatile methodology allows the substitution of neutral [tolyl (1)], electron&#8208;deficient [p&#8208;formyl benzene (2), p&#8208;acetyl benzene (3), p&#8208;nitrobenzene (4)] and electron&#8208;rich [carbazole (5), triphenylamine (6)] aryl groups. The electron&#8208;deficient aryls render mono&#8208;substitution, while the electron&#8208;rich counterparts promote di&#8208;substitution. The compounds (1&#8211;6) show blue, green, and yellow fluorescence in both the solution and solid states; the fluorescence quantum yields reach &gt;98&#8201;% and the peak maxima span from 425 to 560&#8197;nm. The mono&#8208;carbazole DSB (5) exhibit white light emission (WLM) in polar solvents (acetone, DMF, CH3CN, DMSO and NMP) with very high fluorescence quantum yields (&#966;f) of 60&#8211;80&#8201;%. For WLM, such high efficiency (&#966;f) is somewhat uncommon. Moreover, visible&#8208;to&#8208;NIR reversible electrochromism is demonstrated by the TPA&#8208;integrated DSB (6). The colour of 6 changes from pristine light yellow to orange, and the absorption maxima shifts from 372 to 1500&#8197;nm when a positive potential of 1.0&#8197;V vs Ag/Ag+ is applied. Moreover, the system shows high colouration efficiency in the NIR region with fast switching speeds for colouration and decolouration as fast as 0.98&#8197;s and 1.05&#8197;s.

         <title>Enhancing the Features of DNA Mimic Foldamers for Structural Investigations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DNA mimic aromatic oligoamide helical foldamers possess no nucleobase and no ribose&#8208;phosphate backbones. Nevertheless, their structure can be designed so as to reproduce typical features of nucleic acids such has palindromic&#8208;like C2 symmetry, handedness control and extension by sticky ends to promote helix&#8208;helix associations.







Abstract
DNA mimic foldamers based on aromatic oligoamide helices bearing anionic phosphonate side chains have been shown to bind to DNA&#8208;binding proteins sometimes orders of magnitude better than DNA itself. Here, we introduce new features in the DNA mimic foldamers to facilitate structural investigations of their interactions with proteins. Thirteen new foldamer sequences have been synthesized and characterized using NMR, circular dichroism, molecular modeling, and X&#8208;ray crystallography. The results show that foldamer helix handedness can be quantitatively biased by means of a single stereogenic center, that the foldamer structure can be made C2&#8208;symmetrical as in palindromic B&#8208;DNA sequences, and that associations between foldamer helices can be promoted utilizing dedicated C&#8208;terminal residues that act as sticky ends in B&#8208;DNA structures.

         <title>Electrocatalytic activity of CO2 reduction to CO on cadmium sulfide enhanced by chloride anion doping</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Cl/CdS&#8208;NF&#8208;2 cathode exhibits good performance on electrocatalytic CO2 reduction to selectively produce CO in ionic liquid&#8208;based electrolytes. The highest Faradaic efficiency of CO can reach 98.1&#8201;% at &#8722;2.25&#8197;V versus Fc/Fc+ and a maximum jCO can be arrived 192.6&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;2.35&#8197;V versus Fc/Fc+ on Cl/CdS&#8208;NF&#8208;2 cathode.







Abstract
The electrocatalytic CO2 reduction (ECR) to produce valuable fuel is a promising process for addressing atmospheric CO2 emissions and energy shortages. In this study, Cl&#8208;anion doped cadmium sulfide structures were directly fabricated on a nickel foam surface (Cl/CdS&#8208;NF) using an in&#8197;situ hydrothermal method. The Cl&#8208;anion doping could significantly improve ECR activity for CO production in ionic liquid and acetonitrile mixed solution, compared to pristine CdS. The highest Faradaic efficiency of CO is 98.1&#8201;% on a Cl/CdS&#8208;NF&#8208;2 cathode with an excellent current density of 137.0&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;2.25&#8197;V versus ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+, all potentials are versus Fc/Fc+ in this study). In particular, CO Faradaic efficiencies remained above 80&#8201;% in a wide potential range of &#8722;2.05&#8197;V to &#8722;2.45&#8197;V and a maximum partial current density (192.6&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) was achieved at &#8722;2.35&#8197;V. The Cl/CdS&#8208;NF&#8208;2, with appropriate Cl anions, displayed abundant active sites and a suitable electronic structure, resulting in outstanding ECR activity. Density functional theory calculations further demonstrated that Cl/CdS is beneficial for increasing the adsorption capacities of *COOH and *H, which can enhance the activity of the ECR toward CO and suppress the hydrogen evolution reaction.

         <title>Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Chemodivergent Coupling of Alcohols: Efficient Routes to Access &#945;,&#945;&#8208;Disubstituted Ketones and &#945;&#8208;Substituted Chalcones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chemodivergent nickel&#8208;catalyzed approach provides &#945;,&#945;&#8208;disubstituted ketones from aryl&#8208;substituted secondary alcohols and benzyl alcohols via the borrowing hydrogen (BH) strategy in the presence of KOtBu, whereas exclusively &#945;&#8208;substituted chalcones were accomplished in the presence of mild base K2CO3 through an acceptorless dehydrogenative coupling (ADC) strategy.







Abstract
Chemodivergent (de)hydrogenative coupling of primary and secondary alcohols is achieved utilizing an inexpensive nickel catalyst, (6&#8208;OH&#8208;bpy)NiCl2. This protocol demonstrates the synthesis of branched carbonyl compounds, &#945;,&#945;&#8208;disubstituted ketones, and &#945;&#8208;substituted chalcones via borrowing hydrogen strategy and acceptorless dehydrogenative coupling, respectively. A wide range of aryl&#8208;based secondary alcohols are coupled with various primary alcohols in this tandem dehydrogenation/hydrogenation reaction. The nickel catalyst, along with KOtBu or K2CO3, governed the selectivity for the formation of branched saturated ketones or chalcones. A preliminary mechanistic investigation confirms the reversible dehydrogenation of alcohols to carbonyls via metal&#8208;ligand cooperation (MLC) and the involvement of radical intermediates during the reaction.

&lt;p&gt;Chemodivergent (de)hydrogenative coupling of primary and secondary alcohols is achieved utilizing an inexpensive nickel catalyst, (6-OH-bpy)NiCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. This protocol demonstrates the synthesis of branched carbonyl compounds, &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-disubstituted ketones, and &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-substituted chalcones &lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; borrowing hydrogen strategy and acceptorless dehydrogenative coupling, respectively. A wide range of aryl-based secondary alcohols are coupled with various primary alcohols in this tandem dehydrogenation/hydrogenation reaction. The nickel catalyst, along with KO&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt;Bu or K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, governed the selectivity for the formation of branched saturated ketones or chalcones. A preliminary mechanistic investigation confirms the reversible dehydrogenation of alcohols to carbonyls &lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; metal-ligand cooperation (MLC) and the involvement of radical intermediates during the reaction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis and Modular Reactivity of Low Valent Al/Zn Heterobimetallics Supported by Common Monodentate Amides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple and easy to access heterobimetallic system based on Al/Zn combinations is installed. Utilizing Cp*, HMDS and TMP ligands enables regioselective insertions of carbodiimides and ligand substitutions directly at the metal&#8208;metal bond. These transformations are accompanied by state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art quantum chemical calculations.







Abstract
Recent advances on low valent main group metal chemistry have shown the excellent potential of heterobimetallic complexes derived from Al(I) to promote cooperative small molecule activation processes. A signature feature of these complexes is the use of bulky chelating ligands which act as spectators providing kinetic stabilization to their highly reactive Al&#8722;M bonds. Here we report the synthesis of novel Al/Zn bimetallics prepared by the selective formal insertion of AlCp* into the Zn&#8722;N bond of the utility zinc amides ZnR2 (R=HMDS, hexamethyldisilazide; or TMP, 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidide). By systematically assessing the reactivity of the new [(R)(Cp*)AlZn(R)] bimetallics towards carbodiimides, structural and mechanistic insights have been gained on their ability to undergo insertion in their Zn&#8722;Al bond. Disclosing a ligand effect, when R=TMP, an isomerization process can be induced giving [(TMP)2AlZn(Cp*)] which displays a special reactivity towards carbodiimides and carbon dioxide involving both its Al&#8722;N bonds, leaving its Al&#8722;Zn bond untouched.

         <title>Experimental and Theoretical Studies on the Reactions of Aliphatic Imines with Isocyanates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reaction of isocyanates with imines derived from allyl glycinate and differently substituted propionaldehydes was investigated. For reactions with &#945;,&#945;&#8208;dimethylated imines either 2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;4H&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;oxadiazin&#8208;4&#8208;ones or 2,4&#8208;dioxo&#8208;6&#8208;(aryl&#8208;/alkylthio)tetrahydro&#8208;pyrimidines were obtained as major products, which are formed via a [4+2] cycloaddition pathway. In contrast, the formation of 1,3&#8208;diazetidinones via [2+2] cycloaddition was not observed. The different reaction outcomes were rationalized by DFT calculations.







Abstract
In the context of a project aiming at the replacement of the 3&#8208;substituted &#946;&#8208;lactam ring in classical &#946;&#8208;lactam antibiotics by an N(3)&#8208;acyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;diazetidinone moiety, we have investigated the reaction of isocyanates with imines derived from allyl glycinate and differently substituted propionaldehydes. Imines of aromatic aldehydes with anilines have been reported to react with acyl isocyanates to give 1,3&#8208;diazetidinones or 2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;4H&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;oxadiazin&#8208;4&#8208;ones, via [2+2] or [4+2] cycloaddition, respectively. However, neither of these products was formed with imines derived from allyl glycinate and 2&#8208;(mono)methyl propionaldehydes. &#945;,&#945;&#8208;Dimethylation of the imine enabled the [4+2] cycloaddition pathway, but the desired 1,3&#8208;diazetidinone products were not observed. Surprisingly, the imines obtained from thioesters of 2,2&#8208;dimethyl 3&#8208;oxo propionic acid reacted with aryl isocyanates or with benzyl isocyanate to give 5,5&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2,4&#8208;dioxo&#8208;6&#8208;(aryl&#8208;/alkylthio)tetrahydropyrimidines, via thiol displacement and re&#8208;addition to a putative six&#8208;membered iminium intermediate. These experimental results obtained for the reactions could be rationalized by DFT calculations. In addition, we have shown that N(3)&#8208;acyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;diazetidinone and 2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;4H&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;oxadiazin&#8208;4&#8208;one products can be distinguished based on experimental IR data in combination with theoretical reference spectra employing the IR spectra alignment (IRSA) algorithm. This discrimination was not possible by means of 1H, 13C, or 15N&#8197;NMR spectroscopy

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Triflate's bigger brother: The unprecedented tribrate anion [Br3CSO3]&#8211; is flanked by its smaller siblings, the triflate and the trichlate anions. The new big brother was obtained by bromination of phenyl methane sulfonate with KOBr, followed by splitting of the ester under basic conditions. The new anion was studied through X&#8208;ray diffraction of its potassium salt. Furthermore, the thermal decomposition was investigated, and the Raman data of the anion are reported. The background image shows the church tower of the famous cathedral of Cologne, the place of birth for the new anion. More information can be found in the Research Article by M.&#8197;S. Wickleder and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202303617).

Using short hybrid peptide as a model, we examined the fluorine substitution effect and illustrated the power of small, yet robust &#8216;magical element&#8217; in controlling the conformation. The comparative study carried out on their folding patterns with hydrogen&#8208;substituted analogs using SC&#8208;XRD, CD, and 2D&#8208;NMR studies provide valuable insights in fluorinated substrates&#8217; design as functional molecules.







Abstract
Fluorine, the tiny robust atom, with its unique features has captured the attention of scientists in recent times, especially in drug discovery with its integration in small molecules, peptides, and proteins. However, studies to understand the &#8216;fluorine effects&#8217; on the conformation of molecules that follow &#8216;beyond the rule of 5&#8217; are in the infancy yet significant in molecular design and function. For the first time, using short hybrid peptide sequence as an appropriate model, we examined the substitution effect (size, stereoelectronic effect, and hydrogen bonding) using X&#8208;ray diffraction, 2D&#8208;NMR, and CD studies. The comparative study on their folding patterns with hydrogen&#8208;substituted analogs can provide valuable insights into fluorinated substrates&#8217; design.

         <title>Defect engineering on electrocatalysts for sustainable nitrate reduction to ammonia: Fundamentals and regulations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Defect engineering holds tremendous potential for improving the electrochemical reduction of nitrate to ammonia through the precise modulation of the electronic and geometric structures of catalysts. This review provides a comprehensive overview of recent advancements in defect engineering for nitrate reduction, while also highlighting promising unexplored avenues for further progress in this field.







Abstract
Electrocatalytic nitrate (NO3&#8722;) reduction to ammonia (NH3) is a &#8220;two birds&#8208;one stone&#8221; method that targets remediation of NO3&#8722;&#8208;containing sewage and production of valuable NH3. The exploitation of advanced catalysts with high activity, selectivity, and durability is a key issue for the efficient catalytic performance. Among various strategies for catalyst design, defect engineering has gained increasing attention due to its ability to modulate the electronic properties of electrocatalysts and optimize the adsorption energy of reactive species, thereby enhancing the catalytic performance. Despite previous progress, there remains a lack of mechanistic insights into the regulation of catalyst defects for NO3&#8722; reduction. Herein, this review presents insightful understanding of defect engineering for NO3&#8722; reduction, covering its background, definition, classification, construction, and underlying mechanisms. Moreover, the relationships between regulation of catalyst defects and their catalytic activities are illustrated by investigating the properties of electrocatalysts through the analysis of electronic band structure, charge density distribution, and controllable adsorption energy.

         <title>Design Strategies toward High&#8208;Utilization Zinc Anodes for Practical Zinc&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This focused review summarizes the research status on developing high&#8208;utilization Zn anodes towards high&#8208;energy&#8208;density aqueous Zn&#8208;metal batteries. Three major strategies in achieving high Zn utilization, including using ultrathin Zn foils, engineering Zn powder anodes, and designing substrates for Zn electrodeposition are systematically discussed. Future prospects for advancing the practical application of aqueous Zn&#8208;metal batteries are proposed.







Abstract
Aqueous Zn&#8208;metal batteries (AZMBs) hold a promise as the next&#8208;generation energy storage devices due to their low cost and high specific energy. However, the actual energy density falls far below the requirements of commercial AZMBs due to the use of excessive Zn as anode and the associated issues including dendritic growth and side reactions. Reducing the N/P ratio (negative capacity/positive capacity) is an effective approach to achieve high energy density. A significant amount of research has been devoted to increasing the cathode loading and specific capacity or tuning the Zn anode utilization to achieve low N/P ratio batteries. Nevertheless, there is currently a lack of comprehensive overview regarding how to enhance the utilization of the Zn anode to balance the cycle life and energy density of AZMBs. In this review, we summarize the challenges faced in achieving high&#8208;utilization Zn anodes and elaborate on the modifying strategies for the Zn anode to lower the N/P ratio. The current research status and future prospects for the practical application of high&#8208;performance AZMBs are proposed at the end of the review.

         <title>Design Strategies towards Advanced Hydrogen Evolution Reaction Electrocatalysts at Large Current Densities</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To bridge the gap between academia and industry for water electrolysis to produce hydrogen, in this review, design strategies from five aspects including number of active sites, intrinsic activity of each site, charge transfer, mass transfer, and stability are summarized for achieving highly active and robust large&#8208;current&#8208;density hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalysts.







Abstract
Hydrogen (H2), produced by water electrolysis with the electricity from renewable sources, is an ideal energy carrier for achieving a carbon&#8208;neutral and sustainable society. Hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is the cathodic half&#8208;reaction of water electrolysis, which requires active and robust electrocatalysts to reduce the energy consumption for H2 generation. Despite numerous electrocatalysts have been reported by the academia for HER, most of them were only tested under relatively small current densities for a short period, which cannot meet the requirements for industrial water electrolysis. To bridge the gap between academia and industry, it is crucial to develop highly active HER electrocatalysts which can operate at large current densities for a long time. In this review, the mechanisms of HER in acidic and alkaline electrolytes are firstly introduced. Then, design strategies towards high&#8208;performance large&#8208;current&#8208;density HER electrocatalysts from five aspects including number of active sites, intrinsic activity of each site, charge transfer, mass transfer, and stability are discussed via featured examples. Finally, our own insights about the challenges and future opportunities in this emerging field are presented.

         <title>Stabilization and One Electron Reduction of a Silicon Analogue of a Carboxylic Acid Anhydride</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxidation of two 1,2&#8208;disilylenes and two abnormal N&#8208;heterocyclic silylenes with N2O lead to formation of the first uncoordinated silicon analogues of carboxylic acid anhydrides. Reaction of one with a dimagnesium&#8197;(I) compound proceeds via a one&#8208;electron reduction and formation of a magnesium sila&#8208;acid anhydride radical complexes.







Abstract
Reaction of the 1,2&#8208;disilylenes {(DipArAm)Si}2 (DipArAm=[(NDip)2CAr]&#8722;, Dip=2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl, Ar=4&#8208;C6H4But (Ar&#8217;) 1&#8201;a or Ph 1&#8201;b) and two abnormal N&#8208;heterocyclic silylenes, (DipArAm)SiOCSi{(NDip)2CAr} (Ar=Ar&#8217; 3&#8201;a or Ph 3&#8201;b) with N2O led to formation of unprecedented examples of uncoordinated silicon analogues of carboxylic acid anhydrides, (DipArAm)(O=)SiOSi(=O)(DipArAm) (Ar=Ar&#8217; 2&#8201;a or Ph 2&#8201;b). Both compounds have been fully characterized, and the mechanism of formation of one explored using DFT calculations. Reduction of sila&#8208;acid anhydride 2&#8201;a with a dimagnesium(I) compound, [{(MesNacnac)Mg}2] (MesNacnac=[(MesNCMe)2CH]&#8722;, Mes=mesityl), led to the one&#8208;electron reduction of the anhydride and formation of a magnesium complex of a sila&#8208;acid anhydride radical anion [(MesNacnac)Mg{(OSi(DipAr&#8217;Am)}2O] 5. A combination of EPR spectroscopic studies and DFT calculations reveal the unpaired electron to largely reside on one of the amidinate ligands of the complex.

         <title>Circularly Polarized Luminescence of Thiophene&#8208;Bridged Macrocyclic pseudo&#8208;meta [2.2]Paracyclophanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High yielding heterocyclization of 1,3butadiyne bridged pseudo&#8208;meta [2.2]paracyclophanes led to a new series of chiral carbon&#8208;based macrocycles. Analysis of their (chir)optical properties revealed an increase in quantum yield along with noticeable circularly polarized luminescence activity. The experimental results are theoretically supported using density&#8208;functional theory.







Abstract
Chiral organic molecules possessing high quantum yields, circular dichroism, and circularly polarized luminescence values have great potential as optically active materials for future applications. Recently, the identification of a promising class of inherently chiral compounds was reported, namely macrocyclic 1,3&#8208;butadiyne&#8208;linked pseudo&#8208;meta[2.2]paracyclophanes, displaying high circular dichroism and related gabs values albeit modest quantum yields. Increasing the quantum yields in an attempt to get bright circularly polarized light emitters, the high&#8208;yielding heterocyclization of those 1,3&#8208;butadiyne bridges resulting in macrocyclic 2,5&#8208;thienyls&#8208;linked pseudo&#8208;meta [2.2]paracyclophanes is herein described. The chiroptical properties of both, the previously reported 1,3&#8208;butadiyne, and the novel 2,5&#8208;thienyl bridged macrocycles of various sizes, are experimentally recorded, and theoretically described using density&#8208;functional theory.

         <title>Geometric and Electronic Engineering in Co/VN Nanoparticles to Boost Bifunctional Oxygen Electrocatalysis for Aqueous/Flexible Zn&#8208;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Modulating metal&#8208;metal and metal&#8208;support interactions is one of the potent tools for augmenting catalytic performance. Herein, highly active Co/VN nanoparticles are well dispersed on three&#8208;dimensional porous carbon nanofoam (Co/VN@NC) with the assistance of dicyandiamide. Studies certify that the consequential disordered carbon substrate reinforces the confinement of electrons, while the coupling of diverse components optimizes charge redistribution among species. Besides, theoretical analyses confirm that the regulated electron configuration can significantly tune the binding strength between the active sites and intermediates,&#160;thus optimizing reaction energy barriers.&#160;Therefore, Co/VN@NC exhibits a competitive potential difference (&#916;E, 0.65 V) between the half&#8208;wave potential of ORR and OER potential at 10 mA cm&#8722;2, outperforming Pt/C+RuO2 (0.67 V). Further, catalyst&#8208;based aqueous/flexible ZABs present superior performances with peak power densities of 156 and 85 mW cm&#8722;2, superior to Pt/C&#8208;based counterparts (128 and 73 mW cm&#8722;2). This research provides a pivotal foundation for the evolution of bifunctional catalysts in the energy sector.</dc:description>

         <title>Empowering Protein Engineering Through Recombination of Beneficial Substitutions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Directed evolution stands as a seminal technology for generating novel protein functionalities, a cornerstone in biocatalysis, metabolic engineering, and synthetic biology. Today, with the development of various mutagenesis methods and advanced analytical machines, the challenge of diversity generation and high&#8208;throughput screening platforms is largely solved, and one of the remaining challenges is: how to empower the potential of single beneficial substitutions with recombination to achieve the epistatic effect. This review overviews experimental and computer&#8208;assisted recombination methods in protein engineering campaigns. In addition, integrated and machine learning&#8208;guided strategies were highlighted to discuss how these recombination approaches contribute to generating the screening library with better diversity, coverage, and size. A decision tree was finally summarized to guide the further selection of proper recombination strategies in practice, which was beneficial for accelerating protein engineering.</dc:description>

         <title>"The Sulfur Dance" Around Arenes and Heteroarenes &#8208; the Reversible Nature of Nucleophilic Aromatic Substitutions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We disclose the features of a category of reversible nucleophilic aromatic substitutions in view of their significance and generality in dynamic aromatic chemistry. Exchange of sulfur components surrounding arenes and heteroarenes may occur at 25&#176;C, in a process that one may call a "sulfur dance&#8221;. These SNAr systems present their own features, apart from common reversible reactions utilized in dynamic chemistry (DCC). By varying conditions, covalent dynamics may operate to provide libraries of thiaarenes with some selectivity, or conversion of a hexa(thio)benzene asterisk into another one. The reversible nature of SNAr is confirmed by three methods: a convergence of the products distribution in reversible SNAr systems, a related product redistribution between two per(thio)benzenes by using a thiolate promoter, and from kinetic/thermodynamic data. A four&#8208;component dynamic covalent system further illustrates the thermodynamically&#8208;driven formation of a thiacalix[2]arene[2]pyrimidine by sulfur component exchanges. This work stimulates the implementation of reversible SNAr in aromatic chemistry and in DCC.</dc:description>

         <title>TS&#8208;1@MCM&#8208;48 Core&#8208;Shell Catalysts for Efficient Oxidation of&#160;p&#8208;Diethylbenzene&#160;to High Value&#8208;Added Derivatives</title>

         <dc:description>To expand the market capacity of p&#8208;diethylbenzene (PDEB), core&#8208;shell zeolite (TS&#8208;1@MCM&#8208;48) is designed as a catalyst for PDEB oxidation. TS&#8208;1@MCM&#8208;48 catalyst is synthesized by in&#8208;situ crystallization method and characterized by X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscope (TEM), scanning electron microscope (SEM), X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), N2 adsorption&#8208;desorption, in&#8208;situ electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and 29Si nuclear magnetic resonance (29Si MAS&#8208;NMR). Oxidation of PDEB by H2O2 was investigated systematically in liquid phase. The conversion of PDEB over TS&#8208;1@MCM&#8208;48 was 28.1% and the total selectivity was 72.6%, where the selectivity of EAP (p&#8208;ethylacetophenone) and EPEA (4&#8208;ethyl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;methylbenzyl alcohol) was 28.6% and 44.0%, respectively. Compared with TS&#8208;1 and MCM&#8208;48 zeolite, the conversion rate of reactants and the selectivity of products have been significantly improved. The catalytic performance of TS&#8208;1@MCM&#8208;48 is derived from its well&#8208;crystallized microporous core and mesoporous shell with regular channels, which make active sites of TS&#8208;1 zeolite in the catalyst be fully utilized and mass transfer resistance be largely reduced. Further through theoretical calculation, we propose that the oxidation of PDEB is the result of the combination and mutual transformation of free radical process and carbocation process. Core&#8208;shell structure ensures the conversion rate of raw materials and improves the selectivity of products.</dc:description>

         <title>Boosting Energy&#8208;Transfer Processes via Dispersion Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present the generalized beneficial effect of naphthalene and its simple derivatives on energy&#8208;transfer reactions. Increased reactions rates and higher yields are achieved for several reactivities, varying substrates, solvents, light sources and photocatalysts. The consistent trend is observed using molar excess of naphthalene or a catalytic amount of tailored bi&#8208;naphthyl derivatives. These findings can be broadly used to improve existing methods as well as to shrink the efforts required to develop new ones.







Abstract
The generation of open&#8208;shell intermediates under mild conditions has opened broad synthetic opportunities during this century. However, these reactive species often require a case specific and tailored tuning of experimental parameters in order to efficiently convert substrates into products. We report a general approach that can overcome these ubiquitous limitations for several visible&#8208;light promoted energy&#8208;transfer processes. The use of either naphthalene (5&#8211;20&#8197;equiv.) or simple binaphthyl derivatives (10&#8211;30&#8197;mol&#8201;%) greatly increases their efficiency, giving rise to a new strategy for catalysis. The trend is consistent among different media, photocatalysts, light sources and substrates, allowing one to improve existing methods, to more easily optimize conditions for new ones, and, moreover, to disclose otherwise inaccessible reaction pathways.

         <title>The Catalytic Asymmetric Allylic Alkylation of Acyclic Enolates for the Construction of Quaternary and Tetrasubstituted Chiral Centres</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To facilitate the discovery and development of new pharmaceuticals, the demand for novel stereofunctionalised building blocks has never been greater. Whilst molecules bearing quaternary and tetrasubstituted stereogenic centres are ideally suited to explore untapped areas of chemical space, the asymmetric construction of&#8239;sterically congested carbon centres remains a longstanding challenge in organic synthesis. The enantioselective assembly of acyclic stereogenic centres is even more demanding due to the need to restrict a much wider range of geometries and conformations of the intermediates involved. In this context, the catalytic asymmetric allylic&#8239;alkylation (AAA) of acyclic prochiral nucleophiles, namely enolates, has become an indispensable tool to access a range of linear&#8239;&#945;&#8208;quaternary and&#8239;&#945;&#8208;tetrasubstituted carbonyl compounds. However, unlike the AAA of cyclic enolates with a fixed enolate geometry, to achieve high levels of stereocontrol in the AAA of acyclic enolates, the stereoselectivity of enolisation must be considered. The aim of this review is to offer a&#8239;comprehensive&#8239;discussion of catalytic AAA reactions of acyclic prochiral enolates and their analogues to generate congested quaternary and tetrasubstituted chiral centres using metal, non&#8208;metal and dual catalysis, with particular focus given to the control of enolate geometry and its impact on the stereochemical outcome of the reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Toward Efficient and Stereoselective Aromatic and Dearomative Cope Rearrangements: Experimental and Theoretical Investigations of &#945;&#8208;Allyl&#8208;&#945;&#8217;&#8208;Aromatic &#947;&#8208;Lactone Derivatives.</title>

         <dc:description>The aromatic Cope rearrangement is an elusive transformation that has been the subject to limited number of investigations compared to those seemingly close analogues, namely the Cope and aromatic Claisen rearrangement. Herein we report our investigations inspired by moderate success observed in the course of pioneering works. By careful experimental and theoretical investigations, we demonstrate that key substitutions on 1,5&#8208;hexadiene scaffold allow fruitful transformations. Especially, efficient functionalisation of the heteroaromatic rings results from the aromatic Cope rearrangement, while highly stereoselective interrupted aromatic Cope rearrangements highlight the formation of chiral compounds through a dearomative process.</dc:description>

         <title>Reduction&#8208;Specified Coupling Reactions of Nitroarenes by Heterogeneous Cobalt Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The in&#8208;depth study on reduction&#8208;specified coupling reactions of the nitroarenes by heterogeneous cobalt catalysis opens a door for diversified syntheses of functional N&#8208;containing molecules. Guided by the structure&#8208;function relationship of heterogeneous materials, rational design of nano&#8208;catalysts can effectively regulate the routes of organic reactions. Precise transformation of the intermediates generated during the nitroarene reduction with a suitable nano&#8208;catalyst is a promising way to develop new tandem reactions, and to synthesize structurally novel compounds that are of difficult access with the conventional approaches.</dc:description>

         <title>Chalcogen Atom Size: A Key Parameter in Modulating Carbonyl Compound Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Exchanging oxygen in the functional group C=O (i.e., carbonyl) for the&#160;less electronegative Group 16 elements sulfur or selenium, unexpectedly enhances the electronegativity of the C=X group in &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules and reduces the molecular &#960; HOMO&#8211;LUMO energy gap. Quantum&#8208;chemical analyses revealed that the steric size of the chalcogen atom X is at the origin of this seemingly counterintuitive behavior. This tuning of the chemical properties of carbonyl compounds by varying the chalcogen atom size in the C=X bond can be applied in many fields of chemistry. This concept article delineates several useful applications in the fields of organocatalysis, supramolecular chemistry, and photo(electro)chemistry.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The site&#8208;selective modification of complex biomolecules by transition metal&#8208;catalysis is highly warranted, but often thwarted by the presence of Lewis basic functional groups. This study demonstrates that protonation of amines and phosphates in carbohydrates circumvents catalyst inhibition in palladium&#8208;catalyzed site&#8208;selective oxidation. Both aminoglycosides and sugar phosphates, compound classes that up till now largely escaped direct modification, are oxidized with good efficiency. Site&#8208;selective oxidation of kanamycin and amikacin was used to prepare a set of 3&#8217;&#8209;modified aminoglycoside derivatives of which two showed promising activity against antibiotic&#8208;resistant E. coli strains.</dc:description>

         <title>Immobilised Ruthenium Complexes for the Electrooxidation of&#160;5&#8208;Hydroxymethylfurfural</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abundantly available biomass&#8208;based platform chemicals, including 5&#8208;hydroxymethyl furfural (HMF), are essential stepping stones in steering the chemical industry away from fossil fuels. The efficient catalytic oxidation of HMF to its diacid derivative, 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA), is a promising research area with potential applications in the polymer industry. Currently, the most encouraging approaches are based on solid&#8208;state catalysts and are often conducted in basic aqueous media, conditions where HMF oxidation competes with its decomposition. Efficient molecular catalysts are practically unknown for this reaction. In this study, we report on the synthesis and electrocatalysis of surface&#8208;bound molecular ruthenium complexes for the transformation of HMF to FDCA under acidic conditions. Catalyst immobilisation on mesoporous indium tin oxide electrodes is achieved through the incorporation of phosphonic acid anchoring groups. Screening experiments with HMF and further reaction intermediates revealed the catalytic route and bottlenecks in the catalytic synthesis of FDCA. Utilising these immobilised electrocatalysts, FDCA yields of up to 85% and faradaic efficiencies of 91% were achieved, without any indication of substrate decomposition. Surface analysis by X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) post&#8208;electrocatalysis unveiled the desorption of the catalyst from the electrode surface as a limiting factor in terms of catalytic performance.</dc:description>
