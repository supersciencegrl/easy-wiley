         <title>Decoding directing groups and their pivotal role in C&#8211;H activation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synthetic organic chemistry has witnessed a plethora of functionalization and defunctionalization strategies. In this regard, C&#8211;H functionalization has been at the forefront due to the multifarious applications in the development of simple to complex molecular architectures and holds a brilliant prospect in drug development and discovery. Despite been explored tremendously by chemists, this functionalization strategy still enjoys the employment of novel metal catalysts as well metal&#8208;free organic ligands. Moreover, the switch to photo and electrochemistry has widened our understanding of the alternative pathways  via  which a reaction can proceed and these strategies have garnered prominence when applied to C&#8211;H activation.&#160;Synthetic chemists have been foraging for new directing groups and templates for the selective activation of C&#8211;H bonds from a myriad of carbon&#8208;hydrogen bonds in aromatic as well as aliphatic systems. As a matter of fact, by varying the templates and directing groups, scientists found the answer to the challenge of distal C&#8211;H bond activation which remained an obstacle for a very long time. Moreover, green chemistry and metal&#8208;free reaction conditions have seen light in the past few decades due to the rising concern about environmental issues.&#160;Also, research groups across the world are developing rational strategies for directing group free or non&#8208;directed protocols that are just guided by ligands. This review encapsulates the research works pertinent to C&#8211;H bond activation and discusses the science devoted to it at the fundamental level.&#160;A detailed picture of this field and its progress with time has been portrayed in lucid scientific language with a motive to inculcate and educate scientific minds about this beautiful strategy with an overview of the most relevant and significant works of this era. The unique trait of this review is the detailed description and classification of various directing groups and their utility over a wide substrate scope.</dc:description>

         <title>Aurophilic Interactions in Multi&#8208;Radical Species: Electronic&#8208;Spin and Redox Properties of Bis&#8208; and Tris&#8208;[(Nitronyl Nitroxide)&#8208;Gold(I)] Complexes with Phosphine&#8208;Ligand Scaffolds</title>

         <dc:description>We synthesized multinuclear&#8208;Au(I) complexes with two or three nitronyl nitroxide&#8208;2&#8208;ide radical anion and phosphine&#8208;ligand scaffolds, (NN&#8208;Au)2&#8208;1o, (NN&#8208;Au)2&#8208;1m, and (NN&#8208;Au)2&#8208;1p, to investigate the influence of Au(I)&#8208;Au(I) (aurophilic) interactions on the properties of multi&#8208;spin molecular systems. The desired complexes were successfully prepared in moderate yields using a one&#8208;pot synthetic method from the corresponding phosphine ligand, Au(I) source, and parent NN, and sodium hydroxide. Among these prepared complexes, compound (NN&#8208;Au)2&#8208;1o, where an aurophilic interaction was clearly observed by crystal structure analysis, showed characteristic spin&#8208;spin interactions, electrochemical properties, and solvatochromic behavior. Results from theoretical calculations also suggested that the differences in their properties between complex (NN&#8208;Au)2&#8208;1o and the other complexes are due to intramolecular aurophilic interactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Trifaceted Mickey Mouse Amphiphiles for Programmable Self&#8208;Assembly, DNA Complexation and Organ&#8208;Selective Gene Delivery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mickey Mouse molecular nanoparticles with a trehalose&#8208;based cyclooligosaccharide core and uneven distributions of cationic (C, red lobules) and lipophilic patches (L, blue lobules) co&#8208;assemble with plasmid DNA (pDNA, orange chains) to afford transfectious nanacomplexes with programmable topologies and internal structures, ranging from multilamellar spheroids and rods to core&#8208;shell arrangements, translating into amazing cell efficiencies in&#8197;vitro and organ selectivities in&#8197;vivo with no need of targeting labels.







Abstract
Instilling segregated cationic and lipophilic domains with an angular disposition in a trehalose&#8208;based trifaceted macrocyclic scaffold allows engineering patchy molecular nanoparticles leveraging directional interactions that emulate those controlling self&#8208;assembling processes in viral capsids. The resulting trilobular amphiphilic derivatives, featuring a Mickey Mouse architecture, can electrostatically interact with plasmid DNA (pDNA) and further engage in hydrophobic contacts to promote condensation into transfectious nanocomplexes. Notably, the topology and internal structure of the cyclooligosaccharide/pDNA co&#8208;assemblies can be molded by fine&#8208;tuning the valency and characteristics of the cationic and lipophilic patches, which strongly impacts the transfection efficacy in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo. Outstanding organ selectivities can then be programmed with no need of incorporating a biorecognizable motif in the formulation. The results provide a versatile strategy for the construction of fully synthetic and perfectly monodisperse nonviral gene delivery systems uniquely suited for optimization schemes by making cyclooligosaccharide patchiness the focus.

         <title>Aryne Multicomponent Reactions by Directed C&#8722;H Activation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Arynes are known to undergo multicomponent reactions in non C&#8722;H active variants. The present article provides the application of in&#8208;situ generated arynes in multicomponent C&#8722;H activation reactions catalyzed by palladium and assisted by a combination of the additives sodium pivalate and potassium triflate. Unlike the earlier versions, phenanthridinones (heterocycles) were not observed in the 2&#8208;component fashion.







Abstract
Arylation via ortho C&#8722;H activation by the aid of directing groups has been explored recently by many researchers. Herein, a palladium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H arylation using 8&#8208;aminoquinoline as a bidentate directing group has been developed. The reaction furnishes only C&#8722;H arylation, unlike previous methods where cyclization to corresponding isoquinolones is observed. More interestingly, sequential C&#8722;H functionalization was observed when methylacrylate and acrylonitrile was added; this led to C&#8722;H olefination with the aryl group, which was installed from the aryne precursor.

         <title>Low&#8208;Temperature Direct Electrochemical Methanol Reforming Enabled by CO&#8208;Immune Mo&#8208;Based Hydrogen Evolution Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Finding an antidote: Electrochemical methanol reforming to hydrogen is a simple, yet underdeveloped, approach for hydrogen storage; however, conventional metal catalysts are poisoned either by methanol crossover or by intermediate species (such as CO) from the corresponding methanol oxidation. Herein, the relative immunity of Mo&#8208;based catalysts to CO is demonstrated, and the origins of this behavior are explored, with surprising implications for the general mechanism of H2 evolution on Mo&#8208;based catalysts.







Abstract
Hydrogen storage in the form of intermediate artificial fuels such as methanol is important for future chemical and energy applications, and the electrochemical regeneration of hydrogen from methanol is thermodynamically favorable compared to direct water splitting. However, CO produced from methanol oxidation can adsorb to H2&#8208;evolution catalysts and drastically reduce activity. In this study, we explore the origins of CO immunity in Mo&#8208;containing H2&#8208;evolution catalysts. Unlike conventional catalysts such as Pt or Ni, Mo&#8208;based catalysts display remarkable immunity to CO poisoning. The origin of this behavior in NiMo appears to arise from the apparent inability of CO to bind Mo under electrocatalytic conditions, with mechanistic consequences for the H2&#8208;evolution reaction (HER) in these systems. This specific property of Mo&#8208;based HER catalysts makes them ideal in environments where poisons might be present.

         <title>Quantitative Structure&#8208;Property Relationship Modelling for the Prediction of Singlet Oxygen Generation by Heavy&#8208;Atom&#8208;Free BODIPY Photosensitizers**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Data on singlet oxygen generation for a library of heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free BODIPYs undergoing spin&#8208;orbit charge transfer intersystem crossing (SOCT&#8208;ISC) were used to build quantitative structure&#8208;property relationship (QSPR) predictive models. These models estimate quantum yields of singlet oxygen (1O2) generation for a given photosensitizer structure in nonpolar, moderately polar and highly polar solvent. This allows for virtual screening of environment&#8208;activatable BODIPY photosensitizers and hence speeding up the development of new lead compounds for photomedicine.







Abstract
Heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free sensitizers forming long&#8208;living triplet excited states via the spin&#8208;orbit charge transfer intersystem crossing (SOCT&#8208;ISC) process have recently attracted attention due to their potential to replace costly transition metal complexes in photonic applications. The efficiency of SOCT&#8208;ISC in BODIPY donor&#8208;acceptor dyads, so far the most thoroughly investigated class of such sensitizers, can be finely tuned by structural modification. However, predicting the triplet state yields and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation quantum yields for such compounds in a particular solvent is still very challenging due to a lack of established quantitative structure&#8208;property relationship (QSPR) models. In this work, the available data on singlet oxygen generation quantum yields (&#934;&#916;) for a dataset containing &gt;70 heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free BODIPY in three different solvents (toluene, acetonitrile, and tetrahydrofuran) were analyzed. In order to build reliable QSPR model, a series of new BODIPYs were synthesized that bear different electron donating aryl groups in the meso position, their optical and structural properties were studied along with the solvent dependence of singlet oxygen generation, which confirmed the formation of triplet states via the SOCT&#8208;ISC mechanism. For the combined dataset of BODIPY structures, a total of more than 5000 quantum&#8208;chemical descriptors was calculated including quantum&#8208;chemical descriptors using density functional theory (DFT), namely M06&#8208;2X functional. QSPR models predicting &#934;&#916; values were developed using multiple linear regression (MLR), which perform significantly better than other machine learning methods and show sufficient statistical parameters (R=0.88&#8211;0.91 and q2=0.62&#8211;0.69) for all three solvents. A small root mean squared error of 8.2&#8201;% was obtained for &#934;&#916; values predicted using MLR model in toluene. As a result, we proved that QSPR and machine learning techniques can be useful for predicting &#934;&#916; values in different media and virtual screening of new heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free BODIPYs with improved photosensitizing ability.

         <title>Axial Ligand Coordination Tuning of the Electrocatalytic Activity of Iron Porphyrin Electrografted onto Carbon Nanotubes for the Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A time&#8208;saving electrografting method (within a couple of minutes) for the covalent functionalization of carbon nanotube surfaces with an imidazole or thiophene ligand that is axially coordinated with iron porphyrin as electrocatalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) has been demonstrated. The N&#8208;imidazole&#8208;coordinated catalyst, MWCNT&#8208;Im&#8208;FeF20TPP, exhibited the highest ORR activity followed by the S&#8208;thiophene and O&#8208;carboxylate axially coordinated catalysts.







Abstract
The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is essential in many life processes and energy conversion systems. It is desirable to design transition metal molecular catalysts inspired by enzymatic oxygen activation/reduction processes as an alternative to noble&#8208;metal&#8208;Pt&#8208;based ORR electrocatalysts, especially in view point of fuel cell commercialization. We have fabricated bio&#8208;inspired molecular catalysts electrografted onto multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) in which 5,10,15,20&#8208;tetra(pentafluorophenyl) iron porphyrin (iron porphyrin FeF20TPP) is coordinated with covalently electrografted axial ligands varying from thiophene to imidazole on the MWCNTs&#8217; surface. The catalysts&#8217; electrocatalytic activity varied with the axial coordination environment (i.&#8201;e., S&#8208;thiophene, N&#8208;imidazole, and O&#8208;carboxylate); the imidazole&#8208;coordinated catalyst MWCNTs&#8208;Im&#8208;FeF20TPP exhibited the highest ORR activity among the prepared catalysts. When MWCNT&#8208;Im&#8208;FeF20TPP was loaded onto the cathode of a zinc&#8722;air battery, an open&#8208;cell voltage (OCV) of 1.35&#8197;V and a maximum power density (Pmax) of 110&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 were achieved; this was higher than those of MWCNTs&#8208;Thi&#8208;FeF20TPP (OCV=1.30&#8197;V, Pmax=100&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and MWCNTs&#8208;Ox&#8208;FeF20TPP (OCV=1.28&#8197;V, Pmax=86&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and comparable with a commercial Pt/C catalyst (OCV=1.45&#8197;V, Pmax=120&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2) under similar experimental conditions. This study provides a time&#8208;saving method to prepare covalently immobilized molecular electrocatalysts on carbon&#8208;based materials with structure&#8211;performance correlation that is also applicable to the design of other electrografted catalysts for energy conversion.

         <title>Synthesis of Stannylated Aryl Imines and Amines via Aryne Insertion Reactions into Sn&#8722;N Bonds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of valuable ortho&#8208;stannylated anilines via aryne &#963;&#8208;insertion into Sn&#8722;N bonds is reported. Readily prepared stannylated imines were identified as suitable N&#8722;Sn&#8208;donors, offering the possibility to modify both introduced substituents in follow up reactions using the rich Sn&#8208;chemistry and deprotection of the imine.







Abstract
The reaction of in&#8197;situ generated arynes with stannylated imines to provide ortho&#8208;stannyl&#8208;aniline derivatives is reported. The readily prepared trimethylstannyl benzophenone imine is introduced as an efficient reagent to realize the aryne &#963;&#8208;insertion reaction. The imine functionality is an established N&#8208;protecting group and insertions proceed with good yields and good to excellent regioselectivities. The product anilines are valuable starting materials for follow&#8208;up chemistry thanks to the rich chemistry offered by the trimethylstannyl moiety.

         <title>1,2&#8208; or 1,3&#8208;Hydride Shifts: What Controls Guaiane Biosynthesis?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A systematic exploration of the reachable chemical space for guaianes is provided by DFT calculations that show that 1,3&#8208;hydride migrations are exceptional events in guaiane biosynthesis. They are only possible for stereochemically distinct skeletons and open the way to unusual guaianes. The relevance of a 1,3&#8208;hydride shift for guai&#8208;4(15)&#8208;en&#8208;11&#8208;ol synthase from poplar was shown experimentally by isotopic labeling.







Abstract
A systematic computational study addressing the entire chemical space of guaianes in conjunction with an analysis of all known compounds shows that 1,3&#8208;hydride shifts are rare events in guaiane biosynthesis. As demonstrated here, 1,3&#8208;hydride shifts towards guaianes can only be realized for two stereochemically well defined out of numerous possible stereoisomeric skeletons. One example is given by the mechanism of guaia&#8208;4(15)&#8208;en&#8208;11&#8208;ol synthase from California poplar, an enzyme that yields guaianes with unusual stereochemical properties. The general results from DFT calculations were experimentally verified through isotopic&#8208;labeling experiments with guaia&#8208;4(15)&#8208;en&#8208;11&#8208;ol synthase.

         <title>Breaking the Passivation: Sodium Borohydride Synthesis by Reacting Hydrated Borax with Aluminum</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cost&#8208;effective way to produce NaBH4 with high yield by ball milling hydrated borax (Na2B4O7&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;10H2O) with cheap Al or Al88Si12 at ambient condition is presented. An effective strategy was developed to facilitate mass transfer during the reaction by introducing NaH to enable the formation of loose NaAlO2 instead of dense Al2O3 on Al surface, and by using Si as a milling additive that prevents agglomeration and also breaks up passivation layers.







Abstract
A significant obstacle in the large&#8208;scale applications of sodium borohydride (NaBH4) for hydrogen storage is its high cost. Herein, we report a new method to synthesize NaBH4 by ball milling hydrated sodium tetraborate (Na2B4O7&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;10H2O) with low&#8208;cost Al or Al88Si12, instead of Na, Mg or Ca. An effective strategy is developed to facilitate mass transfer during the reaction by introducing NaH to enable the formation of NaAlO2 instead of dense Al2O3 on Al surface, and by using Si as a milling additive to prevent agglomeration and also break up passivation layers. Another advantage of this process is that hydrogen in Na2B4O7&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;10H2O serves as a hydrogen source for NaBH4 generation. Considering the low cost of the starting materials and simplicity in operation, our studies demonstrate the potential of producing NaBH4 in a more economical way than the commercial process.

Cyclic alkyl(amino)carbene&#8208;stabilized (cyano)hydroboryl anions were synthesized by deprotonation of the corresponding (cyano)dihydroborane precursors.

Abstract
Cyclic alkyl(amino)carbene&#8208;stabilized (cyano)hydroboryl anions were synthesized by deprotonation of (cyano)dihydroborane precursors. While they display boron&#8208;centered nucleophilic reactivity towards organohalides, generating fully unsymmetrically substituted cyano(hydro)organoboranes, they show cyano&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;centered nucleophilic reactivity towards haloboranes, resulting in the formation of hitherto unknown linear 2&#8208;aza&#8208;1,4&#8208;diborabutatrienes.

         <title>Vacant Manganese&#8208;Based Perovskite Fluorides@Reduced Graphene Oxides for Na&#8208;Ion Storage with Pseudocapacitive Conversion/Insertion Dual Mechanisms</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Some like it hot or cold: A novel dual&#8208;vacancy manganese&#8208;based perovskite fluoride@reduced graphene oxide (rGO) was synthesized in one&#8208;pot, and its structure&#8208;activity relationship was analyzed by physical characterization and electrochemical methods. Ex&#8208;situ techniques were used to analyze the pseudo&#8208;capacitance conversion/intercalation dual Na&#8208;ion energy storage mechanisms. Finally, assembled Na&#8208;ion capacitors and Na&#8208;based dual&#8208;ion batteries showed good electrochemical performance at high (40&#8201;&#176;C) or low (&#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C) temperature.







Abstract
Na&#8208;ion capacitors (NICs) and Na&#8208;based dual&#8208;ion batteries (Na&#8208;DIBs) have been considered to be promising alternatives to traditional lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) because of the abundance and low cost of the Na&#8208;ion, but their energy density, power density and life cycle are limited. Herein, dual&#8208;vacancy (including K+ and F&#8722; vacancies) perovskite fluoride K0.86MnF2.69@reduced graphene oxide (rGO; recorded as Mn&#8722;G) as anode for NICs and Na&#8208;DIBs has been developed. The special conversion/intercalation dual Na&#8208;ion energy storage mechanism and pseudocapacitive dynamics are analyzed in detail. The Mn&#8722;G//AC NICs and Mn&#8722;G//KS6 Na&#8208;DIBs delivered a maximum energy density of 92.7 and 187.6&#8197;W&#8201;h&#8201;kg&#8722;1, a maximum power density of 20.2 and 21.12&#8197;kW&#8201;kg&#8722;1, and long cycle performance of 61.3 and 68.4&#8201;% after 1000&#8197;cycles at 5&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1, respectively. Moreover, Mn&#8722;G//AC NICs and Mn&#8722;G//KS6 Na&#8208;DIBs can work well over a wide range of temperatures (&#8722;20 to 40&#8201;&#176;C). These results make it competitive in Na&#8208;ion storage applications with high energy/power density over a wide temperature range.

         <title>Mechanoredox Chemistry as an Emerging Strategy in Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The application of mechanical force to a material can lead to the generation of electric charge; piezoelectricity. For the first time, this effect has been harnessed and applied to radical reactions under ball&#8208;milling conditions, this Concept briefly describes the first appearances of this ground&#8208;breaking technique in the literature.







Abstract
Recent research endeavors have established that the mechanochemical activation of piezoelectric materials can open new avenues in redox chemistry. Impact forces, such as those imparted by a ball mill, have been shown to transform piezoelectric materials such as barium titanate (BaTiO3) into a highly polarized state, which can then donate an electron to a suitable oxidant and receive an electron from a suitable reductant, mimicking established photoredox catalytic cycles. Proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept studies have elucidated that mechanoredox chemistry holds great potential in sustainable and efficient radical&#8208;based synthesis.

A simple strategy has been successfully adopted to retain N atoms in&#8197;situ and increase production yield of a novel composite PAZ by mixing 3&#8197;wt&#8201;% of zinc borate (ZB) with poly(acrylonitrile&#8208;co&#8208;itaconic acid) (PANIA). After being carbonised at 700&#8201;&#176;C, PAZ&#8208;CF&#8208;700 maintains 90&#8201;% of the original N from PANIA. At the same time, PAZ&#8208;CF&#8208;700 also exhibits a good rate performance and excellent long&#8208;term cycling stability with a specific capacity of 94&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after 4000 cycles at 1.6&#8197;A&#8201;g&#8722;1.







Abstract
Retaining nitrogen for polyacrylonitrile (PAN) based carbon anode is a cost&#8208;effective way to make full use of the advantages of PAN for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). Here, a simple strategy has been successfully adopted to retain N atoms in&#8197;situ and increase production yield of a novel composite PAZ by mixing 3&#8197;wt&#8201;% of zinc borate (ZB) with poly (acrylonitrile&#8208;co&#8208;itaconic acid) (PANIA). Among the prepared carbonised fibre (CF) samples, PAZ&#8208;CF&#8208;700 maintains the highest N content, retaining 90&#8201;% of the original N from PANIA.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Retaining nitrogen for polyacrylonitrile (PAN) based carbon anode is a cost-effective way to make full use of the advantages of PAN for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). Here, a simple strategy has been successfully adopted to retain N atoms &lt;i&gt;in&#8197;situ&lt;/i&gt; and increase production yield of a novel composite PAZ by mixing 3&#8197;wt&#8201;% of zinc borate (ZB) with poly (acrylonitrile-co-itaconic acid) (PANIA). Among the prepared carbonised fibre (CF) samples, PAZ-CF-700 maintains the highest N content, retaining 90&#8201;% of the original N from PANIA. It represents the highest capacity storage contribution (80.55&#8201;%) and the lowest impedance &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;ct&lt;/sub&gt; (117&#8197;&#937;). Consequently, the specific capacity increases from 60&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; of PANIA-CF-700 to 190&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; of PAZ-CF-700 at a current density of 100&#8197;mA&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. At the same time, PAZ-CF-700 exhibits a good rate performance and excellent long-term cycling stability with a specific capacity of 94&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; after 4000 cycles at 1.6&#8197;A&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Zinc&#8208; and Cadmium meso&#8208;Aryl&#8208;Isoporphyrins: Non&#8208;Aromatic NIR Dyes with Distinct Conformational Features</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 30, Page 8021-8029, May 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new sign has risen in the porphyrin sky! Stable isoporphyrins can be produced as non&#8208;aromatic NIR dyes in yields up to 36&#8201;% by a one&#8208;pot process. Non&#8208;planar distortion modes are the key to control the optical spectra and the occurrence of isomers by means of synthesis. For the first time, the redox chemistry of isoporphyrins was studied by electrochemical methods, which is significant with regard to potential applications in photovoltaics.







Abstract
A series of pyrrolyl and dipyrrinyl isoporphyrins carrying different phenyl and thienyl groups is reported. The compounds are obtained by a one&#8208;pot approach in the presence of a template reagent. Thienyl derivatives gave better yields, and were the only subclass to form with steric hindrance. The structural analyses carried out on compounds 1 and 14 revealed distinct conformational differences which are likely to result from an intramolecular NH&#8230;Cl hydrogen bridge of the pyrrolyl subclass. In addition, this hydrogen bridge strongly favors one of the two possible atropisomers. Hindered rotation of the meso&#8208;aryl groups is observed only in the cases of methylbenzothienyl derivatives 10 and 15 and leads to the observation of several diastereomers. NIR absorptions up to 923&#8197;nm are found throughout. Electrochemical investigations into the 1e&#8722; and 2e&#8722; reduced species unravel axial ligand exchange dynamics for the zinc isoporphyrin radical, and the probable formation of a zinc phlorinate.

         <title>CO2 Capture by Hydroxylated Azine&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 30, Page 8048-8055, May 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent organic frameworks were investigated towards their CO2 capture properties as a function of their textural and chemical features. Experimental and theoretical data indicated that the relative number of hydroxyl groups in the COF backbone acts as an adsorption threshold. For the best performing COF, a variety of CO2 concentrations and temperatures were investigated, showing excellent isothermal recyclability up to 3 cycles.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) RIO&#8208;13, RIO&#8208;12, RIO&#8208;11, and RIO&#8208;11m were investigated towards their CO2 capture properties by thermogravimetric analysis at 1&#8197;atm and 40&#8201;&#176;C. These microporous COFs bear in common the azine backbone composed of hydroxy&#8208;benzene moieties but differ in the relative number of hydroxyl groups present in each material. Thus, their sorption capacities were studied as a function of their textural and chemical properties. Their maximum CO2 uptake values showed a strong correlation with an increasing specific surface area, but that property alone could not fully explain the CO2 uptake data. Hence, the specific CO2 uptake, combined with DFT calculations, indicated that the relative number of hydroxyl groups in the COF backbone acts as an adsorption threshold, as the hydroxyl groups were indeed identified as relevant adsorption sites in all the studied COFs. Additionally, the best performing COF was thoroughly investigated, experimentally and theoretically, for its CO2 capture properties in a variety of CO2 concentrations and temperatures, and showed excellent isothermal recyclability up to 3 cycles.

6&#8208;Cyano&#8208;7&#8208;azidoquinoline was synthesized and found to be non&#8208;emissive in water, while the amino derivative 6CN&#8722;7AQ exhibits intense emission, making the azido/amino pair excellent in sensing H2S. Moreover, conjugation of 6CN&#8722;7AQ with peptide renders a nearly non&#8208;emissive composite that can be digested by proteinase&#8208;K, recovering intense 6CN&#8722;7AQ emission with &#8764;200&#8208;fold enhancement.







Abstract
6&#8208;Cyano&#8208;7&#8208;aminoquinoline (6CN&#8722;7AQ) and 3&#8208;cyano&#8208;7&#8208;aminoquinoline (3CN&#8722;7AQ) were synthesized and found to exhibit intense emission with quantum yield as high as 63&#8201;% and 85&#8201;%, respectively, in water. Conversely, their derivatives 6&#8208;cyano&#8208;7&#8208;azidoquinoline (6CN&#8722;7N3Q) and 3&#8208;cyano&#8208;7&#8208;azidoquinoline (3CN&#8722;7N3Q) show virtually no emission, which makes them suitable to be used as recognition agents in azide reactions based on fluorescence recovery. Moreover, conjugation of 6CN&#8722;7AQ with a hydrophobic biomembrane&#8208;penetration peptide PFVYLI renders a nearly non&#8208;emissive 6CN&#8722;7AQ&#8208;PFVYLI composite, which can be digested by proteinase K, recovering the highly emissive 6CN&#8722;7AQ with &#8764;200&#8208;fold enhancement.

The first asymmetric catalytic approach to multilayer 3D chirality by using Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura cross&#8208;couplings in the presence of new chiral amide&#8208;phosphines is reported. The resulting multilayer products showed strong luminescence under UV irradiation, and displayed strong aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE).







Abstract

Giant molecules self&#8208;assemble into long&#8208;range ordered lamellar structures in bulk with ultra&#8208;small domain sizes (down to 3 nm), driven by the strong tendency and fast kinetics of crystallization for the vinyl polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (VPOSS) segment. This crystallization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly strategy may offer an opportunity to create integrated circuits (ICs) with ultra&#8208;small feature sizes by lithographic techniques for the microelectronic industry.

A new sign has risen in the porphyrin sky! Stable isoporphyrins can be produced as non&#8208;aromatic NIR dyes in yields up to 36% by a one&#8208;pot process. Non&#8208;planar distortion modes are the key to control the optical spectra and the occurrence of isomers by means of synthesis. For the first time, the redox chemistry of isoporphyrins was studied by electrochemical methods, which is significant with regard to potential applications in photovoltaics. The cover image shows the linear display of a zinc isoporphyrin as a constellation in the night sky of the northern hemisphere, between the constellations Orion and Big Dipper. In the foreground, the UV spectrum with the prominent NIR absorptions around 900&#8197;nm piles up as a mountain relief. More information can be found in the Full Paper by M. Br&#246;ring et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202100686).

Chirality has existed in nature from the early stages of life on Earth. A new form of chirality, multilayer 3D chirality, has been established involving nearly parallel patterns. This work presents the first asymmetric catalytic approach to multi&#8208;layer 3D chirality. New complexes of Pd and chiral amide&#8208;phosphine ligands were utilized as catalysts for Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling for assembling various multilayer 3D chiral molecules, which displayed strong luminescence under UV irradiation and strong aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) of different colors.

         <title>Mechanistic and Kinetic Factors of ortho&#8208;Benzyne Formation in Hexadehydro&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder (HDDA) Reactions</title>

         <dc:description>
This minireview highlights the mechanism of ortho&#8208;aryne formation via hexadehydro&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reactions, based on quantum chemical calculations, as well as kinetic, preparative and ultrafast spectroscopic experiments. The influence of the steric, electronic, and radical&#8208;stabilizing effects of substituents attached to diyne/diynophile pairs and linked yne&#8208;diynes provide crucial insight into the reaction mechanism.







Abstract
With the rapid development of the hexadehydro&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder reaction (HDDA) from its first discovery in 1997, the question of whether a concerted or stepwise mechanism better describes the thermally activated formation of ortho&#8208;benzyne from a diyne and a diynophile has been debated. Mechanistic and kinetic investigations were able to show that this is not a black or white situation, as minor changes can tip the balance. For that reason, especially, linked yne&#8208;diynes were studied to examine steric, electronic, and radical&#8208;stabilizing effects of their terminal substituents on the reaction mechanism and kinetics. Furthermore, the influence of the nature of the linker on the HDDA reaction was explored. The more recently discovered photochemical HDDA reaction also gives ortho&#8208;arynes, which display the same reactivity as the thermally generated ones, but their formation might not proceed by the same mechanism. This minireview summarizes the current state of mechanistic understanding of the HDDA reaction.

&#8216;Power'ful Aminations. A simple transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free direct electrolytic amination strategy has been developed. The transformation takes place in the absence of any electrocatalyst by using cheap and easily available graphite electrodes. The reaction allows for the synthesis of carbazole derivatives via intramolecular C&#8722;H amination and also cross&#8208;coupling of (hetero)arenes and various N&#8208;arylamides in an undivided cell set up. The usage of an acidic solvent was beneficial as it eliminated the requirement of additional supporting electrolytes for the electrolysis.







Abstract
A transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free direct electrolytic C&#8722;H amination involving an electrochemically generated nitrenium ion intermediate has been developed. The electrosynthesis takes place in the absence of any organoiodine catalysts and is enabled by an in&#8197;situ generated electrolyte.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&#8216;Power'ful Aminations&lt;/b&gt;. A simple transition-metal-free direct electrolytic amination strategy has been developed. The transformation takes place in the absence of any electrocatalyst by using cheap and easily available graphite electrodes. The reaction allows for the synthesis of carbazole derivatives via intramolecular C&#8722;H amination and also cross-coupling of (hetero)arenes and various N-arylamides in an undivided cell set up. The usage of an acidic solvent was beneficial as it eliminated the requirement of additional supporting electrolytes for the electrolysis.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A transition-metal-free direct electrolytic C&#8722;H amination involving an electrochemically generated nitrenium ion intermediate has been developed. The electrosynthesis takes place in the absence of any organoiodine catalysts and is enabled by an in&#8197;situ generated electrolyte. A novel, efficient intramolecular and intermolecular C&#8722;H amination has been demonstrated using a simple reaction setup.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Towards Heteroleptic Dicoordinate CuII Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 30, Page 7998-8002, May 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
By employing a bulky carbazolyl substituent, heteroleptic dicoordinate copper complexes with CuII character were synthesised. Delocalisation of the spin density in the ligand scaffold as well as dispersion forces apparently play a role in the stabilisation of these compounds.







Abstract
In this work we detail our efforts to systematically generate stable dicoordinate CuII complexes. Initial experiments via metathesis reactions of a bulky potassium carbazolide (RK) with copper(II) salts indeed yielded a stable product, RCuOTf (1). However, subsequent attempts to grasp systematic synthetic access to complexes of the type RCuX (X=monoanionic ligand) proved difficult as many of the complexes rapidly decomposed in solution. By using triflate&#8208;related ligands such as ethyl sulfate and bistriflimide, the additional dicoordinate copper complexes RCuOSO3Et (2), [RCu(THF)][Cu(NTf2)2] (3) and RCuNTf2 (4) could be isolated. Spectroscopic indications corroborate more CuI than CuII character in all RCuX derivatives.

         <title>Crystallization Induced Self&#8208;Assembly: A Strategy to Achieve Ultra&#8208;Small Domain Sizes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 30, Page 7992-7997, May 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lamellar morphologies with ultra&#8208;small domain sizes (down to 3&#8197;nm) are achieved by the self&#8208;assembly of giant molecules. The driven force for the phase separation is attributed to the strong tendency and fast kinetics for crystallization of vinyl polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (VPOSS) segment. Upon the gamma ray radiation followed pyrolysis, ultra&#8208;thin two dimensional nano&#8208;silica sheets are obtained due to polymerization of vinyl group in VPOSS.







Abstract
Achieving self&#8208;assembled nanostructures with ultra&#8208;small feature sizes (e.&#8201;g., below 5&#8197;nm) is an important prerequisite for the development of block copolymer lithography. In this work, the preparation and self&#8208;assembly of a series of giant molecules composed of vinyl polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (VPOSS) tethered with monodispersed oligo(L&#8208;lactide) chains are presented. Small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) results demonstrate that ultra&#8208;small domain sizes (down to 3&#8197;nm) of phase separated lamellar morphology are achieved in bulk, driven by the strong tendency and fast kinetics for crystallization of VPOSS moieties. Moreover, upon gamma ray radiation, VPOSS cages in the lamellar structure can be crosslinked via polymerization of the vinyl groups. After pyrolysis at high temperature, ultra&#8208;thin two&#8208;dimensional nano&#8208;silica sheets can be obtained.

         <title>Reevaluating the Solution Photophysics of Tetraphenylethylene at the Origin of their Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 30, Page 8003-8007, May 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through actinometric NMR evaluation of the photoisomerization kinetics of tetraphenylethylene simple derivatives, it is shown that process is the almost exclusive nonradiative pathway accounting for their luminescence quenching in solution, while photocyclization plays at best a minor role.







Abstract
Although tetraphenylethylene (TPE) and its derivatives have been the most commonly used building blocks in the construction of molecules with aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) properties, no absolute consensus exists regarding the mechanisms at the origin of the phenomenon. Restriction of intramolecular rotations (RIR) of peripheral phenyls has historically been a dominant paradigm, which has served as a valuable guideline in the molecular engineering of AIEgens. Yet, an increasing number of recent works have established that photoisomerization or photocyclization may actively participate in the nonradiative dissipation of the excitation energy. In this paper, the first experimental evaluation of the quantum efficiencies of these different processes is reported, and photoisomerization is shown to be by far the dominant photophysical pathway in solution, accounting for virtually all nonradiative decay of the molecule&#8216;s excited state in degassed solution.

         <title>Simple Synthetic Routes to Carbene&#8208;M&#8208;Amido (M = Cu, Ag, Au) Complexes for Luminescence and Photocatalysis Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of novel and operationally simple synthetic routes to Carbene&#8208;Metal&#8208;Amido (CMA) complexes of copper, silver and gold relevant for photonic applications are reported. A mild base and sustainable solvents allow all operations to be conducted in air and at room temperature, leading to high yields of the targeted compounds even on multigram scales. The effect of various mild bases on the N&#8208;H metallation was studied in silico and experimentally, while a mechanochemical, solvent&#8208;free synthetic approach was also developed. Our photophysical studies on [M(NHC)(Cbz)] indicate that the occurrence of fluorescent or phosphorescent states is determined primarily by the metal, providing control over the excited state properties. Consequently, we demonstrate the potential of the new CMAs beyond luminescence applications by employing a selected CMA as a photocatalyst. The exemplified synthetic ease is expected to accelerate the applications of CMAs in photocatalysis and materials chemistry.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We study the ultrafast photo&#8208;induced ring&#8208;opening process of the oxirane derivative trans&#8208;stilbene oxide through the use of ultrafast UV/UV pump&#8208;probe spectroscopy utilizing photoion detection. We identify the single&#8208; and multiphoton probe paths and final states through comparisons between UV power studies and synchrotron&#8208;based vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) single&#8208;photon ionization studies.&#160; We observe three major time&#8208;dependent features of the parent ion (sub&#8208;450 fs decay, (1.5 &#177; 0.2) ps, and &gt; 100 ps). We discuss these decays in conjunction to the primary ring&#8208;opening mechanism of stilbene oxide that occurs  via  C&#8211;C dissociation in the oxirane ring. We also investigate the appearance of fragments relating to the masses of dehydrogenated diphenylmethane (167 amu) and dehydrogenated methylbenzene (90 amu). The appearance of the 167 amu fragment may suggest an alternative ultrafast ring&#8208;opening pathway  via  the dissociation of one of the C&#8211;O bonds within the oxirane ring</dc:description>

         <dc:description>
Bis(4&#8208;benzhydryl&#8208;benzoxazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)methane (4&#8722;BzhH2BoxCH2) provides a versatile platform for monomeric ligands in [M(4&#8208;BzhH2BoxCH)] (M=Na, K) and dimeric [{M(4&#8208;BzhH2BoxCH)}2] (M=K, Rb, Cs) alkali metal complexes. Even more remarkable the reaction of 4&#8722;BzhH2BoxCH2 with three equivalents KH and two equivalents 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 yields polymeric [{(THF)2K@(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)}{K@(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)K(4&#8208;BzhH2BoxCH)}]n (n&#8594;&#8734;), containing a trianionic ligand. While the monoanions only provide N,N&#8208;chelation like NacNac the latter trianion potentially provides C,N,N,C&#8208;chelation and should be another promising ligand platform.







Abstract
A novel sterically demanding bis(4&#8208;benzhydryl&#8208;benzoxazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)methane ligand 6 (4&#8722;BzhH2BoxCH2) was gained in a straightforward six&#8208;step synthesis. Starting from this ligand monomeric [M(4&#8208;BzhH2BoxCH)] (M=Na (7), K (81)) and dimeric [{M(4&#8208;BzhH2BoxCH)}2] (M=K (82), Rb (9), Cs (10)) alkali metal complexes were synthesised by deprotonation. Abstraction of the potassium ion of 8 by reaction with 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 resulted in the solvent separated ion pair [{(THF)2K@(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)}{bis(4&#8208;benzhydryl&#8208;benzoxazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)methanide}] (11), including the energetically favoured monoanionic (E,E)&#8208;(4&#8208;BzhH2BoxCH) ligand. Further reaction of 4&#8722;BzhH2BoxCH2 with three equivalents KH and two equivalents 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 yielded polymeric [{(THF)2K@(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)}{K@(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)K(4&#8208;BzhBoxCH)}]n (n&#8594;&#8734;) (12) containing a trianionic ligand. The neutral ligand and herein reported alkali complexes were characterised by single X&#8208;ray analyses identifying the latter as a promising precursor for low&#8208;valent main group complexes.

         <title>Mixed Dimensional Nanostructure (UiO66 decorated MWCNT) as Nanofiller in MMMs for Enhanced CO2/CH4 Separation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) with combination of two distinct dimensional nanofillers (such as 1D&#8208;3D, 2D&#8208;3D, or 3D&#8208;3D, etc.) have drawn special attention for gas separation applications due to their concerted effects on gas permeation and mechanical properties. Amine functionalized 1D multiwalled carbon nanotube (NH  2  &#8208;MWCNT) holding exceptional mechanical strength and rapid gas transport was cross&#8208;linked with amine functionalized 3D MOF (UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH  2  ) with high CO  2  affinity through Schiff base&#160;reaction. The resultant cross&#8208;linked mixed dimensional nanostructure was used as nanofiller into polysulfone (PSf) polymer matrix to explore the underlying synergy between 1D and 3D nanostructures on gas separation performances of MMMs. Cross&#8208;sectional scanning electron microscopy and mapping micrographs revealed the homogenous dispersion of UiO66@MWCNT into the polymer matrix. The MMM containing 5.0 wt.% UiO&#8208;66@MWCNT demonstrated a superior permeability 8.3 Barrer as compared to 4.2 Barrer of pristine PSf membrane for pure CO  2  . Moreover, the selectivity (CO  2  /CH  4  ) of the same MMM was enhanced to 39.5 from 28.0 observed for pristine PSf&#160;under similar conditions of pressure and temperature.</dc:description>

         <title>Phosphorus&#8208;containing Superbases: Recent Progress in the Chemistry of Electron&#8208;abundant Phosphines and Phosphazenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The renaissance of Br&#248;nsted superbases is primarily based on their pronounced capability for a large variety of chemical transformations under mild reaction conditions. Four major set screws are available for the selective tuning of the basicity: the nature of the basic center (N, P, &#8230;), the degree of electron donation by substituents to the central atom, the possibility of charge delocalization, and the energy gain by hydrogen bonding. Within the past decades, a plethora of neutral electron&#8208;rich phosphine and phosphazene bases appeared in the literature. Their outstanding properties and advantages over inorganic or charged bases have made them now indispensable as auxiliary bases in deprotonation processes. Also, their utilization in catalysis or as ligands in coordination chemistry is highlighted due to broad&#8208;spread interest. Here we give an update of the chemistry of basic phosphines and phosphazenes.</dc:description>

         <title>Stabilization of Bicontinuous Cubic Phase and its Two&#8208;sided Nature Produced by Use of Siloxane Tails and Introduction of Molecular Nonsymmetry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A recent intriguing finding that a helical network arrangement forms the bicontinuous cubic phase is attracting great attention for its possibility for new routes to asymmetric synthesis by achiral molecules. However, the design of the molecular structure for the cubic phase is still unrevealed. Herein, we show that a nonsymmetric core molecule with larger naphthalene and smaller benzene moieties at each side of the central linkage and the same disiloxanyldecyloxy terminal at both terminals is the first example for forming both single&#8208;layered and double&#8208;layered core assembly modes in the  Ia  3  d  phase as a single molecule system. The molecule forms the former mode at high temperatures as a thermodynamically stable phase, similarly to the symmetric naphthalene core system, whereas, on cooling below a temperature (&#8764;350 K), a metastable  Ia  3  d  phase forms a double&#8208;layered core state down to room temperature, which is common to the benzene core system. As another effect of the nonsymmetric core, the cubic phase is maintained at room temperature for more than 100 days with slight distortion. Infrared spectral studies and quantum chemical calculations suggested the easy transformation between the two core assembly modes. The core nonsymmetry can be a versatile fine&#8208;tuning of the core assembly mode and phase stability for the cubic phase molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Total Synthesis and Bioactivity Mapping of Geodiamolide H</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first total synthesis of the actin&#8208;stabilizing marine natural product geodiamolide H was achieved. Solid&#8208;phase based peptide assembly paired with scalable stereoselective syntheses of polyketide building blocks and an optimized esterification set the stage for investigating the key ring&#8208;closing metathesis. Geodiamolide H and synthetic analogs were characterized for their toxicity and for antiproliferative effects in cellulo, by characterising actin polymerization induction in vitro, and by docking on the F&#8208;actin target and property computation in silico, for a better understanding of structure&#8208;activity relationships (SAR). A non&#8208;natural analog of geodiamolide H was discovered to be most potent in the series, suggesting significant potential for tool compound design.</dc:description>

         <title>Tetrasubstituted Peropyrenes Formed by Reductive Aromatization: Synthesis, Functionalization and Characterization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The chromophore class of 1,3,8,10&#8208;tetrasubstituted peropyrenes was effectively synthesized from peropyrenequinone via a Zn&#8208;mediated reductive aromatization approach. In one step, a symmetric functionalization of the peropyrene backbone introducing silylethers (  2  ,  3  ), pivaloyl (  4  ), triflyl (  5  ) and also phosphinite (  6  ) groups was established. Furthermore, the potential of using  4  and  5  in transition metal catalyzed cross couplings was explored leading to 1,3,8,10&#8208;tetraaryl (  8  &#8208;  11  ) and tetraalkynyl (  7  ) peropyrenes. The influence of various substituents on the optoelectronic properties of these &#960;&#8208;system extended peropyrenes was investigated in solid state by means of X&#8208;ray crystallography, in solution by means of UV&#8208;Vis and fluorescence spectroscopy and by their redox properties studied via cyclic voltammetry. By comparison with DFT and TD&#8208;DFT calculations, it could be elucidated that introduction of a broad variety of substituents in such versatile one or two step procedures leads to peropyrenes with easily tunable HOMO and LUMO energies ranging in a gap window of 0.8 eV. The frontier molecular orbital energies identify the target molecules as promising candidates for hole transporting semiconductors.</dc:description>

         <title>Soluble Congeners of Prior Insoluble Shape&#8208;Persistent Imine Cages</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chains make the difference! By attaching three n&#8208;hexyloxy chains to a triptycene triamine precursor, various soluble [4+4] and [4+6] imine cages were synthesized that were prior insoluble, revealing detailed insights in cage formation and exchange mechanisms by NMR spectroscopy in combination with gel permeation chromatography. The cubic [4+4] cage once formed is extraordinarily stable against exchange, although it is a clear thermodynamically controlled product.







Abstract
One of the most applied reaction types to synthesize shape&#8208;persistent organic cage compounds is the imine condensation reaction and it is assumed that the formed cages are thermodynamically controlled products due to the reversibility of the imine condensation. However, most of the synthesized imine cages reported are formed as precipitate from the reaction mixture and therefore rather may be kinetically controlled products. There are even examples in literature, where resulting cages are not soluble at all in common organic solvents to characterize or study their formation by NMR spectroscopy in solution. Here, a triptycene triamine containing three solubilizing n&#8208;hexyloxy chains has been used to synthesize soluble congeners of prior insoluble cages. This allowed us to study the formation as well as the reversibility of cage formation in solution by investigating exchange of building blocks between the cages and deuterated derivatives thereof.

         <dc:description>Heptazine&#8208;based microporous polymeric network, HMP&#8208;TAPA was synthesized via direct coupling of trichloroheptazine and tris(4&#8208;aminophenyl)amine (TAPA). The high surface area of 424 m  2  /g was achieved which is the highest surface area among heptazine&#8208;based polymeric networks (HMPs). The tailored electron&#8208;donor and acceptor units in HMP&#8208;TAPA render the broad visible light absorption. HMP&#8208;TAPA was employed as metal&#8208;free photocatalyst for oxidative coupling of amines to imines under visible light irradiation with 98% selectivity. Furthermore, the surface basicity of HMP&#8208;TAPA was utilized to achieve metal&#8208;free heterogeneous base catalysis for Knoevenagel condensation under base&#8208;free conditions with &gt;99 % conversion. Furthermore, HMP&#8208;TAPA showed extreme robustness over a wide pH range (1&#8208;14). The versatility and flexibility in the current material design is beneficial for understanding the offered photo&#8208;activity and surface basicity to design dual active (photo) catalyst materials for specific applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Simple Amides and Amines for the Synergistic Recovery of Rhodium from Hydrochloric Acid by Solvent Extraction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synergistic combination of a simple primary amine (LA) and a simple primary amide (L1) is shown to extract rhodium from hydrochloric acid. A range of experimental and computational techniques are used to elucidate the structures of two different complexes in the organic phase; the ion&#8208;pair [HLA]3[RhCl6] and the amide complex [HLA]2[RhCl5(L1)]. In the latter complex, the amide is tautomerized to its enol form and coordinated through the nitrogen atom.







Abstract
The separation and isolation of many of the platinum group metals (PGMs) is currently achieved commercially using solvent extraction processes. The extraction of rhodium is problematic however, as a variety of complexes of the form [RhCln(H2O)6&#8208;n](n&#8722;3)&#8722; are found in hydrochloric acid, making it difficult to design a reagent that can extract all the rhodium. In this work, the synergistic combination of a primary amine (2&#8208;ethylhexylamine, LA) with a primary amide (3,5,5&#8208;trimethylhexanamide, L1) is shown to extract over 85&#8201;% of rhodium from 4&#8197;M hydrochloric acid. Two rhodium complexes are shown to reside in the organic phase, the ion&#8208;pair [HLA]3[RhCl6] and the amide complex [HLA]2[RhCl5(L1)]; in the latter complex, the amide is tautomerized to its enol form and coordinated to the rhodium centre through the nitrogen atom. This insight highlights the need for ligands that target specific metal complexes in the aqueous phase and provides an efficient synergistic solution for the solvent extraction of rhodium.

         <dc:description>
&#8220;The DFT calculation results revealed an attractive characteristic of indium atoms with fluorine atoms. These significant results show that indium salts act as a &#960;&#8208;Lewis activator of gem&#8208;difluoroalkene and smoothly abstract fluoride thanks to an affinity toward fluorine atoms. In indium chemistry, few results of C&#8722;F bond functionalization have been established. We achieved both indium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;F bond functionalization and the first synthesis of monofluorinated isocoumarin at the 3&#8208;position.&#8221; Read more about the story behind the cover in the Cover Profile and about the research itself on page&#8197;&#9642;&#9642;&#8197;ff.

         <title>Metal&#8208;free Deoxygenation of Chiral Nitroalkanes: an Easy Entry to &#945;&#8722;substituted Enantiomerically Enriched Nitriles.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A metal&#8208;free, mild and chemodivergent transformation involving nitroalkanes was developed. Under optimized reaction conditions, in the presence of trichlorosilane and a tertiary amine, aliphatic nitroalkanes have been selectively converted into amines or nitriles. Furthermore, when chiral &#946;&#8208;substituted nitro compounds were reacted, the stereochemical integrity of the stereocenter was maintained and &#945;&#8722;functionalized nitriles were obtained with no loss in enantiomeric excess. The methodology was successfully applied to the synthesis of chiral &#946;&#8208;cyano esters, &#945;&#8208;aryl alkylnitriles, and TBS&#8208;protected cyanohydrins, including direct precursors of four APIs (Ibuprofen, Tembamide, Aegeline and Denopamine).</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In recent years, applications of low&#8208;valent main group compounds in the field of catalysis is gaining momentum. NHC&#8208;stabilized phosphinidenes owing to the access of two lone pairs of electrons have been found as excellent Lewis bases, however, they are yet to be&#160; used as catalysts.&#160; Herein, we report an NHC stabilized phosphinidene 1,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2&#8208;(phenylphosphanylidene)&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1H&#8208;imidazole (  1  ) for&#160; the activation of CO  2  . A closer inspection on the CO  2  activation process by DFT calculations along with intrinsic bond orbital analysis unravel that phosphinidene associates with phenylsilane through a non&#8208;covalent &#960;&#8208;&#960; interaction between two phenyl rings which activates the Si&#8208;H facilitating its transfer to the CO  2  molecule. Detailed DFT studies along with spectroscopic experiments were combined to understand the mechanism of CO  2  activation and its catalytic reductive functionalization leading to the formylation of a range of chemically inert primary amides under mild reaction conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Formulation of Next&#8208;Generation Multicompartment Microcapsules by Reversible Electrostatic Attraction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Let&#8242;s assemble! Different active substances can be formulated within one carrier system. A novel melamine&#8208;formaldehyde/polyethyleneimine coating for microcapsules results in microcapsules with a positive surface charge. Based on electrostatic interactions with negative charged poly&#8208;l&#8208;lactide and poly(lactide&#8208;co&#8208;glycolide) nanocapsules, a pH&#8208;responsive hierarchical capsule@capsule system was formed. Controlled assembling (pH&#8197;7) and disassembling (pH&#8197;3) between nanocapsules and microcapsules was demonstrated.







Abstract
The combination of several active substances into one carrier is often limited due to solubility, stability and phase&#8208;separation issues. These issues have been addressed by an innovative capsule design, in which nanocapsules are assembled on the microcapsule surface by electrostatic forces to form a pH&#8208;responsive hierarchical capsule@capsule system. Here, melamine&#8208;formaldehyde (MF) microcapsules with a negative surface charge were synthesized and coated with a novel MF&#8208;polyethyleneimine (PEI) copolymer to achieve a positive charge of &#950;=+28&#8197;mV. This novel coating procedure allows the electrostatic assembly of negatively charged poly&#8208;l&#8208;lactide (PLLA, &#950;=&#8722;19&#8197;mV) and poly&#8208;(lactide&#8208;co&#8208;glycolide) (PLGA, &#950;=&#8722;56&#8197;mV) nanocapsules on the microcapsule surface. Assembly studies at pH&#8197;7 gave a partial surface coverage of PLLA nanocapsules and full surface coverage for PLGA nanocapsules. The pH&#8208;responsive adsorption and desorption of nanocapsules was shown at pH&#8197;7 and pH&#8197;3.

         <title>Copper(II) Pyridyl Aminophenolates: Hypoxia&#8208;Selective, Nucleus&#8208;Targeting Cytotoxins, and Magnetic Resonance Probes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorine&#8208;labelled CuII complexes have been developed as hypoxia&#8208;targeting chemotherapeutics and MRI agents. Tuning the electronic properties identified a nitro&#8208;substituted complex as having hypoxia&#8208;selective cytotoxicity driven by nuclear accumulation and DNA cleavage. 19F magnetic resonance experiments discriminate between CuII and reduced complexes, thus demonstrating a bifunctional role for CuII complexes as both hypoxia probes and chemotherapeutic agents.







Abstract
Targeting the low&#8208;oxygen (hypoxic) environments found in many tumours by using redox&#8208;active metal complexes is a strategy that can enhance efficacy and reduce the side effects of chemotherapies. We have developed a series of CuII complexes with tridentate pyridine aminophenolate&#8208;based ligands for preferential activation in the reduction window provided by hypoxic tissues. Furthermore, ligand functionalization with a pendant CF3 group provides a 19F spectroscopic handle for magnetic&#8208;resonance studies of redox processes at the metal centre and behaviour in cellular environments. The phenol group in the ligand backbone was substituted at the para position with H, Cl, and NO2 to modulate the reduction potential of the CuII centre, giving a range of values below the window expected for hypoxic tissues. The NO2&#8208;substituted complex, which has the highest reduction potential, showed enhanced cytotoxic selectivity towards HeLa cells grown under hypoxic conditions. Cell death occurs by apoptosis, as determined by analysis of the cell morphology. A combination of 19F NMR and ICP&#8208;OES indicates localization of the NO2 complex in HeLa cell nuclei and increased cellular accumulation under hypoxia. This correlates with DNA nuclease activity being the likely origin of cytotoxic activity, as demonstrated by cleavage of DNA plasmids in the presence of the CuII nitro complex and a reducing agent. Selective detection of the paramagnetic CuII complexes and their diamagnetic ligands by 19F MRI suggests hypoxia&#8208;targeting theranostic applications by redox activation.

         <title>Phenyl Silicates with Substituted Catecholate Ligands: Synthesis, Structural Studies and Reactivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pathway less travelled: A general study of phenyl silicates bearing substituted catecholate ligands has been achieved. The silicates have been fully characterized and their reactivity under photooxidative conditions has been explored. Substitution of the catecholate moiety, notably with a 4&#8208;cyanocatecholato ligand, allowed the phenyl radical to be generated and trapped. Computational studies provided a rationale for these findings.







Abstract
While the generation of aryl radicals by photoredox catalysis under reductive conditions is well documented, it has remained challenging under an oxidative pathway. Because of the easy photo&#8208;oxidation of alkyl bis&#8208;catecholato silicates, a general study of phenyl silicates bearing substituted catecholate ligands has been achieved. The newly synthesized phenyl silicates have been fully characterized, and their reactivity has been explored. It was found that, thanks to the substitution of the catecholate moiety, notably with the 4&#8208;cyanocatecholato ligand, the phenyl radical could be generated and trapped. Computational studies provided a rationale for these findings.

         <title>Photoluminescent Carbon Quantum Dots: Synthetic Approaches and Photophysical Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon quantum dots (CQDs) synthesized in four different solvents or mixed solvents with 1,3,6&#8208;trinitropyrene as the carbon precursor: blue&#8208;emitting (DMF/H2O), green&#8208;emitting (EtOH/CH3CO2H), yellow&#8208;emitting (EtOH), and red&#8208;emitting (DMF). Photograph shows the photoluminescent CQDs dispersed in toluene under UV light, and normalized emission spectra with bands at 460, 517, 581, and 620&#8197;nm, respectively.







Abstract
A number of synthetic methodologies and applications of carbon quantum dots (CQDs) have been reported since they were first discovered nearly two decades ago. Unlike metal&#8208;based or semiconductor&#8208;based (e.&#8201;g., metal chalcogenides) quantum dots (MSQDs), CQDs have the unique feature of being prepared through a variety of synthetic protocols, which are typically understood from considerations of reaction models and photoluminescence mechanisms. Consequently, this brief review article describes quantum dots, in general, and CQDs, in particular, from various viewpoints: (i) their definition, (ii) their photophysical properties, and (iii) the superiority of CQDs over MSQDs. Where possible, comparisons are made between CQDs and MSQDs. First, however, the review begins with a general brief description of quantum dots (QDs) as nanomaterials (sizes&#8804;10&#8197;nm), followed by a short description of MSQDs and CQDs. Described subsequently are the various top&#8208;down and bottom&#8208;up approaches to synthesize CQDs followed by their distinctive photophysical properties (emission spectra; quantum yields, &#934;s).

         <title>Hollow POM@MOF&#8208;derived Porous NiMo6@Co3O4 for Biothiol Colorimetric Detection</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
NiMo6@ZIF&#8208;67 derived hollow porous Co3O4 with tetrahedral sites (with four oxygen neighbours) and octahedral sites (with six oxygen neighbours) were prepared. Compared with pure porous and commercial Co3O4, NiMo6@Co3O4(n) exhibit the enhanced peroxidase&#8208;mimicking activity and stability, and the corresponding &#8216;on&#8208;off switch&#8217; colorimetric biosensing platform with the inspiring sensitivity and terrific selectivity for L&#8208;cysteine (L&#8208;Cys) detection has been developed to date.







Abstract
Developing highly active and sensitive peroxidase mimics for L&#8208;cysteine (L&#8208;Cys) colorimetric detection is very important for biotechnology and medical diagnosis. Herein, polyoxometalate&#8208;doped porous Co3O4 composite (NiMo6@Co3O4) was designed and prepared for the first time. Compared with pure and commercial Co3O4, NiMo6@Co3O4(n) composites exhibit the enhanced peroxidase&#8208;mimicking activities and stabilities due to the strong synergistic effect between porous Co3O4 and multi&#8208;electron NiMo6 clusters. Moreover, the peroxidase&#8208;mimicking activities of NiMo6@Co3O4(n) composites are heavily dependent on the doping mass of NiMo6, and the optimized NiMo6@Co3O4(2) exhibits the superlative peroxidase&#8208;mimicking activity. More importantly, a sensitive L&#8208;Cys colorimetric detection is developed with the sensitivity of 0.023&#8197;&#956;M&#8722;1 and the detection limit at least 0.018&#8197;&#956;M in the linear range of 1&#8211;20&#8197;&#956;M, which is by far the best enzyme&#8208;mimetic performances, to the best our knowledge.

         <title>From BN&#8208;Naphthalenes to Benzoborole Dianions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benzoborole dianions have been selectively prepared in one step by lithium reduction of easily available BN&#8208;naphthalene derivatives. With this ring&#8208;contraction strategy, several new types of amino and phenyl&#8208;substituted benzoborole dianions could be obtained in excellent yields. Treatment of these dianions with methyl iodide resulted in the formation of the corresponding borates, which were luminescent both in solution and in the solid state.







Abstract
The synthesis of benzoborole dianions by alkali metal reduction of BN&#8208;naphthalene derivatives via a ring&#8208;contraction strategy has been developed. Reduction of 1&#8208;alkynyl 2,1&#8208;benzazaborine 1&#8201;a in Et2O led to the elimination of alkynyllithium with the formation of 1&#8208;amino&#8208;1&#8208;benzoborole trilithium salt 2&#8201;a, whereas reduction of 1&#8208;phenyl 2,1&#8208;benzazaborine 1&#8201;c in THF yielded 1&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1&#8208;benzoborole dilithium salt 2&#8201;c with the elimination of ArNHLi. The trilithium and dilithium salts 2&#8201;a and 2&#8201;c have been fully characterized. Treatment of trilithium salt 2&#8201;a with Et3NHCl led to the selective protonation of the amino lithium to afford the dilithium salt 2&#8201;aH, which could be cleanly oxidized to 1&#8208;amino&#8208;1&#8208;benzoborole 3 in an excellent yield. Reaction of 1&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1&#8208;benzoborole dilithium salt 2&#8201;c with MeI yielded the lithium borate 4&#8201;c, which is luminescent both in solution and in the solid state.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Benzoborole dianions&lt;/b&gt; have been selectively prepared in one step by lithium reduction of easily available BN-naphthalene derivatives. With this ring-contraction strategy, several new types of amino and phenyl-substituted benzoborole dianions could be obtained in excellent yields. Treatment of these dianions with methyl iodide resulted in the formation of the corresponding borates, which were luminescent both in solution and in the solid state.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The synthesis of benzoborole dianions by alkali metal reduction of BN-naphthalene derivatives via a ring-contraction strategy has been developed. Reduction of 1-alkynyl 2,1-benzazaborine &lt;b&gt;1&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt; in Et&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O led to the elimination of alkynyllithium with the formation of 1-amino-1-benzoborole trilithium salt &lt;b&gt;2&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt;, whereas reduction of 1-phenyl 2,1-benzazaborine &lt;b&gt;1&#8201;c&lt;/b&gt; in THF yielded 1-phenyl-1-benzoborole dilithium salt &lt;b&gt;2&#8201;c&lt;/b&gt; with the elimination of ArNHLi. The trilithium and dilithium salts &lt;b&gt;2&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;2&#8201;c&lt;/b&gt; have been fully characterized. Treatment of trilithium salt &lt;b&gt;2&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt; with Et&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;NHCl led to the selective protonation of the amino lithium to afford the dilithium salt &lt;b&gt;2&#8201;aH&lt;/b&gt;, which could be cleanly oxidized to 1-amino-1-benzoborole &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; in an excellent yield. Reaction of 1-phenyl-1-benzoborole dilithium salt &lt;b&gt;2&#8201;c&lt;/b&gt; with MeI yielded the lithium borate &lt;b&gt;4&#8201;c&lt;/b&gt;, which is luminescent both in solution and in the solid state.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Unraveling the Guest&#8208;Induced Switchability in the Metal&#8208;Organic Framework DUT&#8208;13(Zn)**

Breathe! Combining synchrotron in&#8197;situ PXRD with gas adsorption has shed light on the mechanism of guest&#8208;induced breathing in dynamic DUT&#8208;13 framework. In the contracted&#8208;pore phase, the crystal has pores half the volume of those in the open&#8208;pore phase; this is consistent with the adsorption isotherms. Methane physisorption isotherms at different temperatures indicate the softness of the framework.







Abstract
The switching mechanism of the flexible framework Zn4O(benztb)1.5 (benztb=N,N,N&#8217;,N&#8217;&#8208;benzidine tetrabenzoate), also known as DUT&#8208;13, was studied by advanced powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (PXRD) and gas physisorption techniques. In&#8197;situ synchrotron PXRD experiments upon physisorption of nitrogen (77&#8197;K) and n&#8208;butane (273&#8197;K) shed light on the hitherto unnoticed guest&#8208;induced breathing in the MOF. The mechanism of contraction is based on the conformationally labile benztb ligand and accompanied by a reduction in specific pore volume from 2.03&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1 in the open&#8208;pore phase to 0.91&#8197;cm3&#8201;g&#8722;1 in the contracted&#8208;pore phase. The high temperature limit for adsorption&#8208;induced contraction of 170&#8197;K, determined by systematic temperature variation of methane adsorption isotherms, indicates that the DUT&#8208;13 framework is softer than other mesoporous MOFs like DUT&#8208;49 and does not support the formation of overloaded metastable states required for negative gas&#8208;adsorption transitions.

         <title>Rapidly Adaptive All&#8208;covalent Nanoparticle Surface Engineering</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Acetal&#8208;terminated surface ligands stabilize idealized colloidal nanoparticle building blocks. On&#8208;demand activation of the masked aldehyde functionality occurs rapidly under mild conditions with precise stoichiometric control, revealing a versatile platform for all&#8208;covalent post&#8208;synthesis surface engineering. On&#8208;surface dynamic covalent transformations lead to diverse structural and functional modifications including rapidly adaptive environment&#8208;responsive nanomaterials.







Abstract
Emerging nanotechnologies demand the manipulation of nanoscale components with the same predictability and programmability as is taken for granted in molecular synthetic methodologies. Yet installing appropriately reactive chemical functionality on nanomaterial surfaces has previously entailed compromises in terms of reactivity scope, functionalization density, or both. Here, we introduce an idealized dynamic covalent nanoparticle building block for divergent and adaptive post&#8208;synthesis modification of colloidal nanomaterials. Acetal&#8208;protected monolayer&#8208;stabilized gold nanoparticles are prepared via operationally simple protocols and are stable to long&#8208;term storage. Tunable surface densities of reactive aldehyde functionalities are revealed on&#8208;demand, leading to a wide range of adaptive surface engineering options from one nanoscale synthon. Analytically tractable with molecular precision, interfacial reaction kinetics and dynamic surface constitutions can be probed in&#8197;situ at the ensemble level. High functionalization densities combined with rapid equilibration kinetics enable environmentally adaptive surface constitutions and rapid nanoparticle property switching in response to simple chemical effectors.

Spiraling under control: Configurationally stable [7]&#8208;helical dispirodihydro[2,1&#8208;c]indenofluorenes (DSF&#8208;IFs) have been synthesized with er values up to 99&#8201;:&#8201;1 by using intramolecular [2+2+2] cycloaddition of tethered triynediols catalyzed by RhI/SEGPHOS&#174;. The chiral DSF&#8208;IFs had circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) activity and exceptionally high fluorescence.







Abstract
The enantioselective synthesis of chiral [7]&#8208;helical dispirodihydro[2,1&#8208;c]indenofluorenes (DSF&#8208;IFs) was achieved for the first time in good yields with high er values (er up to 99&#8201;:&#8201;1). The crucial step of the whole reaction sequence was the enantioselective intramolecular [2+2+2] cycloaddition of tethered triynediols to indenofluorenediols, which was catalyzed by a Rh/SEGPHOS&#174; complex. Further transformations led to the corresponding DSF&#8208;IFs. The prepared helically chiral DSF&#8208;IFs combine circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) activity (glum=&#8764;10&#8722;3) with exceptionally high fluorescence quantum yields (up to &#934;lum=0.97).

         <title>Carbo&#8208;mer of Barrelene: A Rigid 3D&#8208;Carbon&#8208;Expanded Molecular Barrel</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
After 1D (Z)&#8208;dimethylidynebutene, 2D benzene and 2D xylylene, carbo&#8208;meric expansion of 3D barrelene is envisaged. First examples of carbo&#8208;barrelenes have thus been obtained in 2&#8211;3 steps from classical substrates used for the synthesis of carbo&#8208;benzenes and carbo&#8208;xylylenes. Beyond experimental characterization by NMR/UV/Vis spectroscopy, voltammetry and crystallography, DFT&#8208;based theoretical analyses of carbo&#8208;barrelenes allow interpretation of their observed structural and electronic features and anticipation of their possible host capability toward ionic guests such as NH4+ or metallic ions.







Abstract
After extensive studies of 1D and 2D skeletal carbo&#8208;mers based on C8 &#960;&#8208;conjugating dialkynylbutatriene units (DABs: &#8764;C&#8801;C&#8722;(R)C=C=C=C(R)&#8722;C&#8801;C&#8764;) bridging sp or sp2 centers in carbo&#8208;butene, carbo&#8208;xylylene or carbo&#8208;benzene derivatives, 3D versions are envisaged through carbo&#8208;barrelenes and partially reduced derivatives thereof where two or three DAB blades span a bridge between sp3 carbinol vertices or ether thereof. For R=Ph, stable representatives were synthesized through a pivotal [6]pericyclynedione, and extensively characterized by spectroscopic, electrochemical and crystallographic methods. Density functional theory calculations allow detailed analysis of structural and electronic features of the 7&#8197;&#197; high C26 barrel&#8208;shaped molecules, and show that they can behave as cages for ionic species. Beyond aesthetical concerns, the results could open prospects of applications in host&#8208;guest supramolecular chemistry and single molecule charge transport.

For R=Ph, stable representatives were synthesized through a pivotal [6]pericyclynedione, and extensively characterized by spectroscopic, electrochemical and crystallographic methods. Density functional theory calculations allow detailed analysis of structural and electronic features of the 7&#8197;&#197; high C&lt;sub&gt;26&lt;/sub&gt; barrel-shaped molecules, and show that they can behave as cages for ionic species. Beyond aesthetical concerns, the results could open prospects of applications in host-guest supramolecular chemistry and single molecule charge transport.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Acetylenic Replacement of Albicidin's Methacrylamide Residue Circumvents Detrimental E/Z Photoisomerization and Preserves Antibacterial Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lead optimization: The cinnamoyl residue of the antibiotic albicidin is shown to readily undergo UV&#8208;mediated E/Z isomerization, thereby converting from the highly bioactive E form found in the natural product to the significantly less bioactive Z form. Acetylenic replacement of the susceptible methylacrylamide moiety affords a set of photochemically stable albicidin derivatives with virtually undiminished antibacterial activity.







Abstract
The natural product albicidin is a highly potent inhibitor of bacterial DNA gyrase. Its outstanding activity, particularly against Gram&#8208;negative pathogens, qualifies it as a promising lead structure in the search for new antibacterial drugs. However, as we show here, the N&#8208;terminal cinnamoyl moiety of albicidin is susceptible to photochemical E/Z isomerization. Moreover, the newly formed Z isomer exhibits significantly reduced antibacterial activity, which hampers the development and biological evaluation of albicidin and potent derivatives thereof. Hence, we synthesized 13 different variants of albicidin in which the vulnerable para&#8208;coumaric acid moiety was replaced; this yielded photostable analogues. Biological activity assays revealed that diaryl alkyne analogues exhibited virtually undiminished antibacterial efficacy. This promising scaffold will therefore serve as a blueprint for the design of a potent albicidin&#8208;based drug.

         <title>Nematic Triphenyltriazine Triesters and the Induction of the Columnar Mesophase by Fluorine Substitution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorine induces columnar instead of nematic self&#8208;assembly in easy&#8208;to&#8208;synthesize triphenyltriazine triesters, which have high triplet energies and no own fluorescence. Such matrices could lead to enhanced light outcoupling from blue delayed&#8208;fluorescent devices by emitter alignment.







Abstract
Whereas their para homologs are not mesogenic, the disk&#8208;shaped triphenyltriazine meta&#8208;trialkylesters obtained via trimerization of 3&#8208;cyanobenzoic alkylester, which are configurationally more flexible, exhibit a monotropic nematic mesophase. Introduction of fluorine atoms into the alkyl chains or into the phenyl moieties leads to the appearance of an enantiotropic columnar mesophase. If fluorine is introduced both in the chains and in the phenyl moieties, only a monotropic mesophase remains. Fluorination of either the alkyl chains or the aromatic core, but not both, appears thus as a simple means of inducing or stabilizing columnar self&#8208;assembly in disk&#8208;shaped systems. As the homeotropically alignable columnar mesophase can thus be made to persist at room temperature, as energies higher than 3&#8197;eV of the first excited triplet state are computed in agreement with the value reported for the parent arene, and as they are not fluorescent themselves, these compounds are of promise as aligning host matrices for blue&#8208;emitting TADF devices with improved light outcoupling. Dilution of a columnar with a nonmesogenic homolog induces the nematic state, indicating that the nanoscopic make&#8208;up of both mesophases is closely related.

         <title>Saccharified Uranyl Ions: Self&#8208;Assembly of UO22+ into Trinuclear Anionic Complexes by the Coordination of Glucosamine&#8208;Derived Schiff Bases</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Investigation of the coordination behavior of salicylidene glucosamine (H2L1) towards uranyl ions (UO22+) revealed the exclusive formation of a trinuclear anionic uranyl complex [(UO2)3(&#956;3&#8208;O)(L1)3]2&#8722; (12&#8722;), which was isolated by precipitation with the alkali metals ions Cs+, Rb+, and K+. Recrystallization of the Cs salt in the presence of 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 in DMF led to the formation of the solvated ion pair [Cs(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)]21, in which coordination of the Cs+ ion by three uranyl oxygen atoms was observe.







Abstract
The reaction of UO2(OAc)2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H2O with the biologically inspired ligand 2&#8208;salicylidene glucosamine (H2L1) results in the formation of the anionic trinuclear uranyl complex [(UO2)3(&#956;3&#8208;O)(L1)3]2&#8722; (12&#8722;), which was isolated in good yield as its Cs&#8208;salt, [Cs]21. Recrystallization of [Cs]21 in the presence of 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 led to formation of a neutral ion pair of type [M(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)]21, which was also obtained for the alkali metal ions Rb+ and K+ (M=Cs, Rb, K). The related ligand, 2&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;1&#8208;naphthylidene) glucosamine (H2L2) in a similar procedure with Cs+ gave the corresponding complex [Cs(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)]2[(UO2)3(&#956;3&#8208;O)(L2)3 ([Cs(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)]22). From X&#8208;ray investigations, the [(UO2)3O(Ln)3]2&#8722; anion (n=1, 2) in each complex is a discrete trinuclear uranyl species that coordinates to the alkali metal ion via three uranyl oxygen atoms. The coordination behavior of H2L1 and H2L2 towards UO22+ was investigated by NMR, UV/Vis spectroscopy and mass spectrometry, revealing the in&#8197;situ formation of the 12&#8722; and 22&#8722;dianions in solution.

         <title>Na2FePO4F/Biocarbon Nanocomposite Hollow Microspheres Derived from Biological Cell Template as High&#8208;Performance Cathode Material for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Na2FePO4F/biocarbon nanocomposite hollow microspheres were synthesized through self&#8208;assembly of yeast cell biotemplates. The electrode delivered high initial capacity (114.3&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;C), long&#8208;cycle stability (74.3&#8201;% retention after 500 cycles at 5&#8197;C), and high rate capability (70.2&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 5&#8197;C).







Abstract
We have successfully synthesized Na2FePO4F/biocarbon nanocomposite hollow microspheres from FeIII precursor as cathodes for sodium&#8208;ion batteries through self&#8208;assembly of yeast cell biotemplate and sol&#8208;gel technology. The carbon coating on the nanoparticle surface with a mesoporous structure enhances electron diffusion into Na2FePO4F crystal particles. The improved electrochemical performance of Na2FePO4F/biocarbon nanocomposites is attributed to the larger electrode&#8722;electrolyte contact area and more active sites for Na+ on the surface of hollow microspheres compared with those of Na2FePO4F/C. The Na2FePO4F/biocarbon nanocomposite exhibits a high initial discharge capacity of 114.3&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#8197;C, long&#8208;cycle stability with a capacity retention of 74.3&#8201;% after 500 cycles at 5&#8197;C, and excellent rate capability (70.2&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 5&#8197;C) compared with Na2FePO4F/C.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;FePO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;F/biocarbon&lt;/b&gt; nanocomposite hollow microspheres were synthesized through self-assembly of yeast cell biotemplates. The electrode delivered high initial capacity (114.3&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.1&#8197;C), long-cycle stability (74.3&#8201;% retention after 500 cycles at 5&#8197;C), and high rate capability (70.2&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 5&#8197;C).

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have successfully synthesized Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;FePO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;F/biocarbon nanocomposite hollow microspheres from Fe&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; precursor as cathodes for sodium-ion batteries through self-assembly of yeast cell biotemplate and sol-gel technology. The carbon coating on the nanoparticle surface with a mesoporous structure enhances electron diffusion into Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;FePO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;F crystal particles. The improved electrochemical performance of Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;FePO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;F/biocarbon nanocomposites is attributed to the larger electrode&#8722;electrolyte contact area and more active sites for Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; on the surface of hollow microspheres compared with those of Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;FePO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;F/C. The Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;FePO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;F/biocarbon nanocomposite exhibits a high initial discharge capacity of 114.3&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.1&#8197;C, long-cycle stability with a capacity retention of 74.3&#8201;% after 500 cycles at 5&#8197;C, and excellent rate capability (70.2&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 5&#8197;C) compared with Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;FePO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;F/C. This novel nanocomposite hollow microsphere structure is suitable for improving the property of other cathode materials for high-power batteries.&lt;/p&gt;

&#963;&#8208;Silane adducts and alcohol adducts are kinetically detected intermediates in zinc&#8208;catalyzed &#963;&#8208;bond metathesis&#8208;type dehydrocoupling reactions. These intermediates feature prominently in the reactivity of coordinatively unsaturated zinc centers, which efficiently mediate Si&#8722;O bond formation. The catalyst is responsive to reaction conditions, adapting as a function of concentration to follow the kinetically preferred mechanism.







Abstract
Three&#8208;coordinate PhBOX
ZnR (PhBOX
=phenyl&#8208;(4,4&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;oxazolinato; R=Me: 2&#8201;a, Et: 2&#8201;b) catalyzes the dehydrocoupling of primary or secondary silanes and alcohols to give silyl ethers and hydrogen, with high turnover numbers (TON; up to 107) under solvent&#8208;free conditions. Primary and secondary silanes react with small, medium, and large alcohols to give various degrees of substitution, from mono&#8208; to tri&#8208;alkoxylation, whereas tri&#8208;substituted silanes do not react with MeOH under these conditions. The effect of coordinative unsaturation on the behavior of the Zn catalyst is revealed through a dramatic variation of both rate law and experimental rate constants, which depend on the concentrations of both the alcohol and hydrosilane reactants. That is, the catalyst adapts its mechanism to access the most facile and efficient conversion. In particular, either alcohol or hydrosilane binds to the open coordination site on the PhBOX
ZnOR catalyst to form a PhBOX
ZnOR(HOR) complex under one set of conditions or an unprecedented &#963;&#8208;adduct PhBOX
ZnOR(H&#8722;SiR&#8242;3) under other conditions. Saturation kinetics provide evidence for the latter species, in support of the hypothesis that &#963;&#8208;bond metathesis reactions involving four&#8208;centered electrocyclic 2&#963;&#8211;2&#963; transition states are preceded by &#963;&#8208;adducts.

         <title>Bis(pertrifluoromethylcatecholato)silane: Extreme Lewis Acidity Broadens the Catalytic Portfolio of Silicon</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The extremely electron&#8208;deficient tetratrifluorocatechol is synthesized and installed at silicon, providing a Lewis superacid that ranks among the strongest fluoride ion acceptors accessible in the condensed phase. The compound enables silicon&#8208;catalyzed deoxygenation of ketones, aldehydes, amides and phosphine oxides and the first silicon catalyzed carbonyl&#8208;olefin metathesis.







Abstract
Given its earth abundance, silicon is ideal for constructing Lewis acids of use in catalysis or materials science. Neutral silanes were limited to moderate Lewis acidity, until halogenated catecholato ligands provoked a significant boost. However, catalytic applications of bis(perhalocatecholato)silanes were suffering from very poor solubility and unknown deactivation pathways. In this work, the novel per(trifluoromethyl)catechol, H2catCF3, and adducts of its silicon complex Si(catCF3)2 (1) are described. According to the computed fluoride ion affinity, 1 ranks among the strongest neutral Lewis acids currently accessible in the condensed phase. The improved robustness and affinity of 1 enable deoxygenations of aldehydes, ketones, amides, or phosphine oxides, and a carbonyl&#8208;olefin metathesis. All those transformations have never been catalyzed by a neutral silane. Attempts to obtain donor&#8208;free 1 attest to the extreme Lewis acidity by stabilizing adducts with even the weakest donors, such as benzophenone or hexaethyl disiloxane.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Low Pressure Carbonylation of Allylic Alcohols by Catalytic Anhydride Activation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A direct carbonylation of allylic alcohols is described for the first time with high catalyst activity at low pressure (10&#8197;bar). Key to high activities in the carbonylation is the finding that catalytic amounts of anhydride activate the substrate.







Abstract
A direct carbonylation of allylic alcohols has been realized for the first time with high catalyst activity at low pressure of CO (10&#8197;bar). The procedure is described in detail for the carbonylation of E&#8208;nerolidol, an important step in a new BASF&#8208;route to (&#8722;)&#8208;ambrox. Key to high activities in the allylic alcohol carbonylation is the finding that catalytic amounts of carboxylic anhydride activate the substrate and are constantly regenerated with carbon monoxide under the reaction conditions. The identified reaction conditions are transferrable to other substrates as well.

         <title>Nucleophilic Reactions of Osmanaphthalynes with PMe3 and H2O</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New classes of osmium complexes bearing different substituents have been synthesized in a one&#8208;pot method comprising ligand substitution and nucleophilic addition of osmanaphthalynes. Aided by DFT calculations, the possible mechanism of this experiment is discussed. Moreover, all the target complexes have been fully characterized by NMR spectroscopy, HRMS and elemental analysis.







Abstract
Members of a new class of complexes, 2(CF3), 2(H), 2(Br), 2(I), and 2(OCH3), have been synthesized in a one&#8208;pot method involving the treatment of osmanaphthalynes bearing corresponding substituents (1(CF3), 1(H), 1(Br), 1(I), and 1(OCH3)) with trimethylphosphine (PMe3) and water. The main reaction process involves two steps, namely a ligand&#8208;exchange with trimethylphosphine and nucleophilic addition of water to the Os&#8801;C bond of the osmanaphthalyne. The substituents have a significant influence on the rate of the reaction, as befits a nucleophilic addition. Fortunately, the key intermediate [1(OCH3)]&#8242; could be successfully captured, and the detailed reaction mechanism has been explored with the aid of density functional theory (DFT) calculations, which were in excellent agreement with the experimental findings. All of the target complexes have been fully characterized by 1H, 31P{1H}, and 13C{1H} NMR spectroscopy, high&#8208;resolution mass spectrometry, and elemental analysis.

         <title>Analysis of Non&#8208;innocence of Phosphaquinodimethane Ligands when Charge and Aromaticity Come into Play</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In order to analyze their non&#8208;innocence character when ligated in M(CO)5 complexes, various phosphaquinodimethanes (pPQDM) and their complexes have been theoretically investigated regarding their electronic and structural properties, following corresponding changes in substitution, charge and spin state. Additionally, a combination of computed spin distributions and NICS values with geometric distortion models (HOMA, HOMQc) were used to gain further insights.







Abstract
Several phosphaquinodimethanes and their M(CO)5 complexes (M=Cr, Mo, W) and model derivatives have been theoretically investigated regarding the quest of non&#8208;innocence. Computed structural and electronic properties of the P&#8208;Me/NH2 substituted phosphaquinodimethanes and tungsten complexes revealed an interesting non&#8208;innocent ligand behaviour for the radical anion complexes with distonic ion character and a strong rearomatization of the middle phenyl ring. The latter was further probed taking also geometric aromaticity (HOMA) and quinoid distortion parameters (HOMQc) into account, as well as NICS(1). Furthermore, the effect of the P&#8208;substitution was investigated for real (or plausible) complexes and their free ligands focusing on the resulting aromaticity at the middle phenyl ring and vertical one&#8208;electron redox processes. The best picture of ligand engagement in redox changes was provided by representing NICS(1) values versus HOMA and the new geometric distortion parameter HOMQc8.

         <title>Developing Bright Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP)&#8208;like Fluorogens for Live&#8208;Cell Imaging with Nonpolar Protein&#8722;Chromophore Interactions</title>

Redder fluorogen derived from jellyfish: Using a double&#8208;donor&#8208;one&#8208;acceptor strategy, we designed and synthesized a new yellow fluorogen from GFP chromophore (jellyfish Aequorea victoria) that shows the highest brightness upon binding a popular FAST protein tag, enabling live&#8208;cell imaging with specific staining. By effectively partitioning the environmental parameters via multivariable analysis of ultrafast spectroscopic data, the H&#8208;bonding and dipolar interactions are revealed to govern fluorogenicity.







Abstract
Fluorescence&#8208;activating proteins (FAPs) that bind a chromophore and activate its fluorescence have gained popularity in bioimaging. The fluorescence&#8208;activating and absorption&#8208;shifting tag (FAST) is a light&#8208;weight FAP that enables fast reversible fluorogen binding, thus advancing multiplex and super&#8208;resolution imaging. However, the rational design of FAST&#8208;specific fluorogens with large fluorescence enhancement (FE) remains challenging. Herein, a new fluorogen directly engineered from green fluorescent protein (GFP) chromophore by a unique double&#8208;donor&#8208;one&#8208;acceptor strategy, which exhibits an over 550&#8208;fold FE upon FAST binding and a high extinction coefficient of approximately 100,000&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1, is reported. Correlation analysis of the excited state nonradiative decay rates and environmental factors reveal that the large FE is caused by nonpolar protein&#8722;fluorogen interactions. Our deep insights into structure&#8208;function relationships could guide the rational design of bright fluorogens for live&#8208;cell imaging with extended spectral properties such as redder emissions.

Stable complex with {Cl2}. Oxochloroselenate with incorporated Cl2 units, TMA3{[Se2O2Cl7](Cl2)}, features very strong halogen bonding in solid state and high thermal stability. The nature of non&#8208;covalent interactions was investigated by theoretical and spectral methods.

The main feature of this compound is the strong (up to 3.5&#8197;kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1, according to DFT calculations) Cl&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;Cl bonding, which is also detected by Raman spectroscopy.

         <title>Synthetic Approaches for 15N&#8208;Labeled Hyperpolarized Heterocyclic Molecular Imaging Agents for 15N NMR Signal Amplification by Reversible Exchange in Microtesla Magnetic Fields</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Getting hyper: This minireview provides a selective overview of 15N&#8208;labeling approaches for the preparation of contrast agents hyperpolarized by using the SABRE&#8208;SHEATH technique. This technique employs parahydrogen as a fast and inexpensive means to produce hyperpolarized biocompatible contrast agents for molecular imaging applications.







Abstract
NMR hyperpolarization techniques enhance nuclear spin polarization by several orders of magnitude resulting in corresponding sensitivity gains. This enormous sensitivity gain enables new applications ranging from studies of small molecules by using high&#8208;resolution NMR spectroscopy to real&#8208;time metabolic imaging in&#8197;vivo. Several hyperpolarization techniques exist for hyperpolarization of a large repertoire of nuclear spins, although the 13C and 15N sites of biocompatible agents are the key targets due to their widespread use in biochemical pathways. Moreover, their long T1 allows hyperpolarized states to be retained for up to tens of minutes. Signal amplification by reversible exchange (SABRE) is a low&#8208;cost and ultrafast hyperpolarization technique that has been shown to be versatile for the hyperpolarization of 15N nuclei. Although large sensitivity gains are enabled by hyperpolarization, 15N natural abundance is only &#8764;0.4&#8201;%, so isotopic labeling of the molecules to be hyperpolarized is required in order to take full advantage of the hyperpolarized state. Herein, we describe selected advances in the preparation of 15N&#8208;labeled compounds with the primary emphasis on using these compounds for SABRE polarization in microtesla magnetic fields through spontaneous polarization transfer from parahydrogen. Also, these principles can certainly be applied for hyperpolarization of these emerging contrast agents using dynamic nuclear polarization and other techniques.

         <title>Coordination Properties of Hydroxyisophthalic Acids: Topological Correlations, Synthesis, Structural Analysis, and Properties of New Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Topological regularities in coordination networks allowed the design of new compounds of K+, Mg2+, Ca2+, Sr2+, Ba2+, NH4+ with 4,5,6&#8208;trihydroxyisophthalate dianion. The structures exhibit cluster structural groups, coordination of water, and the ligand through asymmetric coordination modes, aromatic stacking, and H&#8208;bonds competing with coordination bonds. The structural features favor second harmonic generation and possible proton transport.







Abstract
Hydroxyisophthalic acids are valuable polytopic ligands for the design of functional materials based on coordination polymers due to the variety of charges and coordination modes they possess. Herein, we describe the synthesis, thermal stability, nonlinear optical (NLO) and spectroscopic properties of five novel coordination compounds, [K2L(H2O)2], [MgL(H2O)2]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;3H2O, [CaL(H2O)3], [SrL(H2O)3]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O, [BaL(H2O)(H2O)5], and one salt, (NH4)2L&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H2O, with 4,5,6&#8208;trihydroxyisophthalic acid (H2L), which has not been tested in assembling crystalline coordination networks before. The peculiarities of the structural organization of the compounds were analyzed and compared with those for other hydroxyisophthalates. The coordination properties of hydroxyisophthalic acids were studied from the topological point of view, and a comparative topological analysis of coordination and H&#8208;bonded networks was performed. Structural correlations revealed in this study could be useful for the design of hydroxyisophthalate&#8208;based coordination networks, including porous metal&#8208;organic frameworks, proton conductors, and NLO materials.

Herein, we describe the synthesis, thermal stability, nonlinear optical (NLO) and spectroscopic properties of five novel coordination compounds, [K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;L(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;], [MgL(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;3H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, [CaL(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;], [SrL(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, [BaL(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;], and one salt, (NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;L&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, with 4,5,6-trihydroxyisophthalic acid (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;L), which has not been tested in assembling crystalline coordination networks before. The peculiarities of the structural organization of the compounds were analyzed and compared with those for other hydroxyisophthalates. The coordination properties of hydroxyisophthalic acids were studied from the topological point of view, and a comparative topological analysis of coordination and H-bonded networks was performed. Structural correlations revealed in this study could be useful for the design of hydroxyisophthalate-based coordination networks, including porous metal-organic frameworks, proton conductors, and NLO materials.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Dual Control of Peptide Conformation with Light and Metal Coordination</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A coiled coil peptide programmed with 8&#8208;hydroxyquinoline (HQ) and imidazole groups exhibits a conformational shift to a &#946;&#8208;sheet structure upon coordination of Zn2+, whereas the introduction of other metal ions (Cu2+, Fe3+, Co2+, Mg2+, and Ni2+) does not lead to a conformational change.







Abstract
The design of a stimuli&#8208;responsive peptide whose conformation is controlled by wavelength&#8208;specific light and metal coordination is described. The peptide adopts a defined tertiary structure and its conformation can be modulated between an &#945;&#8208;helical coiled coil and &#946;&#8208;sheet. The peptide is designed with a hydrophobic interface to induce coiled coil formation and is based on a recently described strategy to obtain switchable helix dimers. Herein, we endowed the helix dimer with 8&#8208;hydroxyquinoline (HQ) groups to achieve metal coordination and shift to a &#946;&#8208;sheet structure. It was found that the conformational shift only occurs upon introduction of Zn2+; other metal ions (Cu2+, Fe3+, Co2+, Mg2, and Ni2+) do not offer switching likely due to non&#8208;specific metal&#8208;peptide coordination. A control peptide lacking the metal&#8208;coordinating residues does not show conformational switching with Zn2+ supporting the role of this metal in stabilizing the &#946;&#8208;sheet conformation in a defined manner.

         <title>Temperature&#8208;Triggered Structural Dynamics of Non&#8208;Coordinating Guest Moieties in a Fluorescent Actinide Polyrotaxane Framework</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new fluorescent uranyl&#8208;coordination polyrotaxane only connected by macrocyclic host has been constructed. The non&#8208;coordinating guest (C7BPy) in the obtained polyrotaxane shows thermal displacement and dynamic conformational variations with temperature increasing from 150 to 300&#8197;K. Meanwhile, this polyrotaxene can selectively detect Fe3+ over other eight competing cations in aqueous solution, with the limit of Fe3+ detection as low as 4.4&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;ppm.







Abstract
We present here the synthesis of a novel fluorescent actinide polyrotaxane compound URCP1 through the utilization of an end&#8208;cutting pseudorotaxane precursor with only the cucurbit[6]uril (CB[6]) macrocyclic components acting as linking struts. The non&#8208;coordinating guest motif in the obtained polyrotaxane, with increased freedom and structural flexibility, can display intriguing temperature&#8208;triggered conformational variations inside the cavity of CB[6], which was clearly evidenced by crystallographic snapshots at different temperatures. Notably, this observation of temperature&#8208;triggered structural dynamics in URCP1 represents the first report of actinide polyrotaxane with such feature in solid&#8208;state. Moreover, URCP1 has a high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 49.8&#8201;%, comparable to other luminescent uranyl compounds, and can work as a fluorescent probe to selectively detect Fe3+ over other eight competing cations in aqueous solution, with the limit of detection being as low as 4.4&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;ppm.

         <title>Hydrogel&#8208;Stiffening and Non&#8208;Cell Adhesive Properties of Amphiphilic Peptides with Central Alkylene Chains</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive study on the amphiphilic peptides revealed unexpected effects of inserting an alkylene chain at the center on strengthening &#946;&#8208;sheet hydrogen bonds, providing stiffened hydrogels and diminishing cell adhesion property, which are clearly different from the effects of putting an alkyl tail at an end. This finding offers a novel molecular design to tune mechanical and biological functionalities of peptide materials.







Abstract
Amphiphilic peptides bearing terminal alkyl tails form supramolecular nanofibers that are increasingly used as biomaterials with multiple functionalities. Insertion of alkylene chains in peptides can be designed as another type of amphiphilic peptide, yet the influence of the internal alkylene chains on self&#8208;assembly and biological properties remains poorly defined. Unlike the terminal alkyl tails, the internal alkylene chains can affect not only the hydrophobicity but also the flexibility and packing of the peptides. Herein, we demonstrate the supramolecular and biological effects of the central alkylene chain length inserted in a peptide. Insertion of the alkylene chain at the center of the peptide allowed for strengthened &#946;&#8208;sheet hydrogen bonds and modulation of the packing order, and consequently the amphiphilic peptide bearing C2 alkylene chain formed a hydrogel with the highest stiffness. Interestingly, the amphiphilic peptides bearing internal alkylene chains longer than C2 showed a diminished cell&#8208;adhesive property. This study offers a novel molecular design to tune mechanical and biological properties of peptide materials.

The diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective synthesis of a configurationally stable S&#8208;shaped double azahelicene&#8208;like molecule showing good chiroptical responses has been achieved with the high ee value of 89&#8201;% by the rhodium(I)/xyl&#8208;segphos&#8208;complex&#8208;catalyzed double [2+2+2] cycloaddition of a dicyanotetrayne.







Abstract
The enantioselective synthesis of aza[6] and [7]helicene&#8208;like molecules have been achieved by the cationic rhodium(I)/axially chiral biaryl bisphosphine complex&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular [2+2+2] cycloaddition of cyanodiynes. This protocol was successfully applied to the diastereo&#8208; and enantioselective synthesis of an S&#8208;shaped double aza[6]helicene&#8208;like molecule with a high ee value of 89&#8201;%. Although no epimerization and racemization were observed in the double carbo[6]helicene&#8208;like molecule at 80&#8201;&#176;C, epimerization and racemization of the double aza[6]helicene&#8208;like molecule proceeded at 80&#8201;&#176;C. This double aza[6]helicene&#8208;like molecule showed good fluorescent quantum yields and chiroptical responses under both neutral and acidic conditions.

Unactivated alkenyl iodides and bromides underwent an unprecedented palladium&#8208;catalyzed relay&#8208;Heck cross&#8208;coupling with a whole range of alkenols of different chain lengths linking the alkene and the alcohol, affording unsaturated aldehydes and ketones in moderate to good yields. In contrast, alkenyl triflates were not suitable partners for this reaction. This method allowed the preparation of open&#8208;chain analogues of the musk odorant Vulcanolide, several of which retained key olfactory properties of the parent molecule.

         <title>Development of Non&#8208;Hydrolysable Oligosaccharide Activity&#8208;Based Inactivators for Endoglycanases: A Case Study on &#945;&#8208;1,6 Mannanases</title>

Carba&#8208;trisaccharide cyclophellitols are potent GH76 &#945;&#8208;1,6 endo&#8208;mannanase inactivators and resistant to endoglycosidic bond cleavage.







Abstract
There is a vast genomic resource for enzymes active on carbohydrates. Lagging far behind, however, are functional chemical tools for the rapid characterization of carbohydrate&#8208;active enzymes. Activity&#8208;based probes (ABPs) offer one chemical solution to these issues with ABPs based upon cyclophellitol epoxide and aziridine covalent and irreversible inhibitors representing a potent and widespread approach. Such inhibitors for enzymes active on polysaccharides are potentially limited by the requirement for several glycosidic bonds, themselves substrates for the enzyme targets. Here, it is shown that non&#8208;hydrolysable trisaccharide can be synthesized and applied even to enzymes with challenging subsite requirements. It was found that incorporation of carbasugar moieties, which was accomplished by cuprate&#8208;assisted regioselective trans&#8208;diaxial epoxide opening of carba&#8208;mannal synthesised for this purpose, yields inactivators that act as powerful activity&#8208;based inhibitors for &#945;&#8208;1,6 endo&#8208;mannanases. 3&#8208;D structures at 1.35&#8211;1.47&#8197;&#197; resolutions confirm the design rationale and binding to the enzymatic nucleophile. Carbasugar oligosaccharide cyclophellitols offer a powerful new approach for the design of robust endoglycosidase inhibitors, while the synthesis procedures presented here should allow adaptation towards activity&#8208;based endoglycosidase probes as well as configurational isosteres targeting other endoglycosidase families.

         <title>Selectivity in the Ligand Functionalization of Photocatalytic Metal Oxide Nanoparticles for Phase Transfer and Self&#8208;Assembly Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transferred to film: The selectivity in ligand functionalization of photocatalytic metal oxide nanoparticles namely has been demonstrated for thiol (dodecane&#8208;1&#8208;thiol) and amine (oleylamine) terminated ligands. The success of polar&#8208;to&#8208;nonpolar phase transfer of the nanoparticles is consistent with the ligand&#8208;nanoparticle selectivity. The hydrophobic functionalized nanoparticles can be self&#8208;assembled at the air&#8208;water interface for thin&#8208;film applications.







Abstract
The functionalization of photocatalytic metal oxide nanoparticles of TiO2, ZnO, WO3 and CuO with amine&#8208;terminated (oleylamine) and thiol&#8208;terminated (dodecane&#8208;1&#8208;thiol) alkyl&#8208;chain ligands was studied under ambient conditions. A high selectivity was observed in the binding specificity of a ligand towards nanoparticles of these different oxides. It was observed that oleylamine binds stably to only TiO2 and WO3, whereas dodecane&#8208;1&#8208;thiol binds stably only to ZnO and CuO. Similarly, polar&#8208;to&#8208;nonpolar solvent phase transfer of TiO2 and WO3 nanoparticles could be achieved by using oleylamine, but not dodecane&#8208;1&#8208;thiol, whereas the opposite holds for ZnO and CuO. The surface chemistry of ligand&#8208;functionalized nanoparticles was probed by attenuated total reflectance (ATR)&#8208;FTIR spectroscopy, which enabled the occupation of the ligands at the active sites to be elucidated. The photostability of the ligands on the nanoparticle surface was determined by the photocatalytic self&#8208;cleaning properties of the material. Although TiO2 and WO3 degrade the ligands within 24&#8197;h under both UV and visible light, ligands on ZnO and CuO remain unaffected. The gathered insights are also highly relevant from an application point of view. As an example, because the ligand&#8208;functionalized nanoparticles are hydrophobic in nature, they can be self&#8208;assembled at the air&#8208;water interface to give nanoparticle films with demonstrated photocatalytic as well as anti&#8208;fogging properties.

         <title>Tailored Mobility in a Zeolite Imidazolate Framework (ZIF) Antibody Conjugate**
</title>

         <dc:description>
Framing an assay: We present nanosized zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) conjugated to immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies by using a strong and flexible covalent amino&#8208;alkyl link. These nanoZIF&#8208;IgG particles display good mobility and an excellent behaviour in dispersion. Their application to antibody&#8208;based bioanalytical assays, including enzyme&#8208;linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA), was examined.







Abstract
Zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF) hybrid fluorescent nanoparticles and ZIF antibody conjugates have been synthesized, characterized, and employed in lateral&#8208;flow immunoassay (LFIA). The bright fluorescence of the conjugates and the possibility to tailor their mobility gives a huge potential for diagnostic assays. An enzyme&#8208;linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) as label, proved the integrity, stability, and dispersibility of the antibody conjugates, LC&#8208;MS/MS provided evidence that a covalent link was established between these metal&#8208;organic frameworks and lysine residues in IgG antibodies.

         <title>Shape&#8208;Adaptability and Redox&#8208;Switching Properties of a Di&#8208;Gold Metallotweezer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A di&#8208;gold metallo&#8208;tweezer is used as receptor of a series of electron&#8208;deficient planar organic guests, including three organic molecules and two square&#8208;planar metal complexes. The host adapts its shape to maximize the attractive interaction with the guests. Redox&#8208;active guests are released upon one electron reduction, thus this tweezer constitutes an interesting example of redox&#8208;switchable binding.







Abstract
The use of a carbazolyl&#8208;connected di&#8208;gold(I) metallotweezer for the encapsulation of several electron&#8208;poor organic substrates, and a planar Au(III) complex containing a CNC pincer ligand, is described. The binding affinity of the receptor depends on the electron&#8208;deficient character of the planar guest, with larger association constants found for the more electron&#8208;poor guests. The X&#8208;ray diffraction molecular structures of two host:guest adducts show that the host approaches its arms in order to facilitate the optimum interaction with the surface of the planar guests, in a clear example of an guest&#8208;induced fit conformational arrangement. The electrochemical studies of the encapsulation of N,N&#8217;&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;naphthalenetetracarboxy diimide (NTCDI) show that the redox active guest is released from the receptor upon one electron reduction, thus constituting an example of redox&#8208;switchable binding.

         <title>Rapid Aqueous Synthesis of Large&#8208;size and Edge/Defect&#8208;rich Porous Pd and Pd&#8208;alloyed Nanomesh for Electrocatalytic Ethanol Oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this work, we utilized a facile aqueous synthesis strategy (finished in 5 min at room temperature) to produce large&#8208;size Pd, PdCu, and PdPtCu nanomesh without additional organic ligands or solvent and the volume restriction of reaction solution. The obtained metallic nanomesh possess graphene&#8208;like morphology and a large size of dozens of microns. Abundant edges (coordinatively unsaturated sites, steps, and corners), defects (twins), and mesopores exhibited in the metallic ultrathin structures. The formation mechanism for porous Pd nanomesh disclosed that they undergo the oriented attachment growth along &lt;111&gt; direction. Owing to the structural and compositional advantages, PdCu porous nanomesh with certain elemental ratio (e.g., Pd  87  Cu  13  ) presented enhanced electrocatalytic performance (larger mass activity, better CO tolerance and stability) toward ethanol oxidation.</dc:description>

         <title>Solution&#8208;Processing of Topochemically Converted Layered WO3 for Multifunctional Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solution processing of nanomaterials is a promising technique to utilize in various applications owing to its simplicity and scalability. However, the studies on liquid phase exfoliation (LPE) of tungsten oxide (WO3) are limited, unlike others due to lack of commercial availability of bulk WO3 with layered structures. Herein, we report a one&#8208;step topochemical synthesis approach to obtain bulk layered WO3 from commercially available layered tungsten disulfide (WS2) by optimizing various parameters like reaction time and temperature. Detailed microscopic and spectroscopic techniques have confirmed the conversion process. Further, LPE has been carried out on topochemically converted bulk layered WO3 in twenty&#8208;two different solvents, and among studied solvents isopropyl alcohol&#8208;water (1:1) co&#8208;solvent system appears to be the best. This indicates that the possible values of surface tension and Hansen solubility parameters for bulk WO3 could be close to that of co&#8208;solvent system. The obtained WO3 dispersions in a low boiling point solvent enable to fabricate thin films with varying thickness using spray deposition method. The obtained thin films are used as active materials in supercapacitors without any conductive additives/binders and exhibited an areal capacitance of 31.7 mF cm&#8208;2 at 5 mV s&#8208;1. The photoelectrochemical measurements reveal that these thin films can also be used as photoanodes for photoelectrochemical water oxidation.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A library of gold(I) chloride complexes with phosphine ligands incorporating pendant (thio)urea and squaramide H&#8208;bond donors was prepared with the aim of promoting chloride abstraction from Au(I) via H&#8208;bonding. In the absence of silver additives, complexes bearing squaramides and trifluoromethylated aromatic ureas displayed good catalytic activity in the cyclization of N&#8208;propargyl benzamides, as well as in a 1,6&#8208;enyne cycloisomerization, a tandem cyclization&#8208;indole addition reaction and the hydrohydrazination of phenylacetylene. Kinetic studies and DFT calculations indicate that the energetic span of the reaction is accounted by both the chloride abstraction step, facilitated by the bidentate H&#8208;bond donor via an associative mechanism, and the subsequent cyclization step.</dc:description>

         <title>Organic Positive Materials for Magnesium Batteries: A Review</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mg cell is one of the promising candidate to replace to Li&#8208;ion batteries thanks to its advantages such as more abundance, cheaper and most importantly, the safety for the users. Positive electrode study is an important field in its development. Not only inorganic materials, but also the organic positive electrode research remains a major challenge to its potential use. Therefore, in this review, studies on organic positive electrodes in Mg batteries so far will be generalized.







Abstract
Magnesium batteries, like lithium&#8208;ion batteries, with higher abundance and similar efficiency, have drawn great interest for large&#8208;scale applications such as electric vehicles, grid energy storage and many more. On the other hand, the use of organic electrode materials allows high energy&#8208;performance, metal&#8208;free, environmentally friendly, versatile, lightweight, and economically efficient magnesium storage devices. In particular, the structural diversity and the simple activity of organic molecules make redox properties, and hence battery efficiency, easy to monitor. While organic magnesium batteries still in their infancy, this field becomes more and more promising because significant results were reported. To summarize the achievements in studies on organic cathodes for magnesium systems, their synthesis is discussed, combined with electrode design to provide the basis for controlling the electrochemical properties. Moreover, the techniques to synthesize organic materials with high&#8208;yield are mentioned. Finally, potential problems and prospects are explored to further improve organic cathodes.

         <title>Cs4B4O3F10: First Fluorooxoborate with [BF4] Involving Heteroanionic Units and Extremely Low Melting Point</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new congruently melting borate Cs4B4O3F10 has been synthesized as the first fluorooxoborate with [BF4] involving heteroanionic units, which possesses two highly fluorinated anionic clusters and therefore its formula can be expressed as Cs3(B3O3F6)&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;Cs(BF4). More importantly, Cs4B4O3F10 shows the lowest melting point among all the available borates and thus sets a new record for such system.







Abstract
Herein, a new congruently melting mixed&#8208;anion compound Cs4B4O3F10 has been characterized as the first fluorooxoborate with [BF4] involving heteroanionic units. Compound Cs4B4O3F10 possesses two highly fluorinated anionic clusters and therefore its formula can be expressed as Cs3(B3O3F6)&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;Cs(BF4). The influence of [BF4] units on micro&#8208;symmetry and structural evolution was discussed based on the parent compound. More importantly, Cs4B4O3F10 shows the lowest melting point among all the available borates and thus sets a new record for such system. This work is of great significance to enrich and tailor the structure of borates using perfluorinated [BF4] units.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herein, a new congruently melting mixed-anion compound Cs&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;B&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; has been characterized as the first fluorooxoborate with [BF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;] involving heteroanionic units. Compound Cs&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;B&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; possesses two highly fluorinated anionic clusters and therefore its formula can be expressed as Cs&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(B&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;)&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;Cs(BF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;). The influence of [BF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;] units on micro-symmetry and structural evolution was discussed based on the parent compound. More importantly, Cs&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;B&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; shows the lowest melting point among all the available borates and thus sets a new record for such system. This work is of great significance to enrich and tailor the structure of borates using perfluorinated [BF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;] units.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Using Small Molecules to Enhance P450 OleT Enzyme Activity in Situ</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A class of small molecules was reported to enhance the catalytic efficiency of P450 OleTSA by interaction with the enzyme active center. Up to 6&#8208;fold increase of terminal alkenes yield has been achieved in the small molecule stimulated enzymatic reactions.







Abstract
Cytochrome P450 OleT is a fatty acid decarboxylase that catalyzes the production of olefins with biofuel and synthetic applications. However, the relatively sluggish catalytic efficiency of the enzyme limits its applications. Here, we report the application of a novel class of benzene containing small molecules to improve the OleT activity. The UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy study and molecular docking results confirmed the high proximity of the small molecules to the heme group of OleT. Up to 6&#8208;fold increase of product yield has been achieved in the small molecule&#8208;modulated enzymatic reactions. Our work thus sheds the light to the application of small molecules to increase the OleT catalytic efficiency, which could be potentially used for future olefin productions.

         <title>Indium&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8208;F Bond Transformation through Oxymetalation/&#946;&#8208;Fluorine Elimination to Access Fluorinated Isocoumarins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fluorinated isocoumarin (depicted as a gladiator&#8242;s shield in the cover image) is transformed from a gem&#8208;difluoroalkene (wood shield) by virtue of the cool property of an indium catalyst (shooting star). Both fluorinated heterocycles and isocoumarins are alluring structural motifs, and we developed a comprehensive and novel strategy for the synthesis of fluorinated isocoumarins. Indium salts possess a moderate Lewis&#8208;acidity and affinity with gem&#8208;difluoroalkenes and both properties accomplished the reaction system. More information can be found in the Full Paper by Y. Nishimoto, M. Yasuda et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202100672).

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Homometallic titanium oxo clusters are one of the most important groups of metal oxo clusters, with more than 300 examples characterized by X&#8208;ray structure analyses. Most of them are uncharged and are obtained by partial hydrolysis and condensation of titanium alkoxo derivatives. The cluster cores, ranging from 3 to &gt;50 titanium atoms, are stabilized by organic ligands. Apart from residual OR groups, carboxylato and phosphonato ligands are most frequent. The article critically reviews and categorizes the known structures and works out basic construction principles by comparing the different cluster types.</dc:description>

         <title>The Stronger the Better: Donor Substituents Push Catalytic Activity of Molecular Chromium Olefin Polymerization Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The donor strength of bifunctional pyridine&#8208;cyclopentadienyl ligands was altered systematically by the introduction of donating groups in the  para  &#8208;position of the pyridine. In the resulting chromium complexes an almost linear correlation between donor strength and the nitrogen&#8208;chromium distance as well as the electronic absorption maximum is experimentally observed. The connection of electron&#8208;donating groups in the ligand backbone leads to an efficient transfer of the electronic influences to the catalytically active metal center without restricting it through steric effects. Therefore, catalytic olefin polymerization activity, which is already very high for the previously studied catalysts, increase considerably by attaching para&#8208;amino groups to the chelating pyridine or quinoline, respectively. Combining electron rich indenyl ligands with para&#8208;amino substituted pyridines lead to the highest catalytic activities observed so far for this class of organo chromium olefin polymerisation catalysts. The resulting polymers are of ultra high molecular weight and the ability of the catalysts to incorporate co&#8208;monomer is also very high.</dc:description>

Its crystal structure demonstrates that the heterocycle retains its ability to autoassociate by chalcogen bonding (ChB) forming macrocyclic tetramers. The corresponding Te&#8230;O ChB distances are 2.062&#160;&#197;, the shortest observed to date in aggregates of this type. DFT&#8208;D3 calculations indicate that while the halogenated molecule is stronger as a ChB donor it also is a weaker ChB acceptor; the overall effect is that the ChBs in the chlorinated homotetramer are not significantly stronger. However, partial halogenation or scrambling selectively yield the 2:2 heterotetramer with alternating&#160;&#955;4 Te and&#160;&#955;2 Te centers, which calculations identified as the thermodynamically preferred arrangement.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual Plasmonic Au&#8211;Cu2&#8211;xS Nanocomposites: Design Strategies and Photothermal Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Coupling two different materials to create a hybrid nanostructured system is a powerful strategy for achieving synergistically enhanced properties and advanced functionalities. In the case of Au and Cu  2&#8211;  x  S, their combination at the nanoscale results in dual plasmonic Au&#8211;Cu  2&#8211;  x  S nanocomposites that exhibit intense photon absorption in both the visible and the near&#8208;infrared spectral range. Their strong light&#8208;absorbing property translates to superior photothermal transduction efficiency, rendering them attractive in photothermal&#8208;based applications. There are several nanostructure configurations that are possible for the Au&#8211;Cu  2&#8211;  x  S system, and the successful fabrication of a particular architecture often requires a carefully planned synthetic strategy. In this Minireview, we present the different synthetic approaches that can be employed to produce rationally designed Au&#8211;Cu  2&#8211;  x  S nanocomposites, with focus on the experimental protocols that can lead to heterodimer, core&#8722;shell, reverse core&#8722;shell, and yolk&#8722;shell configurations. We also discuss the photothermal behavior of these materials and provide a glimpse of their potential use as photothermally active agents in therapeutic and theranostic applications.</dc:description>

We also discuss the photothermal behavior of these materials and provide a glimpse of their potential use as photothermally active agents in therapeutic and theranostic applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>Polyoxometalate (POM)&#8208;resorcin[4]arene&#8208;based inorganic&#8722;organic complexes are a kind of potential multifunctional materials for their adjustable structures and diverse functions. They have potentials applications for lithium ion batteries (LIBs). Additionally, the relationship between different coordinated metal ions and electrochemical performance was also rarely investigated. Herein, three functionalized POM&#8208;resorcin[4]arene&#8208;based inorganic&#8722;organic materials, [Co2(TMR4A)2(H2O)10][SiW12O40]&#183;2EtOH&#183;4.5H2O (1), [Ni2(TMR4A)2(H2O)10][SiW12O40]&#183;4EtOH&#183;13H2O (2) and [Zn2(TMR4A)2(H2O)10][SiW12O40]&#183;2EtOH&#183;2H2O (3), have been synthesized. Further, to enhance the conductivities of these compounds, 1&#8208;3 were doped with reduced graphene oxide (RGO) to gain composites 1@RGO&#8208;3@RGO, respectively. As anode materials for LIBs, 1@RGO&#8208;3@RGO can deliver very high discharge capacities (1445.9, 1285.0 and 1095.3 mAh g&#8722;1, respectively) in the initial run, and show the discharge capacities of 898, 665 and 651 mAh g&#8722;1 at the current density of 0.1 A g&#8722;1 over 100 runs, respectively. More importantly, the discharge capacities of 319, 283 and 329 mAh g&#8722;1 were still maintained for 1@RGO&#8208;3@RGO even after 400 cycles at the large current density (1 A g&#8722;1).</dc:description>

         <title>A Disulfide Switch Providing Absolute Handedness Control in Double Helices via Conversion from the Antiparallel to Parallel Helical Pattern</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A strategy to reversibly switch the parallel/antiparallel helical conformation of aromatic double helices through the formation/breakage of a disulfide bond is presented. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structures, NMR, and circular dichroism spectroscopy demonstrate that the double helices with terminal thiol groups favor an antiparallel helical arrangement both in the solid state and in solution, while the  P  /  M  bias of helicity induced by chiral segments from another extremity of the sequence is weak in this structural motif. The antiparallel helices can be rearranged to parallel helices through the disulfide connection of the sequences. This in turn enhances the bias of helical handedness and results in absolute chirality control of the double helices. The handedness mediated process can be governed by the oxidation&#8208;reduction cycle, thereby switching the structural arrangement and the enhancement of chiral bias. In addition, we find that the sequences can dimerize into an intermolecular double helix with the disulfide connection. And the helical handedness is also fully controlled due to the head&#8208;to&#8208;head structural motif.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Electrophilic anions of type [B12X11]&#8208;  posses a vacant positive boron binding site within the anion. In a comparatitve experimental and theoretical study the reactivity of [B12X11]&#8208;  with X&#160;=&#160;F, Cl, Br, I, CN is characterized towards different nucleophiles: (i) noble gases (NGs) as &#963;&#8208;donors and (ii) CO/N2  as &#963;&#8208;donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptors. Temperature&#8208;dependent formation of [B12X11NG]&#8208;  indicate the enthalpy order (X&#160;=&#160;CN)&#160;&gt;&#160;(X&#160;=&#160;Cl) &#8776;&#160;(X&#160;=&#160;Br)&#160;&gt;&#160;(X&#160;=&#160;I) &#8776;&#160;(X&#160;=&#160;F) almost independent of the NG in good agreement with calculated trends. The observed order is explained by an interplay of the electron deficiency of the vacant boron site in [B12X11  ]&#8208;  and steric effects. The binding of CO and N2  to [B12X11  ]&#8208;  is significantly stronger. The B3LYP 0K attachment enthapies follow the order (X=F) &gt;&#160;(X=CN) &gt; (X=Cl) &gt; (X=Br) &gt; (X=I), in contrats to the NG series. The bonding motifs of [B12X11CO]&#8208;  and [B12X11N2  ]&#8208;  were characterized using cryogenic ion trap vibrational spectroscopy by focusing on the CO and N2  stretching frequencies &#957;CO  and &#957;N2  , respectively. Observed shifts of &#957;CO  and &#957;N2  are explained by an interplay between electrostatic effects (blue shift), due to the positive partial charge, and by &#960;&#8208;backdonation (red shift). Energy decomposition analysis and analysis of natural orbitals for chemical valence support all conclusions based on the experimental results. This establishes a rational understanding of [B12X11]&#8208;  reactivety dependent on the substituent X and provides first systematic data on &#960;&#8208;backdonation from delocalized &#963;&#8208;electron systems of  closo  &#8208;borate anions.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Active Halogen Bonding and Chalcogen Bonding Chloride Transporters with Non&#8208;Protonophoric Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synthetic anion transporters show much promise as potential anti&#8208;cancer agents and therapeutics for diseases associated with mis&#8208;regulation of protein anion channels. In such applications high activity and anion selectivity are crucial to overcome competing proton or hydroxide transport which dissipates cellular pH gradients. Here we report highly active bidentate halogen bonding and chalcogen bonding anion carriers based on electron deficient iodo&#8208; and telluromethyl&#8208;triazole derivatives. Anion transport experiments in lipid bilayer vesicles reveal record nanomolar chloride transport activity for the bidentate halogen bonding anion carrier, and remarkably high chloride over proton/hydroxide selectivity for the chalcogen bonding anionophore. Computational studies provide further insight into the role of sigma&#8208;hole mediated anion recognition and desolvation at the membrane interface. Comparison with hydrogen bonding analogues demonstrates the importance of employing sigma&#8208;hole donor motifs in synthetic anionophores for achieving both high transport activity and selectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Ultimate Corrosion to Pt&#8208;Cu Electrocatalysts for Enhancing Methanol Oxidation Activity and Stability in Acidic Media</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Acid tested: An ultimate corrosion method to Pt&#8722;Cu electrocatalysts is presented that greatly promotes electrocatalytic activity and stability for methanol oxidation under acidic conditions. The formation mechanism has been investigated, and a mesostructured re&#8208;formation and atomic re&#8208;organization process is proposed. Our method could potentially be extended to the facile synthesis of highly acid stable Pt&#8208;based alloys with excellent electrocatalytic performance.







Abstract
Alloying platinum (Pt) with transition metals (M), as an established class of electrocatalysts, reduces the use of Pt and improves the electrocatalytic performance. However, the stability of transition metals in nanostructured platinum alloys is a fundamental and practical problem in electrocatalysis, due to leaching of transition metals under acidic operating condition. Here, a corrosion method has been developed for a Pt&#8722;Cu electrocatalyst with high activity (6.6 times that of commercial Pt/C) and excellent stability for the methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) under acidic operating conditions. The mechanism of formation has been studied, and possible mesostructured re&#8208;formation and atomic re&#8208;organization have been proposed. This work offers an effective strategy for the facile synthesis of a highly acid&#8208;stable PtM alloying and opens a door to high&#8208;performance design for electrocatalysts.

         <title>The Most Active Oxidase&#8208;Mimicking Mn2O3 Nanozyme for Biosensor Signal Generation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mn2O3 nanoparticles have the highest oxidase&#8208;like activity among the tested metal oxides, but the activity is inhibited by H2O2. Mn3O4 behaves similarly, while the activity of MnO2 is enhanced by H2O2.







Abstract
Oxidase&#8208;mimicking nanozymes are more desirable than peroxidase&#8208;mimicking ones since H2O2 can be omitted. However, only a few nanomaterials are known for oxidase&#8208;like activities. In this work, we compared the activity of Mn2O3, Mn3O4 and MnO2 and found that Mn2O3 had the highest oxidase activity. Interestingly, the activity of Mn2O3 was even inhibited by H2O2. The oxidase&#8208;like activity of Mn2O3 was not much affected by the presence of proteins such as bovine serum albumin (BSA), but the physisorption of antibodies to Mn2O3 was not strong enough to withstand the displacement by BSA. We then treated Mn2O3 with 3&#8208;aminopropyltriethoxysilane to graft an amine group, which was used to conjugate antibodies using glutaraldehyde as a crosslinker. A one&#8208;step indirect competitive ELISA (icELISA) was developed for the detection of isocarbophos, and an IC50 of 261.7&#8197;ng/mL was obtained, comparable with the results of the standard two&#8208;step assay using horseradish peroxidase (HRP)&#8208;labeled antibodies. This assay has the advantage of significant timesaving for rapid detection of large amounts of samples. This work has discovered a highly efficient oxidase&#8208;mimicking nanozyme useful for various nano&#8208; and analytical applications.

         <title>Organometallic Molecular Wires with Thioacetylene Backbones, trans&#8208;{RS&#8208;(C&#8801;C)n}2Ru(phosphine)4: High Conductance through Non&#8208;Aromatic Bridging Linkers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The scanning tunneling microscope break&#8208;junction study of thioacetylene ruthenium molecular wires exhibited single&#8208;molecule conductance higher than that of the related organometallic wires indicating the superiority of the acetylene bridging linkers as well as the thioether coordination anchor groups. The DFT non&#8208;equilibrium Green's function study supports the high conductance of the thioacetylene molecular wires, for which HOMOs are the dominant conductance pathways.







Abstract
In this work, the design, synthesis, and single&#8208;molecule conductance of ethynyl&#8208; and butadiynyl&#8208;ruthenium molecular wires with thioether anchor groups [RS=n&#8208;C6H13S, p&#8208;tert&#8208;Bu&#8722;C6H4S), trans&#8208;{RS&#8722;(C&#8801;C)n}2Ru(dppe)2 (n=1 (1R), 2 (2R); dppe: 1,2&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)ethane) and trans&#8208;(n&#8208;C6H13S&#8722;C&#8801;C)2Ru{P(OMe)3}4 3hex] are reported. Scanning tunneling microscope break&#8208;junction study has revealed conductance of the organometallic molecular wires with the thioacetylene backbones higher than that of the related organometallic wires having arylethynylruthenium linkages with the sulfur anchor groups, trans&#8208;{p&#8208;MeS&#8722;C6H4&#8208;(C&#8801;C)n}2Ru(phosphine)4 4n (n=1, 2) and trans&#8208;(Th&#8722;C&#8801;C)2Ru(phosphine)4 5 (Th=3&#8208;thienyl). It should be noted that the molecular junctions constructed from the butadiynyl wire 2R, trans&#8208;{Au&#8722;RS&#8722;(C&#8801;C)2}2Ru(dppe)2 (Au: gold metal electrode), show conductance comparable to that of the covalently linked polyynyl wire with the similar molecular length, trans&#8208;{Au&#8722;(C&#8801;C)3}2Ru(dppe)2 63. The DFT non&#8208;equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) study supports the highly conducting nature of the thioacetylene molecular wires through HOMO orbitals.

CASTing call: A semi&#8208;rational combinatorial active&#8208;site saturation test (CAST) was performed to improve the C&#946; stereoselectivity of threonine aldolase. MD simulations suggested that the Y314R variant could interact with 4&#8208;methylsulfonyl benzaldehyde through hydrogen bonding to control the direction of entry of substrate, this increased the de value from 58 to 81&#8201;%.







Abstract
l&#8208;Threonine aldolase from Actinocorallia herbida (AhLTA) is an ideal catalyst for producing l&#8208;threo&#8208;4&#8208;methylsulfonylphenylserine [(2S,3R)&#8208;1&#8201;b], a key chiral precursor for florfenicol and thiamphenicol. The moderate C&#946; stereoselectivity is the main obstacle to the industrial application of AhLTA. To address this issue, a combinatorial active&#8208;site saturation test (CAST) together with sequence conservatism analysis was applied to engineer the AhLTA toward improved C&#946; stereoselectivity. The optical mutant Y314R could asymmetrically synthesize l&#8208;threo&#8208;4&#8208;methylsulfonylphenylserine with 81&#8201;% diastereomeric excess (de), which is 23&#8201;% higher than wild&#8208;type AhLTA. Molecular dynamic (MD) simulations revealed that the mechanism for the improvement in C&#946; stereoselectivity of Y314R is due to the acylamino group of residues Arg314 controlling the orientation of substrate 4&#8208;methylsulfonyl benzaldehyde (1&#8201;a) in the active pocket by directed interaction with the methylsulfonyl group; this leads to asymmetric synthesis of l&#8208;threo&#8208;4&#8208;methylsulfonylphenylserine. The success in this study demonstrates that direct control of substrates in an active pocket is an attract strategy to address the C&#946; stereoselectivity problem of LTA and contribute to the industrial application of LTA.

         <title>One&#8208;Step Template/Solvent&#8208;Free Pyrolysis for In Situ Immobilization of CoP Nanoparticles onto N and P Co&#8208;Doped Carbon Porous Nanosheets towards High&#8208;efficiency Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>

         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;step scalable template/solvent&#8208;free pyrolysis strategy for in&#8197;situ immobiliziation of CoP nanoparticles with high uniformity and dispersity onto N and P co&#8208;doped carbon porous nanosheets, is demonstrated. Thanks to the compositional and structural advantages, the prepared CoP@N,P&#8208;CNSs sample exhibits outstanding electrocatalytic HER performance and extraordinary long&#8208;term stability in alkaline medium.







Abstract
The search for economical, active and stable electrocatalysts towards the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is highly imperative for the progression of water electrolysis technology and related sustainable energy conversion technologies. The delicate optimization of chemical composition and architectural configuration is paramount to design high&#8208;efficiency non&#8208;precious metal HER electrocatalysts. Herein, we report a one&#8208;step scalable template/solvent&#8208;free pyrolysis approach for in&#8197;situ immobilizing uniform CoP nanoparticles onto N and P co&#8208;doped carbon porous nanosheets (denoted as CoP@N,P&#8208;CNSs hereafter). The simultaneous consideration of architectural design and nanocarbon hybridization renders the formed CoP@N,P&#8208;CNSs with plentiful well&#8208;dispersed anchored active sites, shortened pathway for mass diffusion, enhanced electric conductivity, and reinforced mechanical stability. As a consequence, the optimized CoP@N,P&#8208;CNSs exhibit an overpotential of 115&#8197;mV to afford a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, small Tafel slope of 74.2&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1, high Faradaic efficiency of nearly 100&#8201;%, and superb long&#8208;term durability in an alkaline medium. Given the fabrication feasibility, mass production potential and outstanding HER performance, the CoP@N,P&#8208;CNSs may hold great promise for large&#8208;scale electrochemical water splitting. More importantly, the explored one&#8208;step template/solvent&#8208;free pyrolysis methodology offers a feasible and versatile route to fabricate carbon nanosheet&#8208;based nanocomposites for diverse energy conversation&#8208;related applications.

         <title>Organophotocatalytic Aerobic Oxygenation of Phenols in a Visible&#8208;Light Continuous&#8208;Flow Photoreactor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The design of a customized continuous&#8208;flow photoreactor enabled a highly efficient aerobic oxygenation of phenols to provide benzoquinones and p&#8208;quinols. By using pressurized air as oxidant, ecologically benign solvents and low amounts of methylene blue as organophotocatalyst in combination with hyper red LEDs, excellent selectivity values and yields were obtained. The method is expected to improve sustainability for the production of a variety of crucial products and intermediates.







Abstract
A mild photocatalytic phenol oxygenation enabled by a continuous&#8208;flow photoreactor using visible light and pressurized air is described herein. Products for wide&#8208;ranging applications, including the synthesis of vitamins, were obtained in high yields by precisely controlling principal process parameters. The reactor design permits low organophotocatalyst loadings to generate singlet oxygen. It is anticipated that the efficient aerobic phenol oxygenation to benzoquinones and p&#8208;quinols contributes to sustainable synthesis.

         <title>Synthesis of Lignans Based on a Borate&#8208;mediated One&#8208;pot Sequential Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura Coupling of Cyclic Boranes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lignans are a kingdom of phytochemicals and have attracted much attention due to their structural variety and intriguing biological activities. Herein we report a unified synthetic approach to lignans that consisted of three phases: stereo&#8208;, substrate&#8208;, and skeletal&#8208;diversification. The approach was successfully applied to the syntheses of various lignans in a modular manner.







Abstract
Lignans are a group of polyphenolic phytochemicals that possess a large spectrum of chemical structures and biological activities. Here the syntheses of lignans &#8211; anwulignan, burseran, dehydroxycubebin, ruburisandrin B, and sesamin &#8211; are achieved based on a borate&#8208;mediated one&#8208;pot sequential Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling of cis&#8208; and trans&#8208;fused bicyclic boranes, which were prepared by diastereoselective cyclic hydroboration of exo&#8208;cyclic diene with cyclopentyl&#8208; and thexylboranes, respectively. A one&#8208;pot sequential Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling of each cyclic borate with various aryl bromides initiated by activation of the cyclic borane with the carbon nucleophile provided 2,3&#8208;dibenzylbutane derivatives with different aromatic substituents. Finally, the syntheses of naturally occurring lignans were accomplished in several steps from the products of Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura coupling.

         <title>Redox Chemistry of Heterobimetallic Polypnictogen Triple&#8208;Decker Complexes &#8211; Rearrangement, Fragmentation and Transfer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The redox chemistry of heterobimetallic triple&#8208;decker complexes (Fe/Co and Co/Ni) with polypnictogen ligands (E=P, As) was studied first by cyclic voltammetry and then experimentally. The complexes respond to the addition and withdrawal of electrons either by the rearrangement of the triple&#8208;decker geometry, by the fragmentation of the En ligand and/or by the exchange of {Cp&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;M} fragments.







Abstract
The redox chemistry of the heterobimetallic triple&#8208;decker complexes [(Cp*Fe)(Cp&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;Co)(&#956;,&#951;5:&#951;4&#8208;E5)] (E=P (1), As (2), Cp*=1,2,3,4,5&#8208;pentamethyl&#8208;cyclopentadienyl, Cp&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;=1,2,4&#8208;tri&#8208;tertbutyl&#8208;cyclopentadienyl) and [(Cp&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;Co)(Cp&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;Ni)(&#956;,&#951;3:&#951;3&#8208;E3)] (E=P (10), As (11)) was investigated. Compound 1 and 2 could be oxidized to the monocations 3 and 4 and further to the dications 5 and 6, while the initially folded cyclo&#8208;E5 ligand planarizes upon oxidation. The reduction leads to an opposite change in the geometry of the middle deck, which is now folded stronger into the direction of the other metal fragment (formation of monoanions 7 and 8). For the arsenic compound 8, a different behavior is found since a fragmentation into an As6 (9) and As3 ligand complex occurs. The Co and Ni triple&#8208;decker complexes 10 and 11 can be oxidized initially to the heterometallic monocations 12 and 13, which are not stable in solution and convert selectively into the homometallic nickel complexes 14 and 15 and the cobalt complexes 16 and 17. This behavior was further proven by the oxidation of [(Cp&#8242;&#8242;&#8242;Co)(Cp&#8242;&#8242;Ni)(&#956;,&#951;3:&#951;2&#8208;P3)] (19, Cp&#8242;&#8242;=1,3&#8208;di&#8208;tertbutyl&#8208;cyclopentadienyl) comprising two different Cp ligands. The transfer of {CpRM} fragments can be suppressed when a {W(CO)5} unit is coordinated to the P3 ligand (20) prior to the oxidation and the mixed cobalt and nickel cation 21 can be isolated. The reduction of 10 and 11 yields the heterometallic monoanions 22 and 23, where no transfer of the {CpRM} fragments is observed.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have developed a widely applicable approach to synthesize ketones, esters, amides via the oxidative C&#8208;C bond cleavage of readily available alkyl aldehydes. Green and abundant molecular oxygen (O  2  ) was used as the oxidant, and base metals (cobalt and copper) were used as the catalysts. This strategy can be extended to the one&#8208;pot synthesis of ketones from primary alcohols and &#945;&#8208;ketoamides from aldehydes.</dc:description>

         <title>Fabrication of Pd/Mg2P2O7 via a Struvite&#8208;template Way from Wastewater and Application as Chemoselective Catalyst in Hydrogenation of Nitroarenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A highly efficient heterogeneous catalyst Pd/ Mg  2  P  2  O  7&#160;  was fabricated by combining palladium nanoparticles (Pd NPs) and mesoporous Mg  2  P  2  O  7  fibers/rods. The Mg  2  P  2  O  7  fibers with ultra high specific surface area were prepared from struvite as templates which were synthesized from wastewater consisting of N&#8208; and P&#8208;containing pollutants. This strategy provided a novel pathway in developing advanced catalysts from eutrophication polluted water. The composite Pd/Mg  2  P  2  O  7  showed brilliant performance in selective hydrogenation of nitro&#8208;aromatics to get anilines. As an example of nitrobenzene hydrogenation, the conversion and selectivity to aniline were found to reach almost 100% at temperature of T=90&#176;C and under pressure of P  H2  =2.0 MPa. The superior performance was found to originate from Pd NPs which were boosted by electron transfer afforded by the nano&#8208;fibers Mg  2  P  2  O  7  supports. The favorable adsorption of withdrawing groups (&#8208;NO  2  ) was realized by synergistic effects between Pd and oxygen vacancies provided by pyrolysis of struvite. The catalyst remained stably after cycles of reuse with little degradation in catalysis.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Efficient methods for the synthesis of fluorinated compounds have been intensively studied, recently. Development of practical fluorinating reagents is indispensable for this purpose. Herein, bench&#8208;stable electrophilic fluorinating reagents were synthesized as  N  &#8208;fluorobenzenesulfonimide (NFSI) substitutes. Reagents obtained by replacing one of the NFSI sulfonyl groups with an acyl group led to the highly selective monofluorination of silyl enol ethers with suppression of undesired overreaction, that is difluorination. On the other hand, reagents bearing electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents at NFSI benzenesulfonyl groups efficiently facilitated the difluorination of silyl enol ethers under base&#8208;free conditions.

Herein, we report a scalable and cost&#8208;effective strategy for the construction of one&#8208;dimensional (1&#8208;D) carbon nanofiber architecture with simultaneous decoration of single Fe&#8208;Nx sites and highly dispersed Fe/Fe3C nanoparticles for efficient ORR, through the Fe(III) complex assisted&#8208;electrospinning of gelatin nanofibers with subsequent pre&#8208;oxidation and carbonization. Results show that the presence of Fe(III) complex enables the 1&#8208;D gelatin nanofibers to be well retained during the pre&#8208;oxidation process. Owing to the distinct 1&#8208;D nanofiber structure and the synergistic effect of Fe/Fe3C and Fe&#8208;Nx sites, the resulting electrocatalyst is highly active for ORR with a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.885 V (outperforming commercial Pt/C) and a superior electrochemical stability in alkaline electrolyte. Similarly, it also shows a high power density (144.7 mW cm&#8208;2) and a superior stability in Zn&#8208;air battery.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Exploring high-performance non-precious metal electrocatalyst for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is critical. Herein, we report a scalable and cost-effective strategy for the construction of one-dimensional (1-D) carbon nanofiber architecture with simultaneous decoration of single Fe-Nx sites and highly dispersed Fe/Fe3C nanoparticles for efficient ORR, through the Fe(III) complex assisted-electrospinning of gelatin nanofibers with subsequent pre-oxidation and carbonization.

         <title>Rethinking Borole Cycloaddition Reactivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Boroles are attracting broad interest for their myriad and diverse applications, including in synthesis, small&#8208;molecule activation and functional materials. Their properties and reactivity are closely linked to the cyclic conjugated diene system, which has been shown to participate in cycloaddition reactions, such as the Diels&#8208;Alder reaction with alkynes. The reaction steps leading to boranorbornadienes, borepins and tricyclic boracyclohexenes from the thermal reaction of boroles with alkynes are seemingly well understood as judged from the literature. Herein, we question the long&#8208;established mechanistic picture of pericyclic rearrangements by demonstrating that seven&#8208;membered borepins (i.e. heptaphenylborepin and two derivatives substituted with a thienyl and chloride substituent on boron) exist in a dynamic equilibrium with the corresponding bicyclic boranorbornadienes, the direct Diels&#8208;Alder products, but are not isolable products from the reactions. Heating gradually converts the isomeric mixtures into fluorescent tricyclic boracyclohexenes, the most stable isomers in the series. Results from mechanistic DFT calculations reveal that the tricyclic compounds derive from the boranorbornadienes and not the borepins, which were previously believed to be intermediates in purely pericyclic processes.</dc:description>

         <title>A Redox&#8208;active Tetrazine&#8208;based Pincer Ligand for the Reduction of N&#8208;oxyanions Using a Redox&#8208;inert Metal</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reaction chemistry of the bis&#8208;tetrazinyl pyridine ligand (btzp) towards nitrogen oxyanions coordinated to zinc is studied in order to explore the reduction of the NO  x  &#713; substrates with a redox&#8208;active ligand in the absence of redox activity at the metal. Following syntheses and characterization of (btzp)ZnX  2  for X = Cl, NO  3  and NO  2  , featuring O&#8208;Zn linkage of both nitrogen oxyanions, it is shown that a silylating agent selectively delivers silyl substituents to tetrazine nitrogens, without reductive deoxygenation of NO  x  &#8208;1  . A new synthesis of the highly hydrogenated H  4  btzp, containing two dihydrotetrazine reductants is described as is the synthesis and characterization of (H  4  btzp)ZnX  2  for X = Cl and NO  3  , both of which show considerable hydrogen bonding potential of the dihydrotetrazine ring NH groups. The (H  4  btzp)ZnCl  2  complex does not bind zinc in the pincer pocket, but instead H  4  btzp becomes a bridge between neighboring atoms through tetrazine nitrogen atoms, forming a polymeric chain. The reaction of AgNO  2  with (H  4  btzp)ZnCl  2  is shown to proceed with fast nitrite deoxygenation, yielding water and free NO. Half of the H  4  btzp reducing equivalents form Ag  0  and thus the chloride ligand remains coordinated to the zinc metal center to yield (btzp)ZnCl  2  . To compare with AgNO  2  , experiments of (H  4  btzp)ZnCl  2  with NaNO  2  result in salt metathesis between chloride and nitrite, highlighting the importance of a redox&#8208;active cation in the reduction of nitrite to NO.</dc:description>

         <title>Upper Critical Solution Temperature&#8208;Type Responsive Cyclodextrins with Characteristic Inclusion Abilities</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Water&#8208;soluble and thermoresponsive macrocycles with stable inclusion toward guests are highly valuable to construct stimuli&#8208;responsive supramolecular materials for versatile applications. Here, we develop such macrocycles, ureido&#8208;substituted cyclodextrins (CDs) which exhibit unprecedented upper critical solution temperature (UCST) behavior in aqueous media. These novel CD derivatives showed good solubility in water at elevated temperature, but collapsed from water to form large coacervates upon cooling to low temperature. Their cloud points are dependent greatly on concentrations, and furthermore, can be mediated through oxidation and chelation with silver ion. Significantly, amphiphilicity of these CD derivatives is supportive to the host&#8208;guest binding, which afford them to retain inclusion abilities to guest dyes. The inclusion complexation remained nearly intact during thermally induced phase transitions, which makes contrast to the switchable inclusion behavior of lower critical solution temperature (LCST)&#8208;type CDs. Moreover, ureido&#8208;substituted CDs were exploited to coencapsulate a pair of guest dyes whose fluorescence resonance energy transfer process can be switched by the UCST phase transition. We therefore believe this novel thermoresponsive CDs may form a new strategy for developing smart macrocycles and allow for exploring smart supramolecular materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Functional Carbazole&#8208;Fullerene Complexes: A New Perspective of Carbazoles Acting as NanoOctopus to Capture Globular Fullerenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fullerene host&#8208;guest constructs have attracted increasing attention owing to their molecular&#8208;level hybrid arrangements. However, the usage of simple carbazolic derivatives to bind with fullerenes is rare. In this research, we rationally designed three novel carbazolic derivatives containing a tunable bridging linker and carbazole units for the capturing of fullerenes. Unlike the general concave&#8208;convex interactions, fullerenes could interact with the planar carbazole subunits to form 2&#8208;dimensional hexagonal/quadrilateral cocrystals with alternating stacking patterns of 1:1 or 1:2 stoichiometry, as well as the controllable fullerene packing modes. At the meanwhile, good electron&#8208;transporting performances and significant photovoltaic effects were realized when continuous C  60  &#183;&#183;&#183;C  60  interaction channel existed. Our results indicate that the introduction of such carbazolic system into fullerene receptor would provide us new insights into novel fullerene host&#8208;guest architectures for versatile applications.</dc:description>

triphosphine calix[6]arene ligands. These supramolecular wheels,

with recognition features governed by the hydrogen-bonding domain,

were employed to synthesize multitasking trinuclear gold(I)

complexes as a new platform for the synthesis of interwoven

(pseudo)rotaxanes species. Parallelly, the multivalent, metal-bonded

upper-rim displayed catalytic features promoting highly selective gold

catalyzed cycloisomerization reactions of 1,6-enynes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Comparative Investigation into the Complexation and Extraction Properties of Tetradentate and Tridentate Phosphine Oxide Functionalized 1,10&#8208;Phenanthroline Ligands toward Lanthanides and Actinides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two new phosphine oxide functionized 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline ligands, tetradentate 2,9&#8208;bis(butylphenylphosphine oxide)&#8208;1,10&#8208;phenanthroline (BuPh&#8208;BPPhen, L1) and tridentate 2&#8208;(butylphenylphosphine oxide)&#8208;1,10&#8208;phenanthroline (BuPh&#8208;MPPhen, L2), were synthesized and studied comparatively for the coordination with trivalent actinides and lanthanides. The complexation mechanisms of these two ligands toward trivalent f&#8208;block elements were thoroughly elucidated by NMR spectroscopy, UV&#8208;vis spectrophotometry, fluorescence spectrometry, single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, solvent extraction, and theoretical calculation methods. NMR titration results demonstrated that both 1:1 and 1:2 (metal to ligand) lanthanides complexes formed for L1 whereas 1:1, 1:2 and 1:3 lanthanide complexes formed for L2 in methanol solution. The formation of these species were also validated by fluorescence spectrometry and the corresponding stability constants for the complexes of Nd(III) with L1 and L2 were determined using UV&#8208;vis spectrophotometry. Structures of the 10&#8208;coordinated 1:1&#8208;type complexes of EuL1(NO3)3 and [EuL2(NO3)3(H2O)]&#8231;Et2O in solid state were characterized by X&#8208;ray crystallography. In solvent extraction experiments, L1 exhibited extremely strong extraction ability for both Am(III) and Eu(III) while L2 showed nearly no extraction toward Am(III) and Eu(III) due to its high hydrophilicity. Finally, the structures and bonding natures of those complexes species formed between Am(III)/Eu(III) and L1/L2 were analyzed using DFT calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Cu/CuxS Embedded N,S&#8208;doped Porous Carbon In Situ Derived from a Novelly Designed MOF for Efficient Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reasonable design of the precursor of the carbon&#8208;based nanocatalyst is an important pathway to improve its catalytic performance. In this study, a simple solvothermal method was used to synthesize [Cu(TPT)(2,5&#8208;tdc)]&#183;2H  2  O (  Cu&#8208;MOF  ) containing N and S atoms in one step. Further in&#8208;situ carbonization of the  Cu&#8208;MOF  as the precursor was used to synthesize Cu/Cu  x  S embedded N,S&#8208;doped porous carbon (Cu/Cu  x  S/NSC) composites. The catalytic activities of the prepared Cu/Cu  x  S/NSC were investigated through catalytic reduction of 4&#8208;nitrophenol (4&#8208;NP) to 4&#8208;aminophenol (4&#8208;AP). The results show that the designed Cu/Cu  x  S/NSC has exceptional catalytic activity and recycle stability, showing the reaction rate constant is 0.0256 s  &#8208;1  , and the conversion rate still exceeds 90% after 15 cycles. Meanwhile, the efficient catalytic reduction of dyes (CR, MO, MB and RhB) confirmed its versatility. Finally, the active sites of the Cu/Cu  x  S/NSC catalysts were analyzed and a possible multi&#8208;component synergistic catalytic mechanism was proposed.</dc:description>

         <title>Donor&#8208;Acceptor Type Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Intermolecular charge transfer (ICT) effect has been widely studied in both small molecules and linear polymers. Covalently&#8208;bonded donor&#8208;acceptor pairs with tunable bandgaps and photoelectric properties endow these materials with potential applications in optoelectronics, fluorescent bioimaging, and sensors, etc. However, owing to the lack of charge transfer pathway or effective separation of charge carriers, unfavorable charge recombination gives rise to inevitable energy loss. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) can be mediated with various geometry&#8208; and property&#8208;tailored building blocks, where donor (D) and acceptor (A) segments are connected by covalent bonds and can be finely arranged to form highly ordered networks (namely D&#8208;A COFs). The unique structural features of D&#8208;A COFs render the formation of segregated D&#8208;A stacks, thus provides pathways and channels for effective charge carriers transport. This minireview highlights the significant progress on D&#8208;A COFs over the past decade with emphasis on design principles, growing structural diversities, and promising application potentials.</dc:description>

         <title>Atomic Layer Deposition of Ternary Indium/Tin/Aluminum Oxide Thin Films, their characterization and Transistor Performance under Illumination</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Multilayered heterostructures comprising of In  2  O  3  , SnO  2  , and Al  2  O  3  were studied for their application in thin&#8208;film transistors (TFT). The compositional influence of tin oxide on the properties of the thin&#8208;film, as well as on the TFT characteristics is investigated. The heterostructures are fabricated by atomic layer deposition (ALD) at 200&#176;C, employing trimethylindium (TMI), tetrakis(dimethylamino)tin (TDMASn), trimethylaluminum (TMA), and water as precursors. After post&#8208;deposition annealing at 400&#176;C the thin&#8208;films are found to be amorphous, however, they show a discrete layer structure of the individual oxides of uniform film thickness and high optical transparency in the visible region. Incorporation of only two monolayers of Al  2  O  3  in the active semiconducting layer the formation of oxygen vacancies can be effectively suppressed, resulting in an improved semiconducting and switching behavior. The heterostacks comprising of In  2  O  3  /SnO  2  /Al  2  O  3  are incorporated into TFT devices, exhibiting a saturation field&#8208;effect mobility (&#181;  sat  ) of 2.0&#160;cm  2  &#183;V  &#8208;1  s  &#8208;1  , a threshold&#8208;voltage (V  th  ) of 8.6&#160;V, a high current on/off ratio (I  On  /I  Off  ) of 1.0&#183;10  7  , and a subthreshold swing (SS) of 485&#160;mV&#183;dec  &#8208;1  . The stability of the TFT under illumination is also altered to a significant extent. A change in the transfer characteristic towards conductive behavior is evident when illuminated with light of an energy of 3.1&#160;eV (400&#160;nm).</dc:description>

         <title>Nucleophilicities and Nucleofugalities of Thio&#8208; and Selenoethers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rate constants for the reactions of dialkyl chalcogenides with laser&#8208;flash photolytically generated benzhydrylium ions have been measured photometrically to integrate them in the comprehensive benzhydrylium&#8208;based nucleophilicity scale. The combination of these rate constants with the previously reported equilibrium constants for the same reactions provided the corresponding Marcus intrinsic barriers and made it possible to quantify the leaving group abilities (nucleofugalities) of dialkyl sulfides and dimethyl selenide. Due to the low intrinsic barriers, dialkyl chalcogenides are fairly strong nucleophiles (comparable to pyridine and  N  &#8208;methylimidazole) as well as good nucleofuges, which makes them useful group&#8208;transfer reagents.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective Protonation of Cyclic Carbonyl Ylides by Chiral Lewis Acid Assisted Alcohols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral Lewis acid&#8208;catalyzed asymmetric alcohol addition reactions to cyclic carbonyl ylides generated from  N  &#8208;(&#945;&#8208;diazocarbonyl)&#8208;2&#8208;oxazolidinones featuring a dual catalytic system are reported. Construction of a chiral quaternary heteroatom&#8208;substituted carbon center was accomplished in which the unique heterobicycles were obtained in good yields with high stereoselection. The alcohol adducts were successfully converted to optically active oxazolidine&#8208;2,4&#8208;diones by hydrolysis. Mechanistic studies by DFT calculations revealed that alcohols could be activated by Lewis acids, enabling enantioselective protonation of the carbonyl ylides.</dc:description>

         <title>Design and Application of Mini&#8208;libraries of the miRNA Probes for an Efficient and Versatile miRNA&#8208;mRNA Cross&#8208;linking</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>MicroRNAs constitute a class of endogenous, non&#8208;coding RNAs having a great influence on various processes within the cell. By base&#8208;pairing to partially&#8208;complementary sites located in the 3&#8217; untranslated region of target messenger RNAs, microRNAs participate in the post&#8208;transcriptional regulation of the majority of human protein&#8208;coding genes and their dysregulation has been related to many pathological processes and diseases. Thus, an in&#8208;depth understanding of the microRNA mechanisms of action is crucial. Here, we present a new concept of probe design to achieve an efficient and sequence&#8208;independent miRNA&#8208;mRNA cross&#8208;linking. The new strategy is based on the utilization of a controlled mixture of probes for a chosen miRNA, in which the trioxsalen moiety is introduced at the  N  4  &#8208;position of a selected cytidine through short oligoethylene glycol&#8208;based linkers.  In vitro  photo&#8208;cross&#8208;linking experiments with mini&#8208;libraries of probes for microRNAs of interest showed variable cross&#8208;linking efficiencies, giving strong evidence for the general applicability of the presented approach.</dc:description>

         <title>Methyl&#8208;induced Polarization Destabilizes Non&#8208;covalent Interactions of N&#8208;methylated Lysines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lysine methylation can modify non&#8208;covalent interactions by altering lysine's hydrophobicity as well as its electronic structure. While ramifications of the former are documented, the effects of the latter remain largely unknown. Understanding electronic structure is important for determining how biological methylation modulates protein&#8208;protein binding, and how artificial methylation impacts experiments in which methylated lysines are used as spectroscopic probes and protein crystallization facilitators. Benchmarked first principles calculations undertaken here reveal that methyl&#8208;induced polarization weakens electrostatic attraction of amines with protein functional groups &#8208; salt bridges, hydrogen bonds and cation&#8208;pi interactions weaken by as much as 10.3, 7.9 and 3.5&#160;kT, respectively. Multipole analysis shows that weakened electrostatics is due to altered inductive effects that overcome increased attraction from methyl&#8208;enhanced polarizability and dispersion. These effects, due to their fundamental nature, are expected to be present in many cases. Survey of methylated lysines in protein structures reveals several cases where methyl&#8208;induced polarization is the primary driver of altered non&#8208;covalent interactions, and in these cases destabilizations are found to be in the 0.6&#8208;4.7 kT range. The clearest case of where methyl&#8208;induced polarization plays a dominant role in regulating biological function is that of the PHD1&#8208;PHD2 domain that recognizes lysine methylated&#8208;states on histones. These results broaden our understanding of how methylation modulates non&#8208;covalent interactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Theoretical Insight into the Effect of Fluorine&#8208;Functionalized Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Supported Palladium Single&#8208;Site Catalyst in the Ethylene Dimerization Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ethylene dimerization reaction is one of the most common mechanisms for the production of 1&#8208;butene. Recently metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) have received extensive attention in this area since they combine all the advantages of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts in a single compound. Here is reported a computational mechanistic study of MOF&#8208;supported palladium single&#8208;site catalyst for ethylene dimerization reaction. Catalytic systems with both biphenyl&#8208;type backbone as organic ligand and its fluorine&#8208;functionalization have been investigated to reveal the origin of ligand effects on the catalytic activity and selectivity. The calculations revealed that the nonfluorinated palladium MOF catalyst undergoes dimerization over isomerization reaction. Then the influence of the fluorine&#8208;functionalized organic ligand was compared in the dimerization catalytic cycle, which was strongly favored in terms of activity and selectivity. Catalyst&#8208;substrate interactions were analyzed by energy decomposition analysis revealing the critical role of ligand backbone functionalization on the activity. This theoretical analysis identified three chemically meaningful dominant effects on these catalysts; steric, electrostatic and charge transfer effects. The steric effects promote nonfluorinated MOF catalyst, whereas the electrostatic effects are the dominant factor that promotes its fluorinated counterpart. This theoretical study provides feedback with future experimental studies about the role of fluorine ligand functionalization in palladium MOF catalysts for ethylene dimerization reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>Correlation between the dynamics of nanoconfined water and local chemical environments in calcium silicate hydrate nanominerals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Calcium silicate hydrates are members of a large family of minerals with layered structures containing hanging Ca&#8208;OH and Si&#8208;OH groups that interact with confined water molecules. To rationalize the impact of the local chemical environment on the dynamics of water, Si&#8208;OH&#8208;rich and Ca&#8208;OH&#8208;rich model nanocrystals were synthesized using the continuous supercritical hydrothermal method and then systematically studied by a combination of spectroscopic techniques. In our comprehensive analysis, the ultrafast relaxation dynamics of hanging hydroxyl groups can be univocally assigned to Ca&#8208;OH or Si&#8208;OH environments, and the local chemical environment largely affects the H&#8208;bond network of the solvation water. Interestingly, the ordered &#8220;ice&#8208;like&#8221; solvation water found in the Si&#8208;OH&#8208;rich environments is converted to a disordered &#8220;liquid&#8208;like&#8221; distribution in the Ca&#8208;OH&#8208;rich environment. This refined picture of the dynamics of confined water and hydroxyl groups in calcium silicate hydrates can also be applied to other water&#8208;containing materials, with a significant impact in many fields of materials science.</dc:description>

         <title>Hierarchical Architectures Based on Ru&#8208;Nanoparticles/Oxygen&#8208;Rich&#8208;CNT for Efficient Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Highly active and durable electrocatalysts are essential for producing hydrogen fuel through hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, we design the uniform deposition of Ru nanoparticles strongly interacting with oxygen&#8208;rich CNT architectures (Ru&#8208;OCNT) via ozonation and hydrothermal approaches. The hierarchical structure of Ru&#8208;OCNT is constructed by self&#8208;assembly of oxygen&#8208;functionalities of OCNT. Ru nanoparticles are strongly interacted with OCNT at Ru/OCNT interface for the excellent catalytic activity and stability of the Ru&#8208;OCNT, as further confirmed by density functional theory. Owing to the hierarchical structure and adjusted surface chemistry, Ru&#8208;OCNT has an overpotential of 34 mV at 10 mA cm&#8208;2  with a Tafel slope of 27.8 mV dec&#8208;1  in 1 M KOH, and an overpotential of 55 mV with Tafel slope of 33 mV dec&#8208;1  in 0.5 M H2SO4  . The smaller Tafel slope of Ru&#8208;OCNT than Ru&#8208;CNT and commercial Pt/C in both alkaline and acidic electrolytes indicates the high catalytic activity and fast charge transfer kinetics.

         <title>Asymmetric Total Synthesis of Oxazolomycins B and C</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report our efforts towards the first total synthesis of (&#8211;)&#8208;oxazolomycin B and (+)&#8208;oxazolomycin C from the intermediate of our previous synthesis of (+)&#8208;neoxazolomycin. The synthesis was achieved via a longest linear sequence of 25 steps from amino acid serine in 3.6% and 2.7% overall yield, respectively. The efficiency of our approach is derived from silyl triflate&#8208;mediated reductive oxazolidine ring&#8208;opening and F&#252;rstner&#8217;s Ru&#8208;catalyzed hydrosilylation and protodesilylation reactions. The obtained spectra and optical rotations were in good agreement with those of natural products, thus confirming the structures.</dc:description>

         <title>A Proton&#8208;Responsive Pyridyl(benzamide)&#8208;Functionalized NHC Ligand on Ir Complex for Alkylation of Ketones and Secondary Alcohols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A Cp*Ir(III) complex (  1  ) of a newly designed ligand L  1  featuring a proton&#8208;responsive pyridyl(benzamide) appended on N  &#8208;  heterocyclic carbene (NHC) has been synthesized. The molecular structure of  1  reveals a dearomatized form of the ligand. The protonation of  1  with HBF  4  in tetrahydrofuran gives the corresponding aromatized complex [Cp*Ir(L  1  H)Cl]BF  4  (  2  ). Both compounds are characterized spectroscopically and by X&#8208;ray crystallography. The protonation of  1  with acid is examined by  1  H NMR and UV&#8208;vis spectra. The proton&#8208;responsive character of  1  is exploited for catalyzing  &#945;  &#8208;alkylation of ketones and  &#946;  &#8208;alkylation of secondary alcohols using primary alcohols as alkylating agents through hydrogen&#8208;borrowing methodology. Compound  1  is an effective catalyst for these reactions and exhibits a superior activity in comparison to a structurally similar iridium complex [Cp*Ir(L  2  )Cl]PF  6  (  3  ) lacking a proton&#8208;responsive pendant amide moiety. The catalytic alkylation is characterized by a wide substrate scope, low catalyst and base loadings, and short reaction time. The catalytic efficacy of  1  is also demonstrated for the syntheses of quinoline and lactone derivatives via acceptorless dehydrogenation, and selective alkylation of two steroids, pregnenolone and testosterone. Detailed mechanistic investigations and DFT calculations substantiates the role of the proton&#8208;responsive ligand in the hydrogen&#8208;borrowing process.</dc:description>

         <title>Coordination&#8208;induced N&#8211;H Bond Splitting of Ammonia and Primary Amine of CuI&#8211;MOFs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we reported a porous three&#8208;dimensional anionic tetrazolium based Cu  I  &#8211;MOF  1  , which is capable of cleaving N&#8211;H bond of ammonia and primary amine, as well as O&#8211;H bond of H  2  O along with the spontaneous H  2  evolution. In the gas&#8208;solid phase reaction of  1  with ammonia and water vapour, Cu  I  &#8211;MOF  1  was gradually oxidized to NH  2  &#8211;Cu  II  &#8211;MOF and OH&#8211;Cu  II  &#8211;MOF, respectively, through single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (SCSC) structural transformations, which was confirmed by XPS, PXRD and X&#8208;ray single&#8208;crystal diffraction. Density functional theory (DFT) demonstrated that Cu  I  &#8211;MOF could lower N&#8208;H bond dissociation free energy of ammonia through coordination&#8208;induced bond weakening and promote H  2  evolution by the reduction potential of  1  . To our knowledge, this is the first example of MOFs which activated ammonia and amine in gas&#8208;solid manner.</dc:description>

         <title>Solvato Modulation of the Magnetic Memory in Isotopically Enriched Erbium Polyoxometallate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single&#8208;Molecule Magnet (SMM) property is molecular by essence while commonly measured in solid crystalline state. Solvent crystallization molecules are usually neglected in the analysis and interpretation of solid state properties. Solvation/desolvation process in the polyoxometallate(POM)&#8211;based Na  9  [Er(W  5  O  18  )  2  ]&#183;35H  2  O SMM demonstrates that the dehydrated form relaxes more than 1000 times faster than the initial state while the rehydration process allows the quasi complete recovering of the initial magnetic behaviour. This dehydration process is monitored by Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA) and temperature dependent X&#8208;ray powder diffraction, and rationalized by periodic quantum chemical calculations evidencing the tremendous role of the labile water molecules in the stability of the edifice. Ab&#8208;initio calculations highlight that sodium ions localization in the structure drive the magnetic responses. Isotopic enrichment with nuclear spin free (  166  Er, I=0) Er  III  ions shows that the relaxation dynamics in the quantum regime depends on the nuclear spin.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;step Chemo&#8208;, Regio&#8208; and Stereoselective Reduction of Ketosteroids to Hydroxysteroids over Zr&#8208;containing MOF&#8208;808 Metal&#8208;organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Zr&#8208;containing MOF&#8208;808 is a very promising heterogeneous catalyst for the selective reduction of ketosteroids to the corresponding hydroxysteroids through a Meerwein&#8208;Ponndorf&#8208;Verley (MPV) reaction. Interestingly, the process leads to the diasteroselective synthesis of elusive 17&#945;&#8208;hydroxy derivatives in one step, while most chemical and biological transformations produce the 17&#946;&#8208;OH compounds, or they require several additional steps to convert 17&#946;&#8208;OH into 17&#945;&#8208;OH by inverting the configuration of the 17 center. Moreover, MOF&#8208;808 is found to be stable and reusable, and it is also chemoselective (only keto groups are reduced, even in the presence of other reducible groups such as C=C bonds) and regioselective (in 3,17&#8208;diketosteroids only the keto group in position 17 is reduced, while the 3&#8208;keto group remains almost intact). Kinetic rate constant and thermodynamic parameters of estrone reduction to estradiol have been obtained by a detailed temperature&#8208;dependent kinetic analysis. The results evidence a major contribution of the entropic term, thus suggesting that the diastereoselectivity of the process is controlled by the confinement of the reaction inside the MOF cavities, where the Zr  4+  active sites are located.</dc:description>

         <title>The Role of Nitrogen&#8208;doping in the Catalytic Transfer Hydrogenation of Phenol to Cyclohexanone with Formic Acid over Pd supported on Carbon Nanotubes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Highly selective one&#8208;step hydrogenation of phenol to cyclohexanone, an important intermediate in the production of nylon 6 and nylon 66, is desirable but remains a challenge. Pd nanoparticles supported on nitrogen&#8208; and oxygen&#8208;functionalized carbon nanotubes (NCNTs, OCNTs) were prepared, characterized, and applied in the hydrogenation of phenol to cyclohexanone to study the effect of N&#8208;doping. Almost full conversion of phenol with high selectivity to cyclohexanone was achieved over Pd/NCNT under mild reaction conditions using either H  2  or formic acid (FA) as a hydrogen source. The effects of reaction temperature and FA/phenol ratio and the reusability were investigated. Separate FA decomposition experiments without and with the addition of phenol were performed to investigate the reaction mechanism, especially the deactivation behavior. Deactivation was observed for both catalysts during the FA decomposition, while only Pd/OCNT rather than Pd/NCNT was deactivated in the transfer hydrogenation with FA and the FA decomposition in the presence of phenol, indicating the unique role of N&#8208;doping. Therefore, we assume that deactivation is caused by the strongly bound formates on the active Pd sites, suppressing further FA decomposition and/or transfer hydrogenation on Pd. The nonplanar adsorption of phenol on NCNTs via weak O&#8212;H&#8943;N interactions enables the occurrence of the subsequent hydrogenation by adsorbed formate on Pd.</dc:description>
