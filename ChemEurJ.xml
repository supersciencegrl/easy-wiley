         <title>Fullerene C70 as Photoredox Catalyst for the Synthesis of Pyrrolo[2,1&#8209;a]isoquinolines via 1,3&#8208;Dipolar Cycloaddition&#8208;Aromatization Sequence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we introduce fullerene (C70) as an effective photoredox catalyst for the construction of a highly functionalised pyrrolo[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinoline framework via 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition&#8208;aromatisation reaction sequence. The ability of C70 to efficiently harvest visible light, its long&#8208;triplet state lifetime, good photostability, and strong singlet oxygen generation potential (&#1060;&#8776;1), make it an efficient photoredox catalyst. Upon photoirradiation, C70 promotes the formation of singlet oxygen and superoxide radical via energy transfer (EnT) and single electron transfer (SET) mechanism, which acts as a potential oxidant in the formation of azomethine ylide through the oxidation&#8208;deprotonation tandem process, which further participates in [3 + 2]&#8208;cycloaddition reaction protocol with alkene/alkyne to give the corresponding pyrrolo[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinolines. Interestingly, this protocol allows the activation of a wide range of substrates giving access to a diverse library of 48 well&#8208;decorated pyrrolo[2,1&#8208;a]isoquinolines with good functional group tolerance.</dc:description>

         <title>Expedient Synthesis of Dihaloalkenynes via Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Haloalkynylation Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, the PdII&#8208;catalyzed construction of functionalized dihaloalkenynes from haloalkynes via a self&#8208;haloalkynylation reaction, without specialized ligands or oxidizing additives, is reported. The method tolerates a diverse range of haloalkynes, including electron&#8208;donating and electron&#8208;withdrawing functional groups, such as macrocyclic alkynols, spiro&#8208;oxy ring alkynols, and even carbazole&#8208;containing, pyrrolidine&#8208;2,5&#8208;dione&#8208;containing and silyl&#8208;protected bromoalkynes. Using an opposite lithium halide (LiX) to the haloalkyne starting material, remarkably high regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity of the haloalkynylation reaction is possible, yielding 1&#8208;bromo&#8208;2&#8208;chloroalkenyne or 2&#8208;bromo&#8208;1&#8208;chloroalkenyne products as desired.</dc:description>

         <title>Chloride&#8208;Free Electrolytes for High&#8208;Voltage Magnesium Metal Batteries: Challenges, Strategies, and Perspectives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 10, February 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A little light on electrolytes: We take a timely and comprehensive look at the criteria for high&#8208;voltage magnesium metal batteries (RMBs) from the viewpoint of high&#8208;voltage chloride&#8208;free electrolytes and the corresponding electrolyte/anode interphase. Potential high&#8208;voltage chloride&#8208;free electrolytes and the corresponding interphase degradation mechanisms are analyzed in depth.







Abstract
The demand for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density and safe energy storage devices has spurred increasing interest in high&#8208;voltage rechargeable magnesium batteries (RMB). As electrolytes are the bridge connecting the cathode and anode materials, the development of high&#8208;voltage electrolytes is the key factor in realizing high&#8208;voltage RMBs. This concept presents an overview of three chloride&#8208;free electrolyte systems with wide electrochemical windows, together with the degradation mechanisms and modification strategies at the anode/electrolyte interphase. Finally, future directions in stabilizing Mg anodes and realizing high&#8208;voltage RMBs are highlighted.

         <title>Emission and Luminescent Vapochromism Control of Octahedral Cu4I4 Complexes by Conformationally Restricted P,N Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 10, February 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The existence of two conformers with &#8220;compact&#8221; and &#8220;stretched&#8221; geometry of Cu4I4 demonstrating green and red emissions was established for the octahedral L2Cu4I4 complex with the conformationally restricted P,N&#8208;ligand. Stretching of the Cu4I4 core provides the drastic change of the emission and might be a reason for the dual emission of the Cu4I4 octahedral complexes.







Abstract
A conformationally restricted P,N&#8208;ligand capable of the design of polynuclear copper(I) complexes was synthesized via the reaction of primary pyridylphosphine, paraformaldehyde, and benzhydrylamine. The reaction of the ligand with copper(I) iodide leads to the tetranuclear copper(I) complex with the octahedral type of copper&#8208;iodide core. Different orientation of coordination bonds of the ligands relative to the P,N2&#8208;heterocyclic fragments and to the Cu4I4 cores leads to the existence of two types of conformers of the complex with &#8220;compact&#8221; or &#8220;stretched&#8221; geometry of the Cu4I4 cluster. This lability of the complex allowed for obtaining two crystalline phases displaying green or red luminescence. The TDDFT computations along with XRD structural analysis gave a strong interpretation of the green emission belonging to the &#8220;compact&#8221; form of the complex and belonging of the red emission to the &#8220;stretched&#8221; form. Moreover, both crystalline phases demonstrate the strong vapochromic responses of luminescence on the vapors of wide range of solvents.

         <title>Nontoxic Artificial Chloride Channel Formation in Epithelial Cells by Isophthalic Acid&#8208;Based Small Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 10, February 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nontoxic Cl&#8722; transport: The work reports two structurally simple isophthalic acid&#8208;based systems that self&#8208;assemble via different intermolecular H&#8208;bonding and &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions to render artificial channels, which facilitate selective translocation of Cl&#8722; ions across liposomes and cells. Interestingly, the transport of Cl&#8722; ions by these ion channels across cell membranes do not exert any toxicity, even at elevated concentrations.







Abstract
Artificial channels capable of facilitating the transport of Cl&#8722; ions across cell membranes while being nontoxic to the cells are rare. Such synthetic ion channels can mimic the functions of membrane transport proteins and, therefore, have the potential to treat channelopathies by replacing defective ion channels. Here we report isophthalic acid&#8208;based structurally simple molecules 1&#8201;a and 2&#8201;a, which self&#8208;assemble to render supramolecular nanochannels that allow selective transport of Cl&#8722; ions. As evident from the single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis, the self&#8208;assembly is governed by intermolecular hydrogen bonding and &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions. The MD simulation studies for both 1&#8201;a and 2&#8201;a confirmed the formation of stable Cl&#8722; channel assembly in the lipid membrane and Cl&#8722; transport through them. The MQAE assay showed the efficacy of the compounds in delivering Cl&#8722; ions into cells, and the MTT assays proved that the compounds are nontoxic to cells even at a concentration of 100&#8197;&#956;M.

As evident from the single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis, the self-assembly is governed by intermolecular hydrogen bonding and &#960;-&#960; stacking interactions. The MD simulation studies for both &lt;b&gt;1&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;2&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt; confirmed the formation of stable Cl&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; channel assembly in the lipid membrane and Cl&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; transport through them. The MQAE assay showed the efficacy of the compounds in delivering Cl&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ions into cells, and the MTT assays proved that the compounds are nontoxic to cells even at a concentration of 100&#8197;&#956;M.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Preparation and Functionalization of Mono&#8208; and Polyfluoroepoxides via Fluoroalkylation of Carbonyl Electrophiles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 10, February 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a new synthetic methodology that allows tandem 1,2&#8208;addition and ring closure reactions between fluoroalkyl anion synthons and carbonyl electrophiles to form fluorinated epoxides. We clarify the generality of the reaction sequence by examining the fluoroalkyl requiremements. This approach enabled access to unique compounds that can be diversified through either ring opening or ring opening defluorinative functionalization reactions.







Abstract
We outline a new synthetic method to prepare mono&#8208; and polyfluoroepoxides from a diverse pool of electrophiles (ketones, acyl chlorides, esters) and fluoroalkyl anion equivalents. The initially formed &#945;&#8208;fluoro alkoxides undergo subsequent intramolecular ring closure when heated. We demonstrated the versatility of the method through the isolation of 16 mono&#8208; and polyfluoroepoxide products. These compounds provide unique entry points for further diversification via either fluoride migration coupled with ring opening, or defluorinative functionalization reactions, the latter of which can be used as a late&#8208;stage method to install select bioactive moieties. The reaction sequences described herein provide a pathway to functionalize the commonly observed products formed from 1,2&#8208;addition into carbonyl electrophiles

         <title>Fast and Cost&#8208;Efficient 17O&#8208;Isotopic Labeling of Carboxylic Groups in Biomolecules: From Free Amino Acids to Peptide Chains</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 10, February 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fast, user&#8208;friendly and cost&#8208;efficient labeling strategies were developed for 17O&#8208;enrichment of free amino acids, Fmoc/tBu&#8208;protected amino acids (produced on 1&#8197;g/day scale) and peptide side&#8208;chains (site&#8208;selective labeling). 17O&#8208;Labeled biomolecules were reproducibly obtained pure, in high synthetic yields (up to 85&#8201;%), and with high enrichment levels (&#8764;40&#8201;%).







Abstract
17O NMR spectroscopy is a powerful technique, which can provide unique information regarding the structure and reactivity of biomolecules. However, the low natural abundance of 17O (0.04&#8201;%) generally requires working with enriched samples, which are not easily accessible. Here, we present simple, fast and cost&#8208;efficient 17O&#8208;enrichment strategies for amino acids and peptides by using mechanochemistry. First, five unprotected amino acids were enriched under ambient conditions, consuming only microliter amounts of costly labeled water, and producing pure molecules with enrichment levels up to &#8764;40&#8201;%, yields &#8764;60&#8208;85&#8201;%, and no loss of optical purity. Subsequently, 17O&#8208;enriched Fmoc/tBu&#8208;protected amino acids were produced on a 1&#8197;g/day scale with high enrichment levels. Lastly, a site&#8208;selective 17O&#8208;labeling of carboxylic functions in peptide side&#8208;chains was achieved for RGD and GRGDS peptides, with &#8764;28&#8201;% enrichment level. For all molecules, 17O ssNMR spectra were recorded at 14.1 T in reasonable times, making this an important step forward for future NMR studies of biomolecules.

         <title>Substituent Effects in Iron Porphyrin Catalysts for the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 10, February 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The comparison of differently substituted iron porphyrins in their as&#8208;prepared state and after immobilization on carbon indicates no or only a weak interaction with the carbon support. Hydrogen evolution catalysis of the supported systems is improved by electron donating groups that destabilize an Fe(II) intermediate, presumably by assisting in the formation of a radical anion.







Abstract
For a future hydrogen economy, non&#8208;precious metal catalysts for the water splitting reactions are needed that can be implemented on a global scale. Metal&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;carbon (MNC) catalysts with active sites constituting a metal center with fourfold coordination of nitrogen (MN4) show promising performance, but an optimization rooted in structure&#8208;property relationships has been hampered by their low structural definition. Porphyrin model complexes are studied to transfer insights from well&#8208;defined molecules to MNC systems. This work combines experiment and theory to evaluate the influence of porphyrin substituents on the electronic and electrocatalytic properties of MN4 centers with respect to the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in aqueous electrolyte. We found that the choice of substituent affects their utilization on the carbon support and their electrocatalytic performance. We propose an HER mechanism for supported iron porphyrin complexes involving a [FeII(P&#8901;)]&#8722; radical anion intermediate, in which a porphinic nitrogen atom acts as an internal base. While this work focuses on the HER, the limited influence of a simultaneous interaction with the support and an aqueous electrolyte will likely be transferrable to other catalytic applications.

         <title>Preorganized Polyaromatic Soft Terdentate Hosts for the Capture of [Ln(&#946;&#8208;diketonate)3] Guests in Solution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 10, February 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
For its binding to the La(hfac)3 lanthanum container, the benzimidazole side arms of the terdentate ligand L1 must rotate to reach the cis&#8208;cis arrangement required for the formation of the heteroleptic [L1La(hfac)3] complex. The novel rigid, planar and cis&#8208;cis preorganized ligand L8 avoids this energy penalty and increases the overall stability of the final [L8La(hfac)3] complex by three orders of magnitude.







Abstract
The concept of preorganization is famous in coordination chemistry for having transformed flexible bidentate 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine scaffolds into rigid 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline platforms. The resulting boosted affinities for d&#8208;block cations has successfully paved the way for the design of a wealth of functional complexes, devices and materials for analysis and optics. Its extension toward terdentate homologues adapted for the selective complexation of f&#8208;block cations with larger coordination numbers remains more overlooked. The resulting rigidification of 2,6&#8208;bis(1&#8208;methyl&#8208;1H&#8208;benzo[d]imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)pyridine ligands (L1&#8211;L7) produces the highly preorganized and extended polyaromatic benzo[4&#8242;,5&#8242;]imidazo[1&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8201;:&#8201;1,2]pyrido[3,4&#8208;b]benzo[4,5]imidazo[1,2&#8208;h][1,7]naphthyridines (L8&#8211;L11) receptors, which offer some novel and rare opportunities for efficiently complexing trivalent lanthanides with polyaromatic soft terimine ligands. The crystal structures of the stable heteroleptic [LkLn(hfac)3] adducts (Lk=L1, L8, L9; Ln=La, Eu, Gd, Er, Yb, Y; H&#8208;hfac=1,1,1,5,5,5&#8208;hexafluoropentane&#8208;2,4&#8208;dione) show a drastic decrease in the Ln&#8722;N bond valences upon replacement of the flexible ligand L1 with its preorganized counterparts L8 and L9. This points to a limited match between the preorganized cavity and the entering [Ln(hfac)3] lanthanide containers. However, thermodynamic studies conducted in dichloromethane reach the opposite conclusion, with an improved affinity, by up to three orders of magnitude for catching Ln(hfac)3 when L1 is replaced by the preorganized L8&#8211;L9 receptors. The key to the enigma lies in the removal of the energy penalty which accompanies the formation of flexible [L1Ln(hfac)3] complexes in solution. This driving force overcomes the poor match between the preorganized terdentate N&#8745;N&#8745;N cavity in L8 and L9 and the size of trivalent lanthanides. As planned, the rigid, planar and extended &#960;&#8208;conjugated system found in L8 and L9 shifts the ligand&#8208;centered absorption bands by about 5000&#8197;cm&#8722;1 toward lower energies, a crucial point if these stable [L8Ln(hfac)3] and [L9Ln(hfac)3] platforms have to be considered for the visible sensitization of luminescent lanthanides in metallopolymers.

The resulting rigidification of 2,6-bis(1-methyl-1&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-benzo[d]imidazol-2-yl)pyridine ligands (&lt;b&gt;L1&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;L7&lt;/b&gt;) produces the highly preorganized and extended polyaromatic benzo[4&#8242;,5&#8242;]imidazo[1&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8201;:&#8201;1,2]pyrido[3,4-b]benzo[4,5]imidazo[1,2-h][1,7]naphthyridines (&lt;b&gt;L8&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;L11&lt;/b&gt;) receptors, which offer some novel and rare opportunities for efficiently complexing trivalent lanthanides with polyaromatic soft terimine ligands. The crystal structures of the stable heteroleptic [&lt;b&gt;L&lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;Ln(hfac)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;] adducts (&lt;b&gt;L&lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;=&lt;b&gt;L1&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;L8&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;L9&lt;/b&gt;; Ln=La, Eu, Gd, Er, Yb, Y; H-hfac=1,1,1,5,5,5-hexafluoropentane-2,4-dione) show a drastic decrease in the Ln&#8722;N bond valences upon replacement of the flexible ligand &lt;b&gt;L1&lt;/b&gt; with its preorganized counterparts &lt;b&gt;L8&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;L9&lt;/b&gt;. This points to a limited match between the preorganized cavity and the entering [Ln(hfac)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;] lanthanide containers. However, thermodynamic studies conducted in dichloromethane reach the opposite conclusion, with an improved affinity, by up to three orders of magnitude for catching Ln(hfac)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; when &lt;b&gt;L1&lt;/b&gt; is replaced by the preorganized &lt;b&gt;L8&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;L9&lt;/b&gt; receptors. The key to the enigma lies in the removal of the energy penalty which accompanies the formation of flexible [&lt;b&gt;L1&lt;/b&gt;Ln(hfac)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;] complexes in solution. This driving force overcomes the poor match between the preorganized terdentate N&lt;sup&gt;&#8745;&lt;/sup&gt;N&lt;sup&gt;&#8745;&lt;/sup&gt;N cavity in &lt;b&gt;L8&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;L9&lt;/b&gt; and the size of trivalent lanthanides. As planned, the rigid, planar and extended &#960;-conjugated system found in &lt;b&gt;L8&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;L9&lt;/b&gt; shifts the ligand-centered absorption bands by about 5000&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; toward lower energies, a crucial point if these stable [&lt;b&gt;L8&lt;/b&gt;Ln(hfac)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;] and [&lt;b&gt;L9&lt;/b&gt;Ln(hfac)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;] platforms have to be considered for the visible sensitization of luminescent lanthanides in metallopolymers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Fluorescence Turn&#8208;on of Tetraphenylethylene Derivative by Transfer from Cyclodextrin to Liposomes, HeLa Cells, and E. coli</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 10, February 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
It's fluorescence time! Although the tetraphenylethylene derivative (TPE&#8722;OH4) was fluorescence OFF state in &#947;&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#947;&#8208;CDx), the fluorescence turn&#8208;on was observed in the liposomes, HeLa cells, and E. coli, because TPE&#8722;OH4 was transferred from the &#947;&#8208;CDx cavity to the lipid or cell membranes.







Abstract
Herein, trimethyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (TMe&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CDx) and &#947;&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#947;&#8208;CDx) could dissolve a tetraphenylethylene derivative (TPE&#8722;OH4) in water through high&#8208;speed vibration milling. The fluorescence intensity of the TMe&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CDx&#8722;TPE&#8722;OH4 complex was much higher than that of the &#947;&#8208;CDx&#8722;TPE&#8722;OH4 complex, as the rotation of the central C=C double bond of TPE&#8722;OH4 after photoactivation was inhibited in a smaller TMe&#8208;&#946;&#8208;CDx cavity in comparison with the &#947;&#8208;CDx cavity. In contrast, the fluorescence intensity of the &#947;&#8208;CDx&#8722;TPE&#8722;OH4 complex was very weak; nevertheless, it increased after the addition of liposomes due to the transfer of TPE&#8722;OH4 from the &#947;&#8208;CDx cavity to the lipid membrane as a &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; phenomenon. Furthermore, to apply temperature sensor, it was demonstrated that the fluorescence intensity in the liposomes depended on the phase&#8208;transition temperature. By using the fluorescence turn&#8208;on phenomenon, TPE&#8722;OH4 could detect the presence of HeLa cells and E. coli by fluorescence.

         <title>C&#8208;Terminal Lipidation of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Fusion Peptide Reinstates Superior Membrane Fusion Catalytic Ability</title>

Making a link: C&#8208;Terminal myristoylation of fusion peptide restores the fusion&#8208;catalytic role of fusion peptide (FP). The lipid linker might restrict the localization of the C&#8197;terminus of the FP at the interface, assist the free dive of the N&#8197;terminus of the fusion peptide to the membrane, and bridge the viral membrane and host membrane through plasticity to promote the fusion.







Abstract
The spike (S) protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome&#8208;associated coronavirus&#8208;2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2) mediates a critical stage in infection, the fusion between viral and host membranes. The protein is categorized as a class&#8197;I viral fusion protein and has two distinct cleavage sites that can be activated by proteases. The activation deploys the fusion peptide (FP) for insertion into the target cell membranes. Recent studies including our experiments showed that the FP was unable to modulate the kinetics of fusion at a low peptide&#8208;to&#8208;lipid ratio akin to the spike density at the viral surface. Therefore, we modified the C&#8197;terminus of FP and attached a myristoyl chain (C&#8208;myr&#8208;FP) to restrict the C&#8197;terminus near to the interface, bridge both membranes, and increase the effective local concentration. The lipidated FP (C&#8208;myr&#8208;FP) of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 greatly accelerates membrane fusion at a low peptide&#8208;to&#8208;lipid ratio as compared to the FP with no lipidation. Biophysical experiments suggest that C&#8208;myr&#8208;FP adopts a helical structure, perturbs the membrane interface, and increases water penetration to catalyze fusion. Scrambled peptide (C&#8208;myr&#8208;sFP) and truncated peptide (C&#8208;myr&#8208;8FP) could not significantly catalyze the fusion, thus suggesting the important role of myristoylation and the N&#8197;terminus. C&#8208;myr&#8208;FP enhances murine coronavirus infection by promoting syncytia formation in L2 cells. The C&#8208;terminal lipidation of the FP might be a useful strategy to induce artificial fusion in biomedical applications.

The protein is categorized as a class&#8197;I viral fusion protein and has two distinct cleavage sites that can be activated by proteases. The activation deploys the fusion peptide (FP) for insertion into the target cell membranes. Recent studies including our experiments showed that the FP was unable to modulate the kinetics of fusion at a low peptide-to-lipid ratio akin to the spike density at the viral surface. Therefore, we modified the C&#8197;terminus of FP and attached a myristoyl chain (C-myr-FP) to restrict the C&#8197;terminus near to the interface, bridge both membranes, and increase the effective local concentration. The lipidated FP (C-myr-FP) of SARS-CoV-2 greatly accelerates membrane fusion at a low peptide-to-lipid ratio as compared to the FP with no lipidation.

Two switches, three components, quadruple switchability: Tying together two types of anionic molecular switches with cationic macroions by self&#8208;assembly in an aqueous solution results in stable nano&#8208;objects, the size and shape of which can be changed by irradiation with two wavelengths, pH alteration, and darkness.







Abstract
Multi&#8208;switchable supramolecular nano&#8208;objects that respond to irradiation of different wavelengths with changes in size and shape have been built from two different water&#8208;soluble molecular switches, joined by attachment to the same polyelectrolyte. Accordingly, two wavelength&#8208;specific reactions, namely the excited&#8208;state proton dissociation of a photoacid and the cis&#8211;trans isomerization of an azo dye, are combined in one supramolecular nano&#8208;object that is stable in aqueous solution. The concept has potential in the fields of sensors, molecular motors, and transport.

         <title>Disproportionation and Ligand Lability in Low Oxidation State Boryl&#8208;Tin Chemistry
</title>

The carbene&#8208;stabilized distannyne and donor&#8208;free distannide systems (boryl)SnSn(IPrMe)(boryl) and K2[Sn2(boryl)2], can be synthesized from (boryl)Sn(NHC)Br using Mg(I) or K reducing agents. In contrast to their germanium congeners, systems of the type [Sn(boryl)]n are unstable with respect to disproportionation: NHC abstraction from (boryl)SnSn(IPrMe)(boryl) and 2&#8208;electron oxidation of K2[Sn2(boryl)2] both yield a 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 mixture of Sn(boryl)2 and the hexatin cluster, Sn6(boryl)4. A viable mechanism for this rearrangement is shown by quantum chemical studies to involve the vinylidene&#8208;type intermediate (boryl)2Sn=Sn.







Abstract
Boryltin compounds featuring the metal in the+1 or 0 oxidation states can be synthesized from the carbene&#8208;stabilized tin(II) bromide (boryl)Sn(NHC)Br (boryl={B(NDippCH)2}; NHC=C{(NiPrCMe)2}) by the use of strong reducing agents. The formation of the mono&#8208;carbene stabilized distannyne and donor&#8208;free distannide systems (boryl)SnSn(IPrMe)(boryl) (2) and K2[Sn2(boryl)2] (3), using Mg(I) and K reducing agents mirrors related germanium chemistry. In contrast to their lighter congeners, however, systems of the type [Sn(boryl)]n are unstable with respect to disproportionation. Carbene abstraction from 2 using BPh3, and two&#8208;electron oxidation of 3 both result in the formation of a 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 mixture of the Sn(II) compound Sn(boryl)2, and the hexatin cluster, Sn6(boryl)4 (4). A viable mechanism for this rearrangement is shown by quantum chemical studies to involve a vinylidene intermediate (analogous to the isolable germanium compound, (boryl)2Ge=Ge), which undergoes facile atom transfer to generate Sn(boryl)2 and trinuclear [Sn3(boryl)2]. The latter then dimerizes to give the observed hexametallic product 4, with independent studies showing that similar trigermanium species aggregate in analogous fashion.

         <title>Hydrogenation Reactions with Synergistic Catalysis of Pd single atoms and nanoparticles under Near&#8208;Ambient Conditions</title>

Synthesis of a synergistic catalyst of Pd single atoms and Pd nanoparticles is presented, which shows broad catalytic activity towards hydrogenation of organic nitro molecules and functional aromatics.







Abstract
Due to the limited resources and high cost of noble metals, boosting their catalytic activities is highly desired in the current catalysis industry. Here, we report a synergetic catalyst, combining Pd2+ and Pd0 species in a nitrogen&#8208;doped porous carbons (NPC), which shows boosted catalytic activities in hydrogenation reactions of organic nitro compounds (nitrobenzene, 4&#8208;nitrophenol, 1&#8208;nitronaphthalene and 1&#8208;nitropropane) under near ambient conditions. This synergetic catalyst NPC&#8208;[Pd] was synthesized by partial reduction of a palladium&#8208;loaded NPC. The catalytic activities and selectivity of NPC&#8208;[Pd] for hydrogenation were enhanced significantly compared with those of NPC&#8208;Pd2+ or NPC&#8208;Pd0 nanoparticles. Theoretical calculations show that H2 preferentially dissociates on Pd nanoparticles, and then organic molecules (nitrobenzene) can be captured and react with the dissociated H atom on Pd2+ sites. Similar reaction procedure also occur on Pt or Rh. Hydrogenation of different aromatic compounds with different functional groups (naphthalene, 4&#8208;nitrochlorobenzene, benzaldehyde and acetophenone) confirmed the broad excellent catalytic activity of this synergistic catalyst.

         <title>Edge&#8208;Decorated Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons by an Oxidative Coupling Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 10, February 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alkoxy highly edge&#8208;decorated polycylic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) have been formed. Oxidative cross coupling of phenols constructs frameworks without any need for the prefunctionalization required by conventional methods. Moreover, smaller optical gaps can be achieved relative to systems of similar size.







Abstract
Oxidative phenol coupling reduces reliance on halo/metalated substrates used in conventional redox neutral couplings. A new strategy for constructing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) that incorporates oxidative phenol coupling is outlined in a three&#8208;stage approach: oxidative fragment coupling, linking of the two resultant units, and oxidative cyclization. The protocol allows rapid assembly of both planar and helical systems with a high degree of edge functionalization. The incorporation of 12 alkoxy groups on systems with 12 rings gave rise to lower optical gaps compared to systems with a lesser degree of edge functionalization.

         <title>One Carbon Ring Expansion of Bipyrrole to Bipyridine Enables Access to a &#960;&#8208;Extended, Non&#8208;innocent, Corrole&#8208;like Ligand</title>

Diazatriphenylene was synthesized by a double, one&#8208;carbon&#8208;insertion reaction. Following elaboration, this key precursor allowed access to an unprecedented NiII&#8208;bipyricorrole radical and a cationic square planar complex upon one&#8208;electron oxidation.







Abstract
A &#960;&#8208;extended, diaza&#8208;triphenylene embedded, mono&#8208;anionic corrole analogue and its NiII complex were synthesized from a diaza&#8208;triphenylene precursor, which was obtained from a double one&#8208;carbon insertion into a naphthobipyrrole diester. Following conversion to the corresponding activated diol and acid&#8208;catalyzed condensation with pyrrole, subsequent reaction with pentafluorobenzaldehyde afforded mono&#8208;anionic, &#960;&#8208;extended bipyricorrole&#8208;like macrocycle. Attempted NiII insertion with Ni(OAc)2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;4H2O resulted an ESR active, NiII bipyricorrole radical complex, which was converted to a stable cationic NiII complex upon treatment with [(Et3O)+(SbCl6)&#8722;]. Both complexes were characterized by 1H and 13C&#8197;NMR, UV/Vis spectroscopy and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. The NiII bipyricorrole radical complex is converted to a cationic NiII complex by single&#8208;electron reduction using cobaltocene. Both the cationic NiII complex and the radical NiII complex exhibited ligand&#8208;centered redox behavior, whereas the NiII remains in the +2 oxidation state.

         <title>Boron&#8208;Mediated Regioselective Aromatic C&#8722;H Functionalization via an Aryl BF2 Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 10, February 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Regioselective functionalization of 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;azaarenes N&#8208;heteroarenes and aryl aldehydes has been achieved. The reaction proceeds via a BBr3 promoted 5 and 6&#8208;membered boracycle that undergoes a ligand exchange promoted by Selectfluor to give a previously scarce aryl BF2 species. The aryl BF2 is a bench stable intermediate that can be used for the deborylative functionalization of the 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;azaarenes scaffold.







Abstract
An efficient regioselective functionalization of 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;heteroarenes and aryl aldehydes via an azaaryl BF2 complex has been developed. Mechanistically the reaction comprises fluoride to bromide ligand exchange on an aryl boron species and consecutive C&#8722;B bond cleavage to deliver a broad range of functionalized products. The reaction is high yielding, has a broad substrate scope where several different heteroarenes can be functionalized with chloro, bromo, iodo, hydroxyl, amine and BF2 in a highly regioselective fashion. The method can be applied for late&#8208;stage functionalization or for rapid skeleton remodeling with for instance cross&#8208;couplings.

The reaction proceeds via a BBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; promoted 5 and 6-membered boracycle that undergoes a ligand exchange promoted by Selectfluor to give a previously scarce aryl BF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; species. The aryl BF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is a bench stable intermediate that can be used for the deborylative functionalization of the 2-aryl-azaarenes scaffold.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An efficient regioselective functionalization of 2-aryl-heteroarenes and aryl aldehydes via an azaaryl BF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; complex has been developed. Mechanistically the reaction comprises fluoride to bromide ligand exchange on an aryl boron species and consecutive C&#8722;B bond cleavage to deliver a broad range of functionalized products. The reaction is high yielding, has a broad substrate scope where several different heteroarenes can be functionalized with chloro, bromo, iodo, hydroxyl, amine and BF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in a highly regioselective fashion. The method can be applied for late-stage functionalization or for rapid skeleton remodeling with for instance cross-couplings.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Primary resource: Hypervalent iodine&#8208;based aminating reagents containing a transferable (diarylmethylene)amino group can be used for the &#945;&#8208;amination of simple carbonyl compounds such as esters, amides, and ketones in the presence of a lithium base. The (diarylmethylene)amino groups of the products can be readily modified, thus providing access to primary amines and diarylmethylamines.







Abstract
Hypervalent iodine&#8208;based aminating reagents containing a transferable (diarylmethylene)amino group can be used for the &#945;&#8208;amination of simple carbonyl compounds such as esters, amides, and ketones in the presence of a lithium base. The (diarylmethylene)amino groups of the products can be readily modified, thus providing access to primary amines and diarylmethylamines. The developed method features transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free conditions and a simple one&#8208;pot procedure without the need to prepare enolate equivalents separately, thus offering a general and practical approach to the synthesis of a wide variety of &#945;&#8208;amino carbonyl compounds. Experimental mechanistic investigations indicate that this amination proceeds through a unique radical coupling of an &#945;&#8208;carbonyl radical with an iminyl radical; they are generated through a single&#8208;electron transfer between a lithium enolate and the hypervalent iodine reagent.

A warm welcome for a WLED: The synthesis of single&#8208;component phosphor, tetrabutylammonium copper halides, with dual broad&#8208;band emission (494 and 654&#8197;nm), high photoluminescent (PL) quantum yield (93.7&#8201;%) and large Stokes shift (150&#8197;nm) is reported. The resulting diodes emitted white light with a high color rendering index of 89 and correlated color temperature (CCT) of 4516&#8197;K.







Abstract
In order to achieve a high color&#8208;rendering index (CRI) and low correlated color temperature (CCT) indoor lighting, single&#8208;component phosphors with broad&#8208;band dual emission are in high demand for white&#8208;light&#8208;emitting diodes (WLEDs). However, phosphors with such fluorescent properties are rare at present. Herein, we report a facile solid&#8208;state chemical method for the synthesis of single&#8208;component phosphor with broad&#8208;band emission and a large Stokes shift that can meet the requirements of future white&#8208;light sources. These new tetrabutylammonium copper halides phosphors have excellent warm white emission characteristics, and their luminescence peaks are located at 494 and 654&#8197;nm. The optimized photoluminescence (PL) quantum yield can reach 93.7&#8201;%. The typical CIE coordinate of the as&#8208;fabricated WLED is at (0.3620, 0.3731) with a CRI of 89 and low CCT of 4516&#8197;K.

         <title>A Foldable Aqueous Zn&#8208;Ion Battery with Gear&#8208;Structured Composite as Freestanding Cathode</title>

Gearing up for portable devices: A flexible, self&#8208;healing Zn&#8208;ion battery uses a freestanding cathode that is composed of a 3D gear&#8208;like NH4V4O10@C composite on carbon paper. The battery retained a capacity of over 102.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after being folded 60 times with a high angle of 180&#176;, and a better capacity retention of &gt;100&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 after cutting and twisting to 90&#176;. The highly flexible, safe, aqueous Zn&#8208;ion battery opens up a practical way to power various carry&#8208;on electronic devices.







Abstract
A foldable battery with high flexibility provides great potential in various wearable electronic devices for health and fitness tracking, chronic disease management, performance monitoring, navigation tracking, and portable gears for soldiers. We report a highly flexible, self&#8208;healing Zn&#8208;ion battery with a free&#8208;standing cathode that is composed of a 3D gear&#8208;like NH4V4O10@C composite on carbon paper. The battery retained a capacity of up to 102.4&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 even after being folded 60 times with a high angle of 180&#176;. An aqueous hydrogel consisting polyvinyl alcohol, glycerin and Zn(CF3SO3)2 was used as electrolyte, which showed as high as 580&#8201;% tensile strain under a loading weight of 78&#8197;N. The battery exhibited a better capacity retention of over 100&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 and Coulombic efficiency of over 99.8&#8201;% after cutting and twisting to 90&#176;, thereby indicating a great self&#8208;healing performance. The gear&#8208;like geometry greatly improved the volume accommodation due to the increased interval space between the blades and the outward configuration. Meanwhile the Zn2+ ionic conductivity was improved by rapid re&#8208;binding of many existing hydroxy groups from the electrolyte and the enhanced contact surface area and diffusion route from the cathode material. The highly flexible, safe aqueous Zn&#8208;ion battery opens a practical way to power various carry&#8208;on electronics under mechanical agitation.

A highly efficient catalytic asymmetric Rubottom&#8208;type oxidation is described. Using meta&#8208;chloroperbenzoic acid (m&#8208;CPBA) as the oxidant and chiral calcium phosphate as the catalyst, the facile transformation enables direct hydroxylation of N&#8208;Boc oxindoles and &#946;&#8208;ketoesters in high yields (up to 99&#8201;%) and in a highly enantioenriched fashion (up to &gt;99&#8201;% ee).

         <title>Crystallographic Deciphering of Spontaneous Self&#8208;Assembly of Achiral Calciphores to Chiral Complexes</title>

By manipulating a metal&#8208;deprivation strategy, a new skeleton of thiazolyl&#8208;pyridine natural product (thiapyricins) with calcium&#8208;binding property was discovered from metal&#8208;tolerant extremophile, Saccharothrix sp. TRM_47004. Their characteristic co&#8208;occurrence in the &#916;/&#923;&#8208;form of octahedral chirality visualizes achiral natural products assemble into chiral complexes.







Abstract
Thiapyricins (TPC&#8208;A/B, 1 and 2), which are new metallophore scaffolds exhibiting selective divalent cation binding property, were produced in response to metal&#8208;deprived conditions by Saccharothrix sp. TRM_47004 isolated from the Lop Nor Salt Lake. TPCs represent a thiazolyl&#8208;pyridine skeleton of a calcium&#8208;binding natural product, calciphore, owing to the selectivity to calcium ions among diverse metal ions. The thiapyricins exhibited notable co&#8208;crystalline characteristics of the apo&#8208; and holo&#8208;forms with racemic enantiomers comprising a pair of space isomers in a &#916;/&#923;&#8208;form. Therefore, we postulated a mechanism for the four&#8208;hierarchical self&#8208;assembly of achiral natural products into chiral complexes. Furthermore, their metal&#8208;chelating trait aided the adaptation of the host during metal starvation by increasing the production of TPCs. This study presents a structural paradigm of a new calciphore, provides insight into the mechanism of natural product assembly, and highlights the causality between the production of the metallophore and metallic habitats.

         <title>Energy Level, Crystal Morphology and Fluorescence Emission Tuning in Cocrystals via Molecular&#8208;Level Engineering</title>

New DCAF based charge transfer cocrystals with tunable energy level, crystal morphology and fluorescence emission were prepared via a cocrystal engineering method.







Abstract
Organic donor&#8208;acceptor complexes as new organic semiconductor class have attracted wide attention, due to their potential applications in functional optoelectronics. Herein, we present two new charge transfer cocrystals of di&#8208;cyanodiazafluorene &#8208;perylene (DCPE) and di&#8208;cyanodiazaflfluorene&#8208;pyrene (DCPY) through a rational cocrystal&#8208;engineering strategy. Although they are both 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 mixed stacking cocrystals with similar chemical structures, the DCPE cocrystal possesses a non&#8208;centrosymmetric space group and narrower band gap compared to DCPY cocrystal, because of the non&#8208;covalent bonding variation. The electrostatic potential accumulated in the lateral facets leads to highly twisted DCPE nanobelts, and the small band gap causes near infrared fluorescence. Meanwhile, the DCPY crystals with centrosymmetric space groups and weaker intermolecular interactions exhibited an untwisted morphology and red emission. This study will be helpful for the design and understanding of functional cocrystal materials that can be used in flexible micro/nano&#8208;mechanics, mechanical energy, and optical devices.

Diastereoisomer separation: Through the use of a well&#8208;defined enantiopure &#960;&#8208;allylic ruthenium(IV) precatalyst, facile access to enantioenriched indolin&#8208;3&#8208;one emitters was achieved. Facile separation of diastereoisomers demonstrated mirror image chiroptical responses.







Abstract
A novel enantiopure &#960;&#8208;allylruthenium(IV) precatalyst allowed the enantioselective and stereospecific allylations of indoles and gave access to indolin&#8208;3&#8208;ones, containing vicinal stereogenic centers. Facile separation of diastereoisomers exhibiting opposite circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) activities in diverse solvents, including water, demonstrated the potential of these sustainable transformations and of the newly prepared molecules.

         <title>Harnessing the CRISPR&#8208;Cas13d System for Protein Detection by Dual&#8208;Aptamer&#8208;Based Transcription Amplification</title>

Transcriptional immuno&#8208;CRISPR: A target&#8208;responsive CRISPR&#8208;Cas13d sensing system for proteins was rationally designed by dual&#8208;aptamer&#8208;based target recognition and binding&#8208;induced in&#8208;vitro transcription to trigger Cas13d&#8208;mediated signal amplification. Such a dual recognition/amplification mode enables protein detection with high specificity and sensitivity, expanding CRISPR&#8208;Cas13d diagnostic toolbox significantly.







Abstract
CRISPR&#8208;based biosensing technology has been emerging as a revolutionary diagnostic tool for many disease&#8208;related biomarkers. In particular, RspCas13d, a newly identified RNA&#8208;guided Cas13d ribonuclease derived from Ruminococcus sp., has shown great promise for accurate and sensitive detection of RNA due to its RNA sequence&#8208;specific recognition and robust collateral trans&#8208;cleavage activity. However, its diagnostic utility is limited to detecting nucleic&#8208;acid&#8208;related biomarkers. To address this limitation, herein we present a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration of a target&#8208;responsive CRISPR&#8208;Cas13d sensing system for protein biomarkers. This system was rationally designed by integrating a dual&#8208;aptamer&#8208;based transcription amplification strategy with CRISPR&#8208;Cas13d (DATAS&#8208;Cas13d), in which the protein binding initiates in&#8208;vitro RNA transcription followed by the activation of RspCas13d. Using a short fluorescent ssRNA as the signal reporter and cardiac troponin I (cTnI) as the model analyte, the DATAS&#8208;Cas13d system showed a wide linear range, low detection limit, and high specificity for the detection of cTnI in buffer and human serum. Thanks to the facile integration of various bioreceptors into the DATAS&#8208;Cas13d system, the method could be adapted to detecting a broad range of clinically relevant protein biomarkers, and thus broaden the medical applications of Cas13d&#8208;based diagnostics.

         <title>Proton&#8208;Induced Defect&#8208;Rich Vanadium Oxides as Reversible Polysulfide Conversion Sites for High&#8208;Performance Lithium Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 10, February 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Decreasing dissolution: A defect&#8208;rich sodium vanadium oxide with a proton doping nanobelt was fabricated and used as the functional interface layer in Li&#8208;S batteries. Benefiting from the abundant defects and catalytic activity, the dissolution of polysulfide was greatly decreased. The graphene layer contributes to accelerating the charge carrier. Therefore, the design of the electrode/separator interface layer is beneficial for achieving high&#8208;performance Li&#8208;S batteries.







Abstract
Lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries have attracted attention due to their high theoretical energy density, natural abundance, and low cost. However, the diffusion of polysulfides decreases the utilization and further degrades the battery's life. We have successfully fabricated a defect&#8208;rich layered sodium vanadium oxide with proton doping (HNVO) nanobelt and used it as the functional interface layer on the separator in Li&#8208;S batteries. Benefiting from the abundant defects of NVO and the catalytic activity of metal vanadium in the electrochemical process, the shuttle of polysulfides was greatly decreased by reversible chemical adsorption. Moreover, the extra graphene layer contributes to accelerating the charge carrier at high current densities. Therefore, a Li&#8208;S battery with G@HNVO delivers a high capacity of 1494.8&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.2&#8197;C and a superior cycling stability over 700 cycles at 1&#8197;C. This work provides an effective strategy for designing the electrode/separator interface layer to achieve high&#8208;performance Li&#8208;S batteries.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Decreasing dissolution&lt;/b&gt;: A defect-rich sodium vanadium oxide with a proton doping nanobelt was fabricated and used as the functional interface layer in Li-S batteries. Benefiting from the abundant defects and catalytic activity, the dissolution of polysulfide was greatly decreased. The graphene layer contributes to accelerating the charge carrier. Therefore, the design of the electrode/separator interface layer is beneficial for achieving high-performance Li-S batteries.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries have attracted attention due to their high theoretical energy density, natural abundance, and low cost. However, the diffusion of polysulfides decreases the utilization and further degrades the battery's life. We have successfully fabricated a defect-rich layered sodium vanadium oxide with proton doping (HNVO) nanobelt and used it as the functional interface layer on the separator in Li-S batteries. Benefiting from the abundant defects of NVO and the catalytic activity of metal vanadium in the electrochemical process, the shuttle of polysulfides was greatly decreased by reversible chemical adsorption. Moreover, the extra graphene layer contributes to accelerating the charge carrier at high current densities. Therefore, a Li-S battery with G@HNVO delivers a high capacity of 1494.8&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.2&#8197;C and a superior cycling stability over 700 cycles at 1&#8197;C. This work provides an effective strategy for designing the electrode/separator interface layer to achieve high-performance Li-S batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Acceleration Effect of Bowl&#8208;Shaped Structure in Aerobic Oxidation Reaction: Synthesis of Homosumanene ortho&#8208;Quinone and Azaacene&#8208;Fused Homosumanenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 10, February 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intrinsic strain in the molecule considerably accelerates the oxidation rate of peripheral carbons in aromatic compounds. The aerobic oxidation of hydroxyhomosumanene proceeds much faster than for the planar analogue because of their unusual keto&#8208;enol tautomerization caused by the curved structure. The homosumanene ortho&#8208;quinone was converted to several azaacene&#8208;fused homosumanenes, and their crystal structures, photophysical properties, and charge transport properties were investigated.







Abstract
An oxidation reaction of hydroxyhomosumanene on silica gel providing homosumanene ortho&#8208;quinone and its synthetic application for azaacene&#8208;fused homosumanenes is described. Hydroxyhomosumanene is photochemically oxidized by air, when it is coated on silica gel; this aerobic oxidation proceeds faster than that of planar analogues. The difference of such reactivity was attributed to the unusual keto&#8208;enol tautomerization due to structural difference between planar and curved &#960;&#8208;system. The homosumanene ortho&#8208;quinone was used in the synthesis of several azaacene&#8208;fused homosumanenes, azaacenohomosumanenes. X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis of the single crystals revealed their columnar stacking structures due to the interactions between each bowl. Azaacenohomosumanenes exhibited high electron affinity due to the combination of buckybowl and electron&#8208;deficient azaacene moieties.

         <title>Controlled Formation of Porous 2D Lattices from C3&#8208;symmetric Ph6&#8722;Me&#8208;Tribenzotriquinacene&#8208;OAc3</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 10, February 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
STM investigation of temperature&#8208;controlled deposition of hexaphenyl&#8208;methyltribenzotriquinacene with thermolabile acetate groups revealed highly ordered coverage and temperature dependent self&#8208;assembly of this C3 symmetric structure. At higher temperature the structure flattens and interacts strongly with the metal substrate due to loss of all acetate groups and the methyl groups resulting in an unsaturated triquinacene core.







Abstract
The on&#8208;surface self&#8208;assembly of molecules to form holey nanographenes is a promising approach to control the properties of the resulting 2D lattice. Usually, planar molecules are utilized to prepare flat, structurally confined molecular layers, with only a few recent examples of warped precursors. However, control of the superstructures is limited thus far. Herein, we report the temperature&#8208;controlled self&#8208;assembly of a bowl&#8208;shaped, acetylated C3&#8208;symmetric hexaphenyltribenzotriquinacene derivative on Cu(111). Combining scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and density functional theory (DFT) confirms the formation of highly differing arrangements starting with &#960;&#8208;stacked bowl&#8208;to&#8208;bowl dimers at low coverage at room temperature via chiral honeycomb structures, an intermediate trigonal superstructure, followed by a fully carbon&#8208;based, flattened hexagonal superstructure formed by on&#8208;surface deacetylation, which is proposed as a precursor for holey graphene networks with unique defect structures.

         <dc:description>
Hypervalent iodine&#8208;based aminating reagents containing a transferable (diarylmethylene)amino group can be used for the &#945;&#8208;amination of simple carbonyl compounds such as esters, amides, and ketones in the presence of a lithium base. A snapshot of the unique coupling of an &#945;&#8208;carbonyl radical with an iminyl radical in this amination is given by the motif of spacecraft docking with a space station.

Recent advances in long&#8208;wavelength light&#8208;emitting electrochemical cells (LECs) are reviewed from the perspectives of materials, including ionic transition metal complexes, small molecules, conjugated polymers, and perovskites, as well as device engineering. Device engineering techniques, including spectral modification by adjusting the microcavity effect, and light outcoupling enhancement, are also discussed. This review aims to pave the way for researchers to design materials and device engineering techniques for long&#8208;wavelength LECs in the applications of displays, bio&#8208;imaging, telecommunication, and night&#8208;vision displays.







Abstract
Long&#8208;wavelength light&#8208;emitting electrochemical cells (LECs) are potential deep&#8208;red and near infrared light sources with solution&#8208;processable simple device architecture, low&#8208;voltage operation, and compatibility with inert metal electrodes. Many scientific efforts have been made to material design and device engineering of the long&#8208;wavelength LECs over the past two decades. The materials designed the for long&#8208;wavelength LECs cover ionic transition metal complexes, small molecules, conjugated polymers, and perovskites. On the other hand, device engineering techniques, including spectral modification by adjusting microcavity effect, light outcoupling enhancement, energy down&#8208;conversion from color conversion layers, and adjusting intermolecular interactions, are also helpful in improving the device performance of long&#8208;wavelength LECs. In this review, recent advances in the long&#8208;wavelength LECs are reviewed from the viewpoints of materials and device engineering. Finally, discussions on conclusion and outlook indicate possible directions for future developments of the long&#8208;wavelength LECs. This review would like to pave the way for the researchers to design materials and device engineering techniques for the long&#8208;wavelength LECs in the applications of displays, bio&#8208;imaging, telecommunication, and night&#8208;vision displays.

         <title>Synthesis of Thioesters from Aldehydes via N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene (NHC) Catalyzed Radical Relay</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient reaction has been developed for thioesterification of aldehydes via radical relay by NHC catalysis. The key step is the coupling of the Breslow radical cation with the heteroatom radical (sulfur&#8208;radical). The excellent yields and broad substrate scope illustrated the efficiency of this strategy for achieving novel reactions via NHC catalysis.







Abstract
We have developed an efficient N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;catalyzed thioesterification of aldehydes using N&#8208;thiosuccinimides as the thiolation reagent. This organocatalyzed transition involves the generation of sulfur radicals by single electron transfer of the Breslow enolate (generated from aldehyde and NHC catalyst) with N&#8208;thiosuccinimides. This method offers facile access to various highly functionalized thioesters and exhibits good chemical yields and functional group tolerance.

The metastable phase Ge32Co9&#8722;x has been synthesized at high&#8208;pressure and temperature. It adopts a new structure type with three&#8208;core heteroclusters and unique chemical bonding. Units of three condensed cubes interconnect by sharing vertices and edges. As a result, two congruent frameworks interpenetrate while being separated by &#8220;empty space&#8221; housing lone pairs and covalent Ge&#8722;Ge bonds.







Abstract
The compound Ge32Co9&#8722;x (x=0.54(6), a=10.9861(3)&#8197;&#197;, space group Im
m) prepared under high pressure and at high temperature is metastable under ambient conditions. It crystallizes in a new structure type, Pearson symbol cI82&#8722;1.08. The crystal structure represents a slightly distorted cubic primitive arrangement of germanium atoms with part of the Ge cubes filled by cobalt. Analysis of the chemical bonding by real&#8208;space methods revealed three&#8208;core cluster units Ge16Co3 and seemingly empty regions comprising either covalent inter&#8208;polyhedral Ge&#8722;Ge bonds or lone&#8208;pairs located at the germanium atoms. The electrical conductivity is metal&#8208;like.

         <title>Probing Peptidylprolyl Bond cis/trans Status Using Distal 19F NMR Reporters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is demonstrated that incorporation of 4&#8208;fluorophenylalanine in model peptides provides an accurate and non&#8208;biased reporter of peptidylprolyl cis&#8208;trans conformational status by 19F NMR at physiological pH, even when several residues away from proline. In simple models, the prolyl bond conformational populations are predominantly governed by the amino acids local to proline and are conserved across different model systems.







Abstract
A method for measuring peptidylprolyl bond cis&#8208;trans conformational status in peptide models is described, using 4&#8208;fluorophenylalanine (4FPhe) as a distal reporter for 19F NMR. The %cis&#8208;Pro population was measured for peptides of the general structure Ac&#8208;X&#8208;Pro&#8208;Z&#8208;Ala&#8208;Ala&#8208;4FPhe (X and Z are proteinogenic amino acids) at pH&#8197;7.4, and provided conformational populations consistent with literature values obtained by more complex methods. This approach was applied to probe the prolyl bond status in pentapeptide models of the intrinsically disordered C&#8208;terminal region of &#945;&#8208;synuclein, which mirrored the preferences in the Ac&#8208;X&#8208;Pro&#8208;Z&#8208;Ala&#8208;4FPhe models. Advantageously, the 19F reporter group does not need to be adjacent to or attached to proline to provide quantifiable signals and distal 4&#8208;fluorophenylalanines can be placed so as not to influence prolyl bond conformation. Finally, we demonstrated that the prolyl bond status is not significantly affected by pH when there are ionisable amino acid residues at the carboxyl side of proline, which makes 19F NMR an invaluable tool with which to study proline isomerism at a range of pHs and in different solvents and buffers.

         <title>Selectivity Rule of Cryptands for Anions: Molecular Rigidity and Bonding Site</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cryptand cages with either &#8722;NH or &#8722;CH groups were computationally studied to identify their differences and determine the factors governing the anion preference. While the electrostatic interaction plays the predominating role in the capturing of halide anions by all CH/NH receptors, computational analyses revealed that the electrostatic attraction also rules the selectivity of &#8722;NH cryptands for halide anions. In contrast, the molecular rigidity governs the anion preference of &#8722;CH cryptands.







Abstract
Cryptands utilize inside CH or NH groups as hydrogen bond (H&#8208;bond) donors to capture anions such as halides. In this work, the nature and selectivity of confined hydrogen bonds inside cryptands were computationally analyzed with the energy decomposition scheme based on the block&#8208;localized wavefunction method (BLW&#8208;ED), aiming at an elucidation of governing factors in the binding between cryptands and anions. It was revealed that the intrinsic strengths of inward hydrogen bonds are dominated by the electrostatic attraction, while the anion preferences (selectivity) of inner CH and NH hydrogen bonds are governed by the Pauli exchange repulsion and electrostatic interaction, respectively. Typical conformers of cages are classified into two groups, including the C3(h)&#8208;symmetrical conformers, in which all halide anions are located near the centroids of cages, and the &#8220;semi&#8208;open&#8221; conformers, which exhibit shifted bonding sites for different halide anions. Accordingly, the difference in governing factors of selectivity is attributed to either the rigidity of cages or the binding site of anions for these two groups. In details, the C3 conformers of NH cryptands can be enlarged more remarkably than the C3(h)&#8208;symmetrical conformers of CH cryptands as the size of anion (ionic radius) increases, resulting in the relaxation of the Pauli repulsion and a dramatic reduction in electrostatic attraction, which eventually rules the selectivity of NH cryptands for halide anions. By contrary, the CH cryptands are more rigid and cannot effectively reduce the Pauli repulsion, which subsequently governs the anion preference. Unlike C3 conformers whose rigidity determines the selectivity, semi&#8208;open conformers exhibit different binding sites for different anions. From F&#8722; to I&#8722;, the bonding site shifts toward the outside end of the pocket inside the semi&#8208;open NH cryptand, leading to the significant reduction of the electrostatic interaction that dominates the anion preference. Differently, binding sites are much less affected by the size of anion inside the semi&#8208;open CH cryptand, in which the Pauli exchange repulsion remains the key factor for the selectivity of inner hydrogen bonds.

An isolable linear aminoborylene: A dicoordinate cyclic alkyl(amino)carbene (CAAC)&#8208;stabilized aminoborylene isoelectronic with an allene undergoes intramolecular C&#8722;C bond activation under photolytic conditions, intramolecular aryl migration in the presence of acetonitrile, one&#8208;electron oxidation with copper(I) halides to the corresponding haloboryl radicals, transition&#8208;metal&#8208;like binding of CO and reduction of N2O, sulfur and selenium, the latter yielding a terminal boraselenone.







Abstract
A cyclic alkyl(amino)carbene (CAAC)&#8208;stabilized dicoordinate aminoborylene is synthesized by the twofold reduction of a [(CAAC)BCl2(TMP)] (TMP=2,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidyl) precursor. NMR&#8208;spectroscopic, X&#8208;ray crystallographic and computational analyses confirm the cumulenic nature of the central C=B=N moiety. Irradiation of [(CAAC)B(TMP)] (2) resulted in an intramolecular C&#8722;C bond activation, leading to a doubly&#8208;fused C10BN heterocycle, while the reaction with acetonitrile resulted in an aryl migration from the CAAC to the acetonitrile nitrogen atom, concomitant with tautomerization of the latter to a boron&#8208;bound allylamino ligand. One&#8208;electron oxidation of 2 with CuX (X=Cl, Br) afforded the corresponding amino(halo)boryl radicals, which were characterized by EPR spectroscopy and DFT calculations. Placing 2 under an atmosphere of CO afforded the tricoordinate (CAAC,CO)&#8208;stabilized aminoborylene. Finally, the twofold oxidation of 2 with chalcogens led, in the case of N2O and sulfur, to the splitting of the B&#8722;CCAAC bond and formation of the 2,4&#8208;diamino&#8208;1,3,2,4&#8208;dichalcogenadiboretanes and CAAC&#8208;chalcogen adducts, whereas with selenium a monomeric boraselenone was isolated, which showed some degree of B&#8722;Se multiple bonding.

One-electron oxidation of &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; with CuX (X=Cl, Br) afforded the corresponding amino(halo)boryl radicals, which were characterized by EPR spectroscopy and DFT calculations. Placing &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; under an atmosphere of CO afforded the tricoordinate (CAAC,CO)-stabilized aminoborylene. Finally, the twofold oxidation of &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; with chalcogens led, in the case of N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and sulfur, to the splitting of the B&#8722;C&lt;sub&gt;CAAC&lt;/sub&gt; bond and formation of the 2,4-diamino-1,3,2,4-dichalcogenadiboretanes and CAAC-chalcogen adducts, whereas with selenium a monomeric boraselenone was isolated, which showed some degree of B&#8722;Se multiple bonding.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Phosphorus&#8208;Boron Multiple Bonding in the &#960; Radical HBP</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The multiply bonded &#960; radical HBP has been generated and characterized for the first time. Bonding analysis suggest that it differs from the isovalent HNB since the unpaired electron occupies one of the doubly degenerate &#960; bonding MOs, resulting in a B&#8722;P bond order of two and half.







Abstract
The HBP radical was generated via the reaction of laser ablated boron atom with PH3 in a solid neon matrix, which is identified via IR spectroscopy with isotopic substitutions and quantum chemical calculations. The results show that HBP has a 2&#928; electronic ground state with a short B&#8722;P bond. Bonding analysis indicates that besides an electron&#8208;sharing &#963; bond, there are two degenerate &#960; bonding orbitals that are occupied by three electrons, resulting in a bond order of two and half between P and B. This is in sharp contrast to the bonding properties of the isovalent HNB, which was characterized to be a N&#8801;B triply bonded &#963; radical with the unpaired electron locating on the B atom.

Total syntheses of geissoschizine&#8208;type monoterpenoid indole alkaloids (MTIAs) are reported. Intramolecular Pictet&#8208;Spengler cyclization was developed for the synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;villocarine&#8197;A. The total synthesis of highly strained (&#8722;)&#8208;apogeissoschizine was also accomplished through aza&#8208;Michael cyclization/E1cB elimination/stereoselective olefin isomerization sequence. Finally, (+)&#8208;geissoschizine, a common biosynthetic intermediate of MTIAs, was obtained from apogeissoschizine in a bioinspired ring&#8208;opening reaction.







Abstract
Total syntheses of geissoschizine&#8208;type monoterpenoid indole alkaloids (MTIAs) are reported. An intramolecular Pictet&#8208;Spengler cyclization was developed for the selective construction of the 3R stereocenter. The first total synthesis of (+)&#8208;villocarine&#8197;A was then achieved. Furthermore, the first total synthesis of the highly strained (&#8722;)&#8208;apogeissoschizine was also accomplished in an aza&#8208;Michael cyclization/E1cB elimination/stereoselective olefin isomerization sequence. Finally, (+)&#8208;geissoschizine, a common biosynthetic intermediate of MTIAs, was obtained from apogeissoschizine through ring&#8208;opening along with a release of ring strain.

         <title>Synthesis and Properties of Diphenylbenzo[j]naphtho[2,1,8&#8208;def][2,7]phenanthrolines</title>

A series of hitherto unknown 5,14&#8208;diphenylbenzo[j]naphtho[2,1,8&#8208;def][2,7]phenanthrolines were prepared by combination of Pd&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions with a one&#8208;pot Povarov/cycloisomerization reaction.

Abstract
A series of hitherto unknown 5,14&#8208;diphenylbenzo[j]naphtho[2,1,8&#8208;def][2,7]phenanthrolines, containing a 5&#8208;azatetracene and a 2&#8208;azapyrene subunit, were prepared by combination of Pd&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions with a one&#8208;pot Povarov/cycloisomerization reaction. In the final key step four new bonds are formed in one step. The synthetic approach allows for a high degree of diversification of the heterocyclic core structure. The optical and electrochemical properties were studied experimentally and by DFT/TD&#8208;DFT and NICS calculations. Due to the presence of the 2&#8208;azapyrene subunit, the typical electronic nature and characteristics of the 5&#8208;azatetracene moiety are lost and the compounds are electronically and optically more related to 2&#8208;azapyrenes.

         <title>Highly Fluorescent Supramolecular Nanoring Composed of Bent&#8208;Shaped Cyanostilbene Derivatives and Cucurbit[8]urils</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we materialized zero dimensional supramolecular organic framework with enhanced emission. We designed bent&#8208;shape guest molecule by novel backbone &#8220;cyanostilbene&#8221;. This unique bent&#8208;shape molecule only emitted enhanced fluorescence with cucurbit[8]uril (CB[8]) as a host in water. This nano&#8208;confined emissive molecule also formed homogeneous system without bundling at the high concentration when it became complex with CB[8].







Abstract
Supramolecular organic frameworks (SOFs) made of organic guest molecule and cucurbit[8]uril (CB[8]) in aqueous solution have great potential for diverse applications. Herein, we designed highly fluorescent zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) nano&#8208;ring SOF with CB[8] as a host and novel bent&#8208;shaped cyanostilbene guest. This host&#8211;guest complex successfully formed macrocyclic hexamer and showed significantly enhanced fluorescence (&#934;F=68&#8201;%) compared to non&#8208;assembled monomer (&#934;F=2&#8201;%). Unlike other SOFs, this 0D SOF could be dispersed uniformly without bundling phenomenon in water.

         <title>Ab Initio Metadynamics Simulations of Hexafluoroisopropanol Solvent Effects: Synergistic Role of Solvent H&#8208;Bonding Networks and Solvent&#8208;Solute C&#8722;H/&#960; Interactions</title>

         <dc:description>
Ab initio metadynamics simulations under explicit solvent environments were performed to investigate the promotion effect of HFIP solvent in Friedel&#8211;Crafts alkylation and Cope rearrangement reactions. The H&#8208;bonding network and the HFIP&#8208;substrate C&#8722;H/&#960; interaction are identified as the major factors affecting reactivity.







Abstract
The solvent effects in Friedel&#8211;Crafts cycloalkylation of epoxides and Cope rearrangement of aldimines were investigated by using ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. Explicit molecular treatments were applied for both reactants and solvents. The reaction mechanisms were elucidated via free energy calculations based on metadynamics simulations. The results reveal that both reactions proceed in a concerted fashion. Key solvent&#8208;substrate interactions are identified from the structures of transition states with explicit solvent molecules. The remarkable promotion effect of hexafluoroisopropanol solvent is ascribed to the synergistic effect of H&#8208;bonding networks and C&#8722;H/&#960; interactions with substrates.

         <title>High&#8208;Tc 1D Phase&#8208;Transition Semiconductor Photoluminescent Material with Broadband Emission</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

An organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid perovskite photoelectric multifunctional material: [C7H13ONCH2F] PbBr3 (1) was successfully designed and synthesised. It realized the coupling of thermo&#8208;dielectric switching characteristics, semiconductor characteristics and photoluminescence characteristics of STE broadband emission.







Abstract
One dimensional (1D) organic&#8208;inorganic halide hybrid perovskites have the advantages of excellent organic cation modifiability and diversity of inorganic framework structures, which cannot be ignored in the development of multi&#8208;functional phase&#8208;transition materials in photoelectric and photovoltaic devices. Here, we have successfully modified and synthesized an organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid perovskite photoelectric multifunctional phase&#8208;transition material: [C7H13ONCH2F]&#8901;PbBr3 (1). The synergistic effect of the order double disorder transition of organic cations and the change of the degree of distortion of the inorganic framework leads to its high temperature reversible phase&#8208;transition point of Tc=374&#8197;K/346&#8197;K and its ultra&#8208;low loss high&#8208;quality dielectric switch response. Through in&#8208;depth research and calculation, compound 1 also has excellent semiconductor characteristics with a band gap of 3.06&#8197;eV and the photoluminescence characteristics of self&#8208;trapped exciton (STE) broadband emission. Undoubtedly, this modification strategy provides a new choice for the research field of organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid perovskite reversible phase&#8208;transition photoelectric multifunctional materials with rich coupling properties.

         <title>Construction of a Diverse Range of Boron Heterocycles via Ring Expansion of a Carboranyl&#8208;Substituted 9&#8208;Borafluorene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Direct insertion of unsaturated substrates into a five&#8208;membered borole ring is a useful method to obtain valuable heterocycles containing one or more three&#8208;coordinate boron atoms. A 9&#8208;o&#8208;carboranyl&#8208;9&#8208;borafluorene, in which the&#160;o&#8208;carboranyl substituent is connected via one of the cluster carbon atoms to the boron atom of the 9&#8208;borafluorene unit, was found to react with a vast array of unsaturated molecules, such as alkynes, aldehydes and various organic azides, to form larger boraheterocyclic products. The ring expansion reactions of the central borole ring proceed rapidly at room temperature, cementing the role of the&#160;o&#8208;carboranyl substituent in enhancing the insertion reactivity of 9&#8208;borafluorenes.</dc:description>

         <title>Thermo&#8208;Induced Bathochromic Emission in Columnar Discotic Liquid Crystals Realized by Intramolecular Planarization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Most organic thermochromic fluorescent materials exhibit thermo&#8208;induced hypsochromic emission due to the formation of excimers in ordered molecular solids; however, it is still a challenge to endow them with bathochromic emission despite its significance in making up the field of thermochromism. Here, we report a thermo&#8208;induced bathochromic emission in columnar discotic liquid crystals realized by intramolecular planarization of the mesogenic fluorophores. We synthesized a kind of three&#8208;armed discotic molecules of dialkylamino&#8208;tricyanotristyrylbenzenes, which preferred to twist out of the core plane to accommodate ordered molecular stacking in hexagonal columnar mesophases, giving rise to bright green monomer emission. However, intramolecular planarization of the mesogenic fluorophores occurred in isotropic liquid increasing the conjugation length, and as a result led to thermo&#8208;induced bathochromic emission from green to yellow light. This work reports a new concept in the thermochromic field and provides a novel strategy to achieve fluorescence tuning from intramolecular actions.</dc:description>

         <title>Control over Dethreading Kinetics Allows Evaluating&#160;the Entropy Stored in an Interlocked Molecular Machine Out&#8208;of&#8208;Equilibrium</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The operation of nanomachines is fundamentally different from that of their macroscopic counterparts. In particular, the role of solvent is critical yet rarely associated with machine functionality. Here we study a minimal model of one of the most advanced molecular machines to gain control of its operation by engineering components and the employed solvent. Operation kinetics were changed over more than four orders of magnitude and could be modulated by solvent. Leveraging solvent properties, it was possible to monitor the relaxation of the molecular machine towards equilibrium and measure the heat exchanged in the process. Our work expands the capabilities of acid&#8208;base powered molecular machines, confirming experimentally that such systems have a dominant entropy content.</dc:description>

         <title>Insights into the Conformational Plasticity of the Protein Kinase Akt1 by Multi&#8208;Lateral Dipolar Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The serine/threonine kinase Akt1 is part of the PI3K/Akt pathway and plays a key role in the regulation of various cellular processes such as cell growth, proliferation, and apoptosis. Here, we analysed the elasticity between the two domains of the kinase Akt1, connected by a flexible linker, recording a wide variety of distance restraints by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. We studied full length Akt1 and the influence of the cancer&#8208;associated mutation E17K. The conformational landscape in the presence of different modulators, like different types of inhibitors and membranes was presented, revealing a tuned flexibility between the two domains, dependent on the bound molecule.</dc:description>

         <title>A novel electrocatalyst Pd(II)@Ni3(HITP)2 for ultrasensitive detection of chloramphenicol: experimental and computational investigation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ultrasensitive electrochemical detection on hazardous substances like antibiotics and pesticides is essential but still challenging in rapid test technology. Herein, we proposed the first electrode using high conductive metal organic frameworks (HCMOFs) for electrochemical detection of chloramphenicol, and demonstrated that Pd can be loaded onto HCMOFs to design the electrocatalyst Pd(II)@Ni3(HITP)2 with ultra&#8208;sensitivity in detection of chloramphenicol. An ultra&#8208;low limit of detection (LOD) of 0.2 nM (64.6 pg/mL) was observed, which is 1&#8208;2 order of magnitude lower than those of the reported materials as well as chromatographic detection. Moreover, the proposed HCMOFs showed long&#8208;time stability over 24 h. The superior detection sensitivity can be attributed to the high conductivity of Ni3(HITP)2, and the large content of Pd loading. The experimental characterizations and computational investigation consistently point out that the Pd loading mechanism in Pd(II)@Ni3(HITP)2 is PdCl2 adsorption on the abundant adsorption sites of Ni3(HITP)2. The proposed electrochemical sensor design using HCMOFs was demonstrated to be both effective and efficient, showing that the adoption of HCMOFs decorated with other effective electrocatalysts, combining high conductivity and large loading of electrocatalysts, can be of great advantages for ultrasensitive detection.</dc:description>

         <title>Pd/Co Catalyst with High Pd Atom Utilization Efficiency for Nitrobenzene Hydrogenation at Room Temperature: Experimental and DFT Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Put to good use: A Pd&#8208;doped Co (Pd/Co) catalyst with high Pd atom utilization efficiency was designed and prepared for hydrogenation of nitroarenes. Its catalytic activity was much better than commercial Pd powder (&gt;150 times) in nitrobenzene hydrogenation reaction. This work might provide a simple and low&#8208;cost methodology to design and synthesize highly efficient catalysts.







Abstract
Enhancing catalytic performance as well as reducing catalyst cost are the eternal pursuit for the catalysis community. Herein, a simple and effective palladium&#8208;doped cobalt (Pd/Co) catalyst with high Pd atom utilization efficiency was synthesized via galvanic replacement reaction for the selective hydrogenation of nitrobenzene with H2 at room temperature, delivering &gt;99&#8201;% yield of aniline with up to 158 times higher catalytic activity than commercial palladium powder. Detailed characterizations and DFT calculations revealed that Co&#8722;Pd interaction leads to a decrease in electron density of Pd and the distance between Pd atoms that results in the enhanced catalytic performance. Further experiments indicated that the Pd/Co catalyst serves as a highly efficient, selective, and recyclable catalyst for a range of nitroarene substrates. This work might provide a green and sustainable methodology to design and synthesize highly active catalysts with high utilization efficiency of the noble metals in fundamental and applied research.

Travelling without moving: A Ferrier rearrangement/aza&#8208;Wacker cyclization on commercial glycals allows both a 3,4&#8208;cis amination at position three and a motion of the double bound restoring the glycal. Epoxidation/glycosylation of N&#8208;Ts 3&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;deoxygalactal provided disaccharide with high diastereoselectivity and yield, thus defining FAWEG (Ferrier/Aza&#8208;Wacker/Epoxidation/Glycosylation) as a new sequence to access 1,2&#8208;trans 3&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;deoxyglycosides.







Abstract
3&#8208;Amino&#8208;3&#8208;deoxyglycosides constitute an essential class of nitrogen&#8208;containing sugars. Among them, many important 3&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;deoxyglycosides possess a 1,2&#8208;trans relationship. In view of their numerous biological applications, the synthesis of 3&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;deoxyglycosyl donors giving rise to a 1,2&#8208;trans glycosidic linkage is thus an important challenge. Even though glycals are highly polyvalent donors, the synthesis and reactivity of 3&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;deoxyglycals have been little studied. In this work, we describe a new sequence, involving a Ferrier rearrangement and subsequent aza&#8208;Wacker cyclization that allows the rapid synthesis of orthogonally protected 3&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;deoxyglycals. Finally a 3&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;deoxygalactal derivative was submitted for the first time to an epoxidation/glycosylation with high yield and great diastereoselectivity, highlighting FAWEG (Ferrier/Aza&#8208;Wacker/Epoxidation/Glycosylation) as a new approach to access 1,2&#8208;trans 3&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;deoxyglycosides.

         <title>Morphological Evolution of Calcite Grown in Bipolar&#8208;Charged Hydrogels: Charge Effects Enhanced by Gel&#8208;Incorporation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The incorporation of charged biomacromolecules is widely found in biomineralization. To investigate the significance of this biological strategy for mineralization control, we examined gelatin&#8208;incorporated calcite crystals grown from gelatin hydrogels with different charge distributions along the gel networks. We found that the charged groups on gelatin networks (amino cations, &#8211;NH3+ and carboxylic anions, &#8211;COO&#8208;) play crucial roles in controlling the crystallinity and the crystal morphology. And the charge effects are greatly enhanced by the gel&#8208;incorporation because the gel networks force the charged groups to attach to crystallization fronts. In contrast, ammonium ions (NH4+) and acetate ions (Ac&#8208;) dissolve in the crystallization media do not exhibit the similar charge effects because they easily desorb from the crystallization fronts. Employing the revealed charge effects, the calcite crystal composites with different morphologies can be flexibly prepared.</dc:description>

         <title>Recognizing the Minimum Structural Units Driving the Crystallization of SAPO&#8208;34 in a Top&#8208;Down Process</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A top&#8208;down synthesis system was designed to study the crystallization of SAPO&#8208;34. Based on characterizations on a clear precursor solution with abundant nuclei and designed synthesis experiments, it was demonstrated that the formation of small species containing Si&#8722;O&#8722;Al bonds is crucial for driving the crystallization of SAPO&#8208;34, rather than structural units with specific spatial conformation.







Abstract
Recognizing the structure and nature of the nuclei for zeolites crystallization on an atomic level is of great importance, which can provide guidance on the control of crystallization kinetics and the rational synthesis of zeolites. However, it remains a long&#8208;standing challenge due to the difficulty in characterization of amorphous precursor with limited crystal nuclei. Herein, a top&#8208;down synthesis system was designed for SAPO&#8208;34 molecular sieve and well investigated. A clear precursor solution with abundant SAPO&#8208;34 crystal nuclei was obtained under a depolymerization&#8208;dominant condition. The species in the liquid precursor were identified by FT&#8208;ICR MS, solid&#8208;state MAS NMR and atomic pair distribution function analyses. In combination with various designed experiments, it is revealed that both the formation of small species containing Si&#8722;O&#8722;Al bonds and reaching a certain concentration, is crucial for driving the crystallization of SAPO&#8208;34, rather than structural units with specific spatial conformation. This work provides an important understanding on the (pre)nucleation of SAPO&#8208;34 and sheds light on the synthesis control of SAPO molecular sieves.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An alcohol dehydrogenase LkADH was successfully engineered to exhibitimproved activity and substrate tolerance for the production of (S)&#8208;2&#8208;chloro&#8208;1&#8208;(3,4&#8208;difluorophenyl)ethanol, an important precursor of ticagrelor. Five potential hotspots were identified for enzyme mutagenesis by using natural residue abundance as an indicator to evaluate their potential plasticity. A semi&#8208;rational strategy named &#8220;aromatic residue scanning&#8221; was applied to randomly mutate these five sites simultaneously by using tyrosine, tryptophan, and phenylalanine as &#8220;exploratory residues&#8221; to introduce steric hindrance or potential &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions. The best variant Lk&#8208;S96Y/L199W identified with 17.2&#8208;fold improvement in catalytic efficiency could completely reduce up to 600 g/L (3.1 M) 2&#8208;chloro&#8208;1&#8208;(3,4&#8208;difluorophenyl)ethenone in 12 h with &gt;99.5% ee, giving the highest space&#8208;time yield ever reported. This study, therefore, offers a strategy for mutating alcohol dehydrogenase to reduce aromatic substrates and provides an efficient variant for the efficient synthesis of (S)&#8208;2&#8208;chloro&#8208;1&#8208;(3,4&#8208;difluorophenyl)ethanol.</dc:description>

         <title>Co2+ to Al3+ aliovalent substitution induced dual&#8208;site synergistic catalysis to Friedel&#8208;Crafts alkylation reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The dual&#8208;site synergistic effect in heterogeneous catalysis is quite interesting, and also complex because at least two substrate molecules are adsorbed or activated on the catalyst surface, which apparently needs two spatially separated and functionally independent active sites. It would become more difficult when the substrate molecules are large ones. The replacement of Al3+ in Al4B6O15 lattice with Co2+ leads to the formation of unsaturated Co2+ (4&#8208;fold coordination) along with oxygen vacancies (O v ). The former one behaves as a medium&#8208;strength Lewis acid site, and can adsorb and activate molecules with a nitro group (e.g., &#946;&#8208;nitrostyrene). The latter one can adsorb and activate oxygen species, which further activates the indole derivatives. Next, the spatially separated dual sites on the catalyst surface can synergistically and efficiently catalyze their Friedel&#8208;Crafts alkylation reactions under mild conditions. The high durability can be proved by the as&#8208;maintained high yields, i.e. 98%, 93%, 96%, 92% and 90% for 5 runs, respectively. The reaction kinetics obey the second&#8208;order characteristic. Annealing under hydrogen condition can further generate more surficial O v , leading to an improvement to the catalytic activity. A simple and probably routine aliovalent doping endows such a complex synergistic catalysis involving two large substrate molecules, providing an inspired perspective of developing dual&#8208;site catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of a B&#8208;Antigen Hexasaccharide, a B&#8208;Lewis b Heptasaccharide and Glycoconjugates Thereof to Investigate Binding Properties of Helicobacter pylori</title>

Introduction of the Gal&#8208;&#945;&#8208;(B)&#8208;determinant into a versatile Lacto&#8208;N&#8208;tetraose precursor followed by mono&#8208; or difucosylation afforded, after deprotection, the B&#8208;Lewis b heptasaccharide and the B&#8208;hexasaccharide structures, which were conjugated to BSA to yield glycoconjugates. Initial inhibition studies investigates the dependence of the binding to H. pylori strains on loading and the presence of B (Gal) and Lewis (Fuc) determinants.







Abstract
Infecting the stomach of almost 50&#8201;% of people, Helicobacter pylori is a causative agent of gastritis, peptic ulcers and stomach cancers. Interactions between bacterial membrane&#8208;bound lectin, Blood group Antigen Binding Adhesin (BabA), and human blood group antigens are key in the initiation of infection. Herein, the synthesis of a B&#8208;antigen hexasaccharide (B6) and a B&#8208;Lewis b heptasaccharide (BLeb7) and Bovine Serum Albumin glycoconjugates thereof is reported to assess the binding properties and preferences of BabA from different strains. From a previously reported trisaccharide acceptor a versatile key Lacto&#8208;N&#8208;tetraose tetrasaccharide intermediate was synthesized, which allowed us to explore various routes to the final targets, either via initial introduction of fucosyl residues followed by introduction of the B&#8208;determinant or vice versa. The first approach proved unsuccessful, whereas the second afforded the target structures in good yields. Protein conjugation using isothiocyanate methodology allowed us to reach high glycan loadings (up to 23 per protein) to mimic multivalent displays encountered in Nature. Protein glycoconjugate inhibition binding studies were performed with H. pylori strains displaying high or low affinity for Lewis b hexasaccharide structures showing that the binding to the high affinity strain was reduced due to the presence of the B&#8208;determinant in the Bleb7&#8208;conjugates and further reduced by the absence of the Lewis fucose residue in the B6&#8208;conjugate.

         <title>Effect of Mini&#8208;PEGs Modification on the Enzymatic Digestion of D&#8208;Amino Acid&#8208;Containing Peptides under the Action of PROK
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of mini&#8208;PEGs modified D&#8208;amino acid&#8208;containing peptides were synthesized. It was determined that the polyethylene glycol (PEG) modification promoted the enzymatic cleavage of the D&#8208;amino acid&#8208;containing peptides under the action of serine&#8208;like proteases.







Abstract
It was previously reported that D&#8208;amino acid&#8208;containing peptides exhibited the ability to resist enzymatic hydrolysis. This study investigated the influence of mini&#8208;PEGs modification on enzymatic hydrolysis ability of D&#8208;amino acid&#8208;containing peptides. The results showed that PEGylation promoted enzymatic hydrolysis of the D&#8208;amino acid&#8208;containing peptide, especially, the cleavage rate of the D&#8208;amino acid&#8208;containing peptide 6&#8208;w with PEG3 modification at the N&#8208;ends was up to 17 times higher in the presence of proteinase K (PROK) compared to those without PEG3 modification. Moreover, analysis of the enzymatic cleavage sites demonstrated a similar cleavage pattern of the PEGylated D&#8208;amino acid&#8208;containing peptide to that of the unmodified peptide. The computational simulations further showed that the enhanced enzymatic hydrolysis ability can be attributed to the strong interaction between PROK and the peptide after PEG3 modification and the resulting formation of a mature catalytic triad structure.

         <title>l&#8208;Serine is the Direct Precursor for the Pyrazine Ring Construction in the Biosynthesis of 3&#8208;Isobutyl&#8208;2&#8208;Methoxypyrazine in Bell Pepper Fruits (Capsicum annuum L.)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The biosynthetic pathway of 3&#8208;isobutyl&#8208;2&#8208;methoxypyrazine (IBMP) was investigated in plants using in&#8197;vivo feeding experiments with stable&#8208;isotope labeled precursors. It has been demonstrated that photorespiratory derived l&#8208;serine serves as a C2&#8208;builing block and an N&#8208;donor in IBMP&#8208;biosynthesis.







Abstract
3&#8208;Isobutyl&#8208;2&#8208;methoxypyrazine (IBMP) is an extremely potent odorant and responsible for the specific aroma of many fruits and vegetables. Especially bell pepper contains high levels of IBMP, which is the character impact compound of its typical aroma. However, since the discovery of methoxypyrazines in plants in the 1960s the biosynthesis of their pyrazine ring motif remained so far unknown. Therefore, the biosynthetic pathway to IBMP was investigated by feeding experiments with stable&#8208;isotope labeled precursors. For the first time it could be shown that l&#8208;serine plays a key role in the pyrazine ring construction of 3&#8208;alkyl&#8208;2&#8208;methoxypyrazines (MPs). Based on HS&#8208;SPME&#8208;GCxGC&#8208;TOF&#8208;MS analysis, it is shown that the biosynthetic pathway to IBMP is closely linked to photorespiratory derived l&#8208;serine.

     alt="l-Serine is the Direct Precursor for the Pyrazine Ring Construction in the Biosynthesis of 3-Isobutyl-2-Methoxypyrazine in Bell Pepper Fruits (Capsicum annuum L.)"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The biosynthetic pathway of 3-isobutyl-2-methoxypyrazine (IBMP)&lt;/b&gt; was investigated in plants using in&#8197;vivo feeding experiments with stable-isotope labeled precursors. It has been demonstrated that photorespiratory derived &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;-serine serves as a C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-builing block and an N-donor in IBMP-biosynthesis.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3-Isobutyl-2-methoxypyrazine (IBMP) is an extremely potent odorant and responsible for the specific aroma of many fruits and vegetables. Especially bell pepper contains high levels of IBMP, which is the character impact compound of its typical aroma. However, since the discovery of methoxypyrazines in plants in the 1960s the biosynthesis of their pyrazine ring motif remained so far unknown. Therefore, the biosynthetic pathway to IBMP was investigated by feeding experiments with stable-isotope labeled precursors. For the first time it could be shown that &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;-serine plays a key role in the pyrazine ring construction of 3-alkyl-2-methoxypyrazines (MPs). Based on HS-SPME-GCxGC-TOF-MS analysis, it is shown that the biosynthetic pathway to IBMP is closely linked to photorespiratory derived &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;-serine.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Asymmetrical Platinum and Rhodium Dinuclear Complex Strongly Bound to Filled d
 Complexes by Unbridged Pt&#8722;Metal Bonds: Toward Heterometallic&#8208;Extended Metal Atom Chains</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Line up, line up! HOMO&#8208;LUMO interactions between metal d
 orbitals were used to synthesize hetero&#8208;xtended metal atom chains (EMACs) for tuning the number of nuclei and metal species. Mixing an asymmetrical Pt&#8722;Rh dinuclear complex with a LUMO in the &#963;* orbital and a mononuclear complex with a HOMO in the d
 orbital allows two&#8208;step multinucleation, affording hetero&#8208;EMACs with three well&#8208;aligned metal species.







Abstract
Heterometallic extended metal atom chains (EMACs) aligned with three types of metal were rationally synthesized by forming unbridged metal&#8722;metal bonds based on the interactions between highest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals at the d
 orbital. These chains form pentanuclear structures aligned as Rh&#8722;Pt&#8722;M&#8722;Pt&#8722;Rh with relatively large formation constants of 5.0&#215;1013&#8197;M&#8722;2 for M=Pt and 6.3&#215;1011&#8197;M&#8722;2 for M=Pd, while retaining their backbones in solution. In the case of M=Cu, the original Cu(+2) atoms were reduced to Cu(+1) during the synthetic process. Cu(+1) has an unprecedented trigonal bipyramidal coordination geometry. The reported synthesis based on asymmetrical dinuclear complexes provides a guideline for the synthesis of hetero&#8208;EMACs to allow several analogs through judicious combinations realized by tuning the number of metal nuclei and metal species.

         <title>Fabricating Robust Pt Clusters on Sn&#8208;Doped CeO2 for CO Oxidation: A Deep Insight into Support Engineering and Surface Structural Evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reported on a simple Sn&#8208;doped CeO2 approach to create oxygen&#8208;rich vacancies, and investigated the impact of such vacancies on the CO oxidation performance of Pt/CSO&#8208;a catalysts. The oxygen vacancies were found to limit Pt agglomeration and promote a smaller particle size of the Pt/CSO&#8208;a catalyst. The smaller particle size led to more exposed active sites, which enhanced the ability to activate oxygen and improve the catalytic activity towards CO oxidation.







Abstract
The size effect on nanoparticles, which affects the catalysis performance in a significant way, is crucial. The tuning of oxygen vacancies on metal&#8208;oxide support can help reduce the size of the particles in active clusters of Pt, thus improving catalysis performance of the supported catalyst. Herein, Ce&#8722;Sn solid solutions (CSO) with abundant oxygen vacancies have been synthesized. Activated by simple CO reduction after loading Pt species, the catalytic CO oxidation performance of Pt/CSO was significantly better than that of Pt/CeO2. The reasons for the elevated activity were further explored regarding ionic Pt single sites being transformed into active Pt clusters after CO reduction. Due to more exposed oxygen vacancies, much smaller Pt clusters were created on CSO (ca. 1.2&#8197;nm) than on CeO2 (ca. 1.8&#8197;nm). Consequently, more exposed active Pt clusters significantly improved the ability to activate oxygen and directly translated to the higher catalytic oxidation performance of activated Pt/CSO catalysts in vehicle emission control applications.

         <title>Microporous Metal&#8208;Phosphonates with a Novel Orthogonalized Linker and Complementary Guests: Insights for Trivalent Metal Complexes from Divalent Metal Complexes</title>

Metal&#8208;organic framework or smoked meat sandwiches? A novel orthogonalized aryl&#8208;phosphonate linker is used to direct formation of porous open frameworks. The network structures are highly dependent on the inclusion and structure of the guest aromatic compounds.







Abstract
The reliable self&#8208;assembly of microporous metal&#8208;phosphonate materials remains a longstanding challenge. This stems from, generally, more coordination modes for the functional group allowing more dense structures, and stronger bonding driving less crystalline products. Here, a novel orthogonalized aryl&#8208;phosphonate linker, 1,3,5&#8208;tris(4&#8217;&#8208;phosphono&#8208;2&#8217;,6&#8217;&#8208;dimethylphenyl) benzene (H6L3) has been used to direct formation of open frameworks. The peripheral aryl rings of H6L3 are orthogonalized relative to the central aromatic ring giving a tri&#8208;cleft conformation of the linker in which small aromatic molecules can readily associate. When coordinated to magnesium ions, a series of porous crystalline metal&#8208;organic, and hydrogen&#8208;bonded metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs, HMOFs) are formed (CALF&#8208;41 (Mg), HCALF&#8208;42 (Mg), &#8208;43 (Mg)). While most metal&#8208;organic frameworks are tailored based on choice of metal and linker, here, the network structures are highly dependent on the inclusion and structure of the guest aromatic compounds. Larger guests, and a higher stoichiometry of metal, result in increased solvation of the metal ion, resulting in networks with connectivities increasingly involving hydrogen&#8208;bonds rather than direct phosphonate coordination. Upon thermal activation and aromatic template removal, the materials exhibit surface areas ranging from 400&#8211;600&#8197;m2/g. Self&#8208;assembly in the absence of aromatic guests yields mixtures of phases, frequently co&#8208;producing a dense 3&#8208;fold interpenetrated structure (1). Interestingly, a series of both more porous (530&#8211;900&#8197;m2/g), and more robust solids is formed by complexing with trivalent metal ions (Al, Ga, In) with aromatic guest; however, these are only attainable as microcrystalline powders. The polyprotic nature of phosphonate linkers enables structural analogy to the divalent analogues and these are identified as CALF&#8208;41 analogues. Finally, insights to the structural transformations during metal ion desolvation in this family are gained by considering a pair of structurally related Co materials, whose hydrogen&#8208;bonded (HCALF&#8208;44 (Co)) and desolvated (CALF&#8208;44 (Co)) coordination bonded networks were fully structurally characterized.

Collaborative work: The synthesis of a new monoboranyl ligand scaffold is described. This ambiphilic diphosphine allows for the cooperative coordination of organonitriles in partnership with nickel(0).







Abstract
Metal&#8208;ligand cooperation has emerged as a versatile tool for substrate activation in chemical reactivity. Herein, we provide the synthesis and characterization of a monoboranyl&#8208;containing analogue of the ubiquitous bulky diphosphine ligand, 1,2&#8208;bis(di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphosphino)ethane, whose reactivity has been examined using nickel. Together, the pairing of nickel and boron provides a platform that allows for the cooperative coordination of organonitriles, giving unusual examples of intermolecularly bound dinickelacycles.

         <title>Heterophenoquinones: Tuning Optoelectronics and Electrochromicity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the synthesis and optoelectronic properties of 16 thiophene&#8208;based heterophenoquinones. These compounds were accessed in a convergent and modular approach, allowing for their efficient synthesis. Tuning of the optical band gap was achieved through &#960;&#8208;extension by annulation of a benzene or tropone moiety to the thiophene, oxidation, change of the heteroatom or by attachment of a donor substituent to the thiophene core. The resulting compounds display intense colors covering the entire visible spectrum. We identified structure &#8208; property relationships and their impact on the HOMO and LUMO levels. Additionally, these materials change color upon reduction and according to in situ ultraviolet&#8208;visible&#8208;near infrared (UV&#8208;vis&#8208;NIR) and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectro&#8208;electrochemistry, they are promising electrochromes with cathodic color changes. Seven different electrochromic devices were constructed which all displayed a change in colour upon reduction, demonstrating the potential of these new dyes in e.g. tintable glass.</dc:description>

         <title>Detection of Large Genomic RNA via DNAzyme&#8208;Mediated RNA Cleavage and Rolling Circle Amplification: SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 as a Model</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report on a new method for the detection of genomic RNA that combines RNA cleavage by the 10&#8208;23 DNAzyme and use of the cleavage fragments as primers to initiate rolling circle amplification (RCA). We first screened 230 different 10&#8208;23 DNAzyme variants to identify those that target accessible RNA sites within the highly structured RNA transcripts of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. A total of 28 DNAzymes were identified with &gt;20% cleavage, 5 with &gt;40% cleavage and one with &gt;60% in 10 min. The cleavage fragments from these reactions were then screened for coupling to an RCA reaction, leading to the identification of several cleavage fragments that could efficiently initiate RCA. Using a newly developed quasi&#8208;exponential RCA method with a detection limit of 500 aM of RNA, we evaluated 14 RT&#8208;PCR positive and 15 RT&#8208;PCR negative patient saliva samples for SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 genomic RNA, achieving a clinical sensitivity of 86% and specificity of 100% for detection of the virus in &lt;2.5 hours.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemo&#8208;enzymatic synthesis of long&#8208;chain oligosaccharides for studying xylan&#8208;modifying enzymes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Plant research is hampered in several aspects by a lack of pure oligosaccharide samples that closely represent structural features of cell wall glycans. An alternative to purely chemical synthesis to access these oligosaccharides is chemo&#8208;enzymatic synthesis using glycosynthases. These enzymes enable the ligation of oligosaccharide donors, when activated for example as a&#8208;glycosyl fluorides, with suitable acceptor oligosaccharides. Herein, the synthesis of xylan oligosaccharides up to dodecasaccharides is reported, with glycosynthase&#8208;mediated coupling reactions as key steps. The xylo&#8208;oligosaccharide donors were protected at the non&#8208;reducing end with a 4&#8208;O&#8208;tetrahydropyranyl (THP) group to prevent polymerization. Installation of an unnatural 3&#8208;O&#8208;methylether substituent at the reducing end xylose of the oligosaccharides ensured good water solubility. Biochemical assays demonstrated enzymatic activity for the xylan acetyltransferase XOAT1 from Arabidopsis thaliana, xylan arabinofuranosyl&#8208;transferase XAT3 enzymes from rice and switchgrass, and the xylan glucuronosyltransferase GUX3 from Arabidopsis thaliana. In case of the glucuronosyltransferase GUX3, MALDI&#8208;MS/MS analysis of the reaction product suggested that a single glucuronosyl substituent was installed primarily at the central xylose residues of the dodecasaccharide acceptor, demonstrating the value of long&#8208;chain acceptors for assaying biosynthetic glycosyltransferases.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Hemipiperazines are a recently discovered class of peptide&#8208;derived molecular photoswitches with high biocompatibility and therapeutic potential. Here, for the first time we describe photochromism of heterocyclic hemipiperazines. They demonstrate long thermal lifetimes, enlarged band separation between photoisomers. Efficient photoisomerization occurs under aqueous conditions, although with a need for organic co&#8208;solvent. Bidirectional switching with visible light is observed for an extended aromatic system.</dc:description>

         <title>Isomerization of DASA Molecules in the Nanopores of Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks: What Determines Its Reversibility?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In recent years, light responsive molecules have been incorporated in metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) to fabricate light&#8208;responsive intelligent devices, where reversible isomerization of the guest molecules in the nanopores is crucial. However, how to design porous environment of MOFs to achieve a reversible isomerization remains unknown until now. In this work, donor&#8208;acceptor Stenhouse adduct (DASA), a new kind of visible light responsive compounds, were confined in the nanopores of different MOFs to study their isomerization upon visible light irradiation/mild heating. We found that the polarity of the pore environment is the key to control the reversibility of isomerization of such guest molecules. Under the guidance of this principle, MIL&#8208;53(Al) was screened to investigate proton conductivity and switching performance of the DASA confined MOF. The proton conductance was up to 0.013 S cm&#8208;1 at 80 &#8451; and 98% RH, and at least 30 switching cycles were achieved thanks to the Grotthuss&#8208;type mechanism and low polarity of MIL&#8208;53(Al) pore environment.</dc:description>

         <title>Progress of Azametallacyclopentadienes in the New Century</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As the key intermediates in metal promoted/catalyzed C&#8210;C bond coupling reactions of nitriles and alkynes, azametallacyclopentadienes, M(N=CR1&#8210;CR2=CR3), are an important class of azametallacycles. Although the first authentic azametallacyclopentadienes were documented in 1986, their chemistry towards solid&#8208;state structures, intrinsic reactivity and synthetic application was rarely investigated for a long time. At the beginning of this century, seminal works about the applications of azametallacyclopentadienes in the synthesis of heterocycles, including multi&#8208;substituted pyridines, isoquinolines, furans and pyrroles were reported. Subsequently, a series of new complexes with this motif, namely the group 4, aluminum, actinide and rare&#8208;earth azametallacyclopentadienes were isolated and structurally characterized. Among them, the rare&#8208;earth metallacyclopentadiene expresses high reactivity towards unsaturated molecules, such as nitriles, isocyanides and Mo(CO)6 to provide novel fused metallacycles. In this concept, we summarized the advances towards the preparation, reactivity and synthetic application of azametallacyclopentadienes in past twenty years.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantioselective transformations from nitriles to NH2&#8208;&#945;&#8208;tertiary amines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic molecules, containing one or more amine chiral centers, are very common to see in natural products and medicines. Although a large number of methods have been developed to afford enantiopure amines, most of the known approaches are limited with various reasons. For example, many methodologies start from nitrogen protected and activated substrates, which usually need multistep operations and seriously decrease the atom economy. Here we disclose a new catalytic strategy from commercial nitriles to high enantioselective &#945;&#8208;tertiary primary amines in up to 90% yield and 95% enantiomeric excess. This transformation firstly undergoes an addition process of organolithium reagents to nitriles to generate the imine intermediates in situ. Subsequently, the most challenging step is by employing copper catalytic enantioselective addition of AllylBpin to the imine intermediates to form the final amines in one pot.</dc:description>

         <title>Nanopore Deciphering Single Digital Polymers Towards&#160;High&#8208;Density Data Storage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sequence&#8208;defined polymer is one of the most promising alternative media for high&#8208;density data storage. It could be used to alleviate the problem of insufficient storage capacity of conventional silicon&#8208;based devices for the explosively increasing data. To fulfil the goal of polymer data storage, suitable methods should be developed to accurately read and decode the information&#8208;containing polymers, especially for those composed by a combination of the natural and unnatural monomers. Nanopore&#8208;based approaches have become one of the most competitive analysis and sequencing techniques, which are expected to read both natural and synthetic polymers with single&#8208;molecule precision and monomeric resolution. Herein, this work emphasizes the advances being made in nanopore reading and decoding of information stored in the man&#8208;made polymers and DNA nanostructures, and discusses the challenges and opportunities towards the development and realization of high&#8208;density data storage.</dc:description>

         <title>Cysteine&#8208;Selective Modification of Peptides and Proteins via Desulfurative C&#8722;C Bond Formation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cysteine&#8208;selective, visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated bioconjugation reaction that enables direct installation of a range of desired moieties into peptide and protein scaffolds via C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) bond formation is described. The method is rapid, operationally simple, tolerant to ambient atmosphere and can be utilized to incorporate general tools for chemical biology, including effective PTM mimics, via a stable, biogenic hydrocarbon linkage.







Abstract
The site&#8208;selective modification of peptides and proteins facilitates the preparation of targeted therapeutic agents and tools to interrogate biochemical pathways. Among the numerous bioconjugation techniques developed to install groups of interest, those that generate C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) bonds are significantly underrepresented despite affording proteolytically stable, biogenic linkages. Herein, a visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated reaction is described that enables the site&#8208;selective modification of peptides and proteins via desulfurative C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) bond formation. The reaction is rapid and high yielding in peptide systems, with comparable translation to proteins. Using this chemistry, a range of moieties is installed into model systems and an effective PTM&#8208;mimic is successfully integrated into a recombinantly expressed histone.

Photo&#8208;assisted metal air battery: The diagram exhibits an integrated photo&#8208;assisted metal air battery with the typical two&#8208;electrode configuration. This minireview introduces the general photo&#8208;assisted strategies and summarizes the recent advances of various photo&#8208;assisted metal air battery systems including Li&#8722;O2 battery, Zn&#8722;O2 battery and other metal&#8208;air batteries and highlights the remaining challenges and future opportunities.







Abstract
To meet the need of high energy density, long durability, safe and cost&#8208;efficient energy conversion and storage devices, metal&#8208;air batteries like Li&#8722;O2 and Zn&#8722;O2 batteries have received enormous attention and were subject to exciting development in the past decade. Photo&#8208;assisted strategies that enable the effective combination of photo/electric energy conversion/storage render a new dimension for the conventional metal&#8208;air batteries techniques with mere electric energy utilization. Therefore, tremendous research is ongoing in search of more efficient and durable devices with photo&#8208;assisted strategies. This review provides an overview of photo&#8208;assisted Li&#8722;O2 batteries, Zn&#8722;O2 batteries, and batteries with various metal/air components. The working mechanism, the basic device architecture and practical performances of various photo&#8208;assisted systems are summarized and discussed. Furthermore, certain technical challenges and future opportunities for the photo&#8208;assisted metal air batteries are emphasized and discussed in the hope of stimulating further research.

A hexabrominated benzo&#8208;fused tris&#8208;cycloheptenylene was &#960;&#8208;extended by Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling to afford PAHs consisting of two heptagons and one octagon as a consequence of a ring&#8208;expanding 1,2&#8208;rearragement. This is due to the high steric demand. The title compounds display a blue to blue&#8208;green fluorescence and increased emission intensity as well as hypsochromic shifts in the solid state.

         <title>Chromatic Selectivity of Coumarin&#8208;Caged Oligonucleotides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of green&#8208;light activatable DCCM photo&#8208;tethers allows efficient photocaging of oligonucleotides. In addition, DCCM can be used in combination with conventional blue&#8208;light absorbing DEACM to build an &#8220;orthogonal&#8221; system. It was suggested to rather use the term &#8220;chromatic selectivity&#8221; for which the necessary equations were provided. These showed that chromatic selectivity can even be adjusted by careful choice of starting material.







Abstract
A system of two coumarin&#8208;based caging groups is presented &#8211; one absorbing in the blue (400&#8211;450&#8197;nm) and the other absorbing in the green (480&#8211;550&#8197;nm) part of the visible spectrum. Together they form a pair, which allows to selectively photoactivate the one or the other in oligonucleotides. A numerical characterization defining the term &#8220;chromatic selectivity&#8221; was proposed, and it was shown how chromatically selective uncaging can literally be titrated in a kinetic reaction scheme.

         <title>Tin Active Sites Confined in Zeolite Framework as a Promising Shape&#8208;Selective Catalyst for Ethylene Oxide Hydration</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Topotactic conversion of germanosilicate UTL into stannosilicates Sn&#8208;PCR with various Sn contents have been realized through post&#8208;synthesis strategy. The Sn&#8208;PCR&#8208;20 (Si/Sn molar ratio of 77) catalyst served as a shape&#8208;selective nanoreactor for eco&#8208;efficient production of glycol.







Abstract
Shape&#8208;selective stannosilicates have been post&#8208;synthesized for the hydration of epoxide to diols. A simple acid treatment has been employed to remove extensively the interlayer double four ring units, converting the three&#8208;dimensional (3D) UTL germanosilicate into a 2D layered IPC&#8208;1P intermediate. Isomorphous incorporation of tetrahedrally coordinated Sn active centers was realized via solid&#8208;liquid treatment of IPC&#8208;1P with diammonium hexachlorostannate aqueous solution, which was accompanied by the spontaneous condensation of neighboring silica&#8208;rich cfi layers upon calcination and structural construction of a 3D PCR structure. Sn&#8208;PCR stannosilicates with tunable Sn contents were thus prepared. With Sn&#8208;derived robust Lewis acidity confined in the intersecting 10&#8208; and 8&#8208;ring channels, the Sn&#8208;PCR (Si/Sn molar ratio of 77) catalyst served as a shape&#8208;selective nanoreactor for the hydration of ethylene oxide (EO) into ethylene glycol (EG), exhibiting a remarkable EO conversion (99.5&#8201;%) as well as a steady EG selectivity (&gt;98.4&#8201;%) at greatly reduced H2O/EO molar ratio and near&#8208;ambient reaction temperature.

         <title>Excited&#8208;State Dynamics in Borylated Arylisoquinoline Complexes in Solution and in cellulo</title>

Four&#8208;coordinate organoboron N,C Chelates are used as fluorescence dyes in biological environment. Their excited&#8208;state properties within human MCF&#8208;7&#8197;cells are characterized by time&#8208;resolved pump&#8208;probe spectroscopy and fluorescence lifetime microscopy. Two chromophores show different features in cellulo depending on the nature of the anchored PEG chains. These findings underline that our approach can extend the information from FLIM and evaluate the excited&#8208;state properties of functional fluorophores in a complex biological environment.







Abstract
Two four&#8208;coordinate organoboron N,C&#8208;chelate complexes with different functional terminals on the PEG chains are studied with respect to their photophysical properties within human MCF&#8208;7&#8197;cells. Their excited&#8208;state properties are characterized by time&#8208;resolved pump&#8208;probe spectroscopy and fluorescence lifetime microscopy. The excited&#8208;state relaxation dynamics of the two complexes are similar when studied in DMSO. Aggregation of the complexes with the carboxylate terminal group is observed in water. When studying the light&#8208;driven excited&#8208;state dynamics of both complexes in cellulo, i.&#8201;e., after being taken up into human MCF&#8208;7&#8197;cells, both complexes show different features depending on the nature of the anchoring PEG chains. The lifetime of a characteristic intramolecular charge&#8208;transfer state is significantly shorter when studied in cellulo (360&#177;170&#8197;ps) as compared to in DMSO (&#8764;960&#8197;ps) at 600&#8197;nm for the complexes with an amino group. However, the kinetics of the complexes with the carboxylate group are in line with those recorded in DMSO. On the other hand, the lifetimes of the fluorescent state are almost identical for both complexes in cellulo. These findings underline the importance to evaluate the excited&#8208;state properties of fluorophores in a complex biological environment in order to fully account for intra&#8208; and intermolecular effects governing the light&#8208;induced processes in functional dyes.

Abstract
Herein, we report the design and scalable synthesis of three new Co(III) complexes, which have an unusual hydrocarbon &#951;1&#8208;alkyl&#8208;&#951;3&#8208;allyl&#8208;&#951;5&#8208;cyclopentadienyl ligation structure, from the reactions of readily available cobalt(II) compound CoCl2(PPh3)2 and biomass material &#946;&#8208;pinene via C&#8722;C bond activation. These Co(III) complexes are air&#8208;stable, fairly volatile, and thermally stable, so they are excellent candidates as the metal precursors for the vapor deposition of cobalt&#8208;containing thin films. As a demonstration, we show that the Co(III) complex of [(3&#8217;&#8208;5&#8217;&#8208;&#951;,1&#8208;&#963;)&#8208;methylene(2,2,4&#8208;trimethyl&#8208;4&#8208;cyclohexene&#8208;1,3&#8208;diyl)](&#951;5&#8208;methylcyclopentadienyl)Co (i.&#8201;e. (seco&#8208;pinene)(MeCp)Co) is well suited for the atomic layer deposition (ALD) of Co3O4 and CoS2 thin films, and the deposited Co3O4 and CoS2 films are able to conformally cover trench structures with a fairly high aspect ratio of 10&#8201;:&#8201;1.

As a demonstration, we show that the Co(III) complex of [(3&#8217;-5&#8217;-&lt;i&gt;&#951;&lt;/i&gt;,1-&lt;i&gt;&#963;&lt;/i&gt;)-methylene(2,2,4-trimethyl-4-cyclohexene-1,3-diyl)](&lt;i&gt;&#951;&lt;/i&gt;

         <title>Substituent&#8208;Dependent Photoexcitation Processes of &#960;&#8208;Stacked Ion Pairs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Various combinations of charged porphyrins with controlled electronic states were achieved by ion&#8208;pair metathesis based on the HSAB theory. The transient absorption spectra of the porphyrin ion pairs revealed photoinduced electron transfer from the anion to the cation through substituent&#8208;dependent photoexcitation processes. More information can be found in the Research Article by Y. Kobayashi, H. Maeda, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202203957).

         <title>Cumulative Effect of pH and Redox Triggers on Highly Adaptive Transient Coacervates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An intricate synergism between multiple biochemical processes and physical conditions determines the formation and function of various biological self&#8208;assemblies. Thus, a complex set of variables dictate the far&#8208;from&#8208;equilibrium nature of these biological assemblies. Mimicking such systems synthetically is a challenging task. We report multi&#8208;stimuli responsive transient coacervation of an aldehyde&#8208;appended polymer and a short peptide. The coacervates are formed by the disulphide linkages between the peptide molecules and the imine bond between the polymer and the peptide. Imines are susceptible to pH changes and the disulphide bonds can be tuned by oxidation/reduction processes. Thus, the coacervation is operational only under the combined effect of appropriate pH and oxidative conditions. Taking advantage of these facts, the coacervates are transiently formed under a pH cycle (urea &#8211; urease /gluconolactone) and a non&#8208;equilibrium redox cycle (TCEP/H2O2). Importantly, the system showed high adaptability toward environmental changes. The transient existence of the coacervates can be generated without any apparent change in size and shape within the same system through the sequential application of the abovementioned nonequilibrium reaction cycles. Additionally, the coacervation allows for efficient encapsulation/stabilisation of proteins. Thus, the system has the potential to be used for</dc:description>

         <title>Rhodamine&#8208;Sensitized Two&#8208;Photon Activation of a Red LightAbsorbing BODIPY Photocage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two&#8208;photon (2P) activatable probes are of high value in biological and medical chemistry since near infrared (NIR) light can penetrate deeply even in blood&#8208;perfused tissue and due to the intrinsic three&#8208;dimensional activation properties. Designing two&#8208;photon chromophores is challenging. However, the two&#8208;photon absorption qualities of a photocage can be improved with an intramolecular sensitizer, which transfers the absorbed light onto the cage. We herein present the synthesis and photophysical characterization of a 2P&#8208;sensitive uncaging dyad based on rhodamine 101 as donor fluorophore and a redshifted BODIPY as acceptor photocage. Liberation of p&#8208;nitroaniline (PNA) upon one&#8208;photon photolysis was confirmed by HPLC analysis. The photoreaction was found to be accompanied by a considerable change of the fluorescence properties of the chromophores. The possibility of a fluorescent readout enabled the detection of two&#8208;photon induced uncaging by confocal fluorescence microscopy.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Applications of Bicyclo[1.1.0]butyl and Azabicyclo[1.1.0]butyl Organometallics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The use of metalated (aza)bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes in synthesis is currently experiencing a renaissance, as evidenced by the numerous reports in the last 5 years that have relied on such intermediates to undergo unique transformations or generate novel fragments. Since their discovery, these species have been demonstrated to participate in a wide range of reactions with carbon and heteroatom electrophiles, as well as metal complexes, to facilitate the rapid diversification of (aza)bicyclo[1.1.0]butane&#8208;containing compounds. Key to this is the relative acidity of the bridgehead C&#8210;H bonds which promotes facile deprotonation and subsequent functionalization of an unsubstituted position on the carbon framework via the intermediacy of a metalated (aza)bicyclo[1.1.0]butane. Additionally, the late&#8208;stage incorporation of deuterium atoms in strained fragments has led to the elucidation of numerous reaction mechanisms that involve strained bicycles. The continued investigation into the inimitable reactivity of metalated bicycles will cement their importance within the field of organometallic chemistry.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A N&#8208;hydroxy succinimide (NHS)&#8208;ester substituted bis(acyl)phosphane oxide (ACTIVE&#8208;BAPO) was prepared via phospha&#8208;Michael addition and used for an easy one&#8208;step BAPO ligation with substrates containing primary amino groups such as amino acids, proteins and poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) dendrimers. Thereby a range of new molecular and polymeric photoinitators was obtained. Real&#8208;time photo&#8208;rheology experiments demonstrated the outstanding efficiency of the PAMAM BAPOs as photoinitiators for free radical polymerization. Remarkably, it is found that PAMAM BAPOs also act as crosslinking agents to convert monofunctional methacrylate monomers into thermosetting networks without any further additives. Depending on the number of the attached BAPOs, thermosets with a different degree of crosslinking and swelling capability in water were obtained.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Herein we present a systematic study of the influence of different alkyl chains in malonyl ester fullerene adducts with [10]cycloparaphenylene ([10]CPP]) and a tert&#8208;butyl (tBu) ester substituted [10]CPP analogue. The association constants between the nanoring hosts and the fullerene guests were determined by fluorescence quenching experiments. The trends in association were rationalized by an interplay of repulsion arising from an extended volume and London dispersion as an attractive counterpart.</dc:description>

         <title>Machine Learning&#8208;Guided Computational&#160;Screening of New Candidate Reactions with&#160;High Bioorthogonal Click Potential</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bioorthogonal click chemistry has become an indispensable part of the biochemist's toolbox. Despite the wide variety of applications that have been developed in recent years, only a limited number of bioorthogonal click reactions have been discovered so far, most of them based on (substituted) azides. In this work, we present a computational workflow to discover new candidate reactions with promising kinetic and thermodynamic properties for bioorthogonal click applications. Sampling only around 0.05% of an overall search space of over 10,000,000 dipolar cycloadditions, we develop a machine learning model able to predict DFT&#8208;computed activation and reaction energies within ~2&#8208;3 kcal/mol across the entire space. Applying this model to screen the full search space through iterative rounds of learning, we identify a broad pool of candidate reactions with rich structural diversity, which can be used as a starting point or source of inspiration for future experimental development of both azide&#8208;based and non&#8208;azide&#8208;based bioorthogonal click reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>CoNi2S4 Electrode with High Mass&#8208;loading for High&#8208;energy&#8208;density Supercapacitor: Role of S&#8208;containing Anions Exchange</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Anion exchange is recognized as an effective method to regulate the composition, electronic conductivity, and electrochemical behavior of the transition metal&#8208;based compounds. In this work, anion exchange is adopted as a rational post&#8208;treatment route to facilitate the capacitive activity of CoNi2S4 nanoparticle arrays grown on carbon cloth (CC) with high mass&#8208;loading. As soaked in saturated Na2S solution, the CoNi2S4/CC electrode showed an increased capacity from 483 C g&#8208;1 to 841 C g&#8208;1 at 10 mA cm&#8208;2 with excellent rate performance and stable cycling performance, which was superior to the CoNi2S4/CC electrode activated by NaBH4 reduction. Anion exchange was beneficial for enhancing the crystallinity, retaining the adhesion of nanoarrays, and realizing low resistance nature in a mild route. The as&#8208;assembled CoNi2S4/CC//activated CC hybrid supercapacitor delivered a high areal capacitance of 1.28 F cm&#8722;2 at 5 mA cm&#8208;2, and achieved an energy density of 0.58 mWh cm&#8722;2 at a power density of 4.5 mW cm&#8722;2 with excellent cycle stability with 90.6% capacity retention after 10,000 cycles.</dc:description>

         <title>Strain&#8208;Sensitive On&#8208;Surface Ladderization by Non&#8208;Dehydrogenative Heterocyclization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
On&#8208;surface non&#8208;dehydrogenative cyclization leads to low&#8208;temperature formation of pyrrolopyrrole&#8208;bridged ladder oligomer with an unprecedented high ratio of nitrogen and carbon of 1&#8201;:&#8201;4. The reaction barrier of the ladderization is sufficiently low as the small segment of the ladder units already appeared at 40&#8201;&#176;C. However, once the long linear oligomer as the intermediate is synthesized, the reaction barrier significantly increases since the orientation of the unit has to be rotated, which is the origin of the strain&#8208;sensitive on&#8208;surface ladderization.







Abstract
On&#8208;surface cyclodehydrogenation recently became an important reaction to planarize &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules and oligomers. However, the high&#8208;activation barrier to cleave the C&#8722;H bond often requires high&#8208;temperature annealing, consequently restricting structures of precursor molecules and/or leading to random fusion at their edges. Here, we present a synthesis of pyrrolopyrrole&#8208;bridged ladder oligomers from 11,11,12,12&#8208;tetrabromo&#8208;1,4,5,8&#8208;tetraaza&#8208;9,10&#8208;anthraquinodimethane molecules on Ag(111) with bond&#8208;resolved scanning tunnelling microscopy. This non&#8208;dehydrogenative cyclization between pyrazine and ethynylene/cumulene groups has a low&#8208;activation barrier for forming intermediary dimeric oligomer containing dipyrazinopyrrolopyrrolopyrazine units, thus giving new insight into the strain&#8208;sensitive in ladder&#8208;oligomer formation.

         <title>Paramagnetic Liquid Crystals With Close &#960;&#8211;&#960; Packing: The Effect of Blatter Radical Planarization on Behavior of Bent&#8208;Core Mesogens</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A diphenol containing 19&#8208;&#960; delocalized electrons was developed as a general intermediate to paramagnetic columnar and lamellar liquid crystals with close &#960;&#8211;&#960; contacts for electronic applications.







Abstract
A new, 19 &#960;&#8208;delocalized electrons planar Blatter radical building block was developed and used to obtain paramagnetic bent&#8208;core liquid crystals. The mesogens were investigated by optical, thermal, powder XRD and DFT methods in the pure form and as binary mixtures. Comparison of their properties with those of the classical Blatter radical analogues revealed that planarization of the central angular element results in a significantly higher stability of the mesophases and increased molecular organization suitable for the formation of ordered banana and columnar mesophases with tighter &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions. These results indicate access to a new, potentially rich class of functional paramagnetic soft materials.

         <title>Pro&#8208;aromaticity Enabled Dealkenylative Functionalizations via Photo&#8208;excitation and Oxidation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A general and practical approach for diverse dealkenylative functionalization of olefin&#8208;containing substrates has been developed through the one&#8208;pot formation and utilization of pro&#8208;aromatic 1,4&#8208;dihydropyridazines using tetrazine as the key cycloaddition reagent. Triggered by either excitation or oxidation, the targeted C&#8722;C bonds in the 1,4&#8208;dihydropyridazine intermediates could be readily cleaved to generate alkyl radicals for subsequent transformations. Diverse carbon&#8208;carbon and carbon&#8208;hetero bond forming protocols, including Giese&#8208;type addition, hydrazination, borylation, Minisci&#8208;type alkylation, copper&#8208;catalyzed NH alkylation, acylation, alkynylation, cyanation, and azidation, are achieved in a highly modular fashion.</dc:description>

         <title>Dual Chemiexcitation by a Unique Dioxetane Scaffold Gated by an OR Logic Set of Triggers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chemiexcitation of phenoxy&#8208;1,2&#8208;dioxetane chemiluminescent luminophores is initiated by electron transfer from a&#160;meta&#8208;positioned phenolate ion to the peroxide&#8208;dioxetane bond. Here we report the development of a unique 1,2&#8208;dioxetane chemiluminescent scaffold with chemiexcitation gated by an OR logic dual&#8208;set of triggering events. This scaffold is composed of&#160;meta&#8208;dihydroxyphenyl&#8208;1,2&#8208;dioxetane&#8208;adamantyl molecules, equipped with&#160;acrylic acid and chlorine substituents, that&#160;chemiexcitation&#160;under physiological conditions.&#160;A dual&#8208;mode chemiluminescent probe, armed with two different triggering substrates designed for activation by the enzymes&#160;&#946;&#8208;galactosidase and alkaline phosphatase, was synthesized.&#160;The probe emitted intense&#160;light signals in the response to each enzyme, demonstrating its ability to serve as a single&#8208;component chemiluminescent sensor for dual&#8208;analyte detection. We also demonstrated the ability of the probe to detect&#160;&#946;&#8208;galactosidase and of phosphatase activities in bacteria. This is the first&#160;1,2&#8208;dioxetane scaffold capable of response to two different chemiexcitation events from two different positions on the same dioxetane molecule.We anticipate that the OR&#8208;gated mode of chemiexcitation, described herein, will find utility in preparation of&#160;chemiluminescent&#160;probes with a dual&#8208;analyte detection/imaging mode.</dc:description>

         <title>SnS&#8208;SnO2 heterostructures anchored on GO as a high&#8208;performance anode for Sodium ion battery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>SnO2 is a theoretically excellent transformed anode material with high theoretical capacity for SIBs. However, SnO2 faces serious volume effect and high resistance, which greatly damages its electrochemical performance. Given that, the SnS&#8208;SnO2 heterostructures is constructed with special internal electric field, which is beneficial to promote the transfer ability of sodium ions. Besides, the graphene oxide (GO) modification is carried out to isolate intrinsic materials from direct contact with electrolyte, and alleviate volume expansion of the anode, ultimately promote the electrochemical performance. Furthermore, the structure and the conductivity characteristics of SnS, SnO2, SnS&#8208;SnO2 and SnS&#8208;SnO2@ GO are simulated respectively by first principles, and are compared with the correspondence experiment results to verify the accuracy of established models. Owing to the special p&#8208;n junction in SnS&#8208;SnO2@GO heterostructures, the resistance of SnS&#8208;SnO2@GO can be reduced to 36.23 &#937;, much lower than SnO2 (Rct=341.9 &#937;). Notably, the combination of GO effectively alleviate volume expansion of SnS&#8208;SnO2@GO electrode, and present excellent capacity higher than 384.7 mAh&#183;g&#8208;1 after 100 cycles. Thus, the efficient synthesis of SnS&#8208;SnO2@GO heterostructures and excellent performance for sodium storage is expected to provide valuable direction for SIBs anode materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Surface&#8208;stabilized CsPbI3 nanocrystals with tailored organic polymer ligand binding</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) exhibit attractive photophysical properties by combining the excellent optoelectronic properties of bulk perovskites with the strong quantum confinement effect at the nanoscale. However, CsPbI3 NCs easily transform into a non&#8208;perovskite phase because of the ionic lattice and dynamic ligand binding. Here, we report stable black&#8208;phase CsPbI3 NCs capped with a new organic ligand, HO&#8208;PS&#8208;N3 (HOPS), which consists of a polystyrene segment with hydroxyl and azide end groups. This organic polymer ligand passivated the surface defects and enhanced the stability of CsPbI3 NCs by exposing the linking hydrophobic polystyrene segment. Consequently, the optimized CsPbI3 NCs exhibit significantly improved resistance to moisture or light and maintained 70% of the original luminous intensity after immersion in water for two months. The theoretical results revealed that the binding energy of the HOPS ligand on the surface of the CsPbI3 NCs is higher than that of the commonly used oleic acid, alleviating the defects&#8208;induced degradation during purification. Thus, surface&#8208;stabilized CsPbI3 NCs are beneficial for a broad range of optoelectronic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>LiHMDS&#8208;Mediated Deprotonative Coupling of Toluenes with Ketones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lithium hexamethyldisilazide (LiHMDS) acts as an effective base for deprotonative coupling reactions of toluenes with ketones. Various functionalities are allowed on the toluenes. Notably, this system proved successful with low&#8208;reactive toluenes bearing a large pKa value compared to that of the conjugate acid of LiHMDS (hexamethyldisilazane, 25.8, THF), as demonstrated by 4&#8208;phenyltoluene (38.57, THF) and toluene itself (&#8764;43, DMSO).







Abstract
We demonstrate that lithium hexamethyldisilazide (LiHMDS) acts as an effective base for deprotonative coupling reactions of toluenes with ketones to afford stilbenes. Various functionalities (halogen, OCF3, amide, Me, aryl, alkenyl, alkynyl, SMe, and SPh) are allowed on the toluenes. Notably, this system proved successful with low&#8208;reactive toluenes bearing a large pKa value compared to that of the conjugate acid of LiHMDS (hexamethyldisilazane, 25.8, THF), as demonstrated by 4&#8208;phenyltoluene (38.57, THF) and toluene itself (&#8764;43, DMSO).

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Tandem Coupling Method for the Short&#8208;Step Formal Synthesis of Riccardin C</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A formal total synthesis of riccardin C was achieved by a sequential five&#8208;steps four&#8208;component one&#8208;pot tandem coupling method. By optimizing each step, four individual units were connected by two Sonogashira coupling reactions and one Suzuki coupling reaction, followed by diimide reduction and acid deprotection.







Abstract
One&#8208;pot reactions reduce reagent amounts and circumvent process treatments, such as work&#8208;up and purifications in multi&#8208;step reactions. In this study, we achieved the formal total synthesis of riccardin C through a one&#8208;pot reaction by simultaneously linking four units through two Sonogashira coupling reactions and one Suzuki coupling reaction, followed by reduction and deprotection. Thus, this one&#8208;pot method comprised five steps and did not require the purification of intermediate reaction mixtures, which saves resources, such as reagents and solvents, and expedites the work process.

         <title>Guanidine&#8208;Functionalized Fluorescent sp2 Carbon&#8208;Conjugated Covalent Organic Framework for Sensing and Capture of Pd(II) and Cr(VI) Ions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultra&#8208;sensitive detection, capture, and recovery/removal of Pd(II) and Cr(VI) ions by guanidine&#8208;modified fluorescent sp2 carbon&#8208;conjugated covalent organic framework is reported.







Abstract
Palladium is a key element in fuel cells, electronic industries, and organic catalysis. At the same time, chromium is essential in leather, electroplating, and metallurgical industries. However, their unpremeditated leakage into aquatic systems has caused human health and environmental apprehensions. Herein, we reported the development of an sp2 carbon&#8208;conjugated fluorescent covalent organic framework with a guanidine moiety (sp2c&#8208;gCOF) that showed excellent thermal and chemical stability. The sp2c&#8208;gCOF showed effective sensing, capture, and recovery/removal of Pd(II) and Cr(VI) ions, which could be due to the highly accessible pore walls decorated with guanidine moieties. The fluorescent sp2c&#8208;gCOF showed higher selectivity for Pd(II) and Cr(VI) ions, with an ultra&#8208;low detection limit of 2.7 and 3.2&#8197;nM, respectively. The analysis of the adsorption properties with a pseudo&#8208;second&#8208;order kinetic model showed that sp2c&#8208;gCOF could successfully and selectively remove both Pd(II) and Cr(VI) ions from aqueous solutions. The polymer also showed excellent capture efficacy even after seven consecutive adsorption&#8208;desorption cycles. Hence, this study reveals the potential of fluorescent sp2c&#8208;gCOF for detecting, removing, and recovering valuable metals and hazardous ions from wastewater, which would be useful for economic benefit, environmental safety, human health, and sustainability. The post&#8208;synthetic modification of sp2c&#8208;COF with suitable functionalities could also be useful for sensing and extracting other water pollutants and valuable materials from an aqueous system.

         <title>Dioxygen Binding Is Controlled by the Protein Environment in Non&#8208;heme FeII and 2&#8208;Oxoglutarate Oxygenases: A Study on Histone Demethylase PHF8 and an Ethylene&#8208;Forming Enzyme</title>

Local interactions: Study of dioxygen binding and 2OG coordination by using two model 2OG enzymes &#8211; a class&#8197;7 histone demethylase (PHF8) and the ethylene&#8208;forming enzyme (EFE) &#8211; showing the role played by the protein environment in dioxygen transport and how the binding mode of dioxygen in the iron center is affected by SCS interactions.







Abstract
This study investigates dioxygen binding and 2&#8208;oxoglutarate (2OG) coordination by two model non&#8208;heme FeII/2OG enzymes: a class&#8197;7 histone demethylase (PHF8) that catalyzes the hydroxylation of its H3K9me2 histone substrate leading to demethylation reactivity and the ethylene&#8208;forming enzyme (EFE), which catalyzes two competing reactions of ethylene generation and substrate l&#8208;Arg hydroxylation. Although both enzymes initially bind 2OG by using an off&#8208;line 2OG coordination mode, in PHF8, the substrate oxidation requires a transition to an in&#8208;line mode, whereas EFE is catalytically productive for ethylene production from 2OG in the off&#8208;line mode. We used classical molecular dynamics (MD), quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) MD and QM/MM metadynamics (QM/MM&#8208;MetD) simulations to reveal that it is the dioxygen binding process and, ultimately, the protein environment that control the formation of the in&#8208;line FeIII&#8208;OO&#8901;&#8722; intermediate in PHF8 and the off&#8208;line FeIII&#8208;OO&#8901;&#8722; intermediate in EFE.

         <title>Thermoresponse of Odd&#8208;Even Effect in n&#8208;Alkanethiolate Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayers on Gold Substrates
</title>

         <dc:description>
Thermoresponse of odd&#8208;even effect in alkanethiolate SAMs is investigated with contact&#8208;angle goniometry and vibrational sum frequency generation spectroscopy. The thermoresponse significantly depends on the supramolecular packing feature of SAMs, and the opposite conformational change is observed for odd and even carbon numbers.







Abstract
This study examines thermoresponse of odd&#8208;even effect in self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) of n&#8208;alkanethiolates (SCn, n=3&#8211;18) formed on template&#8208;stripped gold (AuTS) using macro&#8208; and microscopic analytical techniques, contact angle goniometry (CAG) and vibrational sum frequency generation (VSFG) spectroscopy, respectively. Both CAG and VSFG analyses showed that the odd&#8208;even effect in liquid&#8208;like SAMs (n=3&#8211;9) disappeared upon heating at 50&#8211;70&#8201;&#176;C, indicating that the heating led to increased structural disorder regardless of odd and even carbon numbers. In contrast, the opposite thermoresponse was observed for odd and even SCn molecules in wax&#8208; and solid&#8208;like SAMs (n=10&#8211;18). Namely, temperature&#8208;dependent orientational change of terminal CH3 relative to the surface normal was opposite for the odd and even molecules, thereby leading to mitigated odd&#8208;even effect. Our work offers important insights into thermoresponse of supramolecular structure in condensed organic matter.

         <title>Magneto&#8208;Structural Correlations in a Mixed Porphyrin(Cu2+)/Trityl Spin System: Magnitude, Sign, and Distribution of the Exchange Coupling Constant</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of multi&#8208;frequency continuous&#8208;wave electron paramagnetic resonance and density functional theory calculations were used to determine the magnitude, sign, and distribution of the exchange coupling constant J in a biradical consisting of a trityl radical and a copper(II)tetraphenylporphyrin. The ferromagnetic exchange coupling and its distribution are related to the structure and dynamics of the biradical.







Abstract
Tetrathiatriarylmethyl radicals (TAM or trityl) are receiving increasing attention in various fields of magnetic resonance such as imaging, dynamic nuclear polarization, spin labeling, and, more recently, molecular magnetism and quantum information technology. Here, a trityl radical attached via a phenyl bridge to a copper(II)tetraphenylporphyrin was synthesized, and its magnetic properties studied by multi&#8208;frequency continuous&#8208;wave electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy and magnetic measurements. EPR revealed that the electron spin&#8208;spin coupling constant J between the trityl and Cu2+ spin centers is ferromagnetic with a magnitude of &#8722;2.3&#8197;GHz (&#8722;0.077&#8197;cm&#8722;1, 
 convention) and a distribution width of 1.2&#8197;GHz (0.040&#8197;cm&#8722;1). With the help of density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the obtained ferromagnetic exchange coupling, which is unusual for para&#8208;substituted phenyl&#8208;bridged biradicals, could be related to the almost perpendicular orientation of the phenyl linker with respect to the porphyrin and trityl ring planes in the energy minimum, while the J distribution was rationalized by the temperature weighted rotation of the phenyl bridge about the molecular axis connecting both spin centers. This study exemplifies the importance of molecular dynamics for the homogeneity (or heterogeneity) of the magnetic properties of trityl&#8208;based systems.

         <title>Mechanistic Insights into the Metal&#8208;Free Deoxygenative Borylation of Ketones and Aldehydes with Bis(catecholato)diborane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DFT calculations on the deoxygenative triboration/monoboration of ketones and aldehydes with B2cat2 revealed that the in&#8197;situ formed 1,2&#8208;B2cat2 rather than 1,1&#8208;B2cat2 is the key borylation intermediate. The solvent N,N&#8208;dimethylacetamide plays an important role in the isomerization from 1,1&#8208; B2cat2 to 1,2&#8208;B2cat2 and promotes some intermediate processes.







Abstract
The mechanisms of direct deoxygenative borylation of acetone and benzaldehyde with bis(catecholato)diborane (B2cat2) in the solvent N,N&#8208;dimethylacetamide (DMA) are investigated through detailed density functional theory calculations. These calculations show that the isomer 1,2&#8208;B2cat2 in&#8197;situ generated from 1,1&#8208;B2cat2 induced by DMA is the reactive boron intermediate for the reactions. The addition of the B&#8722;B bond of 1,2&#8208;B2cat2 to the C=O bond of acetone or benzaldehyde via a concerted [2&#963;+2&#960;]&#8208;cycloaddition&#8208;like transition state is the rate&#8208;limiting step for both the triboration reaction of acetone and the monoboration reaction of benzaldehyde. DMA not only acts as the solvent but also promotes the structural isomerization of B2cat2, the deoxygenation of acetone to form the vinyl boronate intermediate and subsequent diboration of vinyl boronate with 1,2&#8208;B2cat2, as well as the protodeboronation of the gem&#8208;diboronate intermediate in the deoxygenative borylation of benzaldehyde. The presented computational results can explain the observed experimental facts and provide insight into the roles of the isomeric 1,2&#8208;B2cat2 and the solvent DMA in related reactions.

         <title>Role of Counterions in the Structural Stabilisation of Redox&#8208;Active Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Revealing the role of counterions: Redox&#8208;active metal&#8208;organic frameworks often rely on counterions to access specific charge states of the components. We show, through a quantum chemical investigation, that the counterion can play an important steric role in the structural stabilisation of such frameworks beyond pure charge balancing effects.







Abstract
The crystal structures of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are typically determined by the strong chemical bonds formed between the organic and inorganic building units. However, the latest generation of redox&#8208;active frameworks often rely on counterions in the pores to access specific charge states of the components. Here, we model the crystal structures of three layered MOFs based on the redox&#8208;active ligand 2,5&#8208;dihydroxybenzoquinone (dhbq): Ti2(Cl2dhbq)3, V2(Cl2dhbq)3 and Fe2(Cl2dhbq)3 with implicit and explicit counterions. Our full&#8208;potential first&#8208;principles calculations indicate that while the reported hexagonal structure is readily obtained for Ti and V, the Fe framework is stabilised only by the presence of explicit counterions. For high counterion concentrations, we observe the formation of an electride&#8208;like pocket in the pore center. An outlook is provided on the implications of solvent and counterion control for engineering the structures and properties of porous solids.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The crystal structures of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are typically determined by the strong chemical bonds formed between the organic and inorganic building units. However, the latest generation of redox-active frameworks often rely on counterions in the pores to access specific charge states of the components. Here, we model the crystal structures of three layered MOFs based on the redox-active ligand 2,5-dihydroxybenzoquinone (dhbq): Ti&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;dhbq)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;dhbq)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;dhbq)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; with implicit and explicit counterions. Our full-potential first-principles calculations indicate that while the reported hexagonal structure is readily obtained for Ti and V, the Fe framework is stabilised only by the presence of explicit counterions. For high counterion concentrations, we observe the formation of an electride-like pocket in the pore center. An outlook is provided on the implications of solvent and counterion control for engineering the structures and properties of porous solids.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enhancing the Magnetization Blocking Energy of Biradical&#8208;Metal System by Merging Discrete Complexes into One&#8208;Dimensional Chains</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The pentanuclear fragments and one&#8208;dimensional chains of 2p&#8211;3d&#8208;4f are achieved using a new nitronyl nitroxide biradical through changing reaction temperature. The different magnetic relaxation features are observed for two Dy derivatives, in which the enhanced magnetic relaxation behavior of 1D compound could be attributed to the long&#8208;range ferromagnetic interaction.







Abstract
The reaction of nitronyl nitroxide biradical NITPhMeImbis [5&#8208;(2&#8208;methylimidazole)&#8208;1,3&#8208;bis(1&#8208;oxyl&#8208;3&#8217;&#8208;oxido&#8208;4&#8217;,4&#8217;,5&#8217;,5&#8217;&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;4,5&#8208;hydro&#8208;1H&#8208;imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;benzene] with Ln(hfac)3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H2O and Cu(hfac)2 (hfac=hexafluoroacetylacetonate), led to two series of 2p&#8211;3d&#8208;4f complexes, namely, nona&#8208;spin clusters, [Ln2Cu3(hfac)12(NITPhMeImbis)2] (Ln=Gd 1, Dy 2), or one&#8208;dimensional chains [LnCu2(hfac)7(NITPhMeImbis)] (Ln=Y 3, Dy 4, Tb 5) depending on the temperature of the reaction. All five complexes contain a biradical&#8208;Ln unit in which the biradical chelates the LnIII ion by the means of one aminoxyl (i.&#8201;e. NO) group of each NIT unit. For the discrete complexes, a Cu(hfac)2 links two biradical&#8208;Ln units via one of the remaining NO groups, while for the chain compounds, the two remaining NO groups of the biradical&#8208;Ln moiety are each coordinated to a Cu(hfac)2 unit to form a 1D coordination polymer. Moreover, a terminal Cu(hfac)2 unit is coordinated to the imidazole&#8208;N atom of the NITPhMeImbis ligand. Spin dynamics investigations evidenced the onset of slow relaxation of the magnetization for 2, whereas 4 and 5 exhibit a typical single&#8208;chain magnet behavior. This highlights the vital role of the 1D spin correlation in the blocking of the magnetization. These results illustrate that from the same basic building blocks, magnetic relaxation can be carefully modulated by structural adjustments.

         <title>Guided Isolation of An Uncommon Cembranoid Orthoester, Sarcotortin A, and Three Skeletal Diverse Terpenoids from the Hainan Soft Coral Sarcophyton tortuosum Based on Molecular Networking Strategy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chemical study on the Hainan soft coral Sarcophyton tortuosum under the guidance of emerging molecular networking strategy led to the isolation and full characterization of an uncommon cembranoid orthoester, sarcotortin A (1), featuring a 3/14/8/5&#8208;fused scaffold, an unusual eunicellane&#8208;type diterpenoid, sarcotorolide A (2), and two new biscembranoids, ximaolides M and N (7 and 8).







Abstract
Applying the emerging molecular networking strategy, an uncommon cembranoid orthoester, sarcotortin A (1), featuring a 3/14/8/5&#8208;fused scaffold, an unusual eunicellane&#8208;type diterpenoid, sarcotorolide A (2), and two new biscembranoids, ximaolides M and N (7 and 8), along with nine known terpenoids 3&#8211;6 and 9&#8211;13 were isolated from the Hainan soft coral Sarcophyton tortuosum. The structure and absolute configuration of all new compounds were established by a combination of spectroscopic data, X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis, and/or quantum chemical computational approaches. The plausible biogenetic relationship among these skeletally different terpenoids was proposed and discussed. In in vitro bioassay, new compound 7 exhibited a remarkable inhibitory activity against protein tyrosine phosphatases 1B (PTP1B) with the IC50 value of 8.06&#8197;&#956;M. In addition, compounds 4 and 10 displayed significant inhibitory effects on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)&#8208;induced inflammatory responses in RAW264.7 macrophages cells with the IC50 values of 19.13 and 16.45&#8197;&#956;M, respectively. Compound 9 showed interesting cytotoxicity against H1975, MDA&#8208;MB231, A549, and H1299 cancer cell lines with IC50 values of 31.59, 34.96, 43.87, and 27.93&#8197;&#956;M, respectively.

         <title>White Light&#8208;Emitting Electrochemical Cells Employing Phosphor&#8208;Sensitized Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence to Approach All&#8208;Phosphorescent Device Efficiencies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Solid&#8208;state light&#8208;emitting electrochemical cells (LECs) show promising advantages of simple device architecture, low operation voltage, and insensitivity to the electrode work functions such that they have high potential in low&#8208;cost display and lighting applications. In this work, novel white LECs based on phosphor&#8208;sensitized thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) are proposed. The emissive layer of these white LECs is composed of a blue&#8208;green phosphorescent host doped with a deep&#8208;red TADF guest. Efficient singlet&#8208;to&#8208;triplet intersystem crossing (ISC) on the phosphorescent host and the subsequent F&#246;rster energy transfer from the host triplet excitons to guest singlet excitons can make use of both singlet and triplet excitons on the host. With the good spectral overlap between the host emission and the guest absorption, 0.075 wt.% guest doping is sufficient to cause substantial energy transfer efficiency (ca. 40%). In addition, such a low guest concentration also reduces the self&#8208;quenching effect and a high photoluminescence quantum yield of up to 84% ensures high device efficiency. The phosphor&#8208;sensitized TADF white LECs indeed show a high external quantum efficiency of 9.6%, which is comparable with all&#8208;phosphorescent white LECs. By employing diffusive substrates to extract the light trapped in the substrate, the device efficiency can be further improved by ca. 50%. In the meantime, the intrinsic EL spectrum and device lifetime of the white LECs recover since the microcavity effect is destroyed. This work successfully demonstrates that the phosphor&#8208;sensitized TADF white LECs are potential candidates for efficient white light&#8208;emitting devices.</dc:description>

On the other hand, the formal intramolecular 5-exo-anti carbopalladation/cross-coupling sequence afforded 2,3-disubstituted 4-alkylidene-4H-indeno[1,2-b]furans. The present methods provide new access to a wide range of well-organized polysubstituted naphtho[1,2-b]furans and indeno[1,2-b]furans in a positional selective manner that are otherwise difficult to access.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Double addition vs. ring closure: Systematic reactivity study of CO(NCO)2 and CO(NCS)2 towards hydrogen halides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reactivity of carbonyl diisocyanate, CO(NCO)2, and carbonyl diisothiocyanate, CO(NCS)2 with nucleophiles shows different patterns: Whereas carbonyl diisocyanate adds two equivalents of nucleophile forming carbonyl bis(carbamoylhalides), carbonyl diisothiocyanate only adds one equivalent and undergoes intramolecular ring closure, resulting in the formation of substituted thiadiazines. In this study we have reacted both carbonyl diisocyanate and carbonyl diisothiocyanate with the full series of hydrogen halides HF to HI, isolating carbonyl bis(carbamoylfluoride) (1), &#8208;chloride (2), &#8208;bromide (3), and &#8208;iodide (4) as well as (6&#8208;chloro&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2&#8208;thioxo&#8208;4H&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;thiadiazin&#8208;4&#8208;one (5), and 6&#8208;bromo&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2&#8208;thioxo&#8208;4H&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;thiadiazin&#8208;4&#8208;one (6). The compounds were analysed by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, NMR spectroscopy, IR and Raman spectroscopy, and elemental analysis. Quantum mechanical calculations show thermodynamic reasons for the differences in reactivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorescence Detection of the Persistent Organic Pollutant Chlordecone in Water at Environmental Concentrations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chlordecone (CLD), a Persistent Organic Pollutant, is still present in water and food chain of the French West Indies (FWI), leading to dramatical public health problems. One of the major issues is the lack of an easy, non&#8208;expensive, sensitive and robust method for the detection of chlordecone to ensure chlordecone&#8208;free water and foods for the residents of the FWI. Here we report on the development of a fluorescent molecular cage that allows a simple and convenient detection of chlordecone in water at environmental concentration. The specific structural features of chlordecone prompted us to choose hemicryptophanes as receptor. First, we optimized the size, shape of the cavity, as well as the recognition units, to identify the most efficient non fluorescent host for CLD complexation. Then, this selected compound was equipped with fluorophores at different positions in order to find the most efficient system for CLD detection by fluorescence. Among the two most promising fluorescent cages, the newly synthesized hemicryptophane with biphenyl moieties allowed us to develop a fast, easy, reproducible and cheap procedure to detect CLD in water. Its sensitivity and scalability, with modulation of hemicryptophane concentration enabled us to estimate CLD concentrations over five orders of magnitude (10&#8208;2 &#8208; 103 &#181;g/L) including the environmental levels of contamination and the permissible limit for drinking water in the FWI.</dc:description>

         <title>The Boekelheide Rearrangement of Pyrimidine&#8208;N&#8208;oxides as a Case Study of Closed or Open Shell Reactions &#8211; Experimental and Computational Evidence for the Participation of Radical Intermediates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In a case study, the acetic anhydride&#8208;promoted reaction of a model pyrimidine&#8208;N&#8208;oxide to the corresponding 4&#8208;acetoxymethyl&#8208;substituted pyrimidine derivative (Boekelheide rearrangement) was investigated in detail by experiment and quantum chemical calculations. The reaction conditions were varied and several side products formed in low to moderate yields were identified. These experiments indicate that a (pyrimidin&#8208;4&#8208;yl)methyl radical is one of the key species of the rearrangement. This interpretation was supported by the fact that rearrangements performed in solvents which can easily lose hydrogen atoms, afford considerable quantities of products incorporating the solvent. With TEMPO the key radical could be trapped. Other carboxylic acid anhydrides confirm the conclusion that the Boekelheide rearrangement of the model pyrimidine&#8208;N&#8208;oxide proceeds, at least in part, via radical intermediates. The high level closed and open shell quantum chemical calculations show that concerted [3,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangements or stepwise processes, either via ion pairs or via radicals, are energetically feasible.</dc:description>

         <title>Thiophosphinoyl&#8208;Tethered Ylide&#8208;Substituted Heavier Carbenes: Synthesis, Structures and Stabilities</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis and structure analysis of a series of mono and diylide&#8208;substituted tetrylenes of type YEX and Y2E (E = Ge, Sn, Pb; X = Cl or Br) using a thiophosphinoyl&#8208;tethered metallated ylide (Y = Ph2P(S)&#8208;C&#8208;P(pip)Ph2 with pip = piperidyl) is reported, amongst the first ylide&#8208;substituted plumbylenes. The tetrylenes feature distinct trends in the spectroscopic and structural properties of the ylide ligand with increasing atomic number of the tetrel element. For instance, an increasingly high&#8208;field shifted signal for the phosphonium group is observed in the 31P&#8208;NMR spectrum as a consequence of the increasing polarity of the element&#8208;carbon bond, which likewise results in a shortening of the ylidic C&#8208;P bond in the solid&#8208;state structure. The diylidyltetrylenes are unstable towards transylidation forming the mono(ylide)tetrylenes when treated with the tetrel dihalides according to the stability trend: Y2Pb &lt; Y2Sn &lt; Y2Ge &lt; YPbBr &lt; YSnCl &lt; YGeCl. Starting from the monoylide&#8208;substituted chlorotertrylenes the first unsymmetrical diylidyltetrylenes of type YEY&#8217; can be accessed, whose solid&#8208;state structures revealed that not the C&#8208;E but the S&#8208;E bond to the thiophosphinoyl group is most affected by the second ylide substituent.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanistic Insights into Enhanced Hydrogen Evolution of CrOx/Rh Nanoparticles for Photocatalytic Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) of Rh nanoparticles (RhNP) coated with an ultrathin layer of Cr&#8208;oxides (CrOx) was investigated as a model electrode for the Cr2O3/Rh&#8208;metal core&#8208;shell&#8208;type cocatalyst system for photocatalytic water splitting. The CrOx layer was electrodeposited over RhNP on a transparent conductive fluorine&#8208;doped tin oxide (FTO) substrate. The CrOx layer on RhNP facilitates the electron transfer process at the CrOx/RhNP interface, leading to the increased current density for the HER. Impedance spectroscopic analysis revealed that the CrOx layer transferred protons via the hopping mechanism to the RhNP surface for HER. In addition, CrOx restricted electron transfer from the FTO to the electrolyte and/or RhNP and suppressed the backward reaction by limiting oxygen migration. This study clarifies the crucial role of the ultrathin CrOx layer on nanoparticulate cocatalysts and provides a cocatalyst design strategy for realizing efficient photocatalytic water splitting.</dc:description>

         <title>A pH&#8208;Activatable Prodrug and Metal Prodrug Conjugate of Gossypol: Synthesis, Emergent Photophysical, Nanoscopic, Computational, and in vitro Cellular Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The major hurdle to the success of many potent chemotherapeutic drugs is the lack of stability for their active form suited for a particular mode of action. Efforts are needed to stabilize such functionalities by employing new and novel strategies to overcome such challenges. In this study, tumor&#8208;environment&#8208;specific, pH&#8208;activatable prodrugs and metal&#8208;prodrug conjugates have been developed to ameliorate the side effects of chemotherapeutic drugs bearing reactive functionalities. As a proof of concept, a pre&#8208;clinically tested natural compound gossypol was modified to form a pH&#8208;responsive prodrug by incorporating imine linkage amenable to form confined molecular structures through coordination with a bio&#8208;relevant and non&#8208;toxic zinc metal ion. Detailed photophysical, computational, and nanoscopic studies revealed the unique zinc ion coordination behavior and its effect on molecular confinement. Computational studies demonstrated that an increasing degree of complexation, with Zn&#8208;N&#8208;Py coordination, gradually turns off fluorescence by reducing the band gap that allows nonradiative decay. In vitro prodrug activation and release of gossypol from gossyzid and gossyzid&#8208;Zn were assessed by ESI&#8208;MS and RP&#8208;HPLC studies.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The major hurdle to the success of many potent chemotherapeutic drugs is the lack of stability for their active form suited for a particular mode of action. Efforts are needed to stabilize such functionalities by employing new and novel strategies to overcome such challenges. In this study, tumor-environment-specific, pH-activatable prodrugs and metal-prodrug conjugates have been developed to ameliorate the side effects of chemotherapeutic drugs bearing reactive functionalities. As a proof of concept, a pre-clinically tested natural compound gossypol was modified to form a pH-responsive prodrug by incorporating imine linkage amenable to form confined molecular structures through coordination with a bio-relevant and non-toxic zinc metal ion. Detailed photophysical, computational, and nanoscopic studies revealed the unique zinc ion coordination behavior and its effect on molecular confinement. Computational studies demonstrated that an increasing degree of complexation, with Zn-N-Py coordination, gradually turns off fluorescence by reducing the band gap that allows nonradiative decay. In vitro prodrug activation and release of gossypol from gossyzid and gossyzid-Zn were assessed by ESI-MS and RP-HPLC studies. The gossyzid and gossyzid-Zn demonstrated pH-specific cytotoxicity validated by the number of in vitro cellular assays. Such a strategy can essentially be adapted to strengthen many chemotherapeutic drugs to enhance their efficacy and reduce related side effects.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

A new method for the efficient synthesis of diarylmethanes via a radical process involving thermolysis of bis(arylmethyl)tin dichlorides in the presence of arenes is reported. The intermediate arylmethyl radical can be trapped with TEMPO.







Abstract
The oxidative&#8208;addition reaction between an arylmethyl chloride (RCH2Cl; R=1&#8208;C10H7, 2,4,6&#8208;Me3C6H2, 4&#8208;MeC6H4, 3&#8208;MeC6H4, C6H5, 4&#8208;ClC6H4) and tin powder in boiling toluene produces bis(arylmethyl)tin dichlorides, [(RCH2)2SnCl2] in good yields. At 160&#8201;&#176;C in mesitylene bis(1&#8208;naphthylmethyl)tin dichloride undergoes Sn&#8722;C homolytic cleavage to generate two 1&#8208;naphthylmethyl radicals (1&#8208;C10H7CH2&#8901;) which were trapped by TEMPO (C9H8NO&#8901;). Subsequently, the radicals (RCH2&#8901;) produced in this manner were utilized for efficient substitution reactions with electron&#8208;rich arenes (R&#8242;H; R&#8242;=2,4,6&#8208;Me3C6H2, 1,2,4,5&#8208;Me4C6H, 1,2,3,4,5&#8208;Me5C6) to obtain a variety of unsymmetrical diarylmethanes (RR&#8242;CH2). The addition of one equivalent of iodine (I2) to the reaction mixture resulted in a significant increase in the yields of coupled products.

One main method for the access of organofluorine compounds is the trifluoromethylative functionalization of an olefin bond, which simultaneously introduces a functional group and a trifluoromethyl element into an olefin framework. This review provides a concise overview of this powerful and versatile method.







Abstract
Organofluorine chemistry has become an expanding area of research in organic chemistry and drug design. The synthesis of fluorine&#8208;containing molecules has received high significance in synthetic chemistry. Trifluoromethylative difunctionalizations of carbon&#8208;carbon multiple bonds with the simultaneous introduction of a CF3 group and another function have considerable relevance. Because of the high importance of carbon&#8208;carbon bond&#8208;forming reactions in organic synthesis, carbotrifluoromethylations are considered to be a field of synthetic chemistry of increasing importance. Our current goal in this review is to summarize recent developments of various trifluoromethylation reactions (excluding aryl&#8208; and alkynyl&#8208;trifluoromethylations) taking into consideration several main approaches, such as alkenyltrifluoromethylation, alkyltrifluoromethylation, carbonyltrifluoromethylation, and cyanotrifluoromethylation reactions.

Oligofuran. A series of coplanar polyaryl&#8208;functionalized &#945;&#8208;oligofurans, in which aryl groups are introduced precisely into each of the furan units, are rapidly and efficiently synthesized by de novo metal&#8208;free synthesis of &#945;&#8208;bi(arylfuran) monomers. The characterization of &#945;&#8208;oligo(arylfuran)s demonstrates that photoelectric properties of coplanar &#945;&#8208;oligo(arylfuran)s can be tuned through varying aryl groups with different electrical properties. These novel &#945;&#8208;oligo(arylfuran)s have good hole transport capacity and can function as hole&#8208;transporting layers in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes, which is indicative of significant breakthrough in the application of &#945;&#8208;oligofurans materials in OLEDs. And our findings offer an avenue for the ingenious use of &#945;&#8208;oligofurans as p&#8208;type organic semiconductors for OLEDs.







Abstract
Tuning the photophysical properties of &#960;&#8208;conjugated oligomers by functionalization of skeleton, to achieve an optically and electronically advantageous building block for organic semiconductor materials is a vital yet challenging task. In this work, a series of structurally well&#8208;defined polyaryl&#8208;functionalized &#945;&#8208;oligofurans, in which aryl groups are introduced precisely into each of the furan units, are rapidly and efficiently synthesized by de novo metal&#8208;free synthesis of &#945;&#8208;bi(arylfuran) monomers for the first time. This new synthetic strategy nicely circumvents the cumbersome substituent introduction process in the later stage by the preinstallation of the desired aryl groups in the starting material. The characterization of &#945;&#8208;oligo(arylfuran)s demonstrates that photoelectric properties of coplanar &#945;&#8208;oligo(arylfuran)s can be tuned through varying aryl groups with different electrical properties.

         <title>Enantioselective and Chemoselective Phosphine Oxide&#8208;catalyzed Aldol Reactions of N&#8208;Unprotected Cyclic Carboxyimides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The catalytic asymmetric aldol reaction of N&#8208;unprotected cyclic carboxyimides has been achieved. Silicon tetrachloride acts in&#8197;situ as a protecting and mediating reagent and is converted to a nucleophilic species for the aldol reaction. The use of a chiral phosphine oxide catalyst can achieve enantioselective aldol reactions (up to 91/9 dr and 97/3 er) of various N&#8208;unprotected cyclic carboxyimides, including succinimides, hydantoins and glitazones.







Abstract
Asymmetric catalytic transformations of N&#8208;unprotected cyclic carboxyimides such as succinimides, hydantoins, oxazolidinediones, and glitazones, is a powerful way of directly accessing variety of biologically valuable chiral compounds. Herein, a bis(trichlorosilyl) nucleophilic intermediate formed from cyclic carboxyimides was reacted with aldehydes via (S)&#8208;SEGPHOS dioxide (SEGPHOSO), proceeding the aldol reaction in highly enantioselective fashion through a cyclic transition state. Furthermore, N&#8208;unprotected carboxyimides were chemoselectively activated, even in the presence of N&#8208;alkylated carboxyimides, to undergo stereoselective and chemoselective aldol reactions via in&#8197;situ silicon tetrachloride activation. The functionalized cyclic carboxyimides is readily derived to the several synthetic units derivatization to various chiral building blocks without unnecessary protection/deprotection steps.

         <title>Insights into the Photodynamics of Fluorescence Emission and Singlet Oxygen Generation of Fluorogen Activating Protein&#8208;Malachite Green Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Malachite green will rapidly decay to ground state via internal conversion after excitation, since the free rotation significantly decreases the energy level of the excited state. However, after binding with the fluorogen activating protein, the interaction will greatly restrict the excited&#8208;state rotation and allow the fluorescence turn&#8208;on and 1O2 generation.







Abstract
The self&#8208;assembled fluorogen activating protein (FAP)&#8208;malachite green (MG) complex is a well&#8208;established protein&#8208;ligand system, which can realize binding&#8208;caused fluorescence turn&#8208;on of MG and singlet oxygen (1O2) generation by MG iodination. To clarify the mechanism of fluorescence activation and 1O2 generation, the photodynamics of different halogen&#8208;substituted MG derivatives and their corresponding FAP&#8208;MG complexes were studied by femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy and theoretical computations. The results show that the rotation of MG is restricted by FAP binding, which prevents a rapid internal conversion to allow a longer lifetime for the excited MG to undergo fluorescence emission and intersystem crossing. Moreover, these FAP&#8208;MG complexes exhibit notably varied fluorescence quantum yields (&#934;FL) and 1O2 yields. The study on the decay pathways indicates that such an anti&#8208;heavy atom effect predominately stems from the lifetimes of the excited&#8208;state species. The photodynamic mechanism study here will lead to more advanced FAP&#8208;MG systems with high spatiotemporal resolution.

         <title>Reversing the Bond Length Alternation Order in Conjugated Polyenes by Substituent Effects</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bond lengths are widely utilised as observable structure parameters to estimate the contributions of particular resonance structures. Herein, it is demonstrated that outstandingly strong electron&#8208;withdrawing groups can reverse the textbook bond&#8208;length alternation order in polyene systems. This is a pronounced aberration from the molecular structure predicted by the neutral Lewis resonance form.







Abstract
We have synthesised several push&#8208;pull substituted conjugated polyenes and determined their accurate C&#8722;C bond lengths and charge&#8208;density distributions by utilising quantum crystallographic techniques. In a series of alkene, dienes, and triene bearing two (trifluoromethyl)sulfonyl (triflyl) groups on the terminal carbon atom, unique reversal of the bond&#8208;length alternation (BLA) order has been observed. This is a pronounced aberration from the molecular structure predicted by the Lewis&#8208;structure&#8208;based neutral resonance structure. Such reversal of BLA order has not been observed in push&#8208;pull compounds bearing conventional electron&#8208;withdrawing groups such as carbonyl and cyano groups instead of triflyl groups. Bonding behaviour of both normal and reversed bond length alternating systems has been revealed by complementary bonding analysis using several bond descriptors based on the experimentally fitted wavefunctions.

         <title>Two Rings Around One Ball: Stability and Charge Localization of [1&#8201;:&#8201;1] and [2&#8201;:&#8201;1] Complex Ions of [10]CPP and C60/70[*]</title>

Stability and charge distribution of [1&#8201;:&#8201;1] and [2&#8201;:&#8201;1] complex ions of [10]cycloparaphenylene with C60 and C70 are studied in energy resolved gas&#8208;phase collision experiments. The novel [2&#8201;:&#8201;1] complexes are also found in solution. Thermodynamic insight is obtained by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) measurements. DFT analyses as well as molecular dynamics calculations support the experimental data.







Abstract
We investigate the gas&#8208;phase chemistry of noncovalent complexes of [10]cycloparaphenylene ([10]CPP) with C60 and C70 by means of atmospheric pressure photoionization and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. The literature&#8208;known [1&#8201;:&#8201;1] complexes, namely [10]CPP&#8835;C60 and [10]CPP&#8835;C70, are observed as radical cations and anions. Their stability and charge distribution are studied using energy&#8208;resolved collision&#8208;induced dissociation (ER&#8208;CID). These measurements reveal that complexes with a C70 core exhibit a greater stability and, on the other hand, that the radical cations are more stable than the respective radical anions. Regarding the charge distribution, in anionic complexes charges are exclusively located on C60 or C70, while the charges reside on [10]CPP in the case of cationic complexes. [2&#8201;:&#8201;1] complexes of the ([10]CPP2&#8835;C60/70)+&#8901;/&#8722;&#8901; type are observed for the first time as isolated solitary gas&#8208;phase species. Here, C60&#8208;based [2&#8201;:&#8201;1] complexes are less stable than the respective C70 analogues. By virtue of the high stability of cationic [1&#8201;:&#8201;1] complexes, [2&#8201;:&#8201;1] complexes show a strongly reduced stability of the radical cations. DFT analyses of the minimum geometries as well as molecular dynamics calculations support the experimental data. Furthermore, our novel gas&#8208;phase [2&#8201;:&#8201;1] complexes are also found in 1,2&#8208;dichlorobenzene. Insights into the thermodynamic parameters of the binding process as well as the species distribution are derived from isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) measurements.

         <title>Bimetallic Nickel Complexes Supported by a Planar Macrocyclic Diphosphoranide Ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nickel promotes the formation of a highly unusual planar dinucleating macrocycle PONNOPONNO. Bimetallic dinickel complexes of PONNOPONNO contain direct metal&#8208;metal interactions and trans reactive sites. Control over the ligand architecture is obtained by tuning the substituents and reaction conditions to favour dinucleating macrocyclic, mononucleating macrocyclic or traditional pincer architectures.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;metal cooperativity is emerging as an important strategy in catalysis. This requires appropriate ligand scaffolds that can support two metals in close proximity. Here we report nickel&#8208;promoted formation of a dinucleating planar macrocyclic ligand that can support bimetallic dinickel(II) and dinickel(I) complexes. Reaction outcomes can be tuned by variation of the substituents and reaction conditions to favour dinucleating macrocyclic, mononucleating macrocyclic or conventional pincer architectures.

         <title>A Versatile Step&#8208;Growth Polymerization Route to Functional Polyesters from an Activated Diester Monomer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Step&#8208;by&#8208;step: A versatile and efficient step&#8208;growth polymerization route is described for the synthesis of well&#8208;defined functional polyesters with predictable molecular weight and low dispersity by organocatalyzed transesterification of activated pentafluorophenyl (PFP) ester of adipic acid with structurally diverse diols under mild reaction conditions.







Abstract
This work describes a versatile and efficient condensation polymerization route to aliphatic polyesters by organo&#8208;catalyzed (4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridine) transesterification reactions between an activated pentafluorophenyl&#8208;diester of adipic acid and structurally different diols. By introducing &#8220;monofunctional impurity&#8221; or &#8220;stoichiometric imbalance,&#8221; this methodology can afford well&#8208;defined end&#8208;functionalized polyesters with predictable molecular weights and narrow dispersity under mild conditions without any necessity for the removal of the byproducts to accelerate the polymerization reaction, which remains a major challenge in conventional polyester synthesis with non&#8208;activated diesters. Wide substrate scope with structurally different monomers and the synthesis of block copolymers by chain extension following either ring&#8208;opening polymerization or controlled radical polymerization have been successfully demonstrated. Some of the polyesters synthesized by this newly introduced approach show high thermal stability, crystallinity, and enzymatic degradation in aqueous environments.

&lt;p&gt;This work describes a versatile and efficient condensation polymerization route to aliphatic polyesters by organo-catalyzed (4-dimethylaminopyridine) transesterification reactions between an activated pentafluorophenyl-diester of adipic acid and structurally different diols. By introducing &#8220;monofunctional impurity&#8221; or &#8220;stoichiometric imbalance,&#8221; this methodology can afford well-defined end-functionalized polyesters with predictable molecular weights and narrow dispersity under mild conditions without any necessity for the removal of the byproducts to accelerate the polymerization reaction, which remains a major challenge in conventional polyester synthesis with non-activated diesters. Wide substrate scope with structurally different monomers and the synthesis of block copolymers by chain extension following either ring-opening polymerization or controlled radical polymerization have been successfully demonstrated. Some of the polyesters synthesized by this newly introduced approach show high thermal stability, crystallinity, and enzymatic degradation in aqueous environments.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Solvato&#8208;Controlled Assembly and Structural Transformation of Emissive Poly&#8208;NHC&#8208;Based Organometallic Cages and Their Applications in Amino Acid Sensing and Fluorescence Imaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Stimuli&#8208;induced structural transformation of supramolecular cages has drawn increasing attention because of their sensitive feature to external variations as model systems to simulate biological processes. However, combining structural transformation and useful functions has remained a difficult task. In this study, we report the solvato&#8208;controlled self&#8208;assembly of two unique topologies with different emission characteristics, a water&#8208;soluble Ag8L4 cage (A) and an Ag4L2 cage (B), produced from the same sulfonate&#8208;pendant tetraphenylethene (TPE) bridged tetrakis&#8208;(1,2,4&#8208;triazolium) ligand. Both cages showed interesting solvent&#8208;responsive reversible structural transformation, and the change of fluorescence signals can efficiently track the process. Additionally, water&#8208;soluble cage A exhibits unique properties in thermochromism, thiol amino acid sensing, and subcellular imaging in aqueous media.</dc:description>

         <title>Coinage Metal Bis(amidinate) Complexes as Building Blocks for Self&#8208;assembled One&#8208;Dimensional Coordination Polymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The pyridyl functionalized amidinate [{PyC&#8801;CC(NDipp)2}Li(thf)2]n was used to synthesize a series of bis&#8208;amidinate complexes [{PyC&#8801;CC(NDipp)2}2M2] (M = Cu, Ag, Au) with fully supported metallophilic interactions. These metalloligands were then used as building blocks for the synthesis of one&#8208;dimensional heterobimetallic coordination polymers using Zn(hfac)2 (hfac = hexaflouroacetylacetonate) for self&#8208;assembly. Interestingly, the three coordination polymers [{PyC&#8801;CC(NDipp)2}2M2][Zn(hfac)2] (M = Cu, Ag, Au), exhibit a zig zag shape in the solid state. To achieve linear coordination geometry other connectors such as M&#8217;(acac) (M&#8217; = Ni, Co) (acac = acetylacetonate) were investigated. The thus obtained compounds [{PyC&#8801;CC(NDipp)2}2Cu2][M&#8217;(acac)2] (M&#8217; = Ni, Co) are indeed linear heterobimetallic coordination polymers featuring a metalloligand backbone with fully supported metallophilic interactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Black Titania and Niobia within Ten Minutes &#8211; Mechanochemical Reduction of Metal Oxides with Alkali Metal Hydrides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Partially or fully reduced transition metal oxides show extraordinary electronic and catalytic properties but are usually prepared by high temperature reduction reactions. Here we report the systematic investigation of the fast mechanochemical reduction of rutile&#8208;type TiO2 and H&#8208;Nb2O5 to their partially reduced black counterparts applying NaH and LiH as reducing agents. Milling time and oxide to reducing agent ratio show a large influence on the final amount of reduced metal ions in the materials. For both oxides LiH shows a higher reducing potential than NaH. An intercalation of Li+ in the structure of the oxides was proven by PXRD and subsequent Rietveld refinements as well as 6Li solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy. The products showed a decreased band gap and the presence of unpaired electrons as observed by EPR spectroscopy, proving the successful reduction of Ti4+ and Nb5+. Furthermore, the developed material exhibits a significantly enhanced photocatalytic performance towards the degradation of methylene blue compared to the pristine oxides. The presented method is a general, time efficient and simple method to obtain reduced transition metal oxides.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>TBAI&#8208;catalysed [4 + 4]&#8208;cyclization reaction of anthranils with hydrazones to deliver oxa&#8208;bridged eight&#8208;membered heterocycles in accepted yields was developed. Preliminary mechanistic studies indicated that the reaction involved the in&#8208;situ generation of vinyldiazenes from readily available hydrazones followed by an aza&#8208;Michael addition of the anthranil substrates onto the vinyldiazenes and subsequent annulation. This transformation involved the formation of two new C&#8208;N bonds and C&#8208;O bond in one pot, overcoming the synthetic limitations of anthranils in organic chemistry. This strategy benefits from high efficiency and atomic economy with mild reaction conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>The Full Cytosine&#8208;Cytosine Base Paring: Self&#8208;assembly and Crystal Structure</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of self&#8208;assembly systems that can mimic partial biological behaviours require ingenious and delicate design. For decades, scientists are committed to exploring new base pairing patterns using hydrogen bonds directed assembly of nucleotides. A fundamental question is the adaptive circumstance of the recognition between base pairs, namely, how solvent conditions affect the domain of base pairs. Towards this question, three nucleotide complexes based on 2&#8217;&#8208;deoxycytidine&#8208;5&#8217;&#8208;monophosphate (dCMP) and cytidine&#8208;5&#8217;&#8208;monophosphate (CMP) were synthesized in different solvents and pH values, and an unusual cytosine&#8208;cytosine base paring (named full C : C base pairing) were successfully obtained. Systematic single crystal analysis and 1H&#8208;NMR titration spectra have been performed to explore factors influencing the formation of base paring patterns. Moreover, supramolecular chirality of three complexes were studied using circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy in solution and solid&#8208;state combined with crystal structure analysis.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis of spiroketals have gained attention because of their importance in chemical and biological reactions. Yet, the mechanistic investigation of mild acid&#8208;catalyzed spiroketalization remains elusive and less explored in the literature and speculated that such transformations may proceed through the oxocarbenium ion intermediate; however, the existence of such species in spiroketalization are not documented. The computational study has been performed at M062X/6 &#8211; 31 + G(d) level to examine the kinetically controlled product formation for such reactions and the intrinsic reaction coordinates of 1d suggests that the reaction proceeds via a one&#8208;step, two&#8208;stage&#160;mechanism with the formation of transient oxocarbenium as a hidden intermediate&#160;in the reaction. This study reveals the stereoelectronic interactions devoid the formation of stable oxocarbenium ion intermediate after the proton transfer transition state in the case of mid acid catalyzed spiroketalization process.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The electronic properties of a hexaphyrin was fine&#8208;tuned via core&#8208;modification leading to the formation of a H&#252;ckel aromatic 30&#960; hexaphyrin which incorporates two pyrrole and four furan rings in the &#960;&#8208;conjugated pathway. This H&#252;ckel aromatic hexaphyrin modified its conformation upon two&#8208;electron ring oxidation either with triflic acid or Meerwein salt [Et3O]+[SbCl6]&#8208; to yield 28&#960; M&#246;bius aromatic dication species. Reversible aromatic transition was established by spectroscopic techniques and further supported by quantum chemical calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Site&#8208;Selective Unnatural Amino Acid Incorporation at Single or Multiple Positions to Control Sugar&#8208;Protein Connectivity in Glycoconjugate Vaccine Candidates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Antigen&#8208;carrier connectivity, if controlled, can help improving immunological response to glycoconjugate vaccines. In this work, it is shown that a site&#8208;selectively triple conjugated vaccine candidate against Streptococcus pneumoniae presents a better antigenicity than its randomly conjugated counterpart.







Abstract
In cellulo site&#8208;specific unnatural amino acid incorporation based on amber stop codon reassignment is a powerful tool to modify proteins at defined positions. This technique is herein applied to the selective functionalization of the Pneumococcal surface adhesin A protein at three distinct positions. N&#1013;&#8208;propargyloxycarbonyl&#8208;l&#8208;lysine residues were incorporated and their alkyne groups reacted using click&#8208;chemistry with a synthetic azido&#8208;functionalized tetrasaccharide representative of one repeat unit of the Streptococcus pneumoniae serotype 14 capsular polysaccharide. Anti&#8208;PsaA antibody response induced in mice by the trivalent glycoconjugate was determined in comparison with corresponding monovalent and randomly functionalized conjugates. Our results suggest that controlled was superior to random conjugation for preserving antigenicity. In definitive, the reported strategy offers a unique opportunity to study the impact of carbohydrate antigen&#8208;carrier protein connectivity on immunogenicity.

         <title>Green and Fast Strategies for Energy&#8208;Efficient Preparation of the Covalent Organic Framework TpPa&#8208;1</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Optimized synthesis for sustainable TpPa&#8208;1. Three strategies for organic solvent&#8208;free syntheses of covalent organic framework TpPa&#8208;1 have been developed. Improved textural properties and yields were achieved through a modified two&#8208;step mechanochemical synthesis. The water&#8208;based solvothermal synthesis with reaction times reduced more than 100&#8208;fold by microwave assistance makes it a more energy&#8208;efficient and less expensive process.







Abstract
Three synthesis procedures for the covalent&#8208;organic framework (COF) TpPa&#8208;1 are studied with the purpose of setting up the most promising one in a fast and green way, leading to a more environmentally friendly and sustainable process. With conventional heating, good crystallinity and a high BET specific surface area (SSA) of up to 1007&#8197;m2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1 are achieved at 170&#8201;&#176;C for 3&#8197;days using water as the quintessential green solvent. However, the application of microwave radiation in the synthesis for this crystalline porous polymer allows reaction times to be shortened to 30&#8197;min while maintaining structural and textural properties (BET SSA of 928&#8197;m2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1) and obtaining yields close to 98&#8201;% (vs. 90&#8201;% in the hydrothermal synthesis). The water&#8208;assisted mechanochemical synthesis is also an environmentally friendly synthetic approach; with heating at 170&#8201;&#176;C in a two&#8208;step process (10+10&#8197;min), high crystallinity is achieved, a BET SSA of 960&#8197; m2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1 and a yield of 98&#8201;% for TpPa&#8208;1.

         <title>Supramolecular Aggregation Control in Polyoxometalates Covalently Functionalized with Oligoaromatic Groups</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of Dawson type molecular metal oxides covalently functionalized with oligoaromatic groups is reported using a facile CLICK chemistry approach. The supramolecular chemistry of these organic&#8208;inorganic hybrids as well as their interactions with model photosensitizers are studied as basis for photoinduced electron transfer and storage systems.







Abstract
CLICK&#8208;chemistry has become a universal route to covalently link organic molecules functionalized with azides and alkynes, respectively. Here, we report how CLICK&#8208;chemistry can be used to attach oligoaromatic organic moieties to Dawson&#8208;type polyoxometalates. In step one, the lacunary Dawson anion [&#945;2&#8208;P2W17O61]6&#8722; is functionalized with phosphonate anchors featuring peripheral azide groups. In step two, this organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid undergoes microwave&#8208;assisted CLICK coupling. We demonstrate the versatility of this route to access a series of Dawson anions covalently functionalized with oligoaromatic groups. The supramolecular chemistry and aggregation of these systems in solution is explored, and we report distinct changes in charge&#8208;transfer behavior depending on the size of the oligoaromatic &#960;&#8208;system.

         <title>The Role of the Redox Non&#8208;Innocent Hydroxyl Ligand in the Activation of O2 Performed by [Ni(H)(OH)]+</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanism of dioxygen activation by [Ni(H)(OH)]+ was studied by a state&#8208;of&#8208;art multiconfigurational calculations. The role of redox&#8208;non&#8208;innocent hydroxyl in [Ni(H)(OH)]+ was elucidated, that is an energy reservoir instead of being the reaction center as what most of bioinorganic complexes show.







Abstract
The cationic complex [Ni(H)(OH)]+ was previously found to activate dioxygen and methane in gas phase under single collision conditions. These remarkable reactivities were thought to originate from a non&#8208;classical electronic structure, where the Ni&#8208;center adopts a Ni(II), instead of the classically expected Ni(III) oxidation state by formally accepting an electron from the hydroxo ligand, which formally becomes a hydroxyl radical in the process. Such radicaloid oxygen moieties are envisioned to easily react with otherwise inert substrates, mimicking familiar reactivities of free radicals. In this study, the reductive activation of dioxygen by [Ni(H)(OH)]+ to afford the hydroperoxo species was investigated using coupled cluster, multireference ab initio and density functional theory calculations. Orbital and wave function analyses indicate that O2 binding tranforms the aforementioned non&#8208;classical electronic structure to a classical Ni(III)&#8208;hydroxyl system, before O2 reduction takes place. Remarkably, we found no evidence for a direct involvement of the radicaloid hydroxyl in the reaction with O2, as is often assumed. The function of the redox non&#8208;innocent character of the activator complex is to protect the reactive electronic structure until the complex engages O2, upon which a dramatic electronic reorganization releases internal energy and drives the chemical reaction to completion.

         <dc:description>This study reports on the design and engineering of biohybrid microswimmers exploiting a thiol&#8208;mediated self&#8208;immolative antibiotic release strategy. The design features a covalent attachment of a vancomycin conjugate via a disulfide&#8208;based linker to the surface of the microalgae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. The antibiotic release from the surface of these biohybrids was triggered by the addition of a thiol&#8208;based reducing agent, and, subsequently, the inhibition of bacterial growth was observed for Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus. These engineered microbots represent the first example of a microalgae&#8208;based drug delivery system with a thiol&#8208;mediated, reductive release of an antibiotic drug.</dc:description>

         <title>Construction of Y&#8208;Doped BiVO4 Photocatalysts for Efficient Two&#8208;Electron O2 Reduction to H2O2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photocatalytic hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production on BiVO4 photocatalysts using water and oxygen as raw materials is a green and sustainable process. However, the photocatalytic efficiency of pristine BiVO4 is limited by severe charge recombination. In this work, the rare earth element Yttrium (Y) doped BiVO4 photocatalysts are fabricated via the hydrothermal method. In the photocatalytic H2O2 production experiment, the optimized Y&#8208;doped BiVO4 photocatalyst produces 114 &#181;mol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1 of H2O2 under simulated sunlight (AM1.5) irradiation, which is four times that of pure BiVO4 (26 &#181;mol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1). Density functional theory (DFT) calculation reveals that Y doping can enhance oxygen adsorption on the BiVO4 photocatalyst surface. Mechanistic investigations suggest that the doping process induces the in situ formation of monoclinic/tetragonal BiVO4 heterojunction, which further promotes the photogenerated carriers separation efficiency.</dc:description>

         <title>Neutral Monodentate and Hypervalent Chalcogen Bond Catalysis on the Intramolecular Rauhut&#8208;Currier Reaction of Bis(enones): A DFT Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently, the green and high efficient of chalcogen bond (ChB) catalysis has been aroused great interest. In this work, the ChB catalysis has been applied to the intramolecular Rauhut&#8208;Currier (RC) reaction of bis(enones). The mechanism was divided into four processes: the promoter addition process, the carbon&#8208;carbon bond coupling process, the hydrogen transfer process, and the promoter elimination process. This study shows that the ChB catalyst could act on the promoter and reactant in the RC reaction, respectively. And the path2 of ChB catalyst direct acting on the reactant is considered to be a relatively favorable channel of the reaction due to a lower energy barrier. In addition, all six catalysts could achieve good catalytic effect. Analysis of the properties shows that the formation of chalcogen bond mainly promotes the charge transfer of LP(O) &#8208; BD*(C&#8208;Se) in the carbon&#8208;carbon bond formation (key step), so that the charge of C(4) atom become more positive, thereby accelerating the reaction.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;pot Synthesis of Phosphorus&#8208;modified ZSM&#8208;5 Zeolite by Solid&#8208;state Method and its MTO Catalytic Performance</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A green and efficient strategy for synthesizing phosphorus modified ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite is proposed by grinding phosphorus source, silicon source and aluminum source with the solvent&#8208;free conditions. Phosphorus&#8208;modified ZSM&#8208;5 zeolites exhibited higher light olefin selectivity and longer catalytic lifetime (33&#8197;h) in methanol to olefin reaction when the weight hourly space velocity was 4&#8197;h&#8722;1.







Abstract
The traditional hydrothermal synthesis strategy of ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite is energy&#8208;consumption accompanying by pollution issues. Herein, phosphorus&#8208;modified layered ZSM&#8208;5 zeolites (PZ) were obtained by one&#8208;pot synthesis under solvent&#8208;free conditions. The synthesized samples were fully characterized by XRD, SEM, BET, NH3&#8208;TPD and FTIR. The effect of phosphorus addition on the morphology and catalytic activity of ZSM&#8208;5 was investigated. The results showed that phosphorus&#8208;modified ZSM&#8208;5 zeolites exhibited higher light olefin (ethylene and propylene) selectivity (above 50&#8201;%) and longer catalytic lifetime (33&#8197;h) in methanol to olefin (MTO) reaction when the weight hourly space velocity was 4&#8197;h&#8722;1. Phosphorus&#8208;modified ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite synthesized by in&#8197;situ solvent&#8208;free method, which not only reduced the discharge of sewage but also showed a simple method to realize the introduction of phosphorous species, which provided a new idea for phosphorus modification of ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite.

         <title>Enhanced Solvent and Thermal Stability in Cross&#8208;Linkable Conjugated Statistical Copolymers for Organic Field&#8208;Effect Transistors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A set of P3HT&#8208;stat&#8208;P3HHT statistical copolymers containing hydroxyl groups attached to the P3HHT components was synthesized by KCTP polymerization. They occur cross&#8208;linked and retain edge&#8208;on manner at 150&#8201;&#176;C, while losing the ordered packing at 300&#8201;&#176;C. The cross&#8208;linked P3HT&#8208;stat&#8208;P3HHT exhibit good solvent resistance property and improved thermal stability in organic field&#8208;effect transistors.







Abstract
The ability to enhance both the solvent and thermal stability of semiconducting &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymers is highly desired for various device&#8208;related applications. Herein, a series of poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene)&#8208;stat&#8208;poly[3&#8208;(6&#8208;hydroxy)hexylthiophene] (P3HT&#8208;stat&#8208;P3HHT) statistical copolymers with thermally cross&#8208;linkable hydroxyl groups is synthesized and their crystalline structures in three different states, solvent and thermal stability for use in organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs) are elucidated. Importantly, these initial P3HT&#8208;stat&#8208;P3HHT thin films in their as&#8208;cast state crystallize well in an edge&#8208;on orientation. During annealing at 150&#8201;&#176;C, these P3HT&#8208;stat&#8208;P3HHT occur cross&#8208;linked and retain edge&#8208;on orientation with increased crystallinity and ordering. In contrast, after high&#8208;temperature annealing at 300&#8201;&#176;C, their edge&#8208;on orientation is significantly destroyed due to the cross&#8208;linking of hydroxyl groups at melted state. The correlation between different P3HT&#8208;stat&#8208;P3HHT and their charge mobilities is scrutinized. These cross&#8208;linked P3HT&#8208;stat&#8208;P3HHT exhibit good solvent resistance property and improved thermal stability in OFETs. Conceptually, such side&#8208;chain functionalization approach to improve the stability of P3HT&#8208;stat&#8208;P3HHT can be conveniently extended to other conjugated polymers for diverse optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Four&#8208;Step Synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;4&#8208;epi&#8208;Presilphiperfolan&#8208;8&#945;&#8208;ol by Intramolecular Iron Hydride Atom Transfer&#8208;Mediated Ketone&#8208;Alkene Coupling and Studies to Access trans&#8208;Hydrindanols with a Botryane Scaffold</title>

         <dc:description>
A four&#8208;step approach to a presilphiperfolanol: Allylation of (&#8722;)&#8208;pulegone followed by an alkylation renders a trisubstituted cyclohexanone, which leads to a bridged bicyclo[4.3.1]undecen&#8208;one by a ring&#8208;closing metathesis. The embedded alkene&#8208;ketone functionalization is key for the metal&#8208;hydride atom transfer (MHAT) intramolecular &#8220;alkene first&#8221; radical process leading to the epimer at C&#8208;4 of presilphiperfolan&#8208;8&#945;&#8208;ol.







Abstract
From an (R)&#8208;(+)&#8208;pulegone&#8208;derived building block that incorporates the stereo&#8208;defined tertiary carbon bearing a methyl group, as found in the targeted sesquiterpenoid, a four&#8208;step synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;4&#8208;epi&#8208;presilphiperfolan&#8208;8&#8208;&#945;&#8208;ol was achieved. The key processes involved are a ring&#8208;closing metathesis leading to a bridged alkene&#8208;tethered ketone and its subsequent FeIII&#8208;mediated metal&#8208;hydride atom transfer (MHAT) transannular cyclization. This synthetic method, implying an irreversible addition of a carbon&#8208;centered radical upon a ketone by means of a hydrogen atom transfer upon the alkoxy radical intermediate, was also applied in the synthesis of trans&#8208;fused hydrindanols structurally related to botrydial compounds.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A four-step approach to a presilphiperfolanol&lt;/b&gt;: Allylation of (&#8722;)-pulegone followed by an alkylation renders a trisubstituted cyclohexanone, which leads to a bridged bicyclo[4.3.1]undecen-one by a ring-closing metathesis. The embedded alkene-ketone functionalization is key for the metal-hydride atom transfer (MHAT) intramolecular &#8220;alkene first&#8221; radical process leading to the epimer at C-4 of presilphiperfolan-8&lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-ol.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From an (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;)-(+)-pulegone-derived building block that incorporates the stereo-defined tertiary carbon bearing a methyl group, as found in the targeted sesquiterpenoid, a four-step synthesis of (&#8722;)-4-&lt;i&gt;epi&lt;/i&gt;-presilphiperfolan-8-&lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-ol was achieved. The key processes involved are a ring-closing metathesis leading to a bridged alkene-tethered ketone and its subsequent Fe&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;-mediated metal-hydride atom transfer (MHAT) transannular cyclization. This synthetic method, implying an irreversible addition of a carbon-centered radical upon a ketone by means of a hydrogen atom transfer upon the alkoxy radical intermediate, was also applied in the synthesis of &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-fused hydrindanols structurally related to botrydial compounds.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Biomineralized Piezoelectrically Active Scaffolds for Inducing Osteogenic Differentiation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bone tissue engineering scaffold was developed. The scaffold was realized by coupling porous poly (vinylidene fluoride&#8208;co&#8208;hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF&#8208;HFP) coating and calcium phosphate (CaP) coating. Piezoelectric effects can be produced by low&#8208;intensity ultrasound, the self&#8208;motion of the animal body. Through the coupling of piezoelectric effect and physicochemical properties, the scaffold has good osteoinductive ability.







Abstract
There is an endogenous electric field in living organisms, which plays a vital role in the development and regeneration of bone tissue. Therefore, self&#8208;powered piezoelectric material for bone repair has become hot research in recent years. However, the current piezoelectric materials for tissue regeneration still have the shortcomings of lack of biological activity and three&#8208;dimensional structure. Here, we proposed a three&#8208;dimensional polyurethane foam (PUF) scaffold coated with piezoelectric poly (vinylidene fluoride&#8208;co&#8208;hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF&#8208;HFP) and modified by a calcium phosphate (CaP) mineralized coating. The preferred scaffold has an open circuit voltage and short circuit current output of 5&#8197;V and 200&#8197;nA. Combining the physical and chemical properties of the CaP coating, the piezoelectric signal of PVDF&#8208;HFP and the three&#8208;dimensional structure of PUF, the scaffold exhibits superior promotion of cell osteogenic differentiation and ectopic bone formation in&#8197;vivo. The mechanism is attributed to an increase in intracellular Ca2+ levels in response to chemical and piezoelectric stimulation with the material. This research not only paves the way for the application of piezoelectric scaffolds to stimulate osteoblasts differentiation in&#8197;situ, but also lays the foundation for the clinical treatment of long&#8208;term osteoporosis.

         <title>Tailoring Galactose Oxidase for Self&#8208;powered Benzyl Alcohol Sensing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract: Benzyl alcohol (BnOH) is a widely&#8208;used preservative in a variety of cosmetics, but the excess addition (&#8805;1.0%) may cause strong symptoms such as nausea, gastrointestinal irritation, convulsion, even death, making it crucial to monitor and control the addition quantity. Herein, we have developed a test&#8208;strip&#8208;like BnOH detection method via tailoring a galactose oxidase (GOase) towards BnOH oxidation and preparing a self&#8208;powered electrochromic strip for BnOH concentration visualization. A double&#8208;substituted GOase variant (Y329S/R330F) on the basis of the reported GOase M1 has been obtained by semi&#8208;rational design with a 24.6&#8208;fold improved activity towards BnOH compared to GOase M1. The GOase Y329S/R330F electrode responses BnOH with a linear range of 0.04 to 3.25 mM (R2=0.9985), a sensitivity of 122.78 &#181;A mM&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2, and a detection limit of 0.03 mM (S/N=3). Coupling an electrochromic Prussian blue (PB) cathode helps the successful sensing visualization without any further power supply. The present sensing is more convenient and user&#8208;friendly than the generally used gas chromatography (GC) and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and brings a more accessible solution to the field of quality controlling.</dc:description>

         <title>A Selective Excited&#8208;State Intramolecular&#8208;Proton&#8208;Transfer (ESIPT) Sensor for Copper(II) Based on Chelation&#8208;Enhanced Quenching and &#8220;Off&#8208;On&#8221; Detection of Amino Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the synthesis of 2&#8208;(4,5&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;1H&#8208;imidazole&#8208;2&#8208;yl)phenol (TPI&#8208;9) as an interesting fluorescent molecule displaying Excited&#8208;State Intramolecular&#8208;Proton&#8208;Transfer (ESIPT) with Stokes shift of 120 nm. Phenolic compounds with the ability to form intramolecular hydrogen bonds and subsequent proton transfer are known as ESIPT fluorophores. Proton accepting ability can increase significantly by tailoring electron&#8208;donating groups. With the assistance of an environment&#8208;friendly organocatalyst, 10&#8208;camphor sulfonic acid (10&#8208;CSA), TPI&#8208;9 was synthesized to introduce substituents with electron&#8208;donating abilities to develop an efficient ESIPT mechanism. Factors influencing the emission, such as solvent, pH, and metal ions, are investigated. Quenching of fluorescence by Cu2+ through chelation enhancement quenching effect with a high selectivity allowed the establishment of a Cu2+ sensor with an LoD of 0.57 ppm and a ratiometric estimation with an LoD of 0.73 ppm. Metal binding (2:1) stoichiometry and quenching constant (0.0072 mol&#8208;1s&#8208;1) are calculated from Job&#8217;s and Stern&#8208;Volmer plots. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations are in accordance with the experimental results. Competitive replacement of TPI&#8208;9 by amino acids restores ESIPT, consequently, the fluorescence. Thus, an &#8220;off&#8208;on&#8221; fluorescence sensor for amino acid estimation is developed under 1&#8208;minute incubation. A linear relationship between amino acid concentration and fluorescence intensity is in 0&#8208;20 &#956;g/mL range, and the LoD is less than 2.2 &#956;g/mL</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Polyethylene oxide (PEO)&#8208;based polymer electrolytes with good flexibility and viscoelasticity, low interfacial resistance, and fabricating cost have caught worldwide attention, but their practical application is still hampered by the instability at high voltages and the ionic conductivity (10&#8722;8 to 10&#8722;6 S cm&#8722;1). Herein, we rational designed defects&#8208;abundant Ga2O3&#160;nanobricks as multifunctional filler constructed a PEO&#8208;based organic&#8208;inorganic electrolyte for lithium metal batteries. Due to the abundant O&#8208;defects&#160;feature of Ga2O3&#160;filler, this PEO&#8208;based composite&#160;electrolyte not only broadens electrochemical stability window&#160;(over 5.3&#160;V versus Li/Li+)&#160;but also in&#8208;situ forms a Li&#8211;Ga alloy and solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) film during the cycling process causing a rapid diffusion of Li+&#160;ions. The as&#8208;prepared electrolyte achieves the effect of stabilizing interfacial with Li metal (without short&#8208;circuiting over 500 h at 0.2 mA cm&#8722;2) and possesses superior high ionic conductivity. The assembled all&#8208;solid&#8208;state LiFePO4//Li cells attained a superior cycling performance of 146 mAh g&#8722;1 over 100 cycles at 0.5 C.&#160;The XPS analysis reveals that Ga2O3&#160;nanobricks can form a Li&#8208;Ga alloy layer in situ at the polymer/anode interface.&#160;This work shed a light on designing high ionic conductivity lithium alloys in the composite electrolyte to improve the electrochemical properties of PEO&#8208;based polymer electrolytes.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Herein, we have utilized 2&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxyphenyl)benzimidazole (HBI) to synthesize 3&#8208;(1H&#8208;benzoimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;5&#8208;methyl&#8208;benzaldehyde (HBIA) followed by three Schiff bases by using &#8208;ortho (H2BIo), &#8208;meta (H3BIdm) and &#8208;para (H2BIp) substituted amino benzoic acids and studied their photophysical properties. We have successfully derived molecular structures of HBI, HBIA and H3BIdm which reveals that in HBI and HBIA, the phenolic &#8208;OH is intramolecularly hydrogen bonded with sp2N of benzimidazole group whereas in H3BIdm, it is hydrogen bonded with imine C=N of Schiff base moiety, which is responsible for different solid state emission properties of the reported compounds. Extensive experimental and theoretical studies show that for all three Schiff bases, in solution due to activation of C=N isomerization, ESIPT operates through benzimidazole site and displays different emission from the solid state. Furthermore, H2BIo, H3BIdm and H2BIp selectively sense Cu2+ in semi aqueous medium with nano&#8208;molar detection limit and in HuH&#8208;7 cells through the inhibition of ESIPT of process.</dc:description>

         <title>Bioinspired Design of an Uncharged Ambipolar Helical Scaffold to Achieve Efficient Solid&#8208;State Proton Conduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This work demonstrates highly efficient solid&#8208;state proton conduction in helical organic scaffolds inspired by the biomolecule Gramicidin A. The scaffold 1 derived from pyridine&#8208;2,6&#8208;dicarboxamide (PDC) residue adopts a helical conformation that is stabilized by a network of strong bifurcated intramolecular H&#8208;bonds between the polar residues that align the inner (concave) face of the molecule, while the aromatic units present in 1 are oriented outwardly. As a result, the helix attains an ambipolar nature just like Gramicidin A. Two different solid forms of 1 could be isolated: a yellow solid from high&#8208;polarity solvents and an orange solid from low&#8208;polarity solvents. Single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) studies showed that in the former, molecules of 1 are stacked in a homochiral fashion while in the latter heterochiral stacks of 1 were present. The yellow form exhibited almost &#8764;300&#8208;fold higher conductivity (of up to 0.12 mS/cm at 95 &#176;C and 95% relative humidity) than the orange form as a result of closer intermolecular proximity and lower activation energy of 0.098 eV indicating Grotthus mechanism of proton transport. This study establishes the key role of bioinspired design and controlled stereo&#8208;organization of such discrete uncharged organic molecules for achieving efficient solid state proton conduction.</dc:description>

         <title>Cyclic or linear? Parameters determining the outcome of glycine polymerization in silica surface prebiotic scenarios</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The parameters that determine the formation of linear peptides and cyclic dimers (diketopiperazine, DKP) on silica surfaces of different surface area, silanol and siloxane ring populations, controlled by thermal treatments, are investigated upon glycine deposition from gas and liquid phases. The formed products were characterized by infrared and Raman spectroscopies, X&#8208;ray diffraction and thermogravimetric analysis. The results reveal the importance of &#8220;nearly&#8208;free&#8221; silanols to form ester centers as primers for the formation of linear peptides over DKP, on surfaces with medium silanol density (1.4 to 2.7 nm&#8208;2). Quenched reactivity is seen on isolated silanols (density &#8804; 0.7 nm&#8208;2), while silanols involved in hydrogen bonding (density of 4.5 nm&#8208;2) weakly interact with Gly resulting in its cyclization to DKP. Deposition of glycine from liquid phase may also form both DKP and linear polymers, depending on its loading and silica surface. These conclusions demonstrate the complexity of glycine surface chemistry in the polymerization reaction and highlight the interest of a surface science approach to evaluate geochemical prebiotic scenarios.</dc:description>

         <title>Design of Aurone&#8208;Based Dual&#8208;State Emissive (DSE) Fluorophores</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of dual&#8208;state emissive (DSE) fluorophores, i.e. organic molecules showing balanced emission in both solution and as molecular solids, has recently become an emerging approach in material science, biology, sensing, and optoelectronics. However, the majority of existing DSE fluorophores represents structural modifications of the scaffolds known for their aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) properties, e.g. tetraphenylethylenes (TFE), triphenylamines (TFA), and others. In this study, we introduce aurones as an easily accessible scaffold for the construction of DSE fluorophores and describe the main design principles allowing to achieve the balanced emission in both solution and solid state. Herein, we present the solid&#8208;state fluorescence in a systematic series of aurone derivatives for the first time. We propose that the newly found DSE properties of aurones in combination with their established biological activity can be applied efficiently in biomedical studies and diagnostic tools.</dc:description>

         <title>Orbital Nature of Carboionic Monoradicals Made from Diradicals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electronic, optical, and solid state properties of a series of monoradicals, anions and cations, obtained from starting neutral diradicals, have been studied. Diradicals based on s&#8208;indacene and indenoacenes, with benzothiophenes fused and in different orientations feature a varying degree of diradical character in the neutral state which is here related with the properties of the radical redox forms. The analysis of their optical features in the polymethine monoradicals has been carried out in the framework of the molecular orbital and valence bond theories. Electronic UV&#8208;Vis&#8208;NIR absorption, x&#8208;ray solid state diffraction and quantum chemical calculations have been carried out. Studies of the different positive/negative charged species, both residing in the same skeletal p&#8208;conjugated backbone, are rare for organic molecules. The key factor for the dual stabilization is the presence in the starting diradical character that enables to indistinctively accommodate a pseudo&#8208;hole and a pseudo&#8208;electron defect with certainly small reorganization energies for ambipolar charge transport.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and densification of Mo/Mg co&#8208;doped apatite&#8208;type lanthanum silicate electrolyte&#160;with enhanced ionic conductivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Apatite&#8208;type lanthanum silicate (LSO) electrolyte is one of the most promising candidates for developing intermediate&#8208;temperature&#160;solid oxide electrolysis cells&#160;and solid oxide full cells (IT&#8208;SOECs and SOFCs) due to its stability and low&#160;activation energy. However, the LSO electrolyte still suffers from unsatisfied ionic conductivity and low relative density. Here in this work, a novel co&#8208;doping method is reported to prepare highly purified nanocrystalline powder of Mg&#8208;Mo co&#8208;doped LSO (Mg/Mo&#8208;LSO) electrolytes with high excellent densification properties and improved ionic conductivity. Introducing the Mo6+&#160;and Mg2+&#160;ions into the LSO structure can increase the number of interstitial oxide ions and improve the degree of densification at lower sintering temperatures, more importantly, expand the migration channel of oxide ions to enhance the ionic conductivity. As a result, the relative density of the fabricated Mo/Mg&#8208;LSO electrolytes pellets could achieve more than 98% of the theoretical density after sintering at 1500 &#8451; for 4 h with a grain size of about 1&#8208;3 &#956;m and the EIS results showed the ionic conductivity increased from 0.782 mS&#183;cm&#8208;1&#160;for the pristine LSO to 33.94 mS&#183;cm&#8208;1&#160;for the doped sample La9.5Si5.45Mg0.3Mo0.25O26+&#948;&#160;at 800 &#8451;. In addition, the effect of different Mo6+&#160;doping contents was investigated systematically. The proposed Mo/Mg co&#8208;doping method&#160;is one step forward in developing apatite&#8208;structured electrolytes&#160;addressing the common issues associated with the fabrication of dense, highly conductive, and thermochemically stable solid electrolytes.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The efficient utilization of lignin, the direct source of renewable aromatics, into value&#8208;added renewable chemicals is an important step towards sustainable biorefinery practices. Nevertheless, owing to the random heterogeneous structure and limited solubility, lignin utilization has been primarily limited to burning for energy. The catalytic depolymerization of lignin has been proposed and demonstrated as a viable route to sustainable biorefinery, however, low yields and poor selectivity of products, high char formation, and limited to no recycling of transition&#8208;metal&#8208;based catalyst involved in lignin depolymerization demands attention to enable practical&#8208;scale lignocellulosic biorefineries. In this study, we demonstrate the catalytic depolymerization of ionic liquid&#8208;based biorefinery poplar lignin into guaiacols over a reusable zirconium phosphate supported palladium catalyst. The essence of the study lies in the high conversion (&gt;80%), minimum char formation (7&#8208;16%), high yields of guaiacols (up to 200 mg / g of lignin), and catalyst reusability. Both solid residue, liquid stream, and gaseous products were thoroughly characterized using ICP&#8208;OES, PXRD, CHN analysis, GC&#8208;MS, GPC, and 2D NMR to understand the hydrogenolysis pathway.</dc:description>

         <title>Orientational Control of Circularly Polarized Luminescence from Pyrene Clusters using a DNA Scaffold.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We herein investigated chiroptical activities of pyrene clusters incorporated within a DNA duplex. Three pyrene derivatives were prepared on D&#8208;threoninol linkers to allow incorporation within a DNA strand. DNA scaffolds were prepared containing dimers, tetramers, and hexamers of the pyrene derivatives. The homo dimers of 1&#8208;pyrenecarboxylic acid and of 4&#8208;pyrenecarboxylic acid, but not 2&#8208;pyrenecarboxylic acid, emitted intense circularly polarized luminescence signals. Although increasing the number of pyrene units weakened the signal, insertion of natural base pairs between two dimers enhanced its intensity. Interestingly, circularly polarized luminescence intensities varied non&#8208;monotonically depending on the number of intervening base pairs, indicating the importance of orientation between pyrene dimers. The results presented here will lead to development bright circularly polarized luminescence materials and probes.</dc:description>
