         <title>Macromolecular Nano&#8208;Assemblies for Enhancing the Effect of Oxygen&#8208;Dependent Photodynamic Therapy Against Hypoxic Tumors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In oxygen (O2)&#8208;dependent photodynamic therapy (PDT), photosensitizers absorb light energy, which is then transferred to ambient O2, and subsequently cytotoxic singlet oxygen (1O2) is generated. Therefore, the availability of O2 and the utilization efficiency of generated 1O2 are two significant factors that influence the effectiveness of PDT. However, tumor microenvironments (TMEs) characterized by hypoxia and limited utilization efficiency of 1O2 resulting from its short half&#8208;life and short diffusion distance significantly restrict the applicability of PDT for hypoxic tumors. To address these challenges, numerous macromolecular nano&#8208;assemblies (MNAs) have been designed to relieve hypoxia, utilize hypoxia or enhance the utilization efficiency of 1O2. Herein, we provide a comprehensive review on recent advancements achieved with MNAs in enhancing the effectiveness of O2&#8208;dependent PDT against hypoxic tumors.</dc:description>

         <title>Redox properties of Mn(III)porphyrins in hyaluronan oxidative degradation: Single electron transfer mechanism</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cationic Mn(III)&#8208;meso&#8208;tetraarylporphyrin derivatives, substituted in para position with different size alkyl chains, were investigated to function as antioxidants in free&#8208;radical degradation of high&#8208;molar&#8208;mass hyaluronan by the methods of rotational viscometry and oximetry. The results of rotational viscometry showed that MnTM&#8208;4&#8208;PyP5+, MnTE&#8208;4&#8208;PyP5+, MnTPr&#8208;4&#8208;PyP5+, MnTPen&#8208;4&#8208;PyP5+ and MnTHep&#8208;4&#8208;PyP5+ showed high efficiency in decomposing H2O2, and reducing of peroxidized hyaluronan. When using oxygen electrode, MnTE&#8208;4&#8208;PyP5+, MnTPr&#8208;4&#8208;PyP5+, MnTPen&#8208;4&#8208;PyP5+, and MnTHep&#8208;4&#8208;PyP5+ applied to function as protective antioxidants in hyaluronan degradation, the uptake of dissolved oxygen from the reaction milieu was rapid, followed by continual increase in oxygen concentration up to the end of the measurement. However, when especially MnTE&#8208;4&#8208;PyP5+, MnTPr&#8208;4&#8208;PyP5+, and MnTPen&#8208;4&#8208;PyP5+ were examined as hyaluronan chain&#8208;breaking antioxidants, after short&#8208;term dissolved oxygen uptake, almost no increase in oxygen concentration was shown.</dc:description>

         <title>&#8216;Passivated Precursor&#8217; Approach to All&#8208;Alkynyl&#8208;Protected Gold Nanoclusters and Total Structure Determination of Au130</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A &#8216;passivated precursor&#8217; approach is developed for the efficient synthesis and isolation of all&#8208;alkynyl&#8208;protected gold nanoclusters. Direct reduction of dpa&#8208;passivated precursor Au&#8208;dpa (Hdpa = 2,2&#8217;&#8208;dipyridylamine) in one&#8208;pot under ambient conditions gives a series of clusters including Au22(C&#8801;CR)18 (R = &#8208;C6H4&#8208;2&#8208;F), Au36(C&#8801;CR)24, Au44(C&#8801;CR)28, Au130(C&#8801;CR)50, and Au144(C&#8801;CR)60. These clusters can be well separated via column chromatography. The overall isolation yield of this series of clusters is 40% (based on gold), which is much improved in comparison with previous approaches. It is notable that the molecular structure of the giant cluster Au130(C&#8801;CR)50 is revealed, which presents important information for understanding the structure of the mysterious Au130 nanoclusters. Theoretical calculations indicated Au130(C&#8801;CR)50 has a smaller HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap than Au130(S&#8208;C6H4&#8208;4&#8208;CH3)50. This facile and reliable synthetic approach will greatly accelerate further studies on all&#8208;alkynyl&#8208;protected gold nanoclusters.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We report on the elastic and photodynamic properties of (E)&#8208;1,2&#8208;bis(pyridinium&#8208;4&#8208;yl)ethene dinitrate [H2Ebpe](NO3)2, whose needle&#8208;like crystals can be reversibly deformed by applying external mechanical stress. The macro&#8208;scale mechanical properties of [H2Ebpe](NO3)2 crystals were quantified by a three&#8208;point bending test, which gave a stress&#8208;strain curve with an elastic modulus of 1.18 GPa, and its values are lower than those of other flexible elastic organic crystals. It can also be reversibly bent through the [2+2] cycloaddition reaction of the olefin moiety, depending on the direction of UV irradiation.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Developing pragmatic strategies for accessing functional benzofuran&#8208;2&#8208;ones from 3&#8208;([1,1'&#8208;biphenyl]&#8208;2&#8208;yl)benzofuran remains an enduring challenge. Herein, we have achieved a highly discriminating electrochemical oxidative dearomative spiroannulation of 3&#8208;([1,1'&#8208;biphenyl]&#8208;2&#8208;yl)benzofuran, culminating in the synthesis of 2H&#8208;spiro[benzofuran&#8208;3,9'&#8208;fluoren]&#8208;2&#8208;one derivatives. By harnessing the electrophilic intermediates of benzofuryl radical cations supported by DFT calculations, we attain exceptional regioselectivity while eliminating the need for stoichiometric oxidants. Mechanistic investigations reveal a sequence of events involving the benzofuran radical cation, encompassing the capture of H2O, nucleophilic arene attack, and subsequent deprotonation, ultimately yielding the final benzofuran&#8208;2&#8208;ones.</dc:description>

         <title>Modulation of Intermolecular Interactions in Organic Emitters for Highly Efficient Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The adverse aggregated&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) problem of most electroluminescent materials existing in highly doped thin films is one of the key factors impeding the commercialization of&#160;high&#8208;efficiency organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) panel. Whereas, by delicately constructing and modulating moderate intermolecular interactions, some aggregates have been demonstrated to present distinct luminescent properties such as tunable emission spectra, improved photoluminescence quantum yields, different emission mechanism and enhanced horizontal transition dipole ratio (&#920;) of emitting layer, providing feasible solution for ACQ problem. The luminescence from newly generated emissive state in aggregates is different from the traditional &#8220;isolated&#8221; molecules in organic electronics and will possess novel properties and applications. Herein, we summarize the different types of intermolecular interactions within emitter aggregates exhibiting distinct luminescent mechanisms, as well as their effects on photoluminescent and electroluminescent properties, offering reliable reference for the advancement&#160;of highly efficient OLEDs utilizing aggregated emitters.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrophilic Behavior of the &#8220;Nucleophilic&#8221; Pyramidane: Reactivity of Ge&#8208;Pyramidane towards Organolithium Reagents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The particular reactivity of the recently discovered class of the main group element polyhedral clusters, pyramidanes, remains largely unexplored. In this communication, we report the reaction of the germapyramidane with tert&#8208;butyllithium leading to the rather unusual organogermanium compound [Li+(thf)2]&#183;2&#8211;, as the product of the formal insertion of a Ge&#8208;apex into the C&#8211;Li bond. This reactivity mode exemplifies unusual electrophilic behaviour of a pyramidane, which is a priori considered as a nucleophilic reagent. Being highly reactive, [Li+(thf)2]&#183;2&#8211; readily undergoes reactions with electrophiles (MeI, EtBr), initially forming intermediate germahousenes, which isomerize to the thermodynamically more favourable germoles.</dc:description>

         <title>Base&#8208;stabilized Gallium Sulfides and Selenides Supported by a Bis(oxazolinyl)(phenyl)methanide Ligand: Trapping Singly Base&#8208;Stabilized Gallium Chalcogenide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Gallylene supported by a bis(oxazolinyl)(phenyl)methanide (Boxm) ligand was synthesized and structurally characterized. The reaction of this gallylene with triphenylphosphine sulfide/selenide yielded dimeric gallium sulfide and selenide. These compounds could be converted to monomeric terminal sulfide and selenide by coordination of an external Lewis base such as an N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC or IMe4) and 4&#8208;dimethylaminopyridiene (DMAP). These doubly&#8208;base&#8208;stabilized gallium sulfide/selenide reacted with phenyl isocyanate to give the corresponding cycloadducts by releasing the Lewis base, indicating the formation of a single&#8208;base&#8208;stabilized gallium sulfide/selenide intermediate.</dc:description>

         <title>Porphyrin Atropisomerism as a Molecular Engineering Tool in Medicinal Chemistry, Molecular Recognition, Supramolecular Assembly, and Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Porphyrin atropisomerism, which arises from restricted &#963;&#8208;bond rotation between the macrocycle and a sufficiently bulky substituent, was identified in 1969 by Gottwald and Ullman in 5,10,15,20&#8208;tetrakis(o&#8208;hydroxyphenyl)porphyrins. Henceforth, an entirely new field has emerged utilizing this transformative tool. This review strives to explain the consequences of atropisomerism in porphyrins, the methods which have been developed for their separation and analysis and present the diverse array of applications. Porphyrins alone possess intriguing properties and a structure which can be easily decorated and molded for a specific function. Therefore, atropisomerism serves as a transformative tool, making it possible to obtain even a specific molecular shape. Atropisomerism has been thoroughly exploited in catalysis and molecular recognition yet presents both challenges and opportunities in medicinal chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Antiaromaticity of Cycloheptatrienyl Anions: Structure, Acidity, and Magnetic Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Investigations of the nature and degree of antiaromaticity of cycloheptatrienyl anion derivatives using both experimental and computational tools are presented. The ground state of cycloheptatrienyl anion in the gas phase is triplet, planar and Baird&#8208;aromatic. In DMSO, it assumes a singlet distorted allylic form with a paratropic ring current. The other derivatives in both phases assume either allylic or diallylic conformations depending on the substituent pattern. A combination of experimental and computational methods was used to determine the pKa values of 16 derivatives in DMSO, which ranged from 36 to &#8211;10.7. We revealed that the stronger stabilization of the anionic system, which correlates with acidity, does not necessarily imply a lower degree of anti&#8208;aromaticity in terms of magnetic properties. Conversely, the substitution pattern first affects the geometry of the ring through the bulkiness of the substituents and their better conjugation with a more distorted system. Consequently, the distortion reduces the cyclic conjugation in the &#960;&#8208;system and thereby decreases the paratropic current in a magnetic field, which manifests itself as a decrease in the NICS. The triplet&#8208;state geometries and magnetic properties are nearly independent on the substitution pattern, which is typical for simple aromatic systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Current Developments in Emerging Lanthanide&#8208;Doped Persistent Luminescent Scintillators and Their Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lanthanide&#8208;doped persistent luminescent scintillators (PersLSs) are promising luminescent materials for many emerging applications. This review summarizes the latest development of PersLSs, including their persistent luminescence mechanism, synthetic methods, tuning of optical properties, and their applications in the field of information security, bioimaging, as well as sensing.







Abstract
Lanthanide&#8208;doped scintillators have the ability to convert the absorbed X&#8208;ray irradiation into ultraviolet (UV), visible (Vis), or near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light. Lanthanide&#8208;doped scintillators with excellent persistent luminescence (PersL) are emerging as a new class of PersL materials recently. They have attracted great attention due to their unique &#8220;self&#8208;luminescence&#8221; characteristic and potential applications. In this review, we comb through and focus on current developments of lanthanide&#8208;doped persistent luminescent scintillators (PersLSs), including their PersL mechanism, synthetic methods, tuning of PersL properties (e.&#8201;g. emission wavelength, intensity, and duration time), as well as their promising applications (e.&#8201;g. information storage, encryption, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, bio&#8208;imaging, and photodynamic therapy). We hope this review will provide valuable guidance for the future development of PersLSs.

         <title>Understanding the Remarkable Stability of Well&#8208;Defined Dinuclear Copper(I) Carbene Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stuck two&#8208;gether: The tBuPNNP expanded pincer ligand stabilizes a dicopper carbene complex by enforcing its dinuclear core. This dinuclear copper core stabilizes a Fischer carbene through &#960;&#8208;backdonation to such an extent that it is unreactive even towards oxygen. However, we show that carbene transfer from this dinuclear complex towards PPh3 is still possible.







Abstract
The synthesis of a well&#8208;defined dicopper carbene complex supported by the PNNP (2,7&#8208;bis(di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphosphaneyl)methyl&#8208;1,8&#8208;naphthyridine) expanded pincer ligand is reported.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Stuck two-gether&lt;/b&gt;: The &lt;sup&gt;tBu&lt;/sup&gt;PNNP expanded pincer ligand stabilizes a dicopper carbene complex by enforcing its dinuclear core. This dinuclear copper core stabilizes a Fischer carbene through &#960;-backdonation to such an extent that it is unreactive even towards oxygen. However, we show that carbene transfer from this dinuclear complex towards PPh&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is still possible.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The synthesis of a well-defined dicopper carbene complex supported by the PNNP (2,7-bis(di-tert-butylphosphaneyl)methyl-1,8-naphthyridine) expanded pincer ligand is reported. This carbene complex is remarkably stable, even in the presence of air and water. The reactivity of this complex was explored towards typical carbene transfer substrates and its electronic structure was investigated. Using a combination of experiments and DFT calculations, the principles that underly the stability of dinuclear carbene complexes are probed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Multiple Bonding in AeN&#8722; (Ae=Ca, Sr, Ba)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dative bond in the 10 valence&#8208;electron species AeN&#8722; has a multireference character with high bond multiplicity in the triplet (3&#928;) ground state of CaN&#8722; and SrN&#8722; and singlet (1&#931;+) ground state of BaN&#8722;.







Abstract
Quantum chemical calculations using ab initio methods at the MRCI+Q(8,9)/def2&#8208;QZVPPD and CCSD(T)/def2&#8208;QZVPPD levels as well as using density functional theory are reported for the diatomic molecules AeN&#8722; (Ae=Ca, Sr, Ba). The anions CaN&#8722; and SrN&#8722; have electronic triplet (3&#928;) ground states with nearly identical bond dissociation energies De ~57&#8197;kcal/mol calculated at the MRCI+Q(8,9)/def2&#8208;QZVPPD level. In contrast, the heavier homologue BaN&#8722; has a singlet (1&#931;+) ground state, which is only 1.1&#8197;kcal/mol below the triplet (3&#931;&#8722;) state. The computed bond dissociation energy of (1&#931;+) BaN&#8722; is 68.4&#8197;kcal/mol. The calculations at the CCSD(T)&#8208;full/def2&#8208;QZVPPD and BP86&#8208;D3(BJ)/def2&#8208;QZVPPD levels are in reasonable agreement with the MRCI+Q(8,9)/def2&#8208;QZVPPD data, except for the singlet (1&#931;+) state, which has a large multireference character. The calculated atomic partial charges given by the CM5, Voronoi and Hirshfeld methods suggest small to medium&#8208;sized Ae&#8592;N&#8722; charge donation for most electronic states. In contrast, the NBO method predicts for all species medium to large Ae&#8594;N&#8722; electronic charge donation, which is due to the neglect of the (n)p AOs of Ae atoms as genuine valence orbitals. Neither the bond orders nor the bond lengths correlate with the bond dissociation energies. The EDA&#8722;NOCV calculations show that the heavier alkaline earth atoms Ca, Sr, Ba use their (n)s and (n&#8208;1)d orbitals for covalent bonding.

         <title>Comparison of Classical and Green RPLC Methods in the Determination of pKa Values of Some Piperazine Group Antihistamines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, the environmentally friendly green RPLC method was used as an alternative to classical RPLC methods in the determination of the pKa values of some antihistamines of the piperazine group and compared with the data obtained with other methods. In addition, the greenness of the RPLC methods used was determined using green metric tools.







Abstract
In this study, protonation constant values and liquid chromatographic behaviors of hydrophobic cyclizine, chlorcyclizine, hydroxyzine, cinnarizine, cetirizine, meclizine, and buclizine in some water&#8208;organic solvent binary mixtures were examined for the first time using classical and green reverse phase liquid chromatography methods. In the isocratic study, the relationship of the retention time and mobile phase pH in water&#8208;organic solvent binary mixtures containing acetonitrile (45, 50, 55, 60, 65%, v/v), methanol (60, 65, 70, 75%, v/v) and ethanol (45, 50, 55, 56, 59, 60, 62, 65%, v/v) were determined at 37&#8201;&#176;C. In the study, XBridge C18 and Gemini NX C18 columns suitable for the chemical properties of basic compounds were used. The obtained liquid chromatographic data were analyzed using the linear solvation energy relationship methodology and the SOLVER program. The aqueous protonation constant values of the investigated compounds were calculated using the linear relationship between the protonation constant data calculated in studied binary mixtures and some macroscopic constant values of the solvents used. The greenness of methods developed using three different solvents was evaluated with the Analytical Greenness Metric Approach, the Green Analytical Procedures Index, and the Green Solvent Selection Tool approaches.

         <title>Hydrogen Tunneling Exhibiting Unexpectedly Small Primary Kinetic Isotope Effects</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A model reaction occurring exclusively via H&#8208;atom QMT at cryogenic temperatures shows unexpectedly small primary H/D KIEs. Evidence suggests that these surprising results arise due to the coupling of the migrating H/D tunneling particle with the N2 matrix medium. Should a similar scenario be extrapolated to conventional solution conditions, then QMT may have been overlooked in many chemical reactions.







Abstract
Probing quantum mechanical tunneling (QMT) in chemical reactions is crucial to understanding and developing new transformations. Primary H/D kinetic isotopic effects (KIEs) beyond the semiclassical maximum values of 7&#8211;10 (room temperature) are commonly used to assess substantial QMT contributions in one&#8208;step hydrogen transfer reactions, because of the much greater QMT probability of protium vs. deuterium. Nevertheless, we report here the discovery of a reaction model occurring exclusively by H&#8208;atom QMT with residual primary H/D KIEs. 2&#8208;Hydroxyphenylnitrene, generated in N2 matrix, was found to isomerize to an imino&#8208;ketone via sequential (domino) QMT involving anti to syn OH&#8208;rotamerization (rate determining step) and [1,4]&#8208;H shift reactions. These sequential QMT transformations were also observed in the OD&#8208;deuterated sample, and unexpected primary H/D KIEs between 3 and 4 were measured at 3 to 20&#8197;K. Analogous residual primary H/D KIEs were found in the anti to syn OH&#8208;rotamerization QMT of 2&#8208;cyanophenol in a N2 matrix. Evidence strongly indicates that these intriguing isotope&#8208;insensitive QMT reactivities arise due to the solvation effects of the N2 matrix medium, putatively through coupling with the moving H/D tunneling particle. Should a similar scenario be extrapolated to conventional solution conditions, then QMT may have been overlooked in many chemical reactions.

         <title>Synthesis of Calix[4]arene&#8208;Based Porous Organic Cages and Their Gas Adsorption</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two octahedral porous organic cages with a significantly high specific surface area have been synthesized and their potential application in gas adsorption investigated by evaluating their capacity to adsorb SO2, CO2, C2H2, C2H4, and C2H6. They also proved successful in efficiently adsorbing static iodine (I2) vapor.







Abstract
Two crystalline large&#8208;sized porous organic cages (POCs) based on conical calix[4]arene (C4A) were designed and synthesized. The four&#8208;jaw C4A unit tends to follow the face&#8208;directed self&#8208;assembly law with the planar triangular building blocks such as tris(4&#8208;aminophenyl)amine (TAPA) or 1,3,5&#8208;tris(4&#8208;aminophenyl)benzene (TAPB) to generate a predictable cage with a stoichiometry of [6+8]. The formation of the large cages is confirmed through their relative molecular mass measured using MALDI&#8208;TOF/TOF spectra. The protonated molecular ion peaks of C4A&#8208;TAPA and C4A&#8208;TAPB were observed at m/z 5109.0 (calculated for C336H240O24N32: m/z 5109.7) and m/z 5594.2 (calculated for C384H264O24N24: m/z 5598.4). C4A&#8208;POCs exhibit I&#8208;type N2 adsorption&#8208;desorption isotherms with the BET surface areas of 1444.9&#8197;m2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1 and 1014.6&#8197;m2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1. The CO2 uptakes at 273&#8197;K are 62.1&#8197;cm3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1 and 52.4&#8197;cm3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1 at a pressure of 100 KPa. The saturated iodine vapor static uptakes at 348&#8197;K are 3.9&#8197;g&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1 and 3.5&#8197;g&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1. The adsorption capacity of C4A&#8208;TAPA for SO2 reaches to 124.4&#8197;cm3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 298&#8197;K and 1.3&#8197;bar. Additionally, the adsorption capacities of C4A&#8208;TAPA for C2H2, C2H4, and C2H6 were evaluated.

&lt;p&gt;Two octahedral porous organic cages with a significantly high specific surface area have been synthesized and their potential application in gas adsorption investigated by evaluating their capacity to adsorb SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, and C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;. They also proved successful in efficiently adsorbing static iodine (I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) vapor.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two crystalline large-sized porous organic cages (POCs) based on conical calix[4]arene (C4A) were designed and synthesized. The four-jaw C4A unit tends to follow the face-directed self-assembly law with the planar triangular building blocks such as tris(4-aminophenyl)amine (TAPA) or 1,3,5-tris(4-aminophenyl)benzene (TAPB) to generate a predictable cage with a stoichiometry of [6+8]. The formation of the large cages is confirmed through their relative molecular mass measured using MALDI-TOF/TOF spectra. The protonated molecular ion peaks of C4A-TAPA and C4A-TAPB were observed at m/z 5109.0 (calculated for C&lt;sub&gt;336&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;240&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;24&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;32&lt;/sub&gt;: m/z 5109.7) and m/z 5594.2 (calculated for C&lt;sub&gt;384&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;264&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;24&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;24&lt;/sub&gt;: m/z 5598.4). C4A-POCs exhibit I-type N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption-desorption isotherms with the BET surface areas of 1444.9&#8197;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and 1014.6&#8197;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. The CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; uptakes at 273&#8197;K are 62.1&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and 52.4&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at a pressure of 100 KPa. The saturated iodine vapor static uptakes at 348&#8197;K are 3.9&#8197;g&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and 3.5&#8197;g&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. The adsorption capacity of C4A-TAPA for SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reaches to 124.4&#8197;cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 298&#8197;K and 1.3&#8197;bar. Additionally, the adsorption capacities of C4A-TAPA for C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, and C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; were evaluated.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Optical Upconversion in Mononuclear Lanthanide Co&#8208;Crystal Assemblies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Co&#8208;crystal assemblies of mononuclear Yb3+ and Pr3+ complexes enable cooperative sensitization upconversion and energy transfer upconversion from Pr3+ at room temperature. This is the first example of Pr3+ upconversion luminescence at the molecular dimension which enriches the research in the field of upconversion luminescence with lanthanide complexes.







Abstract
In this work, we developed two kinds of co&#8208;crystal assemblies systems, consisting of discrete mononuclear Yb3+ and Er3+ and mononuclear Yb3+ and Pr3+, which can achieve Er3+ and Pr3+ upconversion luminescence, respectively, by Yb3+ sensitization under 980&#8197;nm excitation. The structure and composition of two co&#8208;crystal assemblies were determined by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. By investigation of the series of two assemblies, respectively, it is found that the strongest upconversion luminescence is both obtained when the molar ratio of Yb3+ and Ln3+ (Ln=Er or Pr) is 1&#8201;:&#8201;1. The energy transfer mechanism of Er3+ assemblies is determined as energy transfer upconversion, while that of Pr3+ assemblies is determined as energy transfer upconversion and cooperative sensitization upconversion. This is the first example of Pr3+ upconversion luminescence at the molecular dimension at room temperature, which enriches the research in the field of upconversion luminescence with lanthanide complexes.

         <title>Aromaticity in Semi&#8208;Condensed Figure&#8208;Eight Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aromaticity in the illustrated semi&#8208;condensed figure&#8208;eight molecule, a [5]helicene&#8208;bridged (1,4)cyclophane, is dominated by a (semi&#8208;)local character with some additional minor global character, as allowed by the small torsion angle along the single bonds.







Abstract
Electron delocalization and aromaticity was comparatively evaluated in recently synthesized figure&#8208;eight molecules made of two condensed U&#8208;shaped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon moieties connected either by two single bonds or by two para&#8208;phenylene groups. The selected examples include molecules that incorporate eight&#8208;membered and sixteen&#8208;membered rings, as well as a doubly [5]helicene&#8208;bridged (1,4)cyclophane. We probe whether some electron delocalization could occur through the stereogenic single bonds in these molecules: Is aromaticity purely (semi&#8208;)local, or possibly also global in these molecules? It was concluded that the situation can go from a purely (semi&#8208;)local character when the dihedral angle at the connecting single bonds is large, such as in biphenyl, to a predominantly (semi&#8208;)local character with a minor global contribution when the dihedral angle is small, such as in the para&#8208;phenylene connectors of the [5] helicene&#8208;bridged cyclophane.

         <title>A Systematic Study of Nonionic Di&#8208; and Multiborane Catalysts for the Oligomerization and Polymerization of Epoxides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Borane catalysis has emerged as a powerful technology in epoxide polymerization. Still, the structure&#8208;activity correlations for these catalysts are not fully understood to date, especially regarding compounds with nonionic backbones. Thus, in this work, 13 different borane catalysts of this respective type are described and investigated for their epoxide oligomerization and polymerization performance, using propylene oxide (PO), 1&#8208;butylene oxide (BO) and allyl glycidyl ether (AGE) as monomers. Structurally, special emphasis is put on catalysts with different linker lengths and linker flexibilities as well as the introduction of more than two borane functionalities. Importantly, this screening is conducted both under typical polymerization conditions as well as under the chain transfer agent (CTA)&#8208;rich conditions relevant for large&#8208;scale production. It is found that suitable preorganization of the borane groups, such as present in biphenyl derivatives, offers a simple route to high&#8208;performing catalysts and quantitative monomer conversion of the investigated epoxides. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that a diborane&#8208;catalyzed oligomerization can be kept active over weeks, whereby repeated addition of monomer batches (14 steps) constantly results in full conversion and well&#8208;defined oligoethers, underlining the practical potential of this method. The absence of co&#8208;initiating counter ions is suggested as an inherent advantage of nonionic catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Surface Engineering of the Mechanical Properties of Molecular Crystals via an Atomistic Model for Computing the Facet Stress Response of Solids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The surface stress response of a crystal influences its performance characteristics. We develop, test and apply a new atomistic model for computing the surface elastic properties of molecular crystals. The model was used to support the experimental discovery of a stiff molecular crystal of L&#8211;aspartic acid whose morphology, facet and nanomechanical properties were all correctly predicted prior to experiments.







Abstract
Dynamic molecular crystals are an emerging class of crystalline materials that can respond to mechanical stress by dissipating internal strain in a number of ways. Given the serendipitous nature of the discovery of such crystals, progress in the field requires advances in computational methods for the accurate and high&#8211;throughput computation of the nanomechanical properties of crystals on specific facets which are exposed to mechanical stress. Here, we develop and apply a new atomistic model for computing the surface elastic moduli of crystals on any set of facets of interest using dispersion&#8211;corrected density functional theory (DFT&#8722;D) methods. The model was benchmarked against a total of 24 reported nanoindentation measurements from a diverse set of molecular crystals and was found to be generally reliable. Using only the experimental crystal structure of the dietary supplement, L&#8211;aspartic acid, the model was subsequently applied under blind test conditions, to correctly predict the growth morphology, facet and nanomechanical properties of L&#8211;aspartic acid to within the accuracy of the measured elastic stiffness of the crystal, 24.53&#177;0.56&#8197;GPa. This work paves the way for the computational design and experimental realization of other functional molecular crystals with tailor&#8211;made mechanical properties.

         <title>Metal&#8208;free decarboxylative allylation of oxime esters under light irradiation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Allylation reactions, often used as a key step for constructing complex molecules and drug candidates, typically rely on transition&#8208;metal (TM) catalysts. Even though TM&#8208;free radical allylations have been developed using allyl&#8208;stannanes, &#8208;sulfides, &#8208;silanes or &#8208;sulfones, much less procedures have been reported using simple and commercially available allyl halides, that are used for the preparation of the before&#8208;mentioned allyl derivatives. Here, we present a straightforward photocatalytic protocol for the decarboxylative allylation of oxime esters using allyl bromide derivatives under metal&#8208;free and mild conditions. This methodology yields a diverse variety of functionalized molecules including several pharmaceutically relevant molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>m6A methylation of transcription leader sequence impacts discontinuous transcription of subgenomic mRNAs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 genome has been shown to be m6A methylated at several positions in vivo. Strikingly, a DRACH motif, the recognition motif for adenosine methylation, resides in the core of the transcriptional regulatory leader sequence (TRS&#8208;L) at position A74, which is highly conserved and essential for viral discontinuous transcription. Methylation at position A74 correlates with viral pathogenicity. Discontinuous transcription produces a set of subgenomic mRNAs that function as templates for translation of all structural and accessory proteins. A74 is base&#8208;paired in the short stem&#8208;loop structure 5&#8217;SL3 that opens during discontinuous transcription to form long&#8208;range RNA&#8208;RNA interactions with nascent (&#8208;)&#8208;strand transcripts at complementary TRS&#8208;body sequences. A74 can be methylated by human METTL3/METTL14 complex in vitro. Here, we investigate its impact on the structural stability of 5&#8217;SL3 and the long&#8208;range TRS&#8208;leader:TRS&#8208;body duplex formation necessary for synthesis of subgenomic mRNAs of all four viral structural proteins. Methylation uniformly destabilizes 5'SL3 and long&#8208;range duplexes and alters their relative populations in equilibrium, suggesting that m6A74 modification acts as a regulator for the abundance of viral structural proteins due to this destabilization.</dc:description>

         <title>Telluronium&#8208;Catalyzed Halogenation Reactions: Chalcogen&#8208;Bond Activation of N&#8208;Halosuccinimides and Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The ability of triaryltelluronium salts to interact with N&#8208;halosuccinimides (NXS) through chalcogen bonding (ChB) in the solid state and in solution is demonstrated herein. Cocrystals of the triaryltelluronium bearing two CF3 electron&#8208;withdrawing groups per aryl ring with N&#8208;chloro&#8208;, N&#8208;bromo&#8208; and N&#8208;iodosuccinimide (respectively NCS, NBS and NIS) were analyzed by X&#8208;ray diffraction, evidencing a ChB between tellurium and the carbonyl group of NXS. This ChB was confirmed in solution by NMR spectroscopy, especially by 125Te NMR titration experiment, which allowed the determination of the association constant (Ka) between the telluronium and NBS. The so&#8208;obtained Ka value of 17.3 &#177; 0.6 M&#8208;1 indicated a moderate interaction in solution because of the competitive role of the solvent. The strength of the Te&#8208;&#8208;&#8208;O ChB was however sufficient enough to promote the catalytic halofunctionalization of aromatics and of alkenes such as the intra&#8208; and intermolecular haloalkoxylation and haloesterification of alkenes.</dc:description>

         <title>In Situ Detection of Nucleic Acids in Extracellular Vesicles via Membrane Fusion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 29, May 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This concept summarizes recent advancements in detecting extracellular vesicle (EV) nucleic acids via membrane fusion. These approaches mainly are classified into 1) universal and 2) targeted membrane fusion approaches, and their mechanisms, applications in biomedical diagnostics and the challenges and opportunities are discussed.







Abstract
Extracellular vesicles (EVs) carry diverse biomolecules (e.&#8201;g., nucleic acids, proteins) for intercellular communication, serving as important markers for diseases. Analyzing nucleic acids derived from EVs enables non&#8208;invasive disease diagnosis and prognosis evaluation. Membrane fusion, a fundamental cellular process wherein two lipid membranes merge, facilitates cell communication and cargo transport. Building on this natural phenomenon, recent years have witnessed the emergence of membrane fusion&#8208;based strategies for the detection of nucleic acids within EVs. These strategies entail the encapsulation of detection probes within either artificial or natural vesicles, followed by the induction of membrane fusion with EVs to deliver probes. This innovative approach not only enables in&#8197;situ detection of nucleic acids within EVs but also ensures the maintenance of structural integrity of EVs, thus preventing nucleic acid degradation and minimizing the interference from free nucleic acids. This concept categorizes approaches into universal and targeted membrane fusion strategies, and discusses their application potential, and challenges and future prospects.

         <title>Unravelling the Role of Free Radicals in Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 29, May 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photogenerated radicals have good redox properties, thus promoting the widespread application of photocatalysis for environmental treatment and organic synthesis. The generation and application of photogenerated radicals are related to carriers and reactive molecules, such as a variety of alkane radicals in photocatalytic dissolution. In this conceptual article, we discuss some basic properties of photogenerated radicals and recent related research work.







Abstract
Free radicals are increasingly recognized as active intermediate reactive species that can participate in various redox processes, significantly influencing the mechanistic pathways of reactions. Numerous researchers have investigated the generation of one or more distinct photogenerated radicals, proposing various hypotheses to explain the reaction mechanisms. Notably, recent research has demonstrated the emergence of photogenerated radicals in innovative processes, including organic chemical reactions and the photocatalytic dissolution of precious metals. To harness the potential of these free radicals more effectively, it is imperative to consolidate and analyze the processes and action modes of these photogenerated radicals. This conceptual paper delves into the latest advancements in understanding the mechanics of photogenerated radicals.

A family of multidimensional coordination compounds have been synthesized based on glycine, valine, phenylalanine and tyrosine. Magnetic resonance imaging studies and chiroptical properties have been explored.







Abstract
In this work a family of multidimensional (2&#8208;(1H&#8208;tetrazol&#8208;5&#8208;yl)ethyl) amino acid coordination compounds have been synthesized and thoroughly characterized. For this purpose, glycine, valine, phenylalanine and tyrosine have been selected as starting amino acids and Mn2+, Zn2+ and Cd2+ as metallic nodes. From one side, for Mn2+ based dimer magnetic resonance imaging studies have been conducted, prompted by the number and disposition of the coordinated water molecules and taking into consideration the promising future of manganese&#8208;based coordination compounds as bio&#8208;compatible substitutes to conventional Gd based contrast agents. From another side, d10 block metal&#8208;based complexes allowed exploring photoluminescence properties derived by in&#8197;situ synthesized ligands. Finally, amino acid preserved structural chirality allowed us to examine chiroptical properties, particularly focusing on circularly polarized luminescence.

         <title>Design of New Bis(1,2,3&#8208;triazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)methane&#8208;Based Nitrogen Ligands: Synthesis and Coordination Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 29, May 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of new alcohol neutral ligand precursors based on bis(1,2,3&#8208;triazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)methane moieties is reported. A substrate&#8208;dependent functionalization is observed allowing access to a variety of ligand precursors. The coordination chemistry of some of them against aluminum and zinc have also been investigated.







Abstract
The reaction between bis(1,2,3&#8208;triazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)methane derivatives and nBuLi and various aldehydes, yielded novel neutral ligand precursors incorporating alcohol functional groups. The resulting compounds exhibited distinct characteristics depending on the steric hindrance of the aldehyde employed. In instances where aromatic aldehydes were utilized, functionalization occurred at the methine group bridging both triazole rings. Conversely, the use of pivalic aldehyde prompted functionalization at the C5 position of the triazole ring. These compounds were subsequently employed as ligand precursors in the synthesis of organometallic aluminum and zinc complexes, yielding dinuclear complexes with high efficiency. The structural elucidation of all compounds was accomplished through spectroscopic methods and validated by X&#8208;ray crystallography. Preliminary catalytic investigations into the coupling reaction of cyclohexene oxide and CO2 revealed that aluminum and zinc complexes catalyzed the selective formation of polyether and polycarbonate materials, respectively.

         <title>From Criegee to Breslow: How &#960;&#8208;Donors Steer the Route of Olefin Ozonolysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 29, May 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ozonolysis of N&#8208;heterocyclic olefins could lead to currently unknown urea O&#8208;oxide Criegee intermediates. However, our DFT computations predict that strongly polarized double bonds prefer to accept an oxygen atom from ozone rather than undergoing the usually encountered cycloaddition reaction. The product of this reaction is a precursor of the Breslow intermediate.







Abstract
While &#960;&#8208;bonds typically undergo cycloaddition with ozone, resulting in the release of much&#8208;noticed carbonyl O&#8208;oxide Criegee intermediates, lone&#8208;pairs of electrons tend to selectively accept a single oxygen atom from O3, producing singlet dioxygen. We questioned whether the introduction of potent electron&#8208;donating groups, akin to N&#8208;heterocyclic olefins, could influence the reactivity of double bonds &#8211; shifting from cycloaddition to oxygen atom transfer or generating lesser&#8208;known, yet stabilized, donor&#8208;substituted Criegee intermediates. Consequently, we conducted a comparative computational study using density functional theory on a series of model olefins with increasing polarity due to (asymmetric) &#960;&#8208;donor substitution. Reaction path computations indicate that highly polarized double bonds, instead of forming primary ozonides in their reaction with O3, exhibit a preference for accepting a single oxygen atom, resulting in a zwitterionic species formally identified as a carbene&#8208;carbonyl adduct. This previously unexplored reactivity potentially introduces aldehyde umpolung chemistry (Breslow intermediate) through olefin ozonolysis. Considering solvent effects implicitly reveals that increased solvent polarity further directs the trajectories toward a single oxygen atom transfer reactivity by stabilizing the zwitterionic character of the transition state. The competing modes of chemical reactivity can be explained by a bifurcation of the reaction valley in the post&#8208;transition state region.

         <title>Morphological Transformations of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Nucleocapsid Protein Biocondensates Mediated by Antimicrobial Peptides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 29, May 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 nucleocapsid protein (N&#8722;P) undergoes liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation in the presence of RNA, resulting in biocondensate formation. Antimicrobial peptides are found to interfere with N&#8722;P/RNA condensates, leading to clustering or even to the formation of fibrillar structures. Such morphological transformations are expected to impair the normal functionality of the N&#8722;P droplets and thus virion assembly.







Abstract
Recently, the discovery of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) as excellent candidates for overcoming antibiotic resistance has attracted significant attention. AMPs are short peptides active against bacteria, cancer cells, and viruses. It has been shown that the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 nucleocapsid protein (N&#8722;P) undergoes liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation in the presence of RNA, resulting in biocondensate formation. These biocondensates are crucial for viral replication as they concentrate the viral RNA with the host cell&#8216;s protein machinery required for viral protein expression. Thus, N&#8722;P biocondensates are promising targets to block or slow down viral RNA transcription and consequently virion assembly. We investigated the ability of three AMPs to interfere with N&#8722;P/RNA condensates. Using microscopy techniques, supported by biophysical characterization, we found that the AMP LL&#8211;III partitions into the condensate, leading to clustering. Instead, the AMP CrACP1 partitions into the droplets without affecting their morphology but reducing their dynamics. Conversely, GKY20 leads to the formation of fibrillar structures after partitioning. It can be expected that such morphological transformation severely impairs the normal functionality of the N&#8722;P droplets and thus virion assembly. These results could pave the way for the development of a new class of AMP&#8208;based antiviral agents targeting biocondensates.

         <title>Wireless Light&#8208;Emitting Electrode Arrays for the Evaluation of Electrocatalytic Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 29, May 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Simultaneous evaluation of the catalytic activity of anode and cathode materials present in water electrolyzers is made possible by combining bipolar electrochemistry with an optical readout based on light&#8208;emitting diodes. The straightforward strategy is an alternative to classic physico&#8208;chemical characterization techniques and can be applied beyond water splitting.







Abstract
Water splitting has become a sustainable and clean alternative for hydrogen production. Commonly, the efficiency of such reactions is intimately related to the physico&#8208;chemical properties of the catalysts that constitute the electrolyzer. Thus, the development of simple and fast methods to evaluate the electrocatalytic efficiency of an electrolyzer is highly required. In this work, we present an unconventional method based on the combination of bipolar electrochemistry and light&#8208;emitting diodes, which allows the evaluation of the electrocatalytic performance of the two types of catalysts, composing an electrolyzer, namely for oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions, respectively. The integrated light emission of the diode acts as an optical readout of the electrocatalytic information, which simultaneously depends on the composition of the anode and the cathode. The electrocatalytic activity of Au, Pt, and Ni electrodes, connected to the LED in multiple anode/cathode configurations, towards the water splitting reactions has been evaluated. The efficiency of the electrolyzer can be represented in terms of the onset electric field (&#1013;onset) for light emission, obtaining variations that are in agreement with data reported with conventional electrochemistry. This work introduces a straightforward method for evaluating electrocatalysts and underscores the importance of material characterization in developing efficient electrolyzers for hydrogen production.

         <title>Recognition of Amino Acid Salts by Temperature&#8208;Dependent Allosteric Binding with Stereodynamic Urea Receptors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 29, May 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stereodynamic homotropic allosteric receptors consisting of a rotational shaft as the axial chirality unit, terphenyl units as structural transmission sites and four urea units as binding sites have been developed to transmit and amplify induced chirality by the first guest binding to axial chirality. VT&#8208;CD spectra observed upon binding with amino acid salts showed interesting temperature&#8208;dependent Cotton effects leading to the successful discrimination of hydrocarbon&#8208;based side chains of amino acids.







Abstract
Positive homotropic artificial allosteric systems are important for the regulation of cooperativity, selectivity and nonlinear amplification. Stereodynamic homotropic allosteric receptors can transmit and amplify induced chirality by the first ligand binding to axial chirality between two chromophores. We herein report stereodynamic allosteric urea receptors consisting of a rotational shaft as the axial chirality unit, terphenyl units as structural transmission sites and four urea units as binding sites. NMR titration experiments revealed that the receptor can bind two carboxylate guests in a positive homotropic allosteric manner attributed to the inactivation by intramolecular hydrogen&#8208;bonding between urea units within the receptor. In addition, the VT&#8208;CD spectra observed upon binding of the urea receptor with l&#8208; or D&#8208;amino acid salts in MeCN showed interesting temperature&#8208;dependent Cotton effects, based on the differences of the receptor shaft unit and the guest structure. The successful discrimination of hydrocarbon&#8208;based side chains of amino acid salts indicated that the input of chiral and steric information for the guest was amplified as outputs of the Cotton effect and the temperature&#8208;dependence of VT&#8208;CD spectra through cooperativity of positive allosteric binding.

&lt;p&gt;Stereodynamic homotropic allosteric receptors consisting of a rotational shaft as the axial chirality unit, terphenyl units as structural transmission sites and four urea units as binding sites have been developed to transmit and amplify induced chirality by the first guest binding to axial chirality. VT-CD spectra observed upon binding with amino acid salts showed interesting temperature-dependent Cotton effects leading to the successful discrimination of hydrocarbon-based side chains of amino acids.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Positive homotropic artificial allosteric systems are important for the regulation of cooperativity, selectivity and nonlinear amplification. Stereodynamic homotropic allosteric receptors can transmit and amplify induced chirality by the first ligand binding to axial chirality between two chromophores. We herein report stereodynamic allosteric urea receptors consisting of a rotational shaft as the axial chirality unit, terphenyl units as structural transmission sites and four urea units as binding sites. NMR titration experiments revealed that the receptor can bind two carboxylate guests in a positive homotropic allosteric manner attributed to the inactivation by intramolecular hydrogen-bonding between urea units within the receptor. In addition, the VT-CD spectra observed upon binding of the urea receptor with &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;- or &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;D&lt;/span&gt;-amino acid salts in MeCN showed interesting temperature-dependent Cotton effects, based on the differences of the receptor shaft unit and the guest structure. The successful discrimination of hydrocarbon-based side chains of amino acid salts indicated that the input of chiral and steric information for the guest was amplified as outputs of the Cotton effect and the temperature-dependence of VT-CD spectra through cooperativity of positive allosteric binding.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Facilitating Electron Transfer by Resizing Cyclocarbon Acceptor from C18 to C16</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 29, May 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of low reorganization energy and high electron affinity makes the C16 cyclocarbon a better electron acceptor than the C18 molecule. In complexes with strong electron donors, photoinduced charge separation occurs within picoseconds.







Abstract
Recent advances in synthetic methods, combined with tip&#8208;induced on&#8208;surface chemistry, have enabled the formation of numerous cyclocarbon molecules. Here, we investigate computationally the experimentally studied C16 and C18 molecules as well as their van der Waals (vdW) complexes with several typical donor and acceptor molecules. Our results demonstrate a remarkable electron&#8208;withdrawing ability of cyclocarbon molecules. The vdW complexes of C16 and C18 exhibit a thermodynamically favorable photoinduced electron transfer (ET) from the donor partner to the cyclocarbons that occurs on a picosecond time scale. The lower reorganization energy of C16 compared to C18 leads to a significant acceleration of the ET reactions.

         <title>Interfacial Bonding Induced Charge Transfer in Two&#8208;Dimensional Amorphous MoO3&#8208;x/Graphdiyne Oxide Non&#8208;Van der Waals Heterostructures for Dominant SERS Enhancement</title>

2D amorphous non&#8208;van der Waals MoO3&#8208;x/GDYO heterostructures obtained by supercritical CO2 exhibit excellent Surface&#8208;enhanced Raman Scattering performance in detecting methylene blue (10&#8722;14&#8197;M) with the enhancement factor of 2.55&#215;1011 due to the interfacial bonding induced charge transfer.







Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional semiconductor&#8208;based nanomaterials have shown to be an effective substrate for Surface&#8208;enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS) spectroscopy. However, the enhancement factor (EF) tends to be relatively weak compared to that of noble metals and does not allow for trace detection of molecules. In this work, we report the successful preparation of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) amorphous non&#8208;van der Waals heterostructures MoO3&#8208;x/GDYO nanomaterials using supercritical CO2. Due to the synergistic effect of the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effect and the charge transfer effect, it exhibits excellent SERS performance in the detection of methylene blue (MB) molecules, with a detection limit as low as 10&#8722;14&#8197;M while the enhancement factor (EF) can reach an impressive 2.55&#215;1011. More importantly, the chemical bond bridging at the MoO3&#8208;x/GDYO heterostructures interface can accelerate the electron transfer between the interfaces, and the large number of defective surface structures on the heterostructures surface facilitates the chemisorption of MB molecules. And the charge recombination lifetime can be proved by a ~1.7&#8208;fold increase during their interfacial electron&#8208;transfer process for MoO3&#8208;x/GDYO@MB mixture, achieving highly sensitive SERS detection.

         <title>Unrevealing the Nitrogen Elusive Chirality of 3&#8208;Sulfanyl and 3&#8208;Sulfinyl N&#8208;Tosyl Isoindolinones by ECD Spectra: An Experimental and Theoretical Investigation</title>

A combined theoretical&#8211;experimental strategy revealed the chiral, configurationally stable nature of solvated tricoordinate N&#8208;lactams of the title compounds, offering reliable insights into their chiroptical properties.







Abstract
The nitrogen&#8211;hybridization/pyramidalization of two solvated N&#8208;tosylisoindolinone derivatives having chiral residues in adjacent&#8197;(I) or adjacent and distal (II) position has been investigated by a theoretical&#8208;computational procedure based on Molecular Dynamics simulations and Quantum&#8211;Chemical calculations. After validation of our methodology in providing a reliable repertory of conformations by modeling the electronic circular dichroism (EDC) spectra, the electronic features associated with N&#8208;pyramidalization were further characterized through Natural Bond Order (NBO) analysis. Comparing against the N&#8208;geometry observed in crystal structures as a reference, our findings reveal that the presence of neighbouring chiral centers induces a more pronounced N&#8208;pyramidalization in solution than in the solid state, both in I and II. Furthermore, NBO analysis confirms that the N&#8208;lactam mostly retains the sp2 character but exhibits slight configurational distortion (&#958;I=13&#176;; &#958;II=21&#176;), which significantly influences the chiroptical activities observed in ECD spectra of I and II. This substantiates the N&#8208;lactams as configurationally stable chiral centers.

         <title>Effect of Benzo&#8208;Annelation on Triplet State Energies in Polycyclic Conjugated Hydrocarbons</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 29, May 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We established a quantitative model of the relationship between the structure of conjugated polycyclic hydrocarbons and their triplet state excitation energies E(T1). The proposed model can accurately predict the E(T1) with an average absolute error of less than 0.1&#8197;eV.







Abstract
In a series of earlier studies, the effect of benzo&#8208;annelation was found to be a useful tool for tuning the aromaticity in polycyclic conjugated compounds to desired level. In this work we studied the (anti)aromaticity of benzo&#8208;annelated derivatives of three conjugated hydrocarbons (anthracene, fluoranthene and biphenylene) in their lowest lying singlet (S0) and triplet (T1) states by means of the energy effect (ef), harmonic oscillator model of aromaticity (HOMA), multicentre delocalization indices (MCI), magnetically induced current densities (MICDs) and nucleus independent chemical shifts (NICS). We showed that benzo&#8208;annelation is a topology&#8208;based effect which can be used to modify the T1 state excitation energies (E(T1)). A quantitative model was established being able to accurately predict the E(T1) based only on the numbers of angularly, linearly and geminally annelated benzene rings. In addition, it was demonstrated that the E(T1) can be directly related to the (anti)aromatic character of the central ring in the studied molecules in their S0 state.

         <title>20&#960;&#8208;Electron Antiaromatic Benziphthalocyanines with Absorption Reaching the Near&#8208;Infrared&#8208;II Region</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 29, May 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
20&#960;&#8208;Electron antiaromatic benziphthalocyanines, low symmetry analogues of phthalocyanine, were synthesized by hydrogenation of 18&#960;&#8208;electron benziphthalocyanines. They exhibit intense absorption in the near&#8208;IR (NIR) region despite their antiaromaticity, which is attributed to electric&#8208;dipole&#8208;allowed HOMO&#8208;LUMO transition as a result of symmetry&#8208;lowering. Further structural modification extends the absorption into the second NIR region (reaching 1100&#8197;nm).







Abstract
Although second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II, 1000&#8211;1500&#8197;nm) light has attracted considerable attention, especially for life sciences applications, the development of organic dyes with NIR&#8208;II absorption remains a formidable challenge. Herein we report the design, synthesis, and electronic properties of 20&#960;&#8208;electron antiaromatic benziphthalocyanines (BPcs) that exhibit intense absorption bands in the NIR region. The strong, low&#8208;energy absorption of the antiaromatic BPcs is attributed to electric&#8208;dipole&#8208;allowed HOMO&#8208;LUMO transitions with narrow band gaps, enabled by the reduced structural symmetry of BPc compared with regular porphyrins and phthalocyanines. The combination of peripheral substituents and a central metal decreases the HOMO&#8208;LUMO energy gaps, leading to the extension of the absorption bands into the NIR&#8208;II region (reaching 1100&#8197;nm) under reductive conditions.

         <title>Dehydro[12]&#8208; and [18]annulene&#8208;Fused Ball&#8208;Shaped Ruthenium Complex Oligomers: Synthesis, Aromatic/Antiaromatic Effect, and Symmetry for Near&#8208;Infrared Optical Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 29, May 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single&#8208;step synthesis of ball&#8208;shaped ruthenium complex oligomers has been realized. The process involves the Eglinton coupling of alkyne&#8208;substituted ruthenium complexes, allowing selective oligomer formation. NMR and magnetic circular dichroism spectroscopy confirm annulene&#8216;s influence on chromophores. The resulting oligomers demonstrate increased absorption coefficients in the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region, providing an efficient strategy for controlling NIR optical properties.







Abstract
The appropriate arrangement of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) chromophores allows for the modification of the peak wavelength in the NIR region and efficient use of NIR light. However, the preparation of novel NIR chromophores using simple procedures remains a formidable challenge. Herein, we report the synthesis of ball&#8208;shaped ruthenium complex oligomers. The metal complexes can be synthesized in a single step and interact strongly with NIR light. Alkyne&#8208;substituted low&#8208;symmetry ball&#8208;shaped ruthenium complexes were synthesized and subjected to Eglinton coupling to obtain dehydro[12] and [18]annulene&#8208;fused dimers and trimers. Fine&#8208;tuning of the reaction conditions led to the selective synthesis of the target oligomers. NMR spectroscopy confirmed that the 18&#960;&#8208;aromatic and 12&#960;&#8208;antiaromatic properties of the annulene influenced the ruthenium complex chromophore, and magnetic circular dichroism spectroscopy showed changes in the electronic structure of their excited state owing to molecular&#8208;symmetry differences. The absorption coefficient in the NIR region of the absorption spectra of the oligomers increased significantly, supporting the efficient use of light by oligomerization. The formation of oligomers using ball&#8208;shaped metal complexes is a simple and effective strategy for controlling NIR optical properties.

         <title>Breaking the Rules: On the Relative Stability of Some Methylencyclopropane and Methylcyclopropene Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 29, May 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In or out? Contrarily to the well&#8208;established tendency of 1&#8208;methylcyclopropene compounds to isomerize to the corresponding methylenecyclopropanes, the spiro&#8208;derivative MeCP is refractory towards its conversion into MCP. The reasons of this unexpected behavior were unraveled by high&#8208;level computations, which showed that in the case under exam the endocyclic C&#8722;C double bond isomer is more stable than the exocyclic one by around 2.5&#8211;3.0&#8197;Kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1.







Abstract
The structure of the spirocyclic product obtained by reacting catechol with 1,1&#8208;dichloro&#8208;2&#8208;(chloromethyl)cyclopropane is shown by NMR and X&#8208;ray analysis to be that of a 2&#8208;methylcyclopropene (MeCP), instead of the previously reported 2&#8208;methylenecyclopropane (MCP) one. The study of the equilibration between the two isomeric forms by experimental and computational means (including both Density Functional Theory &#8211; DFT &#8211; and Coupled Cluster with single, double, and perturbative triple excitations &#8211; CCSD(T) &#8211; calculations) revealed that, at variance with most of the alkylidenecyclopropane/alkylcyclopropene systems described to date, for the compounds of the present study the MeCP derivative is more stable by&#8776; 2.5&#8211;3.0&#8197;Kcal&#8201;mol&#8722;1 than the MCP one. The extension of the DFT and CCSD(T) study to other spiro&#8208;MCP/MeCP pairs suggests that the origin of the unexpected shift of the equilibrium position can be tracked back to a combination of electronic and ring&#8208;strain effects. These findings lead to re&#8208;think a long&#8208;standing, and substantially undisputed belief in the area of unsaturated cyclopropane derivatives.

         <title>AuNP/MIL&#8208;88B&#8208;NH2 Nanocomposite for the Valorization of Nitroarene by Green Catalytic Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 29, May 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents the in&#8197;situ formation of small gold nanoparticles inside the iron carboxylate metal organic framework MIL&#8208;88B&#8208;NH2. The resulting nanocomposite was tested in the hydrogenation of diverse nitroarenes, reaching high conversion rates in a sustainable reaction, as proven by green metrics.







Abstract
The efficiency of a catalytic process is assessed based on conversion, yield, and time effectiveness. However, these parameters are insufficient for evaluating environmentally sustainable research. As the world is urged to shift towards green catalysis, additional factors such as reaction media, raw material availability, sustainability, waste minimization and catalyst biosafety, need to be considered to accurately determine the efficacy and sustainability of the process. By combining the high porosity and versatility of metal organic frameworks (MOFs) and the activity of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), efficient, cyclable and biosafe composite catalysts can be achieved. Thus, a composite based on AuNPs and the nanometric flexible porous iron(III) aminoterephthalate MIL&#8208;88B&#8208;NH2 was successfully synthesized and fully characterized. This nanocomposite was tested as catalyst in the reduction of nitroarenes, which were identified as anthropogenic water pollutants, reaching cyclable high conversion rates at short times for different nitroarenes. Both synthesis and catalytic reactions were performed using green conditions, and even further tested in a time&#8208;optimizing one&#8208;pot synthesis and catalysis experiment. The sustainability and environmental impact of the catalytic conditions were assessed by green metrics. Thus, this study provides an easily implementable synthesis, and efficient catalysis, while minimizing the environmental and health impact of the process.

         <title>Modular Divergent Synthesis of Indole Alkaloid Derivatives by an Atypical Ugi Multicomponent Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 29, May 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A complex pentacyclic ketimine undergoes a fully diastereoselective Ugi&#8208;type multicomponent reaction with various isocyanides and carboxylic acids to give a range of non&#8208;natural indole alkaloid derivatives. DFT calculations show that the reaction proceeds via a hydrogen bonding mechanism and that the stereoselectivity is primarily governed by ring strain considerations.







Abstract
We present an Ugi multicomponent approach to explore the chemical space around Aspidosperma&#8208;type monoterpene indole alkaloids. By variation of the isocyanide and carboxylic acid inputs we demonstrate the rapid generation of molecular diversity and the possibility to introduce handles for further modification. The key Ugi three&#8208;component reaction showed full diastereoselectivity towards the cis&#8208;fused ring system, which can be rationalized by DFT calculations that moreover indicate that the reaction proceeds via a Passerini&#8208;type hydrogen bonding mechanism. Several post&#8208;Ugi modifications were also performed, including Pictet&#8208;Spengler cyclization to highly complex nonacyclic natural product hybrid scaffolds.

Functionalization of eumelanin monomer by halogenation leading to triplet state population via intersystem crossing (ISC), along with the observance of room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) in the crystalline iodinated eumelanin monomer.







Abstract
We report the room temperature phosphorescence upon iodination on a crystalline eumelanin monomer with shielded hydroxyl moieties, ethyl 5,6&#8208;dimethoxyindole&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylate (DMICE). Ultrafast intersystem crossing (ISC) is observed in the iodinated (IDMICE) as well as brominated (BDMICE) analogues of the eumelanin monomer derivative in solution. The triplet quantum yields (&#966;T) and intersystem crossing rates (kISC) of the halogenated eumelanin derivatives are

The halogen and &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions, with distinct excitonic coupling and higher ISC rate promote phosphorescence in IDMICE molecular crystals.

         <title>Supramolecular Control of the Temperature Responsiveness of Fluorescent Macrocyclic Molecular Rotamers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 29, May 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The molecular motion of macrocyclic carbazole macrocycles (CarROTs) is controlled through the external addition of anions, cations or through deprotonation allowing four discreet rotational speeds to be accessed, which in turn stop, reduce or enhance the thermoluminescent properties due to increasing or decreasing non&#8208;radiative decay processes, thereby providing a means to externally control the temperature sensitivity of the system.







Abstract
To fully harness the potential of molecular machines, it is crucial to develop methods by which to exert control over their speed of motion through the application of external stimuli. A conformationally strained macrocyclic fluorescent rotamer, CarROT, displays a reproducible and linear fluorescence decrease towards temperature over the physiological temperature range. Through the external addition of anions, cations or through deprotonation, the compound can access four discreet rotational speeds via supramolecular interactions (very slow, slow, fast and very fast) which in turn stop, reduce or enhance the thermoluminescent properties due to increasing or decreasing non&#8208;radiative decay processes, thereby providing a means to externally control the temperature sensitivity of the system. Through comparison with analogues with a higher degree of conformational freedom, the high thermosensitivity of CarROT over the physiological temperature range was determined to be due to conformational strain, which causes a high energy barrier to rotation over this range. Analogues with a higher degree of conformational freedom display lower sensitivities towards temperature over the same temperature range. This study provides an example of an information rich small molecule, in which programable rotational speed states can be observed with facile read&#8208;out.

         <title>Chiral Spiro&#8208;Tetrathiafulvalenes: Synthesis, Chiroptical Properties, Conformational Issues and Charge Transfer Complexes</title>

         <dc:description>
Spiro&#8208;TTFs have been characterized experimentally and theoretically, and the formation of charge transfer complexes with TCNQF2 and TCNQF4 has been reported. The chiroptical investigation of the neutral systems revealed significant differences in chiroptical activity depending on the nature of chiral centres and between diastereomers.







Abstract
Within this work we have investigated spiro&#8208;based tetrathiafulvalenes (TTFs) obtained as mixtures of stereoisomers from racemic spiro[5.5]undeca&#8208;1,8&#8208;dien&#8208;3&#8208;one. Compared to previously described spiro&#8208;TTFs, enantiomeric and diastereoisomeric forms have been here separated by chiral HPLC and fully characterized both experimentally and theoretically. The two types of spiro&#8208;based chiral derivatives contain either one (2) or three (1) chiral centres out of each one is spiro&#8208;type. Experimental CD, supported by TD&#8208;DFT calculations, shows differences in the optical activity between the 1 and 2 and their intermediates. The low optical activity of 2 and 3 (spiro alone chirality) was attributed to the presence of two conformers in the solution (ax and eq) of opposite Cotton effect whereas in the case of 1 and 5 (spiro and stereogenic centres) the spiro chirality seems to be responsible of the Cotton effect in the high energy region whereas the R and S chirality in the low energy region. Racemic and enantiopure forms have been successfully used for the synthesis of charge transfer complexes with tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ) based acceptors.

         <title>Achieving Dendrite&#8208;Free Zinc Metal Anodes via Molecule Anchoring and lon&#8208;Transport Pumping</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 29, May 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Valine was introduced as an aqueous electrolyte additive. The functional groups within the additive molecules were utilized to stabilize the electrode/electrolyte interface (EEI), thereby achieving a reversible dendrite&#8208;free zinc anode.







Abstract
The potential for scale&#8208;up application has been acknowledged by researchers for rechargeable aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs). Nonetheless, the progress of the development is significantly impeded due to the instability of the interface between the zinc anode and electrolyte. Herein, efficient and environmentally benign valine (Val) were introduced as aqueous electrolyte additive to stabilize the electrode/electrolyte interface (EEI) via functional groups in additive molecules, thus achieving reversible dendrite&#8208;free zinc anode. The amino groups present in Val molecules have a strong ability to adsorb on the surface of zinc metal, enabling the construction of anchored molecular layer on the surface of zinc anodes. The strongly polar carboxyl groups in Val molecules can act as ion&#8208;transport pumps to capture zinc ions in the electric double layer (EDL) through coordination chemistry. Therefore, this reconstructed EEI could modulate the zinc ion flux and simultaneously suppress side reactions and dendritic growth of Zn. Consequently, a long stable cycling up to 1400&#8197;h at a high current density of 20&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 is achieved. Additionally, Zn//V2O5 full cell with Val additive exhibit enhanced cyclability, retaining 77&#8201;% capacity after 3000&#8197;cycles, displaying significant potential in promoting the commercialization of ZIBs.

&lt;p&gt;Valine was introduced as an aqueous electrolyte additive. The functional groups within the additive molecules were utilized to stabilize the electrode/electrolyte interface (EEI), thereby achieving a reversible dendrite-free zinc anode.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The potential for scale-up application has been acknowledged by researchers for rechargeable aqueous zinc-ion batteries (ZIBs). Nonetheless, the progress of the development is significantly impeded due to the instability of the interface between the zinc anode and electrolyte. Herein, efficient and environmentally benign valine (Val) were introduced as aqueous electrolyte additive to stabilize the electrode/electrolyte interface (EEI) via functional groups in additive molecules, thus achieving reversible dendrite-free zinc anode. The amino groups present in Val molecules have a strong ability to adsorb on the surface of zinc metal, enabling the construction of anchored molecular layer on the surface of zinc anodes. The strongly polar carboxyl groups in Val molecules can act as ion-transport pumps to capture zinc ions in the electric double layer (EDL) through coordination chemistry. Therefore, this reconstructed EEI could modulate the zinc ion flux and simultaneously suppress side reactions and dendritic growth of Zn. Consequently, a long stable cycling up to 1400&#8197;h at a high current density of 20&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; is achieved. Additionally, Zn//V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; full cell with Val additive exhibit enhanced cyclability, retaining 77&#8201;% capacity after 3000&#8197;cycles, displaying significant potential in promoting the commercialization of ZIBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Selective Synthesis of &#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated Aldehydes from Alkenes and Formaldehyde Catalyzed by Dimethylamine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 29, May 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report here a selective and metal&#8208;free pathway to &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes from cheap alkenes and formaldehyde. The reaction occurs at 30&#8211;50&#8201;&#176;C and only releases water as a by&#8208;product. Through a combined theoretical&#8208;experimental study, we discovered that this reaction could be advantageously catalyzed by dimethylamine.







Abstract
&#945;,&#946;&#8208;Unsaturated aldehydes are important building blocks for the synthesis of a wide range of chemicals, including polymers. The synthesis of these molecules from cheap feedstocks such as alkenes remains a scientific challenge, mainly due to the low reactivity of alkenes. Here we report a selective and metal&#8208;free access to &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes from alkenes with formaldehyde. This reaction is catalyzed by dimethylamine and affords &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes in yields of up to 80&#8201;%. By combining Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations and experiments, we elucidate the reaction mechanism which is based on a cascade of hydride transfer, hydrolysis and aldolization reactions. The reaction can be performed under very mild conditions (30&#8211;50&#8201;&#176;C), in a theoretically 100&#8201;% carbon&#8208;economical fashion, with water as the only by&#8208;product. The reaction was successfully applied to non&#8208;activated linear 1&#8208;alkenes, thus opening an access to industrially relevant &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes from cheap and widely abundant chemicals at large scale.

         <title>Polymer Supported Nitrogen&#8208;Bridged Symmetrical Binuclear Dioxidomolybdenum(VI) Complexes and Their Homogeneous Analogues as Potential Catalysts for Efficient Synthesis of 2&#8208;Amino&#8208;3&#8208;Cyano&#8208;4H&#8208;Chromenes/Pyrans</title>

Polymer supported heterogeneous as well as homogeneous nitrogen&#8208;bridged symmetrical binuclear dioxidomolybdenum(VI) complexes have been synthesised, characterised and used as potential catalysts for the multicomponent one pot synthesis of biologically important 2&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;cyano&#8208;4H&#8208;chromenes/pyrans.







Abstract
Reaction of 2&#8208;chloromethyl&#8208;1H&#8208;benzimidazole with known intermediates (i&#8211;iii), prepared from diaminoguanidine hydrochloride with salicylaldehyde, 5&#8208;bromosalicylaldehyde or 3,5&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylsalicylaldehyde, in the presence of triethylamine (NEt3) led to the formation of benzimidazole appended new ligands, H4L1&#8208;H4L3 (I&#8211;III). The homogeneous nitrogen&#8208;bridged symmetrical binuclear complexes, [(MoVIO2)2(L1)(H2O)2] (1), [(MoVIO2)2(L2)(H2O)2] (2) and [(MoVIO2)2(L3)(MeOH)2] (3) have been isolated by reacting these ligands with [MoVIO2(acac)2] in a 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 molar ratio in refluxing methanol. Using 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 (ligand to Mo precursor) molar ratio under above reaction conditions resulted in the corresponding mononuclear complexes, [MoVIO2(H2L1)(MeOH)] (4), [MoVIO2(H2L2)(H2O)] (5) and [MoVIO2(H2L3)(MeOH)] (6). The binuclear heterogeneous compounds [(MoVIO2)2(L1)(DMF)2]@PS (PS&#8208;1), [(MoVIO2)2(L2)(DMF)2]@PS (PS&#8208;2) and [(MoVIO2)2(L3)(DMF)2]@PS (PS&#8208;3) have been obtained by immobilization of 1&#8211;3 onto chloromethylated polystyrene (PS) beads. All synthesized ligands, homogeneous as well as supported compounds have been characterized by elemental analyses and various spectroscopic methods. Single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction study of complexes 1 and 3 confirms their nitrogen&#8208;bridged symmetrical binuclear structures while 4 is mononuclear. Heterogeneous compounds (PS&#8208;1&#8208;PS&#8208;3) have further been studied by microwave plasma atomic emission spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and field emission scanning electron microscopy along with energy dispersive spectroscopy. These compounds (homogeneous and heterogeneous) were explored for catalytic applications to one&#8208;pot multicomponent reactions (MCRs) for efficient synthesis of biologically active 2&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;cyano&#8208;4H&#8208;chromenes/pyrans (21 examples). Optimising various reaction parameters helped in achieving as high as 97&#8201;% yields of products. Though, only half equivalent of the binuclear complexes (1&#8208;3) was required compared to mononuclear analogues (4&#8208;6) to achieve comparable yields, heterogeneous catalysts have an added advantage due to their stability and recyclability. Suitable reaction mechanism has also been proposed based on isolated intermediates.

         <title>A pH&#8208;Responsive Topological Switch Based on a DNA Quadruplex&#8208;Duplex Hybrid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 29, May 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The conformation of a quadruplex&#8208;duplex hybrid interconverts between antiparallel and (3+1) hybrid topologies as a function of pH. This topological transition is associated with adenine protonation to form a capping structure in a slightly acidic environment and may be used as a pH&#8208;sensitive DNA nanoswitch.







Abstract
A guanine&#8208;rich oligonucleotide based on a human telomeric sequence but with the first three&#8208;nucleotide intervening stretch replaced by a putative 15&#8208;nucleotide hairpin&#8208;forming sequence shows a pH&#8208;dependent folding into different quadruplex&#8208;duplex hybrids in a potassium containing buffer. At slightly acidic pH, the quadruplex domain adopts a chair&#8208;type conformation. Upon increasing the pH, a transition with a midpoint close to neutral pH to a major and minor (3+1) hybrid topology with either a coaxially stacked or orthogonally oriented duplex stem&#8208;loop occurs. NMR&#8208;derived high&#8208;resolution structures reveal that an adenine protonation is prerequisite for the formation of a non&#8208;canonical base quartet, capping the outer G&#8208;tetrad at the quadruplex&#8208;duplex interface and stabilizing the antiparallel chair conformation in an acidic environment. Being directly associated with interactions at the quadruplex&#8208;duplex interface, this unique pH&#8208;dependent topological transition is fully reversible. Coupled with a conformation&#8208;sensitive optical readout demonstrated as a proof of concept using the fluorescent dye thiazole orange, the present quadruplex&#8208;duplex hybrid architecture represents a potentially valuable pH&#8208;sensing system responsive in a physiological pH range of 7&#177;1.

A new acentric strontium borate, P1&#8208;Sr2[B5O8(OH)]2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;[B(OH)3]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O, has been synthesized under the hydrothermal condition. This strontium borate is a potential deep&#8208;ultraviolet&#8208;transparent nonlinear&#8208;optical crystal with short wavelength cutoff edge below 190&#8197;nm, and large second&#8208;harmonic&#8208;generation response (1.7&#215;KH2PO4).







Abstract
A new noncentrosymmetric strontium borate, P1&#8208;Sr2[B5O8(OH)]2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;[B(OH)3]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O (1), has been synthesized under the hydrothermal condition. The P1&#8208;Sr2[B5O8(OH)]2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;[B(OH)3]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O shows a layered B&#8722;O network with 9&#8208;ring windows in the ab plane. Sr2+ cations, H3BO3, and H2O molecules are located in the voids of layers and interlayers, respectively. The P1&#8208;Sr2[B5O8(OH)]2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;[B(OH)3]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O is the first synthetic phase of veatchite, while the other three polymorphs are found in different natural minerals. This strontium borate is a potential deep&#8208;ultraviolet&#8208;transparent nonlinear&#8208;optical (NLO) crystal whose second&#8208;harmonic&#8208;generation (SHG) intensity is 1.7 times that of KH2PO4 (KDP) and is phase&#8208;matchable. The short wavelength cutoff edge of compound 1 is below 190&#8197;nm. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that the B&#8722;O units are responsible for the nonlinear optical property.

Isostructural imidonitridophosphates AE2AlP8N15(NH) (AE=Ca, Sr, Ba) were synthesized by high&#8208;pressure/high&#8208;temperature reactions. Atomic&#8208;resolution EDX mapping and solid&#8208;state NMR are consistent with the structure determination by X&#8208;ray diffraction. A PN4&#8208;tetrahedra network features channels occupied by aluminum and alkaline&#8208;earth ions. The compounds show narrow&#8208;band emission in the blue to green region upon doping with Eu2+.







Abstract
A series of isostructural imidonitridophosphates AE2AlP8N15(NH) (AE=Ca, Sr, Ba) was synthesized at high&#8208;pressure/high&#8208;temperature conditions (1400&#8201;&#176;C and 5&#8211;9&#160;GPa) from alkaline&#8208;earth metal nitrides or azides Ca3N2/Sr(N3)2/Ba(N3)2 and the binary nitrides AlN and P3N5. NH4F served as a hydrogen source and mineralizing agent. The crystal structures were determined by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and feature a three&#8208;dimensional network of vertex&#8208;sharing PN4&#8208;tetrahedra forming diverse&#8208;sized rings that are occupied by aluminum and alkaline earth ions. These structures represent another example of nitridophosphate&#8208;based networks that simultaneously incorporate AlN6&#8208;octahedra and alkaline&#8208;earth&#8208;centered polyhedra, with aluminum not participating in the tetrahedra network. They differ from previously reported ones by incorporating non&#8208;condensed octahedra instead of strongly condensed octahedra units and contribute to the diversity of multicationic nitridophosphate network structures. The results are supported by atomic resolution EDX mapping, solid&#8208;state NMR and FTIR measurements. Eu2+&#8208;doped samples show strong luminescence with narrow emissions in the range of green to blue under UV excitation, marking another instance of Eu2+&#8208;luminescence within imidonitridophosphates.

         <title>Amino&#8208; and Alkoxybenziodoxoles: Facile Preparation and Use as Arynophiles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 29, May 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A diverse array of amino&#8208; and alkoxybenziodoxoles can be easily synthesized by reacting the respective amines and alcohols with chlorobenziodoxole. These iodane compounds undergo insertion of arynes into the N&#8722;I(III) and O&#8722;I(III) bonds to give ortho&#8208;amino&#8208; and alkoxy&#8208;arylbenziodoxoles, the iodane group of which can be leveraged as a versatile leaving group for downstream transformations.







Abstract
We report here on the facile synthesis of amino&#8208; and alkoxy&#8208;&#955;3&#8208;iodanes supported by a benziodoxole (BX) template and their use as arynophiles. The amino&#8208; and alkoxy&#8208;BX derivatives can be readily synthesized by reacting the respective amines or alcohols with chlorobenziodoxole in the presence of a suitable base. Unlike previously known nitrogen&#8208; and oxygen&#8208;bound iodane compounds, which have primarily been employed as electrophilic group transfer agents or oxidants, the present amino&#8208; and alkoxy&#8208;BX reagents manifest themselves as nucleophilic amino and alkoxy transfer agents toward arynes. This reactivity leads to the aryne insertion into the N&#8722;I(III) or O&#8722;I(III) bond to afford ortho&#8208;amino&#8208; and ortho&#8208;alkoxy&#8208;arylbenziodoxoles, iodane compounds nontrivial to procure by existing methods. The BX group in these insertion products exhibits excellent leaving group ability, enabling diverse downstream transformations.

         <title>Heptagonal Molecular Tiling via Self&#8208;Assembly of Heptagonal Phenylene&#8208;Ethynylene Macrocycle at the Liquid&#8211;Solid Interface</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 29, May 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular&#8208;level heptagonal tiling has been demonstrated at the liquid&#8211;graphite interface by the self&#8208;assembly of a heptagonal meta&#8208;phenylene&#8208;ethynylene macrocycle featuring long alkoxy substituents. The heptagonal molecules align in an antiparallel pattern, which resembles the densely packed pattern of heptagonal tiles, albeit with variations in the orientations and spacing of the heptagonal cores.







Abstract
The molecular&#8208;level scrutinization of on&#8208;surface tiling garners considerable interest among scientists. Herein, we demonstrate molecular&#8208;level heptagonal tiling using the self&#8208;assembly of a heptagonal meta&#8208;phenylene&#8208;ethynylene macrocycle featuring 14 long alkoxy substituents at the liquid&#8211;graphite interface using scanning tunneling microscopy. This heptagonal macrocycle produces an antiparallel pattern at the 1&#8208;phenyloctane&#8211;graphite interface through van der Waals interactions between the alkoxy chains. This pattern resembles the densely packed pattern of heptagonal tiles, albeit with variations in the orientations and spacing of heptagonal cores owing to intermolecular interactions between the alkoxy chains. Conversely, at the 1,2,4&#8208;trichlorobenzene&#8211;graphite interface, the heptagonal molecule forms an oblique pattern composed of four independent molecular orientations. This phenomenon arises from core distortion induced by the coadsorption of the solvent molecules within the intrinsic macrocyclic pores. This study elucidates the design strategy &#8211; specifically, the choice of heptagonal molecular building block &#8211; for heptagonal tiling and fills a crucial gap in the field of two&#8208;dimensional crystal engineering.

Targeting SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2&#8242;s nucleocapsid protein/RNA biocondensates with antimicrobial peptides is an effective strategy to block or slow down RNA transcription, thus preventing virions&#8217; assembly. Our biophysical results illustrate how peptides can modify the dynamics and morphology of such droplets. Depending on the peptides&#8217; characteristics, which regulate their partitioning into the droplets, various effects have been observed, including droplet clustering and the formation of fibrillar aggregates. More information can be found in the Research Article by R. Oliva, R. Winter and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202400048).

Direct visualization of the catalytic activity of electrode materials, represented by the labelled metal plates, via an array of light&#8208;emitting diodes, is symbolized by glowing eyes. Integrated into a bipolar electrochemical set&#8208;up, depicted by the &#948;&#8722; and &#948;+ polarization, such a system allows the efficiency of the anodic and cathodic catalysts for water splitting to be evaluated in a single image. The result is an instantaneous optical readout of catalytic information, complementary to classic electrochemical techniques. More information can be found in the Research Article by A. Kuhn, G.

The chirality of sp2 nitrogen atoms in organic compounds is a somewhat unexpected and subtle effect already detected in the crystal state. However, revealing this effect in solution is rather challenging. A theoretical&#8208;computational study, supported by electronic circular dichroism spectra has captured such an elusive feature.

Oxygen&#8208;containing functional groups (OFGs) are crucial in carbon&#8208;based electrocatalysts for the two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction which enables the flexible synthesis of H2O2. Herein, the construction strategies and the specific roles of OFGs are reviewed, aiming to provide inspirations for the future development of advanced carbon&#8208;based electrocatalysts for H2O2 production.







Abstract
Recent years have witnessed great research interests in developing high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts for the two&#8208;electron (2e&#8722;) oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) that enables the sustainable and flexible synthesis of H2O2. Carbon&#8208;based electrocatalysts exhibit attractive catalytic performance for the 2e&#8722; ORR, where oxygen&#8208;containing functional groups (OFGs) play a decisive role. However, current understanding is far from adequate, and the contribution of OFGs to the catalytic performance remains controversial. Therefore, a critical overview on OFGs in carbon&#8208;based electrocatalysts toward the 2e&#8722; ORR is highly desirable. Herein, we go over the methods for constructing OFGs in carbon including chemical oxidation, electrochemical oxidation, and precursor inheritance. Then we review the roles of OFGs in activating carbon toward the 2e&#8722; ORR, focusing on the intrinsic activity of different OFGs and the interplay between OFGs and metal species or defects. At last, we discuss the reasons for inconsistencies among different studies, and personal perspectives on the future development in this field are provided. The results provide insights into the origin of high catalytic activity and selectivity of carbon&#8208;based electrocatalysts toward the 2e&#8722; ORR and would provide theoretical foundations for the future development in this field.

         <title>The Application of Porous Organic Polymers as Metal Free Photocatalysts in Organic Synthesis</title>

Visible light photocatalysis is an important tool in organic synthesis, enabling the clean and selective generation of reactive intermediates. Current precious metal&#8208;based photocatalysts face limitations like cost and toxicity, fueling the search for alternatives like porous organic polymers (POPs). This review examines POPs&#8217; role as photocatalysts in organic synthesis, discussing representative materials, mechanisms, comparisons with other photocatalysts, and future prospects.







Abstract
Concerns about increasing greenhouse gas emissions and their effect on our environment highlight the urgent need for new sustainable technologies. Visible light photocatalysis allows the clean and selective generation of reactive intermediates under mild conditions. The more widespread adoption of the current generation of photocatalysts, particularly those using precious metals, is hampered by drawbacks such as their cost, toxicity, difficult separation, and limited recyclability. This is driving the search for alternatives, such as porous organic polymers (POPs).

&lt;p&gt;Visible light photocatalysis is an important tool in organic synthesis, enabling the clean and selective generation of reactive intermediates. Current precious metal-based photocatalysts face limitations like cost and toxicity, fueling the search for alternatives like porous organic polymers (POPs). This review examines POPs&#8217; role as photocatalysts in organic synthesis, discussing representative materials, mechanisms, comparisons with other photocatalysts, and future prospects.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concerns about increasing greenhouse gas emissions and their effect on our environment highlight the urgent need for new sustainable technologies. Visible light photocatalysis allows the clean and selective generation of reactive intermediates under mild conditions. The more widespread adoption of the current generation of photocatalysts, particularly those using precious metals, is hampered by drawbacks such as their cost, toxicity, difficult separation, and limited recyclability. This is driving the search for alternatives, such as porous organic polymers (POPs). This new class of materials is made entirely from organic building blocks, can possess high surface area and stability, and has a controllable composition and functionality. This review focuses on the application of POPs as photocatalysts in organic synthesis. For each reaction type, a representative material is discussed, with special attention to the mechanism of the reaction. Additionally, an overview is given, comparing POPs with other classes of photocatalysts, and critical conclusions and future perspectives are provided on this important field.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bimodal Glycosyl Donors as an Emerging Approach Towards a General Glycosylation Strategy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 30, Issue 29, May 23, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The stereoselective construction of the anomeric bond has constituted one of the greatest challenges in modern organic chemistry. In recent years, examples of &#8220;bimodal&#8221; glycosyl donors have emerged, demonstrating excellent stereocontrol for both &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;anomers. This mini review explores the reactivity and scope of these donors and highlights how they can streamline complex glycan construction.







Abstract
Organic synthesis provides an accessible route to preparative scale biological glycans, although schemes to access these complex structures are often complicated by preparation of multiple monosaccharide building blocks. Bimodal glycosyl donors capable of forming both &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;anomers selectively, are an emerging tactic to reduce the required number of individual synthetic components in glycan construction. This review discusses examples of bimodal donors in the literature, and how they achieve their stereocontrol for both anomers. Notable examples include a bespoke O&#8208;2 benzyl protecting group, a strained glycal for reaction using organometallic catalysis, and a simple perbenzylated donor optimised for stereoselective glycosylation through extensive reaction tuning.

MN(SiMe3)2 mediated various functionalization of C(sp3)&#8722;H latent nucleophiles is summarized in this minireview. These alkali metal chemistries are competitive to the existing methodology, and performs unusual organic transformations, thus opening up new vistas in organic synthesis.







Abstract
Organoalkali compounds have undergone a far&#8208;reaching transformation being a coupling partner to a mediator in unusual organic conversions which finds its spot in the field of sustainable synthesis. Transition&#8208;metal catalysis has always been the priority in C(sp3)&#8722;H bond functionalization, however alternatively, in recent times this has been seriously challenged by earth&#8208;abundant alkali metals and their complexes arriving at new sustainable organometallic reagents. In this line, the importance of MN(SiMe3)2 (M=Li, Na, K &amp; Cs) reagent revived in C(sp3)&#8722;H bond functionalization over recent years in organic synthesis is showcased in this minireview. MN(SiMe3)2 reagent with higher reactivity, enhanced stability, and bespoke cation&#8208;&#960; interaction have shown eye&#8208;opening mediated processes such as C(sp3)&#8722;C(sp3) cross&#8208;coupling, radical&#8208;radical cross&#8208;coupling, aminobenzylation, annulation, aroylation, and other transformations to utilize readily available petrochemical feedstocks. This article also emphasizes the unusual reactivity of MN(SiMe3)2 reagent in unreactive and robust C&#8722;X (X=O, N, F, C) bond cleavage reactions that occurred alongside the C(sp3)&#8722;H bond functionalization. Overall, this review encourages the community to exploit the untapped potential of MN(SiMe3)2 reagent and also inspires them to take up this subject to even greater heights.

         <title>Robust, Reproducible, and Scalable Synthesis of Silver Nanocubes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>It remains a challenge to accomplish colloidal synthesis of noble&#8208;metal nanocrystals marked by high quality, large quantity, and batch&#8208;to&#8208;batch consistency. Here we report a self&#8208;airtight setup for achieving robust, reproducible, and scalable production of Ag nanocubes with uniform and controlled sizes from 18&#8722;60 nm. Different from the conventional open&#8208;to&#8208;air setup, the self&#8208;airtight system makes it practical to stabilize the reaction condition by minimizing the loss of volatile reagents. The new setup also allows us to easily optimize the amount of O2 (from air) trapped in the system, ensuring burst nucleation of single&#8208;crystal seeds, followed by their slow growth into nanocubes. Most significantly, the new setup allows for the production of Ag nanocubes at gram quantities without sacrificing uniformity, corner/edge sharpness, controlled size, and high purity across different batches. The availability of high&#8208;quality Ag nanocubes in such a large quantity is anticipated to substantially boost their use in applications related to plasmonics, catalysis, and biomedicine.</dc:description>

         <title>Systems and Methods for Continuous Evolution of Enzymes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Directed evolution generates novel biomolecules with desired functions by iteratively diversifying the genetic sequence of wildtype biomolecules, relaying the genetic information to the molecule with function, and selecting the variants that progresses towards the properties of interest. While traditional directed evolution consumes significant labor and time for each step, continuous evolution seeks to automate all steps so directed evolution can proceed with minimum human intervention and dramatically shortened time. A major application of continuous evolution is the generation of novel enzymes, which catalyze reactions under conditions that are not favorable to their wildtype counterparts, or on altered substrates. The challenge to continuously evolve enzymes lies in automating sufficient, unbiased gene diversification, providing selection for a wide array of reaction types, and linking the genetic information to the phenotypic function. Over years of development, continuous evolution has accumulated versatile strategies to address these challenges, enabling its use as a general tool for enzyme engineering. As the capability of continuous evolution continues to expand, its impact will increase across various industries. In this review, we summarize the working mechanisms of recently developed continuous evolution strategies, discuss examples of their applications focusing on enzyme evolution, and point out their limitations and future directions.</dc:description>

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Bis&#8208;Acridinium Tweezer Equilibria Controlled by Multi&#8208;Responsive Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Protonated and methylated bis&#8208;acridinium tweezers built around a 2,6&#8208;diphenylpyridyl and an electron enriched 2,6&#8208;di(p&#8208;anisyl)pyridyl spacer have been synthesized. These tweezers can self&#8208;assemble in their corresponding homodimers and the associated thermodynamic parameters have been probed in organic solvents. The switching properties of the tweezers have been exploited in biphasic transfer experiments showing the shift of the equilibria towards the homodimers. Moreover, the thermodynamic parameters of the formation of the reduced methylated homodimers investigated by electrochemical experiments revealed the dissociation of the dimers. Thus, in addition to solvent and temperature, the pH and redox responsiveness of the acridinium units of the tweezers make it possible to modulate to a larger extent the monomer&#8208;dimer equilibria.</dc:description>

         <title>Cation&#8208;Stacking Approach Enabling Interconversion between Bis(xanthylium) and its Reduced Species</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyclophane&#8208;type dications with two units of xanthylium were designed, with the expectation that intramolecular interaction between cation units could induce changes in absorption and redox behavior. The desired dications were synthesized via the macrocyclic diketone as a key intermediate, which was efficiently obtained by a stepwise etherification. X&#8208;ray and UV/Vis measurements revealed that the cyclophane&#8208;type dications adopt a stacking structure in both the crystal and solution. Due to the intramolecular interaction caused by &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking of the xanthylium units, a considerable blue shift compared to the corresponding monocations and a two&#8208;stage one&#8208;electron reduction process were observed in the dications. Furthermore, upon electrochemical reduction of dications, the formation of biradicals via radical cation species was demonstrated by UV/Vis spectroscopy with several isosbestic points at both stages. Therefore, the cation&#8208;stacking approach is a promising way to provide novel properties due to perturbation of their molecular orbitals and to stabilize the reduced species even though they have open&#8208;shell characters.</dc:description>

         <title>Controlling Diastereoselectivity in Dearomatizing Diels&#8208;Alder Reactions of Nitroarenes with 2&#8208;Trimethylsilyloxycyclohexadiene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dearomative Diels&#8208;Alder cycloadditions between simple nitroarenes and cyclic silyloxydienes are carried out under high pressure at room temperature in the absence of any chemical promoter to generate 3D&#8208;scaffolds with exquisite exo&#8208;diastereoselectivity, the exo approach being characterized by a lower distortion of the substrates and by more favorable orbital interactions presumably between the nitro group and the dienic part.







Abstract
Dearomative Diels&#8208;Alder cycloadditions between nitroarenes and 2&#8208;trimethylsilyloxycyclohexadiene are carried out under high pressure at room temperature in the absence of any chemical promoter. Reactions are performed with different arenes, including the highly aromatic naphthalenes and quinolines. They lead to 3D&#8208;scaffolds with exquisite exo&#8208;diastereoselectivity. The exo approach is characterized by lower distortion of the substrates in a late TS and by more favorable orbital interactions presumably between the nitro group and the dienic part, explaining the stereoselectivity.

         <title>Structural and Electronic Chirality in Inorganic Crystals: from Construction to Application</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exploring chirality in inorganic crystals is a fascinating endeavor, encompassing both structural and electronic chirality. This work offers a comprehensive review of the classification and construction of chirality in inorganic crystals. Additionally, it delves into the potential applications of these crystals within the realms of chemistry and physics, providing a thorough insight into their multifaceted implications and uses.







Abstract
Chirality represents a fundamental characteristic inherent in nature, playing a pivotal role in the emergence of homochirality and the origin of life. While the principles of chirality in organic chemistry are well&#8208;documented, the exploration of chirality within inorganic crystal structures continues to evolve. This ongoing development is primarily due to the diverse nature of crystal/amorphous structures in inorganic materials, along with the intricate symmetrical and asymmetrical relationships in the geometry of their constituent atoms. In this review, we commence with a summary of the foundational concept of chirality in molecules and solid states matters. This is followed by an introduction of structural chirality and electronic chirality in three&#8208;dimensional and two&#8208;dimensional inorganic materials. The construction of chirality in inorganic materials is classified into physical photolithography, wet&#8208;chemistry method, self&#8208;assembly, and chiral imprinting. Highlighting the significance of this field, we also summarize the research progress of chiral inorganic materials for applications in optical activity, enantiomeric recognition and chiral sensing, selective adsorption and enantioselective separation, asymmetric synthesis and catalysis, and chirality&#8208;induced spin polarization. This review aims to provide a reference for ongoing research in chiral inorganic materials and potentially stimulate innovative strategies and novel applications in the realm of chirality.

         <title>Improving Fatigue Resistance and Autonomous Switching of pH Responsive Hydrazones by Pulses of a Chemical Fuel</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We introduce a novel approach for the autonomous E/Z isomerization of pH&#8208;responsive hydrazones using trichloroacetic acid pulses. The use of this transient acid enables reversible switching of hydrazones without apparent fatigue even after 50 cycles. Kinetic analysis indicates a significant dependence of switching operations on the electronic properties of substituents.







Abstract
The chemically triggered reversible switching of pH&#8208;responsive hydrazones involves rotary motion&#8208;induced configurational changes, serving as a prototype for constructing an array of molecular machines. Typically, the configurational isomerization of such switches into two distinct forms (E/Z) occurs through the alteration of the pH the medium, achieved by successive additions of acid and base stimuli. However, this process results in intermittent operation due to the concomitant accumulation of salt after each cycle, limiting switching performance to only a few cycles (5&#8211;6). In this context, we introduce a novel strategy for the autonomous E/Z isomerization of hydrazones in acetonitrile using pulses of trichloroacetic acid as a chemical fuel. The use of this transient acid enabled reversible switching of hydrazones even after 50&#8197;cycles without causing significant fatigue. To test the broad viability of the fuel, a series of ortho/para&#8208;substituted hydrazones were synthesized and their switching performance was investigated. The analysis of kinetic data showed a strong dependency of switching operations including the lifetime of transient state, on the electronic properties of substituents. Finally, a distinct color change from yellow to orange due to reversible switching of the para&#8208;methoxy substituted hydrazone was employed for the creation of rewritable messages on commercially available paper.

         <title>In Silico Design and Characterization of a New Molecular Electride: Li@Calix[3]Pyrrole</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here we present Li@calix[3]pyrrole, the newest member of the molecular electride family. Electron density, electron localization function, and non&#8208;covalent interaction analyses confirm the presence of a localized electride electron in the void adjacent to the pyrrole N&#8722;H groups. The origin of the electride character and the bonding environment are elucidated by electron decomposition analysis.







Abstract
Electrides, in which anionic electrons are localized independently of the atoms in the compound, have shown promise, especially as catalysts and optoelectronic materials. Here, we present a new computationally designed molecular electride, Li@calix[3]pyrrole (Li@C3P). Electron density and electron localization function analyses unequivocally confirm the existence of localized electride electron density, outside the system, independent of any specific atoms. Non&#8208;covalent interaction plots further validate the character of the isolated localized electron, suggesting that the system can be accurately represented by Li+@calix[3]pyrrole&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;e&#8722;, denoting its distinct charge separation. The remarkable non&#8208;linear optical properties of Li@C3P, including average polarizability,

=18.40&#215;106&#8197;au, are unparalleled in the previously reported and similar Li@C4P molecular electride. Furthermore, energy decomposition analysis in combination with natural orbital for chemical valence theory sheds light on the mechanism of electron density transfer from Li to the C3P cage, yielding the charge&#8208;separated Li@C3P complex. In addition to the electron transfer, a key factor to its electride nature is the electronic structure of the CnP cage, which has its lowest unoccupied molecular orbital located in the void adjacent to the N&#8722;H groups at the back of the bowl&#8208;shaped CnP cage.

         <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Quaternary Isochromanes by Oxidative Aminocatalysis and Gold Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel approach for the preparation of chiral &#945;&#8208;quaternary isochromanes is reported by combining enantioselective oxidative aminocatalysis and gold catalysis. The presented isochromanes can be applied to scaffold derivatization and photoaffinity labelling of proteins.







Abstract
A novel strategy that combines oxidative aminocatalysis and gold catalysis allows the preparation of chiral &#945;&#8208;quaternary isochromanes, a motif that is prevalent in natural products and synthetic bioactive compounds. In the first step, &#945;&#8208;branched aldehydes and propargylic alcohols are transformed into &#945;&#8208;quaternary ethers with excellent optical purities (&gt;90&#8201;% ee) via oxidative umpolung with DDQ and an amino acid&#8208;derived primary amine catalyst. Subsequent gold(I)&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular hydroarylation affords the isochromane products with retention of the quaternary stereocenter. A second approach explores the use of allylic alcohols as reaction partners for the oxidative coupling to furnish &#945;&#8208;quaternary ethers with generally lower enantiopurities. Stereoretentive cyclization to isochromane products is achieved via intramolecular Friedel&#8208;Crafts type alkylation with allylic acetates as a reactive handle. A number of synthetic elaborations and a biological study on these &#945;&#8208;quaternary isochromanes highlight the potential applicability of the presented method.

         <title>Ion Mobility Mass Spectrometry&#8208;Based Disaccharide Analysis of Glycosaminoglycans</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are vital polysaccharides with complex structures. Disaccharide analysis, involving enzymatic depolymerization and liquid chromatography, is commonly used for their analysis. Here, direct infusion nESI ion mobility&#8208;mass spectrometry (IM&#8208;MS) is used to reduce measurement time from hours to minutes. Chemical modification and stable isotope&#8208;labelled standards enable quantification.







Abstract
Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are linear and acidic polysaccharides. They are ubiquitous molecules, which are involved in a wide range of biological processes. Despite being structurally simple at first glance, with a repeating backbone of alternating hexuronic acid and hexosamine dimers, GAGs display a highly complex structure, which predominantly results from their heterogeneous sulfation patterns. The commonly applied method for compositional analysis of all GAGs is &#8220;disaccharide analysis.&#8221; In this process, GAGs are enzymatically depolymerized into disaccharides, derivatized with a fluorescent label, and then analysed through liquid chromatography. The limiting factor in the high throughput analysis of GAG disaccharides is the time&#8208;consuming liquid chromatography. To address this limitation, we here utilized trapped ion mobility&#8208;mass spectrometry (TIM&#8208;MS) for the separation of isomeric GAG disaccharides, which reduces the measurement time from hours to a few minutes. A full set of disaccharides comprises twelve structures, with eight possessing isomers. Most disaccharides cannot be differentiated by TIM&#8208;MS in underivatized form. Therefore, we developed chemical modifications to reduce sample complexity and enhance differentiability. Quantification is performed using stable isotope labelled standards, which are easily available due to the nature of the performed modifications.

         <title>Advanced Insulin Synthesis by One&#8208;pot/Stepwise Disulfide Bond Formation Enabled by S&#8208;Protected Cysteine Sulfoxide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reaction of S&#8208;protected cysteine and the corresponding cysteine sulfoxide with increasing acidity of the reaction allowed one&#8208;pot/stepwise disulfide formation for insulin synthesis. The stepwise disulfide bonding system employed is unprecedented. In addition, the sulfoxide&#8208;mediated protocol enabled one&#8208;pot synthesis of a lipidated insulin analogue.







Abstract
An advanced insulin synthesis is presented that utilizes one&#8208;pot/stepwise disulfide bond formation enabled by acid&#8208;activated S&#8208;protected cysteine sulfoxides in the presence of chloride anion. S&#8208;chlorocysteine generated from cysteine sulfoxides reacts with an S&#8208;protected cysteine to afford S&#8208;sulfenylsulfonium cation, which then furnishes the disulfide or reversely returns to the starting materials depending on the S&#8208;protection employed and the reaction conditions. Use of S&#8208;acetamidomethyl cysteine (Cys(Acm)) and its sulfoxide (Cys(Acm)(O)) selectively give the disulfide under weak acid conditions in the presence of MgCl2 even if S&#8208;p&#8208;methoxybenzyl cysteine (Cys(MBzl)) and its sulfoxide (Cys(MBzl)(O)) are also present. In contrast, the S&#8208;MBzl pair yields the disulfide under more acidic conditions in the presence of a chloride anion source. These reaction conditions allowed a one&#8208;pot insulin synthesis. Additionally, lipidated insulin was prepared by a one&#8208;pot disulfide&#8208;bonding/lipidation sequence.

         <title>Benzoselenadiazole&#8208;Functionalized H&#8208;Bonded Arylamide Foldamers: Solvent&#8208;Responsive Properties and Helix Self&#8208;Assembly Directed by Chalcogen Bonding in Solid State</title>

         <dc:description>
A novel kind of benzoselenadiazole&#8208;functionalized H&#8208;bonded arylamide foldamers with solvent&#8208;responsive properties have been synthesized. In dichloromethane or dimethyl sulfoxide solvents, the molecules exhibit meniscus or linear structures, respectively, which can be attributed to the unique intramolecular hydrogen bonding behavior. The crystal structures reveal that further assembly of monomers was induced by effective intermolecular Se&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;N interaction. And with the synergistic induction of intramolecular hydrogen bonds and intermolecular chalcogen bonds, supramolecular linear and double helices structures were constructed in solid state.







Abstract
In this study, a series of H&#8208;bonded arylamide foldamers bearing benzoselenadiazole ends with solvent&#8208;responsive properties have been synthesized. In dichloromethane or dimethyl sulfoxide solvents, the molecules exhibit meniscus or linear structures, respectively, which can be attributed to the unique intramolecular hydrogen bonding behavior evidenced by 1D 1H NMR and 2D NOESY spectra. UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy experiments show that the absorption wavelength of H&#8208;bonded arylamide foldamers are significantly red&#8208;shifted due to the presence of benzoselenadiazole group. In addition, the crystal structures reveal that effective intermolecular dual Se&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;N interactions between benzoselenadiazole groups induce further assembly of the monomers. Remarkably, supramolecular linear and double helices structures are constructed under the synergistic induction of intramolecular hydrogen bonding and intermolecular chalcogen bonding. Additionally, 2D DOSY diffusion spectra and theoretical modelling based on density functional theory (DFT) are performed to explore the persistence of intermolecular Se&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;N interactions beyond the crystalline state.

         <title>Mimicking Ozonolysis via Mechanochemistry: Internal Alkynes to 1,2&#8208;Diketones using H5IO6</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Periodic acid is the sole oxidizing agent, yielding 1,2&#8208;diketones mechanochemically from diverse alkynes, effectively emulating ozone&#8216;s reactivity. It is environmentally friendly, cost&#8208;effective, and shows tolerance of different groups.







Abstract
Utilizing periodic acid as an environmentally benign oxidizing agent, this study introduces a novel mechanochemical method that mimics ozonolysis to convert internal alkynes into 1,2&#8208;diketones, showcasing effective emulation of ozone&#8216;s reactivity. Notably, this oxidation occurs at room temperature in aerobic conditions, eliminating the need for toxic transition metals, hazardous oxidants, or expensive solvents. Through control experiments validating the mechanism, substantial evidence supports a concerted reaction pathway. This progress marks a significant stride toward cleaner and more efficient chemical synthesis, mitigating the environmental impact of conventional processes. Assessing the green chemistry metrics in both solvent&#8208;free and previously reported solvent&#8208;based methods, our eco&#8208;friendly protocol demonstrates an E&#8208;factor of 7.40, a 51.7&#8201;% atom economy, a 45.5&#8201;% atom efficiency, 100&#8201;% carbon efficiency, and 11.9&#8201;% reaction mass efficiency when solvents are not used.

Assessing the green chemistry metrics in both solvent-free and previously reported solvent-based methods, our eco-friendly protocol demonstrates an E-factor of 7.40, a 51.7&#8201;% atom economy, a 45.5&#8201;% atom efficiency, 100&#8201;% carbon efficiency, and 11.9&#8201;% reaction mass efficiency when solvents are not used.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Bis&#8208;Porphyrin Cavitand Breathing&#8208;In to Constrict Bucky Balls</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bis&#8208;Ni(II)porphyrin cavitand has been shown to undergo an elastic, breathing mechanism to accommodate incoming fullerenes. The binding is seen to depend on both the electronic and steric factors imposed by the porphyrin faces; additionally, the pillars connecting the two porphyrins undergo facile twisting on binding fullerene, demonstrating a constriction behaviour.







Abstract
Bis&#8208;porphyrin cages have long been exploited to bind fullerenes selectively for various applications. The major consideration for an effective binding here had been the cavity size. Herein, we structurally demonstrate that a bis&#8208;Ni&#8722;porphyrin cavitand having even a smaller cavity can host a larger fullerene by a breathing and ruffling mechanism. It has also been shown that both the electronic and steric influence at the meso&#8208; positions of the porphyrin in fact dictate the binding character. The smaller cavity of 2NiD exhibits preferential binding for C70 over C60; however, surprisingly, the larger cavities in 2HD and 2NiTD display stronger affinities for C60 over the larger fullerene. We show here that the structural elasticity infused both by the metalloporphyrins and the connecting bridges play a major role in directing the binding. These conclusions have adequately been supported by structural and spectroscopic investigations. Additionally, the suitability of one of the conjugates for photoinduced charge&#8208;separation has been investigated using ultrafast transient absorption measurements. 2NiD&#8835;C60 has a charge separation timescale of ~0.8&#8197;ps, while charge recombination occurs at a longer timescale of ~920&#8197;ps.

         <title>Novel Types of Phyllobilins in a Fern &#8208; Molecular Reporters of the Evolution of Chlorophyll Breakdown in the Paleozoic Era</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bilin&#8208;type chlorophyll&#8208;catabolites in de&#8208;greened leaves of the bracken fern and of some angiosperms are molecular reporters of a common basic pathway of Chl&#8208;breakdown in two widely different plant divisions. However, the Chl&#8208;catabolite structures were revealed to also differ in striking ways, shedding light on the evolution of specific Chl&#8208;breakdown strategies in early land plants that existed in the Paleozoic, as progenitors of the extant flora.







Abstract
Breakdown of chlorophyll (Chl), as studied in angiosperms, follows the pheophorbide a oxygenase/phyllobilin (PaO/PB) pathway, furnishing linear tetrapyrroles, named phyllobilins (PBs). In an investigation with fern leaves we have discovered iso&#8208;phyllobilanones (iPBs) with an intriguingly rearranged and oxidized carbon skeleton. We report here a key second group of iPBs from the fern and on their structure analysis. Previously, these additional Chl&#8208;catabolites escaped their characterization, since they exist in aqueous media as mixtures of equilibrating isomers. However, their chemical dehydration furnished stable iPB&#8208;derivatives that allowed the delineation of the enigmatic structures and chemistry of the original natural catabolites. The structures of all fern&#8208;iPBs reflect the early core steps of a PaO/PB&#8208;type pathway and the PB&#8208;to&#8208;iPB carbon skeleton rearrangement. A striking further degradative chemical ring&#8208;cleavage was observed, proposed to consume singlet molecular oxygen (1O2). Hence, Chl&#8208;catabolites may play a novel active role in detoxifying cellular 1O2. The critical deviations from the PaO/PB pathway, found in the fern, reflect evolutionary developments of Chl&#8208;breakdown in the green plants in the Paleozoic era.

         <title>Vibrational Circular Dichroism of a Chiral Triplet Nitrene Investigated Under Matrix&#8208;Isolation Conditions in Parahydrogen</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral triplet nitrene was photochemically generated from the parent azide compound and characterized by means of matrix&#8208;isolation vibrational circular dichroism (VCD) spectroscopy. Despite the high&#8208;spin nature of the target compound, no intensity enhancement was observed, and we show that matrix&#8208;isolation VCD spectra of high&#8208;spin organic radicals can indeed be computed.







Abstract
Vibrational circular dichroism (VCD) spectra of chiral high&#8208;spin organic radicals are expected to show a strong intensity enhancement and are thought to be difficult to predict using state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art theoretical methods. Herein we show that the chiral triplet nitrene obtained from photochemical cleavage of N2 from enantiopure 2&#8208;azido&#8208;9H&#8208;fluorenol does not feature extraordinarily strong intensities and that the experimental spectra match nicely with calculated ones. Thereby, this study demonstrates the general feasibility of studies on chiral high&#8208;spin organics by matrix&#8208;isolation VCD.

         <title>Recyclable Homogeneous Catalysis Enabled by Dynamic Coordination on Rhodium(II) Axial Sites of Metal&#8208;Organic Polyhedra</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The activity of catalytic nanoparticles is strongly dependent on their surface chemistry, which controls colloidal stability and substrate diffusion toward catalytic sites. In this work, we studied how the outer surface chemistry of nanostructured Rh(II)&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic cages or polyhedra (Rh&#8208;MOPs) impacts their performance in homogeneous catalysis. Specifically, through post&#8208;synthetic coordination of aliphatic imidazole ligands onto the exohedral Rh(II) axial sites of Rh&#8208;MOPs, we solubilized a cuboctahedral Rh&#8208;MOP in dichloromethane, thereby enabling its use as a homogeneous catalyst. We demonstrated that the presence of the coordinating ligand on the surface of the Rh&#8208;MOP does not hinder its catalytic activity in styrene aziridination and cyclopropanation reactions, thanks to the dynamic Rh&#8208;imidazole coordination bond. Finally, we used similar ligand exchange post&#8208;synthetic reactions to develop a ligand&#8208;mediated approach for precipitating the Rh&#8208;MOP catalyst, facilitating the recovery and reuse of Rh&#8208;MOPs as homogeneous catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Tandem four&#8208;component reaction to access fused polycycles exhibiting aggregation&#8208;enhanced through&#8208;space charge transfer emission</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Rapid construction of new fluorescence emitters is essential in advancing synthetic luminescent materials. This study illustrated a piperidine&#8208;promoted reaction of chiral dialdehyde with benzoylacetonitrile and malonitrile, leading to the formation of the 6/6/7 fused cyclic product in good yield. The proposed reaction mechanism involves a dual condensation/cyclization process, achieving the formation of up to six bonds for fused polycycles. The single crystal structure analysis revealed that the fused cyclic skeleton contains face&#8208;to&#8208;face naphthyl and cyanoalkenyl motifs, which act as the electronic donor and acceptor, respectively, potentially resulting in through&#8208;space charge transfer (TSCT) emission. While the TSCT emissions were weak in solution, a notable increase in luminescence intensity was observed upon aggregation, indicating bright fluorescent light. A series of theoretical analyses further supported the possibility of spatial electronic communication based on frontier molecular orbitals, the distance of charge transfer, and reduced density gradient analysis. This work not only provides guidance for the one&#8208;step synthesis of complex polycycles, but also offers valuable insights into the design of aggregation&#8208;enhanced TSCT emission materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Discovering Syntheses of Atomically Precise Metal Nanoclusters by Applying Machine Learning to a High&#8208;Throughput Platform</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Understanding the complete structure of noble metal nanoclusters is both academically and practically significant. However, progress has been hindered by the low synthetic efficiency of many nanocluster syntheses. In this study, we present the first high&#8208;throughput syntheses of homo&#8208;gold, homo&#8208;copper, and gold&#8208;copper alloy nanoclusters in dichloromethane at room temperature. Through high&#8208;throughput screening, we successfully obtained three nanoclusters in a single reaction: Au18(SC6H11)14, [Au41Cu66(SC6H11)44](SbF6)3, and an unidentified copper cluster (referred to as Au18, Au41Cu66, and Cu&#8208;NC). The optimized synthesis route was achieved with the assistance of machine learning for experimental data analysis, which also guided the synthesis of other metal nanoclusters such as Au40Cu34(4&#8208;S&#8208;PhF)40 (Au40Cu34), [Au6Cu6(SPh)12]n ([Au6Cu6]n), and Au18Cu32(3,5&#8208;C8H9S)36 (Au18Cu32)). This research demonstrates that high&#8208;throughput screening can be a valuable tool in accelerating the development of nanocluster syntheses.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Hosts for the Sensing and Separation of 99TcO4 &#8208;</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In recent years, European Union member states have hastened energy policy deliberations to address supply and sustainability concerns, placing a significant emphasis on nuclear energy as a means to achieve decarbonization goals. However, despite its significant role in power generation, nuclear energy faces significant challenges linked to fuel reprocessing and waste disposal, that hinder its broader expansion. In this context, the separation of technetium represents a concerning issue. Indeed, technetium's catalytic activity can impede the extraction of uranium, neptunium, and plutonium, affecting waste reprocessing efficiency. Additionally, the stable form of technetium in aerobic conditions, pertechnetate (TcO4&#8722;), poses risks of groundwater contamination due to its mobility and solubility. Hence, sensing and separation of TcO4&#8722; is imperative for both nuclear fuel processing and minimising radioactive contamination in the environment. However, the binding of TcO4&#8722; and its separation from contaminated solutions present challenges due to the acidic (or basic) waste components and the high ionic strength in real matrices. Supramolecular chemists have addressed these issues by designing receptors inspired by molecular recognition principles. This article explores recent advancements and future directions in TcO4&#8722; sensing and separation (using extraction and sorption) with a focus on molecular hosts. Metal&#8208;organic receptors will also be discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>A Magnesium Binding Site And The Anomeric Effect Regulate The Abiotic Redox Chemistry Of Nicotinamide Nucleotides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
NAD(H) and nicotinamide mononucleotide are capable of mediating model protometabolic electron transfer reactions, whereas simpler analogues are not. Early enzyme&#8208;like catalysts likely exploited molecules that possessed a nicotinamide, an anomeric position, and a Mg2+&#8208;binding site, as found in nicotinamide&#8208;containing molecules in biology today.







Abstract
Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) is a redox active molecule that is universally found in biology. Despite the importance and simplicity of this molecule, few reports exist that investigate which molecular features are important for the activity of this ribodinucleotide. By exploiting the nonenzymatic reduction and oxidation of NAD+ by pyruvate and methylene blue, respectively, we were able to identify key molecular features necessary for the intrinsic activity of NAD+ through kinetic analysis. Such features may explain how NAD+ could have been selected early during the emergence of life. Simpler molecules, such as nicotinamide, that lack an anomeric carbon are incapable of accepting electrons from pyruvate. The phosphate moiety inhibits activity in the absence of metal ions but facilitates activity at physiological pH and model prebiotic conditions by recruiting catalytic Mg2+. Reduction proceeds through consecutive single electron transfer events. Of the derivatives tested, including nicotinamide mononucleotide, nicotinamide riboside, 3&#8208;(aminocarbonyl)&#8208;1&#8208;(2,3&#8208;dihydroxypropyl)pyridinium, 1&#8208;methylnicotinamide, and nicotinamide, only NAD+ and nicotinamide mononucleotide would be capable of efficiently accepting and donating electrons within a nonenzymatic electron transport chain. The data are consistent with early metabolic chemistry exploiting NAD+ or nicotinamide mononucleotide and not simpler molecules.

         <title>Modulating the Coordination Chemistry of Cobalt Catalytic Sites by Ruthenium Species to Accelerate the Polysulfide Conversion Kinetics in Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The well&#8208;dispersed Ru in the Co&#8722;NC carbon matrix altered the total charge distribution over the Co&#8722;N&#8722;C catalytic sites and led to the formation of electron&#8208;rich Co&#8722;N, which is highly active for the polysulfide conversion reactions. Additionally, introducing Ru in the Co&#8722;NC matrix provided additional catalytic sites over the Ru&#8722;Nx species to manifest optimal adsorption behavior of polysulfides.







Abstract
The performance of lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries is compromised by the loss of sulfur as dissolved polysulfides in the electrolyte and consequently the polysulfide redox shutting effect. Accelerating the conversion kinetics of polysulfide intermediates into sulfur or lithium sulfide through electrocatalysis has emerged as a root&#8208;cause solution. Co&#8722;N&#8722;C composite electrocatalyst is commonly used for this purpose. It is illustrated here that how the effectiveness can be improved by modulating the coordination chemistry of Co&#8722;N&#8722;C catalytic sites through introducing Ru species (RuCo&#8722;NC). The well&#8208;dispersed Ru in the Co&#8722;NC carbon matrix altered the total charge distribution over the Co&#8722;N&#8722;C catalytic sites and led to the formation of electron&#8208;rich Co&#8722;N, which is highly active for the polysulfide conversion reactions. Using Ru to modulate the electronic structure in the Co&#8722;N&#8722;C configuration and the additional catalytic sites over the Ru&#8722;Nx species can manifest optimal adsorption behavior of polysulfides. Consequently, the sulfur cathode with RuCo&#8722;NC can reduce the capacity fade rate from 0.11&#8201;% per cycle without catalyst (initial capacity of 701&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1) to 0.054&#8201;% per cycle (initial capacity of 1074&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1) over 400 cycles at 0.2&#8197;C rate. The results of this study provide the evidence for a feasible catalyst modification strategy for the polysulfide electrocatalysis.

         <title>Organophotocatalytic Remote Thiocyanation Reaction via Ring&#8208;Opening Functionalization of Cycloalkanols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced remote alkyl thiocyanation via ring&#8208;opening functionalization of cycloalkanols with the electrophilic N&#8208;thiocyanatosaccharin has been developed. A series of valuable ketones with remote thiocyanato substituent have been efficiently synthesized without transition metals and oxidants in moderate to good yields. This protocol provides possibility for the synthesis of some bioactive compounds with remote thiocyanato groups.







Abstract
The remote C(sp3)&#8208;SCN bond formation via ring&#8208;opening functionalization of cycloalkanols with N&#8208;thiocyanatosaccharin as the precursor of SCN radicals and pyrylium salt as the organic photocatalyst under visible light has been developed. Thus, various terminal keto thiocyanates were prepared without transition metals and oxidants in moderate to good yields. The simplicity, wide substrate scope and mild conditions feature its synthetic application capability.

A silyliumylidene ion stabilized by two Ni(0)&#8208; and Pd(0)&#8208;based &#963;&#8208;donating ligands was synthesized. Its particular coordination mode was characterized by a pyramidalized silicon center with a lone pair. Interestingly, a ligand exchange reaction leads to a significant change in the coordination mode to form a metal&#8208;based donor/acceptor&#8208;stabilized silyliumylidene ion, characterized by a vacant orbital at the Si center. Despite the stabilization by the two metal ligands, the silyliumylidene complex remains highly reactive.







Abstract
A silyliumylidene ion 2 stabilized by two &#963;&#8208;donating Ni(0)&#8208; and Pd(0)&#8208;fragments was successfully synthesized. Due to the &#963;&#8208;donation of M&#8594;Si interactions, 2 presents a pyramidalized cationic silicon center with a localized lone pair. The additional coordination of basic Pd(0) fragment to the mono&#8208;Ni(0)&#8208;stabilized silyliumylidene 1 results in a higher HOMO level and an unchanged HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap and thus, 2 remains highly reactive. Interestingly, the coordination mode at the Si center is closely related to the nature of M&#8208;ligands. Indeed, the donor/donor&#8208;stabilized silyliumylidene ion 2 has been transformed into a donor/acceptor&#8208;stabilized ion 13, featuring a trigonal planar Si center with a vacant orbital, just via a ligand exchange reaction from PCy3/NHC toward PMe3.

         <title>Asymmetric and Chemoselective Iridium Catalyzed Hydrogenation of Conjugated Unsaturated Oxime ethers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Research on the chemoselective metal&#8208;catalyzed hydrogenation of conjugated p&#8208;systems has mostly been focussed on enones. Herein, we communicate the understudied asymmetric hydrogenation of enimines catalyzed by N,P&#8208;iridium complexes and chemoselective toward the alkene. A number of enoxime ethers underwent hydrogenation smoothly to yield the desired products in high yield and stereopurity (up to 99% yield, up to 99% ee). No hydrogenation of the C=N p&#8208;bond was observed under the applied reaction conditions (20 bar H2, rt, DCM). It was demonstrated that the chiral oxime ether could be hydrolyzed into the ketone with complete preservation of the installed stereogenity at the &#945;&#8208;carbon. At last, a binding mode of the substrate to the active iridium catalyst and the consequence for the stereoselective outcome was proposed.</dc:description>

         <title>Migration of Condensed Aromatic Hydrocarbons During Alkyne&#8208;Vinylidene&#160;Rearrangements</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Diarylacetylenes ArC&#186;CAr featuring condensed aromatic hydrocarbon fragments (Ar) such as naphthalene, anthracene, phenanthrene and pyrene were converted into vinylidene ligands by 1,2&#8208;migration reactions within the coordination sphere of half&#8208;sandwich complexes [MII(dppe)Cp]+ (MII = RuII, FeII). Comparison of the extent of conversion of the alkyne substrates to the vinylidene complexes [Ru{=C=CAr2}(dppe)Cp]+ with those obtained from acetylenes functionalized by smaller groups (H, CH3, Ph) show that the molecular volume (VM) of the migrating group and relief of steric congestion plays a role during the rearrangement process. Conversely, the H&#8208;atoms from the larger condensed ring aryl groups that are in close proximity to the migrating sites also have a significant influence on the efficacy and extent of the reaction by restricting access of the alkyne to the metal center, resulting in a less effective migration reaction. This combination of competing steric factors (acceleration due to relief of steric congestion and restricted access of the alkyne moiety to the reaction site) is exemplified by the facile migration of 1&#8208;pyryl entities and the low yields of vinylidene products formed from 1,2&#8208;bis(9&#8208;anthryl)acetylene.</dc:description>

         <title>Identification of Potential Drug Targets of Calix[4]arene by Reverse Docking</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Calixarenes are displaying great potential for the development of new drug delivery systems, diagnostic imaging, biosensing devices and inhibitors of biological processes. In particular, calixarene derivatives are able to interact with many different enzymes and function as inhibitors. By screening of the potential drug target database (PDTD) with a reverse docking procedure, we identify and discuss a selection of 100 proteins that interact strongly with calix[4]arene. We also discover that leucine (23.5%), isoleucine (11.3%), phenylalanines (11.3%) and valine (9.5%) are the most frequent binding residues followed by hydrophobic cysteines and methionines and aromatic histidines, tyrosines and tryptophanes. Top binders are peroxisome proliferator&#8208;activated receptors that already&#160;are&#160;targeted by commercial drugs, demonstrating the practical interest in calix[4]arene. Nuclear receptors, potassium channel, several carrier proteins, a variety of cancer&#8208;related proteins and viral proteins are prominent in the list. It is concluded that calix[4]arene, which is characterized by facile access, well&#8208;defined conformational characteristics, and ease of functionalization at both the lower and higher rims, could be a potential lead compound for the development of enzyme inhibitors and theranostic platforms.</dc:description>

         <title>CoPS/Co 4 S 3 Heterojunction&#160;with Highly Exposed Active Sites and Dual&#8208;site Synergy for Effective Hydrogen Evolution Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cobalt phosphosulphide (CoPS) has recently been recognized as a potentially effective electrocatalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). However, there have been no research on the design of CoPS&#8208;based heterojunctions to boost their HER performance.&#160;Herein, CoPS/Co4S3&#160;heterojunction&#160;was&#160;prepared by phosphating treatment based on defect&#8208;rich flower&#8208;like Co1&#8208;xS precursors. The high specific surface area of nanopetals, together with the heterojunction structure with inhomogeneous strain, exposes more active sites in the catalyst.&#160;The electronic structure of the catalyst is reconfigured as a result of the interfacial interactions, which promote the catalyst's ability to adsorb hydrogen and conduct electricity. The synergistic effect of the Co and S dual&#8208;site&#160;further enhance the catalytic activity. The catalyst has overpotentials of 61 and 70 mV&#160;to attain&#160;a current density of 10 mA cm&#8208;2&#160;in acidic and alkaline media, respectively, which renders it competitive with previously reported analogous&#160;catalysts. This work proposes an effective technique for constructing transition metal phosphosulfide heterojunctions, as well as the development of an efficient HER electrocatalyst.</dc:description>

         <title>Chiral Induction in a Self&#8208;Assembled Pd4 Coordination Cage with Chiral Guests</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;assembly of achiral precursors, cis&#8208;(tmen)Pd(NO3)2 and C2&#8208;symmetric ligand produces a racemic mixture of chiral octahedral cage. The cage encapsulates several hydrophobic guests through efficient &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions with the aromatic walls. Intermolecular chiral induction has been achieved by encapsulation of enantiopure chiral guests within the cage resulting selective formation of a single homochiral assembly.







Abstract
The dynamic interplay of coordination bonds within metal&#8208;organic cages offers a unique avenue for structural evolution in response to external stimuli, presenting a promising strategy for the construction of chiral assemblies. This adaptability is crucial for the selective synthesis of homochiral assemblies and advancement of asymmetric catalysis. In this study, we report the self&#8208;assembly of an achiral square&#8208;planar Pd(II) acceptor with a C2&#8208;symmetric tetrapyridyl donor resulted in the formation of a racemic mixture of the chiral octahedral cage Pd4L2. The existence of this racemic mixture was confirmed using circular dichroism spectroscopy as well as single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. We encoded chiral information into the asymmetric cavity of the cage by encapsulating chiral aromatic guests through efficient &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking and hydrophobic interactions in aqueous media. The inclusion of a chiral guest induces a preference for one enantiomeric conformation of the cage over the other, effectively shifting the equilibrium towards a single, enantiopure host&#8208;guest complex. While the concept of chiral guest recognition by a chiral host is well&#8208;established, this work constitutes a remarkable example of guest&#8208;mediated chirality transfer leading to the formation of a single enantiopure coordination complex from achiral building blocks.

         <title>Controlling the Uptake and Release of Semiochemicals in Channel&#8208;Type Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks Through Pore Expansion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, a series of Zr(IV)&#8208; and Al(III)&#8208;based MOFs containing sequentially expanded 1D&#8208;channel pores were investigated for the uptake and controlled release of semiochemicals. Through pore expansion, control over the degree of uptake and release dynamics of these biological messenger molecules was achieved, with the stability of these frameworks allowing for regeneration and re&#8208;use with near identical re&#8208;release profiles.







Abstract
Semiochemicals can be used to manipulate insect behaviour for sustainable pest management strategies, but their high volatility is a major issue for their practical implementation. Inclusion of these molecules within porous materials is a potential solution to this issue, as it can allow for a slower and more controlled release. In this work, we demonstrate that a series of Zr(IV) and Al(III) metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) with channel&#8208;type pores enable controlled release of three semiochemicals over 100&#8197;days by pore size design, with the uptake and rate of release highly dependent on the pore size. Insight from grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations indicates that this is due to weaker MOF&#8208;guest interactions per guest molecule as the pore size increases. These MOFs are all stable post&#8208;release and can be reloaded to show near&#8208;identical re&#8208;release profiles. These results provide valuable insight on the diffusion behaviour of volatile guests in MOFs, and for the further development of porous materials for sustainable agriculture applications.

         <title>Enhancing Control Over Nitric Oxide Photorelease via a Molecular Keypad Lock</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular keypad lock based on a ruthenium nitrito complex allows for the double&#8208;secure release of the bioactive nitric oxide molecule. The sequential introduction of protons and light to the system results in the release of nitric oxide whose concentration is predicted using an artificial intelligence model.







Abstract
Based on Boolean logic, molecular keypad locks secure molecular information, typically with an optical output. Here we investigate a rare example of a molecular keypad lock with a chemical output. To this end, the light&#8208;activated release of biologically important nitric oxide from a ruthenium complex is studied, using proton concentration and photon flux as inputs. In a pH&#8208;dependent equilibrium, a nitritoruthenium(II) complex is turned into a nitrosylruthenium(II) complex, which releases nitric oxide under irradiation with visible light. The precise prediction of the output nitric oxide concentration as function of the pH and photon flux is achieved with an artificial intelligence approach, namely the adaptive neuro&#8208;fuzzy inference system. In this manner an exceptionally high level of control over the output concentration is obtained. Moreover, the provided concept to lock a chemical output as well as the output prediction may be applied to other (photo)release schemes.

         <title>Detection and Characterization of Hydride Ligands in Copper Complexes by Hard X&#8208;Ray Spectroscopy</title>

         <dc:description>
Discover how X&#8208;ray absorption and X&#8208;ray emission spectroscopy analyses unveil insights into the geometric and electronic properties of copper hydride complexes. The integration of experimental and theoretical approaches offers a holistic approach in detecting and characterizing hydride ligands in copper complexes.







Abstract
Transition metal complexes, particularly copper hydrides, play an important role in various catalytic processes and molecular inorganic chemistry. This study employs synchrotron hard X&#8208;ray spectroscopy to gain insights into the geometric and electronic properties of copper hydrides as potential catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation. The potential of high energy resolution X&#8208;ray absorption near&#8208;edge structure (HERFD&#8208;XANES) and valence&#8208;to&#8208;core X&#8208;ray emission (VtC&#8208;XES) is demonstrated with measurement on Stryker's reagent (Cu6H6) and [Cu3(&#956;3&#8208;H)(dpmppe)2](PF6)2 (Cu3H), alongside a non&#8208;hydride copper compound ICu(dtbppOH) (Cuy&#8722;I). The XANES analysis reveals that coordination geometries strongly influence the spectra, providing only indirect details about hydride coordination. The VtC&#8208;XES analysis exhibits a distinct signal around 8975&#8197;eV, offering a diagnostic tool to identify hydride ligands. Theoretical calculations support and extend these findings by comparing hydride&#8208;containing complexes with their hydride&#8208;free counterparts.

Benefiting from the void&#8208;confinement effect and substrate enrichment of hollow structure, as well as the surface wrinkles, the as&#8208;prepared catalyst Pd@H&#8208;UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 exhibited satisfactory selectivity and stability in the hydrogenation of furfural to furfuryl alcohol.







Abstract
The selective hydrogenation of furfural (FFA) to furfuryl alcohol (FA) is regarded as attractive transformation to achieve the sustainable synthesis of value&#8208;added chemicals from biomass resources. However, the conventional supported catalysts are significantly restricted by their narrow pore size, ununiform dispersion and easy leaching or aggregation of catalytic sites. Herein, we designed hollow UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 as the support to encapsulate Pd nanoparticles (Pd@H&#8208;UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2) to achieve the highly active and selective conversion of FFA to FA. Benefiting from the void&#8208;confinement effect and substrate enrichment of hollow structure, as well as the surface wrinkles, the as&#8208;prepared catalyst Pd@H&#8208;UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 exhibited 96.8&#8201;% conversion of FFA with satisfactory selectivity reaching up to 92.4&#8201;% at 80&#8201;&#176;C, 0.5&#8197;MPa H2 in isopropanol solvent within 6&#8197;h. More importantly, as&#8208;prepared Pd@H&#8208;UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 catalyst exhibited excellent long&#8208;term stability, as well as good universality toward a series of hydrogenation of unsaturated hydrocarbons.

         <title>Generation, Characterization and Reactivity of a High&#8208;Valent Mononuclear Cobalt(IV)&#8722;Diazide Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of azide to a Co(IV)&#8722;dinitrate complex results in the replacement of both nitrate ligands to form a Co(IV)&#8722;diazide species. The azide interacts with Co(IV) more strongly than nitrate, leading to the modulation of the Co(IV) electronic structure and the Co(IV/III) redox potential. Together with the basicity of azide, Co(IV)&#8722;diazide has a higher driving force than Co(IV)&#8722;dinitrate species to activate substrate C&#8722;H and O&#8722;H bonds.







Abstract
High&#8208;valent Fe(IV)=O intermediates of metalloenzymes have inspired numerous efforts to generate synthetic analogs to mimic and understand their substrate oxidation reactivities. However, high&#8208;valent M(IV) complexes of late transition metals are rare. We have recently reported a novel Co(IV)&#8722;dinitrate complex (1&#8208;NO3) that activates sp3 C&#8722;H bonds up to 87&#8197;kcal/mol. In this work, we have shown that the nitrate ligands in 1&#8208;NO3 can be replaced by azide, a more basic coordinating base, resulting in the formation of a more potent Co(IV)&#8722;diazide species (1&#8208;N3) that reacts with substrates (hydrocarbons and phenols) at faster rate constants and activates stronger C&#8722;H bonds than the parent complex 1&#8208;NO3. We have characterized 1&#8208;N3 employing a combination of spectroscopic and computational approaches. Our results clearly show that the coordination of azide leads to the modulation of the Co(IV) electronic structure and the Co(IV/III) redox potential. Together with the higher basicity of azide, these thermodynamic parameters contribute to the higher driving forces of 1&#8208;N3 than 1&#8208;NO3 for C&#8722;H bond activation. Our discoveries are thus insightful for designing more reactive bio&#8208;inspired high&#8208;valent late transition metal complexes for activating inert aliphatic hydrocarbons.

         <title>Silver(i) Perfluoroalcoholates: Synthesis, Structure, and their Use as Transfer Reagents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Degradable fluorinated groups are an opportunity for the future, as ECHA is considering the regulation of persistent PFAS in the coming years. Therefore, the OCF3 group is emerging as a degradable group for a variety of applications, while higher perfluoroalkoxy groups are still of interest for agrochemicals or pharmaceuticals. The silver(I) perfluoroalcoholates can provide valuable reagents for incorporation into organic molecules.







Abstract
Herein we report a general access to silver(i) perfluoroalcoholates, their structure in the solid state and in solution, and their use as transfer reagents. The silver(i) perfluoroalcoholates are prepared by the reaction of AgF with the corresponding perfluorinated carbonyl compounds in acetonitrile and are stable for a prolonged time at &#8722;18&#8201;&#176;C. X&#8208;ray analysis of single crystals of perfluoroalcoholate species showed that two Ag(i) centers are bridged by the alcoholate ligands. In acetonitrile solution, Ag[OCF3] forms different structures as indicated by IR spectroscopy. Furthermore, the silver(i) perfluoroalcoholates can be used as easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle transfer reagents for the synthesis of Cu[OCF3], Cu[OC2F5], [PPh4][Au(CF3)3(OCF3)], and fluorinated alkyl ethers.

         <title>Classification and Identification of Perfume Scents by an Enantioselective Colorimetric Sensor Array of Chiral Metal&#8208;Organic&#8208;Framework&#8208;Based Fabry&#8208;P&#233;rot Films</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A colorimetric sensor array made of Fabry&#8208;P&#233;rot films based on different chiral metal&#8208;organic frameworks is presented. The color changes as response to analyte vapor molecules. The sensors respond enantioselectively for chiral vapor molecules. In combination with a common smartphone camera, the sensor array is used as simple and cost&#8208;efficient system to detect and identify a large number of perfume samples.







Abstract
Many odors, like perfumes, are complex mixtures of chiral and achiral molecules where the cost&#8208;efficient (enantio&#8722;)selective sensing represents a major technical challenge. Here, we present a colorimetric sensor array of surface&#8208;mounted metal&#8208;organic&#8208;framework (SURMOF) films in Fabry&#8208;P&#233;rot (FP) cavities. The optical properties of the FP&#8208;SURMOF films with different chiral and achiral structures are affected by the (enantio&#8722;)selective adsorption of the analytes in the SURMOF pores, resulting in different responses to the analyte molecules. The read&#8208;out of the sensor array is performed by the digital camera of a common smartphone, where the RGB values are determined. By analyzing the sensor array data with simple machine learning algorithms, the analytes are discriminated. After demonstrating the enantioselective response for a pair of pure chiral odor molecules, we apply the sensor array to detect and discriminate a large number (16) of common commercial perfumes and eau de toilettes. While our untrained human nose is not able to discriminate all perfumes, the presented colorimetric sensor array can classify all perfumes with great classification accuracy. Moreover, the sensor array was used to identify unlabeled samples correctly. We foresee such an FP&#8208;chiral&#8208;SURMOF&#8208;based sensor array as a powerful approach toward inexpensive selective odors sensing applications.

The optical properties of the FP-SURMOF films with different chiral and achiral structures are affected by the (enantio&#8722;)selective adsorption of the analytes in the SURMOF pores, resulting in different responses to the analyte molecules. The read-out of the sensor array is performed by the digital camera of a common smartphone, where the RGB values are determined. By analyzing the sensor array data with simple machine learning algorithms, the analytes are discriminated. After demonstrating the enantioselective response for a pair of pure chiral odor molecules, we apply the sensor array to detect and discriminate a large number (16) of common commercial perfumes and eau de toilettes. While our untrained human nose is not able to discriminate all perfumes, the presented colorimetric sensor array can classify all perfumes with great classification accuracy. Moreover, the sensor array was used to identify unlabeled samples correctly. We foresee such an FP-chiral-SURMOF-based sensor array as a powerful approach toward inexpensive selective odors sensing applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Effect of Co&#8208;Adsorbed Guest Adsorbates on the Separation of Ethylene/Ethane Mixtures on Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks with Open Metal Sites</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

1H&#8197;MAS&#8197;NMR renders the direct determination of equilibrium uptake and adsorption selectivity of ethylene/ethane in the presence of guest adsorbates (H2O, CO2 and O2) on Mg&#8208;MOF&#8208;74, Zn&#8208;MOF&#8208;74 and UTSA&#8208;74. The detailed host&#8208;guest and guest&#8208;guest interactions in the ternary mixture systems were unraveled from 2D 1H&#8722;1H spin diffusion homo&#8208;nuclear correlation MAS&#8197;NMR and static 25Mg&#8197;NMR experiments.







Abstract
Direct determination of the equilibrium adsorption and spectroscopic observation of adsorbent&#8208;adsorbate interaction is crucial to evaluate the olefin/paraffin separation performance of porous adsorbents. However, the experimental characterization of competitive adsorption of various adsorbates at atomic&#8208;molecular level in the purification of multicomponent gas mixtures is challenging and rarely conducted. Herein, solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy is employed to examine the effect of co&#8208;adsorbed guest adsorbates on the separation of ethylene/ethane mixtures on Mg&#8208;MOF&#8208;74, Zn&#8208;MOF&#8208;74 and UTSA&#8208;74. 1H&#8197;MAS&#8197;NMR facilitates the determination of equilibrium uptake and adsorption selectivity of ethylene/ethane in ternary mixtures. The co&#8208;adsorption of H2O and CO2 significantly leads to the degradation of ethylene uptake and ethylene/ethane selectivity. The detailed host&#8208;guest and guest&#8208;guest interactions are unraveled by 2D 1H&#8722;1H spin diffusion homo&#8208;nuclear correlation and static 25Mg&#8197;NMR experiments. The experimental results verify H2O coordinated on open metal sites can supply a new adsorption site for ethylene and ethane. The effects of guest adsorbates on the adsorption capacity and adsorption selectivity of ethylene/ethane mixtures are in the following order: H2O&gt;CO2&gt;O2. This work provides a direct approach for exploring the equilibrium adsorption and detailed separation mechanism of multicomponent gas mixtures using MOFs adsorbents.

         <title>A Triply Linked Copper(III) Dicarbacorrole Dimer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#946;&#8208;&#946;, meso&#8208;meso, &#946;&#8208;&#946; triply linked dicarbacorrole dimer was synthesized from a meso&#8208;meso singly linked dicarbacorrole dimer precursor via an oxidative fusion reaction. The dimer is capable of stabilizing high&#8208;valent Cu(III) cations and show distinct NIR absorptions.







Abstract
A triply linked dicarbacorrole dimer (7) was synthesized from a new meso&#8208;meso singly linked dicarbacorrole dimer precursor (6) via an oxidative fusion reaction by 2,3&#8208;dichloro&#8208;5,6&#8208;dicyano&#8208;p&#8208;benzoquinone (DDQ) in the presence of trifluoromethanesulfonic acid (TfOH). Single crystal X&#8208;ray structure of 7 adopts a flat conformation with a length as ca. 15.946&#8197;&#197; and a width as 6.903&#8197;&#197;, which can be regarded as a short carbaporphyrinoid tape. Two coordinated Cu ions keeps the +3 oxidation state in 7, as confirmed by NMR spectroscopy, single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). This is in sharp contrast to the Osuka's triply linked tetrapyrrolic corrole dimers, where the inner 3NH form is not stable and thus can only act as a divalent ligand. Due to the non&#8208;aromatic nature of dicarbacorrole macrocycle, the largely decreased HOMO&#8208;LUMO gap and red&#8208;shifted absorption of 7 are best ascribed to the strong electronic interaction between two dipyrromethene&#8208;type chromophores. To our knowledge, this is the first fully fused carbaporphyrinoid dimer with &#946;&#8208;&#946;, meso&#8208;meso, &#946;&#8208;&#946; triply linkages prepared to date.

This protocol allows the formation of pyrazole&#8208;based C2&#8208;quaternary indolin&#8208;3&#8208;ones with high enantioselectivities and regioselectivities. Moreover, gram&#8208;scale synthesis of the 10,10&#8208;difluoro&#8208;tetrahydropyrido[1,2&#8208;a]indole skeleton was successfully achieved without any reduction in both yield and enantioselectivity.

         <title>Post&#8208;Formation of Fused Pentagonal Structure on Fjord Region of Polyaromatic Hydrocarbons under Hydrothermal Conditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Platinum&#8208;catalyzed ring closure of polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) proceeds at lower temperature in water; mono&#8208;cyclization proceeds selectively in the fjord region of PAH to give CP&#8208;PAH products.







Abstract
This study explores the synthesis of cyclopenta&#8208;fused polyaromatic hydrocarbons (CP&#8208;PAHs) via Pt&#8208;catalyzed cyclization in water, focusing on the formation of fused pentagonal rings within heavily fused PAH frameworks. Utilizing platinum catalysts at lower temperatures (200&#8208;260&#8201;&#176;C) in water, led to the successful synthesis of singly cyclized CP&#8208;PAHs. The reaction conditions facilitated the mono&#8208;cyclization of substrates such as dibenzo[g,p]chrysene and its isomers, yielding the desired products while suppressing the formation of bis&#8208;cyclized compounds. The use of Fe2O3 as an additive in conjunction with PtO2 was effective to suppress hydrogenation of the substrates and products. The products exhibited a redshift in UV&#8208;visible absorption and photoluminescence bands due to a decrease in the HOMO&#8722;LUMO energy gap. These findings highlight the potential of Pt&#8208;catalyzed cyclization for the controlled synthesis of CP&#8208;PAHs, with implications for various applications in materials science.

These findings highlight the potential of Pt-catalyzed cyclization for the controlled synthesis of CP-PAHs, with implications for various applications in materials science.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Spectroscopy and Photochemistry of [Al, N, C, O, H]: Connectivity to Aluminium&#8208;Bearing Species in the Universe</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New Al&#8208;bearing molecules consisting of [Al, N, C, O, H] and [Al, N, C, O] have been prepared and characterized in cryogenic argon matrix. The photochemistry of these candidate interstellar species, along with their dissociation reactions to the astronomically detected Al&#8208;bearing molecules, has been disclosed.







Abstract
Aluminium is one of the most abundant metals in the universe and impacts the evolution of various astrophysical environments. Currently detected Al&#8208;bearing molecules represent only a small fraction of the aluminium budget, suggesting that aluminium may reside in other species. AlO and AlOH molecules are abundant in the oxygen&#8208;rich supergiant stars such as VY Canis Majoris, a stellar molecular factory with 60+ molecules including the prebiotic NC&#8208;bearing species. Additional Al&#8208;bearing molecules with N, C, O, and H may form in O&#8208;rich environments with radiation&#8208;accelerated chemistry. Here, we present spectroscopic identification of novel aluminium&#8208;bearing molecules composed of [Al, N, C, O, H] and [Al, N, C, O] from the reactions of Al atoms and HNCO in solid argon matrix, which are potential Al&#8208;bearing molecules in space. Photoinduced transformations among six [Al, N, C, O, H] isomers and three [Al, N, C, O] isomers, along with their dissociation reactions forming the known interstellar species, have been disclosed. These results provide new insight into the chemical network of astronomically detected Al&#8208;bearing species in space.

         <title>Polymeric Nanozyme with SOD Activity Capable of Inhibiting Self&#8208; and Metal&#8208;Induced &#945;&#8208;Synuclein Aggregation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional polymeric nanozyme capable to strongly coordinate CuII is designed, generating complexes with a prominent superoxide dismutase activity. Moreover, the combination of the polymeric platform with the chelator allows the nanozyme to perform its second activity: inhibition of both the self&#8208; and metal&#8208;induced aggregation of &#945;&#8208;synuclein peptides.







Abstract
Despite decades of research, Parkinson's disease is still an idiopathic pathology for which no cure has yet been found. This is partly explained by the multifactorial character of most neurodegenerative syndromes, whose generation involves multiple pathogenic factors. In Parkinson's disease, two of the most important ones are the aggregation of &#945;&#8208;synuclein and oxidative stress. In this work, we address both issues by synthesizing a multifunctional nanozyme based on grafting a pyridinophane ligand that can strongly coordinate CuII, onto biodegradable PEGylated polyester nanoparticles. The resulting nanozyme exhibits remarkable superoxide dismutase activity together with the ability to inhibit the self&#8208;induced aggregation of &#945;&#8208;synuclein into amyloid&#8208;type fibrils. Furthermore, the combination of the chelator and the polymer produces a cooperative effect whereby the resulting nanozyme can also halve CuII&#8208;induced &#945;&#8208;synuclein aggregation.

         <title>Regioselective Synthesis of Hamilton&#8208;Receptor&#8208;Fullerene Oligo&#8208;Adducts for the Supramolecular Binding of Cyanuric Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a new concept for the regioselective synthesis of Hamilton&#8208;receptor and cyanurate functionalized fullerene oligo&#8208;adducts. Based on an in&#8208;situ deprotection and click&#8208;post&#8208;functionalization approach up to twelve Hamilton&#8208;receptor/cyanurate moieties were attached to a suitable fullerene C60&#8208;based hexakis&#8208;adduct precursor. The versatility of this approach was further demonstrated by synthesis of Hamilton&#8208;receptor/cyanurate functionalized mono&#8208;adducts, which were unobtainable by direct Bingel cyclopropanation.







Abstract
A new concept for the regioselective synthesis of Hamilton&#8208;receptor and cyanurate&#8208;functionalized oligo adducts of the fullerene C60 was developed. Based on an in&#8208;situ deprotection and click&#8208;post&#8208;functionalization approach with novel azido precursors, the corresponding fullerene hexakis&#8208;adducts with octahedral addition patterns and up to twelve Hamilton&#8208;receptor/cyanurate moieties surrounding the fullerene sphere were synthesized. The versatility of this approach was further demonstrated by the synthesis of Hamilton&#8208;receptor/cyanurate functionalized fullerene mono&#8208;adducts, which are not accessible by direct cyclopropanation. Several fullerene target compounds were purified by simple washing procedures of the solid crude reaction mixture without the need for chromatography. The resulting fullerene mono&#8208; and hexakis&#8208;adducts were fully characterized and their supramolecular properties were investigated by NMR&#8208;spectroscopy and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC).

         <title>A Single Terminal [NiII&#8722;OH] Catalyst for Direct Julia&#8208;Type Olefination and &#945;&#8208;Alkylation Involving Sulfones and Alcohols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single terminal [NiII&#8722;OH] catalyst is employed for direct Julia&#8208;type olefination of alcohols and &#945;&#8208;alkylation of sulfones using different reaction conditions. Detailed mechanistic studies, including DFT calculations, are undertaken to gain insight on the reaction pathway.







Abstract
A terminal [NiII&#8722;OH] complex 1, supported by triflamide&#8208;functionalized NHC ligands, showed divergent reactivity for the reaction of sulfone with alcohol, contingent on base concentration, temperature, and time. Julia&#8208;type olefination of alcohols with sulfones was achieved using one equiv. of base, whereas lowering base loading to 0.5&#8197;equiv. afforded &#945;&#8208;alkylated sulfones. Besides excellent substrate scope and selectivity, biologically active stilbene derivatives DMU&#8208;212, pinosylvin, resveratrol, and piceatannol were synthesized in high yield under Julia&#8208;type olefination conditions. An extensive array of controlled experiments and DFT calculations provide valuable insight on the reaction pathway.

         <title>Carbohydrate&#8208;Functionalized Anthracene Carboximides as Multivalent Ligands and Bio&#8208;Imaging Agents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbohydrate&#8208;conjugated anthracene carboximides (ACI glycosides) are synthesized which displayed excellent optical properties such as strong fluorescence, large Stokes shift in aq. solution, along with an increased aq. solubility. ACI glycosides show minimal cytotoxicity and are cell permeable as evidenced by the intracellular fluorescence. The glycosides self&#8208;assemble in aq. solutions, forming large vesicular structures and act as a multivalent glycocluster, showing specific lectin binding.







Abstract
Anthracene carboximides (ACIs) conjugated with gluco&#8208;, galacto&#8208; and mannopyranosides are synthesized, by glycosylation of N&#8208;hydroxyethylanthracene carboximide acceptor with glycosyl donors. Glycoconjugation of anthracene carboximide increases the aq. solubility by more than 3&#8208;fold. The glycoconjugates display red&#8208;shifted absorption and emission, as compared to anthracene. Large Stokes shift (&#955;abs/&#955;em=445/525&#8197;nm) and high fluorescence quantum yields (&#934;) of 0.86 and 0.5 occur in THF and water, respectively. The ACI&#8208;glycosides undergo facile photodimerization in aqueous solutions, leading to the formation of the head&#8208;to&#8208;tail dimer, as a mixture of syn and anti&#8208;isomers. Solution phase and solid&#8208;state characterizations by dynamic light scattering (DLS), microscopic imaging by atomic force (AFM) and transmission electron (TEM) microscopies reveal self&#8208;assembled vesicle structures of ACI glycosides. These self&#8208;assembled structures act as multivalent glycoclusters for ligand&#8208;specific lectin binding, as evidenced by the binding of Man&#8208;ACI to Con A, by fluorescence and turbidity assays. The conjugates do not show cellular cytotoxicity (IC50) till concentrations of 50&#8197;&#956;M with HeLa and HepG2&#8197;cell lines and are cell&#8208;permeable, showing strong fluorescence inside the cells. These properties enable the glycoconjugates to be used in cell imaging. The non&#8208;selective cellular uptake of the glycoconjugates suggests a passive diffusion through the membrane.

&lt;p&gt;Anthracene carboximides (&lt;b&gt;ACI&lt;/b&gt;s) conjugated with gluco-, galacto- and mannopyranosides are synthesized, by glycosylation of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-hydroxyethylanthracene carboximide acceptor with glycosyl donors. Glycoconjugation of anthracene carboximide increases the aq. solubility by more than 3-fold. The glycoconjugates display red-shifted absorption and emission, as compared to anthracene. Large Stokes shift (&#955;&lt;sub&gt;abs&lt;/sub&gt;/&#955;&lt;sub&gt;em&lt;/sub&gt;=445/525&#8197;nm) and high fluorescence quantum yields (&#934;) of 0.86 and 0.5 occur in THF and water, respectively. The &lt;b&gt;ACI&lt;/b&gt;-glycosides undergo facile photodimerization in aqueous solutions, leading to the formation of the head-to-tail dimer, as a mixture of &lt;i&gt;syn&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;anti&lt;/i&gt;-isomers. Solution phase and solid-state characterizations by dynamic light scattering (DLS), microscopic imaging by atomic force (AFM) and transmission electron (TEM) microscopies reveal self-assembled vesicle structures of &lt;b&gt;ACI&lt;/b&gt; glycosides. These self-assembled structures act as multivalent glycoclusters for ligand-specific lectin binding, as evidenced by the binding of &lt;b&gt;Man-ACI&lt;/b&gt; to Con A, by fluorescence and turbidity assays. The conjugates do not show cellular cytotoxicity (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;) till concentrations of 50&#8197;&#956;M with HeLa and HepG2&#8197;cell lines and are cell-permeable, showing strong fluorescence inside the cells. These properties enable the glycoconjugates to be used in cell imaging. The non-selective cellular uptake of the glycoconjugates suggests a passive diffusion through the membrane.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Energy Barriers and Gap Between Two Excited States in a Dual&#8208;Emissive Carborane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is hard to experimentally measure both the energy barriers and gap between two excited states of a compound. In this paper, we designed 1&#8208;(pyren&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;yl)&#8208;9,12&#8208;di(p&#8208;tolyl)&#8208;o&#8208;carborane, the ratio of its LE and ICT emission bands is controlled by thermodynamics at higher temperatures and by kinetics at lower temperatures, and thus the energy barriers and gap between the two excited states can be experimentally estimated.







Abstract
A thorough understanding of the internal conversion process between excited states is important for the designing of ideal multiple&#8208;emissive materials. However, it is hard to experimentally measure both the energy barriers and gaps between the excited states of a compound. For a long time, it is dubious if what was measured is the energy gap or barrier between two excited states. In this paper, we designed 1&#8208;(pyren&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;yl)&#8208;9,12&#8208;di(p&#8208;tolyl)&#8208;o&#8208;carborane (2), which shows dual&#8208;emission in solution. Temperature&#8208;dependent fluorescence measurements show that the two emission bands in hexane are corresponding to two different excited states. The ratio of the emission bands is controlled by thermodynamics at higher temperatures and by kinetics at lower temperatures. Thus, the energy barrier and energy gaps between the two excited states of 2 can be experimentally estimated.

         <title>Tuning the Emission Properties of 2,1,3&#8208;Benzothiadiazoles via Regioselective Substitution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Regioselective mono&#8208; and disubstitution of 2,1,3&#8208;benzothiadiazole (BTD) can result in long&#8208;lived fluorescence and overcome strong fluorescence quenching in polar protic solvents, addressing a limitation of many previously described BTD derivatives.







Abstract
The 2,1,3&#8208;benzothiadiazole (BTD) unit is a prominent building block commonly used in various research areas such as optoelectronics and bioimaging. Despite its great versatility, the development of strategies to elaborate BTD has been largely neglected, including exploring its reactivity and understanding how regioselective functionalization can be used to tune the fluorescence emission. Previous focus has primarily been on C4&#8208; or C4,C7&#8208;substitutions. Here, a series of unsymmetrical mono &#8211; and disubstituted BTDs was synthesized and characterized for their photophysical properties. The reaction scope includes all six possible substituent patterns on the BTD benzoid ring (C4&#8208;, C5&#8208;, C4,C5&#8208;, C4,C6&#8208;, C4,C7&#8208; and C5,C6&#8208;substitution), which comprise arrangements that previously been synthetically challenging to access. By introducing a methoxy and/or a phenyl group we demonstrate that the emissive behavior of BTD derivatives strongly depends on the position of the substituent&#8197;(s). We show that regioselective substitution on BTD can engender long&#8208;lived fluorescence and circumvent strong fluorescence quenching in polar protic solvents, which is a limitation of many previously described BTD derivatives.

         <title>Efficient Synthesis of Cyclohepta[b]indoles and Cyclohepta[b]indole&#8208;Indoline Conjugates via RCM, Hydrogenation, and Acid&#8208;Catalyzed Ring Expansion: A Biomimetic Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient catalytic assembly for cyclohepta[b]indoles is achieved through sequential transformations: ring&#8208;closing metathesis, catalytic hydrogenation, and acid&#8208;catalyzed ring expansion. Ring closing metathesis (RCM) and hydrogenation of oxindoles yield spirocyclohexane&#8208;3&#8208;oxindoles. A subsequent spontaneous ring expansion&#8208;aromatization sequence, catalyzed by either Lewis or Br&#248;nsted acid, results in cyclohepta[b]indoles or cyclohepta[b]indole&#8208;indoline conjugates.







Abstract
Cyclohepta[b]indoles, prevalent in natural products and pharmaceuticals, are conventionally accessed via metal or Lewis acid&#8208;mediated cycloadditions with prefunctionalized substrates. Our study introduces an innovative sequential catalytic assembly for synthesizing cyclohepta[b]indoles from readily available isatin derivatives. The process involves three catalytic sequences: ring&#8208;closing metathesis, catalytic hydrogenation, and acid&#8208;catalyzed ring expansion. The RCM of 2,2&#8208;dialkene&#8208;3&#8208;oxindoles, formed by butenyl Grignard addition to 3&#8208;allyl&#8208;3&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;oxindoles, yields versatile spirocyclohexene&#8208;3&#8208;oxindole derivatives. These derivatives undergo further transformations, including dibromination, dihydroxylation, epoxidation, Wacker oxidation at the double bond. Hydrogenation of spirocyclohexene&#8208;3&#8208;oxindole yields spirocyclohexane&#8208;3&#8208;oxindoles. Their subsequent acid&#8208;catalyzed ring expansion/aromatization, dependent on the acid catalyst, results in either cyclohepta[b]indoles or cyclohepta[b]indole&#8208;indoline conjugates, adding a unique synthetic dimension. The utility of this methodology is exemplified through the synthesis of an A&#8208;FABP inhibitor, showcasing its potential in pharmaceutical applications.

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared&#8208;II Nanomaterials for Activatable Photodiagnosis and Phototherapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Near&#8208;infrared&#8208;II (NIR&#8208;II) imaging, combined with activatable materials responsive to tumor microenvironments or external stimulation, reduces tissue scattering, allows deeper tissue penetration and enhances imaging resolution, thus improving tumor diagnosis and treatment. This review outlines recent advances in activatable NIR&#8208;II photodiagnosis and phototherapy, as well as addresses clinical hurdles and strategies for NIR&#8208;II phototherapy.







Abstract
Near&#8208;Infrared&#8208;II (NIR&#8208;II) spans wavelengths between 1,000 to 1,700 nanometers, featuring deep tissue penetration and reduced tissue scattering and absorption characteristics, providing robust support for cancer treatment and tumor imaging research. This review explores the utilization of activatable NIR&#8208;II photodiagnosis and phototherapy based on tumor microenvironments (e.&#8201;g., reactive oxygen species, pH, glutathione, hypoxia) and external stimulation (e.&#8201;g., laser, ultrasound, photothermal) for precise tumor treatment and imaging. Special emphasis is placed on the advancements and advantages of activatable NIR&#8208;II nanomedicines in novel therapeutic modalities like photodynamic therapy, photothermal therapy, and photoacoustic imaging. This encompasses achieving deep tumor penetration, real&#8208;time monitoring of the treatment process, and obtaining high&#8208;resolution, high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio images even at low material concentrations. Lastly, from a clinical perspective, the challenges faced by activatable NIR&#8208;II phototherapy are discussed, alongside potential strategies to overcome these hurdles.

         <title>Steric Effects on Single&#8208;Molecule Conductance in Flat&#8208;Lying Phenanthrene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Previous results identified a 20&#8208;fold difference in conductance between phenanthrene derivatives with different anchoring group positions when measured upright between a gold surface and STM tip. This variation disappears when the phenanthrene derivatives lie flat between the tip and gold surface, all derivatives exhibit a conductance around 0.1 G0.







Abstract
A previous combined experimental and theoretical study found that the position of anchoring groups on a phenanthrene (PHE) backbone played a large role in determining the single&#8208;molecule conductance of the PHE derivative. However, a consistent 0.1 G0 feature was found across all PHE derivatives. To understand this, the previously investigated PHE derivatives were placed flat on a simulated Au substrate with a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) tip over PHE and conductance was calculated using the non&#8208;equilibrium Green's function technique in conjunction with density functional theory (NEGF&#8208;DFT). The location of the tip was varied to find the most conductive and most energetically favorable arrangements, which did not coincide. Furthermore, the variation in conductance found in erect junctions was not present when PHE derivatives were lying flat, with all derivatives calculated to have conductance values around 0.1 G0.

&lt;p&gt;Previous results identified a 20-fold difference in conductance between phenanthrene derivatives with different anchoring group positions when measured upright between a gold surface and STM tip. This variation disappears when the phenanthrene derivatives lie flat between the tip and gold surface, all derivatives exhibit a conductance around 0.1 &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;

         <title>A Visible&#8208;Light Regulated ATP Transport in Retinal&#8208;Modified Pillar[6]arene Layer&#8208;by&#8208;Layer Self&#8208;Assembled Sub&#8208;Nanochannel</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by natural visible light&#8208;responsive protein channels, we have developed the visible light response of retinal modified pillar[6]arenes assembled sub&#8208;nanoscale channel to regulate ATP transport. With visible light irradiation, the isomerization of retinal induced the close of pillar[6]arene's channel to restrain the ATP transport. Without visible light irradiation, ATP can be selectively transported in sub&#8208;nanochannel. This result is better for understanding similar biological processes from the sub&#8208;nanoscale level.







Abstract
Natural light&#8208;responsive rhodopsins play a critical role in visual conversion, signal transduction, energy transmission, etc., which has aroused extensive interest in the past decade. Inspired by these gorgeous works of living beings, scientists have constructed various biomimetic light&#8208;responsive nanochannels to mimic the behaviors of rhodopsins. However, it is still challenging to build stimuli&#8208;responsive sub&#8208;nanochannels only regulated by visible light as the rhodopsins are always at the sub&#8208;nanometer level and regulated by visible light. Pillar[6]arenes have an open cavity of 6.7&#8197;&#197;, which can selectively recognize small organic molecules. They can be connected to ions of ammonium or carboxylate groups on the rims. Therefore, we designed and synthesized the amino and carboxyl&#8208;derived side chains of pillar[6]arenes with opposite charges. The sub&#8208;nanochannels were constructed through the electrostatic interaction of layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer self&#8208;assembled amino and carboxyl&#8208;derived pillar[6]arenes. Then, the natural chromophore of the retinal with visible light&#8208;responsive performance was modified on the upper edge of the sub&#8208;nanochannel to realize the visible light switched on and off. Finally, we successfully constructed a visible light&#8208;responsive sub&#8208;nanochannel, providing a novel method for regulating the selective transport of energy&#8208;donating molecules of ATP.

         <title>Pyrene Functionalized Norbornadiene&#8208;Quadricyclane Fluorescent Photoswitches: Characterization of their Spectral Properties and Application in Imaging of Amyloid Beta Plaques</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study we synthesize and characterise two novel fluorescent norbornadiene derivatives bearing pyrene moieties. In depth spectral and physico&#8208;chemical characterisation is presented; moreover, their application as dyes for imaging of amyloid beta aggregates in Alzheimer's mice models is investigated, with implications for bioimaging and protein aggregate studies.







Abstract
This study presents the synthesis and characterization of two fluorescent norbornadiene (NBD) photoswitches, each incorporating two conjugated pyrene units. Expanding on the limited repertoire of reported photoswitchable fluorescent NBDs, we explore their properties with a focus on applications in bioimaging of amyloid beta (A&#946;) plaques. While the fluorescence emission of the NBD decreases upon photoisomerization, aligning with what has been previously reported, for the first time we observed luminescence after irradiation of the quadricyclane (QC) isomer. We deduce how the observed emission is induced by photoisomerization to the excited state of the parent isomer (NBD) which is then the emitting species. Thorough characterizations including NMR, UV&#8208;Vis, fluorescence, X&#8208;ray structural analysis and density functional theory (DFT) calculations provide a comprehensive understanding of these systems. Notably, one NBD&#8208;QC system exhibits exceptional durability. Additionally, these molecules serve as effective fluorescent stains targeting A&#946; plaques in&#8197;situ, with observed NBD/QC switching within the plaques. Molecular docking simulations explore NBD interactions with amyloid, unveiling novel binding modes. These insights mark a crucial advancement in the comprehension and design of future photochromic NBDs for bioimaging applications and beyond, emphasizing their potential in studying and addressing protein aggregates.

         <title>Exploring the Magnetic Interactions in Two Novel Cyanide&#8208;Bridged Homo&#8208; and Heterometallic Hexadecanuclear Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a prototype of the in&#8208;depth analysis of the origin of magnetic interactions in two novel hexadecanuclear discrete multivalent [Fe16] and heterometallic [Fe6Ni10] PBAs possessing low symmetry structures. Ab initio and BS&#8208;DFT calculations justify the magnetic behaviour caused due to the orthogonal arrangement of the interacting orbitals with a small contribution of the magnetic anisotropy.







Abstract
Two novel isostructural cyanide&#8208;bridged hexadecanuclear complexes with the general formula {[Fe(CN)6]6[M{en(Bn)py}]10}2+ [M=Fe (12+), Ni (22+)] have been synthesized. The structural analyses disclose the presence of multivalent Fe centres with different spin states in complex 12+ whereas all the Fe centres share a conserved oxidation state in complex 22+. The DC magnetic study revealed antiferromagnetic interactions between the adjacent metal centres and ferrimagnetic behaviour in 12+. On the other hand, ferromagnetic interactions were observed in complex 22+ due to nearly orthogonal orientation of the interacting orbitals and poor spatial overlap as observed in BS&#8208;DFT calculations.

&lt;p&gt;This work presents a prototype of the in-depth analysis of the origin of magnetic interactions in two novel hexadecanuclear discrete multivalent [Fe&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;] and heterometallic [Fe&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;Ni&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;] PBAs possessing low symmetry structures. Ab initio and BS-DFT calculations justify the magnetic behaviour caused due to the orthogonal arrangement of the interacting orbitals with a small contribution of the magnetic anisotropy.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two novel isostructural cyanide-bridged hexadecanuclear complexes with the general formula {[Fe(CN)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;[M{en(Bn)py}]&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; [M=Fe (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;), Ni (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;)] have been synthesized. The structural analyses disclose the presence of multivalent Fe centres with different spin states in complex &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; whereas all the Fe centres share a conserved oxidation state in complex &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. The DC magnetic study revealed antiferromagnetic interactions between the adjacent metal centres and ferrimagnetic behaviour in &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. On the other hand, ferromagnetic interactions were observed in complex &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; due to nearly orthogonal orientation of the interacting orbitals and poor spatial overlap as observed in BS-DFT calculations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>U(V) stabilization via aliovalent incorporation of Ln(III) into oxo&#8208;salt framework</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pentavalent uranium compounds are key components of uranium&#8216;s redox chemistry and play important roles in environmental transport. Despite this, well&#8208;characterized U(V) compounds are scarce primarily because of their instability with respect to disproportionation to U(IV) and U(VI). In this work, we provide an alternate route to incorporation of U(V) into a crystalline lattice where different oxidation states of uranium can be stabilized through the incorporation of secondary cations with different sizes and charges. We show that iriginite&#8208;based crystalline layers allow for systematically replacing U(VI) with U(V) through aliovalent substitution of 2+ alkaline&#8208;earth or 3+ rare&#8208;earth cations as dopant ions under high&#8208;temperature conditions, specifically Ca(UVIO2)W4O14 and Ln(UVO2)W4O14 (Ln = Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd, Yb). Evidence for the existence of U(V) and U(VI) is supported by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, high energy resolution X&#8208;ray absorption near edge structure, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and optical absorption spectroscopy. In contrast with other reported U(V) materials, the U(V) single crystals obtained using this route are relatively large (several centimeters) and easily reproducible, and thus provide a substantial improvement in the facile synthesis and stabilization of U(V).</dc:description>

         <title>Three Perovskite Phases with Different Cation Orders in Sm2MnMn(Mn4&#8722;xSbx)O12</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cation order, which can be controlled by synthesis conditions and stoichiometry, plays an important role in properties of perovskite materials. Here we show that aliovalent doping by Sb5+ in Sm2MnMn(Mn4&#8722;xSbx)O12 quadruple perovskite solid solutions can control cation orders in both A and B sites. Samples with 0.4 &#8804; x &#8804; 2 were synthesized by a high&#8208;pressure, high&#8208;temperature method at 6 GPa and 1770 K. Three regions with different cation orders were found at 0.5 &#8804; x &#8804; 1.0, x = 1.5&#8211;1.6, and x = 1.8. The 0.5 &#8804; x &#8804; 1.0 compositions have a B&#8208;site&#8208;disordered and A&#8208;site columnar&#8208;ordered structure with space group P42/nmc; the x = 1.5 and 1.6 samples have a B&#8208;site rock&#8208;salt&#8208;ordered and A&#8208;site columnar&#8208;ordered structure with space group P42/n; the x = 1.8 sample has a B&#8208;site rock&#8208;salt&#8208;ordered and A&#8208;site&#8208;disordered structure with space group P21/n. All the samples show one ferrimagnetic transition: TC increases from 35 K to 73 K for 0.5 &#8804; x &#8804; 1.0, TC = 81 K for x = 1.5 and 1.6, and TC = 53 K for x = 1.8.</dc:description>

         <title>Can Aromaticity be Evaluated Using Atomic Partitions based on the Hilbert&#8208;space?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aromaticity is a fundamental concept in chemistry that explains the stability and reactivity of many compounds by identifying atoms within a molecule that form an aromatic ring. Reliable aromaticity indices focus on electron delocalization and depend on atomic partitions, which give rise to the concept of an atom&#8208;in&#8208;the&#8208;molecule&#160;(AIM). Real&#8208;space atomic partitions present two important drawbacks: a high computational cost and numerical errors, limiting aromaticity measures to medium&#8208;sized molecules with rings up to 12 atoms. This restriction hinders the study of large conjugated systems like porphyrins and nanorings. On the other hand, traditional Hilbert&#8208;space schemes are free of the latter limitations but can be unreliable for the large basis sets required in modern computational chemistry. This paper explores AIMs based on three robust Hilbert&#8208;space partitions &#8208;&#8208;meta&#8208;L&#246;wdin, Natural Atomic Orbitals (NAO), and Intrinsic Atomic Orbitals (IAO)&#8208;&#8208;&#160;which combine the advantages of real&#8208;space partitions without their disadvantages. These partitions can effectively replace real&#8208;space AIMs for evaluating the aromatic character. For the first time, we report multicenter index (MCI) and \iring values for large rings and introduce ESIpy, an open&#8208;source Python code for aromaticity analysis in large conjugated rings.</dc:description>

         <title>A Type of Stable Amides Behaves as Acyl Transfer Reagents upon Visible&#8208;Light Irradiation through&#160;Self&#8208;aromatization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic molecules with light&#8208;modifiable reactivity are important in many fields because they can serve as the &#8220;switch&#8221; for light to trigger chemical processes. Herein, we disclose a new type of stable non&#8208;twisted amides, the reactivity of which can be turned on by light as acyl transfer reagents. Upon photo&#8208;activation, these amides react with various nucleophiles including amines, phenols, hydroxide, thiols, boronic acids, and alkynes either under metal&#8208;free or metal&#8208;catalysis conditions. This reactivity hinges on the design and synthesis of a photo&#8208;activatable reagent (7&#8208;nitro&#8208;5,6&#8208;dihydrophenanthridine), which undergoes self&#8208;aromatization enabled by an internal oxidant under light. This masked acyl donor group is anticipated to be useful in scenarios where light is preferred to trigger a chemical process.</dc:description>

         <title>Robust Radicals Featuring B&#8208; and N&#8208;Embedded Dioxygen&#8208;Bridged Units: Synthesis, Structures, and Optical Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tris(2,4,6trichlorophenyl)methyl (TTM) group has been widely used for constructing organic radicals, but the poor optical stabilities limit the application prospects of the TTM radicals. In this work, the rigid B&#8208; and N&#8208;embedded dioxygen&#8208;bridged (BO and NO) units were attached to the TTM skeleton as the strong electron&#8208;withdrawing and electron&#8208;donating groups, respectively. The rigidity and strong electronic effect of the BO and NO units contribute to the high chemical and optical stability of BO&#8208;TTM and NO&#8208;TTM radicals. Notably, NO&#8208;TTM exhibits near&#8208;infrared emission at 830 nm with a narrow full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 55 nm (100 meV), while BO&#8208;TTM shows blue&#8208;shifted luminescence at 635 nm and a narrower FWHM of merely 43 nm (130 meV). This study has developed a methodology to produce highly efficient and enduring luminescent radicals, which could tune emission properties such as wavelength and FWHM.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#960;&#8209;Conjugated materials are highly attractive owing to their unique optical and electronic properties. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) offer a great opportunity for precise arrangement of building units in a &#960;&#8208;conjugated crystalline matrix and tuning of the properties through choice of functionalities or post&#8208;synthetic modification. With this review, we aim at summarizing both the most representative as well as emerging strategies for the synthesis of &#960;&#8208;conjugated COFs. We give examples of direct synthesis methods with large, &#960;&#8208;extended building blocks. COFs featuring fully conjugated linkages such as vinylene, pyrazine, and azole are discussed. Then, post&#8208;synthetic modification methods that result in the extension of the COF p&#8208;system are reviewed. Throughout, mechanistic insights are presented when available. In the context of their utilization as film devices, we conduct a concise survey of the prominent COF layer deposition techniques reported and their aptness for the deposition of fused aromatic systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Unravelling the Mechanism of CO2 Activation: Insights into Metal&#8208;Metal Cooperativity and Spin&#8208;Orbit Coupling with {3d&#8211;4f} Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Converting CO2 into useful chemicals using metal catalysts is a significant challenge in chemistry. Among the various catalysts reported, transition metal lanthanide hybrid {3d&#8208;4f} complexes stand out for their superior efficiency and site selectivity. However, unlike transition metal catalysts, understanding the origin of this efficiency in lanthanides poses a challenge due to their orbital degeneracy, rendering the application of DFT methods ineffective. In this study, we employed a combination of density functional theory (DFT) and ab initio CASSCF/RASSI&#8208;SO calculations to explore the mechanism of CO2 conversion to cyclic carbonate using a 3d&#8208;4f heterometallic catalyst for the first time. This work unveils the importance of 3d and 4f metal cooperativity and the role of individual spin&#8208;orbit states in dictating the overall efficiency of the catalyst.</dc:description>

         <title>High&#8208;Pressure Synthesis and Recovery of Single Crystals of the Metastable Manganese Carbide, MnCx</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition metal carbides find widespread use throughout industry due to their high strength and resilience under extreme conditions. However, they remain largely limited to compounds formed from the early d&#8208;block elements, since the mid&#8208;to&#8208;late transition metals do not form thermodynamically stable carbides. We report here the high&#8208;pressure bulk synthesis of large single crystals of a novel metastable manganese carbide compound,MnCxP63/mmc, which adopts the anti&#8208;NiAs&#8208;type structure with significant substoichiometry at the carbon sites. We demonstrate how synthesis pressure modulates the carbon loading, with~40% occupancy being achieved at 9.9 GPa.</dc:description>

         <title>Improved access to potent anticancer tubulysins and linker&#8208;functionalized payloads via an all&#8208;on&#8208;resin</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tubulysins are among the most recent antimitotic compounds to enter into antibody/peptide&#8208;drug conjugate (ADC/PDC) development. Thus far, the design of the most promising tubulysin payloads relied on simplifying their structures, e.g., by using small tertiary amide N&#8208;substituents (Me, Et, Pr) on tubuvaline residue. Cumbersome solution&#8208;phase approaches are typically used for both syntheses and functionalization with cleavable linkers. p&#8208;Aminobenzyl quaternary ammonium (PABQ) linkers were a remarkable advancement for targeted delivery, but the procedures to incorporate them into tubulysins are only of moderate efficiency. Here we describe a novel all&#8208;on&#8208;resin strategy permitting a loss&#8208;free resin linkage and an improved access to super potent tubulysin analogs showing close resemblance to the natural compounds. For the first time, a protocol enables the integration of on&#8208;resin tubulysin derivatization with, e.g., a maleimido&#8208;Val&#8208;Cit&#8208;PABQ linker, which is a notable progress for the payload&#8208;PABQ&#8208;linker technology. The strategy also allows tubulysin diversification of the internal amide N&#8208;substituent, thus enabling to screen a tubulysin library for the discovery of new potent analogs. This work provides ADC/PDC developers with new tools for both rapid access to new derivatives and easier linker&#8208;attachment and functionalization.</dc:description>

         <title>Indole C5&#8208;Selective Bromination of Indolo[2,3&#8208;a]quinolizidine Alkaloids via In Situ&#8208;Generated Indoline Intermediate</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The indole C5&#8208;selective bromination of indolo[2,3&#8208;a]quinolizidine alkaloids by adding nearly equimolar amounts of Br3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;PyH and HCl in MeOH is disclosed. The resulting reaction plausibly proceeds through an indoline intermediate by the nucleophilic addition of MeOH to the C3&#8208;brominated indolenine intermediate. These simple, mild, and metal&#8208;free conditions are suitable for late&#8208;stage chemical conversions in total synthesis and medicinal chemistry.







Abstract
There are many indole alkaloids that contain diverse functional groups attached to the benzene ring on the indole core. Promising biological activities of these alkaloids have been reported. Herein, we report the indole C5&#8208;selective bromination of indolo[2,3&#8208;a]quinolizidine alkaloids by adding nearly equimolar amounts of Br3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;PyH and HCl in MeOH. The resulting reaction plausibly proceeds through an indoline intermediate by the nucleophilic addition of MeOH to the C3&#8208;brominated indolenine intermediate. Data support the intermediacy of a C3&#8208;, C5&#8208;dibrominated indolenine intermediate as a brominating agent. These conditions demonstrate excellent selectivity for indole C5 bromination of natural products and their derivatives. Thus, these simple, mild, and metal&#8208;free conditions allow for selective, late&#8208;stage bromination followed by further chemical modifications. The utility of the brominated product prepared from naturally occurring yohimbine was demonstrated through various derivatizations, including a bioinspired heterodimerization reaction.

         <title>C&#8208;Terminal Decarboxylation of Proline&#8208;Derived Building Blocks for Protein&#8208;Binding Peptides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Using a set of conformationally restricted Proline&#8208;derived Modules (ProMs), our group has recently succeeded in developing inhibitors for the enabled/vasodilator&#8208;stimulated phosphoprotein homology 1 (EVH1) domain, which is a key mediator of cell migration and plays an important role in tumor metastasis. While these (formally) pentapeptidic compounds show nanomolecular binding affinities towards EVH1, their drug&#8208;like properties and cell permea&#173;bility need to be further optimized before they can be clinically tested as therapeutic agents against metastasis. In this study, we sought to improve these properties by removing the C&#8208;terminal carboxylic acid function of our peptoids, either by late&#8208;stage decarboxylation or by direct synthesis. For late&#8208;stage decarboxy&#173;lation of ProM&#8208;like systems, a method for reductive halo decarboxylation was optimized and applied to several proline&#8208;derived substrates. In this way, a series of new decarboxy ProMs suitable as building blocks for decarboxy EVH1 inhibitors were obtained. In addition, we incorporated decarboxy&#8208;ProM&#8208;1 into the penta&#173;peptide&#8208;like compound Ac[2&#8208;Cl&#8208;F][ProM&#8208;2][Decarb&#8208;ProM&#8208;1], which showed similar affinity towards EVH1 as the methyl ester derivative (Ac[2&#8208;Cl&#8208;F][ProM&#8208;2][ProM1]OMe).

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Using a set of conformationally restricted Proline-derived Modules (ProMs), our group has recently succeeded in developing inhibitors for the enabled/vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein homology 1 (EVH1) domain, which is a key mediator of cell migration and plays an important role in tumor metastasis. While these (formally) pentapeptidic compounds show nanomolecular binding affinities towards EVH1, their drug-like properties and cell permea&#173;bility need to be further optimized before they can be clinically tested as therapeutic agents against metastasis. In this study, we sought to improve these properties by removing the C-terminal carboxylic acid function of our peptoids, either by late-stage decarboxylation or by direct synthesis. For late-stage decarboxy&#173;lation of ProM-like systems, a method for reductive halo decarboxylation was optimized and applied to several proline-derived substrates. In this way, a series of new decarboxy ProMs suitable as building blocks for decarboxy EVH1 inhibitors were obtained. In addition, we incorporated decarboxy-ProM-1 into the penta&#173;peptide-like compound Ac[2-Cl-F][ProM-2][Decarb-ProM-1], which showed similar affinity towards EVH1 as the methyl ester derivative (Ac[2-Cl-F][ProM-2][ProM1]OMe). However, despite better calculated drug-like properties, this compound did not inhibit chemotaxis in a cellular assay.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We describe a method for the synthesis of various 2&#8208;silyloxy&#8208;2&#8208;norbornen&#8208;7&#8208;ones that exploits the specific reactivity of the 1,4&#8208;bis(silyloxy)&#8208;1,3&#8208;cyclopentadiene framework, which is generated under silylating reaction conditions from a 2,2&#8208;disubstituted&#8208;1,3&#8208;cyclopentanedione bearing the picolinoyloxy group at the 2' position of its C&#8208;2 side chain. Our reaction system generates a carbocation via the release of the acyloxy group, forms a 4,5&#8208;cis&#8208;fused ring skeleton via the intramolecular attack at the resulting carbocation by a silyloxy&#8208;substituted carbon in the 1,4&#8208;bis(silyloxy)&#8208;1,3&#8208;cyclopentadiene moiety, and induces the skeletal rearrangement of the bicyclic core. This novel transformation of a 1,3&#8208;cyclopentanedione moiety can be developed for the synthesis of other bicyclic frameworks fused to cyclopentenones.</dc:description>

         <title>Collective Total Synthesis of Ecklonialactones, Eiseniachlorides and Analogs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ecklonialactones, Eiseniachlorides, and Egregiachlorides are synthesized in living organisms via the lipoxygenase&#8208;mediated oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids. Originally isolated and identified from brown seaweed (Ecklonia stolonifera, Eisenia bicyclis, and Egregia menziesii), and later replicated on milligram scale through chemical synthesis, the full biological activities of these compounds remain to be elucidated. To bridge this gap in knowledge, we propose a unified methodology to synthesize the 14&#8208;membered macrocyclic structures of Ecklonialactones, Eiseniachlorides and analogs using a versatile and convergent approach. This study delineates the synthesis of Ecklonialactone A, B, C, D, and Eiseniachlorides A and B, as well as ent&#8208;Ecklonialactone B, 16&#8208;epi&#8208;Ecklonialactone B and 12,13&#8208;diepi&#8208;Ecklonialactone B.</dc:description>

         <title>Homochiral and Heterochiral Self&#8208;Sorting Assemblies of Antiaromatic Ni(II) Norcorrole Dimers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently, &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacked antiaromatic &#960;&#8208;systems have received considerable attention because they&#160;can exhibit stacked&#8208;ring aromaticity&#160;due to&#160;substantial intermolecular orbital interactions. Here, we report three antiaromatic norcorrole dimers that self&#8208;assemble to form supramolecular architectures through chiral self&#8208;sorting. A&#160;2,2&#8217;&#8208;linked norcorrole dimer&#160;with 3,5&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphenyl groups forms a&#160;&#960;&#8208;stacked dimer both in solid and solution states&#160;via homochiral self&#8208;sorting. Its association constant in solution is&#160;(3.6 &#177; 1.7) &#215; 105&#160;M&#8211;1&#160;at 20 &#176;C. In the solid state,&#160;3,3&#8217;&#8208;linked norcorrole dimers&#160;with 3,5&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphenyl and phenyl groups afford macrocyclic and helical supramolecular assemblies via heterochiral and homochiral self&#8208;sorting, respectively. Notably, the subtle modification in the substituent resulted in a complete change in the structure of the aggregates and the chiral self&#8208;sorting mode. The present findings demonstrate that structural manipulation in antiaromatic monomer units leads to the formation of various supramolecular assemblies on the basis of the attractive interactions between antiaromatic&#160;&#960;&#8208;systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Helicene Appended Benzothiadiazoles as Chiral Emitters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A homologous series of 4,7&#8208;bis(aryl) substituted benzothiadiazole (BTD) compounds, containing the helicenic derivatives bis([4]helicene), bis([5]helicene) and bis([6]helicene), have been prepared upon a double Suzuki coupling between 3,6&#8208;bis(pinacolyl&#8208;borane)&#8208;BTD and the corresponding bromo&#8208;aryl precursors. The single crystal X&#8208;ray structure of the bis([4]helicene) compound shows the existence of both helicities (M) and (P) on the same molecule. All the compounds of the series are highly emissive in solution, with quantum yields of the emission ranging from 50 to 91%. The enantiopure compounds (M,M) and (P,P) for the BTD&#8208;bis([6]helicene) have been prepared from the corresponding enantiopure 2&#8208;bromo&#8208;[6]helicene precursors. Their chiroptical properties have been investigated in correlation with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, which allowed to confidently assign the absolute configuration of the helicene arms and to characterize the different electronic transitions, including the low energy charge transfer excitation from helicenes to BTD. The enantiomerically pure fluorophores (M,M)&#8208; and (P,P)&#8208;BTD&#8208;bis([6]helicene), which exist in solution as two main conformers, according to the DFT calculations, show CPL activity in solution, with glum factors of &#8776; 1.7&#215;10&#8211;3 at lem = 525 nm, and also in the solid state, with glum factors of &#8776; 1.2&#215;10&#8211;3 in spite of the strong decrease of the quantum efficiency.</dc:description>

         <title>Fabrication of Fe/KB composite as sulfur host for Li&#8208;S battery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium sulfur battery is a novel kind of secondary battery which has high energy density, however its application is greatly affected by the shuttle effect of polysulfides generated in the redox reaction of cathode electrode. Metal active sites are supposed as effective catalysts which can absorb and accelerate the conversion efficiency of&#160;lithium polysulfides, thus the shuttle effect will be alleviated. In this work, we conducted a simple way to prepare a metal Fe doped ketjen black to serve as the sulfur host of lithium sulfur battery. Ketjen black has a large specific surface area and rich porous structure, while Fe nanodot is an excellent catalyst for lithium polysulfides. Because of these advantages, the Fe/KB host can effectively confine a large amount of active material and accelerate its, therefore the Fe/KB&#8208;S cathode electrode show an excellent electrochemical performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Styrylbenzazole Photoswitches and Evaluation of their Photochemical Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Styrylbenzazoles form a promising yet under&#8208;represented class of photoswitches that can perform a light&#8208;driven E&#8208;Z isomerization of the central alkene double bond without undergoing irreversible photocyclization, typical of the parent stilbene. In this work, we report the synthesis and photochemical study of 23 styrylbenzazole photoswitches. Their thermal stabilities, quantum yields, maximum absorption wavelengths and photostationary state (PSS) distributions can be tuned by changing the benzazole heterocycle and the substitution pattern on the aryl ring. In particular, we found that push&#8208;pull systems show large redshifts of the maximum absorption wavelengths and the highest quantum yields, whereas ortho&#8208;substituted styrylbenzazole photoswitches exhibit the most favorable PSS ratios. Taking advantage of both design principles, we produced 2,6&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;4&#8208;(dimethylamino)&#8208;styrylbenzothiazole, a thermally stable and efficient P&#8208;type photoswitch which displays negative photochromism upon irradiation with visible light up to 470 nm to obtain a near&#8208;quantitative isomerization with a very high quantum yield of 59%. Furthermore, 4&#8208;hydroxystyrylbenzothiazole was demonstrated to be a pH&#8208;sensitive switch which exhibits a 100 nm redshift upon deprotonation. Ortho&#8208;methylation of this switch improved the obtained PSS ratio in its deprotonated state from E:Z=53:47 to E:Z=18:82. We anticipate that this relatively unexplored class of photoswitches will form a valuable expansion of the current family of photoswitches.</dc:description>

         <title>Luminescent tetranuclear copper(I) and gold(I) heterobimetallic complexes: A phosphine acetylide amidinate&#160;orthogonal ligand framework for selective complexation</title>

         <dc:description>The synthesis of phosphine acetylide amidinate stabilized copper(I) and gold(I) heterobimetallic complexes was achieved by reacting ligand [{Ph2PC&#8801;CC(NDipp)2}Li(thf)3] (Dipp = N,N&#8217;&#8208;diisopropylphenyl) with CuCl and Au(tht))Cl, yielding the eight membered ring [{Ph2PC&#8801;CC(NDipp)2}2Cu2] and the twelve membered ring [{Ph2PC&#8801;CC(NDipp)2}2Au2]. {Ph2PC&#8801;CC(NDipp)2}2Cu2] features a Cu2 unit, which is bridged by two amidinate ligands, served as a metalloligand to synthesize the heterobimetallic CuI/AuI complexes [{(AuX)Ph2PC&#8801;CC(NDipp)2}2Cu2] (X = Cl, C6F5). In these reactions the central ring structure is retained. In contrast, when the twelve membered ring [{Ph2PC&#8801;CC(NDipp)2}2Au2] was reacted with CuX (X = Cl, Br, I and Mes), the reaction led to rearrangement of the central ring structure to give [{(AuX)Ph2PC&#8801;CC(NDipp)2}2Cu2] (X = Cl, Br, I and Mes), which feature the same the eight membered Cu2 ring as above. These compounds were also synthesized by a one&#8208;pot reaction. The luminescent heterobimetallic complexes were further investigated for their photophysical properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Variation in Catalytic Efficacies of a 2D pH&#8208;Stable MOF by Altering Activation Methods</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chemically robust 2D MOF, IITKGP&#8208;60, has been strategically designed and developed, which showed excellent catalytic activity in three&#8208;component Strecker reaction and Knoevenagel condensation reaction under solvent&#8208;free condition. The significant effect of activation methods on its catalytic performances is specifically highlighted.







Abstract
Although it is well&#8208;known that the Lewis acidity of Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks (MOFs) can effectively enhance their catalytic activity in organic transformations, access to these Lewis&#8208;acidic sites remains a key hurdle to widespread applications of Lewis&#8208;acidic catalysis by MOFs. Easy accessibility of strong Lewis acidic sites onto 2D MOFs by using proper activation methods can be a cornerstone in attaining desired catalytic performance.

&lt;p&gt;A chemically robust 2D MOF, &lt;b&gt;IITKGP-60&lt;/b&gt;, has been strategically designed and developed, which showed excellent catalytic activity in three-component Strecker reaction and Knoevenagel condensation reaction under &lt;i&gt;solvent-free&lt;/i&gt; condition. The significant effect of activation methods on its catalytic performances is specifically highlighted.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although it is well-known that the Lewis acidity of Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs) can effectively enhance their catalytic activity in organic transformations, access to these Lewis-acidic sites remains a key hurdle to widespread applications of Lewis-acidic catalysis by MOFs. Easy accessibility of strong Lewis acidic sites onto 2D MOFs by using proper activation methods can be a cornerstone in attaining desired catalytic performance. Herein, we report a new 2D chemically stable MOF, &lt;b&gt;IITKGP-60&lt;/b&gt;, which displayed excellent framework robustness over a wide pH range (2&#8211;12). Benefiting from the abundant open metal sites (OMSs) and framework robustness, the catalytic activity of the developed material was explored in one-pot three-component Strecker reaction and Knoevenagel condensation reaction. Moreover, the developed catalyst is superior in catalyzing the reactions involving sterically hindered substrate (1-naphthaldehyde) with high turnover number. A comparative catalytic study was conducted using different activation methods (chloroform and methanol exchanged activated samples), highlighting the significant effect of activation methods on its catalytic performances. The sustainable synthetic pathway under &lt;i&gt;solvent-free&lt;/i&gt; conditions for a broad scope of substrates using low catalyst loading and excellent recyclability made the developed pH-stable framework a promising heterogeneous catalyst.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Investigation of Isolated IrF5&#8722;, IrF6&#8722; Anions and M[IrF6] (M=Na, K, Rb, Cs) Ion Pairs by Matrix&#8208;Isolation Spectroscopy and Relativistic Quantum&#8208;Chemical Calculations</title>

         <dc:description>
The IR spectra of molecular IrF5&#8722;, IrF6&#8722; anions and M[IrF6] (M=Na, K, Rb, Cs) ion pairs isolated in rare&#8208;gas matrices are presented. The closed&#8208;shell IrF6&#8722; anion with Oh symmetry stabilized by SOC effects has been verified spectroscopically in the low&#8208;temperature matrices. The M[IrF6] ion pairs with C3v symmetry feature coordination of an alkali metal ion to three F atoms.







Abstract
The molecular IrF5&#8722;, IrF6&#8722; anions and M[IrF6] (M=Na, K, Rb, Cs) ion pairs were prepared by co&#8208;deposition of laser&#8208;ablated alkali metal fluorides MF with IrF6 and isolated in solid neon or argon matrices under cryogenic conditions. The free anions were obtained as well by co&#8208;deposition of IrF6 with laser&#8208;ablated metals (Ir or Pt) as electron sources. The products were characterized in a combined analysis of matrix IR spectroscopy and electronic structure calculations using two&#8208;component quasi&#8208;relativistic DFT methods accounting for spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC) effects as well as multi&#8208;reference configuration&#8208;interaction (MRCI) approaches with SOC. Inclusion of SOC is crucial in the prediction of spectra and properties of IrF6&#8722; and its alkali&#8208;metal ion pairs. The observed IR bands and the computations show that the IrF6&#8722; anion adopts an Oh structure in a nondegenerate ground state stabilized by SOC effects, and not a distorted D4h structure in a triplet ground state as suggested by scalar&#8208;relativistic calculations. The corresponding &#8220;closed&#8208;shell&#8221; M[IrF6] ion pairs with C3v symmetry are stabilized by coordination of an alkali metal ion to three F atoms, and their structural change in the series from M=Na to Cs was proven spectroscopically. There is no evidence for the formation of IrF7, IrF7&#8722; or M[IrF7] (M=Na, K, Rb, Cs) ion pairs in our experiments.

         <title>Formation, Selective Encapsulation, and Tautomerization Control of Isoindolone Utilizing Guanidinium Sulfonate Frameworks</title>

Hydrogen bonding frameworks can do it all; catalysis, selective encapsulation, and control of tautomeric state.







Abstract
Herein we report the use of tetrakis (guanidinium) pyrenetetrasulfonate (G4PYR) and bis (guanidinium) 1,5&#8208;napthalene disulfonate (G2NDS) to catalyze the cyclization of 2&#8208;cyanobenzamide (1) to isoindolone (2). Moreover, we demonstrate the remarkable selectivity of these guanidinium organosulfonate hosts in encapsulating 2 over 1. By thoroughly investigating the intramolecular cyclization reaction, we determined that guanidinium and the organosulfonate moiety acts as the catalyst in this process. Additionally, 2 is selectively encapsulated, even in mixtures of other structurally similar heterocycles like indole. Furthermore, the tautomeric state of 2 (amino isoindolone (2&#8211;A) and imino isoindolinone forms (2&#8211;I)) can be controlled by utilizing different guanidinium organosulfonate frameworks.

         <title>Modular Construction of Vinylene&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks with Tunable Emission for Tumor Visualization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of isostructural vinylene&#8208;linked 2D COFs were constructed based on a new tetratopic D2h&#8208;symmetric monomer with two highly electron deficient s&#8208;triazine core. The fluorescence emission of the resulting D&#8722;A type COFs red&#8208;shifted with respect to the enhancement of the electronegativity of the donor unit. Their ability in non&#8208;invasive tumor visualization was further demonstrated.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with ordered &#960; structures are very promising in porous light&#8208;emitting materials. However, most of these COFs are either poor in luminescence or lack of water&#8208;stability. Herein, a series of isostructural D&#8722;A vinylene&#8208;linked COFs were constructed based a new D2h symmetric linker 1,4&#8208;bis(4,6&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)benzene (TMTA) with high crystallinity, comparative high surface area and excellent chemical/thermal stability. Impressively, their adsorption and luminescence wavelength vary with respect to the density of &#960;&#8208;systems in the electron&#8208;donating group, which constitute the foundation for molecular engineering the luminescent properties of vinylene&#8208;linked COFs. The DFT calculations further established the relationship between the luminescence properties and the donor electronic structure. Moreover, one of representative COF named FZU&#8208;203 showed inspiring applications in bioimaging, which may further provide strategic guidance for the use of vinylene&#8208;linked COFs as fluorescent nanoprobes in non&#8208;invasive medical diagnosis and visualization therapy of tumors.

         <title>Unspecific Peroxygenase (UPO) can be Tuned for Oxygenation or Halogenation Activity by Controlling the Reaction pH</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heme&#8208;dependent unspecific peroxygenases (UPOs) catalyze the selective oxygenation of organic molecules at pH&#8197;6.0 using hydrogen peroxide to form the oxidant Compound I at the active site. Compound I can also be recruited for the oxidation of halide ions in the presence of peroxide at pH&#8197;3.0 to generate hypohalous acid for halogenation reactions. Hence, the activity of UPOs towards a substrate such as thymol can be tuned to give oxygenated or halogenated products dependent upon the pH of the reaction.







Abstract
Unspecific Peroxygenases (UPOs) are increasingly significant enzymes for selective oxygenations as they are stable, highly active and catalyze their reactions at the expense of only hydrogen peroxide as the oxidant. Their structural similarity to chloroperoxidase (CPO) means that UPOs can also catalyze halogenation reactions based upon the generation of hypohalous acids from halide and H2O2. Here we show that the halogenation and oxygenation modes of a UPO can be stimulated at different pH values. Using simple aromatic compounds such as thymol, we show that, at a pH of 3.0 and 6.0, either brominated or oxygenated products respectively are produced. Preparative 100&#8197;mg scale transformations of substrates were performed with 60&#8211;72&#8201;% isolated yields of brominated products obtained. A one&#8208;pot bromination&#8208;oxygenation cascade reaction on 4&#8208;ethylanisole, in which the pH was adjusted from 3.0 to 6.0 at the halfway stage, yielded sequentially brominated and oxygenated products 1&#8208;(3&#8208;bromo&#8208;4&#8208;methoxyphenyl)ethyl alcohol and 3&#8208;bromo&#8208;4&#8208;methoxy acetophenone with 82&#8201;% combined conversion. These results identify UPOs as an unusual example of a biocatalyst that is tunable for entirely different chemical reactions, dependent upon the reaction conditions.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unspecific Peroxygenases (UPOs) are increasingly significant enzymes for selective oxygenations as they are stable, highly active and catalyze their reactions at the expense of only hydrogen peroxide as the oxidant. Their structural similarity to chloroperoxidase (CPO) means that UPOs can also catalyze halogenation reactions based upon the generation of hypohalous acids from halide and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Here we show that the halogenation and oxygenation modes of a UPO can be stimulated at different pH values. Using simple aromatic compounds such as thymol, we show that, at a pH of 3.0 and 6.0, either brominated or oxygenated products respectively are produced. Preparative 100&#8197;mg scale transformations of substrates were performed with 60&#8211;72&#8201;% isolated yields of brominated products obtained. A one-pot bromination-oxygenation cascade reaction on 4-ethylanisole, in which the pH was adjusted from 3.0 to 6.0 at the halfway stage, yielded sequentially brominated and oxygenated products 1-(3-bromo-4-methoxyphenyl)ethyl alcohol and 3-bromo-4-methoxy acetophenone with 82&#8201;% combined conversion. These results identify UPOs as an unusual example of a biocatalyst that is tunable for entirely different chemical reactions, dependent upon the reaction conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Plasma&#8208;Engraved Lattice&#8208;Matched NiO/NiFe2O4 Heterostructure with Ample Oxygen Vacancies for Efficient Water Electrolysis and Zn&#8208;Air Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
A lattice&#8208;matched NiO/NiFe2O4 heterophase hybrid catalyst with ample oxygen vacancies was reported via the heterogeneous interface and defect engineering strategy. The optimized geometry/electronic structure can effectively facilitate the mass transport and charge transfer process, thereby the as&#8208;prepared catalyst shows a favorable OER performance toward efficient water splitting and Zn&#8208;air batteries.







Abstract
Heterogeneous interface and defect engineering offer effective pathways to accelerate oxygen evolution reaction (OER) charge transfer kinetics and motivate optimal intrinsic catalytic activity. Herein, we report the lattice&#8208;matched NiO/NiFe2O4 heterostructure with ample oxygen vacancies (Vo&#8208;NiO/NiFe2O4) induced by a feasible hydrothermal followed by calcination and plasma&#8208;engraving assistant technique, which shows the unique porous microflower arrangement of intertwined nanosheets. Benefitting from the synergetic effects between lattice&#8208;matched heterointerface and oxygen vacancies induce the strong electronic coupling, optimized OH&#8722;/O2 diffusion pathway and ample active sites, thus&#8208;prepared Vo&#8208;NiO/NiFe2O4 presents a favorable OER performance with a low overpotential (261&#8197;mV @ 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and small Tafel slope (39.4&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1), even surpassing commercial RuO2 catalyst. Additionally, the two&#8208;electrode configuration water electrolyzer and rechargeable zinc&#8208;air battery assembled by Vo&#8208;NiO/NiFe2O4 catalyst show the potential practical application directions. This work provides an innovative avenue for strengthening OER performance toward water electrolysis and Zn&#8208;air batteries via the interface and vacancy engineering strategy.

         <title>Thio and Seleno&#8208; Psoralens as Efficient Triplet Harvesting Photosensitizers For Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Psoralen (Pso) molecule finds extensive applications in photo&#8208;chemotherapy, courtesy of its triplet state forming ability. Sulfur and selenium replacement of exocyclic carbonyl oxygen of organic chromophores foster efficient triplet harvesting with near unity triplet quantum yield. These triplet&#8208;forming photosensitizers are useful in Photodynamic Therapy (PDT) applications for selective apoptosis of cancer cells. In this work, we have critically assessed the effect of the sulfur and selenium substitution at the exocyclic carbonyl (TPso and SePso, respectively) and endocyclic oxygen positions of Psoralen. It resulted in a significant redshifted absorption spectrum to access the PDT therapeutic window with increased oscillator strength. The reduction in singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap and enhancement in the spin&#8208;orbit coupling values increase the number of intersystem crossing (ISC) pathways to the triplet manifold, which shortens the ISC lifetime from 10&#8208;5 s for Pso to 10&#8208;8 s for TPso and 10&#8208;9 s for SePso. The intramolecular photo&#8208;induced electron transfer process, a competitive pathway to ISC, is also considerably curbed by these exocyclic functionalizations. In addition, a maximum of 115 GM of two&#8208;photon absorption (2PA) with IR absorption (660&#8208;1050 nm) confirms that the Psoralen skeleton can be effectively tweaked via single chalcogen atom replacement to design a suitable PDT photosensitizer.</dc:description>

         <title>Supramolecular Sequential Light&#8208;Harvesting Systems for Constructing White LED Device and Latent Fingerprint Imaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The fabrication of supramolecular light&#8208;harvesting systems (LHS) with sequential energy transfer is of significance in utilizing light energy. In this study, we report the non&#8208;covalent self&#8208;assembly of a sequential LHS by pillar[5]arene&#8208;based host&#8208;guest interaction in water and its applications in white light&#8208;emitting diode (LED) device and latent fingerprint imaging. The host&#8208;guest complex WP5&#11815;G self&#8208;assembles into nanoparticles in water and shows enhanced aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) effect. The nanoparticles can be further used to construct sequential LHS with fluorescent dyes 4,7&#8208;di(2&#8208;thienyl)&#8208;benzo[2,1,3]thiadiazole (DBT) and sulforhodamine 101 (SR101). Impressively, the system shows white&#8208;light emission when the molar ratio of WP5&#11815;G/DBT/SR101 is 1100/2/16. The material can be coated on a LED bulb to achieve white&#8208;light emission. In addition, the sequential LHS exhibit color&#8208;tunable fluorescence including red emission, which have been successfully applied to high&#8208;resolution imaging of latent fingerprints. Therefore, we demonstrated a general strategy for the construction of sequential LHS in water based on macrocyclic host&#8208;guest interaction and explored its multi&#8208;functional applications in white&#8208;light LED device and imaging of latent fingerprints, which will promote future development and application of supramolecular LHSs.</dc:description>

         <title>A Novel Approach of Electrocatalytic Deamination from Aromatic Amide to Diarylimide on Ni&#8208;PTFE Modified Electrode</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A hydrophobic Ni&#8208;PTFE modified electrode has been prepared by constant current and cathodic electroplating with a nickel sheet as substrate in a PTFE suspension. Then the Ni&#8208;PTFE modified electrode was used for electroreduction from aromatic amide to diarylimide. The electrochemical characterizations such as cyclic voltammogram, EIS, polarization curves, and electrode stability have been carried out by electrochemical workstation. The structure of the electroreduction product diarylimide was characterized by 1HNMR, FT&#8208;IR, MS(Mass Spectrum), and EA(Elemental Analyzer). Based on the hydrophobicity of the electrode, an approach suggested that the phenyl ketone radical may be formed by electroreductive deamination at the cathode. With the construction of C&#8208;N bond by the radical coupling, the electrocatalytic reduction may be comprised of a one&#8208;electron process including an ECC (Electrochemical&#8208;Chemical&#8208;Chemical) process. The electroreduction of aromatic amide to diarylimide may be controlled by both charge migration and concentration polarization. Electrocatalytic reduction of aromatic amides on Ni&#8208;PTFE&#8208;modified electrodes is all well conversion ratio.</dc:description>

         <title>Cleaving Folded RNA by Multifunctional DNAzyme Nanomachines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Both tight and specific binding of folded biological mRNA is required for gene silencing by oligonucleotide gene therapy agents. However, this is fundamentally impossible using the conventional oligonucleotide probes according to the affinity/specificity dilemma. This study addresses this problem by using multicomponent agents (dubbed &#8216;DNA nanomachine&#8217; or DNM) for RNA binding. DNMs bind RNA by four short RNA binding arms, which ensures tight and highly selective RNA binding. Along with the improved affinity, DNM maintained the high sequence selectivity of the conventional DNAzymes. DNM enabled up to 3&#8208;fold improvement in DNAzymes catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) by facilitating both RNA substrate binding and product release steps of the catalytic cycle. This study demonstrates that multicomponent probes organized in sophisticated structures can help to achieve the balance between affinity and selectivity in recognizing folded RNA and thus creates a foundation for applying complex DNA nanostructures in gene therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>Rational Design of Coumarin&#8208;Based Hybridized Local and Charge&#8208;Transfer Blue Emitters for Solution&#8208;Processed Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hybridized local and charge&#8208;transfer (HLCT) with the utilization of both singlet and triplet excitons through the "hot excitons" channel have great application potential in highly efficient blue organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). The proportion of charge&#8208;transfer (CT) and locally excited (LE) components in the relevant singlet and triplet states makes a big difference for the high&#8208;lying reverse intersystem crossing process. Herein, three novel donor (D)&#8208;acceptor (A) type HLCT materials, 7&#8208;([1,1'&#8208;biphenyl]&#8208;4&#8208;yl(9,9&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;9H&#8208;fluoren&#8208;2&#8208;yl)amino)&#8208;3&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1H&#8208;isochromen&#8208;1&#8208;one (pPh&#8208;7P), 7&#8208;([1,1'&#8208;biphenyl]&#8208;4&#8208;yl(9,9&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;9H&#8208;fluoren&#8208;2&#8208;yl)amino)&#8208;3&#8208;methyl&#8208;1H&#8208;isochromen&#8208;1&#8208;one (pPh&#8208;7M), and 6&#8208;([1,1'&#8208;biphenyl]&#8208;4&#8208;yl(9,9&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;9H&#8208;fluoren&#8208;2&#8208;yl)amino)&#8208;3&#8208;methyl&#8208;1H&#8208;isochromen&#8208;1&#8208;one (pPh&#8208;6M), were rationally designed and synthesized with diphenylamine derivative as donor and oxygen heterocyclic coumarin moiety as acceptors. The proportions of CT and LE components were fine controlled by changing the connection site of diphenylamine derivative at C6/C7&#8208;position and the substituent at C3&#8208;position of coumarin moiety. The HLCT characteristics of pPh&#8208;7P, pPh&#8208;7M, and pPh&#8208;6M were systematically demonstrated through photophysical properties and density functional theory calculations. The solution&#8208;processed doped OLEDs based on pPh&#8208;6M exhibited deep&#8208;blue electroluminescence with the maximum emission wavelength of 446 nm, maximum luminance of 8755 cd m&#8208;2, maximum current efficiency of 5.83 cd A&#8208;1, and maximum external quantum efficiency of 6.54%. The results reveal that pPh&#8208;6M with dominant 1LE and 3CT components has better OLED performance.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced Low&#8208;Temperature Resistance of Lithium&#8208;metal Rechargeable Batteries Based on Electrolyte Including Ethyl Acetate and LiDFOB Additives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To meet the demand for higher energy density in lithium&#8208;ion batteries and expand their application range, coupling lithium metal anodes with high&#8208;voltage cathodes is an ideal solution. However, the compatibility between lithium metal batteries and electrolytes affects their applicability. In this study, proposes a locally concentrated electrolyte based on ethyl acetate (EA) as the solvent, lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) as the lithium salt, and lithium difluorooxoborate (LiDFOB) as a sacrificial agent to enhance the low&#8208;temperature and high&#8208;voltage endurance of Li//Lithium cobalt oxide (LCO) batteries. The Li//LCO battery can operate within the voltage range of 3 to 4.5 V, with an initial discharge specific capacity of 174.5 mAh g&#8208;1 at 20 oC. At &#8208;40 oC, after 200 cycles, the capacity retention rate is 87.7%. It can operate under extreme conditions of &#8208;70 oC, with a discharge specific capacity of 112.6 mAh g&#8208;1. Additionally, LCO//HC batteries using this electrolyte demonstrate excellent performance. Present work provides a new perspective for the optimization of electrolytes for low&#8208;temperature lithium&#8208;ion batteries.</dc:description>

         <title>Rationalization of a Streptavidin Based Enantioselective Artificial Suzukiase: An Integrative Computational Approach</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An Artificial Metalloenzyme (ArM) built employing the streptavidin&#8208;biotin technology has been used for the enantioselective synthesis of binaphthyls by means of asymmetric Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling reactions. Despite its success, it remains a challenge to understand how the length of the biotin cofactors or the introduction of mutations to streptavidin leads the preferential synthesis of one atropisomer over the other. In this study, we apply an integrated computational modeling approach, including DFT calculations, protein&#8208;ligand dockings and molecular dynamics to rationalize the impact of mutations and length of the biotion cofactor on the enantioselectivities of the biaryl product. The results unravel that the enantiomeric differences found experimentally can be rationalized by the disposition of the first intermediate, coming from the oxidative addition step, and the entrance of the second substrate. The work also showcases the difficulties facing to control the enantioselection when engineering ArM to catalyze enantioselective Suzuki&#8208;Miyaura couplings and how the combination of DFT calculations, molecular dockings and MD simulations can be used to rationalize artificial metalloenzymes.</dc:description>

         <title>Nature Products Chlorophyll Derivatives for NIR&#8208;II Fluorescence Bioimaging and Plant&#8208;imaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The second near&#8208;infrared window (NIR&#8208;II, 1000 &#8208; 1700 nm) fluorescence imaging has attracted significant attention in research fields because of its unique advantages compared with conventional optical windows (400 &#8211; 900 nm). A variety of NIR&#8208;II fluorophores have been actively studied because they serve as a key component of fluorescence imaging. Among them, organic small molecule NIR&#8208;II fluorophores display outstanding imaging performance and many advantages, but types of small molecule NIR&#8208;II fluorophores with high biocompatibility are still quite limited. Novel molecular scaffolds based NIR&#8208;II dyes are highly desired. Herein, we hypothesized that chlorophyll is a new promising molecular platform for discovery NIR&#8208;II fluorophores. Thus, seven derivatives of derivatives were selected to characterize their optical properties. Interestingly, six chlorophyll derivatives displayed NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging capability. This characteristic allowed the successful NIR&#8208;II imaging of green leaves of various plants. Furthermore, most of these fluorophores showed capacity to monitor viscosity change because of their sensitive for viscosity. For demonstration of its biomedical applications, these probes were successfully used for NIR&#8208;II fluorescence&#8208;guided surgical resection of lymph nodes. In summary, chlorophylls are novel valuable tool molecules for NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging and have potential to expand their applications in biomedical field and plant science.</dc:description>

         <title>Real&#8208;time LSPR&#8208;based study of metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) growth</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>MOFs are known for their absorption properties and widely used for accumulation, filtering, sensorics, photothermal, catalytical and other applications. Their combination with plasmonic metal nanoparticles leads to hybrid structures that profit from the stabilizing effect and high porosity of the MOF as well as the optical and electronic properties of the nanoparticles. The growth of MOFs on plasmonic nanoparticles can be monitored in&#8208;situ using LSPR spectroscopy, simultaneously applying microfluidic reaction conditions for the fabrication of NP@MOF structures. Here, a systematic study is conducted using LSPR spectroscopy for the monitoring of the Layer&#8208;by&#8208;Layer deposition of twelve different MOFs, determining the suitability of LSPR spectroscopy for this purpose. In addition to some well&#8208;investigated materials like HKUST&#8208;1, other MOFs such as MIL&#8208;53, MIL&#8208;88A and Cu&#8208;BDC are deposited successfully. For some MOFs such as Zn&#8208;Fum, the LSPR experiment indicates that no deposition had taken place. The results are confirmed with AFM, SEM and XPS measurements. This work shows that LSPR spectroscopy is suitable for the in&#8208;situ monitoring of LbL MOF growth and the microfluidic setup is a promising method for the controlled manufacturing of NP@MOF hybrid structures. Further studies may include optimization of the synthesis process or transfer to other materials.</dc:description>

This work shows that LSPR spectroscopy is suitable for the in-situ monitoring of LbL MOF growth and the microfluidic setup is a promising method for the controlled manufacturing of NP@MOF hybrid structures. Further studies may include optimization of the synthesis process or transfer to other materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
