         <title>Photolysis of an Archetypal Model Complex. Photooxidation Versus Photoreduction of Azido(porphinato)iron(III).</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Azidoporphinatoiron(III) ([1]) is an archetypal model complex for the photochemical generation of nitridoiron(V) complexes via cleavage of dinitrogen. So far, this process has only been studied with continuous irradiation in thin films under cryogenic conditions or in frozen solutions. In addition, the photooxidation from iron(III) to iron(V) competes with photoreduction to iron(II) via cleavage of an azidyl radical. The quantum yields of both pathways remained hitherto undisclosed. Here, we investigated the photolysis of this model complex in room temperature liquid solution using stationary and time&#8208;resolved infrared spectroscopy. The two reaction pathways are unambiguously identified in quenching studies and their quantum yields are accurately determined. Nitridoporphinatoiron(V) ([2]) exhibits N&#8208;atom&#8208;2&#8208;electron&#8208;transfer reactivity toward tert&#8208;butyl isonitrile and forms a carbodiimido species. In the presence of tert&#8208;butyl isonitrile, the two products of the photoreduction pathway react to cationic diisonitriloporphinatoiron(III) and azide anions, which in turn combine to reform [1] and the quencher.</dc:description>

         <title>Versatile Synthesis of Symmetric and Unsymmetric Imines via Photoelectrochemical Catalysis: Application to N&#8208;Terminal Modification of Phenylalanine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A strategy that combines electrochemical synthesis and photoredox catalysis was reported for the efficient synthesis of imines. This approach was demonstrated to be highly versatile in producing various types of imines, including symmetric and unsymmetric imines, by exploring the impact of different substituents on the benzene ring of the arylamine. Additionally, the method was specifically applied to modify N&#8208;terminal phenylalanine residues and was found to be successful in photoelectrochemical bioconjugation between NH2&#8208;Phe&#8208;OMe and aryl methylamines, leading to the synthesis of phenylalanine&#8208;containing imines. Therefore, this technique would present a convenient and efficient platform for synthesizing imines, with promising applications in chemical biology, drug development, and organic synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>A Membrane&#8208;Free Decoupled Water Electrolyzer Operating at Simulated Fluctuating Renewables with Tri&#8208;functional NiCo&#8208;P Electrode</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Water electrolysis has been considered a promising technology for the conversion of renewables to hydrogen. However, preventing mixing of products (H2 and O2) and exploring cost&#8208;efficient electrolysis components remains challenging for conventional water electrolyzers. Herein, we design a membrane&#8208;free decoupled water electrolysis system using graphite felt supported nickel&#8208;cobalt phosphate (GF@NixCoy&#8208;P) material as a tri&#8208;functional (redox mediator, hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER)) electrode. The versatile GF@Ni1Co1&#8208;P electrode obtained by one&#8208;step electrodeposition not only exhibits high specific capacity (176 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.5 A g&#8208;1) and long cycle life (80% capacity retention after 3000 cycles) as a redox mediator, but also has relatively outstanding catalytic activities for HER and OER. The excellent properties of the GF@NixCoy&#8208;P electrode endow this decoupled system with more flexibility for H2 production by fluctuating renewable energies. This work provides guidance for multifunctional applications of transition metal compounds between energy storage and electrocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Gas permeation through mechanically resistant self&#8208;standing membranes of a neat amorphous organic cage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis and characterization of a novel film&#8208;forming organic cage and of its smaller analogue are here described. While the small cage produced single crystals suitable for X&#8208;ray diffraction studies, the large one was isolated as a dense film. Due to its remarkable film&#8208;forming properties, this latter cage could be solution&#8208;processed into transparent thin&#8208;layer films and mechanically stable dense self&#8208;standing membranes of controllable thickness. Thanks to these peculiar features, the membranes were also successfully tested for gas permeation, reporting a behavior similar to that found with stiff glassy polymers such as polymers of intrinsic microporosity or polyimides. Considering the growing interest in the development of molecular&#8208;based membranes, e.g. for separation technologies and functional coatings, the properties of this organic cage were investigated by thorough analysis of their structural, thermal, mechanical and gas transport properties, and by detailed atomistic simulations.</dc:description>

         <title>Organocatalyzed Regioselective Synthesis of 1,5&#8208;Disubstituted 1,2,3&#8208;Triazolyl Glycoconjugates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel organocatalyzed [3+2] cycloaddition reaction of nitroolefins with glycosyl azides as well as organic azides has been developed for successful construction of 1,5&#8208;disubstituted triazolyl glycoconjugates. This metal&#8208;free and acid&#8208;free, regioselective synthetic protocol proceeds in the presence of only Schreiner thiourea organocatalysts, which enable the required activation of nitroolefins through double hydrogen bonding. The straightforward, operationally simple, and regioselectivity of this methodology, complementing to the classical RuAAC catalyzed synthesis of 1,5&#8208;disubstituted 1,2,3&#8208;triazoles. In the presence of catalytic amount of Schreiner thiourea, organic azides react with a broad array of nitroolefins producing a series of 1,5&#8208;disubstituted 1,2,3&#8208; triazoles in good yields.</dc:description>

         <title>Robust Biosensor Based on Carbon Nanotubes/Protein Hybrid Electrolyte Gated Transistors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Semiconducting single walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) are promising materials for biosensing applications with electrolyte&#8208;gated transistors (EGT). However, to be employed in EGT devices, SWCNTs often require lengthy solution&#8208;processing fabrication techniques. Here, we introduce a simple solution&#8208;based method that allows fabricating EGT devices from stable dispersions of SWCNTs/bovine serum albumin (BSA) hybrids in water. The dispersion is then deposited on a substrate allowing the formation of a SWCNTs random network as the semiconducting channel. We demonstrate that this methodology allows the fabrication of EGT devices with electric performances that allow their use in biosensing applications. We demonstrate their application for the detection of cortisol in solution, upon gate electrode functionalization with anti&#8208;cortisol antibodies. This is a robust and cost&#8208;effective methodology that sets the ground for a SWCNT/BSA&#8208;based biosensing platform that allows overcoming many limitations of standard SWCNTs biosensor fabrications.</dc:description>

         <title>A Rising Star: Luminescent Carbene&#8208;Metal&#8208;Amide Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Coinage metal (gold, silver, and copper) complexes are attractive candidates to substitute the widely studied noble metal complexes such as iridium(III) and platinum(II) as luminescent materials in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). However, the development of coinage metal complexes exhibiting high emission quantum yields and short exciton lifetimes is still a formidable challenge. In the past few years, coinage metal complexes featuring a carbene&#8208;metal&#8208;amide (CMA) motif have emerged as a new class of luminescent materials in OLEDs. Thanks to the coinage metal&#8208;bridged linear geometry, coplanar conformation, and the formation of excited states with dominant ligand&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer character and reduced metal d&#8208;orbital participation, most CMA complexes have high radiative rates via thermally activated delayed fluorescence. Currently, the family of CMA complexes have rapidly evolved and remarkable progresses in CMA&#8208;based OLEDs have been made. Here, a concept review of CMA complexes is presented, with a focus on molecular design principles, the correlation between molecular structure/conformation and optoelectronic properties, as well as OLED performance. The future prospects of CMA complexes are also discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct amination of benzene with ammonia by flow plasma chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Amine derivatives, including aniline and allylic amines, can be formed in a single&#8208;step process from benzene and an ammonia plasma in a micro&#8208;reactor. Different process parameters such as temperature, residence time, and plasma power were evaluated to improve the reaction yield and its selectivity toward aminated products and avoid hydrogenated or oligomerized products. In parallel, simulation studies of the process have been carried out to propose a global mechanism and gain a better understanding of the influence of the different process parameters. The exploration of diverse related alkenes showed that the double bonds, conjugation, and aromatization influenced the amination mechanism. Benzene was the best reactant for amination based on the lifetime of radical intermediates. Under optimized conditions, benzene was aminated in the absence of catalyst with a yield of 3.8% and a selectivity of 49% in various amino compounds,</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Nitric Oxide Scavenging by Urea&#8208;Functionalized Push&#8208;Pull Chromophore Modulates NO&#8208;Mediated Diseases</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The excess nitric oxide (NO) produced in the body in response to bacterial/proinflammatory stimuli is responsible for several pathological conditions. The current approaches that target the production of excess NO, either through the inhibition of nitric oxide synthase enzyme or its downstream mediators have been clinically unsuccessful. With an aim to regulate the excess NO, we developed urea&#8208;functionalized push&#8208;pull chromophores containing 1,1,4,4&#8208;tetracyanobuta&#8208;1,3&#8208;dienes (TCBD) or expanded TCBD (eTCBD) as NO scavengers. The NMR mechanistic studies revealed that upon NO binding, these molecules are converted to uncommon stable NONOates. The unique emissive property of Urea&#8208;eTCBD enables its application in vitro, as aNO&#8208;sensor. Furthermore, the cytocompatible Urea&#8208;eTCBD, rapidly inactivated the NO released from LPS&#8208;activated cells. The therapeutic efficacy of the molecule in modulating NO&#8208;mediated pathological condition was confirmed using a carrageenan&#8208;induced inflammatory paw model and a corneal injury model. While the results confirm the advantages of scavenging the excess NO to address a multitude of NO&#8208;mediated diseases, the promising sensing and bioactivity of Urea&#8208;eTCBD can motivate further exploration of such molecules in allied areas of research.</dc:description>

         <title>Sequential Water Sorption/Desorption of a Nonporous Adaptive Organic Ligand Bridged Coordination Polymer for Atmospheric Moisture Harvesting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Moisture harvesters with favourable attributes such as easy synthetic availability and good processability as alternatives for atmospheric moisture harvesting (AWH) are desirable. We report here a novel nonporous anionic coordination polymer (CP) of uranyl squarate with methyl viologen (MV2+) as charge balancing ions (named U&#8208;Squ&#8208;CP) which displays intriguing sequential water sorption/desorption behavior as the relative humidity (RH) changes gradually. The evaluation of AWH performance of U&#8208;Squ&#8208;CP shows that it can absorb water vapor under air atmosphere at a low RH of 20% typical of the levels found in most dry regions of the world, and have good cycling durability, thus demonstrating the capability as a potential moisture harvester for AWH. To our knowledge, this is the first report on non&#8208;porous organic ligand bridged CP materials for AWH. Moreover, a stepwise water&#8208;filling mechanism for the water sorption/desorption process is deciphered by comprehensive characterizations combining single&#8208;crystal diffraction, which provides a reasonable explanation for the special moisture harvesting behaviour of this non&#8208;porous crystalline material.</dc:description>

         <title>Panchromatic Light Capturing Bis&#8208;Styryl BODIPY&#8208;Perylenediimide Donor&#8208;Acceptor Constructs: Occurrence of Sequential Energy Transfer Followed by Electron Transfer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two wide&#8208;band capturing donor&#8208;acceptor conjugates featuring bisstrylBODIPY and perylenediimide (PDI) have been newly synthesized and the occurrence of ultrafast excitation transfer from the 1PDI* to BODIPY, and a subsequent electron transfer from the 1BODIPY* to PDI has been demonstrated. Steady&#8208;state fluorescence and excitation spectral recordings provided evidence of singlet&#8208;singlet energy transfer in these dyads, and quenched fluorescence of bisstyrylBODIPY emission in the dyads suggested additional photo&#8208;events. The electrostatic potential surfaces of the S1 and S2 states, derived from time&#8208;dependent DFT calculations, supported excited charge transfer in these dyads. Spectroelectrochemical studies on one&#8208;electron oxidized and one&#8208;electron reduced dyads and the monomeric precursor compounds were also performed in a thin&#8208;layer optical cell under corresponding applied potentials. From this study, both bisstrylBODIPY.+ and PDI.&#8208; were possible to spectrally characterize and were subsequently utilized in characterizing the electron transfer products. Finally, pump&#8208;probe spectral studies were performed in dichlorobenzene under selective PDI and bisstyrylBODIPY excitation to secure energy and electron transfer evidence. The measured rate constants for energy transfer, kENT were in the range of 1011 s&#8208;1 while the electron transfer rate constants, kET were in the range of 1010 s&#8208;1 highlighting their potential use in solar energy harvesting and optoelectronic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Antimalarial Agents Derived from Metal&#8208;Amodiaquine Complexes with Activity in Multiple Stages of the Plasmodium Life Cycle&#8224;</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Quinolines are excellent ligands for metal coordination and are deployed as drugs for malaria treatment. There is a growing body of evidence indicating that metal complexes can be conjugated with antimalarial quinolines to be used as chemical tools to overcome the disadvantages of quinolines, improving their bioactive speciation, cellular distribution, and subsequently broadening the spectrum of activity to multiple stages of the complex Plasmodium life cycle. In this study, four novel complexes of ruthenium(II) and gold(I) containing amodiaquine (AQ) were synthesized and a careful chemical characterization revealed the precise coordination site of AQ to the metals. Their speciation in solution was investigated, demonstrating the stability of the quinoline&#8208;metal bond. Ru(II)&#8208; and Au(I)&#8208;AQ complexes were demonstrated to be potent and efficacious in inhibiting parasite growth in multiple stages of the Plasmodium life cycle assayed in vitro and in vivo. These properties could be attributed to the ability of the metal&#8208;AQ complexes to reproduce the suppression of heme detoxification induced by AQ, while also inhibiting other processes in the parasite life cycle, which can be attributed to the action of the metallic species. These findings indicate that metal coordination is a potential chemical tool for drug design and discovery in malaria.</dc:description>

These findings indicate that metal coordination is a potential chemical tool for drug design and discovery in malaria.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Diiminium Nucleophile Adducts are Stable and Convenient Strong Lewis Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Strong Lewis acids are essential tools for a manifold of chemical procedures, but their scalable deployment is limited by their costs and safety concerns. We report a scalable, convenient, and inexpensive synthesis of stable diiminium&#8208;based reagents with a Lewis acidic carbon centre. Coordination with pyridine donors stabilises these centres; the 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine adduct shows a chelation effect at carbon. Due to high fluoride, hydride, and oxide affinities, the diiminium pyridine adducts are promising soft and hard Lewis acids. They effectively produce acylpyridinium salts from carboxylates which can&#160;acylate amines to give amides and imides even from electronically intractable coupling partners.</dc:description>

         <title>Three oxidative addition routes of&#160;alkali metal aluminyls to dihydroaluminates and reactivity with CO2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Three distinct routes are reported to the soluble, dihydridoaluminate compounds, AM[Al(NONDipp)(H)2] (AM = Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs; [NONDipp]2&#8211; = [O(SiMe2NDipp)2]2&#8211;; Dipp = 2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3) starting from the alkali metal aluminyls, AM[Al(NONDipp)]. Direct H2 hydrogenation of the heavier analogues (AM = Rb, Cs) produced the first examples of structurally characterized rubidium and caesium dihydridoaluminates, although harsh conditions were required for complete conversion. Using 1,4&#8208;cyclohexadiene (1,4&#8208;CHD) as an alternative hydrogen source in transfer hydrogenation reactions provided a lower energy pathway to the full series of products for AM = Li &#8211; Cs. A further moderation in conditions was noted for the thermal decomposition of the (silyl)(hydrido)aluminates, AM[Al(NONDipp)(H)(SiH2Ph)]. Probing the reaction of Cs[Al(NONDipp)] with 1,4&#8208;CHD provided access to a novel inverse sandwich complex, [{Cs(Et2O)}2{Al(NONDipp)(H)}2(C6H6)], containing the 1,4&#8208;dialuminated [C6H6]2&#8211; dianion and representing the first time that an intermediate in the commonly utilized oxidation process of 1,4&#8208;CHD to benzene has been trapped. The synthetic utility of the newly installed Al&#8211;H bonds has been demonstrated by their ability to reduce CO2 under mild conditions to form the bis&#8208;formate AM[Al(NONDipp)(O2CH)2] compounds, which exhibit a diverse series of eyecatching bimetallacyclic structures.</dc:description>

         <title>Revisiting sp2 Dilithio Methandiides: From Geometric Curiosity to Simple Bonding Description</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reported tetracoordinate dilithio methandiide complex from Liddle and co&#8208;workers (1) is investigated from a coordination chemistry perspective, to probe the origin of its intriguing geometry. Through the application of a variety of computational techniques, non&#8208;covalent (steric, electrostatic) interactions are found to be dominant. Further, we arrive at a bonding description which emphasizes the tricoordinate sp2&#8208;hybridized nature of the central methandiide carbon, differing somewhat from the original proposal. Thus, 1 is distinct from other dilithio methandiides since it contains only one C&#8208;Li &#963;&#8208;bond, and is found to be comparable to a simple aryllithium compound, phenyllithium.</dc:description>

         <title>Sheltering Mono&#8208;P&#8208;Ligated Metal Complexes in Porous Polystyrene Monolith: Effect of Aryl Pendant Stabilizers on Catalytic Durability</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal centers that can generate coordinatively unsaturated metals in accessible and stable states have been developed using synthetic polymers with sophisticated ligand and scaffold designs, which required synthetic efforts. Herein, we report a simple and direct strategy for producing polymer&#8208;supported phosphine&#8208;metal complexes, which stabilizes mono&#8208;P&#8208;ligated metals by modulating the electronic properties of the aryl pendant groups in the polymer platform. A three&#8208;fold vinylated PPh3 was copolymerized with a styrene derivative and a cross&#8208;linker to produce a porous polystyrene&#8208;phosphine hybrid monolith. Based on the Hammett substituent constants, the electronic properties of styrene derivatives were modulated and incorporated into the polystyrene backbone to stabilize the mono&#8208;P&#8208;ligated Pd complex via Pd&#8208;arene interactions. Through NMR, TEM, and comparative catalytic studies, the polystyrene&#8208;phosphine hybrid, which induces selective mono&#8208;P&#8208;ligation and moderate Pd&#8208;arene interactions, demonstrated high catalytic durability for the cross&#8208;coupling of chloroarenes under continuous&#8208;flow conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Naphthalene Embedded Multi&#8208;Resonance Emitters Enabling Efficient Narrow Emissive Blue OLEDs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Achieving high color purity for blue emitters remains a challenge in organic light emitting diodes. In this study, we have designed and synthesized three naphthalene (NA) embedded multi&#8208;resonance (MR) emitters, named SNA, SNB and SNB1, based on N&#8208;B&#8208;O frameworks with isomer variations for finely adjusting the photophysical properties. These emitters show tunable blue emission with emission peaks of 450&#8208;470 nm. Small full width of half maximum&#160;of 25&#8208;29 nm are achieved in these emitters, indicating the well maintaining of molecular rigidity and MR effect with NA extension. Such design also ensures a fast radiative decay. No obvious delayed fluorescence is observed in all three emitters due to the relatively large energy differences between the first singlet and triplet excited states. Both SNA and SNB enable high electroluminescent (EL) performance in doped devices with external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 7.2% and 7.9%, respectively. When applying the sensitized strategy, devices based on SNA and SNB show huge improvement with EQE of 29.3% and 29.1%.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Achieving high color purity for blue emitters remains a challenge in organic light emitting diodes. In this study, we have designed and synthesized three naphthalene (NA) embedded multi-resonance (MR) emitters, named SNA, SNB and SNB1, based on N-B-O frameworks with isomer variations for finely adjusting the photophysical properties. These emitters show tunable blue emission with emission peaks of 450-470 nm. Small full width of half maximum&#160;of 25-29 nm are achieved in these emitters, indicating the well maintaining of molecular rigidity and MR effect with NA extension. Such design also ensures a fast radiative decay. No obvious delayed fluorescence is observed in all three emitters due to the relatively large energy differences between the first singlet and triplet excited states. Both SNA and SNB enable high electroluminescent (EL) performance in doped devices with external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 7.2% and 7.9%, respectively. When applying the sensitized strategy, devices based on SNA and SNB show huge improvement with EQE of 29.3% and 29.1%. More importantly, SNB with twist geometry enables stable EL spectra with almost unchanged FWHM under different doping concentrations. This work demonstrates the potential of NA extension design in constructing narrowband emissive blue emitters.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Predictive Model for the Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Site&#8208;Selective Oxidation of Diols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Site&#8208;selectivity in the palladium&#8208;catalyzed mono&#8208;oxidation of diols can be predicted by a model, supported by experiments and computation. It explains the selective oxidation of hydroxy groups in cis&#8208;diols and the dependency of the rate on the configuration and conformational freedom. The model predicts whether a natural product comprising multiple hydroxy groups is suited for site&#8208;selective palladium&#8208;catalyzed oxidation.







Abstract
A predictive model, shaped as a set of rules, is presented that predicts site&#8208;selectivity in the mono&#8208;oxidation of diols by palladium&#8208;neocuproine catalysis. For this, the factors that govern this site&#8208;selectivity within diols and between different diols have been studied both experimentally and with computation. It is shown that an electronegative substituent antiperiplanar to the C&#8722;H bond retards hydride abstraction, resulting in a lower reactivity. This explains the selective oxidation of axial hydroxy groups in vicinal cis&#8208;diols. Furthermore, DFT calculations and competition experiments show how the reaction rate of different diols is determined by their configuration and conformational freedom. The model has been validated by the oxidation of several complex natural products, including two steroids. From a synthesis perspective, the model predicts whether a natural product comprising multiple hydroxy groups is a suitable substrate for site&#8208;selective palladium&#8208;catalyzed oxidation.

         <title>Photocatalytic Cross&#8208;Pinacol Coupling Promoted by Carbon Dioxide
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A first photocatalytic cross&#8208;pinacol coupling was achieved. The reaction proceeded with a various combination of two aldehydes, two ketones, or an aldehyde and a ketone to afford the corresponding unsymmetric vicinal 1,2&#8208;diols in up to 91&#8201;% yield. In this process, an umpoled anionic carbinol synthon was generated in&#8197;situ, by the assistance of CO2 additive, to react nucleophilically with a second electrophilic carbonyl compound.Photocatalytic Cross&#8208;Pinacol Coupling Promoted by Carbon Dioxide (S. Okumura, Y. Uozumi et al.)







Abstract
Cross&#8208;pinacol coupling of two different carbonyl compounds was achieved through successive one&#8208;electron transfer processes under photocatalytic conditions. In the reaction, an umpoled anionic carbinol synthon was generated in&#8197;situ to react nucleophilically with a second electrophilic carbonyl compound. It was revealed that a CO2 additive promoted the photocatalytic generation of the carbinol synthon to suppress undesired radical dimerization. A wide variety of aromatic and aliphatic carbonyl substrates underwent the cross&#8208;pinacol coupling to afford the corresponding unsymmetric vicinal 1,2&#8208;diols, in which even a combination of carbonyl reactants with similar structures such as two aldehydes and two ketones were also well tolerated with high cross&#8208;coupling selectivity.

         <title>A Novel Approach to &#945;&#8208;Arylacetonitrile Skeletons via para&#8208;Selective Alkylation of Protected Anilines</title>

         <dc:description>
Herein, we report a ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed para&#8208;selective alkylation reaction with ethyl 2&#8208;bromo&#8208;2&#8208;cyanopropanoate as the novel alkylating reagent to directly form an &#945;&#8208;arylacetonitrile skeleton with quaternary carbon center. Various protected anilines were tolerated, yielding the corresponding products in moderate to good yields.







Abstract
A ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed para&#8208;selective alkylation of protected anilines to construct &#945;&#8208;arylacetonitrile skeletons has been reported. We firstly disclosed the ethyl 2&#8208;bromo&#8208;2&#8208;cyanopropanoate was an effective alkylating reagent in ruthenmuim&#8208;catalyzed remote&#8208;selective C&#8722;H functionalization. A wide variety of &#945;&#8208;arylacetonitrile skeletons can be directly obtained with moderate to good yields. Importantly, the products contain both nitrile and ester groups guaranteeing its direct transformation into other useful synthetic units, indicating the synthetic importance of this method.

         <dc:description>
The redox active bimetallic dithiolene complex Cp2Mo(btt)MoCp2 (Mo2B) exhibits four successive electron transfers up to the tetracation. The isolated dication [Cp2Mo(btt)MoCp2]2+, with either chair or boat conformations associated with folded MoS2C2 metallacycles, exhibits a diradical character and strong antiferromagnetic coupling.







Abstract
Benzene&#8208;1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrathiolate (btt) has been used as a bridging ligand to prepare a redox active (molybdenocene dithiolene)&#8208;based bimetallic complex Cp2Mo(btt)MoCp2, which exhibits four successive electron transfers up to the tetracation. Spectro&#8208;electrochemical investigations together with DFT and TD&#8208;DFT calculations evidence that the two electroactive MoS2C2 metallacycles are electronically coupled in the monocationic as in the dicationic state. Two salts of the dication [Cp2Mo(btt)MoCp2]2+ have been structurally characterized with PF6&#8722; and HSO4&#8722; counterions, showing different chair or boat conformations associated with variable folding angles of the two MoS2C2 metallacycles along the S&#8722;S hinge. The bis&#8208;oxidized dicationic complex exhibits a diradical character, with both radicals essentially localized on the metallacycles and with antiferromagnetic coupling evidenced from magnetic susceptibility measurements.

         <dc:description>We present the synthesis of a new type of an expanded porphyrinoid macrocycle with a saddle&#8208;shaped morphology and its complexation of C60 guest molecules. The new macrocycle contains four carbazole and four triazole moieties and can be readily synthesized via a copper&#8208;catalyzed click reaction. It shows specific photo&#8208;physical properties including fluorescence with a high quantum yield of 60%. The combination of the saddle&#8208;shaped geometry with the expanded &#960;&#8208;system allows for host&#8208;guest interactions with C60 in a stacked polymer fashion. Evidence for the presence of a host&#8208;guest complex is provided both in solution by NMR spectroscopy and in the solid state by X&#8208;ray structure analysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct C7&#8208;H Arylation of Pyrazolo[1,5&#8208;a]azines with Aryl Chlorides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new protocol for the palladium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H arylation of pyrazolo[1,5&#8208;a]azines, using low&#8208;cost and abundant (hetero)aryl chlorides as the coupling partners, and without any stoichiometric metal additives is reported. The structural motif of coupling products can be found in many drugs and organic materials.







Abstract
C7&#8208;Arylated pyrazolo[1,5&#8208;a]azines are important structural motifs with profound applications in drug and material research. Here, we report a general and straighforward synthesis of these bi(hetero)aryls via palladium&#8208;catalyzed direct C&#8722;H arylation, employing low&#8208;cost and abundant (hetero)aryl chlorides as the aryl source. The catalytic system is robust and covers a wide substrate scope regarding heteroarenes as well as (hetero)aryl chlorides, with possible extension to the C&#8722;H arylation of [1,2,4]triazolo[1,5&#8208;a]pyrimidines. This study also presents a rare example of using (hetero)aryl chlorides for the direct C&#8722;H arylation of six&#8208;membered heteroarenes.

         <title>Controlling Swing Rates in Macrocyclic Molecular Mortise Hinges</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Variable temperature NMR shows that hinge rates can be controlled with steric congestion leading to a &#916;G&#8800; of 13.3 or 16.3&#8197;kcal/mol depending on constituent. These values are largely independent of solvent.







Abstract
Hinge motion is observed in macrocyclic, mortise&#8208;type molecular hinges using variable temperature NMR spectroscopy. The data is consistent with dynamic hinging from a folded&#8208;to&#8208;extended&#8208;to&#8208;folded enantiomeric state. Crystallographic and solution structures of the folded states are reported. Chemical shift predictions derived from crystallographic data corroborate fully revolute hinge motion. The rate of hinging is affected by steric congestion at the hinge axis. A macrocycle containing glycine, 1, hinges faster than one comprising aminoisobutyric acid, 2. The free energies of activation, &#916;G&#8800;, for 1 and 2 were determined to be 13.3&#177;0.3&#8197;kcal/mol and 16.3&#177;0.3&#8197;kcal/mol, respectively. This barrier is largely independent of solvent across those surveyed (CD3OD, CD3CN, DMSO&#8208;d6, pyridine&#8208;d5, D2O). Experiment and computation predict energy barriers that are consistent with disruption of an intramolecular network of hydrogen bonds. DFT calculations reveal a pathway for hinge motion.

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Directed H2S Probe and Scavenger for Specific Tumor Imaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sulfide scavenger: Molecular engineering of ligand&#8208;directed H2S&#8208;responsive tools yields a near&#8208;infrared fluorescent probe and a scavenger for specifically imaging and downregulating the intratumoral H2S levels in live mice; this could potentially help to investigate H2S cancer biology and with related therapies.







Abstract
An expanding body of evidence suggests that specifically targeting hydrogen sulfide (H2S) might potentially benefit both tumor diagnosis and treatment, but there is still a lack of cancer&#8208;targeted molecular tools for in&#8197;vivo applications. Here, we report the first ligand&#8208;directed H2S&#8208;specific near&#8208;infrared fluorescent sensor PSMA&#8208;Cy7&#8208;NBD and scavenger PSMA&#8208;Py&#8208;NBD that target the prostate&#8208;specific membrane antigen (PSMA). PSMA&#8208;Cy7&#8208;NBD displays a 53&#8208;fold off&#8211;on fluorescence response to H2S at 803&#8197;nm with high specificity. PSMA&#8208;Py&#8208;NBD can scavenge H2S fast (k2=30.8&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 at 25&#8201;&#176;C) without interference from biothiols. Both tools are highly water&#8208;soluble and can be transported selectively into PSMA&#8208;expressing prostate cancer cells. Endogenous H2S levels in murine 22Rv1 tumor models can be imaged and downregulated by intravenous injection of PSMA&#8208;Cy7&#8208;NBD and PSMA&#8208;Py&#8208;NBD, respectively. These tools could potentially help to investigate H2S cancer biology and with related therapies.

         <title>Potent and Selective Cell&#8208;Active Iminosugar Inhibitors of Human &#945;&#8208;N&#8208;Acetylgalactosaminidase (&#945;&#8208;NAGAL)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rapid synthesis of azasugars from achiral materials delivered a potent inhibitor of human N&#8208;acetylglucosaminidase (NAGAL). Guanidine derivative, DGJNGuan, shows nanomolar inhibitory activity and high selectivity in&#8197;vitro. DGJNGuan is active in cells, elevating NAGAL substrate levels in an image&#8208;based assay and shows high selectivity.







Abstract
Glycoside hydrolases (GHs) are a class of enzymes with emerging roles in a range of disease. Selective GH inhibitors are sought to better understand their functions and assess the therapeutic potential of modulating their activities. Iminosugars are a promising class of GH inhibitors but typically lack the selectivity required to accurately perturb biological systems. Here, we describe a concise synthesis of iminosugar inhibitors of N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;galactosaminidase (&#945;&#8208;NAGAL), the GH responsible for cleaving terminal &#945;&#8208;N&#8208;acetylgalactosamine residues from glycoproteins and other glycoconjugates. Starting from non&#8208;carbohydrate precursors, this modular synthesis supported the identification of a potent (490&#8197;nM) and &#945;&#8208;NAGAL selective (&#8764;200&#8208;fold) guanidino&#8208;containing derivative DGJNGuan. To illustrate the cellular activity of this new inhibitor, we developed a quantitative fluorescence image&#8208;based method to measure levels of the Tn&#8208;antigen, a cellular glycoprotein substrate of &#945;&#8208;NAGAL. Using this assay, we show that DGJNGuan exhibits excellent inhibition of &#945;&#8208;NAGAL within cells using patient derived fibroblasts (EC50=150&#8197;nM). Moreover, in&#8197;vitro and in cell assays to assess levels of lysosomal &#946;&#8208;hexosaminidase substrate ganglioside GM2 show that DGJNGuan is selective whereas DGJNAc exhibits off&#8208;target inhibition both in&#8197;vitro and within cells. DGJNGuan is a readily produced and selective tool compound that should prove useful for investigating the physiological roles of &#945;&#8208;NAGAL.

         <title>Xanthene&#8208;Separated 24 &#960;&#8208;Electron Antiaromatic Rosarin Dimer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A co&#8208;facially linked rosarin dimer containing two antiaromatic monomeric macrocyclic units. Low temperature spectroscopic measurements and quantum mechanical calculations provide support for the conclusion that relative to the monomeric constituents the degree of antiaromaticity is reduced in the dimer.







Abstract
Antiaromatic molecules have recently received attention because of their intrinsic properties, such as high reactivity and their narrow HOMO&#8211;LUMO gaps. Stacking of antiaromatic molecules has been predicted to induce three&#8208;dimensional aromaticity via frontier orbital interactions. Here, we report a covalently linked &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacked rosarin dimer that has been examined experimentally by steady&#8208;state absorption and transient absorption measurements and theoretically by quantum chemical calculations, including time&#8208;dependent density functional theory, anisotropy of induced current density, and nucleus&#8208;independent chemical shift calculations. Relative to the corresponding monomer, the dimer exhibits diminished antiaromaticity upon lowering the temperature to 77&#8197;K, a finding ascribed to intramolecular interactions between the macrocyclic rosarin subunits.

     alt="Xanthene-Separated 24 &#960;-Electron Antiaromatic Rosarin Dimer"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A co-facially linked rosarin dimer containing two antiaromatic monomeric macrocyclic units. Low temperature spectroscopic measurements and quantum mechanical calculations provide support for the conclusion that relative to the monomeric constituents the degree of antiaromaticity is reduced in the dimer.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antiaromatic molecules have recently received attention because of their intrinsic properties, such as high reactivity and their narrow HOMO&#8211;LUMO gaps. Stacking of antiaromatic molecules has been predicted to induce three-dimensional aromaticity via frontier orbital interactions. Here, we report a covalently linked &#960;-&#960; stacked rosarin dimer that has been examined experimentally by steady-state absorption and transient absorption measurements and theoretically by quantum chemical calculations, including time-dependent density functional theory, anisotropy of induced current density, and nucleus-independent chemical shift calculations. Relative to the corresponding monomer, the dimer exhibits diminished antiaromaticity upon lowering the temperature to 77&#8197;K, a finding ascribed to intramolecular interactions between the macrocyclic rosarin subunits.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Natural Light&#8208;Regulated Switchable Self&#8208;Adhesive Supramolecular Films for Smart Windows</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The self&#8208;adhesive supramolecular films, which show tough and long&#8208;term stable adhesion to commercially available organic and inorganic glass, are used to construct smart windows. Reversible and rapid transformations in the color and transmittance of smart windows are fully achieved by natural light irradiation in different weather conditions, including sun, rain, and clouds.







Abstract
Switchable self&#8208;adhesive films are promising coating materials for constructing smart windows. Compared to commonly used hydrogels, self&#8208;adhesive supramolecular films have a variety of advantages and serve as a universal carrier of stimuli&#8208;responsiveness. In this study, supramolecular adhesive material is processed into self&#8208;adhesive films, which display tough and long&#8208;term stable adhesion to commercially available organic/inorganic glass windows. Spiropyrans are used as the photo&#8208;responsive units to endow smart windows with switchable optical behavior. Reverse photochromism is successfully realized by the combination of supramolecular films and spiropyrans. Reversible and rapid transformations in the color and transmittance of smart windows are fully achieved by natural light irradiation in different weather conditions, including sun, rain, and clouds.

         <title>Stability and Reversible Oxidation of Sub&#8208;Nanometric Cu5 Metal Clusters: Integrated Experimental Study and Theoretical Modeling
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A combined XANES and NAP XPS study shows that Cu5 clusters are resistant to irreversible oxidation up to 773&#8197;K in the presence of oxygen. A theoretical model reveals that adsorbed O2 molecules are transformed into superoxo and peroxo species by an interplay of collective charge transfer and large amplitude &#8220;breathing&#8221; motions. A chemical phase diagram for Cu oxidation state of the Cu5&#8208;O2 system is presented.







Abstract
Sub&#8208;nanometer metal clusters have special physical and chemical properties, significantly different from those of nanoparticles. However, there is a major concern about their thermal stability and susceptibility to oxidation. In situ X&#8208;ray Absorption spectroscopy and Near Ambient Pressure X&#8208;ray Photoelectron spectroscopy results reveal that supported Cu5 clusters are resistant to irreversible oxidation at least up to 773&#8197;K, even in the presence of 0.15&#8197;mbar of oxygen. These experimental findings can be formally described by a theoretical model which combines dispersion&#8208;corrected DFT and first principles thermochemistry revealing that most of the adsorbed O2 molecules are transformed into superoxo and peroxo species by an interplay of collective charge transfer within the network of Cu atoms and large amplitude &#8220;breathing&#8221; motions. A chemical phase diagram for Cu oxidation states of the Cu5&#8208;oxygen system is presented, clearly different from the already known bulk and nano&#8208;structured chemistry of Cu.

         <title>Insight into the Structural Ambiguity of Actinide(IV) Oxalate Sheet Structures: A Case for Alternate Coordination Geometries
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Isolation of the first crystal structures of Pu(C2O4)2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;6&#8201;H2O and Th(C2O4)2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;6&#8201;H2O has resulted in the identification of a previously unreported change in oxalate coordination and the presence of two coordinated water molecules. This structure was determined to persist across the actinide(IV) series: Th, U, Np, and Pu.







Abstract
Plutonium(IV) oxalate hexahydrate (Pu(C2O4)2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;6&#8201;H2O; PuOx) is an important intermediate in the recovery of plutonium from used nuclear fuel. Its formation by precipitation is well studied, yet its crystal structure remains unknown. Instead, the crystal structure of PuOx is assumed to be isostructural with neptunium(IV) oxalate hexahydrate (Np(C2O4)2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;6&#8201;H2O; NpOx) and uranium(IV) oxalate hexahydrate (U(C2O4)2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;6&#8201;H2O; UOx) despite the high degree of unresolved disorder that exists when determining water positions in the crystal structures of the latter two compounds. Such assumptions regarding the isostructural behavior of the actinide elements have been used to predict the structure of PuOx for use in a wide range of studies. Herein, we report the first crystal structures for PuOx and Th(C2O4)2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;6&#8201;H2O (ThOx). These data, along with new characterization of UOx and NpOx, have resulted in the full determination of the structures and resolution of the disorder around the water molecules. Specifically, we have identified the coordination of two water molecules with each metal center, which necessitates a change in oxalate coordination mode from axial to equatorial that has not been reported in the literature. The results of this work exemplify the need to revisit previous assumptions regarding fundamental actinide chemistry, which are heavily relied upon within the current nuclear field.

         <title>Superhydrophilic and superaerophobic Ru&#8208;loaded NiCo bimetallic hydroxide achieves efficient hydrogen evolution over all pH ranges</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Realizing an effective, binder&#8208;free, and super&#8208;wetting electrocatalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at full pH is essential for the creation of clean hydrogen. In this study, the Ru&#8208;loaded NiCo bimetallic hydroxide (Ru@NiCo&#8208;BH) catalyst was prepared by spontaneous redox reaction. The chemical interaction between Ru NPs and NiCo&#8208;BH by the Ru&#8208;O&#8208;M (M=Ni, Co) interface bond, the electron&#8208;rich Ru active site, and the multi&#8208;channel nickel foam carrier make the superhydrophilic and superaerophobic surface advantageous for mass transfer in the HER process. Therefore, Ru@NiCo&#8208;BH has remarkable HER activity, with low overpotential of 29, 68&#160;and 80 mV, and 10 mA cm&#8208;2 current density can be obtained in alkaline, neutral and acidic electrolytes respectively. This work provides a reference for the rational development of universal electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution in the all pH ranges through simple design strategies.</dc:description>

         <title>Investigations of the Photothermal Properties of a Series of Molecular Gold&#8208;bis(dithiolene) Complexes Absorbing in the NIR&#8208;III Region</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The photothermal properties of a series of neutral radical gold&#8208;bis(dithiolene) complexes absorbing in the near&#8208;infrared&#8208;III window (1550 &#8208; 1870 nm) have been investigated. This class of complexes was found to be good photothermal agents (PTAs) in toluene under 1600 nm laser irradiation with photothermal efficiencies around 40 and 60% depending on the nature of the dithiolene ligand. To the best of our knowledge, these complexes are the first small molecular photothermal agents to absorb so far into the near infrared. To test their applicability in water, these hydrophobic complexes have been encapsulated into nanoparticles constituted by amphiphilic block&#8208;copolymers. Stable suspensions of polymeric nanoparticles (NPs) encapsulating the gold&#8208;bis(dithiolene) complexes have been prepared which show a diameter around 100 nm. The encapsulation rate was found to be strongly dependent on the nature of the dithiolene ligands. The photothermal properties of the aqueous suspensions containing gold&#8208;bis(dithiolene) complexes were then studied under 1600 nm laser irradiation. These studies demonstrate that water has strong photothermal activity in the NIR&#8208;III region that, cannot be overcome even with the addition of gold complexes displaying good photothermal properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Silicon and Germanium Functionalized Perylene Diimides &#8211; Synthesis, Optoelectronic Properties, and their Application as Non&#8208;Fullerene Acceptors in Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic solar cells have been continuously studied and developed through the last decades. A major step in their development was the introduction of fused&#8208;ring non&#8208;fullerene electron acceptors. Yet, beside their high efficiency, they suffer from complex synthesis and stability issues. Perylene&#8208;based non&#8208;fullerene acceptors, in contrast, can be prepared in only a few synthesis steps and display good photochemical and thermal stability. Herein, we introduce four monomeric perylene diimide acceptors obtained in a three&#8208;step synthesis. In these molecules, the semi&#8208;metals silicon and germanium were added in the bay position, on one or both sides of the molecules, resulting in asymmetric and symmetric compounds with a red&#8208;shifted absorption compared to non&#8208;substituted perylene diimide. Introducing two germanium atoms improved the crystallinity and charge carrier mobility in the blend with the conjugated polymer PM6. In addition, charge carrier separation is significantly influenced by the high crystallinity of this blend, as shown by transient absorption spectroscopy. As a result, the solar cells reached a power conversion efficiency of 5.38%, which is one of the highest efficiencies of monomeric perylene diimide&#8208;based solar cells recorded to date.</dc:description>

         <title>Mn(II) Polypyridyl Complexes: Precursors to High Valent Mn(V)=O Species and Inhibitors of Cancer Cell Proliferation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reaction of [(L)MnII]2+ (L = neutral polypyridine ligand framework) in the presence of mCPBA (m&#8208;chloroperoxybenzoic acid) generates a putative Mn(V)=O species at RT. The proposed Mn(V)=O species is capable of performing the aromatic hydroxylation of Cl&#8208;benzoic acid derived from mCPBA to give [(L)MnIII(m&#8208;Cl&#8208;salicylate)]+, which in the presence of excess mCPBA generates a metastable [(L)MnV(O)(m&#8208;Cl&#8208;salicylate)]+, characterized by UV/Vis absorption, EPR, resonance Raman spectroscopy, and ESI&#8208;MS studies. The current study highlights the fact that [(L)MnIII(m&#8208;Cl&#8208;salicylate)]+ formation may not be a dead end for catalysis. Further, a plausible mechanism has been proposed for the formation of [(L)MnV(O)&#8208;m&#8208;Cl&#8208;salicylate)]+ from [(L)MnIII(m&#8208;Clsalicylate)]+. The characterized transient [(L)MnV(O)&#8208;m&#8208;Cl&#8208;salicylate)]+ reported in the current work exhibits high reactivity for oxygen atom transfer reactions, supported by the electrophilic character depicted from Hammett studies using a series of para&#8208;substituted thioanisoles. The unprecedented study starting from a non&#8208;heme neutral polypyridine ligand framework paves a path for mimicking the natural active site of photosystem II under ambient conditions. Finally, evaluating the intracellular effect of Mn(II) complexes revealed an enhanced intracellular ROS and mitochondrial dysfunction to prevent the proliferation of hepatocellular carcinoma and breast cancer cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Unravelling the Mystery of COVID&#8208;19 Pathogenesis: Spike Protein and Cu Can Synergize to Trigger ROS Production</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The COVID&#8208;19 pandemic has had a devastating impact on global health, highlighting the need to understand how the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 virus damages the lungs in order to develop effective treatments. Recent research has shown that patients with COVID&#8208;19 experience severe oxidative damage to various biomolecules. We propose that the overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 infection involves an interaction between copper ions and the virus's spike protein. We tested two peptide fragments, Ac&#8208;ELDKYFKNH&#8208;NH2 (L1) and Ac&#8208;WSHPQFEK&#8208;NH2 (L2), derived from the spike protein of the Wuhan strain and the &#946; variant, respectively, and found that they bind Cu(II) ions and form a three&#8208;nitrogen complexes at lung pH. Our research demonstrates that these complexes trigger the overproduction of ROS, which can break both DNA strands and transform DNA into its linear form. Using A549 cells, we demonstrated that ROS overproduction occurs in the mitochondria, not in the cytoplasm. Our findings highlight the importance of the interaction between copper ions and the virus's spike protein in the development of lung damage and may aid in the development of therapeutic procedures.</dc:description>

This concept article provides new opportuinies of employing metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) as solid platforms to activate small molecules like hydrogen due to intrinsic sites in MOFs that behave as frustrated Lewis acid&#8208;base pairs, thus featuring new avenues for heterogeneous catalysis using MOFs as solid catalysts.New Opportunities in Metal&#8211;organic Framework Catalysis: From Bifunctional to Frustrated Lewis Pairs Catalysis (Garcia, Dhakshinamoorthy, and Asiri)







Abstract
This article highlights novel prospects for metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) in heterogeneous catalysis as having frustrated Lewis acid&#8208;base pairs (FLPs) or as bifunctional acid&#8208;base solid catalysts able to activate molecular hydrogen. Starting from the extensive application MOFs as Lewis acid and Lewis base catalysts, this article uses catalytic hydrogenation to briefly summarize the efforts made to heterogenize boron and amine in MOFs to mimic molecular FLP systems. The core of this concept is based on recent findings which demonstrate the ability of two commonly used MOFs, namely UiO&#8208;66 and MIL&#8208;101, to catalyze the selective hydrogenation of polar double X=Y bonds at moderate H2 pressures below 10&#8197;bar. The influence of electron&#8208;donating, the withdrawal of substituents on the linker, and the aniline poisoning effect highlight the significance of Lewis acid sites, while density&#8208;functional theory calculations indicate the heterolytic H&#8722;H bond cleavage at the MOF metal oxo clusters. It is expected that this new perspective on MOFs as solid FLP systems will spur further research to explore and define the potential of dual sites in the catalytic activation of small molecules.

Thermoresponsive molecular structure based on a disilane&#8208;bridged bis(pyridyl) ligand and CuI is reported. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis revealed that there were two polymorphs in the Cu(I) complex: octanuclear copper(I) complex at 20&#8201;&#176;C and 1D staircase copper(I) polymer complex at &#8722;173&#8201;&#176;C. The formation of these polymorphs is due to the flexibility of the disilane&#8208;bridged ligand.







Abstract
A thermoresponsive structural change based on a disilane&#8208;bridged bis(pyridine) ligand and CuI is reported. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis revealed that there are two polymorphs in the Cu(I) complex: octanuclear copper(I) complex at 20&#8201;&#176;C and 1D staircase copper(I) polymer complex at &#8722;173&#8201;&#176;C. The formation of these polymorphs is due to the flexibility of the ligand. Cu&#8722;I bond formation is observed upon cooling the sample from &#8722;10&#8201;&#176;C to &#8722;170&#8201;&#176;C. The temperature&#8208;induced phase transition progression was clarified by DSC, VT&#8208;PXRD, and VT&#8208;photoluminescence measurements and indicated a reversible temperature&#8208;controlled crystal&#8208;to&#8208;crystal phase transition. Observation on a VT&#8208;stage using a high&#8208;speed camera showed crystal cracking during single&#8208;crystal to single&#8208;crystal transitions between these polymorphic forms.

         <title>Nature&#8208;Inspired Chemistry of Complex Alkaloids: Combining Targeted Molecular Networking Approach and Semisynthetic Strategy to Access Rare Communesins in a Marine&#8208;Derived Penicillium expansum</title>

Rare heptacyclic alkaloids, namely communesins, could be specifically targeted on a molecular network and further obtained by semisynthesis. This work describes a comprehensive strategy to access unrevealed chemodiversity from fungi.







Abstract
Communesins are rare alkaloids isolated from fungi of the genus Penicillium. In this work, the extract of a marine&#8208;derived Penicillium expansum strain was studied using targeted molecular networking approach allowing to detect 65 communesins including 55 new ones. A fragmentation pattern for dimethylvinyl communesins was established and a script was implemented allowing to predict the structure and map all communesins in a global molecular network. A semisynthetic strategy was carried out to obtain some minor congeners from the two isolated communesins A and B. Nine communesins were then synthetised: two of them were already described as produced by the studied strain; four are new natural products which occurrence in the extracts was confirmed; three are new semi&#8208;synthetic analogues never described so far. These communesins were evaluated for their cytotoxicity on two human cancer cell lines KB and MCF&#8208;7 leading to a preliminary study of their structure&#8208;activity relationships.

         <title>Paramagnetic Relaxation Agents for Enhancing Temporal Resolution and Sensitivity in Multinuclear FlowNMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 38, July 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
With the right amount of an easily available chromium(III) complex bearing a bulky acetylacetonato ligand to keep it chemically inert, NMR spectra acquired in continuous flow give much better data due to significantly reduced polarisation and relaxation times without undue peak broadening or loss of 2D methods.







Abstract
Sensitivity in FlowNMR spectroscopy for reaction monitoring often suffers from low levels of pre&#8208;magnetisation due to limited residence times of the sample in the magnetic field. While this in&#8208;flow effect is tolerable for high sensitivity nuclei such as 1H and 19F, it significantly reduces the signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio in 31P and 13C spectra, making FlowNMR impractical for low sensititvity nuclei at low concentrations. Paramagnetic relaxation agents (PRAs), which enhance polarisation and spin&#8208;lattice relaxation, could eliminate the adverse in&#8208;flow effect and improve the signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio. Herein, [Co(acac)3], [Mn(acac)3], [Fe(acac)3], [Cr(acac)3], [Ni(acac)2]3, [Gd(tmhd)3] and [Cr(tmhd)3] are investigated for their effectiveness in improving signal intensity per unit time in FlowNMR applications under the additional constraint of chemical inertness towards catalytically active transition metal complexes. High&#8208;spin Cr(III) acetylacetonates emerged as the most effective compounds, successfully reducing 31P T1 values four&#8208; to five&#8208;fold at PRA concentrations as low as 10&#8197;mM without causing adverse line broadening. Whereas [Cr(acac)3] showed signs of chemical reactivity with a mixture of triphenylphosphine, triphenylphosphine oxide and triphenylphosphate over the course of several hours at 80&#176; C, the bulkier [Cr(tmhd)3] was stable and equally effective as a PRA under these conditions. Compatibility with a range of representative transition metal complexes often used in homogeneous catalysis has been investigated, and application of [Cr(tmhd)3] in significantly improving 1H and 31P{1H} FlowNMR data quality in a Rh&#8208;catalysed hydroformylation reaction has been demonstrated. With the PRA added, 13C relaxation times were reduced more than six&#8208;fold, allowing quantitative reaction monitoring of substrate consumption and product formation by 13C{1H} FlowNMR spectroscopy at natural abundance.

         <title>Sulfide&#8208;Directed Ir&#8208;Catalyzed Vinylic sp2 and Benzylic sp3&#8197;C&#8722;H Activation for the Construction of Sulfur&#8208;Containing Medium&#8208;Ring System</title>

Thio&#8208;directed sp2 and sp3&#8197;C&#8722;H activation is a new strategy for the construction of a sulfur&#8208;containing medium&#8208;ring system. Cationic Ir&#8208;catalyzed intramolecular hydroarylation to alkynes gave dihydrobenzothiepines and dibenzo[b,f]thiepines.







Abstract
Ir&#8208;catalyzed transformations initiated by sulfur&#8208;directed vinylic sp2 and benzylic sp3&#8197;C&#8722;H activation are disclosed that achieve the construction of sulfur&#8208;containing seven&#8208; and eight&#8208;membered systems. Allyl 2&#8208;alkynylphenyl sulfides were transformed into dihydrobenzothiepines in 30&#8211;95&#8201;% yield, and 2&#8208;alkynylaryl 2&#8208;tolyl sulfides were converted into dibenzo[b,f]thiepines in 57&#8211;95&#8201;% yield along with double bond isomerization. In both reactions, the combination of Ir catalyst and sulfide moiety was a key to the facile cyclization.

Be positive for imaging A series of luminescent cationic solution and solid&#8208;state emitters have been synthesized and applied for bioimaging purposes. In addition to low toxicity and facile synthesis, these emitters revealed striking uptake into biological samples such as human cells, bacteria as well as protists with high contrast during the fluorescence microscopy.







Abstract
A library of eight different cationic emitters with emission properties in solution and in solid&#8208;state (solution and solid&#8208;state emitters &#8211; SSSE) is presented. These compounds, bearing either ammonium or pyridinium groups, have been investigated regarding their photophysical properties as well as their potential application in biological imaging. Besides high quantum yields as well as a high degree of stability during the imaging process, it was additionally revealed that a broad range of biological targets can be addressed, such as different bacterial strains, human cells as well as protists. The reported SSSE approach employing the mentioned robust emitters for biological imaging, will contribute to a rapid and facile way to design and apply affordable emitters with outstanding properties. Additionally, these emitters will overcome the drawbacks of classical luminophores and agents featuring well&#8208;known aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) or aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) properties.

         <title>Clusterization&#8208;Triggered Room Temperature Phosphorescence Supramolecular Assembly with Extraordinary Stimulus&#8208;responsive Features from Nonaromatic Amino Acids</title>

A universal approach to construct colors&#8208;tunable RTP supramolecular hybrid co&#8208;assemblies is proposed (AC@amino acid) with excitation wavelength&#8208;dependent properties through co&#8208;assembly of functional layered aminoclay (AC) and various nonconjugated amino acid via simple and environmentally friendly magnetic stirring strategy, which exhibit sensitive stimulus response features towards water and multilevel information encryption application.







Abstract
Achieving stimulus&#8208;responsive performance in room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials especially systems without classic conjugated groups is attractive and important but remains a great challenge. Herein we propose a universal approach to construct colors&#8208;tunable RTP supramolecular co&#8208;assemblies (AC@amino acid) with excitation wavelength&#8208;dependent properties through co&#8208;assembly of functional aminoclay (AC) and nonconjugated amino acid using environmentally friendly strategy. Experimental and theoretical results successfully disclose that the RTP feature is attributable to space conjugation through effective space electronic communications among different &#960; and n (lone pair) electrons of amino acid molecules and the effective stabilization of their triplet state by AC. Meanwhile, their colors&#8208;tunable performances are mainly owing to the co&#8208;existence of clusters with different aggregates degree through recrystallization of amino acid taking AC as a template. Importantly, AC@amino acid exhibit sensitive stimulus response features towards water, yet their RTP performance can be maintained in other solvents, such as ethanol (EtOH). By virtue of this unique feature, multilevel information encryption application were demonstrated. This work provides a unique insight and more deep understanding on designing novel RTP systems without classic conjugated groups. Importantly, their extraordinary stimulus&#8208;responsive performances endow these RTP systems with a highly promising potential for intelligent information encryption applications.

         <title>Harnessing Clickable Acylated Glycerol Probes as Chemical Tools for Tracking Glycerolipid Metabolism</title>

Clickable monoacylglycerol (MAG) analogs are used as probes to label glycerolipids during lipid metabolism. C4&#8208;MAG&#8208;N3, with a relatively short acyl chain, infiltrates natural lipid biosynthetic pathways to produce click&#8208;tagged versions of both neutral and phospholipid products. Strategic blocking of the glycerol sn&#8208;3 position in probe C4&#8208;MEG&#8208;N3 deactivates phospholipid tagging and focuses labeling on neutral lipids.







Abstract
We report the use of clickable monoacylglycerol (MAG) analogs as probes for the labeling of glycerolipids during lipid metabolism. Incorporation of azide tags onto the glycerol region was pursued to develop probes that would label glycerolipids, in which the click tag would not be removed through processes including acyl chain and headgroup remodeling. Analysis of clickable MAG probes containing acyl chains of different length resulted in widely variable cell imaging and cytotoxicity profiles. Based on these results, we focused on a probe bearing a short acyl chain (C4&#8208;MAG&#8208;N3) that was found to infiltrate natural lipid biosynthetic pathways to produce click&#8208;tagged versions of both neutral and phospholipid products. Alternatively, strategic blocking of the glycerol sn&#8208;3 position in probe C4&#8208;MEG&#8208;N3 served to deactivate phospholipid tagging and focus labeling on neutral lipids. This work shows that lipid metabolic labeling profiles can be tuned based on probe structures and provides valuable tools for evaluating alterations to lipid metabolism in cells.

         <title>Helical Anatase Titanium Nanotubes through a Protected Crystallization Strategy for Enhanced Photocatalytic Performance</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 38, July 6, 2023. </description>

A novel helical anatase titanium nanotube was prepared through a protected crystallization strategy for photocatalytic hydrogen production. Helical anatase titanium nanotube possesses abundant defects of oxygen vacancy and Ti3+ species owing to the twisted structure and exhibits superior photocatalytic activity for hydrogen production.







Abstract
Helical structure in catalysts has attracted attention and been recently investigated for various catalytic reactions. However, helical transition metal oxides suffer from uncontrollable crystallization processes at high temperatures when being transformed from an amorphous phase into a crystalline structure. Herein, we report a helical anatase TiO2 nanotube for the first time, which has been prepared using a protected crystallization strategy in the confined space of silica. A single chirality of helical TiO2 has been used to track the ordering of the twisted structure. The twisted structure in helical anatase TiO2 nanotube is maintained after a vigorous crystallization process. Helical anatase TiO2 nanotubes possess more accessible active sites and abundant defects of oxygen vacancy and Ti3+ species owing to the twisted structure. The obtained helical anatase TiO2 nanotube exhibits superior photocatalytic activity for hydrogen production without adding any co&#8208;catalysts. This work provides new insights into the role of helical structure in transition metal&#8208;based catalysts.

Helical anatase TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanotubes possess more accessible active sites and abundant defects of oxygen vacancy and Ti&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; species owing to the twisted structure. The obtained helical anatase TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanotube exhibits superior photocatalytic activity for hydrogen production without adding any co-catalysts. This work provides new insights into the role of helical structure in transition metal-based catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Design, Synthesis and Aromaticity of an Alternating Cyclo[4]Thiophene[4]Furan</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 38, July 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An alternating furan&#8208;thiophene macrocycle has been synthesized without the need for stepwise buildup of oligomers. The ring is weakly antiaromatic due to the 4n&#8197;&#960; electrons along the outer annulene pathway of carbon atoms. The macrocycle can be made globally aromatic through chemical oxidation with SbCl5.







Abstract
A new class of conjugated macrocycle, the cyclo[4]thiophene[4]furan hexyl ester (C4TE4FE), is reported. This cycle consists of alternating &#945;&#8208;linked thiophene&#8208;3&#8208;ester and furan&#8208;3&#8208;ester repeat units, and was prepared in a single step using Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura cross&#8208;coupling of a 2&#8208;(thiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)furan monomer. The ester side groups help promote a syn conformation of the heterocycles, which enables formation of the macrocycle. Cyclic voltammetry studies revealed that C4TE4FE could undergo multiple oxidations, so treatment with SbCl5 resulted in formation of the [C4TE4FE]2+ dication. Computational work, paired with 1H&#8197;NMR spectroscopy of the dication, revealed that the cycle becomes globally aromatic upon 2e&#8722; oxidation, as the annulene pathway along the outer ring becomes H&#252;ckel aromatic. The change in ring current for the cycle upon oxidation was clear from 1H&#8197;NMR spectroscopy, as the protons of the thiophene and furan rings shifted downfield by nearly 6&#8197;ppm. This work highlights the potential of sequence control in furan&#8208;based macrocycles to tune electronic properties.

         <title>Normal vs. Inverted Ordering of Reduction Potentials in [FeFe]&#8208;Hydrogenases Biomimetics: Effect of the Dithiolate Bulk</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 38, July 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical and DFT investigations of the redox behaviours of a series of hexacarbonyl diiron dithiolate complexes [Fe2(CO)6(&#956;&#8208;(SCH2)2X)] with different substitution at the bridge&#8208;head atom show that, in the same experimental conditions, the dithiolate bulk exerts a control in the ordering of reduction potentials (inverted vs. normal) and in the timing of the structural changes coupled to the electron transfers.







Abstract
Three hexacarbonyl diiron dithiolate complexes [Fe2(CO)6(&#956;&#8208;(SCH2)2X)] with different substituted bridgeheads (X=CH2, CEt2, CBn2 (Bn=CH2C6H5)), have been studied under the same experimental conditions by cyclic voltammetry in dichloromethane [NBu4][PF6] 0.2&#8197;M. DFT calculations were performed to rationalize the mechanism of reduction of these compounds. The three complexes undergo a two&#8208;electron transfer whose the mechanism depends on the bulkiness of the dithiolate bridge, which involves a different timing of the structural changes (Fe&#8722;S bond cleavage, inversion of conformation and CO bridging) vs redox steps. The introduction of a bulky group in the dithiolate linker has obviously an effect on normally ordered (as for propanedithiolate (pdt)) or inverted (pdtEt2, pdtBn2) reduction potentials. Et&#8594;Bn replacement is not theoretically predicted to alter the geometry and energy of the most stable mono&#8208;reduced and bi&#8208;reduced forms but such a replacement alters the kinetics of the electron transfer vs the structural changes.

A new organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid phase transition (OIHPT) material, (C5NH13Cl)2MnBr4 shows magnetic, dielectric and luminescence synergetic response at near room temperature.







Abstract
Multifunctional materials with working temperatures near room temperature are crucial for practical applications. Until now, it is still a great challenge to obtain such materials. In this paper, a complex of (C5NH13Cl)2MnBr4 (1) with a structural phase transition near room temperature is reported. The phase transition induces switchable magnetic properties, dielectric anomalies and luminescent response over the same range of temperatures. It is the first time the synergetic effect of magnetism, dielectricity and luminescence near room temperature have been observed in the same molecular complex.

         <title>Viscous, Hofmeister Effect&#8208;Enhanced Macromolecular Adhesives for Effective Bonding in Seawater</title>

Viscous, Hofmeister effect&#8208;enhanced macromolecular adhesives were synthesized via a facile one&#8208;step copolymerization. The Hofmeister effect effectively improve the adhesive performance of the polymeric adhesives in nature seawater.







Abstract
Deployment of adhesives in natural seawater to in&#8197;situ bonds is urgently needed in engineering fields. However, stable adhesion in natural seawater remains a challenge due to the turbulent environment and high ion concentration. Herein, we reported a viscous, macromolecular underwater adhesive enhanced by Hofmeister effect (EHUA) for practical application in dynamic seawater. EHUA was synthesized via a facile one&#8208;step copolymerization. After transferred into seawater, the solvent of EHUA was exchanged to seawater, and thereby hydrogen bonds inside the adhesive were activated and enhanced by Hofmeister effect. We demonstrated EHUA can adhere on the surface in turbulent seawater, and the adhesive strength could reach 1.691&#8197;MPa. In addition, the adhesives also exhibited long&#8208;term storage stability and convenient recyclability. These fascinating properties enable adhesives to seal leaky pipelines, repair damaged ships and construct buildings in turbulent seawater. This work may open an avenue for the design of adhesives for seawater environments.

         <title>N&#8208;Protonation as a Switch of the Twisted Excited States with &#960;&#960;* or n&#960;* Character and Correlation with the &#960;&#8208;Electrons Characteristic of Rotatable Bonds</title>

         <dc:description>
Two mechanisms are uncovered that control fluorescence through N&#8208;protonation in nitrogen&#8208;containing fluorescent probes. The first mechanism regulates the transition to a &#960;&#960;* TICT state, while the second applies when a nonradiative decay pathway dominates, involving a dark n&#960;* state that is also accompanied by structural twisting and can be considered a type of TICT state.







Abstract
N&#8208;protonation for numerous fluorophores is widely known as an efficient switch for the fluorescence turn&#8208;on/off in acidic conditions, which has been applied in various scenarios that involve pH monitoring. Yet the universal mechanism for fluorescence regulation through N&#8208;protonation is still elusive. Herein, the excited state deactivation processes are systematically investigated for a series of nitrogen&#8208;containing fluorescent probes through theoretical approaches. Two types of mechanisms for the complex fluorescent phenomena by N&#8208;protonation are concluded: one is through the regulation for the transition to a &#960;&#960;* twisted intramolecular charge transfer (TICT) state; the other one applies for the case when nonradiative decay pathway is predominant by a dark n&#960;* state, which is also accompanied by an evident structural twisting and can be regarded as another kind of TICT state. More generally, the formation of the TICT state is closely related to the conjugated &#960;&#8208;electrons on the single bond that links the acceptor and donor part of fluorophores, which provides a simple strategy for evaluating the occurrence of the TICT process. The current contributions can bring novel insights for the rational design of functional fluorophores that involve TICT process in the excited states.

         <title>Effects of Central Elements on the Properties of Group 13 Dialdiminate Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 38, July 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Element&#8208;dependent photophysical properties were observed from dialdiminate complexes containing Group&#8197;13 elements. Alteration of the central elements results in a shift in the absorption wavelength, an enhancement of the responsiveness toward Lewis bases, and the appearance of the ligand exchange reactions. In this paper, the mechanisms are explored.







Abstract
Novel luminescent dialdiminate complexes of the Group&#8197;13 elements were prepared to evaluate the effects of the central element on their properties. We demonstrate that their absorption wavelength and the response to Lewis bases apparently depend on the central atom. The aluminum complex exhibited the absorption band in the higher&#8208;energy region than the gallium and indium congeners. Theoretical calculations suggest that the aluminum complex has a lower&#8208;lying highest&#8208;occupied molecular orbital than the other complexes. Additionally, the emission intensity of the aluminum complex clearly changed in response to a Lewis base. Quantum chemical calculations suggest that these element&#8208;dependent optical properties could originate from the difference in the electric charges on the central elements. Interestingly, the ligand exchange reactions were observed in the indium complexes together with the changes in the optical properties and controlled by the addition of InCl3 and InMe3. Furthermore, all the complexes showed aggregation&#8208;induced emission enhancement (AIEE) and crystallization&#8208;induced emission enhancement (CIEE) properties. These results lead to proposing a practical strategy for manipulating the optoelectronic properties coupled with the reactivities of complexes by choosing the central elements in the same group.

         <title>Construction of Ternary Bismuth&#8208;Based Heterojunction by Using (BiO)2CO3 as Electron Bridge for Highly Efficient Degradation of Phenol</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 38, July 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Z&#8208;scheme Bi2O3/(BiO)2CO3/Bi2MoO6 heterojunction was fabricated. It exhibited excellent photocatalytic performances for phenol degradation, which was ascribed to the formation of a Z&#8208;scheme heterojunction, and the presence of (BiO)2CO3 that performed as an electron bridge to enable the migration distance of photogenerated electron from ECB of Bi2O3 to EVB of Bi2MoO6 to be shortened, greatly promoting the efficient separation of photogenerated electron&#8208;hole pairs.







Abstract
Inspired by nature, it has been considered an effective approach to design artificial photosynthetic system by fabricating Z&#8208;scheme photocatalysts to eliminate environmental issues and alleviate the global energy crisis. However, the development of low cost, environment&#8208;friendly, and high&#8208;efficient photocatalysts by utilizing solar energy still confronts huge challenge. Herein, we constructed a Bi2O3/(BiO)2CO3/Bi2MoO6 ternary heterojunction via a facile solvothermal method and calcination approach and used it as a photocatalyst for the degradation of phenol. The optimized Bi2O3/(BiO)2CO3/Bi2MoO6 heterojunction delivers a considerable activity for phenol photodegradation with an impressive removal efficiency of 98.8&#8201;% and about total organic carbon (TOC) of 68&#8201;% within 180&#8197;min under visible&#8208;light irradiation. The excellent photocatalytic activity was ascribed to the formation of a Z&#8208;scheme heterojunction, more importantly, the presence of (BiO)2CO3 as an electron bridge greatly shortens the migration distance of photogenerated electron from ECB of Bi2O3 to EVB of Bi2MoO6, thus prolonging the lifetime of photogenerated electrons, which is verified by trapping experiments, electron spin&#8208;resonance spectroscopy (ESR) results, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This work provides a potential strategy to fabricate highly efficient Bi&#8208;based Z&#8208;scheme photocatalysts with wide application prospects in solar&#8208;to&#8208;fuel conversion and environmental protection.

         <title>Enabling Ultrahigh Surface Area of Covalently&#8208;linked Organic Framework for Boosted CO2 Capture: An Air Liquid Interfacial Plasma as Post&#8208;furnishing Protocol</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 38, July 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The underlining features of the presented work focuses on development of a covalently&#8208;linked organic framework (COF) following a simple time&#8208;competent hydrothermal procedure. Successively, a facile, economical and scalable post&#8208;modification approach, i.&#8201;e., air liquid interfacial plasma (ALIP) induced protocol is adopted to explicitly amplifies the surface area to a higher value of 2051&#8197;m2/g which concurrently advances the CO2 uptake performance up to 67&#8201;%.







Abstract
The cognitive intent of a highly ordered and robust adsorbent is extremely sensible and, in this context, Covalent Organic Framework (COF) materials have significantly burgeoned their scope in diverse applications. Herein, a simple time&#8208;competent hydrothermal procedure is presented to construct a covalent framework with an ultrahigh surface area of 1428&#8197;m2/g that shows active adsorption of carbon dioxide (CO2) at variable temperature ranges. Moreover, a facile scalably controlled post&#8208;synthetic air liquid interfacial plasma (ALIP) induced protocol is substantiated that explicitly amplifies the surface area of the pristine framework even to a higher value of 2051&#8197;m2/g. The post&#8208;synthetic plasma approach presented here led to the rapid enhancement of the surface area of the pristine COF by 43&#8201;%, which concurrently advances the CO2 uptake up to 67&#8201;%. Hence, the current study may open up a new frontier in the design as well as fine&#8208;tune the properties of the covalent framework that unfolds the advanced outlook in addressing the challenges of CO2 capture.

The introduction of remote electron&#8208;withdrawing groups in N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene catalyst increased enantioselectivity of the benzoin reaction at the cost of the reaction rate. The increased enantioselectivity was rationalized by DFT calculations with noncovalent&#8208;interaction and distortion/interaction&#8208;energy analyses.







Abstract
A remote electronic effect of chiral aminoindanol&#8208;derived N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene catalyst on an asymmetric benzoin reaction was investigated. The catalyst bearing remote electron&#8208;withdrawing substituents increased enantioselectivity of the reaction at the cost of the reaction rate. DFT calculations rationalized the increased enantioselectivity.

         <title>Polymeric Unimolecular CO Dehydrogenase Mimic with both Inner and Outer Spheres for Enhanced Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction in Aqueous Solution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 38, July 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polymeric unimolecular nanozyme Co&#8208;1 with three&#8208;level coordination spheres as a mimic of CODH is reported herein. Visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced photocatalytic CO2 reduction in aqueous solution was achieved with a TONCO of 1731.2, which is comparable to most of molecular catalysts in water. Mechanism study discloses that this structurally well&#8208;defined CODH mimic can stabilize the CO2 adduct intermediate and capture CO2 to improve catalytic activity and selectivity in the similar way as CODH.







Abstract
Inspired by carbon monoxide dehydrogenase (CODH), mimicking its inner and outer spheres is a promising strategy in CO2 reduction catalyst design. However, artificial CODH&#8208;like catalysts are generally limited to the inner sphere effect and only applicable in organic solvents or for electrocatalysis. Herein, an aqueous CODH mimic with both inner and outer spheres for photocatalysis is reported. In this polymeric unimolecular catalyst, the inner sphere is composed of cobalt porphyrin with four appended amido groups and the outer sphere consists of four poly(2&#8208;(dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate) (PDMAEMA) arms. Upon visible light irradiation (&#955; &gt;420&#8197;nm), the as&#8208;prepared catalyst exhibits a turnover number (TONCO) of 1731.2 in the reduction of CO2 into CO, which is comparable to most reported molecular catalysts in aqueous solution. The mechanism studies indicate that, in this water&#8208;dispersible and structurally well&#8208;defined CODH mimic, the cobalt porphyrin core serves as the catalysis center and the amido groups function as hydrogen&#8208;bonding pillars helping to stabilize the CO2 adduct intermediate, whereas the PDMAEMA shell renders both water solubility and a CO2 reservoir through reversibly capturing of CO2. The present work has clarified the significance of coordination sphere effects for improving the aqueous photocatalytic CO2 reduction performance of CODH mimics.

         <title>Superoxide Dismutase&#8208;like Activity of Zeolitic Imidazolate Framework Nanoparticles Comprising Biomimetic Imidazolato&#8208;bridged CuZn Units</title>

Nanosized mixed&#8208;metal zeolitic imidazolate frameworks possess superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity. The CuZn&#8208;ZIF&#8208;8 nanoparticle closely mimics the active site of CuZn&#8208;SOD and exhibits exceptional SOD&#8208;like activity and recyclability due to its numerous copper active sites. These porous nanoparticles hold promise for future applications.







Abstract
Nanoparticles exhibiting enzymatic functions have garnered considerable attention due to their structural robustness and the profusion of active sites that can be introduced to a single nanosized particle. Here we report that nanosized mixed&#8208;metal zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) show a superoxide dismutase (SOD)&#8208;like catalytic activity. We chose a ZIF composed of copper and zinc ions and 2&#8208;methylimidazole, CuZn&#8208;ZIF&#8208;8, in which the Cu and Zn ions are bridged by an imidazolato ligand. This coordination geometry closely mimics the active site of CuZn superoxide dismutase (CuZnSOD). The CuZn&#8208;ZIF&#8208;8 nanoparticles exhibit potent SOD&#8208;like activity, attributed to their porous nature and numerous copper active sites, and also possess exceptional recyclability.

Mechanistic insights into enantioconvergent amination of racemic benzenesulfonohydrazide catalyzed by Cu and chiral phosphoric acid with computational prediction of various phosphoric acids as promising co&#8208;catalysts.







Abstract
Density functional theory computations reveal mechanistic insights into Cu and chiral phosphoric acid (CPA) catalyzed enantioconvergent amination of racemic benzenesulfonohydrazide. The O&#8722;O bond homolysis of tert&#8208;butyl 4&#8208;phenylbutaneperoxoate was found to be the turnover&#8208;limiting step with a total free energy barrier of 19.1&#8197;kcal/mol. The enantioconvergent amination is realized to obtain the same intermediate through prochiral carbon atom. The order and mode of hydrogen atom transferred by CPA and tert&#8208;butyloxy have a significant influence on the enantioselectivity and energy barriers. The olefinic side product generated by &#946;&#8208;hydride elimination is 9.9&#8197;kcal/mol thermodynamically less favourable. A series of phosphoric acids are predicted as promising co&#8208;catalysts with lower barriers for O&#8722;O bond homolysis.

         <title>Accelerated Solid Phase Glycan Synthesis: ASGS</title>

Fast and efficient: High shear stirring accelerates glycan synthesis on solid support and enables efficient and fast glycosylation that competes even with glycosyl donor hydrolysis in an open vessel.







Abstract
Solid phase synthesis is the most dominant approach for the preparation of biological oligomers as it enables the introduction of monomers iteratively. Accelerated solid phase synthesis of biological oligomers is crucial for chemical biology, but its application to the synthesis of oligosaccharides is not trivial. Solid&#8208;phase oligosaccharide assembly is a slow process performed in a variety of conditions and temperatures, requires an inert gas atmosphere, and demands high excess of glycosyl donors. The process is done in special synthesizers and poor mixing of the solid support increases the risk of diffusion&#8208;independent hydrolysis of the activated donors. High shear stirring is a new way to accelerate solid phase synthesis. The efficient mixing ensures that reactive intermediates can diffuse faster to the solid support thereby increasing the kinetics of the reactions. We report here a stirring&#8208;based accelerated solid&#8208;phase oligosaccharide synthesis. We harnessed high shear mixing to perform diffusion&#8208;dependent glycosylation in a short reaction time. We minimized the use of glycosyl donors and the need to use an inert atmosphere. We showed that by tailoring the deprotection and glycosylation conditions to the same temperature, assembly steps are performed continuously, and full glycosylation cycles are completed in minutes.

         <title>Stimuli Responsive Features of Organic RTP Materials: An Intriguing Carbazole&#8208;Cyclic Triimidazole Derivative</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 38, July 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The triimidazole&#8208;carbazole derivative TT&#8208;Ph&#8208;Cz here synthesized possesses high conformational freedom resulting in rigidochromic and multi&#8208;stimuli responsive emissive behavior. The origin of the compound stimuli&#8208;responsiveness is interpreted through X&#8208;ray diffraction and DFT&#8208;TDDFT studies. Interconversion between TT&#8208;Ph&#8208;Cz solvated and unsolvated phases occurs through solvent fuming and/or thermal treatment. Phosphorescent aqueous nanoaggregates are prepared from solvent/non&#8208;solvent solutions.







Abstract
Stimuli responsive luminescent materials possessing room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) are extremely desirable for various applications. The here investigated derivative of cyclic triimidazole (TT) functionalized with carbazole (Cz), namely TT&#8208;Ph&#8208;Cz, belongs to this class. TT&#8208;Ph&#8208;Cz possesses high conformational freedom resulting in rigidochromic and multi&#8208;stimuli responsive emissive behavior. It has been isolated as MeOH&#8208;solvated and de&#8208;solvated forms characterized by distinctive emissive features. In particular, the solvated form, in which hydrogen bonds with MeOH inhibit competitive non&#8208;radiative deactivation channels, possesses a higher quantum yield associated with a strong phosphorescence contribution which is preserved in DMSO/water solutions.

         <title>Tandem Hydroformylation&#8208;Aldol Condensation Reaction Enabled by Zn&#8208;MOF&#8208;74</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 38, July 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalytic amounts of Zn&#8208;MOF&#8208;74 promoted the aldol condensation in a cobalt&#8208;catalyzed hydroformylation reaction. The investigation of the system showed that the cobalt catalyst and Zn&#8208;MOF&#8208;74 facilitate the aldol condensation in a cooperative fashion. Zn&#8208;MOF&#8208;74 activates the aldehyde product by adsorption, as shown by DFT.







Abstract
The tandem hydroformylation&#8208;aldol condensation (tandem HF&#8208;AC) reaction offers an efficient synthetic route to the synthesis of industrially relevant products. The addition of Zn&#8208;MOF&#8208;74 to the cobalt&#8208;catalyzed hydroformylation of 1&#8208;hexene enables tandem HF&#8208;AC under milder pressure and temperature conditions than the aldox process, where zinc salts are added to cobalt&#8208;catalyzed hydroformylation reactions to promote aldol condensation. The yield of the aldol condensation products increases by up to 17&#8197;times compared to that of the homogeneous reaction without MOF and up to 5&#8197;times compared to the aldox catalytic system. Both Co2(CO)8 and Zn&#8208;MOF&#8208;74 are required to significantly enhance the activity of the catalytic system. Density functional theory simulations and Fourier&#8208;transform infrared experiments show that heptanal, the product of hydroformylation, adsorbs on the open metal site (OMS) of Zn&#8208;MOF&#8208;74, thereby increasing the electrophilic character of the carbonyl carbon atom and facilitating the condensation.

         <title>Stretching the Bisalkyne Raman Spectral Palette Reveals a New Electrophilic Covalent Motif</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 38, July 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Raman bioorthogonal imaging: Varying the electronics of the aryl end&#8208;caps of bisaryl diynes (BADY) widened the palette for multiplexed Raman imaging. Electron&#8208;poor end&#8208;caps revealed the covalent reactivity of the aryl&#8208;capped diynes, opening new avenues for covalent Raman imaging.







Abstract
Small heteroaryl&#8208;diyne (Het&#8208;DY) tags with distinct vibrational frequencies, and physiologically relevant cLog P were designed for multiplexed bioorthogonal Raman imaging. Pd&#8722;Cu catalyzed coupling, combined with the use of Lei ligand, was shown to improve overall yields of the desired heterocoupled Het&#8208;DY tags, minimizing the production of homocoupled side&#8208;products. Spectral data were in agreement with the trends predicted by DFT calculations and systematic introduction of electron&#8208; rich/poor rings stretched the frequency limit of aryl&#8208;capped diynes (2209&#8211;2243&#8197;cm&#8722;1). The improved Log P of these Het&#8208;DY tags was evident from their diffuse distribution in cellular uptake studies and functionalizing tags with organelle markers allowed the acquisition of location&#8208;specific biological images. LC&#8211;MS&#8208; and NMR&#8208;based assays showed that some heteroaryl&#8208;capped internal alkynes are potential nucleophile traps with structure&#8208;dependent reactivity. These biocompatible Het&#8208;DY tags, equipped with covalent reactivity, open up new avenues for Raman bioorthogonal imaging.

         <title>Toughening Hydrogels by Forming Robust Hydrazide&#8208;Transition Metal Coordination Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 38, July 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tough hydrogels were developed by forming robust hydrazide&#8208;Zn2+ coordination complexes. The mechanical properties of the resultant gels exhibited a notable temperature dependence and thus a good shape&#8208;memory ability due to the dynamic nature of coordination bonds. The reactive amine group of the hydrazide enables facile surface modification and functionalization based on Schiff's base reactions.







Abstract
Energy dissipation based on dynamic fracture of metal ligands is an effective way to toughen hydrogels for specific applications in biomedical and engineering fields. Exploration of new kinds of metal&#8208;ligand coordinates with robust bonding strength is crucial for the facile synthesis of tough gels. Here a hydrogel toughening strategy based on the formation of robust coordination complexes between the hydrazide ligands and zinc ions is reported. The resultant hydrogels exhibit high strength and toughness at room temperature. Their mechanical properties show temperature dependence due to the dynamic nature of coordination bonds. In addition, the amine group of hydrazides in the gel matrix provides a reactive site for Schiff's base reaction, enabling surface modification without influence on overall mechanical performances of the gel. The hydrazide ligands are easy to synthesize and can coordinate very well with several transition metals. Such a metal&#8208;ligand coordination should be suitable to develop tough soft materials with versatile applications.

         <title>A Blue Light and Two&#8208;Photon Activatable Rhodamine Fluorophore</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 38, July 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Investigation and regulation of biological structures and functions with light require precise characterization of the used illumination and imaging systems. Photoactivatable fluorophores (PAFs) deliver fluorescent signals upon light irradiation, therefore enabling spatiotemporal control of fluorescence distribution. Our immobilized photoactivatable rhodamine derivative can be activated by both blue light (1P) and NIR light (2P), providing stable high&#8208;contrast images by laser scanning microscopy.







Abstract
Photoactivatable fluorophores (PAFs) are powerful tools for biological imaging applications because they provide spatiotemporal control of fluorescence distribution. Many of the existing PAFs can only be activated by UV irradiation. In our study, we present a blue light (1P) and NIR light (2P) activatable rhodamine fluorophore. Next to the description of the synthesis and the investigation of the photoreaction, we demonstrate the use of our PAF in the context of laser scanning microscopy. By immobilization of our PAF in a hydrogel, we were able to write and read spatially resolved illumination patterns with excellent contrast after both one&#8208;photon and two&#8208;photon excitation.

         <title>From Proton to Boron: The Lewis Analogs of Protonated Br&#248;nsted Super Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 38, July 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chemistry of borylated sulfate, triflimidate and triflate anions were scouted in details with the aim of synthesizing the unique analogs of protonated Br&#248;nsted superacids. Those complexes were formed by successive borylation with a 9&#8208;boratriptycene derived Lewis super acid paired with a weakly coordinated anion, characterized in solution and in the solid state.







Abstract
Isolation and characterization of highly reactive intermediates are crucial to understand the nature of chemical reactivity. Accordingly, the reactivity of weakly coordinating anions (WCA), usually used to stabilized cationic super electrophiles are of fundamental interest. When a variety of WCA are known to form stable &#963;&#8208;complexes with a proton, inducing Br&#248;nsted super acidity, bis&#8208;coordinated weak&#8208;coordinated anions are much more elusive and considered as long&#8208;sought reactive species. In this work, the chemistry of borylated sulfate, triflimidate and triflate anions were scouted in details with the aim of synthetizing the unique analogs of protonated Br&#248;nsted superacids. Those complexes were formed by successive borylation with a 9&#8208;boratriptycene derived Lewis super acid paired with a weak coordinated anion, characterized in solution and in the solid state and exhibit unique structures and reactivities.

         <title>A N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene&#8208;Supported Zinc Catalyst for the 1,2&#8208;Regioselective Hydroboration of N&#8208;Heteroarenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 38, July 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A NHC&#8208;Zn complex with a fluorenyl sidearm catalyses the hydroboration of N&#8208;heteroarenes in highly 1,2&#8208;regioselective manner in addition to other routine substrates like carbonyl, ester, amide, and nitrile. A detailed computational analysis justifies the regioselectivity and also addresses the relative rate difference between different p&#8208;substituted pyridines. The computed pathway involves a molecular zinc hydride that is experimentally isolated and derivatized.







Abstract
A fluorenyl&#8208;tethered N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene LH (LH=[(Flu)H&#8722;(CH2)2&#8722;NHCDipp]) and its monoanionic version L&#8722; are explored in complexation with zinc towards the hydroboration of N&#8208;heteroarenes, carbonyl, ester, amide, and nitrile under ambient condition. The N&#8208;heteroarenes exhibit high 1,2&#8208;regioselectivity which is justified by computational analyses. The relative hydroboration rates of differently p&#8208;substituted (electron donating vs. withdrawing) pyridines are also addressed. The monodentate LH offers a better catalytic activity than the chelating L&#8722; for steric reasons despite both giving three&#8208;coordinate zinc complexes. The mechanism involves a Zn&#8722;H species at the heart of these catalytic processes which is trapped by Ph2CO. Computational studies suggest that the barrier to form the hydride complex is comparable to the barrier required for the following hydride transfer to pyridine.

         <title>Front Cover: Effects of Central Elements on the Properties of Group 13 Dialdiminate Complexes (Chem. Eur. J. 38/2023)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 38, July 6, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Group 13 elements diversify the luminescent behavior of dialdiminate complexes. Aluminium and gallium complexes exhibit Lewis base&#8208;responsive emission, and aluminium enhances the responsiveness. The indium system encompasses ligand&#8208;exchange reactions in solution states, thus enabling us to alter the luminescence behavior dynamically. We also demonstrate their solid&#8208;state emissive properties involving aggregation&#8208; and crystallization&#8208;induced emission enhancement. More information can be found in the Research Article by K. Tanaka and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202300654).

         <dc:description>
Light, electricity, magnetism, and heat are manifestations of energy that are strongly interrelated and can be converted into each other under certain conditions. The molecular complex (C5NH13Cl)2MnBr4 shows a structural phase transition near room temperature that further induces the switchable magnetic properties, dielectric anomalies and fluorescent response over the same range of temperature. This is the first observation of the synergetic effect of magnetism, dielectricity and fluorescence near room temperature in a molecule, which well represents the strong interrelation between the light, electricity, magnetism, and heat.

Liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) are active soft matter&#8208;based materials with strong stimulus responsiveness and reversible, large&#8208;shape morphing capabilities. The actuation intelligence and advanced functionality of LCEs depend on the smartness and properties of structures. In this review, we discuss recent advances in structure&#8208;induced intelligence of LCEs, specifically the integration of structural properties with the alignment and processing of LCEs.







Abstract
Liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) are active soft matter&#8208;based materials with strong stimulus responsiveness and reversible, large&#8208;shape morphing capabilities. LCEs have demonstrated broad and growing applications in soft robotics, wearable devices, artificial muscles, and optical machines. The actuation intelligence and advanced functionality of LCEs depend on the smartness and properties of structures. In this review, we discuss recent advances in structure&#8208;induced intelligence of LCEs, specifically the integration of structural properties with the alignment and processing of LCEs. The structural design principles for three categories consisting of common structures (film, fiber, and tubule), smart structures (origami, kirigami, mechanical metamaterial, topology, and topography), and complex structures (monolithic and integrated) are presented. Various alignment controls of LCEs, including mechanical, surface, field&#8208;assisted, and shear alignment, are capable of inducing structural properties. The coupling and collaboration mechanisms of the LCE structures and the generated functions are discussed. The review concludes with perspectives on current challenges and emerging opportunities.

         <title>Impact of Faradaic Interlayer Confinement and Carbon&#8208;Centered Macrostructure Designs for Ion Capture and the Recovery of Elements</title>

In the context of desalination and renewable energy, several capacitive deionization processes and variables responsible for ion capture and the recovery of elements are reviewed.







Abstract
Environmental protection associated with renewable energy is among the most critical challenges for translational ion&#8208;capture based on capacitive storage of ions in electrical double layers at the interface of electrode and electrolyte. Electric double&#8208;layer capacitance with charge induction and faradaic pseudo&#8208;capacitance with charge transfer classifies the capacitance of the electrochemical interface. The electrochemical interface in most energy technologies involves porous and pseudocapacitive redox materials that offer varying degrees of electrolyte confinement. In this review, we discuss the factors affecting water desalination, such as the effect of nanopores for ion capture, the ion sieving effect, the effect of hydration energy, and hydration radius in the carbon sub&#8208;nanometer pore. Moreover, the surface phenomena of electrodes, including carbon corrosion, and the potential of zero charge to control the oxidation of carbon electrodes are explained along with protection mechanisms. The various capacitive deionization (CDI) operations and the corresponding electrochemical cell technologies are briefly introduced, including the significance of double&#8208;layer charging materials with faradaic intercalation, which suffer less from co&#8208;ion expulsion. Finally, we revisit the effects of various nanoarchitectures and the construction of capacitive deionization electrodes for clean water technology.

         <dc:description>
The carboxylative Buchwald&#8211;Hartwig amination is disclosed herein under mild conditions of temperature and under atmospheric pressure of CO2. The key to success is the use of a dual strategy organophotocatalysis/nickel catalysis under visible light irradiation. The developed conditions demonstrated high functional group tolerance toward (hetero)aryl iodide and bromide. Furthermore, preliminary mechanistic investigations including stoichiometric reactions and DFT calculations shed light on the reaction mechanism.







Abstract
Herein we disclosed an unprecedented photochemically driven nickel&#8208;catalyzed carboxylative Buchwald&#8211;Hartwig amination to access a wide range of aryl carbamate derivatives. This reaction is performed under mild condition of temperature and atmospheric pressure of CO2 starting from commercially available (hetero)aryl iodides/bromides derivatives and alkyl amines preventing the formation of hazardous and/or toxic waste. Moreover, preliminary mechanistic investigations including stochiometric experiments as well as DFT calculations allow us to shed light on the reaction mechanism.

         <title>First Example of 1,2,5&#8208;Oxadiazole&#8208;Based Hypergolic Ionic Liquids: A New Class of Potential Energetic Fuels</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Liquid energy: a novel type of promising thermally stable energetic fuels incorporating 1,2,5&#8208;oxadiazole ring and explosophoric anions is reported for the first time. Prepared materials have high nitrogen&#8208;oxygen content and high heats of explosion retaining low sensitivity to impact which enables their strong potential for various applications.







Abstract
The development of liquid energetic fuels with improved properties is an important topic in space propulsion technologies. In this manuscript, a series of energetic ionic liquids incorporating a 1,2,5&#8208;oxadiazole ring and nitrate, dicyanamide or dinitramide anion was synthesized and their physicochemical properties were evaluated. The synthesized compounds were fully characterized and were found to have good thermal stabilities (up to 219&#8201;&#176;C) and experimental densities (1.21&#8211;1.47&#8197;g&#8201;cm&#8722;3). Advantageously, 1,2,5&#8208;oxadiazole&#8208;based ionic liquids have high combined nitrogen&#8208;oxygen contents (up to 64.4&#8201;%), while their detonation velocities are on the level of known explosive TNT, and combustion performance exceeds those of benchmark 2&#8208;hydroxyethylhydrazinium nitrate. Considering the established hypergolicity with H2O2 in the presence of a catalyst, and insensitivity to impact, synthesized ionic liquids have strong application potential as energetic fuels for space technologies.

In this manuscript, a series of energetic ionic liquids incorporating a 1,2,5-oxadiazole ring and nitrate, dicyanamide or dinitramide anion was synthesized and their physicochemical properties were evaluated. The synthesized compounds were fully characterized and were found to have good thermal stabilities (up to 219&#8201;&#176;C) and experimental densities (1.21&#8211;1.47&#8197;g&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;). Advantageously, 1,2,5-oxadiazole-based ionic liquids have high combined nitrogen-oxygen contents (up to 64.4&#8201;%), while their detonation velocities are on the level of known explosive TNT, and combustion performance exceeds those of benchmark 2-hydroxyethylhydrazinium nitrate. Considering the established hypergolicity with H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the presence of a catalyst, and insensitivity to impact, synthesized ionic liquids have strong application potential as energetic fuels for space technologies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Direction Switching and Self&#8208;Recovering Mechanochromic Luminescence of Anthracene&#8208;Modified o&#8208;Carboranes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanochromic luminescence of bis&#8208;o&#8208;carborane&#8208;anthracene triad is described. By introducing ethynylene spacers, the direction of luminescence wavelength shift was changed. Recrystallization of ground samples occur even at room temperature and then the self&#8208;recovery of emission color can be observed.







Abstract
Luminochromic behaviors regarding mechanochromic luminescence (MCL) of o&#8208;carborane&#8208;modified anthracene derivatives are reported. We have previously synthesized bis&#8208;o&#8208;carborane&#8208;substituted anthracene and found that its crystal polymorphs show dual&#8208;emission properties composed of excimer and charge transfer (CT) emission bands in the solid state. Initially, we observed the bathochromic MCL behavior from 1&#8201;a originating from emission mechanism alteration from dual emission to CT emission. By inserting the ethynylene spacers between anthracene and o&#8208;carboranes, compound 2 was obtained. Interestingly, 2 showed hypsochromic MCL originating from the emission mechanism alteration from CT to excimer emission. Furthermore, luminescent color of ground 1&#8201;a can be recovered to the initial state by allowing to stand at room temperature, meaning that self&#8208;recovery proceeds. Detailed analyses are described in this study.

         <title>Synthesis and Biological Evaluation of Simplified Ansellone Analogues with Lipophilic Side Chains as HIV Latency&#8208;Reversing Agents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structural simplification of ansellone A (1), which acts as an HIV latency&#8208;reversing agent (LRA), was investigated, and two analogues, 4&#8201;i and 4&#8201;j, showed HIV&#8208;latency&#8208;reversing activity comparable to compound 1.







Abstract
Structurally simplified analogues of ansellone A, in which the decalin skeleton is replaced with a lipophilic chain, were prepared and their HIV latency&#8208;reversing activities biologically evaluated. In particular, two analogues bearing ether and alkenyl side chains, respectively, showed comparable activities to that of ansellone A. Each of the simplified compounds was easily synthesized using Prins cyclisation chemistry.

The reactions of a beryllium(I) radical with E2Ph2 (E=S, Se, Te) and of a beryllole with HEPh (E=S, Se) yield the corresponding beryllium phenylchalcogenides, including the first structurally authenticated beryllium selenide and telluride complexes. Calculations show that their Be&#8722;E bonds are best described as ionic, with Coulombic forces accounting for 56&#8201;% of the attraction and orbital interactions dominated by the &#963; component.

         <title>Synthesis of Bisubstrate Analogues for RNA Methylation Studies using two Transition&#8208;Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two transition metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions are used to synthesize m6A RNA Methyltransferase bisubstrates. Our method involves copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed alkyne&#8208;azide iodo&#8208;cycloaddition (iCuAAC) followed by palladium&#8208;mediated cross&#8208;coupling to obtain bisubstrates containing a SAM analogue (ASAM) linked to adenosine, dinucleotide or pentamer mimicking the RNA substrate (Asub). Docking studies revealed stabilizing interactions between the triazole linker and the enzyme.







Abstract
RNA methyltransferases (RNA MTases) are a family of enzymes that catalyze the methylation of RNA using the cofactor S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;L&#8208;methionine. While RNA MTases are promising drug targets, new molecules are needed to fully understand their roles in disease and to develop effective drugs that can modulate their activity. Since RNA MTases are suitable for bisubstrate binding, we report an original strategy for the synthesis of a new family of m6A MTases bisubstrate analogues. Six compounds containing a S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;L&#8208;methionine (SAM) analogue unit covalently tethered by a triazole ring to the N&#8208;6 position of an adenosine were synthesized. A procedure using two transition&#8208;metal&#8208;catalyzed reactions was used to introduce the &#945;&#8208;amino acid motif mimicking the methionine chain of the cofactor SAM. First, a copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed alkyne&#8208;azide iodo&#8208;cycloaddition (iCuAAC) reaction afforded the 5&#8208;iodo&#8208;1,4&#8208;disubstituted&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazole which was functionalized by palladium&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling to connect the &#945;&#8208;amino acid substituent. Docking studies of our molecules in the active site of the m6A ribosomal MTase RlmJ show that the use of triazole as a linker provides additional interactions and the presence of the &#945;&#8208;amino acid chain stabilizes the bisubstrate. The synthetic method developed here enhances the structural diversity of bisubstrate analogues to explore the active site of RNA modification enzymes and to develop new inhibitors.

         <title>Lanthanide Functionalized Covalent Organic Frameworks Hybrid Materials for Luminescence Responsive Chemical Sensing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lanthanide functionalized covalent organic frameworks (COFs) hybrid materials embody the abundant multiple luminescence response with cooperative emission with energy transfer and discrete one without energy transfer. The summary is focused on the lanthanide functionalized COFs hybrid materials and the relevant systems for luminescence responsive chemical sensing.







Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) possess several unique features of structural and functional chemistry, together with other modular photophysical performance, which make them candidates for luminescence responsive chemical sensing. Lanthanide (Ln3+) functionalized COFs hybrid materials still keep the parent COFs&#8217; virtues and also embody the abundant multiple luminescence response with both COFs and Ln3+ ions or other guest species. In this review, the summary is highlighted on the lanthanide functionalized COFs hybrid materials and their relevant systems for luminescence responsive chemical sensing. It is subdivided into five sections involving the three main topics. Firstly, the basic knowledges of COFs materials related to the luminescence responsive chemical sensing are introduced (including three sections), involving the chemistry, application and post&#8208;synthetic modification (PSM) of COFs, the luminescence and luminescence responsive chemical sensing, and the luminescence responsive chemical sensing of non&#8208;lanthanide functionalized COFs hybrids materials. Secondly, the systematic progresses are outlined on the lanthanide functionalized COFs hybrid materials in luminescence responsive chemical sensing, which is the emphasis for this review. Finally, the conclusion and prospect are given.

Lanthanide (Ln&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;) functionalized COFs hybrid materials still keep the parent COFs&#8217; virtues and also embody the abundant multiple luminescence response with both COFs and Ln&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ions or other guest species. In this review, the summary is highlighted on the lanthanide functionalized COFs hybrid materials and their relevant systems for luminescence responsive chemical sensing. It is subdivided into five sections involving the three main topics. Firstly, the basic knowledges of COFs materials related to the luminescence responsive chemical sensing are introduced (including three sections), involving the chemistry, application and post-synthetic modification (PSM) of COFs, the luminescence and luminescence responsive chemical sensing, and the luminescence responsive chemical sensing of non-lanthanide functionalized COFs hybrids materials. Secondly, the systematic progresses are outlined on the lanthanide functionalized COFs hybrid materials in luminescence responsive chemical sensing, which is the emphasis for this review. Finally, the conclusion and prospect are given.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Spin Crossover and Fluorine&#8208;Specific Interactions in Metal Complexes of Terpyridines with Polyfluorocarbon Tails</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Iron(II) and cobalt(II) complexes with terpyridine ligands containing PFC tails are reported. All complexes are redox rich. The cobalt(II) complexes display spin crossover, and the magnetic properties in those cases are dependent on the length of the PFC tail. Fluorine&#8208;specific interactions are observed between the PFC tails, and this effect translates into exchange narrowing of the corresponding EPR spectra of the cobalt complexes.







Abstract
In coordination chemistry and materials science, terpyridine ligands are of great interest, due to their ability to form stable complexes with a broad range of transition metal ions. We report three terpyridine ligands containing different perfluorocarbon (PFC) tails on the backbone and the corresponding FeII and CoII complexes. The CoII complexes display spin crossover close to ambient temperature, and the nature of this spin transition is influenced by the length of the PFC tail on the ligand backbone. The electrochemical properties of the metal complexes were investigated with cyclic voltammetry revealing one oxidation and several reduction processes. The fluorine&#8208;specific interactions were investigated by EPR measurements. Analysis of the EPR spectra of the complexes as microcrystalline powders and in solution reveals exchange&#8208;narrowed spectra without resolved hyperfine splittings arising from the 59Co nucleus; this suggests complex aggregation in solution mediated by interactions of the PFC tails. Interestingly, addition of perfluoro&#8208;octanol in different ratios to the acetonitrile solution of the sample resulted in the disruption of the F
F interactions of the tails. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first investigation of fluorine&#8208;specific interactions in metal complexes through EPR spectroscopy, as exemplified by exchange narrowing.

         <title>Oxidative NHC Catalysis: An Unconventional Tool for Macrocyclic Oligoesters Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Macrocyclic oligoesters (MCOs) are synthesized through N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalysis under highly diluted oxidative condition, starting from commercial dialdehydes and diols, avoiding the use of toxic acyl chlorides. The protocol versatility is confirmed by the employment of fossil&#8208;based and bio&#8208;based monomers, synthesizing a series of synthetically relevant macrocyclic oligoesters, fully characterized by NMR and MALDI&#8208;TOF MS analysis.







Abstract
The application of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalysis under highly diluted oxidative condition to the polycondensation of dialdehydes and diols is herein presented as an alternative, atom&#8208;economical synthetic route to macrocyclic oligoesters (MCOs). The disclosed protocol paves the way to the straightforward access to MCOs, starting from commercial dialdehydes, avoiding the use of toxic diacyl chlorides, commonly employed in traditional MCOs synthetic processes. The method is totally metal&#8208;free, takes place in the green Me&#8208;THF solvent and requires the use of a fully recyclable quinone oxidant. The protocol versatility is confirmed by the employment of fossil&#8208;based and bio&#8208;based monomers such as 2,5&#8208;diformylfuran (DFF), 2,5&#8208;bis(hydroxymethyl)furan (BHMF), and isomannide, synthesizing a series of novel and known synthetically relevant macrocyclic oligoesters, fully characterized by NMR and MALDI&#8208;TOF MS analysis, with product yields (51&#8211;86&#8201;%) comparable to those obtained by traditional synthetic routes. Finally, to emphasize the synthetic relevance of the target macrocycles, an entropically&#8208;driven ring opening polymerization (ED&#8208;ROP) key study has been performed, optimizing the organocatalyzed synthesis of poly(2,5&#8208;furan&#8208;dimethylene 2,5 furandicarboxylate) (PBHMF) with number&#8208;average molecular weight up to 8200&#8197;g mol&#8722;1 and 66&#8201;% isolated yield.

         <title>Synthesis of Neuraminidase&#8208;Resistant Sialyllactose Mimetics from N&#8208;Acyl Mannosamines using Metabolically Engineered Escherichia coli</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sialyllactose mimetics showing lectin affinity but resistant to neuraminidase hydrolysis were produced on a gram scale from N&#8208;acyl&#8208;mannosamines using metabolically engineered E. coli cells.







Abstract
Herein, we describe the efficient gram&#8208;scale synthesis of &#945;2,3&#8208; and &#945;2,6&#8208;sialyllactose oligosaccharides as well as mimetics from N&#8208;acyl mannosamines and lactose in metabolically engineered bacterial cells grown at high cell density. We designed new Escherichia coli strains co&#8208;expressing sialic acid synthase and N&#8208;acylneuraminate cytidylyltransferase from Campylobacter jejuni together with the &#945;2,3&#8208;sialyltransferase from Neisseria meningitidis or the &#945;2,6&#8208;sialyltransferase from Photobacterium sp. JT&#8208;ISH&#8208;224. Using their mannose transporter, these new strains actively internalized N&#8208;acetylmannosamine (ManNAc) and its N&#8208;propanoyl (N&#8208;Prop), N&#8208;butanoyl (N&#8208;But) and N&#8208;phenylacetyl (N&#8208;PhAc) analogs and converted them into the corresponding sialylated oligosaccharides, with overall yields between 10&#8201;% and 39&#8201;% (200&#8208;700&#8197;mg.L&#8722;1 of culture). The three &#945;2,6&#8208;sialyllactose analogs showed similar binding affinity for Sambucus nigra SNA&#8722;I lectin as for the natural oligosaccharide. They also proved to be stable competitive inhibitors of Vibrio cholerae neuraminidase. These N&#8208;acyl sialosides therefore hold promise for the development of anti&#8208;adhesion therapy against influenza viral infections.

         <title>Critical Issues of Vanadium&#8208;Based Cathodes Towards Practical Aqueous Zn&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) are gaining significant attention for their numerous advantages, including high safety, high energy density, affordability, and environmental friendliness. However, the development of ZIBs has been hampered by the lack of suitable cathode materials that can store Zn2+&#160;with high capacity and reversibility. Currently, vanadium&#8208;based materials with tunnel or layered structures are widely researched owing to their high theoretical capacity and diversified structures. However, their long&#8208;term cycling stability is unsatisfactory because of material dissolution, phase transformation, and restrictive kinetics in aqueous electrolytes, which limits their practical applications. Different from previous reviews on ZIBs, this review specifically addresses the critical issues faced by vanadium&#8208;based cathodes for practical aqueous ZIBs and proposes potential solutions. Focusing on vanadium&#8208;based cathodes, their ion storage mechanisms, the critical parameters affecting their performance, and the progress made in addressing the aforementioned problems are also summarized. Finally, future directions for the development of practical aqueous ZIB are suggested.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The crotylation reactions of chiral &#945;&#8208;F, &#945;&#8208;OBz and &#945;&#8208;OH aldehydes under Petasis&#8208;borono&#8208;Mannich conditions using (E)&#8208; or (Z)&#8208;crotylboronates and primary amines resulted in &#947;&#8208;addition products in high dr and high er. &#945;&#8208;F and &#945;&#8208;OBz aldehydes gave 1,2&#8208;anti&#8208;2,3&#8208;syn and 1,2&#8208;anti&#8208;2,3&#8208;anti, products, respectively while an &#945;&#8208;OH aldehyde gave 1,2&#8208;syn&#8208;2,3&#8208;syn products. The stereochemical outcomes of reactions of the former aldehydes can be explained using a six&#8208;membered ring transition state (TS) model in which a Cornforth&#8208;like conformation around the imine intermediate is favoured resulting in 1,2&#8208;anti products. The 2,3&#8208;stereochemical outcome is dependent upon the geometry of the crotylboronate. These TS models were also supported by DFT calculations. The stereochemical outcomes of reactions employing an &#945;&#8208;OH aldehyde can be rationalised as occurring via an open&#8208;TS involving H&#8208;bonding in the imine intermediate between the &#945;&#8208;OH group and the imine N atom. Representative products were converted to highly functionalized 1,2,3,6&#8208;tetrahydropyridines and 3H&#8208;oxazolo[3,4&#8208;a]pyridine&#8208;3&#8208;ones which will be valuable scaffolds in synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Tetra&#8208;Face&#8208;Capped Octahedra in a Tetrahedra Network &#8211; Structure Determination and Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy of SrAl5P4N10O2F3</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tetrahedra&#8208;based nitridophosphates show a rich structural chemistry, which can be further extended by incorporating cations in higher coordinated positions, e.g., in octahedral voids or by substituting the nitrogen atoms in the network with other anions. Following this approach, SrAl5P4N10O2F3 was synthesized at high&#8208;temperature and high&#8208;pressure conditions using a multianvil press (1400 &#176;C, 5 GPa) starting from Sr(N3)2, c&#8208;PON, P3N5, AlN, and NH4F. SrAl5P4N10O2F3 crystallizes in space group I[[EQUATION]]m2 with a = 11.1685(2) and c = 7.84850(10) &#197;. Atomic&#8208;resolution EDX mapping with scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) indicates atom assignments, which are further corroborated by bond&#8208;valence sum (BVS) calculations. Ten Al3+&#8208;centered octahedra form a highly condensed tetra&#8208;face&#8208;capped octahedra&#8208;based unit that is a novel structure motif in network compounds. A network of vertex&#8208;sharing PN4 tetrahedra and chains of face&#8208;sharing Sr2+&#8208;centered cuboctahedra complement the structure. Eu2+&#8208;doped SrAl5P4N10O2F3 shows blue emission (&#955;em = 469 nm, fwhm = 98 nm; 4504 cm&#8211;1) when irradiated with UV light.</dc:description>

         <title>Neighboring&#8208;group Participation by C&#8208;2 Acyloxy Groups:&#160; Influence of the Nucleophile and Acyl Group on the Stereochemical Outcome of Acetal Substitution Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A single acyloxy group at C&#8208;2 can control the outcome of nucleophilic substitution reactions of pyran&#8208;derived acetals, but the extent of the neighboring&#8208;group participation depends on a number of factors. We show here that neighboring&#8208;group participation does not necessarily control the stereochemical outcome of acetal substitution reactions with weak nucleophiles. The 1,2&#8208;trans selectivity increased with increasing reactivity of the incoming nucleophile. This trend suggests the intermediacy of both cis&#8208;fused dioxolenium ions and oxocarbenium ions in the stereochemistry&#8208;determining step. In addition, as the electron&#8208;donating ability of the neighboring group decreased, the preference for the 1,2&#8208;trans products increased. Computational studies show how the barriers for the ring&#8208;opening reaction on the dioxolenium ions and the transition states to provide the oxocarbenium ions change with the electron&#8208;donating capacity of the C&#8208;2&#8208;acyl group and the reactivity of the nucleophile.</dc:description>

         <title>Trityl&#8208;Based Lanthanide&#8208;Supramolecular Assemblies Exhibiting Slow Magnetic Relaxation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Triphenylmethane (trityl) group has been recognized as a supramolecular synthon in crystal engineering, molecular machine rotors and stereochemical chirality inductors in materials science. Herein we demonstrate for the first time how it can be utilized in the domain of molecular magnetic materials through shaping of single molecule magnet (SMM) properties within the lanthanide complexes in tandem with other non&#8208;covalent interactions. Trityl&#8208;appended mono&#8208; (HL1) and bis&#8208;compartmental (HL2) hydrazone ligands were synthesized and complexated with Dy(III) and Er(III) triflate and nitrate salts to generate four monometallic (1&#8208;4) and two bimetallic (5, 6) complexes. The static and dynamic magnetic properties of 1&#8211;6 were investigated, revealing that only ligand HL1 induces assemblies (1&#8208;4) capable of showing SMM behaviour, with Dy(III) congeners (1, 2) able to exhibit the phenomenon also under zero field conditions. Theoretical ab initio studies helped in determination of Dy(III) energetic levels, magnetic anisotropic axes and corroborated magnetic relaxation mechanisms to be a combination of Raman and quantum tunnelling in zero dc field, the latter being cancelled in the optimum non&#8208;zero dc field. Our work represents the first study of magneto&#8208;structural correlations within the trityl Ln&#8208;SMMs, leading to generation of slowly relaxing zero&#8208;field dysprosium complexes within the hydrogen bonded assemblies.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Coordination&#8208;Mediated H&#8208;Aggregates of Cyanine Dyes for Effective Photothermal Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Integration of cyanine dyes and metal ions into one nanoplatform via metal&#8208;coordination interactions is an effective strategy to build multimodality phototheranostics. The multifunctionalities of the formed nanoscale metal&#8208;organic particles (NMOPs) have been widely explored. However, the effect of metal&#8208;coordination interaction on the aggregation behavior of cyanine dyes is rarely reported. Herein, we reported the H&#8208;aggregation behavior of cyanine dye Cy&#8208;3COOH induced by different metal ions M (Fe2+ or Mn2+). Moreover, the extent of H&#8208;aggregates varied with different metal&#8208;coordination interactions. Upon NIR irradiation, H&#8208;aggregates of Cy&#8208;3COOH remarkably promoted photothermal conversion efficiency. Interestingly, we also find that H&#8208;aggregates of Cy&#8208;3COOH induced by metal ions can generate the reactive oxygen species (ROS) involving singlet oxygen (1O2) and superoxide anion radical (O2&#8208;&#183;) upon light irradiation. And the ROS efficiency varies depending on the extent of H&#8208;aggregates. Additionally, the photoinduced ROS could disassemble aggregates and decompose cyanine dye Cy&#8208;3COOH, which limits the photothermal capability of Cy&#8208;3COOH/M NPs. Therefore, the photothermal performance of Cy&#8208;3COOH/M NPs could be manipulated by the degree of H&#8208;aggregation. This would provide a new insight to develop efficient phototheranostics NMOPs for cancer treatment.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A site&#8208;selective C(3)/C(4)&#8208;alkylation of N&#8208;pyridylisoquinolones is achieved by employing C&#8208;C bond activation of cyclopropanols under a Ru(II)&#8208;catalyzed/ Cu(II)&#8208;mediated condition. The regioisomeric ratios of the products follow directly from the electronic nature of the cyclopropanols and isoquinolones used, with electron&#8208;withdrawing groups yielding predominantly the C(3)&#8208;alkylated products, while the electron&#8208;donating groups primarily generate the C(4)&#8722;alkylated isomers. Density functional theory calculations and detailed mechanistic investigations suggest the simultaneous existence of the singlet and triplet states for the C(3) and C(4)&#8722;product formation. This subsequently reinforces the role of energetics in dictating the observed regioselectivity. Further transformations of the products evolve the utility of the methodology thereby yielding scaffolds of synthetic relevance.</dc:description>

         <title>Promoting Surface Reconstruction of Low&#8208;Cost Stainless Steel Catalyst for Efficient Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a simple and reasonable method to convert inexpensive 434&#8208;L SS (stainless steel) into cost&#8208;effective and stable electrodes by corrosion and sulfidation strategies. Systematic characterization shows that sulfidization treatment is beneficial to improve the oxygen evolution reaction activity of stainless steel&#8208;based catalysts, and provides an effective method to the design cheap and robust catalysts.







Abstract
The development of cost&#8208;effective transition metal catalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is critical for the production of hydrogen fuel from water splitting. Low&#8208;cost and efficient stainless steel&#8208;based catalysts are expected to replace the scarce platinum group metals for large&#8208;scale energy applications. Here in this work, we report the conversion of commonly available inexpensive and easily accessible 434&#8208;L stainless steel (SS) into highly active and stable electrodes by corrosion and sulfuration strategies. The NixFe1&#8722;xS layer as a pre&#8208;catalyst and S&#8208;doped NixFe oxyhydroxides in&#8197;situ formed on the catalyst surface are the true active species for OER. The optimized 434&#8208;L stainless steel&#8208;based electrocatalyst exhibits a low overpotential of 298&#8197;mV at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in 1.0&#8197;M KOH with a small OER kinetics (the Tafel slope of 54.8&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1) and good stability. This work reveals the 434&#8208;L alloy stainless steel with Fe and Cr as the main elements can be used as qualified OER catalysts by surface modification, along with a new mentality to solve the energy and resource waste problems.

         <title>Sulfur Dioxide Oxidation by Zinc and Zinc Oxide Nitrate/Nitrite Complexes in the Gas Phase: An Interplay between Redox&#8208;Active Ligands and Metal</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ready for oxidation. Sulfur dioxide has been prepared for fast and efficient intracomplex oxidation by oxygen ion transfer from a [Zn2+&#8208;O&#8901;&#8722;]+ core or by electron transfer from the low&#8208;valence Zn+ of zinc and zinc oxide nitrate/nitrite complexes. The nitrogen oxyanionic ligands continue the process, forming sulfate or sulfite as the ending oxidation products.







Abstract
Different oxidative pathways of sulfur dioxide promoted by ZnO(NO3)2&#8722;, Zn(NO3)2&#8722; and Zn(NO2)(NO3)&#8722; are revealed by a joint investigation by mass spectrometry and theoretical calculations. The reactions are triggered by [Zn2+&#8208;O&#8722;&#8901;]+ or by the low&#8208;valence Zn+ through oxygen ion transfer or electron transfer to SO2, respectively. The NOx&#8722; ligands intervene in the oxidation only when sulfur dioxide is converted to SO3&#8722; or SO2&#8722;, leading to the formation of zinc sulfate and zinc sulfite coordinated to nitrate or nitrite anions. Kinetic analyses show that the reactions are fast and efficient, and theory discloses the elementary steps, namely oxygen ion transfer, oxygen atom transfer and electron transfer, occurring through similar energy landscapes for the three reactive anions.

         <title>Photochemically Mediated Toluene Oxidation through a Copper Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Under ambient conditions, toluene can be oxidized selectively to benzaldehyde, an essential compound in the chemical industry. Copper(I) complexes were applied in combination with [Ru(bipy)3](PF6)2 and dioxygen as the oxidant. A peroxido copper complex is formed as the active species. The copper(II) complex obtained after oxidation can be photochemically reduced to the starting copper(I) species, and the process can be repeated. More information can be found in the Research Article by C. No&#223;, R. G&#246;ttlich, and S. Schindler (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202301142).

A diastereomeric mixture of antlers (compounds (SP)&#8208;9 and (RP)&#8208;9) cannot be separated while attached to the deer. In winter, however, the deer will lose the single antler&#8208;diastereomers, and they can be resolved and collected to provide a robust starting material for (chiral) tools, like spears, axes or homogeneous catalysts. Note the useful enantiomerically pure (&#8722;)&#8208;menthol&#8208;containing food (Mentha arvensis) available for the deer. More information can be found in the Research Article by E. Hey&#8208;Hawkins and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202300790). Cover designed by Dr. Christoph Selg.

         <title>Merger of Rotation Restriction and Symmetrical Push&#8208;Pull to Synthesize Single&#8208;Benzene Yellow Fluorophors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cover shows a series of our single&#8208;benzene fluorophores. Constructing symmetrical push&#8208;pull motifs in combination with restricting bond rotations to suppress molecular motions that cause nonradiative transitions is the key to creating small, yet brightly emitting, fluorophores. The tetrahydrobenzodifuran moiety has proven to be an effective core architecture to realize single&#8208;benzene yellow fluorophores. More information can be found in the Research Article by Y. Okada and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202301411).

         <title>Strong Chiroptical Effects in the Absorption and Emission of Macrocycles Based on the 2,5&#8208;Diaminoterephthalate Minimal Fluorophore</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral macrocycles composed of dimethyl 2,5&#8208;diaminoterephthalate units (n = 2&#8211;4) can be synthesised in a simple one&#8208;pot reaction. All products exhibit fluorescence in solution and in the solid state that is dependent on the size of the macrocyclic ring&#8212;the smaller the macrocycle, the longer the emission wavelength. The macrocycles show strong chiroptical activity, with the trimer showing particularly high dissymmetry factors in ECD and CPL spectra. More information can be found in the Research Article by M. G&#243;recki, M. Grzybowski and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202300932).

         <title>Temperature Directs the Majority&#8208;Rules Principle in Supramolecular Copolymers Driven by Triazine&#8211;Benzene Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular copolymers have typically been studied in the extreme cases, such as self&#8208;sorting or highly mixed copolymer systems, while the intermediate systems have been less understood. We have reported the temperature&#8208;dependent microstructure in copolymers of triazine&#8208; and benzene&#8208;derivatives based on charge&#8208;transfer interactions with a highly alternating microstructure at low temperatures. Here, we investigate the temperature&#8208;dependent copolymerization further and increase the complexity by combining triazine&#8208; and benzene&#8208;derivatives with opposite preferred helicities. In this case, intercalation of the benzene&#8208;derivative into the triazine&#8208;derivative assemblies causes a helical inversion. The inversion of the net helicity was rationalized by comparing the mismatch penalties of the individual monomers, which indicated that the benzene&#8208;derivative dictates the helical screw&#8208;sense of the supramolecular copolymers. Surprisingly, this was not reflected in further investigations of slightly modified triazine&#8208; and benzene&#8208;derivatives, thus highlighting that the outcome is a subtle balance between structural features, where small differences can be amplified due to the competitive nature of the interactions. Overall, these findings suggest that the temperature&#8208;dependent microstructure of triazine&#8208; and benzene&#8208;based supramolecular copolymers determines the copolymer helicity of the presented system in a similar way as the mixed majority&#8208;rules phenomenon.</dc:description>

         <title>Identification of In&#8208;droplet Multicellular Communities by Light&#8208;induced Combinatorial DNA Barcoding</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Microdroplet co&#8208;culture system is useful for the parallel assessment of numerous possible cell&#8208;cell interactions by generating isolated subcommunities from a pool of heterogeneous cells. However, the integration of single&#8208;cell sequencing into such analysis has been limited due to the lack of effective molecular identifiers for each in&#8208;droplet subcommunity. Here, we present a strategy for generating in&#8208;droplet subcommunity identifiers using DNA&#8208;functionalized microparticles encapsulated within microdroplets. These microparticles serve as initial information carriers, where their combinations act as distinct identifiers for in&#8208;droplet subcommunity. Upon optical trigger, DNA barcoding molecules encoding the microparticle information are once released in the microdroplets and then tag cell membranes. The tagged DNA molecules then serves as a second information carrier readable by single&#8208;cell sequencing to reconstitute the community&#160;in silico&#160;in single&#8208;cell RNA sequencing data space.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent advances of unexcited light source imaging for biomedical applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Optical imaging has a wide range of applications in the biomedical field, allowing the visualizsation of physiological processes and helping in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases. Unexcited light source imaging technologies,such as chemiluminescence imaging, bioluminescence imaging and afterglow imaging have attracted great attention in recent years because of the absence of excitation light interference in their application and the advantages of high sensitivity and high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio. In this review, the latest advances in unexcited light source imaging technology for biomedical applications are highlighted. The design strategies of unexcited light source luminescent probes in improving luminescence brightness, penetration depth, quantum yield and targeting, and their applications in inflammation imaging, tumor imaging, liver and kidney injury imaging and bacterial infection imaging are introduced in detail. The research progress and future prospects of unexcited light source imaging for medical applications are further discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Far&#8208;Red Excitation Induced Electron Transfer in Bis Donor&#8208;AzaBODIPY Push&#8208;Pull Systems; Role of Nitrogenous Donors in Promoting Charge Separation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A far&#8208;red absorbing sensitizer, BF2&#8208;chelated azadipyrromethane (azaBODIPY) has been employed as an electron acceptor to synthesize a series of push&#8208;pull systems&#160;linked with a series of nitrogenous electron donors, viz., N,N&#8208;dimethylaniline, triphenylamine, and phenothiazine via an acetylene linker. The structural integrity of the newly synthesized triads was established by spectroscopic, electrochemical, spectroelectrochemical, and DFT methods.

         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A far-red absorbing sensitizer, BF2-chelated azadipyrromethane (azaBODIPY) has been employed as an electron acceptor to synthesize a series of push-pull systems&#160;linked with a series of nitrogenous electron donors, viz., N,N-dimethylaniline, triphenylamine, and phenothiazine via an acetylene linker. The structural integrity of the newly synthesized triads was established by spectroscopic, electrochemical, spectroelectrochemical, and DFT methods.

         <title>Hydration Rearrangement in the 4&#8208;Aminobenzonitrile&#8722;(H2O)2 Cluster Induced by Photoionization: The Effect of Solvent&#8208;Solvent Interactions</title>

         <dc:description>
Hydration dynamics and the role of water&#8208;water interaction at the single&#8208;molecule level. Excess energy dependence of IR spectra of the isolated 4&#8208;aminobenzonitrile&#8722;(H2O)2 cluster reveals that photoionization initiates the migration of an intact water dimer from the CN site to the NH site.







Abstract
The interplay between solute&#8208;solvent and solvent&#8208;solvent interactions plays an essential role in solvation dynamics that has important effects on the mechanism and dynamics of chemical reactions in solution. In this study, the rearrangement of the hydration shell induced by photoionization of a solute molecule is probed in a state&#8208; and isomer&#8208;specific manner by resonant multiphoton ionization detected IR spectroscopy of the prototypical 4&#8208;aminobenzonitrile&#8722;(H2O)2 cluster produced in a molecular beam. IR spectra reveal that the water molecules form a cyclic solvent network around the CN group in the initial neutral state (S0). Different from the singly&#8208;hydrated cluster, in which either the CN or the NH2 group is hydrated, hydration of the NH2 group is not observed in the dihydrated cluster. IR spectra obtained after ionizing the solute molecule into the cation ground state (D0) exhibit features ascribed to both NH&#8208;bound and CN&#8208;bound isomers, indicating that water molecules migrate from the CN to the NH site upon ionization with a yield depending on the ionization excess energy. Analysis of the IR spectra as a function of the excess energy shows that migration produces two different NH2 solvated structures, namely (i) the most stable structure in which both N&#8722;H bonds are singly hydrated and (ii) the second most stable isomer in which one of the N&#8722;H bonds is hydrated by a H&#8208;bonded (H2O)2 dimer. The product branching ratio of the two isomers depends on the excess energy. The role of the water&#8208;water interaction in the hydration rearrangement is discussed based on the potential energy landscape. Solvation dynamics plays an important role in reaction mechanisms in the condensed phase, where not only solute&#8208;solvent solvation but also solvent&#8208;solvent interactions have a significant influence on the dynamics. Thus, the investigation of solvation dynamics at the molecular level substantially contributes to our understanding of the reaction mechanism. In this study, the dihydrated cluster of 4ABN was utilized as a model for the first solvation layer to elucidate solvent motions induced by ionization of the solute and the role of W&#8722;W interactions for the solvent relaxation.

         <title>Diverse Reactions of &#945;&#8208;Diimine&#8208;Ligated MgI&#8722;MgI&#8208;Bonded Compound with Carbodiimides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diverse reaction types: Reactions of dimagnesium(I) [LMg&#8722;MgL] (L=&#945;&#8208;diimine) with carbodiimides proceed via four pathways: 1) Release of one Me3Si of Me3SiNCNSiMe3 to yield either bridging or mononuclear complexes; 2) N=C=N insertion into the Mg&#8722;Mg bond; 3) coupling of two carbodiimides; and 4) double insertion of carbodiimides into a Mg&#8722;C bond to form an alkyne&#8208;bridged bis(amidinate) [(NCy)2C&#8722;C&#8801;C&#8722;C(NCy)2]2&#8722;.







Abstract
The &#945;&#8208;diimine&#8208;ligated dimagnesium(I) compound [K(thf)3]2[LMg&#8722;MgL] (1, L=[(2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3)NC(Me)]22&#8722;) displays diverse reactivities toward carbodiimides (RN=C=NR) with different R substituents. In the reaction of 1 with Me3SiNCNSiMe3, one of the easily leaving trimethylsilyl groups is lost to yield the Me3SiNCN&#8722; moiety that either bridges two MgII centers (2) or terminally coordinated (3). In contrast, with the similarly bulky tBuNCNtBu, the carbodiimide inserts into Mg&#8722;Mg bond with accompanying C&#8722;H activation of a ligand or solvent (products 4 and 5). In the case of dicyclohexyl or diisopropyl carbodiimide, reductive C&#8722;C coupling of two RNCNR molecules occurs to form the [C2(NR)4]2&#8722; diamido moiety, which bridges two Mg centers, giving complexes [{K(dme)2}2LMg(&#956;&#8208;{C2(NR)4})MgL] (6, R=Cy; 7, R=iPr) and [L&#8901;&#8722;Mg(&#956;&#8208;{C2(NR)4})MgL&#8901;&#8722;] (8). Most interestingly, upon treating 1 with Me3SiC&#8801;CSiMe3, the acetylide complex [K(dme)][LMg(C&#8801;CSiMe3)(dme)] (9) was prepared, which undergoes a rare &#8220;double insertion&#8221; with CyNCNCy to afford [K(solv)][K(dme)2LMg(NCy)2C&#8722;C&#8801;C&#8722;C(NCy)2MgL] (10) containing an acetylenediide&#8208;coupled bis(amidinate) ligand that bridges two Mg atoms.

         <dc:description>Films exhibiting nanoporous&#8208;crystalline (NC) phases of poly(2,6&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;phenylene) oxide (PPO), which are highly effective to absorb apolar organic guest molecules, are also able to absorb polar molecules (like alcohols and carboxylic acids) but only from concentrated organic solutions. NC PPO films, which do not absorb alcohols and carboxylic acids from diluted aqueous solutions, exhibits a huge uptake (even above 30wt%) of benzyl alcohol (BAL) and benzoic acid (BA), if BA is obtained by spontaneous room temperature oxidation of BAL in aqueous solution. This phenomenon is rationalized by an easy uptake, mainly by the PPO intrahelical crystalline empty channels, of a BAL/BA 1/1 hydrogen&#8208;bonded dimer. This huge uptake of BAL/BA dimer by NC PPO films, which is also fast for films exhibiting the orientation of the crystalline helices perpendicular to the film plane (c^ orientation), can be exploited for purification of water from BAL, when present in traces.

         <title>5,10,15,20&#8208;Tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)porphyrin as Functional Platform for Peptide Stapling and Multicyclisation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Polyfluorinated aromatic reagents readily react with thiolates&#160;via&#160;nucleophilic aromatic substitution (SNAr) and provide excellent scaffolds for peptide cyclisation. Here we report a robust and versatile platform for peptide stapling and multicyclisation templated by&#160;5,10,15,20&#8208;tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)porphyrin, opening the door to the next generation of functional scaffolds for 3D peptide architectures. We demonstrate that stapling and multicyclisation occurs with a range of non&#8208;protected peptides under peptide&#8208;compatible conditions, exhibiting chemoselectivity and wide&#8208;applicability. Peptides containing two cysteine residues are readily stapled, and the remaining perfluoroaryl groups permit the introduction of a second peptide in a modular fashion to access bicyclic peptides. Similarly, peptides with more than two cysteine residues can afford multicyclic products containing up to three peptide &#8216;loops&#8217;.&#160;Finally, we demonstrate that a porphyrin&#8208;templated stapled peptide containing the Skin Penetrating and Cell Entering (SPACE) peptide affords a skin cell penetrating conjugate with intrinsic fluorescence.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The introduction of fluorinated moieties into drugs as well as the increase of their overall three&#8208;dimensionality have become key strategies amongst medicinal chemists to generate sets of compounds with favorable drug&#8208;like properties. However, the introduction of fluorinated cyclopropane ring systems which combines both strategies is not widely exploited to date. This paper reports synthetic strategies exploiting the reactivity of gem&#8208;difluorocyclopropenes in dipolar cycloaddition reactions with azomethine ylides to afford sets of new fluorine&#8208;containing 3&#8208;azabicyclo[3.1.0]hexanes. In addition, the unexpected formation of complex trifluorinated scaffolds arising from proline esters and gem&#8208;difluorocyclopropenes is highlighted along with computational studies to elucidate the underlying mechanism. This study presents new avenues towards pharmaceutically relevant fluorinated 3&#8208;azabicyclo[3.1.0]hexanes that are accessible via robust and short synthetic sequences.</dc:description>

         <title>N&#8208;Oxides as Control Element for the Direction of a Sigmatropic Rearrangement. Application as a Switch for Fluorescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An exceptional level of control over the direction of the (2,3)&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangement between N&#8208;oxides and alkoxylamine is achieved by simply changing the solvent in which they are dissolved. Protic solvents like water, methanol and hexafluoroisopropanol favor the N&#8208;oxide form, while other solvents like acetone, acetonitrile and benzene favor the alkoxylamine. The reaction temperature and nature of the substituents on the alkene affect the rate of rearrangement. A N&#8208;oxide fragment was attached to two fluorescent molecules and acted as an on/off switch for their fluorescence. The conversion of alkoxylamines into the corresponding N&#8208;oxides has not previously been described and is here termed the &#8216;Reverse Meisenheimer Rearrangement&#8217;.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Functionalized triose&#8208;, furanose and chromane&#8208;derivatives were synthesized by the titled reactions. The sugar&#8208;assisted kinetic resolution/C&#8208;C bond&#8208;forming cascade processes generate a functionalized sugar derivative with a quaternary stereocenter in a highly enantioselective fashion (up to &gt;99% ee) by using a simple combination of metal and chiral amine co&#8208;catalysts. Notably, the interplay between the chiral sugar substrate and the chiral amino acid derivative allowed for the construction of a functionalized sugar product with high enantioselectivity (up to 99%) also when using a combination of racemic amine catalyst (0% ee) and metal catalyst.</dc:description>

While the axial ligands do not significantly affect the metal&#8208;metal bond lengths, the metallic chain has a significant impact on the iridium&#8208;L/X bond distances. The complexes show free rotation around the unsupported iridium&#8208;iridium bond in solution, with a low&#8208;energy transition state for the chloride chain. The absorption spectra of these complexes show characteristic bands at 438&#8208;504 nm, which can be fine&#8208;tuned by varying the terminal capping ligands.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Since the development of the first method for porphyrin synthesis by Rothemund in 1935, porphyrin derivatives have been widely investigated and have played an essential role in chemical sciences. Most synthetic routes of porphyrins involve oxidative aromatization.

         <title>Strong Be&#8208;&#8208;&#8208;N Interaction Induced Complementary Chemical Tuning to Design a Dual&#8208;gated Single Molecule Junction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The interaction between pyridines and the &#960;&#8208;hole of BeH2 leads to the formation of strong beryllium&#8208;bonded complexes. Theoretical investigations demonstrate that the Be&#8208;&#8208;&#8208;N bonding interaction can effectively regulate the electronic current through a molecular junction. The electronic conductance exhibits distinct switching behavior depending on the substituent groups at the para position of pyridine, highlighting the role of Be&#8208;&#8208;&#8208;N interaction as a potent chemical gate in the proposed device. The complexes exhibit short intermolecular distances ranging from 1.724 to 1.752 &#197;, emphasizing their strong binding. Detailed analysis of electronic rearrangements and geometric perturbations upon complex formation provides insights into the underlying reasons for the formation of such strong Be&#8208;&#8208;&#8208;N bonds, with bond strengths varying from &#8208;116.25 to &#8208;92.96 kJ/mol. Moreover, the influence of chemical substituents on the local electronic transmission of the beryllium&#8208;bonded complex offers valuable insights for the implementation of a secondary chemical gate in single&#8208;molecule devices. This study paves the way for the development of chemically gateable, functional single&#8208;molecule transistors, advancing the design and fabrication of multifunctional single&#8208;molecule devices in the nanoscale regime.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new method for the activation of thioglycosides without a glycosyl halide intermediate by using a silver salt coupled with an acid additive and molecular iodine is reported. Application of the H&#8208;bond&#8208;mediated aglycone delivery (HAD) method lead to an enhanced stereocontrol.







Abstract
Reported herein is the development of a novel method for activating thioglycosides without a glycosyl halide intermediate. This has been achieved through the use of a silver salt coupled with an acid additive and molecular iodine. The enhanced stereocontrol was achieved via the H&#8208;bond mediated aglycone delivery (HAD) method, and the extended trisaccharide synthesis was achieved via iteration of deprotection and glycosylation steps.

         <title>Polymers of Intrinsic Microporosity Based on Dibenzodioxin Linkage: Design, Synthesis, Properties, and Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymers of intrinsic microporosity (PIMs) with dibenzodioxin linkage have been reviewed in terms of monomer design based on a wide range of rigid and contorted scaffolds, syntheses, properties, and their applications to understand the structure&#8208;property relationship, which is crucial for tailoring the properties.







Abstract
The development of polymers of intrinsic microporosity (PIMs) over the last two decades has established them as a distinct class of microporous materials, which combine the attributes of microporous solid materials and the soluble nature of glassy polymers. Due to their solubility in common organic solvents, PIMs are easily processable materials that potentially find application in membrane&#8208;based separation, catalysis, ion separation in electrochemical energy storage devices, sensing, etc. Dibenzodioxin linkage, Tr&#246;ger's base, and imide bond&#8208;forming reactions have widely been utilized for synthesis of a large number of PIMs. Among these linkages, however, most of the studies have been based on dibenzodioxin&#8208;based PIMs. Therefore, this review focuses precisely on dibenzodioxin linkage chemistry. Herein, the design principles of different rigid and contorted monomer scaffolds are discussed, as well as synthetic strategies of the polymers through dibenzodioxin&#8208;forming reactions including copolymerization and postsynthetic modifications, their characteristic properties and potential applications studied so far. Towards the end, the prospects of these materials are examined with respect to their utility in industrial purposes. Further, the structure&#8208;property correlation of dibenzodioxin PIMs is analyzed, which is essential for tailored synthesis and tunable properties of these PIMs and their molecular level engineering for enhanced performances making these materials suitable for commercial usage.

         <title>Skeletal Editing of (Hetero)Arenes Using Carbenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art developments in the skeletal editing of (hetero)arenes using carbenes, with an emphasis on the scope, reactivity, selectivity, and general mechanistic considerations. The impressive breadth of application of this strategy in both drug discovery and total synthesis is also discussed. Existing challenges and perspectives on future research directions to further understanding and new reaction developments are outlined.







Abstract
(Hetero)arenes continue to prove their indispensability in pharmaceuticals, materials science, and synthetic chemistry. As such, the controllable modification of biologically significant (hetero)arenes towards diverse more&#8208;potent complex molecular scaffolds through peripheral and skeletal editing has been considered a challenging goal in synthetic organic chemistry. Despite many excellent reviews on peripheral editing (i.&#8201;e., C&#8722;H functionalization) of (hetero)arenes, their skeletal editings via single atom insertion, deletion, or transmutations have received less attention in the review literature. In this review, we systematically summarize the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art skeletal editing reactions of (hetero)arenes using carbenes, with a focus on general mechanistic considerations and their applications in natural product syntheses. The potential opportunities and inherent challenges encountered while developing these strategies are also highlighted.

         <title>Effect of Polymeric Ligand Grafting Region on Confined Assembly of Gold Nanorods in cylindrical nanopores</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polystyrene end&#8208;tethered gold nanorod (AuNR@End&#8722;PS) exhibits a dumbbell&#8208;like shape, while the AuNR with PS tethered on entire surface (AuNR@Full&#8722;PS) shows a rod&#8208;like morphology. AuNR@End&#8722;PS is affected by the special steric hindrance at both ends, and prefers to form inclination arrangement, whereas AuNR@Full&#8722;PS prefer to be arranged shoulder&#8208;to&#8208;shoulder in a chain&#8208;like assembly in cylindrical nanopores.







Abstract
The grafting region of polymeric ligands exhibit a significant influence on the assembly behavior of polymer tethered gold nanorods (AuNRs) in confined space. In this work, the effect of core size, molecular weight and grafting region of ligands on the assembly structure in cylindrical nanopores was investigated. It is found that polystyrene end&#8208;tethered AuNR (AuNR@End&#8722;PS) exhibits a dumbbell&#8208;like shape, while the AuNR with PS tethered on the entire surface (AuNR@Full&#8722;PS) shows a rod&#8208;like morphology that gradually transforms into a spherical shape as the molecular weight increases. AuNR@End&#8722;PS is affected by the special steric hindrance at both ends, and prefers to form special structures such as inclination arrangement, whereas AuNR@Full&#8722;PS prefers to be arranged shoulder&#8208;to&#8208;shoulder in a chain&#8208;like assembly. The confinement effect was studied as well by varying the diameter of pores. The results show that the nanoparticles prefer to arrange into a regular and ordered assembly structure in the strong confinement spaces. Under the synergy of confined spaces and ligands at both ends, the AuNRs@End&#8722;PS are more likely to form a tilted order&#8208;assembly structure. The results of this work could provide new ideas and guidance for the preparation of ordered assembly of AuNRs with novel structures.

         <title>An Amphiphilic Peptide Carrier for HCl Transport</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
HCl transport mediated by amphiphilic peptides that structurally resemble lipids is described. Carboxylate and amide NH groups in the scaffold facilitate ion&#8208;pair transport across the membrane by carrier mechanism.







Abstract
Single molecules that co&#8208;transport cations as well as anions across lipid membranes are few despite their high biological utility. The elegant yet simple lipidomimmetic peptide design herein enables efficient HCl transport without the use of any external additives for proton transport. The carboxylic acids in the dipeptide scaffold provide a handle to append two long hydrophobic tails and also provide a polar hydrophilic carboxylate group. The peptide central unit also provides NH sites for anion binding. Protonation of the carboxylate group coupled with the weak halide binding of the terminal NH group results in HCl transport with transport rates of H+&gt;Cl&#8722;. The lipid&#8208;like structure also facilitates seamless membrane integration and flipping of the molecule.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;HCl transport&lt;/b&gt; mediated by amphiphilic peptides that structurally resemble lipids is described. Carboxylate and amide NH groups in the scaffold facilitate ion-pair transport across the membrane by carrier mechanism.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Single molecules that co-transport cations as well as anions across lipid membranes are few despite their high biological utility. The elegant yet simple lipidomimmetic peptide design herein enables efficient HCl transport without the use of any external additives for proton transport. The carboxylic acids in the dipeptide scaffold provide a handle to append two long hydrophobic tails and also provide a polar hydrophilic carboxylate group. The peptide central unit also provides NH sites for anion binding. Protonation of the carboxylate group coupled with the weak halide binding of the terminal NH group results in HCl transport with transport rates of H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;gt;Cl&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;. The lipid-like structure also facilitates seamless membrane integration and flipping of the molecule. The biocompatibility, design simplicity, and potential pH regulation of these molecules open up several avenues for their therapeutic use.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Computational Study of Single Metal Atom Anchored on Black Phosphorus for Methane Oxidation to Methanol by Nitrous Oxide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu single metal atoms anchored on black phosphorus are designed as efficient and low&#8208;price catalysts for converting methane to methanol. First&#8208;principles calculations show that Cu@BP exhibits the best methane activation performance through the radical reaction pathways and the formation of the Cu&#8722;O active site is rate&#8208;determining with an energy barrier of 0.48&#8197;eV.







Abstract
Direct conversion of methane to high&#8208;value&#8208;added transportable methanol is a great challenge, which requires high energy input to break the strong C&#8722;H bond. Developing efficient catalysts for methane oxidation to methanol under mild conditions is of vital importance. In this work, single transition metal atoms (TM=Fe, Co, Ni, Cu) anchored on black phosphorus (TM@BP) were studied as catalysts to assist the methane oxidation to methanol by means of first&#8208;principles calculations. The results indicate that Cu@BP exhibits an outstanding catalytic activity through the radical reaction pathways and the formation of the Cu&#8722;O active site is rate&#8208;determining with an energy barrier of 0.48&#8197;eV. Meanwhile, electronic structure calculations and dynamic simulations show that Cu@BP offers excellent thermal stability. Our calculations provide a new approach for the rational design of single atom catalysts for methane oxidation to methanol.

         <title>Use of Biomass Glycerol as a Reducing Agent for Photocatalytic Deprotection of Pyridine N&#8208;Oxides in an Aqueous Suspension of Titanium(IV) Oxide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photocatalytic deprotection of pyridine N&#8208;oxides was achieved using glycerol as the biomass reducing reagent, water as the solvent, TiO2 as the photocatalyst, and solar light as the light and thermal energy source.







Abstract
Deprotection of pyridine N&#8208;oxides under mild conditions with an inexpensive and environmentally friendly reducing reagent is an important chemical procedure. The use of biomass waste as the reducing reagent, water as the solvent and solar light as the energy source is one of the most promising approaches with minimal impact on the environment. Therefore, a TiO2 photocatalyst and glycerol are suitable components of this type of reaction. Stoichiometric deprotection of pyridine N&#8208;oxide (PyNO) with a minimal amount of glycerol (PyNO:glycerol= 7&#8201;:&#8201;1) was achieved, with only CO2 being produced as the final oxidation product of glycerol. The deprotection of PyNO was thermally accelerated. Under solar light, the temperature of the reaction system increased to 40&#8211;50&#8201;&#176;C and PyNO was also quantitatively deprotected, indicating that solar energy, i.&#8201;e., UV light and thermal energy, can be effectively used. The results provide a new approach in the fields of organic chemistry and medical chemistry using biomass waste and solar light.

         <title>Stereo&#8208;controlled Synthesis of Vicinal Tertiary Carbinols: Application in the Synthesis of Zaragozic Acid, Pactamycin and Ryanodol Core Structures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here we report a novel and flexible approach for the stereo&#8208;controlled synthesis of vicinal tertiary carbinols. The developed strategy featured a highly diastereoselective singlet&#8208;oxygen (O21) [4+2] cycloaddition of rationally designed cyclohexadienones (derived from oxidative dearomatization of the corresponding carboxylic&#8208;acid appended phenol precursors), followed by programmed &#8220;O&#8208;O&#8221; and &#8220;C&#8208;C&#8221; bond cleavage. In doing so, a highly functionalized and versatile intermediate was identified and prepared in synthetically useful quantity as a plausible precursor to access a variety of designed and naturally occurring vicinal tertiary carbinol containing compounds. Most notably, the developed strategy was successfully applied in the stereo&#8208;controlled synthesis of advanced core structures of zaragozic acid, pactamycin and ryanodol.</dc:description>

         <title>Anchoring Polydopamine on ZnCo2O4 Nanowire to Facilitate Urea Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Dealing with overcoming the sluggishness of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the urea oxidation reaction (UOR) existed. ZnCo2O4, an excellent OER electrocatalyst, its application towards UOR is studied with surface&#8208;grown polydopamine (PDA). ZnCo2O4@PDA is produced over the surface of nickel foam by hydrothermal method followed by self&#8208;polymerization of dopamine hydrochloride. Dopamine hydrochloride was varied in solution mixture to study the optimal growth of PDA necessary to enhance electrochemical activity. Hence, prepared ZnCo2O4@PDA is characterized by X&#8208;ray diffraction, electronic structural, and morphology/microstructure studies for confirmation. With successful confirmation, the developed electrode material is applied towards UOR and ZnCo2O4@ PDA&#8208;1.5, delivering an excellent low overpotential of 80 mV @ 20 mA/cm2 in the electrolyte mixture of 1 M potassium hydroxide + 0.33 M urea. Also, to support excellent UOR activity, other electrochemical properties such as tafel slope, electrochemical surface active sites, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy are studied. Further, a schematic illustration explaining the UOR mechanism is shown to clearly understand the obtained electrochemical activity. Finally, urea water electrolysis is carried out in a two&#8208;electrode symmetrical cell and compared with water electrolysis. This clearly shows the potential of the developed material for efficient electrochemical hydrogen production.</dc:description>

With successful confirmation, the developed electrode material is applied towards UOR and ZnCo2O4@ PDA-1.5, delivering an excellent low overpotential of 80 mV @ 20 mA/cm2 in the electrolyte mixture of 1 M potassium hydroxide + 0.33 M urea. Also, to support excellent UOR activity, other electrochemical properties such as tafel slope, electrochemical surface active sites, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy are studied. Further, a schematic illustration explaining the UOR mechanism is shown to clearly understand the obtained electrochemical activity. Finally, urea water electrolysis is carried out in a two-electrode symmetrical cell and compared with water electrolysis. This clearly shows the potential of the developed material for efficient electrochemical hydrogen production.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A set of mixed&#8208;substituted potassium alkylcyano&#8208; and alkylcyanofluoroborates has been synthesized using easily accessible starting compounds and characterized by elemental analysis, NMR and vibrational spectroscopy, and mass spectrometry. In addition, single&#8208;crystal structures of salts of the cyanoborate anions have been derived from X&#8208;ray diffraction experiments. The 1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium room temperature ionic liquids ([EMIm]+&#8208;RTILs) with the new borate anions have been synthesized and their physicochemical properties, i.e. high thermal and electrochemical stability, low viscosity, and high conductivity, have been compared to the properties of related [EMIm]+&#8208;RTILs. The influence of the different alkyl substituents at boron has been assessed. The exemplary study on the properties with the [EMIm]+&#8208;ILs with the mixed water stable&#160;alkylcyanoborate anions points towards the potential of these fluorine&#8208;free borate anions, in general.</dc:description>

         <title>The Power of Automation in Polymer Chemistry: Precision Synthesis of Multiblock Copolymers with Block Sequence Control</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Machines can revolutionize the field of chemistry and material science, driving the development of new chemistries, increasing productivity, and facilitating reaction scale up. The incorporation of automated systems in the field of polymer chemistry has however proven challenging owing to the demanding reaction conditions, rendering the automation setup complex and costly. There is an imminent need for an automation platform which uses fast and simple polymerization protocols, while providing a high level of control on the structure of macromolecules via precision synthesis. In this work, we combine an oxygen tolerant, room temperature polymerization method with a simple liquid handling robot to automatically prepare precise and high order multiblock copolymers with unprecedented livingness even after many chain extensions. We report the highest number of blocks synthesized in such a system, demonstrating the capabilities of this automated platform for the rapid synthesis and complex polymer structure formation.</dc:description>

         <title>A New Pathway for Synthesis of Ketone from Aldehyde and Sulfonylhydrazone: Is Diazo the Key Intermediate?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A new pathway via a cyclic intermediate for synthesis of ketone from aldehyde and sulfonylhydrazone derivative under base condition was proposed by performing several control experiments along with analyzing the mass spectra and in situ IR of the reaction mixture. Inspired by the new mechanism, an efficient and scalable method for homologation of aldehydes to ketones has been developed. The wide variety of target ketones were obtained in yields of 42&#8208;95% by simply heating the 3&#8208;(Trifluoromethyl)benzene sulfonylhydrazones (3&#8208;(Tfsyl)hydrazone) with aldehydes at 110 &#176;C in 2 hours with K2CO3&#160;and DMSO as base and solvent, respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>Photochemical [2+2] Cycloaddition of Alkynyl Boronates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A photochemical [2+2] cycloaddition of alkynyl boronates and maleimides is reported. The developed protocol provided 35&#8211;70% yield of maleimide&#8208;derived cyclobutenyl boronates and demonstrated wide compatibility with various functional groups. The synthetic utility of the prepared building blocks was demonstrated for a range of transformations, including Suzuki cross&#8208;coupling, catalytic or metal&#8208;hydride reduction, oxidation, and cycloaddition reactions. With aryl&#8208;substituted alkynyl boronates, the products of double [2+2] cycloaddition were obtained predominantly. Using the developed protocol, a cyclobutene&#8208;derived analogue of Thalidomide was prepared in one step. Mechanistic studies supported the participation of the triplet&#8208;excited state maleimides and ground state alkynyl boronates in the key step of the process.</dc:description>

         <title>Microwave&#8208;Assisted One Pot Cascade Conversion of Furfural to &#947;&#8208;Valerolactone over Sc(OTf)3</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#947;&#8208;Valerolactone (GVL) is considered as a star biochemical which can be used as a green solvent, fuel additive and versatile organic intermediate. In this study, metal triflate (M(OTf)n) was utilized as the catalyst for one&#8208;pot transformation of furfural (FF) to GVL in alcohol media under microwave irradiation. Alcohol plays multiple functions including solvent, hydrogen donor and alcoholysis reagent in this cascade reaction process. And process efficiency of GVL production from FF upgrading is strongly related to the effective charge density of selected catalyst and the reduction potential of selected alcohol. Complex (OTf)n&#8208;M&#8208;O(H)R, presenting both Br&#248;nsted acid and Lewis acid, is the real catalytic active species in this cascade reaction process. Among various catalysts, Sc(OTf)3 exhibited the best catalytic activity for GVL production. Various reaction parameters including the Sc(OTf)3 amount, reaction temperature and time were optimized by the response surface methodology with the central composite design (RSM&#8208;CCD). Up to 81.2% GVL yield and 100% FF conversion were achieved at 143.9 oC after 8.1 h in the presence of 0.16 mmol catalyst. This catalyst exhibits high reusability and can be regenerated by oxidative degradation of humins. In addition, a plausible cascade reaction network was proposed based on the distribution of product.</dc:description>

         <title>Water&#8208;Dispersible Carbon Nano&#8208;Test Tubes as a Container for Concentrated DNA Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Water&#8208;dispersible carbon nano&#8208;test tubes (CNTTs) with an inner and outer diameter of about 25 and 35 nm, respectively, were prepared by the template technique and then their inner carbon surface was selectively oxidized to introduce carboxy groups. The adsorption behavior of DNA molecules on the oxidized CNTTs (Ox&#8208;CNTTs) was examined in the presence of Ca2+ cations. Many DNA molecules are attracted to the inner space of Ox&#8208;CNTTs based on the Ca2+&#8208;mediated electrostatic interaction between DNA phosphate groups and carboxylate anions on the inner carbon surface. Moreover, the total net charge of the DNA adsorbed was found to be equal to the total charge of the carboxylate anions. This selective adsorption into the interior of Ox&#8208;CNTTs can be explained from the fact that the electrostatic interaction onto the inner concave surface is much stronger than that on the outer convex surface. On the other hand, the desorption of DNA easily occurs whenever Ca2+ cations are removed by washing with deionized water. Thus, each of Ox&#8208;CNTTs works well as a nano&#8208;container for a large amount of DNA molecules, thereby resulting in the occurrence of DNA enrichment in the nanospace.</dc:description>

Moreover, the total net charge of the DNA adsorbed was found to be equal to the total charge of the carboxylate anions. This selective adsorption into the interior of Ox-CNTTs can be explained from the fact that the electrostatic interaction onto the inner concave surface is much stronger than that on the outer convex surface. On the other hand, the desorption of DNA easily occurs whenever Ca2+ cations are removed by washing with deionized water. Thus, each of Ox-CNTTs works well as a nano-container for a large amount of DNA molecules, thereby resulting in the occurrence of DNA enrichment in the nanospace.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Recent&#160;Advances&#160;in Aerobic Oxidative of&#160;C&#8208;H Bond by Molecular Oxygen Focus on Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aerobic oxidative cross coupling represents one of the most straightforward and atom&#8208;economic methods for construction of C&#8722;C and C&#8722;X (X = N, O, S, or P) bonds using air as a sustainable external oxidant. The oxidative coupling of C&#8208;H bonds in heterocyclic compounds can effectively increase their molecular complexity by introducing new functional groups through C&#8208;H bond activation, or by formation of new heterocyclic structures through cascade construction of two or more sequential chemical bonds. This is very useful as it can increase the potential applications of these structures in natural products, pharmaceuticals, agricultural chemicals, and functional materials. This is a representative overview of recent progress since 2010 on green oxidative coupling reactions of C&#8208;H bond using O2 or air as internal&#160;oxidant focus on Heterocycles. It aims to provide a platform for expanding the scope and utility of air as green oxidant, together with a brief discussion on research into the mechanisms behind it.</dc:description>

N&#8208;functionalized pyridinium molecules derived from the three major vitamers of vitamin B6, pyridoxal, pyridoxamine and pyridoxine, have been screened computationally for consideration as negative electrode materials in aqueous organic flow batteries.







Abstract
N&#8208;functionalized pyridinium frameworks derived from the three major vitamers of vitamin B6, pyridoxal, pyridoxamine and pyridoxine, have been screened computationally for consideration as negative electrode materials in aqueous organic flow batteries. A molecular database including the structure and the one&#8208;electron standard reduction potential of related pyridinium derivatives has been generated using a computational protocol that combines semiempirical and DFT quantum chemical methods. The predicted reduction potentials span a broad range for the investigated pyridinium frameworks, but pyridoxal derivatives, particularly those involving electron withdrawing substituents, have potentials compatible with the electrochemical stability window of aqueous electrolytes. The stability of radicals formed upon one&#8208;electron reduction has been analyzed by a new computational tool proposed recently for large&#8208;scale computational screening.

         <title>Orthogonal Strategies for Profiling Potential Cellular Targets of Anandamide and Cannabidiol</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Affinity&#8208;based protein profiling (AfBPP) and &#8216;label&#8208;free&#8217; 2D&#8208;TPP (2 Dimensional&#8208;Thermal Protein Profiling) platforms have been used to identify potential cellular targets of cannabinoids, especially cannabidiol (CBD), leading to the discovery of both shared and unique protein targets. Subsequent target validation led to the conclusion that this 2D&#8208;TPP strategy complements well with AfBPP.







Abstract
The human endocannabinoid system regulates a myriad of physiological processes through a complex lipid signaling network involving cannabinoids and their respective receptors, cannabinoid receptor 1 (hCB1R) and cannabinoid receptor 2 (hCB2R). Anandamide (AEA) and cannabidiol (CBD) are classical examples of cannabinoids that elicit a variety of effects, both beneficial and detrimental, through these receptors. Mounting evidence suggested the presence of other potential cannabinoid targets that may be responsible for other observable effects. However, prior pharmacological studies on these cannabinoid compounds provided scant evidence of direct engagement to these proposed targets. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, no chemoproteomic studies have been demonstrated on CBD. Here we showed that, by taking advantage of a recently developed &#8216;label&#8208;free&#8217; 2D&#8208;TPP (2 Dimensional&#8208;Thermal Protein Profiling) approach, we have identified several new putative targets of both AEA and CBD. Comparison of these interaction landscapes with those obtained from well&#8208;established affinity&#8208;based protein profiling (AfBPP) platforms has led to the discovery of both shared and unique protein targets. Subsequent target validation of selected proteins led us to conclude that this 2D&#8208;TPP strategy complements well with AfBPP.

         <title>From Terminal to Spiro&#8208;Phosphonium Acceptors, Remarkable Moieties to Develop Polyaromatic NIR Dyes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Low energy absorption and emission were realized in a series of anthracene&#8208;derived donor&#8208;acceptor phosphonium dyes. The electron deficiency of the rare phospha&#8208;spiro architecture allowed to achieve fluorescence at 797&#8197;nm in dichloromethane and at 860&#8197;nm in the solid state.







Abstract
Phosphonium&#8208;based compounds gain attention as promising photofunctional materials. As a contribution to the emerging field, we present a series of donor&#8208;acceptor ionic dyes, which were constructed by tailoring phosphonium (A) and extended &#960;&#8208;NR2 (D) fragments to an anthracene framework. The alteration of the &#960;&#8208;spacer of electron&#8208;donating substituents in species with terminal &#8722;+PPh2Me groups exhibits a long absorption wavelength up to &#955;abs=527&#8197;nm in dichloromethane and shifted the emission to the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region (&#955;=805&#8197;nm for thienyl aniline donor), although at low quantum yield (&#934;&lt;0.01). In turn, the introduction of a P&#8208;heterocyclic acceptor substantially narrowed the optical bandgap and improved the efficiency of fluorescence. In particular, the phospha&#8208;spiro moiety allowed to attain NIR emission (797&#8197;nm in dichloromethane) with fluorescence efficiency as high as &#934;=0.12. The electron&#8208;accepting property of the phospha&#8208;spiro constituent outperformed that of the monocyclic and terminal phosphonium counterparts, illustrating a promising direction in the design of novel charge&#8208;transfer chromophores.

         <title>Cyanine&#8208; and Rhodamine&#8208;Derived Alkynes for the Selective Targeting of Cancerous Mitochondria through Radical Thiol&#8208;Yne Coupling in Live Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

Cyanine&#8211;aryl acetylene conjugates (pink) accumulate in the mitochondria of cancer cells, where the elevated pH and reactive oxygen species (white) levels allow the formation of thiyl radicals (yellow glowing pin and first arrow) from thiols (dark yellow pin). The activation enables radical thiol&#8208;yne coupling of biomolecules to the dye&#8211;alkyne conjugate (second arrow). This represents a powerful tool for the selective targeting of cancerous mitochondria through physicochemical accumulation and stimuli&#8208;responsive reactivity.

         <dc:description>
A series of asymmetric bistricyclic aromatic ene&#8208;based molecules were synthesized with fluoreneylidene&#8208;cyclopentadithiophene skeleton, and exhibited low bandgap characteristic with long wavelength absorption tail. The substituents effect revealed impact on their energy levels and charge transporting property, which provides a new idea for design of HTMs for perovskite solar cells.Fluorenylidene&#8208;Cyclopentadithiophene Based Asymmetric Bistricyclic Aromatic Ene Compounds: Synthesis and Substituents Effects (Yin, Qiao, et&#8197;al.)







Abstract
Low band gap materials have always been a focus of attention due to their potential applications in various fields. In this work, a series of asymmetric bistricyclic aromatic ene (BAE) compounds with fluorenylidene&#8208;cyclopentadithiophene (FYT) skeleton were facially synthesized, which were modified with different substituents (&#8722;OMe, &#8722;SMe). The FYT core exhibit twisted C=C bond with dihedral angles around 30&#176;, and the introduction of &#8722;SMe group can provide additional S&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;S interaction between molecules, which is conducive to the charge transporting. The UV&#8208;Vis spectra, electrochemistry and photoelectron spectroscopy revealed that these compounds have relatively narrow band gaps, particularly, the &#8722;SMe modified compounds have slightly lower HOMO and Fermi energy levels than that of the &#8722;OMe modified compounds. Furthermore, PSCs devices were fabricated with the three compounds as HTMs, and FYT&#8208;DSDPA exhibit the best performance among them, revealing the fine&#8208;tuning band structure could influence properties of HTMs.

         <title>Effect of Flexible Spacer and Alkyl Tail Length on the Liquid Crystalline Phase Behavior of Fullerene Block Molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel superlattice containing 3 hydrocarbon single layers alternating with 4 fullerene 2D crystals can be generated in a wide range of fullerene block molecules (n=10 or 12; m=5&#8211;7), owing to the cooperative effect of a long spacer and short terminal tails. This offers a practical way to construct unconventional semi&#8208;conductive superstructures.







Abstract
Here the supramolecular liquid crystalline (LC) phase behavior of a series of fullerene block molecules was investigated regarding spacer length, alkyl tail length and temperature. These compounds exhibit several lamellar LC phases with different packings of self&#8208;organized fullerene two&#8208;dimensional (2D) crystals. With a short hexamethylene spacer, they form sandwich&#8208;like structures with triple or quadruple fullerene layers. By increasing the spacer length to 10 or 12 carbons, a composite layers&#8208;in&#8208;lamella superlattice structure with alternating soft hydrocarbon single layers and fullerene single or double layers was obtained. As the molecular configurational freedom between incompatible moieties was enhanced by the elongated spacer, the required cross&#8208;sectional fullerene&#8208;to&#8208;hydrocarbon ratio for the superlattice could be achieved despite of different volume fractions of the blocks. The superlattice phase range is efficiently widened by the design principle of constructing LC molecules with a long spacer, which also provides a facile way to tailor novel superstructures.

         <title>Photochemically Mediated Toluene Oxidation through a Copper Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method to oxidize toluene selectively to benzaldehyde photochemically is described. A series of copper(I) complexes with different ligands were applied in combination with [Ru(bipy)3](PF6)2 and dioxygen as the oxidant. The copper(II) complexes obtained after oxidation were photochemically reduced to the starting copper(I) species, and the process can be repeated continuously.







Abstract
A method is described to photochemically oxidize toluene selectively to benzaldehyde, an essential compound in the chemical industry. Copper(I) complexes with different ligands were applied in combination with [Ru(bipy)3](PF6)2 and dioxygen as the oxidant. As a result, a &#8220;dioxygen adduct&#8221; copper complex, for example, a peroxido complex, is formed as the active species. The copper(II) complex obtained after oxidation can be photochemically reduced to the starting copper(I) species, and the process can be repeated continuously. The ligand tris(2&#8208;methylpyridyl)amine (tmpa) led to the highest conversion rates.

         <title>RNA&#8208;Catalyzed RNA Ligation within Prebiotically Plausible Model Protocells
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ribozyme capable of functioning at low Mg2+ concentrations catalyzes efficient template&#8208;directed ligation of RNA substrates inside a prebiotically plausible fatty acid protocell. Compartmentalized RNA assembly catalyzed by ribozymes is central to the viability of spontaneously evolving protocells.







Abstract
Demonstrating RNA catalysis within prebiotically relevant models of primordial cells (protocells) remains a challenge in origins of life research. Fatty acid vesicles encapsulating genomic and catalytic RNAs (ribozymes) are attractive models for protocells; however, RNA catalysis has largely been incompatible with fatty acid vesicles due to their instability in the presence of Mg2+ at the concentrations required for ribozyme function. Here, we report a ribozyme that catalyzes template&#8208;directed RNA ligation at low Mg2+ concentrations and thus remains active within stable vesicles. Ribose and adenine, both prebiotically relevant molecules, were found to greatly reduce Mg2+&#8208;induced RNA leakage from vesicles. When we co&#8208;encapsulated the ribozyme, substrate, and template within fatty acid vesicles, we observed efficient RNA&#8208;catalyzed RNA ligation upon subsequent addition of Mg2+. Our work shows that RNA&#8208;catalyzed RNA assembly can occur efficiently within prebiotically plausible fatty acid vesicles and represents a step toward the replication of primordial genomes within self&#8208;replicating protocells.

         <title>Turning the Imidazole Core into Three&#8208;Dimensional Ring Systems: Mild Organocatalytic Entry to Enantiopure 6,7&#8208;Dihydrobenzimidazoles</title>

The challenging side of simplicity: Easily available imidazole&#8208;based substrates were coupled with &#946;&#8208;aryl enals via eliminative [4+2] cycloaddition under mild aminocatalytic conditions to access rare chiral [d]&#8208;fused imidazole ring systems with optimal enantio&#8208; and regioselectivity and good potential for post&#8208;cycloaddition functional group editing.







Abstract
Organocatalytic asymmetric transformation of common aromatic heterocycles via in&#8197;situ formation of highly reactive dearomatized ortho&#8208;quinodimethane diene species and subsequent [4+2] cycloaddition with suitable dienophiles has become a powerful tool to enter cyclohexane&#8208;fused heterocycles. Most of these reactions were previously applied to benzo&#8208;fused heterocycles or poorly aromatic rings. Herein, we disclose how previously intractable aromatic imidazole rings, equipped with removable methylidene malononitrile activating handle, could be involved as competent cycloaddends with &#946;&#8208;aryl enals in efficient eliminative [4+2] cycloadditions under mild organocatalytic conditions. This method allowed the efficient and direct preparation of scantly represented 6,7&#8208;dihydrobenzo[d]imidazoles with optimal enantio&#8208; and regioselectivities. Post&#8208;cycloaddition chemical editing provided imidazole&#8208;based ring systems with diverse oxidation state and functional groups.

         <title>Reactivity Differences of Trigonal Pyramidal Nonheme Iron(IV)&#8208;Oxo and Iron(III)&#8208;Oxo Complexes: Experiment and Theory</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combined experimental and computational studies show iron(III)&#8208;oxo complexes can abstract hydrogen atoms from toluene efficiently, but thermochemically fail to do OH rebound and as such tolyl radicals are released and react separately. As a consequence iron(IV)&#8208;oxo and iron(III)&#8208;oxo generate different products in a reaction with toluene.







Abstract
High&#8208;valent metal&#8208;oxo species play critical roles in enzymatic catalysis yet their properties are still poorly understood. In this work we report a combined experimental and computational study into biomimetic iron(IV)&#8208;oxo and iron(III)&#8208;oxo complexes with tight second&#8208;coordination sphere environments that restrict substrate access. The work shows that the second&#8208;coordination sphere slows the hydrogen atom abstraction step from toluene dramatically and the kinetics is zeroth order in substrate. However, the iron(II)&#8208;hydroxo that is formed has a low reduction potential and hence cannot do OH rebound favorably. The tolyl radical in solution then reacts further with alternative reaction partners. By contrast, the iron(IV)&#8208;oxo species reacts predominantly through OH rebound to form alcohol products. Our studies show that the oxidation state of the metal influences reactivities and selectivities with substrate dramatically and that enzymes will likely need an iron(IV) center to catalyze C&#8722;H hydroxylation reactions.

         <title>Strong and Tunable Near&#8208;Infrared Circular Dichroism in Helical Tetrapyrrole Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Helical metal complexes of tetraphenylbilatrienones (TPBT) have been selectively synthesized, and for the first time, their structure was revealed by XRD. Contrary to theoretical predictions, their 20&#8208;phenyl group points alongside the tetrapyrrole backbone, yielding a well&#8208;defined molecule with stable helicity, 800&#8197;nm ECD absorption and &#8211; if copper is coordinated &#8211; noninnocent properties.







Abstract
The selective synthesis of nickel and copper complexes of 19&#8208;benzoyl&#8208;5,10,15&#8208;triphenyl&#8208;bilatrien&#8208;1&#8208;one (H2TPBT) is reported, a molecule which crystallizes as a molecular helix of one&#8208;and&#8208;a&#8208;quarter which turns with a 5.7&#8197;&#197; radius and a 3.2&#8197;&#197; pitch, and all 26 participating atoms are sp2&#8208;hybridized. UV/vis, ECD, ESR and cyclic voltammetry experiments reveal a strong interaction between metal and ligand and partial radical character when copper is coordinated instead of nickel. Strong ECD absorption in the 800&#8197;nm range is found which, using TD&#8208;DFT calculations as well as literature spectra, is shown to be highly tunable both by metal coordination and variation of the aryl groups in the TPBT periphery. The radical character of the ligand in Cu(TPBT) enables rapid interconversion between (M)&#8208; and (P)&#8208;enantiomers, possibly via intermittent breakage of a Cu&#8722;N bond. The 19&#8208;benzoyl group kinetically stabilizes enantiopure (M/P)&#8208;Ni(TPBT). The results are interpreted with regard to the application as circularly polarized light (CPL) detectors as well as to the chirality&#8208;induced spin&#8208;selectivity (CISS) effect which is currently lacking a concise theoretical model.

         <title>EnT&#8208;Mediated Amino&#8208;Sulfonylation of Alkenes with Bifunctional Sulfonamides: Access to &#946;&#8208;Amino Sulfone Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A benign method was developed for the economical and sustainable amino&#8208;sulfonylation of alkenes with high regioselectivity and diastereoselectivity. This approach showed high functional group tolerance and compatibility, facilitating the late&#8208;stage modification of some bioactive alkenes and sulfonamide molecules, thereby expanding the biologically relevant chemical space. Mechanistic investigations suggest that an energy transfer (EnT) process was in operation.







Abstract
&#946;&#8208;Amino sulfones are commonly found structural motifs in biologically active compounds. Herein, we report a direct photocatalyzed amino&#8208;sulfonylation reaction of alkenes for the efficicient production of important compounds by simple hydrolysis without the need for additional oxidants and reductants. In this transformation, the sulfonamides worked as bifunctional reagents, simultaneously generating sulfonyl radicals and N&#8208;centered radicals which were added to alkene in a highly atom&#8208;economical fashion with high regioselectivity and diastereoselectivity. This approach showed high functional group tolerance and compatibility, facilitating the late&#8208;stage modification of some bioactive alkenes and sulfonamide molecules, thereby expanding the biologically relevant chemical space. Scaling up this reaction led to an efficient green synthesis of apremilast, one of the best&#8208;selling pharmceuticals, demonstrating the synthetic utility of the applied method. Moreover, mechanistic investigations suggest that an energy transfer (EnT) process was in operation.

         <title>Smart Temperature&#8208;Gating and Ion Conductivity Control of Grafted Anodic Aluminum Oxide Membranes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Progress in solid&#8208;state nanochannels development: A thermo&#8208;responsive polymer poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) brushes grafted anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) membrane by surface&#8208;initiated atom transfer radical polymerization (SI&#8208;ATRP) is presented. This thermo&#8208;gated smart membrane shows a reversible surface wettability change, which allows the smart membrane to control the ion conductivity and ensures the dye release ability.







Abstract
Over the past few decades, stimuli&#8208;responsive materials have been widely applied to porous surfaces. Permeability and conductivity control of ions confined in nanochannels modified with stimuli&#8208;responsive materials, however, have been less investigated. In this work, the permeability and conductivity control of ions confined in nanochannels of anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) templates modified with thermo&#8208;responsive poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) brushes are demonstrated. By surface&#8208;initiated atom transfer radical polymerization (SI&#8208;ATRP), PNIPAM brushes are successfully grafted onto the hexagonally packed cylindrical nanopores of AAO templates. The surface hydrophilicities of the membranes can be reversibly altered because of the lower critical solution temperature (LCST) behavior of the PNIPAM polymer brushes. From electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis, the temperature&#8208;gating behaviors of the AAO&#8208;g&#8208;PNIPAM membranes exhibit larger impedance changes than those of the pure AAO membranes at higher temperatures because of the aggregation of the grafted PNIPAM chains. The reversible surface properties caused by the extended and collapsed states of the polymer chains are also demonstrated by dye release tests. The smart thermo&#8208;gated and ion&#8208;controlled nanoporous membranes are suitable for future smart membrane applications.

         <title>Cyclization, Decyclization, and Metallacyclization of Pyridine&#8208;Substituted Homopropargylic Alcohols on Ruthenium(II) and Osmium(II) Centers</title>

Experimental and theoretical investigations on the reactions between cis&#8208;[Ru/Os(dppm)2Cl2] and pyridine/quinoline&#8208;substituted homopropargylic alcohols provided strategies to prepare new metalated heterocyclic and metalacyclic complexes by utilizing temperature&#8208;controlled divergent pathways and an unexpected decyclization mechanism.

Abstract
Systematic investigations on the reactions between cis&#8208;[M(dppm)2Cl2] (M=Ru/Os; dppm=1,1&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)methane) and pyridine/quinoline substituted homopropargylic alcohols uncovered the diverse Ru(II)/Os(II)&#8208;induced alkyne activation pathways. The alkynes underwent cyclization on M via a &#8220;non&#8208;vinylidene&#8221; pathway at lower temperatures, resulting in alkenyl intermediates which might further metallacyclize to give metallapyrroloindolizines. Conversely, reactions at higher temperatures induced alkyne cyclization on M via a &#8220;vinylidene&#8221; pathway, affording cyclic oxacarbene complexes. Additionally, a rare decyclization mechanism was observed during the transformation of a metallacyclization&#8208;resistant alkenyl complex into a cyclic oxacarbene complex. DFT calculations were employed to validate the experimental findings. Overall, these results not only provide insights into controlling alkyne activation pathways, but also offer new strategies for preparing metalated heterocyclic and metallacyclic complexes.

         <title>The First Cu(I)&#8208;Peptoid Complex: Enabling Metal Ion Stability and Selectivity via Backbone Helicity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first Cu(I)&#8208;peptoid complex is presented here. This complex is based on a helical peptoid incorporating 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine (Bipy) ligands pre&#8208;organized on the same side of the helix. Interplay between the first and second coordination spheres is demonstrated, where the first coordination sphere is provided by the two Bipy ligands and the second by the helical structure, enabling the high stability of Cu(I).







Abstract
Stabilization of Cu(I) is ubiquitous within native copper proteins. Understanding how to stabilize Cu(I) within synthetic biomimetic systems is therefore desired towards biological applications. Peptoids are an important class of peptodomimetics, that can bind metal ions and stabilize them in their high oxidation state. Thus, to date, they were not used for Cu(I) binding. Here we show how the helical peptoid hexamer, having two 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine (Bipy) groups that face the same side of the helix, forms the intramolecular air stable Cu(I) complex. Further study of the binding site by rigorous spectroscopic techniques suggests that Cu(I) is tetracoordinated, binding to only three N atoms from the Bipy ligands and to the N&#8208;terminus of the peptoid's backbone. A set of control peptoids and experiments indicates that the Cu(I) stability and selectivity are dictated by the intramolecular binding, forced by the helicity of the peptoid, which can be defined as the second coordination sphere of the metal center.

         <title>Structural Conversion of Supramolecular Assembly in Solution by Thermally Induced Intramolecular Electron Transfer of [Co2Fe2] Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structural conversion of a supramolecular assembly was controlled by the thermally induced electron transfer&#8208;coupled spin transition (ETCST) of a [Co2Fe2] complex. The complex with an amphiphilic anion formed reverse vesicles in solution. The thermal ETCST of the complex in the presence of a dicarboxylic acid changed the structure from the reverse vesicle to entangled one&#8208;dimensional chains through the formation of hydrogen bonds.







Abstract
Combining metal complexes with amphiphilic molecules leads to a wide variety of functional self&#8208;assembled nanostructures. Metal complexes exhibiting spin transitions can be good candidates as the trigger to cause structural conversion of such assembly because they respond to various external stimuli. In this work, we studied a structural conversion of a supramolecular assembly containing a [Co2Fe2] complex through a thermally induced electron transfer&#8208;coupled spin transition (ETCST). With an amphiphilic anion, the [Co2Fe2] complex formed reverse vesicles in solution and showed thermal ETCST. In contrast, thermal ETCST in the presence of a bridging hydrogen&#8208;bond donor caused structural conversion from the reverse vesicle structure to entangled one&#8208;dimensional chains through hydrogen bond formation.

         <title>Strong Chiroptical Effects in the Absorption and Emission of Macrocycles Based on the 2,5&#8208;Diaminoterephthalate Minimal Fluorophore</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple one&#8208;pot reaction produces chiral macrocycles consisting of repeatable units of dimethyl 2,5&#8208;diaminoterephthalate (n=2&#8211;4). The products fluoresce in solution and the solid state at wavelengths that are dependent on the size of the macrocyclic ring. ECD and CPL spectra reveal high chiroptical activity in the red range, despite their small chromophores.







Abstract
Chiral fluorescent macrocycles consisting of two to four units of dimethyl 2,5&#8208;diaminoterephthalate can be readily synthesized in a one&#8208;pot manner from inexpensive building blocks. Depending on the concentration, either a paracyclophane&#8208;like dimer with closely stacked benzene rings or a triangular trimer is the main product of the reaction. The macrocycles exhibit fluorescence in solution as well as in the solid state with maxima that are red&#8208;shifted with decreasing size of the macrocyclic ring and are observed at wavelengths from 590 (tetramer in solution) to 700&#8197;nm (dimer in the solid state). Chirality dictates the differential absorption and emission of circularly polarized light by these molecules. The ECD and CPL effects are particularly strong for the trimer, which is characterized by relatively large dissymmetry factors gabs=&#177;2.8&#215;10&#8722;3 at 531&#8197;nm and glum=&#177;2.3&#215;10&#8722;3 at 580&#8197;nm in n&#8208;hexane, being at the same time highly luminescent (&#934;fl=13.7&#8201;%). Despite the small chromophore, the circularly polarized brightness BCPL of 2.3&#8197;dm3&#8201;mol&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1 is comparable to values reported for other classes of established CPL emitters in the visible region, such as expanded helicenes or larger &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems.

         <title>Sugar&#8208;Bridged Fullerene Dumbbells and Their Interaction with the [10]Cycloparaphenylene Nanoring</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel sugar&#8208;bridged fullerene dumbbells were synthesized and fully characterized. Methano&#8208; and furan&#8208;fused C60 interacted with [10]CPP, an electron&#8208;donating nanoring, to form bis&#8208;pseudorotaxanes. Interestingly, the methano&#8208;dumbbell molecules showed a different binding behaviour as mono&#8208;, bis&#8208;pseudorotaxanes as well as oligomers (polymers) were detected.







Abstract
The synthesis and characterization of four dumbbell&#8208;shaped fullerene molecules connected by isosorbide and isomannide moieties is presented. Additionally, their electrochemical behavior and their ability to form complexes with [10]cycloparaphenylene ([10]CPP) were investigated. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) results of the fullerene dumbbells demonstrate a high electron affinity, indicating their strong interaction with electron&#8208;donating counterparts such as carbon nanorings, which possess complementary charge and shape properties. To study the thermodynamic and kinetic parameters of complexation, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) was employed. NMR titration experiments provided further insights into the binding stoichiometries. Two distinct approaches were utilized to create bridged structures: one based on cyclopropane and the other based on furan. Regardless of the type of linker used, all derivatives formed conventional 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 complexes denoted as [10]CPP2&#8835;C60derivative. However, the methano&#8208;dumbbell molecules exhibited distinct binding behavior, resulting in the formation of mono&#8208; and bis&#8208;pseudorotaxanes, as well as oligomers (polymers). The formation of linear polymers holds significant potential for applications in solar energy conversion processes.

&lt;p&gt;The synthesis and characterization of four dumbbell-shaped fullerene molecules connected by isosorbide and isomannide moieties is presented. Additionally, their electrochemical behavior and their ability to form complexes with [10]cycloparaphenylene ([10]CPP) were investigated. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) results of the fullerene dumbbells demonstrate a high electron affinity, indicating their strong interaction with electron-donating counterparts such as carbon nanorings, which possess complementary charge and shape properties. To study the thermodynamic and kinetic parameters of complexation, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) was employed. NMR titration experiments provided further insights into the binding stoichiometries. Two distinct approaches were utilized to create bridged structures: one based on cyclopropane and the other based on furan. Regardless of the type of linker used, all derivatives formed conventional 2&#8201;:&#8201;1 complexes denoted as [10]CPP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8835;C&lt;sub&gt;60derivative&lt;/sub&gt;. However, the methano-dumbbell molecules exhibited distinct binding behavior, resulting in the formation of mono- and bis-pseudorotaxanes, as well as oligomers (polymers). The formation of linear polymers holds significant potential for applications in solar energy conversion processes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
