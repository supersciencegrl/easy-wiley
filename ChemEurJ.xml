         <title>Naphthodithiophene&#8208;Fused Porphyrins: Synthesis, Characterization, and Impact of Extended Conjugation on Aromaticity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fusion of tetrapyrroles with aromatic heterocycles constitutes a useful tool for manipulation of their opto&#8208;electronic properties. In this work, the synthesis of naphthodithiophene&#8208;fused porphyrins was achieved through a Heck reaction&#8208;based cascade reaction followed by a Scholl reaction. These naphthodithiophene&#8208;fused porphyrins display a unique set of optical and electronic properties. Fusion of the naphtho[2,1&#8208;b:3,4&#8208;b']dithiophene to porphyrin (F2VTP) leads to an increase in the fluorescence lifetime by ~20%, which is accompanied, unexpectedly, by a more than 2&#8208;fold drop in the emission quantum yield (&#934;=0.018). In contrast, fusion of the isomeric naphtho[1,2&#8208;b:4,3&#8208;b']dithiophene to porphyrin (F3VPT) results in a ~1.5&#8208;fold increase in the fluorescence quantum yield (&#934;=0.13) with the concomitant ~30% increase in the fluorescence lifetime. This behaviour suggests that fusion of the porphyrin with the naphthodithiopheno&#8208;system affects mainly the radiative rate constant in the Q&#8208;state deactivation pathway, while the effects of the isomeric naphtho[2,1&#8208;b:3,4&#8208;b']dithiophene&#8208; vs naphtho[1,2&#8208;b:4,3&#8208;b']dithiophene&#8208;fusion are essentially the opposite. Interestingly, NICS analysis revealed considerable difference between the aromaticity of these two isomericsystems. Our results demonstrate that subtle structural differences in the fused components of the porphyrin can be reflected in rather significant differences between the photophysical properties of the resulting systems.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>1,1,2,2&#8208;Tetrafluoroethyl&#8208;containing compounds are valuable structures due to their unique physicochemical properties, which have increasing potential application in drug discovery. However, synthetic methods for preparing such compounds are rare. Herein, we report the first use of 1,1,2,2&#8208;tetrafluoroethanesulfonyl chloride to introduce the HCF2CF2 group into organic molecules via a three&#8208;component, radical tetrafluoroethyl&#8208;heteroarylation of alkenes with readily available quinoxalin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;ones. This method provides a new and facile approach for late&#8208;stage functionalization of potential biologically active molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;catalyzed Decarboxylative Allylations: Development and Mechanistic Studies.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In recent years, there has been a concerted drive to develop methods that are greener and more sustainable. Being an earth&#8208;abundant transition metal, cobalt offers an attractive substitute for commonly employed precious metal catalysts, though reactions engaging cobalt are still less developed. Herein, we report a method to achieve the decarboxylative allylation of nitrophenyl alkanes, nitroalkanes, and ketones employing cobalt. The reaction allows for the formation of various substituted allylated products in moderate&#8208;excellent yields with a broad scope. Additionally, the synthetic potential of the methodology is demonstrated by the transformation of products into versatile heterocyclic motifs. Mechanistic studies revealed an in situ activation of the Co(II)/dppBz precatalyst by the carboxylate salt to generate a Co(I)&#8208;species, which is presumed to be the active catalyst.</dc:description>

         <title>Photoinduced NiH Catalysis with Trialkylamines for the Stereodivergent Transfer Semi&#8208;Hydrogenation of Alkynes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a selectivity&#8208;switchable nickel hydride&#8208;catalyzed methodology that enables the stereocontrolled semi&#8208;reduction of internal alkynes to E&#8208; or Z&#8208;alkenes under very mild conditions. The proposed transfer semi&#8208;hydrogenation process involves the use of a dual nickel/photoredox catalytic system and triethylamine, not only as a sacrificial reductant, but also as a source of hydrogen atoms. Mechanistic studies revealed a pathway involving photo&#8208;induced generation of nickel hydride, syn&#8208;hydronickelation of alkyne, and alkenylnickel isomerization as key steps. Remarkably, mechanistic experiments indicate that the control of the stereoselectivity is not ensuing from a post&#8208;reduction alkene photoisomerization under our conditions. Instead, we demonstrate that the stereoselectivity of the reaction is dependent on the rate of a final protonolysis step which can be tuned by adjusting the pKa of an alcohol additive.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantio&#8208; and Diastereomerically Pure Titanocenes by Dynamic Conformational Locking</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conformational locking of unbridged substituted titanocenes is achieved by the introduction of chiral anionic ligands. A novel method for the synthesis of monosubstituted, enantio&#8208; and diastereomerically pure titanocenes with C2&#8208;symmetry in the (RC5H4)2Ti fragment by reacting the methylated complexes with camphorsulfonic acid is presented. This study encompasses data from NMR and X&#8208;ray analysis as well as a mechanistic investigation with the aid of state of the art DFT calculations.







Abstract
The synthesis of enantiomerically pure titanocenes is limited to cases with enantiomerically pure substituents at the cyclopentadienyl ligands and to ansa&#8208;titanocenes. For the latter complexes, the use of achiral ligands requires a resolution of enantiomers and frequently also a separation of the diastereoisomers obtained after metalation. Here, we introduce a new synthetic method that relies on the use of enantiomerically pure camphorsulfonate (CSA) ligands as control elements for the absolute and relative configuration of titanocene complexes. Starting from the conformationally flexible (RC5H4)2TiCl2, the desired conformationally locked and hence enantio&#8208; and diastereomerically pure complexes (RC5H4)2Ti(CSA)2 are obtained in just two steps. According to X&#8208;ray crystallography the (RC5H4)2Ti fragment is essentially C2&#8208;symmetric and nuclear magnetic resonance displays overall C2&#8208;symmetry. We applied density functional theory methods to unravel the dynamics of the complexes and the mechanisms and selectivities of their formation.

&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-symmetry. We applied density functional theory methods to unravel the dynamics of the complexes and the mechanisms and selectivities of their formation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Kinetic Analysis of the Photochemical Paths in Asymmetric Diarylethene Dimer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An asymmetric diarylethene dimer composed of two different diarylethenes exhibited multicolor photochromism and generated four isomers. Photochemical paths such as quantum yields, lifetimes, and rate constants were evaluated from the points of the dimer&#8208; and unit&#8208;based models. The m&#8208;phenylene spacer regulates the rate of energy transfer to be similar value of photoisomerization.







Abstract
An asymmetric diarylethene dimer composed of 2&#8208; and 3&#8208;thienylethene units linked by m&#8208;phenylene developed various colors upon UV irradiation via an independent photochromic reaction on each unit. The change in contents and the other photoresponses of the photogenerated four isomers were analyzed using quantum yield for all the possible photochemical paths, i.&#8201;e., photoisomerization, fluorescence, energy transfer, and the other non&#8208;radiative paths. Almost all the rate constants of photochemical paths were calculated using measurable quantum yields and lifetimes. It was found that a significant contribution on photoresponse was the competition between photoisomerization and intramolecular energy transfer. The clear difference was observed in the photoresponses of the dimer and the 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 mixture solution of the model compounds. The m&#8208;phenylene spacer appropriately regulated the rate of energy transfer in the asymmetric dimer, and the spacer enabled isolation of the excited state of the dimer, making the above quantitative analysis possible.

         <title>Acidic CO2 Electrolysis Addressing the &#8220;Alkalinity Issue&#8221; and Achieving High CO2 Utilization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Currently, CO2 electroreduction (CO2RR) mainly adopt alkaline or neutral electrolytes to suppress the hydrogen evolution (HER), but with significant drawback of (bi)carbonate crossover, leading to low carbon utilization efficiency. CO2RR in acidic electrolytes can alleviate the &#8220;alkalinity problem&#8221;, but the competing HER is more kinetically favourable. Thus, it is a priority to effectively suppress HER and accelerate acidic CO2 electrolysis.







Abstract
Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) provides a promising approach for sustainable chemical fuel production of carbon neutrality. Neutral and alkaline electrolytes are predominantly employed in the current electrolysis system, but with striking drawbacks of (bi)carbonate (CO32&#8722;/HCO3&#8722;) formation and crossover due to the rapid and thermodynamically favourable reaction between hydroxide (OH&#8722;) with CO2, resulting in low carbon utilization efficiency and short&#8208;lived catalysis. Very recently, CO2RR in acidic media can effectively address the (bi)carbonate issue; however, the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is more kinetically favourable in acidic electrolytes, which dramatically reduces CO2 conversion efficiency. Thus, it is a big challenge to effectively suppress HER and accelerate acidic CO2RR. In this review, we begin by summarizing the recent progress of acidic CO2 electrolysis, discussing the key factors limiting the application of acidic electrolytes. We then systematically discuss addressing strategies for acidic CO2 electrolysis, including electrolyte microenvironment modulation, alkali cations adjusting, surface/interface functionalization, nanoconfinement structural design, and novel electrolyzer exploitation. Finally, the new challenges and perspectives of acidic CO2 electrolysis are suggested. We believe this timely review can arouse researchers&#8242; attention to CO2 crossover, inspire new insights to solve the &#8220;alkalinity problem&#8221; and enable CO2RR as a more sustainable technology.

         <title>Regioselective Iridium&#8208;Catalyzed C8&#8208;H Borylation of 4&#8208;Quinolones via Transient O&#8208;Borylated Quinolines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The quinolone&#8211;quinoline tautomerization allows the regioselective C8&#8208;borylation of biologically important 4&#8208;quinolones by using [Ir(OMe)(cod)]2 as catalyst precursor, Si&#8208;SMAP as the ligand, and B2pin2 as boron source. Following O&#8208;borylation of the quinoline tautomer, N&#8208;directed selective Ir&#8208;catalyzed borylation takes place at C8. Hydrolysis of the OBpin moiety on workup returns the system to the quinolone tautomer.







Abstract
The quinolone&#8211;quinoline tautomerization is harnessed to effect the regioselective C8&#8208;borylation of biologically important 4&#8208;quinolones by using [Ir(OMe)(cod)]2 as the catalyst precursor, the silica&#8208;supported monodentate phosphine Si&#8208;SMAP as the ligand, and B2pin2 as the boron source. Initially, O&#8208;borylation of the quinoline tautomer takes place. Critically, the newly formed 4&#8208;(pinBO)&#8208;quinolines then undergo N&#8208;directed selective Ir&#8208;catalyzed borylation at C8. Hydrolysis of the OBpin moiety on workup returns the system to the quinolone tautomer. The C8&#8208;borylated quinolines were converted to their corresponding potassium trifluoroborate (BF3K) salts and to their C8&#8208;chlorinated quinolone derivatives. The two&#8208;step C&#8208;H borylation&#8208;chlorination reaction sequence resulted in various C8&#8208;Cl quinolones in good yields. Conversion to C8&#8208;OH&#8208;, C8&#8208;NH2&#8208;, and C8&#8208;Ar&#8208;substituted quinolones was also feasible by using this methodology.

         <title>Electrochemical Preparation of Sm(II) Reagent Facilitated by Weakly Coordinating Anions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical analysis of the potential and reversibility of the Sm(11)/Sm(111) redox couple will inform the development of electrocatalytic Sm&#8208;driven reactions in organic synthesis.







Abstract
Samarium diiodide (SmI2) is widely used as a strong one&#8208;electron reducing agent and is often employed to form C&#8722;C bonds in complex systems. Despite their utility, SmI2 and related salts suffer from several drawbacks that render the use of Sm reducing agents in large&#8208;scale synthesis impractical. Here, we report factors influencing the electrochemical reduction of Sm(III) to Sm(II), towards the goal of electrocatalytic Sm(III) reduction. We probe the effect of supporting electrolyte, electrode material, and Sm precursor on Sm(II)/(III) redox and on the reducing power of the Sm species. We find that the coordination strength of the counteranion of the Sm salt affects the reversibility and redox potential of the Sm(II)/(III) couple and establish that the counteranion primarily determines the reducibility of Sm(III). Electrochemically generated SmI2 performs similarly to commercial SmI2 solutions in a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept reaction. The results will provide fundamental insight to facilitate the development of Sm&#8208;electrocatalytic reactions.

O&#8208;acetyl&#8208;l&#8208;homoserine sulfhydrolase is used for the production of l&#8208;methionine analogues from l&#8208;homocysteine and off&#8208;the shelf organic thiols. Combined with methyltransferase&#8208;catalysed alkylation cascades, this enables the transfer of a wide range of moieties onto various substrates.







Abstract
Chemical modification of small molecules is a key step for the development of pharmaceuticals. S&#8208;adenosyl&#8208;l&#8208;methionine (SAM) analogues are used by methyltransferases (MTs) to transfer alkyl, allyl and benzyl moieties chemo&#8208;, stereo&#8208; and regioselectively onto nucleophilic substrates, enabling an enzymatic way for specific derivatisation of a wide range of molecules. l&#8208;Methionine analogues are required for the synthesis of SAM analogues. Most of these are not commercially available. In nature, O&#8208;acetyl&#8208;l&#8208;homoserine sulfhydrolases (OAHS) catalyse the synthesis of l&#8208;methionine from O&#8208;acetyl&#8208;l&#8208;homoserine or l&#8208;homocysteine, and methyl mercaptan. Here, we investigated the substrate scope of ScOAHS from Saccharomyces cerevisiae for the production of l&#8208;methionine analogues from l&#8208;homocysteine and organic thiols. The promiscuous enzyme was used to synthesise nine different l&#8208;methionine analogues with modifications on the thioether residue up to a conversion of 75&#8201;%. ScOAHS was combined with an established MT dependent three&#8208;enzyme alkylation cascade, allowing transfer of in total seven moieties onto two MT substrates. For ethylation, conversion was nearly doubled with the new four&#8208;enzyme cascade, indicating a beneficial effect of the in&#8197;situ production of l&#8208;methionine analogues with ScOAHS.

         <title>Helical Self&#8208;Assembly and Fe3+ Detection of V&#8208;Shaped AIE&#8208;Active Chiral Tetraphenylbutadiene&#8208;Based Polyamides

A series of V&#8208;shaped tetraphenylbutadiene&#8208;based aggregation&#8208;induced emission&#8208;active chiral polyamides bearing n&#8208;propyl/hexyl/dodecyl side&#8208;chains are reported. They possess AIE features, display helical conformation polymer chains and self&#8208;assemble into helical nano&#8208;fibers, and present enhanced CD signal with positive Cotton effect. And P1&#8208;C6 is a fluorescence probe for Fe3+.







Abstract
Chiral aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) molecules have drawn attention for their helical self&#8208;assembly and special optical properties. The helical self&#8208;assembly of AIE&#8208;active chiral non&#8208;linear main&#8208;chain polymers can produce some desired optical features. In this work, a series of V&#8208;shaped chiral AIE&#8208;active polyamides P1&#8208;C3, P1&#8208;C6, P1&#8208;C12 and linear P2&#8208;C3, P2&#8208;C6, bearing n&#8208;propyl/hexyl/dodecyl side&#8208;chains, based on tetraphenylbutadiene (TPB), were prepared. All target main&#8208;chain polymers exhibit distinct AIE characteristics. The polymer P1&#8208;C6 with moderate length alkyl chains shows better AIE properties. The V&#8208;shaped main&#8208;chains and the chiral induction of (1R,2R)&#8208;(+)&#8208;1,2&#8208;cyclohexanediamine in each repeating unit promote the polymer chains display helical conformation, and multiple helical polymer chains induce nano&#8208;fibers helicity when the polymer chains aggregate and self&#8208;assemble in THF/H2O mixtures. Simultaneously, the helical conformation polymer chains and helical nano&#8208;fibers cause P1&#8208;C6 produce strong circular dichroism (CD) signals with positive Cotton effect. Moreover, P1&#8208;C6 could also occur fluorescence quenching response to Fe3+ selectively with a low detection limit of 3.48&#8197;&#956;mol/L.

         <title>Direct Alkylative Amination Using 1&#8208;Allylsilatrane
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DRA is so pass&#233;. Three&#8208;component reactions involving the condensation of unprotected aniline and benzaldehyde substrates being intercepted by 1&#8208;allylsilatrane in a direct alkylative amination afford a variety of homoallylic amines under robust, air&#8208; and water&#8208;tolerant conditions. A single precursor is then used to highlight the versatility of the scaffold by generating azetidine, pyrrolidine, piperidine, and quinoline analogues.







Abstract
Homoallylic amines prepared via addition of allylsilanes often require preformed imine substrates, metal catalysts, fluoride activators, or use of protected amines. In this metal&#8208;free, air&#8208; and water&#8208;tolerant procedure, aromatic aldehyde and aniline substrates undergo direct alkylative amination using easily accessible 1&#8208;allylsilatrane.

         <title>Substrate Selectivity Imparted by Self&#8208;Assembled Molecular Containers and Catalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recent trends in catalysis are devoted to mimicking some peculiar features of enzymes like site selectivity, through functional group recognition, and substrate selectivity, through recognition of the entire surface of the substrate. The latter is a specific feature of enzymes that is seldomly present in homogeneous catalysis. Supramolecular catalysis, thanks to the self&#8208;assembly of simple subunits, enables the creation of cavities and surfaces whose confinement effects drive the preferential binding of a substrate among others with consequent substrate selectivity. The topic is an emerging field that exploits recognition phenomena to discriminate the reagents based on their size and shape. This review deals this cutting&#8208;edge field of research covering examples of supramolecular self&#8208;assembled molecular containers and catalysts operating in organic as well as aqueous media, with special emphasis for catalytic systems dealing with direct competitive experiments involving two or more substrates.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly Selective Nickel&#8208;Catalyzed Isomerization&#8208;Hydroboration of Alkenes Affords Terminal Functionalization at Remote C&#8208;H Position</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report herein the synthesis and characterization of nickel complexes supported by tridentate and bidentate phosphino(silyl) ancillary ligands, along with the successful application of these complexes as precatalysts for the hydroboration of terminal and internal alkenes using pinacolborane (HBPin). These reactions proceeded with low nickel loadings of 2.5&#8208;5 mol % in the absence of co&#8208;solvent, and in some cases at room temperature. Isomerization to afford exclusively the terminal hydroboration product was obtained across a range of internal alkenes, including tri&#8208; and tetra&#8208;substituted examples. This reactivity is unprecedented for nickel and offers a powerful means of achieving functionalization at a C&#8208;H position remote from the C=C double bond. Nickel&#8208;catalyzed deuteroboration experiments using DBPin support a mechanism involving 1,2&#8208;insertion of the alkene and subsequent chain&#8208;walking, which results in isotopic scrambling.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A highly enantioselective cyanation of imines (up to &gt;99% ee) has been developed using well&#8208;designed C2&#8208;symmetric hydrogen bonding catalysts. The catalytic strategy was characterized with low catalyst loading (0.1&#8208;1 mol%), easily accessible catalysts with diverse functional groups, and catalytic base additives. A wide range of imines, including the challenging N&#8208;Boc and N&#8208;Cbz protected ketimines and aldimines, as well as fluoroalkylated ketimines, were investigated under mild conditions to afford the products with good to excellent yields (up to 99% yield) and high enantioselectivity (up to &gt;99% ee). Control experiments revealed that the multiple hydrogen bonding catalysts enhanced the reactivity and enantioselectivity of the Strecker reaction initiated by the base.</dc:description>

A wide range of imines, including the challenging N-Boc and N-Cbz protected ketimines and aldimines, as well as fluoroalkylated ketimines, were investigated under mild conditions to afford the products with good to excellent yields (up to 99% yield) and high enantioselectivity (up to &amp;gt;99% ee). Control experiments revealed that the multiple hydrogen bonding catalysts enhanced the reactivity and enantioselectivity of the Strecker reaction initiated by the base.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>The prominent role of gold&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) complexes in numerous research areas such as homogeneous (photo)catalysis, medicinal chemistry and materials science has prompted organometallic chemists to design gold&#8208;based synthons that permit access to target complexes through simple synthetic steps under mild conditions. In this review, the main gold&#8208;NHC synthons employed in organometallic synthesis are discussed.

         <title>Heterocyclic Merging of Stereochemically Diverse Chiral Piperazines and Morpholines with Indazoles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a heterocyclic merging approach to construct novel indazolo&#8208;piperazines and indazolo&#8208;morpholines. Starting from chiral diamines and amino alcohols, novel regiochemically (1,3 and 1,4) and stereochemically diverse (relative and absolute) cohorts of indazolo&#8208;piperazines and indazolo&#8208;morpholines were obtained within 6&#8208;7 steps. The key transformations involved are a Smiles rearrangement to generate the indazole core structure and a late stage Michael addition to build the piperazine and morpholine heterocycles. We further explored additional vector diversity by incorporating substitutions on the indazole aromatic ring, generating a total of 20 unique enantiomerically pure heterocyclic scaffolds.</dc:description>

         <title>Tuning the Polarity of Antibiotic&#8208;Cy5 Conjugates Enables Highly Selective Labeling of Binding Sites</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A systematic study on 13 new antibiotic&#8208;Cy5 dye conjugates derived from ampicillin, erythromycin, trimethoprim, and vancomycin revealed that in particular the incorporation of Cy5 dyes of low polarity leads to significantly improved properties regarding photostability, optical brightness, and distinctiveness. In turn, the related conjugates could be identified as outstanding tools for a variety of studies including fluorescence and super&#8208;resolution spectroscopy, differentiation of Gram+/&#8208; bacteria and competition binding.







Abstract
Multidrug&#8208;resistant bacteria pose a major threat to global health, even as newly introduced antibiotics continue to lose their therapeutic value. Against this background, deeper insights into bacterial interaction with antibiotic drugs are urgently required, whereas fluorescently labeled drug conjugates can serve as highly valuable tools. Herein, the preparation and biological evaluation of 13&#8197;new fluorescent antibiotic&#8208;Cy5 dye conjugates is described, in which the tuning of the polarity of the Cy5 dye proved to be a key element to achieve highly favorable properties for various fields of application.

         <title>Spectroscopic and Computational Study of the Organocatalytic Umpolung of Bromocations: An Accelerated Stereoselective Dibromination Protocol
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A newly developed method towards the in&#8197;situ umpolung of cationic bromine from N&#8208;bromosuccinimide (NBS) using an amine organocatalyst is reported. The intermediate reagents and their reactivity have well been characterised by spectroscopic and computational methods. Strategic structural change in the NBS molecule can cause sufficient polarity reversal to accelerate the dibromination reaction needing both &#8220;Br&#8221; synthons. This has further been utilised in an accelerated dibromination reaction of olefins with a broad substrate scope.







Abstract
Herein, organocatalytically achieved polarity reversal of cationic bromine is presented. The proven bromocation source N&#8208;bromosuccinimide (NBS) was converted to a superior bromoanion reagent by H/Br exchange with a secondary amine, substantiated with spectroscopic and computational evidence. The concept has further been used in a successfully accelerated organocatalyzed dibromination of olefins in a non&#8208;hazardous, commercially viable process with a wide range of substrate scope. The reactivity of key entities observed through NMR kinetics and reaction acceleration using only 10&#8197;mol&#8201;% of catalyst account for its major success. The nucleophilicity of the bromoanion was found to be superior in comparison to other nucleophiles such as MeOH and H2O also the protocol dominates over the competing allylic bromination reaction.

         <title>The Role of the Amino Acid Molecular Characteristics on the Formation of Fluorescent Gold&#8208; and Silver&#8208;Based Nanoclusters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorescent gold and silver nanoclusters: Formation of few&#8208;atomic (5&#8211;7 atoms) metallic nanoclusters having molecular&#8208;like behaviour and intense fluorescence features is confirmed for Phe, Arg and Gln amino acids. Relatively high QY% (&#8764;18&#8201;%) was obtained for Arg&#8208;AuNCs which is outstanding value among the small molecule&#8208;stabilized Au NCs published in the literature so far.







Abstract
Role of amino acids like L&#8208;phenylalanine (Phe), L&#8208;glutamine (Gln) and L&#8208;arginine (Arg) is described and interpreted in terms of their potential for preparation of fluorescent molecular&#8208;like gold and silver nanostructures. We are among the first to demonstrate the effect of syntheses conditions as well as the molecular characteristics of Phe, Gln and Arg amino acids on the structure of the formed products. Comprehensive optical characterizations (lifetime, quantum yield (QY%)) of the blue&#8208;emitting products were also carried out. It was confirmed that for all Au&#8208;containing samples and for Gln&#8208;Ag system the characteristic fluorescence originates from few&#8208;atomic metallic nanoclusters (NCs) where the reduction of metal ions was promoted by citrate in some cases. Relatively high QY% (&#8764;18&#8201;%) was obtained for Arg&#8208;stabilized Au NCs due to the existence of an electrostatic interaction between the electron rich, positively charged guanidium side chain of Arg and the negatively charged carboxylate group of citrate on the metallic surface. Size and structural analysis of the products were evaluated by infrared measurements and dynamic light scattering techniques.

         <title>Anthradithiophene (ADT)&#8208;Based Polymerized Non&#8208;Fullerene Acceptors for All&#8208;Polymer Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sustainable monomer called ADT, easily synthesized from cheap starting materials in high yield via simple filtration through basic alumina, was used as the electron&#8208;rich building block in polymerized non&#8208;fullerene molecular acceptors. ADT may serve as an electron&#8208;rich monomer for more green and scalable organic semiconductors.







Abstract
Realizing efficient all&#8208;polymer solar cell (APSC) acceptors typically involves increased building block synthetic complexity, hence potentially unscalable syntheses and/or prohibitive costs. Here we report the synthesis, characterization, and implementation in APSCs of three new polymer acceptors P1&#8211;P3 using a scalable donor fragment, bis(2&#8208;octyldodecyl)anthra[1,2&#8208;b&#8201;:&#8201;5,6&#8208;b&#8217;]dithiophene&#8208;4,10&#8208;dicarboxylate (ADT) co&#8208;polymerized with the high&#8208;efficiency acceptor units, NDI, Y6, and IDIC. All three copolymers have comparable photophysics to known polymers; however, APSCs fabricated by blending P1, P2 and P3 with donor polymers PM5 and PM6 exhibit modest power conversion efficiencies (PCEs), with the champion P2&#8208;based APSC achieving PCE=5.64&#8201;%. Detailed morphological and microstructural analysis by AFM and GIWAXS reveal a non&#8208;optimal APSC active layer morphology, which suppresses charge transport.

     alt="Anthradithiophene (ADT)-Based Polymerized Non-Fullerene Acceptors for All-Polymer Solar Cells"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A sustainable monomer called ADT, easily synthesized from cheap starting materials in high yield via simple filtration through basic alumina, was used as the electron-rich building block in polymerized non-fullerene molecular acceptors. ADT may serve as an electron-rich monomer for more green and scalable organic semiconductors.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Realizing efficient all-polymer solar cell (APSC) acceptors typically involves increased building block synthetic complexity, hence potentially unscalable syntheses and/or prohibitive costs. Here we report the synthesis, characterization, and implementation in APSCs of three new polymer acceptors &lt;b&gt;P1&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;P3&lt;/b&gt; using a scalable donor fragment, bis(2-octyldodecyl)anthra[1,2-b&#8201;:&#8201;5,6-b&#8217;]dithiophene-4,10-dicarboxylate (&lt;b&gt;ADT&lt;/b&gt;) co-polymerized with the high-efficiency acceptor units, NDI, Y6, and IDIC. All three copolymers have comparable photophysics to known polymers; however, APSCs fabricated by blending &lt;b&gt;P1&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;P2&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;P3&lt;/b&gt; with donor polymers &lt;b&gt;PM5&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;PM6&lt;/b&gt; exhibit modest power conversion efficiencies (PCEs), with the champion &lt;b&gt;P2&lt;/b&gt;-based &lt;b&gt;APSC&lt;/b&gt; achieving PCE=5.64&#8201;%. Detailed morphological and microstructural analysis by AFM and GIWAXS reveal a non-optimal APSC active layer morphology, which suppresses charge transport. Despite the modest efficiencies, these APSCs demonstrate the feasibility of using &lt;b&gt;ADT&lt;/b&gt; as a scalable and inexpensive electron rich/donor building block for APSCs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>FP(&#956;&#8208;N)2S: A Sulfur&#8208;Pnictogen Four&#8208;Membered Ring with 6&#960; Electrons</title>

         <dc:description>
An elusive 6&#960;&#8208;electron four&#8208;membered ring compound FP(&#956;&#8208;N)2S is prepared, and it can undergo ring&#8208;opening to the thiazyl isomer FPNSN upon irradiation at 550&#8197;nm. In sharp contrast to the square planar structure for the 6&#960;&#8208;electron analogue S2N2, FP(&#956;&#8208;N)2S displays a puckered structure with significant biradical character.







Abstract
The new 6&#960;&#8208;electron four&#8208;membered ring compound 3&#8208;fluoro&#8208;1&#955;2,2,4,3&#955;3&#8208;thiadiazaphosphetidine, FP(&#956;&#8208;N)2S, has been generated in the gas phase through high&#8208;vacuum flash pyrolysis (HVFP) of thiophosphoryl diazide, FP(S)(N3)2, at 1000&#8197;K. Subsequent isolation of FP(&#956;&#8208;N)2S in cryogenic matrices (Ar, Ne, and N2) allows its characterization with matrix&#8208;isolation IR and UV&#8208;vis spectroscopy by combination with 15N&#8208;isotope labeling and computations at the CCSD(T)&#8208;F12a/VTZ&#8208;F12 level of theory. Upon visible&#8208;light irradiation at 550&#8197;nm, this cyclic compound undergoes ring&#8208;opening to the thiazyl isomer FPNSN, followed by dissociation to FP and SN2 under subsequent UV&#8208;irradiation at 365&#8197;nm. In sharp contrast to the square planar structure for the isolobal four&#8208;membered ring S2N2, a puckered structure with significant biradical character has been found for FP(&#956;&#8208;N)2S.

         <title>Smart Wearable Patches Using Light&#8208;Controlled Activation and Delivery of Photoswitchable Antimicrobial Peptides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This unique proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept strategy is the first to combine photoisomerization and photocaging to regulate antibacterial activity and reduce toxicity. Concomitant light&#8208;controlled activation and delivery of an active antimicrobial peptide from a wearable patch via photolysis of a photocleavable linker allows topical delivery to the site of infection. The active agent can be deactivated immediately, potentially minimizing antimicrobial resistance.







Abstract
A novel strategy to treat Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) skin infections is presented, where UV light is used to facilitate concomitant light&#8208;controlled activation and delivery of an antimicrobial therapeutic agent. Specifically, a new photoswitchable gramicidin S analogue was immobilized onto a polymeric wearable patch via a photocleavable linker that undergoes photolysis at the same wavelength of light required for activation of the peptide. Unlike toxic gramicidin S, the liberated active photoswitchable peptide exhibits antimicrobial activity against S. aureus while being ostensibly non&#8208;haemolytic to red blood cells. Moreover, irradiation with visible light switches off the antimicrobial properties of the peptide within seconds, presenting an ideal strategy to regulate antibiotic activity for localized bacterial infections with the potential to mitigate resistance.

         <title>External Flash Generation of Carbenoids Enables Monodeuteration of Dihalomethanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High monodeuteration efficiency has been achieved by flash generation of active intermediate and the subsequent external quenching by deuteration reagent with suppressing decomposition of the intermediate (external generation method), which has been achieved under microflow conditions with rapid mixing.







Abstract
In this study, incorporation of one deuterium atom was achieved by H&#8722;D exchange of one of the two identical methylene protons in various dihalomethanes (halogen=Cl, Br, and I) through a rapid&#8208;mixing microflow reaction of lithium diisopropylamide as a strong base and deuterated methanol as a deuteration reagent. Generation of highly unstable carbenoid intermediate and suppression of its decomposition were successfully controlled under high flow&#8208;rate conditions. Monofunctionalization of diiodomethane afforded various building blocks composed of boryl, stannyl, and silyl groups. The monodeuterated diiodomethane, which served as a deuterated C1 source, was subsequently subjected to diverted functionalization methods to afford various products including biologically important molecules bearing isotope labelling at specific positions and homologation products with monodeuteration.

A non&#8208;conjugated bis&#8208;(dithienylethene)&#8208;naphthalenediimide based photo&#8208;responsive molecule is reported, having photoinduced electron transfer regulated enhancement of fluorescence property upon photocyclization, which can be utilized in secret code encryption&#8208;decryption and erasable ink applications.







Abstract
Photochromic fluorescent molecules dramatically extend their fields of applications ranging from optical memories, bioimaging, photoswitches, photonic devices, anti&#8208;counterfeiting technology and many more. Here, we have logically designed and synthesized a triazole appended bis&#8208;(dithienylethene)&#8208;naphthalenediimide based photo&#8208;responsive material, 5, which demonstrated fluorescence enhancement property upon photocyclization (&#934;F=0.42), with high photocyclization (44&#8197;s, ksolution=0.0355&#8197;s&#8722;1, ksolid=0.0135&#8197;s&#8722;1) and photocycloreversion (160&#8197;s, ksolution=0.0181&#8197;s&#8722;1, ksolid=0.0085&#8197;s&#8722;1) rate and decent photoreaction quantum yield (&#934;o&#8594;c=0.93 and &#934;c&#8594;o=0.11). The open isomer almost converted to the closed isomer at photo&#8208;stationary state (PSS) with distinct color change from colorless to blue with 92.85&#8201;% conversion yield. A reversible noninvasive modulation of fluorescence through efficient photoinduced electron transfer (PET) process was observed both in solution as well as in solid state. The fluorescence modulation through PET process was further corroborated with thermodynamic calculations using the Rehm&#8211;Weller equation and quantum chemical studies (DFT). The thermally stable compound 5 exhibits high fatigue resistance property (up to 50&#8197;cycles) both in solution and solid state. Furthermore, the compound 5 was successfully applied as erasable ink and in deciphering secret codes (Quick Response/bar code) portending potential promising application in anti&#8208;counterfeiting.

Abstract
A series of donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;donor (D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A&#8208;&#960;&#8208;D) compounds based on naphthalendiimide (NDI) and perylenediimide (PDI) central cores combined with triphenylamine and phenylcarbazole donor groups have been synthesized, characterized and tested in top&#8208;contact/bottom gate organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs). The results showed high electron mobilities, up to 0.3&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, in the case of NDI derivatives and moderate values of around 10&#8722;3&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 for PDI&#8208;based semiconductors. Quantum chemical calculations were performed in order to support the experimental data. The results suggest that adequate molecular characteristics and larger crystalline domains in NDI vs. PDI semiconducting films may be the reasons behind the enhanced electrical properties of NDI derivatives. Furthermore, when the lateral donor substituents are triphenylamine groups, the mobilities were slightly higher in comparison to phenylcarbazole donor groups due to an improved electron&#8208;donating character. Other characterization techniques, such as AFM, X&#8208;ray diffraction or spectroelectrochemistry, among others, have been performed to analyze supramolecular order, charge carriers&#8217; nature and stability, parameters closely related to charge transport characteristics.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of Helical Azaheptalene and Chiroptical Switching of an Isolable Radical Cation
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A N&#8208;centered helical heptalene, azaheptalene, was synthesized by a palladium&#8208;catalyzed one&#8208;pot reaction. Since the azaheptalene skeleton shows configurationally stable helicity, enantiomers could be successfully separated. Moreover, thanks to the electron&#8208;donating N atom, such helical azaheptalene with two bromine atoms undergoes one&#8208;electron oxidation to produce radical cation species with a drastic chiroptical response.







Abstract
A nitrogen&#8208;centered heptalene, azaheptalene, was designed as a representative of a new class of redox&#8208;responsive molecules with a large steric strain that originates from the adjacent seven&#8208;membered rings. The pentabenzo derivative of azaheptalene was efficiently synthesized by a palladium&#8208;catalyzed one&#8208;pot reaction of commercially available reagents. Bromination led to mono&#8208; and dibrominated derivatives, the latter of which is interconvertible with isolable radical cation species exhibiting near&#8208;infrared absorption. Since the azaheptalene skeleton shows configurationally stable helicity with a large torsion angle, enantiomers could be successfully separated. Thus, optically pure azaheptalenes with P&#8208; or M&#8208;helicity showed strong chiroptical properties (|gabs|&#8805;0.01), which could be changed by an electric potential.

         <title>Light&#8208;Cleavable Auxiliary for Diselenide&#8211;Selenoester Ligations of Peptides and Proteins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Straightforward access to seleno&#8208;based light&#8208;cleavable auxiliaries, including diverse amino acids, facilitates access to challenging protein targets via diselenide&#8211;selenoester ligations (DSL) and expressed protein selenoester ligations (EPSL).







Abstract
Diselenide&#8211;selenoester ligations are increasingly used for the synthesis of proteins. Excellent ligation rates, even at low concentrations, in combination with mild and selective deselenization conditions can overcome some of the most severe challenges in chemical protein synthesis. Herein, the versatile multicomponent synthesis and application of a new ligation auxiliary that combines a photocleavable scaffold with the advantages of selenium&#8208;based ligation strategies are presented. Its use was investigated with respect to different ligation junctions and describe a novel para&#8208;methoxybenzyl deprotection reaction for the selenol moiety. The glycine&#8208;based auxiliary enabled successful synthesis of the challenging target protein G&#8208;CSF.

         <title>Stability and Reversible Oxidation of Sub&#8208;Nanometric Cu5 Metal Clusters: Integrated Experimental Study and Theoretical Modeling</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bare clusters of five Cu atoms, synthesized electrochemically, display remarkable oxidation stability on highly oriented pyrolytic graphite. They exhibit reversible O2 adsorption, transitioning between various Cu oxidation states with changes in temperature and O2 pressure. In&#8208;situ XPS and XANES spectroscopy experiments, along with theoretical characterizations of Cu5&#8211;(O2)n complexes, provide direct evidence of the Cu5 clusters&#8217; O2 stability.

         <title>Asymmetric Transfer Hydrogenation as a Key Step in the Synthesis of the Phosphonic Acid Analogues to Aminocarboxylic Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>&#945;&#8208;Aminophosphonic acids have a remarkably broad bioactivity spectrum. They can function as highly efficient transition state mimics for a variety of hydrolytic and angiotensin&#8208;converting enzymes, which makes them interesting target structures for synthetic chemists. Especially the phosphonic acid analogues to &#945;&#8208;aminocarboxylic acids (PaAAs) are potent enzyme inhibitors, but many of them are only available by chiral or enzymatic resolutions, sometimes only one enantiomer is accessible, and several have never been prepared in enantiopure form at all. Today, a variety of methods to access enantiopure &#945;&#8208;aminophosphonic acids are known but none of the reported approaches can be generally applied for the synthesis of PaAAs. Here we show that the phosphonic acid analogues to many (proteinogenic) &#945;&#8208;amino acids become accessible by the catalytic, stereoselective asymmetric transfer hydrogenation (ATH) of &#945;&#8208;oxo&#8208;phosphonates. The obtained highly enantioenriched &#945;&#8208;hydroxyphosphonates (enantiomeric excess [ee] &#8805; 98%) are important pharmaceutical building blocks themselves and could be easily converted to &#945;&#8208;aminophosphonic acids in most studied cases. Even stereoselectively deuterated analogues became easily accessible from the same &#945;&#8208;oxo&#8208;phosphonates using formic acid (DCO2H).</dc:description>

Even stereoselectively deuterated analogues became easily accessible from the same &#945;-oxo-phosphonates using formic acid (DCO2H).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Rise of Structurally Anisotropic Plasmonic Janus Gold Nanostars</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanostructures intrinsically possessing two different structural or functional features, often called Janus nanoparticles, are emerging as a potential material for sensing, catalysis, and biomedical applications. Herein, we report the synthesis of plasmonic gold Janus nanostars (NSs) possessing a smooth concave pentagonal morphology with sharp tips and edges on one side and, contrastingly, a crumbled morphology on the other. The methodology reported herein for its synthesis using a single&#8208;step growth reaction is unique to any other Janus nanoparticle preparation involving either template&#8208;assisted growth or a masking technique.&#160;&#160;Interestingly, a coexistence of lower and higher index facets has been found in these Janus NSs.&#160;&#160;The general paradigm for synthesizing Au Janus NSs was investigated by understanding the mechanism of its kinetic control with the combinatorial effect of all the reagents responsible for its structure. Optical property of the Janus NSs has been realized by corelating their extinction spectrum with the simulated data. The size&#8208;dependent surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) activity of these Janus NSs has been studied with 1,4&#8208;BDT as the model analyte. Finite&#8208;difference time&#8208;domain (FDTD) simulations for different sized particles revealed the distribution of electromagnetic hot&#8208;spots over the particles resulting in the enhancement of the&#160;SERS&#160;signal in a size dependent manner.</dc:description>

         <title>Stepwise Functionalization of Single&#8208;Walled Carbon Nanotubes with Subsequent Molecular Conversion to Control Photoluminescence Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Functionalization of single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) has attracted interest because it alters the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photoluminescence (PL) wavelength and emission efficiency. These modifications depend on the binding configuration and degree of functionalization. Excessive functionalization reduces the emission efficiency as the integrity of the conjugated&#160;p&#8208;system decreases, making controlling the degree of functionalization essential. Because the binding configurations and degree of functionalization are affected by the reagent structure, a stepwise approach combining functionalization reactions of SWNTs and subsequent reactions to introduce functional groups into the addenda could effectively control their PL properties and functionalities. We studied this approach by implementing the reductive alkylation of SWNTs using bromoalkanes with&#160;t&#8208;butyl carbamate (Boc)&#8208;protected amino groups and subsequent deprotection and amidation reactions. The reaction products were analyzed based on absorption, PL, and Raman spectroscopy and the Kaiser test. Depending on the structure of the reagent, deprotection and amidation reactions competed with the elimination reaction of addenda, changing the PL properties of the SWNTs. Furthermore, the elimination reaction was inhibited in the adducts functionalized with dibromoalkane with Boc&#8208;protected amino groups, demonstrating that the use of appropriate reagents enables molecular conversion of the functional groups of SWNT adducts without affecting their PL properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Recognition of Aromatics in Spherical Nanocages.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In general, due to the lack of efficient specific molecular interactions, achieving host&#8208;guest molecular recognition inside large and neutral metal organic cages (MOCs) is challenging. Preferential molecular recognition of aromatics using the internal binding sites of interlocked icosahedral (i.e., spherical) M12L8MOCs within poly&#8208;[n]&#8208;catenane (1) is reported. The guest absorption has been monitored directly in the solid&#8208;state by consecutive single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (SCSC) reactions in a gas&#8208;solid environment, using single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SC&#8208;XRD) experiments. The preferential guest uptake is corroborated by Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations by determining the host&#8208;guest interaction energy (Ehost&#8208;guest) with the nitrobenzene (NB) &gt;&gt; p&#8208;xylene (p&#8208;xy) &gt;&gt; o&#8208;dichlorobenzene (o&#8208;DCB) trend (i.e., from 44 kcal/mol to 25 kcal/mol), assessing the XRD outcomes. Combining SC&#8208;XRD, DFT and solid&#8208;state 13C NMR, the exceptional stability of the M12L8 cages, together with the guest exchange/release properties are rationalized by the presence of mechanical bonds (efficient &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions) and by the pyridine&#8217;s rotor&#8208;like behaviour (with 3 kcal/mol rotational energy barrier). The structure&#8208;function properties of M12L8 makes 1 a potential candidate in the field of molecular sensors.</dc:description>

         <title>2&#8208;Silylated Dihydroquinazolinone as a Photocatalytic Energy Transfer Enabled Radical Hydrosilylation Reagent</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The successful development of a photoinduced silyl radical addition reaction by using 2&#8208;silylated dihydroquinazolinone as a silyl radical precursor is presented. Hydrosilylation of electron&#8208;deficient alkene and styrene substrates resulted in addition products in good to high yield. The herein discussed energy transfer type silyl radical precursors will be suitable for hydrosilylation reactions as well as further radical addition reactions.







Abstract
The hydrosilylation of alkenes is one of the most important methods for the synthesis of organosilicon compounds. In addition to the platinum&#8208;catalyzed hydrosilylation, silyl radical addition reactions are notable as economic reactions. An efficient and widely applicable silyl radical addition reaction was developed by using 2&#8208;silylated dihydroquinazolinone derivatives under photocatalytic conditions. Electron&#8208;deficient alkenes and styrene derivatives underwent hydrosilylation to give addition products in good to high yields. Mechanistic studies indicated that the photocatalyst functioned not as a photoredox catalyst but as an energy transfer catalyst. DFT calculations clarified that the triplet excited state of 2&#8208;silylated dihydroquinazolinone derivatives released a silyl radical through the homolytic cleavage of a carbon&#8208;silicon bond, and this was followed by the hydrogen atom transfer pathway, not the redox pathway.

         <dc:description>
N&#8208;1&#8208;Piperidonyl amides were firstly oxidized by mCPBA from N&#8208;1&#8208;piperidinyl amides. The new developed method was also extended to Rimonabant analogue, N&#8208;(piperidin&#8208;1&#8208;yl)&#8208;1H&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazole&#8208;3&#8208;carboxamide, and N&#8208;(azepan&#8208;1&#8208;yl)benzamide, especially for Rimonabant analogue. This work presented a significant advancement in the synthesis of oxidized N&#8208;1&#8208;piperidonyl amides that had important implications for the further development of potential drugs and the study of the oxidized metabolite.







Abstract
A simple and efficient one&#8208;pot oxidation synthesis of N&#8208;1&#8208;piperidonyl amides was successfully developed through the double oxidation of hydrazides (involving hydrazonium formation, azodioxy&#8208;carbonyl compounds generation, and &#945;&#8208;carbon oxidation) by using meta&#8208;chloroperbenzoic acid (mCPBA). The convenient oxidation method was also extended to Rimonabant analogue. The lactam oxidized Rimonabant analogue was first successfully synthesized for demonstrating the construction and characterized by NMR spectroscopic methods and the single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction study (ORTEP).

         <title>Spin Crossover and Fluorine&#8208;Specific Interactions in Metal Complexes of Terpyridines with Polyfluorocarbon Tails</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hand in the cover depicts how spin&#8208;crossover&#8208;active CoII complexes are held together by noncovalent fluorine&#8208;specific interactions between the perfluorinated alkyl chains on the ligand backbone. Once the hand releases the molecules into certain solvents, the fluorine&#8208;specific interactions are broken up through preferential interactions with the solvent molecules, which are present in large excess. More information can be found in the Research Article by J. van&#8197;Slageren, B. Sarkar and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202301246).

         <title>A Dormant Reagent Reaction&#8208;Diffusion Method for the Generation of Co&#8208;Fe Prussian Blue Analogue Periodic Precipitate Particle Libraries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A reaction&#8211;diffusion system forms a library of different&#8208;size catalytically active Prussian Blue analogue (PBA) particles at each generation of the precipitation pattern. The trick to creating a library of such a highly insoluble product is to add the reactants together (uncommon in an RD system), keeping one as a &#8220;dormant&#8221; citrate complex and activating on demand with strong acid diffusion (center). More information can be found in the Research Article by B. Baytekin and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202301261).

         <title>Capture and Stabilization of the Hydroxyl Radical in a Uranyl Peroxide Cluster
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A uranyl peroxide cluster has been synthesized that is capable of stabilizing the hydroxyl radical for more than a week in both solution and the solid state. The cluster has been structurally and spectroscopically characterized including with deuterated materials, which indicate the origin of the free radicals is from the breakdown of H2O2, and this demonstrates that radiolysis products in spent nuclear fuel may interact with actinide species.







Abstract
Here we describe the synthesis and characterization of a new uranyl peroxide cluster (UPC), U60Ox30*, which captures and stabilizes oxygen&#8208;based free radicals for more than one week. These radical species were first detected with a nitroblue tetrazolium colorimetric assay and U60Ox30* was characterized by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction as well as infrared (IR), Raman, UV&#8208;Vis&#8208;NIR, and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopies. Identification of the free radicals present in U60Ox30* was done via room temperature solid and solution state X&#8208;band EPR studies using spin trapping methods. The spin trapping agent 5,5&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1&#8208;pyrroline N&#8208;oxide (DMPO) was definitive for identifying the free radicals in U60Ox30*, which are hydroxyl radicals (&#8901;OH) that are stable for up to ten days that also persist upon addition of the metalloenzymes catalase and superoxide dismutase. Addition of the spin trapping agent &#945;&#8208;(4&#8208;pyridyl N&#8208;oxide)&#8208;N&#8208;tert&#8208;butylnitrone (POBN) further confirmed the radicals were oxygen based, and deuteration experiments showed that the origin of the free radicals was from the decomposition of H2O2 in water. These results demonstrate that highly oxidizing species such as the &#8901;OH radical can be stabilized in UPCs, which alters our understanding of the role of free radicals present in spent nuclear fuel.

         <title>Comprehensive Study and Development of a Metal&#8208;Free and Mild Nucleophilic Trifluoromethoxylation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8208;free trifluoromethoxylation by nucleophilic substitution under mild conditions was developed based on the inexpensive DNTFB/DMAP system. An efficient rationalization was developed to propose optimal conditions depending on the characteristics of the starting substrates. A mechanistic study proved the crucial role of potassium salts in the transient formation of the CF3OK species, which has promising properties.







Abstract
Among the general interest in fluorinated compounds, trifluoromethoxylated molecules play a specific role. However, despite this interest, the development of efficient reagents to perform trifluoromethoxylation reactions remains a challenge. Here, 2,4&#8208;dinitro&#8208;trifluoromethoxybenzene (DNTFB) is used as a trifluoromethoxylating reagent to perform nucleophilic substitution under mild metal&#8208;free conditions with different leaving groups, including direct dehydroxytrifluoromethoxylation. A mechanistic study rationalized the reaction and subsequently proposed only three reaction conditions, depending on the reactivity of the starting substrates.

         <title>The Best of Both Worlds: Combining the Power of MICs and WCAs to generate Stable and Crystalline CrI&#8208;tetracarbonyl Complexes with 
Accepting Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The isolation of two isomeric pyridyl&#8208;MIC chromium(I) tetracarbonyl complexes, which were fully characterized by IR&#8208; and EPR&#8208;spectroscopy and compared with their electrochemical&#8208;generated analogues is presented. Furthermore, theoretical calculations were conducted to get detailed information about the electronic structure of these rare complexes. This is the first time Cr(I) complexes with &#960;&#8208;acceptor ligands have been isolated and crystallographically characterized.







Abstract
Here we present stable and crystalline chromium(I) tetracarbonyl complexes with pyridyl&#8208;MIC (MIC=mesoionic carbene) ligands and weakly coordinating anions (WCA=[Al(ORF)4]&#8722;, RF=C(CF3)3 and BArF=[B(ArF)4]&#8722;, ArF=3,5&#8208;(CF3)2C6H3). The complexes were fully characterized via crystallographic, spectroscopic and theoretical methods. The influence of counter anions on the IR and EPR spectroscopic properties of the CrI complexes was investigated, and the electronic innocence versus non&#8208;innocence of WCAs was probed. These are the first examples of stable and crystalline [Cr(CO)4]+ complexes with a chelating 
accepting ligand, and the data presented here are of relevance for both the photochemical and the electrochemical properties of these classes of compounds.

Abstract
Biocatalysis has emerged as a valuable and reliable tool for industrial and academic societies, particularly in fields related to bioredox reactions. The cost of cofactors, especially those needed to be replenished at stoichiometric amounts or more, is the chief economic concern for bioredox reactions. In this study, a readily accessible, inexpensive, and bench&#8208;stable Hantzsch ester is verified as the viable and efficient NAD(P)H mimic by four enzymatic redox transformations, including two non&#8208;heme diiron N&#8208;oxygenases and two flavin&#8208;dependent reductases. This finding provides the potential to significantly reduce the costs of NAD(P)H&#8208;relying bioredox reactions.

&lt;p&gt;Biocatalysis has emerged as a valuable and reliable tool for industrial and academic societies, particularly in fields related to bioredox reactions. The cost of cofactors, especially those needed to be replenished at stoichiometric amounts or more, is the chief economic concern for bioredox reactions. In this study, a readily accessible, inexpensive, and bench-stable Hantzsch ester is verified as the viable and efficient NAD(P)H mimic by four enzymatic redox transformations, including two non-heme diiron &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-oxygenases and two flavin-dependent reductases. This finding provides the potential to significantly reduce the costs of NAD(P)H-relying bioredox reactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Degradation of Penicillinic Antibiotics and &#946;&#8208;Lactamase Enzymatic Catalysis in a Biomimetic Zn&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel Zn&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF), capable to catalyze the selective hydrolysis of the &#946;&#8208;Lactam antibiotics amoxicillin and ceftriaxone is reported. Remarkably, the MOF degrades, very efficiently, the four&#8208;membered &#946;&#8208;lactam ring of amoxicillin, acting as a &#946;&#8208;lactamase mimic and expands the very limited number of MOFs capable to mimic catalytic enzymatic processes. The whole process is unveiled by SCXRD and DFT calculations.







Abstract
&#946;&#8208;Lactam antibiotics are one of the most commonly prescribed drugs to treat bacterial infections. However, their use has been somehow limited given the emergence of bacteria with resistance mechanisms, such as &#946;&#8208;lactamases, which inactivate them by degrading their four&#8208;membered &#946;&#8208;lactam rings. So, a total knowledge of the mechanisms governing the catalytic activity of &#946;&#8208;lactamases is required. Here, we report a novel Zn&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF, 1), possessing functional channels capable to accommodate and interact with antibiotics, which catalyze the selective hydrolysis of the penicillinic antibiotics amoxicillin and ceftriaxone. In particular, MOF 1 degrades, very efficiently, the four&#8208;membered &#946;&#8208;lactam ring of amoxicillin, acting as a &#946;&#8208;lactamase mimic, and expands the very limited number of MOFs capable to mimic catalytic enzymatic processes. Combined single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SCXRD) studies and density functional (DFT) calculations offer unique snapshots on the host&#8208;guest interactions established between amoxicillin and the functional channels of 1. This allows to propose a degradation mechanism based on the activation of a water molecule, promoted by a Zn&#8208;bridging hydroxyl group, concertedly to the nucleophilic attack to the carbonyl moiety and the cleaving of C&#8722;N bond of the lactam ring.

The first crystal structure of the metastable hexalacunary Wells&#8208;Dawson [&#945;&#8208;H2P2W12O48]12&#8722; ({P2W12}). By using a proper combination of counter cations, the anion selectively transforms into a {WO(OH2)}4+&#8208;bridged Pacman&#8208;shaped [{WO(OH2)}(&#945;&#8208;HP2W12O48)2]22&#8722; ({P4W25}) dimer or a cyclic [{WO(OH2)}3(P2W12O48)3]30&#8722; ({P6W39}) trimer without coordination to transition metal cations.







Abstract
We report the first single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray structural evidence of the potassium salt of the hexalacunary [&#945;&#8208;H2P2W12O48]12&#8722; (abbreviated as {P2W12}) anion after its discovery by Contant and Ciabrini in 1977. In addition, we observed oligomerization of {P2W12} into a {WO(OH2)}4+&#8208;bridged Pacman&#8208;shaped [{WO(OH2)}(&#945;&#8208;HP2W12O48)2]22&#8722; ({P4W25}) dimer and a cyclic [{WO(OH2)}3(P2W12O48)3]30&#8722; ({P6W39}) trimer. The three phosphotungstate anions were synthesized through recrystallization of (NH4)12[&#945;&#8208;H2P2W12O48] from slightly alkaline (HOCH2)3CNH2/KCl, CH3NH3Cl/KCl, and CH3NH3Cl/NH4Cl solutions. The structure of {P2W12} is derived from [&#945;&#8208;P2W18O62]6&#8722; that has six tungsten atoms one from each polar group and four from the belt&#8211;removed, and the center of the lacunary site is capped by a potassium cation. Structures of {P4W25} and {P6W39} are constructed by connecting two and three {P2W12} units with {WO(OH2)}4+, respectively. The isolation of a pure {P6W39} phosphotungstate framework without coordination with transition metal cations is unprecedented. Powder X&#8208;ray diffraction confirmed the bulk purity of these compounds, indicating that selective crystallization was achieved through the selection of countercations and pH.

         <title>A Quadruple Catalysis Enabling Intermolecular Branch&#8208;Selective Hydroacylation of Styrenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quadruple N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene/cobalt/photoredox/Br&#248;nsted base catalysis is demonstrated, realizing branch&#8208;selective hydroacylation of styrenes with aromatic and aliphatic aldehydes. This protocol allows to access branched ketones from readily available materials in an atom&#8208;economical manner. The quadruple catalysis can transfer a formyl hydrogen of aldehydes as hydrogen radical equivalent onto terminal carbon of alkene by controlled electron and proton transfers.

Columnar liquid crystals with very small molecular masses that form anisotropic glasses well above room temperature are obtained by mixed dissymmetric substitution of sym&#8208;triazine with ester&#8208;bearing phenyl and phenanthryl or tetrahelicenyl moieties. The combination of low molecular symmetry with configurational flexibility and short polar ester moieties stabilizes the mesophase over large temperature ranges and induces pronounced calorimetric glass transitions within the anisotropic fluid despite the smallness of the molecules. In contrast to more symmetrical homologs, no ester tails longer than ethyl are necessary to induce the liquid crystalline state, allowing for the near&#8208;absence of any insulating and weight&#8208;increasing alkyl periphery. Films drop&#8208;cast from solution show in all cases emission spectra that do not show significant change of fluorescence emission upon annealing, indicating that the columnar hexagonal mesoscopic order is obtained directly upon deposition from solution and is resistant to crystallization upon annealing.

Combining amphiphilic molecules with metal complexes having switchable properties leads to the construction of a wide variety of self&#8208;assembled nanostructures. In this work, the thermally induced electron transfer&#8208;coupled spin transition (ETCST) of a [Co2Fe2] complex was used for the structural conversion of its supramolecular assembly between reverse vesicles and entangled one&#8208;dimensional chains.

         <title>Inept N2 Activation of Tri&#8208;Nuclear Nickel Complex with Labile Sulfur Ligands Facilitates Selective N2H4 Formation in Electrocatalytic Conversion of N2
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical nitrogen reduction: This work delineates the mechanism for electrochemical nitrogen reduction and competing Hydrogen evolution over a tri&#8208;nuclear Ni molecular catalyst [Ni3S8]2&#8722; by conducting a DFT study. Its interesting selectivity towards N2H4 over NH3 was reflected by our calculated pathways. We suggest weak N2 activation by Ni is responsible for such unusual selectivity.







Abstract
Conversion of N2 to the energy vector N2H4 under benign conditions is highly desirable. However, such N2 fixation processes are extremely rare. It has been recently reported that N2 to N2H4 conversion can be achieved electrochemically by using a trinuclear [Ni3(S2C3H6)4]2&#8722; complex (named as [Ni3S8]2&#8722;). There are hardly any precedents of Nitrogen Reduction Reaction (NRR) by molecular catalysts having Ni and the highly unusual selectivity for N2H4 over NH3 makes this electrochemical reduction unique. A systematic theoretical study employing calibrated Density Functional Theory to unearth the mechanisms of NRR (4e&#8722;/4H+) and Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (2e&#8722;/2H+) was conducted for the aforementioned trinuclear Ni complex. Our findings unravel a curious case of ligand lability working in tandem with metal centers in facilitating this unprecedented electrocatalytic activity. Furthermore, it is shown that the poor N&#8722;N bond activation property of Ni is responsible for this unusual selectivity. Additionally, the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER) mechanistic pathways have also been delineated in this report. The mechanistic intricacies thus unearthed in this study may assist in developing more efficient electrocatalysts for N2H4 production through NRR.

         <title>Aggregation Behavior of Cyclodextrin&#8208;Based [3]Rotaxanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The aggregation of a cyclodextrin (CD)&#8208;based [3]rotaxane was first observed and analyzed in this work. It was clarified that [3]rotaxane forms a hexagonal packing type aggregation derived from hydrogen bond formation among CD units in a similar manner to polyrotaxane species. This aggregation could be controlled by solvent type on dispersion treatment, axle end structures, and modification of CD.







Abstract
The aggregation of a cyclodextrin (CD)&#8208;based [3]rotaxane has been observed and analyzed in detail for the first time in this work. Although the hexagonal packing aggregation of CD&#8208;based polyrotaxane is a well known phenomenon, corresponding studies in terms of rotaxanes without any polymer structure have not been conducted so far, probably owing to the difficulty of the molecular design. We synthesized a series of [3]rotaxane species by using a urea&#8208;end&#8208;capping method and evaluated their aggregation behavior by XRD and SEM measurements. [3]Rotaxane species containing native CD rings showed clear signals assigned to the hexagonal packing by XRD measurement as did polyrotaxane; this proved their aggregation capability. Because the corresponding per&#8208;acetylated derivatives did not show this aggregation behavior, the driving force of this aggregation was suggested to be hydrogen bond formation among CD units. The effect of axle end structures and partial acetylation of CDs were also studied.

         <title>Amide Skeletal Elongation via Amino Acid Insertion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new amide bond activation paradigm through amino acid insertion enabled by two tandem intramolecular rearrangements is reported. This strategy only requires stable and readily available amide and amino acid as the starting materials, which does not need any pre&#8208;functionalization as well as the isolation of reaction intermediates.







Abstract
Amide derivatization is useful to access valuable organic compounds considering the ready availability of molecules containing amide functionality. Current methods to derivatize amide mainly focus on the synthesis of carbonyl&#8208;containing compounds and amines. Incorporating both parts of the initial amide into the new derivatives is rare. Herein, we describe a simple and practical amide derivatization through amino acid insertion to prepare more complex amides. This insertion is applicable to a wide range of amino acids and more importantly, the chiral information is completely conserved during the insertion. Comparison of this insertion strategy with conventional amide synthesis demonstrates the synthetic advantages of this new protocol.

         <title>Staightforward Synthesis of Halopyridine Aldehydes via Diaminomethylation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel two&#8208;step method for formylation of fluoropyridines with silylformamidine 1 under catalyst&#8208;free conditions was developed. A series of possible 18 fluoropyridines featuring one to four fluorine atoms were subjected to the reaction with 1 existing in equilibrium with its carbenic form 1&#8242;.12 Fluoropyridines were shown to react via C&#8208;H insertion. The reaction proceeded either at &#946;&#8208; or &#947;&#8208;positions affording the corresponding aminals. The more fluorine atoms in pyridines, the easier the reaction proceeded. We also hypothesized that the pyridines in which the fluorine was substituted by other halogens would react in a similar manner. To test the hypothesis, a set of 3,5&#8208;disubstituted pyridines with various combination of halogen atoms was prepared. 3,5&#8208;Difluoropyridine was taken as a compound for comparison. All the pyridines in the series also reacted likewise. In most cases, hydrolysis of the aminals afforded the corresponding aldehydes. As DFT calculations indicate, the reaction mechanism includes deprotonation of pyridine by 1&#8242; as a strong base and the following rearrangement of the formed tight ionic pair to the final product. An alternative reaction pathway involving addition of 1&#8242; to the pyridine carbon with the following hydrogen transfer via a three&#8208;membered transition state structure required much higher activation energy.</dc:description>

         <title>In Situ Generation of Magnesium&#8208; and Calcium&#8208;Based Grignard Reagents for Amide Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 40, July 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amides of magnesium are widely used reagents whereas the calcium congeners remained unappreciated for diverse reasons such as inertness of the metal and side reactions during Grignard&#8208;type applications. Intermediately prepared aryl&#8208; and alkylcalcium reagents, which are immediately consumed via metalation of amines (iGMM) or addition across imines (iGAM) circumvent many difficulties related to organocalcium chemistry.







Abstract
The alkaline&#8208;earth metals Mg and Ca are too inert for the direct metalation of primary and secondary amines. Consequently, activation prior to use is required. Alternatively, the Grignard reagents RMgX (R=alkyl, aryl, X=halide) can be applied in metalation of amines. However, such a straightforward procedure for the synthesis of alkylcalcium reagents is disadvantageous due to diverse side reactions, including Wurtz&#8208;type C&#8722;C coupling and ether degradation reactions. Therefore, suspensions of magnesium or calcium with amine can be treated in a smooth reaction with ethyl bromide in an ethereal solvent at room temperature. Intermediately formed RAeX (Ae=alkaline&#8208;earth metal, i.&#8201;e., Mg, Ca) either metalates amines yielding the corresponding amides in an in&#8197;situ Grignard metalation method (iGMM) or adds across C=N bonds of imines in an in&#8197;situ Grignard addition method (iGAM). The amides R&#8217;2N&#8208;AeX (Ae=Mg: Hauser bases) undergo Schlenk&#8208;type ligand exchange reactions yielding homoleptic Ae(NR&#8217;2)2 and potentially sparingly soluble AeX2.

         <title>Intermolecular Triazene Alkene Cycloaddition via Lewis Base Catalysis: Access to Diverse Trifluoromethylated Pyrazolines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 40, July 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient Lewis base catalytic transformation to functionalized 3&#8208; and 5&#8208;trifluoromethylpyrazolines is developed via [3+2] triazene&#8208;alkene cycloaddition reactions of an array of unactivated alkenes with CF3CHN2. This approach features good functional group tolerance and mild reaction conditions. Synthetic utility of the procedure is elucidated by structure diversification of known pharmaceuticals, natural products, and bioactive molecules.







Abstract
A novel approach to chemoselective synthesis of biologically important CF3&#8208;subsituted pyrazolines was developed via a Lewis base catalyzed intermolecular triazene cycloaddition reaction of an array of terminal/internal alkenes with CF3CHN2. This strategy features a catalytic amount of 1,8&#8208;diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec&#8208;7&#8208;ene, high yields (up to 95&#8201;%), wide substrate scope and excellent functional group tolerance (54 examples). Importantly, we preformed scaffold diversification of a panel of known pharmaceuticals, natural products, and bioactive heterocycles to generate the corresponding pyrazoline derivatives with potential broad bioactivities for further development.

         <title>Enhanced Performance of CsPbIBr2 Perovskite Solar Cell by Modified Zinc Oxide Nanorods Array with [6,6]&#8208;Phenyl C61 Butyric Acid</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 40, July 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
[6,6]&#8208;Phenyl C61 butyric acid (PBCA) is introduced to modify ZnO nanorods (ZnO NRs) electron transport layer to reduce surface defects, ameliorate the morphology of perovskite film, enhance charge extraction properties, and improve the photovoltaic performance of CsPbIBr2 perovskite solar cells.







Abstract
Although Metal oxide ZnO is widely used as electron transport layers in all&#8208;inorganic PSCs due to high electron mobility, high transmittance, and simple preparation processing, the surface defects of ZnO suppress the quality of perovskite film and inhibit the solar cells&#8217; performance. In this work, [6,6]&#8208;Phenyl C61 butyric acid (PCBA) modified zinc oxide nanorods (ZnO NRs) is employed as electron transport layer in perovskite solar cells. The resulting perovskite film coated on the zinc oxide nanorods has better crystallinity and uniformity, facilitating charge carrier transportation, reducing recombination losses, and ultimately improving the cells&#8217; performance. The perovskite solar cell with the device configuration of ITO/ZnO nanorods/PCBA/CsPbIBr2/Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD/Au delivers a high short circuit current density of 11.83&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and power conversion efficiency of 12.05&#8201;%.

         <title>New Generation of Benzidine Wide&#8208;Gap Conjugated Materials: Solution Processing a Classic Evaporated Scaffold</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 40, July 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benzidine&#8208;type wide&#8208;gap materials are designed in order to access green processing techniques, via functionalization with solubilizing pendant groups. Flexible thin films and organic electronic devices are then prepared from low&#8208;toxic solvent such as alcohols or o&#8208;xylenes.







Abstract
Carbazole&#8208; and fluorene&#8208;substituted benzidine blocks have been functionalized with two different solubilizing pendant groups, in order to enhance the material's solubility in greener solvents. Preserving the optical and electrochemical properties, the aromatic function and substitution showed an important influence on the solvent affinity, achieving concentrations up to 150&#8197;mg/mL in o&#8208;xylenes for the glycol&#8208;containing materials and decent solubility in alcohols for the compounds functionalized with ionic chains. The latter solution proved to be ideal for the preparation of luminescence slot&#8208;die coating film on top of flexible&#8208;substrates up to 33&#8197;cm&#215;2&#8197;cm. As a proof of concept, the materials have been implemented in different organic electronic devices, highlighting the low turn&#8208;on voltage (4&#8197;V) presented by organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs), which is comparable with vacuum&#8208;processed devices. A structure&#8208;solubility relationship and a synthetic strategy are disentangled in this manuscript to tailor organic semiconductors and adapt their solubility towards the desired solvent and application.

         <title>Lead&#8208;Free Double Perovskite Semiconductor with Rigid Spacer&#8208;Induced High&#8208;Tc Dielectric Switch Features</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 40, July 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multifunctional material (benzylammonium)4AgBiBr8, which has a step&#8208;like dielectric phase transition at 383&#8197;K/387&#8197;K (cooling/heating) and excellent photoelectric properties, was obtained by using rigid benzylammonium cations as templates.







Abstract
Layered hybrid perovskites possess exceptional semiconductor features and structural versality, making them viable candidates for developing multifunctional dielectric phase&#8208;transition materials (PTMS). However, most PTMs based on layered hybrid perovskites still suffer from Pb toxicity and low operating temperature. The recently developed hybrid double perovskites provide a new routine to designed PTMs with desired working performance and environment&#8208;friendly chemical compositions. Herein, using rigid aromatic cations as templates, we have successfully synthesized a novel double perovskite (benzylammonium)4AgBiBr8 (1), which consists of corner&#8208;sharing AgBr6 and BiBr6 layers and benzylammonium cations. Notably, 1 exhibits a high&#8208;temperature first&#8208;order reversible solid&#8208;state phase transition at 383/387&#8197;K (cooling/heating) and switchable dielectric performance around the temperature. Compared with the soft organic chain version of the compound, the phase transition temperature of 1 shows a large enhancement of 99&#8197;K, validating the correctness of the designing strategy. In addition, 1 also exhibits semiconductor characteristics with a calculated bandgap of 2.34&#8197;eV and an optical bandgap of 2.29&#8197;eV. Remarkably, the single crystal photodetector of 1 shows a low dark current (2.12&#215;10&#8722;13&#8197;A), a high on/off ratio (1.77&#215;103), and a fast response (&#964;rise=125&#8197;&#956;s and &#964;decay=419&#8197;&#956;s). Such a lead&#8208;free phase transition material combined with semiconductor properties provides a new strategy to develop environmentally friendly multifunctional materials.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Multifunctional material (benzylammonium)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;AgBiBr&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;, which has a step-like dielectric phase transition at 383&#8197;K/387&#8197;K (cooling/heating) and excellent photoelectric properties, was obtained by using rigid benzylammonium cations as templates.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Layered hybrid perovskites possess exceptional semiconductor features and structural versality, making them viable candidates for developing multifunctional dielectric phase-transition materials (PTMS). However, most PTMs based on layered hybrid perovskites still suffer from Pb toxicity and low operating temperature. The recently developed hybrid double perovskites provide a new routine to designed PTMs with desired working performance and environment-friendly chemical compositions. Herein, using rigid aromatic cations as templates, we have successfully synthesized a novel double perovskite (benzylammonium)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;AgBiBr&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;), which consists of corner-sharing AgBr&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; and BiBr&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; layers and benzylammonium cations. Notably, &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; exhibits a high-temperature first-order reversible solid-state phase transition at 383/387&#8197;K (cooling/heating) and switchable dielectric performance around the temperature. Compared with the soft organic chain version of the compound, the phase transition temperature of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; shows a large enhancement of 99&#8197;K, validating the correctness of the designing strategy. In addition, &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; also exhibits semiconductor characteristics with a calculated bandgap of 2.34&#8197;eV and an optical bandgap of 2.29&#8197;eV. Remarkably, the single crystal photodetector of &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; shows a low dark current (2.12&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;13&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;A), a high on/off ratio (1.77&#215;10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;), and a fast response (&lt;i&gt;&#964;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;rise&lt;/sub&gt;=125&#8197;&#956;s and &lt;i&gt;&#964;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;decay&lt;/sub&gt;=419&#8197;&#956;s). Such a lead-free phase transition material combined with semiconductor properties provides a new strategy to develop environmentally friendly multifunctional materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hydrogen Bonding Parameters by Rapid Colorimetric Assessment: Evaluation of Structural Components Found in Biological Ligands and Organocatalysts</title>

         <dc:description>
A high throughput UV&#8208;Vis method to measure hydrogen bonding capacity is disclosed using over 100 compounds of biological and catalytic relevance. A multiple linear regression model enables estimation of hydrogen bonding affinity from a single measurement using &#8764;2&#8197;mg of analyte that was showcased with a set of carboxylic acid bioisosteres.







Abstract
Hydrogen bonding is a key molecular interaction in biological processes, drug delivery, and catalysis. This report describes a high throughput UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopic method to measure hydrogen bonding capacity using a pyrazinone sensor. This colormetric sensor reversibly binds to a hydrogen bond donor, resulting in a blue shift as additional equivalents of donor are added. Titration with excess equivalents of donor is used to determine the binding coefficient, ln(Keq). Over 100 titrations were performed for a variety of biologically relevant compounds. This data enabled development a multiple linear regression model that is capable of predicting 95&#8201;% of ln(Keq) values within 1 unit, allowing for the estimation of hydrogen bonding affinity from a single measurement. To show the effectiveness of the single point measurements, hydrogen bond strengths were obtained for a set of carboxylic acid bioisosteres. The values from the single point measurements were validated with full titrations.

         <title>Exploration of N&#8208;Arylation of Backbone Amides as a Novel Tool for Conformational Modification in Peptides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 40, July 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
As an inquisitive approach, cyclic peptides containing N&#8208;aryl alanine amino acids were synthesized. Their conformations in solution were determined by NMR spectroscopy and compared with those of other N&#8208;modified peptides. The compounds showed relatively high conformational homogeneity and populated well&#8208;characterized antiparallel &#946;&#8208;sheet structures having discrete &#946;&#8208; and &#947;&#8208;turns and hydrogen bonding patterns; these have been classified into different templates.







Abstract
A set of 15 cyclic&#8208;hexaalanine and 10 cyclic&#8208;pentaalanine peptides containing one or two backbone N&#8208;aryl amide bonds were synthesized by following a combination of solution&#8208;phase and solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis. NMR&#8208;based conformation studies of these N&#8208;aryl cyclic&#8208;hexaalanine peptides revealed five distinct template conformations with an antiparallel &#946;&#8208;sheet structure; for N&#8208;aryl cyclic&#8208;pentaalanine peptides three template structures were revealed. All the template structures have distinct peptide&#8208;turn features. The conformations in these N&#8208;aryl peptides were compared to those in the commonly studied N&#8208;methyl peptide analogues. We observed that the N&#8208;aryl peptides exhibit a considerable conformational homogeneity, and their conformations differ significantly from those in N&#8208;methyl analogues. We anticipate that the N&#8208;arylation of backbone amides has the potential for application as a novel tool for conformation and physicochemical modification in peptides.

         <title>Structure&#8208;Property Relationships in a New Family of Photoactive Diimine&#8208;Diphosphine Copper(I) Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 40, July 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel heteroleptic copper(I) complexes based on the tetraazaphenanthrene ligand were synthesized and extensively studied. The correlation of the properties to the substitution of the diimine ligand and their impact on the photoreactivity of complexes in the presence of N,N&#8217;&#8208;diisopropylethylamine are rationalized, overall providing useful structure&#8208;property relationships for copper complexes as photoredox catalysts.







Abstract
A new family of heteroleptic diimine&#8208;diphosphine copper(I) complexes is reported, with six new complexes compared to benchmark [Cu(bcp)(DPEPhos)]PF6. These new complexes are based on 1,4,5,8&#8208;tetraazaphenanthrene (TAP) ligands with representative electronic properties as well as substitution patterns and DPEPhos and XantPhos as diphosphine ligands. Their photophysical and electrochemical properties were investigated and correlated with the number and position of substituents on the TAP ligands. Stern&#8208;Volmer studies using H&#252;nig's base as reductive quencher demonstrated the influence of the complex photoreduction potential and of the excited state lifetime on the photoreactivity. This study refines the structure&#8208;property relationship profile for heteroleptic copper(I) complexes and confirms that such profiles are of high interest to design new copper complexes as optimized photoredox catalysts.

Functional framework: A phosphate&#8208;functionalized metal&#8211;organic framework improves charge transport and enhances sulfur utilization as sulfur cathode additive for lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries.







Abstract
Lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries are promising candidates for next&#8208;generation energy storage devices due to their outstanding theoretical energy density. However, they suffer from low sulfur utilization and poor cyclability, greatly limiting their practical implementation. Herein, we adopted a phosphate&#8208;functionalized zirconium metal&#8211;organic framework (Zr&#8208;MOF) as a sulfur host. With their porous structure, remarkable electrochemical stability, and synthetic versatility, Zr&#8208;MOFs present great potential in preventing soluble polysulfides from leaching. Phosphate groups were introduced to the framework post&#8208;synthetically since they have shown a strong affinity towards lithium polysulfides and an ability to facilitate Li ion transport. The successful incorporation of phosphate in MOF&#8208;808 was demonstrated by a series of techniques including infrared spectroscopy, solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and X&#8208;ray pair distribution function analysis. When employed in batteries, phosphate&#8208;functionalized Zr&#8208;MOF (MOF&#8208;808&#8208;PO4) exhibits significantly enhanced sulfur utilization and ion diffusion compared to the parent framework, leading to higher capacity and rate capability. The improved capacity retention and inhibited self&#8208;discharge rate also demonstrate effective polysulfide encapsulation utilizing MOF&#8208;808&#8208;PO4. Furthermore, we explored their potential towards high&#8208;density batteries by examining the cycling performance at various sulfur loadings. Our approach to correlate structure with function using hybrid inorganic&#8211;organic materials offers new chemical design strategies for advancing battery materials.

Furthermore, we explored their potential towards high-density batteries by examining the cycling performance at various sulfur loadings. Our approach to correlate structure with function using hybrid inorganic&#8211;organic materials offers new chemical design strategies for advancing battery materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>De&#8208;Novo Design of pre&#8208;miR&#8208;21 Maturation Inhibitors: Synthesis and Activity Assessment</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 40, July 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A RNA&#8208;focused library targeted against the production of the oncogenic microRNA&#8208;21 was designed and synthesized according to a five&#8208;step sustainable approach. Low&#8208;micromolar affinities towards pre&#8208;miR&#8208;2, good selectivity against other nucleic acid structures and promising inhibition activity (in the two&#8208;digit micromolar range) in Dicer processing of the pre&#8208;miR&#8208;21 were determined for a trifluoromethyl&#8208;functionalized derivative.







Abstract
Targeting RNA with small molecules is a major challenge of current medicinal chemistry, and the identification and design of original scaffolds able to selectively interact with an RNA target remains difficult. Various approaches have been developed based on classical medicinal chemistry strategies (fragment&#8208;based drug design, dynamic combinatorial chemistry, HTS or DNA&#8208;encoded libraries) as well as on advanced structural biology and biochemistry methodologies (such as X&#8208;ray, cryo&#8208;EM, NMR, or SHAPE). Here, we report the de novo design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of RNA ligands by using a straightforward and sustainable chemistry combined with molecular docking and biochemical and biophysical studies that allowed us to identify a novel pharmacophore for RNA binding. Specifically, we focused on targeting the biogenesis of microRNA&#8208;21, the well&#8208;known oncogene. This led us not only to promising inhibitors but also to a better understanding of the interactions between the small&#8208;molecule compounds and the RNA target paving the way for the rational design of efficient inhibitors with potential anticancer activity.

         <title>Y&#8208;Shaped D&#8208;A Type Thioxanthone Derivatives: Mechano&#8208;Induced Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence and High&#8208;Contrast Mechano&#8208;Responsive Luminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 40, July 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Y&#8208;shaped D&#8208;A type molecules possessed two independent ICT states inside, resulted from the two independent D&#8722;A conjugation from their small donor arms to the acceptor. As their two D&#8722;A torsion angles are very sensitive to aggregated states, they showed interesting mechano&#8208;induced TADF and high&#8208;contrast MRL properties.







Abstract
High&#8208;contrast mechano&#8208;responsive luminescence (MRL) materials with mechano&#8208;induced emission enhancement properties are fascinating candidates but few, for applications in rewritable media and recording devices. Here, an interesting design strategy of &#8220;Y&#8208;shape&#8221; donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8722;A) type molecules for high&#8208;contrast MRL materials was presented, based on substituted diphenylamine donor and planar acceptor. Interestingly, their D&#8722;A torsion angles are small in crystals but increased after ground, resulted in planar and twist intramolecular charge transfer (PICT and TICT) states, respectively. Therefore, high&#8208;contrast MRL switching between weak blue (450&#8197;nm) fluorescence and bright yellow (552&#8197;nm) thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) can be achieved for compound TXDO (4,4&#8242;&#8208;dimethoxydiphenylamine donor), which photoluminescence quantum yield increased from 2.8&#8201;% to 54.7&#8201;% after ground. Most importantly, the two independent D&#8722;A conjugation dihedral angles are actually independent in the &#8220;Y&#8208;shape&#8221; molecules. Especially for compound TXDT (4,4&#8242;&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyldiphenylamine donor), its crystal exhibited both PICT and TICT processes inside, resulted from the different dihedral angles of 11.8&#176; and 35.5&#176;, respectively. The TXDT crystal thus showed dual&#8208;peak emission, including both TICT fluorescence and PICT room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence. Therefore, this strategy of &#8220;Y&#8208;shape&#8221; D&#8722;A type molecules provide a new approach to design advanced luminescent materials with mechano&#8208;induced TADF feature, for high&#8208;contrast MRL and single&#8208;component white luminescence.

         <title>Allosteric Tuning of Caspase&#8208;7: Establishing the Nexus of Structure and Catalytic Power</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 40, July 14, 2023. </description>

Remote control: How can allosteric sites be more effectively targeted by small&#8208;molecule drugs? Using an integrated in&#8197;vitro/in silico experimental workflow; we discovered novel allosteric inhibitors of caspase&#8208;7 and revealed new connections between the active site and the remote allosteric site (i.&#8201;e., allosteric structure&#8211;activity relationships, ASARs) for this valuable disease target.







Abstract
Caspase&#8208;7 (C7), a cysteine protease involved in apoptosis, is a valuable drug target for its role in human diseases (e.&#8201;g., Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, sepsis). The C7 allosteric site has great potential for small&#8208;molecule targeting, but numerous drug discovery efforts have identified precious few allosteric inhibitors. Here we present the first selective, drug&#8208;like inhibitor of C7 along with several other improved inhibitors based on our previous fragment hit. We also provide a rational basis for the impact of allosteric binding on the C7 catalytic cycle by using an integrated approach including X&#8208;ray crystallography, stopped&#8208;flow kinetics, and molecular dynamics simulations. Our findings suggest allosteric binding disrupts C7 pre&#8208;acylation by neutralization of the catalytic dyad, displacement of substrate from the oxyanion hole, and altered dynamics of substrate binding loops. This work advances drug targeting efforts and bolsters our understanding of allosteric structure&#8211;activity relationships (ASARs).

         <title>Constructing pH&#8208;Responsive and Tunable Azo&#8208;Phenol&#8208;Based o&#8208;Nitrobenzyl Photocages</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 40, July 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
pH&#8208;sensitive phenolic groups can be attached to the o&#8208;nitrobenzyl (oNB) group to form azo&#8208;phenolic NPX photocages with tunable pKa. One of the photocages in this study, NPdiCl, is identified as a promising pH&#8208;responsive photocage for photoreleasing cargo inside acidic tumor cells.







Abstract
Multiple triggered&#8208;release strategies are widely utilized to control the release of caged target molecules. Among them, photocages with conditional triggers provide extra layers of control in photorelease. In this work, a series of pH&#8208;responsive photocages was designed that could be triggered under irradiation and specific intracellular pH values. pH&#8208;sensitive phenolic groups were conjugated with o&#8208;nitrobenzyl (oNB) to form azo&#8208;phenolic NPX photocages with tunable pKa. These azo&#8208;phenol&#8208;based oNB photocages showed differentiable photoreleasing profiles at pH&#8197;5.0, 7.2 and 9.0. By attaching fluorogenic cargos, it was shown that one of the photocages, NPdiCl, could be used to differentiate between acidic pH&#8197;5.0 and neutral pH&#8197;7.2 in cells under artificial pH conditions. Finally, NPdiCl was identified as a promising pH&#8208;responsive photocage for photoreleasing cargo inside acidic tumor cells.

Two is better than one: Diimidazolium salt HBDIM 1, a precursor for di&#8208;NHCs ligand CageCarbene, from cheap and easily available agent hexabenzylhexaazaisowurtzitane (HBIW) was developed. Studies showed that the steric hinderance of CageCarbene is similar to that of SIMes but smaller than that of IPr, and electronically, CageCarbene is a strong &#963;&#8208;donator similar to SIMs and a stronger &#963;&#8208;donator than IPr. Bimetallic complexes 2&#8211;4 of Au, Cu or Pd bearing CageCarbene were synthesized and fully characterized, including X&#8208;ray diffraction of their single crystals. Further studies showed that complexes 2&#8211;4 were highly reactive to catalyze up to 17 reactions.







Abstract
The preparation of diimidazolium salt HBDIM 1, a precursor for a di&#8208;NHCs ligand, from cheap and easily available agent hexabenzylhexaazaisowurtzitane (HBIW) is reported. Under basic conditions, HBDIM undergoes facile deprotonation to in&#8197;situ generate CageCarbene, which could efficiently coordinate to transition&#8208;metals, such as, Au, Cu or Pd, to give the corresponding bimetallic complexes 2&#8211;4. These complexes were isolated and fully characterized, including X&#8208;ray diffraction of their single crystals. It was found that the steric hinderance of CageCarbene is similar to that of SIMes but smaller than that of IPr, and electronically, CageCarbene is a strong &#963;&#8208;donator similar to SIMes and a stronger &#963;&#8208;donator than IPr. Further studies showed that complexes 2&#8211;4 were highly reactive to catalyze up to 17 reactions. Control experiments utilizing a N&#8208;benzyl&#8208;substituted monoimidazolium salt showed much lower catalytic reactivity when it was bound to Au or Cu, but exhibited similar reactivity for the Pd complex. Kinetic studies showed that the low reactivity of the monodentate carbene&#8208;ligated Au or Cu complex was due to the low stability of the complex under the reaction conditions.

         <title>Etheno&#8208;bridged Azaacene Spiro Dimers</title>

Merging the world of cis&#8208;stilbenes and azaacenes: The synthesis of spiro&#8208;linked azaacene dimers conjugated via a secondary etheno&#8208;bridge is reported &#8211; introducing a conformationally locked cis&#8208;stilbene core fragment. Conjugation decreases the optical gap of the presented dimers and broadens absorption, albeit opens a new decomposition pathway.







Abstract
We present the synthesis of two sets of spiro&#8208;connected azaacene dimers. Their geometry and electronic coupling are critically determined by a secondary linker, i.&#8201;e., an etheno&#8208; and an ethano&#8208;bridge. The core fragment of the etheno&#8208;bridged dimer corresponds to a conformationally locked cis&#8208;stilbene. Optoelectronic properties, single crystal X&#8208;ray structures and stability with respect to oxidation of the conjugated and non&#8208;conjugated dimers are reported and compared. The conjugated dimers exhibit smaller optical gaps and bathochromically shifted absorption maxima, but are prone to unexpected oxygen addition, dearomatizing one of the azaacene substituents.

         <title>Interaction Modes Between SF4 and Ketones; Study of Intermediates in Deoxofluorination Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 40, July 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Acetone and SF4 form two thermally unstable adducts. In the presence of HF and SF4, 2&#8208;adamantanone forms an adduct with a unique O&#8212;(HF)&#8212;S interaction motif that elucidates possible interactions during deoxofluorination of ketones. Based on NPA charges, the C=O&#8212;HF and F3SF&#8212;HF interactions are deemed competitive.







Abstract
Interactions between ketones and SF4 are studied for the simplest ketone, acetone, and the bulky polycyclic 2&#8208;adamantanone. Acetone forms the 1&#8201;:&#8201;2 adduct SF4&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;[O=C(CH3)2]2, as well as the dimeric 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 adducts [SF4&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;O=C(CH3)2]2 as identified by low&#8208;temperature Raman spectroscopy and, for the latter, X&#8208;ray crystallography. In both adducts, SF4 acts as a double chalcogen&#8208;bond donor to two keto groups. In contrast 2&#8208;adamantanone does not form an isolable solid adduct with SF4; in the presence of HF, however, it forms SF4&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;O=C10H14O&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;HF, which comprises chains with weak S&#8212;O and S&#8212;FH chalcogen bonds in the crystal structure. Sulfur tetrafluoride in this compound is readily lost at &#8722;85&#8201;&#176;C, leading to the isolation of C10H14O&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;HF at low temperature. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations aid in vibrational assignments and serve to describe the interactions of the keto group with SF4 and HF, as well as interactions between SF4 with HF. It is found that separate and combined CO&#8212;HF and CO&#8212;SF4 chalcogen bonds do not polarize the C=O group to any significant degree.

         <title>Antitumor Activity and Reductive Stress by Platinum(II) N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbenes based on Guanosine
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 40, July 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Platinum(II) complexes bearing NHCs based on guanosine undergo a substantial increase in antiproliferative activity when changing the ligand trans to the NHC from bromide to hydride. Compound 6 leads to an increase in reductive stress and increase in glutathione levels in cancer cells but not in non&#8208;cancer cells.







Abstract
Platinum(II) complexes bearing N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes based guanosine and caffeine have been synthesized by unassisted C&#8722;H oxidative addition, leading to the corresponding trans&#8208;hydride complexes. Platinum guanosine derivatives bearing triflate as counterion or bromide instead of hydride as co&#8208;ligand were also synthesized to facilitate correlation between structure and activity. The hydride compounds show high antiproliferative activity against all cell lines (TC&#8208;71, MV&#8208;4&#8208;11, U&#8208;937 and A&#8208;172). Methyl Guanosine complex 3, bearing a hydride ligand, is up to 30&#8197;times more active than compound 4, with a bromide in the same position. Changing the counterion has no significant effect in antiproliferative activity. Increasing bulkiness at N7, with an isopropyl group (compound 6), allows to maintain the antiproliferative activity while decreasing toxicity for non&#8208;cancer cells. Compound 6 leads to an increase in endoplasmic reticulum and autophagy markers on TC71 and MV&#8208;4&#8208;11 cancer cells, induces reductive stress and increases glutathione levels in cancer cells but not in non&#8208;cancer cell line HEK&#8208;293.

         <title>Late&#8208;Stage, Stereoretentive, and Site&#8208;Selective Modification of Synthetic Peptides by Using Photoredox Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 40, July 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoredox&#8208;catalysed reaction of activated thioethers unveils alanyl radical intermediates in a stereoretentive and site&#8208;selective manner. Installation of the activating group is simple, and the intermediate radical can react with non&#8208;activated alkenes to form non&#8208;natural residues bearing aliphatic, hydrophobic units. The method is applicable to late&#8208;stage peptide functionalisation and expands the scope of analogues that can be accessed.







Abstract
Late&#8208;stage functionalisation is an attractive method to generate peptide analogues containing non&#8208;natural residues. It is shown that cysteine residues can be activated as Crich&#8208;type thioethers, either by alkylation of a synthetic cysteine&#8208;continuing peptide or by incorporation of a modified cysteine unit into solid phase or solution phase peptide synthesis. Photoredox catalysed reaction of the thioether generates an alanyl radical intermediate in a stereoretentive and site&#8208;selective manner, even in the presence of free cysteine residues. The radical can react with non&#8208;activated alkenes to form non&#8208;natural residues bearing aliphatic, hydrophobic units. A method to avoid unwanted alkylation of amine residues was identified and the process was applied to the functionalization of both linear and cyclic synthetic peptides.

         <title>Secondary Amine&#8208;Mediated Domino Reaction for the Synthesis of Substituted Quinolines from Dicyanoalkenes and Enynals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 40, July 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multi&#8208;substituted quinoline derivatives were synthesized from dicyanoalkenes and unsaturated aldehydes via an organocatalyst&#8208;mediated domino reaction in excellent yields. Two catalytic system were established including diphenylprolinol silyl ether and di(2&#8208;ethyl)hexylamine. As catalyst is the amine and a by&#8208;product is only water, this is an environmentally benign reaction.







Abstract
Substituted quinolines, tricyclic and tetracyclic molecules with a quinoline moiety are synthesized by a domino reaction from dicyanoalkenes and 3&#8208;aryl&#8208;pent&#8208;2&#8208;en&#8208;4&#8208;ynals in one pot. We established two methods: one is catalyzed by chiral diphenylprolinol silyl ether, and the other is catalyzed by di(2&#8208;ethyl)hexylamine, in combination with p&#8208;nitrophenol. A wide variety of dicyanoalkenes can be employed. As the catalysts are secondary amines, and water is the only by&#8208;product, this is an environmentally benign synthetic method for the preparation of substituted quinolines.

         <title>Rhodium&#8208;Catalyzed Hydrosilylation of Alkenes with Acylhydrosilanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 40, July 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel method to access synthetically valuable acylsilanes from alkenes through Rh&#8208;catalyzed alkene hydrosilylation with acylhydrosilanes is reported. Acylhydrosilanes represent a novel class of acylsilanes and a great variety of acylsilanes can be accessed via this approach. Reactions occur in good to excellent yields under mild conditions and show high functional group tolerance as well as high atom economy.







Abstract
Acylsilanes are an important class of organosilicon compounds that have gained increased attention recently. Their various reaction modes in particularly their ability to generate carbenes under thermal or photochemical conditions render them valuable reagents in organic synthesis. In this communication, an unprecedented route towards acylsilanes is reported by introducing the acylsilane moiety directly in a single step through alkene hydrosilylation. In this context, acylhydrosilanes representing a novel class of acylsilanes are introduced and applied as silylation reagents in rhodium catalyzed alkene hydrosilylations to access a great variety of acylsilanes. These reactions occur in good to excellent yields under mild conditions and show high functional group tolerance and atom economy.

         <title>Boosting Methanol&#8208;Mediated CO2 Hydrogenation into Aromatics by Synergistically Tailoring Oxygen Vacancy and Acid Site Properties of Multifunctional Catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 40, July 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synergistically tailoring oxygen vacancy and acid site properties of multifunctional catalyst composed of Cr2O3 and H&#8208;ZSM&#8208;5 guarantees the superior aromatics synthesis performance of CO2 hydrogenation in a single&#8208;pass. The structure&#8208;function relationship between aromatics synthesis performance and the different catalytic components is well established to boost aromatics synthesis from CO2 hydrogenation.







Abstract
Even though the direct hydrogenation of CO2 into aromatics has been realized via a methanol&#8208;mediated pathway and multifunctional catalyst, few works have been focused on the simultaneously rational design of each component in multifunctional catalyst to improve the performance. Also, the structure&#8208;function relationship between aromatics synthesis performance and the different catalytic components (reducible metal oxide and acidic zeolite) has been rarely investigated. Herein, we increase the oxygen vacancy (Ov) density in reducible Cr2O3 by sequential carbonization and oxidation (SCO) treatments of Cr&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks. Thanks to the enriched Ov, Cr2O3&#8208;based catalyst affords high methanol selectivity of 98.1&#8201;% (without CO) at a CO2 conversion of 16.8&#8201;% under high reaction temperature (350&#8201;&#176;C). Furthermore, after combining with the acidic zeolite H&#8208;ZSM&#8208;5, the multifunctional catalyst realizes the direct conversion of CO2 into aromatics with conversion and selectivity as high as 25.4&#8201;% and 80.1&#8201;% (without CO), respectively. The property of acid site in H&#8208;ZSM&#8208;5, especially the Al species that located at the intersection of straight and sinusoidal channels, plays a vital role in enhancing the aromatics selectivity, which can be precisely controlled by varying the hydrothermal synthesis conditions. Our work provides a synergistic strategy to boost the aromatics synthesis performance from CO2 hydrogenation.

         <title>Comparison of Antiaromatic Properties in a Series of Structurally Isomeric Naphthothiophene&#8208;Fused s&#8208;Indacenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 40, July 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work compares six antiaromatic naphthothiophene&#8208;fused s&#8208;indacene isomers through computational methods (NICS&#8208;XY scans) and experimental techniques (NMR, UV&#8208;vis, CV, and SC&#8208;XRD).







Abstract
Fusion of aromatic subunits to stabilize an antiaromatic core allows the isolation and study of otherwise unstable paratropic systems. A complete study of a series of six naphthothiophene&#8208;fused s&#8208;indacene isomers is herein described. Additionally, the structural modifications resulted in increased &#960;&#8211;&#960; overlap in the solid state, which was further explored through changing the sterically blocking mesityl group to (triisopropylsilyl)ethynyl in three derivatives. The computed antiaromaticity of the six isomers is compared to the observed physical properties, such as NMR chemical shift, UV&#8208;vis, and CV data. We find that the calculations predict the most antiaromatic isomer and give a general estimation of the relative degree of paratropicity for the remaining isomers, when compared to the experimental results.

&lt;p&gt;Fusion of aromatic subunits to stabilize an antiaromatic core allows the isolation and study of otherwise unstable paratropic systems. A complete study of a series of six naphthothiophene-fused &lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt;-indacene isomers is herein described. Additionally, the structural modifications resulted in increased &#960;&#8211;&#960; overlap in the solid state, which was further explored through changing the sterically blocking mesityl group to (triisopropylsilyl)ethynyl in three derivatives. The computed antiaromaticity of the six isomers is compared to the observed physical properties, such as NMR chemical shift, UV-vis, and CV data. We find that the calculations predict the most antiaromatic isomer and give a general estimation of the relative degree of paratropicity for the remaining isomers, when compared to the experimental results.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis and Characterization of Hexafluorocyclopentane&#8208;Bridged Bisbutatrienes as Models for Longer Cumulenes: Various Transformations for the Construction of &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 40, July 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthetic utility of longer cumulenes for constructing condensed &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems has received considerable interest. Recently conjugated bisbutatrienes have been evaluated as mimics of a longer cumulene. In this research, the hexafluorocyclopentane&#8208;bridged bisbutatrienes were synthesized. They underwent various cyclizations to construct fulvene, pentalene, germacycle, benzocyclobutene, and cyclooctatetraene frameworks.







Abstract
Cumulenes have attracted considerable attention due to their unique structural and electronic properties. Despite their high potential for constructing condensed &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules, the synthetic utility of longer cumulenes remains to be established owing to their inherently high reactivity. Conjugated bisbutatrienes having two cumulene moieties linked by a spacer as a mimic of a longer cumulene were evaluated. Here, the synthesis and characterization of hexafluorocyclopentane&#8208;bridged bisbutatrienes are described. These bisbutatrienes underwent various cyclizations, to construct the unique &#960;&#8208;extended frameworks inaccessible by other methodologies. The bisbutatrienes were converted into fulvenes, pentalene, germacycle, and benzocyclobutene under various conditions. Furthermore, a cyclooctatetraene derivative was synthesized by a one&#8208;step dimerization of the bisbutatriene.

Pt(II)&#8722;NHC complexes are used in alkene hydrosilylation reactions. Some of the examined compounds display excellent catalytic activity, outperforming Pt(0)&#8722;NHC pre&#8208;catalysts. Our study explores the catalyst structure&#8208;activity relationship and provides new mechanistic insights into this industrially important transformation. A sustainable protocol, featuring efficient platinum removal, allows us to access a series of organosilanes in very good to excellent yields.







Abstract
Herein, we report the catalytic activity of a series of platinum(II) pre&#8208;catalysts, bearing N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands, in the alkene hydrosilylation reaction. Their structural and electronic properties are fully investigated using X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR). Next, our study presents a structure&#8208;activity relationship within this group of pre&#8208;catalysts and gives mechanistic insights into the catalyst activation step. An exceptional catalytic performance of one of the complexes is observed, reaching a turnover number (TON) of 970 000 and a turnover frequency (TOF) of 40 417&#8197;h&#8722;1 at 1&#8197;ppm catalyst loading. Finally, an attractive solvent&#8208;free and open&#8208;to&#8208;air alkene hydrosilylation protocol, featuring efficient platinum removal (reduction of residual Pt from 582&#8197;ppm to 5.8&#8197;ppm), is disclosed.

         <title>Thienyl&#8208;Substituted Diboranes(4): Electronic Stabilization of Radicals Versus Increased Reactivity towards Bond Activation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 40, July 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thienyl substituents at a diborane(4) provide a mixture of steric flexibility, &#963;&#8208;electron&#8208;withdrawing and mesomeric effects, which enable the stabilization of a highly delocalized diboron radical anion, as well as an increased reactivity towards bond activation and rearrangement reactions upon Lewis&#8208;base coordination and two&#8208;electron reduction.







Abstract
Low&#8208;valent main group chemistry involves a balancing act between steric and electronic stabilization of the electron&#8208;rich low oxidation state main group centers and their desired reactivity. Herein we show that the combination of sterically shielding mesityl and rotationally flexible 2&#8208;thienyl groups, the latter having the potential to be either electronically stabilizing or activating, at a diborane(4) provides a platform for both radical anion stabilization and unusual bond activation and rearrangement reactions. The addition of a Lewis base to a 1,2&#8208;dimesityl&#8208;1,2&#8208;dithienyldiborane(4) (1) results in direct and unprecedented C&#8722;H borylation of one thienyl substituent with cleavage of the B&#8722;B bond. The facile one&#8208;electron reduction of 1 yields a stable diboron radical anion through delocalization of its unpaired electron over the entire planar 1,2&#8208;dithienyldiboron framework, as evidenced by EPR spectroscopy and DFT calculations. The two&#8208;electron reduction of 1 with magnesium anthracene under more forcing conditions results in B&#8722;B bond cleavage and replacement of one thienyl sulfur atom by a mesitylboron moiety, leading to the formation of a magnesium complex of an &#951;5&#8208;diborafulvene dianion. Salt metathesis of the latter with [(&#951;6&#8208;p&#8208;cymene)RuCl2] affords a mixed ruthenium sandwich complex of an &#951;5&#8208;borylborole dianion. Calculations highlight both the structural and electronic changes in the boron&#8208;substituted heterocyclic C4B dianion upon switching coordination from magnesium (diborafulvene dianion) to ruthenium (borylborole dianion).

         <title>Muscle&#8208;Like Supramolecular Polymers with Dual Motion Patterns</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 40, July 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The motion patterns for traditional muscle&#8208;like supramolecular polymers are confined to unitary direction, much distinct from the natural muscle movement. Herein, we reported a supramolecular polymer possessing with dual motion patterns.







Abstract
Benefiting from the features like polymeric linear structures, stimuli&#8208;responsiveness and dynamic adaptiveness, supramolecular polymers (SPs) are favored as exploiting muscle&#8208;like materials, allowing for imitating the muscle functions. However, a substantial part of these materials barely owned an unitary motion orientation while it was obviously known that muscle movements involved distinct orientations. Herein, M1 holding the structure of 44&#8208;membered macrocycle with two aldehyde groups was designed, meanwhile, M2 comprising of secondary ammonium ions, 3,5&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphenyl groups as well as the alkyl chains was fabricated, for which it could be assembled with M1 to generate SPs based on host&#8211;guest interactions from a large macrocycle and two secondary ammonium ions. SPs underwent vertical compression upon the addition of N2H4 owing to the forming dynamic covalent bonds, notably, mechanically interlocked structures were also generated. Afterwards, the vertically compressed SPs experienced horizontal shrinkage when tetrabutylammonium chloride was contributed due to the destruction of host&#8211;guest interactions.

         <title>Peptide Stapling with Boronate Esters&#8208; A Reversible Folding of (Artificial) Peptide Chain to &#945;&#8208;Helix</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 40, July 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Precisely designed peptide sequences decorated with phenylboronic acid derivative and sugar residues (fructonic or galacturonic acid) in appropriate positions show reversibly forming ester residue and switching between cyclic (closed, stapled) and linear (open, non&#8208;stapled) forms. The boronate ester stapling is stabilized in mild basic conditions and may be switched off by acidification leading to unfolded organization of the peptide chain.







Abstract
Stabilization of a peptide conformation via stapling strategy may be realized by the reversible or more often irreversible connection of side chains being in mutually appropriate geometry. An incorporation of phenylboronic acid and sugar residues (fructonic or galacturonic acid), attached to two lysine side chains via amide bonds and separated by 2, 3, or 6 other residues in the C&#8208;terminal fragment of RNase A introduces the intramolecular interaction stabilizing the &#945;&#8208;helical organization. The boronate ester stapling is stabilized in mild basic conditions and may be switched off by acidification leading to unfolded organization of the peptide chain. We investigated the possibility of using switchable stapling by mass spectrometry, NMR and UV&#8208;CD spectroscopies, and DFT calculations.

         <title>On the Role of N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Salts in Alkyl Radical Generation from Alkyl Alcohols: A Computational Study</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 40, July 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mechanism of carbon centered radical generation from alkyl alcohols mediated by N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene salts has been explored computationally for 7 different NHCs. The influence of the electronic properties for each mechanistic step is rationalized and has been proven to be key for reactivity.







Abstract
Formation of carbon&#8208;carbon bonds through cross&#8208;coupling reactions using readily available substrates, like alcohols, is crucial for modern organic chemistry. Recently, direct alkyl alcohol functionalization has been achieved by the use of N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene (NHC) salts via in&#8197;situ formation of an alcohol&#8208;NHC adduct and its activation by a photoredox catalyst to generate carbon&#8208;centered alkyl radicals. Experimentally, only electron deficient NHC activators work but the reasons of this behavior remain underexplored. Herein, a DFT computational study of the mechanism of alcohol activation using up to seven NHC salts is performed to shed light into the influence of their electronic properties in the alkyl radical formation. This study demonstrates that four reaction steps are involved in the transformation and characterizes how the electronic properties of the NHC salt affect each step. A fine balance of the NHC electron&#8208;richness is proved to be determinant for this transformation.

         <title>[Ni(CO)4]+ as NiI Synthon: Synthesis and Characterization of NiI Half&#8208;Sandwich and Sandwich Cations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 40, July 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 19&#8201;valence electron, half&#8208;sandwich cations [Ni(arene)(CO)2]+ (arene=C6H6, C6H4F2) and the homoleptic [Ni(C6H4F2)2]+ were synthesized endergonically from [Ni(CO)4]+[F{Al(ORF)3}2]&#8722; (RF=C(CF3)3) by irreversible removal of CO from the equilibrium. This procedure is likely transferable to any kind of weak ligand. The [Ni(C6H4F2)2]+ cation revealed an unprecedented &#951;3,&#951;3&#8208;slipped sandwich structure which probably is the ultimate NiI source.







Abstract
The stable, easily accessible salt [Ni(CO)4]+[F{Al(ORF)3}2]&#8722; (RF=C(CF3)3) was used as a NiI synthon to generate the novel half&#8208;sandwich complexes [Ni(arene)(CO)2]+ (arene=C6H6, o&#8208;dfb=1,2&#8208;F2C6H4). By irreversible removal of CO from the equilibrium, even the rather endergonic reaction to a [Ni(o&#8208;dfb)2]+ salt was successful (&#916;rG&#176;(solv)=+78&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1). The latter displays an unprecedented slipped &#951;3,&#951;3&#8208;sandwich structure and is the ultimate synthon to NiI&#8208;chemistry.

Mapping the constellation of structural and dynamic changes concurrent with allosteric inhibitor binding to caspase&#8208;7, also known as allosteric structure&#8211;activity relationships (ASARs), reveals the nexus between the active site and the remote allosteric pocket. These ASARs also elucidate the link between structure and catalytic power for caspase&#8208;7. Our insights from exploration of caspase&#8208;7 allostery offer a new path for navigating allosteric drug discovery. More information can be found in the Research Article by M.&#8197;A. Spies and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202300872).

N&#8208;aryl amide bonds for peptide conformation: In the universe of peptides, the N&#8208;aryl amide bond, with its large steric and electronic effects and ability to restrain amide bond rotation, is represented as a new star. By employing N&#8208;arylation as a backbone amide modification strategy in peptides, we could unravel the different worlds of distinct and predominantly homogeneous conformations in cyclic hexa&#8208; and cyclic pentapeptides containing one or two N&#8208;aryl amide bonds. More information can be found in the Research Article by A. Dangi and U. Kiran&#8197;Marelli (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202300753).

         <title>Overall Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction over Heterogeneous Semiconductor Photocatalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 40, July 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The overall photocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (PCRR) is an eco&#8208;friendly way to convert CO2 and H2O into high&#8208;value chemical feedstocks and fuels using solar energy. Herein, we comprehensively summarize the strategies developed to drive the efficient overall PCRR over heterogeneous semiconductor photocatalysts. Essential future research directions have also been discussed.







Abstract
The overall photocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (PCRR), which uses solar energy to convert CO2 and H2O into chemical feedstocks or fuels without sacrificial reagents, plays a momentous role in CO2 utilization and solar energy conversion. However, significant challenges remain in achieving efficient conversion. Researchers have explored various strategies to realize the overall PCRR efficiently. In this Review, we first explain the criteria for evaluating the overall PCRR and then summarize the following strategies developed over the past decade to promote it: self&#8208;driving material development, Z&#8208;scheme heterojunction construction, cocatalyst loading, heteroatom doping, surface vacancy creation, and carrier&#8208;material matching. Finally, we discuss essential future research directions in the field. Through this comprehensive Review, we aim to provide strategic guidance for the development of efficient overall PCRR systems.

Shaping up: Liquid&#8208;crystal polymers are considered one of the most promising candidates for intelligent shape&#8208;morphing materials. In this review, we discuss recent developments in energy conversion, design strategies and the applications of shape&#8208;morphing liquid&#8208;crystal polymers.







Abstract
Liquid&#8208;crystal polymers are a type of representative material combining the order&#8208;disorder transition of liquid crystals and the superior properties of polymers. The phase transition from the liquid&#8208;crystal phase to the isotropic state of mesogens causes large, controllable, and reversible deformation of polymers; thus, liquid&#8208;crystal polymers have emerged as one of the most valuable candidates for shape&#8208;morphing materials. Therefore, this review will focus on the recent development of shape&#8208;morphing liquid&#8208;crystal polymers, including the modes of energy conversions, material design strategies and further applications. In the main, novel material design methods and a wide range of application of shape&#8208;morphing liquid&#8208;crystal polymers are discussed.

         <title>Hydrofluorination of Alkynes: From (E) to (Z)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The hydrofluorination of alkynes is an efficient synthetic route to monofluoroalkenes or difluoroalkanes. Both fluorinated motifs have found applications in medicinal chemistry and beyond. This review explores the recent advances in the hydrofluorination of diverse alkynes through various activation methods, from classical coinage metal catalysis to metal&#8208;free conditions. The range of alkynes goes from the simplest unactivated alkynes to activated ones (ynones and derivatives, ynamides, alkynyl sulfides and sulfones as much as haloalkynes). Regio&#8208; and stereoselective methods exists, but there is still room for improvement depending on the type of alkyne.</dc:description>

         <title>Heterocyclic [9]helicenes exhibiting bright circular polarized luminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We describe a concise synthetic strategy for the preparation of heterocyclic [9]helicenes and a simple preparative&#8208;scale protocol for the optical resolution of the resulting M&#8208; and P&#8208;enantiomers. The helicenes were characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction along with a range of spectroscopic and computational techniques. A fluorescence quantum yield of up to 65% was observed, and the chiroptical properties of both M&#8208; and P&#8208;helicenes revealed large dissymmetry factors. The CPL brightness reaches up to 17 M&#8208;1 cm&#8208;1, as measured experimentally and verified computationally, which makes this the highest CPL brightness among heterocyclic helicenes. We describe how chiroptical properties (both CD and CPL) can be described and predicted using DFT calculations. The synthetic approach also reveals by&#8208;products that originate from internal oxidation reactions, presumably mediated by the close proximity of the &#960;&#8208;surfaces in the helicene structure.</dc:description>

         <title>Mechanical Interlocking to Unlock the Reinforcing Potential of Carbon Nanotubes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) present extraordinary mechanical properties, with Youngs&#8217; modulus &gt; 1 TPa and tensile strength &gt; 50 GPa which makes them ideal candidates as fillers for the reinforcement of polymers. However, the performance of SWNTs in this field has fallen behind expectations. This is due to a combination of imperfect individualization of the SWNTs and poor load transfer from the polymer to the SWNTs. Here, we study the reinforcement of polymers of different chemical nature using mechanically interlocked derivatives of single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (MINTs). We compare the mechanical properties of fibers made of poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and polysulfone (PSU) and their composites made with pristine SWNTs, MINTs, and the corresponding supramolecular models. With very low loading of MINTs (0.01% w/w), improvements of more than 100% on Youngs Modulus and the tensile strength are observed for both the nonpolar aliphatic PMMA and the very polar aromatic PSU polymers, while pristine carbon nanotubes and the supramolecular nanofillers showed smaller reinforcement. These data, together with our previous report on the reinforcement of polystyrene (nonpolar and aromatic), indicate that derivatization of SWNTs as MINTs is a valid general strategy to optimize the interaction between SWNT fillers and the polymer matrix.</dc:description>

         <title>Induction and Stabilization of Columnar Mesophases in Fluorinated Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons by Arene&#8208;Perfluoroarene Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The straightforward synthesis of several Fluorinated Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons by the efficient, transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free, arene fluorine nucleophilic substitution reaction is reported, and the full investigation of their liquid crystalline and optical properties reported. The key precursors for this study, i.e. 2,2&#8217;&#8208;dilithio&#8208;4,4',5,5'&#8208;tetraalkoxy&#8208;1,1&#8217;&#8208;biphenyl alkylated derivatives, were obtained in two steps from the highly selective Scholl oxidative homo&#8208;coupling of 3,4&#8208;dialkoxy&#8208;1&#8208;bromobenzene, followed by quantitative double&#8208;lithiation. In situ room temperature nucleophilic annulation with either perfluorobenzene or perfluoronaphthalene leads to 1,2,3,4&#8208;tetrafluoro&#8208;6,7,10,11&#8208;tetraalkxoytriphenylenes and 9,10,11,12,13,14&#8208;hexafluoro&#8208;2,3,6,7&#8208;tetraalkoxybenzo[f]tetraphenes, respectively, in good yields. Exploiting the same strategy, subsequent double annulations resulted in the formation of 9,18&#8208;difluoro&#8208;2,3,6,7,11,12,15,16&#8208;octa(alkoxy)tribenzo[f,k,m]tetraphenes and 9,10,19,20&#8208;tetrafluoro&#8208;2,3,6,7,12,13,16,17&#8208;octakis(hexyloxy)tetrabenzo[a,c,j,l]tetracenes, respectively. Despite the presence of only four alkoxy chains, the polar &#8220;Janus&#8221; mesogens display a columnar hexagonal mesophase over broad temperature ranges, with higher mesophase stability than the archetypical 2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexa(alkoxy)triphenylenes and their hydrogenated counterparts. The improvement or induction of mesomorphism is attributed to efficient antiparallel face&#8208;to&#8208;face &#960;&#8208;stacking driven by the establishment of non&#8208;covalent perfluoroarene&#8208;arene intermolecular interactions. The larger lipophilic discotic &#960;&#8208;extended compounds also exhibit columnar mesomorphism, over similar temperature ranges and stability than their hydrogenated homologs. Finally, these fluorinated molecules form stringy gels in various solvents, and show interesting solvatochromic emission properties in solution as well as strong emission in thin films and gels.</dc:description>

         <title>Total Synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;5&#8208;Deoxyenterocin and Attempted Late&#8208;Stage Functionalization Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The first total synthesis of (&#8722;)&#8208;5&#8208;deoxyenterocin has been accomplished starting from pentane&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triol (16 steps in the longest linear sequence, 0.2% overall yield). (&#8722;)&#8208;Menthone served as the source of chirality to distinguish the enantiotopic hydroxymethyl groups of the substrate. Key steps of the synthesis include two aldol reactions to either end of the C5&#8208;skeleton, a diastereoselective hydroxylation reaction and a biomimetic two&#8208;fold intramolecular aldol reaction as the final step. Although this step suffered from geometrical constraints and was low&#8208;yielding (10%), enough synthetic material could be secured to substantiate the relative and absolute configuration of the natural product. Additional experiments were directed toward a C&#8722;H functionalization at carbon atom C5. Despite the fact that several protocols could be successfully applied to (3aR)&#8208;(+)&#8208;scerolide as model substrate, (&#8722;)&#8208;5&#8208;deoxyenterocin withstood any selective functionalization.</dc:description>

         <title>The Rapid Synthesis of Colibactin Warhead Model Compounds Using New Metal&#8208;Free Photocatalytic Cyclopropanation Reactions Facilitates the Investigation of Biological Mechanisms</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report the synthesis of a series of colibactin warhead model compounds using two newly developed metal&#8208;free photocatalytic cyclopropanation reactions. These mild cyclopropanations expand the known applications of eosin within synthesis. A halogen atom transfer reaction mode has been harnessed so that dihalides can be used as the cyclopropanating agents. The colibactin warhead models were then used to provide new insight into two key mechanisms in colibactin chemistry. An explanation is provided for why the colibactin warhead sometimes undergoes a ring expansion&#8208;addition reaction to give fused cyclobutyl products while at other times nucleophiles add directly to the cyclopropyl unit (as when DNA adds to colibactin). Finally, we provide some evidence that Cu(II) chelated to colibactin may catalyze an important oxidation of the colibactin&#8208;DNA adduct. The Cu(I) generated as a result could then also play a role in inducing double strand breaks in DNA.</dc:description>

         <title>Rapid Unambiguous Structure Elucidation of Streptnatamide A, a New Cyclic Peptide Isolated from A Marine&#8208;derived Streptomyces sp.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cyclic peptides have been excellent source of drug leads. With the advances in discovery platforms, the pharmaceutical industry has a growing interest in cyclic peptides and has pushed several into clinical trials. However, structural complexity of cyclic peptides brings extreme challenges for structure elucidation efforts. Isotopic fine structure analysis, Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and detailed tandem mass spectrometry rapidly provided peptide sequence for streptnatamide A, a cyclic peptide isolated from a marine&#8208;derived Streptomyces sp. Marfey&#8217;s analysis determined the stereochemistry of all amino acids, enabling the unambiguous structure determination of this compound. A non&#8208;ribosomal peptide synthetase biosynthetic gene cluster (stp) was tentatively identified and annotated for streptnatamide A based on the in&#8208;silico analysis of whole genome sequencing data. These analytical tools will be powerful tools to overcome the challenges for cyclic peptide structure elucidation and accelerate the development of bioactive cyclic peptides.</dc:description>

A non-ribosomal peptide synthetase biosynthetic gene cluster (stp) was tentatively identified and annotated for streptnatamide A based on the in-silico analysis of whole genome sequencing data. These analytical tools will be powerful tools to overcome the challenges for cyclic peptide structure elucidation and accelerate the development of bioactive cyclic peptides.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Excited&#8208;State Proton Transfer in Luminescent Dyes: From Theoretical Insight to Experimental Evidence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>To ESPT, or not to ESPT. The effective utilization of luminescent dyes often relies on a comprehensive understanding of their excitation and relaxation pathways. One such pathway, Excited&#8208;State Proton Transfer (ESPT), involves the tautomerization of the dye in its excited state, resulting in a new structure that exhibits distinct emission properties, such as a very large Stokes' shift or dual&#8208;emission. Although the ESPT phenomenon is well&#8208;explained theoretically, its experimental demonstration can be challenging due to the presence of numerous other phenomena that can yield similar experimental observations. In this review, we propose that an all&#8208;encompassing methodology, integrating experimental findings, computational analyses, and a thorough evaluation of diverse mechanisms, is essential for verifying the occurrence of ESPT in luminescent dyes. Investigations have offered significant understanding of the elements impacting the ESPT process and the array of approaches that can be used to validate the existence of ESPT. These discoveries hold crucial ramifications for the advancement of molecular probes, sensors, and other applications that depend on ESPT as a detection mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>CO2&#8208;mediated photocatalytic chlorine production over bismuth oxychloride in chloride solution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As one of the most commonly bulky chemicals, chlorine is conventionally manufactured by electrolysis of NaCl solution in the chlor&#8208;alkali process, which requires a huge supply of electrical energy. The photocatalytic route to produce chlorine using solar energy and&#160;NaCl solution&#160;offers a promising strategy to reduce energy consumption and bring economic benefits. Herein, we found that the introduction of CO2 would enhance the productivity of Cl2 from 8.24 &#956;mol&#183;h&#8722;1 to 39.6 &#956;mol&#183;h&#8722;1 in NaCl solution over BiOCl. Experimental studies reveal that the CO2 species (CO32&#8722;) entered into the crystal texture of BiOCl and the interlayer space between [Bi2O2]2+ slabs were increased and distorted, accelerating the cycle of Cl species. Besides, the cycle of carbonate species also existed and accelerated the reaction efficiency of Cl&#8722; oxidation to Cl2. This work provides a new feasible method of using abundant CO2 resources to accelerate the process of chlorine production via photocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>A Concise Synthetic Approach to Highly Reactive Click&#8208;to&#8208;Release Trans&#8208;Cyclooctene Linkers
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

Intramolecular iodolactonization was employed for the efficient and stereoselective conversion of an sTCO click&#8208;conjugation precursor to a highly reactive and stable click&#8208;cleavable sTCO antibody conjugate linker.







Abstract
An increase in the click&#8208;to&#8208;release reaction rate between cleavable trans&#8208;cyclooctenes (TCO) and tetrazines would be beneficial for drug delivery applications. In this work, we have developed a short and stereoselective synthesis route towards highly reactive sTCOs that serve as cleavable linkers, affording quantitative tetrazine&#8208;triggered payload release. In addition, the fivefold more reactive sTCO exhibited the same in&#8197;vivo stability as current TCO linkers when used as antibody linkers in circulation in mice.

         <title>Comparative Study on Proton Conductivity and Mechanism Analysis of Two Imidazole Modified Imine&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This work elucidates the potential impact of intramolecular H&#8208;bonds within the pore walls of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) on proton conductivity. Employing DaTta and TaTta as representative hosts, it was observed that their innate proton conductivities (&#963;) are both unsatisfactory and &#963;(DaTta) &lt; &#963;(TaTta). Intriguingly, the performance of both imidazole&#8208;loaded products, Im@DaTta and Im@TaTta is greatly improved, and the &#963; of Im@DaTta (0.91 &#215; 10&#8208;2 S&#183;cm&#8208;1) even surpasses that of Im@TaTta (3.73 &#215; 10&#8208;3 S&#183;cm&#8208;1) under 100 &#176;C and 98% relative humidity. The structural analysis, gas adsorption tests, and activation energy calculations forecast the influence of imidazole on the H&#8208;bonded system within the framework, leading to observed changes in proton conductivity. It is hypothesized that intramolecular H&#8208;bonds within the COF framework impede efficient proton transmission. Nevertheless, the inclusion of an imidazole group disrupts these intramolecular bonds, leading to the formation of an abundance of intermolecular H&#8208;bonds within the pore channels, thus contributing to a dramatic increase in proton conductivity. The related calculation of Density Functional Theory (DFT) provides further evidence for this inference.</dc:description>

         <title>N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Boranes: Dual Reagents for the Synthesis of Gold Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
NHC&#8208;boranes are demonstrated to be efficient dual reagents, as both reducing agent and source of surface ligands, for the synthesis of NHC&#8208;coated gold nanoparticles. This strategy allows the synthesis of spherical and monodisperse AuNPs of variable sizes by adjusting the gold to NHC&#8208;borane ratio. The NHC&#8208;boranes can also be exploited in a seeded growth process, a strategy never before reported with NHC stabilized gold nanoparticles. The protocol is simple, operates under mild conditions and avoids the use of extensive purification methods.







Abstract
N&#8208;Heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) have drawn considerable interest in the field of nanomaterials chemistry as highly stabilizing ligands enabling the formation of strong and covalent carbon&#8211;metal bonds. Applied to gold nanoparticles synthesis, the most common strategy consists of the reduction of a preformed NHC&#8208;AuI complex with a large excess of a reducing agent that makes the particle size difficult to control. In this paper, we report the straightforward synthesis of NHC&#8208;coated gold nanoparticles (NHC&#8208;AuNPs) by treating a commercially available gold(I) precursor with an easy&#8208;to&#8208;synthesize NHC&#8208;BH3 reagent. The latter acts as both the reducing agent and the source of surface ligands operating under mild conditions. Mechanistic studies including NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry demonstrate that the reduction of gold(I) generates NHC&#8208;BH2Cl as a by&#8208;product. This strategy gives efficient control over the nucleation and growth of gold particles by varying the NHC&#8208;borane/gold(I) ratio, allowing unparalleled particle size variation over the range of 4.9&#177;0.9 to 10.0&#177;2.7&#8197;nm. Our strategy also allows an unprecedented precise and controlled seeded growth of gold nanoparticles. In addition, the as&#8208;prepared NHC&#8208;AuNPs exhibit narrow size distributions without the need for extensive purification or size&#8208;selectivity techniques, and are stable over months.

&lt;p&gt;NHC-boranes are demonstrated to be efficient dual reagents, as both reducing agent and source of surface ligands, for the synthesis of NHC-coated gold nanoparticles. This strategy allows the synthesis of spherical and monodisperse AuNPs of variable sizes by adjusting the gold to NHC-borane ratio. The NHC-boranes can also be exploited in a seeded growth process, a strategy never before reported with NHC stabilized gold nanoparticles. The protocol is simple, operates under mild conditions and avoids the use of extensive purification methods.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-Heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) have drawn considerable interest in the field of nanomaterials chemistry as highly stabilizing ligands enabling the formation of strong and covalent carbon&#8211;metal bonds. Applied to gold nanoparticles synthesis, the most common strategy consists of the reduction of a preformed NHC-Au&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; complex with a large excess of a reducing agent that makes the particle size difficult to control. In this paper, we report the straightforward synthesis of NHC-coated gold nanoparticles (NHC-AuNPs) by treating a commercially available gold(I) precursor with an easy-to-synthesize NHC-BH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; reagent. The latter acts as both the reducing agent and the source of surface ligands operating under mild conditions. Mechanistic studies including NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry demonstrate that the reduction of gold(I) generates NHC-BH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl as a by-product. This strategy gives efficient control over the nucleation and growth of gold particles by varying the NHC-borane/gold(I) ratio, allowing unparalleled particle size variation over the range of 4.9&#177;0.9 to 10.0&#177;2.7&#8197;nm. Our strategy also allows an unprecedented precise and controlled seeded growth of gold nanoparticles. In addition, the as-prepared NHC-AuNPs exhibit narrow size distributions without the need for extensive purification or size-selectivity techniques, and are stable over months.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Highly Efficient Electrochemiluminescence from Imidazole&#8208;Based Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A family of novel Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence (TADF) emitters have been synthetized by a straightforward and metal&#8208;free synthesis, and structurally characterized. In this work we keep fixed the acceptor moiety, 4&#8208;(1H&#8208;imidazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)benzonitrile, and systemically tested different donors to correlate their photophysical and electrochemical properties with their performance in electrochemiluminescence using both benzoyl peroxide as coreactant and coreactant free (annihilation) conditions. Some compounds exceed the efficiency of the standard [Ru(bpy)3]Cl2 up to 28 times with benzoyl peroxide and 38 times in annihilation. Interestingly, we found that the efficiency is mainly dictated by the electrochemical reversibility of redox processes rather than by the photophysical properties in terms of photoluminescence quantum yield or excited state lifetime. In addition, the annihilation electrochemiluminescence efficiency strongly depend on the pulse sequence. The imidazole moiety can be conveniently alkylated allowing the insertion of functional groups, such a carboxylic acid, enabling practical applications.</dc:description>

         <title>The structure of Maneb: An important manganese&#8208;containing bis(dithiocarbamate) fungicide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Maneb is a manganese(II) containing fungicide with a multi&#8208;site effect and no resistance, therefore it is widely applied in many parts of the world. There is however mounting evidence for neurotoxic effects with Parkinson&#8208;like symptoms (manganism) related to usage of Maneb. Due to its insolubility in most solvents and its paramagnetism, structural elucidation is not trivial and thus its exact molecular structure remains unknown. We report herein a synthesis procedure to prepare Maneb reproducibly in pure form and the use of various analytical techniques including X&#8208;ray diffraction, X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and electron diffraction to determine the molecular structure of Maneb in the solid state and also in solution.</dc:description>

         <title>Centrohexaindane, a Unique Polyaromatic Hydrocarbon Bearing the Rare C q (C q )4 Core: Inelastic Neutron Scattering, Infrared and Raman Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have investigated the structure and vibrational spectroscopy of centrohexaindane, 1. This unusual molecule has a quaternary carbon atom that is coordinated to four further such quaternary carbon atoms as its core, each pair of which is bonded to an ortho&#8208;phenylene unit. Previous NMR studies have shown that the molecule has tetrahedral (Td) symmetry in solution. The infrared and Raman spectra of chloroform and deuterochloroform solutions of 1 are completely in agreement with this conclusion, as the only modes that are visible are those allowed for Td symmetry. This is not the case in the solid state: X&#8208;ray powder diffraction indicates that the unit cell is triclinic or monoclinic with a volume in excess of 4000 &#197;3. The vibrational spectroscopy is consistent with C1 site symmetry and the presence of at least two molecules in the primitive cell. It is likely that the space group is centrosymmetric.</dc:description>

         <title>Novel Method for the Synthesis of Merocyanines: New Photophysical Possibilities for a Known Class of Fluorophores</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Friedel&#8211;Crafts reaction followed by nucleophilic aromatic substitution enables the assembly of rhodols and novel strongly emitting merocyanines from simple substrates.







Abstract
A new, transformative method for the preparation of rhodols and other merocyanines from readily available tetrafluorohydroxybenzaldehyde and aminophenols has been developed. It is now possible to prepare merocyanines bearing three fluorine atoms and additional conjugated rings, and the whole one&#8208;pot process occurs under neutral, mild conditions. Three heretofore unknown merocyanine&#8208;based architectures were prepared using this strategy from aminonaphthols and 4&#8208;hydroxycoumarins. The ability to change the structure of original rhodol chromophore into &#960;&#8208;expanded merocyanines translates to a comprehensive method for the modulation of photophysical properties, such as shifting the absorption and emission bands across almost the entire visible spectrum, reaching a huge Stokes shift i.&#8201;e. 4800&#8197;cm&#8722;1, brightness approximately 80.000&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8197;cm&#8722;1, two&#8208;photon absorption cross&#8208;section above 150&#8197;GM and switching&#8208;on/off solvatofluorochromism. A detailed investigation allowed to rationalize the different spectroscopic behavior of rhodols and new merocyanines, addressing solvatochromism and two&#8208;photon absorption.

         <title>CH3CN@open&#8208;C60: An Effective Inner&#8208;Space Modification and Isotope Effect Inside a Nano&#8208;Sized Flask</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An effective inner&#8208;space modification was achieved by the encapsulation of a CH3CN. The polarity of the resulting molecular complex was enhanced, with a decreased LUMO level. Moreover, the favored binding affinity of CD3CN compared with CH3CN was revealed.







Abstract
Despite several small molecules being encapsulated inside cage&#8208;opened fullerene derivatives, such species have not considerably affected the structures and properties of the outer carbon cages. Herein, we achieved an effective inner&#8208;space modification for an open&#8208;cage C60 derivative by insertion of a neutral CH3CN molecule into the cavity. The CH3CN@open&#8208;C60 thus obtained showed an enhanced polarity, thus affording an easy separation from a mixture containing the empty cage by column chromatography on silica gel, without the preparative HPLC that was needed for previous cases. The less negative reduction potentials with respect to those of empty cage reflect the decreased energy level of the LUMO, which is supported by the DFT calculations. NMR spectroscopy, single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray analysis, and theoretical calculations revealed that both the presence of the encapsulated CH3CN and cage deformation caused by the CH3CN play an essential role in the change of the electronic properties. Furthermore, the favored binding affinity of deuterated acetonitrile CD3CN with internal C60 surface is discussed.

Moreover, the favored binding affinity of CD&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CN compared with CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CN was revealed.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite several small molecules being encapsulated inside cage-opened fullerene derivatives, such species have not considerably affected the structures and properties of the outer carbon cages. Herein, we achieved an effective inner-space modification for an open-cage C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; derivative by insertion of a neutral CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CN molecule into the cavity. The CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CN@open-C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; thus obtained showed an enhanced polarity, thus affording an easy separation from a mixture containing the empty cage by column chromatography on silica gel, without the preparative HPLC that was needed for previous cases. The less negative reduction potentials with respect to those of empty cage reflect the decreased energy level of the LUMO, which is supported by the DFT calculations. NMR spectroscopy, single-crystal X-ray analysis, and theoretical calculations revealed that both the presence of the encapsulated CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CN and cage deformation caused by the CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CN play an essential role in the change of the electronic properties. Furthermore, the favored binding affinity of deuterated acetonitrile CD&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CN with internal C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; surface is discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Kinetically Controlled Star Copolymer Self&#8208;Assembly for Rapid Fabrication of Nanoparticles with High Encapsulation Capacity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rapid and scalable self&#8208;assembly of an amphiphilic 21&#8208;arm star copolymer results in nanoparticles with narrow&#8208;size distribution and capability of high hydrophobic cargo encapsulation up to 19.84&#8201;%. A kinetically controlled self&#8208;assembly mechanism has been proposed for this process.







Abstract
Rapid and scalable self&#8208;assembly of an amphiphilic 21&#8208;arm star copolymer, (polystyrene&#8208;block&#8208;polyethylene glycol)21 [(PS&#8208;b&#8208;PEG)21] in aqueous solution has been performed by reverse solvent exchange procedure. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) and nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) reveal the formation of nanoparticles with narrow size distribution. Further investigation indicates a kinetically controlled self&#8208;assembly mechanism of the copolymers, in which the star topology of the amphiphilic copolymer and deep quenching condition by reverse solvent exchange are key to accelerate intrachain contraction of the copolymer during phase separation. When interchain contraction dominant over interchain association, nanoparticles with low aggregation number could be formed. Thanks to the high hydrophobic contents of the (PS&#8208;b&#8208;PEG)21 polymers, the resulted nanoparticles could encapsulate a high capacity of hydrophobic cargo up to 19.84&#8201;%. The kinetically controlled star copolymer self&#8208;assembly process reported here provides a platform for the rapid and scalable fabrication of nanoparticle with high drug loading capacity (LC), which may find broad range of applications in, for example drug delivery, nanopesticide.

         <title>The Bulk Breast Cancer Cell and Breast Cancer Stem Cell Activity of Binuclear Copper(II)&#8208;Phenanthroline Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Investigations of the anti&#8208;cancer stem cell (CSC) properties of multinuclear metal complexes are rare. Here the synthesis, characterisation, and bulk breast cancer cell and breast CSC activity of two new binuclear copper(II) complexes are reported. The mechanism of action of the most stable and potent binuclear copper(II) complex were elucidated.







Abstract
Mononuclear copper(II)&#8208;phenanthroline complexes have been widely investigated as anticancer agents whereas multinuclear copper(II)&#8208;phenanthroline complexes are underexplored. Here the synthesis and characterisation of two new binuclear copper(II)&#8208;phenanthroline complexes 1 and 2 is reported, comprising of 2,9&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1,10&#8208;phenanthroline or 2,9&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;4,7&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;1,10&#8208;phenanthroline, terminal chloride ligands, and bridging chloride or hydroxide ligands. The binuclear copper(II) complex containing 2,9&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1,10&#8208;phenanthroline 1 displays nanomolar toxicity towards bulk breast cancer cells and breast cancer stem cells (CSCs) grown in monolayers, &gt;50&#8208;fold greater than cisplatin (an anticancer metallodrug) and salinomycin (a gold&#8208;standard anti&#8208;CSC agent). Spectacularly, 1 exhibits &gt;100&#8208;fold greater potency toward three&#8208;dimensionally cultured mammospheres than cisplatin and salinomycin. Mechanistic studies show that 1 evokes breast CSC apoptosis by elevating intracellular reactive oxygen species levels and damaging genomic DNA (possibly by an oxidative mechanism). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to probe the anti&#8208;breast CSC properties of binuclear copper(II)&#8208;phenanthroline complexes.

         <title>Picolinaldehyde&#8208;Zinc(II)&#8208;Palladium(0) Catalytic System for the Asymmetric &#945;&#8208;Allylation of N&#8208;Unprotected Amino Esters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A straightforward and atom&#8208;economic catalytic method for asymmetric &#945;&#8208;allylation of N&#8208;unprotected amino esters was achieved to provide enantioenriched &#945;&#8208;quaternary &#945;&#8208;allyl amino esters with high yields and high enantioselectivities. To achieve this transformation, we utilized a ternary catalytic system consisting of a chiral phosphoramidite&#8208;palladium complex, an achiral picolinaldehyde, and the Lewis acid Zn(OTf)2.







Abstract
Reported in this work is a synergistic ternary achiral picolinaldehyde&#8208;Zn(II)&#8208;chiral palladium complex system for the highly enantioselective &#945;&#8208;allylation of N&#8208;unprotected amino esters. By utilizing a variety of allylic carbonates or vinyl benzoxazinanones as substrates, &#945;&#8208;allyl &#945;&#8208;amino esters were obtained in high yields (up to 96&#8201;%) with high enantioselectivities (up to 98&#8201;%&#8201;ee). Control experiments suggest that the coordination of Zn(II) with the Schiff base intermediate enhances the acidity of the &#945;&#8208;C&#8722;H bonds of amino esters, thereby favoring &#945;&#8208;allylation over intrinsic N&#8208;allylation. Furthermore, NMR studies reveal an interaction between the chiral palladium complex and the Zn(II)&#8208;Schiff base intermediate, leading to the formation of a picolinaldehyde&#8208;Zn(II)&#8208;Pd(0) catalytic system.

         <title>Supramolecular Chirogenesis in a Sterically Hindered Porphyrin: A Critical Theoretical Analysis
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
How to rationalization the molecular mechanisms of chirogenesis? Using a sterically hindered porphyrin receptor, we provide a blue print for the comprehensive analysis of induced electronic circular dichroism with experimental and computational methods and identify critical geometric factors and possible problems, such as a lack of significant conformations and accidental agreement of experimental and simulated spectra.







Abstract
The determination of molecular stereochemistry and absolute configuration is an important part of modern chemistry, pharmacology, and biology. Electronic circular dichroism (ECD) spectroscopy is a widely used tool for chirality assignment, especially with porphyrin macrocycles employed as reporter chromophores. However, the mechanisms of induced ECD in porphyrin complexes are yet to be comprehensively rationalized. In this work, the ECD spectra of a sterically hindered hexa&#8208;cationic porphyrin with two camphorsulfonic acids in dichloromethane and chloroform were experimentally measured and computationally analyzed. The influence of geometric factors such as the position of chiral guest molecules, distortion of the porphyrin macrocycle, and orientation of aromatic and non&#8208;aromatic peripheral substituents on the ECD spectra was theoretically studied. Various potential pitfalls, such as a lack of significant conformations and accidental agreement of experimental and simulated spectra, are considered and discussed.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of carbene&#8208;stabilized symmetrical and unsymmetrical dicationic tetraboranes were prepared and fully characterized. Reactions of these tetraboranes with reductants/bases afford a zwitterionic alkylidene borate&#8211;borenium species and a 1,3&#8208;azaborinine, respectively. The structural relationship of the alkylidene borate&#8211;borenium zwitterion and its zwitterionic diborene analogue was investigated.

Carbene&#8208;stabilized symmetrical and unsymmetrical dicationic tetraboranes, featuring an electron&#8208;precise tetraborane chain, were synthesized and fully characterized. Reactions of these tetraboranes with reductants/bases give rise to different outcomes according to the conditions employed, including: 1) reduction and rearrangement of the tetraborane chain to give a zwitterionic alkylidene borate&#8211;borenium species; 2) cleavage of the tetraborane chain to afford a 1,3&#8208;azaborinine; and 3) reduction of the supporting ligands to provide a diamino dipotassium salt. The zwitterionic alkylidene borate&#8211;borenium species can be viewed as an analogue of the base&#8208;stabilized diborenes. NMR spectroscopy and DFT calculations reveal a highly polarized B&#8722;B bond in the zwitterionic alkylidene borate&#8211;borenium, in which the formal oxidation states of the boron atoms can be considered as &#8722;1 and +2. These results suggest the considerable potential of tetraboranes as synthons for low&#8208;valent boron species.

&lt;p&gt;A series of carbene-stabilized symmetrical and unsymmetrical dicationic tetraboranes were prepared and fully characterized. Reactions of these tetraboranes with reductants/bases afford a zwitterionic alkylidene borate&#8211;borenium species and a 1,3-azaborinine, respectively. The structural relationship of the alkylidene borate&#8211;borenium zwitterion and its zwitterionic diborene analogue was investigated.

         <title>Design and Synthesis of New Type of Macrocyclic Architectures Used for Optoelectronic Materials and Supramolecular Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular chemistry has received much attention for decades. Macrocyclic architectures as representative receptors play a vital role in supramolecular chemistry and are applied in many fields such as supramolecular assembly and host&#8208;guest recognition. However, the classical macrocycles generally lack functional groups in the scaffolds, which limit their further applications, especially in optoelectronic materials. Therefore, developing new design principle is not only essential to better understand macrocyclic chemistry and the supramolecular behaviors, but also further expand their applications in many research fields. In recent years, the doping compounds with main&#8208;group heteroatoms (B, N, S, O, P) into the carbon&#8208;based &#960;&#8208;conjugated macrocycles offered a new strategy to build macrocyclic architectures with unique optoelectronic properties. In particular, the energy gaps and redox behavior can be effectively tuned by incorporating heteroatoms into the macrocyclic scaffolds. In this Minireview, we briefly summarize the design and synthesis of new macrocycles, and further discuss the related applications in optoelectronic materials and supramolecular chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Selective and pH&#8208;Independent Detection of Ba2+ in Water by a Benzo&#8208;21&#8208;Crown&#8208;7&#8208;Functionalized BODIPY</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report on a highly Ba2+ selective fluorescence sensing in water by a fluorescent probe&#160;consisting of&#160;a benzo&#8208;21&#8208;crown&#8208;7 as a Ba2+ binding unit (ionophore)&#160;and a tetramethylated BODIPY fluorophore as a fluorescence reporter.&#160;This fluorescent probe showed a Ba2+ induced fluorescence enhancement (FE) by a factor of 12 &#177; 1 independently of the pH value and a high Ba2+ sensitivity with a limit of detection (LOD) of (17.2 &#177; 0.3) &#181;M. Moreover, a second fluorescent probe consisting of the same BODIPY fluorophore, but a benzo&#8208;18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 as a cation&#8208;responsive binding moiety, showed an even higher FE upon Ba2+ complexation by a factor of 85 &#177; 3 and a lower LOD of (13 &#177; 3) &#181;M albeit a lower Ba2+ selectivity. The fluorescence sensing mechanism of Ba2+ was further investigated by time&#8208;resolved fluorescence as well as transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS) and it turned out that within these probes a blocking of a photoinduced electron transfer (PET) by Ba2+ is very likely responsible for the FE.</dc:description>

         <title>Dimetalloylene (M&#8211;E&#8211;M) Complexes of Heavier Main Group Elements Ge, Sn, Pb, Bi via Cleavage of E&#8211;X Bonds (X = N(SiMe3)2, OtBu) with an Iridium Hydride</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reactions of the Ir(V) hydride [MeBDIDipp]IrH4 {BDI = (Dipp)NC(Me)CH(Me)CN(Dipp); Dipp = 2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3} with E[N(SiMe3)2]2 (E = Sn, Pb) afforded the unusual dimeric dimetallotetrylenes ([MeBDIDipp]IrH)2(&#956;2&#8208;E)2 in good yields. Moreover, ([MeBDIDipp]IrH)2(&#956;2&#8208;Ge)2 was formed in situ from thermal decomposition of [MeBDIDipp]Ir(H)2Ge[N(SiMe3)2]2. These reactions are accompanied by liberation of HN(SiMe3)2 and H2 by the apparent cleavage of an E&#8212;N(SiMe3)2 bond by Ir&#8212;H. In a reversal of this process, ([MeBDIDipp]IrH)2(&#956;2&#8208;E)2 reacted with excess H2 to regenerate [MeBDIDipp]IrH4. Variations of the concentrations of reactants led to formation of the trimeric ([MeBDIDipp]IrH2)3(&#956;2&#8208;E)3. The further scope of this synthetic route was investigated with group 15 amides, and ([MeBDIDipp]IrH)2(&#956;2&#8208;Bi)2 was prepared via the reaction of [MeBDIDipp]IrH4 with Bi(NMe2)3 or Bi(O t Bu)3, to afford the first example of a &#8216;naked&#8217; two&#8208;coordinate Bi atom bound exclusively to transition metals. A viable mechanism that accounts for formation of the products is proposed. Computational investigations of the Ir2E2 (E = Ge, Sn, Pb) compounds characterized them as open&#8208;shell singlets with confined nonbonding lone&#8208;pairs at the E centers. In contrast, Ir2Bi2 is characterized as having a closed&#8208;shell singlet ground state.</dc:description>

         <title>Graphitic Carbon Nitride as Photocatalyst for the Direct Formylation of Anilines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the use of graphitic carbon nitride (g&#8208;CN) for the photocatalytic radical formylation of anilines, which represents a more sustainable and attractive alternative to the currently used approaches. Our operationally simple method occurs under mild conditions, employing air as oxidant. In particular, the chemistry is driven by the ability of g&#8208;CN to reach an electronically excited state upon visible&#8208;light absorption which has a suitable potential energy to trigger the formation of reactive &#945;&#8208;amino radical species from anilines. Mechanistic investigations also proved the key role of the g&#8208;CN to form reactive superoxide radicals from O2via single electron transfer. Importantly, this photocatalytic transformation provides a variety of functionalized formamides (15 examples, up to 89% yield).</dc:description>

         <title>Fe(III)&#8208;based Eutectic Mixtures as Multi&#8208;Task and Reusable Reaction Media for Efficient and Selective Conversion of Alkynes into Carbonyl Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An efficient, simple and general protocol for the selective hydration of terminal alkynes into the corresponding methyl ketones was developed by using a cheap, easy&#8208;to&#8208;synthesise and sustainable Fe(III)&#8208;based eutectic mixture [FeCl3&#183;6H2O/Gly (3:1)] as both promoter and solvent for the hydration reaction, working: i) under mild (45 &#186;C) and bench type reaction conditions (air); and ii) in the absence of ligands, co&#8208;catalysts, co&#8208;solvents or toxic, non&#8208;abundant and expensive noble transition metals (Au, Ru, Pd). When the final methyl ketones are solid/insoluble in the eutectic mixture, the hydration reaction takes place in 30 minutes and the obtained methyl ketones can be isolated just by simple decantation of the liquid Fe(III)&#8208;DES, allowing the direct isolation of the desired ketones without VOC solvents. By using this straightforward and simple isolation protocol, we have been able to recycle our Fe(III)&#8208;based eutectic mixture system up to 8 consecutive times. Furthermore, our Fe(III)&#8208;eutectic mixture is able to promote the selective and efficient formal oxidation of internal alkynes into 1,2&#8208;diketones, being the system recycled up to 3 consecutive times. Preliminary investigations on a possible mechanism for the oxidation of the internal alkynes seems to indicate that it proceeds through the formation of the corresponding methyl ketones and &#945;&#8208;chloroketones</dc:description>

         <title>Elucidation of Substituent&#8208;Responsive Reactivities via Hierarchical and Asymmetric Assemblies in Crystalline p&#8208;Quinodimethane Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract: We propose a mechanism for substituent&#8208;responsive reactivities of p&#8208;quinodimethane derivatives with four ester groups through their hierarchical and asymmetric assembly modes. &#160;&#160;Four asymmetric 7,8,8&#8208;tris(methoxycarbonyl)&#8208;p&#8208;quinodimethanes with a 7&#8208;positioned ethoxycarbonyl (2a(H)), 2&#8217;&#8208;fluoroethoxycarbonyl (2b(F)), 2&#8217;&#8208;chloroethoxycarbonyl (2c(Cl)), or 2&#8217;&#8208;bromoethoxycarbonyl (2d(Br)) were synthesized and crystallized. &#160;&#160;2a(H), 2b(F) and 2d(Br) afforded only one shape crystal, while 2c(Cl) did two polymorphic 2c(Cl)&#8208;a and 2c(Cl)&#8208;b.&#160;&#160; UV&#8208;irradiation induced topochemical polymerization for 2a(H), no reactions for 2b(F) and 2c(Cl)&#8208;a, and [6+6] photocycloaddition dimerization for 2c(Cl)&#8208;b and 2d(Br). &#160;&#160;Such substituent&#8208;responsive reactivities and crystal structures were compared with those of the known symmetric 7,7,8,8&#8208;tetrakis(alkoxycarbonyl)&#8208;p&#8208;quinodimethanes such as 7,7,8,8&#8208;tetrakis(methoxycarbonyl)&#8208; (1a(Me)&#8208;a and 1a(Me)&#8208;b), 7,7,8,8&#8208;tetrakis(ethoxycarbonyl)&#8208; (1b(Et)), and 7,7,8,8&#8208;tetrakis(bromoethoxycarbonyl)&#8208; (1c(BrEt)).&#160;&#160; The comparative study clarified that the reactivities and crystal structures are classified into four types that link to each other.&#160;&#160; This linkage is understandable when we analyze the crystal structures through the following hierarchical and asymmetric assemblies; conformers, dimers, 1D&#8208;columns, 2D&#8208;sheets, and 3D&#8208;stacked sheets (3D&#8208;crystals).&#160;&#160; This supramolecular viewpoint is supported by intermolecular interaction energies among neighbored molecules with the density functional theory (DFT) calculation.&#160;&#160; Such research enables us to elucidate the substituent&#8208;responsive reactivities of the crystals, and reminds us of the selection of the right path in a so&#8208;called &#8220;maze game&#8221;.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Three&#8208;membered carbocyclic&#8208; and heterocyclic ring structures are versatile synthetic building blocks in organic synthesis owing to their biological importance. Also, the inherent strain of these three&#8208;membered rings led to their ring&#8208;opening functionalization via C&#8208;C, C&#8208;N, and C&#8208;O bond cleavage. Traditional synthesis and ring&#8208;opening methods of these molecules require the usage of acid catalysts or transition&#8208;metals. Recently, electroorganic synthesis has emerged as a powerful tool for initiating new chemical transformations. In this review, the synthetic and mechanistic aspects of electro&#8208;mediated synthesis and ring&#8208;opening functionalization of three&#8208;membered carbo&#8208; and heterocycles are highlighted.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Sub&#8208;Nanochannels Formed inside Solid&#8208;State Nanopore with Proton Ultra&#8208;High Selectivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
UiO&#8208;66&#8208;(NH2)2 and UiO&#8208;66&#8208;(NH&#8208;SAG)2 were grown in&#8197;situ within the pores of quartz nanopores for super&#8208;selective proton transport. When the UiO&#8208;66&#8208;(NH&#8208;SAG)2 nanopores are prepared by further post&#8208;modification with sulfo&#8208;acetic acid, it is difficult for lithium ions to pass through the channels, but the protons can facilitate the transport of protons, resulting in ultrahigh selectivity for protons.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;Organic frameworks (MOFs) have the advantages of high porosity, angstrom&#8208;scale pore size, and unique structure. In this work, a kind of MOFs, UiO&#8208;66 and its derivatives (including aminated UiO&#8208;66&#8208;(NH2)2 and sulfonated UiO&#8208;66&#8208;(NH&#8208;SAG)2), were constructed on the inner surface of solid&#8208;state nanopores for ultra&#8208;selective proton transport. UiO&#8208;66 and UiO&#8208;66&#8208;(NH2)2 nanocrystal particles were in&#8208;situ grown at the orifice of glass nanopores firstly, which were used to investigate the ionic current responses in LiCl and HCl solutions when the monovalent anions (Cl&#8722;) were unchanged. Compared with UiO&#8208;66&#8208;modifed nanopores, the aminated MOFs modification (UiO&#8208;66&#8208;(NH2)2) can improve the proton selectivity obviously. However, when the UiO&#8208;66&#8208;(NH&#8208;SAG)2 nanopore is prepared by further post&#8208;modification with sulfo&#8208;acetic acid, lithium ions can hardly pass through the channel, and the interaction between protons and sulfonic acid groups can promote the transport of protons, thus achieving ultra&#8208;high selectivity to protons. This work provides a new way to achieve sub&#8208;nanochannels with high selectivity, which can widely be used in ion separation, sensing and energy conversion.

         <title>Anion Effects on Spin Crossover Systems: From Supramolecular Chemistry to Magnetism</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anions with diverse types and geometries have been widely used for the synthesis of ionic spin crossover (SCO) complexes. Anions can be classified into different configurations, and the various configurations and types of anions can significantly influence the supramolecular interactions and stacking modes between anions and cations in compounds, ultimately leading to changes in the SCO properties.







Abstract
The field of anion supramolecular chemistry has received more and more attention in recent years. Anions with diverse types and geometries have been widely used for the synthesis of ionic spin crossover (SCO) complexes. This review is devoted to anion effects on the molecular, supramolecular structures and magnetic properties of discrete SCO compounds. Firstly, typical anions used in the synthesis of these compounds are briefly summarized according to their various geometries. This is followed by a collection of representative examples of anion&#8208;based SCO compounds, whose SCO properties are analyzed in terms of supramolecular interactions, geometry and charge of anions. In the third part, anion effects on SCO complexes of different kinds of metal centers and ligands are outlined and finally remarks on the synthesis new type of ionic SCO complexes in the future are described.

         <title>Regulating Magnetic Relaxations of Cyano&#8208;Bridged {DyIIIMoV} Systems by Tuning the N&#8208;Sites in &#946;&#8208;Diketone Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Four cyano&#8208;bridged {DyIIIMoV} complexes 1&#8211;4, consisting of DyIII ions, &#946;&#8208;diketone (HLn: n=1, 2, 3, 4) ligands, and [Mo(CN)8]3&#8722;, are obtained by adjusting the N&#8208;sites of &#946;&#8208;diketone ligands. Their magnetic properties are highly dependent on the magnetic axis and magnetic anisotropy of the DyIII centers, which can be regulated by different coordination environments (DyOnN(8&#8208;n): n=5, 6, 7) of the DyIII centers.







Abstract
Cyano&#8208;bridged 4d&#8211;4f molecular nanomagnets have re&#8208;called increasing research interests in molecular magnetism since they offer more possibilities in achieving novel nanomagnets with versatile structures and magnetic interactions. In this work, four &#946;&#8208;diketone ligands bearing different substitution N&#8208;sites were designed and synthesized, namely 1&#8208;(2&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;3&#8208;(3&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;1,3&#8208;propanedione (HL1), 1,3&#8208;Bis (3&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;1,3&#8208;propanedione (HL2), 1&#8208;(4&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;3&#8208;(3&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;1,3&#8208;propanedione (HL3), and 1,3&#8208;Bis (4&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;1,3&#8208;propanedione (HL4), to tune the magnetic relaxation behaviors of cyano&#8208;bridged {DyIIIMoV} systems. By reacting with DyCl3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;6H2O and K4Mo(CN)8&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2H2O, four cyano&#8208;bridged complexes, namely {[Dy[MoV(CN)8](HL1)2(H2O)3]}&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;6H2O (1), {[Dy[MoV(CN)8](HL2)(H2O)3(CH3OH)]}2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2CH3OH&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;3H2O (2), {[Dy[MoV(CN)8](HL3)(H2O)2(CH3OH)]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;H2O}n (3), and {[Dy[MoV(CN)8](HL4)2(H2O)3]} &#8901;&#8201;2H2O&#8901;CH3OH (4) were obtained. Structural analyses revealed that 1 and 4 are binuclear complexes, 2 has a tetragonal structure, and 3 exhibits a stair&#8208;like polymer chain structure. The DyIII ions in all complexes have eight&#8208;coordinated configurations with the coordination spheres DyO7N1 for 1 and 4, DyO6N2 for 2, and DyO5N3 for 3. Magnetic measurements indicate that 1 is a zero&#8208;field single&#8208;molecule magnet (SMM) and complexes 2&#8211;4 are field&#8208;induced SMMs, with complex 4 featuring a two&#8208;step relaxation process. The magnetic characterizations and ab initio calculations revealed that changing the N&#8208;sites in the &#946;&#8208;diketone ligands can effectively alter the structures and magnetic properties of cyano&#8208;bridged 4d&#8211;4f nanomagnets by adjusting the coordination environments of the DyIII centers.

&lt;p&gt;Four cyano-bridged {Dy&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;Mo&lt;sup&gt;V&lt;/sup&gt;} complexes &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;&#8211;&lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;, consisting of Dy&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; ions, &lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;-diketone (HL&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;: n=1, 2, 3, 4) ligands, and [Mo(CN)&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;3&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, are obtained by adjusting the N-sites of &lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;-diketone ligands. Their magnetic properties are highly dependent on the magnetic axis and magnetic anisotropy of the Dy&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; centers, which can be regulated by different coordination environments (DyO&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;(8-n)&lt;/sub&gt;: n=5, 6, 7) of the Dy&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; centers.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cyano-bridged 4d&#8211;4f molecular nanomagnets have re-called increasing research interests in molecular magnetism since they offer more possibilities in achieving novel nanomagnets with versatile structures and magnetic interactions. In this work, four &lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;-diketone ligands bearing different substitution N-sites were designed and synthesized, namely 1-(2-pyridyl)-3-(3-pyridyl)-1,3-propanedione (HL&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;), 1,3-Bis (3-pyridyl)-1,3-propanedione (HL&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), 1-(4-pyridyl)-3-(3-pyridyl)-1,3-propanedione (HL&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;), and 1,3-Bis (4-pyridyl)-1,3-propanedione (HL&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;), to tune the magnetic relaxation behaviors of cyano-bridged {Dy&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;Mo&lt;sup&gt;V&lt;/sup&gt;} systems.

         <title>Selective Hydroxylation of C(sp3)&#8722;H Bonds in Steroids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Steroids are C(sp3)&#8208;rich structures and are highly prevalent in small&#8208;molecule therapeutics, with the level of oxidation being key to their biological activity and physicochemical properties. This review covers highly selective methods for the hydroxylation of steroidal C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds: biocatalysis, metal&#8208;catalysed C&#8722;H oxidation, and organic oxidants, such as dioxiranes and oxaziridines.







Abstract
Steroids are highly prevalent structures in small&#8208;molecule therapeutics, with the level of oxidation being key to their biological activity and physicochemical properties. These C(sp3)&#8208;rich tetracycles contain many stereocentres, which are important for creating specific vectors and protein binding orientations. Therefore, the ability to hydroxylate steroids with a high degree of regio&#8208;, chemo&#8208; and stereoselectivity is essential for researchers working in this field. This review will cover three main methods for the hydroxylation of steroidal C(sp3)&#8722;H bonds: biocatalysis, metal&#8208;catalysed C&#8722;H hydroxylation and organic oxidants, such as dioxiranes and oxaziridines.

         <title>Iron&#8208;Mediated C&#8722;H Functionalization of Unactivated Alkynes for the Synthesis of Derivatized Dihydropyrrolones: Regioselectivity Under Thermodynamic Control</title>

         <dc:description>
Cyclopentadienyliron species mediate propargylic C&#8722;H functionalization of simple, unactivated alkynes for the synthesis of densely substituted and diversely functionalized dihydropyrrolones. High regioselectivities are observed under conditions of thermodynamic control.







Abstract
Cyclopentadienyliron dicarbonyl&#8208;based complexes present opportunities for underexplored disconnections in synthesis. Access to challenging dihydropyrrolone products is achieved by propargylic C&#8722;H functionalization of alkynes for the formation of cyclic organoiron species. Excellent regioselectivity for unsymmetrical alkynes is observed in many cases. Notably, regioselectivity under these stoichiometric conditions diverges from those observed previously under catalysis, occurring at the more&#8208;substituted terminus of the alkyne, allowing for methine functionalization and the formation of quaternary centers. Divergent demetallation of the intermediate organoiron complexes gives access to chemically diverse products which are amenable to further functionalization.

         <title>Deuteration Degree&#8208;Controllable Methylation via a Cascade Assembly Strategy using Methylamine&#8208;Water as Methyl Source</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methylamine&#8208;water system was developed as a new methyl source for the methylation of &#946;&#8208;diketones under mild photocatalytic reaction conditions. Degree&#8208;controllable deuterated methylation could be easily achieved by using distinct combinations of d&#8208;methylamine&#8208;D2O system, allowing for the synthesis of deuterium&#8208;labelled bioactive molecules with a controllable number ranging from 0 to 3.







Abstract
We present a novel and effective photocatalytic method for the methylation of &#946;&#8208;diketones with controllable degrees of deuterium incorporation via development of new methyl sources. By utilizing a methylamine&#8208;water system as the methyl precursor and a cascade assembly strategy for deuteration degree control, we synthesized methylated compounds with varying degrees of deuterium incorporation, showcasing the versatility of this approach. We examined a range of &#946;&#8208;diketone substrates and synthesized key intermediates for drug and bioactive compounds with varying degrees of deuterium incorporation, ranging from 0 to 3. We also investigated and discussed the postulated reaction pathway. This work demonstrates the utility of readily available reagents, methylamines and water, as a new methyl source, and provides a simple and efficient strategy for the synthesis of degree&#8208;controllable deuterium&#8208;labelled compounds.

         <title>Improved Luminous Efficiency of AgInS2 Quantum Dots and Zeolitic Imidazolate Framework&#8208;70 Composite for White Light Emitting Diode Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
AgInS2 quantum dots (AIS QDs) are successfully introduced into the ZIF&#8208;70 framework via microwave assisted&#8208;hydrothermal method. The ZIF&#8208;70 matrix is beneficial to prevent the quenching of QDs and increase the luminous efficiency of QDs&#8208;based WLED from 5.44&#8197;lm/W to 36.76&#8197;lm/W.







Abstract
The application of multiple quantum dots (QDs) in the field of white light emitting diodes (WLEDs) is still an important challenge due to their low luminous efficiency and quenching phenomenon. In this paper, we prepared AgInS2 QDs/zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;70 (AIS/ZIF&#8208;70) composite by a microwave hydrothermal method. Owing to the high porosity and stability of ZIF&#8208;70, it could effectively prevent quenching issues due to the aggregation of QDs. Since the ZIF&#8208;70 and QDs were chemically bonded, the formation of the ZnS layer could effectively passivate the surface defect and thus the quantum yield reached 21.49&#8201;% in aqueous solution. The luminous efficiency (LE) of the assembled AIS/ZIF&#8208;based WLED was reinforced by 6.8&#8197;times with a molar ratio of AgIn/Zn=18, i.&#8201;e. at 5.26&#8201;% molar fraction of ZIF&#8208;70. Moreover, the color rendering index (CRI) and correlated color temperature (CCT) of AIS/ZIF&#8208;based WLED were 84.3 and 3631&#8197;K, respectively, indicating its potential application in solid&#8208;state lighting.

&lt;p&gt;AgInS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; quantum dots (AIS QDs) are successfully introduced into the ZIF-70 framework via microwave assisted-hydrothermal method. The ZIF-70 matrix is beneficial to prevent the quenching of QDs and increase the luminous efficiency of QDs-based WLED from 5.44&#8197;lm/W to 36.76&#8197;lm/W.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The application of multiple quantum dots (QDs) in the field of white light emitting diodes (WLEDs) is still an important challenge due to their low luminous efficiency and quenching phenomenon. In this paper, we prepared AgInS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; QDs/zeolitic imidazolate framework-70 (AIS/ZIF-70) composite by a microwave hydrothermal method. Owing to the high porosity and stability of ZIF-70, it could effectively prevent quenching issues due to the aggregation of QDs. Since the ZIF-70 and QDs were chemically bonded, the formation of the ZnS layer could effectively passivate the surface defect and thus the quantum yield reached 21.49&#8201;% in aqueous solution. The luminous efficiency (LE) of the assembled AIS/ZIF-based WLED was reinforced by 6.8&#8197;times with a molar ratio of AgIn/Zn=18, i.&#8201;e. at 5.26&#8201;% molar fraction of ZIF-70. Moreover, the color rendering index (CRI) and correlated color temperature (CCT) of AIS/ZIF-based WLED were 84.3 and 3631&#8197;K, respectively, indicating its potential application in solid-state lighting.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Covalently Modified MoS2 Bearing a Hamilton&#8208;Type Receptor for Recognizing a Redox&#8208;Active Ferrocene&#8208;Barbiturate Guest via Multiple H&#8208;Bonds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Hamilton&#8208;type recognition motif is realized on the surface of 1T&#8208;MoS2 where host&#8208;guest interactions are taking place via hydrogen bonding for the electrochemical sensing of barbiturates.







Abstract
The covalent modification of the metallic phase of MoS2 with a Hamilton&#8208;type ligand is presented, transforming MoS2 to a recognition platform which is able to embrace barbiturate moieties via hydrogen bonding. The successful hydrogen bonding formation is easily monitored by simple electrochemical assessments, if a ferrocene&#8208;labeled barbiturate analogue is utilized as a proof of concept. Full spectroscopic, thermal, and electron microscopy imaging characterization is provided for the newly formed recognition system, along with valuable insights concerning the electrochemical sensing. The given methodology expands beyond the sensing applications, confidently entering the territory of supramolecular interactions on the surface of 2D transition metal dichalcogenides. The well&#8208;designed host&#8208;guest chemistry presented herein, constitutes a guide and an inspiration for hosting customized&#8208;structured functional building blocks on MoS2 and its relatives via hydrogen bonding, opening up new opportunities regarding potential applications.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Solid&#8208;State Polymer Electrolyte in Li&#8208;LiFePO4, Li&#8208;S and Li&#8208;O2 Batteries</title>

A new electrolyte membrane based on crystalline poly(ethylene glycol)dimethyl ether (PEGDME) allows the development of efficient, safe and high&#8208;energy lithium metal solid&#8208;polymer batteries with different cathodes, including LiFePO4, sulfur or oxygen operating at room temperature.







Abstract
A solid polymer electrolyte has been developed and employed in lithium&#8208;metal batteries of relevant interest. The material includes crystalline poly(ethylene glycol)dimethyl ether (PEGDME), LiTFSI and LiNO3 salts, and a SiO2 ceramic filler. The electrolyte shows ionic conductivity more than 10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at room temperature and approaching 10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 60&#8201;&#176;C, a Li+&#8208;transference number exceeding 0.3, electrochemical stability from 0 to 4.4&#8197;V vs. Li+/Li, lithium stripping/deposition overvoltage below 0.08&#8197;V, and electrode/electrolyte interphase resistance of 400&#8197;&#937;. Thermogravimetry indicates that the electrolyte stands up to 200&#8201;&#176;C without significant weight loss, while FTIR spectroscopy suggests that the LiTFSI conducting salt dissolves in the polymer. The electrolyte is used in solid&#8208;state cells with various cathodes, including LiFePO4 olivine exploiting the Li&#8208;insertion, sulfur&#8211;carbon composite operating through Li conversion, and an oxygen electrode in which reduction and evolution reactions (i.&#8201;e., ORR/OER) evolve on a carbon&#8208;coated gas diffusion layer (GDL). The cells operate reversibly at room temperature with a capacity of 140&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 3.4&#8197;V for LiFePO4, 400&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 2&#8197;V for sulfur electrode, and 500&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 2.5&#8197;V for oxygen. The results suggest that the electrolyte could be applied in room&#8208;temperature solid polymer cells.

         <title>Photochemical Aminochlorination of Alkenes without the Use of an External Catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photochemical aminochlorination of alkenes: Appropriate tuning of the irradiation wavelength leads to a mild photochemical protocol for the aminochlorination of alkenes, bypassing the need of an external photocatalyst or the use of the more labile N&#8722;I or N&#8722;Br starting materials for the 1,2&#8208;aminohalogenation reactions.







Abstract
The niche field of photochemistry offers opportunities that are not found in &#8220;traditional&#8221; ground state chemical pathways. Aminochlorinated derivatives are an interesting family of 1,2&#8208;difunctionalised compounds that provide access to a variety of natural products and pharmaceutical active substances. A practical, catalyst&#8208;free chloroamination protocol is described herein, providing access to intermediates of great importance, utilising mild and photochemical reaction conditions (370&#8197;nm), where N&#8208;chlorosulfonamides are used as both nitrogen and chlorine sources. A wide variety of olefins, decorated with a plethora of functional groups, was tested providing excellent results (28&#8197;examples, 18&#8211;88&#8201;% yield). Mechanistic studies (UV&#8208;Vis, control experiments and quantum yield measurement) were also performed.

         <title>Synergistic promotion of large&#8208;current water splitting through interfacial engineering of hierarchically structured CoP&#8208;FeP nanosheets with rich P vacancies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The development of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalysts with high performance under large current density is still a challenge. Introducing P vacancies in heterostructure is an appealing strategy to enhance HER kinetics. In this study, we investigated a CoP&#8208;FeP heterostructure catalyst with abundant P vacancies (Vp&#8208;CoP&#8208;FeP/NF) on nickel foam (NF), which was prepared using dipping and phosphating treatment. The optimized Vp&#8208;CoP&#8208;FeP catalyst exerted prominent HER catalytic capability, requiring an ultra&#8208;low overpotential (58 mV @ 10 mA cm&#8208;2) and displaying robust durability (50 h @ 200 mA cm&#8208;2) in 1.0 M KOH solution. Furthermore, the catalyst demonstrated superior overall water splitting activity as cathode, demanding only cell voltage of 1.76 V at 200 mA cm&#8208;2, outperforming Pt/C/NF(&#8722;) || RuO2/NF(+). The catalyst's outstanding performance can be attributed to the hierarchical structure of porous nanosheets, abundant P vacancies, and synergistic effect between CoP and FeP components, which promote water dissociation and H* adsorption and desorption, thereby synergically accelerating HER kinetics and enhancing HER activity. Our study demonstrates the potential of HER catalysts with phosphorus&#8208;rich vacancies that can work under industrial&#8208;scale current density, highlighting the importance of developing durable and efficient catalysts for hydrogen production.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular hydrogels formed by the self&#8208;assembly of N&#8208;Fmoc&#8208;L&#8208;phenylalanine derivatives are gaining relevance for several applications in the materials and biomedical fields. In the challenging attempt to predict or tune their properties, we selected Fmoc&#8208;pentafluorophenylalanine (1) as a model efficient gelator, and studied its self&#8208;assembly in the presence of benzamide (2), a non&#8208;gelator able to form strong hydrogen bonding with the amino acid carboxylic group. Equimolar mixtures of 1 and 2 in organic solvents afforded a 1:1 co&#8208;crystal thanks to the formation of an acid&#183;&#183;&#183;amide heterodimeric supramolecular synthon. The same synthon occurred in the transparent gels formed by mixing the two components in 1:1 ratio in aqueous media, as revealed by structural, spectroscopic, and thermal characterizations performed on both the co&#8208;crystal powder and the lyophilized hydrogel. These findings revealed the possibility to modulate the properties of amino acid&#8208;based hydrogels, by involving the gelator in the formation of a co&#8208;crystal. Such crystal engineering&#8208;based approach is demonstrated to be also useful for the time&#8208;delayed release of suitable bioactive molecules, when involved as hydrogel coformers.</dc:description>

         <title>EPR Sensing of Cation Species by Aza&#8208;Crown Ethers Incorporating a Persistent Nitroxidic Radical Unit</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>New nitroxides based on aza&#8208;crown ethers were prepared and employed as selective sensors for the detection of inorganic and organic cations by EPR analysis of the corresponding host&#8208;guest complexes. The nitroxide unit behaves as a sensitive probe for a number of alkali and alkaline earth metal cations affording EPR spectra differing in the value of nitrogen hyperfine constants and in the appearance of splitted signals due to non&#8208;zero nuclear spin of some metal cation upon complexation. Owing to the remarkable EPR spectral differences between the host and the corresponding cation complex the new macrocycles are likely to act as multitasking tools to recognize several cationic species. EPR behaviour of the larger nitroxide azacrown 1&#8226; when acting as a wheel in a radical synthetic bistable [2]rotaxane containing both secondary dialkylammonium and 1,2&#8208;bis(pyridinium) molecular stations, was also investigated. Reversible movements of the macrocycle between the two recognition sites in the rotaxane were promptly revealed by EPR, which shows significant changes either in nitrogen coupling constant values (aN) or in the spectral shape in the two rotaxane co&#8208;conformations.</dc:description>

         <title>Photolysis of an Archetypal Model Complex. Photooxidation Versus Photoreduction of Azido(porphinato)iron(III).</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Azidoporphinatoiron(III) ([1]) is an archetypal model complex for the photochemical generation of nitridoiron(V) complexes via cleavage of dinitrogen. So far, this process has only been studied with continuous irradiation in thin films under cryogenic conditions or in frozen solutions. In addition, the photooxidation from iron(III) to iron(V) competes with photoreduction to iron(II) via cleavage of an azidyl radical. The quantum yields of both pathways remained hitherto undisclosed. Here, we investigated the photolysis of this model complex in room temperature liquid solution using stationary and time&#8208;resolved infrared spectroscopy. The two reaction pathways are unambiguously identified in quenching studies and their quantum yields are accurately determined. Nitridoporphinatoiron(V) ([2]) exhibits N&#8208;atom&#8208;2&#8208;electron&#8208;transfer reactivity toward tert&#8208;butyl isonitrile and forms a carbodiimido species. In the presence of tert&#8208;butyl isonitrile, the two products of the photoreduction pathway react to cationic diisonitriloporphinatoiron(III) and azide anions, which in turn combine to reform [1] and the quencher.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Black Phosphorene Quantum Dots from Red Phosphorus</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phosphorene quantum dots (PQDs) are most commonly derived from high&#8208;cost black phosphorus, while previous syntheses from the low&#8208;cost red phosphorus (Pred) allotrope are highly oxidised. Herein, we present an intrinsically scalable method to producing high quality PQDs, by first ball&#8208;milling Pred to create nanocrystalline Pblack and subsequent reductive etching using lithium electride solvated in liquid ammonia. The resultant ~25 nm PQDs are crystalline with low oxygen content, and spontaneously soluble as individualized monolayers in tertiary amide solvents, as directly imaged by liquid&#8208;phase transmission electron microscopy. This new method presents a scalable route to producing quantities of high quality PQDs for academic and industrial applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Finding Order in Disorder &#8211; The Highly Disordered Lithium Oxonitridophosphate Double Salt Li8+ x P3O10&#8722; x N1+ x  (x = 1.4(5))</title>

         <dc:description>The crystalline lithium oxonitridophosphate Li8+xP3O10&#8722;xN1+x was synthesized in an ampoule synthesis from P3N5 and Li2O. The compound crystallizes in the triclinic space group P[[EQUATION]] with a = 5.125(2), b = 9.888(5), c = 10.217(5) &#197;, &#945; = 70.30(2), &#946; = 76.65(2), &#947; = 77.89(2)&#176;. Li8+xP3O10&#8722;xN1+x is a double salt, the structure of which contains distinctive complex anion species, namely non&#8208;condensed P(O,N)4 tetrahedra, and P(O,N)7 double tetrahedra connected by one N atom. Additionally, there is mixed occupation of O/N positions, which enables further anionic species by variation of O/N occupancies. To characterize these motifs in detail, complementary analytical methods were applied. The double tetrahedron exhibits significant disorder in single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Furthermore, the title compound is a Li+ ion conductor with a total ionic conductivity of 1.2 &#215; 10&#8722;7 S cm&#8208;1 at 25 &#176;C, and a corresponding total activation energy of 0.47(2) eV.</dc:description>

         <title>Gold(I)&#8208;mediated Isomerization of Spring&#8208;loaded 1,7&#8208;Enynes seen through the Lens of Density Functional Theory</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We propose a mechanism for the previously reported formation of benzobicyclo[3.2.0]heptane derivatives from 1,7&#8208;enyne derivatives bearing a terminal cyclopropane. Our calculations support the formation of the product through two sequential cyclopropane openings followed by the formation of an oxonium intermediate. The subsequent breakage of carbon&#8208;oxygen bond acts as driving force for the formation of an allene group. The DFT calculations also shed light on the reaction divergence depending on the substituents. These mechanistic insights will help guide the future development in the synthesis of challenging scaffolds through gold(I) catalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Versatile Synthesis of Symmetric and Unsymmetric Imines via Photoelectrochemical Catalysis: Application to N&#8208;Terminal Modification of Phenylalanine</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A strategy that combines electrochemical synthesis and photoredox catalysis was reported for the efficient synthesis of imines. This approach was demonstrated to be highly versatile in producing various types of imines, including symmetric and unsymmetric imines, by exploring the impact of different substituents on the benzene ring of the arylamine. Additionally, the method was specifically applied to modify N&#8208;terminal phenylalanine residues and was found to be successful in photoelectrochemical bioconjugation between NH2&#8208;Phe&#8208;OMe and aryl methylamines, leading to the synthesis of phenylalanine&#8208;containing imines. Therefore, this technique would present a convenient and efficient platform for synthesizing imines, with promising applications in chemical biology, drug development, and organic synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>A Membrane&#8208;Free Decoupled Water Electrolyzer Operating at Simulated Fluctuating Renewables with Tri&#8208;functional NiCo&#8208;P Electrode</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Water electrolysis has been considered a promising technology for the conversion of renewables to hydrogen. However, preventing mixing of products (H2 and O2) and exploring cost&#8208;efficient electrolysis components remains challenging for conventional water electrolyzers. Herein, we design a membrane&#8208;free decoupled water electrolysis system using graphite felt supported nickel&#8208;cobalt phosphate (GF@NixCoy&#8208;P) material as a tri&#8208;functional (redox mediator, hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER)) electrode. The versatile GF@Ni1Co1&#8208;P electrode obtained by one&#8208;step electrodeposition not only exhibits high specific capacity (176 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.5 A g&#8208;1) and long cycle life (80% capacity retention after 3000 cycles) as a redox mediator, but also has relatively outstanding catalytic activities for HER and OER. The excellent properties of the GF@NixCoy&#8208;P electrode endow this decoupled system with more flexibility for H2 production by fluctuating renewable energies. This work provides guidance for multifunctional applications of transition metal compounds between energy storage and electrocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Gas permeation through mechanically resistant self&#8208;standing membranes of a neat amorphous organic cage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis and characterization of a novel film&#8208;forming organic cage and of its smaller analogue are here described. While the small cage produced single crystals suitable for X&#8208;ray diffraction studies, the large one was isolated as a dense film. Due to its remarkable film&#8208;forming properties, this latter cage could be solution&#8208;processed into transparent thin&#8208;layer films and mechanically stable dense self&#8208;standing membranes of controllable thickness. Thanks to these peculiar features, the membranes were also successfully tested for gas permeation, reporting a behavior similar to that found with stiff glassy polymers such as polymers of intrinsic microporosity or polyimides. Considering the growing interest in the development of molecular&#8208;based membranes, e.g. for separation technologies and functional coatings, the properties of this organic cage were investigated by thorough analysis of their structural, thermal, mechanical and gas transport properties, and by detailed atomistic simulations.</dc:description>

         <title>Organocatalyzed Regioselective Synthesis of 1,5&#8208;Disubstituted 1,2,3&#8208;Triazolyl Glycoconjugates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A novel organocatalyzed [3+2] cycloaddition reaction of nitroolefins with glycosyl azides as well as organic azides has been developed for successful construction of 1,5&#8208;disubstituted triazolyl glycoconjugates. This metal&#8208;free and acid&#8208;free, regioselective synthetic protocol proceeds in the presence of only Schreiner thiourea organocatalysts, which enable the required activation of nitroolefins through double hydrogen bonding. The straightforward, operationally simple, and regioselectivity of this methodology, complementing to the classical RuAAC catalyzed synthesis of 1,5&#8208;disubstituted 1,2,3&#8208;triazoles. In the presence of catalytic amount of Schreiner thiourea, organic azides react with a broad array of nitroolefins producing a series of 1,5&#8208;disubstituted 1,2,3&#8208; triazoles in good yields.</dc:description>

         <title>Robust Biosensor Based on Carbon Nanotubes/Protein Hybrid Electrolyte Gated Transistors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Semiconducting single walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) are promising materials for biosensing applications with electrolyte&#8208;gated transistors (EGT). However, to be employed in EGT devices, SWCNTs often require lengthy solution&#8208;processing fabrication techniques. Here, we introduce a simple solution&#8208;based method that allows fabricating EGT devices from stable dispersions of SWCNTs/bovine serum albumin (BSA) hybrids in water. The dispersion is then deposited on a substrate allowing the formation of a SWCNTs random network as the semiconducting channel. We demonstrate that this methodology allows the fabrication of EGT devices with electric performances that allow their use in biosensing applications. We demonstrate their application for the detection of cortisol in solution, upon gate electrode functionalization with anti&#8208;cortisol antibodies. This is a robust and cost&#8208;effective methodology that sets the ground for a SWCNT/BSA&#8208;based biosensing platform that allows overcoming many limitations of standard SWCNTs biosensor fabrications.</dc:description>

         <title>A Rising Star: Luminescent Carbene&#8208;Metal&#8208;Amide Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Coinage metal (gold, silver, and copper) complexes are attractive candidates to substitute the widely studied noble metal complexes such as iridium(III) and platinum(II) as luminescent materials in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). However, the development of coinage metal complexes exhibiting high emission quantum yields and short exciton lifetimes is still a formidable challenge. In the past few years, coinage metal complexes featuring a carbene&#8208;metal&#8208;amide (CMA) motif have emerged as a new class of luminescent materials in OLEDs. Thanks to the coinage metal&#8208;bridged linear geometry, coplanar conformation, and the formation of excited states with dominant ligand&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer character and reduced metal d&#8208;orbital participation, most CMA complexes have high radiative rates via thermally activated delayed fluorescence. Currently, the family of CMA complexes have rapidly evolved and remarkable progresses in CMA&#8208;based OLEDs have been made. Here, a concept review of CMA complexes is presented, with a focus on molecular design principles, the correlation between molecular structure/conformation and optoelectronic properties, as well as OLED performance. The future prospects of CMA complexes are also discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Direct amination of benzene with ammonia by flow plasma chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Amine derivatives, including aniline and allylic amines, can be formed in a single&#8208;step process from benzene and an ammonia plasma in a micro&#8208;reactor. Different process parameters such as temperature, residence time, and plasma power were evaluated to improve the reaction yield and its selectivity toward aminated products and avoid hydrogenated or oligomerized products. In parallel, simulation studies of the process have been carried out to propose a global mechanism and gain a better understanding of the influence of the different process parameters. The exploration of diverse related alkenes showed that the double bonds, conjugation, and aromatization influenced the amination mechanism. Benzene was the best reactant for amination based on the lifetime of radical intermediates. Under optimized conditions, benzene was aminated in the absence of catalyst with a yield of 3.8% and a selectivity of 49% in various amino compounds,</dc:description>

         <title>Efficient Nitric Oxide Scavenging by Urea&#8208;Functionalized Push&#8208;Pull Chromophore Modulates NO&#8208;Mediated Diseases</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The excess nitric oxide (NO) produced in the body in response to bacterial/proinflammatory stimuli is responsible for several pathological conditions. The current approaches that target the production of excess NO, either through the inhibition of nitric oxide synthase enzyme or its downstream mediators have been clinically unsuccessful. With an aim to regulate the excess NO, we developed urea&#8208;functionalized push&#8208;pull chromophores containing 1,1,4,4&#8208;tetracyanobuta&#8208;1,3&#8208;dienes (TCBD) or expanded TCBD (eTCBD) as NO scavengers. The NMR mechanistic studies revealed that upon NO binding, these molecules are converted to uncommon stable NONOates. The unique emissive property of Urea&#8208;eTCBD enables its application in vitro, as aNO&#8208;sensor. Furthermore, the cytocompatible Urea&#8208;eTCBD, rapidly inactivated the NO released from LPS&#8208;activated cells. The therapeutic efficacy of the molecule in modulating NO&#8208;mediated pathological condition was confirmed using a carrageenan&#8208;induced inflammatory paw model and a corneal injury model. While the results confirm the advantages of scavenging the excess NO to address a multitude of NO&#8208;mediated diseases, the promising sensing and bioactivity of Urea&#8208;eTCBD can motivate further exploration of such molecules in allied areas of research.</dc:description>

         <title>Sequential Water Sorption/Desorption of a Nonporous Adaptive Organic Ligand Bridged Coordination Polymer for Atmospheric Moisture Harvesting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Moisture harvesters with favourable attributes such as easy synthetic availability and good processability as alternatives for atmospheric moisture harvesting (AWH) are desirable. We report here a novel nonporous anionic coordination polymer (CP) of uranyl squarate with methyl viologen (MV2+) as charge balancing ions (named U&#8208;Squ&#8208;CP) which displays intriguing sequential water sorption/desorption behavior as the relative humidity (RH) changes gradually. The evaluation of AWH performance of U&#8208;Squ&#8208;CP shows that it can absorb water vapor under air atmosphere at a low RH of 20% typical of the levels found in most dry regions of the world, and have good cycling durability, thus demonstrating the capability as a potential moisture harvester for AWH. To our knowledge, this is the first report on non&#8208;porous organic ligand bridged CP materials for AWH. Moreover, a stepwise water&#8208;filling mechanism for the water sorption/desorption process is deciphered by comprehensive characterizations combining single&#8208;crystal diffraction, which provides a reasonable explanation for the special moisture harvesting behaviour of this non&#8208;porous crystalline material.</dc:description>

         <title>Panchromatic Light Capturing Bis&#8208;Styryl BODIPY&#8208;Perylenediimide Donor&#8208;Acceptor Constructs: Occurrence of Sequential Energy Transfer Followed by Electron Transfer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two wide&#8208;band capturing donor&#8208;acceptor conjugates featuring bisstrylBODIPY and perylenediimide (PDI) have been newly synthesized and the occurrence of ultrafast excitation transfer from the 1PDI* to BODIPY, and a subsequent electron transfer from the 1BODIPY* to PDI has been demonstrated. Steady&#8208;state fluorescence and excitation spectral recordings provided evidence of singlet&#8208;singlet energy transfer in these dyads, and quenched fluorescence of bisstyrylBODIPY emission in the dyads suggested additional photo&#8208;events. The electrostatic potential surfaces of the S1 and S2 states, derived from time&#8208;dependent DFT calculations, supported excited charge transfer in these dyads. Spectroelectrochemical studies on one&#8208;electron oxidized and one&#8208;electron reduced dyads and the monomeric precursor compounds were also performed in a thin&#8208;layer optical cell under corresponding applied potentials. From this study, both bisstrylBODIPY.+ and PDI.&#8208; were possible to spectrally characterize and were subsequently utilized in characterizing the electron transfer products. Finally, pump&#8208;probe spectral studies were performed in dichlorobenzene under selective PDI and bisstyrylBODIPY excitation to secure energy and electron transfer evidence. The measured rate constants for energy transfer, kENT were in the range of 1011 s&#8208;1 while the electron transfer rate constants, kET were in the range of 1010 s&#8208;1 highlighting their potential use in solar energy harvesting and optoelectronic applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Antimalarial Agents Derived from Metal&#8208;Amodiaquine Complexes with Activity in Multiple Stages of the Plasmodium Life Cycle&#8224;</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Quinolines are excellent ligands for metal coordination and are deployed as drugs for malaria treatment. There is a growing body of evidence indicating that metal complexes can be conjugated with antimalarial quinolines to be used as chemical tools to overcome the disadvantages of quinolines, improving their bioactive speciation, cellular distribution, and subsequently broadening the spectrum of activity to multiple stages of the complex Plasmodium life cycle. In this study, four novel complexes of ruthenium(II) and gold(I) containing amodiaquine (AQ) were synthesized and a careful chemical characterization revealed the precise coordination site of AQ to the metals. Their speciation in solution was investigated, demonstrating the stability of the quinoline&#8208;metal bond. Ru(II)&#8208; and Au(I)&#8208;AQ complexes were demonstrated to be potent and efficacious in inhibiting parasite growth in multiple stages of the Plasmodium life cycle assayed in vitro and in vivo. These properties could be attributed to the ability of the metal&#8208;AQ complexes to reproduce the suppression of heme detoxification induced by AQ, while also inhibiting other processes in the parasite life cycle, which can be attributed to the action of the metallic species. These findings indicate that metal coordination is a potential chemical tool for drug design and discovery in malaria.</dc:description>

         <title>Diiminium Nucleophile Adducts are Stable and Convenient Strong Lewis Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Strong Lewis acids are essential tools for a manifold of chemical procedures, but their scalable deployment is limited by their costs and safety concerns. We report a scalable, convenient, and inexpensive synthesis of stable diiminium&#8208;based reagents with a Lewis acidic carbon centre. Coordination with pyridine donors stabilises these centres; the 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine adduct shows a chelation effect at carbon. Due to high fluoride, hydride, and oxide affinities, the diiminium pyridine adducts are promising soft and hard Lewis acids. They effectively produce acylpyridinium salts from carboxylates which can&#160;acylate amines to give amides and imides even from electronically intractable coupling partners.</dc:description>

         <title>Three oxidative addition routes of&#160;alkali metal aluminyls to dihydroaluminates and reactivity with CO2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Three distinct routes are reported to the soluble, dihydridoaluminate compounds, AM[Al(NONDipp)(H)2] (AM = Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs; [NONDipp]2&#8211; = [O(SiMe2NDipp)2]2&#8211;; Dipp = 2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3) starting from the alkali metal aluminyls, AM[Al(NONDipp)]. Direct H2 hydrogenation of the heavier analogues (AM = Rb, Cs) produced the first examples of structurally characterized rubidium and caesium dihydridoaluminates, although harsh conditions were required for complete conversion. Using 1,4&#8208;cyclohexadiene (1,4&#8208;CHD) as an alternative hydrogen source in transfer hydrogenation reactions provided a lower energy pathway to the full series of products for AM = Li &#8211; Cs. A further moderation in conditions was noted for the thermal decomposition of the (silyl)(hydrido)aluminates, AM[Al(NONDipp)(H)(SiH2Ph)]. Probing the reaction of Cs[Al(NONDipp)] with 1,4&#8208;CHD provided access to a novel inverse sandwich complex, [{Cs(Et2O)}2{Al(NONDipp)(H)}2(C6H6)], containing the 1,4&#8208;dialuminated [C6H6]2&#8211; dianion and representing the first time that an intermediate in the commonly utilized oxidation process of 1,4&#8208;CHD to benzene has been trapped. The synthetic utility of the newly installed Al&#8211;H bonds has been demonstrated by their ability to reduce CO2 under mild conditions to form the bis&#8208;formate AM[Al(NONDipp)(O2CH)2] compounds, which exhibit a diverse series of eyecatching bimetallacyclic structures.</dc:description>

         <title>Revisiting sp2 Dilithio Methandiides: From Geometric Curiosity to Simple Bonding Description</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reported tetracoordinate dilithio methandiide complex from Liddle and co&#8208;workers (1) is investigated from a coordination chemistry perspective, to probe the origin of its intriguing geometry. Through the application of a variety of computational techniques, non&#8208;covalent (steric, electrostatic) interactions are found to be dominant. Further, we arrive at a bonding description which emphasizes the tricoordinate sp2&#8208;hybridized nature of the central methandiide carbon, differing somewhat from the original proposal. Thus, 1 is distinct from other dilithio methandiides since it contains only one C&#8208;Li &#963;&#8208;bond, and is found to be comparable to a simple aryllithium compound, phenyllithium.</dc:description>

         <title>A Predictive Model for the Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Site&#8208;Selective Oxidation of Diols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Site&#8208;selectivity in the palladium&#8208;catalyzed mono&#8208;oxidation of diols can be predicted by a model, supported by experiments and computation. It explains the selective oxidation of hydroxy groups in cis&#8208;diols and the dependency of the rate on the configuration and conformational freedom. The model predicts whether a natural product comprising multiple hydroxy groups is suited for site&#8208;selective palladium&#8208;catalyzed oxidation.







Abstract
A predictive model, shaped as a set of rules, is presented that predicts site&#8208;selectivity in the mono&#8208;oxidation of diols by palladium&#8208;neocuproine catalysis. For this, the factors that govern this site&#8208;selectivity within diols and between different diols have been studied both experimentally and with computation. It is shown that an electronegative substituent antiperiplanar to the C&#8722;H bond retards hydride abstraction, resulting in a lower reactivity. This explains the selective oxidation of axial hydroxy groups in vicinal cis&#8208;diols. Furthermore, DFT calculations and competition experiments show how the reaction rate of different diols is determined by their configuration and conformational freedom. The model has been validated by the oxidation of several complex natural products, including two steroids. From a synthesis perspective, the model predicts whether a natural product comprising multiple hydroxy groups is a suitable substrate for site&#8208;selective palladium&#8208;catalyzed oxidation.

         <title>Photocatalytic Cross&#8208;Pinacol Coupling Promoted by Carbon Dioxide
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A first photocatalytic cross&#8208;pinacol coupling was achieved. The reaction proceeded with a various combination of two aldehydes, two ketones, or an aldehyde and a ketone to afford the corresponding unsymmetric vicinal 1,2&#8208;diols in up to 91&#8201;% yield. In this process, an umpoled anionic carbinol synthon was generated in&#8197;situ, by the assistance of CO2 additive, to react nucleophilically with a second electrophilic carbonyl compound.Photocatalytic Cross&#8208;Pinacol Coupling Promoted by Carbon Dioxide (S. Okumura, Y. Uozumi et al.)







Abstract
Cross&#8208;pinacol coupling of two different carbonyl compounds was achieved through successive one&#8208;electron transfer processes under photocatalytic conditions. In the reaction, an umpoled anionic carbinol synthon was generated in&#8197;situ to react nucleophilically with a second electrophilic carbonyl compound. It was revealed that a CO2 additive promoted the photocatalytic generation of the carbinol synthon to suppress undesired radical dimerization. A wide variety of aromatic and aliphatic carbonyl substrates underwent the cross&#8208;pinacol coupling to afford the corresponding unsymmetric vicinal 1,2&#8208;diols, in which even a combination of carbonyl reactants with similar structures such as two aldehydes and two ketones were also well tolerated with high cross&#8208;coupling selectivity.

         <title>A Novel Approach to &#945;&#8208;Arylacetonitrile Skeletons via para&#8208;Selective Alkylation of Protected Anilines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we report a ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed para&#8208;selective alkylation reaction with ethyl 2&#8208;bromo&#8208;2&#8208;cyanopropanoate as the novel alkylating reagent to directly form an &#945;&#8208;arylacetonitrile skeleton with quaternary carbon center. Various protected anilines were tolerated, yielding the corresponding products in moderate to good yields.







Abstract
A ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed para&#8208;selective alkylation of protected anilines to construct &#945;&#8208;arylacetonitrile skeletons has been reported. We firstly disclosed the ethyl 2&#8208;bromo&#8208;2&#8208;cyanopropanoate was an effective alkylating reagent in ruthenmuim&#8208;catalyzed remote&#8208;selective C&#8722;H functionalization. A wide variety of &#945;&#8208;arylacetonitrile skeletons can be directly obtained with moderate to good yields. Importantly, the products contain both nitrile and ester groups guaranteeing its direct transformation into other useful synthetic units, indicating the synthetic importance of this method.

         <title>A Bimetallic Benzene&#8208;1,2,4,5&#8208;Tetrathiolate (btt) Molybdenocene Complex Cp2Mo(btt)MoCp2: Radical and Diradical States</title>

The redox active bimetallic dithiolene complex Cp2Mo(btt)MoCp2 (Mo2B) exhibits four successive electron transfers up to the tetracation. The isolated dication [Cp2Mo(btt)MoCp2]2+, with either chair or boat conformations associated with folded MoS2C2 metallacycles, exhibits a diradical character and strong antiferromagnetic coupling.







Abstract
Benzene&#8208;1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrathiolate (btt) has been used as a bridging ligand to prepare a redox active (molybdenocene dithiolene)&#8208;based bimetallic complex Cp2Mo(btt)MoCp2, which exhibits four successive electron transfers up to the tetracation. Spectro&#8208;electrochemical investigations together with DFT and TD&#8208;DFT calculations evidence that the two electroactive MoS2C2 metallacycles are electronically coupled in the monocationic as in the dicationic state. Two salts of the dication [Cp2Mo(btt)MoCp2]2+ have been structurally characterized with PF6&#8722; and HSO4&#8722; counterions, showing different chair or boat conformations associated with variable folding angles of the two MoS2C2 metallacycles along the S&#8722;S hinge. The bis&#8208;oxidized dicationic complex exhibits a diradical character, with both radicals essentially localized on the metallacycles and with antiferromagnetic coupling evidenced from magnetic susceptibility measurements.

&lt;p&gt;Benzene-1,2,4,5-tetrathiolate (btt) has been used as a bridging ligand to prepare a redox active (molybdenocene dithiolene)-based bimetallic complex Cp&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Mo(btt)MoCp&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which exhibits four successive electron transfers up to the tetracation. Spectro-electrochemical investigations together with DFT and TD-DFT calculations evidence that the two electroactive MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; metallacycles are electronically coupled in the monocationic as in the dicationic state.
