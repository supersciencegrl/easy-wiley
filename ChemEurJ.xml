         <title>Development of CPA&#8208;Catalyzed&#160;&#946;&#8208;Selective Reductive Amination of Cardenolides for the Synthesis and Biological Evaluation of Hydrolytically Stable Analogs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This article describes the development of novel, hydrolytically stable cardiotonic steroid analogs featuring a 3&#946;&#8208;amine moiety instead of the commonly found 3&#946;&#8208;carbohydrates such as oleandrose. To establish the desired 3&#946;&#8208;configuration stereoselectively, a new method based on chiral phosphoric acid&#8208;controlled diastereoselective reductive amination with Hantzsch esters was developed. This method utilizes readily available unsubstituted (S)&#8208;BINOL&#8208;based hydrogen phosphate as the catalyst, enabling the synthesis of 13 different 5&#946;&#8208;androsterone and digitoxigenin analogs with up to 36:1&#946;:&#945;&#160;diastereoselectivity. Additionally, this strategy was applied to generate two novel oleandrigenin analogs&#160;15a&#160;and&#160;15gin 3 steps from readily available gitoxigenin. The synthetic analogs were subjected to the NCI&#8208;60 human tumor cell lines screen, and several different digitoxigenin derivatives with tumor cell growth inhibitory power in submicromolar range were identified. The subsequent&#160;in vitro&#160;evaluation of digitoxigenin and oleandrin derivatives&#160;13a,&#160;13g,&#160;15a, and&#160;15gdemonstrated that these four analogs reduced steady&#8208;state ATP1A1 levels in T98G cells in the 12&#8208;96 nM range. Interestingly, only the oleandrin analog&#160;15g&#160;also lowered also steady&#8208;state levels of the cellular prion protein (PrPC), the main therapeutic target for the treatment of prion diseases.</dc:description>

         <title>Solvent&#8208;free Electrode Fabrication for Next&#8208;generation Batteries: Inception or an Endgame?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The challenges and opportunities of the emerging solvent&#8208;free electrode fabrication method are discussed in the conceptual review considering the aspects of environmental impact, cost of production, and the resultant energy density.








Abstract
Solvent&#8208;free electrode fabrication (SEF) is a revolutionary advancement in the field of battery manufacturing, providing a compelling, solvent&#8208;free alternative to conventional slurry&#8208;based processing. SEF offers significant benefits, including reduced energy consumption resulting from the elimination of toxic solvents, solvent recovery steps, a lower environmental impact, overall cost reduction, and overcoming of binder migration, encountered during the fabrication of thicker electrodes. However, the practical application of SEF must overcome key challenges, such as achieving uniform particle distribution, ensuring strong electrode cohesion and adhesion, and scaling up to meet industrial production demands. This review provides a comprehensive assessment of the current landscape in dry electrode fabrication technologies, featuring advanced techniques such as dry pressing, spray dry deposition, and 3D printing. The fundamental chemistry of materials in addition to the mechanical, and electrochemical factors critical for optimizing battery performance is elaborated with a clear focus on lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) from lab to manufacturing stage. Moreover, the article highlights significant recent advancements, identifies critical technical barriers, and outlines imperative research directions necessary to unleash the full potential of dry electrode manufacturing in the realm of sustainable energy storage.

         <title>The Low Oxidation State Paradigm is More Consistent with XFEL Observations of the S&#8323; &#8594; [S&#8324;] &#8594; S&#8320; Transition in Photosystem II</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations within the LOS paradigm reproduce key XFEL observations of the S&#8323; &#8594; [S&#8324;] &#8594; S&#8320; transition in PSII. In contrast to the HOS model, the LOS framework explains both the disappearance of Ox during O&#8211;O bond formation and the unchanged Mn4&#8211;O5 distance in the peroxide intermediate.








Abstract
Photosynthetic water splitting catalyzed by the Mn4CaO5/6 cluster in the oxygen&#8208;evolving complex (OEC) of photosystem II (PSII) is crucial for sustaining the supply of oxygen on the Earth. A recent serial femtosecond X&#8208;ray crystallography (XFEL) study has provided unprecedented insights into the structural dynamics of the OEC during the S&#8323; &#8594; [S&#8324;] &#8594; S&#8320; transition, revealing that this process involves a peroxide intermediate formed via oxo&#8208;oxyl radical coupling between O5 and Ox. However, computational models based on the high oxidation state (HOS) paradigm have failed to explain key XFEL observations, including the apparent loss of Ox upon peroxide formation and the largely unchanged Mn4&#9472;O5 distance from S&#8324; to the peroxide intermediate. Here, we apply density functional theory to remodel the S4 &#8594; S0 transition within the low oxidation state (LOS) paradigm and show that this model yields results more consistent with the XFEL observations. Notably, this study demonstrates that the LOS paradigm can support the formation of an oxyl radical species essential for O&#9472;O coupling and subsequent O2 generation, a capability previously thought to be exclusive to the HOS model. Our findings offer an alternative explanation that complements existing models and broadens our understanding of the OEC mechanism.

         <title>Enhancing Proton Reaction Chemistry of Aqueous Zn&#9472;MnO2 Battery by Phosphate Proton Reservoir</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
ZPH as a proton reservoir enhances MnO&#8322; cathode performance in aqueous Zn&#9472;MnO&#8322; batteries. ZPH optimizes proton reaction chemistry, enabling high rate performance (219.2&#160;mA&#160;h&#160;g&#8722;&#185; at 3&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;&#185;), specific capacity (347.3&#160;mA&#160;h&#160;g&#8722;&#185; at 0.1&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;&#185;), and cycling stability (1500 cycles at 2&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;&#185;). This scalable strategy improves proton&#8208;involved reaction dynamics for grid&#8208;scale energy storage.








Abstract
Aqueous rechargeable Zn&#9472;MnO&#8322; batteries have emerged as promising candidates for grid&#8208;scale energy storage due to their low cost, high safety, natural abundance, and high working potential. However, their widespread application is hindered by rapid capacity degradation and sluggish reaction kinetics. In this study, we introduce Zn&#8323;(PO&#8324;)&#8322; 4H&#8322;O (ZPH) as a proton reservoir to significantly enhance the electrochemical performance of MnO&#8322; by optimizing proton reaction chemistry. Specifically, ZPH stores protons during charging and releases them during discharging, creating a localized H&#8314;&#8208;rich environment that facilitates proton intercalation of Mn&#8308;&#8314;/Mn3&#8314; and the two&#8208;electron transfer reaction of Mn&#8308;+/Mn2&#8314;. Leveraging the proton storage capability of ZPH, the layered MnO&#8322; cathode demonstrates exceptional rate performance (219.2&#160;mA&#160;h&#160;g&#8722;&#185; at 3&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;&#185;), high specific capacity (347.3&#160;mA&#160;h&#160;g&#8722;&#185; at 0.1&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;&#185;), and remarkable cycling performance (1500 cycles at 2&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;&#185;). This work provides a scalable and electrolyte&#8208;compatible pathway to optimize proton&#8208;involved reaction dynamics in aqueous Zn&#9472;MnO&#8322; batteries.

         <title>On the Importance of Balancing the pKa of the Additive in &#946;&#8208;Ketoenamine COF Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#946;&#8208;ketoenamine COFs are usually synthesized in the presence of acetic acid. Here, we report the surprising role of organobases TEA and DIPEA in achieving TpPa with high Brunauer&#8208;Emmett&#8208;Teller&#160;surface areas (&gt;1400 m2/g) and high crystallinity. The similar pKa values of TEA and DIPEA (10.8 and 11.0, resp.) and Tp (10.8) mark the importance of balancing the pKa for high&#8208;quality &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine COFs.








Abstract
Due to the irreversible tautomerization of imine linkages to their corresponding ketoenamines, &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine&#8208;linked Covalent Organic Frameworks (COFs) are a stable type of COF that displays high surface areas. In the solvothermal synthesis of such COFs, the use of (acetic) acid is ubiquitous. However, the effect of the added acid on the COF properties (notably their surface area) has never been investigated. Building on an extensive literature overview, we systematically studied the effect of the pKa of several added acids on COF performance characteristics and extended the investigation by including a series of (organo&#8208;)bases with varying pKa. Interestingly, the highest BET surface areas, above 1400 m2/g, were found in the alkaline region of the pKa window, with a maximum near pKa &#8764;10.8 for triethylamine (TEA) and N,N&#8208;diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA). Considering the pKa values related to the three phenolic hydroxyl groups of 2,4,6&#8208;triformylphloroglucinol, one of the COF building blocks, these organobases fully deprotonate two of these hydroxyl groups and partly deprotonate the third one, which optimizes the reaction rate of the &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine bond formation, explaining the improved COF crystallinity and associated microporosity. The largely overlooked use of organobases in the synthesis of &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine&#8208;linked COFs thus offers a promising approach to improve the COF performance.

         <title>Electronic and Magnetic Properties of Ferrous Iron in a True Square&#8208;Planar Molecular Environment</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spin Hamiltonian parameters of an iron(II) phthalocyanine are obtained by pNMR, THz&#8208;EPR, and quantum chemical calculations. Large zero field splitting and the peculiar g&#8208;tensor pattern originate from mixing of the 3A2g ground state with two 3Eg&#8208;excited states of almost the same energy. This forms the basis for correlations between magnetism, structure, and reactivity of iron in this important coordination environment.








Abstract
The electronic and magnetic properties of ferrous iron in the iron(II)&#8208;2,3,9,10,16,17,23,24&#8208;octakis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenoxy)phthalocyanine (FePcOAr), exhibiting a true square&#8208;planar molecular environment, are investigated. Inhibition of intermolecular interactions by steric substituents allows detailed investigation of the electronic structure arising from the planar geometry of the d6 electron configuration. Complementary magnetometry, M&#246;ssbauer, FD&#8208;FT THz&#8208;EPR (frequency&#8208;domain Fourier&#8208;transform terahertz electron paramagnetic resonance) and pNMR (nuclear magnetic resonance of paramagnetic molecules) spectroscopies show that FePcOAr has an S&#160;=&#160;1 ground state with large positive axial zero&#8208;field splitting (ZFS) and a strongly anisotropic g&#8208;tensor, with two g&#8208;values much larger than the free electron g&#8208;value and one smaller. Correlation between the magnetic properties and the electronic structure is provided by high&#8208;level quantum chemical calculations. The calculations indicate a nearly triply degenerate ground level, in which spin&#8208;orbit coupling mixes the isolated 3A2g ground state with two excited 3Eg states, whose energy gaps to the ground state are almost identical. These findings provide valuable insights in the electronic structure of iron phthalocyanines and the long&#8208;standing discussion on their true electronic ground level, which has important implications for the application of this important class of complexes in catalysis and magnetic materials.

         <title>Structural Engineering of 1D Porphyrin&#8208;Crbazole Covalent Organic Frameworks for Photocatalytic Organic Transformations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work proposes a rational 1D COF design strategy through building&#8208;block engineering, revealing how structural topology and charge separation govern photocatalytic performance. Optimized H2Por&#8208;Ph&#8208;CZ achieves superior photocatalytic activity in both oxidative amine coupling and &#945;&#8208;bromoacetophenone dehalogenation via enhanced surface area and charge transfer efficiency.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with 1D architectures hold great potential for photocatalysis but face challenges in rational structural design and charge transfer optimization. Herein, we report a series of 1D porphyrin (Por)&#8208;carbazole (CZ)&#8208;based COFs (MPor&#8208;Phn&#8208;CZ; M&#160;=&#160;H2, Zn; n&#160;=&#160;0, 1) constructed via symmetry&#8208;guided Schiff&#8208;base condensation. The integration of a phenyl spacer (Ph) and metal&#8208;free Por knots in H2Por&#8208;Ph&#8208;CZ enabled an eclipsed AA stacking mode, yielding enhanced crystallinity, a high specific surface area, and optimal donor&#8211;acceptor interactions. Systematic optoelectronic characterization revealed that H2Por&#8208;Ph&#8208;CZ exhibited superior visible&#8208;light absorption, minimized charge recombination, and directional electron transfer from CZ donors to Por acceptors, as validated by DFT calculations. These attributes endowed H2Por&#8208;Ph&#8208;CZ with exceptional photocatalytic activity in both the oxidative coupling of amines and reductive dehalogenation of &#945;&#8208;bromoacetophenone derivatives, outperforming Zn&#8208;incorporated and spacer&#8208;free analogs. This work establishes a design paradigm for 1D COFs through synergistic topology control and electronic modulation, advancing their application in sustainable organic synthesis.

         <title>Valence Electron Dependent Contraction of P6 Ring in [(CpM)2(&#956;,&#951;6:&#951;6&#8208;P6)] (M&#160;&#9552;&#160;V, Mo): A DFT Study</title>

         <dc:description>
VEC dictates the reactivity and extent of NHC&#8208;induced ring contraction in triple&#8208;decker (TD) complexes: 28 VEC leads to the contraction of P6 to a P&#8325; ring, whereas 26 VEC results in further contraction to a P&#8324; middle deck, facilitated by outer&#8208;sphere electron transfer.








Abstract
The P6 ring in [(Cp*Mo)2(&#956;,&#951;6:&#951;6&#8208;P6)] contracts to the P5 complex [(Cp*Mo)2(&#956;,&#951;5:&#951;5&#8208;P5)][(MeNHC)2P] by MeNHC. In contrast, P6 ring in [(Cp*V)2(&#956;,&#951;6:&#951;6&#8208;P6)] contracts to P5 and P4 complexes [(Cp*V)2(&#956;,&#951;5:&#951;5&#8208;P5)][(MeNHC)2P] and [(Cp*V)2(&#956;,&#951;4:&#951;4&#8208;P4MeNHC)]. In addition, an anionic form of the precursor [(Cp*V)2(&#956;,&#951;6:&#951;6&#8208;P6)][(MeNHC)2P] is also produced here. Mechanistic investigation using TPSSh&#8208;d4/Def2&#8208;TZVP method shows the importance of different spin states in the reaction and a possible outer sphere electron transfer aiding the ring contraction of P5 to P4. Valence electron count (VEC) determines the variety of spin states accessible to the complexes and plays a decisive role in deciding the fate of the middle deck.

Valence electron count (VEC) determines the variety of spin states accessible to the complexes and plays a decisive role in deciding the fate of the middle deck.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Supercritical CO2&#8208;Induced Ferromagnetism in 2D C3N4 for Catalysis in Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D ferromagnetic amorphous carbon nitride (a&#8208;C3N4) was successfully synthesized via supercritical CO2 treatment. The 2D ferromagnetic amorphous C3N4 substrate tuned the spin charge density of the loading Ru nanoparticles and accelerated the electrocatalytic HER kinetics.








Abstract
The exploration of highly efficient catalysts has been an essential challenge for the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, 2D amorphous carbon nitride (a&#8208;C3N4) with obvious ferromagnetism was achieved through a typical supercritical CO2 (SC CO2) treatment process. The experimental results revealed the structural and chemical transformations during the formation of a&#8208;C3N4. Subsequently, a&#8208;C3N4 anchored with Ru nanoparticles (Ru/a&#8208;C3N4) was successfully synthesized and employed as a catalyst for the electrocatalytic HER, exhibiting a significantly enhanced catalytic performance compared to Ru nanoparticles anchored on 2D graphitized carbon nitride (g&#8208;C3N4) without SC CO2 treatment. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further demonstrate that the ferromagnetic g&#8208;C3N4 substrate not only promotes disassociation of water molecules under alkaline conditions but also influences the charge distribution and modulates the free energy of H adsorption, finally accelerating the HER kinetics. These results impart significant insights into the electrocatalytic HER process and establish a foundation for the design of advanced catalysts with enhanced performance for energy conversion and storage applications.

         <title>Multifunctional Organelle&#8208;Targeting Probes for Intracellular Imaging and Enhanced Cancer Phototherapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>

Cy&#8208;NBD&#8208;5F was synthesized as a responsive photodynamic theranostic agent, featuring GSH&#8208;activated fluorescence signaling and enhanced Type&#8208;I&amp;II PDT for effective cancer treatment. After reacting with GSH, the active compound (Cy&#8208;OH&#8208;5F) successfully provides NIR emission and induces cancer cell death under light irradiation. In addition, the dual&#8208;organelle&#8208;targeting ability of this molecule could benefit the efficient therapeutic effects.








Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) represents a promising modality for cancer treatment; however, its clinical application is hindered by challenges such as glutathione (GSH)&#8208;mediated quenching of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and autofluorescence interference during visible light imaging. This study introduces Cy&#8208;NBD&#8208;5F, a photosensitizer engineered to address these limitations. Upon activation by GSH, Cy&#8208;NBD&#8208;5F exhibits 5.5&#8208;fold fluorescence enhancement at 701&#160;nm, producing its reduced form, Cy&#8208;OH&#8208;5F, which demonstrates enhanced ROS generation, including a 1.4&#8208;fold increase in singlet oxygen and 1.2&#8208;fold increase in superoxide anion radicals. Under light irradiation, Cy&#8208;OH&#8208;5F induces significant cytotoxicity (IC50&#160;&lt;&#160;3 &#181;M). Additionally, the molecule predominantly localizes within lysosomes and the endoplasmic reticulum, showing organelle&#8208;specific effects to improve therapeutic efficacy. These findings show the potential of Cy&#8208;NBD&#8208;5F as a precise and effective tool for cancer theranostics.

         <title>A Tour in the Chemistry of a Tricoordinate Rh(&#8722;I) Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The low&#8208;coordinated Rh(&#8722;I) complex displays a nonconventional reactivity, affording a Rh(I) compound in a trigonal&#8208;pyramidal geometry, a rare true metalloradical Rh(0) complex, a highly unsaturated 14 eV complex featuring a Rh&#160;&#8722;&#160;Si bond, and catalyzes a dimerization of aldehydes to the ester through a Rh(&#8208;I)/Rh(I) catalytic cycle with catalyst deactivation to an allylrhodium complex.








Abstract
The finding of the unprecedented 16&#8208;e tricoordinate planar rhodium(&#8722;&#921;) complex, K[Rh(IPr)(dvtms)] (K[1]) (IPr&#160;=&#160;1,3&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;diisopropylphenyl)imidazolyl&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene, dvtms&#160;=&#160;divinyltretramethyldisiloxane) prompted us to explore its reactivity. K[1] reacts as a nucleophile with methyliodide to give [Rh(IPr)(dvtms)Me], a Rh(&#921;) compound with an exceptional trigonal&#8208;pyramidal structure. Other haloalkanes abstract one electron from K[1] to give the previously reported [Rh0(IPr)(dvtms)] complex. K[1] also reacts with protonic acids and weak proton sources such as water and ketones to eventually give the rare tricoordinate 14&#8208;electron complex [RhI(IPr)(SiMe2OSiMe2CH&#160;=&#160;CH2)] with a Rh&#160;&#8722;Si bond. The 16&#8208;electron complex [RhI(IPr)(SiMe2OSiMe2CH&#160;=&#160;CH2)(H2C&#160;=&#160;CH2)] was characterized as an intermediate in this reaction. Furthermore, K[1] runs up to five cycles of catalytic condensation of nonenolizable aldehydes to esters, such as p&#8208;tolylaldehyde, before being fully converted into the inactive complex Rh(IPr)(&#951;3&#8208;C3H4ptolyl)(C2H4)] with fragmentation of the diolefin dvtms. Computational studies have provided valuable insights into the reactivity patterns and behavior of this complex, including those of the rhodium(&#8722;I)/rhodium(I) catalytic cycle.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Mediated Il&#8208;8 Binding to Heparan Sulfate Evaluated by Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy</title>

EIS demonstrates the effect of metal ion mediation of sulfation pattern and uronic acid stereochemistry&#8208;dependent IL&#8208;8 binding.








Abstract
Heparan sulfate (HS) interactions with interleukin 8 (IL&#8208;8) are crucial for immune system response. The structural features of the HS and the environmental entities, such as metal ions, can regulate these interactions. However, it is challenging to evaluate the effect of each parameter on the interactions because of low accessibility to well&#8208;defined saccharides and the lack of characteristic features to be determined by analytical tools. We evaluated the effect of the HS structural features on IL&#8208;8 binding affinity utilizing electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). We showed that the metal ions Ca2+ and Mg2+ dissimilarly mediate the interactions of HS and IL&#8208;8 in structure&#8208;dependent manner of the HS. We showed that in all glycans, a positive synergistic effect on IL&#8208;8 binding was observed. For several glycans, the presence of ions resulted in a dramatic increase in the affinity to IL&#8208;8, while for other glycans, a milder effect was observed. This demonstrated that both structural motifs and environmental features are crucial for maintaining the interactions between the HS and IL&#8208;8.

         <title>Accelerating or Slowing: Fine Tuning the De&#8208;Threading Kinetics of a T&#8208;Shaped Benzimidazolium Pumping Cassette</title>

         <dc:description>
A library of T&#8208;shaped benzimidazole&#8208;based dumbbell threads with variable stopper sizes, in combination with crown ether wheels, to elucidate the influence of structural parameters on [2]pseudorotaxane stability and de&#8208;threading kinetics. These findings establish key design principles for tailoring energy landscapes in benzimidazole&#8208;based molecular pumps.








Abstract
Artificial molecular machines (AMMs) rely on precise control of molecular motion, often enabled by mechanically interpenetrated architectures such as pseudorotaxanes. Here, we systematically investigated a library of [2]pseudorotaxanes formed by the combination of T&#8208;shaped benzimidazolium threads featuring variable stopper sizes and crown ether wheels (24C6, B24C6, and 23C6), to elucidate how structural parameters govern [2]pseudorotaxane stability and de&#8208;threading kinetics. Using ring&#8208;closing metathesis and subsequent hydrogenation, we synthesized 10 neutral [2]pseudorotaxanes in high yields (76&#8211;87%). Kinetic studies in DMSO&#8208;d&#8326; at 338&#160;K revealed that de&#8208;threading half&#8208;lives (t&#8321;/&#8322;) span five orders of magnitude, from 0.237&#160;hours (3a&#8315;, &#916;G&#8225; = 24.63&#160;kcal/mol) to 436&#160;hours (5c&#8315;, &#916;G&#8225; = 31.87&#160;kcal/mol). Notably, stopper enlargement and macrocycle rigidification (eg., via B24C6) significantly suppressed de&#8208;threading rates; 4d&#8315;, bearing a benzylic phenyl stopper and B24C6, showed a &#916;G&#8225; of 29.04&#160;kcal/mol and a t&#8321;/&#8322; of 168&#160;hours. Gas&#8208;phase modeling and NMR analyses further elucidated the roles of stopper geometry and host&#8211;guest interactions in modulating energy barriers. These findings provide design principles for the construction of pseudorotaxane&#8208;based modules, paving the way for programmable molecular pumps and advanced AMMs.

         <title>3,4,5&#8208;Trifluorophenyldiazonium&#8211;A Unique Radical Source for the Visible Light Induced, Catalyst&#8208;Free Arylation of Tyrosine Residues in Peptides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By exploiting the unique properties of 3,4,5&#8208;trifluorophenyldiazonium salts in combination with phenols, radical arylations of tyrosine units in peptide substrates could for the first time be achieved under highly attractive conditions requiring only visible light irradiation and neither photocatalysts nor other additives, pre&#8208;functionalization, or protecting groups.








Abstract
The direct radical arylation of tyrosine residues in peptides has been achieved under highly attractive conditions, requiring only the peptide substrate, a 3,4,5&#8208;trifluorophenyldiazonium salt, and irradiation with visible light. Being well&#8208;balanced in its reactivity to form strong charge&#8208;transfer complexes with the phenolic side chain, which are required for initiation and aryl radical formation, the trifluoro substitution still shows sufficient stability toward nucleophilic aromatic substitution in aqueous solution. Besides allowing selective arylation, the introduction of the 3,4,5&#8208;trifluorophenyl unit enables further functionalization as well as potential applications in NMR and MRT studies.

         <title>Quasiracemic Crystallization of Luminescent Chiral Molecules: Mechanochromic Luminescence and Sign Inversion of Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The arrangement of molecules plays a crucial role in governing the luminescent properties of organic crystals. While quasiracemic crystallization, based on the co&#8208;crystallization of two structurally similar but non&#8208;identical enantiomeric molecules, offers a promising strategy for organizing distinct species within a single crystal, its potential for tuning luminescent behavior remains largely unexplored. Herein, we have prepared quasiracemic crystals from a pair of enantiomeric binaphthyl derivatives functionalized with either ethynylnaphthalene or ethynylbenzothiadiazole groups. The molecular arrangement of the quasiracemic crystal is analogous to that of the racemic ethynylnaphthalene derivative, whereas the quasiracemic crystals exhibit mechanochromic luminescence (MCL) behavior similar to that of the racemic ethynylbenzothiadiazole derivative. Notably, the quasiracemic crystals exhibit circularly polarized luminescence (CPL), and the CPL sign is inverted relative to that of the enantiopure crystal of the ethynylbenzothiadiazole derivative. These results highlight quasiracemic crystallization as a new strategy for modulating MCL and CPL properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Small Cations for Engineering 3D Hybrid Perovskites</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Within the last 15 years 3D hybrid perovskites made a breakthrough in the development of new semiconducting materials for diverse applications. This concept article addresses several critical questions central to the development and understanding of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) hybrid perovskites. Specifically, it explores: (1) which organic cations are currently known to stabilize 3D perovskite structures; (2) the potential for discovering and utilizing new cations to support these structures; (3) the influence of the organic cation on physical, chemical, and optoelectronic properties of 3D hybrid perovskites; and (4) whether ongoing research should focus on the synthesis of novel 3D perovskites with alternative small organic cations. By examining these questions, this article aims to provide insights into the structural versatility, property optimization, and future directions for this rapidly evolving field, while also critically evaluating the feasibility and value of expanding the library of organic cations for 3D hybrid perovskite materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Sustainable Approaches for the Protection and Deprotection of Functional Groups</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>While functional group tolerance is a critical consideration in synthetic method development, many functional groups often fail to remain intact under diverse reaction conditions. Therefore, the protection of specific functional groups and subsequent deprotection are convenient choices for the efficient and selective synthesis of target compounds, of which the strategies have been securely established. Meanwhile, the development of sustainable synthetic methods, particularly electrochemistry and photochemistry, has recently played a significant role in the field of organic synthesis, and these approaches have proven useful in the methods of functional group protection and deprotection. This review explores electrochemical and photochemical strategies for the protection and deprotection of functional groups, with a focus on their mechanistic diversity, sustainability, and synthetic utility across various functional group classes.</dc:description>

         <title>Chloride Selective, Non&#8208;protonophoric Ion Transport with Macrocyclic Halogen Bonding Anionophores</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Synthetic ion transporters hold promise as both chemical probes and potential therapeutics for diseases linked to malfunctioning protein ion transporters. However, their application in biological systems is limited, partly due to the cytotoxicity arising from unselective ion transport. Here, we demonstrate that highly active and selective anionophores can be accessed by combining halogen bonding anion recognition with macrocyclic anion encapsulation. Anion transport experiments in large unilamellar vesicles revealed over 300&#8208;fold selectivity for chloride transport over proton/hydroxide ions, which is key for potential future therapeutic applications, where the dissipation of cellular pH gradients must be avoided. The mechanism underpinning selectivity is studied through Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations and MD simulations at the membrane interface, demonstrating that the cyclic structure imposes an energetic preference for chloride binding over hydroxide, as well as a greater desolvation of hydroxide, which further disfavours its transport. We anticipate that these results will accelerate the transition towards the use of artificial chloride transport in biology.</dc:description>

         <title>Reassessing the Possibility of &#960;&#8211;&#963;&#8211;&#960; Full Electron Delocalization through 3D Aromatic Carboranes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Over the past few decades, considerable attention has been devoted to exploring the electronic interactions of various substituents with 3D aromatic carboranes. In the case of substituents possessing available p&#8208;orbitals, conjugation between the &#960;&#8208;system and the &#963;&#8208;framework of the carborane is possible via negative hyperconjugation, where electron density from a filled &#960;&#8208;orbital overlaps with an adjacent &#963;* orbital. However, this is inherently a local effect, which was further bolstered by the fact that aromatic conjugation between planar (2D) &#960;&#8208;systems and the three&#8208;dimensional (3D) aromatic carborane cage does not exist. Nevertheless, recent studies have raised the intriguing possibility that 3D aromatic carboranes may function as &#963;&#8208;conjugated bridges, enabling electronic communication between spatially separated &#960;&#8208;systems. Herein, we investigated the potential conjugation of various substituents with or through carborane systems to better understand the nature of the possible interaction. We demonstrated that significant delocalization through the carborane cluster can be achieved only in the case of radical systems; however, this type of interaction is not a unique feature of carboranes, as similar behavior can also be observed in saturated hydrocarbons.</dc:description>

         <title>Zinc(II) Monomeric, Dimeric and Trimeric Photosensitizers with Microsecond&#8208;lived Intra&#8208;Ligand Charge Transfer Excited States Investigated through Time&#8208;resolved Optical and X&#8208;ray Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>ZnII photosensitizers relative to CuI complexes have received less attention due to their energetically&#8208;higher metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer states. Three ZnII complexes namely a Monomer, a bimetallic helicate and a trimetallic helicate, bearing phenanthroline ligands are hereby studied through time&#8208;resolved X&#8208;ray absorption (tr&#8208;XAS) and femto&#8208;microsecond optical transient absorption spectroscopy (OTA). The formation of intraligand singlet charge transfer (IILCT) excited states is achieved within femtoseconds, followed by intersystem crossing (ISC) in nanoseconds to generate microsecond&#8208;lived triplet (3ILCT) states. Femtosecond OTA shows that the 1ILCT states in the Monomer, Dimer and Trimer occur within 235 fs, 683 fs and 730 fs, respectively, while &#160;nano&#8208;microsecond OTA and tr&#8208;XAS show their 3ILCT states &#160;to decay within 1.00 &#181;s, 1.48 &#181;s and 1.51 &#181;s. The ISC from the 1ILCT to the 3ILCT state for the Trimer is 42.8 ns compared to the Monomer and Dimer with ISC rates less than 13 ns. These differences arise due to the stabilization by &#960;&#8208;&#960; and CH&#8208;&#960; non&#8208;covalent interactions of the phenanthroline ligands. The dihedral and torsional angles indicate stronger ligand strains in the excited states of the Dimer and Trimer vs the Monomer. DFT calculations for the electrochemical oxidation potentials further highlight their capability in inducing&#160;photoredox processes.</dc:description>

         <title>Influence of Sequence Structure of Donor/Acceptor&#8208;Containing Segment on Crystallization&#8208;Driven Self&#8208;Assembly Behavior and Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Crystallization&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly (CDSA) has emerged as a facile strategy to generate donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) &#960;&#8208;conjugated nanofibers with potential applications from photocatalysis to nanomedicine. However, the reports on CDSA of D&#8208;A &#960;&#8208;conjugated&#8208;polymer&#8208;based block copolymers (BCPs) are rather rare. In this context, we report two types of BCPs containing the same corona&#8208;forming poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) segment, but different core&#8208;forming D&#8208;A &#960;&#8208;conjugated blocks, one of which (BT&#8208;OPE5&#8208;BT) contains an OPE5 segment flanked by two electron&#8208;deficient benzothiadiazole (BT) unit and another one of which (B&#8208;alt&#8208;BT) contains four phenylene (B) units and three BT units placed in an alternate way. The BT&#8208;OPE5&#8208;BT&#8208;based seed micelles were not kinetically frozen with obvious micellar dissolution at room temperature, whereas almost no micellar dissolution occurred for B&#8208;alt&#8208;BT&#8208;based seed micelles. However, only polydisperse fiber&#8208;like micelles can be formed by self&#8208;seeding approach owing to presence of multiple packing modes for B&#8208;alt&#8208;BT&#8208;b&#8208;PNIPAM36 over the micellar elongation. The B&#8208;alt&#8208;BT exhibited much more pronounced intra/intermolecular charge transfer effect than BT&#8208;OPE5&#8208;BT, and thus the micelles of B&#8208;alt&#8208;BT&#8208;b&#8208;PNIPAM36 exhibited about 50 nm red&#8208;shift in UV/vis absorption band than that of BT&#8208;OPE5&#8208;BT&#8208;b&#8208;PNIPAM36 and appealing photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activities. This work highlights the importance of sequence structure of D/A units of D&#8208;A segments on both CDSA behavior and photophysical/chemical properties.</dc:description>

         <title>The Ascent of Supramolecular Polymers and Gels in Asymmetric Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Supramolecular polymers and gels, formed by the spontaneous assemblies of small molecules through various types of non&#8208;covalent interactions, are attractive materials for many applications. Their modularity also offers many opportunities in asymmetric catalysis, that have been tackled in the last two decades and more intensively in the last one. In this review, strategies adopted to develop efficient asymmetric catalysts supported on supramolecular polymers and gels are first categorized according to the chiral or achiral nature of the monomers used for their construction and second to their ability to be commuted into different states. Catalytic supramolecular polymers have been described for which enantioselectivity stems mostly from the molecular chirality located next to the reactive group, or at opposite ends of the spectrum, exclusively from the chiral environment provided by the supramolecular helices. New paradigms revealed by these systems include: (i) the organization of catalytic sites at the periphery of modular and well&#8208;structured one&#8208;dimensional assemblies, (ii) the possibility to conduct asymmetric reactions with a sub&#8208;catalytic amount of chiral inducers and even in absence of chiral monomers, and (iii) the development of a new class of switchable asymmetric catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Vinylene&#8208;Linked Fully Conjugated 3D Covalent Organic Polymers for Photocatalytic H2O2 Production</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two novel vinylene&#8208;linked fully conjugated 3D covalent organic polymers (COPs) were synthesized. Both materials showed efficient photocatalytic hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) generation, where the thiophene&#8208;enriched COP outperformed than that of the benzene&#8208;modified counterpart, highlighting the critical role of thiophene units in enhancing catalytic activity.








Abstract
Covalent organic polymers (COPs), featuring conjugated architectures, high porosity, and structural tenability, have emerged as promising candidates for photocatalytic applications. However, the design and synthesis of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) sp2&#8208;carbon&#8208;conjugated COPs, along with their photocatalytic performances, remain underexplored. Here, we synthesized two novel vinylene&#8208;linked fully conjugated 3D COPs (BUCT&#8208;COP&#8208;50 and BUCT&#8208;COP&#8208;51) through the saddle&#8208;shaped building blocks. Under visible&#8208;light irradiation, both materials demonstrated efficient hydrogen peroxide&#160;(H2O2) generation, with BUCT&#8208;COP&#8208;51 (thiophene&#8208;enriched) achieving a remarkable production rate of 3.21&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 in pure water, higher than BUCT&#8208;COP&#8208;50 (benzene&#8208;modified, 2.16&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1). Mechanistic investigations revealed that the H2O2 generation predominantly proceeded via the indirect two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction pathway. The superior performance for BUCT&#8208;COP&#8208;51 could attributed to its narrower bandgap, broader light absorption range, and higher conductivity. This work illustrates that vinylene linked fully conjugated 3D COPs could be as promising semiconductors in environmental and energy&#8208;related fields.

&lt;p&gt;Two novel vinylene-linked fully conjugated 3D covalent organic polymers (COPs) were synthesized. Both materials showed efficient photocatalytic hydrogen peroxide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) generation, where the thiophene-enriched COP outperformed than that of the benzene-modified counterpart, highlighting the critical role of thiophene units in enhancing catalytic activity.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Covalent organic polymers (COPs), featuring conjugated architectures, high porosity, and structural tenability, have emerged as promising candidates for photocatalytic applications. However, the design and synthesis of three-dimensional (3D) sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-carbon-conjugated COPs, along with their photocatalytic performances, remain underexplored. Here, we synthesized two novel vinylene-linked fully conjugated 3D COPs (BUCT-COP-50 and BUCT-COP-51) through the saddle-shaped building blocks. Under visible-light irradiation, both materials demonstrated efficient hydrogen peroxide&#160;(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) generation, with BUCT-COP-51 (thiophene-enriched) achieving a remarkable production rate of 3.21&#160;mmol g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; in pure water, higher than BUCT-COP-50 (benzene-modified, 2.16&#160;mmol g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;).

         <title>Kinetically Arrested SERS&#8208;Active Aggregates for Biosensing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three chemically benign components (AuNP, CB[7] and PEG&#8208;SH) are employed to produce highly&#8208;stable SERS&#8208;active AuNP aggregates able to detect (bio)analytes at low concentrations in high salinity and protein&#8208;containing media. Tunable disassembly is embedded in the AuNP aggregate design, which can be triggered by endogenous thiol&#8208;containing&#160;compounds.








Abstract
There is great demand for biosensors capable of long&#8208;term, non&#8208;invasive monitoring of low analyte concentrations in various biofluids for diagnostics, personalized healthcare, and disease monitoring. However, biofluids present several challenges to biosensor sensing and stability on account of their complex composition and dynamic nature. Surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) offers ultra&#8208;high sensitivity, non&#8208;destructive, real&#8208;time monitoring, and non&#8208;invasive detection, ideal for sensing in complex media. Plasmonic gold nanoparticle (AuNP) SERS&#8208;active assemblies have been widely explored owning to their biocompatibility and tunable sensitivity based on AuNP morphology. Here, we employ thiolated poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG&#8208;SH) to produce kinetically trapped metastable AuNP:cucurbit[7]uril (CB[7]) aggregates containing robust nanogaps (ca. 1&#160;nm), which have previously displayed strong, reproducible SERS signals at low concentrations. The AuNP:CB[7]:PEG aggregates maintain strong SERS&#8208;activity, demonstrating low concentration detection of a model Raman reporter and a bioanalyte in a range of biofluids. Moreover, the aggregates are highly tunable through facile modification of the PEG&#8208;SH chain length and grafting density and possess an encoded disassembly mechanism within their design highlighting the potential application of these aggregates for non&#8208;invasive in vivo long&#8208;term monitoring alongside future customized SERS biosensing&#160;applications.

         <title>A Diverse Array of Catalytic Photoredox Reactions Based on Aluminum(III)&#8208;Salen Complexes: Understanding the Enhancement of Catalytic Activity via Amine Association</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Since aluminum is an earth&#8208;abundant and environmentally benign main&#8208;group metal, the development of aluminum&#8208;complex&#8208;based photoredox catalysts remains a significant issue. Herein, we report aluminum(III)&#8208;salen complexes (Al&#8208;salens) as versatile photoredox catalysts. The combination of an Al&#8208;salen catalyst with an amine under visible&#8208;light irradiation allowed the hydrodechlorinative transformations of aryl chlorides, the reductive coupling of carbonyl compounds, and the defluoroallylation of perfluoroalkylarenes. Mechanistic studies using transient absorption spectroscopy suggested that the Al&#8208;salen complex associates with the amine via its vacant site to improve the reducing ability of its excited&#8208;state. After electron transfer between the excited state of the Al&#8208;salen/amine complex and an appropriate oxidant, the generated aminium radical cation is leveraged to achieve the oxidative transformations of amines, such as &#945;&#8208;arylation and &#945;&#8208;cyanation. The diversity of the catalytic photoredox reactions based on Al&#8208;salen complexes is comparable to that of heavy&#8208;precious&#8208;metal&#8208;based catalysts.</dc:description>

         <title>Synergistic Enhancement Mechanisms of Lithium&#8208;Ion Storage in Black Phosphorus@Ti3C2Tx(BP@Ti3C2Tx) Composite Thin&#8208;Film Electrodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A binder&#8208;free&#160;BP@Ti3C2Tx&#160;composite thin&#8208;film electrode was fabricated via a one&#8208;step vacuum filtration method, enabling precise control over morphology and scalability. The Ti3C2Tx&#160;MXene framework constructs a 3D conductive network that enhances charge transfer kinetics and mechanically confines black phosphorus (BP) particles through robust Ti&#8208;O&#8208;P bonding, effectively suppressing BP&#8217;s volume expansion during cycling. Structural characterization (XRD, SEM, EDS, etc.) confirms the homogeneous "Mosaic" architecture, with BP particles uniformly embedded in&#160;the MXene matrix. XPS analysis further reveals enhanced&#160;Ti&#8208;C bonding and significant&#160;Ti&#8208;O&#8208;P interfacial interactions. Electrochemical evaluation demonstrates&#160;exceptional performance: the composite electrode achieves a discharge capacity of 685.92 mAh/g at 0.1 A/g after 100 cycles, near&#8208;100% Coulombic efficiency, and remarkable capacity recovery (783.21 mAh/g) after high&#8208;rate cycling (1.5 A/g). Kinetic analysis via cyclic voltammetry further indicates a reduced polarization (&#916;V = 0.06 V) and enhanced capacitive contribution (b&#8208;value = 0.663&#8208;0.799), attributed to MXene&#8217;s dual role in facilitating ion diffusion and electron transport.

         <title>Size&#8208;Dependent Ultrafast UV Photochemistry of Aliphatic Disulfides in Solution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 34, June 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aliphatic disulfides exclusively split homolytically along the S&#8722;S bond when directly exciting the disulfide chromophore at about 250&#8197;nm. Ultrafast (&lt;1&#8197;ps) geminate recombination at high yield is observed in solution for fragment sizes as small as L&#8208;cysteine. The smallest disulfide recombines ten&#8208;fold more slowly. Ultrafast disulfide reformation will also exist in proteins, providing inherent protection from radiation damage.







Abstract
We have investigated the photochemistry of dimethyl disulfide (DMDS) and glutathione disulfide (GSSG) in solution upon ultraviolet (UV) excitation in comparison to L&#8208;cystine by femtosecond X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy at the sulfur K&#8208;edge. For these aliphatic disulfides, the very similar differential absorption spectra reveal unequivocally a pair of geminate thiyl radicals as the single primary reaction product with a formation time constant of about 100&#8197;fs. We find size&#8208;dependent majority yields for disulfide recombination with DMDS reforming ten&#8208;fold slower and at lower quantum yield than L&#8208;cystine while GSSG recombines even faster than L&#8208;cystine at a yield of nearly 80&#8201;% within 2&#8197;ps after excitation. We attribute the much lower recombination rates and yields of DMDS to larger product separation after homolytic S&#8722;S bond cleavage due to the smaller thiyl radical mass and correspondingly larger mutual acceleration. Furthermore, we observe the delayed formation of at least one additional reaction product for these disulfides that we attribute to perthiyl radicals. The ultrafast recombination of L&#8208;cystine and GSSG at majority yield in condensed phase suggests a dynamic S&#8722;S bond integrity which may be exploited in natural systems to mitigate UV radiation damage, and which could be of interest in materials design.

This review provides an overview of PNA cellular delivery methods, starting with traditional peptide&#8208;based systems and progressing to advanced approaches using nanoparticles, liposomes, and calixarene. It highlights how these innovative strategies have opened the way for more effective and efficient PNA delivery, ultimately enhancing the potential for broader therapeutic applications of PNAs.








Abstract
Peptide nucleic acids (PNAs) have garnered significant attention due to their enhanced chemical, physical, and binding properties in comparison to natural nucleic acids. This prompted their application in antigene/antisense approach, assigning them a pivotal role in gene editing and, more recently, showing their potential as &#8220;bilingual&#8221; molecules being able &#8220;to speak&#8221; both nucleic acid and protein language. However, to expand the applications of PNAs in therapy, the challenge of effectively delivering PNAs to cells needs to be addressed. Among several delivery approaches employed so far, the nanotechnology&#8208;based ones showed great potential. In this review, we provide an overview of the latest in the field (2019 to present), beginning from peptide&#8208;based delivery systems, as well as cutting&#8208;edge approaches involving nanoparticles, liposomes, and calixarene, showing how they have inspired the development of smarter delivery approaches to boost PNAs applications.

         <title>Advances in Mechanochemical Methods for One&#8208;Pot Multistep Organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 34, June 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights recent advances in mechanochemical methods for multistep organic synthesis, focusing on sequential one&#8208;pot approaches performed by grinding or ball milling. The presented transformations are discussed in terms of efficiency, applicability, and sustainability, assessing both the challenges and potential of solvent&#8208;free one&#8208;pot approaches to contribute to greener strategies in organic synthesis.








Abstract
Mechanochemical synthesis has emerged as a powerful and more sustainable alternative to conventional solution&#8208;based methods, offering advantages such as no or only minimal solvent use, reduced reaction times, and simplified operational conditions. The integration of multiple steps into a single reaction vessel further enhances these benefits by eliminating workup and purification steps, reducing waste, and often improving overall efficiency. This review highlights recent advancements in mechanochemical one&#8208;pot multistep reactions in organic synthesis, focusing on protocols with sequential one&#8208;pot operation. Diverse transformations are covered, including heterocycle formation, functional group interconversions, and the synthesis of active pharmaceutical ingredients, while discussing both the operational and environmental advantages of these methodologies, along with their remaining challenges. Overall, mechanochemical one&#8208;pot synthesis has the potential to streamline transformations and therefore contribute to more sustainable approaches in modern organic synthetic chemistry.

         <title>Recent Advances in the Application of Covalent Organic Framework&#8211;Based Ionic Conductors in Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 34, June 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>This article reviews recent advances in COF&#8208;based ionic conductors for PEMFCs, covering their roles as intrinsic proton conductors, host matrices for proton carriers, and additives in composite ionomers/membranes. Key strategies for enhancing proton conductivity and mechanical stability are analyzed, along with challenges in membrane durability and performance under low humidity or high&#8208;temperature conditions.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), known for their tunable porosity and functional versatility, have demonstrated exceptional ionic conductivity in proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). This review summarizes recent advancements in COF&#8208;based materials for PEMFC applications, emphasizing their roles as intrinsic proton conductors, host matrices for proton carriers, and additives in composite ionomers/membranes. Key strategies such as pore engineering, functional group modification, and hybrid designs with polymers are analyzed to highlight their influence on proton conductivity and mechanical stability. Recent developments reveal that functionalized COFs can achieve proton conductivities exceeding 0.89 S cm&#8722;1 at 90&#160;&#176;C under 100% relative humidity (RH), comparable to commercial Nafion membranes. Additionally, COF&#8208;modified ionomers applied to catalyst layers have enabled fuel cells to achieve peak power densities 1.6 times higher than those without COF incorporation. Despite these advancements, challenges persist in terms of membrane durability, scalability, and performance under low humidity or high&#8208;temperature conditions. Future research should prioritize structural optimization, interfacial compatibility, and cost&#8208;effective synthesis methods to fully realize the potential of COFs in next&#8208;generation PEMFCs.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), known for their tunable porosity and functional versatility, have demonstrated exceptional ionic conductivity in proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). This review summarizes recent advancements in COF-based materials for PEMFC applications, emphasizing their roles as intrinsic proton conductors, host matrices for proton carriers, and additives in composite ionomers/membranes. Key strategies such as pore engineering, functional group modification, and hybrid designs with polymers are analyzed to highlight their influence on proton conductivity and mechanical stability. Recent developments reveal that functionalized COFs can achieve proton conductivities exceeding 0.89 S cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 90&#160;&#176;C under 100% relative humidity (RH), comparable to commercial Nafion membranes. Additionally, COF-modified ionomers applied to catalyst layers have enabled fuel cells to achieve peak power densities 1.6 times higher than those without COF incorporation. Despite these advancements, challenges persist in terms of membrane durability, scalability, and performance under low humidity or high-temperature conditions. Future research should prioritize structural optimization, interfacial compatibility, and cost-effective synthesis methods to fully realize the potential of COFs in next-generation PEMFCs. This review underscores the transformative potential of COFs in addressing the critical limitations of traditional proton-conducting materials, paving the way for innovative solutions in fuel cell technology.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Data Analysis Methods in Time&#8208;Resolved Fluorescence Spectroscopy: A Tutorial Review</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 34, June 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A modern approach to analyse complex fluorescence decays should include more than fitting to a multi&#8208;exponential decay. This review provides an accessible and comprehensive overview of the techniques available to analyse luminescence decays. Each method is explained thoroughly, highlighting its strengths and limitations. A practical example is provided on which a workflow combining several methods is applied.







Abstract
Fluorescence spectroscopy and related techniques benefit from exceptional sensitivity and have become engrained in a variety of fields from biosciences to materials sciences. Measuring time&#8208;domain fluorescence decays is nowadays a routine task in many laboratories across these different fields. Perhaps surprisingly, a correct data analysis of these fluorescence decay curves presents a formidable challenge and requires extensive insight in the problems associated with fitting this type of data. As a result, the reported analysis of these decays is usually limited to a non&#8208;linear least squares fit of a sum of a few exponential terms to the data. This review aims to expose the intricate field of data analysis in time&#8208;resolved fluorescence spectroscopy to a broader audience, from researchers interested in understanding the photophysics of their system to readers and reviewers trying to understand the merits of specific methods. Challenges associated with this type of kinetic experimental data are outlined and the clever analysis strategies devised by researchers across different disciplines are introduced and discussed in detail. A section on freely available scripts and software facilitating the analysis is included towards the end. We encourage the reader to try their hand at the worked examples.

Abstract
The first total synthesis of the 2,3,5&#8208;O&#8208;(S,R)&#8208;NonaHydroxyTriPhenoylated (NHTP) and 4,6&#8208;O&#8208;(S)&#8208;HexaHydroxy&#8208;DiPhenoylated (HHDP) C&#8208;glucosidic ellagitannin (&#8722;)&#8208;vescalagin was accomplished through a bioinspired route involving intramolecular atroposelective cupric&#8208;diamine complex&#8208;mediated phenolic couplings of gallates to forge its HHDP and NHTP units and a methoxyamine&#8208;driven opening of a glucopyranose intermediate followed by a phenolic aldol&#8208;type reaction to form its C&#8208;arylglucosidic bond. The minor epimer that resulted from this bond&#8208;forming event was used to complete also a first total synthesis of the vescalagin epimer, (&#8722;)&#8208;castalagin.

         <title>Unveiling New Triazoloquinoxaline&#8208;Based PROTACs Designed for the Selective Degradation of the ncBAF Chromatin Remodeling Subunit BRD9</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 34, June 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present new BRD9&#8208;targeting degraders featuring a chemical warhead and E3 ligase ligand that distinctly differ from the typical chemical units used for BRD9 degradation. Specifically, we identified two VHL&#8208;based PROTACs (2 and 9) based on a [1,2,4]triazolo[4,3&#8208;a]quinoxaline scaffold that effectively and selectively degrade BRD9 and exhibit antiproliferative effects in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells, offering potential strategies for AML treatment and insights into BRD9's role in tumors.








Abstract
PROteolysis Targeting Chimera (PROTAC) technology is an innovative and potent approach for achieving targeted protein degradation (TPD). Within bromodomain&#8208;containing proteins, various degraders targeting BET family&#8208;related targets, for example, BRD4, were developed in the last years. On the other hand, a limited number of PROTACs acting against non&#8208;BET proteins were reported so far. Among them, BRD9 was recently linked to oncogenic roles in the tumorigenesis processes, especially in sarcomas and leukemias. Herein, we describe the design and synthesis of a focused collection of new BRD9&#8208;targeting degraders based on the [1,2,4]triazolo[4,3&#8208;a]quinoxaline heterocyclic scaffold employing two distinct E3 ubiquitin ligase ligands. Through in silico evaluation, synthesis, binding affinity determination, and in vitro analysis, we identified two new VHL&#8208;based PROTACs (2 and 9), which showed remarkable degradation of the protein of interest and antiproliferative activity in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells. Notably, compound 9 exhibited selective degradation of BRD9 over BRD7. These results enlarge and differentiate the pool of heterobifunctional molecules able to degrade BRD9 through the proteasome machinery, providing a promising reference for the discovery of new tools to further explore both the involvement of this epigenetic regulatory factor in tumor processes and to evaluate novel strategies for AML treatment.

         <title>Integrated Ammonia Capture and Exchange on Ion&#8208;Exchanged 4A Zeolites</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 34, June 17, 2025. </description>

Ammonia produced in fusion reactors can lead to issues with tritium accountability and corrosion, which increases challenges associated with utilizing it as a source for energy. However, utilizing platinum&#8208;impregnated zeolites can allow for ammonia to be captured in situ and processed for isotope recovery.








Abstract
Ammonia poses a challenge in effluent gas streams due to its corrosive nature. However, in fusion settings tritiated ammonia can be formed, leading to both tritium loss in inventory and the generation of reactive species. Therefore, identifying pathways in which both tritium can be recovered, and the ammonia can be easily handled would be beneficial. One such way to do so would be to combine two useful techniques: ammonia sequestration and hydrogen exchange (ND3&#8594;NH3). However, materials that can both adsorb ammonia and subsequently perform reactions on ammonia have not been well explored. In this work, we present the development of ion&#8208;exchanged A&#8208;type zeolites to be utilized as a support material for platinum catalysts. In this way, the zeolite can adsorb ammonia and the platinum catalyst can facilitate hydrogen exchange allowing for bifunctional reactivity of the material to be achieved. A variety of elements were explored for their effect on A&#8208;type zeolites and resulted in an isotopic difference in the adsorption of ND3 and NH3, noting the use of deuterium as a surrogate for tritium. Several platinum&#8208;impregnated zeolites were able to remove ND3 from the gas stream, indicating that utilizing these materials in isotope recovery processes would improve accountability of these valuable hydrogen isotopes.

However, utilizing platinum-impregnated zeolites can allow for ammonia to be captured in situ and processed for isotope recovery.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ammonia poses a challenge in effluent gas streams due to its corrosive nature. However, in fusion settings tritiated ammonia can be formed, leading to both tritium loss in inventory and the generation of reactive species. Therefore, identifying pathways in which both tritium can be recovered, and the ammonia can be easily handled would be beneficial. One such way to do so would be to combine two useful techniques: ammonia sequestration and hydrogen exchange (ND&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#8594;NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). However, materials that can both adsorb ammonia and subsequently perform reactions on ammonia have not been well explored. In this work, we present the development of ion-exchanged A-type zeolites to be utilized as a support material for platinum catalysts. In this way, the zeolite can adsorb ammonia and the platinum catalyst can facilitate hydrogen exchange allowing for bifunctional reactivity of the material to be achieved. A variety of elements were explored for their effect on A-type zeolites and resulted in an isotopic difference in the adsorption of ND&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, noting the use of deuterium as a surrogate for tritium. Several platinum-impregnated zeolites were able to remove ND&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; from the gas stream, indicating that utilizing these materials in isotope recovery processes would improve accountability of these valuable hydrogen isotopes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Endoplasmic Reticulum&#8208;Targeted Photodynamic Therapy Combined with Autophagy Inhibition to Enhance Synergistic Immunotherapy for Triple&#8208;Negative Breast Cancer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 34, June 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Da&#8208;CD@CET@CQ NPs can accurately target tumor cells, and the ER&#8208;targeting photosensitizer CET can be used as an ICD inducer for amplifying the ICD effect. Meanwhile, the ER PDT was further strengthened by autophagy inhibition, which can achieve more effective autophagy&#8208;regulated photodynamic synergistic immunotherapy for triple&#8208;negative breast cancer.








Abstract
Activating immunogenic cell death (ICD) represents a promising therapeutic strategy for tumor immunotherapy. However, photodynamic therapy (PDT)&#8208;mediated ICD effect is severely limited due to the extremely short half&#8208;life and limited diffusion radius of reactive oxygen species (ROS), hindering effective endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress induction. In addition, targeted therapy of triple&#8208;negative breast cancer (TNBC) remains hugely challenging due to the lack of expression of multiple receptors. Herein, we constructed a hierarchical targeting and controllable intelligent nanodelivery material Da&#8208;CD@CET@CQ based on poly&#8208;&#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin with remarkable solubility and stability, loaded with a novel photosensitized ICD inducer, CET, and autophagy inhibitor chloroquine (CQ). Excitingly, Da&#8208;CD@CET@CQ NPs can accurately recognize TNBC tumor cells under the mediation of SRC protein. Moreover, CET could achieve observable enrichment in the ER and amplify the ICD effect by in situ ER PDT, which is further strengthened by the autophagy inhibition caused by CQ. All results show that Da&#8208;CD@CET@CQ NPs exhibited excellent targeting ability to tumor cells and ER and effectively enhanced synergistic immunotherapy of in situ ER PDT combined with autophagy inhibition, which significantly inhibited tumor growth and metastasis. Overall, our study provides a novel strategy and meaningful guideline for targeted&#8208;PDT&#8208;synergistic immunotherapy of TNBC.

         <title>The Vicinal&#8208;Diiodination of the HDDA&#8208;Benzynes by N&#8208;Iodo&#8208; succinimide (NIS) Through a Radical Pathway</title>

The discovery and development of radical iodine trapping reaction of the HDDA&#8208;benzynes for the construction of vicinal&#8208;diiodo arenes is reported. The N&#8208;iodosuccinimide serves as the source of iodine radicals and EPR spectral analysis of reaction mixture supports the existence of radical intermediates. Control experiments suggest that the 4&#8208;iodination (mono&#8208;) of the HDDA&#8208;benzynes is faster than the 5&#8208;iodiniation This work represents the first report on the vicinal&#8208;diiodination as well as radical diiodination of HDDA&#8208;benzynes.








Abstract
The 1,2&#8208;diradical reactivity of the HDDA&#8208;benzynes (thermal) has not been explored well in comparison to their ionic reactivity. Accordingly, the radical trapping reactions of these reactive intermediates are very scarce in literature. Herein, we report the iodine&#8208;radical trapping reaction of the HDDA&#8208;benzynes for the construction of structurally divergent vicinal&#8208;diiodo arenes. The N&#8208;iodosuccinimide (NIS) has been employed as the source of radical iodine under thermal heating conditions. The existence of the arene&#8208;radical intermediates and the radical mechanism has been supported by the EPR spectral analysis of the reaction mixture. Several fruitful control experiments suggested that the 4&#8208;iodination (mono&#8208;) of the HDDA&#8208;benzynes is faster than the 5&#8208;iodiniation. The process is general in terms of substituents on the diynes as well as the nature of the tethering units. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the vicinal&#8208;diiodination as well as radical diiodination of HDDA&#8208;benzynes.

         <title>Stereodynamism in Chiral Polyaromatic Phosphepines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 34, June 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stereodynamism of phosphahelicenoid scaffolds can be used to afford diastereoisomers of polyaromatics fused with a chiral seven&#8208;membered P&#8208;ring. In particular, a complex interplay between the inversion at the P centre and helicenoid epimerization, as well as a competition with a rearomatization reaction, takes place.








Abstract
In the present experimental&#8208;computational study, we demonstrate that the stereodynamism of phosphahelicenoids&#160;can be used to afford diastereoisomers of chirally perturbed polyaromatics fused with a phosphepine ring (seven&#8208;membered P&#8208;cycle). The phosphahelicenoids have been synthesized through a stereospecific approach from commercially available BINAPs. In particular, using the combination of NMR, X&#8208;ray diffraction, and chiral HPLC experimental techniques with DFT and higher level ab initio calculations, we highlight a complex interplay between the inversion at the phosphorus stereocenter and the epimerization of the helicenoid framework, as well as a competition with a rearomatization reaction through P&#8208;extrusion. The impact of the conformational modifications on the structure have been studied through X&#8208;ray diffraction. The spectroscopic properties, in particular, of chiroptical nature, including circularly polarized luminescence, are also discussed in detail and compared to DFT and ADC(2) models.

This study explores microwave&#8208;assisted synthesis as an efficient method for preparing PNIPAM based nanogels. Using crosslinkers like EGDMA and BAC, their effects on structure, temperature responsiveness, and stability were analyzed. Microwave irradiation shows its potential in nanogel synthesis. Stability studies in biologically relevant media highlight their potential for biomedical applications.








Abstract
This study provides a detailed account of the use of microwave&#8208;assisted synthesis as a novel and efficient method for preparing monodisperse poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) nanogels. The synthesis, based on free radical precipitation copolymerization of NIPAM and crosslinkers in water, was accelerated by microwave irradiation. Crosslinkers such as ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA) and degradable bis&#8208;acryloylcystamine (BAC) were employed to study their effects on nanogel structure and properties, including their temperature&#8208;responsive behavior. HPLC analysis revealed differences in monomer and crosslinker conversion between the two agents. The growth of the nanogel particles was analyzed at various polymerization times using dynamic light scattering (DLS), &#950;&#8208;potential measurements, and cryo&#8208;TEM imaging. The data showed that microwave&#8208;assisted synthesis reduced reaction time from 6 hours to minutes. BAC produced uniformly cross&#8208;linked nanogels, whereas EGDMA formed nanogels with dense cores and loose PNIPAM shells. Stability studies during storage and in biologically relevant media indicated their potential for biomedical applications.

         <title>Constant pH Molecular Dynamics Simulation of pH Effects on Amyloid&#8208;&#946; Structure, Dynamics, and Metal&#8208;Binding</title>

         <dc:description>
Constant pH molecular dynamics simulations are used to examine the effect of pH on amyloid&#8208;&#946; and its complexes with Cu(II) and Zn(II). Changes in size and secondary structure are found, with suggestions for the origin of pH&#8208;dependent aggregation.








Abstract
We report the first molecular dynamics simulations to examine the effect of pH on the structure, dynamics, and metal&#8208;binding ability of amyloid&#8208;&#946;, the peptide implicated in the onset of Alzheimer's disease. We show that in the pH range of 6 to 8 only histidine residues show variable protonation, that predicted pKa values are in agreement with experimental data, and that changes in pH affect the size, flexibility, and secondary structure of the peptide. The binding of Cu(II) or Zn(II) to the peptide induces a shift of 1 to 1.5 pKa units in unbound histidine residues, while metal binding modes associated with higher pH induce significant changes in peptide structure. We speculate on the significance of these findings on results showing pH dependence as well as on Cu(II) and Zn(II) modulation of aggregation of Amyloid&#8208;&#946;.

         <title>Enhanced Solid&#8208;State Triplet&#8211;Triplet Annihilation Upconversion Steered by AIE&#8208;Active Isomers</title>

The morphology of a molecular crystal plays a critical role in the upconversion performance of a solid&#8208;state triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation upconversion (TTA&#8208;UC) system. Various crystals with different morphological features of a red&#8208;to&#8208;blue sensitizer/annihilator pair were made via different crystallization methods. It turned out that the UC crystal composed of regular nanograins with intact crystalline lattices demonstrated the most enhanced UC performance due to the improved triplet energy migration.








Abstract
A red&#8208;to&#8208;blue solid&#8208;state triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation upconversion (TTA&#8208;UC) molecular crystal with a significantly improved upconverted photoluminescence intensity was first achieved via a controlled crystallization pathway. Cyano&#8208;substituted stilbene derivatives and transition metal complexes were coupled for TTA&#8208;UC systems. The photophysical properties of the two annihilators and their TTA&#8208;UC systems in solution and aggregate were comprehensively studied. Particularly, UC crystals were simply prepared under different crystallization conditions resulting in different morphological and structural features. It turned out that the UC crystal prepared in the surfactant&#8208;assisted crystallization method demonstrated a 100&#8208;fold higher UC intensity than that in the evaporation crystallization method. The morphological and structural study indicated small nanograins with intact crystalline lattice would facilitate the triplet energy migration leading to a boosted UC efficiency. This work provides a novel perspective for the facile construction of high&#8208;efficient solid&#8208;state TTA&#8208;UC systems by utilizing crystals with appropriate morphology, which significantly promotes the practical applications of TTA&#8208;UC.

         <title>Synthesis of Isocoumarins via Light&#8208;Driven Carboxylative Cyclization Reaction of o&#8208;Ethynyl Aryl Bromides with CO2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 34, June 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The light&#8208;driven carboxylative cyclization reaction of o&#8208;ethynyl aryl bromides with CO2 selectivity produced isocoumarins. Control experiments revealed that photoirradiation promoted the cyclization process with high selectivity for the isocoumarins over the corresponding phthalides.








Abstract
Isocoumarins are an important class of bicyclic lactones, which are seen in natural products, drugs, and bioactive compounds, and a variety of synthetic methods for isocoumarins have been developed. However, the synthesis of isocoumarins via the catalytic CO2 fixation has been scarcely reported despite the potential incorporation of CO2 into the lactone moiety. Here, we developed the light&#8208;driven carboxylative cyclization reaction of o&#8208;ethynyl aryl bromides with CO2, which selectively produced isocoumarins. Control experiments revealed that photoirradiation promoted the cyclization process with high selectivity.

Abstract
Andrographolide (ADG) was conjugated with MIL&#8208;53(Al), ZIF&#8208;8, carbon&#8208;based quantum dots (CBQDs) and doped carbon&#8208;based quantum dots (D&#8208;CBQDs) using high&#8208;pressure (0.3&#160;GPa) contact. This solvent&#8208;free approach is environmentally friendly, energy&#8208;efficient, and time&#8208;saving, resulting in ADG&#8208;MOFs&#8208;CBQDs/D&#8208;CBQDs with physical properties comparable to those produced by traditional liquid phase encapsulation. The resulting nanocomposites were characterized using SEM, XRD, TGA, FT&#8208;IR, and 1H NMR. The results indicate that ADG was partly encapsulated within the metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) pores, while another portion was bound externally to CBQD/D&#8208;CBQDs, as evidenced by distinct drug signals in each analysis. This green synthesis approach simplifies the conjugation process. It significantly enhances the drug solubility, as indicated by changes in hydrophobicity observed via 1H NMR, surpassing the improvements achieved by ADG encapsulation within MOFs alone. Additionally, in preliminary tests, the materials exhibited significant cytotoxicity against PC3 cells compared to ADG (25.05&#160;&#177;&#160;0.06&#160;&#181;g/mL) after 48&#160;hours of exposure.

         <title>Comprehensive Analysis of Crystalline Hydrophobic Alkylated Poly(ethyleneimine)s</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 34, June 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alkylation of polyethyleneimine (PEI) induces crystalline hydrophobic domains, critical for CO&#8322;&#8208;mediated desalination. Structural evolution during acid/base treatment and ion exchange is revealed by PXRD, SAXS, and inelastic neutron scattering. Findings highlight reversible domain disruption and nanostructure formation, enabling recyclable polymer performance in water purification and CO&#8322; capture.








Abstract
Polyethyleneimine (PEI) is a widely used polymer in catalysis, gas separation, water treatment, drug delivery, textiles, and paper production. Carbon dioxide can act as a molecular stimulus for amine&#8208;rich polymers such as PEIs, a property that has been exploited in CO&#8322;&#8208;mediated desalination. This process entails amine&#8208;mediated CO&#8322; capture and the in situ formation of bicarbonate ions, which subsequently undergo ion exchange with chloride ions present in both model and real seawater. In this study, we prepared a series of alkylated PEIs with different chainlengths (C4&#8208;C18) and degrees of alkylation (10&#8208;40% alkylation) via simple alkylation as previously reported. The obtained hydrophobic PEI, specifically PEI&#8208;C16, was further investigated in terms of its crystalline structure using powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering, thermogravimetric analysis, and inelastic neutron scattering. Based on our analysis, we conclude that the subtle structural changes of hydrophobic poly(ethyleneimine)s were induced by acid&#8208;mediated protonation and ion exchange, while the polymer maintained its integrity across multiple desalination cycles. These findings advocate for the employment of hydrophobic poly(ethyleneimine) in CO&#8322;&#8208;responsive processes and carbon capture applications.

This process entails amine-mediated CO&#8322; capture and the in situ formation of bicarbonate ions, which subsequently undergo ion exchange with chloride ions present in both model and real seawater. In this study, we prepared a series of alkylated PEIs with different chainlengths (C4-C18) and degrees of alkylation (10-40% alkylation) via simple alkylation as previously reported. The obtained hydrophobic PEI, specifically PEI-C16, was further investigated in terms of its crystalline structure using powder X-ray diffraction, small-angle X-ray scattering, thermogravimetric analysis, and inelastic neutron scattering. Based on our analysis, we conclude that the subtle structural changes of hydrophobic poly(ethyleneimine)s were induced by acid-mediated protonation and ion exchange, while the polymer maintained its integrity across multiple desalination cycles. These findings advocate for the employment of hydrophobic poly(ethyleneimine) in CO&#8322;-responsive processes and carbon capture applications.

         <title>Ab Initio Study on Doped Cu138X2 Nanoparticles With Dispersed Surface&#8208;Active Sites for Enhanced Electrocatalytic Nitrate Reduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 34, June 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We investigated the nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia reduction on heteroatom&#8208;doped Cu138X2 (X&#160;=&#160;Ag, Au, Pd, Zn, Ni, Pt) catalysts. DFT calculations demonstrated that Cu138Au2 exhibits superior performance, with *NO2&#8594;*HNO2 identified as the critical reaction pathway and an effective descriptor for screening copper&#8208;based catalysts. This study lays a solid foundation for optimizing catalyst performance through surface and compositional modifications.








Abstract
Copper nanoparticles (NPs) exhibit significant potential in electrocatalysis owing to their tunable electronic structure and abundant surface&#8208;active sites. However, the multifaceted complexity of Cu&#8208;based nanoparticles induced by heteroatom dopants fundamentally limits our ability to decipher the electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) mechanism, creating a critical knowledge gap that obstructs the targeted engineering of advanced catalysts with atomic precision. In this study, we employed first&#8208;principles calculations to design a series of highly surface&#8208;dispersed transition metal&#8208;doped Cu138X2 (X&#160;=&#160;Ag, Au, Pd, Zn, Ni, Pt) bimetallic electrocatalysts for nitrate reduction to ammonia (NH3), based on the structure of Cu140 NPs. Theoretical analysis revealed that Cu138Au2 exhibits significant advantages in NO3RR, with a remarkably low limiting potential of &#8722;0.20 eV. In addition, significant energy barriers were observed for the formation of by&#8208;products NO and NO2 on Cu138Au2, ensuring high selectivity towards ammonia. For Cu&#8208;based catalysts, we propose that the *NO2 &#8594; *HNO2 step is critical and can serve as a descriptor for rapid screening of these catalysts. This study not only provides important insights into the research of Cu NPs as NO3RR electrocatalysts but also establishes a theoretical foundation for enhancing their catalytic performance through surface modification or compositional tuning.

         <title>B/N&#8208;Codoped Porous Carbons as Metal&#8208;Free and Binder&#8208;Free Electrode Material for Supercapacitors</title>

Binder&#8208;free B/N&#8208;codoped porous carbon, derived from a PFD polymer, generates high&#8208;performance solid&#8208;state supercapacitors, demonstrating remarkable energy storage capabilities and lights up a 3&#160;V bulb.








Abstract
A facile, cost&#8208;effective, and eco&#8208;friendly approach for the synthesis of B/N&#8208;codoped porous carbon materials has been developed for metal&#8208;free and binder&#8208;free supercapacitors. A set of samples, CPFD&#8208;B/N&#8208;5, CPFD&#8208;B/N&#8208;10, and CPFD&#8208;B/N&#8208;15 have been synthesized by carbonization of a phloroglucinol&#8208;formaldehyde&#8208;dopamine (PFD) polymer and tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS). Boric acid has been used to introduce different amounts of boron and an undoped sample, CPFD&#8208;N, has been synthesized for comparison. The CPFD materials function as binder&#8208;free electrodes and display excellent electrochemical behavior. The optimization of boron as a heteroatom with a rational distribution of pores enables CPFD&#8208;B/N&#8208;10 electrode to achieve a high capacitance of 962 F/g at a current density of 1 A/g in 1&#160;M H2SO4 electrolyte. It demonstrates excellent rate capability and exceptional cycling stability, retaining over 120% of its capacitance after 5000 cycles at a current density of 30 A/g. It has a specific energy density of 108.22&#160;Wh/kg and a power output of 450.00&#160;W/kg at 1 A/g, effectively bridging the gap between supercapacitors and batteries. A solid&#8208;state symmetric supercapacitor made from the material achieves a capacitance of 622 F/g at a current density of 1 A/g, Coulombic efficiency of 89% after 1,500 cycles and powers a 3&#160;V LED bulb.

         <dc:description>
This study presents a catalyst&#8208;free, on&#8208;resin method for synthesizing peptide&#8208;triazolobenzodiazepine hybrids. The SPPS&#8208;compatible protocol enables N&#8208;terminal and Lys/Orn side chain modifications, forming a triazolobenzodiazepine core via one&#8208;pot reactions. The methodology offers a versatile tool for advancing &#8220;peptide medicinal chemistry&#8221; enabling the design of multifunctional peptides with potential therapeutic applications.








Abstract
The merger of peptide and heterocyclic chemistry presents significant opportunities for enhancing the structural and functional diversity of therapeutic agents. In this study, we introduce a streamlined on&#8208;resin method to modify peptides at the N&#8208;terminus amines and the side chain amines of Lys/Orn amino acids by incorporating the biologically active triazolobenzodiazepine scaffold. In the presented solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis (SPPS), the triazolobenzodiazepine core is formed on&#8208;resin through a combination of N&#8208;alkylation, amide bond formation, and an alkyne&#8208;azide 1,3&#8208;dipolar cycloaddition, of which the latter two happen as a single&#8208;step one&#8208;pot reaction&#8208; proceeding under mild conditions without metal catalysts. This protocol tolerates a wide variety of amino acids and functional groups, providing a versatile method for synthesizing peptide&#8208;triazolobenzodiazepine hybrids. Using orthogonal protection group strategies, we further demonstrate the method's adaptability for two site modifications in peptides involving both the N&#8208;terminus and Lys side chain amines. These modifications enhance the scope of &#8220;peptide medicinal chemistry&#8221; by creating multifunctional peptides with potential therapeutic applications. The method's compatibility with SPPS, room temperature conditions, and elimination of metal catalysis make it an efficient and powerful tool for peptide modification.

Mkrtchyan and Iaroshenko et al. report a convenient approach for the mechanochemical synthesis of N&#8208;aryl amides and &#945;&#8208;aryl carboxylic acids/esters/ketones via Ru&#8208;catalyzed expected and unexpected dehydrative cross&#8208;coupling of unprotected phenols with primary amides or alkyl carboxylic acids/esters/ketones. The present protocol involves Ru&#8208;catalyzed deoxygenative functionalization of phenols via &#960;&#8208;coordination activation.








Abstract
Given the vast occurrence and availability of both primary amides and phenols, the synthesis of N&#8208;aryl amides via direct coupling between these starting materials would be much attractive. Herein, we report an efficient method for the mechanochemical synthesis of N&#8208;aryl amides via ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed direct amidation of unprotected phenols with primary amides with water as the sole byproduct. Unexpectedly, replacing amides with methyl carboxylic acids, esters, or ketones, the same reaction led to the formation of &#945;&#8208;aryl carbonyl derivatives instead of the anticipated aryl carboxylates. The synthetic strategy accepts a wide scope of primary amides, alkyl carbonyls, and phenolic substrates to deliver 28 expected N&#8208;aryl amides and 14 unexpected &#945;&#8208;aryl carbonyl derivatives with good to excellent yields. The developed synthetic approach would serve as the better alternative to the classical cross&#8208;coupling reactions in context to the PASE (pot, atom, and step economy) synthesis and late&#8208;stage modification of structurally complex molecules, including natural products and pharmaceuticals.

The present protocol involves Ru-catalyzed deoxygenative functionalization of phenols via &#960;-coordination activation.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the vast occurrence and availability of both primary amides and phenols, the synthesis of N-aryl amides via direct coupling between these starting materials would be much attractive. Herein, we report an efficient method for the mechanochemical synthesis of N-aryl amides via ruthenium-catalyzed direct amidation of unprotected phenols with primary amides with water as the sole byproduct. Unexpectedly, replacing amides with methyl carboxylic acids, esters, or ketones, the same reaction led to the formation of &#945;-aryl carbonyl derivatives instead of the anticipated aryl carboxylates. The synthetic strategy accepts a wide scope of primary amides, alkyl carbonyls, and phenolic substrates to deliver 28 expected N-aryl amides and 14 unexpected &#945;-aryl carbonyl derivatives with good to excellent yields. The developed synthetic approach would serve as the better alternative to the classical cross-coupling reactions in context to the PASE (pot, atom, and step economy) synthesis and late-stage modification of structurally complex molecules, including natural products and pharmaceuticals.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Expanded Structural Design of Organic Ionic Plastic Crystals Based on Linear Tris&#8208;Pyrrolidinium Salt</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 34, June 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of linear tris&#8208;pyrrolidinium salts was designed to expand the structural versatility of organic ionic plastic crystals (OIPCs). These compounds exhibit multiple solid&#8211;solid phase transitions and high electrochemical stability. Their composites with Li salts show significantly enhanced ionic conductivity.








Abstract
Organic ionic plastic crystal (OIPC) materials exhibit soft solid phases within a specific temperature range, making them promising candidates for various electrochemical devices due to their intrinsic ionic conductivity and electrochemical stability. In this study, a series of linear tris&#8208;pyrrolidinium salts with different alkyl side chain lengths and counter&#8208;anions were synthesized and systematically characterized in terms of their structural, thermal, and electrochemical properties. Among the synthesized compounds, N,N&#8208;bis(4&#8208;(N&#8242;&#8208;undecylpyrrolidinium)butyl)pyrrolidinium trishexafluorophosphate (11&#8208;PF6) exhibited two solid&#8208;solid phase transitions and a low fusion entropy (&#916;Sf) of 13&#160;J&#183;K&#8722;1&#183;mol&#8722;1 at 210&#160;&#176;C. Similarly, N,N&#8208;bis(4&#8208;(N&#8242;&#8208;dodecylpyrrolidinium)butyl)pyrrolidinium tris&#8208;hexafluorophosphate (12&#8208;PF6) showed multiple phase transitions with a low &#916;Sf of 18&#160;J&#183;K&#8722;1&#183;mol&#8722;1 at 206&#160;&#176;C. The temperature&#8208;dependent soft crystalline phases of 11&#8208;PF6 were identified as plastic crystal phase using polarized optical microscopy and 1D wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (WAXS). The ionic conductivity of 11&#8208;PF6 was measured to be 2.04&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;6 S&#183;cm&#8722;1 at 70&#160;&#176;C. Upon blending with 80 mol% LiTf2N, the ionic conductivity significantly increased to 1.16&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;4 S&#183;cm&#8722;1. Electrochemical stability was evaluated via linear sweep voltammetry (LSV). The composite solid electrolyte consisting of 11&#8208;PF6 and 80 mol% LiTf2N exhibited electrochemical stability up to 5.4&#160;V (versus Li/Li+), highlighting its potential as a high&#8208;voltage electrolyte component.

         <title>A Very Readily Prepared Ligand for Rhodium Catalyzed Propene Hydroformylation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 34, June 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent developments aimed at switching the selectivity of rhodium catalyzed hydroformylation from a linear&#8208;selective to a branched selective reaction feature ligands that are relatively complicated to prepare. A new ligand, EasyDiPhos, can be made in just one synthetic step and gives unusually low n:iso ratios, i.e., favoring the branched aldehyde, iso&#8208;butanal, in propene hydroformylation.








Abstract
In the search for an easy&#8208;to&#8208;make ligand that would enable Rh catalyzed hydroformylation of propene to favor the branched aldehydes, iso&#8208;butanal, bis&#8208;phosphonites and bis&#8208;phosphoramidites were designed. Catalysts derived from bis&#8208;phosphonites gave the desired low n:iso ratios, but were unstable to hydrolysis. A bis&#8208;phosphoramidite ligand (EasyDiPhos) that can be made in just one synthetic step has been discovered that enables Rh&#8208;catalyzed hydroformylations to proceed with unusually low n:iso ratios. They were also found to have significant stability to moisture, air, and to relatively high temperatures during hydroformylation conditions. The latter was studied using a combination of high pressure infra&#8208;red (HPIR) spectroscopy and NMR analysis of the catalyst resting state after 1 week under relevant conditions. Propene hydroformylation with n:iso ratios well below 1 was carried out and with turnover numbers around 1000&#160;mol/mol in 1 hour reaction time. One of the ligands, whilst not being the most iso&#8208;selective example, had a partially flexible n:iso ratio depending on temperature and pressure. Two Pt(II) complexes were prepared and their X&#8208;ray crystal structures determined. The most&#160;iso&#8208;selective catalyst was examined at low temperature (prioritizing iso&#8208;selectivity over rates) in hydroformylation of some other terminal alkenes with significant branched selectivity.

         <title>In Situ X&#8208;ray Diffraction Studies on the Reduction of U3O8 by Various Reducing Agents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 34, June 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reduction of U&#8323;O&#8328; by hydrogen, PVDF, and CaH&#8322; is investigated using continuous in situ X&#8208;ray diffraction. Phase transitions, oxygen loss, and intermediate structures are analyzed. The study elucidates how different reducing environments influence reaction pathways and final products, offering new insight into uranium oxide chemistry relevant to nuclear material processing.








Abstract
In situ X&#8208;ray diffraction studies were conducted to elucidate the reduction pathways of U3O8 using various reducing agents, including hydrogen, the fluorinating agent polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), and calcium hydride (CaH2). The reduction processes were characterized by a transition from the orthorhombic, pseudo&#8208;hexagonal phase &#945;&#8208;U3O8 to the hexagonal polymorph, followed by the formation of fluorite&#8208;type UO2+x phases. The reduction temperature and intermediate phases vary with the type of reducing agent, though they all follow a similar sequence of phases. In the presence of pure hydrogen and upon reaction with PVDF and CaH2, U3O8 transformed entirely into fluorite&#8208;type phases UO2+x. By decreasing the chemical potential of hydrogen via its partial pressure, the behavior of U3O8 preceding the reduction to UO2+x can be switched from an orthorhombic&#8208;to&#8208;hexagonal phase transition followed by disproportionation to two different U3O8 phases, presumably with different oxygen content, to a continuous oxygen loss within one U3O8 phase without prior phase transition. The detailed analysis of lattice parameters and phase transformations in the course of the investigated reactions offers insights into the reduction pathways of uranium oxides, highlighting the impact of different reducing environments on the reaction pathways and final products.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 34, June 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of anion exchange polyelectrolytes with wide&#8208;ranged branching ratio (BR) and fractional free volume (FFV) were synthesized to meet the discrepant requirements for anion exchange membranes (AEMs) and ionomers (AEIs). By controlling BR, the resulting stable and porosity&#8208;adjustable structures not only address the conductivity&#8211;toughness trade&#8208;off for AEMs but also meet the opposite gas permeation demands of AEMs and AEIs.








Abstract
Rational design of polyelectrolytes that simultaneously meets the requirements for anion exchange membrane (AEM) and ionomer (AEI), especially the opposite gas permeation demands for anion exchange membrane water electrolysis (AEMWE) with similar chemical structure is challenging. To overcome the formation of insoluble gel at high branching ratio (BR), herein, a series of anion exchange polyelectrolytes of intrinsic microporosity with wide&#8208;ranged fractional free volume and good solubility at high BR are fabricated through a stepwise nonstoichiometric superacid&#8208;catalyzed polycondensation reaction. By precisely controlling the BR and free volume, a stable and porosity&#8208;adjustable structure is generated, which not only addresses the conductivity&#8211;toughness trade&#8208;off of AEM but also possesses high OH&#8722; conductivity for AEI. Most importantly, it fulfills the opposite gas permeation demands for AEM and AEI and decreases the overpotentials of ohmic polarization and mass transport by 76.2% and 44.2%, respectively. The membrane electrode assembly fabricated by the optimized AEM and AEI achieves 1.98&#160;V (pure water) and 1.62&#160;V (1&#160;M KOH) at 1 A cm&#8722;2 with high stability. This work provides a strategy for rational design of polyelectrolytes that meets the requirements of AEM and AEI for high&#8208;performance AEMWE.

A convenient strategy by synergistic delivering DNA and DNA photocleavage agents to tumor cells was developed for effective photodynamic immunotherapy under hypoxia.








Abstract
Plasmid DNAs intercalated with Ru(II) complexes were encapsulated in liposomes to create nano&#8208;photosensitizers. Upon light exposure, the ruthenium complex photo&#8208;cleavages DNA. The DNA fragments specifically stimulate the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway and induce immunogenic death. This study presents a convenient strategy for photodynamic immunotherapy against cisplatin&#8208;resistant tumor cells under hypoxia.

         <title>Polymerase Synthesis of Hypermodified DNA Displaying a Combination of Thiol, Hydroxyl, Carboxylate, and Imidazole Functional Groups in the Major Groove</title>

A series of 2&#8217;&#8208;deoxyribonucleoside 5&#8217;&#8208;O&#8208;triphosphates bearing functional groups of amino acid side chains in enzyme active sites (OH, SH, COOH, and imidazole) were synthesized and used for enzymatic synthesis of hypermodified DNA displaying these substituents in the major groove mimicking peptides or proteins.








Abstract
We designed and synthesized a set of six 2&#8217;&#8208;deoxyribonucleoside 5&#8217;&#8208;O&#8208;triphosphates (dNTPs) bearing functional groups mimicking amino acid side chains in enzyme active sites (OH, SH, COOH, and imidazole) attached to position 5 of pyrimidines or position 7 of 7&#8208;deazapurines through different linkers. These modified dNTPs were studied as substrates in enzymatic synthesis of modified and hypermodified DNA using several DNA polymerases. In primer extension (PEX), all modified dNTPs provided DNA containing one, two, three, or, (all) four modified nucleotides each bearing a different modification, although the thiol&#8208;modified dNTPs were worse substrates compared to the others. In PCR, we observed exponential amplification for any combination of one, two, or three nonsulfur dNTPs but the thiol&#8208;modified dNTP did not work well in any combinations. Sequencing of the hypermodified DNA confirmed the good fidelity of the incorporation of all the modified nucleotides. This set of modified dNTPs extends the portfolio of building blocks for prospective use in selections of functional nucleic acids.

         <title>Computational Exploration of Stereoelectronic Relationships in Manganese&#8208;Catalyzed Hydrogenation Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 34, June 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A detailed computational investigation of stereoelectronic effects in enantioselective manganese&#8208;catalyzed hydrogenation reactions uncovered two general routes to improved selectivity; namely extension of &#960;&#8208;system and increased steric bulk (quantified through occupied volume in quadrants). Electronic effects were evaluated through Hammett correlations, revealing opposing electronic demands on the thermodynamics and kinetics of the key catalytic step of H2 activation.








Abstract
Stereoelectronic effects governing Mn&#8208;catalyzed hydrogenation reactions have been deconvoluted through the analysis of a series of in silico catalyst modifications using DFT (PBE0&#8208;D3PCM(EtOH)/def2&#8208;TZVP//RI&#8208;BP86PCM(EtOH)/def2&#8208;SVP level of theory). Computations were performed on the Mn&#8208;catalyzed reduction of indanone based on a catalyst from the Clarke group, consisting of a tridentate ligand with pyridine, amine, and phosphine donors and a ferrocenyl linker in the backbone. Enantioselectivity enhancements were found through two pathways; first, with the stabilization of aromatic substrates by means of an extended &#960;&#8208;system, enhancing &#960;&#8208;stacking noncovalent interactions; second, by the introduction of steric bulk around the active site to destabilize one of the diastereomeric hydride transfer transition states. Electronic effects were differentiated from sterics by modification of the phenyl groups at the phosphine, trans&#8208; to the metal&#8208;hydride bond. While electron&#8208;withdrawing groups increased the thermodynamic driving force, the highest activity is predicted with electron&#8208;donating groups due to the improved basicity of the nitrogen lone pair, required for the initiation of hydrogen activation. Based on these observations, promising routes for synthetic catalyst design may involve donating groups which improve activity, coupled with enantiodiscrimination via steric bulk as a more general strategy than being limited to &#960;&#8208;containing substrates.

         <title>Coupling CoOx@NC&#160;with NiFe LDH Enhances Oxygen Electrocatalysis for Rechargeable High&#8208;Efficiency Zn&#8208;Air Batteries</title>

A nanoscale composite of NiFe LDH nanosheets anchored on Co&#8208;containing N&#8208;rich carbon and interconnected CNT framework ((CoOx@NC)2&#9472;NiFe), prepared by a facile one&#8208;pot pyrolysis and subsequent hydrothermal route, exhibits excellent OER and ORR performance in alkaline electrolytes, which is comparable to and even exceeds that of representative bifunctional electrocatalysts.








Abstract
Developing bifunctional catalysts with the high oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalytic activities is of great significance in improving the efficiency of rechargeable Zn&#8208;air batteries. Herein, this study adopts simple one&#8208;pot pyrolysis and subsequent hydrothermal strategies to prepare a high&#8208;performance bifunctional composite catalyst by coupling a layered hydroxide NiFe LDH with Co and N codoped carbon framework, composed of cobalt oxide and metallic Co nanoparticles distributed on interconnected porous carbon nanosheets and carbon nanotubes (CNTs). Benefiting from the exposure of more active sites, high conductivity, and beneficial charge transport advantages, the best catalyst (CoOx@NC)2&#9472;NiFe demonstrates excellent bifunctional electrocatalytic activities and stability for oxygen&#8208;related electrochemical reactions, exhibiting a low potential gap of 0.757&#160;V. Additionally, the rechargeable Zn&#8208;air battery assembled with the (CoOx@NC)2&#9472;NiFe catalyst performs a peak power density of 136&#160;mW&#160;cm&#8722;2, and a specific capacity of 803&#160;mAh&#160;gZn&#8722;1 at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, and outstanding stability (over 200&#160;hours). This work presents a simple and low&#8208;cost approach for synthesizing bifunctional catalysts to realize efficient and durable rechargeable zinc&#8208;air batteries.

Additionally, the rechargeable Zn-air battery assembled with the (CoO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;@NC)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#9472;NiFe catalyst performs a peak power density of 136&#160;mW&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and a specific capacity of 803&#160;mAh&#160;g&lt;sub&gt;Zn&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and outstanding stability (over 200&#160;hours). This work presents a simple and low-cost approach for synthesizing bifunctional catalysts to realize efficient and durable rechargeable zinc-air batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>From Desferrioxamine B Umpolung to an Enantiopure Bifunctional Chelator for 89Zr&#8208;immunoPET</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 34, June 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Functional group transformations were performed at the pendent amine residue of desferrioxamine B (DFO), the commercial siderophore used in various medical applications, including iron decorporation, antibiotic development, and molecular imaging. Our results will broaden the scope of reactions, so far restricted to amide bond formation, for the functionalization of DFO with, for example, a chromophore, an additional ligand, a bioconjugable spacer.








Abstract
Promising results in preclinical diagnosis based on 89Zr&#8208;immunoPET have fostered the development of efficient chelators for this tetravalent metal. Leads in this area are octadentate ligands obtained by extension of the desferrioxamine B trihydroxamic acid DFO with a fourth bidentate ligand. In the approach reported here, the latter is a natural 6&#8208;membered cyclic hydroxamic acid deriving from (L)&#8208;ornithine. Its coupling to DFO via an (L)&#8208;lysine spacer required that the genuine amine function of the DFO terminus be changed to a carboxylic acid. Such a requirement prompted us to explore short sequences of chemical transformations that would challenge total syntheses leading to the same products. As a matter of fact, the target C&#8208;terminal DFO analogue was obtained in benzyl&#8208;protected form in three steps from commercially available DFO in 16% overall yield. Our short&#8208;step approach allowed us to implement other functionalities without DFO extension: &#8208;OH, &#8208;OTs, &#8208;CHO, &#8208;C(O)CH3, and &#8208;CH&#9552;CH2.

         <title>Amination of 1&#8208;Amino&#8208;4&#8208;Bromoanthraquinone&#8208;2&#8208;Sulfonic Acid Enabled by Alternating Current Electrolysis of Symmetrical Copper Electrodes</title>

Amination of 1&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;bromoanthraquinone&#8208;2&#8208;sulfonic acid (BAA) is achieved by alternating current (AC) electrolysis on symmetrical Cu electrodes without the need for CuCl or CuSO4 with SnCl2. The application of AC enables the formation of the Cu2O passivation film on both copper electrode surfaces, allowing continuous generation of Cu+ for catalyzing BAA amination.








Abstract
Amination of 1&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;bromoanthraquinone&#8208;2&#8208;sulfonic acid (BAA), crucial for anthraquinone&#8208;type dyes production, relies on Cu+ catalysis. However, Cu+ disproportionation causes catalyst deactivation, requiring large amounts of Cu catalysts (e.g., CuSO4 or CuCl) and reductants (e.g., FeSO4), introducing heavy metals and increasing water consumption to remove byproducts and metals, raising both environmental and economic costs. To address these challenges, we introduce a innovative strategy for the in situ generation of Cu+ using symmetrical Cu electrodes under alternating current (AC) electrolysis. This method achieves 100% conversion of BAA in the amination with 3,5&#8208;diamino&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;trimethylbenzene sulfonic acid (M Acid) with 95% yield, while also providing a solution to the issue of Cu+ disproportionation without the need for any additional copper catalysts or reductants, demonstrating a broad substrate scope and significantly reducing water usage in post&#8208;treatment. Characterization techniques, including X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray diffraction, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, reveal that the passive Cu2O film formed on the symmetrical Cu electrodes under AC electrolysis continuously generates Cu+, which is crucial for the reaction. This approach is scalable, environmentally friendly, and holds great potential for industrial applications, offering substantial economic benefits while reducing environmental impact.

         <title>Cis&#8208;Chelating Diphosphanes for Intracavity Nickel(II)&#8208;Catalyzed Ethylene Oligomerization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 34, June 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Four cavity&#8208;shaped diphosphanes have been synthesized from both &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrins. The metal&#8208;confining properties of these ligands were exploited in nickel&#8208;catalyzed ethylene oligomerization.

Abstract
Four cis&#8208;chelating diphosphanes derived from cyclodextrins (CDs), each featuring a distinct intracavity environment, compel NiII or PdII metal centers to reside within &#945;&#8208; or &#946;&#8208;CD cavities. Nickel(II) complexes of these metal&#8208;confining ligands act as active catalysts in ethylene oligomerization upon activation with modified methylaluminoxane (MMAO). The size of the cavity and the position of the P2Ni fragment relative to the cavity affect both the activity and selectivity of the reaction. In all instances, 1&#8208;butene is the major product (up to 98% C4 products and 90% 1&#8208;butene within the C4 fraction). Extensive theoretical studies with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art methods carried out on the most selective system suggest that the CD cavity restricts isomerization pathways by limiting the mobility of the coordinated olefin in this constrained supramolecular environment, thereby enhancing &#945;&#8208;olefin formation.

         <title>Late&#8208;Stage Amination of Peptides on the Solid Phase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 34, June 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of amines into peptides via an on&#8208;resin iodination&#8208;substitution reaction sequence provides access to a wide variety of modifications, including amine&#8208;based metal ligands. Primary, secondary, and aromatic amines, as well as heteroaromatic N&#8208;nucleophiles, have been successfully incorporated into the reaction sequence. Particularly basic amines or ammonium chlorides can also be used successfully with acid or base additives.








Abstract
Late&#8208;stage peptide modification is a powerful tool for rapidly generating a library of peptide mimetics, for example, for drug discovery or catalyst development. While late&#8208;stage modifications exist for many types of structural features, methods for introducing amines into peptides via a late&#8208;stage approach are rare, despite their enormous potential for the development of peptide therapeutics. Here we present a protocol for introducing amines into peptides by our established on&#8208;resin iodination&#8208;substitution approach. Our method is compatible with a wide variety of amines, including primary and secondary amines, anilines, and other heteroaromatic N&#8208;nucleophiles mostly giving good to excellent yields. We introduce amines that are pharmacologically relevant as well as those that can impart catalytic or metal&#8208;binding properties into the peptide of interest. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study, we introduce the metal ligand tris(2&#8208;aminoethyl)amine (tren) into a tryptophan zipper scaffold using our late&#8208;stage amination approach to explore metal&#8208;induced stapling. Indeed, metal complexation via the tren ligand resulted in a thermal stabilization of more than 30&#160;K in one of our tryptophan zipper designs.

         <title>The Evolution of Fluorescein into A Potential Theranostic Tool</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 31, Issue 34, June 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Our study successfully evolved a fluorescent imaging agent into a potent therapeutic compound. By functionalizing fluorescein, we enhanced its fluorescence and adapted it for multicomponent reactions (MCRs). We synthesized over 20 compounds across four diverse scaffolds. Compound 5e shows strong 15&#8208;LOX&#8208;1 inhibition, favorable properties and cell permeability, making it ideal for imaging and screening assays.








Abstract
Recent advances in drug discovery and development have been marked by the emergence of new modalities, including small molecule theranostic agents. While initial results from clinical trials have been promising, modern detectable inhibitors are still in an early stage of development. In this study, we present a strategy for chemically evolving a fluorescent imaging agent into a potent therapeutic entity, which not only retains its properties but also enhances its inhibition and detection applicability. By utilizing 15&#8208;LOX&#8208;1 as a model system, we leverage prior knowledge of its inhibitors to rationally functionalize fluorescein, enabling the targeted and highly efficient synthesis of over 20 derivatives across four different scaffolds. This approach ultimately led to the development of a potent, cell&#8208;permeable inhibitor that effectively engages its target in live cells and enables real&#8208;time visualization. These findings validate our new strategy for the development of small molecule diagnostic modulators, paving the way for application in other targets as well.

Three new heterobimetallic complexes [CuCl(o&#8208;van&#8208;en)LnCl(H2O)3]Cl&#183;C2H6O (Ln = Sm (1), Eu (2), Gd (3)), with the bicompartmental Schiff&#8208;base ligand (o&#8208;van&#8208;en)2&#8722;, were synthesized using horizontal diffusion.

Abstract
Three new dinuclear complexes [CuCl(o&#8208;van&#8208;en)Ln(H2O)3 Cl]Cl&#183;C2H6O (Ln = Sm (1), Eu (2), Gd (3); H2(o&#8208;van&#8208;en) is the Schiff base formed by 2/1 condensation of o&#8208;vanillin and ethylenediamine) were prepared in a single crystal form by the method of horizontal diffusion. The prepared complexes were characterized by chemical analyses and IR spectroscopy. The three complexes are isostructural and the Cu(II) is situated in the smaller cavities while the larger cavities accommodate larger Ln(III) atoms. The pentacoordination of the Cu(II) atoms is completed by a chlorido ligand in the apical position, while the octacoordination of the Ln(III) atoms is achieved by three additional aqua and one chlorido coligands. AC susceptibility studies have shown that complexes 2 and 3 exhibit field supported slow magnetic relaxation while complex 1 does not display AC activity.

         <title>On the Reaction of Pacman&#8208;Phosphanes with Lewis Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reactions of Pacman phosphanes (1a) with Lewis acids such as R3B (R = C6H5, C6F5) and GaCl3 was investigated. While equilibria between mono&#8208; and di&#8208;adducts were found in the reaction with BPh3, B(C6F5)3 preferentially formed the di&#8208;adduct (1a&#183;2B(C6F5)3), which could be isolated and fully characterized. DFT calculations showed that the N&#8208;bonded adducts are thermodynamically more stable than the P&#8208;bonded adducts. In contrast to the reaction of the Pacman phosphane with boranes, GaCl3 reacted with 1a to give an unusual [Pacman&#8208;GaCl2]+[GaCl4]&#8211; salt, featuring a nearly planar GaN2C2 heterocycle as part of the Pacman macrocycle. In addition, the coordination geometry on one P atom changes from triple to an unusual quadruple coordination, although it is still a formal P atom in the +III oxidation state, as shown by quantum chemical calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Macrocyclic Arenes with Expanded Cavities from Seven&#8208;Membered&#8208;Ring&#8208;Fused Monomers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Macrocyclic arenes exhibit host&#8211;guest properties, but their internal cavities are often limited by unit rotation. To overcome this, we synthesized macrocyclic arenes from seven&#8208;membered&#8208;ring&#8208;fused monomers, achieving expanded and stable cavities. Cavity volume calculations confirmed significant cavity expansion, and NMR studies demonstrated enhanced guest encapsulation ability.








Abstract
Numerous macrocyclic arenes have been synthesized from various types of aromatic monomers. However, the rotation of monomer units often reduces the internal cavity volume. To address this issue, seven&#8208;membered&#8208;ring&#8208;fused monomers were employed for the synthesis of macrocyclic arenes. The fusion of aromatic units via seven&#8208;membered rings introduces a bent geometry into the macrocyclic framework, which reduces conformational flexibility and helps preserve a stable and expanded internal cavity in both solution and solid states.

         <title>Epoxy Resin Patterns Prepared Based on the Photochromism of a Cholesteric Liquid Crystal Mixture</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photochromic CLCs were prepared using a nematic epoxy liquid crystal and a photoisomerizable chiral dopant. Based on the photochromic property, colorful epoxy resin patterns were prepared, which were suitably applied for decoration and anti&#8208;counterfeiting.








Abstract
Cholesteric liquid crystal polymer network (CLCN) patterns based on polyacrylate have attracted much attention for the applications in decoration and anti&#8208;counterfeiting. Although epoxy resin&#8208;based CLCN patterns can be prepared using thermochromic cholesteric liquid crystals (CLCs), it is hard to prepare them on a large scale on coating lines. Herein, a photochromic CLC mixture was prepared using a reactive epoxy liquid crystal and a photoisomerizable chiral dopant. Driven by the photoisomerization of the chiral dopant, the selective Bragg reflection band of the CLC mixture redshifted with increasing the 365&#8208;nm UV light irradiation time. Due to the high viscosity of the CLC mixture, the reflection band of the irradiated CLC mixture was both time&#8208; and temperature&#8208;dependent. After photopolymerization, the structural color was fixed. By precisely controlling the annealing time after the photoisomerization of the chiral dopant or the irradiation time for photoisomerization, colorful epoxy resin patterns were prepared, which have potential applications in decoration and anti&#8208;counterfeiting.

         <title>Influence of Compactness and Crystallinity on Hole Transfer Ability of Nickel Oxide Layer in Modal Coupling Regime</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This study investigates how structural properties influence the hole migration behavior of nickel oxide (NiOx) by evaluating its photoelectrochemical performance. Two fabrication methods were employed for preparing NiOx layers. One is a sol&#8208;gel wet process, which allows wide&#8208;area coating without the need for specialized equipment. The other is atomic layer deposition, which enables uniform and conformal coverage on three&#8208;dimensional surfaces with the compact oxide layer by leveraging a self&#8208;limiting, layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer growth mechanism. Our findings reveal that both crystallinity and compactness significantly affect the hole transport capability of NiOx layers. We further integrated the NiOx layer as a hole transport layer in an Au&#8208;NPs/NiOx/Pt&#8208;film photocathode operating under a modal coupling regime. This photocathode exhibited cathodic photocurrent at wavelengths below 800 nm, with a maximum incident photon&#8208;to&#8208;current efficiency of 0.16% at 600 nm. These results demonstrate that not only the hole injection process but also hole migration properties of the NiOx layer influence the charge separation under modal coupling conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Skeletal Editing of Alkenes and Alkynes via Single&#8208;Carbon&#8208;Atom Insertion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Skeletal editing has emerged as a pivotal complement to retrosynthetic analysis strategies. This approach enables simple bulk chemical feedstocks to achieve precise atomic&#8208;level modifications&#8212;such as insertion, deletion, or swapping&#8212;facilitating the rapid assembly of complex, high value&#8208;added functional organic molecules. Currently, single&#8208;carbon&#8208;atom insertion reactions predominantly emphasizes the functionalization of (hetero)aromatic systems, leaving the site&#8208;specific editing of unsaturated C&#8208;C bond frameworks such as alkenes and alkynes, comparatively underexplored. This review provides detailed analysis and summary of recent progress in the&#160;skeletal editing of functional alkenes and alkynes derivatives via single&#8208;carbon&#8208;atom insertion, and outlining the future potential directions of this technology.</dc:description>

         <title>Understanding the SN2 versus E2 Competition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bimolecular nucleophilic substitution (SN2) and baseinduced elimination (E2) generally compete, and it is therefore essential to be in control of this competition in synthetic organic chemistry. Herein, we establish guiding principles based on quantitative molecular orbital (MO) theory and the activation strain model to understand and tune the competition between the SN2 and E2 reactions. We discuss the role of key factors, such as the nature of the Lewis base, leaving group, substrate structure, and the solvent. To this end, we introduce the concepts of characteristic distortivity, transition state acidity, intrinsic nucleophilicity, and apparent nucleophilicity. These intuitive concepts equip chemists with conceptual tools to better understand and design reactions for organic synthesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Radical Hydro&#8208;Ethoxycarbonyldifluoromethylation of Alkenes with BrCF2CO2Et</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Considering the unique properties of the CF&#8322; group and the potential for further transformations of the CO&#8322;Et component in the CF&#8322;CO&#8322;Et moiety, along with the necessity of synthesizing an alkane containing a CF&#8322;CO&#8322;Et unit for the production of the pharmaceutical lubiprostone, there has been growing interest in developing efficient methods to incorporate CF&#8322;CO&#8322;Et into alkanes. This research presents a mild, versatile, and efficient radical hydro&#8208;ethoxycarbonyldifluoromethylation process using BrCF&#8322;CO&#8322;Et. The method is applicable to both unactivated alkyl alkenes and active aryl alkenes. It stands out due to its mild reaction conditions, the lack of requirement for expensive reagents, and the absence of transition metals, offering significant advantages over previously reported techniques.








Abstract
The difluoromethylene (CF&#8322;) group, valued for its unique electronic and steric properties, plays a critical role in pharmaceutical and agrochemical design, as exemplified by drugs like lubiprostone, which requires ethyl 2,2&#8208;difluorohexanoate as a key intermediate for its synthesis. Consequently, developing efficient methods to incorporate the ethoxycarbonyldifluoromethyl group into alkanes is highly desirable. Herein, we describe a mild, versatile, and efficient radical hydro&#8208;ethoxycarbonyldifluoromethylation of alkenes with BrCF2CO2Et. This process is applicable to both unactivated alkyl alkenes and active aryl alkenes. The protocol is characterized by mild reaction conditions, the absence of expensive reagents, and the elimination of transition metals.

         <title>A supramolecular system of bioactive ionic liquid, peony extract, and peptide for enhanced permeability and synergistic skincare benefits</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The growing demand for safe and sustainable cosmetics has led to a marked inclination toward natural extracts and peptides as raw materials. In this study, we developed a sustainable system with multiple anti&#8208;aging effects by combining peony extract (PE) and acetyl hexapeptide&#8208;8 (AHP8) to simultaneously treat static and dynamic wrinkles, as well as skin dullness. As the poor skin permeability of AHP8 limited its efficacy, we used a bioactive ionic liquid derived from betaine and malic acid ([Bet][MA]) as a permeation enhancer. In vitro and in vivo zebrafish experiments indicated that [Bet][MA] not only significantly enhances transdermal and cellular penetration but also exerts synergistic anti&#8208;aging effects. While being biosafe, [Bet][MA] significantly increased the transdermal permeation, skin retention, and cellular uptake of AHP8. Theoretical calculations revealed that [Bet][MA] improved the anti&#8208;wrinkle and whitening efficacies of AHP8 and PE through supramolecular interactions; it modulated their electron cloud distribution and molecular polarity and thus intensified their affinity to target proteins in aqueous solutions. The supramolecular PE/AHP8/[Bet][MA] system demonstrated excellent radical&#8208; and reactive oxygen species&#8208;scavenging capability, collagen production, and tissue repair capability while concurrently inhibiting tyrosinase activity, motion signaling, and inflammation. The study findings pave the way for sustainable and multifunctional skincare solutions.</dc:description>

         <title>Convergent Approach Toward ADP&#8208;Ribosylated Peptides via a Chemoselective Phosphate Condensation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This research presents a convergent approach for synthesizing well&#8208;defined ADP&#8208;ribosylated peptides. It involves a regio&#8208; and chemoselective condensation of phosphoadenosyl (ADPr) fragments with phosphoribosyl peptides, allowing for the creation of various ADP&#8208;ribosylated peptides, including a di&#8208;ADP&#8208;ribosylated&#8208;peptide as the first example of a synthetic oligo&#8208;ADP&#8208;ribosylated peptide.








Abstract
The preparation of well&#8208;defined ADP&#8208;ribosylated peptides is essential for studying the functional implications of this post&#8208;translational modification. While methodologies exist for the chemical synthesis of short oligo&#8208;ADPr fragments and mono&#8208;ADP&#8208;ribosylated peptides separately, combining the two distinct chemistries, required to assemble them, has remained challenging. In this research, we employ a methodology for the regio&#8208; and chemoselective condensation of two phosphomonoesters to convergently install the pyrophosphate bond in ADP&#8208;ribosylated constructs. A diverse set of phosphoribosylated peptides, varying in the amino acid acceptor, was prepared and condensed with adenosine monophosphate to yield mono&#8208;ADP&#8208;ribosylated peptides. Furthermore, a solid&#8208;phase approach was developed to access a phosphoadenosyl&#8208;ADPr fragment, which was used to prepare a di&#8208;ADPr&#8208;peptide as the first example of a synthetic oligo&#8208;ADP&#8208;ribosylated peptide. Overall, the work presented here extends synthetic methodology for the preparation of well&#8208;defined ADP&#8208;ribosylated peptides.

     alt="Convergent Approach Toward ADP-Ribosylated Peptides via a Chemoselective Phosphate Condensation"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This research presents a convergent approach for synthesizing well-defined ADP-ribosylated peptides. It involves a regio- and chemoselective condensation of phosphoadenosyl (ADPr) fragments with phosphoribosyl peptides, allowing for the creation of various ADP-ribosylated peptides, including a di-ADP-ribosylated-peptide as the first example of a synthetic oligo-ADP-ribosylated peptide.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The preparation of well-defined ADP-ribosylated peptides is essential for studying the functional implications of this post-translational modification. While methodologies exist for the chemical synthesis of short oligo-ADPr fragments and mono-ADP-ribosylated peptides separately, combining the two distinct chemistries, required to assemble them, has remained challenging. In this research, we employ a methodology for the regio- and chemoselective condensation of two phosphomonoesters to convergently install the pyrophosphate bond in ADP-ribosylated constructs. A diverse set of phosphoribosylated peptides, varying in the amino acid acceptor, was prepared and condensed with adenosine monophosphate to yield mono-ADP-ribosylated peptides. Furthermore, a solid-phase approach was developed to access a phosphoadenosyl-ADPr fragment, which was used to prepare a di-ADPr-peptide as the first example of a synthetic oligo-ADP-ribosylated peptide. Overall, the work presented here extends synthetic methodology for the preparation of well-defined ADP-ribosylated peptides.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Quantum Chemistry Based Simulation of Enantioseparation on Cyclodextrin&#8208; and Polysaccharide&#8208;Based Chiral Stationary Phases</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We employed a systematic quantum chemistry&#8208;based computational approach for simulating chiral HPLC, incorporating high&#8208;level DFT methods. For the popular polysaccharide&#8208;based CSPs, 90%$\%$ of determined elution orders were computed correctly. 








Abstract
We assess the capability of modern quantum chemical methods to simulate enantioseparation on chiral stationary phases (CSPs) in high&#8208;performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) by comparing calculated and experimental elution orders (EEOs). Compared to previous studies, this work utilizes more accurate state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art density functional theory (DFT) methods combined with automated computational workflows. The proposed approach employs molecular docking, conformer sampling, and DFT refinement for final ensemble&#8208;based association free energy calculations of two diastereomeric complexes. Ten drug&#8208;type molecules were considered on two common CSPs for which various molecular models were investigated. Although the association free energies of the strongest binding motifs were rather system&#8208;dependen t ranging from about &#8722;9 to 29&#160;kcal/mol, the differences between the two enantiomers were always only a few kcal/mol, sometimes even below 1&#160;kcal/mol. Despite these small differences, correct determination of EEOs for all tested cyclodextrin&#8208;based CSP systems was achieved. Even for more flexible polysaccharide&#8208;based CSPs, the workflow yielded correct EEO results in 90%$\%$ of the tested cases, provided that a sufficiently large cut&#8208;out of the CSP material consisting of about 150 atoms was considered as a model. Due to the latter constraint, the method remains computationally expensive, requiring further research for improving practical application in, e.g., screening&#160;studies.

         <title>The&#160;Molecular Properties of Honey Bee Acetylcholinesterase Reveal Opportunities to Avoid Off&#8208;Target Effects in Insecticide Discovery</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structure, dynamics, and kinetics of the essential enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE) of honey bee have been studied and compared to AChEs in mosquitoes and mammalians. Profiling of the active sites with selected substrates and AChE inhibitors revealed dramatic differences between the species. Molecular modelling identified key arene&#8211;arene interactions unique for honey bee AChE, important for monitoring off&#8208;target effects in the development of AChE&#8208;targeting pesticides used in agriculture and for mosquito control.








Abstract
Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) regulates nerve signalling and is a well&#8208;validated target for insect control in both agriculture and the prevention of mosquito&#8208;borne diseases. However, current AChE&#8208;targeting insecticides are nonspecific and thus also affect other organisms such as honey bees. The synaptic AChE of honey bees (AChE2) is encoded by the ace&#8208;2 gene, thought to have originated from a gene duplication of ace&#8208;1. Here, we analyse the structure, dynamics, and kinetics of AChE2 enzymes from the honey bee, Apis mellifera (AmAChE2), and the malaria mosquito, Anopheles gambiae (AgAChE2), and compare them to the more extensively studied type 1 mosquito AChE (AgAChE1) and mammalian AChEs. Important differences between these AChE subtypes were identified. Profiling with selected noncovalent AChE inhibitors revealed strong AChE2 inhibitors, but the inhibition profiles of AChE2 differed substantially from those for AgAChE1 and human AChE. Modelling of AChE2&#8226;inhibitor complexes revealed two tyrosines unique to AChE2 that are responsible for these differences in inhibitor sensitivity. These results highlight the importance of considering molecular properties of AChE2 when developing AChE1 inhibitors for pest control. Furthermore, the results also suggest that including AChE2 in computer&#8208;aided molecular design efforts during the discovery process could be very valuable for reducing risks of off&#8208;target effects.

         <title>Redox&#8208;Induced Structural Rearrangement in an M8L2 Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electron&#8208;rich ligand, based on the so&#8208;called exTTF moiety, self&#8208;assembles with a bimetallic ruthenium complex to provide an M8L2 architecture, where the two ligands adopt a perpendicular orientation. Thanks to the unique electronic and geometric features of the exTTF core, this discrete structure undergoes a structural transformation into a new M8Lox2 species upon oxidation, in which both dicationic ligands rotate in a face&#8208;to&#8208;face fashion, yielding a cage&#8208;like structure.








Abstract
Due to the reversible nature of the metal&#8211;ligand bond, coordination cages are inherently dynamic architectures which can undergo structural transformations upon appropriate external stimulations. This adaptability has been widely explored in various fields. Herein, we report the preparation of a redox&#8208;responsive discrete (Ru2)4L2 architecture through a coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly approach, where Ru2 is a bis(ruthenium(II)) complex and L a tetrapyridyl ligand. Importantly, ligand L is designed around the &#960;&#8208;extended tetrathiafulvalene framework (exTTF), whose geometry is highly sensitive to its redox state. The resulting (Ru2)4L2 assembly was fully characterized, revealing a twisted configuration with two orthogonally oriented L units in close spatial proximity. Remarkably, this assembly undergoes an oxidation&#8208;induced transformation into a (Ru2)4Lox&#8322; structure, in which the two dicationic ligands are now spatially separated and aligned according to a face&#8208;to&#8208;face arrangement, affording a cage&#8208;like structure. This reorganization is driven by the redox&#8208;induced geometric and electronic changes of the exTTF cores and the resulting electrostatic repulsions occurring between both oxidized ligands. The process is fully reversible upon chemical reduction, restoring the original (Ru2)4L&#8322; structure.

         <title>Light&#8208;Induced Folding of Azobenzene Derivatives with Axial Chirality and Chirality Inversion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Featuring an azobenzene core with chiral amino acid arms, this system uses photo&#8208;isomerization to drive reversible folding. The trans&#8208;form is stabilized via intramolecular CH&#8211;&#960; interactions, while the cis&#8208;form relies on amide N&#9472;H&#183;&#183;&#183;O hydrogen bonds. This light&#8208;induced structural switching enables reversible manipulation of chiroptical properties and the emergence of axial chirality, demonstrating chirality transportation.








Abstract
Understanding of photoisomerism effect on the chiral transportation occurred intra&#8208; and intermolecularly shall facilitates the fabrication of smart chiroptical materials for sensing, recognition, and display. Here we present the photoisomerization&#8208;enabled molecular folding and chirality transportation. Azobenzene core is conjugated with two chiral arms comprising of amino acid segments. The substituted position including ortho&#8208; and para&#8208;positioned substituents affects the formation of intramolecular interactions, leading to distinct adaptiveness toward the solvent media. The trans&#8208;cis isomerism of azobenzene allows for the reversible manipulation of chiroptical properties, accompanied by the appearance of axial chirality. The ortho&#8208;substituted azobenzene can form folded structures stabilized by intramolecular CH&#8211;&#960; interactions in trans&#8208;form, while in the cis&#8208;form, the conformation is stabilized by the hydrogen bonds between the oxygen atom and the hydrogen attached to the nitrogen in the amide segment. Structural transformations induced by solvent and light irradiation were revealed through density&#8208;functional theory (DFT)&#8208;based computational studies and experimental results. This work unveils the photoisomerization effect on folding, and achieves reversible conformational changes and chirality inversion, showing potential for constructing advanced smart chiroptical materials.

The substituted position including &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;- and &lt;i&gt;para&lt;/i&gt;-positioned substituents affects the formation of intramolecular interactions, leading to distinct adaptiveness toward the solvent media. The &lt;i&gt;trans-cis&lt;/i&gt; isomerism of azobenzene allows for the reversible manipulation of chiroptical properties, accompanied by the appearance of axial chirality. The ortho-substituted azobenzene can form folded structures stabilized by intramolecular CH&#8211;&#960; interactions in &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-form, while in the &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-form, the conformation is stabilized by the hydrogen bonds between the oxygen atom and the hydrogen attached to the nitrogen in the amide segment. Structural transformations induced by solvent and light irradiation were revealed through density-functional theory (DFT)-based computational studies and experimental results. This work unveils the photoisomerization effect on folding, and achieves reversible conformational changes and chirality inversion, showing potential for constructing advanced smart chiroptical materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>N,N&#8208;Bis(trifluoromethyl)aminoacetonitrile: A Versatile Building Block for the Introduction of the Bis(trifluoromethyl)amino Group</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
N,N&#8208;Bis(trifluoromethyl)aminoacetonitrile (CF3)2NCH2CN, which is readily accessible, is established as a versatile starting compound for the synthesis of various types of (CF3)2N&#8208;containing building blocks, that is, N&#8208;heterocycles, alkenes, and acid derivatives such as N,N&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)glycine. The degradation of (CF3)2N derivatives in strong acidic and basic media at elevated temperatures to result in nonpersistent compounds is highlighted.








Abstract
N,N&#8208;Bis(trifluoromethyl)aminoacetonitrile (CF3)2NCH2CN (1) that is accessible via a simple single&#8208;step protocol is established as a building block for the introduction of the (CF3)2N group. The two reaction sites of 1, the methylene unit and the nitrile (cyano) group, provide access to different organic substance classes. This includes alkenes via Knoevenagel condensations, and N&#8208;heterocycles and acid derivatives obtained by addition reactions to the nitrile unit. These new (CF3)2N derivatives are potential building blocks containing the bis(trifluoromethyl)amino group. Deprotonation of 1 at the methylene group highlights the electron&#8208;withdrawing nature of the (CF3)2N group. The {(CF3)2NCHCN}&#8722; anion (1&#8722;) is characterized by NMR spectroscopy and its reaction with [Ph3PAuCl] results in [Ph3PAuCH{N(CF3)2}(CN)] (Au1) and [(Ph3PAu)2C{N(CF3)2}(CN)] (Au21). Crystal structure analysis of (CF3)2NCH2CN (1), Au21, and almost all alkenes, N&#8208;heterocycles, and acid derivatives with a (CF3)2N group combined with spectroscopic data and results from DFT calculations provide insight into properties of the highly fluorinated (CF3)2N substituent. Especially the ability of the amino nitrogen atom to participate in weak hydrogen bonding, albeit its low basicity, is of relevance.

         <title>Ar&#8211;X Coupling Reactions of Cationic Aryl Copper(II) Complexes with Organic Substrates: What Role Do Radicals Play?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
One of the simplest cationic copper(II) aryl complexes with a bidentate chelating ligand, [(phen)Cu(Ph)]+, has been prepared in the gas phase via three routes: transmetalation, desulfination and decarboxylation. The bimolecular reactivity of this organocopper(II) cation towards a range of organic substrates showcases versatile C&#8211;H, C&#8211;C, C&#8211;I, and C&#8211;S bond formation pathways, some of which involve formation of radicals.








Abstract
Copper(II) aryl species are proposed intermediates in copper catalysed C&#8208;X coupling reactions. Here, the formation and reactions of the cationic copper complexes [(phen)Cu(Ar)]+ (phen&#160;=&#160;1,10&#8208;phenanthroline; Ar&#160;=&#160;Ph, p&#8208;MeC6H4, p&#8208;MeOC6H4, p&#8208;MeCOC6H4) are explored in the gas&#8208;phase using electrospray ionisation (ESI) multistage mass spectrometry (MSn) experiments in a linear ion trap mass spectrometer together with Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. A survey of three routes to the preparation of [(phen)Cu(Ph)]+ showed that transmetalation of [(phen)3Cu][BPh4]+ and desulfination of [(phen)Cu(O2SPh)]+ both produced the desired complex [(phen)Cu(Ph)]+, but decarboxylation of [(phen)Cu(O2CPh)]+ gave a higher yield with fewer competing side reactions, making it the preferred route to the other aryl complexes [(phen)Cu(Ar)]+. The aryl complexes [(phen)Cu(Ar)]+ undergo protonolysis reactions with formic acid to yield a formate complex [(phen)Cu(O2CH)]+; react with N,N&#8242;&#8208;diisopropylcarbodiimide to form an adduct, likely by insertion to give [(phen)Cu((NiPr)2CAr)]+; undergo C&#8211;S bond&#8208;forming reactions with dimethyl disulfide; and react with allyl iodide by Ar&#8211;I bond&#8208;forming reactions in preference to Ar&#8211;allyl bond cross&#8208;coupling reactions. The potential reaction mechanisms associated with the different reaction pathways were explored by DFT calculations.

         <title>TAILORING SELF&#8208;ASSEMBLED PEPTIDE HYDROGELS WITH ANTIMICROBIAL OR CELL ADHESIVE PROPERTIES FOR TISSUE ENGINEERING</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bacterial colonization on biomaterials is a major issue, leading to approximately 20% of implant failures due to infection and biofilm formation. To address this, peptide&#8208;based hydrogels incorporating tailored bioactive peptides have emerged as promising candidates for applications in tissue engineering and infection control. Here, we have designed peptide sequences that incorporate i) a self&#8208;assembling unit, and ii) bioactive motifs, including the well&#8208;known RGD sequence to promote cell adhesion, or an antimicrobial peptide derived from lactoferrin (LF) to exhibit antibacterial properties. To aid in the gelation, these peptides were combined with hyaluronic acid, rendering peptide&#8208;based hydrogels without the need for additional external assembly triggers, simplifying their application in biomedical contexts. This protocol allowed for a spontaneous formation of a three&#8208;dimensional fibrillar network, with structural and physicochemical properties suitable for tissue engineering. The biological evaluation revealed the ability of RGD&#8208;based hydrogels to increase the adhesion and spreading of osteoblastic cells compared to controls; while the LF&#8208;based hydrogels significantly reduced the viability and attachment of both Gram&#8208;positive and Gram&#8208;negative strains, clearly affecting bacterial morphology. This report demonstrates the feasibility of this technology to produce hydrogels incorporating distinct biological cues, highlighting their potential as versatile biomaterials to address diverse biomedical challenges.</dc:description>

         <title>Amine&#8208;AlH3 Adducts as Energetic Materials for a New Generation of Solid Fuels</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Energetic materials, mainly in the forms of propellants, explosives, and pyrotechnics, are crucial in various civilian applications, such as fuels for rockets and spacecraft. Current energetic fuels rely on highly toxic and polluting ammonium perchlorate (AP) or carcinogenic hydrazine derivatives, encouraging the search for greener and safer substitutes. This work demonstrates the first use of amine&#8209;AlH3 adducts as potential solid fuels with promising hypergolic properties and high energy content. The herein presented four amine&#8208;AlH3 adducts, AlH3 coordinated with quinuclidine (Quin), triethylenediamine (TEDA), hexamethylenetetramine (HMTA) and tetraazatricyclododecane (TATD), illustrate a unique strategy to create new solid fuels by combing AlH3 with an energy&#8208;rich nitrogen&#8208;containing molecule. The crystal structures of new compounds ([HMTA&#8209;AlH3]n and [TATD&#8209;AlH3]n) are determined from powder X&#8208;ray diffraction data. Differential scanning calorimetry&#8209;thermogravimetric analysis (DSC&#8209;TGA) of the samples combined with mass spectrometry (MS) evidences high thermal stability. The ultrashort ignition delays as low as one&#160;ms show an excellent hypergolic response. Four amine&#8208;AlH3 adducts have higher combustion heat (&gt;&#160;29&#160;kJ&#160;g&#8208;1) than conventional hydrazine fuels (19.5&#160;kJ&#160;g&#8208;1). Finally, the successful mechanochemical syntheses of Quin2AlH3 and [HMTA&#8209;AlH3]n is introduced, showcasing a green chemistry approach to high energy materials</dc:description>

         <title>Understanding Small Molecule Activation Promoted by Heavier Benzene 1,4&#8208;diides: Interplay between Diradical Character and Aromaticity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The intricate relationship between diradical character, aromaticity, and reactivity in annulated heavier Group 14 benzene&#8208;1,4&#8208;diides, i.e. [(ADC)E]2 (E = Si, Ge, Sn), based on an anionic dicarbene framework, (ADC = PhC{N(Ar)C}2: Ar = aryl), has been investigated through Density Functional Theory and ab initio calculations. The diradical character of both homo&#8208; [(ADC)E]2 and heteroleptic [(ADC)2EE'] systems (E &#8800; E') has been accurately computed, while the aromaticity of their corresponding closed&#8208;shell and open&#8208;shell singlet states has been evaluated using magnetic descriptors. Additionally, the key factors governing dihydrogen activation and cycloaddition with acetylene have been quantitatively analyzed in detail by applying the combination of the Activation Strain Model of reactivity and Energy Decomposition Analysis methods. The findings reveal a direct correlation between reactivity and diradical character, both of which increase down Group 14.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural and Optical Modification of Siloxene Nanosheets Driven by Selenium Doping</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Siloxene nanosheets are produced by topotactic deintercalation of a purified CaSi&#8322; phase and subsequently doped with selenium through thermal evaporation. Structural and spectroscopic analyses confirm dopant integration while preserving the 2D framework. This modification reduces the optical bandgap of siloxene from 2.62 to 1.79&#160;eV, enhancing the material's performance for sensing, optoelectronics, and catalysis.








Abstract
2D nanomaterials have emerged as highly promising candidates for next&#8208;generation technologies due to their exceptional electronic and optical properties. Among these, siloxene nanosheets have garnered significant interest for their structural versatility, facile synthesis, and intrinsic semiconducting behavior. In this study, we explore selenium doping as a strategy to modulate the optoelectronic properties of siloxene. Silicon nanosheets were synthesized via the topochemical deintercalation of a purified CaSi&#8322; phase, followed by selenium incorporation through thermal evaporation. Comprehensive structural and spectroscopic analyses confirm the successful integration of selenium atoms while preserving the 2D framework of the nanosheets. Notably, selenium doping induces a pronounced bandgap narrowing, offering a viable pathway for tuning the electronic and optical characteristics of siloxene. These findings expand the potential of silicon&#8208;based 2D materials for high&#8208;performance applications in sensing, optoelectronics, and catalysis, paving the way for their integration into advanced technological platforms.

         <title>Influence of the Substitution Pattern of Terpene&#8208;Based Seven&#8208;Membered Lactones on Yttrium&#8208;Mediated Ring&#8208;Opening Polymerization: A Kinetic and Mechanistic Investigation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
(&#8208;)&#8208;Menthide and trans (+)&#8208;carvomenthide, differing only in substitution pattern, were polymerized via ROP using a bis(phenolate) yttrium catalyst. Kinetic studies showed faster polymerization of (+)&#8208;carvomenthide but greater control with (&#8208;)&#8208;menthide. Experimental and DFT analyses revealed mechanistic differences in chain propagation, highlighting how molecular structure influences reactivity and polymerization control.








Abstract
Terpenes exhibit a wide range of structures, thus enabling diverse applications. Herein, (&#8208;)&#8208;menthide and trans (+)&#8208;carvomenthide were synthesized from terpenoids (&#8208;)&#8208;menthone and (+)&#8208;dihydrocarvone, differing solely in their substitution pattern. (&#8208;)&#8208;Menthide features a methyl group at position 4 and an isopropyl group at position 7, whereas (+)&#8208;carvomenthide shows the inverse arrangement. Both lactones were transformed into polyesters via ring&#8208;opening polymerization (ROP) using an amino&#8208;alkoxy&#8208;bis(phenolate) yttrium catalyst. Polymerization kinetics revealed first&#8208;order behavior, with (+)&#8208;carvomenthide polymerizing significantly faster than (&#8208;)&#8208;menthide, while (&#8208;)&#8208;menthide demonstrated a more controlled polymerization. Activation energies were 36.3&#160;kJ mol&#8722;1 for (+)&#8208;carvomenthide and 40.8&#160;kJ mol&#8722;1 for (&#8208;)&#8208;menthide. The Gibbs free energy of activation confirmed the lower energy barrier for (+)&#8208;carvomenthide polymerization, with experimental values of 81.9&#160;kJ mol&#8722;1 compared to 89.1&#160;kJ mol&#8722;1 for (&#8208;)&#8208;menthide. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations supported the experimental results, with computed Gibbs free energy barriers of 84.5&#160;kJ mol&#8722;1 for trans (+)&#8208;carvomenthide and 82.3&#160;kJ mol&#8722;1 for (&#8208;)&#8208;menthide and mechanistic differences. Refined free energy barriers were determined to be 102.1&#160;kJ mol&#8315;1 for (&#8208;)&#8208;menthide and 84.9&#160;kJ mol&#8315;1 for trans (+)&#8208;carvomenthide, agreeing with the experimental trend. These findings highlight the critical role of molecular structure and substituent position on polymerization kinetics and energy barriers in metal&#8208;catalyzed polymerization.

         <title>Significant Enhancement in Performance and Durability of Near&#8208;Infrared Reflective Flexible Triboelectric Nanogenerators through Surface Modification Strategy via Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although triboelectric nanogenerators (TENG) have been explored as a promising candidate for applications in multi&#8208;functional intelligent system, the realization of highly&#8208;efficient TENG that synchronously possess reasonable light transparency, high near&#8208;infrared reflectivity against solar heat gain and good mechanical flexibility, still remains challenging. Here, we present a reliable strategy that can substantially boost the performance and durability of indium tin oxide (ITO)&#8208;free transparent flexible TENG by surface modification via self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAM). Through the modification of Sb2O3/Ag/Sb2O3 electrode and polydimethylsiloxane dielectric layer with SAM of 12&#8208;(dodecylphosphonic acid)triethyl ammonium bromide and perfluorinated molecules, respectively, triboelectric charges generation is facilitated due to relatively large work&#8208;function difference between the tribolayers. The resulting flexible TENG not only afford record&#8208;breaking power density (27.28 W/m2) for ITO&#8208;free transparent flexible TENG, but also possess high durability against 5,000 cycles of bending owing to good adhesion at the SAM/substrate interfaces and high robustness of electrode. More encouragingly, the use of Sb2O3/Ag/Sb2O3 electrode endows TENG with both reasonable light transparency and high near&#8208;infrared reflectivity, which is beneficial against heat gain from solar radiation. This work showcases a promising route towards realizing transparent flexible TENG with high performance and durability, which represents a new platform for design of next&#8208;generation wearable electronics.</dc:description>

This work showcases a promising route towards realizing transparent flexible TENG with high performance and durability, which represents a new platform for design of next-generation wearable electronics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chemical valence of metal impurity in single&#8208;wall carbon nanotubes dominate their cytotoxicity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal impurities are believed to play a role in carbon nanotube (CNT) toxicity, however, redox properties of metal impurity can vary remarkably. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate whether altered chemical valence of metal impurities in CNTs elicit diverse cytotoxicity effects. Studies on this issue are scarce partly due to the technical challenges on characterizing the chemical valence of metal impurities. Herein, synchrotron radiation&#8208;based technology was applied to qualify and quantify the chemical species and valence of metal impurities in two single wall CNTs and mapping in&#8208;situ the intracellular metal distribution after CNT exposure. Surprisingly, the CNT containing a much lower amount of metal displayed significantly higher cytotoxicity compared with the higher metal one. Further analysis indicated that the CNT with lower metal content possessed higher amounts of zero valent iron (Fe0) and cobalt (Co0). Results from electron spin resonance spectroscopy further confirmed that CNT with lower metal content generated more hydroxyl radicals, which was attributed to the high amounts of Fe0and Co0. Taken together, our findings with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art synchrotron radiation technology demonstrated that the chemical valence rather than quantity of metal impurities in CNTs determine their cytotoxicity, thereby revealing a novel aspect of the cytotoxicity mechanism of CNTs.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis, Photophysical, and Chemiexcitation Properties of Luminol&#8208;Fullerene Dyads: Towards Chemiexcitation Electron Transfer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fullerene&#8208;based donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) dyads have been extensively studied for their unique electronic properties, with applications in photoinduced energy conversion devices. In these systems, dynamic quenching of the excited donor&#8217;s emission occurs, via energy or electron transfer to the fullerene acceptor. However, there are no reports on fullerene dyads bearing chemiluminescent donor analogues. In this context, the synthesis of two luminol&#8208;fullerene D&#8208;A dyads, bridged with alkyl chains of different lengths, is reported herein. The electronic communication between the two moieties was thoroughly evaluated, following either the photo&#8208; or chemi&#8208;excitation of the linked units. Steady state and time&#8208;resolved absorption studies, combined with emission techniques, were employed to monitor the deactivation fate of excited species. In general, a significant quenching of the excited luminol&#8208;derived emission signals was observed, revealing detectable intramolecular interactions between the two moieties. Unlike what is usually observed in other luminol&#8208;based D&#8208;A systems, quenching of the excited species generated upon photo&#8208; and chemi&#8208;excitation of the luminol&#8208;fullerene dyads is attributed to electron rather than energy transfer. This was found to be consistent with the estimated Gibbs energy of photoinduced electron transfer and with DFT theoretical calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Coverage&#8208; and Temperature&#8208;Dependent Rates of Metalation, Ring Fusion and Polymerization of Benzoporphyrins on Cu(111)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Using scanning&#8208;tunneling microscopy (STM), temperature&#8208;programmed desorption (TPD), X&#8208;ray photo&#173;electron spectroscopy (XPS) and density&#8208;functional theory (DFT), we have investigated metalation, ring fusion and polymerization of three different benzoporphyrins, tetraphenyl&#173;trans&#173;disbenzoporphyrin (2&#8208;Benzo), copper&#8208;tetraphenyltransdibenzo&#173;porphy&#173;rin (Cu 2&#8208;Benzo) and tetra&#173;phenyl&#173;&#173;tetra&#173;benzo&#173;porphyrin (4&#8208;Benzo), from 280 to 1000 K on Cu(111), and compare with previous data of tetraphenylporphyrin (0&#8208;Benzo) on Cu(111).
Using STM, we observe 2&#8208;Benzo to adsorb as individual, rather&#8208;immobile molecules at room tempe&#173;rature, which coalesce into elongated islands of metalated molecules at 373 K. N 1s XPS spectra confirm the metalation, and DFT&#8208;calculated structures and simulated STM images confirm the appearance in STM. Upon further heating to 398 K, the islands become rough and irregularly shaped, before completely dissolving at 423 K, most likely related to intramolecular ring fusion. Heating to 950 K leads to complete polymerization and a rough structure on the surface.
Using H2 TPD, we follow the coverage&#8208;dependent rates of metalation, ring fusion and polymerization for all four molecules. The metalation rate is found to correlate with, sometimes abrupt, changes in the adsorption structures, whereas the rates of ring fusion and polymerization decrease gradually with increasing coverage, for all molecules.</dc:description>

         <title>Accessing Single&#8208;Molecule Properties of Heptacene Using a Metal&#8208;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Acenes, classic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons composed of linearly fused benzene rings, represent a model system for exploring the physical properties of one&#8208;dimensional &#960;&#8208;conjugated structures. Isolating individual molecules at the single&#8208;molecule level provides a means to investigate their intrinsic properties, which is typically done by dissolving in solutions. However, this approach becomes increasingly difficult to apply for higher acenes owing to their high insolubility and instability. Thus, the electronic structure of higher acenes has long been a subject of intense discussion. This paper introduces a method to encapsulate heptacene within a metal&#8208;organic framework through in situ photochemical conversion of a precursor molecule. The transformation reaction of the precursor is significantly accelerated upon inclusion. This approach stabilizes otherwise unstable heptacene by suppressing undesirable side reactions through the spatial constraint. The bulk production of heptacene in an isolated state enables its exploration through various analytical techniques, providing insights into its single&#8208;molecule properties and leading to the first observation of its fluorescence. Moreover, experimental and theoretical studies reveal the electronic ground state of pristine heptacene.</dc:description>

         <title>Competition between Photoswitching and Fluorescence in Hemiindigos and Hemithioindigos</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of functionalized HIs and hemithioindigos (HTIs) were synthesized and studied for their potential applications as IFPSs. The investigation revealed that ortho&#8208;OH&#8208;substituted derivatives exhibit high fluorescence quantum yields while concurrently retaining significant photoswitching capabilities, high photostability, and fast recovery.








Abstract
Intrinsically fluorescent photoswitches (IFPSs) are crucial for super&#8208;resolution microscopy techniques. This study explores the impact of substituents on fluorescence and photoswitching efficiency in hemiindigos (HIs) and hemithioindigos. A series of functionalized derivatives &#160;was synthesized by one&#8208;step Knoevenagel condensations using a sustainable mechanochemical approach and characterized across various environments. Ortho&#8208;OH&#8208;substituted hemiindigo derivatives exhibited high fluorescence quantum yields (&#934;FL&#160;=&#160;0.65) while retaining significant photoswitching capabilities (&#934;Z&#8594;E&#160;=&#160;0.29 in THF) and fast recovery. These enhanced properties are attributed to the &#960;&#8208;electron&#8208;donating characteristics of the OH substituents and the presence of intramolecular hydrogen bonds. The results of CC2 ab initio calculations revealed a detailed photoswitching mechanism: (1) initial population of the fluorescent &#960;&#960;* singlet excited state minimum, (2) subsequent elongation of the C&#9552;O bond leading to depopulation of the &#960;&#960;* state to the n&#960;* excited state minimum, (3) twisting of the double bond within the n&#960;* state, and (4) relaxation to the ground electronic state via a conical intersection. The analysis of the potential&#8208;energy surfaces modulated by EDG substituents, both in the &#960;&#960;* and n&#960;* excited states, provides insights into the structure&#8208;property relationships of IFPSs, guiding future rational design.

         <title>Solid&#8208;State Photochemistry in Resonant Acoustic Mixers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bringing light to solid&#8208;state photochemistry &#8211; We introduce the first photochemical reaction using a resonant acoustic mixer (RAM), eliminating the need for milling media. This innovative, solvent&#8208;free approach enables scalable photochemistry under UVC light. Therefore, we designed and compared two custom&#8208;made photoreactors, paving the way for greener, more efficient photochemical reactions.








Abstract
Herein, we developed the first photochemical reaction set&#8208;up under solid&#8208;state conditions using a resonant acoustic mixer (RAM), a novel mechanochemical methodology that eliminates the need for milling media. This innovation outscores previous approaches in the ball mill under avoidance of milling balls and their related disadvantages. Further, it enables the facile performance and upscaling of photochemical reactions up to a factor of 10. We investigate the influences of liquid and solid additives on the rheology and performance of two model reactions and demonstrate and compare the efficiency and applicability of two custom&#8208;designed photoreactors.

         <title>N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Stabilized Bisacylgermylenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We developed a metal&#8208;free strategy for acyl group abstraction, enabling access to novel germenolates 2a,b, or NHC&#8208;stabilized bisacylgermylenes 4a,b. This novel class of germylenes exhibit nucleophilic reactivity toward iron and boron electrophiles, and can alternatively be prepared by the reaction of dichlorobisacylgermane and geminal bisgermenolate at low temperature.








Abstract
In this contribution, a metal&#8208;free synthetic approach toward isolable bisacylgermylenes, a novel class of germylenes, is described. Starting from tetra(2,4,6&#8208;trimethylbenzoyl)germane 1 and bromo&#8208;tris(2,4,6&#8208;trimethylbenzoyl)germane 3, we demonstrate that simple treatment with NHCs leads to two distinct types of reactivity: acyl abstraction and germylene stabilization. Reaction of 1 with NHCs produces imidazolium&#8208;substituted germenolates 2a,b via a hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) mechanism. In contrast, compound 3 undergoes stepwise substitution to afford isolable NHC&#8208;stabilized bisacylgermylenes 4a,b, which were structurally characterized by NMR and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. The UV/Vis spectra of 4a,b show two absorption bands in the visible region of the light, which do not overlap and have different characters. Reactivity studies revealed its nucleophilic character and resulted in the formation of several germylene/iron and germylene/boron complexes. The removal of the NHC at room temperature with triphenylborane leads to a degradation, mainly based on the instability of the unstabilized bisacylgermylene. To determine its reactivity, an alternative synthetic strategy was developed based on the reaction of the geminal bisgermenolates 7 with the bischloro&#8208;bis(2,4,6&#8208;trimethylbenzoyl)&#8208;germane 9. Trapping reactions with NHCs results in the formation of 4a,b in near quantitative yields. This work expands the synthetic scope of main group low&#8208;valent chemistry and introduces germylenes with tunable reactivity.

         <title>A Shape&#8208;Complementarity Approach to Inducing Short Au(III)&#183;&#183;&#183;Au(III) Contacts in Tetracyanoaurate(III) Salts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In a series of tetracyanoaurate(III) salts, careful consideration of cation shape &#8212; with the goal of shape&#8208;complementary crystal packing &#8212; can allow for the assembly of [Au(CN)4]&#8722; anions to be controlled, and in some cases Au(III)&#183;&#183;&#183;Au(III) aurophilic interactions to be rationally accessed.








Abstract
Six sets of tetracyanoaurate(III) salts were synthesized and structurally characterized using the metal&#8208;ligand complex cations [RE(bipyO2)4]3+ (RE&#160;=&#160;Sc, Y, La; bipyO2&#160;=&#160;2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine&#8208;N,N&#8217;&#8208;dioxide), [Fe(bipyO2)3]3+, [Ln(dmbipyO2)4]3+ (Ln&#160;=&#160;Ce, Eu, Yb; dmbipyO2&#160;=&#160;4,4&#8242;&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine&#8208;N,N&#8217;&#8208;dioxide), [Ca(tcmc)]2+ (tcmc&#160;=&#160;1,4,7,10&#8208;tetrakis&#8208;(carbamoylmethyl)&#8208;1,4,7,10&#8208;tetraazacyclododecane), and [Ca(12&#8208;crown&#8208;4)2]2+. Noncovalent assembly of the [Au(CN)4]&#8722; anions tended to occur via Au&#183;&#183;&#183;Ncyano interactions; however, rare Au(III)&#183;&#183;&#183;Au(III) contacts between the [Au(CN)4]&#8722; groups &#8212; suggesting aurophilicity &#8212; could be induced when certain cation shape requirements were met. Specifically, cations with shape, size, and symmetry that allowed for packing in a complementary fashion with Au(III)&#183;&#183;&#183;Au(III) aligned [Au(CN)4]&#8722; dimers or trimers &#8212; providing efficiently close&#8208;packed layers &#8212; were found to be sufficient for manifesting Au(III)&#183;&#183;&#183;Au(III) contacts. Modifying the [RE(bipyO2)4]3+ cation with peripheral methyl groups (the [Ln(dmbipyO2)4]3+ cation) caused isoreticular replacement of a {[Au(CN)4]3}3&#8722; trimer with a dumbbell&#8208;shaped {[Au(CN)4]2Cl}3&#8722; tri&#8208;anion featuring an unusual Au&#183;&#183;&#183;Cl&#183;&#183;&#183;Au bridge &#8212; illustrating that the assembly of the anionic groups will adapt to conserve the same close packing. Au(III) aurophilicity between the [Au(CN)4]&#8722; groups was studied using computational methods, crystal packing of the structures was probed using Hirshfeld surface analysis, and the emission properties of compounds containing the [Eu(dmbipyO2)4]3+ luminophore were investigated, showing high quantum yields of ca. 50%.

         <title>Fine&#8208;tuning the Photochemistry of Sulfur&#8208;Based Linkages with Ruthenium(II) Polypyridyl Complexes for Optimal PACT Application</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The thioether&#8208;based monodentate ligands are reported to be efficient photoreleased groups from Ru(II)&#8208;photocages designed for photoactivated chemotherapy (PACT). However, the direct comparison and systematic studies of the photochemical behavior of sulfur linkages of varied electronic/oxidation states, i.e., sulfoxides, thioethers, or thiols coordinated with Ru(II)&#8208;polypyridyls, remain unexplored. To delve into the intricate photophysics and photochemistry of Ru(II)&#8208;S linkages, two Ru(II)&#8208;polypyridyls: [Ru(ttpy)(phen)(DMSO)](PF6)2 [1](PF6)2, [Ru(ttpy)(phen)(DAS)](PF6)2 [2](PF6)2, [ttpy = 4&#8242;&#8208;tolyl&#8208;2,2&#8242;:6&#8242;,2&#8243;&#8208;terpyridine, phen = 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline, DAS = diallyl sulfide, DMSO = dimethyl sulfoxide] were synthesized. Here, we used DMSO for the typical sulfoxide linkage, while DAS a biologically potent phytochemical, probed as a thioether linkage with Ru(II). The photosolvolysis monitored by UV&#8722;vis and 1H NMR studies with white LED in MeCN indicated slower substitution of DMSO than DAS. The water&#8208;soluble [1](NO3)2 and [2](NO3)2 exhibit facile photorelease of DAS than DMSO from {Ru(ttpy)(phen)}2+&#8208;photocages in water. The cytotoxicity and photocytotoxicity studies with HeLa and Caco2 cells show that [2](PF6)2 and [2](NO3)2 were more photocytotoxic with higher photoindices compared to [1](PF6)2 and [1](NO3)2. This apparently led to the conclusion that markedly facile photorelease of DAS resulted in higher photocytotoxicity of the DAS&#8208;based complexes. Therefore, thioether&#8208;based Ru(II)&#8208;polypyridyls portray better options for photocaging of prodrugs and PACT applications.</dc:description>

However, the direct comparison and systematic studies of the photochemical behavior of sulfur linkages of varied electronic/oxidation states, i.e., sulfoxides, thioethers, or thiols coordinated with Ru(II)-polypyridyls, remain unexplored. To delve into the intricate photophysics and photochemistry of Ru(II)-S linkages, two Ru(II)-polypyridyls: [Ru(ttpy)(phen)(DMSO)](PF6)2 [1](PF6)2, [Ru(ttpy)(phen)(DAS)](PF6)2 [2](PF6)2, [ttpy = 4&#8242;-tolyl-2,2&#8242;:6&#8242;,2&#8243;-terpyridine, phen = 1,10-phenanthroline, DAS = diallyl sulfide, DMSO = dimethyl sulfoxide] were synthesized. Here, we used DMSO for the typical sulfoxide linkage, while DAS a biologically potent phytochemical, probed as a thioether linkage with Ru(II). The photosolvolysis monitored by UV&#8722;vis and 1H NMR studies with white LED in MeCN indicated slower substitution of DMSO than DAS. The water-soluble [1](NO3)2 and [2](NO3)2 exhibit facile photorelease of DAS than DMSO from {Ru(ttpy)(phen)}2+-photocages in water. The cytotoxicity and photocytotoxicity studies with HeLa and Caco2 cells show that [2](PF6)2 and [2](NO3)2 were more photocytotoxic with higher photoindices compared to [1](PF6)2 and [1](NO3)2. This apparently led to the conclusion that markedly facile photorelease of DAS resulted in higher photocytotoxicity of the DAS-based complexes. Therefore, thioether-based Ru(II)-polypyridyls portray better options for photocaging of prodrugs and PACT applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Light&#8208;Activated Molecules Targeting G&#8208;Quadruplex Nucleic Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Phototherapies harness light&#8217;s spatial and temporal precision to noninvasively modulate biomolecular interactions, providing a powerful platform for precision oncology. This approach is particularly effective in targeting disease&#8208;associated molecular structures such as G&#8208;quadruplexes (G4s), noncanonical nucleic acid conformations found in oncogene promoters and telomeres. These unique structures can impede DNA polymerase progression along the duplex, triggering DNA damage that ultimately compromises genomic stability. Stabilizing G4s with tailored ligands is currently being explored as a promising anticancer strategy, as it may induce toxic DNA damage specifically in rapidly dividing cancer cells. Unlike conventional G4 ligands, which remain continuously active, newly developed light&#8208;responsive molecules incorporate an OFF&#8211;ON switching mechanism that allows for spatiotemporal control over G4 dynamics and phototherapeutic effects. This concept article reviews a diverse array of light&#8208;responsive molecular tools, including photosensitizers (PSs), photocages, photochemically transformed ligands, and photoswitches, that selectively modulate G4&#8208;interactive binding properties, thereby laying the foundation for a versatile photopharmacological platform. Additionally, the article highlights recent advancements in this rapidly evolving field and discusses the challenges that remain for clinical translation, underscoring the significant potential of G4&#8208;targeted phototherapies to shape next&#8208;generation cancer treatments.</dc:description>

         <title>Fluorenyl Cations: Synthesis and Reactivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This review covers the history of fluorenyl cations from Deno&#8217;s first report in 1954 on the parent fluorenyl cation to the present. The parent cation and most derivatives have only been observed as a fleeting species by mass spectrometry, UV/Vis spectroscopy, IR spectroscopy, or NMR spectroscopy. The most common synthetic routes to fluorenyl cations are by dihydroxylation and halide abstraction of substituted fluorenyl precursors. Over the 71 year history, many advancements have been made with recent developments leading to isolable species including two characterized by X&#8208;ray diffraction. The scope of this review covers the field of fluorenyl cations in addition to related species with different aromatic groups in place of benzene fused to the cycopentadienyl core.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamics of Ligand and Guest in 1D Hg(II)&#8208;Bispidine Coordination Polymers with Different Topologies Investigated by Solid&#8208;State NMR</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>1D coordination polymers (CPs) made of parallel, weakly interacting chains have been recently proposed for the selective adsorption of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), one of the main sources of air and water pollution. Since the efficiency of adsorption for VOC removal strongly depends on the specific and stable interactions between the volatile species and the CP framework, the characterization at the atomic level of host&#8208;guest interactions and guest dynamics is of particular interest. Here, low&#8208; and high&#8208;resolution solid&#8208;state NMR experiments were applied to acquire information on ligand and guest dynamics for two 1D CPs (1&#8208;ClBz and 2&#8208;ClBz), both containing a bispidine organic ligand, Hg(II) as metal center, and chlorobenzene trapped within the framework, but featuring different topologies. By combining analyses of on resonance 1H free induction decays, 1H and 13C longitudinal relaxation times, and 2H quadrupole echo spectra, it was found that chlorobenzene undergoes fast dynamics, mainly isotropic, in 1&#8208;ClBz, while it shows slower anisotropic motions in 2&#8208;ClBz, indicating stronger interactions between framework and adsorbate in the latter associated to the lower available free volume. Ligands are quite rigid for both CPs in the investigated frequency scale, apart from methyl groups, which undergo fast motions about their ternary symmetry axes.</dc:description>

         <title>Recent Progress and Development Trends in the Research and Application of Anti&#8208;Icing Coatings</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review explores the anti&#8208;icing capabilities and mechanisms of superhydrophobic coatings, super&#8208;slippery coatings (SLIPS), and energy conversion coatings based on their chemical nature. It also encapsulates the development of both monofunctional and multifunctional coatings in anti&#8208;icing applications, evaluates their respective advantages and disadvantages, and delves into the future outlook as well as potential problem&#8208;solving approaches.








Abstract
Annual global economic losses from equipment icing exceed USD 180 billion, with indirect losses being even harder to quantify. Coatings are a highly effective method for preventing equipment from freezing. This paper reviews the research progress of anti&#8208;icing coatings and analyzes future development trends. It evaluates the anti&#8208;icing capabilities of superhydrophobic coatings, slippery liquid&#8208;infused porous surfaces (SLIPS), and energy&#8208;conversion coatings based on their material characteristics and anti&#8208;icing mechanisms. Furthermore, the paper examines the anti&#8208;icing applications of single&#8208;and multifunctional coatings, assesses the advantages and disadvantages of their preparation technologies and material properties, and identifies the main problems in practical applications of current anti&#8208;icing coatings. Finally, it highlights the potential of active anti&#8208;icing functional coatings, particularly energy&#8208;conversion coatings. Through interdisciplinary material innovation and technological exploration, these coatings could enable all&#8208;weather and sustainable anti&#8208;icing solutions.

         <title>Dual Organic Solvents Enable Stable Zn Anodes via Simultaneous Electrolyte Structure and Interface Chemistry Regulation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stable Zn plating/stripping process can be achieved by simultaneous optimization of bulk electrolyte structures and anode&#8208;electrolyte interfacial chemistry in a hydrous dual organic electrolyte system, using Zn(OTf)2 dissolved in DME and DX.








Abstract
Metallic Zn is an exceptionally promising anode material for aqueous batteries due to its inherent safety, low cost, and high theoretical capacity. However, its widespread application has been severely limited by persistent challenges, including water&#8208;induced parasitic reactions and uncontrolled dendritic growth. Herein, a hydrous dual organic electrolyte system with modulated bulk electrolyte structures and anode&#8208;electrolyte interfacial chemistry has been developed to address the above obstacles, featuring Zn trifluoromethanesulfonate (Zn(OTf)2) dissolved in 1,2&#8208;dimethoxyethane (DME) and 1,4&#8208;dioxane (DX). In such a system, DME can effectively disrupt the hydrogen bond network of water molecules through its electron&#8208;donating properties, thereby significantly suppressing water activity and associated side reactions, while DX preferentially adsorbs at the anode/electrolyte interface to facilitate Zn2+ desolvation and promote the preferential growth of (002)&#8208;oriented Zn crystals. The optimized electrolyte system endows Zn anodes with exceptional electrochemical performance, demonstrating unprecedented cycling stability (4000 hours at 1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2/1 mAh cm&#8722;2) in the Zn//Zn cell and outstanding Coulombic efficiency (CE) (99.8% over 2000 cycles) in the Zn//Cu cell. Moreover, the full battery paired with Na2V6O16 (NVO)demonstrates excellent cycling stability with 79.0% capacity retention at 5 A g&#8722;1 after 2000 cycles.

         <title>In Situ Construction of RuS2&#8208;MoO3/MoS2 Heterostructure for Efficient Hydrogen Evolution in Alkaline Media</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The RuS2&#8208;MoO3/MoS2 material with enriched heterostructures was successfully prepared through simple hydrothermal and sulfidation approach. This heterostructure enhances the activity of RuS2 for alkaline HER to charged interactions between RuS2 and MoO3/MoS2 with accelerating the rate of water dissociation. It achieves 51 mV overpotential at 10 mA cm&#8722;2 and Tafel slope of 46 mV dec&#8722;1.








Abstract
The investigation of an electrocatalyst that integrates both high activity and cost&#8208;effectiveness to enhance the sluggish kinetics of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) during water reduction constitutes a significant scientific challenge. Herein, we present an electrocatalyst that RuS2 nanoparticles were uniformly dispersed onto MoO3/MoS2 nanosheets support to obtain abundant heterojunction interfaces of RuS2&#8208;MoO3/MoS2 for efficient HER. It enhanced the activity of RuS2 for alkaline HER to charged interactions between RuS2 and MoO3/MoS2 with accelerating the rate of water dissociation and optimizing the reaction kinetics. RuS2&#8208;MoO3/MoS2 heterostructure exhibits excellent electrocatalytic performance for alkaline HER, showing a low overpotential of only 51&#160;mV at current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and a low Tafel slope of 46&#160;mV dec&#8722;1, outperforming commercial Pt/C and most previously reported alkaline HER electrocatalysts. Moreover, it also has outstanding long&#8208;term stability, capable of maintaining current densities of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for durations exceeding 500 hours and 100 hours under the chronoamperometric method, respectively. This research offers novel insights and clear guidance for the development of high&#8208;performance, cost&#8208;effective RuS2 electrocatalysts.

         <title>Selective and Waste&#8208;Free Isolation of High Purity Primary Amines from Amine and Reaction Mixtures by Selective Ammonium Carbamate Crystallization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesizing primary amines either leads to a challenging separation from secondary and tertiary amine side products or a separation of the desired product from a selective homogeneous catalyst. This work presents an efficient isolation strategy based on CO2&#8208;induced waste&#8208;free and reversible salt formation combined with selective crystallization.








Abstract
The isolation of primary amines from secondary and tertiary amines presents a significant challenge in their sustainable production, and existing strategies are either multistep, energy&#8208;demanding, or waste&#8208;intensive. We present an efficient process that utilizes the distinct solubility profiles of ammonium carbamate species formed through waste&#8208;free and reversible salt formation of primary amines and CO2. This selective ammonium carbamate crystallization (SACC) enables the purification of challenging amine mixtures. Starting from 35% initial primary amine purity, SACC achieves very high isolated yields of up to 94% and excellent purities exceeding 99%. Additionally, the separation of secondary from tertiary amines with 86% yield and 91% purity and the fractional crystallization of primary, secondary, and tertiary amines with yields ranging from 83% to 94% and purities from 90% to&#160;&gt;&#160;99% were successfully achieved. SACC was also successfully employed in the alcohol amination with ammonia/ammonia alkylation to isolate primary amines with high yields of up to 84% and excellent purities exceeding 99% using a homogeneous Ru/xantphos catalyst system. The observed average metal and phosphorus losses were at a minimal level of&#160;&lt;&#160;1&#160;wt% of the initial amounts. Based on this high catalyst retention, the additional potential of SACC for recycling the homogeneous catalyst was demonstrated.

         <title>Computational Study on the Relationship between Charge Localization and Second Hyperpolarizability in Mixed&#8208;Valence Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular systems with symmetric resonance structures with invertible polarization (SRIP) have been reported to exhibit negative second hyperpolarizability, which is unusual for ordinal molecular systems. We herein report that mixed&#8208;valance systems can also be recognized as SRIP systems showing negative second hyperpolarizability. Since electronic structures of MV systems are often represented by the Robin&#8211;Day classification, we theoretically investigated the correlation between the Robin&#8211;Day class and second hyperpolarizability &#947; in simple MV systems such as He2&#183;+ and biaryl derivatives. We found that the absolute value of &#947; increases and its sign reverses near the boundary of the Robin&#8211;Day class&#8208;III and II, where the charge begins to localize. The significant validation of &#947; was rationalized by the context of the intervalence charge transfer (IVCT) transitions, which are unique to MV systems. The calculated &#947; for MV systems is more than 100 times larger in absolute value than in the neutral state near the charge localization boundary, and the sign of &#947; switches at the class&#8208;II/III boundary. These results suggest that the nonlinear optical response of materials can be significantly switched by redox stimuli.</dc:description>

         <title>Rapid and&#160;Efficient&#160;Solid&#8208;state Mechanosynthesis of Bipyridine Metal Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>2,2'&#8208;bipyridine is considered to be the most widely used&#160;ligand and it has been extensively studied especially in the areas of coordination chemistry, medicine, materials and catalysis. A mechanochemical reaction is a process that involves the application of mechanical energy and it provides a high yield in a shorter reaction time and eliminates the need for bulk solvents, typically request in solvothermal reaction.
Notwithstanding the importance of the synthesis of bipyridine&#8208;metal compounds for several decades and recent advancements in the mechanochemical synthesis the development of a mechanochemical protocol for the synthesis of metal complexes bearing bipyridine remains unexplored.
In this work, we extensively studied the mechanochemistry reaction of more than ten metallic precursors of Ru, Ir, Pt, Pd, Fe, and Co with 2,2'&#8208;bipyridine in different stoichiometric ratio without utilization of bulk solvents, under ambient conditions and without air&#8208;sensitive procedures. A comparison of the yield, reaction time, temperature, frequency, green metrics (E&#8208;factor and the Effective Mass Yield (EMY)) of conventional solvothermal methodologies and mechanochemical synthesis clearly indicates that the mechanochemical approach is more sustainable and efficient. Mechanochemistry approach can be complementary to common solvothermal approach, and in the future, it will be required greater attention in the field of organometallic chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Strategies Toward Synthesis and Conversion of Lignin Model Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The conversion of lignin toward value&#8208;added products relies on the cleavage of C&#9472;C and C&#9472;O bonding patterns, which has proven to be a difficult task previously, with numerous factors at play. The employment of model compounds which are fashioned on the structure and linkages found within lignin aids in the development of catalytic processes which can then be applied for the scission of linkages within native lignin. This review focuses on the strategies which have been used for the synthesis and conversion of key model compounds of lignin and the products obtained following their breakdown studies.








Abstract
The push toward a renewable society where the chemicals being used on a daily basis come from sources which are not going to be depleted within the next few decades is highly sought after. Biomass is one of the most promising opportunities to establish self&#8208;sustainability for the human race. This review article takes a look at some of the key methods which have been employed for the synthesis of important lignin model compounds, and the synthetic techniques are discussed throughout the first section. The second section of this review is focused on some of the major strategies for the conversion of lignin model compounds throughout the literature. This review serves as a good starting point for someone who is relatively new to the field of lignin model synthesis and valorization.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Asymmetric catalytic synthesis via DKR has proven to serve as a powerful tool for the efficient preparation of planar chiral pillar[5]arenes, which allows for achieving high levels of enantioinduction while producing a series of functionalized planar chiral pillar[5]arenes.








Abstract
Pillar[n]arenes are a class of emerging supramolecular macrocyclic hosts that have attracted significant attention due to their intriguing dynamic planar chirality and unique cavity structures. In particular, the conformation of pillar[5]arenes can be locked by the introduction of bulky substituents or &#960;&#8208;conjugated units at both rims, resulting in stable planar chirality. This strategy paves the way for the application of planar chiral pillar[5]arenes as versatile chiral molecular platforms. In recent years, planar chiral pillar[5]arenes have been widely applied in various research fields, such as chiral porous materials, chiral luminescent materials, and molecular machines. However, obtaining planar chiral pillar[5]arenes in enantiomeric forms remains a significant challenge. Recently, asymmetric catalytic synthesis via dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) has proven to serve as a powerful tool for the efficient preparation of planar chiral pillar[5]arenes, which allows for achieving high levels of enantioinduction while producing a series of functionalized planar chiral pillar[5]arenes. This concept summarizes these achievements and highlights the design principles and key challenges, aiming to provide valuable insights for future research.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly Methods Induce Different Individual&#8208;Polymer&#8208;Block Solvation Responses</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Different processing methods of the otherwise same block copolymer produce materials that respond distinctly to solvent stimuli. FLIM, which reveals changes in the tightness or looseness of individual blocks, pinpoints these distinct responses to individual&#8208;block behaviors.








Abstract
An understanding of block&#8208;specific responses to stimuli in self&#8208;assembled copolymers is essential for the effective design of responsive materials. Here, materials formed from different post&#8208;reaction processing methods of the same ROMP block copolymer exhibit different block&#8208;specific solvent responses, as characterized in situ by fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM). FLIM data were acquired by tagging the polar or nonpolar block separately with a covalently incorporated viscosity&#8208;sensitive fluorescent molecular rotor to measure the changing tightness or looseness of assembly upon changes in solvent composition. Rapid precipitation from an insoluble solvent to form a film results in tighter assembly and less difference in tightness/looseness between the two blocks. Further, it interrupts individual block&#8208;solvent response behavior. Both results indicate an apparent disruption of the core&#8211;shell assembly. This model from FLIM is further supported by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS) data from isolated solids, which show tighter long&#8208;range interactions and more long&#8208;range order in these kinetically trapped states. The experiments develop FLIM as a method for pinpointing stimuli&#8208;responsive behaviors from different processing methods to individual blocks. Together these outcomes provide a future handle for tailoring solvent&#8208;triggered assembly/disassembly behavior.

         <title>Study on Phosphorus Compound/Catechol&#8208;Catalyzed Dehydrative Amidation and Its Database Development for Machine Learning</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel phosphorus&#8208;based catalytic system for the direct amidation of carboxylic acids with amines has been developed. The efficiency of the phosphorus catalysis is substantially enhanced using catechol derivatives as additives. A vault of experimental data obtained this time was complemented with ML models, which allowed capturing the intricate catalytic behavior in the amidation system.








Abstract
Herein, we report that the catalytic activity of phosphorus compounds with a P&#9472;H bond in dehydrative amidation reactions is substantially enhanced when using catechol derivatives as additives. A systematic investigation into the catalytic activity of four phosphorus compounds and 17 catechol derivatives allowed identifying several effective combinations, for example, dimethyl phosphite and 2,3&#8208;dihydroxynaphthalene, for the catalytic amidation of carboxylic acids with amines. The developed catalytic system enables the synthesis of pharmaceuticals and facilitates the amidation of anilines, which are typically considered poor substrates with low reactivity. In addition, machine&#8208;learning (ML) models were constructed to validate the effectiveness of the database generated from the above&#8208;mentioned investigation. Multilayer perceptron (MLP) models incorporating descriptors derived from both quantum chemical calculations and RDKit provided accurate predictions while maintaining chemical interpretability, which was underscored by a visual analysis using SHAP.

         <title>Dynamic Covalent Polymer Networks of Silicone Elastomers via Organoborane Lewis&#8208;Pairs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DCPNs with reversible Lewis pair bonds are reported. Nitrogen&#8208;borane adducts impart dynamic mechanical properties, such as self&#8208;healing and recyclability, to polydimethylsiloxane elastomers.








Abstract
Dynamic covalent polymer networks (DCPNs) have been developed in recent years to offer distinctive mechanical properties and shape responsiveness in covalently cured polymer materials, thereby bestowing them with desirable characteristics such as self&#8208;healing and recyclability. To achieve these desirable properties, dynamic polymers incorporate reversible covalent bonds that enable shape morphing without causing irreversible chemical degradation of the network structure. Lewis pairs (LP), forming coordinate covalent bonds, sometimes referred to as dative covalent bonds, exhibit a broad range of bond dissociation rates and energies, making them inherently interesting for designing DCPNs. However, LPs have been relatively unexplored as polymer building blocks. Here, we present a straightforward approach to prepare LP&#8208;based polymers based on archetypical nitrogen&#8208;borane adducts with an organoborane&#8208;functionalized polydimethylsiloxane combined with commercially available Lewis base (LB) polymers. The dynamic behavior of the organoborane&#8208;functionalized system and LB polymers is investigated, demonstrating tunable reversibility in cured elastomers. The excess of LB facilitates rapid recapture and reformation of the covalent network, contributing to the system's reversible and self&#8208;healing nature. Notably, the system allows easy mixing of different LB polymers, enabling the creation of tuning the system, and hence organoborane&#8208;based LPs are demonstrated to be a promising building block for tunable DCPNs.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Carbon nanothread (CNTh) is a sp3&#8208;bonded one&#8208;dimensional nanomaterial that was predicted to combine the extreme strength with excellent flexibility. However, the reported CNTh usually has a non&#8208;uniform intrathread structure, and the synthesis of structure&#8208;specific CNTh is still a big challenge. Here, we selecte 1,2,3&#8208;trifluorobenzene (1,2,3&#8208;TFB) with strong dipole as precursor. By compressing 1,2,3&#8208;TFB to 20.1 GPa, a CNTh with a &#8220;zipper polymer&#8221; structure is obtained. Under applied pressure, 1,2,3&#8208;TFB are anti&#8208;parallelly stacked in column, and polymerize via selective sequential [4+2] polymerization between H&#8208;carbon dienophile / F&#8208;carbon dienophile and F, H&#8208;carbon diene within the column, followed by the &#8220;zippered&#8221; bonding of the rest atoms. The obtained CNTh is highly hydrophobic with contact angle of 124.6 &#176;. The excellent columnar anti&#8208;parallel &#960;&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;&#960; stacking and distinct reactivities of carbon atoms introduced by the F&#8208;substitution are responsible for the high reaction selectivity, which provides new insight for the precise synthesis of atom&#8208;level ordered CNThs.</dc:description>

         <title>Hierarchical Assemblies of Unsymmetric Pt Complexes with Ag Ions: Two Types of Assembly Modes Depending on the Remote Ancillary Groups in the Bridging Ligands</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The stepwise clusterization reactions of the (SP&#8208;4&#8208;3) and (SP&#8208;4&#8208;4) Pt complexes with Ag ions are reported. The small structural difference between the two types of Pt complexes was amplified by the hierarchical assembly process, producing different types of &#8220;cluster&#8208;of&#8208;cluster&#8221; aggregates in the crystalline state. The cluster&#8208;of&#8208;cluster complexes exhibited photoluminescence corresponding to the interaction between the Pt2Ag3 unit and Ag ions, whereas each molecular component had similar photophysical properties.








Abstract
Self&#8208;assembly via noncovalent interactions can amplify small structural differences in small molecular units, producing large supramolecular architectures with structure&#8208;dependent complexity and characteristics. In this paper, the unique self&#8208;assembly behaviors of mononuclear Pt(II) complex units accommodating Ag(I) ions are reported.

&lt;p&gt;The stepwise clusterization reactions of the (SP-4-3) and (SP-4-4) Pt complexes with Ag ions are reported. The small structural difference between the two types of Pt complexes was amplified by the hierarchical assembly process, producing different types of &#8220;cluster-of-cluster&#8221; aggregates in the crystalline state. The cluster-of-cluster complexes exhibited photoluminescence corresponding to the interaction between the Pt&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ag&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; unit and Ag ions, whereas each molecular component had similar photophysical properties.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Self-assembly via noncovalent interactions can amplify small structural differences in small molecular units, producing large supramolecular architectures with structure-dependent complexity and characteristics. In this paper, the unique self-assembly behaviors of mononuclear Pt(II) complex units accommodating Ag(I) ions are reported. The Pt complex with the N^C chelating ligand and two different kinds of pyrazole ligands gave two regioisomers, whose structural difference was only the position of the N and C donor atoms in the N^C chelating ligands. This small structural difference influences the assembled structures with Ag ions, producing two different types of heteropolynuclear complexes with different clustering motifs. This was further amplified via a hierarchical assembly process incorporating additional Ag ions to afford two different types of Pt-Ag cluster-of-cluster complexes. This study proves that the self-assembly of unsymmetrical fragments can endow significant complexity and perturbation in molecular systems, enabling the observation of unique molecular behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Real&#8208;Time Monitoring of Wheel Movement in a [2]Rotaxane Using a Competing Kinetic Pathway</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In high&#8208;polarity solvent, a [2]rotaxane formed kinetic aggregates showing blue&#8211;purple locally excited emission. The kinetic aggregates gradually transformed into thermodynamic aggregates. During the transformation, the [2]rotaxane was exposed to the aqueous conditions, thus the location of the hydrophilic pillar[5]arene wheel changed, resulting in real&#8208;time monitoring of fluorescence color change from blue&#8211;purple locally excited emission to light&#8208;blue charge&#8211;transfer emission.








Abstract
The wheel movement of rotaxanes is typically fast in solution. Therefore, real&#8208;time monitoring of such movement is one of the challenging topics. Herein, we report real&#8208;time monitoring of wheel movement in a [2]rotaxane (comprising hydrophilic pillar[5]arene as a wheel and hydrophobic &#960;&#8208;conjugated moiety with hydrophilic tetra(ethylene oxide) ends as an axle) via a competing kinetic pathway, i.e., aggregation/dissociation equilibrium. In non&#8208;aqueous solvent, the [2]rotaxane shows blue&#8211;purple locally excited emission from the &#960;&#8208;conjugated moiety because the pillar[5]arene wheel shuttles over the whole axle. In aqueous solvent, the [2]rotaxane forms aggregates owing to its amphiphilic nature. Because the [2]rotaxane forms the kinetically stable aggregates, the location of the pillar[5]arene wheel on the axle is maintained, resulting in the locally excited emission even in the aqueous conditions. Surprisingly, the emission color gradually changes from blue&#8211;purple to light blue over 720&#160;h because exposure of the monomeric [2]rotaxane generated by dissociation of the kinetically stable aggregates, to the aqueouspola environment triggers movement of the hydrophilic wheel to the hydrophobic &#960;&#8208;conjugated moiety by the hydrophobic effect. After this movement, the monomeric [2]rotaxane forms the thermodynamically stable aggregates, which exhibit light&#8208;blue emission from the charge&#8208;transfer complex between the electron&#8208;donating pillar[5]arene wheel and the electron&#8208;accepting &#960;&#8208;conjugated moiety.

         <title>From Nanoparticles to Single Crystals of Al&#8208;MOFs: Synergistic Coordination and pH Modulation, and Rapid Sorption Kinetics Assessment by Optical Calorimetry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;throughput studies were carried out to elucidate the synergistic effects of coordination modulation and pH modulation on the crystal size of different Al&#8208;MOFs, resulting in nanoparticles as well as large crystals (dmax&#160;&#8776;&#160;0.1&#160;&#181;m&#160;&#8211;&#160;800&#160;&#181;m). In addition, the influence of particle size on CO2 sorption properties was investigated, showing increasing adsorption and desorption rates with decreasing particle size.








Abstract
The properties of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), such as sorption kinetics or mechanical and chemical stability, not only depend on their composition and chemical structure, but also on their crystal size and morphology. However, the tunability of the crystallite size of aluminum&#8208;based MOFs (Al&#8208;MOFs) is still a long&#8208;standing challenge. In this study, we present systematic high&#8208;throughput investigations elucidating the synergistic effects of different mono&#8208; and dicarboxylic acids (acetic acid, malonic acid, and oxalic acid) as coordination modulators and NaOH as a pH modulator on the crystal size of various Al&#8208;MOFs, with a focus on Al&#8208;MIL&#8208;53&#8208;NO2. By varying the type and amount of coordination modulators, we successfully extended the range of achievable particle sizes to nanoparticles as well as large crystals (dmax&#160;&#8776;&#160;100&#160;nm&#160;&#8211;&#160;800&#160;&#181;m) compared to traditional synthesis methods using only coordination modulators. Thus, large crystals as well as nanoparticles of different Al&#8208;MOFs could be obtained by simply varying the molar ratio of the different modulators. Additionally, we explored the influence of particle size on CO2 sorption properties using InfraSORP technology (optical calorimetry), revealing the increase in adsorption rates with decreasing particle size.

         <title>Orthogonal Photoswitching in Nematic Liquid Crystals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Photoresponsive materials capable of orthogonal and path&#8208;independent switching are crucial for developing adaptive materials and smart technologies. In this work, we showcase a dual light&#8208;responsive nematic liquid crystalline system based on peri&#8208;anthracenethioindigo (PAT) and arylazopyrazole (AAP) doped into the liquid crystal 4&#8208;cyano&#8208;4&#8242;&#8208;pentylbiphenyl (5CB). The co&#8208;assembled supramolecular material exhibits a reversible phase transition between the nematic liquid crystalline and isotropic liquid state upon irradiation with different wavelengths of light ranging from ultraviolet to near infrared. These transformations are clearly visible using polarized optical microscopy, displaying either bright or completely dark images depending on the phase state. A key feature of this system is its ability to achieve independent and highly efficient photoisomerization of both photoswitches, ensuring orthogonality and path independence in solution as well as in the liquid crystalline phase. This orthogonal switching capability enables precise and reversible modulation of material properties, allowing sequential interconversion between multiple distinct states. Such a system represents an important proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept for future multifunctional materials that leverage light as a non&#8208;invasive external stimulus.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The ability to control the self&#8208;assembly behavior of functional molecules offers pathways for optimizing their properties and structures for targeted applications. Asymmetric perylene diimide (PDI) derivatives, bearing similar oligo(ethylene glycol) (OEG) chains and increasing numbers of hydrophobic alkyl chains were used to investigate the effects of hydrophilic and hydrophobic groups on the properties of the resulting supramolecular polymers (SMPs). Tetrahydrofuran/water (THF/H2O) mixtures were found to be an optimal system to induce the self&#8208;assembly behavior of these asymmetric PDI derivatives; the behavior of these new systems was monitored by recording ultraviolet&#8208;visible (UV/Vis) spectra and analyzing changes in absorbance intensity. Temperature&#8208;dependent UV/Vis studies yielded thermodynamic parameters for the self&#8208;assembly processes and showed a transition from an isodesmic to a cooperative assembly mechanism with an increase in the number of hydrophobic alkyl chains. Detailed transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) investigations revealed the formation of nanofiber&#8208;based supramolecular structures that exhibit a coiling tendency during their assembly process accompanied by the increase in the number (and total volume) of hydrophobic alkyl chains. Exploring these carefully tuned asymmetric PDI systems provides new opportunities to tune not only self&#8208;assembled structures, but also mechanisms of assembly.</dc:description>

         <title>BICAAC Supported Germylenes and Stannylenes: Isolation of BICAAC Stabilized Germylone and a Digermanium Species</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we have disclosed the successful isolation and spectroscopic characterization of a series of bicyclic (alkyl)(amino) carbene (Me/iPrBICAAC) complexes of GeCl2 and SnX2; [MeBICAAC&#8208;GeCl2 (1); iPrBICAAC&#8208;GeCl2 (2); MeBICAAC&#8208;SnX2 (X = Cl (3); X = Br, (4))]. The in&#8208;situ KC8 reduction of GeCl2&#183;dioxane in the presence of MeBICAAC led to the isolation of a zero&#8208;valent di&#8208;coordinated germylone [(MeBICAAC)2Ge] (5), whereas the reduction of adduct 2 afforded a trans&#8208;bent digermanium complex, [iPrBICAAC&#8594;GeGe&#8592;iPrBICAAC] (6), having a GeGe (2.3652(5) &#197; ) double bond. Additionally, complexes 3 and 4 were reacted with diironnonacarbonyl Fe2(CO)9 to produce the corresponding Sn&#8594;Fe adducts 7 and 8, respectively. Further, attempts were made to convert the MeBICAAC&#8208;Sn adducts 3 and 4 to the corresponding tin&#8208;hydride complex, by treatment with LiBH4, however, in both the attempts, uncontrolled hydrogenation occurred to give the dihydrogented MeBICAAC complex, MeBICAAC(H2) (9). The solid&#8208;state structures of compounds 1&#8208;8 have also been elucidated using single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction technique. Further, computational investigations were performed to explain the bonding situation in 3&#8208;8 that establishes the ylidone character of 5, and supports the formation of 7&#8208;8 via donation of the lone pair at Sn to the Fe center.</dc:description>

         <title>Mono&#8208; IrIII&#160;versus heterobimetallic IrIII&#8208;AuI&#160;complexes for circularly polarized luminescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fundamental rationalization of the structural&#8211;circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) activity relationship is a challenging task. Herein, a pair of enantiopure, heterobimetallic IrIII&#8211;AuI&#160;complexes&#160;IrAu&#8208;4&#160;featuring chirality&#8208;at&#8208;metal is thoroughly investigated by means of spectroscopical and computational techniques, also including spin&#8208;orbital coupling (SOC) effects. Upon resolution of the racemic mixture of the starting chloro&#8208;bridged dimer via a chiral auxiliary ligand, the complexes IrIII&#8211;AuI&#160;are straightforwardly prepared in a stepwise procedure with retention of configuration in good yields. The&#160;IrAu&#8208;4&#160;complexes display moderate orange phosphorescence arising from an admixed metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand and ligand&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (3MLCT/3LLCT) excited state and good chiroptical activity, as shown by both electronic circular dichroism (ECD) and CPL spectroscopy. A comparison between the parental mononuclear pairs&#160;&#916;&#8208;Ir(ppy)2(acac)&#160;and&#160;&#923;&#8208;Ir(ppy)2(acac)&#160;and the binuclear&#160;IrAu&#8208;4&#160;counterparts also provides interesting insights. The latter possess higher dissymmetry factor (glum) values despite the very similar ECD activity of the lower&#8208;lying&#160;1MLCT band with enantiospecific polarization bias of the light dictated by the chiral&#8208;at&#8208;metal configuration. The different nature of the emissive excited state between the two families of complexes and its implication onto the radiative rate constant and the dipolar force is tentatively accounted for the increased CPL&#8208;activity observed in&#160;IrAu&#8208;4.</dc:description>

         <title>Aryl Shift Rearrangement in Scholl&#8208;Type Reaction Toward Nanographene</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel Scholl&#8208;type reaction involving both 1,4&#8208;aryl&#8208; and 1,2&#8208;aryl shift rearrangements was discovered, converting a Z&#8208;shaped precursor into nanographene. We establish the principle of the rearrangement mechanism through thermodynamic and kinetic studies using DFT. Our findings indicate that the selection of arenium cation&#8208; or radical cation mechanisms depends on the sizes and positions of the shifting aryl groups.








Abstract
Oxidative dehydrogenation, known as Scholl reaction, is a powerful method for synthesizing many polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Sometimes, unexpected rearrangements can lead to the formation of new structures that are usually difficult to obtain. Here, we discover a novel Scholl&#8208;type reaction involving both 1,4&#8208;aryl&#8208; and 1,2&#8208;aryl shift rearrangements, resulting in the production of armchair nanographene. Additionally, we establish the principle of the rearrangement mechanism through thermodynamic and kinetic studies using density functional theory (DFT). Theoretical studies indicate that the rearrangement reaction involves both arenium cation&#8208; and radical cation mechanisms. The selection of arenium cation&#8208; or radical cation mechanisms depends on the sizes and positions of the shifting aryl groups. Large biphenyl or triphenylenyl groups undergo the arenium cation mechanism, while a small monophenyl group favors the radical cation mechanism. Our findings offer new insights into the controllable rearrangements in Scholl reaction and provide new synthetic methods for obtaining a variety of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, which are typically challenging to design.

         <title>A Ketol&#8208;Acid Reductoisomerase Inhibitor That Has Antituberculosis and Herbicidal Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
1a and 1f are potent inhibitors of ketolacid reductoisomerase (KARI). 1f has good antituberculosis activity and 1a has herbicidal activity against Brassica campestris and Amaranthus retroflexus.








Abstract
Ketol&#8208;acid reductoisomerase (KARI) is a target for the development of new biocidal agents. This is based on its essential role in branched chain amino acid biosynthesis in plants and microorganisms, and its absence in animals. The lack of success in developing KARI inhibitors as biocides may be because the inhibitors assessed to date compete directly with the substrate, 2&#8208;acetolactate (AL). As a result, effectiveness diminishes when AL accumulates in cells. Furthermore, as these inhibitors are slow binding, an organism could avoid growth slowdown by increasing KARI production. Here, we show a pyrimidinedione, 1f is a competitive but time&#8208;dependent inhibitor of AL and NADPH for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mt) KARI (Ki = 23.3&#160;nM). A crystal structure of this compound bound to the MtKARI homolog from Staphylococcus aureus (Sa), SaKARI, illustrates this dual competition. In contrast, for Oryza sativa KARI, no time&#8208;dependent inhibition by 1f is observed, though it inhibits AL competitively (146&#160;nM) and NADPH uncompetitively. Despite differences in inhibition properties, 1f has an MIC of 12.7&#160;&#181;m for MtH37Rv and inhibits Brassica campestris growth by 63% at 10&#160;mg mL&#8722;1. Therefore, KARI inhibitors that are competitive for NADPH and show no time&#8208;dependent inhibition have excellent potential as biocides.

         <title>Olefin&#8208;Catalyzed Aromatic Bromination toward Biocompatible Tyrosine Modification</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biocompatible catalysis for aromatic bromination was attained via olefin&#8208;to&#8208;aromatic ring transfer of Br+. Bifunctional cyclooctenes catalyzed the bromination of phenol derivatives, which was applicable in tyrosine modification, and realized light&#8208;gated catalysis. Such olefin catalysis was compatible with aqueous conditions, enabling the bromination of peptides, and the Lewis&#8208;base catalysis of the olefins proceeded even under acidic conditions.








Abstract
The chemical modification of biomolecules is an emerging technique for studying and manipulating biological mechanisms. Among these methods, catalysis offers advantages over stoichiometric strategies due to its ability to enhance selectivity, for example, spatiotemporal control, via catalytic turnover, and the modification of tyrosine recently attracts considerable attention due to its significant biological functions. However, catalyst&#8208;controlled aromatic halogenation is challenging under near&#8208;physiological conditions due to the lack of biocompatible catalysts, despite the potential of tyrosine bromination as an attractive biomolecular labeling technique. In this study, inspired by the bioorthogonal reactivity of cyclic olefins, we developed catalytic aromatic bromination via the transfer of a bromenium ion from olefins to aromatic substrates based on the in&#8208;situ generation of bromiranium ions as active species. Bifunctional cyclooctenes bearing a hydroxybenzyl group efficiently catalyzed the bromination of phenol derivatives, which was applicable in tyrosine modification. The substituent effects of the catalysts primarily affected the rate of the generation of bromiranium ions, which provided the kinetics enabling light&#8208;gated catalysis that could be activated in situ via the photochemical deprotection of the hydroxybenzyl group. Such olefin catalysis was compatible with aqueous conditions, enabling the bromination of peptides, and the Lewis&#8208;base catalysis of the olefins proceeded even under acidic conditions.

         <title>Pulsed Electrolysis Promotes CO2 reduction on Tin Oxide Catalyst</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The performance of electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is determined by multiple factors, including the optimization of catalysts and electrolyser, along with the electrolysis technique. Recently, pulsed electrolysis has been found to tailor the selectivity and prolong the stability of CO2RR on a variety of catalysts, with the most focus on Cu&#8208;based materials. The investigation of pulsed electrolysis on Sn&#8208;based materials remains at early stage. Herein we evaluate the CO2 reduction selectivity of tin oxide electrocatalyst under constant potential electrolysis (CPE) and pulsed potential electrolysis (PPE). Tin oxide achieves higher selectivity toward formate under PPE condition in comparison with CPE. Induced by applied potential, tin oxide catalyst undergoes obvious reconstruction and transform into the composite of Sn&#8208;SnO2 in the process of CO2 reduction under both PPE and CPE conditions. The high selectivity under PPE condition is ascribed to the formation of SnOx on the catalyst surface due to the applied anodic potential.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced Protein Photo&#8208;Stability Analysis Using SRCD in the Presence of Phospholipid SUVs</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The influence of lipid presence on the photostability of proteins was assessed using a synchrotron radiation circular dichroism UV&#8208;denaturation experiment at Diamond B23 beamline. The presence of SUVs preserves the native structure in proteins, particularly in those with a high helical content, suggesting that lipids may play a protective role against light&#8208;induced damage to proteins.








Abstract
The interaction between lipids and proteins impacts a multitude of cellular processes and may contribute to the onset of several pathologies and aging. Such processes are frequently linked to oxidative stress, whereby polyunsaturated fatty acids act as substrates for in vivo lipoxidation. The subsequent lipid peroxidation and/or isomerization is known to affect membrane organization, as well as to modify proteins and DNA, leading to functional alterations. The aim of this study was to evaluate the capacity of UV&#8208;denaturation experiments to induce lipid modification and to investigate the influence of lipid presence on the conformational stability of selected soluble model proteins. The high photon flux and brilliance of the incident beam light of Diamond Light Source B23 for sinchrotron radiation circular dichroism (SRCD) was used to induce protein denaturation. This was acheived by scanning 30 repeated consecutive SRCD spectra in the far&#8208;UV region that, being diagnostic of protein folding, enabled the estimation of the protein photostability. Our findings show that the presence of lipid vesicles (SUVs) significantly impacts the UV denaturation of proteins, preserving the native structure in proteins with a high helical content. This suggests that lipids may play a protective role against light&#8208;induced damage to proteins.

         <title>Spectroscopic Interrogation of Thiolate Hydrogen Bonding in the CO Sensor Protein CooA: Implications for Thiolate Ligation Stability and Cytochrome P450 Function</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heme proteins are important biomolecules. Proximal cysteine thiolate ligation is found both in heme enzymes such as cytochromes P450 (CYP) and regulatory proteins such as CooA, a CO sensor. The role of H&#8208;bonding to this cysteine is explored in CooA, including variants, and CYP119 using optical and paramagnetic resonance spectroscopies, which highlight key differences between these two heme systems.









Abstract
Cysteine (Cys) thiolate coordination in hemoproteins is a unique ligation motif found in enzymes and small molecule sensors. It is posited that divergence between these two functional classes of heme thiolate proteins is a result of distinct hydrogen bonding (H&#8208;bonding) interactions with the axial Cys(thiolate) ligand. To further test this hypothesis, we report a spectroscopic analysis of thiolate H&#8208;bonding in CooA, a carbon monoxide&#8208;sensing heme protein from Rhodospirillum rubrum that is known to switch between Cys75(thiolate) and histidine coordination upon reduction. We generated CooA variants with alterations at two residues, Asn42 and His77, which are postulated to influence H&#8208;bonding to Cys75 on the basis of an Fe(II) CooA structure. Using a combination of electronic absorption, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), and electron nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) spectroscopies, we identified several CooA variants that exhibit changes in thiolate donor strength and propose an H&#8208;bonding model in which Asn42 orients His77 for optimal H&#8208;bonding with Cys75 in Fe(III) CooA. Further, we spectroscopically characterize pyrrolidine&#8208;bound CYP119, a cytochrome P450, to mimic the first coordination sphere of Fe(III) CooA. Our data unequivocally show that CooA contains a stronger thiolate&#8208;Fe bond than the pyrrolidine&#8208;bound CYP119, suggesting that Cys(thiolate) H&#8208;bonding interactions in CooA are significantly weaker. These results support the hypothesis that thiolate H&#8208;bonding is a significant differentiator between the two classes of heme thiolate proteins.

         <title>Exploring the Impact of Phenanthroline&#8208;Based Glycoconjugated Ru(II) Polypyridyl Photosensitizers on Metastasis&#8208;Related Processes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel family of water&#8208;soluble, nontoxic, and phosphorescent N&#8208;glycosylated Ru(II) phenanthroline&#8208;based complexes are reported. They exhibit photoselectivity indexes ranging from 10 to 44 in PC&#8208;3 cells, while impacting cell migration and resistance to detachment after irradiation with blue light.








Abstract
Novel water&#8208;soluble, phosphorescent ruthenium(II) polypyridyl&#8208;glycoconjugates of general formula [Ru{N&#8208;(1,10&#8208;phenanthroline)}2{N&#8208;(1,10&#8208;phenanthrolin&#8208;5&#8208;yl)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;glycopyranosylamine}][Cl]2 (glycopyranosyl&#160;=&#160;D&#8208;glucopyranosyl (1), D&#8208;mannopyranosyl (2), L&#8208;rhamnopyranosyl (3), L&#8208;xylopyranosyl (4), and 2,3,4&#8208;tri&#8208;O&#8208;acetyl&#8208;L&#8208;xylopyranosyl (5)) and corresponding aglycone [Ru{N&#8208;(1,10&#8208;phenanthroline)}2{N&#8208;(1,10&#8208;phenanthrolin&#8208;5&#8208;amine)}][Cl]2 (6) have been synthesized and fully characterized. Their stability and behavior in physiological media have been assessed using ultraviolet visible spectroscopy (UV&#8208;Vis) and 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (&#185;H&#8208;NMR), revealing minor N&#8208;glycosidic cleavage and high photostability. The photocytotoxicity of the complexes has been evaluated in two different cancer (PC&#8208;3 and MCF&#8208;7) and one nontumorigenic (HFF&#8208;1) cell lines. While exhibiting no toxicity in the dark, some glycoconjugates achieve photoselectivity indexes of up to 40 upon blue&#8208;light irradiation. Remarkably, complexes 1&#8211;6 potently affect the metastatic phenotype of PC&#8208;3 cells, evidenced by the inhibition of migration in the wound healing assay and the increased resistance to trypsin detachment following photoactivation.

         <title>Chloride Double Perovskites Doped With Sb3+/Er3+ as Stable and Effective Luminescence Material in the Vis&#8208;NIR Region</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The luminescence properties of Sb3+/Er3+&#8208;doped chloride double perovskites Cs2Ag0.4Na0.6InCl6 have been investigated across 250&#8208;1600&#160;nm. Structural and spectroscopic analyses have been performed using XRD, SEM, Raman, XPS, and ToF&#8208;SIMS methods. Energy transfer from Sb3+ to Er3+ enables emission at 525, 552, 665, 805 and&#160;1540&#160;nm. The LED prototype has been &#8208; developed, demonstrating potential for optoelectronic applications.








Abstract
The luminescence properties of stable chloride double perovskites Cs2BIInCl6, where BI is 4 at.% Ag, 6 at.% Na, doped with Sb3+ and Er3+ &#160;were investigated for the first time in the 250&#8208;1600 nm region and revealed significant potential for advanced application. We employed XPS and ToF&#8208;SIMS for chemical analyses, while SEM, XRD, and Raman spectroscopy provided insights into the morphology, crystal structure, and vibrational characteristics of the samples. The crystal structures of Cs2Ag0.292Na0.708InCl6, Cs2Ag0.285Na0.715In0.971Er0.029Cl6, Cs2Ag0.16Na0.84In0.893Er0.017Sb0.09Cl6 were examined using single&#8208;crystal methods. The excited Sb3&#8314; ions emitted blue light at 450&#160;nm due to electronic absorption at sub&#8208;band gap levels, facilitating energy transfer to Er3&#8314; ions. Notably, the Er3&#8314; emitted radiation at 1540&#160;nm, a wavelength particularly useful for optical communication applications. Additionally, emissions at 525&#160;nm, 552&#160;nm, 665&#160;nm, and 805&#160;nm were observed, corresponding to f&#8208;f transitions of Er3&#8314; ions. These compelling results were supported with calculations based on the Modified Crystal Field Theory, explaining the effects of varying concentrations of Sb3&#8314; and Er3&#8314; on the crystal structure and luminescent properties.

&lt;p&gt;The luminescence properties of stable chloride double perovskites Cs&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;B&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;InCl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, where B&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; is 4 at.% Ag, 6 at.% Na, doped with Sb&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; and Er&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; &#160;were investigated for the first time in the 250-1600 nm region and revealed significant potential for advanced application. We employed XPS and ToF-SIMS for chemical analyses, while SEM, XRD, and Raman spectroscopy provided insights into the morphology, crystal structure, and vibrational characteristics of the samples. The crystal structures of Cs&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ag&lt;sub&gt;0.292&lt;/sub&gt;Na&lt;sub&gt;0.708&lt;/sub&gt;InCl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, Cs&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ag&lt;sub&gt;0.285&lt;/sub&gt;Na&lt;sub&gt;0.715&lt;/sub&gt;In&lt;sub&gt;0.971&lt;/sub&gt;Er&lt;sub&gt;0.029&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, Cs&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ag&lt;sub&gt;0.16&lt;/sub&gt;Na&lt;sub&gt;0.84&lt;/sub&gt;In&lt;sub&gt;0.893&lt;/sub&gt;Er&lt;sub&gt;0.017&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&lt;sub&gt;0.09&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; were examined using single-crystal methods. The excited Sb&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#8314; ions emitted blue light at 450&#160;nm due to electronic absorption at sub-band gap levels, facilitating energy transfer to Er&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#8314; ions. Notably, the Er&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#8314; emitted radiation at 1540&#160;nm, a wavelength particularly useful for optical communication applications. Additionally, emissions at 525&#160;nm, 552&#160;nm, 665&#160;nm, and 805&#160;nm were observed, corresponding to &lt;i&gt;f&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;f&lt;/i&gt; transitions of Er&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#8314; ions. These compelling results were supported with calculations based on the Modified Crystal Field Theory, explaining the effects of varying concentrations of Sb&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#8314; and Er&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#8314; on the crystal structure and luminescent properties.

Abstract
The synthesis and characterization of tris(N,N&#8217;&#8208;di&#8208;isopropyl&#8208;2&#8208;dimethylamido&#8208;guanidinate)molybdenum(III), Mo(iPr&#8208;GND)3 is reported. This complex expands the known scope of tris(guanidinate)M(III) complexes to include Mo, and adds to the very limited knowledge of homoleptic mononuclear Mo(III) coordination complexes. Volatility of Mo(iPr&#8208;GND)3 is demonstrated via thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), hinting at potential applications as a molecular precursor for chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and atomic layer deposition (ALD). Proof of concept aerosol&#8208;assisted CVD growth with Mo(iPr&#8208;GND)3 as a single&#8208;source precursor yielded MoCxNy films. The results indicate a potential utility for Mo(iPr&#8208;GND)3 as a volatile precursor for ALD and CVD, with prospective use as a single&#8208;source precursor for growth of molybdenum nitrides and carbonitrides.

         <title>Engineering of the Thiamine Diphosphate&#8208;Dependent JanthE for the Synthesis of Tertiary Alcohols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of chiral tertiary alcohols is in high demand. Here we investigate in detail the aldehyde&#8211;ketone cross&#8208;coupling reactions catalyzed by the promising thiamine diphosphate&#8208;dependent lyase JanthE. Focusing on both reaction parameters and engineering, we rationally develop JanthE to improve its applicability and demonstrate its evolvability and versatility for the enantioselective synthesis of sterically hindered tertiary alcohols.








Abstract
The development of (bio)catalytic methods to chiral tertiary alcohols is in demand, yet the enantioselective synthesis of tertiary alcohols with sterically hindered moieties is problematic. JanthE is a novel thiamine diphosphate&#8208;dependent enzyme that catalyzes aldehyde&#8208;ketone cross&#8208;coupling reactions with a wide range of donor and acceptor substrates. However, product formation is low and precludes large&#8208;scale production. We investigated the conversion of 2&#8208;oxobutanoate and the bulky ketone phenoxy&#8208;2&#8208;propanone to the product 2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2&#8208;methyl&#8208;1&#8208;phenoxypentan&#8208;3&#8208;one as a model reaction for the synthetic capabilities of JanthE. As the reaction design did not significantly improve the yield, we proceeded to rational protein engineering. Docking experiments identified V121, Y268, P293, Y297, and K567 in the active site as important residues for catalysis. Remarkably, the single&#8208;point variant JanthE K567S led to a fivefold increase in product formation (90% ee) compared to the wild type enzyme (93% ee). The reaction was performed at preparative scale proving the direct possibility of application. Additionally, when the reaction was extended to longer 2&#8208;oxopentanoate, the double variant Y297P_K567S showed a 5&#8208;fold increase in product formation compared to the wild type. Our results demonstrate the evolvability and versatility of JanthE for the enantioselective synthesis of sterically hindered tertiary alcohols.

         <title>Non&#8208;C2&#8208;Symmetric Complexant for Minor Actinide Separation of Actinides from Lanthanides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Since initial employment in liquid&#8211;liquid separations for minor actinides (An) from lanthanides (Ln) contained within used nuclear fuel, all previously reported examples of bis&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazinylpyridine (BTP) complexants have been C2 symmetric about the pyridine N axis. Symmetry is postulated to limit solvent access to the polar surface area of complexant topography potentially resulting in low solubility in nonpolar diluents. In this work the unsymmetric BTP, 3&#8208;(6&#8208;(5,6&#8208;bis(3&#8208;butoxyphenyl)&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazin&#8208;3&#8208;yl)pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;5,6&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazine, a polar molecule, was found to have good solubility in 1&#8208;octanol:kerosene, rapid complexation, high chemoselectivity for 241Am3+ over 154&#8211;152Eu3+, efficient decomplexation without additives, and was recyclable through multiple extractions. Liquid&#8211;liquid extraction, decomplexation, spectroscopic, and DFT calculations are presented.








Abstract
Advancements in the separation of the minor actinides (An) from the neutron&#8208;poisoning post fission lanthanides (Ln) via the partitioning and transmutation strategy are vital toward closure of the nuclear fuel cycle, decreasing dependence on fossil fuels, and minimizing the environmental impact of energy production. Recent advancements in complexant&#8208;based separations strategies have realized substantive gains in ease of synthetic access, process&#8208;relevant diluent solubility, in addition to stability in strongly acidic environments. As purposeful exploration of chemoselective chelating agents moves forward, rapid, selective, and reversible actinide binding are at the forefront. In this work, the utility of a non&#8208;C2&#8208;symmetric, bis&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazinylpyridine (BTP)&#8208;type complexant for the selective extraction of 241Am3+ over 154&#8211;152Eu3+ from simulated high&#8208;level waste is reported. High separation factors (SFs) in 1&#8208;octanol:kerosene 50:50 (v/v), equilibration within 15 minutes of contact time, decomplexation with dilute acid only, and recyclability of a discrete complexant for additional extractions were achieved. Separations, spectroscopic, and DFT calculation data supporting the observed experimental results are disclosed herein.

         <title>Electron Paramagnetic Resonance Insights into Direct Electron Transfer Between FDX1 and Elesclomol&#8208;Cu2+ complex in Cuproptosis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Copper&#8208;induced cell death, known as cuproptosis, is distinct from other forms of apoptosis. Previous studies have proposed Elesclomol (ES) as a potent cuproptosis inducer, with the mitochondrial ferredoxin protein FDX1 postulated as its primary target. However, the mechanistic details of electron transfer (ET) between Elesclomol&#8208;Cu2+ (ES&#8208;Cu2+) and FDX1 remain elusive, particularly lacking direct spectroscopic evidence. Here, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy was employed to characterize the direct ET process between FDX1 and ES&#8208;Cu2+ complexes. Comprehensive low&#8208;temperature EPR measurements validated the efficient ET from reduced FDX1 (FDX1red) to oxidized ES&#8208;Cu2+ complex both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, ES&#8208;Cu2+ complex exhibited a greater propensity for accepting electrons from FDX1 compared to free copper ions (Cu2+), demonstrating the high efficiency of ES&#8208;Cu2+ as a primary electron scavenger for FDX1 in cells. In addition, EPR power saturation experiments and molecular docking analysis indicated that FDX1 has a much higher binding affinity for ES&#8208;Cu2+ than its homologue FDX2, providing crucial insights into the functional specificity between FDX1 and FDX2. This work advances our understanding of ET processes in cuproptosis and underscores the significant potential of EPR spectroscopy in the study of important redox events in cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Ionic liquid&#8208;modified resorcinol formaldehyde resins: synthesis and applications to methylene blue removal</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two new imidazolium&#8208;functionalized resorcinol&#8208;formaldehyde resins RFs were synthesized, using butyl&#8208;methyl imidazolium resorcinate [C1C4Im][Res] as a new precursor or using a post&#8208;functionalization method. During its synthesis, [C1C4Im][Res] spontenaously co&#8208;crystallizes with resorcinol (in a 1 : 1 stoechiometry): the crystal structure shows H&#8208;bonds between resorcinol and resorcinate, and rarely observed &#960;+&#8208;&#960;&#8208; and C&#8208;H&#8208;&#960; interactions between imidazolium ring and resorcinate. New RFs presented substantial decreases of the band gap compared to unmodified RF (from 2.0 eV to 1.72 eV). The use of [C1C4Im][Res] significantly improves particle size uniformity compared to unmodified RF, whereas the post&#8208;functionalization method partially degrades their structure. As RF, the two new resins efficiently catalyse the photodegradation of the methylene blue cation, and the post&#8208;functionalised resin has excellent adsorption properties for this dye.</dc:description>

         <title>Pd&#8208;Catalyzed C(sp2)&#8722;P Cross&#8208;Coupling of Aryl Thianthrenium Salts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a Pd/Xantphos&#8208;catalyzed C(sp2)&#9472;P cross&#8208;coupling reaction of aryl thianthrenium salts with a range of organophosphorus compounds, including H&#8208;phosphonate diesters, H&#8208;phosphinate esters, and secondary phosphine oxides. This method offers several advantages, including broad functional group tolerance, scalability to gram&#8208;scale synthesis, and applicability to the late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex molecules.








Abstract
The utilization of sulfonium salts in synthesis has gained significant attention in recent years due to their easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle features and robust reactivity. Herein, we report a Pd/Xantphos&#8208;catalyzed C(sp2)&#8722;P cross&#8208;coupling reaction of aryl thianthrenium salts with organophosphorus compounds, including H&#8208;phosphonate diesters, H&#8208;phosphinate esters, and secondary phosphine oxides. This protocol tolerates an array of functional groups and is applicable to gram&#8208;scale synthesis and late&#8208;stage functionalization of complex molecules.

         <title>Push and Pull: the Impact of Amino and Nitro Substituents on Heteroleptic Cu(I) Photosensitizers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Giving or stealing: Four new heteroleptic Cu(I) complexes containing a nitro or amino group at the 5&#8208;position of the phenanthroline backbone were prepared and systematically studied. The different mesomeric and inductive effects of these substituents have a strong influence on the electrochemical and excited&#8208;state behavior as well as on the photocatalytic activity.








Abstract
This study presents the synthesis and characterization of four novel heteroleptic Cu(I) complexes incorporating nitro&#8208; and amino&#8208;substituted phenanthroline ligands. Their molecular structures, featuring a substituent at the 5&#8208;position of the phenanthroline backbone, were elucidated by X&#8208;ray crystallography and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Spectroscopic and electrochemical investigations revealed distinct mesomeric (M) and inductive (I) effects of the NO&#8322; and NH&#8322; substituents on the photophysical and electronic properties. The electron&#8208;withdrawing NO&#8322; group (&#8208;M, &#8208;I) stabilizes the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), shifts the reduction potential by&#160;+0.9&#160;V and completely quenches emission via nonradiative processes. In contrast, the electron&#8208;donating NH&#8322; group (+M, &#8208;I) induces a moderate redshift (&#8776; 25&#160;nm) in absorption and leads to long&#8208;lived, nonemissive excited states, particularly in CunNH&#8322; (29.1 &#181;s). Photocatalytic tests revealed no hydrogen evolution, but NH&#8322;&#8208;substituted complexes efficiently generated singlet oxygen (&#185;O&#8322;) with quantum yields of up to 39.8%. These findings demonstrate how small structural modifications can fundamentally alter the photophysics and catalytic behavior of Cu(I) complexes, providing valuable design principles for next&#8208;generation photosensitizers (PSs).

&lt;p&gt;This study presents the synthesis and characterization of four novel heteroleptic Cu(I) complexes incorporating nitro- and amino-substituted phenanthroline ligands. Their molecular structures, featuring a substituent at the 5-position of the phenanthroline backbone, were elucidated by X-ray crystallography and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Spectroscopic and electrochemical investigations revealed distinct mesomeric (M) and inductive (I) effects of the NO&#8322; and NH&#8322; substituents on the photophysical and electronic properties. The electron-withdrawing NO&#8322; group (-M, -I) stabilizes the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), shifts the reduction potential by&#160;+0.9&#160;V and completely quenches emission via nonradiative processes. In contrast, the electron-donating NH&#8322; group (+M, -I) induces a moderate redshift (&#8776; 25&#160;nm) in absorption and leads to long-lived, nonemissive excited states, particularly in CunNH&#8322; (29.1 &#181;s).

         <title>Investigation of the Degree of Functionalization and Colloidal Stability of Shell&#8208;by&#8208;Shell Functionalized TiO2 Nanoparticles as a Function of Different Phosphonic Acid Chain Lengths</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Shell&#8208;by&#8208;Shell structures of TiO2 nanoparticles, phosphonic acids (PAs) and sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate (SDBS) in their solid and colloidal state were studied by thermogravimetric analysis and analytical ultracentrifugation. This combination showed that agglomerates were formed whose size depended on the PA chain length. This allowed conclusions to be drawn about the efficiency of the overlap between the PA and SDBS.








Abstract
In this work, a series of Shell&#8208;by&#8208;Shell (SbS)&#8208;functionalized colloidal systems consisting of 6&#160;nm TiO2 anatase nanoparticles (NPs), one of the phosphonic acids (PAs) propylphosphonic acid (PAC3), hexylphosphonic acid (PAC6), dodecylphosphonic acid (PAC12), tetradecylphosphonic acid (PAC14), hexadecylphosphonic acid (PAC16), octadecylphosphonic acid (PAC18) and the amphiphile sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate (SDBS) were prepared, resulting in TiO2&#8208;PACX@SDBS (X&#160;=&#160;3, 6, 12, 14, 16, or 18) NPs dispersed in deionized water (DIW). During the whole functionalization process, the NPs were subjected to thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) to gain insights into their degree of functionalization and respective thermal stability. In addition, the colloidal stability of the NPs as a function of PA chain length was analyzed by analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC). By combining both TGA and AUC, it was found that the resulting hierarchical NP architectures form agglomerates, with the degree of agglomeration depending on the length of the PA used for the first&#8208;shell functionalization. This allows conclusions to be drawn about the efficiency of the overlap between the PA and the SDBS carbon chains.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Ethylene Methoxycarbonylation Using Bidentate Phosphines: How the Stereochemistry of the Ligand Affects the Catalyst's Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Within the first 50 minutes in Pd&#8208;catalyzed ethylene methoxycarbonylation, racemic pytbpx (B) outperformed meso pytbpx (B) by hindering CO coordination on the Pd&#9472;H complex producing a higher yield (99 vs. 8%), highlighting the enhanced diastereomeric effect, while dtbpx (A) exhibited the highest methanolysis energy barrier and the lowest activity (2%), emphasizing the significant built&#8208;in base effect in pytbpx (B).








Abstract
To elucidate the diastereomeric control of bidentate P&#8208;ligands in the ethylene methoxycarbonylation, a comparative and systematic experimental and computational investigation was conducted on the catalytic activity of the Pd&#8208;complexes of the racemic, meso, and epimerized LIKATphos ligands (pytbpx, B) as well as the Lucite ligand (dtbpx, A). The experimental study revealed that the racemic ligand (pytbpx, B) exhibited the highest catalytic activity, while the Lucite ligand (dtbpx, A) exhibited the lowest activity, and the meso ligand (pytbpx, B) exhibited moderate activity. This activity order follows the same trend as the CO coordination energy to the palladium hydride complex for B, while the methanolysis is the rate&#8208;limiting step with A. The enhanced catalytic activity exhibited by the chiral pytbpx (B) is attributed to the higher stability of the hydride complex and lower stability of the CO complex compared to the meso pytbpx (B). The higher activity of the Pd&#8208;complexes of pytbpx (B) over the Pd&#8208;complexes of dtbpx (A) is attributed to the built&#8208;in base effect.

         <title>Reversible Photocyclization of Imidazoleisoindole&#8208;Based Stilbene Derivative Apparently over NonTriene Form</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Imidazoleisoindole&#8208;based stilbene analogue undergoes E&#8211;Z photoisomerization and unusual photocyclization over a formal nontriene C&#9552;C&#9472;C&#9552;C&#9472;C&#9472;N structure, which is rationally supported by X&#8208;ray and DFT&#8208;based analyses. The photochemical quantum yields over 0.3 is observed for the cyclization reaction. While the hexatriene structure is assumed as a minor mesomeric form, the ground state HOMO/LUMO symmetry resembles usual diarylethenes and satisfies Woodward&#8211;Hoffmann rules for photocyclization.








Abstract
Diarylethene is one of the most extensively studied photochromic compounds due to its remarkable properties. Recently, nitrogen&#8208;based diarylethenes (DAEs) have been reported to exhibit unusual photochromic behavior. In this study, we synthesized an imidazoleisoindole&#8208;based stilbene analogue, which involves a neutral C&#9552;C&#9472;C&#9552;C&#9472;C&#9472;N framework, along with a C&#9552;C&#9472;C&#9552;C&#9472;C&#9552;N form as a minor mesomeric form. Crystal structural analysis supported the major contribution of the former form. Surprisingly, the molecule exhibited not only E&#8211;Z photoisomerization but also the photocyclization reaction with a quantum yield of 0.3. The orbital symmetry of the HOMO and LUMO around the reactive center closely resembled to that of typical DAEs and satisfied the Woodward&#8211;Hoffmann rules. Imidazolium analogue is also studied for comparison. The imidazoleisoindole&#8208;based stilbene analogue represents a novel and unusual example of photocyclization in DAEs, uncovering the importance of the symmetric feature of LUMO and HOMO around the reactive center for the photocyclization.

         <title>Oligomeric Protein Complexes Formed by Beta Amyloid Peptides and Their Molecular Associates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
RMs stabilize oligomeric A&#946; and facilitate protein complex formation with Zn2&#8314; and TDP&#8208;43. In contrast to bulk solution, where homotypic interactions dominate, the confined environment promotes prolonged interactions of A&#946; with molecular associates, enabling structural investigations using solid&#8208;state NMR.








Abstract
The aggregation and dysregulation of &#946;&#8208;amyloid (A&#946;) peptides are critical factors in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study investigates the use of reverse micelles (RMs) as a nanoscale environment to encapsulate A&#946; peptides and explore their interactions with zinc ions (Zn2&#8314;) and a TDP&#8208;43 variant, both of which are important binding partners of A&#946; peptides closely associated with neurodegenerative diseases. We demonstrate that RMs stabilize A&#946; peptides in their oligomeric form, promoting &#946;&#8208;sheet formation and enabling detailed structural studies using solid&#8208;state NMR. Our findings reveal that Zn2&#8314; induces specific conformational changes in residues E11 and E22 of A&#946; oligomers but not E3, and that the TDP&#8208;43 variant can form stable protein complex with A&#946;40, that persists even after extended incubation and sonication. A systematic comparison of the site&#8208;specific 13C chemical shifts of the A&#946;40 oligomers modulated by the interactions with Zn2&#8314;, A&#946;42, and a TDP&#8208;43 variant, revealed that A&#946;40 predominantly adopts a &#946;1&#8208;loop&#8208;&#946;2 motif. Notably, chemical state changes were mainly observed in the residues within the loop region and the charged residues of the &#946;1 region. In contrast, the hydrophobic residues of the &#946;&#8208;sheet regions were structurally unaltered upon protein complex formation.

         <title>Reactivity of &#948;&#8208;Functionalized para&#8208;Quinone Methides in Nucleophilic Addition Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electrophilic reactivities of para&#8208;quinone methides (pQMs) with functional groups at the exocyclic polarized carbon&#8208;carbon double bond were determined by photometrical monitoring the kinetics of their reactions with carbanions in DMSO at 20&#176;C. The experimental second&#8208;order rate constants k2 were evaluated by the Mayr&#8208;Patz equation, that is, the linear free energy relationship lg k2 = sN(N + E), which was leveraged to determine the electrophilicity descriptors E of the pQMs. These electrophilicity parameters E were subsequently used to successfully predict the scope of the pQM reactions with C&#8208;, H&#8208;, N&#8208;, O&#8208; and S&#8208;centered nucleophiles. Moreover, the electrophilicity parameters E correlate linearly with a linear combination of quantum&#8208;chemically calculated methyl anion affinities (MAAs) and buried volumes (%Vbur). While MAA values mainly reflect the thermodynamic driving force of the carbon&#8208;carbon bond formation, %Vbur values take account of the variable steric effects of substituents at the electrophilic &#948;&#8208;position of the pQMs. Knowledge of MAA and %Vbur thus enables chemists to tailor novel pQMs with predictable reactivity properties.</dc:description>

         <title>Small Molecule Donor/Polymer Acceptor Organic Solar Cells with Efficiency of 13.65% Enabled by Film Formation Kinetics and Phase Separation Control</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic solar cells (OSCs) based on small molecular donor and polymer acceptor (SD/PA&#8208;type) show low photovoltaic performance due to the unideal morphology. However, previous work mainly focus on the aspects of donors, but how the polymer acceptor influences its morphology and device performances is lack of study. In this work, we apply three polymerized non&#8208;fullerene small molecules as acceptors, combining film forming kinetics and microstructure characterization to investigate the efficient SD/PA&#8208;type OSCs requirements on polymers. We found the following two results: Strong miscibility between donor and acceptor would facilitate the acceptor induce the donor to adopt a face&#8208;on packing; under the similar miscibility, the inferior crystallinity of acceptor facilitates a more proper phase separation. Hence, the DTBDT&#8208;C3&#8208;D6:PY2S&#8208;F&#8208;based SD/PA&#8208;type OSCs with the best miscibility achieves an impressive PCE of 13.65% with both high short&#8208;circuit current density (Jsc) of 20.73 mA cm&#8208;2&#160;and fill factor (FF) of 72.93%, which are among the highest values in the reported binary SD/PA&#8208;type OSCs so far. Our work provides a new perspective for the development of highly efficient SD/PA&#8208;type OSCs with polymer acceptor matched to small molecule donor.</dc:description>
         <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Organic solar cells (OSCs) based on small molecular donor and polymer acceptor (SD/PA-type) show low photovoltaic performance due to the unideal morphology. However, previous work mainly focus on the aspects of donors, but how the polymer acceptor influences its morphology and device performances is lack of study. In this work, we apply three polymerized non-fullerene small molecules as acceptors, combining film forming kinetics and microstructure characterization to investigate the efficient SD/PA-type OSCs requirements on polymers. We found the following two results: Strong miscibility between donor and acceptor would facilitate the acceptor induce the donor to adopt a face-on packing; under the similar miscibility, the inferior crystallinity of acceptor facilitates a more proper phase separation. Hence, the DTBDT-C3-D6:PY2S-F-based SD/PA-type OSCs with the best miscibility achieves an impressive PCE of 13.65% with both high short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 20.73 mA cm-2&#160;and fill factor (FF) of 72.93%, which are among the highest values in the reported binary SD/PA-type OSCs so far. Our work provides a new perspective for the development of highly efficient SD/PA-type OSCs with polymer acceptor matched to small molecule donor.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Perspectives of Soft Lattice Halide Perovskite Photocatalysts, Mechanisms and Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal halide perovskites (MHPs) have shown significant promise in the realm of photocatalysis due to their distinctive optical and electrical properties. In this Perspective, we review the latest advancements in MHPs for photocatalysis, summarizing common modification methods aimed at enhancing photocatalytic efficiency and stability. We then highlight the changes in lattice and band structures exhibited by MHPs before and after photoexcitation, with a particular focus on the intricate and varied transformations observed in LFPMs. By emphasizing the importance of these lattice and band changes, we demonstrate how they can be leveraged to construct effective heterostructures and rationally design and synthesize novel perovskite materials with robust photocatalytic capabilities. We hope that this Perspective can offer researchers new insights into MHPs photocatalysis and advance the application of LFPMs in the field of photocatalysis.</dc:description>

         <title>Continuous Light&#8208;Induced Water Oxidation In Polyoxometalate&#8208;Based Photocatalytic Protocells And Prototissues</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The bottom&#8208;up construction of leaf&#8208;like materials capable of using visible light and water to produce oxygen and chemical energy&#160;is a major goal of artificial photosynthesis. In this work, we show that robust artificial cells (protocells) prepared by&#160;the membranization of polymer/nucleotide coacervate droplets with a&#160;bio&#8208;inspired Ru&#8208;based polyoxometalate catalytic oxygen evolving center&#160;are capable of continuous&#160;light&#8208;assisted water&#160;oxidation at room temperature. We then&#160;present&#160;a method to electrostatically assemble millions of the&#160;photocatalytic protocells into tissue&#8208;like protocellular sheets and spheroids, and demonstrate that the protocellular assemblies exhibit enhanced rates of photocatalytic water oxidation compared with individual protocells. Our results highlight opportunities for synergistically integrating key aspects of photocatalysis, cytomimetics and bottom&#8208;up engineering towards the development of modular photosynthetic active matter and applications in artificial photosynthesis and energy capture.</dc:description>

         <title>Pd[B(S2O7)2]2 and Pd[B(SO4)(S2O7)]2: Two Borosulfates with Pd2+ in Cctahedral and one with Pd2+ in Square Planar Oxygen Coordination</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reaction of elemental palladium with B2O3 and SO3 at elevated temperature results in the formation of blue crystals of Pd[B(S2O7)2]2. Dependent on the reaction conditions, the compound crystallizes in two different polymorphs obtained as bulk samples. In both structures the Pd2+ cations are coordinated by six oxygen atoms in form of an almost perfect octahedron. All oxygen atoms belong to the borosulfate anions [B(S2O7)2]&#8211; and link via Pd2+ cations to an extended network structure. Within the uncommon octahedral oxygen coordination, the Pd2+ cations reveal a d8 high&#8208;spin configuration, which leads to paramagnetism. Occasionally, red crystals are formed during the reaction next to the major fraction of blue crystals of Pd[B(S2O7)2]2. Single crystal X&#8208;ray structure analysis on the red crystals reveals the sum formula Pd[B(SO4)(S2O7)]2 with Pd2+ in square&#8208;planar coordination.</dc:description>

         <title>Chemical Properties of an Aryloxenium Cation with a Triplet Electronic Ground State</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aryloxenium cations contain a formally positively&#8208;charged, monovalent oxygen atom with an incomplete electron shell. In spite of this unusual structural element, they are key intermediates in many important processes, such as biological oxidation reactions and the industrial generation of thermoplastics. However, the development of new applications is hindered by the lack of knowledge on their fundamental chemical properties. While most past studies have focused on aryloxenium cations with singlet electronic ground states, minor structural modifications can produce aryloxenium cations that have a triplet ground state. Unfortunately, examination of the reactivity of triplet aryloxenium cations is limited to just two studies that reported the detection of H atom abstraction from solvents. A detailed kinetic reactivity study involving cyclohexane, allyl iodide and dimethyl disulfide reagents is reported here for an aryloxenium cation with a triplet electronic ground state, the 2&#8208;amino&#8208;4&#8208;pyridyloxenium cation.</dc:description>

         <title>Nitroreductase&#8208;Responsive Bioorthogonal Tetrazine Conjugations in Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Prodrugs in response to tumor overexpressed enzymes offer a targeted approach for cancer therapy. However, this strategy faces several challenges, including poor water solubility, off&#8208;target effects, and tumor heterogeneity. To address these limitations, this study developed a novel class of nitroreductase&#8208;responsive tetrazine precursors by employing nitrobenzyl as a masking group for dihydrotetrazines (NBdTz), which can be further functionalized with targeting peptides. Furthermore, we have demonstrated a dual tumor&#8208;selective on demand bioorthogonal prodrug activation enabled by RGD&#8208;NBdTz. RGD promotes tumor cellular uptake by interacting with tumor&#8208;associated integrin &#945;v&#946;3, and subsequent enzymatic reduction of aromatic nitro group of NBdTz by overexpressed NTR among hypoxic tumor microenvironment leads to the liberation of the bioorthogonal handle tetrazine, resulting in the anticipated bioorthogonal activation of trans&#8208;cyclooctene caged payloads through "click&#8208;to&#8208;release" reactions. We envision the presented NBdTz enabled tumor&#8208;selective on demand tetrazine ligation offers new opportunities for cancer therapy.</dc:description>

         <title>One&#8208;Step Thermo&#8208;Mechanochemical Syntheses of Metal Phthalocyanines and Polyphthalocyanines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present a thermo&#8208;mechanochemical synthesis of metal phthalocyanines with varying metal centers and building blocks. The reactions were performed using a Retsch Mixer Mill 400 equipped with heating jackets, achieving quantitative yields at 120 &#176;C within 2 hours. A systematic screening of reaction parameters, including temperature, reaction time, frequency, and liquid&#8208;assisted grinding (LAG), revealed that temperature and time significantly influence the reaction outcome, as well as the use of LAG compared to neat grinding, which further enhances the yield.

         <title>Synthesis of Bistricyclic Aromatic Enes Containing Bifluorenylidene Units via Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Tandem Suzuki Coupling/Heck Cyclization Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A variety of bifluorenylidene&#8208;based bistricyclic aromatic enes (BAEs) and their derivatives have been prepared via the palladium&#8208;catalyzed Suzuki coupling/Heck cyclization tandem reaction in one pot. In the new scheme 2&#8208;bromophenyl trifluoromethanesulfonate and similar derivatives were chosen as one of reaction substrates, which could undergo tandem Suzuki coupling/Heck cyclization reaction with suitable arylboronic acid ester substrates to afford the expected BAEs and their derivatives. In the newly designed scheme, the raw materials are easier to obtain and can be applied to the synthesis of more BAEs and their derivatives.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8208;Ligand Cooperativity via &#928;&#8208;&#928; Interactions Supporting Outer&#8208;Sphere Hydride Transfer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A set of phosphine&#8208;free Ru(II)&#8208;CNC pincer complexes with benzimidazolylidene&#8208;based CNC&#8208;ligands have been synthesized and characterized which show excellent catalytic activity towards &#945;&#8208;alkylation of ketones using primary alcohols. DFT investigations revealed that these seemingly non&#8208;bifunctional complexes can operate via inner&#8208;sphere and outer&#8208;sphere mechanisms for the alcohol dehydrogenation step; however, the outer&#8208;sphere path is favored for the subsequent steps. The outer&#8208;sphere path is found to be supported by &#960;&#8208;&#960; interaction between the extended aromatic ring system of the benzimidazolylidene&#8208;based CNC&#8208;ligand and aromatic rings of the substrates in a new, unprecedented case of metal&#8208;ligand cooperativity.</dc:description>

         <title>Titanium cis&#8208;DACH Salan Catalyst for the Efficient Epoxidation of Non&#8208;Activated Olefins with Hydrogen Peroxide &#8208; Terminal&#8208;Selective Epoxidation of Multiply &#160;Unsaturated Terpenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a new generation of highly active and readily available homogeneous titanium catalysts for the epoxidation of non&#8208;activated olefins with aqueous hydrogen peroxide. Key feature is the introduction of pentafluorophenyl substituents into a salan ligand derived from cis&#8208;1,2&#8208;diaminocyclohexane (cis&#8208;DACH). Our novel salan ligand is accessible in one single step by reductive alkylation of cis&#8208;DACH with 3&#8208;(pentafluorophenyl)salicylic aldehyde. In situ com&#173;plexation with Ti(OiPr)4 of the cis&#8208;DACH salan provides the titanium catalyst which, in the presence of aqueous hydrogen peroxide, smoothly epoxidizes a broad spectrum of olefins with up to 95% yield, at a catalyst loading of 0.5 mol&#8208;% only. The achiral cis&#8208;DACH salan catalyst showed syn&#8208;selectivity (4.7:1) in the epoxidation of a chiral, racemic terminal allylic alcohol. This catalyst furthermore allows the regioselective (up to 49:1) epoxidation of the terminal double bond in multiply unsaturated terpenes such as myrcene, (S)&#8208;citronellene, and (R)&#8208;linalool. For the latter two substrates, syn/anti&#8208;selectivity of up to 9:1 was observed. Augmented syn/anti&#8208;selectivity (up to 50:1 syn, or 25:1 anti) can be induced in the epoxidation of the chiral substrates (S)&#8208;citronellene and (R)&#8208;linalool when the "matched" enantiomer of the chiral "Berkessel salalen ligand" is employed.</dc:description>

         <title>Solvatochromism and Redox Multi&#8208;Switch in a Trinuclear Cobalt(II) Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A trinuclear cobalt(II) complex incorporating the redox&#8208;active hexahydroxytriphenylene (H6HHTP) ligand was prepared and isolated in two different redox states: [CoII3(sq&#8208;sq&#8208;sq)]3+ (1) and [CoII3(cat&#8208;sq&#8208;sq)]2+ (2) (sq = semiquinone; cat = catecholate), enabled by its remarkable solvatochromic behavior. The ligand field tuning of the Co(II) centers through the ancillary ligand Me3TPA (tris(6&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;pyridylmethyl)amine) allowed accessing six reversible one&#8208;electron processes instead of only three with the parent TPA ligand, therefore increasing the range of redox&#8208;coupled magnetic and optical switching in this system. Upon reduction, the three redox processes are ligand&#8208;centered and involve the three sq&#8226;&#8208;/cat2&#8208; couples of HHTP, while we hypothesize that some of the oxidation processes may involve the Co(II) metallic species.</dc:description>

         <title>1,3&#8208; and 1,2&#8208;Zwitterionic Complexes of Donor&#8208;Acceptor Cyclopropanes in Reactions with Arylallenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The reaction of 2&#8208;arylcyclopropane&#8208;1,1&#8208;dicarboxylates (ACDC) with GaCl3 and other Lewis acids in the presence of 3&#8208;arylbuta&#8208;1,2&#8208;dienes, which acts as a trapping agent for the 1,2&#8208; or 1,3&#8208;zwitterionic intermediates being generated, has been studied. The reaction of 1,2&#8208;zwitterionic gallium complexes at low temperature has been found to give products of annulation at the phenyl substituent in the allene, 2&#8208;aryl&#8208;1&#8208;(inden&#8208;2&#8208;yl)ethylmalonates, as the main products. Only in the case of naphthylcyclopropanedicarboxylate, the formation of a polycyclic frame by annulation at both aromatic moieties occurred upon an increase in temperature to 0&#176;C. Trapping of 1,3&#8208;zwitterions, the primary intermediates of cyclopropane ring opening, by the indicated allene was most successful if catalytic amounts of GaCl3 were added directly to the reaction mixture. In this case, the reaction followed the pathway of the usual formal (3+2)&#8208;cycloaddition of 1,3&#8208;zwitterions at each of the double bonds of the allene to give the corresponding exo&#8208;methylenecyclopentane&#8208;1,1&#8208;dicarboxylates in up to 93% yields. This process occurred with the highest efficiency at the unsubstituted double bond of 3&#8208;arylbuta&#8208;1,2&#8208;diene.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>We herein developed a novel method for generating nitro radicals using sodium nitrite under electrocatalytic conditions for the first time. A series of vicinal hydroxynitro or chloronitro compounds was generated in good yields. This methodology features simple reaction setup, mild reaction conditions, and cheap electrodes, and simultaneously shows excellent functional group tolerance and broad substrate scope, enabling efficient gram&#8208;scale reactions with good to excellent yields. Besides, the EIS and CV results provided deeper insights into the reaction mechanism. Further extensions of the method have also confirmed the practicality of the strategy developed.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced Seawater Oxygen Evolution with Improved Electronic Environment of NiCoPS through Fluorine Doping</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Developing economical and robust electrocatalysts to prevent chlorine ions corrosion and improve seawater splitting efficiency is essential for seawater electrolysis. Herein, fluorine&#8208;doped nickel cobalt phospho&#8208;sulfide nanowires (F&#8208;NiCoPS NWs) were synthesized as high&#8208;performance catalysts for overall seawater splitting. The strongly electronegative F anion is favorable to build weak metal fluorine bonds, which easily break to generate highly active species of Ni/Co&#8208;hydroxides/oxyhydroxides protective layer on the electrode surface. This process effectively avoids chlorine evolution reaction (ClER)&#8208;induced dissolution, and enhances the stability of catalysts. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the electronegative fluorine affects the electronic structure of the catalyst&#8217; surface, further enhancing the adsorption energy and electronic conductivity of the reaction intermediates. F&#8208;NiCoPS with appropriate F doping significantly decreased the overpotential (228 (303) mV at 10 (100) mA cm&#8208;2) and the Tafel slope (44 mV dec&#8208;1) in alkaline seawater, and exhibited a long stability of 100 h. This work provides new insights for constructing effective, cost&#8208;efficient and non&#8208;noble metal electrocatalyst for alkaline seawater splitting.</dc:description>
