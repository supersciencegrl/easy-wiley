         <title>Spin&#8208;Spin Coupling Controls the Gas&#8208;Phase Reactivity of Aromatic &#963;&#8208;Type Triradicals</title>

Who&#8242;s first? Examination of the reactions of &#963;&#8208;type quinolinium&#8208;based triradicals with cyclohexane in the gas phase demonstrated that the radical site that is least strongly coupled to the other two radical sites reacts first, independent of the intrinsic reactivity of this radical site. Red and blue arrows indicate the most and second most reactive radical sites of the triradicals, respectively.







Abstract
Examination of the reactions of &#963;&#8208;type quinolinium&#8208;based triradicals with cyclohexane in the gas phase demonstrated that the radical site that is the least strongly coupled to the other two radical sites reacts first, independent of the intrinsic reactivity of this radical site, in contrast to related biradicals that first react at the most electron&#8208;deficient radical site. Abstraction of one or two H atoms and formation of an ion that formally corresponds to a combination of the ion and cyclohexane accompanied by elimination of a H atom (&#8220;addition&#8208;H&#8221;) were observed. In all cases except one, the most reactive radical site of the triradicals is intrinsically less reactive than the other two radical sites. The product complex of the first H atom abstraction either dissociates to give the H&#8208;atom&#8208;abstraction product and the cyclohexyl radical or the more reactive radical site in the produced biradical abstracts a H atom from the cyclohexyl radical. The monoradical product sometimes adds to cyclohexene followed by elimination of a H atom, generating the &#8220;addition&#8208;H&#8221; products. Similar reaction efficiencies were measured for three of the triradicals as for relevant monoradicals. Surprisingly, the remaining three triradicals (all containing a meta&#8208;pyridyne moiety) reacted substantially faster than the relevant monoradicals. This is likely due to the exothermic generation of a meta&#8208;pyridyne analog that has enough energy to attain the dehydrocarbon atom separation common for H&#8208;atom&#8208;abstraction transition states of protonated meta&#8208;pyridynes.

         <title>Nanostructured Manganese Oxides within a Ring&#8208;Shaped Polyoxometalate Exhibiting Unusual Oxidation Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Nanosized manganese oxides have recently received considerable attention for their synthesis, structures, and potential applications. Although various synthetic methods have been developed, precise synthesis of novel nanostructured manganese oxides are still challenging. In this study, using a structurally defined nanosized cavity inside a ring&#8208;shaped polyoxometalate, we succeeded in synthesizing two types of discrete 18 and 20 nuclear nanostructured manganese oxides,  Mn18  and  Mn20  , respectively. In particular,  Mn18  showed much higher catalytic activity than other manganese oxides for the oxygenation of alkylarenes including electron&#8208;deficient ones, and the reaction proceeded through a unique reaction mechanism due to its unusual manganese oxide structure.</dc:description>

         <title>Micro&#8208;mesoporous carbons from cyclodextrin nanosponges enabling high capacity silicon anodes and sulfur cathodes for lithiated Si&#8208;S batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Manufactured globally on industrial scale, cyclodextrins (CD) are cyclic oligosaccharides produced by enzymatic conversion of starch. We daily use CD as unseen components of food, cosmetics, textiles and pharmaceutical excipients. The synthesis of active material composites from CD resources can enable or enlarge the effective utilization of these products in the battery industry with some economical as well as environmental benefits. New and simple strategies are here presented for the synthesis of nanostructured silicon and sulfur composite materials with carbonized hyper cross&#8208;linked CD (nanosponges) that show satisfactory performance as high capacity electrodes. For the sulfur cathode, the mesoporous carbon host strengthens the interaction with sulfur and limits polysulfide dissolution and shuttle effects. The embedding of silicon nanoparticles into the carbonized nanosponge allows to achieve high capacity and excellent cycling performance. Moreover, due to the high surface area of the silicon composite, the characteristics at the electrode/electrolyte interface dominate the overall electrochemical reversibility, opening a detailed analysis on the behavior of the material in different electrolytes. Finally, an integration of the Si/C and S/C composites is proposed to achieve a complete lithiated Si&#8208;S cell.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural and functional analysis of bacterial sulfonosphingolipids and rosette&#8208;inducing factor 2 (RIF&#8208;2) by mass spectrometry&#8208;guided isolation and total synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We analyzed the abundance of bacterial sulfonosphingolipids, including rosette&#8208;inducing (RIFs) factors, in seven bacterial prey strains using high&#8208;resolution tandem mass spectrometry (HRMS  2  ) and molecular networking (MN) within the Global Natural Product Social Molecular Networking (GNPS) web platform. Isolation and structure elucidation of six sulfonosphingolipids resembling RIFs was accomplished based on comparative MS and NMR studies. Here, we also report the first total synthesis of two RIF&#8208;2 diastereomers and one congener in 15 and eight synthetic steps, respectively. For the total synthesis of RIF&#8208;2 congeners, we employed a decarboxylative cross&#8208;coupling reaction to synthesize the necessary branched a&#8211;hydroxy fatty acids, and the Garner&#8208;aldehyde approach to generate the capnine base carrying three stereogenic centers. Bioactivity studies in the choanoflagellate  Salpingoeca rosetta  revealed that rosette inducing activity of RIFs is inhibited dose&#8208;dependently by the co&#8208;occuring sulfonosphingolipid sulfobacin D and F and that activity of RIFs is specific for isolates obtained from  Algoriphagus  .</dc:description>

         <title>H2S Dosimetry by CuO: Towards Stable Sensors by Unravelling the Underlying Solid&#8208;State Chemistry</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Copper(II)oxide and copper(II)sulfide nanostructures are prepared for a detailed investigation of the dosimetric sensing mechanism of hydrogensulfide, aiming at an improvement of the long&#8208;term stability of these sensors. Based on the received insights a long&#8208;term stability in more than 250 sensing and regeneration cycles is achieved.







Abstract
The precise detection of the toxic gas H2S requires reliable sensitivity and specificity of sensors even at minute concentrations of as low as 10&#8197;ppm, the value corresponding to typical exposure limits. CuO can be used for H2S dosimetry, based on the formation of conductive CuS and the concomitant significant increase in conductance.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Copper(II)oxide and copper(II)sulfide&lt;/b&gt; nanostructures are prepared for a detailed investigation of the dosimetric sensing mechanism of hydrogensulfide, aiming at an improvement of the long-term stability of these sensors. Based on the received insights a long-term stability in more than 250 sensing and regeneration cycles is achieved.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The precise detection of the toxic gas H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S requires reliable sensitivity and specificity of sensors even at minute concentrations of as low as 10&#8197;ppm, the value corresponding to typical exposure limits. CuO can be used for H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S dosimetry, based on the formation of conductive CuS and the concomitant significant increase in conductance. In theory, at elevated temperature the reaction is reversed and CuO is formed, ideally enabling repeated and long-term use of one sensor. Yet, the performance of CuO tends to drop upon cycling. Utilizing defined CuO nanorods we thoroughly elucidated the associated detrimental chemical changes directly on the sensors, by Raman and electron microscopy analysis of each step during sensing (CuO&#8594;CuS) and regeneration (CuS&#8594;CuO) cycles. We find the decrease in the sensing performance is mainly caused by the irreversible formation of CuSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; during regeneration. The findings allowed us to develop strategies to reduce CuSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; formation and thus to substantially maintain the sensing stability even for repeated cycles. We achieved CuO-based dosimeters possessing a response time of a few minutes only, even for 10&#8197;ppm H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S, and prolonged life-time.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>N&#8208;Aryl and N&#8208;Alkyl Carbamates from 1 Atmosphere of CO2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have isolated and analyzed the reactivity of the key intermediate 1 formed during the Zn(OAc)2/phen&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of organic carbamates starting from amines, CO2, and Si(OMe)4. The reaction mechanism was analyzed by using DFT. The catalytic system was modified and various N&#8208;aryl and N&#8208;alkyl carbamates that could be used as industrially important polyurethane raw materials were synthesized by using atmospheric CO2.







Abstract
We have successfully isolated and characterized the zinc carbamate complex (phen)Zn(OAc)(OC(=O)NHPh) (1; phen=1,10&#8208;phenanthroline), formed as an intermediate during the Zn(OAc)2/phen&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of organic carbamates from CO2, amines, and the reusable reactant Si(OMe)4. Density functional theory calculations revealed that the direct reaction of 1 with Si(OMe)4 proceeds via a five&#8208;coordinate silicon intermediate, forming organic carbamates. Based on these results, the catalytic system was improved by using Si(OMe)4 as the reaction solvent and additives like KOMe and KF, which promote the formation of the five&#8208;coordinated silicon species. This sustainable and effective method can be used to synthesize various N&#8208;aryl and N&#8208;alkyl carbamates, including industrially important polyurethane raw materials, starting from CO2 under atmospheric pressure.

         <title>Relationship Between Molecular Structure, Single crystal Packing and Self&#8208;Assembly Behavior: A Case Based on Pyrene Imide Derivatives</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of n&#8208;type organic semiconductor materials based on pyrene imide were successfully synthesized. These materials showed different self&#8208;assembly morphologies with different conjugation degree or alkyl group. Single&#8208;crystal packing revealed that the change of molecular structure would affect certain crystal lattice parameter, such as intermolecular distance, which would further result in different self&#8208;assembly morphology.







Abstract
Development of new n&#8208;type one&#8208;dimensional (1D) self&#8208;assembly nanostructure and a clear understanding of the relationship between molecular structure and self&#8208;assembly behavior are important prerequisites for further designing and optimizing organic optoelectronic nanodevice. In this article, a series of n&#8208;type organic semiconductor materials based on pyrene imide were successfully synthesized through [4+2] cycloaddition reactions and their preliminary optical and electrochemical properties were studied. The simulated HOMO&#8208;LUMO bandgaps via DFT tallied with the experimental data well. The self&#8208;assembly of these materials showed needle or fiber&#8208;like morphologies, indicating that different conjugation degree or alkyl group had significant influence on their self&#8208;assembly behaviors. Furthermore, the single&#8208;crystal packing for these molecules were analyzed and it was found out that the changes of conjugated backbone and functional group would affect certain crystal lattice parameter significantly, such as the intermolecular packing distance and crystal size etc, which would further result in different self&#8208;assembly morphology.

         <title>Incorporation of &#946;&#8208;Alanine in Cu(II) ATCUN Peptide Complexes Increases ROS Levels, DNA Cleavage and Antiproliferative Activity**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Generation of reactive oxygen species was achieved with a redox&#8208;silent Cu(II) ATCUN complex by replacing the &#945;&#8208;amino acid glycine with &#946;&#8208;alanine. Increased ROS production led to higher oxidative DNA cleavage activity. The reasons for this higher activity were elucidated via potentiometry, cyclic voltammetry, EPR, UV/VIS spectroscopy and DFT. In cytotoxicity assays, &#946;&#8208;alanine peptide complexes showed lower IC50 values in several cancer cell lines compared with the glycine analogs, which could be correlated with the amounts of Cu taken up by cells.







Abstract
Redox&#8208;active Cu(II) complexes are able to form reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the presence of oxygen and reducing agents. Recently, Faller et&#8197;al. reported that ROS generation by Cu(II) ATCUN complexes is not as high as assumed for decades. High complex stability results in silencing of the Cu(II)/Cu(I) redox cycle and therefore leads to low ROS generation. In this work, we demonstrate that an exchange of the &#945;&#8208;amino acid Gly with the &#946;&#8208;amino acid &#946;&#8208;Ala at position 2 (Gly2&#8594;&#946;&#8208;Ala2) of the ATCUN motif reinstates ROS production (&#8226;OH and H2O2). Potentiometry, cyclic voltammetry, EPR spectroscopy and DFT simulations were utilized to explain the increased ROS generation of these &#946;&#8208;Ala2&#8208;containing ATCUN complexes. We also observed enhanced oxidative cleavage activity towards plasmid DNA for &#946;&#8208;Ala2 compared to the Gly2 complexes. Modifications with positively charged Lys residues increased the DNA affinity through electrostatic interactions as determined by UV/VIS, fluorescence, and CD spectroscopy, and consequently led to a further increase in nuclease activity. A similar trend was observed regarding the cytotoxic activity of the complexes against several human cancer cell lines where &#946;&#8208;Ala2 peptide complexes had lower IC50 values compared to Gly2. The higher cytotoxicity could be attributed to an increased cellular uptake as determined by ICP&#8208;MS measurements.

Abstract
The 4&#8208;anilino&#8208;6,7&#8208;ethylenedioxy&#8208;5&#8208;fluoroquinazoline scaffold is presented as a novel model system for the characterization of the weak NH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;F hydrogen bonding (HB) interaction. In this scaffold, the aniline NH proton is forced into close proximity with the nearby fluorine (dH,F&#8764;2.0&#8197;&#197;, &#8736;&#8764;138&#176;), and a through&#8208;space interaction is observed by NMR spectroscopy with couplings (1hJNH,F) of 19&#177;1&#8197;Hz. A combination of experimental (NMR spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray crystallography) and theoretical methods (DFT calculations) were used for the characterization of this weak interaction. In particular, the effects of conformational rigidity and steric compression on coupling were investigated. This scaffold was used for the direct comparison of fluoride with methoxy as HB acceptors, and the susceptibility of the NH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;F interaction to changes in electron distribution and resonance was probed by preparing a series of molecules with different electron&#8208;donating or &#8208;withdrawing groups in the positions para to the NH and F. The results support the idea that fluorine can act as a weak HB acceptor, and the HB strength can be modulated through additive and linear electronic substituent effects.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 4-anilino-6,7-ethylenedioxy-5-fluoroquinazoline scaffold is presented as a novel model system for the characterization of the weak NH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;F hydrogen bonding (HB) interaction. In this scaffold, the aniline NH proton is forced into close proximity with the nearby fluorine (&lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;H,F&lt;/sub&gt;&#8764;2.0&#8197;&#197;, &#8736;&#8764;138&#176;), and a through-space interaction is observed by NMR spectroscopy with couplings (&lt;sup&gt;1h&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;i&gt;J&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;NH,F&lt;/sub&gt;) of 19&#177;1&#8197;Hz. A combination of experimental (NMR spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography) and theoretical methods (DFT calculations) were used for the characterization of this weak interaction. In particular, the effects of conformational rigidity and steric compression on coupling were investigated. This scaffold was used for the direct comparison of fluoride with methoxy as HB acceptors, and the susceptibility of the NH&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;F interaction to changes in electron distribution and resonance was probed by preparing a series of molecules with different electron-donating or -withdrawing groups in the positions &lt;i&gt;para&lt;/i&gt; to the NH and F. The results support the idea that fluorine can act as a weak HB acceptor, and the HB strength can be modulated through additive and linear electronic substituent effects.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>From Thioureas to Thioquinolines through Isolated Benzothiazines by Gold Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The selective synthesis of benzothiazine heterocycles starting from thioureas has been achieved. With gold catalysis, these organic compounds evolved in basic medium towards the formation of amino thioquinolines through an unprecedented aromatisation process of the heterocycle. The reaction was also carried out stoichiometrically by reaction with gold complexes to afford thioquinolines coordinated to the gold fragment.







Abstract
New benzothiazine heterocycles have been formed from thiourea derivatives by using different gold catalysts. The catalyst and the conditions were optimised towards the selective synthesis of six&#8208;membered benzothiazine heterocycles, characterised by X&#8208;ray diffraction. Interestingly, these organic compounds evolved under gold catalysis in basic medium to achieve the formation of amino thioquinolines through an unprecedented aromatisation process of the heterocycle. The reaction was also carried out stoichiometrically by reaction with gold complexes to afford thioquinolines coordinated to the gold fragment. Benzothiazine, amino thioquinoline heterocycles and gold&#8208;derived species have a great potential for biological applications.

         <dc:description>
The nanozyme@natural enzyme symbiotic system of Cu2&#8208;xSe&#8722;GOx exhibited prominent &#8220;four&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; cascaded catalytic enzyme activities including catalase, peroxidase, glutathione oxidase and glucose oxidase. The ingenious Cu2&#8208;xSe&#8722;GOx could significantly induce the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) at tumor regions; this results in a tumor microenvironment (TME)&#8208;activated &#8220;four&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; enzyme cascade that is lethal to cervical cancer. All in all, Cu2&#8208;xSe&#8722;GOx can act as a high&#8208;performance and safe bioactive material for cancer treatment.







Abstract
Cervical cancer, as a common malignant tumor of the reproductive system, seriously threatens women&#8216;s life and health, and is difficult to be cured by traditional treatments, such as surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Fortunately, tumor microenvironment (TME)&#8208;activated catalytic therapy with high efficiency and reduced off&#8208;target toxicity has emerged as a novel treatment model. Herein, we designed a &#8220;four&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; nanozyme and natural enzyme symbiotic system of Cu2&#8208;xSe&#8722;GOx for TME&#8208;triggered cascaded catalytic enhanced cancer treatment. In response to unique TME, Cu2&#8208;xSe with catalase activity could effectively catalyze over&#8208;expressed H2O2 in cancer cells into O2. Subsequently, the glucose oxidase (GOx) could deplete intracellular glucose with the assistance of O2; this not only achieves starvation therapy, but also regenerates H2O2 to boost the generation of highly cytotoxic .OH due to the peroxidase activity of Cu2&#8208;xSe. Moreover, although the free&#8208;radical scavenger glutathione (GSH) is overexpressed in tumor cells, Cu2&#8208;xSe with glutathione oxidase activity could effectively consume GSH for enhanced ROS production. Thus, the &#8220;four&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; nanozyme@natural enzyme symbiotic system of Cu2&#8208;xSe&#8722;GOx could induce significant ROS accumulation at the tumor regions, thus providing a potential approach for the treatment of cervical cancer.

         <dc:description>
Two new sodium aluminum borates, Na3AlB8O15 and Na3Al2B7O15, have been successfully synthesized by substitution of [AlO4] for [BO4] covalent tetrahedra from &#946;&#8208;Na2B6O10. Anionic&#8208;group architectures are transformed from a two&#8208;dimensional double layer to a three&#8208;dimensional framework.







Abstract
Two new sodium aluminum borates, Na3AlB8O15 and Na3Al2B7O15, have been successfully synthesized by the high&#8208;temperature solution method. They crystallize in the different space groups, P21/c and P2/c, respectively. The B&#8722;O configurations of &#946;&#8208;Na2B6O10, Na3AlB8O15 and Na3Al2B7O15 are compared to feature complicated different dimensional open&#8208;framework structures caused by the substitution of [BO4] by [AlO4] covalent tetrahedra. Moreover, the experimental results indicate that Na3AlB8O15 and Na3Al2B7O15 have short ultraviolet (UV) cutoff edges (&lt;187&#8197;nm). The first&#8208;principles calculations show that Na3AlB8O15 and Na3Al2B7O15 have moderate birefringence (0.075 and 0.041@1064&#8197;nm, respectively).

         <title>Monitoring the Thiol/Thiophenol Molecule&#8208;Modulated Plasmon&#8208;Mediated Silver Oxidation with Dark&#8208;Field Optical Microscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thiol/thiophenol molecules can modulate the plasmon&#8208;mediated silver oxidation. Compared with molecules having electron donating groups, molecules having electron accepting groups accelerate the silver oxidation dramatically. The modulation of silver oxidation is attributed to the modulation of the charge separation between the Ag NPs and the adsorbed thiol or thiophenol molecules.







Abstract
Surface plasmon can trigger or accelerate many photochemical reactions, especially useful in energy and environmental industries. Recently, molecular adsorption has proven effective in modulating plasmon&#8208;mediated photochemistry, however the realized chemical reactions are limited and the underlying mechanism is still unclear. Herein, by using in&#8197;situ dark&#8208;field optical microscopy, the plasmon&#8208;mediated oxidative etching of silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs), a typical hot&#8208;hole&#8208;driven reaction, is monitored continuously and quantitatively. The presence of thiol or thiophenol molecules is found essential in the silver oxidation. In addition, the rate of silver oxidation is modulated by the choice of different thiol or thiophenol molecules. Compared with the molecules having electron donating groups, the ones having electron accepting groups accelerate the silver oxidation dramatically. The thiol/thiophenol modulation is attributed to the modulation of the charge separation between the Ag NPs and the adsorbed thiol or thiophenol molecules. This work demonstrates the great potential of molecular adsorption in modulating the plasmon&#8208;mediated photochemistry, which will pave a new way for developing highly efficient plasmonic photocatalysts.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Thiol/thiophenol molecules&lt;/b&gt; can modulate the plasmon-mediated silver oxidation. Compared with molecules having electron donating groups, molecules having electron accepting groups accelerate the silver oxidation dramatically. The modulation of silver oxidation is attributed to the modulation of the charge separation between the Ag NPs and the adsorbed thiol or thiophenol molecules.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surface plasmon can trigger or accelerate many photochemical reactions, especially useful in energy and environmental industries. Recently, molecular adsorption has proven effective in modulating plasmon-mediated photochemistry, however the realized chemical reactions are limited and the underlying mechanism is still unclear. Herein, by using in&#8197;situ dark-field optical microscopy, the plasmon-mediated oxidative etching of silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs), a typical hot-hole-driven reaction, is monitored continuously and quantitatively. The presence of thiol or thiophenol molecules is found essential in the silver oxidation. In addition, the rate of silver oxidation is modulated by the choice of different thiol or thiophenol molecules. Compared with the molecules having electron donating groups, the ones having electron accepting groups accelerate the silver oxidation dramatically. The thiol/thiophenol modulation is attributed to the modulation of the charge separation between the Ag NPs and the adsorbed thiol or thiophenol molecules. This work demonstrates the great potential of molecular adsorption in modulating the plasmon-mediated photochemistry, which will pave a new way for developing highly efficient plasmonic photocatalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Weinreb Amide, Ketone and Amine as Potential and Competitive Secondary Molecular Stations for Dibenzo&#8208;[24]Crown&#8208;8 in [2]Rotaxane Molecular Shuttles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chemical way to bistable molecular shuttles that hold a combination of amine, Weinreb amide and/or ketone as secondary stations for dibenzo&#8208;[24]crown&#8208;8 (DB24C8) is reported. Ketone and amine moieties have similar affinity for DB24C8 that is better than the Weinreb amide has. Hydrogen bonds between DB24C8 and an unhindered axle usually favor a co&#8208;conformation; unless steric restrictions, hence the constrained co&#8208;conformation, impose a predominance of alternative and unexpected even weaker H&#8208;bonds. More information can be found in the Research Article by M. Gauthier and F. Coutrot (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202103805).

         <dc:description>The long&#8208;standing history of platinum coordination complexes in nucleic acid recognition attests to the unique suitability of such species for therapeutic applications. Here, we report the synthetic exploration and development of a family of di&#8208;imine ligands, and their platinum(II) complexes, elaborated on a 3&#8208;(2&#8208;pyridyl)&#8208;[1,2,4]triazolo[4,3&#8208;  a  ]pyridine platform which, in its unsubstituted form, has recently been shown to display exceptional capabilities for guanine quadruplex (G4) targeting. The identification of facile, high&#8208;yielding synthetic methods for the derivatization of this platform for the incorporation of additional sites of interactions with guanine quadruplex loops and grooves, along with the optimization of platinum(II) complexation methods, are discussed. Gratifyingly, preliminary biophysical screening of this novel family of binders validates all but one family members as robust G4 binders, and highlights enhanced selectivity for quadruplex  vs  duplex DNA compared to the parent compound. These results bear promise for practical developments based on this platform.</dc:description>

         <title>Expanding the Scope of Polyoxometalates as Artificial Proteases towards Hydrolysis of Insoluble Proteins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite the enormous importance of&#160;insoluble proteins in biological processes, their structural investigation remains a challenging task. The development of artificial enzyme&#8208;like catalysts would greatly facilitate the elucidation of their structure since currently used enzymes in proteomics largely lose activity in the presence of surfactants, which are necessary to solubilize insoluble proteins. In this study, the hydrolysis of a fully insoluble protein by&#160;polyoxometalate complexes as artificial proteases&#160;in surfactant solutions is reported for the first time. The hydrolysis of zein as a model protein was investigated in the presence of&#160;Zr(IV) and Hf(IV)&#160;substituted Keggin&#8208;type&#160;polyoxometalates (POMs), (Et2NH2)10[M(&#945;&#8208;PW11O39)2]&#160;(M = Zr or Hf), and different concentrations of the anionic surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). The selective hydrolysis of the protein upon incubation with the catalyst was observed, and the results indicate that the hydrolytic selectivity and activity of the POM catalysts strongly depends on the concentration of surfactant. The molecular interactions between the POM catalyst and zein in the presence of SDS were explored using a combination of spectroscopic techniques which indicated competitive binding between POM and SDS towards the protein. Furthermore, the formation of micellar superstructures in tertiary POM/surfactant/protein solutions has been confirmed by electrical conductivity and Dynamic Light Scattering.</dc:description>

         <title>Organic Photocathode Supported by Copper Nanosheets Array for Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The Z&#8208;scheme overall solar water splitting is a mimic of natural photosynthesis to convert solar energy into chemical energy. Since the energy levels of most organic semiconductors match well with the hydrogen evolution potential, they have great application prospects as photocathodes in Z&#8208;scheme photoelectrochemical systems. However, due to the weak light absorption and difficult carriers separation, the photocurrent density and onset potential of organic photocathodes are still low. To solve these problems, we introduced copper nanosheets array (Cu NSA) framework under the organic layers to increase the surface reaction sites, improve the light absorption and enhance the distribution range of built&#8208;in electric field simultaneously. As a result, the photocurrent density and onset potential of poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene):[6,6]&#8208;phenyl&#8208;C61&#8208;butyric acid (P3HT:PCBM) photocathode were enhanced significantly. The onset potential increased by 50 mV to 0.65 V vs. RHE, and the photocurrent density reached &#8208;1 mA cm&#8208;2 at 0 V vs. RHE, which was 18 times that of the sample without Cu NSA. The optimized photocathode was connected with titanium dioxide nanorods array photoanode in a tandem manner to realize the spontaneous overall water splitting. Without bias and cocatalyst, the photocurrent density was maintained at 110 &#956;A cm&#8208;2 and the solar&#8208;to&#8208;fuel conversion efficiency was 0.14% in neutral solution. These results provide a feasible method for optimizing the performance of organic photocathode.</dc:description>

         <title>A Stereoselective Glycosylation Approach to the Construction of 1,2&#8208;trans&#8208;&#946;&#8208;D&#8208;Glycosidic Linkages and Convergent Synthesis of Saponins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Conventional syntheses of the 1,2&#8208;trans&#8208;&#946;&#8208;D&#8208; or &#945;&#8208;L&#8208;glycosidic linkages rely mainly on the neighboring group participation in the glycosylation reactions. The requirement of a neighboring participation group (NPG) excludes direct glycosylation with (1&#8594;2)&#8208;linked glycan donors, thus only allowing stepwise assembly of glycans and glycoconjugates containing this type of common motif. Here we disclose a robust glycosylation protocol for the synthesis of 1,2&#8208;trans&#8208;&#946;&#8208;D&#8208; or &#945;&#8208;L&#8208;glycosidic linkages without resorting to NPG, which employs an optimal combination of glycosyl N&#8208;phenyltrifluroacetimidates as donors, FeCl3 as promoter, and CH2Cl2/nitrile as solvent. A broad substrate scope has been demonstrated by glycosylations with twelve (1&#8594;2)&#8208;linked di&#8208; and trisaccharide donors and thirteen alcoholic acceptors including eight complex triterpene derivatives. Most of the glycosylation reactions are high yielding and exclusively 1,2&#8208;trans selective. Ten representative naturally occurring triterpene saponins are thus synthesized in a convergent manner after deprotection of the coupled glycosides. Intensive mechanistic studies indicate that the present glycosylation proceeds via a SN2&#8208;type substitution of the glycosyl &#945;&#8208;nitrilium intermediates. Importantly, FeCl3 dissociates and coordinates with nitrile into [Fe(RCN)nCl2]+ and [FeCl4]&#8208;, and the ferric cationic species coordinates with the alcoholic acceptor to provide a protic species which activates the imidate, meanwhile the poor nucleophilicity of [FeCl4]&#8208; ensures a non&#8208;interruptive role for the glycosidation.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Charge&#8208;transfer emitters are attractive due to their color tunability and potentially high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs). We herein present tetraaminospirenes as donor moieties, which, in combination with a variety of acceptors, furnished 12 chargetransfer emitters with a range of emission colors and PLQYs of up to 99%. The spatial separation of their frontier molecular orbitals was obtained through careful structural design, and two DA structures were confirmed by X&#8208;ray crystallography. A range of photophysical measurements supported by DFT calculations shed light on the optoelectronic properties of this new family of spiro&#8208;NN&#8208;donor&#8208;acceptor dyes.</dc:description>

         <title>Europium is different: Solvent and ligand effects on oxidation state outcomes and C&#8208;F activation in reactions between europium metal and pentafluorophenylsilver</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Unique outcomes have emerged from the redox transmetallation/ protolysis (RTP) reactions of europium metal with [Ag(C  6  F  5  )(py)] (py = pyridine) and pyrazoles (RR&#8242;pzH). In pyridine, a solvent not normally used for RTP reactions, the products were mainly Eu  II  complexes, [Eu(RR&#8242;pz)  2  (py)  4  ] (RR&#8242;pz = 3,5&#8208;diphenylpyrazolate (Ph  2  pz)  1  ; 3&#8208;(2&#8208;thienyl)&#8208;5&#8208;trifluoromethylpyrazolate (ttfpz)  2  ; 3&#8208;methyl&#8208;5&#8208;phenylpyrazolate (PhMepz)  3  ). However, use of 3,5&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylpyrazole (  t  Bu  2  pzH) gave trivalent [Eu(  t  Bu  2  pz)  3  (py)  2  ]  4  , whereas the bulkier N,N&#8242;&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;difluorophenyl)formamidine (DFFormH) gave divalent [Eu(DFForm)  2  (py)  3  ]  5  . In tetrahydrofuran (thf), the usual solvent for RTP reactions, C&#8208;F activation was observed for the first time with [Ag(C  6  F  5  )(py)] in such reactions. Thus trivalent [{Eu  2  (Ph  2  pz)  4  (py)  4  (thf)  2  (&#956;&#8208;F)  2  }{Eu  2  (Ph  2  pz)  4  (py)  2  (thf)  4  (&#956;&#8208;F)  2  }] (  6  ), [Eu  2  (ttfpz)  4  (py)  2  (dme)  2  (&#956;&#8208;F)  2  ] (  7  ), [Eu  2  (  t  Bu  2  pz)  4  (dme)  2  (&#956;&#8208;F)  2  ] (  8  ) were obtained from the appropriate pyrazoles, the last two after crystallization from 1,2&#8208;dimethoxyethane (dme). Surprisingly 3,5&#8208;dimethylpyrazole (Me  2  pzH) gave the divalent cage [Eu  6  (Me  2  pz)  10  (thf)  6  (&#956;&#8208;F)  2  ] (  9  ).</dc:description>

         <title>Single Amino&#8208;Acid Based Self&#8208;Assembled Biomaterials with Potent Antimicrobial Activity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 67, Page 16744-16753, December 1, 2021. </description>

New self&#8208;assembled materials with prominent antimicrobial activity developed by the modification of amino acid's sidechain.







Abstract
The design and development of soft biomaterials based on amino acid and short&#8208;peptide have gained much attention due to their potent biomedical applications. A slight alteration in the side&#8208;chain of single amino acid in a peptide or protein sequence has a huge impact on the structure and function. Phenylalanine is one of the most studied amino acids, which contains an aromatic phenyl group connected through a flexible &#8722;CH2&#8722; unit. In this work, we have examined whether flexibility and aromatic functionality of phenylalanine (Phe) are important in gel formation of model gelator Fmoc&#8208;Phe&#8208;OH or not. To examine this hypothesis, we synthesized Fmoc&#8208;derivatives of three analogues unnatural amino acids including cyclohexylalanine, phenylglycine, and homophenylalanine; which are slightly varied from Phe. Interestingly, all these three new analogues formed hydrogels in phosphate buffer at pH&#8197;7.0 having different gelation efficacy and kinetics. This study suggests that the presence of aromatic side&#8208;chain and flexibility are not mandatory for the gelation of this model gelator. Newly synthesized unnatural amino acid derivatives have also exhibited promising antimicrobial activity towards gram&#8208;positive bacteria by inhibiting cellular oxygen consumption. We further determined the biocompatibility of these amino acid derivatives by using a hemolysis assay on human blood cells. Overall studies described the development of single amino acid&#8208;based new injectable biomaterials with improved antimicrobial activity by the slight alteration in the side&#8208;chain of amino acid.

         <dc:description>
Herein, the isolation of ketyl, and more importantly ketiminyl and aldiminyl radical anions coordinated to cobalt&#8208; and iron is presented. Insights into the electronic structure of these unusual metal bound radical anions is provided by various analytical methods as well as by a detailed computational analysis. The metal bound radical anions are very reactive and facilitate the activation of intra&#8208; and intermolecular C&#8722;H bonds.







Abstract
Carbonyl and iminyl based radical anions are reactive intermediates in a variety of transformations in organic synthesis. Herein, the isolation of ketyl, and more importantly unprecedented ketiminyl and aldiminyl radical anions coordinated to cobalt and iron complexes is presented. Insights into the electronic structure of these unusual metal bound radical anions is provided by X&#8208;Ray diffraction analysis, NMR, IR, UV/Vis and M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy, solid and solution state magnetometry, as well as a by a detailed computational analysis. The metal bound radical anions are very reactive and facilitate the activation of intra&#8208; and intermolecular C&#8722;H bonds.

Discovering the natural route to &#8220;synthetic&#8221; heterocycles: Myxofacyclines are natural products isolated from myxobacteria. Myxofacyclines A&#8211;D display an isoxazole substructure, myxofacyclines E and F contain 4&#8208;pyrimidinole, and myxofacycline G features another rare 1,2&#8208;dihydropyrol&#8208;3&#8208;one moiety. The isoxazole, 4&#8208;pyrimidinole or 1,2&#8208;dihydropyrrol&#8208;3&#8208;one heterocycle in the myxofacyclines and the underlying biosynthesis are rarely described in natural products. Isolation, structure elucidation, mutagenesis of the producer strain and heterologous expression of the identified biosynthetic genes are presented.







Abstract
A metabolome&#8208;guided screening approach in the novel myxobacterium Corallococcus sp. MCy9072 resulted in the isolation of the unprecedented natural product myxofacycline A, which features a rare isoxazole substructure. Identification and genomic investigation of additional producers alongside targeted gene inactivation experiments and heterologous expression of the corresponding biosynthetic gene cluster in the host Myxococcus xanthus DK1622 confirmed a noncanonical megaenzyme complex as the biosynthetic origin of myxofacycline A. Induced expression of the respective genes led to significantly increased production titers enabling the identification of six further members of the myxofacycline natural product family. Whereas myxofacyclines A&#8211;D display an isoxazole substructure, intriguingly myxofacyclines E and F were found to contain 4&#8208;pyrimidinole, a heterocycle unprecedented in natural products. Lastly, myxofacycline G features another rare 1,2&#8208;dihydropyrol&#8208;3&#8208;one moiety. In addition to a full structure elucidation, we report the underlying biosynthetic machinery and present a rationale for the formation of all myxofacyclines. Unexpectedly, an extraordinary polyketide synthase&#8208;nonribosomal peptide synthetase hybrid was found to produce all three types of heterocycle in these natural products.

         <title>Singlet Biradical Versus Triplet Biradical/Zwitterion Characteristics in Isomers of C6&#8722;C5&#8722;C6&#8722;C7&#8722;C6&#8208;Fused Pentacyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons Revealed through Reactivity Patterns</title>

Two isomers of C6&#8722;C5&#8722;C6&#8722;C7&#8722;C6 fused pentacyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are imbedded with para&#8208; and meta&#8208;quinondimethane structural motifs respectively. The two compounds exhibit distinctive reactivity patterns reminiscence of singlet and triplet biradical species. The ground state electronic structures predicted by DFT calculation are also consistent with the observed reactivities.







Abstract
Among various polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, C6&#8722;C5&#8722;C6&#8722;C7&#8722;C6 fused pentacyclic aromatic hydrocarbons have the unique potential to adopt quinonoid, zwitterion, singlet, or triplet biradical electronic configurations. Two such hybrid structures between pentacene and azulene were synthesized and their ground state electronic configurations were deduced from the reactivity patterns they exhibit respectively. Compound 6, where the radicaloid carbons are linked through a para&#8208;phenylene, forms a head&#8208;to&#8208;head dimer like a singlet biradical. In contrast, isomer 7, where the para&#8208;linkage was switched to meta, reacts readily with oxygen which resembles the reactivity of a triplet state. The oxidized intermediate(s) then undergoes rearrangement to furnish the C6&#8722;C5&#8722;C6&#8722;C6&#8722;C6 ring contraction product 13. Cation 14, the protonated form of 7, was synthesized, which implies 7 also reacts like a zwitterion. It was revealed the oxidative rearrangement takes place even with mesityl dibenzotropylium cation despite its perceived aromaticity. DFT calculations confirm the most stable forms of 6 and 7 are singlet and triplet diradical, which is consistent with the observed reactivity of respective molecules.

A heterojunction material combined with polyoxometalate is designed to remove complex pollutants from water. The results of the experiments show that a material with such structure has good photoreduction property for Cr(VI) and adsorption property for organic cation dyes.







Abstract
Wastewater treatment is of great significance to environmental remediation. The exploration of efficient and stable methods for wastewater treatment is still a challenging issue. Herein, a heterojunction material with photocatalysis and adsorption properties has been designed to remove the complex pollutants from wastewater. The heterojunction material (ZnO/TiO2&#8722;PW12, PW12=[PW12O40]3&#8722;) was synthesized by calcining the ZnTi&#8722;layered double hydroxide (ZnTi&#8208;LDH) intercalated with the Keggin&#8208;type polyoxometalate H3PW12O40. In the construction of ZnO/TiO2&#8722;PW12 it was found that the polyanionic PW12 remained unchanged in the process of forming the proposed heterojunction. The photochemical properties verify that heterojunction synergistic with PW12 facilitated the separation of photoproduced electron&#8208;hole pairs and thus suppressed the recombination. Therefore, ZnO/TiO2&#8722;PW12 exhibits excellent photocatalytic property, and the efficiency of Cr(VI) photoreduction reached more than 90&#8201;% in the first 3&#8197;min. Furthermore, the electrostatic force between the PW12 and cationic dyes makes ZnO/TiO2&#8722;PW12 having an outstanding adsorption performance for cationic dyes, such as rhodamine B, crystal violet and methyl blue. Such heterojunction material combined with polyoxometalate puts forward new insights for the design of functional materials for water treatment with low cost and high efficiency.

Hyper coordination: The decoration of V&#8208;shaped CE22&#8722; and Y&#8208;shaped CE32&#8722; dianions, with alkali counterions, results in 38 new global minima with formula MmCE2p and MnCE3q (E=S&#8722;Te; M=Li&#8722;Cs; n=1, 2; m=2, 3; p=m&#8208;2; q=n&#8208;2) containing a planar hypercoordinate carbon atom &#8722;24 with a planar tetracoordinate carbon (ptC) and 14 with a planar pentacoordinate carbon (ppC).







Abstract
After exploring the potential energy surfaces of MmCE2p (E=S&#8722;Te, M=Li&#8722;Cs, m=2, 3 and p=m&#8208;2) and MnCE3q (E=S&#8722;Te, M=Li&#8722;Cs, n=1, 2, q=n&#8208;2) combinations, we introduce 38 new global minima containing a planar hypercoordinate carbon atom (24 with a planar tetracoordinate carbon and 14 with a planar pentacoordinate carbon). These exotic clusters result from the decoration of V&#8208;shaped CE22&#8722; and Y&#8208;shaped CE32&#8722; dianions, respectively, with alkali counterions. All these 38 systems fulfill the geometrical and electronic criteria to be considered as true planar hypercoordinate carbon systems. Chemical bonding analyses indicate that carbon is covalently bonded to chalcogens and ionically connected to alkali metals.

         <title>Designing a Red&#8208;Emitting Viscosity&#8208;Sensitive BODIPY Fluorophore for Intracellular Viscosity Imaging</title>

Going into the red: We report a new red&#8208;emitting fluorescent viscosity probe suitable for intracellular viscosity imaging of MCF&#8208;7 breast cancer cells. This was achieved with the help of DFT calculations that allowed the viscosity sensitivity of the fluorophore to be predicted before synthesis.







Abstract
Viscosity imaging at a microscopic scale can provide important information about biosystems, including the development of serious illnesses. Microviscosity imaging is achievable with viscosity&#8208;sensitive fluorophores, the most popular of which are based on the BODIPY group. However, most of the BODIPY probes fluoresce green light, whereas the red luminescence is desired for the imaging of biological samples. Designing a new viscosity probe with suitable spectroscopic properties is a challenging task because it is difficult to preserve viscosity sensitivity after modifying the molecular structure. Here we describe how we developed a new red&#8208;emitting, viscosity&#8208;sensitive, BODIPY fluorophore BP&#8208;PH&#8208;2M&#8208;NO2 that is suitable for reliable intracellular viscosity imaging of lipid droplets in MCF&#8208;7 breast cancer cells. The design of BP&#8208;PH&#8208;2M&#8208;NO2 was aided by DFT calculations that allowed a successful prediction of the viscosity sensitivity of fluorophores before synthesis. In summary, we report a new red viscosity probe possessing monoexponential fluorescence decay that makes it attractive for lifetime&#8208;based viscosity imaging.

         <title>A Novel Route for the Easy Production of Thermochromic VO2 Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 67, Page 16662-16669, December 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
M1&#8208;VO2 nanoparticles with better thermochromic properties than commercial ones are fabricated by a simple, dry, fast, clean and safe method, compatible with VO2 doping, consisting of thermal treatments of V nanoparticles by fast heating and (a) keeping 700&#8201;&#176;C for about 10&#8197;minutes and slow cooling (one cycle); or (b) 625&#8201;&#176;C for 5&#8197;minutes and fast cooling (two cycles).







Abstract
In this work, a simple, fast and dry method for the fabrication of a thermochromic product with a high load of VO2(M1) consisting of the controlled heat treatment of pure vanadium nanoparticles in air is presented. After a complete design of experiments, it is concluded that the most direct way to attain the maximum transformation of V into VO2(M1) consists of one cycle with a fast heating ramp of 42&#8201;&#176;C&#8201;s&#8722;1, followed by keeping 700&#8201;&#176;C for 530&#8211;600&#8197;seconds, and a subsequent cooling at 0.05&#8201;&#176;C&#8201;s&#8722;1. Careful examination of these results lead to a second optimum, even more suitable for industrial production (quicker and less energy&#8208;intensive because of its lower temperatures and shorter times), consisting of subjecting V to two consecutive cycles of temperatures and times (625&#8201;&#176;C for 5&#8197;minutes) with similar preheating (42&#8201;&#176;C&#8201;s&#8722;1) but a much faster postcooling (&#8764; 8&#8201;&#176;C&#8201;s&#8722;1). These green reactions only use the power for heating a tube open to atmosphere and a vanadium precursor; without assistance of reactive gases or catalysts, and no special vacuum or pressure requirements. The best products present similar thermochromic properties but higher thermal stability than commercial VO2 particles. These methods can be combined with VO2 doping.

         <title>Emerging Design Principle of Near&#8208;Infrared Upconversion Sensitizer Based on Mitochondria&#8208;Targeted Organic Dye for Enhanced Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 67, Page 16707-16715, December 1, 2021. </description>

A NIR photosensitizer Cy5.5&#8208;Br was designed and synthesized based on a cyanine derivate (Cy5.5&#8208;H), which presented extraordinary super heavy atom effect (SHAE) and structure&#8208;inherent targeting (SIT) to tumors. Moreover, Cy5.5&#8208;Br has a satisfactory triplet quantum yield, an unusual long&#8208;lived triplet state and excellent photostability upon hot&#8208;band excitation, which makes it possible to realize effective PDT under a biosafety optical density.







Abstract
Upconversion luminescent (UCL) triggered photodynamic therapy (PDT) affords superior outcome for cancer treatment. However, conventional UCL materials which all work by a multiphoton absorption (MPA) process inevitably need extremely high power density far over the maximum permissible exposure (MPE) to laser. Here, a one&#8208;photon absorption molecular upconversion sensitizer Cy5.5&#8208;Br based on frequency upconversion luminescent (FUCL) is designed for PDT. The unusual super heavy atom effect (SHAE) in Cy5.5&#8208;Br strongly enhances its spin&#8208;orbit coupling (0.23&#8197;cm&#8722;1), triplet quantum yield (11.1&#8201;%) and triplet state lifetime (18.8&#8197;&#956;s) while the potential hot&#8208;band absorption of Cy5.5&#8208;Br is well maintained. Importantly, Cy5.5&#8208;Br can efficiently target the tumour site and kill cancer cells by destroying mitochondria under a biosafety MPE to 808&#8197;nm laser. The photostability and antitumor results are obviously superior to that of a Stokes process. This work provides a design criterion for FUCL dyes to realize effective PDT upon a biosafety optical density, possibly bringing more clinical benefits than conventional MPA materials.

         <title>Mechanistic Studies on the Hexadecafluorophthalocyanine&#8211;Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Wacker&#8208;Type Oxidation of Olefins to Ketones**
</title>

How does it work? Herein, we describe our detailed mechanistic studies on the iron&#8208;catalyzed oxidation of olefins to ketones. Isotopic labeling studies (deuterium and 18O) and M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy led to an advanced mechanism for the catalytic cycle.







Abstract
The hexadecafluorophthalocyanine&#8211;iron complex FePcF16 was recently shown to convert olefins into ketones in the presence of stoichiometric amounts of triethylsilane in ethanol at room temperature under an oxygen atmosphere. Herein, we describe an extensive mechanistic investigation for the conversion of 2&#8208;vinylnaphthalene into 2&#8208;acetylnaphthalene as model reaction. A variety of studies including deuterium&#8208; and 18O2&#8208;labeling experiments, ESI&#8208;MS, and 57Fe M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy were performed to identify the intermediates involved in the catalytic cycle of the oxidation process. Finally, a detailed and well&#8208;supported reaction mechanism for the FePcF16&#8208;catalyzed Wacker&#8208;type oxidation is proposed.

Herein, we describe an extensive mechanistic investigation for the conversion of 2-vinylnaphthalene into 2-acetylnaphthalene as model reaction. A variety of studies including deuterium- and &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-labeling experiments, ESI-MS, and &lt;sup&gt;57&lt;/sup&gt;Fe M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy were performed to identify the intermediates involved in the catalytic cycle of the oxidation process. Finally, a detailed and well-supported reaction mechanism for the FePcF&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;-catalyzed Wacker-type oxidation is proposed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Intriguing transformation: Through thermodynamic and kinetic control, dopant&#8208;matrix afterglow materials with different aggregation states and diverse afterglow properties can be obtained. The conversion from metastable aggregation state to thermodynamic state, triggered by thermal and solvent annealing, can lead to the emergence of intriguing afterglow transformation. The thermodynamically unfavorable reversible afterglow transformation can be achieved by coupling the afterglow system to mechanical forces.







Abstract
The fabrication of room&#8208;temperature organic phosphorescence and afterglow materials, as well as the transformation of their photophysical properties, has emerged as an important topic in the research field of luminescent materials. Here, we report the establishment of energy landscapes in dopant&#8208;matrix organic afterglow systems where the aggregation states of luminescent dopants can be controlled by doping concentrations in the matrices and the methods of preparing the materials. Through manipulation by thermodynamic and kinetic control, dopant&#8208;matrix afterglow materials with different aggregation states and diverse afterglow properties can be obtained. The conversion from metastable aggregation state to thermodynamic stable aggregation state of the dopant&#8208;matrix afterglow materials to leads to the emergence of intriguing afterglow transformation behavior triggered by thermal and solvent annealing. The thermodynamically unfavorable reversible afterglow transformation process can also be achieved by coupling the dopant&#8208;matrix afterglow system to mechanical forces.

Organic SIB anode: Using polyazaacene analogue PQL as the anode, SIBs displayed stable electrochemical performances and great rate capability. This work would provide insights into the application of organic polymer electrodes in rechargeable batteries.







Abstract
The high theoretical specific capacity, strong structural designability and relatively inexpensive manufacturing cost make the exploration of organic electrode materials more attractive in recent years. In this article, owing to the large &#960;&#8208;conjugated structure, plenty of nitrogen heteroatoms and multiring aromatic system, polyazaacene analogue poly(1,6&#8208;dihydropyrazino[2,3&#8197;g]quinoxaline&#8208;2,3,8&#8208;triyl&#8208;7&#8208;(2H)&#8208;ylidene&#8208;7,8&#8208;dimethylidene) (PQL) was applied as the anode in sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). PQL was almost insoluble in conventional liquid organic electrolyte (1&#8197;M NaClO4 in ethylene carbonate (EC)/dimethyl carbonate (DMC) (v:v=1&#8201;:&#8201;1) with 5&#8201;% fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC)), which strongly improved its cycle stability. The initial discharge capacity was obtained to be 1825&#8197;mAh&#8197;g&#8722;1 at the current density of 100&#8197;mA g&#8722;1 and stabilized at 317&#8197;mAh&#8197;g&#8722;1 after 400 cycles with the coulombic efficiency as high as 97&#8201;%. It not only showed good rate capability at high current densities (202, 183&#8197;mAh&#8197;g&#8722;1 at 1&#8197;A&#8197;g&#8722;1 and 1.5&#8197;A&#8197;g&#8722;1) but also had a superior energy density around 290&#8197;Wh&#8197;kg&#8722;1.

         <title>Synthesis of a Negative Photochrome with High Switching Quantum Yields and Capable of Singlet&#8208;Oxygen Production and Storage</title>

         <dc:description>
A dimethyldihydropyrene photochromic unit bearing electron&#8208;donor and &#8208;acceptor substituents has been synthetized and investigated by spectroscopy, electrochemistry and theoretical calculations (spin&#8208;flip TD&#8208;DFT). This system can be reversibly isomerized with very good quantum yields to its corresponding cyclophanediene form when irradiated by red light under inert atmosphere and is able to generate two endoperoxide isomers upon illumination under air. These endoperoxides can thermally release singlet oxygen.







Abstract
A dimethyldihydropyrene (DHP) photochromic unit has been functionalized by donor (triphenylamine group) and acceptor (methylpyridinium) substituents. This compound was characterized by NMR, absorption and emission spectroscopies as well as cyclic voltammetry, and its properties were rationalized by theoretical calculations. The incorporation of both electron&#8208;donor and &#8208;withdrawing groups at the photochromic center allows i) an efficient photo&#8208;isomerization of the system when illuminated at low energy (quantum yield: &#934;c&#8208;o=13.3&#8201;% at &#955;ex=660&#8197;nm), ii) the reversible and quantitative formation of two endoperoxyde isomers when illuminated under aerobic conditions at room temperature, and iii) the storage and production of singlet oxygen. The photo&#8208;isomerization mechanism was also investigated by spin&#8208;flip TD&#8208;DFT (SF&#8208;TD&#8208;DFT) calculations.

         <title>Variable Luminescence and Chromaticity of Homoleptic Frameworks of the Lanthanides together with Pyridylpyrazolates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 67, Page 16634-16641, December 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8208;based reactions of elemental lanthanides with pyridylpyrazoles result in two series of homoleptic 3D frameworks. The products exhibit versatile photoluminescence properties, the linkers being suitable sensitizers for Ln&#8208;based emission. Tuning of the luminescence chromaticity from green to yellow and red as well as towards white&#8208;light emission was achieved by co&#8208;doping the Gd&#8208;containing frameworks of both series with Eu3+ and Tb3.







Abstract
Homoleptic, 3D coordination polymers of the formula 33&#8734;[Ln(3&#8208;PyPz)3] and 3&#8734;[Ln(4&#8208;PyPz)3], (3&#8208;PyPz)&#8722;=3&#8208;(3&#8208;pyridyl)pyrazolate anion, (4&#8208;PyPz)&#8722;=3&#8208;(4&#8208;pyridyl)pyrazolate anion, both C8H6N3&#8722;, Ln=Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, were obtained as highly luminescent frameworks by reaction of the lanthanide metals (Ln) with the aromatic heterocyclic amine ligands 3&#8208;PyPzH and 4&#8208;PyPzH. The compounds form two isotypic series of 3D coordination polymers and exhibit fair thermal stability up to 360&#8201;&#176;C. The luminescence properties of all ten compounds were determined in the solid state, with an antenna effect through ligand&#8211;metal energy transfer leading to high efficiency of the luminescence displayed by good quantum yields of up to 74&#8201;%. The emission is mainly based on ion&#8208;specific lanthanide&#8208;dependent intra 4&#8201;f&#8211;4&#8201;f transitions for Tb3+: green, Dy3+: yellow, Sm3+: orange&#8208;red, Eu3+: red. For the Gd3+&#8208;containing compounds, the yellow emission of ligand triplet&#8208;based phosphorescence is observed at room temperature and 77&#8197;K. Co doping of the Gd&#8208;containing frameworks with Eu3+ and Tb3+ allow further shifting of the chromaticity towards white light emission.

The emission is mainly based on ion-specific lanthanide-dependent intra 4&#8201;f&#8211;4&#8201;f transitions for Tb&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;: green, Dy&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;: yellow, Sm&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;: orange-red, Eu&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;: red. For the Gd&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;-containing compounds, the yellow emission of ligand triplet-based phosphorescence is observed at room temperature and 77&#8197;K. Co doping of the Gd-containing frameworks with Eu&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; and Tb&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; allow further shifting of the chromaticity towards white light emission.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The E2 state of FeMoco: Hydride Formation versus Fe Reduction and a Mechanism for H2 Evolution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 67, Page 16788-16800, December 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydride formation versus Fe reduction: Hybrid quantum mechanics / molecular mechanics calculations were used to explore the the E2 redox state of the iron&#8208;molybdenum cofactor of nitrogenase. Two stable isomers were found: a bridging hydride model (with an open belt sulfide&#8208;bridge) and a non&#8208;hydride model (with two belt sulfides protonated and reduced Fe). A path back to the resting state, by H2 evolution via a hydride&#8208;proton reaction was found.







Abstract
The iron&#8208;molybdenum cofactor (FeMoco) is responsible for dinitrogen reduction in Mo nitrogenase. Unlike the resting state, E0, reduced states of FeMoco are much less well characterized. The E2 state has been proposed to contain a hydride but direct spectroscopic evidence is still lacking. The E2 state can, however, relax back the E0 state via a H2 side&#8208;reaction, implying a hydride intermediate prior to H2 formation. This E2&#8594;E0 pathway is one of the primary mechanisms for H2 formation under low&#8208;electron flux conditions. In this study we present an exploration of the energy surface of the E2 state. Utilizing both cluster&#8208;continuum and QM/MM calculations, we explore various classes of E2 models: including terminal hydrides, bridging hydrides with a closed or open sulfide&#8208;bridge, as well as models without. Importantly, we find the hemilability of a protonated belt&#8208;sulfide to strongly influence the stability of hydrides. Surprisingly, non&#8208;hydride models are found to be almost equally favorable as hydride models. While the cluster&#8208;continuum calculations suggest multiple possibilities, QM/MM suggests only two models as contenders for the E2 state. These models feature either i) a bridging hydride between Fe2 and Fe6 and an open sulfide&#8208;bridge with terminal SH on Fe6 (E2&#8208;hyd) or ii) a double belt&#8208;sulfide protonated, reduced cofactor without a hydride (E2&#8208;nonhyd). We suggest both models as contenders for the E2 redox state and further calculate a mechanism for H2 evolution. The changes in electronic structure of FeMoco during the proposed redox&#8208;state cycle, E0&#8594;E1&#8594;E2&#8594;E0, are discussed.

         <title>Hierarchical Self&#8208;Assembly of Amphiphilic &#946;&#8208;C&#8208;Glycosylbarbiturates into Multiresponsive Alginate&#8208;Like Supramolecular Hydrogel Fibers and Vesicle Hydrogel</title>

Barbituric acid&#8208;mediated Knoevenagel condensation on unprotected carbohydrates enabled the molecular design of amphiphilic &#946;&#8208;C&#8208;glycosyl barbiturates as hydrogelators. The single&#8208;tailed glycoamphiphiles self&#8208;assembled into alginate&#8208;like multistimuli&#8208;triggered and responsive supramolecular hydrogel fibers. While, the double&#8208;tailed glycoamphiphiles led to vesicle hydrogels. Barbituric acid proves to be an efficient and versatile chemical toolbox for the access and design of glycoconjugates.







Abstract
Ordered molecular self&#8208;assembly of glycoamphiphiles has been regarded as an attractive, practical and bottom&#8208;up approach to obtain stable, structurally well&#8208;defined, and functional mimics of natural polysaccharides. This study describes a versatile and rational design of carbohydrate&#8208;based hydrogelators through N,N&#8217;&#8208;substituted barbituric acid&#8208;mediated Knoevenagel condensation onto unprotected carbohydrates in water. Amphiphilic N&#8208;substituted &#946;&#8208;C&#8208;maltosylbarbiturates self&#8208;assembled into pH&#8208; and calcium&#8208;triggered alginate&#8208;like supramolecular hydrogel fibers with a multistimuli responsiveness to temperature, pH and competitive metal chelating agent. In addition, amphiphilic N,N&#8217;&#8208;disubstituted &#946;&#8208;C&#8208;maltosylbarbiturates formed vesicle gels in pure water that were scarcely observed for glyco&#8208;hydrogelators. Finally, barbituric acid worked as a multitasking group allowing chemoselective ligation onto reducing&#8208;end carbohydrates, structural diversity, stimuli&#8208;sensitiveness, and supramolecular interactions by hydrogen bonding.

         <title>Controllable Macroscopic Chirality of Coordination Polymers through pH and Anion&#8208;Mediated Weak Interactions</title>

The morphologies of 1D coordination polymers of GdIII(R&#8208;pempHx)3(anion)(3&#8208;3x) can be controlled by the combined effect of pH and anions. Superhelices were formed when anions with larger sizes and enhanced anion&#8208;chain interactions, such as I&#8722; (and I3&#8722;), C6H5SO3&#8722; and CF3SO3&#8722;, were present in the systems. When the anion is CF3SO3&#8722;, a complete chirality inversion from left&#8208; to right&#8208;handedness was observed by raising the pH of the reaction mixture.







Abstract
Helical architectures with controllable helical sense bias have recently attracted considerable interest for mimicking biological helices and developing novel chiral materials. Coordination polymers (CPs), composed of metal ion nodes and organic linkers, are intriguing systems showing tunable structures and functions. However, CPs with helical morphologies have rarely been explored so far. Particularly, chirality inversion through external stimulus has not been achieved in helical CPs. In this work, we carried out an in&#8208;depth investigation on the self&#8208;assembly of 1D gadolinium(III) phosphonate CPs using GdX3 (X=Cl, Br, I) and Gd(RSO3) (R=CH3, C6H5, CF3) as metal sources and R&#8208;(1&#8208;phenylethylamino)methyl phosphonic acid (R&#8208;pempH2) as ligand. Superhelices were formed by precise control of the interchain interactions through different intercalated anions. Furthermore, the twisting direction of superhelices could be controlled by synergistic effect of anions and pH. This study may provide a new route to fabricate helical nanostructures of CPs with a desirable chiral sense and help understand the inner mechanism of the self&#8208;assembly process of macroscopic helical structures of molecular systems.

Nitrogen+nickel nexus: A bipyridine&#8208;modified DNA three&#8208;way junction (3WJ) structure has been synthesized from three DNA strands modified with a bipyridine (bpy) ligand via a stable amide linker. The bpy&#8208;modified 3WJ was thermally stabilized by the formation of an interstrand NiII(bpy)3 complex. Structure induction of the 3WJs and the duplexes was achieved by addition or removal of NiII ions. Furthermore, NiII&#8208;mediated self&#8208;sorting of 3WJs was demonstrated by using the bpy&#8208;modified strands and their unmodified counterparts.







Abstract
DNA three&#8208;way junction (3WJ) structures are essential building blocks for the construction of DNA nanoarchitectures. We have synthesized a bipyridine (bpy)&#8208;modified DNA 3WJ by using a newly designed bpy&#8208;modified nucleoside, Ubpy&#8208;3, in which a bpy ligand is tethered via a stable amide linker. The thermal stability of the bpy&#8208;modified 3WJ was greatly enhanced by the formation of an interstrand NiII(bpy)3 complex at the junction core (&#916;Tm=+17.7&#8201;&#176;C). Although the stereochemistry of the modification site differs from that of the previously reported bpy&#8208;modified nucleoside Ubpy&#8208;2, the degree of the NiII&#8208;mediated stabilization observed with Ubpy&#8208;3 was comparable to that of Ubpy&#8208;2. Structure induction of the 3WJs and the duplexes was carried out by the addition or removal of NiII ions. Furthermore, NiII&#8208;mediated self&#8208;sorting of 3WJs was performed by using the bpy&#8208;modified strands and their unmodified counterparts. Both transformations were driven by the formation of NiII(bpy)3 complexes. The structural induction and self&#8208;sorting of bpy&#8208;modified 3WJs are expected to have many potential applications in the development of metal&#8208;responsive DNA materials.

         <title>Tunable Linear and Nonlinear Optical Properties from Room Temperature Phosphorescent Cyclic Triimidazole&#8208;Pyrene Bio&#8208;Probe</title>

TT&#8208;Pyr bioprobe crystallizes in different polymorphs and solvates. Starting from solvate structures, thermal transformation to room temperature and, finally, high temperature polymorphs is accompanied by variation in the phopotophysical behavior which has been interpreted through theoretical and structural analyses. Dual fluorescence, RTP and SHG signal are observed for the non&#8208;centrosymmetric TT&#8208;Pyr(HT) polymorph.







Abstract
Organic materials with multiple emissions tunable by external stimuli represent a great challenge. TTPyr, crystallizing in different polymorphs, shows a very rich photophyisics comprising excitation&#8208;dependent fluorescence and phosphorescence at ambient conditions, and mechanochromic and thermochromic behavior. Transformation among the different species has been followed by thermal and X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses and the emissive features interpreted through structural results and DFT/TDDFT calculations. Particularly intriguing is the polymorph TTPyr(HT), serendipitously obtained at high temperature but stable also at room temperature, whose non&#8208;centrosymmetric structure guarantees an SHG efficiency 10 times higher than that of standard urea. Its crystal packing, where only the TT units are strongly rigidified by &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions while the Pyr moieties possess partial conformational freedom, is responsible for the observed dual fluorescence. The potentialities of TTPyr for bioimaging have been successfully established.

         <title>&#8220;Anti&#8208;electrostatic&#8221; Halogen Bonding between Ions of Like Charge</title>

This article provides an overview on halogen bonding (the noncovalent interaction between Lewis acidic halogen substituents and Lewis bases) between ions of like charge. Next to theoretical studies, experimental examples in the solid state and in solution are covered and a comparison with other interactions is provided.







Abstract
Halogen bonding occurs between molecules featuring Lewis acidic halogen substituents and Lewis bases. It is often rationalized as a predominantly electrostatic interaction and thus interactions between ions of like charge (e.&#8201;g., of anionic halogen bond donors with halides) seem counter&#8208;intuitive. Herein, we provide an overview on such complexes. First, theoretical studies are described and their findings are compared. Next, experimental evidences are presented in the form of crystal structure database analyses, recent examples of strong &#8220;anti&#8208;electrostatic&#8221; halogen bonding in crystals, and the observation of such interactions also in solution. We then compare these complexes to select examples of &#8220;counter&#8208;intuitive&#8221; adducts formed by other interactions, like hydrogen bonding. Finally, we comment on key differences between charge&#8208;transfer and electrostatic polarization.

Royal, and co&#8208;workers in their Full Paper (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202103003). Such chemical functionalization allows an efficient photo&#8208;isomerization of the compound to its corresponding cyclophanediene isomer (center) when irradiated with red light. This photochrome can also play the role of oxygen photosensitizer and is able to reversibly trap singlet oxygen in the form of endoperoxide derivatives (right) when illuminated at room temperature under aerobic conditions.

Myxobacteria are not only known for their complex &#8220;social behavior&#8221; including the formation of fruiting bodies, but also for being a prolific source of natural products. We describe the discovery and isolation of the myxofacycline natural product family, which feature either an isoxazole, a 4&#8208;pyrimidinole or a 1,2&#8208;dihydropyrrol&#8208;3&#8208;one heterocycle. Intriguingly, mutagenesis of the producer strain and heterologous expression of the identified biosynthetic genes revealed that all three heterocycles originate from the same biosynthetic pathway, thus suggesting an unique biochemistry to synthesize (secondary) metabolites with exceptional scaffolds and heterocycles. More information can be found in the Full Paper by R. M&#252;ller et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202103095).

         <title>Cover Feature: Variable Luminescence and Chromaticity of Homoleptic Frameworks of the Lanthanides together with Pyridylpyrazolates (Chem. Eur. J. 67/2021)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 67, Page 16526-16526, December 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
White&#8208;light emission can be achieved, according to the RGB concept, by deliberate mixing of different trivalent Ln3+ ions in homoleptic Ln&#8208;coordination polymers. Thereby, single&#8208;color emitters can be tuned to an additive chromaticity of red (Eu3+), green (Tb3+), and blue (backbone) to give white light. More information can be found in the Full Paper by K. M&#252;ller&#8208;Buschbaum et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202103068).

         <title>Frontispiece: &#8220;Anti&#8208;electrostatic&#8221; Halogen Bonding between Ions of Like Charge</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 67, December 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Halogen bonding, the sister noncovalent interaction to hydrogen bonding, usually utilizes cationic or neutral halogenated Lewis acids. The application of anionic halogen bond donors seems counter&#8208;intuitive, particularly in adducts with anionic Lewis bases: the electrostatic potentials of the isolated compounds seem to predict that such complexes are not feasible. For an overview on such &#8220;anti&#8208;electrostatic&#8221; halogen bonds, see the Concept review by S.&#8197;V. Rosokha, S.&#8197;M. Huber et&#8197;al. on page&#8197;16530.

A bipyridine&#8208;modified DNA three&#8208;way junction (3WJ) structure has been synthesized from three DNA strands modified with a bipyridine (bpy) ligand via a stable amide linker. The bpy&#8208;modified 3WJ was thermally stabilized by the formation of an interstrand NiII(bpy)3 complex. Structural induction of the 3WJs and the duplexes was achieved by adding or removing NiII ions. NiII&#8208;mediated self&#8208;sorting of 3WJs was also demonstrated by using the bpy&#8208;modified strands and their unmodified counterparts. More information can be found in the Full Paper by Y. Takezawa, S. Sakakibara, and M. Shionoya (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202102977).

         <title>Hydrophobic Metal&#8722;Organic Frameworks and Derived Composites for Microelectronics Applications</title>

Don't rain on my parade: Hydrophobic metal&#8722;organic frameworks (MOFs) and derived composites for microelectronics applications are highlighted. Several methodologies including the incorporation of long alkyl chains and fluorinated linkers, doping with redox&#8208;active species, etc., to produce hydrophobic MOFs with improved dielectric and conductivity properties are discussed.







Abstract
The extraordinary characteristic features of metal&#8722;organic frameworks (MOFs) make them applicable for use in a variety of fields but their conductivity in microelectronics over a wide relative humidity (RH) range has not been extensively explored. To achieve good performance, MOFs must be stable in water, i.&#8201;e., under humid conditions. However, the design of ultrastable hydrophobic MOFs with high conductivity for use in microelectronics as conducting and dielectric materials remains a challenge. In this Review, we discuss applications of an emerging class of hydrophobic MOFs with respect to their use as active sensor coatings, tunable low&#8208;&#954; dielectrics and conductivity, which provide high&#8208;level roadmap for stimulating the next steps toward the development and implementation of hydrophobic MOFs for use in microelectronic devices. Several methodologies including the incorporation of long alkyl chain and fluorinated linkers, doping of redox&#8208;active 7,7,8,8&#8208;tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ), the use of guest molecules, and conducting polymers or carbon materials in the pores or surface of MOFs have been utilized to produce hydrophobic MOFs. The contact angle of a water droplet and a coating can be used to evaluate the degree of hydrophobicity of the surface of a MOF. These unique advantages enable hydrophobic MOFs to be used as a highly versatile platform for exploring multifunctional porous materials. Classic representative examples of each category are discussed in terms of coordination structures, types of hydrophobic design, and potential microelectronic applications. Lastly, a summary and outlook as concluding remarks in this field are presented. We envision that future research in the area of hydrophobic MOFs promise to provide important breakthroughs in microelectronics applications.

         <title>Recent Advances in the Syntheses and Catalytic Applications of Homonuclear Ru&#8208;, Rh&#8208;, and Ir&#8208;Complexes of CNHC^C Cyclometalated Ligands</title>

Cyclometalation is one of the modest ways to access vibrant metallacycles via C&#8722;H activation. The simple modifications in NHC based ligands and synthesis procedure may generate a library of cyclometalated complexes with varying stereoelectronic properties. This Minireview is the collection of recently (2015&#8211;May 2021) reported examples of Ru&#8208;, Rh&#8208;, and Ir&#8208;based CNHC^C cyclometalated complexes (synthesis and reactivity) and their applications in homogeneous catalysis.







Abstract
In the past few decades, chemistry of cyclometalated species has gained momentum with increased applications in several areas of scientific developments. Cyclometalation reactions result in the formation of stable metallacycles through the generation of metal&#8208;carbon covalent bonds by activating the unreactive Csp2&#8208;H or Csp3&#8208;H bonds. The extra stability gained by the formation of metallacycles enhances their applicability scopes especially in the area of homogeneous catalysis. In the recent research development in this area, NHC ligands (strong &#963;&#8208;donor and generally, weak &#960;&#8208;acceptor) have been found to be one of the most suitable candidates for the intramolecular C&#8722;H activation process which leads to the cyclometalated species. The growth in the area of cyclometalation chemistry that started in the late 20th century is still continuing and in the past few decades, various examples of NHC derived transition metal&#8208;based cyclometalated complexes came into the picture. As covering all the reported literatures in this area (includes mainly late transition metals) will exceed the limits of minireview, we restricted ourselves to the recent (2015 &#8211; May 2021) examples of the most common Ru&#8208;, Rh&#8208;, and Ir&#8208;based CNHC^C cyclometalated complexes and their applications in various homogeneous catalytic conversions such as transfer hydrogenation, amidation, oxidation of alcohols, annulations, and so forth.

In this minireview, the general thermodynamics for the formation of intermetallics have been discussed, followed by the introduction of two main approaches for the synthesis of intermetallics and the corresponding techniques. Then, the application of intermetallics in electrocatalysis has been illustrated case by case. Finally, perspectives on the development of intermetallics and the related catalysis have been proposed.







Abstract
Characterized by long&#8208;range atomic ordering, well&#8208;defined stoichiometry, and controlled crystal structure, intermetallics have attracted increasing attention in the area of chemical synthesis and catalytic applications. Liquid&#8208;phase synthesis of intermetallics has arisen as the promising methodology due to its precise control over size, shape, and resistance toward sintering compared with the traditional metallurgy. This short review tends to provide perspectives on the liquid&#8208;phase synthesis of intermetallics in terms of both thermodynamics and methodology, as well as its applications in various catalytic reactions. Specifically, basic thermodynamics and kinetics in the synthesis of intermetallics will be first discussed, followed by discussing the main factors that will affect the formation of intermetallics during synthesis. The application of intermetallics in electrocatalysis will be demonstrated case by case at last. We conclude the review with perspectives on the future developments with respect to both synthesis and catalytic applications.

         <title>GPhos Ligand Enables Production of Chiral N&#8208;Arylamines in a Telescoped Transaminase&#8208;Buchwald&#8208;Hartwig Amination Cascade in the Presence of Excess Amine Donor</title>

         <dc:description>
Chiral N&#8208;arylamines were accessed by combining transaminases with the Buchwald&#8208;Hartwig amination (BHA), combining the high enantioselectivity of the former with the efficient arylation ability of palladium. The ligand GPhos was key for the successful arylation of &#945;&#8208;secondary amines in a biphasic water&#8208;toluene system in the presence of excess alanine, achieving overall conversions of up to 89&#8201;% with &gt;99.5&#8201;% ee. No coupling to alanine was observed.







Abstract
The combination of biocatalysis and chemocatalysis can be more powerful than either technique alone. However, combining the two is challenging due to typically very different reaction conditions. Herein, chiral N&#8208;aryl amines, key features of many active pharmaceutical ingredients, are accessed in excellent enantioselectivity (typically&gt;99.5&#8201;% ee) by combining transaminases with the Buchwald&#8208;Hartwig amination. By employing a bi&#8208;phasic buffer&#8208;toluene system as well as the ligand GPhos, the telescoped cascade proceeded with up to 89&#8201;% overall conversion in the presence of excess alanine. No coupling to alanine was observed.

By using a chiral directing group, an asymmetric rhodium(III)&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H bond addition to aldimines followed by intramolecular cyclization to form chiral isoindolinones has been achieved (up to 68&#8201;% yield, up to 93&#8201;%&#8201;ee). A three&#8208;component variant that resembles Mannich reaction was also realized (41&#8201;% yield, 83&#8201;%&#8201;ee). Product elaborations and preliminary mechanistic studies were described.

         <title>Kinetic Stabilization of Blue&#8208;Emissive Anthracenes: Phenylene Bridging Works Best</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 67, Page 16606-16610, December 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
In attempts at kinetically stabilizing blue&#8208;emissive anthracenes a series of 9,10&#8208;biarylated derivatives were investigated. Bis&#8208;meta&#8208;terphenylyl substitution highly increased photochemical and photooxidative stability. Ring closure to [6]cyclo&#8208;meta&#8208;hexaphenylene bridged anthracene increased protection even further resulting in an additional stabilization.







Abstract
In attempts at kinetically stabilizing blue&#8208;emissive anthracenes, a series of 9,10&#8208;diaryl substituted derivatives were tested for their photochemical and photooxidative persistence. A major breakthrough in light fastness comes from a new bis&#8208;meta&#8208;terphenylyl substituted anthracene which is much superior to industrially relevant 9,10&#8208;biarylated anthracenes. The key issue is the steric shielding of the anthracene core. Further, intramolecular ring closure via Yamamoto coupling furnished a doubly bridged anthracene as a &#8220;self&#8208;encapsulated&#8221; sky&#8208;blue emitter which is most resistant to photodegradation. The improved stabilization was corroborated by time&#8208;resolved irradiation experiments and rationalized by X&#8208;ray crystallography.

         <title>The Preparation of a Water&#8208;Soluble Phospholate&#8208;Based Macrocycle for Constructing Artificial Light&#8208;Harvesting Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 67, Page 16601-16605, December 1, 2021. </description>

A novel water&#8208;soluble phospholate&#8208;based macrocycle (WPCTX) was prepared with satisfying yield and its host&#8208;guest properties were investigated. Based on this, tetraphenylethylene guest molecules (G) self&#8208;assembled with WPCTX to form WPCTX&#8835;G nanoparticles (NPs) acting as donors in water. Moreover, two hydrophobic fluorescent dyes, Eosin Y (ESY) and Nile red (NiR), were encapsulated in NPs to construct artificial light&#8208;harvesting systems with high antenna effect.







Abstract
On the basis of cyclotrixylohydroquinoylene (CTX), a novel water&#8208;soluble phospholate&#8208;based CTX derivative (WPCTX) was prepared with facile synthetic procedure and satisfying yield. Several model guest molecules were selected to investigate WPCTX&#8242;s host&#8208;guest properties. Based on the study of the host and model guest complexation, a tetraphenylethylene derivative from model guest was employed as a guest molecule (G) to form WPCTX&#8835;G nanoparticles (NPs) with WPCTX through further supramolecular self&#8208;assembly in water. Moreover, a hydrophobic fluorescent dye, Eosin Y(ESY) or Nile red (NiR), was encapsulated in WPCTX&#8835;G NPs to construct two types of artificial light&#8208;harvesting systems. Their high antenna effect demonstrated such NPs successfully mimicked light&#8208;harvesting systems in nature.

         <title>Remote Radical Desaturation of Unactivated C&#8722;H Bonds in Amides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 67, Page 16621-16625, December 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A copper&#8208;catalyzed/silver&#8208;promoted desaturation method is described which allows the regioselective conversion of various unactivated N&#8208;alkylamides at remote sites to the corresponding N&#8208;alkenylamides via N&#8208;centred radical mediated 1,5 hydrogen atom transfer, metal&#8208;mediated oxidation and deprotonation. The transformation shows good functional group tolerance and can be used for late&#8208;stage desaturation of drug derivatives and biologically more relevant compounds.







Abstract
Desaturation of inert aliphatic C&#8722;H bonds in alkanes to form the corresponding alkenes is challenging. In this communication, a new and practical strategy for remote site&#8208;selective desaturation of amides via radical chemistry is reported. The readily installed N&#8208;allylsulfonylamide moiety serves as an N radical precursor. Intramolecular 1,5&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer from an inert C&#8722;H bond to the N&#8208;radical generates a translocated C&#8208;radical which is subsequently oxidized and deprotonated to give the corresponding alkene. The commercially available methanesulfonyl chloride is used as reagent and a Cu/Ag&#8208;couple as oxidant. The remote desaturation is realized on different types of unactivated sp3&#8208;C&#8722;H bonds. The potential synthetic utility of this method is further demonstrated by the dehydrogenation of natural product derivatives and drugs.

         <title>Dual Activation of Unsaturated Amides with Schwartz's Reagent: A Diastereoselective Access to Cyclopentanols and N,O&#8208;Dimethylcyclopentylhydroxylamines.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The concomitant generation of a nucleophilic and an electrophilic site from unsaturated Weinreb amide by using Cp2Zr(H)Cl) as the unique reagent was developed to promote a cyclisation reaction. The access to trans&#8208;2&#8208;substituted cyclopentanols or cyclopentylhydroxylamines can be selectively driven by a judicious choice of the cyclisation promotor. An access to cis&#8208;3&#8208;substituted is also described.







Abstract
The diastereoselective access to cyclopentanols and N,O&#8208;dimethylcyclopentylhydroxylamines from 4&#8208;pentenoic acid&#8208;derived Weinreb amides is described. Based on the concomitant generation of both the nucleophilic and the electrophilic poles by hydrozirconation of the amide and the C=C double bond, the cyclisation may be tuned towards cyclopentanols or N,O&#8208;dimethylcyclopentylhydroxylamines depending on the ring&#8208;closure promotor. An extension to cis 3&#8208;substituted N,O&#8208;dimethylcyclohexylhydroxylamines is also presented.

         <title>TADF&#8208;Sensitized Fluorescent Enantiomers: A New Strategy for High&#8208;Efficiency Circularly Polarized Electroluminescence**
</title>

         <dc:description>
A new strategy of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF)&#8208;sensitized CPL (TSCP) is proposed to realize efficient circularly polarized electroluminescence (CPEL) by taking TADF molecule as sensitizer to improve exciton utilization and CP&#8208;FL molecule as emitter to realize CPEL. In this article, we highlight the research status of CPEL and CP&#8208;TADF, mainly focus on the concept of TSCP and its applications in CP&#8208;OLEDs, and finally give the prospects of TSCP in CPEL research area.







Abstract
A promising strategy of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) sensitized circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) has been proposed for improving the electroluminescence efficiencies of circularly polarized fluorescent emitters. Compared with chiral TADF emitters which suffer from the dilemma of small &#916;EST accompanied by small kr, the TADF&#8208;sensitized CPL (TSCP) strategy using TADF molecules as sensitizers and CP&#8208;FL molecules as emitters might be the most promising method to construct high&#8208;performance circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (CP&#8208;OLEDs). Consequently, by taking advantage of the theoretically 100&#8201;% exciton utilization of TADF sensitizers, especially, by designing CP&#8208;FL emitters with high PLQY, narrow FWHM and large glum values, TSCP&#8208;type CP&#8208;OLEDs with excellent overall performances can be realized.

         <title>Perfluoroaryl and Perfluoroheteroaryl Reagents as Emerging New Tools for Peptide Synthesis, Modification and Bioconjugation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Perfluoroaromatic and perfluoroheteroaromatic reagents have emerged in recent years as powerful reagents for peptide and protein modification. Dominated by their regio&#8208; and chemoselective nucleophilic aromatic substitution chemistry under mild conditions, they have been used in peptide synthesis, tagging, cyclisation, stapling and protein bioconjugation.







Abstract
Peptides and proteins are becoming increasingly valuable as medicines, diagnostic agents and as tools for biomedical sciences. Much of this has been underpinned by the emergence of new methods for the manipulation and augmentation of native biomolecules. Perfluoroaromatic reagents are perhaps one of the most diverse and exciting tools with which to modify peptides and proteins, due principally to their nucleophilic substitution chemistry, high electron deficiency and the ability for their reactivity to be tuned towards specific nucleophiles. As discussed in this minireview, in recent years, perfluoroaromatic reagents have found applications as protecting groups or activating groups in peptide synthesis and as orthogonal handles for peptide modification. Furthermore, they have applications in chemoselective &#8216;tagging&#8217;, stapling and bioconjugation of peptides and proteins, as well as tuning of &#8216;drug&#8208;like&#8217; properties. This review will also explore possible future applications of these reagents in biological chemistry.

         <title>A Series of Polyoxometalate&#8208;Viologen Photochromic Materials for UV Probing, Amine Detecting and Inkless and Erasable Printing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three polyoxometalate&#8208;viologen Compounds&#8197;were designed and constructed by using two viologen ligands. Compounds&#8197;1&#8211;3 show excellent photochromic features with fast photoresponse under irradiation of ultraviolet light with different degrees of color changes. These Compounds&#8197;exhibit amine detecting and inkless and erasable printing properties, and they can be prepared into a mixed matrix film as a good UV detector.







Abstract
In this work, by using two kinds of viologen ligands three POM&#8208;based Compounds&#8197;were obtained under hydrothermal conditions, namely [AgI(bmypd)0.5(&#946;&#8208;Mo8O26)0.5] (1) (bmypd&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2Cl=1,1&#8242;&#8208;[Biphenyl&#8208;4,4&#8242;&#8208;bis(methylene)]bis(4,4&#8242;&#8208;bipyridyinium)dichloride), [AgI2(bypy)4(HSiW12O40)2]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;14H2O (2) and [AgI(bypy)(&#947;&#8208;Mo8O26)0.5] (3) (bypy&#8901;Cl=1&#8208;Benzyl&#8208;4,4&#8242;&#8208;bipyridyinium chloride). The structures were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT&#8211;IR), Powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (PXRD), X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Compounds&#8197;1&#8211;3 show excellent photochromic ability with fast photoresponse under the irradiation of ultraviolet light with different degrees of color changes. So compounds&#8197;1&#8211;3 can be used as visible ultraviolet detectors. Compounds&#8197;1&#8211;3 also possess photoluminescence properties with fast and excellent fluorescence quenching effect. Compounds&#8197;1&#8211;3 also can be used as inkless and erasable printing materials with suspensions of 1&#8211;3 applied to filter paper. Compounds&#8197;1&#8211;3 can also produce color changes in amine vapor environment, especially in an NH3 atmosphere. Compounds&#8197;1&#8211;3 can be used as organic amine detectors.

         <title>Preparation of Polyfunctionalized Aromatic Nitriles from Aryl Oxazolines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aryl nitriles from oxazolines: We report a new method for for preparing highly functionalized tri&#8208;, tetra&#8208; and penta&#8208;substituted aromatic nitriles by using two successive magnesiations with sBu2Mg in toluene followed by trapping reactions with a broad range of electrophiles followed by an efficient conversion of the oxazolyl&#8208;directing group to a nitrile function by using oxalyl chloride and catalytic amounts of DMF (50&#8201;&#176;C, 4&#8197;h).







Abstract
A selective ortho,ortho&#8217;&#8208;functionalization of readily available aryl oxazolines by two successive magnesiations with sBu2Mg in toluene followed by trapping reactions with electrophiles, such as (hetero)aryl iodides or bromides, iodine, tosyl cyanide, ethyl cyanoformate or allylic bromides (39 examples, 62&#8211;99&#8201;% yield) is reported. Treatment of these aryl oxazolines with excess oxalyl chloride and catalytic amounts of DMF (50&#8201;&#176;C, 4&#8197;h) provided the corresponding nitriles (36 examples, 73&#8211;99&#8201;% yield). Conversions of these nitriles to valuable heterocycles are reported, and a tentative mechanism is proposed.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Aryl nitriles from oxazolines&lt;/b&gt;: We report a new method for for preparing highly functionalized tri-, tetra- and penta-substituted aromatic nitriles by using two successive magnesiations with &lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt;Bu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Mg in toluene followed by trapping reactions with a broad range of electrophiles followed by an efficient conversion of the oxazolyl-directing group to a nitrile function by using oxalyl chloride and catalytic amounts of DMF (50&#8201;&#176;C, 4&#8197;h).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A selective &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;ortho&#8217;&lt;/i&gt;-functionalization of readily available aryl oxazolines by two successive magnesiations with sBu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Mg in toluene followed by trapping reactions with electrophiles, such as (hetero)aryl iodides or bromides, iodine, tosyl cyanide, ethyl cyanoformate or allylic bromides (39 examples, 62&#8211;99&#8201;% yield) is reported. Treatment of these aryl oxazolines with excess oxalyl chloride and catalytic amounts of DMF (50&#8201;&#176;C, 4&#8197;h) provided the corresponding nitriles (36 examples, 73&#8211;99&#8201;% yield). Conversions of these nitriles to valuable heterocycles are reported, and a tentative mechanism is proposed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Elucidating the Supramolecular Copolymerization of N&#8208; and C&#8208;Centered Benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;Tricarboxamides: The Role of Parallel and Antiparallel Packing of Amide Groups in the Copolymer Microstructure</title>

         <dc:description>
Copolymerizing N&#8208; and C&#8208;centered BTAs in nonpolar solutions affords helical, H&#8208;bond&#8208;stabilized supramolecular copolymers with a blocky microstructure. In contrast, in bulk, lamellar structures form and long&#8208;range order is lost. This is a result of the antiparallel H&#8208;bonds between N&#8208; and C&#8208;centered BTAs, which are less stable than the parallel H&#8208;bonds formed in the homopolymers.







Abstract
An in&#8208;depth study of the supramolecular copolymerization behavior of N&#8208; and C&#8208;centered benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;tricarboxamides (N&#8208; and C&#8208;BTAs) has been conducted in methylcyclohexane and in the solid state. The connectivity of the amide groups in the BTAs differs, and mixing N&#8208; and C&#8208;BTAs results in supramolecular copolymers with a blocky microstructure in solution. The blocky microstructure results from the formation of weaker and less organized, antiparallel hydrogen bonds between N&#8208; and C&#8208;BTAs. In methylcyclohexane, the helical threefold hydrogen&#8208;bonding network present in C&#8208; and N&#8208;BTAs is retained in the mixtures. In the solid state, in contrast, the hydrogen bonds of pure BTAs as well as their mixtures organize in a sheet&#8208;like pattern, and in the mixtures long&#8208;range order is lost. Drop&#8208;casting to kinetically trap the solution microstructures shows that C&#8208;BTAs retain the helical hydrogen bonds, but N&#8208;BTAs immediately adopt the sheet&#8208;like pattern, a direct consequence of the lower stabilization energy of the helical hydrogen bonds. In the copolymers, the stability of the helical aggregates depends on the copolymer composition, and helical aggregates are only preserved when a high amount of C&#8208;BTAs is present. The method outlined here is generally applicable to elucidate the copolymerization behavior of supramolecular monomers both in solution as well as in the solid state.

         <title>Steric Repulsion Induced Conformational Switch in Supramolecular Structures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular strain engineering of dodecasubstituted picket&#8208;fence porphyrins led us to develop a method for selective atropisomeric conversion based on the steric clashes. The tension rigidified architecture revealed distinct spectroscopic alterations with vibrant colorimetric changes making it a first case study where the porphyrin&#8208;based photometric response is induced only by atropisomer configurations.







Abstract
Inspired by the rigidified architecture of &#8216;picket&#8208;fence&#8217; systems, we propose a strategy utilizing strain to impose intramolecular tension in already peripherally overcrowded structures leading to selective atropisomeric conversion. Employing this approach, tuneable shape&#8208;persistent porphyrin conformations were acquired exhibiting distinctive supramolecular nanostructures based on the orientation of the peripheral groups. The intrinsic assemblies driven by non&#8208;covalent bonding interactions form supramolecular polymers while encapsulating small molecules in parallel channels or solvent&#8208;accessible voids. The developed molecular strain engineering methodologies combined with synthetic approaches have allowed the introduction of the pivalate units creating a highly strained molecular skeleton. Changes in the absorption spectrum indicated the presence of severe steric repulsions between the peripheral groups which were confirmed by single crystal X&#8208;ray analysis. To release the steric strain introduced by the peripheral units, thermal equilibration strategies were used to selectively convert the most abundant atropisomer to the desirable minor one.

         <dc:description>
Two&#8208; and three&#8208;dimensional structures can be assembled from &#960;&#8208;extended triazoles, which act as versatile tectons capable of metal coordination, hydrogen bonding, and &#960;&#8208;stacking interactions. Infinite stacks of cyclic hydrogen&#8208;bonded tetrads or triads are obtained in the crystal, with substitution controlling the size of the assembly. In spite of their bulkiness, &#960;&#8208;extended triazoles easily form pentanuclear zinc(II) Kuratowski complexes, characterized by concave outer surfaces and moderate solid&#8208;state porosity.







Abstract
&#960;&#8208;Extended acenaphtho[1,2&#8208;d][1,2,3]triazoles, the unsubstituted Anta&#8208;H and its di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl derivative Dibanta&#8208;H, as well as 5,6,7,8&#8208;tetrahydro&#8208;1H&#8208;naphtho[2,3&#8208;d][1,2,3]triazole Cybta&#8208;H were obtained in concise syntheses. In the solid state, Dibanta&#8208;H forms an unprecedented hydrogen&#8208;bonded cyclic tetrad, stabilized by dispersion interactions of the bulky tBu substituents, whereas a cyclic triad was found in the crystal structure of Anta&#8208;H. These cyclic assemblies form infinite slipped stacks in the crystals. Evidence for analogous hydrogen&#8208;bonded self&#8208;assembly in solution was provided by low&#8208;temperature NMR spectroscopy and computational analyses. Kuratowski&#8208;type pentanuclear complexes [Zn5Cl4(Dibanta)6] and [Zn5Cl4(Cybta)6] were prepared from the respective triazoles. In the Dibanta complexes, the &#960;&#8208;aromatic surfaces of the ligands extend from the edges of the tetrahedral Zn5 core, yielding an enlarged structure with significant internal molecular free volume and red&#8208;shifted fluorescence.

         <title>Developing Efficient Small Molecule Acceptors with sp2&#8208;Hybridized Nitrogen at Different Positions by Density Functional Theory Calculations, Molecular Dynamics Simulations and Machine Learning</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multidimensional modelling is performed to envision the structural changes at atomic and molecular level. sp2&#8208;hybridized nitrogen is substituted at the inner or the outmost position of central core, side chain, and terminal group of ITIC for improving the device performance. It is found that nitrogen substitution at end&#8208;capping group is a better strategy to design efficient small molecule acceptors.







Abstract
Chemical structure of small molecule acceptors determines their performance in organic solar cells. Multiscale simulations are necessary to avoid trial&#8208;and&#8208;error based design, ultimately to save time and resources. In current study, the effect of sp2&#8208;hybridized nitrogen substitution at the inner or the outmost position of central core, side chain, and terminal group of small molecule acceptors is investigated using multiscale computational modelling. Quantum chemical analysis is used to study the electronic behavior. Nitrogen substitution at end&#8208;capping has significantly decreased the electron&#8208;reorganization energy. No big change is observed in transfer integral and excited state behavior. However, nitrogen substitution at terminal group position is good way to improve electron&#8208;mobility. Power conversion efficiency (PCE) of newly designed acceptors is predicted using machine learning. Molecular dynamics simulations are also performed to explore the dynamics of acceptor and their blends with PBDB&#8208;T polymer donor. Florgy&#8208;Huggins parameter is calculated to study the mixing of designed small molecule acceptors with PBDB&#8208;T. Radial distribution function has indicated that PBDB&#8208;T has a closer packing with N3 and N4. From all analysis, it is found that nitrogen substitution at end&#8208;capping group is a better strategy to design efficient small molecule acceptors.

Large&#8208;but&#8208;flexible palladium precatalysts have been rationally designed to enable the challenging Buchwald&#8208;Hartwig amination of coordinating heterocycles. This robust new class of precatalysts permits cross&#8208;coupling of a variety of heterocycles with aryl, alkyl and heteroarylamines, including historically challenging oxazoles and thiazoles as well as electron&#8208;deficient heterocycles containing multiple heteroatoms, under practical aerobic conditions. Studies on the ligand structure and electronic properties of the carbene center are also reported.







Abstract
A new class of large&#8208;but&#8208;flexible Pd&#8208;BIAN&#8208;NHC catalysts (BIAN=acenaphthoimidazolylidene, NHC=N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene) has been rationally designed to enable the challenging Buchwald&#8208;Hartwig amination of coordinating heterocycles. This robust class of BIAN&#8208;NHC catalysts permits cross&#8208;coupling under practical aerobic conditions of a variety of heterocycles with aryl, alkyl, and heteroarylamines, including historically challenging oxazoles and thiazoles as well as electron&#8208;deficient heterocycles containing multiple heteroatoms with BIAN&#8208;INon (N,N&#8242;&#8208;bis(2,6&#8208;di(4&#8208;heptyl)phenyl)&#8208;7H&#8208;acenaphtho[1,2&#8208;d]imidazol&#8208;8&#8208;ylidene) as the most effective ligand. Studies on the ligand structure and electronic properties of the carbene center are reported. The study should facilitate the discovery of even more active catalyst systems based on the unique BIAN&#8208;NHC scaffold.

         <title>PTFE/EP Reinforced MOF/SiO2 Composite as a Superior Mechanically Robust Superhydrophobic Agent towards Corrosion Protection, Self&#8208;Cleaning and Anti&#8208;Icing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The robust, highly durable and multi&#8208;functional superhydrophobic surfaces were fabricated by spray coating technique on various substrates, including metals and non&#8208;metals such as steel 304, steel 306&#8197;L, fiber, cardboard, and glass.







Abstract
Organic resin cross&#8208;linking ZIF&#8208;67/SiO2 superhydrophobic (SHPB) multilayer coating was successfully fabricated on metal substrate. The perfluoro&#8208;octyl&#8208;triethoxy silane (POTS) modified ZIF&#8208;67 and SiO2 coating was applied on primary coated polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and epoxy resin (EP) via spray coating method. Here, we present that the robust superhydrophobicity can be realized by structuring surfaces at two different length scales, with a nanostructure design to provide water repellence and a microstructure design to provide durability. The as&#8208;fabricated multilayer coating displayed superior water&#8208;repellence (CA=167.4&#176;), chemical robustness (pH=1&#8211;14) and mechanical durability undergoing 120th linear abrasion or 35th rotatory abrasion cycle. By applying different acidic and basic corrosive media and various weathering conditions, it can still maintain superior&#8208;hydrophobicity. To get a better insight of interaction between inhibitor molecules and metal surface, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed, showing lower energy gap and increased binding energy of ZPS/SiO2/PTFE/EP (ZPS=ZIF&#8208;67+POTS) multilayer coating compared to the ZIF&#8208;67/SiO2/PTFE/EP, thereby supporting the experimental findings. Additionally, such coatings may be useful for applications such as anti&#8208;corrosion, self&#8208;cleaning, and anti&#8208;icing multi&#8208;functionalities.

         <title>Highly Efficient Ir(III)&#8208;Coumarin Photo&#8208;Redox Catalyst for Synergetic Multi&#8208;Mode Cancer Photo&#8208;Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Four novel Ir(III) photo&#8208;catalysts (Ir1&#8211;Ir4) were synthesized and applied for photocatalytic cancer therapy. Upon blue and green light irradiation, these photocatalysts generated singlet oxygen and induced rapid photo&#8208;catalytic oxidation of the cellular coenzymes NAD(P)H. Ir2 triggered promising photo&#8208;induced anticancer activity via induction of intracellular redox imbalance and exhibited ideal in&#8197;vivo photo&#8208;induced catalytic anticancer activity.







Abstract
Four photo&#8208;catalysts of the general formula [Ir(CO6/ppy)2(L)]Cl where CO6=coumarin 6 (Ir1&#8211;Ir3), ppy=2&#8208;phenylpyridine (Ir4), L=4&#8242;&#8208;(3,5&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphenyl)&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8201;:&#8201;6&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;terpyridine (Ir1), 4&#8242;&#8208;(3,5&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)&#8208;2,2&#8242;&#8201;:&#8201;6&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;terpyridine (Ir2 and Ir4), and 4&#8208;([2,2&#8242;&#8201;:&#8201;6&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8242;&#8208;terpyridin]&#8208;4&#8242;&#8208;yl)&#8208;N,N&#8208;dimethylaniline (Ir3) were synthesized and characterized. These photostable photo&#8208;catalysts (Ir1&#8211;Ir3) showed strong visible light absorption between 400&#8211;550&#8197;nm. Upon light irradiation (465 and 525&#8197;nm), Ir1&#8211;Ir3 generated singlet oxygen and induced rapidly photo&#8208;catalytic oxidation of cellular coenzymes NAD(P)H. Ir1&#8211;Ir3 showed time&#8208;dependent cellular uptake with excellent intracellular retention efficiency. Upon green light irradiation (525&#8197;nm), Ir2 provided a much higher photo&#8208;index (PI=793) than the clinically used photosensitizer, 5&#8208;aminolevulinicacid (5&#8208;ALA, PI&gt;30) against HeLa cancer cells. The observed necro&#8208;apoptotic anticancer activity of Ir2 was due to the Ir2 triggered photo&#8208;induced intracellular redox imbalance (by NAD(P)H oxidation and ROS generation) and change in the mitochondrial membrane potential. Remarkably, Ir2 showed in&#8197;vivo photo&#8208;induced catalytic anticancer activity in mouse models.

         <title>Crown Ether Host&#8208;Guest Molecular Ferroelectrics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Crown&#8208;ether&#8208;based molecular ferroelectrics are attractive for the host&#8208;guest structure, where the guest cation is anchored in the host crown ether and the anion acts as the counterion. Their crystal structure, phase transition and ferroelectric properties are discussed in this minireview. Additionally, an outlook on the chemical design of high&#8208;performance crown ether host&#8208;guest molecular ferroelectrics is given.







Abstract
In recent years, molecular ferroelectrics have received great attention due to their low weight, mechanical flexibility, easy preparation and excellent ferroelectric properties. Among them, crown&#8208;ether&#8208;based molecular ferroelectrics, which are typically composed of the host crown ethers, the guest cations anchored in the crown ethers, and the counterions, are of great interest because of the host&#8208;guest structure. Such a structure allows the components to occur order&#8208;disorder transition easily, which is beneficial for inducing ferroelectric phase transition. Herein, we summarized the research progress of crown ether host&#8208;guest molecular ferroelectrics, focusing on their crystal structure, phase transition, ferroelectric&#8208;related properties. In view of the small spontaneous polarization and uniaxial nature, we outlook the chemical design strategies for obtaining high&#8208;performance crown&#8208;ether&#8208;based molecular ferroelectrics. This minireview will be of guiding significance for the future exploration of crown ether host&#8208;guest molecular ferroelectrics.

         <title>The Appeal of Small Molecules for Practical Nonlinear Optics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Donor&#8208;acceptor substitution in small molecules with a compact &#960;&#8208;conjugated system leads to record&#8208;high molecular nonlinearities in small sizes. A dense monolithic assembly of such molecules can have extraordinarily strong nonlinear optical properties. The ability to vapor deposit such small molecule materials makes them highly competitive for adding all&#8208;optical switching and/or electro&#8208;optic functionality to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art integrated photonics.







Abstract
Small organic molecules with a &#960;&#8208;conjugated system that consists of only a few double or triple bonds can have significantly smaller optical excitation energies when equipped with donor and acceptor groups, which raises the quantum limits to the molecular polarizabilities. As a consequence, third&#8208;order nonlinear optical polarizabilities become orders of magnitude larger than those of molecules of similar size without donor&#8208;acceptor substitution. This enables strong third&#8208;order nonlinear optical effects (as high as 1000 times those of silica glass) in dense, amorphous monolithic assemblies. These properties, accompanied by the possibility of deposition from the vapor phase and of electric&#8208;field poling at higher temperatures, make the resulting materials competitive towards adding an active nonlinear optical or electro&#8208;optic functionality to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art integrated photonics platforms.

         <title>DEB&#8208;FAPy&#8208;dG Adducts of 1,3&#8208;Butadiene: Synthesis, Structural Characterization, and Formation in 1,2,3,4&#8208;Diepoxybutane Treated DNA**

         <dc:description>
Formamidopyrimidnes (FAPy) are highly mutagenic DNA lesions. Here we describe the first synthesis and complete structural characterization of a diepoxybutane (DEB) derived formamidopyrimidine of dG (DEB&#8208;FAPy&#8208;dG). An isotope dilution nanoLC&#8208;ESI+&#8208;HRMS/MS method was developed and DEB&#8208;FAPy&#8208;dG adducts were detected in DEB treated DNA.







Abstract
Metabolic activation of the human carcinogen 1,3&#8208;butadiene (BD) by cytochrome 450 monooxygenases gives rise to a genotoxic diepoxide, 1,2,3,4&#8208;diepoxybutane (DEB). This reactive electrophile alkylates guanine bases in DNA to produce N7&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;3,4&#8208;epoxy&#8208;1&#8208;yl)&#8208;dG (N7&#8208;DE&#8208;dG) adducts. Because of the positive charge at the N7 position of the purine heterocycle, N7&#8208;DEB&#8208;dG adducts are inherently unstable and can undergo spontaneous depurination or base&#8208;catalyzed imidazole ring opening to give N6&#8208;[2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;D&#8208;erythro&#8208;pentofuranosyl]&#8208;2,6&#8208;diamino&#8208;3,4&#8208;dihydro&#8208;4&#8208;oxo&#8208;5&#8208;N&#8208;1&#8208;(oxiran&#8208;2&#8208;yl)propan&#8208;1&#8208;ol&#8208;formamidopyrimidine (DEB&#8208;FAPy&#8208;dG) adducts. Here we report the first synthesis and structural characterization of DEB&#8208;FAPy&#8208;dG adducts. Authentic standards of DEB&#8208;FAPy&#8208;dG and its 15N3&#8208;labeled analogue were used for the development of a quantitative nanoLC&#8208;ESI+&#8208;HRMS/MS method, allowing for adduct detection in DEB&#8208;treated calf thymus DNA. DEB&#8208;FAPy&#8208;dG formation in DNA was dependent on DEB concentration and pH, with higher numbers observed under alkaline conditions.

         <title>Predictive Catalysis in Olefin Metathesis with Ru&#8208;based Catalysts with Annulated C60 Fullerenes in the N&#8208;heterocyclic Carbenes</title>

Annulating C60 fullerenes in NHC ligands enhances the catalysis of Ru&#8208;based olefin metathesis catalysis.







Abstract
Predictive catalysis must be the tool that does not replace experiments, but acts as a selective agent, so that synthetic strategies of maximum profitability are used in the laboratory in a surgical way. Here, nanotechnology has been used in olefin metathesis from homogeneous Ru&#8208;NHC catalysts, specifically annulating a C60 fullerene to the NHC ligand. Based on results with the C60 in the backbone, a sterile change with respect to the catalysis of the metal center, an attempt has been made to bring C60 closer to the metal, by attaching it to one of the two C&#8722;N bonds of the imidazole group of the SIMes (1,3&#8208;bis(2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenyl)imidazolin&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene) ligand (reference NHC ligand of the 2nd generation Grubbs catalysts) to increase the steric pressure of C60 in the first sphere of reactivity of the metal. The DFT calculated thermodynamics and the kinetics of SIMes&#8208;derived systems show that they are efficient catalysts for olefin metathesis.

         <title>The Shuttling Cascade in Lasso Peptide Benenodin&#8208;1 is Controlled by Non&#8208;Covalent Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Step&#8208;by&#8208;Step: The naturally occurring peptide [1]rotaxane benenodin&#8208;1 undergoes a shuttling cascade under thermal activation and can be switched between four different states in water. The mechanism of wheel translation is reminiscent of synthetically derived molecular shuttles. Switchable peptide rotaxanes pave the way for a new generation of functional mechanically interlocked architectures solely made from biomolecules.







Abstract
The lasso peptide benenodin&#8208;1, a naturally occurring and bacterially produced [1]rotaxane, undergoes a reversible zip tie&#8208;like motion under heat activation, in which a peptidic wheel stepwise translates along a molecular thread in a cascade of &#8220;tail/loop pulling&#8221; equilibria. Conformational and structural analyses of four translational isomers, in solution and in the gas phase, reveal that the equilibrium distribution is controlled by mechanical and non&#8208;covalent forces within the lasso peptide. Furthermore, each dynamic pulling step is accompanied by a major restructuring of the intramolecular hydrogen bonding network between wheel and thread, which affects the peptide's physico&#8208;chemical properties.

         <title>Narrowly&#8208;Distributed Conjugated Polymers Synthesized through Suzuki Polymerization with Palladium(II) N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Complex Confined in Dendritic Mesoporous Silica Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene complex of Pd was embedded in dendritic mesoporous silica nanoparticle support for achieving confined Suzuki polymerization of a variety of monomer combinations to produce rich structural patterned conjugated polymers with narrow molecular weight distribution and high solubility and processibility in common organic solvents.







Abstract
A catalytic heterogenous Suzuki polymerization method was developed by confining the Pd(II)&#8208;catalyzed cross coupling reactions to take place exclusively in the nanochannels of dendritic mesoporous silica nanoparticles. Conjugated polymers with various monomer combinations, including donor&#8208;acceptor structures, were obtained in high yields. The molecular weights of the obtained polymers were well controlled with narrow molecular weight distributions (PDI value down to 1.13). All the polymeric products were highly soluble in common organic solvents, granting them with high processability. All the features of this confined Suzuki polymerization method endow the conjugated polymers great potential in optoelectronic applications.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;N-heterocyclic carbene&lt;/b&gt; complex of Pd was embedded in dendritic mesoporous silica nanoparticle support for achieving confined Suzuki polymerization of a variety of monomer combinations to produce rich structural patterned conjugated polymers with narrow molecular weight distribution and high solubility and processibility in common organic solvents.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A catalytic heterogenous Suzuki polymerization method was developed by confining the Pd(II)-catalyzed cross coupling reactions to take place exclusively in the nanochannels of dendritic mesoporous silica nanoparticles. Conjugated polymers with various monomer combinations, including donor-acceptor structures, were obtained in high yields. The molecular weights of the obtained polymers were well controlled with narrow molecular weight distributions (PDI value down to 1.13). All the polymeric products were highly soluble in common organic solvents, granting them with high processability. All the features of this confined Suzuki polymerization method endow the conjugated polymers great potential in optoelectronic applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Low&#8208;Valent Titanium Species Stabilized with Aluminum/Boron Hydride Fragments</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structure and bonding of bimetallic half&#8208;sandwich titanium(III) and titanium(II) complexes stabilized by boron (BH4&#8722;, BH3Me&#8722;, B2H62&#8722;) or aluminum {(&#956;&#8208;H)2AlXL)} (X=Cl, Br; L=thf, OEt2) hydride ligands are reported. DFT calculations on the hydride&#8208;bridged Ti(II)&#8722;Al compounds reveal a strong electron density donation from the Ti&#8722;Ti bond to the empty s orbitals of the Al atoms. These unprecedented M&#8722;M&#8594;Z type interactions could be common for bi&#8208; or multimetallic low&#8208;valent early transition metal derivatives.







Abstract
Low&#8208;valent titanium species were prepared by reaction of [TiCp*X3] (Cp*=&#951;5&#8208;C5Me5; X=Cl, Br, Me) with LiEH4 (E=Al, B) or BH3(thf), and their structures elucidated by experimental and theoretical methods. The treatment of trihalides [TiCp*X3] with LiAlH4 in ethereal solvents (L) leads to the hydride&#8208;bridged heterometallic complexes [{TiCp*(&#956;&#8208;H)}2{(&#956;&#8208;H)2AlX(L)}2] (L=thf, X=Cl, Br; L=OEt2, X=Cl). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations for those compounds reveal an open&#8208;shell singlet ground state with a Ti&#8722;Ti bond and can be described as titanium(II) species. The theoretical analyses also show strong interactions between the Ti&#8722;Ti bond and the empty s orbitals of the Al atom of the AlH2XL fragments, which behave as &#963;&#8208;accepting (Z&#8208;type) ligands. Analogous reactions of [TiCp*X3] with LiBH4 (2 and 3&#8197;equiv.) in tetrahydrofuran at room temperature and at 85&#8201;&#176;C lead to the titanium(III) compounds [{TiCp*(BH4)(&#956;&#8208;X)}2] (X=Cl, Br) and [{TiCp*(BH4)(&#956;&#8208;BH4)}2], respectively. The treatment of [TiCp*Me3] with 4 and 5&#8197;equiv. of BH3(thf) produces the diamagnetic [{TiCp*(BH3Me)}2(&#956;&#8208;B2H6)] and paramagnetic [{TiCp*(&#956;&#8208;B2H6)}2] complexes, respectively.

         <title>Bioinspired Artificial Photosynthetic Systems</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mimicking photosynthesis using artificial systems, as a means for solar energy conversion and green fuel generation, is one of the holy grails of modern science. This perspective presents the recent advances of our laboratory towards developing artificial photosynthetic systems. In one approach, native photosystems are interfaced with electrodes to yield photobioelectrochemical cells that transform light energy into electrical power. This is exemplified by interfacing photosystem I (PSI) and photosystem II (PSII) as an electrically contacted assembly mimicking the native Z&#8208;scheme, and by the assembly of an electrically wired PSI/glucose oxidase biocatalytic conjugate on an electrode support. Illumination of the functionalized electrodes led to light&#8208;induced generation of electrical power, or to the generation of photocurrents using glucose as the fuel. The second approach introduces supramolecular photosensitizer nucleic acid / electron acceptor complexes as functional modules for effective photoinduced electron transfer stimulating the subsequent biocatalyzed generation of NADPH or the Pt&#8208;nanoparticle&#8208;catalyzed evolution of molecular hydrogen. Application of the DNA machineries for scaling&#8208;up the photosystems is demonstrated. A third approach presents the integration of artificial photosynthetic modules into dynamic nucleic acid networks undergoing reversible reconfiguration or dissipative transient operation in the presence of auxiliary triggers. Control over photoinduced electron transfer reactions and photosynthetic transformations by means of the dynamic networks is demonstrated.</dc:description>

         <title>Acid&#8208;Catalyzed RNA Oligomerization from 3&#8217;,5&#8217;&#8208;cGMP</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heat, protons and a dry crystalline material are the three prerequisites for oligonucleotide synthesis from acid&#8208;form 3&#8242;,5&#8242;&#8208;cyclic guanosine monophosphate monomers. The process is believed to play a role in the abiotic generation of the most ancient RNA molecules on our planet. Now, we show that the reaction is acid&#8208;catalyzed and that the facile crystallization of the monomers is enabled by their distinctly low solubility. The highly ordered supramolecular architecture present in the monomer crystals provides ideal steric conditions for the formation of intermolecular phosphodiester linkages between the cyclic nucleotide units. More information can be found in the Research Article by D. Braun, J.&#8197;E. &#352;poner et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202103672).

         <title>Solution Phase Reactivity of Dibenzo[c,e][1,2]azaborinine: Activation and Insertion into Si&#8208;E Single Bonds (E=H, OSi(CH3)3, F, Cl) by a BN&#8208;Aryne</title>

Si&#8208;F Bond Activation: The BN triple bond of a BN&#8208;aryne is extremely reactive and can even activate the inert Si&#8722;F bond for insertion in solution. The mechanism involves coordinative interaction between the boron and fluorine atoms followed by nucleophilic attack of the nitrogen atom on silicon.







Abstract
The boron&#8208;nitrogen analogue of ortho&#8208;benzyne, 1,2&#8208;azaborinine, is a reactive intermediate that features a formal boron&#8208;nitrogen triple bond. We here show by combining experimental and computational techniques that the Lewis acidity of the boron center of dibenzo[c,e][1,2]azaborinine allows interaction with the silicon containing single bonds Si&#8722;E through the silicon bonding partner E (E=F, Cl, OR, H). The binding to boron activates the Si&#8722;E bonds for subsequent insertion reaction. This shows that the BN&#8208;aryne is a ferocious species that even can activate and insert into the very strong Si&#8722;F bond.

         <title>Exploring the Influence of Intermolecular Interactions in Prebiotic Chemistry Using Laser Spectroscopy and Calculations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exploiting the synergy between laser spectroscopy and calculations, the interaction potential energy surfaces of the dimers between adenine and 4&#8208;aminopyrimidine with theobromine have been explored. Both systems form stable aggregates with two strong hydrogen bonds, with binding energy values resembling the Watson&#8208;Crick analogue interactions. An energetic comparison suggests how intermolecular interactions influenced the evolutionary sequence.







Abstract
One of the most fascinating questions in chemistry is why nature chose CGAT as the alphabet of life. Very likely, such selection was the result of multiple factors and a long period of refinement. Here, we explore how the intermolecular interactions influenced such process, by characterizing the formation of dimers between adenine, theobromine and 4&#8208;aminopyrimidine. Using a combination of mass&#8208;resolved excitation spectroscopy and DFT calculations, we determined the structure of adenine&#8208;theobromine and 4&#8208;aminopyrimidine&#8208;theobromine dimers. The binding energy of these dimers is very close to the canonical adenine&#8208;thymine nucleobases. Likewise, the dimers are able to adopt Watson&#8208;Crick conformations. These findings seem to indicate that there were many options available to build the first versions of the informational polymers, which also had to compete with other molecules, such as 4&#8208;aminopyrimidine, which does not have a valid attaching point for a saccharide. For some reason, nature did not select the most strongly&#8208;bonded partners or if it did, such proto&#8208;bases were later replaced by the nowadays canonical CGAT.

         <title>Insights into Proton Dynamics in a Photofunctional Salt&#8208;Cocrystal Continuum: Single&#8208;Crystal X&#8208;ray, Neutron Diffraction, and Hirshfeld Atom Refinement</title>

Creating crystal chameleons: X&#8208;ray diffraction, neutron diffraction, and Hirshfeld atom refinement (HAR) demonstrate that the slight difference of the N&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O hydrogen bonds (HBs) in crystalline metastable acid&#8208;base complexes gives distinct photoluminescent properties. Our results contribute to understanding the complicated relationship between photofunction and proton dynamics in acid&#8208;base complexes, helping to create novel photofunctional materials.







Abstract
X&#8208;ray diffraction, neutron diffraction, and theoretical calculations were used to investigate the relationship between the optical properties and degree of protonation in acid&#8208;base complexes. We prepared five acid&#8208;base complexes by using a pyridine&#8208;modified pyrrolopyrrole derivative and salicylic acid. Two of the prepared acid&#8208;base complexes were polymorphs of guest&#8208;free crystals with green emission; the other three were guest&#8208;inclusion crystals with yellow emission containing CH2Cl2, CH2Br2, or C2H4Cl2. The presence or absence of guests caused the emission to change color, altering the hydrogen bond strength between the acid&#8208;base complexes. Accurate N&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;H distances between the pyridyl moiety and the carboxy group over the temperature range 123 to 273&#8197;K were 1.40&#8197;&#197; for the guest&#8208;free crystals and 1.25&#8197;&#197; for the guest&#8208;inclusion crystals. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of the complex relationship between photofunction and proton dynamics in acid&#8208;base complexes.

         <title>How 5&#8201;f Electron Polarisability Drives Covalency and Selectivity in Actinide N&#8208;Donor Complexes</title>

A series of isostructural actinide (Th, U&#8722;Pu) complexes with N,N&#8217;&#8208;ethylene&#8208;bis((pyrrole&#8208;2&#8208;yl)methanimine) (H2L, H2pyren) reveal different An&#8722;Nimine vs. An&#8722;Npyrrolide bond lengths and covalent character of the An&#8722;N bonds. Comparison to the [An(salen)2] complexes displays a slightly weaker overall bond strength of pyren to AnIV (An=Th, U, Np, Pu), except for PaIV.







Abstract
We report a series of isostructural tetravalent actinide (Th, U&#8722;Pu) complexes with the N&#8208;donor ligand N,N&#8217;&#8208;ethylene&#8208;bis((pyrrole&#8208;2&#8208;yl)methanimine) (H2L, H2pyren). Structural data from SC&#8208;XRD analysis reveal [An(pyren)2] complexes with different An&#8722;Nimine versus An&#8722;Npyrrolide bond lengths. Quantum chemical calculations elucidated the bonding situation, including differences in the covalent character of the coordinative bonds. A comparison to the intensely studied analogous N,N&#8242;&#8208;ethylene&#8208;bis(salicylideneimine) (H2salen)&#8208;based complexes [An(salen)2] displays, on average, almost equal electron sharing of pyren or salen with the AnIV, pointing to a potential ligand&#8208;cage&#8208;driven complex stabilisation. This is shown in the fixed ligand arrangement of pyren and salen in the respective AnIV complexes. The overall bond strength of the pure N&#8208;donor ligand pyren to AnIV (An=Th, U, Np, Pu) is slightly weaker than to salen, with the exception of the PaIV complex, which exhibits extraordinarily high electron sharing of pyren with PaIV. Such an altered ligand preference within the early AnIV series points to a specificity of the 5f1 configuration, which can be explained by polarisation effects of the 5&#8201;f electrons, allowing the strongest f electron backbonding from PaIV (5f1) to the N donors of pyren.

Abstract
In recent years, owing to the demand for high&#8208;efficiency phosphorescent organic light&#8208;emitting devices (PhOLEDs), many studies have been conducted on the development of bipolar host materials. A series of imidazolyl&#8208;phenylcarbazole&#8208;based host materials, i.&#8201;e., im&#8208;CzP, im&#8208;CzPCz, im&#8208;CzPtBu, and im&#8208;OCzP, were synthesized to obtain high&#8208;efficiency green and red&#8208;emitting PhOLEDs. With im&#8208;OCzP as the host, satisfactory peak efficiencies of 22.2 (77.0&#8197;cd&#8201;A&#8722;1 and 93.1&#8197;lm&#8201;W&#8722;1) and 14.1&#8201;% (9.0&#8197;cd&#8201;A&#8722;1 and 10.1&#8197;lm&#8201;W&#8722;1) could be obtained, respectively. To further improve the performance of the devices, an electron transport material, bis&#8208;4,6&#8208;(3,5&#8208;di&#8208;3&#8208;pyridylphenyl)&#8208;2&#8208;methylpyrimidine (B3PyMPM) was selected to construct a co&#8208;hosted system. The efficiency of im&#8208;OCzP combined with B3PyMPM forming co&#8208;hosts could also achieve high values of 23.0 (80.0&#8197;cd&#8201;A&#8722;1 and 98.8&#8197;lm&#8201;W&#8722;1) and 16.5&#8201;% (10.2&#8197;cd&#8201;A&#8722;1 and 13.4&#8197;lm&#8201;W&#8722;1) for green and red PhOLEDs, respectively. These results exhibited that the proposed bipolar hosts have great flexibility in adjusting the carrier balance of EML in OLEDs, demonstrating their ingenious design and high potential.

&lt;p&gt;In recent years, owing to the demand for high-efficiency phosphorescent organic light-emitting devices (PhOLEDs), many studies have been conducted on the development of bipolar host materials. A series of imidazolyl-phenylcarbazole-based host materials, i.&#8201;e., &lt;b&gt;im-CzP&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;im-CzPCz&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;im-CzP&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;Bu&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;im-OCzP&lt;/b&gt;, were synthesized to obtain high-efficiency green and red-emitting PhOLEDs. With &lt;b&gt;im-OCzP&lt;/b&gt; as the host, satisfactory peak efficiencies of 22.2 (77.0&#8197;cd&#8201;A&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and 93.1&#8197;lm&#8201;W&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and 14.1&#8201;% (9.0&#8197;cd&#8201;A&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and 10.1&#8197;lm&#8201;W&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) could be obtained, respectively. To further improve the performance of the devices, an electron transport material, bis-4,6-(3,5-di-3-pyridylphenyl)-2-methylpyrimidine (B3PyMPM) was selected to construct a co-hosted system. The efficiency of &lt;b&gt;im-OCzP&lt;/b&gt; combined with B3PyMPM forming co-hosts could also achieve high values of 23.0 (80.0&#8197;cd&#8201;A&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and 98.8&#8197;lm&#8201;W&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and 16.5&#8201;% (10.2&#8197;cd&#8201;A&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and 13.4&#8197;lm&#8201;W&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) for green and red PhOLEDs, respectively. These results exhibited that the proposed bipolar hosts have great flexibility in adjusting the carrier balance of EML in OLEDs, demonstrating their ingenious design and high potential.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bimodal fluorescence/magnetic resonance molecular probes with extended spin lifetimes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Bimodal molecular probes combining nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and fluorescence have been widely studied in basic science as well as clinical research. The investigation of spinphenomena holds promise to broaden the scope of available probes allowing for deeper insights into physiological processes. Here, we are introducing a class of molecules with a bimodal character with respect to fluorescence and nuclear spin singlet states. Singlet states are NMR silent but can be probed indirectly. We report on symmetric, perdeuterated molecules in which the singlet states can be populated via vanishingly small electron&#8208;mediated couplings (below 1 Hz). The lifetimes of these states are an order of magnitude longer than the longitudinal relaxation times and up to 4 minutes at 7 T. Moreover, these molecules show either aggregation induced emission (AIE) or aggregation caused quenching (ACQ) with respect to their fluorescence. In the latter case, we observed the existence of excited dimers which we propose to use in a switchable manner in combination with the quenching of nuclear spin singlet states.</dc:description>

         <title>Water&#8208;Dispersible Gold Nanoclusters: Synthesis Strategies, Optical Properties, and Biological Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Atomically precise gold nanoclusters (Au NCs) are an emerging class of quantum&#8208;sized nanomaterials. The intrinsic discrete electronic energy levels endowed them with fascinating electronical and optical properties. They have been widely applied in the field of optoelectronics, photovoltaics, catalysis, bio&#8208;sensing, bio&#8208;imaging and therapeutics. Nevertheless, most Au NCs are synthesized in organic solvents and are insoluble in aqueous solution, which restricted their biological applications. In this review, we focused on the recent progress in the preparation of water&#8208;soluble Au NCs and their biological applications. We first reviewed their synthetic methods, including direct synthesis from hydrophilic templates and indirect phase transfer of hydrophobic Au NCs. We then discussed their photophysical properties such as emission enhancement and their influence factors. We next summarized their latest applications in the fields of biosensing, biolabeling, and bioimaging. Finally, we outlined the challenges and potentials for the future development of these Au NCs.</dc:description>

         <title>Bioinspired Transformations Using Strictosidine Aglycones: Divergent Total Syntheses of Monoterpenoid Indole Alkaloids in the Early Stage of Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of bioinspired transformations that are applied to convert strictosidine aglycones into monoterpenoid indole alkaloids is reported. The highly reactive key intermediates, strictosidine aglycones, were prepared in situ by simple removal of a silyl protecting group from the silyl ether derivatives, and converted selectively via bioinspired transformations under substrate control into heteroyohimbine&#8208; and corynantheine&#8208;type, and akagerine and naucleaoral related alkaloids. Thus, concise, divergent total syntheses of 13 monoterpenoid indole alkaloids, (&#8211;)&#8208;cathenamine, (&#8211;)&#8208;tetrahydroalstonine, (+)&#8208;dihydrocorynantheine, (&#8211;)&#8208;corynantheidine, (&#8211;)&#8208;akagerine, (&#8211;)&#8208;dihydrocycloakagerine, (&#8211;)&#8208;naucleaoral B, (+)&#8208;naucleidinal, (&#8211;)&#8208;naucleofficines D and III, (&#8211;)&#8208;nauclefiline, and (&#8211;)&#8208;naucleamides A and E, were accomplished in fewer than 13 steps.</dc:description>

         <title>Assessing the importance of cation size in the tetragonal&#8208;cubic phase transition in lithium garnet electrolytes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Lithium garnets are promising solid&#8208;state electrolytes for next generation lithium&#8208;ion batteries. These materials have high ionic conductivity, a wide electrochemical window and stability with Li metal. However, lithium garnets have a maximum limit of 7 lithium atoms per formula unit (e.g. La3Zr2Li7O12), before the system transitions from a cubic to a tetragonal phase with poor ionic mobility. This arises from full occupation of the Li sites. Hence, the most conductive lithium garnets have Li between 6&#8208;6.55 Li per formula unit, which maintains the cubic symmetry and the disordered Li sub&#8208;lattice.

The tetragonal phase, however, forms the highly conducting cubic phase at higher temperatures, thought to arise from increased cell volume and entropic stabilisation permitting Li disorder. However, little work has been undertaken in understanding the controlling factors of this phase transition, which could enable enhanced dopant strategies to maintain room temperature cubic garnet at higher Li contents.

Here, a series of nine tetragonal garnets were synthesised and analysed via variable temperature XRD to understand the dependence of site substitution on the phase transition temperature. Interestingly the octahedral site cation radius was identified as the key parameter for the transition temperature with larger or smaller dopants altering the transition temperature noticeably. A site substitution was, however, found to make little difference irrespective of significant changes to cell volume.</dc:description>

         <title>An H2O2 Molecule Stabilized inside Open&#8208;Cage C60 Derivatives by a Hydroxy Stopper</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An H2O2 molecule was isolated inside hydroxylated open&#8208;cage fullerene derivatives by mixing of an H2O2 solution with a precursor molecule followed by reduction of one of carbonyl groups on its orifice. Depending on the reduction sites, two structural isomers for H2O2@open&#8208;fullerenes were obtained. The high encapsulation ratio of 81% was attained at low temperature. The structures of the peroxosolvate complexes thus obtained were studied by 1H NMR, X&#8208;ray analysis, and DFT calculations, showing a strong hydrogen bonding between the encapsulated H2O2 and the hydroxy group locating at the center of the orifice. This OH group was found to act as a kinetic stopper and the formation of the hydrogen bonding caused thermodynamic stabilization on the H2O2 molecule, both of which prevent its escape out of the cage. One of the peroxosolvates was isolated by HPLC, affording the H2O2@open&#8208;fullerene with 100% encapsulation ratio likely due to the intramolecular hydrogen bonding interaction.</dc:description>

The presence of Pd nanoparticles, uniformly distributed on the ZrO2 or C/ZrO2 matrix, was evidenced by TEM (TEM = Transmission Electron Microscopy), SEM (SEM = Scanning Electron Microscopy), Raman and XPS (XPS = X&#8208;ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy) methods. All pyrolysed composites retained the shape of the MOF template. They&#160; catalyze carbonylative Suzuki coupling under 1 atm CO with an efficiency significantly higher than the original&#160; Pd@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;Zr&#8208;NH2. The most active PdO/ZrO2 composite, formed benzophenone with TOF up to 1600 h&#8208;1, while&#160; by using Pd@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;Zr&#8208;NH2, much lower TOF values, 51 &#8208; 95 h&#8208;1, were achieved.&#160; After the reaction, PdO/ZrO2 was recovered with the same composition and catalytic activity. Very good results were also obtained in the transfer hydrogenation of benzophenones to alcohols with Pd/C/ZrO2 and PdO/ZrO2 catalysts under microwave irradiation.</dc:description>

         <title>Isolation of Cyclic Aluminium Polysulfides by Stepwise Sulfurization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite the notable progress in aluminium chalcogenides, their sulfur congeners have rarely been isolated under mild conditions&#160; owing to &#160; limited synthetic precursors and methods. Herein, facile isolation of diverse&#160;molecular aluminium sulfides is achievable, by the reaction of&#160;  N  &#8208;heterocyclic carbene&#8208;stabilized terphenyl dihydridoaluminium (  1  ) with various thiation reagents. Different to the known dihydridoaluminium&#160;  1  Tipp  ,&#160;  1  &#160;features balanced stability and reactivity at the Al center. It is this balance that enables the first monomeric aluminium hydride hydrogensulfide&#160;  2  , the six&#8208;membered cyclic aluminium polysulfide&#160;  4  &#160; and the five&#8208;membered cyclic aluminium polysulfide&#160;  6  &#160;t o be isolated, by reaction with various equivalents of elemental sulfur. Moreover, a rare aluminium heterocyclic sulfide with Al&#8208;S&#8208;P five&#8208;membered ring (  7  ) was obtained in a controlled manner. All new compounds were fully characterized by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy and elemental analysis. Their structures were confirmed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies.</dc:description>

         <title>Heteroallene Capture and Exchange at Functionalised&#160;Heptaphosphane Clusters</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Despite being known for decades the chemical reactivity of homoatomic seven&#8208;atom phosphorus clusters towards small molecules remains largely unexplored. Here, we report that neutral tris(silyl) functionalised heptaphosphane (P  7  (SiR  3  )  3  ) cages are capable of heteroallene capture between the P&#8722;Si bonds of the cluster. A range of isocyanates and an isothiocyanate were investigated. In the case of isocyanates, silyl bonding at oxygen or nitrogen is regioselectively directed by the functional group on the isocyanate and substituents on the silyl moiety. Above all, we find that captured isothiocyanate molecules can be exchanged for isocyanate molecules, indicative of small molecule catch and release. Small molecule catch and release at these Zintl&#8208;derived clusters reveals their potential application as chemical storage materials or as reusable probes.</dc:description>

         <title>Sterically Crowded Tris(2&#8208;(trimethylsilyl)phenyl)phosphine &#8208; Is it Still a Ligand?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tris(2&#8208;(trimethylsilyl)phenyl)phosphine, P(  o  &#8208;TMSC  6  H  4  )  3  , was synthesised and characterised in solution and in the solid state. The large steric bulk prevents most reactions of the phosphorus donor and makes the compound air stable both in the solid state as well as in solution. This shielded phosphine can still undergo three reactions, namely protonation, oxidation to the phosphine oxide under harsh conditions and complexation to Au  I  , thus forming a complex with linear coordination. Unexpectedly, complexation was unsuccessful with a range of other metal cations. Neither Pd  II  , Pt  II  , Zn  II  nor Hg  II  reacted and even the remaining coinage metal cations Cu  I  and Ag  I  could not be coordinated. Both the parent molecule as well as the reaction products were structurally characterised

by single crystal X&#8208;ray di raction, and the conformational change of geometry required to accommodate the additional atoms was analysed in detail. Apart from chemical oxidation with H  2  O  2  , P(  o  &#8208;TMSC  6  H  4  )  3  displays reversible electrochemical oxidation with a potential not unlike the one of sterically unencumbered

phosphines for which the oxidation is usually not reversible. P(  o  &#8208;TMSC  6  H  4  )  3  can thus be considered a model compound for the investigation of the electronic properties of sterically unencumbered phosphines.</dc:description>

         <title>Label&#8208;free Electrochemiluminescence Imaging of Single&#8208;Cell Adhesions Using Bipolar Nanoelectrode Array</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A label&#8208;free and fast approach for positive electrochemiluminescence (ECL) imaging of single cells by bipolar nanoelectrode array is proposed. The reduction of oxygen at a platinized gold nanoelectrode array in a closed bipolar electrochemical system is coupled with an oxidative ECL process at the anodic side. For elevating the ECL imaging contrast of single cells, a driving&#160; voltage of &#8208;2.0 V is applied to in situ generate oxygen confined beneath cells that is subsequently used for ECL imaging at 1.1 V. High oxygen concentration in the confined space resulting from steric hindrance generates prominent oxygen reduction current at the cathodic side and higher ECL intensity at the anodic side, allowing positive ECL imaging of the cells adhesion region with excellent contrast. Cell morphology and adhesion strength can be successfully imaged with high image acquisition rate. This approach opens a new avenue for label&#8208;free imaging of single cells.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Fe/N/C single&#8208;atom catalysts containing Fe&#8722;N  x  sites prepared by pyrolysis are promising cathode materials for fuel cells and metal&#8208;air batteries due to their high oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activities. We have developed iron complexes containing N2&#8208; or N3&#8208;chelating coordination structures with preorganized aromatic rings in a 1,12&#8208;diazatriphenylene framework tethering bromo substituents as precursors to precisely construct Fe&#8722;N  4  sites in an Fe/N/C catalyst. One&#8208;step pyrolysis of the iron complex with carbon black forms atomically dispersed Fe&#8722;N  4  sites without iron aggregates. X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and electrochemical measurements revealed that the iron complex with N3&#8208;coordination is more effectively converted to Fe&#8722;N  4  sites catalyzing ORR with a TOF value of 0.21 e&#8729;site  &#8722;1  &#8729;s  &#8722;1  at 0.8 V vs RHE. This indicates that the formation of Fe&#8722;N  4  sites is controlled by precise tuning of the chemical structure of the iron complex precursor.</dc:description>

         <title>Two faces of the same coin: coupling X&#8208;ray Absorption and NMR spectroscopies to investigate the exchange reaction between prototypical Cu coordination complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The satisfactory rationalization of complex reactive pathways in solution chemistry may greatly benefit from the combined use of advanced experimental and theoretical complementary methods of analysis. In this work, we combine X&#8208;Ray Absorption and  1  H&#8208;NMR spectroscopies with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Multivariate Curve Resolution and theoretical analyses to gain a comprehensive view on a prototypical reaction involving the variation of the oxidation state and local structure environment of a selected metal ion coordinated by organic ligands. Specifically, we investigate the 2&#8208;cyano&#8208;2&#8208;phenylpropanoic acid reduction of the octahedral complex established by the Cu  2+  ion with terpyridine to the tetrahedral complex formed by Cu  +  and neocuproine. Through our interdisciplinary approach we gain insights into the nature, concentration time evolution and structures of the key metal (XAS measurements) and organic (  1  H NMR measurements) species under reaction. We believe our method may prove to be useful in the toolbox necessary to understand the mechanisms of reactive processes of interest in solution.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Magnetoelectric (ME) materials exhibiting coupled electric and magnetic properties are of significant interest because of their potential use in memory storage devices, new sensors or low&#8208;consumption devices.

         <title>Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Electrochemical Cells Employing Electron Injection/Transport Layers of Ionic Transition Metal Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The optimized external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the proposed LEC reaches 6.8&#8201;%, which is among the highest values for perovskite LECs reported so far. This work successfully demonstrates that separating the ion transport, electron injection and transport layer from the perovskite emissive layer is more effective in adjusting device carrier balance than mixing all the components in a single emissive layer. As such, solution&#8208;processable perovskite/complex LECs open up a new way to realize efficient perovskite LECs.







Abstract
Recently, perovskites have attracted intense attention due to their high potential in optoelectronic applications. Employing perovskites as the emissive materials of light&#8208;emitting electrochemical cells (LECs) shows the advantages of simple fabrication process, low&#8208;voltage operation, and compatibility with inert electrodes, along with saturated electroluminescence (EL) emission. Unlike in previously reported perovskite LECs, in which salts are incorporated in the emissive layer, the ion&#8208;transport layer was separated from the emissive layer in this work. The layer of ionic transition metal complex (iTMC) not only provides mobile ions but also serves as an electron&#8208;injection/transport layer. Orthogonal solvents are used in spin coating to prevent the intermixing of stacked perovskite and iTMC layers. The blue iTMC with high ionization potential is effective in blocking holes from the emissive layer and thus ensures EL color saturation. In addition, the carrier balance of the perovskite/iTMC LECs can be optimized by adjusting the iTMC layer thickness. The optimized external quantum efficiency of the CsPbBr3/iTMC LEC reaches 6.8&#8201;%, which is among the highest reported values for perovskite LECs. This work successfully demonstrates that, compared with mixing all components in a single emissive layer, separating the layer of ion transport, electron injection and transport from the perovskite emissive layer is more effective in adjusting device carrier balance. As such, solution&#8208;processable perovskite/iTMC LECs open up a new way to realize efficient perovskite LECs.

         <title>Regioselective Magnesiation and Zincation Reactions of Aromatics and Heterocycles Triggered by Lewis Acids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Switch at Will: The functionalization of aromatics and heterocycles by using Zn&#8208; or Mg&#8208;TMP (TMP=2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidyl) bases has been widely explored. In many cases, a full switch of regioselectivity can be achieved in the presence of a Lewis acid additive. Also, these methods are compatible with continuous flow setups allowing the use of highly reactive lithium bases under practical reaction conditions.







Abstract
Mixed TMP&#8208;bases (TMP=2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidyl), such as TMPMgCl&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;LiCl, TMP2Mg&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2LiCl, TMPZnCl&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;LiCl and TMP2Zn&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2LiCl, are outstanding reagents for the metalation of functionalized aromatics and heterocycles. In the presence of Lewis acids, such as BF3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;OEt2 or MgCl2, the metalation scope of such bases was dramatically increased, and regioselectivity switches were achieved in the presence or absence of these Lewis acids. Furthermore, highly reactive lithium bases, such as TMPLi or Cy2NLi, are also compatible with various Lewis acids, such as MgCl2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2LiCl, ZnCl2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2LiCl or CuCN&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2LiCl. Performing such metalations in continuous flow using commercial setups permitted practical and convenient reaction conditions.

Vis&#8208;&#224;&#8211;vis going green Thermal stimuli induced the single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal phase transition of the blue&#8208;PL face&#8208;to&#8208;edge packed 1,8&#8208;bisphenylanthracene crystal, which experienced spontaneous propagation of the face&#8208;to&#8208;face molecular packed greenish&#8208;blue&#8208;PL crystal.







Abstract
Stimuli&#8208;triggered crystal&#8208;to&#8208;crystal and single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (SCSC) transformations have received significant attention in the scientific community. To visualize such phenomenon, controlling the optical properties and the thermodynamic stability of the molecular crystals is a very important research subject. In this report, the selective growth of photoluminescent (PL) 1,8&#8208;bisphenylanthracene polymorphic (cI and cII) and 1,2&#8208;dichloroethane&#8208;inclusion crystals (iC) under various optimized conditions is described. These crystals exhibited unique mechano&#8208; and thermoresponsive disordering, crystal&#8208;to&#8208;crystal phase transition, and SCSC phase transition. In particular, rapid thermostimulus SCSC occurred from blue&#8208;PL cI into greenish&#8208;blue&#8208;PL cII. Interestingly, the SCSC phase transition of cI into cII was triggered by thermal stimuli and propagated spontaneously. Thermotriggered domino&#8208;like SCSC phase transition was observed on a fully visible timescale (ca. 125&#8197;&#956;m&#8201;min&#8722;1).

         <title>Ligand&#8208;Controlled Regiodivergence for Catalytic Stereoselective Semireduction of Allenamides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A palladium&#8208;catalyzed, ligand controlled regiodivergent semireduction of allenamides has been developed. This phosphine ligand&#8208;switched semireduction system has enabled an easy access to a broad scope of allylic and vinylic amides by using a single palladium catalyst. The excellent regio&#8208; and stereoselectivities of the divergent processes were achieved by the employment of monodentate Xphos and bidentate BINAP ligands (see scheme).







Abstract
Ligand&#8208;controlled regiodivergence has been developed for catalytic semireduction of allenamides with excellent chemo&#8208; and stereocontrol. This system also provides an example of catalytic regiodivergent semireduction of allenes for the first time. The divergence of the semireduction is enabled by ligand switch with the same palladium pre&#8208;catalyst under operationally simple and mild conditions. Monodentate ligand XPhos exclusively promotes selective 1,2&#8208;semireduction to afford allylic amides, while bidentate ligand BINAP completely switched the regioselectivity to 2,3&#8208;semireduction, producing (E)&#8208;enamide derivatives.

         <title>Maytansinol Derivatives: Side Reactions as a Chance for New Tubulin Binders</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exploring the maytansinol acylation reaction, we have discovered previously unreported structural modifications of the maytansine scaffold. This permitted the synthesis and full characterization of a series of novel maytansinoids. A comprehensive biochemical evaluation and X&#8208;ray crystallography structure determinations of tubulin&#8208;maytansinoids identified potent tubulin binders. Moreover, our investigation allowed us to evaluate the impact of the structural modifications described.







Abstract
Maytansinol is a valuable precursor for the preparation of maytansine derivatives (known as maytansinoids). Inspired by the intriguing structure of the macrocycle and the success in targeted cancer therapy of the derivatives, we explored the maytansinol acylation reaction. As a result, we were able to obtain a series of derivatives with novel modifications of the maytansine scaffold. We characterized these molecules by docking studies, by a comprehensive biochemical evaluation, and by determination of their crystal structures in complex with tubulin. The results shed further light on the intriguing chemical behavior of maytansinoids and confirm the relevance of this peculiar scaffold in the scenario of tubulin binders.

         <title>Rational Design and Facile Synthesis of Dual&#8208;State Emission Fluorophores: Expanding Functionality for the Sensitive Detection of Nitroaromatic Compounds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel benzimidazole&#8208;based D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A fluorophores are rationally designed and concisely synthesized. Six compounds 4&#8201;a&#8211;4&#8201;f, as dual&#8208;state emission (DSE) materials, exhibit excellent photostability, solvatofluorochromic and extraordinary wide range of solvent compatibility. Among them, the DSE material 4&#8201;a is not only reasonably developed as a multifunctional fluorescent probe for sensitive detection of nitroaromatic compounds (NACs) in aqueous system, but also processed into test strips and thin films for visual detection of NACs.







Abstract
Six novel benzimidazole&#8208;based D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A compounds 4&#8201;a&#8211;4&#8201;f were concisely synthesized by attaching different donor/acceptor units to the skeleton of 1,3&#8208;bis(1H&#8208;benzimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)benzene on its 5&#8208;position through an ethynyl link. Due to the twisted conformation and effective conjugation structure, these dual&#8208;state emission (DSE) molecules show intense and multifarious photoluminescence, and their fluorescence quantum yields in solution and solid state can be up to 96.16 and 69.82&#8201;%, respectively. Especially, for excellent photostability, obvious solvatofluorochromic and extraordinary wide range of solvent compatibility, DSE molecule 4&#8201;a is a multifunctional fluorescent probe for the visual detection of nitroaromatic compounds (NACs) with the limit of detection as low as 10&#8722;7 M. The quenching mechanism has been proved as the results of photoinduced electron transfer and fluorescence resonance energy transfer processes. Importantly, probe 4&#8201;a can sensitively detect NACs not only in real water samples, but also on 4&#8201;a&#8208;coated strips and 4&#8201;a@PBAT thin films.

Due to the twisted conformation and effective conjugation structure, these dual-state emission (DSE) molecules show intense and multifarious photoluminescence, and their fluorescence quantum yields in solution and solid state can be up to 96.16 and 69.82&#8201;%, respectively. Especially, for excellent photostability, obvious solvatofluorochromic and extraordinary wide range of solvent compatibility, DSE molecule &lt;b&gt;4&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt; is a multifunctional fluorescent probe for the visual detection of nitroaromatic compounds (NACs) with the limit of detection as low as 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;7&lt;/sup&gt; M. The quenching mechanism has been proved as the results of photoinduced electron transfer and fluorescence resonance energy transfer processes. Importantly, probe &lt;b&gt;4&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt; can sensitively detect NACs not only in real water samples, but also on &lt;b&gt;4&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt;-coated strips and &lt;b&gt;4&#8201;a&lt;/b&gt;@PBAT thin films.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>An Alternative Route to Complex Allenes or Cyclooctatrienes via a Suzuki Cyclocarbopalladation Cascade</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The preparation of elaborate polycycles using the Suzuki cross&#8208;coupling reaction has been developed. If compounds 1&#8201;a&#8211;c are substituted by a triple bond an unusual cascade reaction affords allene derivatives 3 stereoselectively, while the presence of a substituted double bond, when reacted with a boronic ester or acid on 4, furnishes polysubstituted cyclooctatrienes 22 in high yields.







Abstract
The 4&#8208;exo&#8208;dig cyclocarbopalladation of vinyl bromides substituted with a triple or double bond resulted in impressive cascade reactions leading to different compounds under Suzuki cross&#8208;coupling conditions upon a slight modification of the starting material. When the starting compound carries a triple bond, a single cascade occurs providing a structure containing an allene, a tetrasubstituted cyclopropane, and a cyclobutene with complete stereoselectivity. When the related starting material possessing a double bond is reacted under the same conditions in the presence of various vinyl boronic esters or acids, an efficient 8&#960;&#8208;electrocyclization provides tricyclic systems comprised of a cyclobutene unit, as well as a cyclooctatriene. Five carbons of the latter can be selectively decorated with different substituents depending on the choice of the starting material and the boronic coupling partner.

         <title>Base&#8208;Mediated Radical Borylation of Alkyl Sulfones</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The utilization of inactivated alkyl sulfones as alkyl radical precursors in a base&#8208;mediated borylation reaction with B2neop2 is reported, allowing direct access to valuable alkyl boronate esters without further transesterification. This approach is scalable and is tolerant to a variety of functional groups and substrates including complex molecules.







Abstract
A practical and direct method was developed for the production of versatile alkyl boronate esters via transition metal&#8208;free borylation of primary and secondary alkyl sulfones. The key to the success of the strategy is the use of bis(neopentyl glycolato) diboron (B2neop2), with a stoichiometric amount of base as a promoter. The practicality and industrial potential of this protocol are highlighted by its wide functional group tolerance, the late&#8208;stage modification of complex compounds, no need for further transesterification, and operational simplicity. Radical clock, radical trap experiments, and EPR studies were conducted which show that the borylation process involves radical intermediates.

         <title>Ring Size Determines the Conformation, Global Aromaticity and Photophysical Properties of Macrocyclic Oligofurans</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The tradeoff between global and local aromaticity is demonstrated for a new series of macrocyclic furans. The global antiaromatic character decreases with macrocycle size, whereas the local aromatic character increases. This trend, which is observed both experimentally and computationally, is explained by the distortion of the larger macrocycles out of planarity.







Abstract
In &#960;&#8208;conjugated macrocycles, there is a trade&#8208;off between the global and local expression of effects such as aromaticity, with the outcome of the trade&#8208;off determined by the geometry and aromaticity of the constituent units. Compared with other aromatic rings, the aromatic character of furan is relatively small, and therefore global effects in macrocyclic furans are expected to be more pronounced. Following our introduction of macrocyclic oligofuran, we present the first synthesis of a series of &#960;&#8208;conjugated bifuran macrocycles of various ring sizes, from trimer to hexamer, and characterize them using both computational and experimental methods. The properties of macrocyclic oligofurans change considerably with size: The smaller trimer is rigid, weakly emissive and planar as revealed by its single crystal structure, and displays global antiaromaticity. In contrast, the larger pentamer and hexamer are flexible, emissive, have non&#8208;planar structures, and exhibit local aromaticity. The results are supported by NICS and ACID calculations that indicate the global antiaromaticity of planar furan macrocycles, and by transient absorption measurements showing sharp absorption band for the trimer and only the internal conversion decay pathway.

         <title>Enhancing the Catalytic Activity of MOF&#8208;808 Towards Peptide Bond Hydrolysis through Synthetic Modulations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modulating the synthesis of MOF&#8208;808 through choice of zirconium precursor directly impacts its structure and reactivity towards the hydrolysis of peptide bonds, outweighing the influence of MOF defects or particle size.







Abstract
The performance of MOFs in catalysis is largely derived from structural features, and much work has focused on introducing structural changes such as defects or ligand functionalisation to boost the reactivity of the MOF. However, the effects of different parameters chosen for the synthesis on the catalytic reactivity of the resulting MOF remains poorly understood. Here, we evaluate the role of metal precursor on the reactivity of Zr&#8208;based MOF&#8208;808 towards hydrolysis of the peptide bond in the glycylglycine model substrate. In addition, the effect of synthesis temperature and duration has been investigated. Surprisingly, the metal precursor was found to have a large influence on the reactivity of the MOF, surpassing the effect of particle size or number of defects. Additionally, we show that by careful selection of the Zr&#8208;salt precursor and temperature used in MOF syntheses, equally active MOF catalysts could be obtained after a 20&#8197;minute synthesis compared to 24&#8197;h synthesis.

         <title>Synthesis, Structures, and Properties of Helically Fused Anthraquinones with Unusually Close Carbonyl&#8208;Carbonyl Contacts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three anthraquinone units are angularly fused to construct a helical structure with sterically congested carbonyl groups, which influence structure, dynamic behavior, and spectroscopic and electrochemical properties relative to those of the anthracene analogs. The unusually close CO&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;CO contacts (2.47&#8197;&#197;) are discussed in terms of noncovalent interactions based on theoretical approaches.







Abstract
Electron&#8208;deficient aromatic ketones consisting of three fused anthraquinone units were synthesized by oxidation of the corresponding fused anthracenes. X&#8208;ray analysis revealed that these compounds had nonplanar helical structures with unusual contacts, C=O&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;C=O 2.467&#8197;&#197;, between the inner carbonyl groups. The role of n&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960;* interactions in the short contacts was evaluated using a noncovalent interaction plot and natural bond orbital analysis. The dynamic process involving helical inversion was observed by the variable temperature 1H NMR measurement of a derivative with 2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenyl groups, and the barrier was estimated to be 77&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1. DFT calculations indicated that the helical inversion proceeded via a multistep mechanism. The characteristic spectroscopic and electrochemical data due to the electron&#8208;deficient anthraquinone units and the sterically congested carbonyl groups are discussed with the aid of DFT calculations.

The role of n&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960;* interactions in the short contacts was evaluated using a noncovalent interaction plot and natural bond orbital analysis. The dynamic process involving helical inversion was observed by the variable temperature &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H NMR measurement of a derivative with 2,4,6-trimethylphenyl groups, and the barrier was estimated to be 77&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. DFT calculations indicated that the helical inversion proceeded via a multistep mechanism. The characteristic spectroscopic and electrochemical data due to the electron-deficient anthraquinone units and the sterically congested carbonyl groups are discussed with the aid of DFT calculations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Size&#8208;Induced Inversion of Selectivity in the Acylation of 1,2&#8208;Diols</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Lewis&#8208;base catalyzed acylation of aromatic 1,2&#8208;ethylenediols with anhydrides depends strongly on the size of the reagents and the &#960;&#8208;system of the diol. Steric effects have a larger impact on reactions of primary hydroxyl groups in the 1,2&#8208;diol as well as the monoester than those of secondary hydroxyl groups. For sterically demanding anhydrides this flips the selectivity towards secondary alcohols.







Abstract
Relative rates for the Lewis base&#8208;catalyzed acylation of aryl&#8208;substituted 1,2&#8208;diols with anhydrides differing in size have been determined by turnover&#8208;limited competition experiments and absolute kinetics measurements. Depending on the structure of the anhydride reagent, the secondary hydroxyl group of the 1,2&#8208;diol reacts faster than the primary one. This preference towards the secondary hydroxyl group is boosted in the second acylation step from the monoesters to the diester through size and additional steric effects. In absolute terms the first acylation step is found to be up to 35&#8197;times faster than the second one for the primary alcohols due to neighboring group effects.

         <title>Bulky PNP Ligands Blocking Metal&#8208;Ligand Cooperation Allow for Isolation of Ru(0), and Lead to Catalytically Active Ru Complexes in Acceptorless Alcohol Dehydrogenation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We synthesized two 4Me&#8722;PNP Ru complexes and compared their catalytic performance against two traditional analogues used in acceptorless alcohol dehydrogenation catalysis, leading us to identify a common deactivation pathway. The 4Me&#8722;PNP complexes, which do not undergo dearomatization upon addition of base, also allowed us to obtain rare, albeit unstable, 16 electron mono&#8208;CO Ru(0), and their subsequent Ru(II) reaction products.







Abstract
We synthesized two 4Me&#8722;PNP ligands which block metal&#8208;ligand cooperation (MLC) with the Ru center and compared their Ru complex chemistry to their two traditional analogues used in acceptorless alcohol dehydrogenation catalysis. The corresponding 4Me&#8722;PNP complexes, which do not undergo dearomatization upon addition of base, allowed us to obtain rare, albeit unstable, 16 electron mono&#8208;CO Ru(0) complexes. Reactivity with CO and H2 allows for stabilization and extensive characterization of bis&#8208;CO Ru(0) 18 electron and Ru(II) cis and trans dihydride species that were also shown to be capable of C(sp2) &#8722;H activation. Reactivity and catalysis are contrasted to non&#8208;methylated Ru(II) species, showing that an MLC pathway is not necessary, with dramatic differences in outcomes during catalysis between iPr and tBu PNP complexes within each of the 4Me and non&#8208;methylated backbone PNP series being observed. Unusual intermediates are characterized in one of the new and one of the traditional complexes, and a common catalysis deactivation pathway was identified.

         <title>Joint Venture of Metal Cluster and Amphiphilic Cationic Minidendron Resulting in Near Infrared Emissive Lamellar Ionic Liquid Crystals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Guanidinium minidendrons bearing terminal aliphatic chains show a columnar liquid&#8208;crystalline behaviour once associated with chlorine anions, whereas they turned into layered phases when associated with phosphorescent octahedral molybdenum cluster dianions. The emission properties of the inorganic dyes are largely influenced by the minidendron chain length in these first&#8208;of&#8208;their&#8208;kind clustomesogens.







Abstract
Inorganic red&#8208;NIR emissive materials are particularly relevant in many fields like optoelectronic, bioimaging or solar cells. Benefiting from their emission in devices implies their integration in easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle materials like liquid crystals, whose long&#8208;range ordering and self&#8208;healing abilities could be exploited and influence emission. Herein, we present red&#8208;NIR emissive hybrid materials obtained with phosphorescent octahedral molybdenum cluster anions electrostatically associated with amphiphilic guanidinium minidendrons. Polarized optical microscopy and X&#8208;ray analysis show that while the minidendron chloride salts self&#8208;organize into columnar phases, their association with the dianionic metal cluster leads to layered phases. Steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved emission investigations demonstrate the influence of the minidendron alkyl chain length on the phosphorescence of the metal cluster core.

         <dc:description>An efficient and broadly applicable process is reported for the copper&#8208;catalyzed direct perfluoroalkylation of C&#8208;H bonds in heteroarenes with commercially available perfluoroalkyl iodides. This reaction is based on a simple combination of copper(I) iodide and phenanthroline enabling the easy reduction of perfluoroalkyl iodides to the corresponding radical species that add to a wide range of heteroarenes including benzofurans, benzothiophenes, (aza)indoles, furans and pyrroles. High levels of regioselectivity were obtained in all cases and the efficiency and robustness of this process was highlighted by the direct perfluoroalkylation of furan&#8208;containing peptides.</dc:description>

         <title>Photobase&#8208;Driven Excited&#8208;State Intramolecular Proton Transfer (ESIPT) in a Strapped &#960;&#8208;Electron System</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report a new design strategy for an excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) fluorophore that can be used in acidic media. A photobasic pyridine&#8208;centered donor&#8211;acceptor&#8211;donor&#8208;type fluorophore is combined with a basic trialkylamine &#8220;strap&#8221;. In the presence of an acid, protonation occurs predominantly at the amine moiety in the ground state. A single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis confirmed the formation of a pre&#8208;organized intramolecular hydrogen&#8208;bonded structure between the resulting ammonium moiety and the pyridine ring. Upon excitation, the intramolecular charge&#8208;transfer transition increases the basicity of the pyridine moiety in the excited state, resulting in proton transfer from the amine to the pyridine moiety. Consequently, the fluorophore takes on a polymethine&#8208;dye character in the ESIPT state, which gives rise to significantly red&#8208;shifted emission with an increased fluorescence quantum yield.</dc:description>

         <title>Highly stable univalent copper of Cu@Al/SBA&#8208;15 nanocomposite catalyzed the synthesis of novel aminobenzotriazoles derivatives and their fluorescence properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>With the development of green chemistry, it is still a challenge to maintain the unstable valence state of the metal in heterogeneous catalysts and realize new catalytic synthesis methods. In this paper, it was reported that an univalent copper nanocomposite (Cu@Al/SBA&#8208;15) could efficiently catalyze the formation of novel amino&#8208;containing benzotriazoles with great fluorescence properties in a new synthetic strategy. Subsequently, its application was further verified by acylation reaction to produce a series of novel benzotriazoles derivatives with high yield. It was worth noting that Cu@Al/SBA&#8208;15 nanocomposites not only enable the reaction completed with high yield in a short time, but also could be recycled many times without a significant reduction in activity, and the leaching of copper and aluminum species in reaction system was negligible. Finally, the detailed and feasible reaction mechanism was also provided.</dc:description>

         <title>Mild Microfluidic Approaches to Oxide Nanoparticles Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oxide nanoparticles (oxide NPs) are advanced materials with a wide variety of applications in different fields. The use of continuous flow methods is particularly appealing for their synthesis due to the high control achieved over the reaction conditions and the easy process scalability. This review focuses on the preparation of oxide NPs using microfluidic setups at low temperature (&#8804; 80&#176;C), since the employment of mild reaction conditions is crucial for developing sustainable and cost&#8208;effective processes. A particular emphasis will be put on the improvement over the final product features (  e.g.  , size, shape, and size distribution) given by flow methods with respect to conventional batch procedures. The main issues that arise by treating NPs suspensions in microfluidic systems are product deposition or channel clogging; mitigation strategies to overcome these drawbacks will also be presented and discussed.</dc:description>

         <title>Ruthenium Complexes Bearing Axially Chiral Bipyridyls: The Mismatched Diastereomer Showed Red Circularly Polarized Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>RutheniumII  &#160;complexes bearing three axially chiral bipyridyl ligands were synthesized as a new family of chiral complex dyes, and &#916;&#8208;(S)&#8208; and &#923;&#8208;(S)&#8208;diastereomers were obtained. The X&#8208;ray crystal structure analyses, spectroscopy, and DFT calculations suggested that all the bipyridyls maintained chirality in both the ground and excited states, and the &#916;&#8208;(S)&#8208; and &#923;&#8208;(S)&#8208;isomers are the matched (more relaxed) and mismatched (more constrained) pairs, respectively. The mismatched &#923;&#8208;(S)&#8208;isomer exhibited red circularly polarized phosphorescence (CPP) both in solution and in the solid state. The solution state CPP is the most intense of ruthenium complexes, while the solid state CPP is the first example of them.&#160;It is supposed that, for the &#923;&#8208;(S)&#8208;isomer, the six cumulative CH/&#960;&#160;interactions suppress further distortion in the T1&#160;state.</dc:description>

         <title>Carboboration&#8208;Driven Generation of a Silylium Ion for Vinylic C&#8211;F Bond Functionalization by B(C6F5)3 Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Strong main&#8208;group Lewis acids such as silylium ions are known to effectively promote heterolytic C(sp3)&#8211;F bond cleavage. However, carrying out the C(sp2)&#8211;F bond transformation of vinylic C&#8211; F bonds has remained an unmet challenge. Herein, we describe our development of a new and simple strategy for vinylic C&#8211;F bond transformation of &#945;&#8208;fluorostyrenes with silyl ketene acetals catalyzed by B(C6F5)3 under mild conditions. Our theoretical calculations revealed that a stabilized silylium ion, which is generated from silyl ketene acetals by carboboration, cleaves the C&#8211;F bond of &#945;fluorostyrenes. A comparative study of &#945;&#8208;chloro or bromostyrenes demonstrated that our reaction can be applied only to &#945;fluorostyrenes because the strong silicon&#8208;fluorine affinity facilitates an intramolecular interaction of silylium ions with fluorine atom to cleave the C&#8211;F bond. A broad range of &#945;&#8208;fluorostyrenes as well as a range of silyl ketene acetals underwent this C&#8211;F bond transformation.</dc:description>

This method enables facile and rapid access to terminal  N  &#8208;allenamides by using commercially available TMS&#8208;diazomethane with wide functional group compatibility on the nitrogen. Furthermore, the ubiquity of molecules containing a fluorine moiety in medicine, in agricultural, and material science requires the continuous search of new building blocks, including this unique surrogate.

         <title>Carrier Protein&#8208;Free Enzymatic Biaryl Coupling in Arylomycin A2 Assembly and Structure of the Cytochrome P450 AryC**
</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The arylomycins are antibiotic natural products that inhibit bacterial signal peptidase. Within this work, the biaryl&#8208;bond forming cytochrome P450 of arylomycin biosynthesis, AryC, is structurally and functionally characterized. Convergent preparation of the linear lipopeptide precursor followed by enzymatic installation of the biaryl structural element by AryC results in a streamlined chemo&#8208;enzymatic access to arylomycin A2. Unlike oxidative cross&#8208;coupling enzymes in glycopeptide biosynthesis, AryC accepts carrier protein&#8208;free peptide substrates, a tremendous advantage for future biocatalytic applications in complex peptide synthesis.







Abstract
The arylomycin antibiotics are potent inhibitors of bacterial type I signal peptidase. These lipohexapeptides contain a biaryl structural motif reminiscent of glycopeptide antibiotics. We herein describe the functional and structural evaluation of AryC, the cytochrome P450 performing biaryl coupling in biosynthetic arylomycin assembly. Unlike its enzymatic counterparts in glycopeptide biosynthesis, AryC converts free substrates without the requirement of any protein interaction partner, likely enabled by a strongly hydrophobic cavity at the surface of AryC pointing to the substrate tunnel. This activity enables chemo&#8208;enzymatic assembly of arylomycin A2 that combines the advantages of liquid&#8208; and solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis with late&#8208;stage enzymatic cross&#8208;coupling. The reactivity of AryC is unprecedented in cytochrome P450&#8208;mediated biaryl construction in non&#8208;ribosomal peptides, in which peptidyl carrier protein (PCP)&#8208;tethering so far was shown crucial both in&#8197;vivo and in&#8197;vitro.

         <title>Coordination cage&#8208;based emulsifiers: templated formation of metal oxide microcapsules monitored by in situ LC&#8208;TEM</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metallo&#8208;supramolecular self&#8208;assembly has yielded a plethora of discrete&#160;nanosystems, many of which show competence in capturing guests and catalyzing chemical reactions. However, the potential of low&#8208;molecular bottom&#8208;up self&#8208;assemblies in the development of structured inorganic materials has rarely been methodically explored so far. Herein, we present a new type of metallo&#8208;supramolecular surfactant with the ability to stabilize non&#8208;aqueous emulsions for a significant period. The molecular design of the surfactant is based on a heteroleptic coordination cage (  CGA&#8208;3  ;  CGA  = Cage&#8208;based Gemini Amphiphile), assembled from two pairs of organic building blocks, grouped around two Pd(II) cations. Shape&#8208;complementarity between the differently functionalized components generates discrete amphiphiles with a tailor&#8208;made polarity profile, able to stabilize non&#8208;aqueous emulsions, such as hexadecane&#8208;in&#8208;DMSO. These emulsions were used as a medium for the synthesis of spherical metal oxide microcapsules (titanium oxide, zirconium oxide, and niobium oxide) from soluble, water&#8208;sensitive alkoxide precursors by allowing a controlled dosage of water to the liquid&#8208;liquid phase boundary. Synthesized materials were analyzed by a combination of electron microscopic techniques.  In situ  liquid cell transmission electron microscopy (LC&#8208;TEM) was utilized for the first time to visualize the dynamics of the emulsion&#8208;templated formation of hollow inorganic titanium oxide and zirconium oxide microspheres.</dc:description>

Herein, we present a new type of metallo-supramolecular surfactant with the ability to stabilize non-aqueous emulsions for a significant period. The molecular design of the surfactant is based on a heteroleptic coordination cage (  CGA-3  ;  CGA  = Cage-based Gemini Amphiphile), assembled from two pairs of organic building blocks, grouped around two Pd(II) cations.

         <title>Mechanism&#8208;Based Approach to Reagent Selection for Oxidative Carbon&#8211;Hydrogen Bond Cleavage Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Numerous hydride&#8208;abstracting agents generate the same cationic intermediate, but substrate features such as intermediate cation stability, oxidation potential, and steric environment can influence reaction rates in an oxidant&#8208;dependent manner. This manuscript provides experimental data to illustrate the role that structural features play in the kinetics of hydride abstraction reactions with commonly used quinone&#8208;, oxoammonium ion&#8208;, and carbocation&#8208; based oxidants. Computational studies of the transition state structures and energies explain these results and energy decomposition analysis calculations reveal unique sensitivities to electrostatic attraction and steric repulsions. Rigorous rate studies of select reactions validated the capacity of the calculations to predict reactivity trends. Additionally, kinetics studies demonstrate the potential for product inhibition in DDQ&#8208;mediated reactions. These studies provide a clear guide to select the optimal oxidant for structurally disparate substrates and lead to predictions of reactivity that were validated experimentally.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Elaboration of enantioenriched complex acyclic stereotriads represents a challenge for modern synthesis even more when fluorinated tetrasubstituted stereocenters are targeted. We have been able to develop a simple strategy in a sequence of two unprecedented steps combining a diastereoselective aldol&#8208;Tishchenko reaction and an enantioselective organocatalyzed kinetic resolution. The aldol&#8208;Tishchenko reaction generates directly a large panel of acyclic 1,3&#8208;diols possessing a fluorinated tetrasubstituted stereocenter by condensation of fluorinated ketones with aldehydes under very mild basic conditions. The anti 1,3&#8208;diols featuring three contiguous stereogenic centers are generated with excellent diastereocontrol (typically &gt; 99:1 dr ). Depending upon the precursors both diastereomers of stereotriads are accessible through this flexible reaction. Furthermore, from the obtained racemic scaffolds, development of an organocatalyzed kinetic resolution enabled to generate the desired enantioenriched stereotriads with excellent selectivity (typically er &gt; 95:5).</dc:description>

         <title>Helic[6]arene&#8208;Based Chiral Pseudo[1]rotaxanes and [1]Rotaxanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chiral pseudo[1]rotaxanes and [1]rotaxanes constructed from macrocyclic arenes still remain a big challenge mainly owing to the lack of such chiral macrocycles. In this work, a new system of chiral pseudo[1]rotaxanes formed by self&#8208;inclusion of helic[6]arene containing amide linked with the terminal tertiary amines was first discovered. Based on an atom&#8208;economic stopping strategy, a pair of chiral [1]rotaxanes were conveniently obtained in almost quantitative yields by blocking the pseudo[1]rotaxanes with monobenzyl bromide of tetraphenylethene. The structures of pseudo[1]rotaxanes and [1]rotaxanes were characterized by 2D NMR spectra in solution, combining with the DFT calculations. The photophysical properties further revealed the efficient chirality transfer of helic[6]arene to the tetraphenylethene moiety, compared to their unthreaded chiral isomers. The discovery of the chiral pseudo[1]rotaxanes allows for a wide and available synthesis of chiral [1]rotaxanes, and also opening a new avenue to the design of chiral supramolecular materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Halogen Bonding Adsorbent Pyridine N&#8208;oxides for Iodine Capture in Water</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nonporous crystal materials from one&#8208;step synthesized single component pyridine N&#8208;oxides (2&#8208;((naphthalen&#8208;2&#8208;ylmethyl)thio)pyridine 1&#8208;oxide: NTPO) for iodine capture in water driven by halogen bond between oxygen atom of NTPO and iodine molecule, along with a single&#8208;crystal to single&#8208;crystal transformation process of crystal NTPO to binary cocrystals combined with NTPO and iodine. Besides, the nonporous material NTPO also have great potential in the adsorption of iodine in vapor state and organic solvents (cyclohexane and n&#8208;hexane).







Abstract
Rapid capture of 129I with high volatility and toxicity in the environment has attracted much attention. Herein we reported a firstly synthesized nonporous material: pyridine N&#8208;oxides (NTPO and ATPO) as iodine adsorbent. Both of NTPO and ATPO exhibit remarkable performance on the adsorption of iodine in aqueous solution, vapor state and organic solvents. Upon the capture of iodine, pyridine N&#8208;oxides were transformed to binary cocrystals combined with the pyridine N&#8208;oxides and iodine which is driven by halogen bond between iodine and oxygen atoms. Moreover, pyridine N&#8208;oxides shows high chemical, thermal and moisture stability.

         <title>Molecular Scissors for Tailor&#8208;Made Modification of Siloxane Scaffolds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synthetic methodology for a tailored design of functional siloxanes is presented. We show that by incorporating molecular scissors into the siloxane framework, the Si&#8722;O&#8722;Si linkage can easily be cleaved at a desired position and siloxy groups exchanged for one another. The method allows also for a direct one&#8208;step cleavage of chlorosiloxanes and shows broad substrate scope, high variability of functional siloxy units, and excellent selectivity.







Abstract
The controlled design of functional oligosiloxanes is an important topic in current research. A consecutive Si&#8722;O&#8722;Si bond cleavage/formation using siloxanes that are substituted with 1,2&#8208;diaminobenzene derivatives acting as molecular scissors is presented. The method allows to cut at certain positions of a siloxane scaffold forming a cyclic diaminosilane or &#8208;siloxane intermediate and then to introduce new functional siloxy units. The procedure could be extended to a direct one&#8208;step cleavage of chlorooligosiloxanes. Both siloxane formation and cleavage proceed with good to excellent yields, high regioselectivity, and great variability of the siloxy units. Control of the selectivity is achieved by the choice of the amino substituent. Insight into the mechanism was provided by low temperature NMR studies and the isolation of a lithiated intermediate.

         <title>Unfused Nonfullerene Acceptors Based on Simple Dipolar Merocyanines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Simple indole&#8208;based merocyanines have been successfully designed as unfused nonfullerene acceptors for organic solar cells by forming dimers with A&#8722;D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;D&#8722;A structure that have a facile synthesis, enhanced photostability compared to well&#8208;known ITIC acceptor, and high electron mobility in blend films. When blended with P3HT donor, one of dimers, i.&#8201;e. Z2, shows a good cell efficiency of 3.53&#8201;%.







Abstract
Merocyanine (MC) dyes exhibit facile synthesis and attractive optical properties, making them widely studied as the donor materials in organic solar cells (OSCs). In this study, for the first time, simple indole&#8208;based MCs are successfully designed as unfused nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs) for OSCs by forming dimers with A&#8722;D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;D&#8722;A structure, which possess enhanced photostability compared to the well&#8208;known ITIC acceptor and high electron mobility in blend films. When blended with P3HT donor, one of the dimers, i.&#8201;e. Z2, shows a good cell efficiency of 3.53&#8201;%, which outperforms the performance of most of P3HT/NFA blends, particularly for unfused systems, and thus indicates good potential of simple MCs as NFAs.

         <title>Electrochemical Characterization of Redox Probes Confined in 3D Conducting Polymer Networks</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tailor&#8208;made 3D conducting polymer networks containing tetraphenylbenzidine redox units are presented as novel platform for the introduction of tunable amounts of additional functional redox species via polymer analogous click chemistry in films. An in&#8208;depth electrochemical characterization based on cyclic voltammetry shows successful covalent immobilization of the redox species within the conducting networks. Ultimately this strategy shall be extended to (photo)electrocatalytic applications which will profit from the conducting polymer matrix as solid support.







Abstract
In this manuscript we present a versatile platform for introducing functional redox species into tailor&#8208;made 3D redox polymer networks. Electrochemical characterization based on cyclic voltammetry is applied to verify the immobilization of the redox species within the conducting networks. Ultimately this strategy shall be extended to (photo)electrocatalytic applications which will profit from the conducting polymer matrix. Soluble precursor copolymers are synthesized via radical copolymerization of vinyltriphenylamine (VTPA) with chloromethylstyrene (CMS) in different ratios, whereas CMS is subsequently converted into azidomethylstyrene (AMS) to yield poly(VTPA&#8208;co&#8208;AMS) copolymers. Spin&#8208;coating of poly(VTPA&#8208;co&#8208;AMS) on gold electrodes yields thin films which are converted into stable polymer network structures by electrochemical crosslinking of the polymer chains via their pendant triphenylamine groups to yield N,N,N&#8242;,N&#8242;&#8208;tetraphenylbenzidine (TPB) crosslinking points. Finally, the resulting redox&#8208;active, TPB&#8208;crosslinked films are functionalized with ethynylferrocene (EFc) as a representative redox probe using a click reaction. Main experimental tools are polarization modulation infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy and scan rate dependent cyclic voltammetry. Especially the latter proves the successful conversion and the immobilization of redox probes in the polymer matrix. The results are compared with the reference system of azide&#8208;terminated self&#8208;assembled monolayers on gold substrates, allowing to distinguish between free and immobilized EFc species.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Methane dehydroaromatization is a promising reaction for the direct conversion of methane to liquid hydrocarbons. The active sites and the mechanism of this reaction remain controversial. This work is focused on the operando X&#8208;ray absorption near edge structure spectroscopy analysis of conventional Mo/ZSM&#8208;5 catalyst during its whole lifetime. Complemented by other characterization techniques, we derived spectroscopic descriptors of molybdenum precursor decomposition and its exchange with zeolite Br&#248;nsted acid sites. We found that the reduction of Mo&#8208;species proceeds in two steps and the active sites are of siminar nature, regardless of the Mo content. Furthermore, the ZSM&#8208;5 unit cell contracts at the beginning of the reaction, which coincided with benzene formation and it is likely related to the formation of hydrocarbon pool intermediates. Finally, although reductive regeneration of used catalysts via methanation is less effective as compared to combustion of coke, it does not affect the structure of the catalyst.</dc:description>

         <title>Gold N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Catalysts for the Hydrofluorination of Alkynes Using Hydrofluoric Acid: Reaction Scope, Mechanistic Studies and the Tracking of Elusive Intermediates</title>

         <dc:description>
Unconventional fluorination: The development of the chemoselective gold&#8208;catalysed hydrofluorination of terminal alkynes using aqueous HF and an easily accessible N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene&#8208;gold pre&#8208;catalyst is reported. Following the observation and isolation of unprecedented organometallic intermediates and computational studies, a catalytic cycle is proposed, featuring an in&#8197;situ generation of the chemoselective catalyst.







Abstract
An efficient and chemoselective methodology deploying gold&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC) complexes as catalysts in the hydrofluorination of terminal alkynes using aqueous HF has been developed. Mechanistic studies shed light on an in&#8197;situ generated catalyst, formed by the reaction of Br&#248;nsted basic gold pre&#8208;catalysts with HF in water, which exhibits the highest reactivity and chemoselectivity. The catalytic system has a wide alkyl substituted&#8208;substrate scope, and stoichiometric as well as catalytic reactions with tailor&#8208;designed gold pre&#8208;catalysts enable the identification of various gold species involved along the catalytic cycle. Computational studies aid in understanding the chemoselectivity observed through examination of key mechanistic steps for phosphine&#8208; and NHC&#8208;coordinated gold species bearing the triflate counterion and the elusive key complex bearing a bifluoride counterion.

         <title>Weinreb Amide, Ketone and Amine as Potential and Competitive Secondary Molecular Stations for Dibenzo&#8208;[24]Crown&#8208;8&#8201;in [2]Rotaxane Molecular Shuttles</title>

         <dc:description>
New DB24C8&#8208;based [2]rotaxane molecular shuttles that contain ammonium, amine, Weinreb amide and/or ketone stations have been synthesized and characterized. Their shuttling behavior, which is linked to the ability of the considered moieties to act as efficient secondary molecular stations of more or less high affinity for the macrocycle, depended on the combination of stations and steric restrictions.







Abstract
This paper reports the synthesis and study of new pH&#8208;sensitive DB24C8&#8208;based [2]rotaxane molecular shuttles that contain within their axle four potential sites of interaction for the DB24C8: ammonium, amine, Weinreb amide, and ketone. In the protonated state, the DB24C8 lay around the best ammonium site. After either deprotonation or deprotonation&#8208;then&#8208;carbamoylation of the ammonium, different localizations of the DB24C8 were seen, depending on both the number and nature of the secondary stations and steric restriction. Unexpectedly, the results indicated that the Weinreb amide was not a proper secondary molecular station for the DB24C8. Nevertheless, through its methoxy side chain, it slowed down the shuttling of the macrocycle along the threaded axle, thereby partitioning the [2]rotaxane into two translational isomers on the NMR timescale. The ketone was successfully used as a secondary molecular station, and its weak affinity for the DB24C8 was similar to that of a secondary amine.

         <title>A Phosphorus&#8208;Based Pacman Dication Generated by Cooperative Self&#8208;Activation of a Pacman Phosphane</title>

         <dc:description>
You can play Pac Man with Phosphorus! The first non&#8208;metal Pacman compound, a calix[4]pyrrole schiff base ligand coordinating two highly dynamic P(III)Cl moieties is presented. Chloride abstraction with AgOTf leads to a macrocyclic dication with two embedded phosphorus monocations, both of which undergo a cooperative internal activation reaction.







Abstract
Formal coordination of phosphorus(III) by a calix[4]pyrrole Schiff base ligand was achieved through the reaction of this ligand with PCl3 under basic conditions. The reaction product adopts a Pacman conformation with two P&#8722;Cl moieties, one in exo and one in endo position. It represents the first non&#8208;metal compound of calix[4]pyrrole Schiff base ligands and of Pacman ligands in general. The spatial neighborhood of the two phosphorus atoms enables cooperative reactions. As a first example, the chloride abstraction with AgOTf is presented, yielding a macrocyclic dication with two embedded phosphorus(III) monocations, which both undergo a cooperative, internal activation reaction with an adjacent C=N double bond. This intramolecular redox process affords two pentacoordinated phosphorus(V) centers within the Pacman dication. All reaction products were fully characterized and all results are supported by computations.

         <title>Real&#8208;Time Multi&#8208;Photon Tracking and Bioimaging of Glycosylated Theranostic Prodrugs upon Specific Enzyme Triggered Release</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Glycosylated theranostic prodrugs have been developed, whereby the therapeutic component undergoes triggered release upon enzyme activation of the glycosidic bond through action of the specific glycosidase enzymes, resulting in selective delivery of the therapeutic cargo, a process observed through real&#8208;time bioimaging.







Abstract
Real&#8208;time tracking of prodrug uptake, delivery and activation in&#8197;vivo represents a major challenge for prodrug development. Herein, we demonstrate the use of novel glycosylated theranostics of the cancer pharmacophore Amonafide in highly&#8208;selective, enzymatic triggered release. We show that the use of endogenous enzymes for activated release of the therapeutic component can be observed, in real time, and monitored using one and two&#8208;photon bioimaging, offering unique insight into the prodrug pharmacokinetic profile. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the potent cytotoxicity of Amonafide is preserved using this targeted approach.

         <title>PEGylated Poly&#8208;HDACi: a Designer Polyprodrug from Optimized Drug Units</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We designed, synthesized, and characterized a tri&#8208;block copolymer. Its hydrophobic part, a chain of histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) prodrug, was symmetrically flanked by two identical PEG blocks, whereas the built&#8208;in HDACi was a linear molecule, terminated with a thiol at one end, and a hydroxyl group at the other. Such a feature facilitated end to end linkage of prodrugs through alternatively aligned disulfides and carbonates. The disulfides served dual roles: redox sensors of smart nanomedicine, and warheads of masked HDACi drugs. This approach carefully designed to benefit both control&#8208;release and efficacy, is conceptually novel for optimizing drug units in nanomedicine. Micelles from this designer polyprodrug released only PEG, CO 2 and HDACi, and synergized with DOX against HCT116 cells, demonstrating its widespread potential in combination therapy. Our work for the first time highlighted the unique advantage of thiol&#8208;based drug molecules in nanomedicine design.</dc:description>

The disulfides served dual roles: redox sensors of smart nanomedicine, and warheads of masked HDACi drugs. This approach carefully designed to benefit both control-release and efficacy, is conceptually novel for optimizing drug units in nanomedicine. Micelles from this designer polyprodrug released only PEG, CO 2 and HDACi, and synergized with DOX against HCT116 cells, demonstrating its widespread potential in combination therapy. Our work for the first time highlighted the unique advantage of thiol-based drug molecules in nanomedicine design.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>An ESIPT&#8208;dependent AIE fluorophore based on HBT derivative: substituent positional impact on aggregated luminescence and its application for hydrogen peroxide detection</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aiming to develop the facile organic fluorophore possessing excited state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) and aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE), we designed and synthesized two isomers with different linkage site between hydroxyl of 2&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxyphenyl) benzothiazole (HBT) and a benzothiazole substituent (para position refers to  p&#8208;  BHBT  and ortho position refers to  o&#8208;  BHBT  ). Fluorescence emission properties of  p&#8208;  BHBT  and  o&#8208;  BHBT  in THF/water mixtures with different water volume fractions indicated an opposite luminescence in aggregates, in which  p&#8208;  BHBT  showed an ESIPT&#8208;dependent AIE properties while  o&#8208;  BHBT  displayed ESIPT effect and aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) qualities. A possible mechanism for molecular actions to illustrate the aggregating luminescence alteration of these two isomers had been proposed and verified by theoretical and experimental studies. More importantly,  Probe&#8208;1  , generated from dual ESIPT&#8208;AIE fluorophore  p&#8208;  BHBT  , was successfully used as a ratiometric fluorescent chemosensor for highly selective (above 15&#8208;fold over other ROS) and sensitive (69&#8208;fold fluorescence enhancement with 0.22 &#956;M of detection limit) detection of hydrogen peroxide in aqueous solution and living cells, respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>Catalytic reduction of oximes to hydroxylamines: current methods, challenges and opportunities</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Catalytic reduction of oximes represents a direct efficient approach to synthesize valuable hydroxylamine derivatives. However this transformation presents significant challenges: oximes are hard to reduce and, if reactive, reductive cleavage of the weak N&#8210;O bond often leads to primary amine side products. The first suitable systems involved the use of platinum&#8208;based heterogeneous catalysts with hydrogen as reductant and stoichiometric amounts of a strong Br&#248;nsted acid. More recently metal&#8208;free and transition&#8208;metal&#8208;based homogeneous catalysts have been developed, which display the highest turnovers (up to 4000). In the asymmetric variants, the  E/Z  &#8208;geometry of the oxime double bond affects significantly the stereoselectivity, sometimes requiring extra synthetic efforts in substrate preparation. This minireview provides an overview of the advances and limitations in catalytic oxime to hydroxylamine reduction. Emphasis is put on highlighting and comparing the practical aspects of the existing methods, such as their reaction conditions and substrate scope. Additionally, future directions for improving this young research area are suggested.</dc:description>

         <title>Accessing Cationic &#945;&#8208;Silylated and &#945;&#8208;Germylated Phosphorus Ylides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The synthesis and full characterization of &#945;&#8208;silylated (&#945;&#8208;SiCPs, 1&#8208;7) and &#945;&#8208;germylated (&#945;&#8208;GeCPs) (11&#8208;13) phosphorus ylides bearing one chloride substituent R3PC(R1)E(Cl)R22 (R = Ph; R1 = Me, Et, Ph; R2 = Me, Et, iPr, Mes; E = Si, Ge) is presented. The molecular structures were determined by X&#8208;ray diffraction studies. The title compounds were applied in halide abstraction studies in order to access cationic species. The reaction of Ph3PC(Me)Si(Cl)Me2 (1) with Na[B(C6F5)4] furnished the dimeric phosphonium&#8208;like dication [Ph3PC(Me)SiMe2]2[B(C6F5)4]2 (8). The highly reactive, mesityl&#8208; or iPr&#8208;substituted cationic species [Ph3PC(Me)SiMes2][B(C6F5)4] (9) and [Ph3PC(Et)SiiPr2][B(C6F5)4] (10) could be characterized by NMR spectroscopy. Carrying out the halide abstraction reaction in the sterically demanding ether iPr2O afforded the protonated &#945;&#8208;SiCP [Ph3PCH(Et)Si(Cl)iPr2][B(C6F5)4] (6dec) by sodium mediated basic ether decomposition, whereas successfully synthesized [Ph3PC(Et)SiiPr2][B(C6F5)4] (10) readily cleaves the F&#8211;C bond in fluorobenzene. Thus, the ambiphilic character of &#945;&#8208;SiCPs is clearly demonstrated. The less reactive germanium analogue [Ph3PC(Me)GeMes2][B(3,5&#8208;(CF3)2C6H3)4] (14) was obtained by reacting 11 with Na[B(3,5&#8208;(CF3)2C6H3)4] and fully characterized including X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. Structural parameters indicate a strong CYlide&#8211;Ge interaction with high double bond character, and consequently the C&#8211;E (E = Si, Ge) bonds in 9, 10 and 14 were analyzed with NBO and AIM methods.</dc:description>

         <title>Understanding the Effects of Binders in Gas Sorption and Acidity of Aluminum Fumarate Extrudates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Understanding the impact of shaping processes on solid adsorbents is critical for the implementation of MOFs in industrial separation processes or as catalytic materials. Production of MOF&#8208;containing shaped particles is typically associated with loss of porosity and modification of acid sites, two phenomena that affect their performance. Herein, we report a detailed study on how extrusion affects the crystallinity, porosity, and acidity of the aluminum fumarate MOF with clays or SiO  2  gel binders. Thorough characterization showed that the clay binders confer the extrudates a good mechanical robustness at the expense of porosity, while silica gel shows an opposite trend. The CO  2  selectivity towards CH  4,  of interest for natural gas separation processes, is maintained upon the extrusion process Moreover, probe FT&#8208;IR spectroscopy revealed no major changes in the types of acid sites. This study highlights that these abundant and inexpensive clay materials may be used for scaling MOFs as active adsorbents.</dc:description>

         <title>An isolable gallium&#8208;substituted nitrilimine and its reactivity with B&#8208;H, Si&#8208;H and B&#8208;B bonds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reaction of the Ga(I) compound NacNacGa (  9  ) with the diazo compound N  2  CHSiMe  3  affords the nitrilimine compound NacNacGa(N&#8208;NCSiMe  3  )(CH  2  SiMe  3  ) (  10  ). Carrying out this reaction in the presence of pyridine does not lead to C&#8208;H activation on the transient alkylidene NacNacGa=CHSiMe  3  , but generates a metallated diazo species NacNacGa(NHN=CHSiMe  3  )(CN  2  SiMe  3  ) (  13  ) that further rearranges into the isonitrile compound NacNac&#8208; Ga(NHN=CHSiMe  3  )(N(NC)SiMe  3  ) (  15  ). Reactions of  10  with the silane H  3  SiPh and the borane HBcat furnished products of 1,3 addition to the nitrilimine moiety NacNacGa{N(ER  n  )NCSiMe  3  }(CH  2  SiMe  3  ), whereas reaction with the diborane B  2  cat  2  gave the product of formal nitrene insertion into the B&#8208;B bond. DFT calculations suggest that the interaction of  9  with N  2  CHSiMe  3  proceeds via intermediate formation of an alkylidene compound that undergoes CH activation with a second molecule of N  2  CHSiMe  3  . Insertion into the B&#8208;B bond likely proceeds via an initial 1,3&#8208;addition of the diborane, followed by boryl migration to the former nitrene center.</dc:description>

         <title>Orthogonal Catalysis for an Enantioselective Domino Inverse&#8208;Electron Demand Diels&#8208;Alder / Substitution Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An enantioselective domino process for the synthesis of substituted 1,2&#8208;dihydronaphthalenes has been developed, by the combination of chiral amines and a bidentate Lewis acid in an orthogonal catalysis. This new method is based on an inverse electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8208;Alder and a subsequent group exchange reaction. An enamine is generated in situ from an aldehyde and a chiral secondary amine catalyst which reacts with phthalazine, activated by the coordination to a bidentate Lewis acid catalyst. The absolute configuration of the product is controlled by chiral information provided by the amine. The formed  ortho  &#8208;quinodimethane intermediate is then transformed via a group exchange reaction with thiols. The new method shows a broad scope and tolerates a wide range of functional groups with enantiomeric ratios up to 91:9. All&#8208;in&#8208;all, this enantioselective synthesis tool provides an easy access to complex 1,2&#8208;dihydronaphthalenes starting from readily available phthalazine, aldehydes and thiols in a combinatorial way.</dc:description>

         <title>Stimuli Induced Uptake of Protein&#8208;Like Peptide Brush Polymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Recently, we presented a strategy for packaging peptides as side&#8208;chains in high&#8208;density brush polymers. For this globular protein&#8208;like polymer (PLP) formulation, therapeutic peptides were shown to resist proteolytic degradation, enter cells efficiently and maintain biological function. In this paper, we establish the role charge plays in dictating the cellular uptake of these peptide formulations, finding that peptides with a net positive charge will enter cells when polymerized, while those formed from anionic or neutral peptides remain outside of cells. Given these findings, we explored whether cellular uptake could be selectively induced by a stimulus. In our design, a cationic peptide is appended to a sequence of charge&#8208;neutralizing anionic amino acids via stimuli&#8208;responsive cleavable linkers. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study, we tested this strategy with two different classes of stimuli, exogenous UV light and an enzyme (a matrix metalloproteinase) associated with the inflammatory response. The key finding is that these materials enter cells only when acted upon by the stimulus. This approach makes it possible to achieve delivery of the polymers, therapeutic peptides or an appended cargo into cells in response to an appropriate stimulus.</dc:description>

         <title>Prebiotically plausible autocatalytic peptide amyloids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The prebiotic emergence of molecules capable of both self&#8208;replication and of storing information was a defining event at the dawn of life. Still, a plausibly prebiotic self&#8208;replication of biologically relevant molecules has not been demonstrated. Building upon the known templating nature of amyloids we present two systems in which the products of a peptide bond&#8208;forming reaction act as self&#8208;replicators to enhance the yield and stereoselectivity of their formation. This first report of an amino acid condensation reaction that can undergo autocatalysis further supports the potential role of amyloids in prebiotic molecular evolution as an environment&#8208;responsive and information&#8208;coding system capable of self&#8208;replication.</dc:description>

         <title>Coordination&#8208;induced band gap reduction in a metal&#8208;organic framework</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report on the synthesis of a microporous, three&#8208;dimensional phosphonate metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) with the composition Cu  3  (H  5  &#8208;MTPPA)  2  &#183;2 NMP (H  8  &#8208;MTPPA = methane tetra&#8208;  p  &#8208;phenylphosphonic acid and NMP = N&#8208;methyl&#8208;2&#8208;pyrrolidone). This MOF, termed TUB1, has a unique one&#8208;dimensional inorganic building unit composed of square planar and distorted trigonal bipyramidal copper atoms. It possesses a (calculated) BET surface area of 766.2 m  2  /g after removal of the solvents from the voids. The Tauc plot for TUB1 yields indirect and direct band gaps of 2.4 eV and 2.7 eV, respectively. DFT calculations reveal the existence of two spin&#8208;dependent gaps of 2.60 eV and 0.48 eV for the alpha and beta spins, respectively, with the lowest unoccupied crystal orbital for both gaps predominantly residing on the square planar copper atoms. The projected density of states suggests that the presence of the square planar copper atoms reduces the overall band gap of TUB1, as the beta&#8208;gap for the trigonal bipyramidal copper atoms is 3.72 eV.</dc:description>

         <title>Photo&#8208; and electrochemical dual&#8208;responsive iridium probe for saccharide detection</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sensing strategies for dual detection systems are of interest for rapid, accurate data collection in  in vitro  testing. We introduce an Ir(III) complex with a boronic acid binding receptor site on the 2&#8208;phenylpyridine ligand as an ideal probe with photo&#8208; and electro&#8208; chemical signals, sensitive to changes of monosaccharide binding. The complex displays orange luminescence at 618 nm which is reduced in intensity upon binding of the monosaccharides, 70 % and 40% for fructose and glucose, respectively. The electrochemiluminescent signal of the complex shows a direct response to monosaccharide binding. The complex&#8217;s luminescence is also responsive to monosaccharide presence in cancer cells. The Ir(III) complex shows the same response upon incorporation into hydrogel matrices, demonstrating the potential of its integration into a device, as a non&#8208;toxic, simple to use tool to observe sugar binding in physiologically relevant pH ranges and saccharide concentrations.</dc:description>

         <title>Pushing the limits of characterising a weak halogen bond in solution</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Detection and characterisation of very weak, non&#8208;covalent interactions in solution is inherently challenging. Low affinity, short complex lifetime and a constant battle against entropy brings even the most sensitive spectroscopic methods to their knees. Herein we introduce a strategy for the accurate experimental description of weak chemical forces in solution. Its scope is demonstrated by the detailed geometric and thermodynamic characterisation of the weak halogen bond of a non&#8209;fluorinated aryl iodide and an ether oxygen (0.6&#160;kJ mol  &#8209;1  ). Our approach makes use of the entropic advantage of studying a weak force intramolecularly, embedded into a cooperatively folding system, and of the combined use of NOE&#8208; and RDC&#8208;based ensemble analyses to accurately describe the orientation of the donor and acceptor sites. Thermodynamic constants (&#916;G, &#916;H and &#916;S), describing the specific interaction, were derived from variable temperature chemical shift analysis. We present a methodology for the experimental investigation of remarkably weak halogen bonds and other related weak forces in solution, paving the way for their improved understanding and strategic use in chemistry and biology.</dc:description>

         <title>THE SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE OF A SECOND METAL ON THE ANTIPROLIFERATIVE PROPERTIES OF THE COMPLEX [Ru(&#951;6&#8208;C10H14)(Cl2)(dmoPTA)].</title>

The crystal structure of 1, 3 and 5 were obtained by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Antiproliferative activity of the complexes was evaluated against colon cancer cell line Caco&#8208;2/TC7 by using the MTT protocol. The monometallic ruthenium complexes 1 and 2 were found to be inactive but the bimetallic complexes 3, 4 and 5 display an increased activity (IC  50  3: 9.07&#177;0.27; IC  50  4: 5.40&#177;0.19; IC  50  5: 7.15&#177;0.30 (&#181;M)) compared to cisplatin (IC  50  = 45.6&#177;8.08 &#181;M). Importantly, no reduction in normal cell viability was observed in the presence of the complexes. Experiments targeted to obtain information on the possible action mechanism of complexes were performed such as cell cycle, ROS and gene expression studies. The result obtained showed that the complexes display different properties and action mechanism depending on the nature of metal, M, bonded to the CH  3  N  dmoPTA  atoms.</dc:description>

         <title>Mn12&#8208;acetate complexes studied as single molecules</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The phenomenon of single molecule magnet (SMM) behaviour of mixed valent Mn  12  coordination clusters of general formula [Mn  III  8  Mn  IV  4  O  12  (RCOO)  16  (H  2  O)  4  ] was exemplified by bulk samples of the archetypal [Mn  III  8  Mn  IV  4  O  12  (CH  3  COO)  16  (H  2  O)  4  ] molecule. The molecular origin of the observed magnetic behaviour has found support from extensive studies on the Mn  12  system within crystalline material or on molecules attached to a variety of surfaces. Here we report the magnetic signature of the isolated cationic species [Mn  12  O  12  (CH  3  COO)  15  (CH  3  CN)]  +  by gas phase X&#8208;ray Magnetic Circular Dichroism (XMCD) spectroscopy closely resembling that of the corresponding bulk samples. Furthermore, we report broken symmetry DFT calculations of spin densities and single ion tensors of the isolated, optimized complexes [Mn  12  O  12  (CH  3  COO)  15  (CH  3  CN)]  +  , [Mn  12  O  12  (CH  3  COO)  16  ], [Mn  12  O  12  (CH  3  COO)  16  (H  2  O)  4  ], and [Mn  III  8  Mn  IV  4  O  12  (CH  3  COO)  16  (H  2  O)  4  ]  (bulk geometry)  . The found magnetic fingerprints &#8211; experiment and theory alike &#8208; are of a remarkable robustness: The Mn  IV  4  core bears almost no magnetic anisotropy while the surrounding Mn  III  8  ring is highly anisotropic. These signatures are truly intrinsic properties of the Mn  12  core scaffold within all of these complexes and largely void of the environment. This likely holds irrespective of bulk packing effects.</dc:description>

         <title>Total Synthesis of Pulvomycin D</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A synthetic route to the pulvomycin class of natural products is presented, which culminated in the first synthesis of a pulvomycin, pulvomycin D. Key elements of the strategy include a pivotal aldol reaction which led to bond formation between the C24&#8208;C40 and the C8&#8208;C23 fragment. The remaining C1&#8208;C7 fragment was attached by a Yamaguchi esterification completing the assembly of the 40 carbon atoms within the main skeleton. Ring closure to the 22&#8208;membered lactone ring was achieved in the final stages of the synthesis by a Heck reaction. The completion of the synthesis required the removal of six silyl protecting groups in combination with olefin formation at C26&#8208;C27 by a Peterson elimination.</dc:description>

         <title>Tris(tetramethylguanidinyl)phosphine: The simplest non&#8208;ionic phosphorus superbase and strongly&#8208;donating phosphine ligand</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the synthesis and properties of the much sought&#8208;after tris(1,1,3,3&#8208;tetramethylguanidinyl) phosphine P(tmg)  3  , a crystalline, superbasic phosphine accessible through a short and scalable procedure from the cheap and commercially available bulk chemicals 1,1,3,3&#8208;tetramethylguanidine, tris(dimethylamino)phosphine and phosphorus trichloride. The new phosphine exhibits exceptional electron donor properties and readily forms transition metal complexes with gold(I), palladium(II) and rhodium(I) precursors. The formation of zwitterionic Lewis base adducts with carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide was explored. In addition, the complete series of phosphine chalcogenides was prepared from the reaction of P(tmg)  3  with N  2  O and the elemental chalcogens.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>This report describes the synthesis of a [2.2]paracyclophane&#8208;derived annulated 3&#8208;amino&#8208;imidazole ligand library  via  a Groebke&#8211;Blackburn&#8211;Bienaym&#233; three&#8208;component reaction (GBB&#8208;3CR) employing formyl&#8208;cyclophanes in combination with diverse aliphatic and aromatic isocyanides and heteroaromatic amidines. The GBB&#8208;3CR gives access to differently functionalized skeletally&#8208;diverse cyclophanyl imidazole ligands, namely 3&#8208;amino&#8208;imidazo[1,2&#8208;  a  ]pyridines and imidazo[1,2&#8208;  a  ]pyrazines. Additionally, a one&#8208;pot protocol for the GBB&#8208;3CR by an  in&#8208;situ  generation of cyclophanyl isocyanide is demonstrated. The product formation was analyzed by detailed spectroscopic techniques, and a cyclophanyl imidazo[1,2&#8208;  a  ]pyridine was confirmed unambiguously by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;Ray crystallography. The cyclophanyl imidazole ligands can be readily transformed to showcase their useful utility in preparing  N  ,  C  &#8208;palladacycles  via  regioselective  ortho  &#8208;palladation.</dc:description>

         <title>Non&#8208;heme&#8208;iron&#8208;mediated selective halogenation of unactivated carbon&#8208;hydrogen bonds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Oxidation of the iron(II) precursor [(L  1  )Fe  II  Cl  2  ] with soluble iodosylbenzene  s  PhIO, where L  1  is a tetradentate bispidine, leads to the extremely reactive ferryl oxidant [(L  1  )(Cl)Fe  IV  =O]  +  with a  cis  disposition of the chlorido and oxido coligands as observed in nonheme halogenase enzymes. Experimental data indicate that, with cyclohexane as substrate, there is selective formation of chlorocyclohexane, where the halogenation is initiated by C&#8208;H abstraction and the result of a rebound of the ensuing radical to an iron&#8208;bound Cl  &#8208;  . The time&#8208;resolved formation of the halogenation product indicates that this primarily results from  s  PhIO oxidation of an initially formed oxido&#8208;bridged diiron(III) resting state. The high yield of up to over 70% (stoichiometric reaction) as well as the differing reactivities of free Fe  2+  and Fe  3+  in comparison with [(L  1  )Fe  II  Cl  2  ] indicate a high complex stability of the bispidine&#8208;iron complexes. A DFT analysis shows that, due to a large driving force and small triplet&#8208;quintet gap, in comparison to other small molecule halogenase models [(L  1  )(Cl)Fe  IV  =O]  +  is the most reactive, that the Fe  III  / radical rebound intermediate has a relatively long lifetime, supported by experimentally observed cage escape, and that this intermediate has, as observed experimentally, a lower energy barrier to the halogenation than the hydroxylation product, and this is shown to primarily be due to steric effects.</dc:description>
