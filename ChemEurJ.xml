         <title>How to Look for Compounds: Predictive Screening and in&#8197;situ Studies in Na&#8722;Zn&#8722;Bi System</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A structure prediction algorithm was used to assess the stability of the ternary compounds in the Na&#8722;Zn&#8722;Bi system followed by rapid experimental screening via the hydride synthesis route and in&#8197;situ synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction studies. Such a synergistic approach has yielded four new compounds in the previously &#8220;empty&#8221; Na&#8722;Zn&#8722;Bi system. The advanced electronic structure calculation for the synthesized compounds were performed to rationalize the experimentally observed non&#8208;stoichiometry, while in&#8197;situ powder X&#8208;ray diffraction revealed the high&#8208;temperature polymorphism.







Abstract
Here, the combination of theoretical computations followed by rapid experimental screening and in&#8197;situ diffraction studies is demonstrated as a powerful strategy for novel compounds discovery. When applied for the previously &#8220;empty&#8221; Na&#8722;Zn&#8722;Bi system, such an approach led to four novel phases. The compositional space of this system was rapidly screened via the hydride route method and the theoretically predicted NaZnBi (PbClF type, P4/nmm) and Na11Zn2Bi5 (Na11Cd2Sb5 type, P
) phases were successfully synthesized, while other computationally generated compounds on the list were rejected. In addition, single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction studies of NaZnBi indicate minor deviations from the stoichiometric 1&#8201;:&#8201;1&#8201;:&#8201;1 molar ratio. As a result, two isostructural (PbClF type, P4/nmm) Zn&#8208;deficient phases with similar compositions, but distinctly different unit cell parameters were discovered. The vacancies on Zn sites and unit cell expansion were rationalized from bonding analysis using electronic structure calculations on stoichiometric &#8220;NaZnBi&#8221;. In&#8208;situ synchrotron powder X&#8208;ray diffraction studies shed light on complex equilibria in the Na&#8722;Zn&#8722;Bi system at elevated temperatures. In particular, the high&#8208;temperature polymorph HT&#8208;Na3Bi (BiF3 type, Fm
m) was obtained as a product of Na11Zn2Bi5 decomposition above 611&#8197;K. HT&#8208;Na3Bi cannot be stabilized at room temperature by quenching, and this type of structure was earlier observed in the high&#8208;pressure polymorph HP&#8208;Na3Bi above 0.5&#8197;GPa. The aforementioned approach of predictive synthesis can be extended to other multinary systems.

         <title>Lewis Acid&#8208;Promoted Oxidative Addition at a [Ni0(diphosphine)2] Complex: The Critical Role of a Secondary Coordination Sphere</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The elementary steps of metal&#8208;mediated catalysis e.&#8201;g., oxidative addition, transmetalation, and reductive elimination are pertinent to the design of superior routes into specialty chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and agrochemicals. For over 50&#8197;years, pioneering work has shown that 18&#8208;electron alkyl/aryl&#8208;substituted diphosphine complexes of Group 10 [M(diphosphine)2] do not oxidatively add haloarenes. Herein, we report a compound that is contrary to this &#8216;rule&#8217;, advancing our understanding of oxidative addition at coordinatively saturated organometallic complexes and providing new opportunities for bond activation.







Abstract
Oxidative addition represents a critical elementary step in myriad catalytic transformations. Here, the importance of thoughtful ligand design cannot be overstated. In this work, we report the intermolecular activation of iodobenzene (PhI) at a coordinatively saturated 18&#8208;electron [Ni0(diphosphine)2] complex bearing a Lewis acidic secondary coordination sphere. Whereas alkyl&#8208;substituted diphosphine complexes of Group 10 are known to be unreactive in such reactions, we show that [Ni0(P2BCy4)2] (P2BCy4=1,2&#8208;bis(di(3&#8208;dicyclohexylboraneyl)&#8208;propylphosphino)ethane) is competent for room&#8208;temperature PhI cleavage to give [NiII(P2BCy4)(Ph)(I)]. This difference in oxidative addition reactivity has been scrutinized computationally &#8211; an outcome that is borne out in ring&#8208;opening to provide the reactive precursor &#8211; for [Ni0(P2BCy4)2], a &#8220;boron&#8208;trapped&#8221; 16&#8208;electron &#954;1&#8208;diphosphine Ni(0) complex. Moreover, formation of [NiII(P2BCy4)(Ph)(I)] is inherent to the P2BCy4 secondary coordination sphere: treatment of the Lewis adduct, [Ni0(P2BCy4)2(DMAP)8] with PhI provides [NiII(P2BCy4)2(DMAP)8(I)]I via iodine&#8208;atom abstraction and not a [NiII(Ph)(I)(diphosphine)] compound &#8211; an unusual secondary sphere effect. Finally, the reactivity of [Ni0(P2BCy4)2] with 4&#8208;iodopyridine was surveyed, which resulted in a pyridyl&#8208;borane linked oligomer. The implications of these outcomes are discussed in the context of designing strongly donating, and yet labile diphosphine ligands for use in a critical bond activation step relevant to catalysis.

Pushing against the limits of all&#8208;atom molecular dynamics simulations&#8242; capability, the agonist lipopolysaccharide&#8208;bound full&#8208;length Toll&#8208;like receptor 4 dimer complex, embedded into a realistic plasma membrane, is addressed. Atomic/molecular and thermodynamic insights are provided for TLR4&#8242;s assembly and biological activity.







Abstract
The Toll&#8208;like receptor 4 (TLR4)/myeloid differentiation factor 2 (MD&#8208;2) innate immunity system is a membrane receptor of paramount importance as therapeutic target. Its assembly, upon binding of Gram&#8208;negative bacteria lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and also dependent on the membrane composition, finally triggers the immune response cascade. We have combined ab&#8208;initio calculations, molecular docking, all&#8208;atom molecular dynamics simulations, and thermodynamics calculations to provide the most realistic and complete 3D models of the active full TLR4 complex embedded into a realistic membrane to date. Our studies give functional and structural insights into the transmembrane domain behavior in different membrane environments, the ectodomain bouncing movement, and the dimerization patterns of the intracellular Toll/Interleukin&#8208;1 receptor domain. Our work provides TLR4 models as reasonable 3D structures for the (TLR4/MD&#8208;2/LPS)2 architecture accounting for the active (agonist) state of the TLR4, and pointing to a signal transduction mechanism across cell membrane. These observations unveil relevant molecular aspects involved in the TLR4 innate immune pathways and will promote the discovery of new TLR4 modulators.

Tetracyanobuta&#8208;1,3&#8208;diene (TCBD) is a powerful and versatile electron&#8208;acceptor moiety widely used for the preparation of electroactive conjugates. Here, we expand the chemical space of such moiety through a high&#8208;yielding cyano&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder synthesis of a novel, thermally&#8208;stable anthryl&#8208;fused&#8208;TCBD derivative which presents intriguing physicochemical properties.







Abstract
Tetracyanobuta&#8208;1,3&#8208;diene (TCBD) is a powerful and versatile electron&#8208;acceptor moiety widely used for the preparation of electroactive conjugates. While many reports addressing its electron&#8208;accepting capability have appeared in the literature, significantly scarcer are those dealing with its chemical modification, a relevant topic which allows to broaden the chemical space of this interesting functional unit. Here, we report on the first example of a high&#8208;yielding cyano&#8208;Diels&#8208;Alder (CDA) reaction between TCBD, that is, where a nitrile group acts as a dienophile, and an anthryl moiety, that is, acting as a diene. The resulting anthryl&#8208;fused&#8208;TCBD derivative, which structure was unambiguously identified by X&#8208;ray diffraction, shows high thermal stability, remarkable electron&#8208;accepting capability, and interesting electronic ground&#8208; and excited&#8208;state features, as characterized by a thorough theoretical, electrochemical, and photophysical investigation. Moreover, a detailed kinetic analysis of the intramolecular CDA reaction transforming the anthryl&#8208;TCBD&#8208;based reactant into the anthryl&#8208;fused&#8208;TCBD product was carried out at different temperatures.

         <title>Thermal Expansion Properties and Mechanochemical Synthesis of Stoichiometric Cocrystals Containing Tetrabromobenzene as a Hydrogen&#8208; and Halogen&#8208;Bond Donor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermal expansion defines by composition: Cocrystals containing different stoichiometric ratios of the components 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrabromobenzene (TBrB) and 4,4&#8242;&#8208;azobipyridine (Azo) exhibit dramatically different thermal expansion (TE) behaviors. The components in the stoichiometric cocrystals interact through hydrogen or hydrogen/halogen bonds and differ in &#960;&#8208;stacking arrangements. The structural differences results in the unique TE behaviors for each solid. The cocrystals form concomitantly, and mechanochemical synthesis demonstrates that mixtures or pure phases can be synthesized by varying the feed ratios of the components.







Abstract
The solution and mechanochemical synthesis of two cocrystals that differ in the stoichiometric ratio of the components (stoichiometric cocrystals) is reported. The components in the stoichiometric cocrystals interact through hydrogen or hydrogen/halogen bonds and differ in &#960;&#8208;stacking arrangements. The difference in structure and noncovalent interactions affords dramatically different thermal expansion behaviors in the two cocrystals. At certain molar ratios, the cocrystals are obtained concomitantly; however, by varying the ratios, a single stoichiometric cocrystal is achieved using mechanochemistry.

         <title>Turning the Light on Phenols: New Opportunities in Organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phenols in the spotlight: Phenol and its derivatives are key moieties in organic chemistry. Conventionally, they are prepared through thermal functionalization strategies that present several drawbacks. Recently, alternative photochemical approaches have been implemented that involves phenols both as light&#8208;harvesting substrates or as photo&#8208;redox catalysts. This Minireview summarizes the most relevant examples within this field, highlighting the great versatility of simple phenolic frameworks in organic synthesis.







Abstract
Phenols (I) are extremely relevant chemical functionalities in natural, synthetic and industrial chemistry. Their corresponding electron&#8208;rich anions, namely phenolates (I), are characterized by interesting physicochemical properties that can be drastically altered upon light excitation. Specifically, phenolates (I) become strong reducing agents in the excited state and are able to generate reactive radicals from suitable precursors via single&#8208;electron transfer processes. Thus, these species can photochemically trigger strategic bond&#8208;forming reactions, including their direct aromatic C&#8722;H functionalization. Moreover, substituted phenolate anions can act as photocatalysts to enable synthetically useful organic transformations. An alternative mechanistic manifold is represented by the ability of phenolate derivatives I to form ground state electron donor&#8208;acceptor (EDA) complexes with electron&#8208;poor radical sources. These complementary scenarios have paved the way for the development of a wide range of relevant organic reactions. In this Minireview, we present the main examples of this research field, and give insight on emerging trends in phenols photocatalysis towards richer organic synthesis.

         <title>Elastic Organic Crystals Based on Barbituric Derivative: Multi&#8208;faceted Bending and Flexible Optical Waveguide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A molecule (DBDT) was synthesized by a simple one&#8208;step reaction, and the centimeter&#8208;scale needle&#8208;like crystals were prepared by slow volatilization in DCM/CH3OH (v/v=2/8). Upon applying or removing the mechanical force, both the (100) and (040) faces of the needle&#8208;like crystal showed reversible bending behaviour, showing the nature of multi&#8208;faceted bending. Fortunately, the elastic crystals also exhibited optical waveguide characteristics in straight or bent state.







Abstract
Elastic organic single crystals with light&#8208;emitting and multi&#8208;faceted bending properties are extremely rare. They have potential application in optical materials and have attracted the extensive attention of researchers. In this paper, we reported a structurally simple barbituric derivative DBDT, which was easily crystallized and gained long needle&#8208;like crystals (centimeter&#8208;scale) in DCM/CH3OH (v/v=2/8). Upon applying or removing the mechanical force, both the (100) and (040) faces of the needle&#8208;like crystal showed reversible bending behaviour, showing the nature of multi&#8208;faceted bending. The average hardness (H) and elastic modulus (E) were 0.28&#177;0.01&#8197;GPa and 4.56&#177;0.03&#8197;GPa for the (040) plane, respectively. Through the analysis of the single crystal data, it could be seen that the van der waals (C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; and C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;C), H&#8208;bond (C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O) and &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions between molecules were responsible for the generation of the crystal elasticity. Interestingly, elastic crystals exhibited optical waveguide characteristics in straight or bent state. The optical loss coefficients measured at 627&#8197;nm were 0.7&#8197;dBmm&#8722;1 (straight state) and 0.9&#8197;dBmm&#8722;1 (bent state), while the optical loss coefficient (&#945;) were 1.5&#8197;dBmm&#8722;1 (straight state) and 1.8&#8197;dBmm&#8722;1 (bent state) at 567&#8197;nm. Notably, the elastic organic molecular crystal based on barbituric derivative could be used as the candidate for flexible optical devices.

The average hardness (&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;) and elastic modulus (&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;) were 0.28&#177;0.01&#8197;GPa and 4.56&#177;0.03&#8197;GPa for the (040) plane, respectively. Through the analysis of the single crystal data, it could be seen that the van der waals (C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; and C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;C), H-bond (C&#8722;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O) and &#960;&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;&#960; interactions between molecules were responsible for the generation of the crystal elasticity. Interestingly, elastic crystals exhibited optical waveguide characteristics in straight or bent state. The optical loss coefficients measured at 627&#8197;nm were 0.7&#8197;dBmm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; (straight state) and 0.9&#8197;dBmm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; (bent state), while the optical loss coefficient (&#945;) were 1.5&#8197;dBmm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; (straight state) and 1.8&#8197;dBmm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; (bent state) at 567&#8197;nm. Notably, the elastic organic molecular crystal based on barbituric derivative could be used as the candidate for flexible optical devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Kinetic Stabilization of Blue&#8208;Emissive Anthracenes: Phenylene Bridging Works Best</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In attempts at kinetically stabilizing blue&#8208;emissive anthracenes a series of 9,10&#8208;biarylated derivatives were investigated. Bis&#8208;meta&#8208;terphenylyl substitution highly increased photochemical and photooxidative stability. Ring closure to [6]cyclo&#8208;meta&#8208;hexaphenylene bridged anthracene increased protection even further resulting in an additional stabilization.







Abstract
In attempts at kinetically stabilizing blue&#8208;emissive anthracenes, a series of 9,10&#8208;diaryl substituted derivatives were tested for their photochemical and photooxidative persistence. A major breakthrough in light fastness comes from a new bis&#8208;meta&#8208;terphenylyl substituted anthracene which is much superior to industrially relevant 9,10&#8208;biarylated anthracenes. The key issue is the steric shielding of the anthracene core. Further, intramolecular ring closure via Yamamoto coupling furnished a doubly bridged anthracene as a &#8220;self&#8208;encapsulated&#8221; sky&#8208;blue emitter which is most resistant to photodegradation. The improved stabilization was corroborated by time&#8208;resolved irradiation experiments and rationalized by X&#8208;ray crystallography.

         <title>A Molecular Photosensitizer in a Porous Block Copolymer Matrix&#8208;Implications for the Design of Photocatalytically Active Membranes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Ru photosensitizer covalently bound to a porous block copolymer membrane to be used in photocatalytic systems exhibits an additional charge transfer process unobserved in aprotic solvents due to protonation from water molecules absorbed in the polymer. The inhomogeneity due to different orientations of the bound photosensitizer together with its rigidity in the polymer could serve as important set screws for controlling the overall photocatalytic efficiency.







Abstract
Recently, porous photocatalytically active block copolymer membranes were introduced, based on heterogenized molecular catalysts. Here, we report the integration of the photosensitizer, i.&#8201;e., the light absorbing unit in an intermolecular photocatalytic system into block copolymer membranes in a covalent manner. We study the resulting structure and evaluate the orientational mobility of the photosensitizer as integral part of the photocatalytic system in such membranes. To this end we utilize transient absorption anisotropy, highlighting the temporal reorientation of the transition dipole moment probed in a femtosecond pump&#8208;probe experiment. Our findings indicate that the photosensitizer is rigidly bound to the polymer membrane and shows a large heterogeneity of absolute anisotropy values as a function of location probed within the matrix. This reflects the sample inhomogeneity arising from different protonation states of the photosensitizer and different intermolecular interactions of the photosensitizers within the block copolymer membrane scaffold.

         <title>Reactivity of the Bicyclic Amido&#8208;Substituted Silicon(I) Ring Compound Si4{N(SiMe3)Mes}4 with FLP&#8208;type Character</title>

         <dc:description>The bicyclic amido&#8208;substituted silicon(I) ring compound Si  4  {N(SiMe  3  )Mes}  4  2  (Mes = Mesityl = 2,4,6&#8208;Me  3  C  6  H  2  ) features enhanced zwitterionic character and different reactivity compared to the analogous compound Si  4  {N(SiMe  3  )Dipp}  4  1  (Dipp = 2,6&#8208;  i  Pr  2  C  6  H  3  ) due to the smaller mesityl substituents. In a reaction with the  N  heterocyclic carbene (1,3,4,5&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;ylidene = NHC  Me4  ) we observe adduct formation to Si  4  {N(SiMe  3  )Mes}  4  &#8729;NHC  Me4  (  3  ). This adduct reacts further with the Lewis acid BH  3  to yield the Lewis acid base complex Si  4  {N(SiMe  3  )Mes}  4  &#8729;NHC  Me4  &#8729;BH  3  (  4  ). Coordination of AlBr  3  to  2  leads to the adduct  5  . Calculated proton affinities and fluoride ion affinities reveal highly Lewis basic and very weak Lewis acidic character of the low&#8208;valent silicon atoms in  1  and  2  .

         <title>Explaining the Advantageous Impact of Tertiary versus Secondary Nitrogen Centre on the Activity of PNP&#8208;Pincer Co(I)&#8208;Complexes for Catalytic Hydrogenation of CO2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Pincer ligated coordination complexes of base metals have shown remarkable catalytic activity for hydrogenation/dehydrogenation of CO  2  .&#160;The recently reported MeN[CH  2  CH  2  i  Pr  2  )]  2  Co(I)PNP&#8208;pincer complex was shown to exhibit substantially higher catalytic activity in comparison to the corresponding catalyst,&#160; HN[CH  2  CH  2  i  Pr  2  )]  2  Co(I)PNP, bearing a secondary nitrogen center on the pincer ligand. Here, we computationally investigate the mechanisms for hydrogenation of CO  2  to formate catalyzed by these two Co&#8208;PNP complexes to explain how such a small structural difference could have a sizable impact on their catalytic activity. Plausible hydrogenation routes were examined in details and our findings provide solid support for the experimental observations. Our results reveal that such trends in catalytic activity could be explained from the lower activation barrier for the hydride transfer step upon changing the pincer nitrogen center from secondary to tertiary.</dc:description>

         <title>Photochemical Hydrogen Evolution at Metal Centers Probed with Hydrated Aluminum Cations, Al+(H2O)n, n = 1&#8211;10</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrated aluminum cations are investigated as a photochemical model system with up to 10 water molecules by UV action spectroscopy in a Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FT&#8208;ICR) mass spectrometer. Intense photodissociation has been observed starting at 4.5 eV ranging from two to eight water molecules by loss of atomic hydrogen, molecular hydrogen and water molecules. Quantum chemical calculations for  n  = 2 reveal that solvation shifts the intense 3s&#8208;3p excitations of Al+  into the investigated photon energy range below 5.5 eV. During the photochemical relaxation, internal conversion from S1  to T2  takes place, and photochemical hydrogen formation starts on the T2  surface, which passes through a conical intersection, changing to T1  . On this triplet surface, the electron that was excited to the Al 3p orbital is transferred to a coordinated water molecule, which dissociates into a hydroxide ion and a hydrogen atom. If the system remains in the triplet state, this hydrogen radical is lost directly. If the system returns to singlet multiplicity, the reaction may be reversed, with recombination with the hydroxide moiety and electron transfer back to aluminum, resulting in water evaporation. Alternatively, the hydrogen radical can attack the intact water molecule, forming molecular hydrogen and aluminum dihydroxide. Photodissociation is observed up to  n  = 8. Clusters with  n  = 9,10 occur exclusively as HAlOH+(H2O)n  &#8211;1  and are transparent in the investigated energy range. For  n  = 4&#8211;8, a mixture of Al+(H2O)n  and HAlOH+(H2O)n  &#8211;1  is present in the experiment.</dc:description>

Intense photodissociation has been observed starting at 4.5 eV ranging from two to eight water molecules by loss of atomic hydrogen, molecular hydrogen and water molecules. Quantum chemical calculations for  n  = 2 reveal that solvation shifts the intense 3s-3p excitations of Al+  into the investigated photon energy range below 5.5 eV. During the photochemical relaxation, internal conversion from S1  to T2  takes place, and photochemical hydrogen formation starts on the T2  surface, which passes through a conical intersection, changing to T1  . On this triplet surface, the electron that was excited to the Al 3p orbital is transferred to a coordinated water molecule, which dissociates into a hydroxide ion and a hydrogen atom. If the system remains in the triplet state, this hydrogen radical is lost directly. If the system returns to singlet multiplicity, the reaction may be reversed, with recombination with the hydroxide moiety and electron transfer back to aluminum, resulting in water evaporation. Alternatively, the hydrogen radical can attack the intact water molecule, forming molecular hydrogen and aluminum dihydroxide. Photodissociation is observed up to  n  = 8. Clusters with  n  = 9,10 occur exclusively as HAlOH+(H2O)n  &#8211;1  and are transparent in the investigated energy range. For  n  = 4&#8211;8, a mixture of Al+(H2O)n  and HAlOH+(H2O)n  &#8211;1  is present in the experiment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Diastereoselective [2+2+1] Hydrative Annulation of Phenol&#8208;Linked 1,6&#8208;Enynes With Acetylenes Through Rhodium Catalysis: A Rapid Access to Cyclopenta[b]benzofuranols**</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>An unprecedented [2+2+1] hydrative annulation of 1,6&#8208;enynes with terminal alkynes is achieved using catalytic cationic Rh(I). Thus, a modular assembly of cyclopenta[b]benzofuranols with two consecutive quarternary stereocenters is achieved from readily available alkynes. The reaction is proposed to go through a sequence of 5&#8208;membered rhoda&#8208;cycle formation, regioselective acetylene insertion, 1,5 H&#8208;shift, substrate controlled stereoselective addition of water molecule followed by 1,2&#8208;rhodium migration gave contracted rhoda&#8208;cycle D and reductive elimination. Necessary control/labelling experiments were conducted to gain insight in to the mechanism.</dc:description>

         <title>Advancing inorganic coordination chemistry by spectroscopy of isolated molecules: methods and applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A unique feature of the work carried out in the Collaborative Research Center 3MET continues to be its emphasis on innovative, advanced experimental methods which hyphenate mass&#8208;selection with further analytical tools such as laser spectroscopy for the study of  isolated  molecular ions. This allows to probe the intrinsic properties of the species of interest free of perturbing solvent or matrix effects. This review explains these methods and uses examples from past and ongoing 3MET studies of specific classes of multicenter metal complexes to illustrate how coordination chemistry can be advanced by applying them. As a corollary, we will show how the challenges involved in providing well&#8208;defined, e.g. monoisomeric, samples of the molecular ions have helped to further improve the methods themselves thus also making them applicable to many other areas of chemistry.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>This paper reports the first example of C&#8211;H arylation of benzene under mild conditions, using H  2  as an electron source {turnover numbers (TONs) = 0.7&#8211;2.0 for 24 h}. The reaction depends on a Rh&#8208;based electron storage catalyst, and proceeds at room temperature and in aqueous solution. Furthermore, the H  2  is inactive during the radical transfer step, greatly reducing unwanted side reactions.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, we report that a cobalt catalyst permits the general synthesis of substituted alkynylsilanes via dehydrogenative coupling of alkylnylsilanes and hydrosilanes. Several silylated alkynes were prepared in a one&#8208;step procedure, including di&#8208; and trisubstituted ones. 36 compounds were synthesized for the first time applying our catalyst system. The alkynylsilanes bearing hydrosilyl moieties provide an opportunity for further functionalizations (e.g., hydrosilylation). &#160;The use of primary silanes as substrates and pre&#8208;catalyst activators permits the utilization of inexpensive and easily accessible 3d metal pre&#8208;catalysts and avoids the presence of additional activators.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The electron&#8208;rich Pt complex [Pt(IMes)  2  ] (IMes: [1,3bis(2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenyl)&#8208;2&#8208;imidazolinylidine]) can be used as precursor for the syntheses of a variety of fluorido ligand containing compounds.

Compound  trans  [Pt(H)(F)(IMes)  2  ] converts in the presence of CsF into  trans  [Pt(F)(IMes&#8217;)(IMes)].&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tunable linear and nonlinear optical properties from room temperature phosphorescent cyclic triimidazole&#8208;pyrene bio&#8208;probe</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic materials with multiple emissions tunable by external stimuli represent a great challenge. TTPyr, crystallizing in different polymorphs, shows a very rich photophyisics comprising excitation&#8208;dependent fluorescence and phosphorescence at ambient conditions, and mechanochromic and thermochromic behavior. Transformation among the different species has been followed by thermal and X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis and the emissive features interpreted through structural results and DFT/TDDFT calculations. Particularly intriguing is the polymorph obtained at high temperature, TTPyr(HT), whose non&#8208;centrosymmetric structure guarantees an SHG efficiency 10 times higher than that of standard urea. Its crystal packing, where only the TT units are strongly rigidified by &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions while the Pyr moieties possess partial conformational freedom, is responsible for the observed dual fluorescence. The potentialities of TTPyr for bioimaging have been successfully established.</dc:description>

         <title>Fast and efficient postsynthetic DNA labeling in cells by means of strain&#8208;promoted sydnone&#8208;alkyne cycloadditions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sydnones are highly stable mesoionic 1,3&#8208;dipoles that react with cyclooctynes via strain&#8208;promoted sydnone&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (SPSAC). While they have been shown to be valuable bioorthogonal chemical reporters for the labeling of proteins and complex glycans, nucleic acids, however, have not yet been tagged via SPSAC. Evaluation of the SPSAC kinetics with model substrates showed fast reactions with cyclooctyne probes (up to k=0.191 M&#8722;1 s&#8722;1) and two different sydnones were effectively incorporated into both 2&#8217;&#8208;deoxyuridines at position 5, and 7&#8208;deaza&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;deoxyadenosines at position 7. These modified nucleosides were synthetically incorporated into single&#8208;stranded DNA, which were successfully postsynthetically labeled with cyclooctyne probes both in vitro and in cells. These results show that sydnones are versatile bioorthogonal tags and have the premise to become essential tools for tracking DNA and potentially RNA in living cells.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Chitin and peptidoglycan fragments are well recognized as pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Long&#8208;chain oligosaccharides of &#946;(1&#8594;4)&#8208;linked  N  &#8208;acetyl&#8208;D&#8208;glucosamine (GlcNAc) units indeed activate plants and mammals innate immune system. However, the mechanisms underlying PAMPs perception by lysine motif (LysM) domain receptors remain largely unknown because of insufficient availability of high&#8208;affinity molecular probes. Here, we report a two&#8208;enzyme cascade to synthesize long&#8208;chain &#946;(1&#8594;4)&#8208;linked GlcNAc oligomers. Expression of the D52S mutant of hen egg&#8208;white lysozyme (HEWL) in  Pichia pastoris  at 52 mg.L  &#8208;1  provided a new glycosynthase catalyzing efficient polymerization of &#945;&#8208;chitintriosyl fluoride. Selective  N  &#8208;deacetylation at the non&#8208;reducing unit of the glycosyl fluoride donor by  Sinorhizobium meliloti  NodB chitin&#8208;  N  &#8208;deacetylase abolished its ability to be polymerized by the glycosynthase but not to be transferred onto an acceptor. Using NodB and D52S HEWL in a one&#8208;pot cascade reaction allowed the synthesis of chitin hexa&#8208;, hepta&#8208; and octasaccharides with yields up to 65% and a perfect control over their size.</dc:description>

         <title>Enantiodivergent One&#8208;Pot Synthesis of Axially Chiral Biaryls Using Organocatalyst&#8208;Mediated Enantioselective Domino Reaction and Central&#8208;to&#8208;Axial Chirality Conversion</title>

         <dc:description>
Enantiodivergent one&#8208;pot synthesis of axially chiral biaryls was developed using a catalytic amount of a chiral source. A domino organocatalyst&#8208;mediated enantioselective Michael/aldol condensation and enantiodivergent central&#8208;to&#8208;axial chirality conversion afforded chiral biaryls with excellent enantioselectivity in a single reaction vessel. A plausible reaction mechanism for the enantiodivergence was proposed.







Abstract
Enantiodivergent one&#8208;pot synthesis of biaryls was developed using a catalytic amount of a single chiral source. A domino organocatalyst&#8208;mediated enantioselective Michael reaction and aldol condensation provided centrally chiral dihydronaphthalenes with excellent enantioselectivity, from which an enantiodivergent chirality conversion from central&#8208;to&#8208;axial chirality was achieved. Both enantiomers of biaryls were obtained with excellent enantioselectivity. All transformations can be conducted in a single reaction vessel. A plausible reaction mechanism for the enantiodivergence is proposed.

Novel alkynyl&#8208;functionalized diarylbis(dimethylamino)diboranes(4) were prepared and reacted with mono&#8208; and dihydroboranes, leading to hydroboration of the alkyne groups. The products are discrete boryl&#8208;appended diborane(4) species and oligomeric species, and are the first known examples of well&#8208;characterized macromolecular species with boron&#8208;boron bonds. The oligomeric products were found to comprise up to ten repeat units, and are soluble in common organic solvents.







Abstract
A number of novel alkynyl&#8208;functionalized diarylbis(dimethylamino)diboranes(4) are prepared by salt metathesis, and the appended alkynyl groups are subjected to hydroboration. Their reactions with monohydroboranes lead to discrete boryl&#8208;appended diborane(4) species, while dihydroboranes induce their catenation to oligomeric species, the first known examples of well&#8208;characterized macromolecular species with B&#8722;B bonds. The oligomeric species were found to comprise up to ten repeat units and are soluble in common organic solvents. Some of the oligomeric species have good air stability and all were characterized by NMR and vibrational spectroscopy and size&#8208;exclusion chromatography techniques.

         <title>Recent Advances in the Syntheses and Catalytic Applications of Homonuclear Ru&#8208;, Rh&#8208;, and Ir&#8208;Complexes of CNHC^C Cyclometalated Ligands</title>

         <dc:description>
Cyclometalation is one of the modest ways to access vibrant metallacycles via C&#8722;H activation. The simple modifications in NHC based ligands and synthesis procedure may generate a library of cyclometalated complexes with varying stereoelectronic properties. This Minireview is the collection of recently (2015&#8211;May 2021) reported examples of Ru&#8208;, Rh&#8208;, and Ir&#8208;based CNHC^C cyclometalated complexes (synthesis and reactivity) and their applications in homogeneous catalysis.







Abstract
In the past few decades, chemistry of cyclometalated species has gained momentum with increased applications in several areas of scientific developments. Cyclometalation reactions result in the formation of stable metallacycles through the generation of metal&#8208;carbon covalent bonds by activating the unreactive Csp2&#8208;H or Csp3&#8208;H bonds. The extra stability gained by the formation of metallacycles enhances their applicability scopes especially in the area of homogeneous catalysis. In the recent research development in this area, NHC ligands (strong &#963;&#8208;donor and generally, weak &#960;&#8208;acceptor) have been found to be one of the most suitable candidates for the intramolecular C&#8722;H activation process which leads to the cyclometalated species. The growth in the area of cyclometalation chemistry that started in the late 20th century is still continuing and in the past few decades, various examples of NHC derived transition metal&#8208;based cyclometalated complexes came into the picture. As covering all the reported literatures in this area (includes mainly late transition metals) will exceed the limits of minireview, we restricted ourselves to the recent (2015 &#8211; May 2021) examples of the most common Ru&#8208;, Rh&#8208;, and Ir&#8208;based CNHC^C cyclometalated complexes and their applications in various homogeneous catalytic conversions such as transfer hydrogenation, amidation, oxidation of alcohols, annulations, and so forth.

         <title>Diphosphino&#8208;Functionalized 1,8&#8208;Naphthyridines: a Multifaceted Ligand Platform for Boranes and Diboranes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Five diphosphino&#8208;functionalized 1,8&#8208;naphthyridine (NDP)&#8208;based boron compounds were synthesized via two different methods: direct coordination and salt elimination. In these NDP&#8208;based boron compounds, NDP behaves as a flexible, multifaceted ligand. For example, it functions as a tridentate ligand toward B2Br4 and as a bidentate ligand for BBr3. Furthermore, NDP binds through only one nitrogen to a diaminodiborane to furnish tri&#8208; and tetraamino diboranes.







Abstract
A 1,8&#8208;naphthyridine diphosphine (NDP) reacts with boron&#8208;containing Lewis acids to generate complexes featuring a number of different naphthyridine bonding modes. When exposed to diborane B2Br4, NDP underwent self&#8208;deprotonation to afford [NDP&#8208;B2Br3]Br, an unsymmetrical diborane comprised of four fused rings. The reaction of two equivalents of monoborane BBr3 and NDP in a non&#8208;polar solvent provided the simple phosphine&#8208;borane adduct [NDP(BBr3)2], which then underwent intramolecular halide abstraction to furnish the salt [NDP&#8208;BBr2][BBr4], featuring a different coordination mode from that of [NDP&#8208;B2Br3]Br. Direct deprotonation of NDP by KHMDS or PhCH2K generates mono&#8208; and dipotassium reagents, respectively. The monopotassium reagent reacts with one or half an equivalent of B2(NMe2)2Cl2 to afford NDP&#8208;based diboranes with three or four amino substituents.

         <title>Highly Efficient Simulated Solar Light&#8208;Driven Photocatalytic Degradation of 4&#8208;Nitrophenol over CdS/Carbon/MoSx Hybrids</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel photocatalytic system is readily synthesized through a microwave&#8208;assisted hydrothermal process. The CdS/MoSx heterojunction using ascorbic acid&#8208;derived carbon as cocatalyst degrades 4&#8208;nitrophenol about 9 times faster than neat CdS. The enhancement of photocatalytic activity towards the degradation of an organic pollutant originates from efficient charge separation in the formed heterojunctions.







Abstract
Among the various organic pollutants and industrial chemicals, 4&#8208;nitrophenol has been one of the most monitored substances in aqueous environments, due to its enhanced solubility in such systems. This research reports for the first time the microwave&#8208;assisted synthesis of CdS/carbon/MoSx hybrids and the subsequent utilization of such systems as photocatalysts for 4&#8208;nitrophenol degradation. The hybrids demonstrated a variable photocatalytic activity, by using a variety of organic substances as precursors for the solvothermal carbonization step. By using ascorbic acid as precursor, the corresponding ternary composite exhibited excellent photocatalytic activity, with the 4&#8208;nitrophenol concentration been almost quantitatively decayed within 45&#8197;min of irradiation. This could be ascribed due to the generation of a high population of heterojunctions as well as the chemical speciation of Mo&#8208;based nanostructures. Such ternary hybrids may be utilized as potential photocatalytic systems in processes, where removal of toxic water&#8208;soluble substances is the key issue.

Semi&#8208;telescoped continuous flow synthesis of both glipizide and glibenclamide are demonstrated herein which is accompanied by an overall yield of 80&#8211;85&#8201;% within 10&#8197;min total residence time.







Abstract
Glipizide and glibenclamide remain some of the widely prescribed antidiabetic sulfonylurea drugs for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Herein the authors report on an isocyanate&#8208;free synthetic procedure towards the preparation of these on demand drugs at multigram scale using continuous flow technology. The safety concern over the use of isocyanates in most of the existing synthetic routes was dealt with in this present work by using N&#8208;carbamates synthesised in&#8197;situ from activation of amines with chloroformates as safer alternatives. An overall yield of 80&#8211;85&#8201;% was obtained for the semi&#8208;telescoped steps within 10&#8197;min total residence time.

         <title>Donor&#8208;Stabilised [SbF4]+: SbF5 as a Fluoride&#8208;Ion Donor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ability of the strong Lewis acid SbF5 to act as a fluoride&#8208;ion donor has been demonstrated for the first time through the synthesis of donor&#8208;stabilised [SbF4]+ cations. In the presence of bidentate N&#8208;donor ligands, SbF5 undergoes ligand&#8208;induced autoionisation to yield robust [SbF4(L&#8722;L)]+ (L&#8722;L=2,2&#8217;bipyridine or 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline) salts. DFT calculations and NBO analyses show strong Sb&#8722;N interactions that are necessary to stabilise the [SbF4]+ cation.







Abstract
Antimony pentafluoride is a strong Lewis acid and fluoride&#8208;ion acceptor that has not previously demonstrated any discreet fluoride&#8208;ion donor properties. The first donor&#8208;stabilised [SbF4]+ cations were prepared from the autoionisation of SbF5 in the presence of bidentate N&#8208;donor ligands 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine (bipy) and 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline (phen) as their [SbF6]&#8722; salts. The [SbF4(N&#8722;N)][Sb2F11] (N&#8722;N=bipy, phen) salts were synthesised by the addition of one equivalent of SbF5&#8901;SO2 to [SbF4(N&#8722;N)][SbF6] in liquid SO2.

     alt="Donor-Stabilised [SbF4]+: SbF5 as a Fluoride-Ion Donor"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ability of the strong Lewis acid SbF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; to act as a fluoride-ion donor has been demonstrated for the first time through the synthesis of donor-stabilised [SbF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cations. In the presence of bidentate N-donor ligands, SbF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; undergoes ligand-induced autoionisation to yield robust [SbF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(L&#8722;L)]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (L&#8722;L=2,2&#8217;bipyridine or 1,10-phenanthroline) salts. DFT calculations and NBO analyses show strong Sb&#8722;N interactions that are necessary to stabilise the [SbF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antimony pentafluoride is a strong Lewis acid and fluoride-ion acceptor that has not previously demonstrated any discreet fluoride-ion donor properties. The first donor-stabilised [SbF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cations were prepared from the autoionisation of SbF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; in the presence of bidentate N-donor ligands 2,2&#8217;-bipyridine (bipy) and 1,10-phenanthroline (phen) as their [SbF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; salts. The [SbF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(N&#8722;N)][Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;] (N&#8722;N=bipy, phen) salts were synthesised by the addition of one equivalent of SbF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;&#8901;SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to [SbF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(N&#8722;N)][SbF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;] in liquid SO&lt;sub&gt;2.&lt;/sub&gt; The salts show remarkable stability and were characterised by Raman spectroscopy and multinuclear NMR spectroscopy. The crystal structures of [SbF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(phen)][SbF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;3CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CN and [SbF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(phen)][SbF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; were determined, showing distorted octahedral cations.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The incorporation of heavy alkali metals into substrates is both challenging and essential for many reactions. Here, we report the formation of thf&#8208;solvated alkali metal benzyl compounds [PhCH  2  M(thf)  n  ] ( M = Na, Rb, Cs). The synthesis was carried out by deprotonation of toluene with the bimetallic mixture n&#8208;butyllithium/alkali metal&#160;tert&#8208;butoxide&#160;and selective crystallization from thf of the defined benzyl compounds. Insights into the molecular structure in the solid as well as in solution state are gained by single crystal X&#8208;ray experiments and NMR spectroscopic studies. The compounds could be successfully used as alkali metal mediating reagents. The example of caesium showed the convenient use by deprotonating acidic C&#8211;H as well as N&#8211;H compounds to gain insight into the aminometalation using these reagents.</dc:description>

         <title>The Effect of Water on the 2&#8208;Propanol Oxidation Activity of Co&#8208;Substituted LaFe1&#8208;xCoxO3 Perovskites</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Perovskites are interesting oxidation catalysts due to their chemical flexibility enabling the tuning of several properties. In this work, we synthesized LaFe  1&#8208;x  Co  x  O  3  catalysts by co&#8208;precipitation and thermal decomposition, characterized them thoroughly and studied their 2&#8208;propanol oxidation activity under dry and wet conditions to bridge the knowledge gap between gas and liquid phase reactions. Transient tests showed a highly active, unstable low&#8208;temperature (LT) reaction channel in conversion profiles and a stable, less&#8208;active high&#8208;temperature (HT) channel. Cobalt incorporation had a positive effect on the activity. The effect of water was negative on the LT channel, whereas the HT channel activity was boosted for x&gt;0.15. The boost maybe originated from a slower deactivation rate of the Co  3+  sites under wet conditions and a higher amount of hydroxide species on the surface comparing wet and dry feeds. Water addition resulted in a slower deactivation for Co&#8208;rich catalysts and higher activity in the HT channel state.</dc:description>

         <title>Position Matters: Fluorescent Positional Isomers for Reversible Multichannel Encryption Devices</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Fluorescence signals have been widely used in information encryption for a few decades, but still suffer from limited reliability. Here, reversible multichannel fluorescent devices with encrypted information were constructed, based on two fluorescent positional isomers of a diphenylquinoxaline derivative. Possessing the same core fluorescent group and acid&#8208;/pH&#8208;responsive mechanism, the two isomers showed different fluorescence color in an acidic environment, which allowed us to realize stepwise encryption of information in orthogonal fluorescence channels. Since the protonation was reversible, the revealed information could be re&#8208;encrypted, simply by heating. This approach highlights the value of positional isomers to build multichannel encryption devices, improving their reliability on the molecular level.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A linear double pyridinium&#8208;terminated thread comprising a central chalcone moiety is shown to provide two independent binding sites with similar affinity for cucurbit[7]uril (CB7) macrocycles in water as judged from NMR, UV&#8208;Visible and fluorescence spectroscopies. Association results in [2] and [3]pseudorotaxanes, which are both pH and photosensitive. Switching from the neutral chalcone to the cationic flavylium form upon irradiation at 365 nm under acidic conditions provided an enhanced CB7 association (  K  1:1  &#160;increases from&#160;1.2&#160;x&#160;10  5  &#160;M  &#8722;1  &#160;to 1.5&#160;x&#160;10  8  &#160;M  &#8722;1  ), limiting spontaneous on&#8208;thread cucurbituril shuttling.

Threading the flavylium moiety into CB7 leads to a 3&#8208;fold increase in the fluorescence quantum yield, from 0.29 in the free axle to 0.97 in the [2]pseudorotaxane and 1.0 in the [3]pseudorotaxane.</dc:description>

         <title>Controllable Macroscopic Chirality of Coordination Polymers through pH and Anion&#8208;Mediated Weak Interactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Helical architectures with controllable helical sense bias have recently attracted considerable interest for mimicking biological helices and developing novel chiral materials. Coordination polymers (CPs), composed of metal ion nodes and organic linkers, are intriguing systems showing tunable structures and functions. However, CPs with helical morphologies have rarely been explored so far. Particularly, chirality inversion through external stimulus has not been achieved in helical CPs. In this work, we carried out an in&#8208;depth investigation on the self&#8208;assembly of 1D gadolinium(III) phosphonate CPs using GdX  3  (X = Cl, Br, I) and Gd(RSO  3  ) (R = CH  3  , C  6  H  5  , CF  3  ) as metal sources and  R  &#8208;(1&#8208;phenylethylamino)methyl phosphonic acid (  R  &#8208;pempH  2  ) as ligand. Superhelices were formed by precise control of the interchain interactions through different intercalated anions. Furthermore, the twisting direction of superhelices could be controlled by the synergistic effect of anions and pH. This study may provide a new route to fabricate helical nanostructures of CPs with a desirable chiral sense and help understand the inner mechanism of the self&#8208;assembly process of macroscopic helical structures of molecular systems.</dc:description>

         <title>Temperature&#8208;controlled Electrospray Ionization: Recent Progress and Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Native electrospray ionization (ESI) and nanoelectrospray ionization (nESI) allow researchers to analyze intact biomolecules and their complexes by mass spectrometry (MS). The data acquired using these soft ionization techniques provide a snapshot of a given biomolecules structure in solution. Over the last thirty years, several nESI and ESI sources capable of controlling spray solution temperature have been developed. These sources can be used to elucidate the thermodynamics of a given analyte, as well as provide structural information that cannot be readily obtained by other, more commonly used techniques. This review highlights how the field of temperature&#8208;controlled mass spectrometry has developed.</dc:description>

         <title>On the hydrogen oxalate binding motifs onto dinuclear coinage metal phosphine complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We report the binding geometries of the isomers that are formed when the hydrogen oxalate ((CO  2  )  2  H = HOx) anion attaches to dinuclear coinage metal phosphine complexes of the form M  1  M  2  dcpm  2  (HOx) with M=Cu, Ag and dcpm = bis(dicyclohexylphosphino)methane, abbreviated [MM]  +  . These structures are established by comparison of isomer&#8208;selective experimental vibrational band patterns displayed by the cryogenically cooled and N  2  &#8208;tagged cations with DFT calculations of the predicted spectra for various local minima. Two isomeric classes are identified that feature either attachment of the carboxylate oxygen atoms to the two metal centers (end&#8208;on docking) or attachment of oxygen atoms on different carbon atoms asymmetrically to the metal ions (side&#8208;on docking). Within each class, there are additional isomeric variations according to the orientation of the OH group. This behavior indicates that HOx undergoes strong and directional coordination to [CuCu]  +  but adopts a more flexible coordination to [AgAg]  +  . Infrared spectra of the bare ions, fragmentation thresholds and ion mobility measurements are reported to explore the behaviors of the complexes at ambient temperature.</dc:description>

         <title>Indandione&#8208;terminated quinoidal compounds for low&#8208;bandgap small molecules with strong near&#8208;infrared absorption: effect of conjugation length on the properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Low&#8208;bandgap organic semiconductors have attracted much attention for their multiple applications in optoelectronics. However, the realization of narrow bandgap is challenging particularly for small molecules. Herein, we have synthesized four quinoidal compounds, i.e.,  QSN3  ,  QSN4  ,  QSN5  and  QSN6  , with electron rich S,N&#8208;heteroacene as the quinoidal core and indandione as the end&#8208;groups. The optical bandgap of the quinoidal compounds is systematically decreased with the extension of quinoidal skeleton, while maintaining stable closed&#8208;shell ground state.  QSN6  absorbs an intense absorption in the first and second near&#8208;infrared region in the solid state, and has extremely low optical bandgap of 0.74 eV. Cyclic voltammetry analyses reveal that the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of the four quinoidal compounds all lie below &#8722;4.1 eV, resulting in good electron&#8208;transporting characteristics in organic thin&#8208;film transistors. These results demonstrated that the combination of &#960;&#8208;extended quinoidal core and end&#8208;groups in quinoidal compounds is an effective strategy for the synthesis of low&#8208;bandgap small molecules with good stability.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal Free Access to Polysubstituted Pyrimidines via Nitrile Activation and [2+2+2] Cycloaddition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Tf  2  O mediated intermolecular / intramolecular [2+2+2] cycloaddition between alkynes and nitriles has been developed for efficient construction of polysubstituted pyrimidine and bicyclopyrimidines. In presence of Tf  2  O, aza&#8208;allene species in situ generated through nitrile activation and subsequently participated in the [2+2+2] cycloaddition, which was fully supported by deuteration experiments. The reaction had good substrate extensibility with moderate to excellent yield including trimethylsilylalkynes. The utilization as a useful synthetic tool in preparation of the luminescent metal complex was also demonstrated.</dc:description>

         <title>NMR crystallography reveals carbonate induced Al&#8208;ordering in ZnAl layered double hydroxide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) serve a score of applications in catalysis, drug delivery, and environmental remediation. Smarter crystallography, combining X&#8208;ray diffraction and NMR spectroscopy revealed how interplay between carbonate and pH determines the LDH structure and Al ordering in ZnAl LDH. Carbonate intercalated ZnAl LDHs were synthesized at different pH (pH 8.5, pH 10.0, pH 12.5) with a Zn/Al ratio of 2, without subsequent hydrothermal treatment to avoid extensive recrystallisation. In ideal configuration, all Al cations should be part of the LDH and be coordinated with 6 Zn atoms, but NMR revealed two different Al local environments were present in all samples in a ratio dependent on synthesis pH. NMR&#8208;crystallography, integrating NMR spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray diffraction, succeeded to identify them as Al residing in the highly ordered crystalline phase, next to Al in disordered material. With increasing synthesis pH, crystallinity increased and the side&#8208;phase fraction decreased. Using  1  H&#8208;  13  C,&#160;  13  C&#8208;  27  Al HETCOR NMR in combination with  27  Al MQMAS,  27  Al&#8208;DQ&#8208;SQ measurements and Rietveld refinement on high&#8208;resolution PXRD data, the extreme anion exchange selectivity of these LDHs for CO  3  2&#8208;  over HCO  3  &#8208;  was linked to strict Al and CO  3  2&#8208;  ordering in the crystalline LDH. Even upon equilibration of the LDH in pure NaHCO  3  solutions, only CO  3  2&#8208;  was adsorbed by the LDH. This reveals the structure directing role of bivalent cations such as CO  3  2&#8208;  during crystallization of [M  2+4  M3+2  (OH)2  ]2+  [A  2&#8211;  ]  1  &#8729;yH  2  O LDH phases.</dc:description>

         <title>Bipyridine&#8208;modified DNA Three&#8208;way Junctions with Amide&#8208;Linkers: Metal&#8208;dependent Structure Induction and Self&#8208;sorting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>DNA three&#8208;way junction (3WJ) structures are essential building blocks for the construction of DNA nanoarchitectures. We have synthesized a bipyridine (bpy)&#8208;modified DNA 3WJ using a newly designed bpy&#8208;modified nucleoside,  U  bpy  &#8208;3  , in which a bpy ligand is tethered via a stable amide&#8208;linker. The thermal stability of the bpy&#8208;modified 3WJ was greatly enhanced by the formation of an interstrand Ni  II  (bpy)  3  complex at the junction core (&#916;  T  m  = +17.7 &#176;C). Although the stereochemistry of the modification site differs from that of the previously reported bpy&#8208;modified nucleoside  U  bpy  &#8208;2  , the degree of the Ni  II  &#8208;mediated stabilization observed with  U  bpy  &#8208;3  was comparable to that of  U  bpy  &#8208;2  . The structure induction of the 3WJs and the duplexes was carried out by the addition or removal of Ni  II  ions. Furthermore, Ni  II  &#8208;mediated self&#8208;sorting of 3WJs was performed using the bpy&#8208;modified strands and their unmodified counterparts. Both transformations were driven by the formation of Ni  II  (bpy)  3  complex. The structural induction and self&#8208;sorting of bpy&#8208;modified 3WJs are expected to have many potential applications in the development of metal&#8208;responsive DNA materials.</dc:description>

         <title>Molecular Recognition of Natural and Non&#8208;Natural Substrates by Cellodextrin Phosphorylase from Ruminiclostridium Thermocellum Investigated by NMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Understanding the molecular basis of the broad specificity of cellodextrin phosphorylase (CDP) from Ruminiclostridium thermocellum, can facilitate the generation of highly diverse CDP&#8208;catalysed cellulose&#8208;based structures. Here, NMR spectroscopy and molecular modelling allowed to understand how CDP is able to bind non&#8208;natural chemically modified donors and acceptors with different binding epitopes, revealing the structural requirements for CDP ligands, which will enable exploitation of CDP to produce novel materials of high biotechnological interest.







Abstract
&#946;&#8208;1&#8594;4&#8208;Glucan polysaccharides like cellulose, derivatives and analogues, are attracting attention due to their unique physicochemical properties, as ideal candidates for many different applications in biotechnology. Access to these polysaccharides with a high level of purity at scale is still challenging, and eco&#8208;friendly alternatives by using enzymes in&#8197;vitro are highly desirable. One prominent candidate enzyme is cellodextrin phosphorylase (CDP) from Ruminiclostridium thermocellum, which is able to yield cellulose oligomers from short cellodextrins and &#945;&#8208;d&#8208;glucose 1&#8208;phosphate (Glc&#8208;1&#8208;P) as substrates. Remarkably, its broad specificity towards donors and acceptors allows the generation of highly diverse cellulose&#8208;based structures to produce novel materials. However, to fully exploit this CDP broad specificity, a detailed understanding of the molecular recognition of substrates by this enzyme in solution is needed. Herein, we provide a detailed investigation of the molecular recognition of ligands by CDP in solution by saturation transfer difference (STD) NMR spectroscopy, tr&#8208;NOESY and protein&#8208;ligand docking. Our results, discussed in the context of previous reaction kinetics data in the literature, allow a better understanding of the structural basis of the broad binding specificity of this biotechnologically relevant enzyme.

         <title>Asymmetric Synthesis of Indoline from Achiral Phthalimide Involving Crystallization&#8208;Induced Deracemization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Asymmetric synthesis was performed by combining a photochemical reaction of an achiral substrate followed by crystallization&#8208;induced deracemization. A fused indoline produced by the photochemical intramolecular &#948;&#8208;hydrogen abstraction and cyclization reaction of N&#8208;(5&#8208;chloro&#8208;2&#8208;methylphenyl)phthalimide crystallized as a racemic conglomerate, and crystallization&#8208;induced deracemization by Viedma ripening was performed with an excellent enantioselectivity of 99&#8201;% ee. This is the first example of asymmetric expression and amplification by a photochemical hydrogen abstraction reaction and crystallization&#8208;induced deracemization.







Abstract
Asymmetric synthesis was performed by combining the photochemical reaction of an achiral substrate followed by crystallization&#8208;induced deracemization. The results indicated that a fused indoline produced by photochemical intramolecular &#948;&#8208;hydrogen abstraction and cyclization of N&#8208;(5&#8208;chloro&#8208;2&#8208;methylphenyl)phthalimide crystallized as a racemic conglomerate. Since this substrate has an aminal skeleton, racemization involving a ring&#8208;opening and ring&#8208;closing equilibrium process occurred under suitable conditions. Efficient racemization was observed in acetone containing a catalytic base, 1,8&#8208;diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec&#8208;7&#8208;ene (DBU). Crystallization&#8208;induced dynamic deracemization by Viedma ripening from racemic indoline was performed with an excellent enantioselectivity of 99&#8201;% ee. Furthermore, one&#8208;pot asymmetric synthesis of the indoline was achieved by the photochemical reaction of achiral phthalimide followed by continuous attrition&#8208;enhanced deracemization converging to 99&#8201;% ee of enantiomeric crystals. This is the first example of asymmetric expression and amplification by photochemical hydrogen abstraction and crystallization&#8208;induced dynamic deracemization.

         <title>Switchable Chemoselectivity of Reactive Intermediates Formation and Their Direct Use in A Flow Microreactor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Switching of chemoselectivity for organolithium reactions between halogen&#8208;lithium exchange reaction with carbolithiation was achieved in a flow microreactor.







Abstract
A chemoselectivity switchable microflow reaction was developed to generate reactive and unstable intermediates. The switchable chemoselectivity of this reaction enables a selection for one of two different intermediates, an aryllithium or a benzyl lithium, at will from the same starting material. Starting from bromo&#8208;substituted styrenes, the aryllithium intermediates were converted to the substituted styrenes, whereas the benzyl lithium intermediates were engaged in an anionic polymerization. These chemoselectivity&#8208;switchable reactions can be integrated to produce polymers that cannot be formed during typical polymerization reactions.

         <title>Polycationic Redox&#8208;Active Cyclophanes with Integrated Electron&#8208;Rich Diboron Units</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclophanes and macrocyclic cages are of interest for a variety of applications. In this work, it is shown that the integration of electron rich diboron units into polycationic cyclophanes and macrocyclic cages with bi&#8208; and trispyridine electron&#8208;acceptor units leads to novel donor&#8208;acceptor compounds with intriguing optical and redox properties.







Abstract
Cationic cyclophanes are widely used in a variety of applications in supramolecular chemistry and materials science. In this work the authors systematically study the integration of electron&#8208;rich diboron units with BII atoms into polycationic cyclophanes with viologen&#8208;like electron&#8208;acceptor units. They also report a first hexacationic cage&#8208;compound in which three diboron units connect two tris(4&#8208;pyridyl)triazine acceptor units. Moreover, di&#8208; and tetracationic open&#8208;structure compounds, in which one diboron unit connects two bispyridyl groups, were synthesized and the properties compared to those of the corresponding closed structures (cyclophanes). The combination of diboron electron&#8208;donor units and bi&#8208; or oligopyridyl electron&#8208;acceptor units leads to intriguing optical and redox properties.

         <title>GPhos Ligand Enables Production of Chiral N&#8208;Arylamines in a Telescoped Transaminase&#8208;Buchwald&#8208;Hartwig Amination Cascade in the Presence of Excess Amine Donor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral N&#8208;arylamines were accessed by combining transaminases with the Buchwald&#8208;Hartwig amination (BHA), combining the high enantioselectivity of the former with the efficient arylation ability of palladium. The ligand GPhos was key for the successful arylation of &#945;&#8208;secondary amines in a biphasic water&#8208;toluene system in the presence of excess alanine, achieving overall conversions of up to 89&#8201;% with &gt;99.5&#8201;% ee. No coupling to alanine was observed.







Abstract
The combination of biocatalysis and chemocatalysis can be more powerful than either technique alone. However, combining the two is challenging due to typically very different reaction conditions. Herein, chiral N&#8208;aryl amines, key features of many active pharmaceutical ingredients, are accessed in excellent enantioselectivity (typically&gt;99.5&#8201;% ee) by combining transaminases with the Buchwald&#8208;Hartwig amination. By employing a bi&#8208;phasic buffer&#8208;toluene system as well as the ligand GPhos, the telescoped cascade proceeded with up to 89&#8201;% overall conversion in the presence of excess alanine. No coupling to alanine was observed.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The combination of biocatalysis and chemocatalysis can be more powerful than either technique alone. However, combining the two is challenging due to typically very different reaction conditions. Herein, chiral &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-aryl amines, key features of many active pharmaceutical ingredients, are accessed in excellent enantioselectivity (typically&amp;gt;99.5&#8201;% &lt;i&gt;ee&lt;/i&gt;) by combining transaminases with the Buchwald-Hartwig amination. By employing a bi-phasic buffer-toluene system as well as the ligand GPhos, the telescoped cascade proceeded with up to 89&#8201;% overall conversion in the presence of excess alanine. No coupling to alanine was observed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Computational Study of Bridge Splitting, Aryl Halide Oxidative Addition to PtII, and Reductive Elimination from PtIV: Route to Pincer&#8208;PtII Reagents with Chemical and Biological Applications</title>

The precise path to pincers: Density functional theory studies of the bridge splitting of [PtIIR2(SEt2)]2 (R=Me, 4&#8208;tolyl) by bromoarenes containing nitrogen donor groups, and subsequent intramolecular coordination&#8208;assisted oxidative addition, elucidate for R=4&#8208;tolyl the mechanism for formation of mer&#8208;PtII(N,C,N)Br pincers via platinum(IV) intermediates. The pincers are known for their applications in fundamental and applied chemistry.







Abstract
Density functional theory computation indicates that bridge splitting of [PtIIR2(&#956;&#8208;SEt2)]2 proceeds by partial dissociation to form R2Pta(&#956;&#8208;SEt2)PtbR2(SEt2), followed by coordination of N&#8208;donor bromoarenes (L&#8208;Br) at Pta leading to release of PtbR2(SEt2), which reacts with a second molecule of L&#8208;Br, providing two molecules of PtR2(SEt2)(L&#8208;Br&#8208;N). For R=4&#8208;tolyl (Tol), L&#8208;Br=2,6&#8208;(pzCH2)2C6H3Br (pz=pyrazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl) and 2,6&#8208;(Me2NCH2)2C6H3Br, subsequent oxidative addition assisted by intramolecular N&#8208;donor coordination via PtIITol2(L&#8208;N,Br) and reductive elimination from PtIV intermediates gives mer&#8208;PtII(L&#8208;N,C,N)Br and Tol2. The strong &#963;&#8208;donor influence of Tol groups results in subtle differences in oxidative addition mechanisms when compared with related aryl halide oxidative addition to palladium(II) centres. For R=Me and L&#8208;Br=2,6&#8208;(pzCH2)2C6H3Br, a stable PtIV product, fac&#8208;PtIVMe2{2,6&#8208;(pzCH2)2C6H3&#8208;N,C,N)Br is predicted, as reported experimentally, acting as a model for undetected and unstable PtIVTol2{L&#8208;N,C,N}Br undergoing facile Tol2 reductive elimination. The mechanisms reported herein enable the synthesis of PtII pincer reagents with applications in materials and bio&#8208;organometallic chemistry.

         <title>Remote Radical Desaturation of Unactivated C&#8722;H Bonds in Amides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A copper&#8208;catalyzed/silver&#8208;promoted desaturation method is described which allows the regioselective conversion of various unactivated N&#8208;alkylamides at remote sites to the corresponding N&#8208;alkenylamides via N&#8208;centred radical mediated 1,5 hydrogen atom transfer, metal&#8208;mediated oxidation and deprotonation. The transformation shows good functional group tolerance and can be used for late&#8208;stage desaturation of drug derivatives and biologically more relevant compounds.







Abstract
Desaturation of inert aliphatic C&#8722;H bonds in alkanes to form the corresponding alkenes is challenging. In this communication, a new and practical strategy for remote site&#8208;selective desaturation of amides via radical chemistry is reported. The readily installed N&#8208;allylsulfonylamide moiety serves as an N radical precursor. Intramolecular 1,5&#8208;hydrogen atom transfer from an inert C&#8722;H bond to the N&#8208;radical generates a translocated C&#8208;radical which is subsequently oxidized and deprotonated to give the corresponding alkene. The commercially available methanesulfonyl chloride is used as reagent and a Cu/Ag&#8208;couple as oxidant. The remote desaturation is realized on different types of unactivated sp3&#8208;C&#8722;H bonds. The potential synthetic utility of this method is further demonstrated by the dehydrogenation of natural product derivatives and drugs.

         <title>Cross&#8208;Coupling through Ag(I)/Ag(III) Redox Manifold</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Teaching silver to do the trick. Most crucial steps towards oxidative trifluoromethylation via AgI/AgIII redox shuttles are herein deciphered. This innovative cross&#8208;coupling, analogous to the CEL coupling popularized by copper, involves: i) easy AgI/AgIII 2e&#8722; oxidation; ii) phen ligation to AgIII; iii) boron&#8208;to&#8208;AgIII aryl transfer; and iv) benzotrifluoride production from aryl&#8208;AgIII intermediates. Now, AgIIICF3 chemistry is safe and reachable from AgF, KF, CF3TMS and air.







Abstract
In ample variety of transformations, the presence of silver as an additive or co&#8208;catalyst is believed to be innocuous for the efficiency of the operating metal catalyst. Even though Ag additives are required often as coupling partners, oxidants or halide scavengers, its role as a catalytically competent species is widely neglected in cross&#8208;coupling reactions. Most likely, this is due to the erroneously assumed incapacity of Ag to undergo 2e&#8722; redox steps. Definite proof is herein provided for the required elementary steps to accomplish the oxidative trifluoromethylation of arenes through AgI/AgIII redox catalysis (i.&#8201;e. CEL coupling), namely: i) easy AgI/AgIII 2e&#8722; oxidation mediated by air; ii) bpy/phen ligation to AgIII; iii) boron&#8208;to&#8208;AgIII aryl transfer; and iv) ulterior reductive elimination of benzotrifluorides from an [aryl&#8208;AgIII&#8208;CF3] fragment. More precisely, an ultimate entry and full characterization of organosilver(III) compounds [K]+[AgIII(CF3)4]&#8722; (K&#8208;1), [(bpy)AgIII(CF3)3] (2) and [(phen)AgIII(CF3)3] (3), is described. The utility of 3 in cross&#8208;coupling has been showcased unambiguously, and a large variety of arylboron compounds was trifluoromethylated via [AgIII(aryl)(CF3)3]&#8722; intermediates. This work breaks with old stereotypes and misconceptions regarding the inability of Ag to undergo cross&#8208;coupling by itself.

         <title>Regulating Lithium Plating and Stripping by Using Vertically Aligned Graphene/CNT Channels Decorated with ZnO Particles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Li host material that features vertically aligned channels composed of graphene, carbon nanotubes (CNTs), and decorated ZnO particles (designated ZnO@G&#8208;CNT&#8208;C) has been prepared by using an ice&#8208;template method through oriented freezing. The Li host material not only suppresses the formation of Li dendrites but also reduces the overpotential of Li nucleation. The usability of ZnO@G&#8208;CNT&#8208;C as Li host was confirmed in full cells with a LiFePO4 cathode.







Abstract
Lithium (Li) metal is regarded as the ultimate anode material for use in Li batteries due to its high theoretical capacity (3860&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1). However, the Li dendrites that are generated during iterative Li plating/stripping cycles cause poor cycling stability and even present safety risks, and thus severely handicap the commercial utility of Li metal anodes. Herein, we describe a graphene and carbon nanotube (CNT)&#8208;based Li host material that features vertically aligned channels with attached ZnO particles (designated ZnO@G&#8208;CNT&#8208;C) and show that the material effectively regulates Li plating and stripping. ZnO@G&#8208;CNT&#8208;C is prepared from an aqueous suspension of Zn(OAc)2, CNTs, and graphene oxide by using ice to template channel growth. ZnO@G&#8208;CNT&#8208;C was found to be mechanically robust and capable of guiding Li deposition on the inner walls of the channels without the formation of Li dendrites. When used as an electrode, the material exhibits relatively low polarization for Li plating, fast Li&#8208;ion diffusion, and high Coulombic efficiency, even over hundreds of Li plating/stripping cycles. Moreover, full cells prepared with ZnO@G&#8208;CNT&#8208;C as Li host and LiFePO4 as cathode exhibit outstanding performance in terms of specific capacity (155.9&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.5&#8197;C), rate performance (91.8&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 4&#8197;C), cycling stability (109.4&#8197;mA&#8201;h&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 0.5&#8197;C after 800 cycles). The methodology described can be readily adapted to enable the use of carbon&#8208;based electrodes with well&#8208;defined channels in a wide range of contemporary applications that pertain to energy storage and delivery.

Stop gap: Donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor organic semiconductors consisting of a highly electron&#8208;deficient naphtho[1,2&#8208;b:5,6&#8208;b&#8242;]dithiophene&#8208;2,7&#8208;dione quinoidal acceptor and oligothiophene donors show very small optical energy gaps of down to 0.72&#8197;eV in the solid state, due to an efficient intramolecular interaction between the quinoidal acceptor and the aromatic donors that significantly enhances the backbone resonance and reduces the bond length alternation.







Abstract
Organic semiconductors with very small optical energy gaps have attracted a lot of attention for near&#8208;infrared&#8208;active optoelectronic applications. Herein, we present a series of donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor (D&#8722;A&#8722;D) organic semiconductors consisting of a highly electron&#8208;deficient naphtho[1,2&#8208;b:5,6&#8208;b&#8242;]dithiophene&#8208;2,7&#8208;dione quinoidal acceptor and oligothiophene donors that show very small optical energy gaps of down to 0.72&#8197;eV in the solid state. Investigation of the physicochemical properties of the D&#8722;A&#8722;D molecules as well as theoretical calculations of their electronic structures revealed an efficient intramolecular interaction between the quinoidal acceptor and the aromatic oligothiophene donors in the D&#8722;A&#8722;D molecules; this significantly enhances the backbone resonance and thus reduces the bond length alternation along the &#960;&#8208;conjugated backbones. Despite the very small optical energy gaps, the D&#8722;A&#8722;D molecules have low&#8208;lying frontier orbital energy levels that give rise to air&#8208;stable ambipolar carrier transport properties with hole and electron mobilities of up to 0.026 and 0.043&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, respectively, in field&#8208;effect transistors.

         <title>Facile Synthesis of Azahelicenes and Diaza[8]circulenes through the Intramolecular Scholl Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intramolecular Scholl reaction of carbazole derivatives afforded highly strained azahelicenes and azahepta[8]circulene, which was transformed into dibenzodiaza[8]circulenes. The diaza[8]circulene structure was characterized for the first time by X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis, which revealed the saddle&#8208;shaped &#960;&#8208;conjugated polyaromatics.







Abstract
Carbazole&#8208;based aza[7]helicenes and hetero[9]helicenes were successfully obtained via the intramolecular Scholl reaction of 3,6&#8208;bis(biphenyl&#8208;2&#8208;yl)carbazole congeners, while the reaction of 3,6&#8208;bis(naphthylphenyl)&#8208;appended carbazole gave a triple helicene via an unexpected simultaneous double aryl rearrangement. DFT calculations suggested that the rearrangement proceeded via an arenium cation intermediate. In addition, the reaction of methoxy&#8208;appended substrate gave an azahepta[8]circulene via the concurrent C&#8722;C bond formation. These helical dyes showed circularly polarized luminescence. The azahepta[8]circulene was further transformed into deeply saddle&#8208;distorted dibenzodiaza[8]circulenes as the first example of its solution&#8208;based synthesis and unambiguous structural determination.

         <title>A Benzodiphosphaborolediide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 1,3&#8208;diphosphaborolediide ligand motif, a hitherto missing member of the &#8220;hetero&#8208;Cp&#8220; family, is obtained within an indenyl scaffold as its dilithium salt, as both thf and TMEDA solvates. This dianionic ligand exhibits aromaticity commensurate with its hybrid phospholide&#8208;borolediide nature, as is determined by NICS calculations and observed experimentally for both lithium salts. Additionally, coordination to zero&#8208;valent molybdenum is achieved, demonstrating a capacity to to coordinate readily as a &#960;&#8208; and bridging &#960;&#8208;,&#963;&#8208;type ligand.







Abstract
The first example of a diphosphaborolediide, the benzo&#8208;fused [C6H4P2BPh]2&#8722; (12&#8722;), is prepared from ortho&#8208;bis(phosphino)benzene (C6H4{PH2}) and dichlorophenylborane, via a sequential lithiation approach. The dilithio&#8208;salt can be obtained as an oligomeric THF solvate or discrete TMEDA adduct, both of which are fully characterized, including by X&#8208;ray diffraction. Alongside NICS calculations, data strongly suggest some aromaticity within 12&#8722;, which is further supported by preliminary coordination studies that demonstrate &#951;5&#8208;coordination to a zerovalent molybdenum center, as observed crystallographically for the oligomeric [{Mo(CO)3(&#951;5&#8208;1)}{&#956;&#8208;&#951;1&#8208;Mo(CO)3(TMEDA)}2]&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;[&#956;&#8208;Li(THF)][&#956;&#8208;Li(TMEDA)].

         <title>Accessing Extended Fused Isoindolinones Via Sequential Anionic Intramolecular Cyclizations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modelling was used to predict how stereoelectronic effects could be used for regio&#8208;control of 6&#8208;exo versus 7&#8208;endo nucleophilic cyclizations. This stereoelectronic effect was then used synthetically to provide access to fully conjugated and &#960;&#8208;extended isoindolinones.







Abstract
Sequential anionic intramolecular cyclizations and modelling were used for the first time to access unusual fused heterocyclic frameworks in excellent yields. 5&#8208;Exo&#8208;dig cyclizations yielded isoindolinone motifs and a subsequent 6&#8208;exo&#8208; and 7&#8208;endo&#8208;dig cyclization was directed to provide either fused isoquinoline or azepine frameworks. Regioselectivities were controlled by exploiting stereoelectronic effects via nC&#8722;&#8594;&#960;*(Ph) interactions, and modelling studies provided reaction scope.

         <title>Synthesis of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons Decorated by Fluorinated Carbon Acids/Carbanions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reaction of biphenyl&#8208;alkynes with in&#8197;situ generated Tf2C=CH2 followed by neutralization gave polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) decorated by a highly stabilized carbanionic functionality. Thus obtained PAHs showed improved solubility in both aqueous and organic solvents.







Abstract
The carboarylation reaction of biphenyl&#8208;alkynes was successfully triggered by electrophilic attack of 1,1&#8208;bis(triflyl)ethylene on the alkyne moiety to give polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) decorated by superacidic carbon acid functionality. Neutralisation of thus obtained acids with NaHCO3 yielded the corresponding sodium salts, which showed improved solubility in both aqueous and organic solvents.

         <title>Porphyrins and Polyoxometalate Scaffolds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Winning combo: Porphyrins and polyoxometalates can be combined into useful architectures for energy conversion, this minireview highlights the most successful strategies developed to date.







Abstract
Polyoxometalates (POMs) can act as unique reservoirs for multiple electron transfers. As POMs display only weak absorption in the visible spectrum, they can be associated with chromophores such as porphyrins and porphyrin antennae. In this Minireview, the research dedicated to the combination of porphyrins and polyoxometalates is put in context and the state of the art identifying the challenges addressed in the optimization of hybrid materials for applications is detailed.

         <title>Reversible pH&#8208;Controlled Catenation of a Benzobisimidazole&#8208;Based Tetranuclear Rectangle</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pH&#8208;sensitive metalla&#8208;rectangle constructed from the benzobisimidazole (BBI) framework dimerizes in solution to form a catenane. It can be dissociated thanks to three different pathways: dilution, addition of pyrene to form a 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 host&#8208;guest complex and selective protonation of the bisimidazole rings. The latter process is reversible through addition of a base and occurs without any sign of disassembling.







Abstract
The development of methodologies to control on demand and reversibly supramolecular transformations from self&#8208;assembled metalla&#8208;structures requires the rational design of architectures able to answer to an applied stimulus. While solvent or concentration changes, light exposure or addition of a chemical have been largely explored to provide these transformations, the case of pH sensitive materials is less described. Herein, we report the first example of a pH&#8208;triggered dissociation of a coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembled interlocked molecular link. It incorporates a pH sensitive benzobisimidazole&#8208;based ligand that can be selectively protonated on its bisimidazole moieties. This generates intermolecular electrostatic repulsions that reduces drastically the stability of the interlocked structure, leading to its dissociation without any sign of protonation of the pyridine moieties involved in the coordination bonds. Importantly, the dissociation process is reversible through addition of a base.

         <title>High Fidelity Enzyme&#8208;Free Primer Extension with an Ethynylpyridone Thymidine Analog</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strongly binding analog: When thymidine is replaced with ethynylmethylpyridone, enzyme&#8208;free genetic copying occurs faster and with higher fidelity.







Abstract
High fidelity base pairing is important for the transmission of genetic information. Weak base pairs can lower fidelity, complicating sequencing, amplification and replication of DNA. Thymidine 5&#8242;&#8208;monophosphate (TMP) is the most weakly pairing nucleotide among the canonical deoxynucleotides, causing high errors rates in enzyme&#8208;free primer extension. Here we report the synthesis of an ethynylpyridone C&#8208;nucleoside analog of 3&#8242;&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;dideoxythymidine monophosphate and its incorporation in a growing strand by enzyme&#8208;free primer extension. The ethynylpyridone C&#8208;nucleotide accelerates extension more than five&#8208;fold, reduces misincorporation and readily displaces TMP in competition experiments. The results bode well for the use of the C&#8208;nucleoside as replacements for thymidine in practical applications.

         <title>Monocyclometalated (C^N) Gold(III) Metallacycles: Tunable Emission and Singlet Oxygen (1O2) Generation Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of monocyclometalated gold(III) diacetylide metallacycles has been synthesized and characterized. Photophysical investigations of these complexes revealed strong phosphorescence with very long excited&#8208;state lifetimes. We demonstrate the efficient singlet&#8208;oxygen&#8208;generation properties of these metallacycles through their ability to sensitize singlet oxygen. The complexes&#8242; varying ability to generate singlet oxygen opens avenues for their potential use in catalysis and biomedical applications. More information can be found in the Full Paper by K.&#8197;Venkatesan et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202102331).

         <title>Bilayer rGO&#8208;based Photothermal Evaporator for Efficient Solar&#8208;Driven Water Purification</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Interfacial evaporation has emerged as a promising approach to produce freshwater. However, an urgent concern is that, due to the illegal discharge of industrial wastewater, most water bodies are polluted by trace volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which are easily volatilized and enriched in the collected water during the interfacial evaporation process. Herein, a bilayer photothermal evaporator was reasonably designed for contaminated water purification. The bottom hydrophilic rGO&#8208;sodium alginate (SA) sheets purposefully disintegrate water transport channels, thus quickly removing VOCs through physical adsorption. The rGO&#8208;SA&#8208;TiO2 upper layer sufficiently absorbs incident light and therefore persistently generates reactive oxidizing species to degrade upward VOCs. Notably, the oriented microchannels inside the evaporator allow sustained light reflections to improve the utilization of solar energy. The evaporation rate can reach 1.63 kg m&#8208;2 h&#8208;1 with a considerably high VOC removal efficiency of up to 96%. Such an integrated bilayer evaporator provides an effective strategy to obtain clean water via solar distillation.</dc:description>

         <title>Nanoparticles for Triple Drug Release for Combined Chemo&#8208; and Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pH&#8208;responsive drug delivery system based on mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSN) has been prepared for the delivery of three drugs with different modes of action (phthalocyanine (Pc) camptothecin (CPT) and doxorubicin (DOX)). The pores of the MSN were loaded with a photoactive conjugate formed from Pc and CPT joined by a glutathione&#8208;sensitive linker. DOX was covalently bound to the outer surface of the MSN through a dihydrazone poly(ethylene glycol) linker. Uptake studies demonstrated proper endocytosis of the system and subsequent delivery of the three drugs into the cytoplasm and nucleus. The synergistic effect of the drugs and Pc upon light irradiation was also assessed in vitro. More information can be found in the Full Paper by T. Torres, D.&#8197;K.&#8197;P. Ng, D. S&#225;nchez&#8208;Garc&#237;a et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202101842).

         <title>Segregated Protein&#8211;Cucurbit[7]uril Crystalline Architectures via Modulatory Peptide Tectons</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
From the drawing board to the product, crystalline protein assemblies with alternating compact and porous layers were obtained. Trimeric protein RSL, with pseudo&#8208;C6 symmetry, forms honeycomb assemblies in the presence of cucurbit[7]uril. A coiled&#8208;coil fused to the N&#8197;terminus of RSL re&#8208;forms the honeycomb assembly but with poorly packed spacer layers. Such bio&#8208;supramolecular tectonics could serve the development of biomaterials. More information can be found in the Full Paper by P.&#8197;B. Crowley et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202103025).

         <title>Lewis Superacidic Tellurenyl Cation&#8208;Induced Electrophilic Activation of an Inert Carborane</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In a metastable N&#8208;coordinated Lewis superacidic tellurenyl cation&#8211;carborane ion pair, the Te atom is trying to steal the H atom with help of a N atom. However, although at first glance the N atom is helping, he is actually planning to steal the asset for himself. The Town Musicians came to scare off the robbers, but they arrived too late, and thus nothing can stop nitrogen's plan. The broken window opens full insight into the electrophilic activation mechanism of the carborane moiety, which has been poorly understood so far. Elemental Te is watching the whole show and wondering how this is even possible; but was it the Te atom that broke the window? More information can be found in the Communication by M. Hejda, S. Ketkov, S. Mebs, J. Beckmann, et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202103181).

         <title>A Pyrene&#8208;Modified Serinol Nucleic Acid Nanostructure Converts the Chirality of Threoninol Nucleic Acids into Circularly Polarized Luminescence Signals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Creating chiroptical signals: A circularly polarized luminescent (CPL) probe composed of serinol nucleic acids forms a one&#8208;dimensional nanostructure and expresses no CPL signals. However, helicity is induced when a chiral nucleic acid is added. As a result, the probe can switch CPL signals depending on the chirality of added nucleic acids. These findings will provide a new platform to convert the chiral information of biomolecules into chiroptical signals. More information can be found in the Communication by H. Kashida, H. Asanuma et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202102333).

         <title>Failure&#8208;experiment&#8208;supported optimization of poorly reproducible synthetic conditions for novel lanthanide metal&#8208;organic frameworks with two&#8208;dimensional secondary building units</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Novel metal&#8211;organic frameworks containing lanthanide double&#8208;layer&#8208;based secondary building units (KGF&#8208;3) were synthesized using machine learning (ML). Isolating pure KGF&#8208;3 was challenging, and the synthesis was not reproducible because impurity phases were frequently obtained under the same synthetic conditions. Thus, dominant factors for the synthesis of KGF&#8208;3 were identified, and its synthetic conditions were optimized using two ML techniques. Cluster analysis was used to classify the obtained powder X&#8208;ray diffractometry patterns of the products and thus automatically determine whether the experiments were successful. Decision tree analysis was used to visualize the experimental results, after extracting factors that mainly affected the synthetic reproducibility. Water adsorption isotherms revealed that KGF&#8208;3 possesses unique hydrophilic pores. Impedance measurements demonstrated good proton conductivities (  &#963;  = 5.2 &#215; 10  &#8722;4  S cm  &#8722;1  for KGF&#8208;3(Y)) at a high temperature (363 K) and relative humidity of 95% RH.</dc:description>

Impedance measurements demonstrated good proton conductivities (  &#963;  = 5.2 &#215; 10  &#8722;4  S cm  &#8722;1  for KGF-3(Y)) at a high temperature (363 K) and relative humidity of 95% RH.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hierarchical Self&#8208;Assembly of Amphiphilic &#946;&#8208;C&#8208;Glycosylbarbiturates into Multiresponsive Alginate&#8208;Like Supramolecular Hydrogel Fibers and Vesicle Hydrogel</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Ordered molecular self&#8208;assembly of glycoamphiphiles has been regarded as an attractive, practical and bottom&#8208;up approach to obtain stable, structurally well&#8208;defined, and functional mimics of natural polysaccharides. This study describes a versatile and rational design of carbohydrate&#8208;based hydrogelators through  N  ,  N&#8217;  &#8208;substituted barbituric acid&#8208;mediated Knoevenagel condensation onto unprotected carbohydrates in water. Amphiphilic  N  &#8208;substituted &#946;&#8208;  C  &#8208;maltosylbarbiturates self&#8208;assembled into pH&#8208; and calcium&#8208;triggered alginate&#8208;like supramolecular hydrogel fibers with a multistimuli responsiveness to temperature, pH and competitive metal chelating agent. In addition, amphiphilic  N  ,  N&#8217;  &#8208;disubstituted &#946;&#8208;  C  &#8208;maltosylbarbiturates formed vesicle gels in pure water that were scarcely observed for glyco&#8208;hydrogelators. Finally, barbituric acid worked as a multitasking group allowing chemoselective ligation onto reducing&#8208;end carbohydrates, structural diversity, stimuli&#8208;sensitiveness, and supramolecular interactions by hydrogen bonding.</dc:description>

         <title>Pincer&#8208;supported gallium complexes for the catalytic hydroboration of aldehydes, ketones and carbon dioxide</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Gallium hydrides stabilised by primary and secondary amines are scarce due to their propensity to eliminate dihydrogen. Consequently, their reactivity has received limited attention. We describe on the synthesis of two novel gallium hydride complexes HGa(THF)[ON(H)O] and H2Ga[&#956;2&#8208;ON(H)O]Ga[ON(H)O] ([ON(H)O]2&#8722; = N,N&#8208;bis(3,5&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;2&#8208;phenoxy)amine) and explore their reactivity towards aldehydes and ketones. These reactions afford alkoxide&#8208;bridged dimers through 1,2&#8208;hydrogallation reactions. The gallium hydrides can be regenerated through Ga&#8722;O/B&#8722;H metathesis from the reaction of such dimers with pinacol borane (HBpin) or 9&#8208;borabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane (9&#8208;BBN) dimer. These observations allowed us to target the catalytic reduction of carbonyl substrates (aldehydes, ketones and carbon dioxide) with low catalyst loadings at room temperature.</dc:description>

         <title>Bioengineered Protein&#8208;based Adhesives for Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Protein&#8208;based adhesives with their robust adhesion performance and excellent biocompatibility have been extensively explored over years. In particular, the unique adhesion behaviors of mussel and sandcastle worm inspired the development of synthetic adhesives. However, the chemical synthesized adhesives often demonstrate weak underwater adhesion performance and poor biocompatibility/biodegradability, limiting their further biomedical applications. In sharp contrast, genetically engineering endows the protein&#8208;based adhesives the ability to maintain underwater adhesion property as well as biocompatibility/biodegradability. Herein, we outline recent advances in the design and development of protein&#8208;based adhesives by genetic engineering. We summarize the fabrication and adhesion performance of elastin&#8208;like polypeptide&#8208;based adhesives, followed by mussel foot protein (mfp) based adhesives and other sources protein&#8208;based adhesives, such as, spider silk spidroin and suckerin. In addition, the biomedical applications of these bioengineered protein&#8208;based adhesives are presented. Finally, we give a brief summary and perspective on the future development of bioengineered protein&#8208;based adhesives.</dc:description>

         <title>Supramolecular Assembly with Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission Property for Sensing and Detection</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The fabrication of new supramolecular materials for real&#8208;time detection of analytes including ions, organic pollutants, gases, biomolecules, and drugs is of pivotal importance in industrial manufacture, clinical treatment, and environmental remediation. Incorporating fluorescent molecules with distinct aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) effects into supramolecular assemblies has received much attention over the past two decades, owing to the remarkable performance of the AIE&#8208;active supramolecular materials in sensing and detection. In this minireview, we summarize the recent progress of superior detection systems on the basis of supramolecular assemblies accompanied with AIE features. We envision that this minireview will be helpful and timely for relevant researchers to stimulate new thinking for constructing new AIE&#8208;based supramolecular materials with advanced architectures for effective sensing and detection.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal Centers as Nucleophiles: Oxymoron of Halogen Bond&#8208;Involving Crystal Engineering</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>This review highlights recent studies discovering unconventional halogen bonding (HaB) that involves positively charged metal centers. These centers provide their filled d&#8208;orbitals for HaB, and thus behave as nucleophilic components toward the noncovalent interaction. This role of some electron&#8208;rich transition metal centers can be considered an oxymoron in the sense that the metal is, in most cases, formally cationic; consequently, its electron donor function is unexpected. The importance of Ha&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;d&#8208;[M] (Ha = halogen; M is Group 9 (Rh, Ir), 10 (Ni, Pd, Pt), or 11 (Cu, Au)) interactions in crystal engineering is emphasized by showing remarkable examples (reported and uncovered by our processing of the Cambridge Structural Database), where this Ha&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;d&#8208;[M] directional interaction guides the formation of solid supramolecular assemblies of different dimensionalities.</dc:description>

         <title>Investigation of the Organocatalytic Chlorination of 2&#8208;Phenylpropanal</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Results of an examination of the organocatalytic enantioselective &#945;&#8208;chlorination of 2&#8208;phenylpropanal are described. Synthetic investigation including the screening of primary and secondary aminocatalysts, many different reaction conditions, and other &#945;&#8208;branched aldehydes show that especially primary aminocatalysts can catalyze the formation of the &#945;&#8208;chloro branched aldehydes in good yields, but only with moderate enantioselectivities. In order to try to understand the challenge in obtaining high enantioselectivity for the aminocatalytic &#945;&#8208;chlorination of &#945;&#8208;branched aldehydes a series of experimental investigations were performed employing 2&#8208;phenylpropanal as a model system. These investigations have been coupled with computational investigations, which provided important insight into the moderate enantioselectivity of this chlorination reaction. Analysis of the reaction showed, that the lack of control over the selectivity of formation of the (E)&#8208; and (Z)&#8208;enamine intermediate, and the clustering of reaction barriers of possible reaction pathways help to rationalize difficulties in producing high enantioselectivity.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis of Silylated Cyclobutanone and Cyclobutene Derivatives Involving 1,4&#8208;Addition of Zinc&#8208;Based Silicon Nucleophiles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of highly substituted cyclobutenones undergoes 1,4&#8208;addition with zinc&#8208;based nucleophiles with and, for non&#8208;hindered acceptors, without the aid of a copper catalyst. The intermediate metal enolate can be trapped as an enol phosphate and further reacted with Grignard reagents in Kumada cross&#8208;coupling reactions. By this, a range of silylated cyclobutanone and cyclobutene derivatives becomes accessible.







Abstract
A copper&#8208;catalyzed conjugate silylation of various cyclobutenone derivatives with Me2PhSiZnCl&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2LiCl or (Me2PhSi)2Zn&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;xLiCl (x&#8804;4) to generate &#946;&#8208;silylated cyclobutanones is reported. Trapping the intermediate enolate with ClP(O)(OPh)2 affords silylated enol phosphates that can be further engaged in Kumada cross&#8208;coupling reactions to yield silylated cyclobutene derivatives.

         <title>Investigation on Optical and Biological Properties of 2&#8208;(4&#8208;Dimethylaminophenyl)benzothiazole Based Cycloplatinated Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biocompatible photosensitizers: Mono&#8208; and dinuclear cycloplatinated complexes featuring the donor&#8211;acceptor 2&#8208;(4&#8208;dimethylaminophenyl)benzothiazolyl ligand (Me2N&#8208;pbt) and biologically active phosphines show dual emission and photoinduced phosphorescence generating 1O2, with potential applications in theranostics and photodynamic therapy.







Abstract
The optical and biological properties of 2&#8208;(4&#8208;dimethylaminophenyl)benzothiazole cycloplatinated complexes featuring bioactive ligands ([{Pt(Me2N&#8208;pbt)(C6F5)}L] [L=Me2N&#8208;pbtH 1, p&#8208;dpbH (4&#8208;(diphenylphosphino)benzoic acid) 2, o&#8208;dpbH (2&#8208;(diphenylphosphino)benzoic acid) 3), [Pt(Me2N&#8208;pbt)(o&#8208;dpb)] 4, [{Pt(Me2N&#8208;pbt)(C6F5)}2(&#956;&#8208;PRnP)] [PR4P=O(CH2CH2OC(O)C6H4PPh2)2 5, PR12P=O{(CH2CH2O)3C(O)C6H4PPh2}2 6] are presented. Complexes 1&#8211;6 display 1ILCT and metal&#8208;perturbed 3ILCT dual emissions. The ratio between both bands is excitation dependent, accomplishing warm&#8208;white emissions for 2, 5 and 6. The phosphorescent emission is lost in aerated solutions owing to photoinduced electron transfer to 3O2 and the formation of 1O2, as confirmed in complexes 2 and 4. They also exhibit photoinduced phosphorescence enhancement in non&#8208;degassed DMSO due to local oxidation of DMSO by sensitized 1O2, which causes a local degassing. Me2N&#8208;pbtH and the complexes specifically accumulate in the Golgi apparatus, although only 2, 3 and 6 were active against A549 and HeLa cancer cell lines, 6 being highly selective in respect to nontumoral cells. The potential photodynamic property of these complexes was demonstrated with complex 4.

         <title>Mirror Symmetry Breaking and Network Formation in Achiral Polycatenars with Thioether Tail</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spontaneous mirror&#8208;symmetry breaking. Achiral multichain &#960;&#8208;conjugated rod&#8208;like molecules form a series of chiral and achiral liquid crystalline networks as well as mirror symmetry broken liquids. The effect of thioalkyl chains on helical self&#8208;assembly and network formation is discussed.







Abstract
Mirror symmetry breaking in systems composed of achiral molecules is of importance for the design of functional materials for technological applications as well as for the understanding of the mechanisms of spontaneous emergence of chirality. Herein, we report the design and molecular self&#8208;assembly of two series of rod&#8208;like achiral polycatenar molecules derived from a &#960;&#8208;conjugated 5,5&#8217;&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;2,2&#8217;&#8208;bithiophene core with a fork&#8208;like triple alkoxylated end and a variable single alkylthio chain at the other end. In both series of liquid crystalline materials, differing in the chain length at the trialkoxylated end, helical self&#8208;assembly of the &#960;&#8208;conjugated rods in networks occurs, leading to wide temperature ranges (&gt;200&#8197;K) of bicontinuous cubic network phases, in some cases being stable even around ambient temperatures. The achiral bicontinuous cubic Ia
d phase (gyroid) is replaced upon alkylthio chain elongation by a spontaneous mirror symmetry broken bicontinuous cubic phase (I23) and a chiral isotropic liquid phase (Iso1[*]). Further chain elongation results in removing the I23 phase and the re&#8208;appearance of the Ia
d phase with different pitch lengths. In the second series an additional tetragonal phase separates the two cubic phase types.

Their crystal structure, dielectric constant (e) and magnetic properties have been studied. Ligand substituents have a dramatic effect on the structure and magnetic properties of the complexes. With decreasing temperature, the complex (  1  ) shows a gradual spin crossover from the high&#8208;spin state (HS) to the HS:LS intermediate phase, followed by an abrupt transition to the low&#8208;spin state (LS) without changing the crystal symmetry. The complexes  2  and  3  are isostructural, but have fundamentally different properties. Complex  2  demonstrates two structural phase transitions related to sharp spin crossovers from the HS to the HS:LS intermediate phase&#160;at 137 K and from the intermediate phase&#160;to the LS at 87 K, while complex  3  exhibits only one spin transition from the HS to the&#160;HS:LS intermediate phase at 83 K.</dc:description>

         <title>Canopy Catalysts for Alkyne Metathesis: Investigations into a Bimolecular Decomposition Pathway and the Stability of the Podand Cap</title>

Vulnerable? The activity and functional group tolerance of metal alkylidyne canopy catalysts for alkyne metathesis is excellent, but their stability leaves room for optimization. The search for the Achilles&#8242; heels unveiled a new decomposition pathway through bimolecular coupling and led to the discovery of a facile cyclo&#8208;tetramerization reaction by (reversible) opening of the tripodal ligand cage.







Abstract
Molybdenum alkylidyne complexes with a trisilanolate podand ligand framework (&#8220;canopy catalysts&#8221;) are the arguably most selective catalysts for alkyne metathesis known to date. Among them, complex 1&#8201;a endowed with a fence of lateral methyl substituents on the silicon linkers is the most reactive, although fairly high loadings are required in certain applications. It is now shown that this catalyst decomposes readily via a bimolecular pathway that engages the Mo&#8801;CR entities in a stoichiometric triple&#8208;bond metathesis event to furnish RC&#8801;CR and the corresponding dinuclear complex, 8, with a Mo&#8801;Mo core. In addition to the regular analytical techniques, 95Mo NMR was used to confirm this unusual outcome. This rapid degradation mechanism is largely avoided by increasing the size of the peripheral substituents on silicon, without unduly compromising the activity of the resulting complexes. When chemically challenged, however, canopy catalysts can open the apparently somewhat strained tripodal ligand cages; this reorganization leads to the formation of cyclo&#8208;tetrameric arrays composed of four metal alkylidyne units linked together via one silanol arm of the ligand backbone. The analogous tungsten alkylidyne complex 6, endowed with a tripodal tris&#8208;alkoxide (rather than siloxide) ligand framework, is even more susceptible to such a controlled and reversible cyclo&#8208;oligomerization. The structures of the resulting giant macrocyclic ensembles were established by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction.

         <title>Hydrogen and Halogen Bonding in Homogeneous External Electric Fields: Modulating the Bond Strengths</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 56, Page 14042-14050, October 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The sensitivity of single and multiple hydrogen (H) and halogen (X) bonding to external electric fields (EEFs) was analyzed. Computations show that the variations of X&#8208;bonds mainly stem from the covalency change, while generally the steric effect governs the response of H&#8208;bonds to EEFs. X&#8208;bonds are more sensitive to EEFs, with the key difference from H&#8208;bonds lying in the charge transfer interaction. The sensitivity in multiple&#8208;bonding cases can be regulated by the permutations of noncovalent interactions.







Abstract
Recent years have witnessed various fascinating phenomena arising from the interactions of noncovalent bonds with homogeneous external electric fields (EEFs). Here we performed a computational study to interpret the sensitivity of intrinsic bond strengths to EEFs in terms of steric effect and orbital interactions. The block&#8208;localized wavefunction (BLW) method, which combines the advantages of both ab initio valence bond (VB) theory and molecular orbital (MO) theory, and the subsequent energy decomposition (BLW&#8208;ED) approach were adopted. The sensitivity was monitored and analyzed using the induced energy term, which is the variation in each energy component along the EEF strength. Systems with single or multiple hydrogen (H) or halogen (X) bond(s) were also examined. It was found that the X&#8208;bond strength change to EEFs mainly stems from the covalency change, while generally the steric effect rules the response of H&#8208;bonds to EEFs. Furthermore, X&#8208;bonds are more sensitive to EEFs, with the key difference between H&#8208; and X&#8208;bonds lying in the charge transfer interaction. Since phenylboronic acid has been experimentally used as a smart linker in EEFs, switchable sensitivity was scrutinized with the example of the phenylboronic acid dimer, which exhibits two conformations with either antiparallel or parallel H&#8208;bonds, thereby, opposite or consistent responses to EEFs. Among the studied systems, the quadruple X&#8208;bonds in molecular capsules exhibit remarkable sensitivity, with its interaction energy increased by &#8722;95.2&#8197;kJ&#8201;mol&#8722;1 at the EEF strength 0.005&#8197;a.u.

         <title>Peptide Cyclization Mediated by Metal&#8208;Free S&#8208;Arylation: S&#8208;Protected Cysteine Sulfoxide as an Umpolung of the Cysteine Nucleophile</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 56, Page 14092-14099, October 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Acid&#8208;mediated activation of an S&#8208;protected cysteine sulfoxide allows for the cyclization of peptides through metal&#8208;free C&#8722;H sulfenylation of arenes. The less electrophilic S&#8208;p&#8208;methoxybenzyl cysteine sulfoxide serves as an acid&#8208;activated umpolung of nucleophilic cysteine in the presence of guanidine hydrochloride under acidic conditions. It is useful for S&#8208;arylation&#8208;mediated peptide cyclization, which results in the synthesis of an Amatoxin derivative and stapled peptide possessing a tryptathionine structure.







Abstract
Covalent linking of side chains provides a method to produce cyclic or stapled peptides that are important in developing peptide&#8208;based drugs. A variety of crosslinking formats contribute to fixing the active conformer and prolonging its biological activity under physiological conditions. One format uses the cysteine thiol to participate in crosslinking through nucleophilic thiolate anions or thiyl radicals to form thioether and disulfide bonds. Removal of the S&#8208;protection from an S&#8208;protected Cys derivative generates the thiol, which functions as a nucleophile. S&#8208;Oxidation of a protected Cys allows the formation of a sulfoxide that operates as an umpolung electrophile. Herein, the applicability of S&#8208;p&#8208;methoxybenzyl Cys sulfoxide (Cys(MBzl)(O)) to the formation of a thioether linkage between tryptophan and Cys has been investigated. The reaction of peptides containing Cys(MBzl)(O) and Trp with trifluoromethanesulfonic acid (TFMSA) or methanesulfonic acid (MSA) in TFA in the presence of guanidine hydrochloride (Gn&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;HCl) proceeded to give cyclic or stapled peptides possessing the Cys&#8208;Trp thioether linkage. In this reaction, strong acids such as TFMSA or MSA are necessary to activate the sulfoxide. Additionally, Gn&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;HCl plays a critical role in producing an electrophilic Cys derivative that combines with the indole by aromatic electrophilic substitution. The findings led us to conclude that the less&#8208;electrophilic Cys(MBzl)(O) serves as an acid&#8208;activated umpolung of a Cys nucleophile and is useful for S&#8208;arylation&#8208;mediated peptide cyclization.

Spin doctoring: Shear thinning is suggested to help colloidal particles adopt a chiral arrangement in a vortex, which results in strong CD properties. Furthermore, the introduction of a small molecule that both undergoes electrostatic interaction and possesses dual&#8208;site coordination bonding ability will greatly increase the storage modulus of colloids and make them maintain dynamic CD properties in the static state.







Abstract
Chiral compounds are known to be important not only because they are the fundamental components of living organisms, but also for their unique chiroptical properties. In recent years, scientists have fabricated several chiral organic supramolecular aggregates by using chiral physical fields, such as vortex flow. Herein, the relationship between dynamic chiroptical properties and rheological nature is discussed, suggesting the shear thinning properties of non&#8208;Newtonian fluids might help colloidal particles adopt a chiral arrangement in vortices. Furthermore, the storage modulus of colloids could be increased by adding a linking agent, which successfully kept the dynamic chiroptical properties in the static state. Moreover, the salt effect on the host&#8211;guest interaction involved in the colloids was studied, the results suggested a significant enhancement of the transferred dynamic circular dichroism for the achiral guest molecule.

Treating a germylene&#8208;phosphine Lewis pair, 1, with trichlorides of phosphorus, arsenic, and antimony allowed the isolation of oxidative addition products. Reduction of these compounds with sodium metal or LiBHEt3 led to the synthesis of a phosphinidene, an arsinidene and a stibinidene. After halide abstraction, a germaphosphene, 8, was isolated, and its 31P NMR data were analyzed by using quantum chemical calculations. The product of an Al&#8722;H addition was found upon treating the phosphinidene with [iBu2AlH]2.







Abstract
The reaction of the intramolecular germylene&#8208;phosphine Lewis pair (o&#8208;PPh2)C6H4GeAr* (1) with Group 15 element trichlorides ECl3 (E=P, As, Sb) was investigated. After oxidative addition, the resulting compounds (o&#8208;PPh2)C6H4(Ar*)Ge(Cl)ECl2 (2: E=P, 3: E=As, 4: E=Sb) were reduced by using sodium metal or LiHBEt3. The molecular structures of the phosphine&#8208;stabilized phosphinidene (o&#8208;PPh2)C6H4(Ar*)Ge(Cl)P (5), arsinidene (o&#8208;PPh2)C6H4(Ar*)Ge(Cl)As (6) and stibinidene (o&#8208;PPh2)C6H4(Ar*)Ge(Cl)Sb (7) are presented; they feature a two&#8208;coordinate low&#8208;valent Group 15 element. After chloride abstraction, a cyclic germaphosphene [(o&#8208;PPh2)C6H4(Ar*)GeP] [B(C6H3(CF3)2)4] (8) was isolated. The 31P NMR data of the germaphosphene were compared with literature examples and analyzed by quantum chemical calculations. The phosphinidene was treated with [iBu2AlH]2, and the product of an Al&#8722;H addition to the low&#8208;valent phosphorus atom (o&#8208;PPh2)C6H4(Ar*)Ge(H)P(H)Al(C4H9)2 (9) was characterized.

         <title>Investigation of Masked N&#8208;Acyl&#8208;N&#8208;isocyanates: Support for Oxadiazolones as Blocked N&#8208;Isocyanate Precursors</title>

Masked synthesis: N&#8208;isocyanates are reactive intermediates and their N&#8208;acyl derivatives, amido&#8208;isocyanates, are rare. Herein, their synthesis and reactivity are studied, supporting that under suitable conditions the amido&#8208;isocyanate is in equilibrium with the parent oxadiazolone. Reactions with amino&#8208;amides as nucleophiles form nitrogen&#8208;rich products, either aza&#8208;tripeptides or their parent hydantoins. Support for an isocyanate intermediate was also obtained using carboxylate ions as nucleophiles, affording N&#8208;acylhydrazides.







Abstract
In contrast to carbon&#8208;substituted isocyanates that are common building blocks, N&#8208;substituted isocyanates remain underdeveloped and reports on their N&#8208;acyl derivatives (i.&#8201;e. amido&#8208;isocyanates) are exceedingly rare. Herein, amido&#8208;isocyanates were investigated in the context of syntheses of aza&#8208;tripeptide and hydantoins subunits starting from simple bench&#8208;stable precursors. A key finding is that the amido&#8208;isocyanate formed in&#8197;situ cyclized to yield an oxadiazolone, and that under suitable reaction conditions this heterocycle is a traceless blocked (masked) N&#8208;isocyanate. Using organic bases as catalysts and upon heating, oxadiazolone formation is observed, and various nucleophiles to provide the desired aza&#8208;dipeptides or hydantoins in moderate to high yields. Further support for an amido&#8208;isocyanate intermediate was obtained using carboxylic acids as nucleophiles, affording N&#8208;acylhydrazide products.

Amphiphilicity&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly of galactose&#8208;hexaphenylbenzene based amphiphiles into galactose&#8208;decorated 2D nanosheet is reported. The extremely dense decoration of reducing sugar on the surface of the sheets is used for the in&#8197;situ synthesis and immobilization of ultrafine catalytically active AgNPs by using Tollens&#8217; reaction. The potential of the system as a recyclable catalyst for the reduction of various nitroaromatics is demonstrated. Enhanced catalytic activity is observed for the immobilized AgNPs when compared to the corresponding discrete AgNPs.







Abstract
Two major hurdles in NP&#8208;based catalysis are the aggregation of the NPs and their recycling. Immobilization of NPs onto a 2D support is the most promising strategy to overcome these difficulties. Herein, amphiphilicity&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly of galactose&#8208;hexaphenylbenzene&#8208;based amphiphiles into galactose&#8208;decorated 2D nanosheet is reported. The extremely dense decoration of reducing sugar on the surface of the sheets is used for the in&#8197;situ synthesis and immobilization of ultrafine catalytically active AgNPs by using Tollens&#8217; reaction. The potential of the system as a catalyst for the reduction of various nitroaromatics is demonstrated. Enhanced catalytic activity is observed for the immobilized AgNPs when compared to the corresponding discrete AgNPs. Recovery of the catalytic system from the reaction mixture by ultrafiltration and its subsequent recycling for several cycles without dropping its activity is shown. This is the first report demonstrating the in&#8197;situ synthesis and immobilization of ultrafine AgNPs onto a 2D nanosheet that exhibits excellent catalytic performance for the reduction of nitroaromatics.

         <title>Efficient Entropy&#8208;Driven Inhibition of Dipeptidyl Peptidase III by Hydroxyethylene Transition&#8208;State Peptidomimetics</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 56, Page 14108-14120, October 7, 2021. </description>

A transition&#8208;state&#8208;based inhibitor has been developed which efficiently inhibits the metalloprotease dipeptidylpeptidase 3 (DPP3) by releasing structured water molecules from the binding cleft.







Abstract
Dipeptidyl peptidase III (DPP3) is a ubiquitously expressed Zn&#8208;dependent protease, which plays an important role in regulating endogenous peptide hormones, such as enkephalins or angiotensins. In previous biophysical studies, it could be shown that substrate binding is driven by a large entropic contribution due to the release of water molecules from the closing binding cleft. Here, the design, synthesis and biophysical characterization of peptidomimetic inhibitors is reported, using for the first time an hydroxyethylene transition&#8208;state mimetic for a metalloprotease. Efficient routes for the synthesis of both stereoisomers of the pseudopeptide core were developed, which allowed the synthesis of peptidomimetic inhibitors mimicking the VVYPW&#8208;motif of tynorphin. The best inhibitors inhibit DPP3 in the low &#956;M range. Biophysical characterization by means of ITC measurement and X&#8208;ray crystallography confirm the unusual entropy&#8208;driven mode of binding. Stability assays demonstrated the desired stability of these inhibitors, which efficiently inhibited DPP3 in mouse brain homogenate.

         <title>Mechanochromic Luminescence (MCL) of Purely Organic Two&#8208;Component Dyes: Wide&#8208;Range MCL over 300&#8197;nm and Two&#8208;Step MCL by Charge&#8208;Transfer Complexation</title>

Two components, two steps: Control over the mechanochromic luminescence (MCL) of a dibenzofuran&#8208;based bis(1&#8208;pyrenylmethyl)diamine was achieved using a two&#8208;component donor&#8208;acceptor approach. Wide&#8208;range MCL with a solid&#8208;state emission wavelength shift of 340&#8197;nm and two&#8208;step MCL that can respond to mechanical stimuli of different intensity were realized for two&#8208;component mixtures composed of this diamine and a variety of non&#8208;MCL acceptor dyes.







Abstract
Despite recent extensive studies on mechanochromic luminescence (MCL), rational control over the magnitude of the emission&#8208;wavelength shift in response to mechanical stimuli remains challenging. In the present study, a two&#8208;component donor&#8208;acceptor approach has been applied to create a variety of organic MCL composites that exhibit remarkable emission&#8208;wavelength switching. Dibenzofuran&#8208;based bis(1&#8208;pyrenylmethyl)diamine and typical organic fluorophores have been employed as donor and acceptor dyes, respectively. Outstanding wide&#8208;range MCL with an emission&#8208;wavelength shift of over 300&#8197;nm has been achieved by mixing the diamine with 3,4,9,10&#8208;perylenetetracarboxylic diimide. Unprecedented two&#8208;step MCL in response to mechanical stimuli of different intensity has also been realized for a two&#8208;component mixture with 9,10&#8208;anthraquinone. Fluorescence microscopy observations at the single&#8208;particle level revealed that the segregation and mixing of the two&#8208;component dyes contribute to the stimuli&#8208;responsive emission&#8208;color switching of the MCL composites.

         <title>Towards an Understanding of the Molecular Mechanisms of Variable Unnatural Base&#8208;Pair Behavior: A Biophysical Analysis of dNaM&#8208;dTPT3</title>

An interdisciplinary study: The (d)NaM:(d)TPT3 unnatural base pair (UBP) can be replicated, transcribed, and translated in an organism, but its sequence context and orientation affects the fidelity and efficiency of these processes. We determined how this UBP affects nucleic acid duplexes, which provides mechanisms for variable behavior and can inform future UBP development.







Abstract
The series of unnatural base pairs (UBPs) developed by the Romesberg lab, which pair via hydrophobic and packing interactions have been replicated, transcribed, and translated inside of a living organism. However, as to why these UBPs exhibit variable fidelity and efficiency when used in different contexts is not clear. In an effort to gain some insights, we investigated the thermal stability and pairing selectivity of the (d)NaM&#8208;(d)TPT3 UBP in 11nt duplexes via UV spectroscopy and the effects on helical structure via CD spectroscopy. We observed that while the duplexes containing a UBP are less stable than fully natural duplexes, they are generally more stable than duplexes containing natural mispairs. This work provides the first insights connecting the thermal stability of the (d)NaM&#8208;(d)TPT3 UBP to the molecular mechanisms for varying replication fidelity in different sequence contexts in DNA, asymmetrical transcription fidelity, and codon:anticodon interactions and can assist in future UBP development.

Four selectively mono&#8208;, bis&#8208; and tris&#8208;trimethylammonium&#8208;substituted, bithiophene&#8208;bridged bis&#8208;triarylboranes were synthesized and their potential biological applications were investigated including live cell imaging and photo&#8208;induced cell death. It is demonstrated that their photophysical and electrochemical properties and their interactions with DNAs, RNA and cells, are strongly influenced by the number and distribution of charges within the compounds.







Abstract
The synthesis, photophysical, and electrochemical properties of selectively mono&#8208;, bis&#8208; and tris&#8208;dimethylamino&#8208; and trimethylammonium&#8208;substituted bis&#8208;triarylborane bithiophene chromophores are presented along with the water solubility and singlet oxygen sensitizing efficiency of the cationic compounds Cat1+, Cat2+, Cat(i)2+, and Cat3+. Comparison with the mono&#8208;triarylboranes reveals the large influence of the bridging unit on the properties of the bis&#8208;triarylboranes, especially those of the cationic compounds. Based on these preliminary investigations, the interactions of Cat1+, Cat2+, Cat(i)2+, and Cat3+ with DNA, RNA, and DNApore were investigated in buffered solutions. The same compounds were investigated for their ability to enter and localize within organelles of human lung carcinoma (A549) and normal lung (WI38) cells showing that not only the number of charges but also their distribution over the chromophore influences interactions and staining properties.

         <title>Rethinking Uncaging: A New Antiaromatic Photocage Driven by a Gain of Resonance Energy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 56, Page 14121-14127, October 7, 2021. </description>

The concept of excited state aromaticity was used to design a new class of photolabile protecting groups, based on cyclic, ground&#8208;state&#8208;antiaromatic systems. Supported by theoretical calculations, several thio&#8208; and nitrogen functionalized compounds were synthesized, characterized and further optimized, resulting in a well accessible, visible light absorbing, new photocage with a high uncaging cross section of 893&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 405&#8197;nm.







Abstract
Photoactivatable compounds for example photoswitches or photolabile protecting groups (PPGs, photocages) for spatiotemporal light control, play a crucial role in different areas of research. For each application, parameters such as the absorption spectrum, solubility in the respective media and/or photochemical quantum yields for several competing processes need to be optimized. The design of new photochemical tools therefore remains an important task. In this study, we exploited the concept of excited&#8208;state&#8208;aromaticity, first described by N. Colin Baird in 1971, to investigate a new class of photocages, based on cyclic, ground&#8208;state&#8208;antiaromatic systems. Several thio&#8208; and nitrogen&#8208;functionalized compounds were synthesized, photochemically characterized and further optimized, supported by quantum chemical calculations. After choosing the optimal scaffold, which shows an excellent uncaging quantum yield of 28&#8201;%, we achieved a bathochromic shift of over 100&#8197;nm, resulting in a robust, well accessible, visible light absorbing, compact new photocage with a clean photoreaction and a high quantum product (&#1013;&#8901;&#934;) of 893&#8197;M&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 405&#8197;nm.

Mis&#8208;matched: Air stable pentaphosphaferrocene or white phosphorus are used as polyphosphorus source to access molecular group 2 polyphosphides. Structurally diverse polyphosphides ranging supramolecular wheel to Zintl ions have been accessed by using various group 2 reagents such as organo&#8208;magnesium, mono&#8208;valent magnesium or molecular calcium hydride complex. The ancillary ligands and the metal ions influences the structural motifs of the polyphosphides, which was investigated theoretically as well.







Abstract
A series of molecular group 2 polyphosphides has been synthesized by using air&#8208;stable [Cp*Fe(&#951;5&#8208;P5)] (Cp*=C5Me5) or white phosphorus as polyphosphorus precursors. Different types of group 2 reagents such as organo&#8208;magnesium, mono&#8208;valent magnesium, and molecular calcium hydride complexes have been investigated to activate these polyphosphorus sources. The organo&#8208;magnesium complex [(DippBDI&#8722;Mg(CH3))2] (DippBDI={[2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3NCMe]2CH}&#8722;) reacts with [Cp*Fe(&#951;5&#8208;P5)] to give an unprecedented Mg/Fe&#8208;supramolecular wheel. Kinetically controlled activation of [Cp*Fe(&#951;5&#8208;P5)] by different mono&#8208;valent magnesium complexes allowed the isolation of Mg&#8208;coordinated formally mono&#8208; and di&#8208;reduced products of [Cp*Fe(&#951;5&#8208;P5)]. To obtain the first examples of molecular calcium&#8208;polyphosphides, a molecular calcium hydride complex was used to reduce the aromatic cyclo&#8208;P5 ring of [Cp*Fe(&#951;5&#8208;P5)]. The Ca&#8208;Fe&#8208;polyphosphide is also characterized by quantum chemical calculations and compared with the corresponding Mg complex. Moreover, a calcium coordinated Zintl ion (P7)3&#8722; was obtained by molecular calcium hydride mediated P4 reduction.

In this study, the complete mechanistic elucidation of rhodium&#8208;catalyzed propargylic C&#8722;H activation is presented. Particular attention is paid to the deactivation pathway of the catalytic reaction. The associated deactivated species has been studied in detail by NMR and Raman spectroscopy as well as X&#8208;ray crystallography. Furthermore, the present work includes a kinetic study carried out by in&#8197;situ operando NMR spectroscopy.







Abstract
Detailed mechanistic investigations on our previously reported synthesis of branched allylic esters by the rhodium complex&#8208;catalyzed propargylic C&#8722;H activation have been carried out. Based on initial mechanistic studies, we present herein more detailed investigations of the reaction mechanism. For this, various analytical (NMR, X&#8208;ray crystal structure analysis, Raman) and kinetic methods were used to characterize the formation of intermediates under the reaction conditions. The knowledge obtained by this was used to further optimize the previous conditions and generate a more active catalytic system.

         <title>Influence of N&#8208;Substituents on Photovoltaic Properties of Singly Bay&#8208;Linked Dimeric Perylene Diimides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 56, Page 14081-14091, October 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
By developing a general synthetic strategy, we synthesized a new series of bay&#8208;linked dimeric perylene diimides (diPDIs), some of which possess primary N&#8208;alkyl substituents or unsymmetric N&#8208;substitution pattern. The systematic investigation on their photovoltaic properties revealed that the primary alkyl substituents are advantageous for enhancing the device performance in terms of crystallinity improvement and film&#8208;forming controllability.







Abstract
The influence of N&#8208;substituents on the photovoltaic properties of singly bay&#8208;linked perylene diimides (diPDIs) was systematically investigated to understand the aromatic&#8208;aliphatic balance, which is beneficial for achieving high device performance in organic photovoltaic (OPV) systems. The synthesis of various N&#8208;substituted diPDIs was successfully achieved using a newly developed one&#8208;step procedure, resulting in sufficiently high yields. Detailed investigations of seven variants of diPDIs demonstrated that the primary alkyl substituents, particularly the 2&#8208;ethylhexyl group, induce the self&#8208;organized growth of thin films with high crystallinity. This is beneficial for enhancing the device performance of bulk heterojunction (BHJ) systems. The results presented herein reveal the important roles of alkyl side chains as hydrophobic solubilizing auxiliaries or primary determinants in the control of the active layer nanomorphology. This offers a valuable guideline that is essential for developing high&#8208;performance organic semiconductor materials for future practical applications.

         <title>Atypical and Asymmetric 1,3&#8208;P,N Ligands: Synthesis, Coordination and Catalytic Performance of Cycloiminophosphanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 56, Page 14007-14016, October 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Complexes, chirality and catalysts: 1,3&#8208;P,N hybrid ligands are broadly applied in cooperative catalysis, but show limited electronic variation. We report novel analogues with a high N&#8208;basicity, based on 7&#8208;membered cyclic imines. Their transition metal complexes demonstrated their donor strength (W), hemilabile coordination (Rh), and catalytic activity for nitrile hydration (Ru) and transfer hydrogenation (Ru, Ir). Chiral derivatives were also obtained, synthesized from l&#8208;menthone.







Abstract
Novel seven&#8208;membered cyclic imine&#8208;based 1,3&#8208;P,N ligands were obtained by capturing a Beckmann nitrilium ion intermediate generated in situ from cyclohexanone with benzotriazole, and then displacing it by a secondary phosphane under triflic acid promotion. These &#8220;cycloiminophosphanes&#8221; possess flexible non&#8208;isomerizable tetrahydroazepine rings with a high basicity; this sets them apart from previously reported iminophophanes. The donor strength of the ligands was investigated by using their P&#8208;&#954;1&#8208; and P,N&#8208;&#954;2&#8208;tungsten(0) carbonyl complexes, by determining the IR frequency of the trans&#8208;CO ligands. Complexes with [RhCp*Cl2]2 demonstrated the hemilability of the ligands, giving a dynamic equilibrium of &#954;1 and &#954;2 species; treatment with AgOTf gives full conversion to the &#954;2 complex. The potential for catalysis was shown in the RuII&#8208;catalyzed, solvent&#8208;free hydration of benzonitrile and the RuII&#8208; and IrI&#8208;catalyzed transfer hydrogenation of cyclohexanone in isopropanol. Finally, to enable access to asymmetric catalysts, chiral cycloiminophosphanes were prepared from l&#8208;menthone, as well as their P,N&#8208;&#954;2&#8208;RhIII and a P&#8208;&#954;1&#8208;RuII complexes.

         <title>The Catalytic Mechanism of the Retaining Glycosyltransferase Mannosylglycerate Synthase</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 56, Page 13998-14006, October 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mannosylglycerate synthase from the extremophile Rhodothermus marinus is a retaining glycosyltransferase able to synthesize a variety of small negatively charged molecules called compatible solutes. These molecules confer protection against extreme conditions such as extremely high or low temperatures, pH, and high salinity. Therefore, it has exciting potential biotechnological applications.







Abstract
To protect their intracellular proteins, extremophile microorganisms synthesize molecules called compatible solutes. These molecules are the result of the attachment of a small negatively charged molecule to a sugar molecule. It has been found that these molecules, not only protect the microorganism against osmotic stress but also against other extreme conditions. They can also confer protection against extreme conditions to isolated enzymes from different organisms making them an exciting prospect for potential biotechnological applications. One of the most widespread compatible solute in hyperthermophile organisms is the molecule 2&#8208;O&#8208;&#945;&#8208;D&#8208;mannosyl&#8208;D&#8208;glycerate (MG). In addition to confer protection to proteins against extreme conditions, MG was found to prevent Alzheimer's &#946;&#8208;amyloid aggregation and reduce &#945;&#8208;synuclein fibril formation in Parkinson's disease. In this work we studied, using computational methods, the catalytic mechanism of the synthesis of MG by the enzyme mannosylglycerate synthase (MGS) from the thermophilic bacteria Rhodothermus marinus.

         <dc:description>
The direct functionalization of C&#8722;H bonds is among the most important transformations in organic synthesis, but its efficiency depends on its selectivity that can be controlled by the innate reactivity of the substrate or a directing group. We review and discuss in a comprehensive manner C&#8722;H functionalization processes based on the transient directing group strategy. For more information, see the Review by Gwilherm Evano et&#8197;al. on page 13899.

A biophysical analysis of nucleic acid duplexes containing the unnatural hydrophobic base pair (d)NaM&#8208;dTPT3 provides an understanding of the type of molecular level interactions that could contribute to variabilities in replication, transcription and translation in a semisynthetic organism. Such approaches could provide a basis for comprehending the behavior of other unnatural base pairs (spheres top left) with a view towards unrestricted expansion of the genetic alphabet and code (spheres bottom&#8208;right) in a semisynthetic organism. More information can be found in the Full Paper by R.&#8197;Krishnamurthy et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202102348). Picture by Saurav Nagpal with the help of R.K.

The creation of two&#8208;component dyes has proven to be an effective strategy to achieve remarkable mechanochromic luminescence (MCL) properties. The shift of the maximum emission wavelength (&#916;&#955;em) range of a bis(1&#8208;pyrenylmethyl)diamine derivative has been significantly improved by mixing it with typical organic dyes that do not exhibit MCL behavior. Most notably, a wide&#8208;range MCL (&#916;&#955;em=340&#8197;nm) has been achieved for a mixture with 3,4,9,10&#8208;perylenetetracarboxylic diimide. Furthermore, a two&#8208;step MCL has been realized by mixing with 9,10&#8208;anthraquinone. More information can be found in the Full Paper by S. Ito, T.&#8197;Tachikawa, et&#8197;al.

The link is shown between a pioneering chemist's questioning &#8211; drawing and sharing thoughts on a blackboard &#8211; and a solution by means of modern catalytic tools &#8211; illustrated by computer lettering. Our question was how to regioselectively introduce a halogen atom into valuable phenylalanine derivatives without using a heavy protecting group in order to rapidly construct nonproteinogenic amino acids. The proposed solution was a Pd&#8208;catalyzed and sustainable regioselective C&#8722;H halogenation process directed by a native amine functional group. More information can be found in the Communication by G. Journot, C. Schneider, J.&#8208;F. Bri&#232;re et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202102411).

         <title>Transient Directing Groups in Metal&#8722;Organic Cooperative Catalysis</title>

Strategic functionalization: The direct functionalization of C&#8722;H bonds is among the most important transformations in organic synthesis, but its efficiency depends on its selectivity, which can be controlled by the innate reactivity of the substrate or a directing group. While this last strategy has turned out to be efficient, the directing groups need to be installed before and cleaved after the transformation. These two undesired synthetic operations can be avoided by using the transient directing group strategy that is comprehensively overviewed in this review article.







Abstract
The direct functionalization of C&#8722;H bonds is among the most fundamental chemical transformations in organic synthesis. However, when the innate reactivity of the substrate cannot be utilized for the functionalization of a given single C&#8722;H bond, this selective C&#8722;H bond functionalization mostly relies on the use of directing groups that allow bringing the catalyst in close proximity to the C&#8722;H bond to be activated and these directing groups need to be installed before and cleaved after the transformation, which involves two additional undesired synthetic operations. These additional steps dramatically reduce the overall impact and the attractiveness of C&#8722;H bond functionalization techniques since classical approaches based on substrate pre&#8208;functionalization are sometimes still more straightforward and appealing. During the past decade, a different approach involving both the in&#8197;situ installation and removal of the directing group, which can then often be used in a catalytic manner, has emerged: the transient directing group strategy. In addition to its innovative character, this strategy has brought C&#8722;H bond functionalization to an unprecedented level of usefulness and has enabled the development of remarkably efficient processes for the direct and selective introduction of functional groups onto both aromatic and aliphatic substrates. The processes unlocked by the development of these transient directing groups will be comprehensively overviewed in this review article.

         <title>Chemodynamic Therapy Combined with Multifunctional Nanomaterials and Their Applications in Tumor Treatment</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 27, Issue 56, Page 13953-13960, October 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The latest applications of chemodynamic therapy (CDT) combined with multifunctional nanomaterials in tumor treatment are summarized. Nanomaterials with different characteristics can optimize the Fenton reaction and Fenton&#8208;like reaction to make CDT produce distinctive enhancement effects. The combination of nanomaterials, CDT and various other therapies would promote the multi&#8208;functionalization of the treatment system, thereby enhancing the anticancer effect.







Abstract
During the past few decades, radiotherapy and chemotherapy have been the standard approaches for tumor treatments. However, the potential toxic effect and side effects of both radiotherapy and chemotherapy on the human body still cannot be neglected. Given this, the Fenton reaction has become one of the most effective treatment strategies to combat tumor cells. This review aims to summarize the recent advances comprehensively and systematically in chemodynamic therapy (CDT) via the Fenton reaction. In addition, a host of the advanced nano&#8208;multifunctional materials and engineering bacteria used in the Fenton reaction were also summarized. This paper would be helpful to provide guidance and lay firm foundations for future tumor treatment.

N,N&#8208;Dimethylamides for continuous flow acylations: A new acylation of (hetero)aryllithiums with polyfunctional and enolizable N,N&#8208;dimethylamides in toluene in continuous flow was reported. The required lithium species was prepared at 25&#8201;&#176;C from (hetero)aryl bromides and sec&#8208;BuLi in toluene. Additionally, a new telescoped procedure, using tetramethylurea as C1&#8208;building block, was described providing highly functionalized unsymmetrical ketones.







Abstract
The continuous flow reaction of various aryl or heteroaryl bromides in toluene in the presence of THF (1.0&#8197;equiv) with sec&#8208;BuLi (1.1&#8197;equiv) provided at 25&#8201;&#176;C within 40&#8197;sec the corresponding aryllithiums which were acylated with various functionalized N,N&#8208;dimethylamides including easily enolizable amides at &#8722;20&#8201;&#176;C within 27&#8197;sec, producing highly functionalized ketones in 48&#8211;90&#8201;% yield (36 examples). This method was well suited for the preparation of &#945;&#8208;chiral ketones such as naproxene and ibuprofen derived ketones with 99&#8201;% ee. A one&#8208;pot stepwise bis&#8208;addition of two different lithium organometallics to 1,1,3,3&#8208;tetramethyurea (TMU) provided unsymmetrical ketones in 69&#8211;79&#8201;% yield (9 examples).

         <title>Amine&#8208;Directed Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;H Halogenation of Phenylalanine Derivatives</title>

A site&#8208;selective, primary amine (as a native NH2 functionality)&#8208;directed, palladium&#8208;catalyzed C(sp2)&#8722;H halogenation (X=I, Br, Cl) of phenylalanine platforms is demonstrated. Efficient and versatile, this strategy paves the way to constructing a large array of original halogenated phenylalanine derivatives as nonproteinogenic AAs.







Abstract
An efficient primary&#8208;amine&#8208;directed, palladium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H halogenation (X=I, Br, Cl) of phenylalanine derivatives is reported on a range of quaternary amino acid (AA) derivatives thanks to suitable conditions employing trifluoroacetic acid as additive. The extension of this original native functionality&#8208;directed ortho&#8208;selective halogenation was even demonstrated with the more challenging native phenylalanine as tertiary AA.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A site-selective&lt;/b&gt;, primary amine (as a native NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; functionality)-directed, palladium-catalyzed C(sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8722;H halogenation (X=I, Br, Cl) of phenylalanine platforms is demonstrated. Efficient and versatile, this strategy paves the way to constructing a large array of original halogenated phenylalanine derivatives as nonproteinogenic AAs.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An efficient primary-amine-directed, palladium-catalyzed C&#8722;H halogenation (X=I, Br, Cl) of phenylalanine derivatives is reported on a range of quaternary amino acid (AA) derivatives thanks to suitable conditions employing trifluoroacetic acid as additive. The extension of this original native functionality-directed &lt;i&gt;ortho&lt;/i&gt;-selective halogenation was even demonstrated with the more challenging native phenylalanine as tertiary AA.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photocatalyzed E&#8594;Z Contra&#8208;thermodynamic Isomerization of Vinyl Boronates with Binaphthol</title>

         <dc:description>
Going against the grain: Photocatalytic, contra&#8208;thermodynamic E&#8594;Z isomerization of vinyl boronates by using a binaphthol catalyst is described. The reaction permits the geometrical isomerization in good&#8208;to&#8208;excellent Z/E ratio and excellent&#8208;to&#8208;quantitative yields. The reaction manifold was also studied.







Abstract
The photocatalytic contra&#8208;thermodynamic E&#8594;Z isomerization of vinyl boronates by using a binaphthol catalyst is disclosed. The reaction, based on the transient formation of a suitable chromophore with a BINOL derivative as the catalyst, allowed geometrical isomerization in good&#8208;to&#8208;excellent Z/E ratio and excellent&#8208;to&#8208;quantitative yields. The mechanism of this E&#8594;Z contra&#8208;thermodynamic isomerization was studied, and the formation of a transient chromophore species is suggested.

A transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free method using tert&#8208;butyl hypoiodite (t&#8208;BuOI) or N&#8208;iodosuccinimide (NIS) for the intramolecular C&#8722;H amination of N&#8208;alkylsulfamides is reported. The six&#8208;membered cyclic sulfamide products can be easily converted into a variety of useful 1,3&#8208;diamines. The present amination that effectively proceeds under ambient conditions, features operationally simple, practical, and scalable methodology.







Abstract
1,3&#8208;Diamines are an important class of compounds that are broadly found in natural products and are also widely used as building blocks in organic synthesis. Although the intramolecular C&#8722;H amination of N&#8208;alkylsulfamide derivatives is a reliable method for the construction of 1,3&#8208;diamine structures, the majority of these methods involve the use of a transition&#8208;metal catalyst. We herein report on a new transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free method using tert&#8208;butyl hypoiodite (t&#8208;BuOI) or N&#8208;iodosuccinimide (NIS), enabling secondary non&#8208;benzylic and tertiary C&#8722;H amination reactions to proceed. The cyclic sulfamide products can be easily transformed into 1,3&#8208;diamines. Mechanistic investigations revealed that amination reactions using t&#8208;BuOI or NIS each proceed via different pathways.

         <title>Structure and Biosynthesis of Myxofacyclines: Unique Myxobacterial Polyketides Featuring Varying and Rare Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A metabolome&#8208;guided screening approach in the novel myxobacterium  Corallococcus  sp. MCy9072 resulted in the isolation of the unprecedented natural product myxofacycline A featuring a rare isoxazole substructure. Identification and genomic investigation of additional producers alongside targeted gene inactivation experiments and heterologous expression of the corresponding biosynthetic gene cluster in the host  Myxococcus xanthus  DK1622 confirmed a noncanonical megaenzyme complex as the biosynthetic origin of myxofacycline A. Induced expression of the respective genes led to significantly increased production titers enabling the identification of six further members of the myxofacycline natural product family. Whereas myxofacycline A&#8211;D display an isoxazole substructure, myxofacycline E and F intriguingly were found to contain 4&#8208;pyrimidinole, a heterocycle unprecedented in natural products. Lastly, myxofacycline G features another rare 1,2&#8208;dihydropyrol&#8208;3&#8208;one moiety. In addition to the full structure elucidation, we report the underlying biosynthetic machinery and present a rationale for the formation of all myxofacyclines. Unexpectedly, an extraordinary polyketide synthase&#8208;nonribosomal peptide synthetase hybrid was found to produce all three types of heterocycles in these natural products.</dc:description>

Whereas myxofacycline A&#8211;D display an isoxazole substructure, myxofacycline E and F intriguingly were found to contain 4-pyrimidinole, a heterocycle unprecedented in natural products. Lastly, myxofacycline G features another rare 1,2-dihydropyrol-3-one moiety. In addition to the full structure elucidation, we report the underlying biosynthetic machinery and present a rationale for the formation of all myxofacyclines. Unexpectedly, an extraordinary polyketide synthase-nonribosomal peptide synthetase hybrid was found to produce all three types of heterocycles in these natural products.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Breaking Symmetry Relaxes Structural and Magnetic Restraints, Suppressing QTM in Enantiopure Butterfly Fe2Dy2 SMMs.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The {Fe  2  Dy  2  } butterfly systems can show Single Molecule Magnet (SMM) behaviour, the nature of which depends on details of the electronic structure, as previously demonstrated for the  [Fe  2  Dy  2  (&#956;  3  &#8208;OH)  2  (Me&#8208;teaH)  2  (O  2  CPh)  6  ]  compound, where the [N,N&#8208;bis&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxyethyl)&#8208;amino]&#8208;2&#8208;propanol (Me&#8208;teaH  3  ) ligand is usually used in its racemic form. Here we describe the consequences for the SMM properties by using enantiopure versions of this ligand and present here the first homochiral 3d/4f SMM, which could only be obtained for the S enantiomer of the ligand for  [Fe  2  Dy  2  (&#956;  3  &#8208;OH)  2  (Me&#8208;teaH)  2  (O  2  CPh)  6  ]  since the R&#8208;enantiomer underwent significant racemisation. To investigate this further, we prepared the  [Fe  2  Dy  2  (&#956;  3  &#8208;OH)  2  (Me&#8208;teaH)  2  (O  2  CPh)  4  (NO  3  )  2  ]  version, which could be obtained as the  RS  &#8208;,  R  &#8208; and  S  &#8208;compounds. Remarkably, the enantiopure versions show enhanced slow relaxation of magnetisation. The use of the enantiomerically pure ligand suppresses QTM, leading to the conclusion that use of enantiopure ligands is a &#8220;gamechanger&#8221; by breaking the cluster symmetry and altering the intimate details of the coordination cluster&#8217;s molecular structure.</dc:description>

         <title>Contrasting the Mechanism of H2 Activation by Monomeric and Potassium&#8208;Stabilized Dimeric Al(I) Complexes: Do Potassium Atoms Exert any Cooperative Effect?</title>

In this work, the activation of H  2  utilizing a NON&#8208;xanthene&#8208;Al dimer (  D  ) and monomeric (  M  ) catalysts are studied to reveal the potential role of K  +&#160;  atoms during the activation of this gas.&#160; We aim to reveal whether if  D  is more reactive than  M  (or vice versa), or if complicity between the two monomer units exits within the  D  catalyst . The results suggest that activation energies using the dimeric and monomeric catalysts were found to be very close (around 33 kcal mol  &#8208;1  ). However, a partition of activation energies unveiled that the natures of the energy barriers are inherently different, the former being dominated by a more substantial distortion of the reactants. Interestingly, during the oxidative addition, the distortion of the Al complex is minimal, while H  2  distorts the most, usually over 0.77&#916;E  dist  . Overall, it is found here that electrostatic and induction energies are the main stabilizing components of the interaction energy. The results suggest that the K  +  atoms act as stabilizers of the dimeric structure, and their catalytic role on the reaction mechanism may be negligible, acting as mere spectators in the activation of H  2  . Cooperation between the two monomers in  D  is lacking, and therefore the subsequent activation of H  2  is wholly disengaged.</dc:description>

         <title>Construction of CoS2/Zn0.5Cd0.5S S&#8208;Scheme Heterojunction for Enhancing H2 Evolution Activity Under Visible Light</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zn0.5Cd0.5S and CoS2 formed an S&#8208;type heterojunction. The mixed interface structure between them provided a new hydrogen&#8208;producing active center for each. In addition, the S&#8208;type heterojunction electron transfer mechanism not only promoted the separation of electrons (e&#8722;) and holes (h+) between Zn0.5Cd0.5S and CoS2, but also retained electrons with strong reducibility, thereby promoting the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction.







Abstract
In the field of photocatalysis, building a heterojunction is an effective way to promote electron transfer and enhance the reducibility of electrons. Herein, the S&#8208;scheme heterojunction photocatalyst (CoS2/Zn0.5Cd0.5S) of CoS2 nanospheres modified Zn0.5Cd0.5S solid solution was synthesized and studied. The H2 evolution rate of the composite catalyst reached 25.15&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1, which was 3.26&#8197;times that of single Zn0.5Cd0.5S, whereas pure CoS2 showed almost no hydrogen production activity. Moreover, CoS2/Zn0.5Cd0.5S had excellent stability and the hydrogen production rate after six cycles of experiments only dropped by 6.19&#8201;%. In addition, photoluminescence spectroscopy and photoelectrochemical experiments had effectively proved that the photogenerated carrier transfer rate of CoS2/Zn0.5Cd0.5S was better than CoS2 or Zn0.5Cd0.5S single catalyst. In this study, the synthesized CoS2 and Zn0.5Cd0.5S were both n&#8208;type semiconductors. After close contact, they followed an S&#8208;scheme heterojunction electron transfer mechanism, which not only promoted the separation of their respective holes and electrons, but also retained a stronger reduction potential, thus promoting the reduction of H+ protons in photocatalytic experiments. In short, this work provided a new basis for the construction of S&#8208;scheme heterojunction in addition to being used for photocatalytic hydrogen production.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Zn&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;Cd&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;S and CoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; formed an S-type heterojunction. The mixed interface structure between them provided a new hydrogen-producing active center for each. In addition, the S-type heterojunction electron transfer mechanism not only promoted the separation of electrons (e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) and holes (h&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) between Zn&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;Cd&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;S and CoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, but also retained electrons with strong reducibility, thereby promoting the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the field of photocatalysis, building a heterojunction is an effective way to promote electron transfer and enhance the reducibility of electrons. Herein, the S-scheme heterojunction photocatalyst (CoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/Zn&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;Cd&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;S) of CoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanospheres modified Zn&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;Cd&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;S solid solution was synthesized and studied. The H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; evolution rate of the composite catalyst reached 25.15&#8197;mmol&#8201;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, which was 3.26&#8197;times that of single Zn&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;Cd&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;S, whereas pure CoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; showed almost no hydrogen production activity. Moreover, CoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/Zn&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;Cd&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;S had excellent stability and the hydrogen production rate after six cycles of experiments only dropped by 6.19&#8201;%. In addition, photoluminescence spectroscopy and photoelectrochemical experiments had effectively proved that the photogenerated carrier transfer rate of CoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/Zn&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;Cd&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;S was better than CoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or Zn&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;Cd&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;S single catalyst. In this study, the synthesized CoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and Zn&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;Cd&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;S were both n-type semiconductors. After close contact, they followed an S-scheme heterojunction electron transfer mechanism, which not only promoted the separation of their respective holes and electrons, but also retained a stronger reduction potential, thus promoting the reduction of H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; protons in photocatalytic experiments. In short, this work provided a new basis for the construction of S-scheme heterojunction in addition to being used for photocatalytic hydrogen production.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Steering Scholl Oxidative Heterocoupling by Tuning Topology and Electronics for Building Thiananographenes and Their Functional N&#8722;/C&#8722;Congeners</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intramolecular thiophene&#8208;arene C&#8722;C heterocoupling is successfully achieved in a set of topologically and electronically engineered bis(biaryl)thiophenes (BATs) under Scholl oxidative conditions to provide symmetric and unsymmetric diphenanthrothiophenes (DPTs), simple thiananographenes. The thia&#8208;edge of diphenanthrothiophenes are conveniently transformed into blue&#8208;emissive and electrochemically stable N&#8722;/C&#8722;edged congeners.







Abstract
While intramolecular Scholl oxidative coupling between two arenes is common, successful C&#8722;C heterocoupling between thiophene and arene is scarce. The latter is due to the notorious reactivity of thiophene towards polymerization under oxidative conditions. This report systematically demonstrates how topological variation of electronics and reactivity in thiophene substrates can lead to efficient oxidative heterocoupling. Bis(biaryl)thiophenes having reactive &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;positions open are the choice of substrates. The cyclizing arene partners are so electronically tuned for thiophene's reactivity (at &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;) as to establish C&#8722;C bond oxidatively generating symmetrical as well as unsymmetrical diphenanthrothiophenes which are basic thiananographenes. Depending on the cyclizing&#8208;couple's electronics, either arene&#8208; or thiophene&#8208;centered oxidation initiates C&#8722;C heterocoupling. The potential utility of these simple thiananographenes is further unfurled by converting them to functional N&#8722;/C&#8208;graphene segments that are aza&#8208;corannulene precursor and tetrabenzospirobifluorene. Their bright emission and extended electrochemical stability are remarkable that may be potentially important and applicable.

         <title>Host&#8208;Guest Complexation Between Cyclodextrins and Hybrid Hexavanadates: What are the Driving Forces?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrophobic or chaotropic effect? Hybrid Lindqvist&#8208;type polyoxovanadates self&#8208;assemble with cyclodextrins (&#945;&#8208;, &#946;&#8208;, and &#947;&#8208;) in water to form a wide variety of host&#8208;guest complexes. Such a supramolecular process originates from the ability of the CD host to desolvate the hybrid guests, but the nature of this solvent effect depends on the cyclodextrins, inducing direct consequences on redox properties of the guest.







Abstract
Host&#8208;guest complexes between native cyclodextrins (&#945;&#8208;, &#946;&#8208; and &#947;&#8208;CD) and hybrid Lindqvist&#8208;type polyoxovanadates (POVs) [V6O13((OCH2)3C&#8722;R)2]2&#8211; with R = CH2CH3, NO2, CH2OH and NH(BOC) (BOC = N&#8208;tert&#8208;butoxycarbonyl) were studied in aqueous solution. Six crystal structures determined by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis revealed the nature of the functional R group strongly influences the host&#8211;guest conformation and also the crystal packing. In all systems isolated in the solid&#8208;state, the organic groups R are embedded within the cyclodextrin cavities, involving only a few weak supramolecular contacts. The interaction between hybrid POVs and the macrocyclic organic hosts have been deeply studied in solution using ITC, cyclic voltammetry and NMR methods (1D 1H NMR, and 2D DOSY, and ROESY). This set of complementary techniques provides clear insights about the strength of interactions and the binding host&#8208;guest modes occurring in aqueous solution, highlighting a dramatic influence of the functional group R on the supramolecular properties of the hexavanadate polyoxoanions (association constant K1:1 vary from 0 to 2 000&#8197;M&#8722;1) while isolated functional organic groups exhibit only very weak intrinsic affinity with CDs. Electrochemical and calorimetric investigations suggest that the driving force of the host&#8208;guest association involving larger CDs (&#946;&#8208; and &#947;&#8208;CD) is mainly related to the chaotropic effect. In contrast, the hydrophobic effect supported by weak attractive forces appears as the main contributor for the formation of &#945;&#8208;CD&#8208;containing host&#8208;guest complexes. In any cases, the origin of driving forces is clearly related to the ability of the macrocyclic host to desolvate the exposed moieties of the hybrid POVs.

         <title>Helical Oligophenylene Linked with [2.2]Paracyclophane: Stereogenic &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Dye for Highly Emissive Chiroptical Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Helical oligophenylene: Chiral cyclic homologues with unique structures such as double helices and twisted triangles, have been synthesized as highly emissive chiroptical dyes. The twisted quaterphenyl units exhibited CPL with a high quantum yield (0.73&#8211;0.80), leading to relatively high CPL brightness.







Abstract
A stereogenic &#960;&#8208;system based on dimer (2) and trimer (3) of [2.2]paracyclophane (PC) and biphenyl was prepared and its structural, photophysical, and chiroptical properties were investigated. X&#8208;ray analysis revealed that the quaterphenyl moieties in 2 adopt a double helical structure anchoring [2.2]PC from both sides. Furthermore, 3 forms a isosceles triangle structure with a large chiral cavity. A homodesmotic reaction using DFT calculations revealed that 2 has a larger strain energy than 3 owing to its highly twisted phenylene linkers. Electronic and circular dichroic (CD) spectra were recorded in CH2Cl2 solution. The spectra of both 2 and 3 are similar, and their longest absorption band accompanying a remarkable Cotton effect is attributed to the transition from HOMO to LUMO, which is delocalized to the quaterphenyl moiety. These compounds exhibit fairly high fluorescence quantum yields (&#981;=0.70&#8211;0.83) and moderate dissymmetry factor (|gCPL|=1.6&#215;10&#8722;3) in circularly polarized luminescence (CPL).

Better Constructions: By inserting anthracene core in the deep&#8208;blue building block, two D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A fluorescent blue emitters, ICz&#8208;An&#8208;PPI and IP&#8208;An&#8208;PPI were designed and synthesized. Impressively, the doped deep&#8208;blue OLED based on IP&#8208;An&#8208;PPI exhibited excellent performances with an unexpectedly high EQE of 7.5&#8201;% with the CIE coordinate of (0.150, 0.118), which is one of the best among the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art deep&#8208;blue OLEDs with the CIEy &lt;0.12.







Abstract
Acquiring desirable device performance with deep&#8208;blue color purity that fulfills practical application requirements is still a challenge. Bipolar fluorescent emitters with hybrid local and charge transfer (HLCT) state may serve to address this issue. Herein, by inserting anthracene core in the deep&#8208;blue building blocks, the authors successfully developed two highly twisted D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A fluorescent emitters, ICz&#8208;An&#8208;PPI and IP&#8208;An&#8208;PPI, featuring different acceptor groups. Both exhibited superb thermal stabilities, high photo luminescent quantum yields and excellent bipolar transport capabilities. The non&#8208;doped OLEDs using ICz&#8208;An&#8208;PPI and IP&#8208;An&#8208;PPI as the emitting layers showed efficient blue emission with an external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 4.32&#8201;% and 5.41&#8201;%, and the CIE coordinates of (0.147, 0.180) and (0.149, 0.150), respectively. In addition, the deep blue doped device based on ICz&#8208;An&#8208;PPI was achieved with an excellent CEmax of 5.83 cd A&#8722;1, EQEmax of 4.6&#8201;% and the CIE coordinate of (0.148, 0.078), which is extremely close to the National Television Standards Committee (NTSC) standard. Particularly, IP&#8208;An&#8208;PPI&#8208;based doped device had better performance, with an EQEmax of 7.51&#8201;% and the CIE coordinate of (0.150, 0.118), which was very impressive among the recently reported deep&#8208;blue OLEDs with the CIEy &lt;0.12. Such high performance may be attributed to the hot exciton HLCT mechanism via T7 to S2. Our work may provide a new approach for designing high&#8208;efficiency deep&#8208;blue materials.

         <title>Janus All&#8208;Cis 2,3,4,5,6&#8208;Pentafluorocyclohexyl Building Blocks Applied to Medicinal Chemistry and Bioactives Discovery Chemistry</title>

         <dc:description>
Janus all&#8208;cis 2,3,4,5,6&#8208;pentafluorocyclohexyl building blocks have been incorporated into medicinal chemistry type products. These cyclohexanes have polarized faces and represent a unique motif for medicinal chemistry. The paper introduces a range of new accessible building blocks which can be elaborated into a diversity of drug type structures demonstrating their wider utility for exploration in bioactives discovery chemistry.







Abstract
Monoalkylated derivatives of the unusually polar all&#8208;cis 2,3,4,5,6&#8208; pentafluorocyclohexyl (Janus face) motif are prepared starting from an aryl hydrogenation of 2,3,4,5,6&#8208; pentafluorophenylacetate methyl ester 15. The method used Zeng's Rh(CAAC) carbene catalyst 4 in the hydrogenation following the protocol developed by Glorius. The resultant Janus pentafluorocyclohexylacetate methyl ester 16 was converted to the corresponding alcohol 18, aldehyde 13, bromide 29 and azide 14 through functional group manipulations, and some of these building blocks were used in Ugi&#8208;multicomponent and Cu&#8208;catalysed click reactions. NBoc protected pentafluoroarylphenylalanine methyl ester 35 was also subject to an aryl hydrogenation, and then deprotection to generate the Janus face &#946;&#8208;pentafluorocyclohexyl&#8208;alanine amino acid 15, which was incorporated into representative members of an emerging class of candidate antiviral compounds. Log&#8197;P measurements demonstrate that the all&#8208;cis 2,3,4,5,6&#8208;pentafluorocyclohexyl ring system is more polar than a phenyl ring. In overview the paper introduces new building blocks containing this Janus ring and demonstrates their progression to molecules typically used in bioactives discovery programmes.

         <title>Stereoselective Direct N&#8208;Trifluoropropenylation of Heterocycles with a Hypervalent Iodonium Reagent</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
E&#8208;selective trifluoropropenylation of versatile N&#8208;heterocycles was developed with the utilization of trifluoropropenyliodonium salts. The procedure enables the straightforward direct introduction of the trifluoroalkenyl moiety into heterocyclic scaffolds under simple and mild reaction conditions.







Abstract
The availability and synthesis of fluorinated enamine derivatives such as N&#8208;(3,3,3&#8208;trifluoropropenyl)heterocycles are challenging, especially through direct functionalization of the heterocyclic scaffold. Herein, a stereoselective N&#8208;trifluoropropenylation method based on the use of a bench&#8208;stable trifluoropropenyl iodonium salt is described. This reagent enables the straightforward trifluoropropenylation of various N&#8208;heterocycles under mild reaction conditions, providing trifluoromethyl enamine type moieties with high stereoselectivity and efficiency.

         <title>Computational Analysis of Photophysical Properties and Reactivity of a New Phototherapeutic Cyclometalated Au(III)&#8208;Hydride Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reactivity exploration by DFT and TD&#8208;DFT of a cyclometalated Au(III)&#8208;hydride complex, as the first member of a new series of Au(III) complexes, has confirmed the low hydricity in dark and the high propensity to undergo substitution reactions leading to H2 release when irradiated. Computational photophysical characterization has allowed the identification of the excited singlet and triplet states involved in substitution reactions. Two&#8208;photon excitation feasibility has been also tested.







Abstract
Gold(III) complexes have recently emerged as new versatile and efficacious metal containing anticancer agents. In an attempt to reconcile the specific affinity of such complexes for target sulfur containing biomolecules with their capability to strongly bind thiol&#8208;containing compounds widely distributed in non&#8208;tumoral cells, a new series of cyclometalated Au(III)&#8208;hydride complexes has been proposed as photoactivatable anticancer prodrugs. Here, the computational exploration of the photophysical properties and reactivity in dark and under light irradiation of the first member of the series, named 1&#8201;a, is reported. Complex 1&#8201;a low hydricity in dark together with facile hydride substitution leading to H2 elimination under excitation by visible light have been examined by means of DFT and TD&#8208;DFT computations. Both singlet and triplet excited states have been characterized, allowing the identification of the active species involved in photoactivation pathways leading to the controlled detachment of the hydride ligand. Also the viable two&#8208;photon activation at the ideal phototherapeutic window has been investigated.

         <title>Hollow Carbon Sphere&#8211;Modified Graphitic Carbon Nitride for Efficient Photocatalytic H2 Production</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hollow carbon sphere&#8211;implanted graphitic carbon nitride nanosheet photocatalysts were prepared by a bottom&#8208;up method. The photocatalysts promote photoelectron transfer and suppress charge recombination through special interface coupling and hollow carbon spheres as an electron acceptor, leading to remarkably improved photocatalytic efficiency. This work thus provides an efficient pathway for the design of efficient and low&#8208;cost cocatalysts for photocatalysis.

This work thus provides an efficient pathway for the design of efficient and low-cost cocatalysts for photocatalysis.

         <title>Perylene Bisimide&#8208;Cored Supramolecular Coordination Complexes: Interplay between Ensembles, Excited State Processes, and Aggregation Behaviors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly was employed to manipulate inter&#8208;/intra&#8208;molecular interaction of PBI&#8208;based complexes (trigonal prism and dicycle). Two complexes exhibit distinct different properties on excited state process and aggregation behaviour due to their geometrical arrangements. Trigonal prism to dicycle transformation could be tracked by fluorescence change. (Note: ISC and SB&#8208;CS in graphic are intersystem crossing and symmetry&#8208;breaking charge separation, respectively.)







Abstract
Manipulating the optical properties of fluorescent species is challenging owing to complicated and tedious synthetic works. Herein, the photophysical properties of perylene bisimide (PBI) were effectively tuned by varying the geometrical arrangement of PBI moieties within supramolecular coordination complexes (SCCs), where a PBI&#8208;based dicycle (2) and a trigonal prism (3) were generated via using a typical 90&#176; Pt(II) reagent, cis&#8208;(PEt3)2Pt(OTf)2&#8208;based coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly approach. The ligand, an ortho&#8208;tetrapyridiyl&#8208;PBI (1), exhibits a moderate fluorescence quantum yield (&#8764;13&#8201;%) and efficient inter&#8208;system crossing (ISC). 2, however, is much more emissive with a fluorescence quantum yield of &#8764;41&#8201;%, and the relevant ISC process is significantly hindered. The fluorescence quantum yield of 3 is merely &#8764;6&#8201;% due to the observed symmetry&#8208;breaking charge separation (SB&#8208;CS), which turns to triplet state upon charge recombination. Interestingly, 3 could be fully transformed into 2 by simply adding a suitable amount of a 90&#176; Pt(II)&#8208;based neutral triangle. Moreover, 2 tends to form discrete dimers both in crystal and solution states, but 3 does not show the property. Therefore, controlling geometrical arrangement of fluorophores through coordination&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly could be taken as another effective way to tune their excited state relaxation pathways and construct high&#8208;performance optical molecular materials, which generally have to be prepared via organic synthesis.

         <title>Halogen Bonding Propensity in Solution: Direct Observation and Computational Prediction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strongly activated halogen bond donors give rise to observable bound and unbound states in Raman spectroscopy when paired with good halogen bond acceptors. The two strongest halogen bond donors examined have almost identical electrostatic potentials, but differ vastly in theoretical binding affinity and experimental halogen bonding strength. The energy terms giving rise to this behavior are elucidated by energy decomposition analysis.







Abstract
Halogen&#8208;bonded complexes are often designed by consideration of electrostatic potential (ESP) predictions. ESP predictions do not capture the myriad variables associated with halogen bond (XB) donors and acceptors; thus, binding interaction cannot be quantitatively predicted. Here, a discrepancy between predictions based on ESP energy difference (&#916;Vs) and computed gas phase binding energy (&#916;Ebind) motivated the experimental determination of the relative strength of halogen bonding interactions in solution by Raman spectroscopic observation of complexes formed from interacting five iodobenzene&#8208;derived XB donors and four pyridine XB acceptors. Evaluation of &#916;Ebind coupled with absolutely&#8208;localized molecular orbital energy decomposition analysis (ALMO&#8208;EDA) deconvolutes halogen bonding energy contributions and reveals a prominent role for charge transfer (CT) interactions. Raman spectra reveal &#916;Ebind accurately predicts stronger interactions within iodopentafluorobenzene (IPFB) complexes than with 1&#8208;iodo&#8208;3,5&#8208;dinitrobenzene (IDNB) complexes even though IPFB has similar electrostatics to IDNB and contains a smaller &#963;&#8208;hole.

         <dc:description>
The essence of van der Waals (vdW) deep&#8208;UV (DUV) nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals are illustrated as an important material system recently developed. Using first&#8208;principles simulations, the key role of the interlayer vdW connection for DUV NLO balance is discussed and the discovery process of related vdW DUV NLO materials is reviewed, with emphasis on the prospect of opportunities and challenges.







Abstract
Van der Waals (vdW) deep&#8208;UV (DUV) nonlinear optical (NLO) crystal is an important material system recently developed. Herein, we review its concept and original intention, and then summarized the discovery process of related materials, including the role of A&#8208;site cations and the resulting two&#8208;/one&#8208;dimensional vdW DUV NLO systems. Finally, we evaluate the practical DUV NLO performance and prospected the opportunities and challenges.

         <title>Facile Conversion of Molecularly Complex (Hetero)aryl Carboxylic Acids into Alkynes for Accelerated SAR Exploration</title>

         <dc:description>
Bringing molecularly complex (hetero)aryl carboxylic acids into the bioisostere world: A functional&#8208;group&#8208;tolerant and operationally simple decarbonylative alkynylation is reported that allows the synthesis of aryl alkynes from highly functionalized aryl and heteroaryl carboxylic acids. The reaction shows an unmatched substrate scope mainly thanks to its remarkably mild reaction conditions using a homogenous Pd/Cu bimetallic system. The utility of this protocol was showcased by the preparation of a triazolo analog of the commercial drug moclobemide.







Abstract
1,2,3&#8208;Triazoles are well&#8208;established bioisosteres for amides, often installed as a result of structure&#8722;activity&#8208;relationship (SAR) exploration. A straightforward approach to assess the effect of the replacement of an amide by a triazole would start from the carboxylic acid and the amine used for the formation of a given amide and convert them into the corresponding alkyne and azide for cyclization by copper&#8208;catalyzed alkyne&#8722;azide cycloaddition (CuAAC). Herein, we report a functional&#8208;group&#8208;tolerant and operationally simple decarbonylative alkynylation that allows the conversion of complex (hetero)aryl carboxylic acids into alkynes. Furthermore, the utility of this method was demonstrated in the preparation of a triazolo analog of the commercial drug moclobemide. Lastly, mechanistic investigations using labeled carboxylic acid derivatives clearly show the decarbonylative nature of this transformation.

         <title>Impact of Surface Defects on LaNiO3 Perovskite Electrocatalysts for the Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The impact of defect generation by thermal reduction on the structure and electrocatalytic performance of LaNiO3 has been examined in a combined experimental and theoretical approach. Surface defects, predominantly surface oxygen vacancies, promote oxygen evolution over LaNiO3 resulting in a significantly lower overpotential (380&#8197;mV) for a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, faster kinetics (70.8&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&#8722;1 Tafel slope) and superior stability in alkaline electrolytes to conventionally prepared LaNiO3. More information can be found in the Full Paper by H. Arandiyan, Y. Wang, T. Maschmeyer et&#8197;al. (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202102672).

Surface defects, predominantly surface oxygen vacancies, promote oxygen evolution over LaNiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; resulting in a significantly lower overpotential (380&#8197;mV) for a current density of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, faster kinetics (70.8&#8197;mV&#8201;dec&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; Tafel slope) and superior stability in alkaline electrolytes to conventionally prepared LaNiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. More information can be found in the Full Paper by H. Arandiyan, Y. Wang, T. Maschmeyer et&#8197;al. (DOI: &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/chem.202102672"&gt;10.1002/chem.202102672&lt;/a&gt;).

         <title>Formation and Structure of Hydrolytic Methylaluminoxane Activators</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modelling of kinetics using density functional theory, combined with numerical simulation, reveals that methylaluminoxane activators are sheets formed by assembly of linear oligomers, wherein the statistics and mechanism of aggregation favor formation of even&#8208;numbered sheets.







Abstract
Methylaluminoxane (MAO) activators have sheet structures which form ion&#8208;pairs on reaction of neutral donors such as octamethyltrisiloxane (OMTS). The ion&#8208;pairs can be detected by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI&#8208;MS) in polar media. The growth of these reactive precursors during hydrolysis of Me3Al can be monitored using ESI&#8208;MS. Density functional theory, combined with numerical simulation of growth, indicates that this process involves rapid formation of low MW oligomers, followed by assembly of these species into low MW sheets. These can grow through further addition of low MW oligomers or by fusion into larger sheets. The mechanism of these growth processes leads to the prediction that even&#8208;numbered sheets should be favored, and this surprising result is confirmed by ESI&#8208;MS monitoring experiments of both activator growth and MAO aging.

         <title>Synthesis and Characterisation of Luminescent [CrIII2L(&#956;&#8208;carboxylato)]3+ Complexes with High&#8208;Spin S=3 Ground States (L=N6S2 donor ligand)</title>

         <dc:description>
The synthesis of mixed&#8208;ligand chromium(III) complexes, [CrIII2L(O2CR)]3+, where L represents a macrocyclic binucleating hexaamine&#8208;dithiophenolato ligand and R=Me or Ph, has been achieved. The complexes exhibit a relatively strong intramolecular ferromagnetic exchange interaction that leads to an S=3 spin ground state (J &#8764;24&#8211;34&#8197;cm&#8722;1). The complexes emit at 750&#8197;nm (&#934;L=45&#8201;%) by excitation into the intense LMCT and d&#8208;d* bands.







Abstract
The synthesis, structure, magnetic, and photophysical properties of two dinuclear, luminescent, mixed&#8208;ligand [CrIII2L(O2CR)]3+ complexes (R=CH3 (1), Ph (2)) of a 24&#8208;membered binucleating hexa&#8208;aza&#8208;dithiophenolate macrocycle (L)2&#8722; are presented. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis reveals an edge&#8208;sharing bioctahedral N3Cr(&#956;&#8208;SR)2(&#956;1,3&#8208;O2CR)CrN3 core structure with &#956;1,3&#8208;bridging carboxylate groups. A ferromagnetic superexchange interaction between the electron spins of the Cr3+ ions leads to a high&#8208;spin (S=3) ground state. The coupling constants (J=+24.2(1)&#8197;cm&#8722;1 (1), +34.8(4)&#8197;cm&#8722;1 (2), H=&#8722;2JS1S2) are significantly larger than in related bis&#8208;&#956;&#8208;alkoxido&#8208;&#956;&#8208;carboxylato structures. DFT calculations performed on both complexes reproduce both the sign and strength of the exchange interactions found experimentally. Frozen methanol&#8208;dichloromethane 1&#8201;:&#8201;1 solutions of 1 and 2 luminesce at 750&#8197;nm when excited into the 4LMCT state on the 4A2 &#8594; 2T1 (&#957;2) bands (&#955;exc=405&#8197;nm). The absolute quantum yields (&#934;L) for 1 and 2 were found to be strongly temperature dependent. At 77&#8197;K in frozen MeOH/CH2Cl2 glasses, &#934;L=0.44&#177;0.02&#8201; (for 1), &#934;L=0.45&#177;0.02&#8201; (for 2).

The compounds form two isotypic series of 3D&#8208;coordination polymers and exhibit fair thermal stability up to 360 &#176;C. The luminescence properties of all ten compounds were determined in the solid&#8208;state, with an antenna effect through ligand&#8211;metal energy transfer leading to high efficiency of the luminescence displayed by good quantum yields up to 74%. The emission is mainly based on ion specific lanthanide&#8208;dependent intra 4f&#8211;4f&#8208;transitions for Tb  3+  : green, Dy  3+  : yellow, Sm  3+  : orange&#8208;red, Eu  3+  : red. For the Gd  3+  containing compounds, yellow emission of ligand triplet&#8208;based phosphorescence is observed at room temperature and 77 K. Co&#8208;doping of the Gd&#8208;containing frameworks with Eu  3+  and Tb  3+  allow further shifting of the chromaticity towards white light emission.</dc:description>

         <title>Dehydrogenative Double C&#8212;H Bond Activation in a Germylene&#8208;Rhodium Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Transition metal tetrylene complexes offer great opportunities for molecular cooperation due to the ambiphilic character of the group 14 element. Here we focus on the coordination of germylene [(Ar Mes2 ) 2 Ge:] (Ar Mes = C 6 H 3 &#8208;2,6&#8208;(C 6 H 2 &#8208;2,4,6&#8208;Me 3 ) 2 ) to [RhCl(COD)] 2 (COD = 1,5&#8208;cyclooctadiene), which yields a neutral germyl complex in which the rhodium center exhibits both &#951; 6 &#8208; and &#951; 2 &#8208;coordination to two mesityl rings in an unusual pincer&#8208;type structure. Chloride abstraction from this species triggers a singular dehydrogenative double C&#8212;H bond activation across the Ge/Rh motif. We have isolated and fully characterized three rhodium&#8208;germyl species associated to three C&#8212;H cleavage events along this process. The reaction mechanism has been further investigated by computational means, supporting the key cooperative action of rhodium and germanium centers.</dc:description>

The present strategy offers a straightforward, and facile approach for the synthesis of valuable Se&#8208;containing cyclopentenes. The remarkable features of this strategy include easily accessible starting materials, metal&#8208;free and peroxide&#8208;free conditions, high atom economy, simple operation and broad substrate scope. More importantly, the reaction is easy to scale&#8208;up and can be extended to the construction of six&#8208;membered carbon ring.</dc:description>

         <title>Crystal Structure Dependent Dissolution of Non&#8208;Cubic Au Crystallites in Aqua Regia</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aqua regia readily dissolves the fcc tips of the Au bipyramidal crystallites and the core consisting of tetragonal and orthorhombic lattices, undergoes transformation to produce increased proportions of tetragonal lattices, before eventually giving up in dissolution. The study not only showcases the reactivity patterns associated with different Au lattices but also provides an insight into the lattice distribution within the crystallite.







Abstract
Properties of metal crystallites are governed by their morphologies and inherent crystal structures. In this work, bipyramidal Au microcrystallites hosting non&#8208;cubic lattices, body&#8208;centered orthorhombic and tetragonal (together termed as bc(o,t)), are investigated for their stability in aqua regia. Specifically, microcrystallites comprising 92&#8201;% of bc(o,t) have been subjected to aqua regia of different concentrations and the changes in morphology and lattice phases have been monitored using scanning electron microscopy and X&#8208;ray diffraction techniques. The dissolution process was found to be crystal structure dependent and begin at the bipyramidal tips enriched with fcc lattice while retaining the bc(o,t) rich body. Interestingly, with increasing the reaction times, the remaining core was found to be highly reluctant to dissolution and instead, transformed to tetragonal lattices which with increasing treatment, exhibited lattice parameters closer to that of fcc. The study reveals the presence of a bc(o,t)&#8208;fcc core&#8208;shell structure with the tips enriched with fcc.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Induced Ruthenium&#8208;Catalyzed C&#8722;H Benzylations and Allylations at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photo&#8208;induced C&#8722;H benzylation under ruthernium catalysis enabled exceedingly mild syntheses of diarylmethane compounds. The robustness of this approach was demonstrated by an ample scope, including photo C&#8722;H allylations and reactions on water.







Abstract
The ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed synthesis of diarylmethane compounds was realized under exceedingly mild photoredox conditions without the use of exogenous photocatalysts. The versatility and robustness of the ruthenium&#8208;catalyzed C&#8722;H benzylation was reflected by an ample scope, including multifold C&#8722;H functionalizations, as well as transformable pyrazoles, imidates and sensitive nucleosides. Mechanistic studies were indicative of a photoactive cyclometalated ruthenium complex, which also enabled versatile C&#8722;H allylations.

         <title>Trinuclear Cyanido&#8208;Bridged [Cr2Fe] Complexes: To Be or not to Be a Single&#8208;Molecule Magnet, a Matter of Straightness</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyanido&#8208;bridged trinuclear [CrIII2FeII] complexes were investigated in order to assess the influence of the bending of the apical Fe&#8722;N&#8801;C linkages on their SMM behaviors. A comparative examination of the structural and magnetic properties showed an obvious effect of the deviation from straightness of the M&#8722;N&#8801;C alignment on the slow relaxation of the magnetization exhibited by the complexes. Theoretical calculations have highlighted important effects on both the magnetic anisotropy of the FeII center and the exchange interactions with the CrIII units.







Abstract
Trinuclear systems of formula [{Cr(LN3O2Ph)(CN)2}2M(H2LN3O2R)] (M=MnII and FeII, LN3O2R stands for pentadentate ligands) were prepared in order to assess the influence of the bending of the apical M&#8722;N&#8801;C linkages on the magnetic anisotropy of the FeII derivatives and in turn on their Single&#8208;Molecule Magnet (SMM) behaviors. The cyanido&#8208;bridged [Cr2M] derivatives were obtained by assembling trans&#8208;dicyanido CrIII complex [Cr(LN3O2Ph)(CN)2]&#8722; and divalent pentagonal bipyramid complexes [MII(H2LN3O2R)]2+ with various R substituents (R=NH2, cyclohexyl, S,S&#8208;mandelic) imparting different steric demand to the central moiety of the complexes. A comparative examination of the structural and magnetic properties showed an obvious effect of the deviation from straightness of the M&#8722;N&#8801;C alignment on the slow relaxation of the magnetization exhibited by the [Cr2Fe] complexes. Theoretical calculations have highlighted important effects of the bending of the apical C&#8722;N&#8722;Fe linkages on both the magnetic anisotropy of the FeII center and the exchange interactions with the CrIII units.

         <title>Plasmon Coupling Enhanced Micro&#8208;spectroscopy and Imaging for Sensitive Discrimination of Membrane Domains of a Single Cell</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Different cell&#160;membrane domains play different roles&#160;in many&#160;cell processes, and the discrimination of these domains is of considerable&#160;importance for the elucidation of cellular functions.&#160;However, the strategies&#160;available for distinguishing these cell membrane&#160;domains&#160;are limited.&#160;We propose a novel technique called plasmon coupling enhanced micro&#8208;spectroscopy and imaging&#160;to discriminate basal and lateral membrane domains of a single cell.&#160;This technology combines&#160;the application of an&#160;additional plasmonic silver film for&#160;surface plasmon&#160;(SP) excitation to selectively excite and enhance&#160;the basal membranes in the near&#8208;field with directional enhanced microscopic imaging and spectroscopy. The SP and critical evanescent fields are induced upon excitation&#160;through a&#160;silver&#8208;coated semitransparent coverslip at the SPR and critical&#160;angles, respectively. The basal and lateral membrane domains&#160;located within the SP and critical evanescent fields can be selectively excited and distinguished&#160;by adjusting the incident angle of laser&#160;irradiation. Moreover, the brighter images and more intense&#160;spectra of membrane&#8208;targeting fluorescence&#8208;Raman probes under directional excitation than in conventional EPI mode&#160;allow clear identification of the membrane domains.</dc:description>

         <title>Emerging Yttrium Phosphides with Tetrahedron Phosphorus and Superconductivity under High Pressures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Metal phosphides have triggered growing interest for their exotic structures and striking properties. Hence, within advanced structure search and first&#8208;principle calculations, we identify several unprecedented Y&#8208;P compounds (e.g., Y  3  P, Y  2  P, Y  3  P  2  , Y  2  P  3  , YP  2  , and YP  3  ) under compression. Interestingly, as phosphorus content increases, P atoms exhibit diverse behaviors corresponding to standalone anion, dumbbell, zigzag chain, planar sheet, crossing chain&#8208;like network, buckled layer, three&#8208;dimensional framework, and wrinkled layer. Particularly,  Fd  &#8208;3  m  YP  2  can be viewed as assemblage of diamond&#8208;like Y structure and rare vertex&#8208;sharing tetrahedral P4 units. Impressively, electron&#8208;phonon coupling (EPC) calculations elucidate that  Pm  &#8208;3  m  Y  3  P possesses the highest superconducting critical temperature  T  c  of 10.2 K among binary transition metal phosphides. Remarkably, the EPC of  Pm  &#8208;3  m  Y  3  P mainly arises from the contribution of low&#8208;frequency soft phonon modes, whereas mid&#8208;frequency phonon modes of  Fd  &#8208;3  m  YP  2  dominate. These results strengthen knowledge of metal phosphides and pave a way for seeking superconductive transition metal phosphides.</dc:description>

         <title>Insertion Chemistry of Lutetacyclopropene toward Unsaturated C&#8722;O/C&#8722;N Bonds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Although the reaction chemistry of transition metallacyclopropenes has been well&#8208;established in the last decades, the reactivity of rare&#8208;earth metallacyclopropenes remains elusive. Herein, we report the reaction of lutetacyclopropene  1  toward a series of unsaturated molecules. The reaction of  1  with one equiv of PhCOMe, Ar  1  CHO (Ar  1  = 2,6&#8208;Me  2  C  6  H  3  ), W(CO)  6  , and PhCH=NPh provided oxalutetacyclopentenes, metallacyclic lutetoxycarbene,  and azalutetacyclopentene  via 1,2&#8208;insertion of C=O, C&#8801;O, or C=N bonds into Lu&#8722;C  sp2  bond, respectively. However, the reaction between  1  and Ar  2  N=C=NAr  2  (Ar  2  = 4&#8208;MeC  6  H  4  ) gave an acyclic lutetium complex with a  diamidinate  ligand by the coupling of one molecule of  1  with two carbodiimides, irrespective of the amount of carbodiimide employed. More interestingly, when  1  was treated with two equiv of Ar  1  CHO, the reductive coupling of two C=O bonds was discovered to give a  lutetium pinacolate complex along with the release of tolan.&#160;  Remarkably, the reactivity of  1  is significantly different from that of scandacyclopropenes; these metallacycles derived from  1  all represent the first cases in rare&#8208;earth organometallic chemistry.</dc:description>

         <title>Fast detection of entacapone by a lanthanide&#8208;organic framework with rhombic channels</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Entacapone (ENT) is a powerful catechol&#8208;  O  &#8208;methyl transferase inhibitor that is used for the diagnosis and treatment of Parkinson&#8217;s syndrome, but the amount used must be well controlled to avoid overtreatment and side effect. Fast and selective detection of ENT needs well&#8208;matched energy levels and well&#8208;designed sensor&#8208;ENT interaction which is highly challenging. In this work, a water stable europium&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework (  Eu&#8208;TDA  ) was synthesized to detect ENT by luminescence with excellent reusability and selectivity in the presence of main coexisting and interference species of plasma with a limit of detection of 5.01 &#956;M. The experimental results showed that the luminescence of  Eu&#8208;TDA  can be effectively quenched by ENT via well&#8208;designed photoinduced electron transfer mechanism and internal filtration effect mechanism in the system.</dc:description>

         <title>Competing Reaction Pathways in Heterogeneously Catalysed Hydrogenation of Allyl Cyanide: The Chemical Nature of Surface Species</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We present a mechanistic study on the formation of an active ligand layer over Pd(111), turning the catalytic surface highly active and selective in partial hydrogenation of an &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehyde acrolein. Specifically, we investigate the chemical composition of a ligand layer consisting of allyl cyanide deposited on Pd(111) and its dynamic changes under the hydrogenation conditions. On pristine surface, allyl cyanide largely retains its chemical structure and forms a layer of molecular species with the CN bond oriented nearly parallel to the underlying metal. In the presence of hydrogen, the chemical composition of allyl cyanide strongly changes. At 100 K, allyl cyanide transfers to unsaturated imine species, containing the C=C and C=N double bonds. At increasing temperatures, these species undergo two competing reaction pathways. First, the C=C bond become hydrogenated and the stable N&#8208;butylimine species are produced. In the competing pathway, the unsaturated imine reacts with hydrogen to fully hydrogenate the imine group and produce butylamine. The latter species are unstable under the hydrogenation reaction conditions and desorb from the surface, while the N&#8208;butylimine adsorbates formed in the first reaction pathway remain adsorbed and act as an active ligand layer in selective hydrogenation of acrolein.</dc:description>

         <title>The Chemical Bond: When Atom Size Instead of Electronegativity Difference Determines Trend in Bond Strength</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>We have quantum chemically analyzed element&#8211;element bonds of archetypal HnX&#8211;YHn&#160;molecules (X, Y = C, N, O, F, Si, P, S, Cl, Br, I), using density functional theory. One purpose is to obtain a set of consistent homolytic bond dissociation energies (BDE) for establishing accurate trends across the periodic table. The main objective is to elucidate the underlying physical factors behind these chemical bonding trends. On one hand, we confirm that, along a period (e.g., from C&#8211;C to C&#8211;F), bonds strengthen because the electronegativity difference across the bond increases. But, down a period, our findings constitute a paradigm shift. From C&#8211;F to C&#8211;I, for example, bonds do become weaker, however, not because of the decreasing electro&#173;negativity difference.&#160;Instead, we show that the effective atom size is the causal factor behind bond weakening in this series, and behind the weakening in orbital interactions at the equilibrium distance.&#160;We discuss the actual bonding mechanism and the importance of analyzing this mechanism as a function of the bond distance.</dc:description>

         <title>NMR Crystallography Enhanced by Quantum Chemical Calculations and Liquid State NMR for the Investigation of Se NHC Adducts.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>N

heterocyclic carbene ligands (NHC) are widely utilized in catalysis and material science. They are characterized by their steric and electronic properties. Steric properties are usually quantified on the basis of their static structure, which can be determined by X&#8208;ray diffraction. The electronic properties are estimated in the liquid state; for example, via the 77Se liquid state NMR of Se&#8208;NHC adducts. We demonstrate that 77Se NMR crystallography can contribute to the characterization of the structural and electronic properties of NHC in solid and liquid states. Selected Se&#8208;NHC adducts are investigated via 77Se solid state NMR and X&#8208;ray crystallography, supported by quantum chemical calculations. This investigation reveals a correlation between the molecular structure of adducts and NMR parameters, including not only isotropic chemical shifts but also the other chemical shift tensor components. Afterwards, the liquid state 77Se NMR data is presented and interpreted in terms of the quantum chemistry modelling. The discrepancy between the structural and electronic properties, and in particular the &#960;&#8208;accepting abilities of adducts in the solid and liquid states is discussed. Finally, the 13C isotropic chemical shift from the liquid state NMR and the 13C tensor components are also discussed, and compared with their 77Se counterparts. 77Se NMR crystallography can deliver valuable information about NHC ligands, and together with liquid state 77Se NMR can provide an in&#8208;depth outlook on the properties of NHC ligands.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A thiophene&#8208;fused 1,4&#8208;diazapentalene (TAP) was rationally designed and synthesized as a C=N&#8208;containing 4n&#960;&#8208;electron systems that exhibits restored antiaromaticity impaired by the doping with C=N bonds. X&#8208;ray crystallographic analysis and quantum chemical calculations revealed that the annulation of thiophene rings with the 1,4&#8208;diazapentalene moiety resulted in the much higher antiaromaticity than the pristine 1,4&#8208;diazapentalene. These effects can be ascribed to the reduced bond alternation of the 8&#8208;membered&#8208;ring&#8208;periphery caused by the stabilization of the less&#8208;stable bond&#8208;shifted resonance structure upon increasing the degree of substitution of imine moieties. Consequently, TAP underwent facile hydrogenation even under mild conditions because of its pronounced antiaromaticity and high aromaticity of the corresponding hydrogenated product H  2  &#8208;TAP. In addition, the electrophilic C=N moieties in TAP led to the formation of a dense &#960;&#8208;stacked structure. These results highlight the effect of partial replacement of C=C bonds with C=N bonds in antiaromatic &#960;&#8208;electron systems.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The synthesis of iodine(I) complexes with either benzoimidazole or carbazole&#8208;derived  sp  2  N  &#8208;containing Lewis bases is described, as well as their corresponding silver(I) complexes.

The  1  H and  1  H&#8208;  15  N HMBC NMR studies unambiguously confirm the formation of the complexes in all cases via the [N &#8212; Ag &#8212; N]  +  &#8594; [N &#8212; I &#8212; N]  +  cation exchange, with the  15  N NMR chemical shift change between 94 to 111 ppm when compared to the free ligand. The single crystal X&#8208;ray crystallographic studies on four I  +  complexes revealed highly symmetrical [N &#8212; I &#8212; N]  +  bonds with I &#8212; N bond distances of 2.21 &#8208; 2.26 &#197; and N &#8212; I &#8212; N angles of 177 &#8208; 180 &#176; , whilst some of the corresponding Ag  +  complexes showed a clear deviation from linearity with N &#8212; Ag &#8212; N angles of ca. 150 &#176; and Ag &#8212; N bond distances of 2.09 &#8208; 2.18 &#197;.</dc:description>

The single crystal X-ray crystallographic studies on four I  +  complexes revealed highly symmetrical [N &#8212; I &#8212; N]  +  bonds with I &#8212; N bond distances of 2.21 - 2.26 &#197; and N &#8212; I &#8212; N angles of 177 - 180 &#176; , whilst some of the corresponding Ag  +  complexes showed a clear deviation from linearity with N &#8212; Ag &#8212; N angles of ca. 150 &#176; and Ag &#8212; N bond distances of 2.09 - 2.18 &#197;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Push&#8210;Pull Stiff&#8208;Stilbene: Proton&#8208;Gated Visible&#8208;Light Photoswitching and Acid&#8208;Catalyzed Isomerization</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Donor&#8208;acceptor substituted stiff&#8208;stilbene is shown to undergo isomerization induced by visible light avoiding the need for harmful UV light. This visible&#8208;light photoswitching is inhibited by protonation of the dimethylamino&#8208;donor unit, disrupting the push&#8208;pull character and thus, gating of the photochromic properties is allowed by acid/base addition. Remarkably, the addition of a mild acid also triggers fast thermal back isomerization, which is unprecedented for stiff&#8208;stilbene photoswitches usually having a very high energy barrier for this process. These combined features offer unique orthogonal control over switching behavior by light and protonation, which is investigated in detail by  1  H NMR and UV/Vis spectroscopy. In addition, TD&#8208;DFT calculations are used to gain further insight into the absorption properties. Our results will help elevating the level of control over dynamic behavior in stiff&#8208;stilbene applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Luminescence Chiral Exciplexes with Sky&#8208;Blue and Green Circularly Polarized &#8208;Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorecence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Luminescent exciplexes based on a chiral electron donor molecule and achiral acceptor ones are reported as a new approach to design circularly polarized (CP) and thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters.&#160; This innovative strategy results in rather high CP luminescence values with g lum up to 7 &#180; 10 &#8208;3 , almost one order of magnitude higher in comparison to the CPL signal recorded for the chiral donor alone ( g lum ~ 8 &#180; 10 &#8208;4 ). This increase occurs concomitantly to a CPL sign inversion, as a result of the strong charge&#8208;transfer emission character, as experimentally and theoretically rationalized using a covalent chiral Donor&#8208;Acceptor model. Interestingly, blue, green&#8208;yellow and red chiral luminescent exciplexes can be obtained by playing with the electron accepting character of the achiral unit while keeping the same chiral donor unit. These results bring new (inter)molecular guidelines to obtain simply and efficiently multi&#8208;color CP&#8208;TADF emitters.</dc:description>

         <title>Metal&#8722;organic frameworks with novel catenane&#8208;like interlocking: metal&#8208;determined photoresponse and uranyl sensing</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The assembly of two tripyridinium&#8208;tricarboxylate ligands and different metal ions leads to seven isostructural MOFs, which show novel 2D&#174;2D supramolecular entanglement featuring catenane&#8208;like interlocking of tricyclic cages. The MOFs show tripyridinium&#8208;afforded and metal&#8208;modulated photoresponsive properties. The MOFs with d  10  metal centers (  1&#8208;Cd, 1&#8208;Zn, 2&#8208;Cd, 2&#8208;Zn)  show fast and reversible photochromism and concomitant fluorescence quenching,  1&#8208;Ni  displays slower photochromism but does not fluoresce, and  1&#8208;Co  and  2&#8208;Co  are neither photochromic nor fluorescent. We show that the network entanglement dictates donor&#8208;acceptor close contacts, which enable fluorescence originated from interligand charge transfer. The contacts also allow photoinduced electron transfer, which underlies photochromism and concomitant fluorescence response. The metal dependence in fluorescence and photochromism can be related to energy transfer through metal&#8208;centered  d&#8208;d  transitions. In addition,  1&#8208;Cd  is demonstrated to be a potential fluorescence sensor for sensitive and selective detection of UO  2  2+  in water</dc:description>

         <dc:description>The high theoretical specific capacity, strong structural designability and relatively inexpensive manufacturing cost make the exploration of organic electrode materials more attractive in recent years. In this article, owing to the large &#960;&#8208;conjugated structure, plenty of nitrogen heteroatoms and multiring aromatic system, polyazaacene analogue poly(1,6&#8208;dihydropyrazino[2,3g]quinoxaline&#8208;2,3,8&#8208;triyl&#8208;7&#8208;(2 H  )&#8208;ylidene&#8208;7,8&#8208;dimethylidene) (PQL) was applied as the anode in sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). PQL was almost insoluble in conventional liquid organic electrolyte (1 M NaClO 4  in ethylene carbonate (EC)/dimethyl carbonate (DMC) (v:v=1:1) with 5% fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC)), which strongly improved its cycle stability.
