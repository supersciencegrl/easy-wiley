         <title>Atroposelective Nenitzescu Indole Synthesis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the helix&#8208;shaped vines growing in the garden, as well as for many bioactive molecules and other three&#8208;dimensional objects, chirality is an essential and ubiquitous property. The synthetic control of atropoisomerism along C&#8722;N bonds is particularly rare and challenging, however. A simple CrIII&#8211;salen complex was nevertheless used as a chiral enantiopure catalyst for a highly atroposelective Nenitzescu indole synthesis. More information can be found in the Research Article by F.&#8197;W. Patureau and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202300279).

         <title>Co2+ to Al3+ Substitution Induced Dual&#8208;Site Synergistic Catalysis to Friedel&#8208;Crafts Alkylation Reactions</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple Co2+ to Al3+ substitution in Al4B6O15 lattice leads to the dual&#8208;site synergistic catalysis, that is the Friedel&#8208;Crafts alkylation reaction between &#946;&#8208;nitrostyrene adsorbed and activated at the Lewis acidic site (unsaturated Co2+) and the indole molecule, which is activated by an adjacent reactive oxygen species.







Abstract
The dual&#8208;site synergistic effect in heterogeneous catalysis is quite interesting, and also complex because at least two substrate molecules are adsorbed or activated on the catalyst surface, which apparently needs two spatially separated and functionally independent active sites. It would become more difficult when the substrate molecules are large ones. The replacement of Al3+ in Al4B6O15 lattice with Co2+ leads to the formation of unsaturated Co2+ (4&#8208;fold coordination) along with oxygen vacancies (Ov). The former one behaves as a medium&#8208;strength Lewis acid site, and can adsorb and activate molecules with a nitro group (e.&#8201;g., &#946;&#8208;nitrostyrene). The latter one can adsorb and activate oxygen species, which further activates the indole derivatives. Next, the spatially separated dual sites on the catalyst surface can synergistically and efficiently catalyze their Friedel&#8208;Crafts alkylation reactions under mild conditions. The high durability can be proved by the as&#8208;maintained high yields, that is, 98, 93, 96, 92 and 90&#8197;% for 5 runs, respectively. The reaction kinetics obey the second&#8208;order characteristic. Annealing under hydrogen condition can further generate more surficial Ov, leading to an improvement to the catalytic activity. A simple and probably routine aliovalent doping endows such a complex synergistic catalysis involving two large substrate molecules, providing an inspired perspective of developing dual&#8208;site catalysts.

Synthesis of 2&#8208;(4,5&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;1H&#8208;imidazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl) phenol using 10&#8208;CSA catalyst. ESIPT fluorescent property of the molecule with a large stokes shift of 120&#8197;nm. Estimation of copper (II) through fluorescent quenching and ratiometry. A novel method for the estimation of amino acids by competitive reversion of the fluorescence.







Abstract
We report the synthesis of 2&#8208;(4,5&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;1H&#8208;imidazole&#8208;2&#8208;yl)phenol (TPI&#8208;9) as an interesting fluorescent molecule displaying Excited&#8208;State Intramolecular&#8208;Proton&#8208;Transfer (ESIPT) with stokes shift of 120&#8197;nm. Phenolic compounds with the ability to form intramolecular hydrogen bonds and subsequent proton transfer are known as ESIPT fluorophores. Proton accepting ability can increase significantly by tailoring electron&#8208;donating groups. With the assistance of an environment&#8208;friendly organocatalyst, 10&#8208;camphor sulfonic acid (10&#8208;CSA), TPI&#8208;9 was synthesized to introduce substituents with electron&#8208;donating abilities to develop an efficient ESIPT mechanism. Factors influencing the emission, such as solvent, pH, and metal ions, are investigated. Quenching of fluorescence by Cu2+ through chelation enhancement quenching effect with a high selectivity allowed the establishment of a Cu2+ sensor with an LoD of 0.57&#8197;ppm and a ratiometric estimation with an LoD of 0.73&#8197;ppm. Metal binding (2&#8201;:&#8201;1) stoichiometry and quenching constant (0.0072&#8197;mol&#8722;1s&#8722;1) are calculated from Job's and Stern&#8208;Volmer plots. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations are in accordance with the experimental results. Competitive replacement of TPI&#8208;9 by amino acids restores ESIPT, consequently, the fluorescence. Thus, an &#8220;off&#8208;on&#8221; fluorescence sensor for amino acid estimation is developed under 1 minute incubation. A linear relationship between amino acid concentration and fluorescence intensity is in 0&#8208;20&#8197;&#956;g/mL range, and the LoD is less than 2.2&#8197;&#956;g/mL.

         <title>Coumarin C&#8722;H Functionalization by Mn(I) Carbonyls: Mechanistic Insight by Ultra&#8208;Fast IR Spectroscopic Analysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Towards &#960;&#8208;extended hybrid coumarin&#8208;pyridinium compounds: We have developed a remarkable methodology for the synthesis of hybrid coumarin&#8208;pyridinium compounds using Mn(I) carbonyl chemistry. The system was found suitable for forensic examination of the key steps underpinning CO loss, alkyne coordination and insertion, and subsequent reductive elimination, which were quantifiable by time&#8208;resolved spectroscopic methods.







Abstract
Mn(I) C&#8722;H functionalization of coumarins provides a versatile and practical method for the rapid assembly of fused polycyclic pyridinium&#8208;containing coumarins in a regioselective manner. The synthetic strategy enables application of bench&#8208;stable organomanganese reagents in both photochemical&#8208; and thermal&#8208;promoted reactions. The cyclomanganated intermediates, and global reaction system, provide an ideal testing ground for structural characterization of the active Mn(I) carbonyl&#8208;containing species, including transient species observable by ultra&#8208;fast time&#8208;resolved spectroscopic methods. The thermodynamic reductive elimination product, solely encountered from reaction between alkynes and air&#8208;stable organometallic cyclomanganated coumarins, has enabled characterization of a critical seven&#8208;membered Mn(I) intermediate, detected by time&#8208;resolved infrared spectroscopy, enabling the elucidation of the temporal profile of key steps in the reductive elimination pathway. Quantitative data are provided. Manganated polycyclic products are readily decomplexed by AgBF4, opening&#8208;up an efficient route to the formation of &#960;&#8208;extended hybrid coumarin&#8208;pyridinium compounds.

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#8220;This study brings C&#8722;N atroposelectivity outside of the hands of a few methodology experts, and into the hands of general organic chemists, biochemists, medicinal chemists, etc.&#8221; This and more about the story behind the front cover can be found in the article at 10.1002/chem.202300279).







Abstract
Invited for the cover of this issue is the group of Frederic&#8197;W. Patureau at the RWTH Aachen University. The image depicts atropoisomerism, in particular through the helix&#8208;shaped vines in the forefront focus. This metaphorically illustrates the importance of atroposelectivity in biologically active molecules, such as in the 5&#8208;hydroxyindoles that were accessed through the first enantioselective Nenitzescu indole synthesis.

         <title>Orbital Nature of Carboionic Monoradicals Made from Diradicals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Monoradical cations and anions made by redox electron transfer on neutral diradicals and both with different sign charges stabilized in an identical &#960;&#8208;conjugated platform are understood from a dual perspective as provided by molecular orbital theory and valence bond theory. Their solid&#8208;state structures and optical properties as well as their validity for ambipolar charge transport are discussed.







Abstract
The electronic, optical, and solid state properties of a series of monoradicals, anions and cations obtained from starting neutral diradicals have been studied. Diradicals based on s&#8208;indacene and indenoacenes, with benzothiophenes fused and in different orientations, feature a varying degree of diradical character in the neutral state, which is here related with the properties of the radical redox forms. The analysis of their optical features in the polymethine monoradicals has been carried out in the framework of the molecular orbital and valence bond theories. Electronic UV&#8208;Vis&#8208;NIR absorption, X&#8208;ray solid&#8208;state diffraction and quantum chemical calculations have been carried out. Studies of the different positive&#8208;/negative&#8208;charged species, both residing in the same skeletal &#960;&#8208;conjugated backbone, are rare for organic molecules. The key factor for the dual stabilization is the presence of the starting diradical character that enables to indistinctively accommodate a pseudo&#8208;hole and a pseudo&#8208;electron defect with certainly small reorganization energies for ambipolar charge transport.

         <title>Modular Principle for Complex Disordered Tetrahedral Frameworks in Quenched High&#8208;Pressure Phases of Phosphorus Oxide Nitrides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#8220;Data analysis proved even more challenging than data acquisition, as crystallites notoriously contain intergrown domains of two phases.&#8221; This and more about the story behind the front cover can be found in the article at 10.1002/chem.202203892).







Abstract
Invited for the cover of this issue are the groups of Oliver Oeckler at Leipzig University and Wolfgang Schnick at University of Munich (LMU). The image background depicts a diffraction pattern of an intergrown crystal containing P40O31N46 as a night sky. P40O31N46 and P74O59N84 form complex disordered frameworks, a cutout of which symbolizes the earth's surface (which mainly contains silicates with related building blocks). The structures are built up from chain&#8208;like building units, which fall like rain, symbolizing the modular building scheme. Read the full text of the article at 10.1002/chem.202203892.

         <title>Exploring Zr&#8208;based Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks as Smart Electrochromic Sensors by Coordination&#8208;Driven Surface Engineering</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>As emerging stimuli&#8208;responsive materials, electrochromic metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are still not utilized in sensing applications due to difficulties in water stability, facile synthesis and functionalization, and efficient translation of specific recognition events. Here, we firstly find that a Zr&#8208;based MOF furnished with postsynthetically created viologen&#8208;like electron&#8208;deficient moiety was electrochromic active. With a coordination&#8208;driven surface engineering strategy where phosphate&#8208;containing biomolecules are tethered to Zr nodes of the MOF, fine tuning the interface electron transfer was readily achieved, thus benefitting for constructing smart electrochromic sensors through the combination of the sensitivity of electrochemistry with the visuality of colorimetry. Particularly, MOF&#8208;coated conductive films enabled label&#8208;free detection of phosphoproteins, and aptamer&#8208;functionalized ones responded specifically to the target. In two cases distinct color changes allow for visual quantification. This study represents the first example of MOF&#8208;based electrochromic sensors developed by an efficient strategy, indicating the generality to electrochromic counterparts for various sensing applications.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Aromatic amides can be used to construct light&#8208;harvesting materials with valuable optical properties. The amide bond is formed using well&#8208;known coupling agents in near quantitative yield, as illustrated here through the synthesis of two boron dipyrromethene derivatives bearing an amide linkage. The primary concern with acyl amides is rotation around the C&#8208;N bond, leading to cis and trans isomers. Using NMR spectroscopy, quantum chemical calculations and critical comparison to simpler benzamides, the stereochemistry of the target compounds has been addressed. The N&#8208;cyclohexyl derivative gave diffraction quality crystals that established a trans geometry for the amide bond. Quantum chemical calculations support the trans geometry as being the lowest&#8208;energy structure in solution but indicate that inversion of the aryl ring is an important structural feature. Indeed, rotation around the C(sp2)&#8208;C(aryl) bond has a strong influence on the solution&#8208;phase NMR spectra. The amide connection has minimal effect on the photophysical properties.</dc:description>

Single crystal to single crystal transition: This study reports the synthesis of two hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) and the transformation of iHOF&#8208;10 to iHOF&#8208;11. The results show that water molecules induce the single crystal to single crystal transition process, as well as increase the proton conductivity.







Abstract
Two ionic hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (iHOF&#8208;10, iHOF&#8208;11) were prepared using 1,1&#8242;&#8208;diamino&#8208;4,4&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine diiodide (Dbpy&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;2I) and tetrakis(4&#8208;sulfophenyl)ethylene (H4TPE). With increasing RH and temperature, water molecules induce single crystal to single crystal (SCSC) transformation of iHOF&#8208;10, resulting in the formation of iHOF&#8208;11. At 90&#8201;&#176;C, 98&#8201;% RH, the proton conductivity of iHOF&#8208;11 (7.03&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1) is 2.09 times higher than iHOF&#8208;10 (3.37&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1). At 50&#8201;&#176;C, 98&#8201;% RH, iHOF&#8208;11 (9.49&#215;10&#8722;4&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1) is 19.06 times higher than iHOF&#8208;10 (4.98&#215;10&#8722;5&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1). The proton conductivity shows water molecules enter the crystal and induce crystal transformation and reorganization of the hydrogen bonding structure, thus increasing the proton conductivity and stability.

         <title>Construction of Y&#8208;Doped BiVO4 Photocatalysts for Efficient Two&#8208;Electron O2 Reduction to H2O2</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Y doping induces the formation of monoclinic/tetragonal BiVO4 heterojunction and improves the O2 adsorption, which facilitates the two&#8208;electron reduction of O2. Compared with original BiVO4, the photocatalytic H2O2 production activity of Y&#8208;doped BiVO4 is significantly increased.







Abstract
Photocatalytic hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production on BiVO4 photocatalysts using water and oxygen as raw materials is a green and sustainable process. However, the photocatalytic efficiency of pristine BiVO4 is limited by severe charge recombination. In this work, rare earth element Yttrium (Y) doped BiVO4 photocatalysts were fabricated by the hydrothermal method. In the photocatalytic H2O2 production experiment, the optimized Y&#8208;doped BiVO4 photocatalyst produced 114&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1 of H2O2 under simulated sunlight (AM1.5) irradiation, which is four times higher than production activity of pure BiVO4 (26&#8197;&#956;mol&#8201;g&#8722;1&#8201;h&#8722;1). Density functional theory (DFT) calculation revealed that Y doping can enhance oxygen adsorption on the BiVO4 photocatalyst surface. Mechanistic investigations suggest that the doping process induces the in situ formation of monoclinic/tetragonal BiVO4 heterojunction, which further promotes the photogenerated carriers separation efficiency.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Induced In Situ Generation of Br&#248;nsted Acid for Catalytic Friedel&#8211;Crafts Alkylation of Indoles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photo&#8208;induced indole 2&#8208;alkylation reaction using unactivated, sterically congested alkenes as the Friedel&#8211;Crafts alkylation reagent gives a variety of 2&#8208;branched alkylated indole molecules in generally good efficiencies, with a broad scope of functional groups well tolerated.







Abstract
A photo&#8208;induced indole 2&#8208;alkylation reaction was developed with unactivated stereo&#8208;congested alkenes used as the Friedel&#8211;Crafts alkylation reagent. The neutral, traceless and inexpensive perfluoroalkyl iodide C4F9I was used as the radical initiator in catalytic amount under irradiation by a blue LED light. Br&#248;nsted acids are in&#8197;situ generated from the radical transfer reactions between the indole substrates and the perfluoroiodide catalyst. A variety of 2&#8208;branched alkylated indole molecules could be obtained from this approach in generally good efficiencies, with a broad scope of functional groups well tolerated. Mechanistic studies via both experimental and computational methods indicate that the reaction was accelerated by the protons generated from the crack of the indole&#8208;derived radical cation species.

         <dc:description>
A novel antibacterial diterpenoid: The chemical investigation of Hainan soft coral Sinularia nanolobata, has led to the isolation and characterization of a novel antibacterial diterpenoid, Nanolobatone A, featuring an unprecedented tricyclo[10.3.0.01,2]pentadecane carbon skeleton, along with eight new casbane&#8208;type diterpenoids.







Abstract
Nanolobatone A, featuring an unprecedented tricyclo[10.3.0.01,2]pentadecane carbon skeleton, along with four new polyoxygenated and four unusual endoperoxide&#8208;bridged casbane&#8208;type diterpenoids were isolated from the Hainan soft coral Sinularia nanolobata. The structures of the new compounds were established by extensive spectroscopic analysis, X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis, and time&#8208;dependent density functional theory/electronic circular dichroism calculations. A plausible biosynthetic pathway of new isolates was proposed. Bioassays revealed that nanolobatone A showed weak antibacterial activity against the Gram&#8208;positive bacteria Streptococcus pyogenes.

         <title>Chalcogen Bonding Catalysis of the Cloke&#8208;Wilson Rearrangement</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conventionally, the Cloke&#8208;Wilson rearrangement is facilitated by strong Lewis acids, Br&#248;nsted acids and Lewis bases. Herein, a chalcogen bonding catalysis approach to the Cloke&#8208;Wilson rearrangement is established, affording dihydrofurans with moderate to good yields.







Abstract
The Cloke&#8208;Wilson rearrangement is an important method to construct heterocycles which was conventionally facilitated by strong Lewis acids, Br&#248;nsted acids and Lewis bases. A weak interaction catalysis approach to the Cloke&#8208;Wilson rearrangement remains a challenging topic and yet no example is reported. Herein, a chalcogen bonding catalysis method to achieve the Cloke&#8208;Wilson rearrangement is described that involves activation of carbonyl cyclopropanes by double Se&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O interactions. This chalcogen bonding catalysis approach afforded a wide range of dihydrofurans with good yields, thus establishing an alternative strategy to catalyze the Cloke&#8208;Wilson rearrangement.

Herein, a chalcogen bonding catalysis method to achieve the Cloke-Wilson rearrangement is described that involves activation of carbonyl cyclopropanes by double Se&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O interactions. This chalcogen bonding catalysis approach afforded a wide range of dihydrofurans with good yields, thus establishing an alternative strategy to catalyze the Cloke-Wilson rearrangement.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Tunable and Efficient Nanoporous CuAg Alloy Catalysts Toward Methanol Oxidation Reaction Synthesized by Electrochemical Dealloying of Metallic Glassy Precursors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three&#8208;dimensional nanoporous CuAg alloy catalysts with various Cu/Ag ratios are prepared by electrochemical dealloying of metallic glassy precursors. The NPCu1.75Ag catalyst presents the best methanol electro&#8208;oxidation properties, including a high current density and good operation stability. The designed electrodes are expected to be promising catalysts for alkaline direct methanol fuel cell applications.







Abstract
Three&#8208;dimensional (3D) nanoporous CuAg (NPCuAg) alloy catalysts with various Cu/Ag ratios are prepared by electrochemical dealloying of metallic glassy (MG) precursors. All dealloyed samples exhibit homogenous nanoporous structure and element composition distribution. After systematically evaluating their electrocatalytic performance toward MOR, it was found that the catalytic activity of the NPCuAg catalysts is enhanced along with the increase of Cu/Ag ratio, which may be attributed to the more exposed active reaction sites derived from high surface area of nanoporous structure and the optimal synergistic effect. Thus, the NPCu1.75Ag alloy catalyst presents the best methanol electro&#8208;oxidation properties, including a high current density of 397.2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and good operation stability that retaining 84.5&#8201;% catalytic activity even after 7200&#8197;s. These results outperform most reported copper&#8208;based MOR catalysts in alkaline methanol solution. Considering these advantages, the designed electrodes are expected to be promising catalysts for alkaline DMFCs applications.

         <title>Enantioselective Transformations from Nitriles to NH2&#8208;&#945;&#8208;Tertiary Amines</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new catalytic strategy from commercial nitriles to high enantioselective &#945;&#8208;tertiary primary amines in up to 90&#8201;% yield and 95&#8201;% enantiomeric excess was developed. This approach goes through twice addition processes in one pot. Specifically, organolithium reagents were added to nitriles to form the imine intermediates in&#8197;situ which were further transformed by a catalytic asymmetric addition of Cu&#8208;allyl to afford the &#945;&#8208;tertiary homoallylic NH2&#8208;amines.







Abstract
Organic molecules, containing one or more amine chiral centers, are very common to see in natural products and medicines. Although a large number of methods have been developed to afford enantiopure amines, most of the known approaches are limited with various reasons. For example, many methodologies start from nitrogen protected and activated substrates, which usually need multistep operations and seriously decrease the atom economy. Here we disclose a new catalytic strategy from commercial nitriles to high enantioselective &#945;&#8208;tertiary primary amines in up to 90&#8201;% yield and 95&#8201;% enantiomeric excess. This transformation firstly undergoes an addition process of organolithium reagents to nitriles to generate the imine intermediates in&#8197;situ. Subsequently, the most challenging step is by employing copper catalytic enantioselective addition of AllylBpin to the imine intermediates to form the final amines in one pot.

         <title>Selective Oxidation of Methane to Oxygenates using Oxygen via Tandem Catalysis</title>

Selective oxidation of methane to oxygenates using low&#8208;cost and environment&#8208;friendly molecular oxygen (O2) under mild reaction conditions is a promising strategy but still remains grand challenge. This Concept article highlights the main strategies employed to transform methane to oxygenates with O2 as oxidant coupling with in&#8197;situ generation of H2O2.







Abstract
Selective oxidation of methane to oxygenates using low&#8208;cost and environment&#8208;friendly molecular oxygen (O2) under mild reaction conditions is a promising strategy but still remains grand challenge. It is of great importance to accelerate the activation of O2 to generate highly active oxygen species, such as hydroxyl peroxide and hydroxyl species to improve catalytic performance for selective oxidation of methane. Selective oxidation of methane using O2 by coupling with in&#8197;situ generation of hydrogen peroxide via tandem catalysis ensures the easy formation of active oxygen species for methane activation, leading to high oxygenates productivity under mild conditions. In this concept, we summarized the recent progresses for selective oxidation of methane to oxygenates using O2 based on tandem catalysis by coupling with in&#8197;situ generation of hydrogen peroxide. The remaining challenges and future perspectives for selective oxidation of methane to oxygenates via tandem catalysis were also proposed.

         <title>Microporous Metal&#8208;Phosphonates with a Novel Orthogonalized Linker and Complementary Guests: Insights for Trivalent Metal Complexes from Divalent Metal Complexes</title>

Metal&#8208;organic framework or smoked meat sandwiches? A novel orthogonalized aryl&#8208;phosphonate linker is used to direct formation of porous open frameworks. The network structures are highly dependent on the inclusion and structure of the guest aromatic compounds.







Abstract
The reliable self&#8208;assembly of microporous metal&#8208;phosphonate materials remains a longstanding challenge. This stems from, generally, more coordination modes for the functional group allowing more dense structures, and stronger bonding driving less crystalline products. Here, a novel orthogonalized aryl&#8208;phosphonate linker, 1,3,5&#8208;tris(4&#8217;&#8208;phosphono&#8208;2&#8217;,6&#8217;&#8208;dimethylphenyl) benzene (H6L3) has been used to direct formation of open frameworks. The peripheral aryl rings of H6L3 are orthogonalized relative to the central aromatic ring giving a tri&#8208;cleft conformation of the linker in which small aromatic molecules can readily associate. When coordinated to magnesium ions, a series of porous crystalline metal&#8208;organic, and hydrogen&#8208;bonded metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs, HMOFs) are formed (CALF&#8208;41 (Mg), HCALF&#8208;42 (Mg), &#8208;43 (Mg)). While most metal&#8208;organic frameworks are tailored based on choice of metal and linker, here, the network structures are highly dependent on the inclusion and structure of the guest aromatic compounds. Larger guests, and a higher stoichiometry of metal, result in increased solvation of the metal ion, resulting in networks with connectivities increasingly involving hydrogen&#8208;bonds rather than direct phosphonate coordination. Upon thermal activation and aromatic template removal, the materials exhibit surface areas ranging from 400&#8211;600&#8197;m2/g. Self&#8208;assembly in the absence of aromatic guests yields mixtures of phases, frequently co&#8208;producing a dense 3&#8208;fold interpenetrated structure (1). Interestingly, a series of both more porous (530&#8211;900&#8197;m2/g), and more robust solids is formed by complexing with trivalent metal ions (Al, Ga, In) with aromatic guest; however, these are only attainable as microcrystalline powders. The polyprotic nature of phosphonate linkers enables structural analogy to the divalent analogues and these are identified as CALF&#8208;41 analogues. Finally, insights to the structural transformations during metal ion desolvation in this family are gained by considering a pair of structurally related Co materials, whose hydrogen&#8208;bonded (HCALF&#8208;44 (Co)) and desolvated (CALF&#8208;44 (Co)) coordination bonded networks were fully structurally characterized.

Ab initio metadynamics simulations under explicit solvent environments were performed to investigate the promotion effect of HFIP solvent in Friedel&#8211;Crafts alkylation and Cope rearrangement reactions. The H&#8208;bonding network and the HFIP&#8208;substrate C&#8722;H/&#960; interaction are identified as the major factors affecting reactivity.







Abstract
The solvent effects in Friedel&#8211;Crafts cycloalkylation of epoxides and Cope rearrangement of aldimines were investigated by using ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. Explicit molecular treatments were applied for both reactants and solvents. The reaction mechanisms were elucidated via free energy calculations based on metadynamics simulations. The results reveal that both reactions proceed in a concerted fashion. Key solvent&#8208;substrate interactions are identified from the structures of transition states with explicit solvent molecules. The remarkable promotion effect of hexafluoroisopropanol solvent is ascribed to the synergistic effect of H&#8208;bonding networks and C&#8722;H/&#960; interactions with substrates.

         <title>In Situ X&#8208;ray Diffraction Studies on the Reduction of V2O5 and WO3 by Using Hydrogen</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 17, March 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ X&#8208;ray powder diffraction was used to investigate the reduction of WO3 to WO2 and V2O5 to V2O3 under hydrogen gas with regard to intermediate oxides and bronzes as well as influence of the heating and hydrogen&#8208;flow rates.







Abstract
The reduction of metal oxides with hydrogen is widely used for the production of fine chemicals and metals both on the laboratory and industry scale. In situ methods can help to elucidate reaction pathways and to gain control over such synthesis reactions. In this study, the reduction of WO3 and V2O5 with hydrogen was investigated by in situ X&#8208;ray powder diffraction with regard to intermediates and the influence of heating rates and hydrogen flow rates. Mixtures of V4O9, V6O13 and VO2 in two modifications were identified as intermediates on the way to phase&#8208;pure V2O3. None of the intermediates occurs in a single phase and therefore cannot be prepared this way. In contrast, the intermediates of the WO3 reduction, H0.23WO3 and W10O29, appear consecutively and can be isolated. For both reactions, the heating and flow rates have little influence on the formation of intermediates.

         <title>Diastereoselective Synthesis of trans&#8208;anti&#8208;Hydrophenanthrenes via Ti&#8208;mediated Radical Cyclization and Total Synthesis of Kamebanin</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 17, March 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A diastereoselective synthesis of the functionalized trans&#8208;anti&#8208;hydrophenanthrenes via Ti&#8208;mediated reductive radical cyclization has been developed. This method enabled the convergent total synthesis of nebularilactone A and the first total synthesis of kamebanin via a novel formal semi&#8208;pinacol rearrangement reaction and an unprecedented Thorpe&#8208;Ziegler&#8208;type D&#8208;ring formation reaction.







Abstract
Ent&#8208;kaurenes consist of an ABC&#8208;ring based on a trans&#8208;anti&#8208;hydrophenanthrene skeleton and a D ring with an exomethylene. Highly oxygen&#8208;functionalized ent&#8208;kauren&#8208;15&#8208;ones have promising antiinflammatory pharmacological activity. In this study, we developed a novel diastereoselective synthesis of trans&#8208;anti&#8208;hydrophenanthrenes via a Ti&#8208;mediated reductive radical cyclization. We also demonstrated the applicability of this method by developing the first total synthesis of (&#177;)&#8208;kamebanin (longest linear sequence; 17&#8197;steps, overall yield; 6.5&#8201;%). Furthermore, this synthesis provided a formal semi&#8208;pinacol rearrangement for the construction of the quaternary carbon at C8 and a novel Thorpe&#8208;Ziegler&#8208;type reaction for the construction of the D&#8208;ring.

         <title>Reagent&#8208;Controlled Regioselective Intramolecular [2+2] Cycloaddition between Vinylsilanes and Allenes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 17, March 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unprecedented intramolecular [2+2] cycloaddition reaction between allenes and silicon&#8208;bearing olefins is presented. This is also the first example of the reagent&#8208;controlled regioselective [2+2] cycloaddition of allenes. The products in this work were oil compounds. The crystal sponge method was successfully used to determine their structures.







Abstract
This paper provides the first report of the intramolecular [2+2] cycloaddition of vinylsilane. The [2+2] cycloaddition of allenes is a useful reaction that can synthesize cyclobutanes. However, no previous works have attempted to control the regioselectivity between the two double bonds of allenes only by changing the reaction conditions, although there have been some reports of the regioselective [2+2] cycloaddition of allenes by changing the substrate. In this study, we have succeeded in controlling intramolecular [2+2] cycloaddition reactions at the proximal and distal positions of allenes simply by changing the reaction conditions. We found that the atomic radius of silicon is very important for perfect control of the reaction's sites. The structures of all key compounds were determined by the crystal sponge method which could identify the structures of liquid compounds.

         <title>Synthesis of a Bifunctionalized Glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) Anchor Useful for the Study of GPI Biology</title>

A bifunctional glycosylphosphatidylinositol derivative containing photoactivable and clickable groups was synthesized by a convergent strategy.







Abstract
A new, bifunctional glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) derivative containing the highly conserved core structure of all natural GPI anchors with a photoactivable diazirine in the lipid chain and clickable alkynes in the glycan was synthesized by a convergent [3+2] glycosylation strategy with late stage protecting group manipulation and regioselective phosphorylation. The challenges of this synthesis were due to the presence of several distinctive functional groups in the synthetic target, which complicated the protection tactics, in addition to the inherent difficulties associated with GPI synthesis. This bifunctional GPI derivative can cross&#8208;react with molecules in proximity upon photoactivation and be subsequently labeled with other molecular tags via click reaction. Therefore, it should be a valuable probe for biological studies of GPIs, such as analysis of GPI&#8208;interacting membrane proteins, and gaining insights into their functional mechanisms.

Toward D&#8208;A&#8208;based &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules: Fluorinated pentalene&#8208;1,4&#8208;dione (FPD), a strong electron&#8208;accepting unit was designed, and a derivative that contains a donor&#8208;acceptor&#8208;donor (D&#8722;A&#8722;D) conjugated molecule for use in organic semiconducting materials is reported. The compound was characterized based on its electrochemical properties, photophysical properties, and X&#8208;ray analyses to elucidate the structure&#8211;property relationships of the compounds.







Abstract
The development of electron&#8208;accepting units is of significant importance because the construction of donor (D)&#8208;acceptor (A) configurations is an effective strategy for tuning the electronic properties of &#960;&#8208;conjugated systems. Although doubly fused pentagons represented by diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) have been used as an effective electron&#8208;accepting unit, the relatively high&#8208;lying frontier molecular orbital levels (FMOs) leave room for further improvement. We report herein the synthesis of a fluorinated dihydropentalene&#8208;1,4&#8208;dione (FPD) derivative as a strong electron&#8208;accepting unit and the development of D&#8722;A&#8722;D &#960;&#8208;extended molecules. X&#8208;ray analyses revealed that the presence of fluorine atoms contributed to the formation of high planar structures and slipped&#8208;stacked packing. Electrochemical measurements indicated that the FPD derivatives showed relatively lower FMO energy levels than the corresponding DPP&#8208;containing derivatives. The D&#8722;A&#8722;D molecule based on terthiophene and FPD showed semiconducting responses. This study demonstrates that the FPD unit can function as a new acceptor unit for organic semiconductors.

         <title>Synthesis of Thioesters from Aldehydes via N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene (NHC) Catalyzed Radical Relay</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 17, March 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient reaction has been developed for thioesterification of aldehydes via radical relay by NHC catalysis. The key step is the coupling of the Breslow radical cation with the heteroatom radical (sulfur&#8208;radical). The excellent yields and broad substrate scope illustrated the efficiency of this strategy for achieving novel reactions via NHC catalysis.







Abstract
We have developed an efficient N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC)&#8208;catalyzed thioesterification of aldehydes using N&#8208;thiosuccinimides as the thiolation reagent. This organocatalyzed transition involves the generation of sulfur radicals by single electron transfer of the Breslow enolate (generated from aldehyde and NHC catalyst) with N&#8208;thiosuccinimides. This method offers facile access to various highly functionalized thioesters and exhibits good chemical yields and functional group tolerance.

         <title>High&#8208;Tc 1D Phase&#8208;Transition Semiconductor Photoluminescent Material with Broadband Emission</title>

An organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid perovskite photoelectric multifunctional material: [C7H13ONCH2F] PbBr3 (1) was successfully designed and synthesised. It realized the coupling of thermo&#8208;dielectric switching characteristics, semiconductor characteristics and photoluminescence characteristics of STE broadband emission.







Abstract
One dimensional (1D) organic&#8208;inorganic halide hybrid perovskites have the advantages of excellent organic cation modifiability and diversity of inorganic framework structures, which cannot be ignored in the development of multi&#8208;functional phase&#8208;transition materials in photoelectric and photovoltaic devices. Here, we have successfully modified and synthesized an organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid perovskite photoelectric multifunctional phase&#8208;transition material: [C7H13ONCH2F]&#8901;PbBr3 (1). The synergistic effect of the order double disorder transition of organic cations and the change of the degree of distortion of the inorganic framework leads to its high temperature reversible phase&#8208;transition point of Tc=374&#8197;K/346&#8197;K and its ultra&#8208;low loss high&#8208;quality dielectric switch response. Through in&#8208;depth research and calculation, compound 1 also has excellent semiconductor characteristics with a band gap of 3.06&#8197;eV and the photoluminescence characteristics of self&#8208;trapped exciton (STE) broadband emission. Undoubtedly, this modification strategy provides a new choice for the research field of organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid perovskite reversible phase&#8208;transition photoelectric multifunctional materials with rich coupling properties.

         <dc:description>
A new three&#8208;component procedure for the polychloromethylaminative synthesis of &#946;&#8208;polychloromethyl amines has been developed. With simple styrenes, polychloromethanes, and aromatic amines as substrates, saturated &#946;&#8208;dichloromethyl amines were isolated in moderate to good yields by using aryldiazonium salt as radical initiator.







Abstract
A copper&#8208;catalyzed three&#8208;component coupling reaction has been developed allowing the rapid building of valuable complex highly functionalized &#946;&#8208;polychloromethyl amines from simple styrenes, arylamines, and dichloromethane/chloroform. Using aryldiazonium salts as a radical initiator, a series of corresponding products are obtained with moderate to good yields under a carbon dioxide or nitrogen atmosphere (50&#8197;psi). In addition, good functional group tolerance can be observed.

         <title>Fast Motions Dominate Dynamics of Intrinsically Disordered Tau Protein at High Temperatures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 17, March 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reorientational dynamics of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) at low temperatures are composed of multiple components such as segmental motions and local conformational fluctuations. Temperature&#8208;dependent spectral density analysis of 15N&#8197;NMR relaxation rates demonstrates that local backbone and relaxation&#8208;active segmental chain dynamics of IDPs might merge into an effectively single dynamic component at sufficiently high temperatures.







Abstract
Reorientational dynamics of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) contain multiple motions often clustered around three motional modes: ultrafast librational motions of amide groups, fast local backbone conformational fluctuations and slow chain segmental motions. This dynamic picture is mainly based on 15N&#8197;NMR relaxation studies of IDPs at relatively low temperatures where the amide&#8208;water proton exchange rates are sufficiently small. Less is known, however, about the dynamics of IDPs at more physiological temperatures. Here, we investigate protein dynamics in a 441&#8208;residue long IDP, tau protein, in the temperature range from 0&#8211;25&#8201;&#176;C, using 15N&#8197;NMR relaxation rates and spectral density analysis. While at these temperatures relaxation rates are still better described in terms of amide group librational motions, local backbone dynamics and chain segmental motions, the temperature&#8208;dependent trend of spectral densities suggests that the timescales of fast backbone conformational fluctuations and slower chain segmental motions might become inseparable at higher temperatures. Our data demonstrate the remarkable dynamic plasticity of this prototypical IDP and highlight the need for dynamic studies of IDPs at multiple temperatures.

         <title>Fe&#8208;Catalyzed Aliphatic C&#8722;H Methylation of Glycine Derivatives and Peptides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 17, March 22, 2023. </description>

A concise strategy relying on multifunctional iron catalysis in the presence of di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl peroxide has been reported, allowing rapid and highly selective C(sp3)&#8722;H methylation of various glycine derivatives and peptides.







Abstract
Direct and selective C&#8722;H methylation is a powerful tool with which to install methyl groups into organic molecules, and is particularly useful in pharmaceutical chemistry. However, practical methods for such modification of biologically interesting targets have been rarely developed. We here report an iron&#8208;catalyzed C(sp3)&#8722;H methylation reaction of glycine derivatives, peptides and drug&#8208;like molecules in an alcohol in the presence of di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl peroxide. A readily available iron catalyst plays multiple roles in the transformation, which accelerates oxidation of C&#8722;N bonds to C=N double bonds, activates imine intermediates as Lewis acids by bidentate chelation, and at the same time facilitates cleavage of the peroxide to generate methyl radicals. A variety of methylated N&#8208;aryl glycine derivatives and peptides were obtained in good yield and with excellent chemo&#8208; and site&#8208;selectivity. This reaction is scalable, easily managed, and can be completed within 1&#8211;2&#8197;h. It features an economic, bio&#8208;friendly catalyst, a green solvent and low toxic reagents, and will provide effective access to precise C&#8722;H modification of biomolecules and natural products.

Travelling without moving: A Ferrier rearrangement/aza&#8208;Wacker cyclization on commercial glycals allows both a 3,4&#8208;cis amination at position three and a motion of the double bound restoring the glycal. Epoxidation/glycosylation of N&#8208;Ts 3&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;deoxygalactal provided disaccharide with high diastereoselectivity and yield, thus defining FAWEG (Ferrier/Aza&#8208;Wacker/Epoxidation/Glycosylation) as a new sequence to access 1,2&#8208;trans 3&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;deoxyglycosides.







Abstract
3&#8208;Amino&#8208;3&#8208;deoxyglycosides constitute an essential class of nitrogen&#8208;containing sugars. Among them, many important 3&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;deoxyglycosides possess a 1,2&#8208;trans relationship. In view of their numerous biological applications, the synthesis of 3&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;deoxyglycosyl donors giving rise to a 1,2&#8208;trans glycosidic linkage is thus an important challenge. Even though glycals are highly polyvalent donors, the synthesis and reactivity of 3&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;deoxyglycals have been little studied. In this work, we describe a new sequence, involving a Ferrier rearrangement and subsequent aza&#8208;Wacker cyclization that allows the rapid synthesis of orthogonally protected 3&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;deoxyglycals. Finally a 3&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;deoxygalactal derivative was submitted for the first time to an epoxidation/glycosylation with high yield and great diastereoselectivity, highlighting FAWEG (Ferrier/Aza&#8208;Wacker/Epoxidation/Glycosylation) as a new approach to access 1,2&#8208;trans 3&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;deoxyglycosides.

         <title>Three&#8208; and Five&#8208;Membered Anionic Chains of Pnictogenylboranes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 17, March 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three&#8208;membered chains of substituted anionic compounds composed of both boron and pnictogen (phosphorus and/or arsenic) atoms are synthesized from the reaction of pnictogenide salts with H2E&#8722;BH2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;NMe3 (E=P, As). Such compounds can be further reacted with H2E&#8722;BH2&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;NMe3 to form unprecedented five&#8208;membered anionic group 13/15 oligomers.







Abstract
An unprecedented family of three&#8208; and five&#8208;membered substituted anionic derivatives of parent pnictogenylboranes is herein reported. Reacting various combinations of the pnictogenylboranes H2E&#8242;&#8722;BH2&#8722;NMe3 (E&#8242;=P, As) with pnictogen&#8208;based nucleophiles MER1R2 (E=P, As; R1=H, R2=tBu; R1=R2=Ph; M=Na, K) allows for the isolation of the unsymmetrical products [Na(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)][H2E&#8242;&#8722;BH2&#8722;EHtBu] (3: E=E&#8242;=P; 4: E=E&#8242;=As; 5: E=As, E&#8242;=P) and [M(C)][H2E&#8242;&#8722;BH2&#8722;EPh2] (7: E=E&#8242;=P, M=Na, C=18&#8208;crown&#8208;6; 8: E=E&#8242;=As; M=K, C=[2.2.2]cryptand; 9: E=P, E&#8242;=As, M=Na, C=[2.2.2]cryptand; 10: E=As, E&#8242;=P, M=K, C=[2.2.2]cryptand). [Na(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)][H2As&#8722;BH2&#8208;tBuPH&#8722;BH3] (6) is only accessible by a different pathway, using tBuPH2, BH3&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;SMe2 and NaNH2 as starting materials. Additionally, the synthesis of symmetrical diphenyl&#8208;substituted compounds [M(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)][Ph2E&#8722;BH2&#8722;EPh2] (11: E=P, M=Na; 12: E=As, M=K) is reported which can be regarded as isostructural inorganic, negatively charged analogs of dppm (1,1&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)methane) and dpam (1,1&#8208;bis(diphenylarsino)methane). Furthermore, an elongation of the pnictogen boron backbone in compounds 3, 7 and 9&#8242; (similar compound to 9, stabilized however by 18&#8208;crown&#8208;6), is attainable by reacting them with the pnictogenylboranes H2E&#8242;&#8722;BH2&#8722;NMe3 leading to corresponding five&#8208;membered chain&#8208;like compounds [Na(18&#8208;crown&#8208;6)][H2E&#8722;BH2&#8722;R1R2P&#8722;BH2&#8722;E&#8242;H2] (E=E&#8242;=P, R1=H, R2=tBu (13); E=E&#8242;=P, R1=R2=Ph (14); E=E&#8242;=As, R1=R2=Ph (15); E=P, E&#8242;=As, R1=R2=Ph (16)). Finally, the thermodynamics of the reaction pathways were evaluated by quantum chemical computations.

         <title>Recognizing the Minimum Structural Units Driving the Crystallization of SAPO&#8208;34 in a Top&#8208;Down Process</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 17, March 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A top&#8208;down synthesis system was designed to study the crystallization of SAPO&#8208;34. Based on characterizations on a clear precursor solution with abundant nuclei and designed synthesis experiments, it was demonstrated that the formation of small species containing Si&#8722;O&#8722;Al bonds is crucial for driving the crystallization of SAPO&#8208;34, rather than structural units with specific spatial conformation.







Abstract
Recognizing the structure and nature of the nuclei for zeolites crystallization on an atomic level is of great importance, which can provide guidance on the control of crystallization kinetics and the rational synthesis of zeolites. However, it remains a long&#8208;standing challenge due to the difficulty in characterization of amorphous precursor with limited crystal nuclei. Herein, a top&#8208;down synthesis system was designed for SAPO&#8208;34 molecular sieve and well investigated. A clear precursor solution with abundant SAPO&#8208;34 crystal nuclei was obtained under a depolymerization&#8208;dominant condition. The species in the liquid precursor were identified by FT&#8208;ICR MS, solid&#8208;state MAS NMR and atomic pair distribution function analyses. In combination with various designed experiments, it is revealed that both the formation of small species containing Si&#8722;O&#8722;Al bonds and reaching a certain concentration, is crucial for driving the crystallization of SAPO&#8208;34, rather than structural units with specific spatial conformation. This work provides an important understanding on the (pre)nucleation of SAPO&#8208;34 and sheds light on the synthesis control of SAPO molecular sieves.

         <title>On&#8208;Demand Release of Secondary Amine Bases for the Activation of Catalysts and Crosslinkers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 17, March 22, 2023. </description>

Apart from their properties as self&#8208;healing materials, DCv ureas can be applied as starting points for triggered reaction cascades. Input such as heat and water can release free base on demand. We apply this release system for the deprotection of a latent organocatalyst to catalyse acylhydrazone formation as well as for on&#8208;demand gelation.







Abstract
Dynamic covalent (DCv) ureas have been used abundantly to design self&#8208;healing materials. We demonstrate that apart from self&#8208;healing materials, the species present in the equilibrium of DCv ureas can be employed as responsive organocatalysts. Easily controllable stimuli like heat or addition of water shift the equilibrium towards isocyanate and free base which can function as an in situ released reagent. We demonstrate this application of DCv ureas with two examples. Firstly, we use the liberated base to catalytically activate a latent organocatalyst for acylhydrazone formation. Secondly, this base can be employed in an equimolar manner to trigger the release of nitrile&#8208;N&#8208;oxides from chlorooximes, which react with acrylate&#8208;terminated polymers to form an isoxazoline polymer gel.

Collaborative work: The synthesis of a new monoboranyl ligand scaffold is described. This ambiphilic diphosphine allows for the cooperative coordination of organonitriles in partnership with nickel(0).







Abstract
Metal&#8208;ligand cooperation has emerged as a versatile tool for substrate activation in chemical reactivity. Herein, we provide the synthesis and characterization of a monoboranyl&#8208;containing analogue of the ubiquitous bulky diphosphine ligand, 1,2&#8208;bis(di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphosphino)ethane, whose reactivity has been examined using nickel. Together, the pairing of nickel and boron provides a platform that allows for the cooperative coordination of organonitriles, giving unusual examples of intermolecularly bound dinickelacycles.

         <title>Highly Fluorescent Supramolecular Nanoring Composed of Bent&#8208;Shaped Cyanostilbene Derivatives and Cucurbit[8]urils</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 17, March 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we materialized zero dimensional supramolecular organic framework with enhanced emission. We designed bent&#8208;shape guest molecule by novel backbone &#8220;cyanostilbene&#8221;. This unique bent&#8208;shape molecule only emitted enhanced fluorescence with cucurbit[8]uril (CB[8]) as a host in water. This nano&#8208;confined emissive molecule also formed homogeneous system without bundling at the high concentration when it became complex with CB[8].







Abstract
Supramolecular organic frameworks (SOFs) made of organic guest molecule and cucurbit[8]uril (CB[8]) in aqueous solution have great potential for diverse applications. Herein, we designed highly fluorescent zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) nano&#8208;ring SOF with CB[8] as a host and novel bent&#8208;shaped cyanostilbene guest. This host&#8211;guest complex successfully formed macrocyclic hexamer and showed significantly enhanced fluorescence (&#934;F=68&#8201;%) compared to non&#8208;assembled monomer (&#934;F=2&#8201;%). Unlike other SOFs, this 0D SOF could be dispersed uniformly without bundling phenomenon in water.

         <title>Trace Explosive Detection Based on Photonic Crystal Amplified Fluorescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 17, March 22, 2023. </description>

Trace TNT detection enabled by the amplification effect of photonic crystal on fluorescence signals is achieved. The photonic crystal&#8208;based sensor chips can sense trace explosive TNT in different environments, including air, environmental wastewater, and contaminated soil.







Abstract
With increasing demand for public security and environmental protection, it is highly desirable to develop strategies to identify trace explosives (e.&#8201;g., 2,4,6&#8208;trinitrotoluene (TNT)). Herein, we report novel photonic crystal (PC)&#8208;based sensor chips for trace TNT detection by using amplification effect of PCs on fluorescence (FL) signals. The sensor chips are constructed by integrating silica nanoparticles (NPs) modified with (3&#8208;aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (APTES) and fluorescein isothiocyanate isomer (FITC) and PC substrates. The amino groups on FITC&#8208;APTES&#8208;silica NPs can specifically bind with TNT molecules to form Meisenheimer complexes and strongly quench the FL signal of neighboring fluorophores FITC through F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer. PCs with matched PBG can amplify the FL signal of FITC&#8208;APTES&#8208;silica NPs about 24.4&#8208;fold and significantly improve sensitivity and resolution of trace TNT detection with the limit of detection of 0.23&#8197;nM. The PC&#8208;based sensor chips are stable, sensitive, and reliable TNT sensing platforms, showing great potential in homeland safety and environmental protection.

         <title>Phosphorus&#8208;Boron Multiple Bonding in the &#960; Radical HBP</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 17, March 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The multiply bonded &#960; radical HBP has been generated and characterized for the first time. Bonding analysis suggest that it differs from the isovalent HNB since the unpaired electron occupies one of the doubly degenerate &#960; bonding MOs, resulting in a B&#8722;P bond order of two and half.







Abstract
The HBP radical was generated via the reaction of laser ablated boron atom with PH3 in a solid neon matrix, which is identified via IR spectroscopy with isotopic substitutions and quantum chemical calculations. The results show that HBP has a 2&#928; electronic ground state with a short B&#8722;P bond. Bonding analysis indicates that besides an electron&#8208;sharing &#963; bond, there are two degenerate &#960; bonding orbitals that are occupied by three electrons, resulting in a bond order of two and half between P and B. This is in sharp contrast to the bonding properties of the isovalent HNB, which was characterized to be a N&#8801;B triply bonded &#963; radical with the unpaired electron locating on the B atom.

         <title>Chromatic Selectivity of Coumarin&#8208;Caged Oligonucleotides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 17, March 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of green&#8208;light activatable DCCM photo&#8208;tethers allows efficient photocaging of oligonucleotides. In addition, DCCM can be used in combination with conventional blue&#8208;light absorbing DEACM to build an &#8220;orthogonal&#8221; system. It was suggested to rather use the term &#8220;chromatic selectivity&#8221; for which the necessary equations were provided. These showed that chromatic selectivity can even be adjusted by careful choice of starting material.







Abstract
A system of two coumarin&#8208;based caging groups is presented &#8211; one absorbing in the blue (400&#8211;450&#8197;nm) and the other absorbing in the green (480&#8211;550&#8197;nm) part of the visible spectrum. Together they form a pair, which allows to selectively photoactivate the one or the other in oligonucleotides. A numerical characterization defining the term &#8220;chromatic selectivity&#8221; was proposed, and it was shown how chromatically selective uncaging can literally be titrated in a kinetic reaction scheme.

Abstract
A series of hitherto unknown 5,14&#8208;diphenylbenzo[j]naphtho[2,1,8&#8208;def][2,7]phenanthrolines, containing a 5&#8208;azatetracene and a 2&#8208;azapyrene subunit, were prepared by combination of Pd&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;coupling reactions with a one&#8208;pot Povarov/cycloisomerization reaction. In the final key step four new bonds are formed in one step. The synthetic approach allows for a high degree of diversification of the heterocyclic core structure. The optical and electrochemical properties were studied experimentally and by DFT/TD&#8208;DFT and NICS calculations. Due to the presence of the 2&#8208;azapyrene subunit, the typical electronic nature and characteristics of the 5&#8208;azatetracene moiety are lost and the compounds are electronically and optically more related to 2&#8208;azapyrenes.

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Piezochromism from an o&#8208;Carborane Dyad: Boron Clusters Facilitating a Wide&#8208;Range Redshift and High Sensitivity</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 17, March 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spherical boron cluster. An o&#8208;carborane dyad (MTCb) with a D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A architecture was developed as a high&#8208;sensitivity piezochromic material. Compared to the carborane&#8208;free MTY, the o&#8208;carborane dyad MTCb showed a larger emission wavelength difference of 131&#8197;nm and a higher sensitivity of 32.8&#8197;nm&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;GPa&#8722;1, resulting from the presence of icosahedral boron clusters.







Abstract
Piezochromic materials, which exhibit a fluorescence response with large emission spectral shifts and high sensitivity, may be useful in important applications, but there have been few reports of such organic luminophores. Herein, we report a new high&#8208;sensitivity piezochromic material based on the incorporation of an o&#8208;carborane unit, which exhibits aggregation&#8208;induced emission properties. In a high&#8208;pressure experiment, compared to carborane&#8208;free MTY, which exhibits an emission spectral shift of 75&#8197;nm and a sensitivity of 19.1&#8197;nm&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;GPa&#8722;1, the o&#8208;carborane dyad MTCb shows a larger emission wavelength difference of 131&#8197;nm and a higher sensitivity of 32.8&#8197;nm&#8201;&#8901;&#8201;GPa&#8722;1, demonstrating a performance that ranks among the best of organic piezochromic materials reported thus far. MTCb molecules adopt a J&#8208;aggregated pattern and have relatively loose molecular packing in the crystalline state. Interestingly, nonconjugated spherical carborane can disrupt the &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions between adjacent molecules during compression, which results in excellent piezochromic performance.

Interestingly, nonconjugated spherical carborane can disrupt the &#960;-&#960; interactions between adjacent molecules during compression, which results in excellent piezochromic performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>PtSnBi Nanoplates Enable Photoacoustic Imaging&#8208;Guided Highly Efficient Photothermal Tumor Ablation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 17, March 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two&#8208;dimensional intermetallic PtSnBi nanoplates were constructed as a novel photothermal agent with a high photothermal conversion efficiency of 61&#8201;% upon 808&#8208;nm laser irradiation. The application of PtSnBi nanoplates for photothermal cancer therapy both in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo was successfully carried out, suggesting that PtSnBi nanoplates have great promise in cancer theranostics.







Abstract
The development of photothermal agents (PTAs) with robust photostability and high photothermal conversion efficiency is of great importance for cancer photothermal therapy. Herein, a novel PTA was created using two&#8208;dimensional intermetallic PtSnBi nanoplates (NPs), which demonstrated excellent photostability and biocompatibility with a high photothermal conversion efficiency of &#8764;61&#8201;% after PEGylation. More importantly, PtSnBi NPs could be employed as photoacoustic imaging contrast agents for tumor visualization due to their strong absorbance in the NIR range. In addition, both in&#8197;vitro and in&#8197;vivo experiments confirmed that PtSnBi NPs had a good photothermal efficacy under NIR laser irradiation. Therefore, the remarkable therapeutic characteristics of PtSnBi NPs make them a most promising candidate for cancer theranostics.

         <title>Cover Feature: In Situ X&#8208;ray Diffraction Studies on the Reduction of V2O5 and WO3 by Using Hydrogen (Chem. Eur. J. 17/2023)</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 17, March 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reduction of V2O5 and WO3 with hydrogen, the latter of which is performed industrially in rotary kilns under a hydrogen countercurrent, has been investigated by using in&#8197;situ X&#8208;ray powder diffraction. This method yields insights into the processes illustrated by the transparent section of the furnace, thus gaining information about the reaction pathways as well as compositions and structures of intermediates. More information can be found in the Research Article by H. Kohlmann and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202203932).

Travelling without moving. A Ferrier rearrangement on commercial glycals brings the double bond from position 1,2 to 2,3. Subsequent Aza&#8208;Wacker reaction allows both a 3,4&#8208;cis amination at position 3 and movement of the double bond restoring the glycal. These motions, reminiscent of a swing, enable the synthesis of 3&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;deoxyglycals. Epoxidation/Glycosylation of 3&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;deoxygalactal derivative provide a disaccharide with high yield, defining &#8220;FAWEG&#8221; as a new sequence to access 1,2&#8208;trans 3&#8208;amino&#8208;3&#8208;deoxyglycosides.

A schematic diagram reflects the strong electron affinity of the fluorinated dihydropentalene&#8208;1,4&#8208;dione (FPD) structure, in which the electron&#8208;rich nitrogen&#8208;containing amino group in the diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) skeleton is replaced by a very strongly electronegative CF2 unit. Moreover, the FPD molecule, which exhibits stronger accepting characteristics, has stronger affinity against electrons than the DPP molecule. More information can be found in the Research Article by S. Yokoyama and Y. Ie (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202203873).

         <title>Oxychalcogenides: A Promising Class of Materials for Nonlinear Optical Crystals with Mixed&#8208;Anion Groups</title>

The best of all worlds: Oxychalcogenides, promising IR NLO materials candidates, can integrate the property superiority of different anion groups, for example, the strong SHG response and wide IR transmission of metal chalcogenides and the large band gap and high laser damage threshold of oxides.







Abstract
Infrared nonlinear optical (IR NLO) materials are of great significance in the development of IR laser technology. But rationally designing high&#8208;performance IR NLO materials remains a huge challenge due to the conflict between the necessary properties required for NLO materials. Notably, oxychalcogenides with mixed&#8208;anion groups have drawn extensive interest as a family of important IR NLO candidates because they integrate the property advantages of oxides and chalcogenides by chemical substitution engineering. In this review, we provide a survey of reported oxychalcogenides and aim to present the development of NLO oxychalcogenides from the perspective of rational design of their structural chemistry. Furthermore, we focus on the relationships between partial substitution and structural symmetry as well as optical properties. These provide some helpful guidance for the further exploration and design of novel oxychalcogenide materials with excellent NLO performance in the future.

         <title>Covalent Triazine Frameworks (CTFs): Synthesis, Crystallization, and Photocatalytic Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Volume 29, Issue 17, March 22, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent Triazine Frameworks have received great attention as an attractive photocatalyst owing to their unique structure characteristics. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the CTFs&#8217; synthetic methods, crystallization, and applications for photocatalytic water splitting. The perspectives and challenges of fabricating high crystalline CTFs and designing CTFs with excellent photocatalytic performance are also discussed.







Abstract
Covalent Triazine Frameworks (CTFs) have received great attention from academia owing to their unique structure characteristics such as nitrogen&#8208;rich structure, chemical stability, fully conjugated skeleton and high surface area; all these unique properties make CTFs attractive for widespread applications, especially for photocatalytic applications. In this review, we aim to provide recent advances in the CTFs preparation, and mainly focus on their photocatalytic applications. This review provides a comprehensive and systematic overview of the CTFs&#8217; synthetic methods, crystallinity lifting strategies, and their applications for photocatalytic water splitting. Firstly, a brief background including the photocatalytic water splitting and crystallinity are provided. Then, synthetic methods related to CTFs and the strategies for enhancing the crystallinity are summarized and compared. After that, the general photocatalytic mechanism and the strategies to improve the photocatalytic performance of CTFs are discussed. Finally, the perspectives and challenges of fabricating high crystalline CTFs and designing CTFs with excellent photocatalytic performance are discussed, inspiring the development of CTF materials in photocatalytic applications.

         <title>Biohybrid Microswimmers for Antibiotic Drug Delivery Based on a Thiol&#8208;Sensitive Release Platform</title>

Green kills. Antibiotic&#8208;loaded microswimmers kill bacteria after being triggered by a chemical stimulus. The design was based on thiol&#8208;responsive self&#8208;immolative linkers, vancomycin, and green algae as natural microbots.







Abstract
This study reports on the design and engineering of biohybrid microswimmers exploiting a thiol&#8208;mediated self&#8208;immolative antibiotic release strategy. The design features a covalent attachment of a vancomycin conjugate via a disulfide&#8208;based linker to the surface of the microalgae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. The antibiotic release from the surface of these biohybrids was triggered by the addition of a thiol&#8208;based reducing agent, and, subsequently, the inhibition of bacterial growth was observed for Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus. These engineered microbots represent the first example of a microalgae&#8208;based drug delivery system with a thiol&#8208;mediated, reductive release of an antibiotic drug.

         <title>Direct Construction of Corrole&#8208;Peptide Conjugates by Controllable Bilane Formation on Resin</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solid&#8208;phase peptide synthesis: An efficient and practical protocol is reported to functionalize peptides by corrole motifs without using prepared corrole building blocks. The synthesized corrole&#8208;peptide conjugates displayed their multifunctionality for metal chelating, aggregation, as well as targeted imaging.







Abstract
Corroles have attracted increasing research interests in recent decades owing to their unique properties over porphyrins. However, the relatively inefficient and tedious synthetic procedures of corrole building blocks with functional groups for bioconjugation hindered their bioapplications. Herein, we report a highly efficient protocol to synthesize corrole&#8208;peptide conjugates with good yields (up to 63&#8201;%) without using prepared corrole building blocks. By condensing two &#8722;COOH&#8208;bearing&#8208;dipyrromethane molecules onto an aldehyde group on resin&#8208;bound peptide chains in a controllable manner, a series of desired products with long (up to 25&#8197;residues) and bioactive peptide chains were obtained with at most one chromatographic purification. The synthesized compounds exhibited potential applications as chelators for metal ions for biomedical applications, as building blocks for supramolecular materials, as well as targeted fluorescent probes.

&lt;p&gt;Corroles have attracted increasing research interests in recent decades owing to their unique properties over porphyrins. However, the relatively inefficient and tedious synthetic procedures of corrole building blocks with functional groups for bioconjugation hindered their bioapplications. Herein, we report a highly efficient protocol to synthesize corrole-peptide conjugates with good yields (up to 63&#8201;%) without using prepared corrole building blocks. By condensing two &#8722;COOH-bearing-dipyrromethane molecules onto an aldehyde group on resin-bound peptide chains in a controllable manner, a series of desired products with long (up to 25&#8197;residues) and bioactive peptide chains were obtained with at most one chromatographic purification. The synthesized compounds exhibited potential applications as chelators for metal ions for biomedical applications, as building blocks for supramolecular materials, as well as targeted fluorescent probes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

A computational study of copper corroles adsorbed onto graphene by DFT methods explored the stability, electronic structure, and magnetic properties of these complexes highlighting the augmented magnetic response accompanied with spin transfer toward graphene after adsorption.







Abstract
Non&#8208;covalent hybrid materials based on graphene and A3&#8208;type copper corrole complexes were computationally investigated. The corroles complexes contain strong electron&#8208;withdrawing fluorinated substituents at the meso positions. Our results show that the non&#8208;innocent character of corrole moiety modulates the structural, electronic, and magnetic properties once the hybrid systems are held. The graphene&#8208;corrole hybrids displayed outstanding stability via the interplay of dispersion and electrostatic driving forces, while graphene act as an electron reservoir. The hybrid structures exposed an intriguing magneto&#8208;chemical performance, compared to the isolated counterparts, that evidenced how structural and electronic effects contributed to the magnetic response for both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic cases. Directional spin polarization and spin transfer from the corrole to the graphene surface participate in the amplification. Finally, there are relations between the spin transfer, the magnetic response, and the copper distorted ligand field, offering exciting hints about modulating the magnetic response. Therefore, this work shows that copper corroles emerged as versatile building blocks for graphene hybrid materials, especially in applications requiring a magnetic response.

         <title>Access to Amide&#8208;Linked Organic Cages by in&#8197;situ Trapping of Metastable Imine Assemblies: Solution Phase Bisamine Recognition</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The majority of shape&#8208;persistent self&#8208;assembled organic cages are accessed via precipitation and studied in the solid state. Herein, we show that metastable imine cages (unsuitable for precipitation) can be trapped directly by in&#8197;situ Pinnick oxidation conditions, yielding soluble, robust amide cages. Unlike the by&#8208;passed imine cages, the resulting cages are tolerant of hydrolysis conditions to unmask internal carboxylic acids, which undergo 2&#8208;point binding with amines (unsuitable guests for imine cages).







Abstract
Molecular cages are sought after as receptors and catalysts. However, typical dynamic covalent chemistry approaches restrict the shape&#8208;persistence, solubility and stability of self&#8208;assembled organic cages. As a result, organic cages occupy a narrow chemical and functional space, and solution&#8208;phase applications and studies remain rare. We report an in&#8197;situ trapping protocol, using Pinnick oxidation conditions, to convert soluble metastable imine assemblies to robust amide cages, and exemplify the method to access previously inaccessible organic cages. The new cages are internally functionalised with two constrained and diametrically opposed carboxylic acid groups that can distinguish between functionalised piperazines in THF. We anticipate our approach will broaden access to robust, soluble, self&#8208;assembled organic cages of an unsymmetrical or semi&#8208;flexible nature, which in turn will drive advances in solution&#8208;phase applications of molecular cages.

         <title>The Boekelheide Rearrangement of Pyrimidine N&#8208;oxides as a Case Study of Closed or Open Shell Reactions &#8208; Experimental and Computational Evidence for the Participation of Radical Intermediates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heterocycles: The rearrangement of a model pyrimidine N&#8208;oxide with carboxylic acid anhydrides provides the acyloxymethyl&#8208;substituted compounds as major products. In addition, other compounds derived from radical intermediates are formed in considerable amounts under certain conditions. By comprehensive experimental and quantum&#8208;chemical calculations, a rationale for the apparently competing mechanisms is proposed. The pathways via closed shell and open shell intermediates are compared.







Abstract
In a case study, the acetic anhydride&#8208;promoted reaction of a model pyrimidine N&#8208;oxide to the corresponding 4&#8208;acetoxymethyl&#8208;substituted pyrimidine derivative (Boekelheide rearrangement) was investigated in detail by experiment and quantum chemical calculations. The reaction conditions were varied and several side products formed in low to moderate yields were identified. These experiments indicate that a (pyrimidin&#8208;4&#8208;yl)methyl radical is one of the key species of the rearrangement. This interpretation was supported by the fact that rearrangements performed in solvents which can easily lose hydrogen atoms, afford considerable quantities of products incorporating the solvent. With TEMPO the key radical could be trapped. Other carboxylic acid anhydrides confirm the conclusion that the Boekelheide rearrangement of the model pyrimidine N&#8208;oxide proceeds, at least in part, via radical intermediates. The high level closed and open shell quantum chemical calculations show that concerted [3,3]&#8208;sigmatropic rearrangements or stepwise processes, either via ion pairs or via radicals, are energetically feasible.

         <title>Redox Assisted Reversible Aromaticity Transition Between 30&#960; H&#252;ckel and 28&#960; M&#246;bius Dication of a Core&#8208;Modified Isophlorinoid</title>

         <dc:description>
Unwavering Aromaticity: Aromatic and redox property of an expanded isophlorinoid has been significantly modified by varying the heteroatoms in the core of a 30&#960; macrocycle. A reversible transition between H&#252;ckel and M&#246;bius topology without loss aromaticity has been accomplished by two&#8208;electron ring oxidation of a H&#252;ckel 30&#960; core&#8208;modified isophlorinoid. The stable 28&#960; dication represents a novel example of a charged M&#246;bius aromatic annulene.







Abstract
The electronic properties of a hexaphyrin was fine&#8208;tuned via core&#8208;modification leading to the formation of a H&#252;ckel aromatic 30&#960; hexaphyrin which incorporates two pyrrole and four furan rings in the &#960;&#8208;conjugated pathway. This H&#252;ckel aromatic hexaphyrin modified its conformation upon two&#8208;electron ring oxidation either with triflic acid or Meerwein salt [Et3O]+[SbCl6]&#8722; to yield 28&#960; M&#246;bius aromatic dication species. Reversible aromatic transition was established by spectroscopic techniques and further supported by quantum chemical calculations.

         <title>Double Addition vs. Ring Closure: Systematic Reactivity Study of CO(NCO)2 and CO(NCS)2 towards Hydrogen Halides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbonyl diisocyanate, CO(NCO)2, and carbonyl diisothiocyanate, CO(NCS)2, react differently with hydrogen halides HF, HCl, HBr and HI: Whereas carbonyl diisocyanate adds two equivalents thus forming carbonyl bis(carbamoylhalides), carbonyl diisothiocyanate only adds one equivalent and undergoes intramolecular ring closure, resulting in the formation of substituted thiadiazines.







Abstract
The reactivity of carbonyl diisocyanate, CO(NCO)2, and carbonyl diisothiocyanate, CO(NCS)2 with nucleophiles shows different patterns: Whereas carbonyl diisocyanate adds two equivalents of nucleophile forming carbonyl bis(carbamoylhalides), carbonyl diisothiocyanate only adds one equivalent and undergoes intramolecular ring closure, resulting in the formation of substituted thiadiazines. In this study we have reacted both carbonyl diisocyanate and carbonyl diisothiocyanate with the full series of hydrogen halides HF to HI, isolating carbonyl bis(carbamoylfluoride) (1), &#8208;chloride (2), &#8208;bromide (3), and &#8208;iodide (4) as well as (6&#8208;chloro&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2&#8208;thioxo&#8208;4H&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;thiadiazin&#8208;4&#8208;one (5), and 6&#8208;bromo&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;2&#8208;thioxo&#8208;4H&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;thiadiazin&#8208;4&#8208;one (6). The compounds were analysed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, NMR spectroscopy, IR and Raman spectroscopy, and elemental analysis. Quantum mechanical calculations show thermodynamic reasons for the differences in reactivity.

&lt;p&gt;The reactivity of carbonyl diisocyanate, CO(NCO)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and carbonyl diisothiocyanate, CO(NCS)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with nucleophiles shows different patterns: Whereas carbonyl diisocyanate adds two equivalents of nucleophile forming carbonyl bis(carbamoylhalides), carbonyl diisothiocyanate only adds one equivalent and undergoes intramolecular ring closure, resulting in the formation of substituted thiadiazines. In this study we have reacted both carbonyl diisocyanate and carbonyl diisothiocyanate with the full series of hydrogen halides HF to HI, isolating carbonyl bis(carbamoylfluoride) (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;), -chloride (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;), -bromide (&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;), and -iodide (&lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;) as well as (6-chloro-2,3-dihydro-2-thioxo-4&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-1,3,5-thiadiazin-4-one (&lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt;), and 6-bromo-2,3-dihydro-2-thioxo-4&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-1,3,5-thiadiazin-4-one (&lt;b&gt;6&lt;/b&gt;). The compounds were analysed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction, NMR spectroscopy, IR and Raman spectroscopy, and elemental analysis. Quantum mechanical calculations show thermodynamic reasons for the differences in reactivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Challenges and Strategies of Anion Exchange Membranes in Hydrogen&#8208;electricity Energy Conversion Devices</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The challenges and corresponding strategies of anion exchange membranes are summarized to provide valuable predictions for the advancement of hydrogen&#8208;electricity energy conversion devices, including anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer and anion exchange membrane fuel cell. Discussion is focused on membrane key properties (anion conductivity, long&#8208;term stability) and device applications (membrane&#8208;electrode interface, carbonation effect, water management).







Abstract
Alkaline hydrogen&#8208;electricity energy conversion technologies, involving anion exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs) and anion exchange membrane water electrolyzers (AEMWEs) are more appealing than the acidic counterparts due to the elimination of precious metal catalysts. However, the physicochemical properties of anion exchange membrane (AEMs), i.e., ionic conductivity, mechanical strength, stability, etc., are inferior to that of proton exchange membranes (PEMs), thus hindering these alkaline technologies from practical employment. To promote their development, we summarize the main challenges and the corresponding strategies of AEMs for the application of AEMFCs and AEMWEs in this review. The hydroxide transportation mechanism, ion exchange capacity, hydration and microscopic morphology that are relevant to the ionic conductivity are discussed firstly. Following the ionic conductivity, another obstacle, stability of AEMs is comprehensively described in terms of alkaline stability, mechanical stability and electrochemical stability. Upon integrating into the devices, water management, carbonation effect and membrane&#8208;electrode interface that are critical to the cell performance are highlighted as well. This review is anticipated to provide insights into the AEM design for hydrogen&#8208;electric energy conversion devices, thus accelerating the widespread commercialization of these promising technologies.

         <title>Design of Aurone&#8208;Based Dual&#8208;State Emissive (DSE) Fluorophores</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aurone derivatives were introduced as easily accessible dual&#8208;state emissive (DSE) fluorophores along with the description of molecular design principles. Facile one&#8208;step synthesis in combination with biological activities make DSE aurones unique tool for biomedical applications.







Abstract
The development of dual&#8208;state emissive (DSE) fluorophores, i.&#8201;e. organic molecules showing balanced emission in both solution and as molecular solids, has recently become an emerging approach in material science, biology, sensing, and optoelectronics. However, the majority of existing DSE fluorophores represents structural modifications of the scaffolds known for their aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) properties, e.&#8201;g., tetraphenylethylenes (TFE), triphenylamines (TFA), and others. In this study, we introduce aurones as an easily accessible scaffold for the construction of DSE fluorophores and describe the main design principles allowing to achieve the balanced emission in both solution and solid state. Herein, we present the solid&#8208;state fluorescence in a systematic series of aurone derivatives for the first time. We propose that the newly found DSE properties of aurones in combination with their established biological activity can be applied efficiently in biomedical studies and diagnostic tools.

         <title>Thermally Activated vs. Photochemical Hydrogen Evolution Reactions&#8211;A Tale of Three Metals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
All roads lead to hydrogen. an in&#8208;depth analysis and comparison of hydrogen evolution reactions in gas phase model systems reveal five distinct mechanistic routes to form either atomic or molecular hydrogen.







Abstract
Molecular processes behind hydrogen evolution reactions can be quite complex. In macroscopic electrochemical cells, it is extremely difficult to elucidate and understand their mechanism. Gas phase models, consisting of a metal ion and a small number of water molecules, provide unique opportunities to understand the reaction pathways in great detail. Hydrogen evolution in clusters consisting of a singly charged metal ion and one to on the order of 50 water molecules has been studied extensively for magnesium, aluminum and vanadium. Such clusters with around 10&#8211;20 water molecules are known to eliminate atomic or molecular hydrogen upon mild activation by room temperature black&#8208;body radiation. Irradiation with ultraviolet light, by contrast, enables hydrogen evolution already with a single water molecule. Here, we analyze and compare the reaction mechanisms for hydrogen evolution on the ground state as well as excited state potential energy surfaces. Five distinct mechanisms for evolution of atomic or molecular hydrogen are identified and characterized.

         <title>Nanopore Deciphering Single Digital Polymers Towards High&#8208;Density Data Storage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The emerging nanopore techniques have been validated as the promising low&#8208;cost analytical and sequencing methods towards practical applications of high&#8208;density polymer data storage. This concept discusses the nanopore&#8208;based data storage systems based on polymer sequences and DNA nanostructures, and highlights the advances in nanopore processing and decoding of information stored in man&#8208;made polymers containing unnatural monomer units.







Abstract
Sequence&#8208;defined polymer is one of the most promising alternative media for high&#8208;density data storage. It could be used to alleviate the problem of insufficient storage capacity of conventional silicon&#8208;based devices for the explosively increasing data. To fulfil the goal of polymer data storage, suitable methods should be developed to accurately read and decode the information&#8208;containing polymers, especially for those composed by a combination of the natural and unnatural monomers. Nanopore&#8208;based approaches have become one of the most competitive analysis and sequencing techniques, which are expected to read both natural and synthetic polymers with single&#8208;molecule precision and monomeric resolution. Herein, this work emphasizes the advances being made in nanopore reading and decoding of information stored in the man&#8208;made polymers and DNA nanostructures, and discusses the challenges and opportunities towards the development and realization of high&#8208;density data storage.

         <title>Redox&#8208;Active Lewis Pairs Yield Diradicaloids and Enable Modular Control of the Diradical Character</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diradicaloid silicon oxolene salts are accessed through Lewis acid&#8208;base pairing of bis(catecholato)silanes with salts of dihydroxybenzoquinone. The features of the catecholates and the dihydroxybenzoquinone linker (electron donor or acceptor ability) control the diradical character of the adducts in a rational way.







Abstract
Stable metal&#8208;free diradicaloids are fascinating compounds, typically based on covalent polycyclic or nitrogen&#8208;containing &#960;&#8208;conjugated frameworks. Unfortunately, their preparation and the modulation of their diradical character require substantial synthetic efforts. The present work introduces a synthetic approach to diradicaloids by the ease and modularity of Lewis pair formation. Binding redox&#8208;active bis(catecholato)silane Lewis acids to ditopic tetraoxolene Lewis bases yields adducts with varying spin ground states. Computational analyses disclose that the diradical character increases with the electron donor ability of the catechols and the electron accepting ability of the tetraoxolene. Hence, this protocol grants access to diradicaloids with rationally adjustable diradical character of high potential for numerous applications in a single step.

         <title>X&#8208;Ray Study of Cembranoids with Flexible Rings from&#160;Boswellia papyrifera&#160;Resins Allowing Structural Revisions of Misleading Structures in the Past 70 Years</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>30 new highly oxygenated and stereogenic 14&#8208;membered macrocyclic diterpenoids, papyrifuranols A&#8722;Z (1&#8722;26) and AA&#8722;AD (27&#8722;30), and 8 known analogs were isolated from Boswellia papyrifera resins. All the structures were characterized by detailed spectral analyses, quantum calculations, X&#8208;ray diffraction, and modified Mosher&#8217;s methods. Notably, six previously reported structures were revised. Our study points out misleading factors of macrocyclic cembranoids (CBs) representation in the past 7 decades by analysis of 25 X&#8208;ray structures, lending a hand for innately challengeable structure identification of such flexible macrocyclic CBs and avoiding following the tracks of an overturned cart during future structure characterization and total synthesis. Biosynthetic conversions of all the isolates were proposed and wound healing bioassays reveal that papyrifuranols N&#8722;P could significantly stimulate the proliferation and differentiation of umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells.</dc:description>

         <title>Structure Elucidation of Lithium Compounds Using 7Li Residual Quadrupolar Couplings</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Getting to the solution: 7Li residual quadrupolar couplings (RQCs) &#8211; obtained under weakly oriented conditions &#8211; provide a valuable piece of information about (organo&#8208;)lithium association and solvation. In this work, the THF solvation of a range of lithium compounds was determined by comparing experimental RQCs to that calculated from 7Li electric field gradients and molecular alignment.







Abstract
A new NMR method for the structure elucidation of lithium compounds under solution&#8208;like conditions is presented. It is based on the measurement of 7Li residual quadrupolar couplings (RQCs) in a stretched polystyrene (PS) gel, and comparison to RQCs predicted from crystal or DFT&#8208;derived model structures in combination with alignment tensors derived from one&#8208;bond 1H,13C residual dipolar couplings (RDCs). The method was applied to five lithium model complexes containing monoanionic, bidentate bis(benzoxazole&#8208;2&#8208;yl)methanide, bis(benzothiazole&#8208;2&#8208;yl)methanide and bis(pyridyl)methanide ligands, of which two are first introduced in this work. In agreement with the crystalline state, four complexes are monomeric with Li coordinated fourfold by two additional THF molecules, whereas in one complex bulky tBu groups only provide space for one additional THF molecule.

Abstract
Three non&#8208;fused A&#8722;D&#8722;A&#8217;&#8722;D&#8722;A &#960;&#8208;conjugated metal&#8208;free small molecules BT&#8208;IT1, BT&#8208;IBT2 and BT2F&#8208;IBT3 have been synthesized and their absorption characteristics and redox properties, as well as charge carrier mobilities have been investigated. The resultant molecules exhibited broad absorption in the range of 325&#8211;600&#8197;nm in solutions and in thin films the absorption range is 350&#8211;700&#8197;nm. These new conjugated small molecules showed low&#8208;lying HOMO energy levels (&#8722;5.49 to &#8722;5.50&#8197;eV), deep LUMO energy levels (&#8722;3.67 to &#8722;3.69&#8197;eV) and narrow bandgaps of (EgCV) &#8764;0.79&#8197;eV. Appreciable electron mobilities for compounds BT&#8208;IBT2 and BT2F&#8208;IBT3 were 4.56&#215;10&#8722;3 and 1.12&#215;10&#8722;3&#8197;cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1, respectively, obtained by space&#8208;charge limited current (SCLC) measurements. Additionally, excellent photocatalytic performances of BT&#8208;2T (6), BT2F&#8208;2T (10), BT&#8208;IT1, BT&#8208;IBT2 and BT2F&#8208;IBT3 for highly selective oxidation of thioanisole to desired sulfoxides under visible light irradiation were observed.

         <title>Optimization of the Lead Compound NVP&#8208;BHG712 as a Colorectal Cancer Inhibitor</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Towards controlling colon carcinoma: Derivatives of the compound NVP&#8208;BHG712 as well as triazine&#8208;based molecules prove to be potent inhibitors of the receptor tyrosine kinase EPHA2. Several of these newly synthesized inhibitors showed highly promising effects in controlling human colon carcinoma. Furthermore, these molecules can act as tool compounds to gain a deeper understanding of the role of ephrin receptors in cellular context.







Abstract
The ephrin type&#8208;A receptor 2 (EPHA2) kinase belongs to the largest family of receptor tyrosine kinases. There are several indications of an involvement of EPHA2 in the development of infectious diseases and cancer. Despite pharmacological potential, EPHA2 is an under&#8208;examined target protein. In this study, we synthesized a series of derivatives of the inhibitor NVP&#8208;BHG712 and triazine&#8208;based compounds. These compounds were evaluated to determine their potential as kinase inhibitors of EPHA2, including elucidation of their binding mode (X&#8208;ray crystallography), affinity (microscale thermophoresis), and selectivity (Kinobeads assay). Eight inhibitors showed affinities in the low&#8208;nanomolar regime (KD&lt;10&#8197;nM). Testing in up to seven colon cancer cell lines that express EPHA2 reveals that several derivatives feature promising effects for the control of human colon carcinoma. Thus, we have developed a set of powerful tool compounds for fundamental new research on the interplay of EPH receptors in a cellular context.

         <title>Expedient Synthesis of Dihaloalkenynes via Pd&#8208;Catalyzed Haloalkynylation Reaction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust and regioselective PdII&#8208;catalyzed haloalkynylation of haloalkynes has been established under ligand&#8208;free and oxidant&#8208;free conditions. Careful selection of the haloalkyne starting material, with respect to electron densities of the alkyne, allows for strong control of the order and selectivity of the halide atoms in the coupled product.







Abstract
Herein, the PdII&#8208;catalyzed construction of functionalized dihaloalkenynes from haloalkynes via a self&#8208;haloalkynylation reaction, without specialized ligands or oxidizing additives, is reported. The method tolerates a diverse range of haloalkynes, including electron&#8208;donating and electron&#8208;withdrawing functional groups, such as macrocyclic alkynols, spiro&#8208;oxy ring alkynols, and even carbazole&#8208;containing, pyrrolidine&#8208;2,5&#8208;dione&#8208;containing and silyl&#8208;protected bromoalkynes. Using an opposite lithium halide (LiX) to the haloalkyne starting material, remarkably high regio&#8208; and stereoselectivity of the haloalkynylation reaction is possible, yielding 1&#8208;bromo&#8208;2&#8208;chloroalkenyne or 2&#8208;bromo&#8208;1&#8208;chloroalkenyne products as desired.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A robust and regioselective&lt;/b&gt; Pd&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;-catalyzed haloalkynylation of haloalkynes has been established under ligand-free and oxidant-free conditions. Careful selection of the haloalkyne starting material, with respect to electron densities of the alkyne, allows for strong control of the order and selectivity of the halide atoms in the coupled product.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herein, the Pd&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;-catalyzed construction of functionalized dihaloalkenynes from haloalkynes via a self-haloalkynylation reaction, without specialized ligands or oxidizing additives, is reported. The method tolerates a diverse range of haloalkynes, including electron-donating and electron-withdrawing functional groups, such as macrocyclic alkynols, spiro-oxy ring alkynols, and even carbazole-containing, pyrrolidine-2,5-dione-containing and silyl-protected bromoalkynes. Using an opposite lithium halide (LiX) to the haloalkyne starting material, remarkably high regio- and stereoselectivity of the haloalkynylation reaction is possible, yielding 1-bromo-2-chloroalkenyne or 2-bromo-1-chloroalkenyne products as desired.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>CoNi2S4 Electrode with High Mass&#8208;Loading for High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density Supercapacitor: Role of S&#8208;Containing Anions Exchange</title>

         <dc:description>
S&#8208;containing anion exchange process as a rational post&#8208;treatment route to realize the capacitive enhancement of CoNi2S4 nanoparticle arrays grown on carbon cloth (CC) with high mass&#8208;loading. The roles of anion exchange include the evolution in the surface morphology of nanoparticles, the enhancement of the crystallinity and resistance nature, and the improved durability stability.







Abstract
Anion exchange is recognized as an effective method to regulate the composition, electronic conductivity, and electrochemical behavior of the transition metal&#8208;based compounds. In this work, anion exchange is adopted as a rational post&#8208;treatment route to facilitate the capacitive activity of CoNi2S4 nanoparticle arrays grown on carbon cloth (CC) with high mass&#8208;loading. As soaked in saturated Na2S solution, the CoNi2S4/CC electrode showed an increased capacity from 483&#8197;C&#8201;g&#8722;1 to 841&#8197;C&#8201;g&#8722;1 at 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with excellent rate performance and stable cycling performance, which was superior to the CoNi2S4/CC electrode activated by NaBH4 reduction. Anion exchange was beneficial for enhancing the crystallinity, retaining the adhesion of nanoarrays, and realizing low resistance nature in a mild route. The as&#8208;assembled CoNi2S4/CC//activated CC hybrid supercapacitor delivered a high areal capacitance of 1.28&#8197;F&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 5&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, and achieved an energy density of 0.58&#8197;mWh&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at a power density of 4.5&#8197;mW&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with excellent cycle stability with 90.6&#8201;% capacity retention after 10000 cycles.

         <title>Scaffold Remodelling of Diazaspirotricycles Enables Synthesis of Diverse sp3&#8208;Rich Compounds With Distinct Phenotypic Effects</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structural and functional diversity from simple precursors: an efficient entry into a diverse sp3&#8208;rich compound library was achieved by scaffold remodelling (ring cleavage, expansion and addition) of readily&#8208;prepared spirotricyclic ureas. The resulting library shows significant scaffold diversity despite the common precursors, while individual compounds demonstrate distinctive phenotypic effects in the cell&#8208;painting assay, suggesting the library is also functionally diverse.







Abstract
A &#8216;top down&#8217; scaffold remodelling approach to library synthesis was applied to spirotricyclic ureas prepared by a complexity&#8208;generating oxidative dearomatisation. Eighteen structurally&#8208;distinct, sp3&#8208;rich scaffolds were accessed from the parent tricycle through ring addition, cleavage and expansion strategies. Biological screening of a small compound library based on these scaffolds using the cell&#8208;painting assay demonstrated distinctive phenotypic responses engendered by different library members, illustrating the functional as well as structural diversity of the compounds.

Catalytic depolymerization of ionic liquid&#8208;based biorefinery lignin over robust zirconium phosphate supported palladium catalyst.







Abstract
The efficient utilization of lignin, the direct source of renewable aromatics, into value&#8208;added renewable chemicals is an important step towards sustainable biorefinery practices. Nevertheless, owing to the random heterogeneous structure and limited solubility, lignin utilization has been primarily limited to burning for energy. The catalytic depolymerization of lignin has been proposed and demonstrated as a viable route to sustainable biorefinery, however, low yields and poor selectivity of products, high char formation, and limited to no recycling of transition&#8208;metal&#8208;based catalyst involved in lignin depolymerization demands attention to enable practical&#8208;scale lignocellulosic biorefineries. In this study, we demonstrate the catalytic depolymerization of ionic liquid&#8208;based biorefinery poplar lignin into guaiacols over a reusable zirconium phosphate supported palladium catalyst. The essence of the study lies in the high conversion (&gt;80&#8201;%), minimum char formation (7&#8211;16&#8201;%), high yields of guaiacols (up to 200&#8197;mg / g of lignin), and catalyst reusability. Both solid residue, liquid stream, and gaseous products were thoroughly characterized using ICP&#8208;OES, PXRD, CHN analysis, GC&#8208;MS, GPC, and 2D&#8197;NMR to understand the hydrogenolysis pathway.

         <title>Transition Metal&#8208;Promoted Carbon&#8208;Silicon Solid Acid Catalysts for the Synthesis and Process Optimization of Benzaldehyde Glycol Acetal</title>

Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;modified carbon&#8208;silicon solid acid catalysts with excellent acidity, facile recovery, and good stability were synthesized and exploited for practical production of benzaldehyde glycol acetal.







Abstract
A series of transition metal (M)&#8208;promoted carbon&#8208;silicon (C&#8722;M&#8722;Si; M=Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Zr) solid acid catalysts with designated molar ratio of M/Si=1&#8201;:&#8201;8 were fabricated and exploited for acetalization of benzaldehyde (BzH) with ethylene glycol (EG). The physical and chemical properties of these C&#8722;M&#8722;Si catalysts prepared by sol&#8208;gel method were characterized by various techniques, namely, SEM, EDS, TGA&#8208;DTG, BET, XRD, FTIR, XPS, and NH3&#8208;TPD. Among various examined acidic C&#8722;M&#8722;Si catalysts, the C&#8722;Fe&#8722;Si catalyst exhibited the optimal catalytic activity with the benzaldehyde glycol acetal (BEGA) yield of 97.67&#8201;%, in excellent agreement with the value (97.88&#8201;%) predicted by the response surface methodology (RSM) based on a Box&#8208;Behnken design (BBD). C&#8722;Fe&#8722;Si catalyst with the high catalytic activities and excellent stability and reusability may be ascribed to the suitable acidity and uniform surface distribution of active sites requisite for the acid&#8208;catalyzed acetalization reaction.

         <title>Access to Benzo&#8208; and Naphtho&#8208;Azaphospholes via C&#8211;H Bond Activation of Aryl&#8208;Substituted Isonitriles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Differently substituted phenyl isonitriles (with C&#8211;H bonds in ortho&#8208;position) and naphthyl isonitriles were reacted with the cyclic biradical [&#8226;P(&#181;&#8208;N&#8208;Ter)2P&#8226;] (1). Insertion of the isonitrile formed a cyclic five&#8208;membered biradical [&#8226;P(NTer)2C(R)P&#8226;] (2R, R = phenyl, napthyl) in the first step, followed by C&#8211;H activation at the aryl substituent, resulting in novel azaphospholes (5R), which could be isolated and fully characterized. The formation of the azaphospholes can be prevented by the addition of a second equivalent of isonitrile, which causes the blocking of the radical centers in 2R by adduct formation (3R). Quantum mechanical calculations showed that a significant increase in the aromaticity of the benzo&#8208; and naphtho&#8208;azaphospholes is one of the driving forces for the activation process leading to the formation of thermodynamically favored azaphospholes. Targeted activation of C&#8211;H bonds using biradical systems represents a new synthetic approach to generate benzo&#8208; and naphtho&#8208;azaphospholes.</dc:description>

         <title>Paramagnetic Relaxation Agents for Enhancing Temporal Resolution and Sensitivity in Multinuclear FlowNMR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Sensitivity in FlowNMR spectroscopy for reaction monitoring often suffers from low levels of pre&#8208;magnetisation due to limited residence time of the sample in the magnetic field. While this in&#8208;flow effect is tolerable for high sensitivity nuclei such as 1H and 19F, it significantly reduces the signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio in 31P and 13C spectra, making FlowNMR impractical especially at low analyte concentrations. Paramagnetic relaxation agents (PRAs), which enhance polarisation and spin&#8208;lattice relaxation, could eliminate the adverse in&#8208;flow effect and improve the signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio. Here, we investigate [Co(acac)3], [Mn(acac)3], [Fe(acac)3], [Cr(acac)3], [Ni(acac)2]3, [Gd(tmhd)3] and [Cr(tmhd)3] for their effectiveness in improving signal intensity per unit time in FlowNMR applications under the additional constraint of chemical inertness towards catalytically active transition metal complexes. High&#8208;spin Cr(III)acetylacetonates emerged as the most effective compounds successfully reducing 31P T1 values four&#8208; to five&#8208;fold at concentrations as low as 10 mM without causing adverse line broadening. Whereas [Cr(acac)3] showed signs of chemical reactivity with a mixture of triphenylphosphine, triphenylphosphine oxide and triphenylphosphate over the course of several hours at 80&#176; C, the bulkier [Cr(tmhd)3] was stable and equally effective as a PRA under these conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>Better Peptides via Chemical Glycosylation: Somatostatin Analogues Having a Human Complex&#8208;Type N&#8208;Glycan with Improved Drug Properties</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Somatostatin (somatotropin release&#8208;inhibiting factor, SRIF) is a growth hormone inhibitory factor in the form of a 14&#8208; or 28&#8208;amino acid peptide. SRIF affects several physiological functions through its action on five distinct SRIF receptor subtypes (sst1&#8208;5). Native SRIF has only limited clinical applications due to its rapid degradation in plasma. To overcome this obstacle, we have developed glycosylated SRIF analogues that possess not only metabolic stability but also high affinity to all five receptor subtypes by attaching human complex&#8208;type oligosaccharides. Such glycosylated SRIF analogues with improved pharmacokinetic profiles could be potent and novel therapeutic drugs for SRIF&#8208;related diseases in which several SRIF receptor subtypes are closely involved, and also shed light on new indications. Our results show that chemical glycosylation can be a powerful tool for the development of peptide and protein analogues superior to the original molecules with enhanced drug properties.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>Trisubstituted 1,3,5&#8208;tri(benzimidazolyl)benzene derivatives were synthesized from &#671;&#8208;alanine, &#671;&#8208;valine, &#7429;&#8208;valine and glycine, and their self&#8208;assembling behavior and stimuli&#8208;response in solution and gel states were evaluated. Circular dichroism/UV&#8211;vis absorption spectroscopic and dynamic light scattering measurements revealed that the compounds formed H&#8208;aggregates via intramolecular hydrogen bonding and &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions in nonpolar solvents such as CHCl3, whereas collapse of the aggregates was confirmed by MeOH addition. Quantum mechanical calculations and molecular dynamics simulations also supported aggregation in CHCl3.

         <title>Tetraphenylethene&#8208;based cis/trans isomers for targeted fluorescence sensing and biomedical applications</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Molecular probes which can be modulated, functionalized and used to visualize the processes are highly desirable for understanding and manipulating biological systems. Geometric cis and trans isomers of tetraphenylethene (TPE) emerge as attractive candidates to fulfill these tasks thanks to the unique aggregation&#8208;induced emission properties, tailorable structures, and responsiveness to external stimuli. This minireview focuses on cis and trans isomers of TPE derivatives that are functionalized with molecular recognition units for fluorescence detection, bioimaging and cancer therapy. The effects of molecular geometry on fluorescence property, target binding ability and biological activity are summarized. The feasibility to in vitro and in vivo switch molecular configuration and thus bio&#8208;activity is discussed. Finally, the future development and challenges are discussed in view of TPE&#8208;based stereoisomers for targeted sensing and imaging&#8208;guided modulation of biological processes.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Compared with O&#8208;aryl glycosides, C&#8208;aryl glycosides have remarkable stability in the process of enzyme and chemical hydrolysis, and have important applications in pharmaceutical chemistry and biochemistry. In recent years, the synthesis of C&#8208;aryl glycosides has attracted extensive attention of chemical researchers. Among them, the strategy of C&#8208;aryl glycosides synthesis through C&#8208;H functionalization does not require pre&#8208;functionalization of the substrate, and has high step economy and atomic economy, which is the focus of attention. Herein, this concept article systematically summarizes the synthesis of C&#8208;aryl glycosides with diverse regioselectivity and diastereoselectivity from the perspective of C&#8208;H arylation of glycosides and C&#8208;H glycosylation of arenes.</dc:description>

This reaction sequence involved an initial formation of five&#8208;membered spirocyclic products followed by an intramolecular ring&#8208;opening and ring expansion to produce seven&#8208;membered diazepinones. We demonstrated that controlling the reaction time could modulate the reaction pathway for formation of different molecular frameworks for the same set of substrates.&#160;Based on the experimental results, the reaction mechanism was also discussed and proposed to explain the phenomena observed in the process.</dc:description>

         <title>High Rates of Quinone&#8208;Alkyne Cycloaddition Reactions are Dictated by Entropic Factors</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Reaction rates of strained cycloalkynes and cycloalkenes with 1,2&#8208;quinone were quantified by stopped flow UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy and computational analysis. We found that the strained alkyne BCN&#8208;OH 3 (k2 1824 M&#8208;1s&#8208;1) reacts &gt;150 times faster than the strained alkene TCO&#8208;OH 5 (k2 11.56 M&#8208;1s&#8208;1). Also, the 8&#8208;membered strained alkyne BCN&#8208;OH 3 reacts 16 times faster than the more strained 7&#8208;membered THS 2 (k2 110.6 M&#8208;1s&#8208;1). Using the linearized Eyring equation we determined the thermodynamic activation parameters of these two strained alkynes, revealing that the SPOCQ reaction of quinone 1 with THS 2 is associated with &#916;H&#8225; of 0.80 kcal/mol, &#916;S&#8225; = &#8722;46.8 cal/K&#183;mol, and &#916;G&#8225; = 14.8 kcal/mol (at 25 &#176;C), whereas the same reaction with BCN&#8208;OH 3 is associated with, &#916;H&#8225; = 2.25 kcal/mol, &#916;S&#8225; = &#8722;36.3 cal/K&#183;mol, and &#916;G&#8225; = 13.1 kcal/mol (at 25 &#176;C). Computational analysis supported the values obtained by the stopped&#8208;flow measurements, with calculated &#916;G&#8225; of 15.6 kcal/mol (in H2O) for the SPOCQ reaction with THS 2, and with &#916;G&#8225; of 14.7 kcal/mol (in H2O) for the SPOCQ reaction with BCN&#8208;OH 3. With these empirically determined thermodynamic parameters, we set an important step towards a more fundamental understanding of this set of rapid biogenic click reactions.</dc:description>

         <title>Synthesis and Crystallographic Characterization of Helical Hairpin Oligourea Foldamers</title>

         <dc:description>Oligomers designed to form a helix&#8208;turn&#8208;helix super&#8208;secondary structure have been prepared by covalently bridging aliphatic oligourea foldamer helices with either rigid aromatic or more flexible aliphatic spacers. The relative helix orientation in these dimers has been investigated at high resolution using X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis. In several cases, racemic crystallography was used to facilitate crystallization and structure determination. All structures were solved by direct methods. Well&#8208;defined parallel helical hairpin motifs were observed in all cases when 4,4&#8217;&#8208;methylene diphenyl diisocyanate was employed as a dimerizing agent, irrespective of primary sequence and chain length.</dc:description>

         <title>Chalcogen Bonding (ChB) as a Robust Supramolecular Recognition Motif of Benzisothiazolinone Antibacterials</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>1,2&#8208;benzisothiazol&#8208;3(2H)&#8208;one derivatives are highly active against a broad spectrum of fungi as well as Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria. For this reason they are extensively used, e.g., as additives in detergents, leather products, paper coatings, and antifouling paintings. In this paper experimental findings are reported proving that the sulfur atom of benzisothiazolinones have a remarkable tendency to form short and directional chalcogen bonds on the extension of the covalent N&#8722;S bond and, to a lesser extent, of the C&#8722;S bond. Analyses of the Cambridge Structural Database confirm the interaction as a primary&#160; recognition motif of these systems. The electrophilicity of sulfur is crucial in the chemical reactions initiating the cascade of events resulting in the biopharmacological activities of benzisothiazolinones. The reported results suggest that the electrophility of sulfur may play a role also at earlier stages than the reactive ones, namely it may pin the compounds at the active site of target enzymes via chalcogen bonds that preorganize the system in the conformation required for the bonds formation/cleavage determining the biopharmacological activity.</dc:description>

         <title>Cumulative Effect of pH and Redox Triggers on Highly Adaptive Transient Coacervates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multimodal transience. A highly adaptive coacervate is reported that can be formed transiently under the influence of two different triggers, pH and redox. The cumulative effect of both triggers results in the coacervation and the transient cycles can be operated sequentially for multiple cycles.







Abstract
An intricate synergism between multiple biochemical processes and physical conditions determines the formation and function of various biological self&#8208;assemblies. Thus, a complex set of variables dictate the far&#8208;from&#8208;equilibrium nature of these biological assemblies. Mimicking such systems synthetically is a challenging task. We report multi&#8208;stimuli responsive transient coacervation of an aldehyde&#8208;appended polymer and a short peptide. The coacervates are formed by the disulphide linkages between the peptide molecules and the imine bond between the polymer and the peptide. Imines are susceptible to pH changes and the disulphide bonds can be tuned by oxidation/reduction processes. Thus, the coacervation is operational only under the combined effect of appropriate pH and oxidative conditions. Taking advantage of these facts, the coacervates are transiently formed under a pH cycle (urea&#8208;urease/gluconolactone) and a non&#8208;equilibrium redox cycle (TCEP/H2O2). Importantly, the system showed high adaptability toward environmental changes. The transient existence of the coacervates can be generated without any apparent change in size and shape within the same system through the sequential application of the above&#8208;mentioned nonequilibrium reaction cycles. Additionally, the coacervation allows for efficient encapsulation/stabilisation of proteins. Thus, the system has the potential to be used for protein/drug delivery purposes in the future.

         <title>Conjugating Coumarin with Tetraphenylethylene to Achieve Dual&#8208;State Emission for Reversible Mechanofluorochromism and Live Cell Imaging</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coumarin&#8208;tetraphenylethylene&#8208;derived dual&#8208;state luminogens (DSEgens) with bright emission in both dilute solutions and the solid state have been synthesized by finely tuning electronic structures and molecular conformations. Experimental results suggest that a favorable electron transfer within the highly twisting molecules is essential for the DSE properties. The DSEgens were demonstrated applicable as dual&#8208;state probes for reversible mechanofluorochromism and live cell imaging.







Abstract
Dual&#8208;state emission luminogens (DSEgens) are receiving research interest in the construction of multifunctional materials due to their inherent advantage of high emission efficiency in both the molecularly dispersed solution state and the solid state. However, it remains challenging in synthesizing DSEgens via a delicate manipulation of the molecular structures. This work presents an example of bright DSEgen synthesis by tuning the molecular electronic structures and conformations. Three coumarin&#8208;tetraphenylethylene (TPE) molecules with a donor&#8208;acceptor electronic structure and highly twisting conformations have been synthesized. While compound resulting from direct conjugation of coumarin with a TPE unit shows aggregation&#8208;induced emission, compound with an N,N&#8208;diaminoethyl modification on the 7&#8208;position of coumarin and compound with a further phenyl linker between coumarin and TPE units feature strong dual&#8208;state emission. Benefiting from their strong solid emission and twisting conformations, these fluorophores display reversible mechanofluorochromism. Finally, applications for rewritable information storage in the solid state and live&#8208;cell imaging in the solution state were demonstrated.

         <title>Functionalized MOF&#8208;Based Photocatalysts for CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent improved strategies on the pure MOF and various MOF&#8208;based composites photocatalysts are summarized here. An insight into the absorption edges is proposed, CO2 adsorption capacities and photocatalytic activities of these newly developed photocatalysts are highlighted to provide fundamental guidance to rational design of efficient MOF&#8208;based photocatalyst materials for CO2 reduction.







Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) materials have become a research forefront in the field of photocatalytic CO2 reduction attributed to their ultra&#8208;high specific surface area, adjustable structure, and abundant catalytic active sites. Particularly, MOFs can be facilely tuned to match CO2 photoreduction by utilizing post&#8208;modification of metal nodes, functionalization of organic linkers, and combination with other active materials. Herein, the recent advances in the construction strategy of MOF&#8208;based photocatalysts materials for CO2 reduction are highlighted. Some systematic modification strategies on MOF&#8208;based photocatalysts are also discussed, such as modification of metal sites and organic ligands, construction of heterojunction, introduction of single/dual&#8208;atom, and strain engineering. Finally, the future development directions of MOF&#8208;based photocatalysts in the field of CO2 reduction are presented.

An insight into the absorption edges is proposed, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption capacities and photocatalytic activities of these newly developed photocatalysts are highlighted to provide fundamental guidance to rational design of efficient MOF-based photocatalyst materials for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) materials have become a research forefront in the field of photocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction attributed to their ultra-high specific surface area, adjustable structure, and abundant catalytic active sites. Particularly, MOFs can be facilely tuned to match CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; photoreduction by utilizing post-modification of metal nodes, functionalization of organic linkers, and combination with other active materials. Herein, the recent advances in the construction strategy of MOF-based photocatalysts materials for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction are highlighted. Some systematic modification strategies on MOF-based photocatalysts are also discussed, such as modification of metal sites and organic ligands, construction of heterojunction, introduction of single/dual-atom, and strain engineering. Finally, the future development directions of MOF-based photocatalysts in the field of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction are presented.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Nanopalladium on cellulose catalyzes hydroborations: A highly efficient and stereoselective heterogeneous palladium&#8208;catalyzed hydroboration reaction of enallenes was developed. Nanopalladium immobilized on microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) was successfully employed as an efficient catalyst for the enallene hydroboration reaction. The cellulose&#8208;supported palladium catalyst exhibits high stability and recyclability, providing vinyl boron products in good to high isolated yields (up to 90&#8201;%).







Abstract
A highly efficient regio&#8208; and stereoselective heterogeneous palladium&#8208;catalyzed hydroboration reaction of enallenes was developed. Nanopalladium immobilized on microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) was successfully employed as an efficient catalyst for the enallene hydroboration reaction. The nanopalladium particles were shown by HAADF&#8208;STEM to have an average size of 2.4&#8197;nm. The cellulose&#8208;supported palladium catalyst exhibits high stability and provides vinyl boron products in good to high isolated yields (up to 90&#8201;%). The nanopalladium catalyst can be efficiently recycled and it was demonstrated that the catalyst can be used in 7 runs with a maintained high yield (&gt;80&#8201;%). The vinylboron compounds prepared from enallenes are important synthetic intermediates that can be used in various organic synthetic transformations.

         <title>Theoretical Calculations on Metal Catalysts Toward Water&#8208;Gas Shift Reaction: a Review</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent developments in theoretical calculations (structural characteristics, reaction mechanisms and chemical kinetics) of metal catalysts toward water&#8208;gas shift (WGS) reaction are summarized and highlighted in this review with special emphasis on the properties of crystal&#8208;face effect, alloying strategy and metal&#8208;support interaction.







Abstract
Water&#8208;gas shift (WGS) reaction offers a dominating path to hydrogen generation from fossil fuel, in which heterogeneous metal catalysts play a crucial part in this course. This review highlights and summarizes recent developments on theoretical calculations of metal catalysts developed to date, including surface structure (e.&#8201;g., monometallic and polymetallic systems) and interface structure (e.&#8201;g., supported catalysts and metal oxide composites), with special emphasis on the characteristics of crystal&#8208;face effect, alloying strategy, and metal&#8208;support interaction. A systematic summarization on reaction mechanism was performed, including redox mechanism, associative mechanism as well as hybrid mechanism; the development on chemical kinetics (e.&#8201;g., molecular dynamics, kinetic Monte Carlo and microkinetic simulation) was then introduced. At the end, challenges associated with theoretical calculations on metal catalysts toward WGS reaction are discussed and some perspectives on the future advance of this field are provided.

         <title>Evaluation by Experimentation and Simulation of a FRET Pair Comprising Fluorescent Nucleobase Analogs in Nucleosomes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Minimal modification and orientation dependency: Nucleobase FRET pair was incorporated into nucleosome and its ability was examined by experimentation and simulation. Experimental and theoretical FRET efficiencies showed similar trends suggesting orientation dependency of the FRET pair.







Abstract
F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) is an attractive tool for understanding biomolecular dynamics. FRET&#8208;based analysis of nucleosomes has the potential to fill the knowledge gaps between static structures and dynamic cellular behaviors. Compared with typical FRET pairs using bulky fluorophores introduced by flexible linkers, fluorescent nucleoside&#8208;based FRET pair has great potential since it can be fitted within the helical structures of nucleic acids. Herein we report on the construction of nucleosomes containing a nucleobase FRET pair and the investigation of experimental and theoretical FRET efficiencies through steady&#8208;state fluorescence spectroscopy and calculation based on molecular dynamics simulations, respectively. Distinguishable experimental FRET efficiencies were observed depending on the positions of FRET pairs in nucleosomal DNA. The tendency could be supported by theoretical study. This work suggests the possibility of our approach to analyze structural changes of nucleosomes by epigenetic modifications or internucleosomal interactions.

         <title>Mechanistic Insights into Enhanced Hydrogen Evolution of CrOx/Rh Nanoparticles for Photocatalytic Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) on Rh nanoparticles (RhNP) was investigated as a model cocatalyst system for photocatalytic water splitting. A 2&#8208;nm&#8208;thick ultrathin CrOx layer on RhNP (CrOx/RhNP) significantly improves HER activity. DC and AC electrochemical measurements revealed that a CrOx/RhNP facilitates the electron transfer process on HER, and H+ reaches the RhNP surface via the H+&#8208;hopping process inside the CrOx layer.







Abstract
The hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) of Rh nanoparticles (RhNP) coated with an ultrathin layer of Cr&#8208;oxides (CrOx) was investigated as a model electrode for the Cr2O3/Rh&#8208;metal core&#8208;shell&#8208;type cocatalyst system for photocatalytic water splitting. The CrOx layer was electrodeposited over RhNP on a transparent conductive fluorine&#8208;doped tin oxide (FTO) substrate. The CrOx layer on RhNP facilitates the electron transfer process at the CrOx/RhNP interface, leading to the increased current density for the HER. Impedance spectroscopic analysis revealed that the CrOx layer transferred protons via the hopping mechanism to the RhNP surface for HER. In addition, CrOx restricted electron transfer from the FTO to the electrolyte and/or RhNP and suppressed the backward reaction by limiting oxygen migration. This study clarifies the crucial role of the ultrathin CrOx layer on nanoparticulate cocatalysts and provides a cocatalyst design strategy for realizing efficient photocatalytic water splitting.

         <title>Morphological Evolution of Calcite Grown in Zwitterionic Hydrogels: Charge Effects Enhanced by Gel&#8208;Incorporation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To investigate the significance of the charged biomacromolecule incorporation for mineralization control, gel&#8208;incorporated calcite crystals grown from different gelatin hydrogels are examined. The charged groups on gel networks play crucial roles in controlling the single&#8208;crystallinity and the crystal morphology. The gel&#8208;incorporation greatly enhances the charge effects because the gel networks force the charged groups to attach to the crystallization fronts.







Abstract
The incorporation of charged biomacromolecules is widely found in biomineralization. To investigate the significance of this biological strategy for mineralization control, gelatin&#8208;incorporated calcite crystals grown from gelatin hydrogels with different charge concentrations along the gel networks are examined. It is found that the bound charged groups on gelatin networks (amino cations, gelatin&#8208;NH3+ and carboxylic anions, gelatin&#8208;COO&#8722;) play crucial roles in controlling the single&#8208;crystallinity and the crystal morphology. And the charge effects are greatly enhanced by the gel&#8208;incorporation because the incorporated gel networks force the bound charged groups on them to attach to crystallization fronts. In contrast, ammonium ions (NH4+) and acetate ions (Ac&#8722;) dissolve in the crystallization media do not exhibit the similar charge effects because the balance of attachment/detachment make them more difficult to be incorporated. Employing the revealed charge effects, the calcite crystal composites with different morphologies can be flexibly prepared.

         <title>Electrophotochemical Metal&#8208;Catalyzed Enantioselective Decarboxylative Cyanation</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sustainable and efficient electrophotochemical metal&#8208;catalyzed protocol is developed for the direct conversion of readily available aliphatic carboxylic acids into chiral alkyl nitriles. Electrophotochemical Ce catalysis enables mild reaction conditions for radical decarboxylation to produce alkyl radicals, which could be effectively intercepted by asymmetric electrochemical Cu catalysis for the construction of C&#8722;CN bonds in a highly stereoselective manner.







Abstract
In contrast to the rapid growth of electrophotocatalysis in recent years, enantioselective catalytic reactions powered by this unique methodology remain rare. In this work, we report an electrophotochemical metal&#8208;catalyzed protocol for direct asymmetric decarboxylative cyanation of aliphatic carboxylic acids. The synergistic merging of electrophotochemical cerium catalysis and asymmetric electrochemical copper catalysis permits mild reaction conditions for the formation and utilization of the key carbon centered radicals by combining the power of light and electrical energy. Electrophotochemical cerium catalysis enables radical decarboxylation to produce alkyl radicals, which could be effectively intercepted by asymmetric electrochemical copper catalysis for the construction of C&#8722;CN bonds in a highly stereoselective fashion. This environmentally benign method smoothly converts a diverse array of arylacetic acids into the corresponding alkyl nitriles in good yields and enantioselectivities without using chemical oxidants or pre&#8208;functionalization of the acid substrates and can be readily scaled up.

         <title>Cooperativity&#8208;Driven Reactivity of a Dinuclear Copper Dimethylglyoxime Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
First check your solvent: In a dinuclear dimethylglyoxime copper(II) complex, hydrolysis of one ligand is facilitated by the cooperative effect of both CuII ions. Hydrolysis yields butane&#8208;2,3&#8208;dione monoxime and NH2OH; depending on the solvent used, the latter is either oxidized to N2O (in CH3CN) or reduced to NH4+ (in ethanol). A combined approach of experimental, theoretical, and spectroscopic methods allowed the reaction mechanism to be suggested.







Abstract
In this report, we present the dinuclear copper(II) dimethylglyoxime (H2dmg) complex [Cu2(H2dmg)(Hdmg)(dmg)]+ (1), which, in contrast to its mononuclear analogue [Cu(Hdmg)2] (2), is subject to a cooperativity&#8208;driven hydrolysis. The combined Lewis acidity of both copper centers increases the electrophilicity of the carbon atom in the bridging &#956;2&#8208;O&#8722;N=C&#8208;group of H2dmg and thus, facilitates the nucleophilic attack of H2O. This hydrolysis yields butane&#8208;2,3&#8208;dione monoxime (3) and NH2OH that, depending on the solvent, is then either oxidized or reduced. In ethanol, NH2OH is reduced to NH4+, yielding acetaldehyde as the oxidation product. In contrast, in CH3CN, NH2OH is oxidized by CuII to form N2O and [Cu(CH3CN)4]+. Herein are presented the combined synthetic, theoretical, spectroscopic and spectrometric methods that indicate and establish the reaction pathway of this solvent&#8208;dependent reaction.

         <title>The Full Cytosine&#8208;Cytosine Base Paring: Self&#8208;Assembly and Crystal Structure</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unusual multiple cytosine&#8208;cytosine base paring pattern (named full C&#8201;:&#8201;C base pairing) and i&#8208;motif structure in self assembly complexes induced by the regulation of solvent condition and pH values.







Abstract
The synthesis of self&#8208;assembly systems that can mimic partial biological behaviours require ingenious and delicate design. For decades, scientists are committed to exploring new base pairing patterns using hydrogen bonds directed self&#8208;assembly of nucleotides. A fundamental question is the adaptive circumstance of the recognition between base pairs, namely, how solvent conditions affect the domain of base pairs. Towards this question, three nucleotide complexes based on 2&#8217;&#8208;deoxycytidine&#8208;5&#8217;&#8208;monophosphate (dCMP) and cytidine&#8208;5&#8217;&#8208;monophosphate (CMP) were synthesized in different solvents and pH values, and an unusual cytosine&#8208;cytosine base paring pattern (named full C&#8201;:&#8201;C base pairing) has been successfully obtained. Systematic single crystal analysis and 1H NMR titration spectra have been performed to explore factors influencing the formation of base paring patterns. Moreover, supramolecular chirality of three complexes were studied using circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy in solution and solid&#8208;state combined with crystal structure analysis.

         <title>A Plasmon Resonance Enhanced Photo&#8208;Electrode to Promote NH3 Yield in Sustainable N2 Conversion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy is proposed to address current NH3 yield challenge of NRR by achieving low H* coverages at appreciable current densities based on the unique SPR effect and established a correlation between H* coverage and NRR performance. The specifically designed ZnSe(Au) electrode achieves a high FE and NH3 yield rate of 27.3&#8201;% and 12.2&#8197;&#956;g cm&#8722;2 h&#8722;1, respectively.







Abstract
A key challenge for electrochemical nitrogen reduction reactions (NRR) is the difficulty for conventional catalysts to achieve high currents at low H* coverage to produce appreciable NH3. Herein, we specially designed an Au nanoparticle&#8208;embedded ZnSe photo&#8208;electrode to solve the problem. As&#8208;designed photo&#8208;electrode achieves excellent NRR performance with a high NH3 yield (12.2&#8197;&#956;g&#8201;cm&#8722;2 h&#8722;1) and Faradaic efficiency (27.3&#8201;%). Our work reveals that the unique plasmon resonance effect of embedded Au nanoparticles plays a key role in increasing catalytic current when the H* coverage is decreased. Moreover, we successfully established a correlation between H* coverage and NRR performance based on theoretical calculations and experimental observations. This work paves the path for the future design of catalytic materials to overcome the selectivity and yield challenge of sustainable NH3 production.

Moreover, we successfully established a correlation between H* coverage and NRR performance based on theoretical calculations and experimental observations. This work paves the path for the future design of catalytic materials to overcome the selectivity and yield challenge of sustainable NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; production.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Role of the Transient Atropisomerism and Chirality of Flurbiprofen Unveiled by Laser&#8208;Ablation Rotational Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The two most stable conformers of flurbiprofen (FB) have been isolated. They only differ in the dihedral angle that defines the arrangement of the phenyl group revealing FB atropisomerism. Analysing the recognition of FB by COX isoforms, it comes out that only one of these atropisomers is specifically selected for each R&#8208; or S&#8208; enantiomer.







Abstract
The combination of atropisomerism and chirality in flurbiprofen is shown to be relevant concerning its pharmacological activity. The two most stable conformers of a total of eight theoretically predicted for each R&#8208; or S&#8208; flurbiprofen enantiomers have been isolated in the cooling conditions of a supersonic jet and structurally characterized by laser ablation Fourier transform microwave spectroscopy. The detected conformers, whose structure is mainly defined by three dihedral angles, only differ in the sign of the phenyl torsion angle giving rise to Sa and Ra atropisomers. A comparison with the structures available for the R&#8208; and S&#8208; enantiomers complexed to COX isoforms reveals that the enzymes select only the Sa atropisomers, resulting in a diastereoisomer&#8208;specific recognition. The most stable gas phase conformer is exclusively selected when using the S&#8208; enantiomer while the second is recognized only for the R&#8208; enantiomer. These experimental results highlight the importance of atropisomerism in drug design.

         <title>Secondary Orbital Effect Involving Fluorine is Responsible for Substrate&#8208;Controlled Diastereodivergence in the Catalyzed syn&#8208;aza&#8208;Henry Reaction of &#945;&#8208;Fluoronitroalkanes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Evidence for a secondary orbital interaction between fluorine and a hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;activated azomethine (C=N) is found to be a driving force for fluorine&#8208;induced diastereodivergence observed in a rare syn&#8208;selective aza&#8208;Henry reaction. This study examines BAM catalysis in detail, but the phenomenon is expected to be more general given similar observations in enantioselective phase transfer catalysis.







Abstract
The fluorine atom is a powerful, yet enigmatic influence on chemical reactions. True to form, fluorine was recently discovered to effect diastereodivergence in an enantioselective aza&#8208;Henry reaction, resulting in a very rare case of syn&#8208;&#946;&#8208;amino nitroalkane products. More bewildering was the observation of an apparent hierarchy of substituents within this substrate&#8208;controlled behavior: Ph&gt;F&gt;alkyl. These cases have now been examined comprehensively by computational methods, including both non&#8208;fluorinated and &#945;&#8208;fluoro nitronate additions to aldimines catalyzed by a chiral bis(amidine) [BAM] proton complex. This study revealed the network of non&#8208;covalent interactions that dictate anti&#8208; (&#945;&#8208;aryl) versus syn&#8208;selectivity (&#945;&#8208;alkyl) using &#945;&#8208;fluoronitronate nucleophiles, and an underlying secondary orbital interaction between fluorine and the activated azomethine.

         <title>Defects&#8208;Abundant Ga2O3 Nanobricks Enabled Multifunctional Solid Polymer Electrolyte for Superior Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Defects&#8208;abundant Ga2O3 nanobricks were applied as multifunctional fillers to construct a PEO&#8208;based organic&#8208;inorganic electrolyte for lithium metal batteries. Due to the multifunctional feature of Ga2O3 filler, this composite electrolyte not only broadens the electrochemical stability window but also improved the ionic conductivity and thereby attaining a superior rate capability.







Abstract
Polyethylene oxide (PEO)&#8208;based polymer electrolytes with good flexibility and viscoelasticity, low interfacial resistance, and fabricating cost have caught worldwide attention, but their practical application is still hampered by the instability at high voltages and the low ionic conductivity (10&#8722;8 to 10&#8722;6&#8197;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1). Herein, we rationally designed defects&#8208;abundant Ga2O3 nanobricks as multifunctional fillers and constructed a PEO&#8208;based organic&#8208;inorganic electrolyte for lithium metal batteries. Due to the abundant O&#8208;defects feature of Ga2O3 filler, this PEO&#8208;based composite electrolyte not only broadens electrochemical stability window (over 5.3&#8197;V versus Li/Li+) but also in&#8197;situ forms a Li&#8211;Ga alloy and solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) film during the cycling process causing a rapid diffusion of Li+ ions. The as&#8208;prepared electrolyte has good interface compatibility with Li metal (without short&#8208;circuiting over 500&#8197;h at 0.2&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) and possesses superior high ionic conductivity. The assembled all&#8208;solid&#8208;state LiFePO4//Li cells attained an excellent cycling performance of 146&#8197;mAh&#8201;g&#8722;1 over 100 cycles at 0.5&#8197;C. The XPS analysis reveals that Ga2O3 nanobricks can form in&#8197;situ a Li&#8722;Ga alloy layer at the polymer/anode interface. This work shed a light on designing high ionic conductivity lithium alloys in the composite electrolyte, which can improve the electrochemical properties of PEO&#8208;based polymer electrolytes.

         <title>Broad&#8208;scope Syntheses of [11C/18F]Trifluoromethylarenes from Aryl(mesityl)iodonium Salts</title>

Treatment of aryl(mesityl)iodonium salts with 11C or 18F&#8208;labeled copper CF3 gives broad scope rapid and high yield access to radiolabled aryl trifluoromethyl arenes for PET imaging applications







Abstract
Efficient methods for labeling aryl trifluoromethyl groups to provide novel radiotracers for use in biomedical research with positron emission tomography (PET) are keenly sought. We report a broad&#8208;scope method for labeling trifluoromethylarenes with either carbon&#8208;11 (t1/2=20.4&#8197;min) or fluorine&#8208;18 (t1/2=109.8&#8197;min) from readily accessible aryl(mesityl)iodonium salts. In this method, the aryl(mesityl)iodonium salt is treated rapidly with no&#8208;carrier&#8208;added [11C]CuCF3 or [18F]CuCF3. The mesityl group acts as a spectator allowing radiolabeled trifluoromethylarenes to be obtained with very high chemoselectivity. Radiochemical yields from aryl(mesityl)iodonium salts bearing either electron&#8208;donating or electron&#8208;withdrawing groups at meta&#8208; or para&#8208; position are good to excellent (67&#8211;96&#8201;%). Ortho&#8208;substituted and otherwise sterically hindered trifluoromethylarenes still give good yields (15&#8211;34&#8201;%). Substituted heteroaryl(mesityl)iodonium salts are also viable substrates. The broad scope of this method was further exemplified by labeling a previously inaccessible target, [11C]p&#8208;trifluoromethylphenyl boronic acid, as a potentially useful labeling synthon. In addition, fluoxetine, leflunomide, and 3&#8208;trifluoromethyl&#8208;4&#8208;aminopyridine, as examples of small drug&#8208;like molecules and candidate PET radioligands, were successfully labeled in high yields (69&#8211;81&#8201;%).

         <title>Styrene Oxide Isomerase&#8208;Catalyzed Meinwald Rearrangement in Cascade Biotransformations: Synthesis of Chiral and/or Natural Chemicals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cascade biotransformations involving styrene oxide isomerase (SOI)&#8208;catalyzed Meinwald rearrangement via a stereospecific and trans&#8208;selective 1,2&#8208;H or 1,2&#8208;methyl shift were developed for versatile and high&#8208;yielding chemical synthesis, including enantioselective synthesis of valuable chiral molecules from easily available alkenes or racemic epoxides and sustainable synthesis of useful natural products from bio&#8208;based substrates or renewable feedstock.







Abstract
Styrene oxide isomerase (SOI) catalyzes the Meinwald rearrangement of aryl epoxides to carbonyl compounds via a 1,2&#8208;trans&#8208;shift in a stereospecific manner. A number of cascade biotransformations with SOI&#8208;catalyzed epoxide isomerization as a key step have been developed to convert readily available substrates into valuable chiral chemicals. Cascade conversion of terminal or internal alkenes into chiral acids, alcohols or amines was achieved, which involved SOI&#8208;catalyzed enantio&#8208;retentive isomerization of terminal epoxides via 1,2&#8208;H shift, or internal epoxides via 1,2&#8208;methyl shift. SOI&#8208;involved cascades were also developed to convert racemic epoxides into chiral acids or amines via dynamic kinetic resolution. Additionally, combining SOI&#8208;catalyzed isomerization with enantioselective C&#8722;C bond forming enzymes enabled the synthesis of chiral amino acids or amino alcohols from racemic epoxides. Finally, integration of SOI&#8208;involved cascades with biosynthesis pathways allowed for the direct utilization of renewable substrates for the sustainable synthesis of high&#8208;value natural chemicals such as alcohols, acids, and esters.

         <title>Rhodamine&#8208;Sensitized Two&#8208;Photon Activation of a Red Light&#8208;Absorbing BODIPY Photocage</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Only very few rhodamine photocages exist and two&#8208;photon activation of BODIPY is not possible. A new rhodamine&#8208;BODIPY dyad combines the favorable properties of both chromophores and allows to liberate a target molecule by two&#8208;photon irradiation.







Abstract
Two&#8208;photon (2P) activatable probes are of high value in biological and medical chemistry since near infrared (NIR) light can penetrate deeply even in blood&#8208;perfused tissue and due to the intrinsic three&#8208;dimensional activation properties. Designing two&#8208;photon chromophores is challenging. However, the two&#8208;photon absorption qualities of a photocage can be improved with an intramolecular sensitizer, which transfers the absorbed light onto the cage. We herein present the synthesis and photophysical characterization of a 2P&#8208;sensitive uncaging dyad based on rhodamine 101 as donor fluorophore and a redshifted BODIPY as acceptor photocage. Liberation of p&#8208;nitroaniline (PNA) upon one&#8208;photon photolysis was confirmed by HPLC analysis. The photoreaction was found to be accompanied by a considerable change of the fluorescence properties of the chromophores. The possibility of a fluorescent read&#8208;out enabled the detection of two&#8208;photon induced uncaging by confocal fluorescence microscopy.

         <title>Modular Principle for Complex Disordered Tetrahedral Frameworks in Quenched High&#8208;Pressure Phases of Phosphorus Oxide Nitrides</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The building blocks that form the complex structures of the new phosphorus oxide nitrides P40O31N46 and P74O59N84 can be intergrown with further compounds. They are comparable to silicates in the Earth's crust, which is symbolized by a cutout of the disordered crystal structure. The background shows a typical diffraction pattern acquired with microfocused synchrotron radiation as used for the structure elucidation. More information can be found in the Research Article by W. Schnick, O. Oeckler and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202203892).

         <title>Orientational Control of Circularly Polarized Luminescence from Pyrene Clusters by Using a DNA Scaffold</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Circularly polarized luminescent (CPL) depends on orientation. The DNA helix is depicted as a spiral staircase on which chromophore people stand. The CPL intensity, which is shown as helical light, varies depending not only on the distance between chromophores but also on their relative orientation. Helical structures of DNA duplexes are also illustrated. More information can be found in the Research Article by H. Kashida, H. Asanuma, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/chem.202300182).

         <title>Insights into the Conformational Plasticity of the Protein Kinase Akt1 by Multi&#8208;Lateral Dipolar Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The conformational flexibility between the pleckstrin homology (PH) and kinase domain of the kinase Akt1 was investigated using multilateration of double electron resonance spectroscopy (DEER) distance restraints. Detailed structural data of wild&#8208;type Akt1 and the cancer&#8208;associated E17K mutation in the apo and ligand&#8208;bound states are presented, yielding deep insights into the conformational plasticity of Akt1.







Abstract
The serine/threonine kinase Akt1 is part of the PI3&#8197;K/Akt pathway and plays a key role in the regulation of various cellular processes such as cell growth, proliferation, and apoptosis. Here, we analyzed the elasticity between the two domains of the kinase Akt1, connected by a flexible linker, recording a wide variety of distance restraints by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. We studied full length Akt1 and the influence of the cancer&#8208;associated mutation E17K. The conformational landscape in the presence of different modulators, like different types of inhibitors and membranes was presented, revealing a tuned flexibility between the two domains, dependent on the bound molecule.

         <title>TBAI&#8208;Catalysed Formal [4+4]&#8208;Cycloaddition: Easy Access to Oxa&#8208;Bridged Eight&#8208;Membered Heterocycles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A straightforward and atom&#8208;economical approach for the synthesis of oxa&#8208;bridged eight&#8208;membered heterocycles has been developed via TBAI&#8208;catalysed oxidative formal [4+4] cyclization of hydrazones with anthranils. This transformation involves the formation of two new C&#8722;N bonds and C&#8722;O bond in a one&#8208;pot manner, which breaks a limitation of anthranils in organic synthesis.







Abstract
TBAI&#8208;catalysed [4+4]&#8208;cyclization reaction of anthranils with hydrazones to deliver oxa&#8208;bridged eight&#8208;membered heterocycles in accepted yields was developed. Preliminary mechanistic studies indicated that the reaction involved the in&#8197;situ generation of vinyldiazenes from readily available hydrazones followed by an aza&#8208;Michael addition of the anthranil substrates onto the vinyldiazenes and subsequent annulation. This transformation involved the formation of two new C&#8722;N bonds and C&#8722;O bond in one pot, overcoming the synthetic limitations of anthranils in organic chemistry. This strategy benefits from high efficiency and atomic economy with mild reaction conditions.

This transformation involves the formation of two new C&#8722;N bonds and C&#8722;O bond in a one-pot manner, which breaks a limitation of anthranils in organic synthesis.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TBAI-catalysed [4+4]-cyclization reaction of anthranils with hydrazones to deliver oxa-bridged eight-membered heterocycles in accepted yields was developed. Preliminary mechanistic studies indicated that the reaction involved the in&#8197;situ generation of vinyldiazenes from readily available hydrazones followed by an aza-Michael addition of the anthranil substrates onto the vinyldiazenes and subsequent annulation. This transformation involved the formation of two new C&#8722;N bonds and C&#8722;O bond in one pot, overcoming the synthetic limitations of anthranils in organic chemistry. This strategy benefits from high efficiency and atomic economy with mild reaction conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dual Chemiexcitation by a Unique Dioxetane Scaffold Gated by an OR Logic Set of Triggers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of a unique 1,2&#8208;dioxetane chemiluminescent scaffold with chemiexcitation gated by an OR logic set of triggering events is reported. The scaffold was applied to design a chemiluminescent probe that is activated by the enzymes &#946;&#8208;galactosidase and alkaline phosphatase. The ability of the probe to detect the two enzymatic activities in bacteria was successfully demonstrated.







Abstract
Chemiexcitation of phenoxy&#8208;1,2&#8208;dioxetane chemiluminescent luminophores is initiated by electron transfer from a meta&#8208;positioned phenolate ion to the peroxide&#8208;dioxetane bond. Here we report the development of a unique 1,2&#8208;dioxetane chemiluminescent scaffold with chemiexcitation gated by an OR logic dual&#8208;set of triggering events. This scaffold is composed of meta&#8208;dihydroxyphenyl&#8208;1,2&#8208;dioxetane&#8208;adamantyl molecules, equipped with acrylic acid and chlorine substituents, that chemiexcitation under physiological conditions. A dual&#8208;mode chemiluminescent probe, armed with two different triggering substrates designed for activation by the enzymes &#946;&#8208;galactosidase and alkaline phosphatase, was synthesized. The probe emitted intense light signals in the response to each enzyme, demonstrating its ability to serve as a single&#8208;component chemiluminescent sensor for dual&#8208;analyte detection. We also demonstrated the ability of the probe to detect &#946;&#8208;galactosidase and phosphatase activities in bacteria. This is the first 1,2&#8208;dioxetane scaffold capable of responding to two different chemiexcitation events from two different positions on the same dioxetane molecule. We anticipate that the OR&#8208;gated mode of chemiexcitation, described herein, will find utility in the preparation of chemiluminescent probes with a dual&#8208;analyte detection/imaging mode.

         <title>Coinage Metal Bis(amidinate) Complexes as Building Blocks for Self&#8208;Assembled One&#8208;Dimensional Coordination Polymers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two different self&#8208;assembled one&#8208;dimensional heterobimetallic coordination polymer types were synthesized by combining newly designed metalloligands with [Zn(hfac)2] or [M(acac)2] (M=Ni/Co) as linker. These polymers show either a linear or zig zag structure in the solid state.







Abstract
The pyridyl functionalized amidinate [{PyC&#8801;CC(NDipp)2}Li(thf)2]n was used to synthesize a series of bis&#8208;amidinate complexes [{PyC&#8801;CC(NDipp)2}2M2] (M=Cu, Ag, Au) with fully supported metallophilic interactions. These metalloligands were then used as building blocks for the synthesis of one&#8208;dimensional heterobimetallic coordination polymers using Zn(hfac)2 (hfac=hexaflouroacetylacetonate) for self&#8208;assembly. Interestingly, the three coordination polymers [{PyC&#8801;CC(NDipp)2}2M2][Zn(hfac)2] (M=Cu, Ag, Au), exhibit a zig zag shape in the solid state. To achieve linear coordination geometry other connectors such as M&#8217;(acac) (M&#8217;=Ni, Co) (acac=acetylacetonate) were investigated. The thus obtained compounds [{PyC&#8801;CC(NDipp)2}2Cu2][M&#8217;(acac)2] (M&#8217;=Ni, Co) are indeed linear heterobimetallic coordination polymers featuring a metalloligand backbone with fully supported metallophilic interactions.

         <title>Sparkling Organic Phosphorescence from Fluorinated Tetrathia[7]helicenes: Synthesis and Photophysical, Electrochemical and Computational Studies</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Structure&#8208;property correlations in the thiahelicene family are often not trivial since most of the functional groups present on the helical scaffold modify the conjugation size of the &#960;&#8208;system. Selecting fluorine containing groups to provide strong inductive effects without interacting with low&#8208;lying orbitals of the system could be the way to overcome the issue. Here we report a study on three fluorine&#8208;functionalized tetrathia[7]helicenes highlighting interesting correlations between the position of the functional groups and the conjugated skeleton properties. Helicenes Heli&#8208;F2 and Heli&#8208;CF&#8208;F2 were prepared by photoinduced isomerization&#8208;electrocyclization (the Mallory photocyclization) of the corresponding fluorinated benzodithienyl&#8208;ethenes Alk&#8208;F2 and Alk&#8208;CF&#8208;F2, which were prepared, in high yields, through stereo&#8208;conservative Stille reaction. Notably these helicenes were found to display green phosphorescence around 530&#8211;550 nm and the studies suggest an efficient spin orbit coupling mechanism in these high&#8208;energy triplet non&#8208;planar conjugated molecules. Both helicenes and their precursors were thoroughly characterized by means of optical and electrochemical measurements while DFT calculations enable to define a rationale on their structure&#8208;property correlations.</dc:description>

         <title>Waxberry&#8208;like MnS/Ni3S4 as High&#8208;efficiency Bi&#8208;functional Catalyst for Zn&#8208;air Batteries</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In this paper, waxberry&#8208;liked MnS/Ni3S4 composite catalyst was designed and synthesized. In this core&#8208;shell structure, MnS is located inside and Ni3S4 is wrapped on the surface of MnS to form a spherical structure. This structure makes the material show excellent stability in the electrocatalytic process. The diffusion staggered region structure formed at the two&#8208;phase interface greatly enhances the synergistic interaction between MnS and Ni3S4. At the same time, the defects and vacancies formed by the diffusion mechanism at the interface of the two phases increase the active site and improve the interfacial electron transfer kinetics. Therefore, MnS/Ni3S4 composites showed excellent catalytic performance for ORR/OER. At 10 mA cm&#8208;2, the overpotential of it is only 320 mV, and the half&#8208;wave potential can reach 0.81 V. The catalyst also exhibited extraordinary cycle stability and small voltage gap when used as cathode of Zn&#8208;air batteries. When the current density is 3 mA cm&#8208;2, the cyclic discharge can be stable for 400h and the voltage difference between the front and back does not increase more than. When the current density increases to 5 mA cm&#8208;2, the cyclic charge and discharge can be stable for more than 300 h.</dc:description>

         <title>Biomimetic Synthesis of Organic Molecular&#8208;Doped Fluorescent Guanine Crystals with Pearlescence</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Biomimetic synthesis of guanine crystals has been focused in the last years.&#160;However, multi&#8208;functional guanine crystals occluded with fluorescent molecules have not been realized in laboratory. Here, the controllable synthesis of guanine crystal microplatelets with fluorescent property and pearlescence was achieved for the first time by incorporating Nile red (NR) or fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) molecule into guanine crystals. The synthesized fluorescent guanine crystals are pure &#946;&#8208;phase anhydrous guanine single crystals. Aqueous suspensions with NR&#8208; and FITC&#8208;doped guanine crystals exhibit distinct pearlescence. The fluorescence intensities of NR and FITC were greatly enhanced after being doped into guanine crystals due to the inhibition of aggregation&#8208;caused quenching. Moreover, films composed of fluorescent guanine microplatelets exhibit high diffuse reflection intensity (70%). This work provides a strategy to synthesize multifunctional materials composed of organic crystals occluded with dyes.</dc:description>

         <title>A Playground for Heavy Atom Tunnelling: Neutral Substitutional Defect Rearrangement from Diamondoids to Diamonds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Many diamond properties are defined by substitutional defects (i.e. a carbon atom replaced by another element), which may involve the formation of structural isomers that can interconvert. Herein, we analysed by computational means the structure, thermodynamics, and kinetics of substitutional nitrogen, boron, and oxygen from small diamondoids up to the diamond bulk, focusing on the possibility of heavy atom quantum tunnelling rearrangement between the isomers. The large range of threshold energies and bond lengths lead to a variety of intriguing behaviours, including cage size dependent thermally activated tunnelling of nitrogen, and quantum delocalization of boron. In addition, we predict that applying an external electric field makes it possible to control the rearrangement thermodynamics and kinetics through tunnelling, which lets us hypothesize that these systems can potentially be used as atomic memory devices.</dc:description>

         <title>Organic&#8208;Inorganic Phenolic/POSS Hybrids Provide Highly Ordered Mesoporous Structures Templated by High Thermal Stability of PS&#8208;b&#8208;P4VP Diblock Copolymer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Anionic living polymerization was used to prepare a diblock copolymer of poly(styrene&#8208;b&#8208;4&#8208;vinyl pyridine) (PS&#8208;b&#8208;P4VP), and a phenolic resin with a double&#8208;decker silsesquioxane (DDSQ) cage structure was used to form a phenolic/DDSQ hybrid (PDDSQ&#8208;30 with 30 wt% DDSQ). Strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding could be confirmed through the hydroxyl (OH) groups of PDDSQ hybrid with the pyridine group of the P4VP block in PDDSQ&#8208;30/PS&#8208;b&#8208;P4VP blends based on Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analyses, where increasing PDDSQ concentrations resulted in a higher proportion of hydrogen&#8208;bonded pyridine groups. After thermal polymerization at 180 oC, the self&#8208;assembled structures of these PDDSQ/PS&#8208;b&#8208;P4VP blends were revealed by data from small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), where the d&#8208;spacing increased with raising PDDSQ concentration. Because relatively higher thermal stability of the PDDSQ hybrid than pure phenolic resin and PS&#8208;b&#8208;P4VP template, we can obtain the long ranger order of mesoporous PDDSQ hybrids after removing the PS&#8208;b&#8208;P4VP template, which reveals the high surface area and high pore volume with cylindrical and spherical structures corresponding to the PDDSQ compositions that are rarely observed by using pure phenolic resin as the matrix and could be used in supercapacitor application.</dc:description>

         <title>Formate additive for efficient and stable methylammonium&#8208;free perovskite solar cells by gas&#8208;quenching</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>In order to promote the commercialization of perovskite solar cells, gas&#8208;quenching is considered to be a promising technique for perovskite film fabrication. However, when handling with methylammonium&#8208;free (MA&#8208;free) perovskites, it is often difficult to obtain high&#8208;quality perovskite films by gas&#8208;quenching. Herein, formate additives are employed to regulate the crystallization of MA&#8208;free perovskite, and improve the quality of perovskite films. Different additives of formamidine formate (FAFO) and potassium formate (KFO) is compared to investigate the role of formate groups in the crystallization of perovskite films prepared by gas&#8208;quenching. The FAFO additive facilitates the perovskite crystallization in (001) orientation whereas KFO favors for (111) orientation. The MA&#8208;free device with addition of FAFO demonstrate a champion power conversion efficiency of 20.94%, compared to that of 20.14% for KFO devices. In addition, FAFO device also exhibits improved thermal stability in ambient condition without encapsulation, extending the T80 lifetime by 18 times compared to the pristine device.</dc:description>

Upon oxidation of 1[PF6], (L&#8226;N4)2&#8208; loses one electron to be the strong electron&#8208;attracting ligand (LOxN4)&#8208; and the intermediate&#8208;spin five&#8208;coordinated FeIII (S = 3/2) becomes a low&#8208;spin six&#8208;coordinated FeIII (S = 1/2) in 2[PF6]4.

         <title>Structural and synthetic insights on oxidative homocouplings of alkynes mediated by alkali&#8208;metal manganates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Exploiting bimetallic cooperation alkali&#8208;metal manganate(II) complexes can efficiently promote oxidative homocoupling of terminal alkynes furnishing an array of conjugated 1,3&#8208;diynes. The influence of the alkali&#8208;metal on these C&#8208;C bond forming processes has been studied by preparing and structurally characterizing the alkali metal tetra(alkyl) manganates [(TMEDA)2Na2Mn(CH2SiMe3)4] and [(PMDETA)2K2Mn(CH2SiMe3)4]. Reactivity studies using phenylacetylene as a model substrate have revealed that for the homocoupling to take place initial metalation of the alkyne is required. In this regard, the lack of basicity of neutral Mn(CH2SiMe3)2 precludes the formation of the diyne. Contrastingly, the tetra(alkyl) alkali&#8208;metal manganates behave as polybasic reagents, being able to easily deprotonate phenylacetylene yielding [{(THF)4Na2Mn(C&#8801;CPh)4}&#8734;] and [(THF)4Li2Mn(C&#8801;CPh)4]. Controlled exposure of [{(THF)4Na2Mn(C&#8801;CPh)4}&#8734;] and [(THF)4Li2Mn(C&#8801;CPh)4] to dry air confirmed their intermediary in formation of 1,4&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;1,3&#8208;butadiyne in excellent yields. While the Na/Mn(II) partnership proved to be the most efficient in stoichiometric transformations, under catalytic regimes, the combination of MC&#8801;CAr (M= Li, Na) and MnCl2 (6 mol%) only works for lithium, most likely due to the degradation of alkynylsodiums under the aerobic reaction conditions.</dc:description>

         <title>&#955;3&#8208; and &#955;5&#8208;Iodanes: Substituent Effects and Pseudorotation/ Hypervalent Twisting</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hypervalent iodine (III and V) compounds exhibit positional isomerization through pseudorotation or twisting; the latter have been invoked for the stability as well as the reactivities of &#955;3&#8208; and &#955;5&#8208;iodanes. By judicious exploitation of sterics, the twisting process in iodanes can be facilitated to promote reactivity. For example, ortho&#8208;substitution in &#955;3&#8208; and &#955;5&#8208;iodanes accelerates &#945;&#8208;tosyloxylation of ketones and oxidation of alcohols. The enhancement of reactivity arises from sterically&#8208;induced non&#8208;planarity and the resultant weakening of the 3c&#8208;4e bonds involving the hypervalent iodine atom. The ortho&#8208;substitution constitutes an important strategy to maneuver reactivity, control selectivity, and develop new catalysts, including chiral, for diverse reactions. This review entails coverage of the literature developments in regard to the effect of substituents and twisting/pseudorotation on the stability as well as the reactivity of hypervalent &#955;3&#8208; and &#955;5&#8208;iodanes, and the application of the latter for synthetic transformations.</dc:description>

This review entails coverage of the literature developments in regard to the effect of substituents and twisting/pseudorotation on the stability as well as the reactivity of hypervalent &#955;3- and &#955;5-iodanes, and the application of the latter for synthetic transformations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unveiling Photodegradation and Photosensitization Mechanisms of Unconjugated Pterins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Unconjugated pterins are ubiquitous molecules participating in countless enzymatic processes and potentially involved in the photosensitization of singlet oxygen, amino acids, and nucleotides. Following electronic excitation with UV&#8208;A light, some of these pterins degrade, producing hydrogen peroxide as the main side product. This process, that is known to take place in vivo, contributes to oxidative stress and melanocyte destruction in vitiligo. In this work, we present for the first time mechanistic insight to the formation of transient triplet species which simultaneously trigger Type I and Type II photosensitizing processes and the initiation of degradation processes. Our calculations reveal that photodegradation of 6&#8208;biopterin, which accumulates in the skin of vitiligo patients, leads to 6&#8208;formylpterin via retro&#8208;aldol reaction, and subsequently to 6&#8208;carboxypterin through a water&#8208;mediated aldehyde oxidation. Additionally, we show that the changes in the photosensitizing potential of these systems with pH come from the modulation of their excited&#8208;state redox potentials.</dc:description>

         <title>Phase&#8208;Dependent Long Persistent Phosphorescence in Coumarin&#8208;Phosphine&#8208;Based Coinage Metal Complexes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A coumarin functionalized aminodiphosphine has been introduced as a bidentate ligand in coinage metal chemistry. Mono&#8208;, di&#8208; and trimetallic copper and silver complexes were synthesized by using this ligand. A hybrid character of the ligand led to compounds with rich luminescence properties. These include coumarin&#8208;based blue fluorescence, observed as a sole emission in solution at room temperature, and green phosphorescence which is efficient at low temperatures and dominates the spectra of the metal complexes. In the rigid environment of frozen solutions, the green phosphorescence shows an unusually long (for metal complexes) decay on the time scale over seconds in high quantum yields. In addition, a red phosphorescence, which may be assigned to the triplet state localized in the phosphine&#8208;M3Cl2 (M = Cu, Ag), is observed for the trinuclear complexes at low temperature. Neither the second&#8208;long phosphorescence nor the red emission, are observed for coumarin ligand and thus, are a result of the coordination to coinage metal clusters. The excited states in these compounds were also investigated by femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy and quantum chemical calculations.</dc:description>

         <title>Caffeine biodegradation by cytochrome P450 1A2. What determines the product distributions?</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Caffeine is a natural compound found in plant seeds that after consumption by humans effects the central nervous system as well as the cardiovascular system. In general, the cytochrome P450 enzymes in the liver are involved in the biodegradation of caffeine, which gives paraxanthine, theobromine and theophylline products. There has been debate for many years why multiple products are obtained and how their distributions are determined. To this end we performed a high&#8208;level computational study using a combination of molecular dynamics and quantum mechanical approaches. A series of quantum chemical cluster models on the mechanism of caffeine activation by P450 model complexes give hydrogen atom abstraction barriers that predicts the correct ordering and statistical distribution of products. Our studies highlight that second&#8208;coordination sphere effects and thermochemical properties of the substrate determine the product distributions.</dc:description>

         <title>Intermetallic Compound TiM (M = Co, Fe) with a Layered Structure Prepared by Deoxidizing Ilmenite&#8208;type Oxides in Molten LiCl&#8211;CaH2 Mixtures</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>CsCl&#8208;type intermetallic compounds TiM (M = Co, Fe) were obtained by deoxidizing trigonal ilmenite&#8208;type MTiO3 with a reducing agent CaH2 in molten LiCl at 600&#176;C. X&#8208;ray diffraction, nitrogen adsorption, scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy with energy&#8208;dispersive X&#8208;ray, and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses revealed the formation of nanoscale layered structures, which enhanced specific surface areas (~20 m2/g) in the intermetallic compounds. In the initial deoxidation stage, Li2TiO3&#8208;like compounds were observed as an intermediate, suggesting the substitution of M in MTiO3 by Li from the molten LiCl. MTiO3 has a layered structure perpendicular to the c&#8208;axis of the trigonal structure, suggesting that the layered structures may originate from the crystal structure of the precursors. Formation of the Li2TiO3&#8208;like intermediate may help maintain the original layered structure during deoxidation and the subsequent alloying at temperatures as low as 600&#176;C.</dc:description>

         <title>Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Deoxynitrogenation of Carboxylic Acids with Cyanamides to Access Nitriles</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Efficient strategies to access nitriles from common organic functionalities are highly important, given their significance in synthetic and medicinal chemistry. Although the direct transformation of carboxylic acids to nitriles have been explored for decades, there is few general and practical protocol to access nitriles from carboxylic acid precursors. Herein, we describe an iron&#8208;catalyzed deoxynitrogenaton strategy to convert carboxylic acids into nitriles. This method utilizes a cyanamide as the recyclable nitrogen donor and deoxygenating reagent, operates broadly across aryl, alkenyl, and alkyl carboxylic acids, and features an easy setup without inert gas protection. The synthetic value of this method is demonstrated by application in late&#8208;stage modification of drug molecules, synthesis of a pharmaceutical structure, and scaleup reactions and downstream derivatizations.</dc:description>

         <title>Quantitative Electromerism of a Well&#8208;defined Mononuclear Copper Complex Through Reversible Intramolecular Metal&#8208;Ligand Electron Transfer</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Copper amine oxidases are enzymes that exhibit in their active site a mononuclear copper complex and a 2,4,5&#8208;trihydroxyphenylalanine quinone (TPQ) cofactor; in the oxidative half of the catalytic cycle, the enzymes regulate their activity by a temperature&#8208;dependent electron transfer equilibrium between the CuII complex with the reduced, aminoquinol form of the cofactor and the reactive CuI complex with the corresponding oxidized, semiquinone form of the cofactor. Here, we report the first mononuclear copper complex with redox&#8208;active ligands showing quantitative, reversible electromerism between a CuII eletromer with reduced, neutral ligand and a CuI electromer with an oxidized, radical monocationic ligand. The CuII form, being exclusively present at low temperature, exhibits a lower enthalpy (like the enzymes), but the CuI complex exhibits a higher entropy and is exclusively present at room temperature in CH2Cl2 solution. Further analysis, based on six different copper complexes, discloses a large solvent effect on electromerism.</dc:description>

Here, we report the first mononuclear copper complex with redox-active ligands showing quantitative, reversible electromerism between a CuII eletromer with reduced, neutral ligand and a CuI electromer with an oxidized, radical monocationic ligand. The CuII form, being exclusively present at low temperature, exhibits a lower enthalpy (like the enzymes), but the CuI complex exhibits a higher entropy and is exclusively present at room temperature in CH2Cl2 solution. Further analysis, based on six different copper complexes, discloses a large solvent effect on electromerism.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Silver&#8208;based Terpyridine Complexes as Antitumor Agents</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Silver complexes bearing substituted terpyridine or tetra&#8208;2&#8208;pyridinylpyrazine ligands have been prepared and structurally characterised. The study of the anticancer properties of silver complexes with this type of ligands is scarce, despite the possibilities of combining the properties of the metal and the ability of the ligands for DNA binding. Here, the antiproliferative activity, stability, CT&#8208;DNA binding and mechanism of cell death of these types of derivatives are studied. High cytotoxicity against different tumour cells was observed, and, more important, a great selectivity index has been detected between tumour cells and healthy Lymphocytes T for some of these compounds. The CT&#8208;DNA interaction study has shown that these derivatives are be able to interact with CT&#8208;DNA via moderate intercalation. Furthermore, cell death studies indicate that these derivatives promote the apoptosis via mitochondrial pathway.</dc:description>

         <title>Ionic liquid&#8208;mediated approach for the synthesis of site&#8208;specific thioether conjugates</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Site&#8208;specific conjugation approaches are of great importance in drug discovery, notably for the synthesis of biochemical probes or molecular conjugates for targeted delivery. Herein, we report a mild ionic liquid (IL)&#8208;mediated thiolation technique that relies on the use of 1,3&#8208;ethyl&#8208;methyl imidazolium acetate, [C2mim][OAc] as a solvent and precursor to generate activated IL, as well as a solvent for the conjugation reaction. First, a focused library of active ILs was prepared for functionalizing/conjugating cysteine&#8208;containing small molecules and unprotected peptides. Interestingly, a bifunctional active IL could also be successfully employed as a linker for the conjugation of peptides lacking Cys. This study sets the ground for further investigation of the use of active ILs for modifying, labeling or conjugating larger and more complex therapeutic modalities such as proteins and antibodies.</dc:description>

Reacting 1 with group 14 nucleophiles revealed different organo&#8208;substituted P5R middle&#8208;decks depending on the steric and electronic effects of the used alkali metal organyls (2: R = tBu; 3: R = Me). With group 15 nucleophiles, first isolatable monosubstituted complexes with phosphanides could be obtained as P5 ligands containing exocyclic {PR2} units (4: R = Cy, H; 5: R = Ph). These monoanionic complexes 2&#8208;5 were isolated and electrophilic quenching revealed novel types of neutral functionalized polyphosphorus complexes.

         <title>Inverting the Electronic Structure of Diylidylgermylenes by Backbone Modification</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Owing to the strong electron&#8208;donating ability of ylide substituents, diylidyltetrylenes are usually highly nucleophilic species with strong donor capacities. Here, we demonstrate that their electronic properties are in fact highly flexible and can be effectively tuned through variation of the substituent in the ylide backbone. Initial density functional theory studies showed that cyano groups are particularly capable in lowering the LUMO energy of diylidyl germylenes thus turning these usually highly nucleophilic species into electrophilic compounds. This was confirmed by experimental studies. Attempts to synthesize the germylene (YCN)2Ge [with YCN = Ph3P&#8208;(C)&#8208;CN] from the corresponding metalated ylides YCNK selectively led to germanide [(YCN)3Ge)K]2 thus reflecting the electrophilic nature of the intermediate formed germylene. XRD analysis of single crystals of (YCN)2Ge &#8208; serendipitously obtained through protonative cleavage of one ylide from the germanide &#8208; revealed a monomeric structure with rather long Ge&#8208;ylide linkages, which corroborates well with a pure single bond and no stabilization of the empty p&#960; orbital at germanium through pi bonding. The germanide exhibits methanide&#8208;like reactivity towards chalcogens but a likewise weak Ge&#8208;C bond as demonstrated by the insertion of carbon dioxide.</dc:description>

         <title>Dynamic Metalloporphyrin&#8208;Based [2]Rotaxane Molecular Shuttles Stimulated by Neutral Lewis Base and Anion Co&#8208;ordination</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A series of dynamic metalloporphyrin [2]rotaxane molecular shuttles comprising of bis&#8208;functionalised Zn(II) porphyrin axle and pyridyl functionalised macrocycle components are prepared in high yield via active metal template synthetic methodology. Extensive variable temperature 1H NMR and quantitative UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopic titration studies demonstrate dynamic macrocycle translocation is governed by an inter&#8208;component co&#8208;ordination interaction between the macrocycle pyridyl and axle Zn(II) metalloporphyrin, which serves to bias a &#8216;resting state&#8217; co&#8208;conformation. The dynamic shuttling behaviour of the interlocked structures is dramatically inhibited by the addition of a neutral Lewis base such as pyridine, but can also be tuned via post&#8208;synthetic rotaxane demetallation of the porphyrin axle core to give free&#8208;base, or upon subsequent metallation, Ni(II) [2]rotaxane analogues. Importantly, the Lewis acidic Zn(II) porphyrin axle component is also capable of coordinating anions which induces mechanical bond shuttling behaviour resulting in a novel optical sensing response.</dc:description>

         <dc:description>A tyrosine (Tyr)&#8208; or tryptophan (Trp)&#8208;selective metal&#8208;free C&#8722;H sulfenylation reaction using an acid&#8208;activated S&#8208;acetamidomethyl cysteine (Cys) sulfoxide, Cys(Acm)(O), has been achieved. The dually protonated intermediate produced from the Cys(Acm)(O) under acidic conditions allows the sulfenylation of Tyr. Significantly, the reaction in the presence of trimethylsilyl trifluoromethanesulfonate (TMSOTf) mainly affords a Cys&#8208;Tyr&#8208;linked peptide even in the presence of Trp residues. In contrast, a Cys&#8208;Trp&#8208;linked peptide was selectively obtained from the reaction in the presence of guanidine hydrochloride (Gn&#183;HCl) under acidic conditions. Established Tyr&#8208; and Trp&#8208;selective sulfenylation methods were used in the Cys&#8208;Tyr stapling and Trp&#8208;lipidation of glucagon&#8208;like peptides in a one&#8208;pot/stepwise manner. Investigation of the mechanism showed that orbital&#8208; and charge&#8208;controlled reactions are responsible for the Trp and Tyr selectivity, respectively.</dc:description>

         <title>Development of the Safe and Broad&#8208;Spectrum Aldehyde and Ketoamide Mpro inhibitors Derived from the Constrained &#945;, &#947;&#8208;AA Peptide Scaffold</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 is still wreaking havoc all over the world with surging morbidity and high mortality. The main protease (Mpro) is essential in the replication of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2, enabling itself an active target for antiviral development. Herein, we reported the design and synthesis of a new class of peptidomimetics&#8208;constrained &#945;, &#947;&#8208;AApeptides, based on which a series of aldehyde and ketoamide inhibitors of the Mpro of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 were prepared. The lead compounds showed excellent inhibitory activity in the FRET&#8208;based Mpro enzymatic assay not only for the Mpro of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 but also for SARS&#8208;CoV and MERS&#8208;CoV, along with HCoVs like HCoV&#8208;OC43, HCoV&#8208;229E, HCoV&#8208;NL63 and HKU1. The X&#8208;ray crystallographic results demonstrated that our compounds form a covalent bond with the catalytic Cys145. They also demonstrated effective antiviral activity against live SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. Overall, the results suggest that &#945;, &#947;&#8208;AApeptide could be a promising molecular scaffold in designing novel Mpro inhibitors of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 and other coronaviruses.</dc:description>

         <title>A Late&#8208;Stage Aryl C&#8208;H Olefination Strategy and Its Application Towards Global Proteome Profiling of &#8710;8&#8208;Tetrahydrocannabinol</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Drugs and bioactive natural products exert their pharmacological effects by engaging numerous cellular targets in our body. Identification of these protein targets is essential for understanding the mechanism&#8208;of&#8208;action of these compounds, thus contributing to improved drug design in drug discovery programs. Termed &#8220;in situ drug profiling&#8221;, a common strategy for studying these bioactive compounds centralized on the covalent capture of protein targets along with a reporter tag to facilitate downstream proteomic analyses. Though highly successful, such a strategy required innate electrophilic traps to facilitate covalent capture, and its dependence on classical alkylation/acylation strategies to install reporter tags has restricted its applications on non&#8208;covalent compounds. Late&#8208;stage C&#8208;H functionalization (LSF) may resolve this by substituting biologically inert C&#8208;H bonds with desired electrophilic groups. Herein, we demonstrated this concept by arming a diverse range of electron&#8208;rich aromatic drugs and natural products with &#945;,&#946;&#8208;unsaturated esters, via late&#8208;stage C&#8208;H olefination with a arylthio&#8208;based carboxylic acid ligand developed by Ibanez and co&#8208;workers. We also showed that covalent probes generated from this LSF approach could be applied for &#8220;in situ drug profiling&#8221; of &#8710;8&#8208;THC, as exemplified by the successful target engagement of &#945;&#8208;4db, a &#8710;8&#8208;THC&#8208;based probe, to its native target hCB2R. In combination with probe 7, a photoaffinity&#8208;based derivative of &#8710;8&#8208;THC, we identified several novel putative targets that could account for some of the effects in THC consumption. We anticipate our C&#8208;H LSF strategy to be widely adopted for future studies of non&#8208;covalent drugs.</dc:description>

         <title>Nanoscale probing of the supramolecular assembly in a two&#8208;component gel by near&#8208;field infrared spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The design of soft biomaterials requires a deep understanding of molecular self&#8208;assembly. We introduce here a nanoscale infrared (IR) spectroscopy study of a two&#8208;component supramolecular gel to assess the system&#180;s heterogeneity and supramolecular assembly. In contrast to far&#8208;field IR spectroscopy, near&#8208;field IR spectroscopy revealed differences in the secondary structures of the gelator molecules and non&#8208;covalent interactions at three distinct nano&#8208;locations of the gel network. A &#946;&#8208;sheet arrangement is dominant in single and parallel fibres with a small proportion of an &#945;&#8208;helix present, while the molecular assembly derives from strong hydrogen bonding. However, at the crossing point of two fibres, only the &#946;&#8208;sheet motif is observed, with an intense &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking contribution. Near&#8208;field nanospectroscopy can become a powerful tool for the nanoscale distinction of non&#8208;covalent interactions, while is expected to advance the existing spectroscopic assessments of supramolecular gels.</dc:description>

         <title>Photocatalytic Aerobic Cyclization of N&#8208;Propargylamides Enabled by Selenium&#8208;&#960;&#8208;Acid Catalysis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A dual catalytic approach combining photocatalyst and selenium&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acid synergy has been used to cyclized of N&#8208;propargylamides. This method offers readily access to oxazole aldehydes under chemical oxidant&#8208;free conditions with low catalyst loadings, where air acts as a terminal and gratuitous oxidant. The reaction is demonstrated with a range of substrates, including aryl and alkyl propargyl amides, and in the late&#8208;stage functionalization of several amide&#8208;containing drug molecules. Mechanistic studies suggest that the acridinium catalyst is able to oxidize diselenide and generate singlet oxygen (1O2), which is responsible for this transformation.</dc:description>

         <title>Exchange Interactions and Magnetic Properties of a Molecular Mn18&#8208;Ring Complex</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>[Mn3O(OAc)7(HOAc)]6&#183;xAcOH (x = 6&#8211;9) represents a rare example of a compound containing molecular Mn18&#8208;rings. These are formed by Mn3(&#181;3&#8208;O) subunits in which the high&#8208;spin Mn(III) centers are bridged by three pairs of acetate anions (AcO&#8722;). An AcOH molecule coordinates to one of the Mn atoms leading to [Mn3(&#181;3&#8208;O)(&#181;2&#8208;OAc)6(AcOH)]&#8208;units, designated in short as Mn3&#8208;units, that are interconnected by acetate anions via the other two Mn atoms to form Mn18&#8208;rings. Magnetic measurements show weak ferromagnetic interactions between them that are suppressed in strong magnetic field. Quantum&#8208;chemical calculations on Mn3 model complexes using independently DFT and ab&#8208;initio multi reference methods (CASSCF/NEVPT2) show a correlation between the orientation of the pseudo&#8208;Jahn&#8208;Teller axes of pairs of Mn(III) magnetic centers and corresponding exchange coupling energies. Weak coupling between Mn3&#8208;units within the Mn18&#8208;ring allowed to simulate the magnetic susceptibility vs temperature dependence in terms of basically uncoupled magnetic moments of each Mn3&#8208;unit within the ring.</dc:description>

         <title>Oxanorbornene&#8208;Fused Phenazine&#8211;Pyrene Scaffolds with Different Configurations</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>New molecular scaffolds of C&#8208;, Z&#8208; and box&#8208;shaped configurations are constructed by fusing phenazine and pyrene units with oxanorbornene. As revealed by X&#8208;ray crystallography, the C&#8208;shaped molecules exhibit two interesting &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking modes of phenazine depending on the substituting groups, and the box&#8208;shaped molecule accommodates two chloroform molecules in the cavity and forms H&#8208;bonds with another four molecules of chloroform. The C&#8208; and Z&#8208;shaped molecules as a pair of diastereomers exhibit almost the same charge transfer absorption and emission including positive solvatochromism, indicating that the intramolecular charge transfer between pyrene (&#960;&#8208;donor) and phenazine (&#960;&#8208;acceptor) is not dependent on the overall molecular geometry.</dc:description>

         <title>Bioactivities of Triazolium&#8208;Based N&#8208;Heterocyclic Carbene Salts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>1,2,4&#8208;Triazolium salts are precursors of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs), which have been extensively used as effective catalysts and ligands for both asymmetric and non&#8208;enantioselective reactions. Nevertheless, they are also a kind of quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs) that possess amphipathic properties. The unique chemical and physical properties of 1,2,4&#8208;triazolium salts have received significant attention from scientists focusing on the development of novel bioactive molecules as pesticides and medicines. It is timely and meaningful to summarize the bioactivities of 1,2,4&#8208;triazolium salt derivatives against various bacteria, fungi, cancer cells, and other pathogens in the past 30 years. Meanwhile, the structure&#8208;activity relationship (SAR) of 1,2,4&#8208;triazolium salts was also summarized. The prospective on the future development and applications of triazolium salts as agrichemicals or human drugs have been presented here on my own opinions of the end of this concept.</dc:description>

         <title>Electronic Structure and Aromaticity of an Unusual Cyclo[18]carbon Precursor, C18Br6</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Herein, the electronic structure and bonding character of the stable cyclo[18]carbon (C18) precursor, C18Br6, are thoroughly characterized by molecular orbital (MO), density of states (DOS), bond order (BO), and interaction region indicator (IRI) analyses. The delocalization characters of out&#8208;of&#8208;plane and in&#8208;plane &#960;&#8208;electrons (labeled as &#960;out&#8208; and &#960;in&#8208;electrons, respectively) in bonding regions are examined using localized orbital locator (LOL) and electron localization function (ELF). Then, the aromaticity is addressed via the molecular magnetic response to external magnetic field by computing the magnetically induced current density (Jind), iso&#8208;chemical shielding surface (ICSS), anisotropy of the induced current density (AICD), and the induced magnetic field (Bind). All these analyses indicate that C18Br6 is a globally aromatic species with lower aromaticity than C18, and the blocking of in&#8208;plane &#960;&#8208; conjugation (labeled as &#960;in&#8208;conjugation) by the presence of &#8208;Br substituents in it is the underlying cause for the weakening of molecular aromaticity.</dc:description>

         <title>De&#8208;risking S&#8208;F bond formation:A gas cylinder&#8208;free strategy to access S(IV) and S(VI) fluorinated compounds.</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The sulfur&#8208;fluorine partnership occupies a privileged position in fluorine chemistry given the functional versatility that it imparts to organic structures. Despite this, available methodologies to forge S&#8211;F bonds are limited compared to C&#8211;F bond formation. Here, we describe a synthetic protocol that selectively enables the oxidative halogenation of aliphatic, aromatic, and heteroaromatic thiols to their corresponding SF4Cl, SO2F and SF3 derivatives. Selective oxidation of thiols to either S(IV)&#8211;F or S(VI)&#8211;F compounds is achieved by employing bench&#8208;stable calcium hypochlorite as chlorine surrogate (CLOgen), in the presence of KF as fluoride source. DFT calculations provided insight into the mechanistic aspects of the transformation and rationalized the observed isomeric preference towards the SF4Cl derivatives. Ultimately, this glovebox&#8208;free method selectively dispatches three classes of compounds upon reaction condition fine&#8208;tuning. Furthermore, first&#8208;in&#8208;class transformations are reported, including the preparation of aliphatic SF4Cl intermediates, their transformation into aliphatic sulfur pentafluoride analogs, and post&#8208;transformations that allow accessing highly complex SF4&#8208;bridged scaffolds.</dc:description>

         <title>Hydrogen Bonding Parameters by Rapid Colorimetric Assessment: Evaluation of Structural Components Found in Biological Ligands and Organocatalysts</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Hydrogen bonding is a key molecular interaction in biological processes, drug delivery, and catalysis. This report describes a high throughput UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopic method to measure hydrogen bonding capacity using a pyrazinone sensor. This colormetric sensor reversibly binds to a hydrogen bond donor, resulting in a blue shift as additional equivalents of donor are added. Titration with excess equivalents of donor is used to determine the binding coefficient, ln(Keq). Over 100 titrations were performed for a variety of biologically relevant compounds. This data enabled development a multiple linear regression model that is capable of predicting 95% of ln(Keq) values within 1 unit, allowing for the estimation of hydrogen bonding affinity from a single measurement. To show the effectiveness of the single point measurements, hydrogen bond strengths were obtained for a set of carboxylic acid bioisosteres. The values from the single point measurements were validated with full titrations.</dc:description>

         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Here we report an efficient access to high&#8208;value N&#8208;polyfluoroalkyl anilines, primary polyfluoroalkylamines and N,N&#8209;bis(polyfluoroalkyl)amines, via N&#8209;polyfluoroalkylation of sulfonamides and phthalimide derivatives using sulfuryl fluoride (SO2F2). The in situ formation of polyfluoroalkyl fluorosulfonates from commercially available fluorinated alcohols and economical sulfuryl fluoride is highly advantageous given that some polyfluoroalkyl halides are ozone&#8209;depleting substances (ODS) regulated by the Montreal protocol. This general method is applied to the polyfluoroalkylation of a variety of sulfonamides, N&#8208;sulfonyl carbamates and phthalimide with a wide tolerance of functional groups. The process thus provides viable access for industry to N&#8208;(polyfluoroalkyl)anilines as well as primary and secondary N&#8209;(polyfluoroalkyl)amines, which are very valuable but not easily accessible building blocks for life science applications.</dc:description>

         <title>Oxidation State Tuning of Room Temperature Phosphorescence and Delayed Fluorescence in Phenothiazine and Phenothiazine&#8208;5,5&#8208;dioxide Dimers</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Heterocyclic dimers consisting of combinations of butterfly&#8208;shaped phenothiazine (PTZ) and its chemically oxidized form phenothiazine&#8208;5,5&#8208;dioxide (PTZSO2) have been synthesized. A twist is imposed across the dimers by ortho&#8208;substituents including methyl ethers, sulfides and sulfones. X&#8208;ray crystallography, cyclic voltammetry and optical spectroscopy, underpinned by computational studies, have been employed to study the interplay between the oxidation state, conformational restriction, and emission mechanisms including thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and room temperature phosphorescence (RTP). While the PTZSO2 dimers are simple fluorophores, the presence of PTZ induces triplet&#8208;mediated emission with a mixed PTZ&#8208;PTZSO2 dimer displaying concentration dependent hallmarks of both TADF and RTP.</dc:description>

         <title>Structural complexity in the apparently simple crystal structure of Be2Ru</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The structural features of the hexagonal layered crystal structure of Be2Ru (a = 5.7508(3) &#197;, c = 3.0044(2) &#197;, space group P &#8208;62m) were investigated by single crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The residual electron density and high&#8208;resolution TEM images show that the real structure can be described as an intergrowth of the main hexagonal matrix of the Fe2P type with minor orthorhombic inclusions of its stacking variants. Such atomic arrangement is stabilized by the charge transfer from Be to Ru and by a system of polar three&#8208; and four&#8208;atomic bonds involving both components. The calculated electronic density of states (DOS) of Be2Ru revealed, contrarily to typical intermetallic compounds, a pseudo gap (dip) in the vicinity of the Fermi level. The temperature dependence of the electrical resistivity of Be2Ru shows metal behavior in agreement with the non&#8208;zero DOS at the Fermi level.</dc:description>

         <title>HAV&#8208;peptides attached to colloidal probes faithfully detect E&#8208;cadherins displayed on living cells</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Cell adhesion molecules are crucial for a variety of biological&#160;processes, including wound healing, barrier formationand tissue homeostasis. One of them is E&#8208;cadherin&#160;which is generally found at adherent junctions between epithelialcells. To identify this molecule on the surface of&#160;cells, E&#8208;cadherin mimetic peptides with a critical aminoacid sequence of HAV (histidine&#8208;alanine&#8208;valine) were synthesized&#160;and attached to solid supported membranes coveringcolloidal probes. Two different functionalization strategies&#160;were established, one based on complexation of DOGSNTA(Ni) with a polyhistidine&#8208;tagged HAV&#8208;peptide and the&#160;other one relying on the formation of a HAV&#8208;lipopeptide usingin situ maleimide&#8208;thiol coupling. Binding studies were&#160;performed to verify the ability of the peptides to attachto the membrane surface. Compared to the non&#8208;covalent&#160;attachment via the His&#8208;tag, we achieved a higher yield bylipopeptide formation. Colloidal probes functionalized with&#160;HAV&#8208;peptides were employed to measure the presence of Ecadherinson living cells either using video particle tracking&#160;or force spectroscopy. Here, human HaCaT cells were examinedconfirming the specific interaction of the HAV&#8208;peptide&#160;with the E&#8208;cadherin of the cells. Statistical methods werealso used to determine the number of single&#8208;bond ruptures&#160;and the force of a single bond. These findings may be essentialfor the development of novel biosynthetic materials&#160;given their potential to become increasingly relevant in medicalapplications.</dc:description>

         <title>Diverse Roles of ScSERF in Modifying the Fibril Growth of Amyloidogenic Proteins</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>The aggregation of amyloidogenic proteins is often related to the occurrence of neurodegenerative diseases including fused in sarcoma protein (FUS) in frontotemporal lobar degeneration and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis diseases. Recently, the SERF protein family has been reported to have a significant regulatory effect on amyloid formation, but it is still unclear about the detailed mechanisms SERF acted on different amyloidogenic proteins. Here, we use nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and fluorescence spectroscopy to explore interactions of ScSERF with three amyloidogenic proteins FUS&#8208;LC, FUS&#8208;Core, and &#945;&#8208;Synuclein. NMR chemical shift perturbations reveal they share similar interaction sites on the N&#8208;terminal region of ScSERF. However, the amyloid formation of &#945;&#8208;Synuclein protein is accelerated by ScSERF, while the fibrosis of FUS&#8208;Core and FUS&#8208;LC protein is inhibited by ScSERF. Both the primary nucleation and the total amount of fibrils produced are detained. Our results suggest a diverse role of ScSERF in regulating the fibril growth of amyloidogenic proteins.</dc:description>

         <title>Spin in organic cocrystals</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Organic spintronics has caused a huge revolution in creating highly&#8208;efficient low&#8208;power circuits. Spin manipulation in organic cocrystals has become a promising strategy to uncover more chemicophysical properties for diverse applications. In this Minireview, we summarize the recent advancements of spin properties in organic charge&#8208;transfer cocrystals, and briefly describe the possible mechanisms behind them. Beside the known spin properties (spin multiplicity, mechanoresponsive spin, chiral orbit and spin&#8208;crossover) in binary/ternary cocrystals, other spin phenomena in radical cocrystals and spin transport are also summarized and discussed. Hopefully, deep understanding of current achievements, challenges and perspectives will offer the clear direction for the introduction of spin in organic cocrystals.</dc:description>

         <title>A Dynamic Approach to Synthetic Lectin for Glucose with Boosted Binding Affinity through C&#8211;H Hydrogen Bonds</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A biomimetic receptor for glucose has been developed with high affinity and selectivity. The receptor was efficiently synthesized in three steps through dynamic imine chemistry followed by imine&#8208;to&#8208;amide oxidation. The receptor features two parallel durene panels, forming a hydrophobic pocket for [CH&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;&#960;] interactions, and two pyridinium residues directing four amide bonds towards the pocket. These pyridinium residues not only improve solubility but also provide polarized C&#8208;H bonds for hydrogen bonding. Experimental data and DFT calculations show that these polarized C&#8208;H bonds significantly enhance substrate binding. These findings demonstrate the power of dynamic covalent chemistry for creating molecular receptors and using polarized C&#8208;H bonds for boosted carbohydrate recognition in water, providing a foundation for developing glucose&#8208; responsive materials and sensors.</dc:description>

         <title>Electrocarboxylation Reactions Using CO2 Both as Promoter and Carboxylative Reagent</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Electrocarboxylation reaction, which employs organic electrosynthesis to achieve the utilization of CO2 as a carboxylative reagent, provides a powerful and efficient tool for the preparation of organic carboxylic acid.

         <title>Novel Pyrimidine&#8208;Based Iridium Complexes with Bulky Charge&#8208;Carrier Groups as Dopants for Highly Efficient Green Polymer Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Two new pyrimidine&#8208;based iridium complexes with triphenylamine and tetraphenylsilane, namely (TPAPr)2IrAcac and (TPSPr)2IrAcac, were fully synthesized and characterized. Both of the targeted iridium complexes exhibit excellent thermal stability and high photoluminescence quantum yields. Compared to (TPAPr)2IrAcac, (TPSPr)2IrAcac achieved its highest PLQY and current efficiency (CE) at higher dopant concentration probably because of its bulky tetraphenylsilane group, which can effectively suppress the concentration quenching. However, according to DFT studies, (TPSPr)2IrAcac shows faster non&#8208;radiative transitions due to the presence of more excited&#8208;state distortions than (TPAPr)2IrAcac. As a result, Green phosphorescent polymer light&#8208;emitting diodes (PLEDs) containing (TPAPr)2IrAcac and (TPSPr)2IrAcac as dopants exhibit exceptional device performance with peak CE values of 38.24 cd A&#8208;1 and 36.06 cd A&#8208;1, respectively. (TPAPr)2IrAcac exhibited a superior efficiency than (TPSPr)2IrAcac because of its high &#1060;p, low RMSD value, and efficient energy transfer from the host to the guest. More importantly, the PLEDs based on (TPAPr)2IrAcac and (TPSPr)2IrAcac show stable phosphorescent emission with Commission Internationale de L&#8217;Eclairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.313, 0.497) and (0.299, 0.483), respectively. This work points out a viable method for creating phosphorescent iridium complexes based on pyrimidine for high&#8208;efficiency organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs).</dc:description>

         <title>Pd&#8208;Bi bimetallic nanochains for&#160;electroredution of CO2&#160;to syngas in ionic liquid&#8208;based electrolytes</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Abstract: The electroreduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) is a sustainable method for generating valuable chemicals; however, avoiding unwanted hydrogen (H2) production during electrolysis is a major challenge. Coproduction of carbon monoxide (CO) and H2 to produce syngas is an effective strategy for solving this problem, and syngas with a desired CO/H2 ratio can be employed to produce methanol or other valuable chemicals. Herein, a series of palladium&#8208;bismuth (Pd&#8211;Bi) bimetallic nanochains with different Pd/Bi atomic ratios were prepared and used in the electroreduction of CO2 to syngas in ionic liquid&#8208;based electrolytes. The ratio of CO/H2 in syngas was regulated in a wide range from 1:7 to 9:1 by controlling the applied potentials, Pd/Bi atomic ratios, and composition of the electrolytes. In particular, the current density reached 19.3 mA cm&#8722;2 on Pd3Bi bimetallic nanochains at an applied potential of &#8208;2.3 V vs Ag/Ag+ when the CO/H2 ratio was approximately 1:1. Moreover, the maximum CO Faradaic efficiency was 87.7% for these electrocatalysts at an applied potential of &#8208;2.0 V vs Ag/Ag+. The synergistic effect of Pd and Bi in the ionic liquid&#8208;based electrolyte was the primary reason for the distinct electrocatalytic efficiency of the Pd3Bi bimetallic nanochains. The incorporation of moderate amounts of Bi into the Pd lattice resulted in a stronger CO2 adsorption capacity, more active sites, and faster electron transfer rate, which are conducive to improving the electrocatalytic activity.</dc:description>

Herein, a series of palladium-bismuth (Pd&#8211;Bi) bimetallic nanochains with different Pd/Bi atomic ratios were prepared and used in the electroreduction of CO2 to syngas in ionic liquid-based electrolytes. The ratio of CO/H2 in syngas was regulated in a wide range from 1:7 to 9:1 by controlling the applied potentials, Pd/Bi atomic ratios, and composition of the electrolytes. In particular, the current density reached 19.3 mA cm&#8722;2 on Pd3Bi bimetallic nanochains at an applied potential of -2.3 V vs Ag/Ag+ when the CO/H2 ratio was approximately 1:1. Moreover, the maximum CO Faradaic efficiency was 87.7% for these electrocatalysts at an applied potential of -2.0 V vs Ag/Ag+. The synergistic effect of Pd and Bi in the ionic liquid-based electrolyte was the primary reason for the distinct electrocatalytic efficiency of the Pd3Bi bimetallic nanochains. The incorporation of moderate amounts of Bi into the Pd lattice resulted in a stronger CO2 adsorption capacity, more active sites, and faster electron transfer rate, which are conducive to improving the electrocatalytic activity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Structure Based Discovery of Inhibitors of CYP125 and CYP142 from Mycobacterium tuberculosis</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) was responsible for approximately 1.6 million deaths in 2021. With the emergence of extensive drug resistance, novel therapeutic agents are urgently needed, and continued drug discovery efforts required. Host&#8208;derived lipids such as cholesterol support Mtb&#160;growth, and are also suspected to function in immunomodulation, with links to persistence and immune evasion. Mtb&#160;cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes facilitate key steps in lipid catabolism and thus present potential targets for inhibition. Here we present a series of compounds based on an ethyl 5&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;yl)&#8208;1H&#8208;indole&#8208;2&#8208;carboxylate pharmacophore which bind strongly to both Mtb&#160;cholesterol oxidases CYP125 and CYP142. Using a structure&#8208;guided approach, combined with biophysical characterization, compounds with micromolar range in&#8208;cell activity against clinically relevant drug&#8208;resistant isolates were obtained. These will support further development of much&#8208;needed additional treatment options and provide routes to probe the role of CYP125 and CYP142 in Mtb&#160;pathogenesis.</dc:description>

         <title>Triboelectric nanogenerators assembled by cobalt(II) coordination polymer incorporated composite films and their application for self&#8208;powered anticorrosion</title>
         <description>Chemistry &#8211; A European Journal, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>A friction layer with stability and durability is important to promote the practical application of triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs). In this work, a two&#8208;dimensional cobalt coordination polymer (Co&#8208;CP) was successfully synthesized using cobalt nitrate, 4, 4', 4''&#8208;tricarboxyltriphenylamine and 2,2'&#8208;bipyridine. To clarify the effect of the doping proportions of Co&#8208;CP and the types of conposite polymers on the output performance of the TENG,&#160;Co&#8208;CP was combined with two organic polymers having different polarities (polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and ethyl cellulose (EC)) to form a series of composite films, which were used as the friction electrode materials to fabricate TENGs. Electrical characterizations indicated that a high output current and voltage were obtained from the TENG based on 15 wt% Co&#8208;CP incorporated in PVDF (Co&#8208;CP@PVDF), which could be further improved by the Co&#8208;CP@EC composite film at the same doping ratio. Furthermore, the optimally fabricated TENG was demonstrated to prevent electrochemical corrosion of carbon steel.</dc:description>
